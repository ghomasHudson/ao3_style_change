It was an odd bouquet, Maya admitted, but Dean was an odd man, and he looked happy with it. He was still nervous, still out of his element, but there was more excitement in the twinkle of his eyes than anything else.
And then he does. It’s simple, a light touch, a soft press of their lips together, but the beeping of Cas’s heart monitor goes
The second the last of his grace exits his body, he begins to hear that awful gooey sound that has haunted his every waking minute. In a rush, he closes the vial and stores the knife.
"Krissy Chambers, what d'ya know." He engulfed her in a hug, smiling at Aidan and Josephine behind her. "And you're all still together."
The first time, he's sure of. He felt a hand on his shoulder, slowly coaxing him awake. "Here," Dean said softly, placing a bottle of Gatorade with a straw in it on the nightstand. "Drink this if you can, alright? Get your strength back." Cas nodded and fell back asleep.
Cas kissed him one more time, short and chaste, before dragging them both out of bed to get dressed. They found the others already waiting in the war room with their own bags. Sam and Eileen were still blinking sleep out of their eyes, but Jack had the energy of a golden retriever puppy and was the first out the door.
Cas stared at his ring for a second longer. It was silver and had a small blue gem embedded into it. Maya could swear it appeared to swirl with light.
Cas doesn't let him. He pulls Dean to him by that same hand and whatever short distance remained between them is gone.
They get to the house and are met with endless hugs and excitement to match. Patience, Alex, and Jody are already working on dinner for the bunch, while Charlie, Donna, and Kaia are running around prepping for the next day and dragging along a hesitant but nevertheless happy Claire. Dinner is chaotic and loud and there are way too many people at the table, and Dean has to step outside after a while.
the one with the fucked-up ankle. He's the one who should be sitting at the wheel at 3 am, struggling to keep his eyes open, instead of sprawled out in the backseat snoring like a damn tractor.
Castiel went to close the door, but Dean took a cautious step, bouquet forgotten at his side. "Sick how? You in pain? Do you need anything?"
Dean helped him to his bed where he tried to sit him down, but Castiel must've been weaker than he thought. He flopped backward, and then Dean cautiously lifted his head and placed a pillow underneath.
"Nothin' fancy. My brother and his wife are taking the kiddo for the night so, picnic in the backyard, lookin' at the stars, all that cheesy romantic crap."
"Shut up, Sam." Dean barks, still spinning and scanning the scenery. "If you're even him. What is this, some djinn with a twisted sense of humor!?"
of you,” Jade exclaimed, eagerly taking the pastries. Maya rolled her eyes fondly at the pun, which Cas didn’t seem to catch.
Again, Dean’s brain isn’t all there yet, and he doesn’t realize what he’s doing until he’s already in it. He’s grabbing Cas’s face, digging his fingertips into the back of his hair, and the note is forgotten on the table, and thunder rumbles not that far away. He’s darting out his tongue, begging to explore Cas’s mouth as he’s wanted to do since forever, and Cas lets him. He tastes like toothpaste and coffee and honey and Dean never wants to taste anyone else ever again.
"You and I know my soul ain't exactly fit for heaven, Cas." Dean smiles, extending his arms. "I've been everything in the book. Vamp, demon, archangel vessel, you name it. Sam and I are the exceptions, not the rule. Billie said so, years ago."
In fact, that’s probably all it is. Yeah, that's it. The hunt was long and crappy and they've barely slept, and Dean is too exhausted to hold himself back. Too sleepy to force his desires down, to pretend that he doesn’t want…
A second later Dean was gently hoisting him back to his feet, strong hands at his sides, saying "Here, I'll help you change. Promise I won't look.
Cas’s head shot up, and Dean caught only a brief sight of his eyes turning glassy before Cas pressed their lips together again, wanting and caring and so, so incredibly loving. It was as Cas pulled away that it dawned on Dean: he’d never, in his life, felt as happy, as satisfied, as
"Yeah, not the point, Cas. The point is—" He takes Cas's hands again, one holding the knife, one holding the vial. Cas looks down at them, refusing to meet Dean's eyes. "We do the spell, you save some of that grace for later, this place spits us both out. Once we're topside, you put me back in my body, and the grace you put in here—" He squeezes the hand holding the vial.
Dean tossed an arm around Jack’s shoulders, ruffling the back of his head in the process. “So do I, kid.”
Over Garth's shoulder he spotted some faces. They were vaguely familiar, but one in particular was prominent in his memory, one he hadn't seen in far too long and now looked much older than at their last encounter.
By the time he was 25 years old, Dean knew he was bi. He hated it, he never spoke about it, and he ignored it as much as he could, but he was aware of it. And he knew he was bi because, at 25 years old, he’d already gone through two serious breakups, and they both equally sucked.
There was a chilly breeze in the air, the water was freezing, and they had the whole beach to themselves (because, again,
Cas looks straight ahead, weaving through the bunker halls with practiced ease, and he's blissfully unaware of Dean's staring. This is probably creepy, Dean realizes, so he closes his eyes.
Dean remembers. He was walking Charlie to her dorm when it started drizzling, and it was pouring by the time he made it back to his car. Dean had a night shift at the gas station and was about to head there.
“Anything else?” She asked him. Dean donned a thousand-yard stare as he thought about it, and Maya figured this man had been through a lot. More than she could ever imagine. She was glad he’d found some peace.
"What're you gonna do?" Dean asks, unlacing his boots, and looking up at him. He's still at arm's length. Always at arm's length.
"Well, yeah. At one point, I guess. You had a good thing going though, with the apocalypse world hunters and Bobby. Thought you might wanna..." Dean shrugs, gestures vaguely with his bottle. It's heaven. They're in heaven. Just drink and be happy. "Nevermind." He drinks, and so does Sam. "How'd Eileen take that?"
When they go back inside, Claire sits back down in her spot at Cas's left, across the table from Dean, and leans on his shoulder for a while too. It's her way of saying she cares, of saying
It’s really no use correcting him; the entire animal kingdom could be falling from the sky right now and there wouldn't be much of a difference. The winds are definitely knocking things over, and the streets will certainly be flooded come morning. Dean wonders for how long the university will cancel classes after this (if at all, the heartless bloodsuckers).
He doesn’t wait for Cas to respond before he wraps it around his shoulders as well. The fireworks continue.
because he couldn't get him off his mind. This caring, thoughtful, heaven-sent guy who showed up with flowers, now in a vase on his dining table, found Cas with food poisoning and proceeded to take care of him, his dog, and his apartment the rest of the night.
. It was something that hit Dean in waves sometimes, knocking the wind out of him and reminding him how absurdly lucky he was.
The first was Lee. He hunted with Dean and John for about a year, the second half of which Dean and Lee spent sneaking around and hooking up behind John’s back. It was fun, and hot, and exciting, and some of the best hookups he’d had up until that point in his life were with Lee.
It's a genuine question. Dean pulls off the second boot and stands. Still with a smile on his face, he says "it's nothin'."
Dean slumped against the car as he filled the tank, and as Sam climbed back in, Cas climbed out, settling next to him.
"Cas,” Dean starts and meets his gaze again. He exhales upon seeing Cas’s expression, like something inside him melted into a puddle. He bites his bottom lip and smiles, but Cas fears he might tear up again at any second. “Cas, the way I feel about you, it's… it’s crazy, okay? It’s insane.”
And so the evening began. Everyone caught each other up, told some stories. Claire and Kaia were officially together, Krissy and Aidan were very much not. Baby Sam and Castiel were growing up great, and Garth was ecstatic to finally meet his son’s namesake. Donna brought a freaking karaoke machine, so in between stuffing their faces with snacks (yes, licorice included, much to Sam’s disgust), everyone would take turns at the mic. Among the highlights: Alex, Patience, and Claire’s
They’ve been raising a kid together too, along with Sam and Eileen, and that kid is also God. After saving the world and whatnot, Jack decided to bring back some of their friends and family that died over the years: Mary, Kevin, Charlie. Yes, there are two Charlies now, but it’s not as confusing as you’d expect. (One is from another dimension, and the other one is Dean’s little sister. Simple.) Mary’s off hunting most of the time and Kevin’s applying to college.
Dean is storming out of his bedroom (no pun intended) before he knows it. He barely even feels his feet moving, too focused on the pounding in his ears and the dryness in his mouth. He doesn’t go into the living room, not yet; his feet stop at the end of the short hallway and he braces himself against the wall. The room is spinning and he can barely breathe.
And then their chests are pressed flush against each other, but it's more an embrace than anything else. Their lips part, but Cas's hands are still at Dean's sides, Dean's are still on Cas's face, and their breaths are still mingling. Foreheads touching. Dean plants a kiss on Cas's hairline and rests his head there.
And then Cas finds Dean asleep on his couch, Honey snuggled into his side. And yeah, he's probably going to marry this guy. This schoolteacher who happened to pick him and his office as a field trip destination for his math kids. This adorable guy that came back later that same day, thanked him for getting through to the kids (which Cas didn't think he had, but he digresses), and then asked him out. This unbelievably sweet guy that Cas initially rejected, god knows why, but then called at his school and left a message for,
They’ve got extended family now too, Jody and the girls. OG Charlie is staying with them for now, while she finds her footing. Most of that household is queer. Most of
Dean drops his head on Cas's shoulder, buries his face in the crook of his neck. "Yeah. 'm sorry," he mumbles into it.
It’s a habit by now, asking each other that question. It’s part of the working-through-a-decade’s-worth-of-shit thing they’re doing. Turns out they share a whole lot of trauma. They share worries and insecurities. They share nightmares sometimes, mostly about the Empty.
"I don't have a soul, Dean, you can't just absorb me. And how would you even get out? There's no portal waiting for you here. And I'm assuming you're dead, which is, as I was saying, idiotic."
Before Cas can think about marrying him again (which he was going to, the hopeless romantic), Honey startles and jumps off the couch, waking Dean. Cas doesn't move, just watches as Dean sits up, notices him, then sits up straighter.
"Dean, thank you." At that, Dean looks up. "Thank you. You could've just left, but you chose to stay. And you went above and beyond. Thank you."
If anyone ever asked him to mention one thing he likes about Cas, just one, he'd probably say how genuine Cas is, how he takes everything to heart and speaks from it as well. Dean said just one word,
He reached into a tote bag that Maya hadn’t noticed he was carrying and pulled out a plastic container. “We run a small baking business out of our home. These are on me. Apple and honey tarts.” He placed the container in front of her. On top of it was a label that read
“I have learned, on my trips back to Heaven, that I was an Angel who lamented killing Egypt’s firstborn. I tried to talk my stronger brethren into talking with God to take pity on those in Sodom and Gomorrah. I asked for the Nephilim children to be spared, their parents to be spoken with. I wished to have more arks built. I have always cared for humanity, Dean. There are volumes on me in Heaven.”
“Not enough to come back, man. And fuck, not enough when I got here. What the fuck is that? Do you even…”
Cas chuckled. “No, Dean. Again, I do not betray confidences, even my own. However, I am sure your brother has an inkling.”
Dean’s eyes never left his face, and Cas felt exposed for a brief moment as Dean’s eyes traveled from his eyes to his lips, then back up again.
Cas’s left corner of his mouth tugged up in a type of half-smile. He made a non-committal noise as he continued to walk through the orchids; his long fingers stopping every now and then to stroke the buds. As Cas was admiring the flowers, Dean was admiring Cas. The view was equally beautiful for both.
“Had a bad year.” Now Dean intercedes, pulling his husband toward the map table, where they all have a seat.
“The empty accepted my offer but said it would only collect when I was happy and allowed the sun to shine on my face.”
Cas knew he was never meant to be a Guardian, but he felt responsible for her somehow. Maybe because his actions, however well intended, led to the death of her Angel. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, often felt guilty for things that were not strictly his fault. This was just one of the emotions he was never supposed to feel, and one of the many he never felt before meeting the Winchesters, especially the eldest brother. He knew Victoria could read his mind, he knew there were things there that he didn’t want exposed, but he was the last angel on earth, and because he was Cas, he felt he owed her something.
Uriel folds his hands in front of his vessel’s body and turns to the scene in front of him, a carnival.
Cas looks to him then, sad blue prominent on a tired face. “Will you, would you care to lay with me?”
Victoria wondered what type of Angel watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Probably also the type of Angel who has an unidentified Angel emotion. She could almost feel the heat off of it.
The next year was shit. Just shit, plain and simple. Losing Jack, losing mom. Knowing they were being played by Chuck the whole damn time. And Cas.
Castiel has to fly away them, back to the office because he can no longer take it, the heat, the intensity, the feelings – they all had to be
As she looks into his face; he chances a glimpse into her soul. He sees a young man she was intended to marry next month. He sees a mother, a sister, a niece. If Castiel had a heart, it would have broken. His face once more becomes stone.
Dean allows a laugh to escape through his nose. “Cas, this is Jo, the little sister I never asked for.”
She didn’t enjoy being interrupted while she was thinking, even if what she was thinking about was not of import. “My what?”
In the pit of his grace, hid in folds, a scarlet wavelength begins to throb, drawing the Seraph’s attention. For some reason he cannot explain, the angel wishes to make himself known in an attempt to comfort the human. He settles the foreign emotion as he watches the man continue to thrash about the room, finally plopping himself on the ornate bed.
Dean reluctantly pulled away from Cas, and both men instantly felt cold, despite the kitchen’s warmth.
“I told Jess about our life after a year because it was driving more of a wedge between us than anything else. So yeah, I told her everything, let her make her own decision about me, about everything. And Dean, you encouraged me to do that. But, I – I get it, you’ve only known Cas a few days and its only attraction at this point. Get to know him, see what happens, but don’t completely rule out the possibility of maybe telling him at some point, okay?”
The older man pulls a leather-bound journal out of his well-worn leather jacket. He opens it to a page that details information about several disappearances in Montana, with witnesses stating they heard human cries before their friends / loved ones went missing.
The angel sits in the chair, drink in hand. He does not even turn his head when he hears the door open.
I do not own Supernatural, or any other TV Show, Movie, Book, Website, Webpage, and/or App mentioned in this tale.
Castiel pulled the demon knife from his waistband while still maintaining eye contact with Dean. Their main adversary in the green room would be Zachariah, and Castiel knew he needed a very important sigil drawn with his own blood to deal with him.
Claire handed him a bottle of red wine. “Cas bought this for dinner. I think it’s supposed to breathe or whatever.”
Cas and Dean spend the morning together: cooking, eating, and rearranging. The creatures move about in their roles. Claire meets a lovely young woman in the park. The Void goes about his plan.
He inclines his head toward the drink in front of her. “I took the liberty of ordering your favorite.”
Cas sighs, a full body motion that moves the bed a little. “And I am subconsciously trying to save him?”
He can feel the pace of the heartbeat underneath his hand increase and he once more looks into blue eyes now filled with more pupil than iris. Pale, pink lips utter:
Castiel looks to him, his words coming easily and full of meaning he wishes he could convey with his true voice in his true form with everything there is in him:
“Yes, Dean?” He inquires once they are outside, they both know it is only an illusion, but it does offer a different air.
Zachariah shrugs. “I don’t know? Sit on a cloud? Play a harp? I don’t really care what you do as long as it’s not
that evoked more emotion, and Castiel was so new to human sentiment he feared the look may make him waver, and he enjoyed being resolute.
Ezekiel had told her they fought together. He trusted him. That set her more at ease. She wondered if her Angel was on the Hell mission.
Humor, a fairly foreign concept to an angel, although they did have some jokes they shared amongst themselves. Uriel was known for retelling them well.
Cas stopped, causing Dean to stop abruptly beside him. Dean noticed they were back in front of the fountain. The blue-eyed man tilted his head and studied Dean intently.
Now Dean’s anger is apparent in his green eyes, and he holds his younger self tighter. “If you said anything to hurt him…”
The Void places hands interlaced on top of the table. His dark eyes look into the man in front of him.
Dean rolls his eyes as Chuck drinks straight from the bottle and turns his attention to the angel in front of him.
Cas’s eyebrows reached towards his forehead. “I am at a loss here, Dean. I normally eat yogurt and fruit for breakfast.”
Dean begins to work on the sensitive place he treasures on the angel’s neck and seeks the heat as Cas’s body presses up into him. Dean props himself up on one arm and then reaches down to grab Cas’s ass to push their groins closer together – his mind fresh with want, his body quaking with need.
Once they are on the lanai, and the glass doors are closed behind them, Dean takes Cas into a tight hug. “Why’d you start without me, Babe?”
Castiel halfway knew the last four words were meant for him, and he retreated into himself, attempting to put up the mask that had often protected him in the past. He attempted to guard himself and build defenses, blocking the pain that was coming at him from every angle.
The being took note of the girl leaving her apartment and decided to use the opportunity to investigate the young woman further. She slinks to Kaia’s door and lets herself in, as if the action of opening a locked door took no effort at all. Which, to be fair, it did not.
“You’re teaching here?” Dean tried to hide the hint of excitement in his voice, he really did. If Cas was teaching here, maybe he intended to stay here, and things such as location would not have to be discussed down the road, if there was a down the road.
Deep blue pierced into her, fear encompassing those oceanic eyes, as if he were a trapped animal and there was nowhere to run. Because he couldn’t, because his wings were broken, and there was no way to fly. His throat felt constricted, and he began nervously swallowing air, trying to breathe and make his handmade vessel cooperate. “Please…”
The landlord is a burly, short man, who the creature assumes must be in his human fifties. He has slick backed salt and pepper hair, and a goatee. Hannah regards him with much the same interest one would an ant, interested in its existence, but not enough to do anything about it.
Castiel’s superior was answering all the questions, and much like in a motel room with another angel not so long ago, Castiel simply stood.
“Yes.” Victoria closed her eyes in relief. Maybe this Angel could help her find hers. Hers had far less colors and was much simpler.
Dean wonders how the all-powerful entity in front of him can teeter between the drunk writer they met all those years ago, and a cruel and capricious god. Dean shrugs as he enjoys his breakfast.
God, Cas was beautiful here, his blue eyes blown all to hell with lust, his cheeks flushed, his hair even more messy than usual. Dean sighs and opens his arms for Cas to lay on his chest.
Cas closes his eyes and looks up, as if he can almost feel the appendages stretching, reaching their full limits before they curl back into themselves and reside on another plane.
Dean tucked his legs up underneath him so the Angel could sit opposite. He could feel Cas’s hesitation, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t hesitant himself. Cas mimicked the hunter’s posture. He tilted his head, hoping Dean would explain the necessity for this change of seating.
Zachariah sits on the edge of a desk, hands joined together on his lap. “I need you two to go and retrieve Anna from the Winchesters.”
Castiel’s voice causes the glass in the station to burst, raining shards on Dean. Castiel attempts to rush to him to heal his wounds, but as his soul is once more covered by the man’s body and everything has been completely healed, Castiel cannot heal him. He winces slightly as the work he completed so beautifully was ruined so soon by him. Castiel returns to Heaven, attempting to find a solution to talk to Dean, as his vessel was not quite ready, although the time was nigh.
Dean grabs his chin and forces his eyes to look into his own, a gesture they were both familiar with. “Whatever it is, you end up here.”
Thank God, a case. She almost sighed with relief. Away from the Winchesters, away from the weird ass ‘bunker’ or fortress, and away from the Angel. Okay, that was a little bit of a bummer, she needed to hone her powers. But getting away from the emotions and the obvious suppression of them by every single one of the people
The nightmare is apparent as soon as Castiel lands in the room. Dean is remembering Hell in vivid, grace-altering detail. Castiel laments how he was under instruction not to remove the memories of Hell from Dean’s memory, he also regrets threatening to return Dean to the place he was now dreaming of. Castiel sits gingerly on the bed, hoping to wake Dean from the nightmare. When Dean looks at him with surprise, he attempts a type of inquisitive kindness, but sorely misses the mark.
Castiel knows the words are true, that is exactly what he is being right now, but not what he wants, what he yearns to be.
Dean’s face holds pure amusement, and Cas delights in the man’s crow’s feet and smile lines. His blue eyes search Dean’s face earnestly, trying to commit to memory that look.
I felt so bad leaving y'all with the last chapter as it was such a rough one! This one is full of Cas, Dean, and Dean and Cas. Some parts of it are definitely fluffy, and I hope it does a fairly good job explaining both men's actions (especially Dean's). There is a part in here that is taken from 15x9, but it does not include spoilers, as it is used in a (slightly) different context.
He knew, of course he knew. But it was his job to pretend he didn’t. His job to act as if this were right, and there was not a piffling in the back of his mind whispering the name
The angel offers Castiel a small, sad smile. “No, I fear not. In fact, Naomi has threatened to replace me if I am unable to locate the being responsible for these…” He waves towards the file folders, “events.” He finishes his drink in one swallow and pours another from the ether.
Dean’s senses kick in then and he lets go of the angel and slumps into one of the chairs on the dock.
A tall, thin man enters the room; his dark hair slicked back, deep brown eyes shining from underneath thick brows. His words leave his mouth languidly, as if they were held on his tongue and emerged only from annoyance at having to be spoken.
And if those words right there didn’t hit the nail on the frickin’ head, what did? Basically, everything that has happened to Dean since can be summed up by that.
The Seraph appears startled, a hint of confusion in a sea of blue. “He tortured souls in Hell, I saw him at work, we would be foolish to think any of our methods would cause him to divulge information.”
Cas offers him a sleepy smirk. Dean’s crashes onto his lips instantly. Cas easily switches their positions.
“You made me care. I wanted to be around your soul, I wanted to feel the heat, I wanted your goodness, your passion, to engulf me, to ruin me, to make me undone. Dean, yes, your body offers mine extreme pleasure, you lift me to heights my wings would never have taken me. But you would be no less the love of my eternal existence, and I no less in love with you, had you wished we had no physical connection.”
Sam pushes his mug toward the center of the table and pats his brother and Cas on the shoulder before leaving.
Thank you so, so much for reading!! I would LOVE to hear from y'all!! Comments make my day and warm my heart y'all!! Kudos are so appreciated, and subscriptions and bookmarks make me smile. Y'all are the absolute best!!
He looks into the hospital room Dean is currently occupying, hooked up to too many machines. He cannot look, not really. He makes eye contact with Sam, wishing for the man to follow him into the hallway.
Castiel did not understand some of the words, but he fully understood the gist. Dean didn’t want Paradise is it wasn’t real. And although that caused him pain, and he turned away, he also knew, he knew – there was his Champion.
Jack pops into the midst of a crowd. Eileen, Jody, Donna, Patience, Kaia, Claire, Rowena, Cas, Dean, and Sam are all standing around in a circle with him in the middle. They all shout “Happy Birthday”. He looks at his cake and sees a “5” candle in the middle. His eyes brim with tears and he looks at everyone around him.
“We just got back from being needed!” Castiel can feel the anger radiate from the hunter, he can feel Dean’s anger in his grace and the emotion lightens the load just a bit.
“Hum.” The Void’s eyes look toward the ceiling and he begins to move his fingers so that the tips will disconnect and reconnect once more, in a type of drumming against each other motion.
“Yes, it was a difficult time. Claire’s mother went on a downward spiral, and I had custody of Claire for a few years, until Amelia recovered.”
Victoria closed her eyes and put her head against the steering wheel. She had to focus. Sam could sense that and got out of the car to meet Dean and Cas.
Sam downed the rest of his beer and went to get two more. He knew the three of them were like brothers, well he and Cas were, and he would do anything for Cas, die for him even, but he couldn’t stifle the twinge of jealousy he felt that Dean and Cas shared a more ‘profound bond’, a bond Sam knew went much deeper than either the Hunter or the Angel would ever come to terms with. Ever is a final word though, and Sam hoped, that maybe, just maybe he was wrong. His jealously went a little further than the bond though, because he had always believed, always had faith, yet it was Dean who got the angel.
Cas ran his finger along Dean’s jawline. Which caused the hunter to not want to continue conversation but to continue something else.
“Hum.” The Void nods thoughtfully. “I understand. However, that is simply indicative of the fine job you have done assuming Lee’s identity. You have embraced your calling completely.”
Chuck looks to Castiel and something almost softens in his eyes, but the Chuck mask is once more put on, and he continues.
Dean couldn’t believe they had stumbled across a chosen one in a routine case, but the more he thought about it, the more he could believe it. He actually wondered how they hadn’t ran into one before.
He breaks in on the hunter’s disbelief with words that seemed natural, although he did not know why.
“Maybe. But, where a piece no longer exists, another can patch up the missing space, but not fill it completely – because no two pieces are the same. Chloe is just another part of our puzzle, where she makes us more complete.”
Castiel looked at his hands, a human gesture that stunned the Chosen One. He lacked the confidence, the surety of his kind – just another element making him remarkable.
“Of course, Dean.” Cas was making the coffee and watched as it dripped, his anticipation apparent in every fiber of his being.
. The hug expressed everything, and just like the first time the two men embraced, it was everything.
“Well, I’d like to think it was. Maybe not as lovers, or partners, but Cas, there will always be something between us. You were everything I didn’t know I needed.”
Dean falters, there is a sadness there that pains him ever so slightly. But, because he is Dean Winchester dealing with Castiel, he gets up and heads into the house. Just because they were now a couple with disgustingly cute pet names and were acting like they were in some Hallmark movie, they were still
They scrunch their noses up at one another in a mocking gesture. Cas feels a smile tug at the corner of his mouth.
Cas pulls him up, nods at their waitress and then the table in order to indicate that he left money. She nods, and Cas pulls him towards the back entrance.
“Yes, I did turn the screw a little. Alastair should’ve killed Dean and escaped, and you should’ve gone on happily scapegoating the demons.”
Cas watched with appreciation as Dean flipped the slightly cooked eggs perfectly. He put the vegetables and cheese in the center along with some bacon (because Dean) and flipped them perfectly again. Castiel had to admit, it was incredibly sexy. Well, most things about Dean were sexy.
And here it was, the truth, the reason, the demand which gave Cas a gnawing feeling in the pit of his grace.
A modest brick house sits a-ways back from the road in Lawrence, Kansas. The sole occupant of the home walks back and forth in his living room, going from his record player to his canvas, where a portrait of a green-eyed man smiling as he skips rocks is in the process of being painted. The inhabitant puts his paintbrush between his teeth and goes once more to the record player, unsatisfied with the current selection. He looks over his shoulder at the painting he so meticulously designed, a sad, wistful smile playing on his lips. He flips through the records and pulls out the one that reminds him of his inspiration. He lifts the needle delicately, pulls the record off that was playing, and replaces it with the album he chose.
. Castiel didn’t have a donkey; however, he thought that was not the most pertinent information to offer at present. The angel offers Dean the truth, one which the older man was able to discover, apparently. Which was very, very impressive.
The angel begins to stroke his boyfriend’s hair, his thumb resting ever so slightly on his forehead.
Castiel’s grace flows unsteadily as he contemplates the best answer for the angel in front of him. “He saved me, and Dean. He… killed Alistair.”
The girl could not be anymore than twenty. She is lovely, with dark hair and brown eyes. The creature regards her with slight curiosity.
The shock on Dean’s face is prominent, but because he is a master at hiding his emotions, he quickly hides it, instead removing his hand from Chuck’s chest and staring at Castiel for a moment before lowering his eyes.
He thinks to Dean suddenly, and Jimmy. Will Dean find him, help him? An empty vessel is a beacon to all things evil. Jimmy is a good man if…
Castiel looks back then into green eyes, and something ‘clicks’. He is unsure of what it is, but he wants to tell the Righteous Man all over again. He wants to let him run if he so chooses.
Cas looked down at his niece, blue eyes flashing a warning. “Claire, I’m sure Dean has better things to do than…”
“Well, I figure since you two drank my wife’s most expensive bottle of liquor and snuggled on my couch all night, you owe me breakfast. And Jo’s new whatever is coming by, so uh, make it for six, huh princess?”
Castiel’s eyes look toward the pillow on which Dean had been laying his head only moments before. “I understand.”
She nods and makes an agreeable noise. Crowley obtains obscene pleasure from her picking up her drink. She takes a sip and he watches her lips greedily. Her eyes widen as she regards the demon’s want, a look of bemusement overtaking her beautiful features. She shakes her head slightly as she sets her drink back down.
Cas looks to Dean as the hunter is opening the bottle and the green-eyed man simply shrugs with a coy smile playing upon his beautiful face.
Cas is surprised to see Dean sitting at a table by himself. He looks around, realizes this is an inclusive strip club, smiles to himself, and walks up to his future husband.
She rubbed his stubble with her thumb, other hand making its way to the Angel’s shoulder. “No, I believe you are a very extraordinary one.”
Cas, through hazy vision, noticed Dean putting his empty hamper next to the bed. He thanked him, repeatedly. Cas isn't sure how many times he said it, over and over again,
Cas laughs again, and the beaming smile on Dean's face is what convinces him. He is definitely going to marry this guy.
For years now Dean had pretended he wasn’t sick. He pretended to not stare at Patrick Swayze too much whenever Dirty Dancing played on TV. He pretended like he didn't imagine what it would be like to kiss a guy, what stubble would feel like against his lips if he ever did.
Dean’s fixation on blue flowers suddenly made sense too, as she noticed his eyes. "He adores you, you know. You're his heaven and earth."
They eventually pull away, breathless and giddy. The only sounds are the rain and the wind. Dean opens his eyes first, needing to see Cas and make sure this is completely, definitely, unequivocally real. Cas is smiling and taking deep breaths, and a weight seems to be lifted off his shoulders. He opens his eyes a second later, and even in the darkness, even with just the faint candlelight, the blue in them seems to shine. And even though there's no power, it feels as if there's electricity crackling in the air around them. It might be the storm.
Sam to sit in the back. There's more to it than just the close call though, and if Dean let himself think about it for more than a second, he'd know why. Deep down, he
He certainly doesn’t expect it when Cas walks into the library after his weekly Thursday evening call with Claire and announces, matter-of-factly and with air quotes, “We’re going to
He's cuddling up to his father, Dean's angel-no-more, whom they just rescued from the Empty a few hours ago. With whom he still has so much to talk about. Jack's tiny arms are wrapped around his neck and his head is pressed tightly against it, and Cas is smiling like he could fly all over again.
It was on one of those hunts that he met Cassie, and she was yet another handful of firsts for Dean over the course of a few months. She was amazing, and he fell hard and fast, but of course that went up in flames too.
Dean was 25 years old when he realized that a small part of him kind of, sort of, wanted to be part of this community. He couldn’t though. Not if he wanted to be on good terms with Dad. Not if he aimed to be the man Dad wanted him to be.
He finds Claire’s blonde head amongst the sea of shoppers at the edge of the park. She’s holding hands with Kaia and has one of the biggest smiles Dean has ever seen on her face. There’s no shame in it, and she’s not in any danger either. Things are different now, and she has the freedom to be herself that he never had at her age.
“So anyway,” Charlie said after a while of recounting what she’d been up to. "How single are you right now? My answer is: miserably."
him, stroking the hair at the back of his neck with his fingertips. Dean leaves a soft kiss on Cas's neck and hugs him even tighter, arms wrapped around him, under the stupid coat and jacket. He inhales deeply; Cas smells like honey and a thunderstorm, and Dean fucking loves it.
The parade leads up to a sloping park, and at the lowest point of it, there’s a stage where Dean assumes someone will MC for the afternoon, or maybe perform. It’s grandiose in its simplicity, kind of like a Greek theater, with everyone settling down on the grass around it, expectantly.
And it suddenly all comes rushing back to Dean. How unfairly he treated him. How much pressure he put on him. How little he appreciated all that he did.
"I didn't keep hunting," Sam says, like it's the most obvious thing in the universe. "Dude, I retired."
He drops his head and sniffles again. Cas lays another kiss on his hand, his bruised knuckles this time. After a moment Dean looks back up at him, pushes Cas’s hair back, and studies his face as if he can’t get enough of it.
"It was everything," Cas says stepping forward, placing a beckoning hand on Dean's shoulder. Dean finally looks at him with a barely-there smile and a gaze that wants to escape, but he fights for it to stay on Castiel's face. Cas is glad he does, because he needs Dean to see,
Dean needed to clear his head after that. He could barely look his dad in the eye after that close call, couldn't let him see the sorrow he was feeling. With every interaction, he imagined how John would yell at him, probably try to beat it out of him, if he noticed all he was feeling over Lee. Or worse, John could ignore him, practically disown him like he did Sam.
Dean and the girls approached him and wished him a Happy Birthday as they gave him their gift. Dean made it a point to introduce Lisa’s friend, Pia, the one that David had a crush on, making it seem like him getting Lisa to bring her wasn’t at all calculated. He could see it on David’s face though, he was nervous to meet her and it kind of made Dean smile. He knew how it felt.
And there was that deep, gravelly voice again that definitely did not make Dean shift where he stood.
“But uh, but, Jack was right. I was so bitter, Cas, when you were gone, when Lucifer killed you. And man, I just about had given up, you know? Nothing seemed worth it anymore and I was so hard on that kid.”
right. And this? This felt wrong. But he continues, spouting the company line, although having no idea what that term means. He wouldn’t for years, and yet, he still knew there was something
Brunch is served, Castiel makes an ill-fated trip upstairs, a certain sugar-loving half-angel kids pops in, Cas has to make a tough decision, and Past Dean and Sam decide to go out for dinner.
Sam and Eileen appear next to them at the dessert table. Dean has every type of pie the barbeque offers on his plate, Cas staring at him lovingly.
Claire sits back down. “He kept expecting her to come back, because he always did, and he just thought people were as loyal as he was. She never did, and then we got her fucking wedding invitation in the mail. I convinced him to see a therapist after that, helped him a lot. I thought you’d be good for him, Dean.”
Jess plopped down on the couch. “You two are so hot for each other. I felt embarrassed for his niece.”
Zachariah clicks his tongue and begins to walk again. “I beg to differ. I mean, he’s screwing a demon.”
Dean wakes to find Cas laying on his chest, his leg swung over Dean’s groin, and his arm crooked and holding onto his shoulder. The sheets barely cover them, and he realizes this is the most intimate he has ever been with anyone in the entirety of his life. He bore his body to Cas, yes, but the raw bearing of his soul was the source of the intimacy – and Dean is undone by the purity of it. He can feel Cas’s hot breath on his pectoral, and he begins to rub the other man’s bare back up and down. Cas visibly shudders when Dean reaches his shoulder blade, and Dean is greeted by a sleepy blue.
He allows the shock to be registered by his inferiors before continuing. Although with Uriel it was less shock more resignation; the emotion expected from an angel. Before Castiel could interrupt with whatever shock was going to come forth from his vessel’s lips, Zachariah continued.
Dean walks closer to him to inspect the pie. He looks at the uneven lattice, the flour on Cas’s t shirt and pants, and the purple cherry juice stains that still remain on Cas’s fingers. He realizes Cas made that thing from scratch for him.
Dean puts his hands on Cas’s waist and Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s neck. They begin to sway back and forth slowly, their gazes never wavering.
He steps away, going about his cooking, trying to ignore the angel he left, still bracing himself against the counter.
As the little girl with strawberry blonde hair and freckles bounces her way back into her home, Castiel feels strangely as another prayer pulls on his grace, much differently than ones previous, it is strong, and unable to be ignored.
“Of course not, Dean. Humanity is beautiful, you know I admire your entire species, you and Sam especially.”
Heat, so much heat. Castiel called to mind the wars, the famines, the people crying in streets, dying from cold, toiling in the hot sun until their bodies were broken, their skin cracked. He thought of all the people he couldn’t save because he was one angel on a mission from a Heaven that did not care for the people it was meant to shepherd. He watched as atrocity after atrocity occurred – all because of man’s
“What is it that you do Castiel?” Victor smiles slightly as he makes eye contact with the professor.
Castiel loathes the being in front of him. He knows he cannot smite him since the demon is too powerful, but he knows he must fight, for Dean. He raises his hand to twist the knife still lodged in Alastair’s shoulder.
“Sam was trying to cheer me up with strip clubs and a shit ton of beer. And I just didn’t feel anything. I kinda felt like I did all those years ago when Famine told me there was nothing in me to want. I didn’t want anything Cas.” Dean decided to just plunge in here, let it out, hell, why not right? It was the end of the world, again. “Except you, man.”
Castiel simply hums and focuses his attention on his charge. “Aren’t you eating rapidly? Won’t you develop indigestion?”
Mary Winchester came out of the kitchen with a plate of cookies. Cas was following behind her. Victoria’s eyes immediately were drawn to him, the feelings of his emotion washing over her, making her senses temporarily dulled. She felt the pull between the Grace swirling through the vessel and Dean’s arm. It was almost tangible, like a string. She knew the eldest Winchester would not be able to feel the pull, not really, but she wondered how the Seraph could be separated from his charge at all, considering the gravity of that pull. She accessed the part of her brain that enabled her to turn ‘off’ her supernatural hearing and allowed her to assess her situation like the hunter she was.
Castiel looks up to the ceiling and shakes his head. “I have become very fond of your cooking, Dean.”
Cas pauses his chopping and braces himself against the counter with his palms. “I can assure you I am not normally so forward. I am one to lean toward the romantic, sometimes even being criticized for my gestures. However, you… you are the exception to my rule.” He hopes like hell Dean will be the exception when it comes to the
The Seraph spreads his wings and soars, headed for earth, headed for his righteous man. For the only thought that entered the forefront of his grace when he was re-created was
Victoria placed herself in such a position that she could brush against Dean’s left arm. Her connection with the Grace was instantaneous and pulled her into a memory.
Sam intervenes, ostensibly afraid Uriel would hurt his brother. Which, to be fair, was not that much of a leap.
They spread the papers out on the table and Dean plops his timeline in the middle of it. “Okay, so first, there’s this seismograph Balthazar gave to Cas.”
Cas’s eyes narrow, his brow furrows before realization dawns upon him and he laughs. An actual laugh that makes Dean’s heart slowly rebuild.
Dean feels Cas move closer to him, and when he looks back down, Cas’s mouth is mere inches from his own.
Past Dean follows Sam and shakes his head at the older version of himself going back into the kitchen with the cookbook.
. It’s thought, it’s spoken, it’s a prayer – it’s from a piece of a puzzle floating alone in the ether.
Cas wrapped his arms around his hunter, pulling him into him. Dean settled his hands on Cas’s waist.
Cas sighs, then smiles, thinking about how this is the exact opposite from his conversation with Sam. “Dr. Novak.”
I messed up last chapter and named the character "Merv" when it was supposed to be "Marv." Apparently I forgot Metatron's nickname, I am so sorry! I am going to go back and correct that, but this chapter will refer to him as "Marv". Sorry for the confusion!!
Castiel folds his hands on top of the table and looks towards a speck of dust floating around a light. “This place is heavily warded. I am surprised I was able to land here.”
With the smallest movement of his index finger the creature once more returns to the void, never to speak again. The Void toes the next closest minion, causing the new creature to rise instead.
Dean looked over at him, “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Dean was used to this, but not from Sammy. Only that one time after the musical at the school where his younger brother tried to combine his and the angel’s names.
“Perhaps. I was tasked with pulling the vessel for Michael out of hell. I did so, and I know that should have been it, but I…”
Dean looks startled for a second, eyes wide, searching Cas' face. After a moment, he smiles his beautiful breathtaking smile. "Yes."
Cas invaded Dean's mouth, tongue plunging in and twirling around Dean's. Finally, fucking finally, Dean gripped his hips and pushed, indicating he was ready. Cas slid himself almost all the way out, then back in slowly. After a few gentle thrusts, he began to move harder, faster, drawing long moans of pleasure from both men, Dean pushing his hips down to meet each of his thrusts.
Cas laughs, and it is a damn beautiful sound. "She likes you." He says, watching the chicken with a twinkle in his eye. "You know, she's the one who made you faceplant on the bus?" Cas says, smiling.
Fern Guy has the sheet off what Dean can now see is a cage, he's standing up trying to keep his balance while attempting to collect things that are scurrying around the bus, things that are making a shit ton of noise.
"I thought I was meeting you out there. I was just heading there." Dean said gesturing down the hall.
Dean started to move his hands in small circles on Cas' hips, lifting his shirt up a bit to get to more skin. Cas leaned into the touch, feeling himself growing hard in his pants. He could feel Dean's hardness pressing against his ass, and pushed his ass back against it.
Dean grunted, digging his blunt nails into Cas' back. Cas moaned, feeling Dean's heat enclose around him.
"Fine, I have job hunting to do, happy?" Cas replies, standing up. "It was nice to meet you Charlie. I'm sure I'll see you around."
Dean's staring at him, and he's staring back. Now's his chance. Just say something. Ask him to come in, ask him to talk. Tell him you're sorry.
Dean steps back and motions Cas inside, and for the trifecta of failed parts of his plan, he steps through the door. So much for that. Cas hands the bag to Dean, and he asks Cas to follow him back to the kitchen. When they get there, Dean grabs an envelope off the counter and hands it to him.
"Yes, I do. She sounds amazing!" Claire says, reaching for the lever to push the passenger seat forward.
After twenty minutes are up, he gives himself ten more, then forces himself up, and downstairs to make coffee and eat something.
After what feels like hours of deliberation (but in reality is a very long thirty minutes) Dean says fuck it and settles on his nice dark wash jeans and green Henley, with his canvas jacket. Top it off with his nice boots, some hair gel, and he thinks it's is as good as it's gonna get.
By the time he pulls into the parking lot of the coffee shop, he's annoyed and slightly pissed at what he's sure is his correct assumption.
Nervously, Dean fidgets while he waits. He knows people's eyes are on him because of the scene he caused, but he has to do this. It's the right thing to do.
"What's wrong, Dean?" he heard. He looked over to find Cas standing in the doorway, wearing the clothes hed given him.
Reluctantly, Dean drags himself out of bed. If he could just stay there all day, until he has to get ready, he would. But alas, he is an adult and has to do adulty things: chores, laundry, and grocery shopping, which takes the whole morning and part of the afternoon.
As they wandered the room, Dean could feel Cas' eyes on him. He was watching him, making sure he was enjoying himself.
Dean tensed up a bit, and Cas noticed. He pulled back slightly, a concerned look on his face. "What happened?"
"I didn't sleep with him. I didn't. I was just so upset. I saw your laptop open and you were looking at apartments and I thought you were going to move out so I went and got drunk and he was just there. I didn't want him, I
This caused Dean to stop laughing, as he looked into Cas serious face. He watched as Cas' face broke into a grin, causing him to smile too. "Damnit Cas." Dean said, shaking his head and laughing again.
"You know damn well who it is. And by your reaction, you knew and you purposely didn't tell me. What the fuck, Gabriel?!"
A tear slides down Dean's cheek as a blinding smile spreads across his face. "Yes" he says, pulling Cas even closer and pressing their lips together. "I love you too."
"Cas" Dean breathes out when Cas' hand runs softly up over his cock, now fully hard. Cas presses a kiss to the back of his neck, and wraps his hand around Dean, and Dean grinds back against Cas, eliciting a soft moan into his neck.
Dean shook his head. "No. I mean, it was. I thought it was at least. I dont know Cas. Clearly, it's not a problem for my body." Dean thust his hips up slightly, pushing his hardness against Cas.
Gulping down air, he braced his hand on the building. The buzz from the liquor was fading, probably due to the adrenaline, and he realized what he'd done.
The nurse leaves him at the door, and he peeks around the curtain. Claire is laying in the bed with Emma on one side and Dean on the other. Dean's arm is around her, and she's curled into his side with her eyes closed, and Emma and Dean are both looking at the tv.
And that feels... okay. It's not bad, but it's also not great, just like this whole damn night. Asa's touch has done absolutely nothing for him other than make his hand too warm, and he kind of wants to pull it away but that's ridiculous because they're on a date and this is what people do.
Dean looked down at his hands. He was so used to being dirty, he didnt even think about it. He looked back up at the clothes. "I don't even know if those fit."
He and Dean have been seeing each other for several months now; four, to be exact. It's been wonderful, amazing, everything Cas has ever wanted in a relationship. He thrives when he's in Dean's presence, and feels the loss when he's not, and he's been seriously considering asking Dean to move in.
Dean looks up at him, and he looks angry. "What the hell is that?" Dean asks, pointing at the new chicken enclosure with the mallet in his hand.
Cas sets his phone down and flops backward onto the bed, letting out a breath. This is a nightmare. Just drop it off and leave, that's it. No more.
Once they're in, and have it settled against the wall, Dean looks around. It's Cas' workshop. A large open building with tools hanging on one wall, paint and supplies against another, and what seems like random things everywhere. It smells like oil, and acetone, and
Dean nods to him, just once, like he used to do back when Cas had first started bringing his found objects onto the bus, and Cas turns and pushes the clock down the aisle to the center facing seats.
"Hey." Sam said. "I told her to reel herself in, otherwise she wouldve pounced on you by now." He glanced at Courtney.
Slowly, Dean pulled his hand out of Cas' pants, as he looked down into Cas' face. Dean wiped his hand on the side of his pants, and pressed his forehead against Cas', staring into his eyes.
Cas shifts around, wanting to ask so bad what happened. He's sure it wasn't the same as his situation, from the comment Dean had made the day before.
He watches Dean dig in the fridge for bottles, then sets two of them on the island. Dean takes a drink from one, and looks at Cas, then looks away like he can't stand it.
When they come into the kitchen, Charlie tells them she has a surprise planned and to get dressed, and within 10 minutes they're all gone and Dean is left alone with Cas standing in the foyer.
He slides back up Dean's body, tasting Dean's skin again as he goes. Grabbing a pillow, he props Dean's hips up, and Dean slips his hand behind Cas' neck, pulling him into a heated kiss.
Speaking into his hands, Cas finishes. "I've never been with anybody. I've never dated or even tried to date." He drops his hands again but doesn't look up. "I never intended on being with anybody before I-" he cuts himself off, biting his lip. He knows that Dean knows he wanted to die, but saying it now, after everything, it just doesn't seem right.
Dean slowly walked over to him, and reached his hand out, placing it on Cas' arm. "This is amazing." He said.
He can't stop his hands from running over every inch of Dean he can reach, and when Dean pulls Cas' shirt off, Cas reaches down to do the same. Their naked torsos press together and Cas never wants to forget the feeling. He digs his nails into Dean's waist and presses against him harder, grinding their bodies together until he can feel every single hard inch of Dean against him.
He forced his feet to keep moving. Dean hadn't seen him yet, so Cas peeled his eyes off of him and looked around. Charlie, the computer teacher, and resident hacker extraordinaire, was sitting next to Dean's brother Sam. There was Benny, the home ec teacher, Garth the guidance counselor, and Kevin from the math department.
He internally sighs, guilt washing over him yet again. "I know you're unhappy we had to move, and I'm sorry. I just really want you to try to settle in. I don't plan on us moving again any time soon."
Taking them both in hand, Cas begins to slide his hand along them, dicks wet with spit and prerelease, the silky feeling of Cas' cock against his making Dean thrust his hips up, clutching onto Cas' biceps. It feels so good, too good, and Dean knows he won't last long. Cas is amazing, twisting his wrist just right, the pressure perfect. Dean wraps his hand around their lengths on the other side, pumping along with Cas', and Cas' head falls back on a moan.
Every single time, people stare at him, and every damn time the man ignores the looks, glances at Dean in the mirror, half smiles, and that's it.
It's so reminiscent of the way he woke up yesterday that it sends a sharp pain through Dean's chest. "Call Bobby and tell him I'm sick," Dean replies, before burying his face back into the pillow.
Cas huffed, and went to push past Dean, but he wobbled a little. He felt Dean's hands close around his arms, and straightened up. "Careful" Dean said.
It's in that moment that Cas realizes he's so completely gone on Dean that there's no coming back from it. He's never felt this way. It's terrifying and exhilarating and astonishing.
"No." Cas responded. "You dont get paid. I told a random woman what you do for no money." Dean started laughing again. Oh god Cas was so damn adorable, and he didnt even realize it.
Pulling away, Dean says, "I can't do this right now," but Cas grabs at him again and Dean whirls around so quickly, Cas drops his hand and takes a step back. "What?" Dean almost shouts. He lowers his voice when Cas flinches. "What?"
"Cancelling? Yeah, you should've just texted. Not like I don't get it, just wish I would've known before I drove here." He feels embarrassed and ridiculously sad over something that just wasn't meant to happen.
"I do. Just figured it would give you something to do, other than watch me sleep." Dean chuckled a little, the thought of Cas just sitting there watching him sleep was making him both nervous and a little excited down below.
Dean leaned over to the side then, reaching into the drawer of the nightstand and pulling out a bottle. He handed it to Cas, and Cas took it willingly.
He finally drags himself back out of bed and grudgingly pulls on a pair of jeans and a tshirt. No reason to dress nice, he's not even going to see the man. Even if he was, he'd still have no reason to dress nice, at least that's what he tells himself.
Flopping back in his chair in front of the laptop, Dean pulls up the program he uses and the current reports. Cas is standing behind him and to the side a bit, watching over his shoulder. He's actually really fucking close, so close Dean can feel the heat coming off of him along his back, and it's making him twitchy.
"You should sleep." Cas says. Dean makes an agreeable noise, and Cas can feel him waning in his arms.
"You won't" Cas says into his skin, then kisses back up until their lips are together again. He grips Dean's hips and turns him around, backing him toward the bed. "You never will." Cas reassures, as his hands slide up under Dean's shirt, feeling his soft warm skin under his fingers.
He's exhausted. His eyes hurt, his body is tired, he still feels like utter shit, and he wants Dean. Wants to be in his arms, comforted by him, but he can't bring himself to pick up the phone. Instead, he sinks down further into the couch and closes his eyes.
Dean reached both hands up, and ripped the buttons of Cas' shirt open, exposing his chest. Dean's mouth explored down, kissing over Cas' collarbone and chest.
Packing up his tools, he looks around. The work should only take a few more days. He can get a lot done tomorrow, but will have to wait until next weekend to finish. One more week, and he probably won't ever see Cas again, and that thought almost brings him to tears.
Dean's worked most of the day. All of the posts are in, and he has maybe a fourth of the actual fence built. His body is sore and he's tired and his anger has been worn off for way too long.
"Mornin' Cas." Dean says, then turns the stove off and pours another cup of coffee and adds cream and sugar. He puts it into Cas' hands, and steers him to the table.
Dean fried up some bacon, then cracked a couple of eggs into the grease, popping bread down in the toaster while they fried. Once it was all done, he put them on a plate, and sat down at the table across from Cas.
Sitting down on the edge of his bed, he put his socks and boots on, lacing them up. He didnt really have 'nice' shoes, but these would be fine. They werent that dirty.
"Dean, I'm not going to change my mind" Cas stated. "I've walked this earth for so many millenia and have never had this feeling, until now. Until you." Cas turned his eyes towards the floor. "After everything though, I cant help but worry about the next time you decide I'm dead to you."
"Ah, yeah. I keep them on hand for Sam, he's a health freak. But the way I make them, even I think they're alright." Claire makes an agreeable noise.
The phone goes straight to voicemail again, and Cas growls as he slams his phone down on the couch next to him. He's tried calling Dean all night, and after the first couple times it was clear that Dean turned his phone off.
He slowly made his way over to the group, and his heart started hammering, instant regret swallowing him as he watched Dean lean over to Anna and whisper something into her ear.
Cas sits down on the couch, and contemplates how in the hell his life has come to this, sitting on Dean's couch, watching Dean's TV, with Dean's (and his own) daughter, while Dean is cooking in the other room.
Cas stopped. He didn't want to come, not here. He unfisted himself, and pulled his hand out of his pants, resting it on the table.
Emma squeals her delight. "Yes, thank you daddy! I'm gonna go call her." She jumps up and runs out of his home office.
They're carrying the TV wordlessly between them, and Dean's only a little breathless because the fucker really is heavy, but just being in Cas' presence again is doing things to him.
After settling on a time for Cas to drop Claire off the next day, they all say their goodbyes and head their separate ways, and Dean, for once, feels content with how that went.
Dean is incoherent and shaking, nails digging into Cas' biceps, and Cas is so fucking close to losing it when Dean throws his head back in pleasure, come spurting out all over his stomach, yelling Cas' name, and Cas let's go, thrusts in a couple more times and he's coming inside Dean. It's the most intense orgasm of his life.
By the time Charlie gets there, Dean's worried he's about to be in full blown panic attack mode he's worked himself up so much. She ushers him outside without a word, parks him on the swing, then disappears back into the house reappearing a few minutes later with some tea. He hates tea, but it's usually effective so he drinks it.
Dean's laughter died down, and he shook his head. "I may have asked for help too. This" Dean waved his hand at his clothes. "She picked them out. I was... a little nervous about this, and didnt know what to wear."
Laying down on the couch, Cas pulls the throw blanket from the back and covers himself with it. Fuck it, if Dean's not coming then he's going to lay on the couch the rest of the day and feel sorry for himself. He'll pull it together tomorrow and get back to work, but for today he gets to sulk.
and adorable and perfect. Tears prickle his eyes, and he doesn't know what to say. Cas believes in him this much?
"Fu- Cas, yes. Please." Dean begs, as one of Cas' hands slide into his hair, fingers tightening, pulling Dean's head to the side to get a better angle on his neck. The other hand moves down Dean's body, stopping at the hem of his shirt, fingers grazing warm skin.
Cas grabbed the waist of Dean's sweat pants and boxers, and slid them down, pulling them off and tossing them to the floor.
"Seriously? What the hell?" Dean says, because he knew they had that flavor and always scoffed at it because tea and ice cream? Gross.
Cas' arms are around him then, and he's crying into Cas' chest, tears staining his shirt. Dean hasn't cried in a long time, not really, not like this. And now that it's started, he doesn't know how to make it stop.
Cas takes a deep breath, then another. He presses his face harder against Dean's chest so his voice is muffled when he speaks. "Do you want any of that? Living together, marriage, kids?" His voice hitches as he says the words.
Dean tries to interrupt, say that it was his fault because he should've said something sooner. Maybe Gordon would've backed off, or he could've just left before it got out of control. Cas holds up a hand to stop him before he can start.
She agrees, and they head outside so he can make the phone call. Charlie says the girls decided to head home and that they weren't upset at all and that they'd for sure do it again another time. Dean tells her that's good because Emma insisted they stick around so he has no idea when they'll be home. Charlie makes knowing noises and Dean hangs up before she can say anything.
Unable to stop himself, Cas cries into her shoulder for a long time. He cries until they're all dried up again and he can get out more than "I'm sorry."
There's really not much Dean can do. He can call dispatch, and the police, and that's pretty much it. He shouldn't have physically removed the man the other day, and he's lucky he didnt get fired for that. He can't risk it again.
Feeling his face heat up in embarrassment, Dean shifts around again. "Ah, alright. Well I feel stupid now. I'm still sorry though. Nobody deserves to be treated that way."
He texts Dean about it, and Dean says she's definitely welcome and that it'll just be Claire and Emma because he doesn't want to overwhelm her with too much activity, and they can do a big sleepover again another night, and Cas is thankful for that, because it's one less thing to worry about. He says that if Cas isn't cool with it though, then "Emma and I have plans with my brother that I completely forgot about". Cas laughs at that, and as nice as the offer is, he doesn't take it and agrees to let Claire go.
Dean sidled up behind Cas, getting very close before he leaned around him and set his plate next to the sink.
Dean's decided that he'll finish the fence, and that'll be it. He'll leave Cas alone and accept that this is over. That the only person he's ever loved is just done with him. He should've expected it, really. People don't stick around for him, why would they? He's a useless bus driver with nothing to offer but himself. It was doomed from the beginning.
It's perfect for them, close to Dean's work, and close to the school where Cas decided to pursue his masters degree. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs, a half bathroom and an office space on the first floor. Along with a spacious living room where a wall of windows looks out onto the backyard, and a modern kitchen where Dean, and Cas now, can cook, it's exactly what Cas wanted.
"Were you aware" Cas says in a quiet voice, leaning over the counter a bit. "That Dean Winchester lives here?"
"Come in." Dean said unhappily. "What is so damn important Sam?" He asked, as Sam walked into the room.
Dean leaned down and pressed another kiss to Cas' lips before kissing his way down Cas' abdomen once again.
They've finished eating, and they're waiting on the check. Cas is digging into his jacket pocket on the bench seat next to him, for his wallet and Asa is saying something about not wanting the night to end yet when Cas feels his phone vibrate against his hand. He pulls it out of his jacket and checks it and there are five missed calls and several voicemails from Dean.
His heart was pounding hard now, as he looked out to find Dean slowly making his way back to their table, the words bad idea still racing through his mind, shrouded by the cover of liquid courage.
"Shuddup" Dean says, but he's grinning too as he turns back to his own ice cream, which is actually a little disappointing when he takes a bite now that he's had Cas'.
"Maybe I will someday" she responded, digging in. She looked over at Cas, who didnt have a plate in front of him. "You not hungry?"
As Dean watched out the windshield, a clearing came into view. Cas eased the car into it, and parked. They were at the edge of a cliff, overlooking nothing but forest beneath and sky above.
Cas takes Dean's suggestion, and heads to Singer's the next morning after getting Claire off to school and consuming copious amounts of caffeine.
He just ruined everything. He had to get out of there. Cas pushed himself off the wall, and got two steps away when he heard "Cas, wait."
Fern Guy stands, bends over and scoops up something into his arms, then climbs on the bus. He's holding something very large and square, but its covered in a sheet.
Its Thursday night, and he and Dean are supposed to go out tomorrow after his shift. He's wondering if that's even going to happen now.
After months of watching the strange blue eyed man lug things on and off his bus, he's finally going to get to know him. Though he has an idea of what Cas is like, based on their interaction the night before, he still can't wait to spend more time learning about him.
Claire rolls her eyes at him from the bed, phone pressed to her ear. "Hang on a sec." She says into the phone, before looking at her dad. "Yes, dad. Come in. What?" She says, voice laced with sarcasm.
They've stopped walking, and Cas is looking everywhere but at Dean. "I had a good time." Cas says, and he sounds sincere, but it doesn't make Dean feel any better.
"No, you're not doing anything wrong. Theres something wrong with me. I'm trying so hard to control this, but at times it creeps in before I know what's happening." Dean replied.
In the afternoon of the third day, Dean was once again in his bed, a mostly empty bottle of liquor next to him.
Dean reached across the table and took ahold of Cas' hand. "You dont have to be sorry. None of this is your fault. It's my problem, my hang ups. It's something I'm gonna have to work through. But please, dont give up on me."
Cas is looking at him with bewilderment again. "Dean, you don't have to do that. I'm sure I can get it."
This is everything Cas has always wanted, and never knew he could have. He will do everything he can to never fuck this up again, because now that he's had it, he doesn't think he can live without it.
"What're you working on?" Dean asks, because Cas' workshop has always looked the same so this must be a big project.
Dean had almost, almost, forgotten about what had happened to make him end up here in the first place. He lost his smile, turned back to the bar, and took a gulp of his drink, finishing it and waving for another.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed, and Dean knew he'd won. "Awesome. My turn to get the drinks, be right back."
"Nothing." Cas says, pushing the feelings down. "I just want to sleep." He continues on to his room, but Dean grabs his hand, turning him back around.
As Cas continued to rub Dean's shaft through his pants, he moved his mouth down, finding there wasnt nearly enough skin for his mouth to explore. He then grabbed Dean's tshirt with his teeth, and pulled until it ripped all the way down, exposing every inch of Dean's torso.
"You're fucking amazing" Dean says, and Cas can see the sincerity of his words in Dean's eyes. "You go shower first, then I will."
Cas looked around. "Class? Dean, theres no-" he looked back at Dean's face, shaking his head. "Nevermind. I... I'd like to surprise you, if that's okay."
As he entered the kitchen and walked towards the coffee maker, he saw a movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned towards the table, noticing Dean sitting there with his head lowered.
"Yes Dean, research. Now if you'd kindly go back to what you were doing so I can finish, that would be nice." Cas looked so serious.
Cas caught the clothes and looked at them. It was another pair of plaid pajama pants, these ones black and white, and a black t-shit.
Cas looked up at Dean, who was looking at him with a look of pure amusement on his face. "No, thank you" he said.
"Its hard to explain." Dean answered, taking a bite. He glanced up at her and could see a confused look on her face.
"No choice? What the hell?" Dean says, on the irritated side. He's embarrassed and feels gross thanks to his faceplant, and that tends to come out as angry in him.
It peaks, and pleasure washes over Cas as he comes, intense and like nothing he's ever experienced. His vision whites out, a guttural moan forces itself out of his throat, and he's just holding on, thrusting his hips, riding through it. He feels Dean's hands clamp down on him, bruising as he tenses up beneath him, and then Dean is moaning, saying Cas' name over and over again, and it's the best thing he's ever heard, he's ever felt.
Dean smiles. His thirteen year old daughter is his world, but kids at this age are so mean. Emma is so much like her dad, she enjoys older movies, and music from before Dean was even born. She loves old cars, and spends weekends going to car shows with her dad. She'd rather spend her free time under the hood of a car than at the mall like most girls her age. All of these things add up to her not having very many friends. It breaks Dean's heart, but Emma never seems to care.
Unable to process what he'd just done, Dean grabbed his coat and keys, and walked out of his room. Cas was still standing outside his door, so Dean rushed past him and down the hall toward the garage, not saying a word.
Cas grabs ahold of Dean's arm and turns him back. "Please, tell me what happened. Why is your face bruised?" Cas asks, fingertip lightly grazing Dean's cheek, concern still evident on his face.
"You feeling okay after that?" Dean asks, and his concern about Cas' wellbeing makes him care for Dean even more than he already does.
Panting, and trying again Cas said "Dean" and put a little pressure to his hands, which were now on Dean's chest.
"This is your second reprimand for unprofessional behavior in the last week. I need you to sign this written warning."
"You didnt have to... So, we had a few more drinks last night. We got to talking. One thing led to another. It's not a big deal." Sam said, trying to act cool.
It's 12:30, the girls have been in Emma's room all morning, and Dean figures they've got to be getting hungry, because he sure is. He collects all the ingredients for burgers, and is just mixing the spices into his meat mixture when the doorbell rings.
Dean wrapped his other hand around Cas' waist, pulling him against him. Cas relaxed even further, and moved his hands to rest on Dean hips once again.
Cas wakes up feeling horrible. He'd gone home and gone to bed the night before, just like he said he was going to, but he didn't sleep. Instead, he'd spent almost the entire night tossing and turning and thinking about what had happened.
Once he's sitting back on his couch, he twirls his phone in his hand. He needs somebody to tell him how to fix this, because he's out of ideas. Without thinking, he scrolls through his contacts until he gets to Charlie and hits send. She's always been closer to Dean than Cas, but Cas just needs somebody to talk to.
Giddy excitement, appreciation, and more love come pouring out of Dean's chest. "God, you're amazing." He says, pulling Cas to him. "If I didn't already love you more than anything, this would do it."
"You heard me." Cas says, pressing their bodies back together so Dean can feel that he's already half hard.
"Disappeared after Sammy moved out. Died a few years later, alcohol poisoning." Dean looks down at the table, picking at a spot in the wood. "I used to think people vanishing on me was my punishment for what happened." He says quietly.
As Dean drove them back to the bunker, he pulled Cas against his side. This had been the perfect evening, and he never wanted it to end.
So he does what he always does when he doesn't know what to do, he distances himself from the situation.
"I'm sorry Dean. I know my reaction was unreasonable, and I will try to control myself in the future" he said.
Cas decided to just go to his room, and hopefully make it through the next few hours until Dean got up and he could get his clothes.
"Oh" Cas is struck speechless. Dean wants him, he wants to be with him, and he's so kind and considerate and Cas doesn't know what to do with that.
Too fast? Cas has been waiting seventeen years to have Dean again, they couldn't be slower if they'd tried. He wants him, more than he's ever wanted anything, and he's going to have him.
The feeling of pure pleasure that traveled through Cas' body at Dean's touch was completely new to him. He unintentionally bucked his hips up, throwing his head back.
Cas shrugged. "I dont know. It just seems so... What's the phrase you always use? Chicken flick? And you dont like that."
As they're eating, Emma is talking to Claire, and he and Dean are just enjoying the evening, but Cas starts to pay attention when he hears a few words that Emma is saying.
"Good" Dean says, a beautiful smile on his face. "Me too." Dean's arms come around him, and Cas' do the same, holding onto each other. "Do you think-" Dean starts, but he hesitates.
"Yeah I have no idea. I put her back in the coop, the others are still there, and I locked it up for you."
"Oh, and I'm sure daddy can get an extra desk in his office so you can just work from here." Emma says to Cas, and Cas looks to Dean again. He can feel his eyes widen, gaze flicking back and forth between the three other people at the table, but Dean still isn't saying anything, still doesn't look up from his food.
He's still sitting there sometime later, cold breakfast forgotten in front of him as he stares down at the wood. He hears the slider open and Dean peeking his head in.
"It's okay. You have other things to do, other people to hang out with. It's not your fault, it's mine." It hurts to say, but he knows it's true.
Several minutes and another knock later, there's been no answer and the chicken is sitting on his foot. Dean double checks the their texts, then the clock. He's now officially late, but he was there at the right time. He shoots a text to Cas, in case maybe he just didnt hear the door, but still no answer.
The woman waved down Scott, putting 2 fingers up. He came over and poured the amber liquid into Dean's glass, then set another on the bar and filled it as well.
Cas looks at the time then looks back at him. "It's very early." He says, and his voice is low and quiet like he's been sleeping, which he probably had been pretty recently, and it pulls at Dean's heart.
Once he introduces himself, Ellen tells him that Dean's already told her all about him and he's got the job if he wants it. They discuss basics, and she tells him to come back in a few days to sign some papers. Once again, within a half an hour, he's back in his truck in shock.
When Dean raises his head, rubbing his eyes, Cas can't help but think how adorable he is and how thankful he is for him, and that same something from before bubbles inside his chest again before he squashes it back down.
Cas wakes slowly from his doze, and stares down at the top of Dean's head. He's warm and fulfilled, couldn't be happier.
"I've never had sex before." He blurts out, refusing to look up to see the disgust that's probably on Dean's face. "I've never even kissed anybody until today. I'm sorry." He feels so ashamed, and can feel his cheeks heating in embarrassment. Why would Dean, who's so experienced, who knows what he's doing, knows exactly how to make a person feel good, ever want to be with someone like him?
"Language, Claire. And I don't care, I'm not sending my child into a house with people I've never met."
Unable to hold back anymore, Cas let go. He felt his sweet release travel through his entire body, as his cum shot down Dean's throat.
Out of sight, Dean's heart rate started to increase. Cas was worried he was going to have a melt down. Shit.
Gently, Cas removes the rest of Dean's clothes, and takes in the sight of Dean spread naked underneath him. It is so beautiful, he is so beautiful, and Cas tells him, between kisses to his body.
On the first day, after Dean had wandered around the bunker looking for him to no avail, he retreated to his room, and his liquor supply, pounding through an entire bottle before noon.
"I'm sorry." Dean hears himself say. He says it again, and again with no idea what exactly he's apologizing for. For being a failure? For not sucking it up and signing the damn paper? For being such a fucking loser that he did nothing with his life? For crying on him? Who the fuck knows, he just knows he's sorry.
Cas finally loosens his grip for Dean to pull back, and Dean is sliding the ring onto his finger. Dean is grinning at him, and Cas can feel a huge smile on his own face as he leans forward and kisses Dean.
Dean was halfway through washing the dishes when he felt a hand on his back, and jumped, turning around to Cas just inches from him. "Damnit Cas, wear a damn bell." He said.
Dean just nods and gives a tight smile. He's ready to dig in, because he's starving, but that would be rude so he waits until Gordon's order comes back, passing the time talking. Gordon finishes up his story about his hunting trip, which really is not funny, even though Gordon's loud laugh would indicate otherwise. Dean chuckles lightly along, so as not to be rude, but honestly the story was quite tasteless, and on the verge of sexist.
"Ah, yes" Cas says, a bit nervously. "All the wood we've been working on? It's all going to build you your own workshop, on the other side of the yard. I'm not very good with that kind of thing, so I was hoping you'd help me with it."
"Thanks Char. Talk to you later." He says, before hanging up. Dean glares at the bright screen as the call ends, and sees a message. Assuming it's from Charlie, he opens it.
Cas shrugs. "You never texted me back today." He looks away. "It's alright, if you're too busy, or you're seeing someone else." He really didn't mean to say that, but his sleep muddled brain isn't working at full capacity yet, and he's tired of wondering. He just needs to know, and be done with it.
"Hello. Nice to meet you" Courtney said, still staring at Sam. Suddenly she burst out laughing, doubling over to hold her stomach. After a minute, she stood up, wiping tears from her eyes. "Oh my god, I'm so sorry. You just look so serious!"
"Itll be fine Dean. We have Jack, and Cas. We can do this." Sam said, grabbing himself a small drink as well.
"You are so beautiful, and you're mine." Cas says, hands running up Dean's thighs, fingers playing at the edge of the panties. He can see Dean swallow and close his eyes, hands fisting the sheets.
Cas ate them up, shoving his tongue back into Dean's mouth. Dean had both his hands on Cas' hips now, pulling him down against him over and over again.
He set the glass back on the desk and turned around. Cas was standing right in front of him. He'd redressed himself and come over, and Dean hadnt even heard him move.
Cas sought out a table to work at, and Dean very pointedly took his books and sat down directly next to him to his left, while Sam sat at a table on the other end of the room.
Before Dean knows what's happened, the man straightens up, whips around, and punches him square in the face. Dean reels back, hand going to his cheek where the pain is flaring from, other hand clenched in a fist.
Cas spends the whole drive back from the diner not, for once, thinking about Dean. His mind is on the waiter, Asa. He hasn't been that blatantly hit on in a very long time, especially with his daughter there.
He settles in, mentally cataloguing everything he needs to do to the clock, what materials he has, what he'll need to pick up. By the time he has his list fully formed in his head, his stop is coming up.
Cas wound his right hand up into Dean's hair, and used his left to pull Dean's body even closer to his own.
"Oh no you dont." Sam said. He picked up the bottle and poured some more into Dean's glass. "You're not dropping that bomb and then escaping."
"Yeah, Jody is great. There's another one, too; Patience. Shes about the same age, and has been with Jody about a year now. They'll both be at Emma's sleepover next weekend." Dean says before shoving a bite of his ice cream in his mouth. It's half melted by now, but still fucking delicious and he can't help the pleased sound that comes out.
"Again, what the fuck Gabriel?!" Cas is upset, and annoyed, and all around pissed about this situation.
"I see that." Cas says, his voice lower, completely against his will. "I'll see you later." He tears his eyes away from Dean.
Cas had regretting answering the call the second he heard that beautiful voice, and he was regretting it more with every passing second.
"Oh, yes. We could... do that some more. If you'd like" Cas responded, his face falling almost inconceivably.
"Well go finish your talk. Sorry I interrupted, I thought you'd gone to his room. Tell you what, I'll run out and grab some food." Sam stated, taking a sip of coffee and setting the mug down. "Tell Dean I ran out and I'll be back with food. And that I know 'dont forget pie.'" Sam said, in a mock Dean tone. Sam smiled, turned around, and left the kitchen.
Cas puts the truck in park, and Emma squeals. "Oh my god, Charlie's here!" She says, and Cas' head whips over to look at the porch, where Dean is sitting on the swing with a petite redheaded woman. "You have to meet her!"
Dean climbed into Cas' lap, straddling him as he deepened the kiss further, exploring every inch of Cas' mouth.
"Just stop, Dean. I dont want to hear excuses." Cas looked into Dean's face then, and Dean could see his resolve crumbling. "I kissed you, and you kissed someone else. Its clear how you feel. I am not a woman, and I should have known you would react that way. I shouldn't have kissed you. Its who you are, and its fine. I just cant be around you right now." Cas started to turn away.
By the time he's walking into the emergency room, he's a frazzled mess and is just barely holding it together. He tells the nurse at the desk that his daughter's here, and she leads him back to a room in the emergency department.
They silently head up the stairs and into Cas' room, and when he turns back Dean looks nervous. As much as he wants this, wants Dean, if he's not ready then Cas will wait. He'll wait as long as it takes, because Dean is worth it.
As he entered the kitchen, he saw Cas just standing at the sink with the water running, his hands resting on the sink's edge.
"Well, what I wanted to say was hell yeah, but I thought that might come off as a little enthusiastic. So, okay." Dean says, his own smile tugging at his lips.
Dean moaned and thew his head back. He closed his eyes and felt the most amazing hot wet feeling envelope his straining cock.
"Okay," Cas says quietly, overwhelmed with how understanding Dean is. His insides are warm, and he really wants to kiss Dean again. "Can we do that now?" He asks.
"Okay. Well I'm busy right now." Cas says, reaching for the door again. He's curious, but the pain is still too real. It hurts, the hole in his chest still aches, and seeing Dean is making it so much worse. He just wants to curl up in a ball and cry again.
Dean had never felt anything this good in his life. He never wanted it to end. He could feel the pull in his stomach and knew he was close.
Dean hasn't seen Cas since they dropped dinner by on Sunday night, and he doesn't like it. He's dropped a few things by their house, just onto the porch, and had Emma let Claire know. He knows Cas has been busy, and just doesn't want to bother him.
That gets Dean's attention, as he sits up quickly looking around for the time. He snatches his phone off the table and groans to himself as he bolts off the couch and into his room to get dressed.
"No, there's not. There's nothing wrong with saving yourself. Though now I feel like even more of an asshole for attacking you like that." Dean says, dropping his hand from Cas' face.
It feels amazing, Cas' fingers digging into his back, and Dean sets to work tasting every part of Cas his lips can reach, down his chest, over his nipples, and down to his navel, sucking a mark into his prominent hipbone. When Dean reaches his groin, he licks into the crease, and Cas bucks up beneath him, body trembling as Dean's hands slide down his thighs and back up, barely skimming along his cock.
Ellen is a woman probably in her fifties with graying hair and a sharp but motherly voice, who's arguing with a blonde woman behind the bar when Cas walks in.
Dean pulled his face back, as far as he could. "Cas" he panted out. Cas attacked his mouth once again, shoving his tongue inside.
As Cas moves to get out, Dean suddenly doesn't want to leave yet. Just another minute. "Hey" when Cas stops and turns back to him, Dean scrambles to think of something to say. "If, uh... If you ever need help with anything, you can call me. I don't live too far from here, and I have a truck. She's old, but she gets the job done." He says, really unsure of why he made the offer but not taking it back because he means it. If Cas asked for his help, he'd absolutely be there, but he's not even sure why he feels that way.
Dean's stomach growled. He took a deep breath and dug in, eating every bite on his plate. When he was finished, he looked up at Sam, now sitting across from him. "Thanks Sammy."
He looks back at Dean and can see the open honesty and hurt in his eyes. "I get it, I do. I'm a mess, I don't remember things, and get caught up. I've tried to be better, but-" he can feel tears prickling his eyes, and now is not the time for that. He's just so tired. Physically, emotionally. He's tired of losing people because he loses himself. Cas rubs his eyes again. "I can't."
Reaching into his pocket, Cas can feel himself shaking as his fingers close around the box he's hidden for months, waiting for just this moment. He slowly pulls it out, and watches Dean's eyes go wide as he registers what Cas is holding.
Satisfied with that, Cas' mouth made it's way down Dean's neck to his chest. Tracing the hard lines with his tongue, Cas could feel Dean becoming increasingly desperate against him.
The kiss ends slowly, until they're just lazily pressing their lips together. When Cas finally pulls back enough to see Dean, Dean has a blissed out happy look on his face.
"Yes" Gordon says, looking at the menu. "I'll have the ribeye, rare. Instead of the garlic mashed potatoes, I'll have a baked potato, and instead of the asparagus I'll take a house salad, Italian dressing on the side."
Or, he could use them to his advantage. If Dean wanted to tease, maybe Cas could do something back to him.
Cas is speechless. He believes him, how could he not with the proof right here. He didn't sleep with someone else. He has a panty fetish, which, if Cas is being honest with himself, is actually quite a turn on. Though he understands why Dean would be embarrassed about it, he wishes he'd have told him.
Cas knows a string of incoherent noises are leaving his mouth, but he can't stop. It feels so good, so amazing, so
On Friday, Cas comes to the shop and Dean spends some time showing him his system and what work needs done. Cas sets it up so once hes input all the information, he can access it from his own computer at home so he doesn't need to be in the shop all the time occupying Dean's computer. Which, really Dean wouldn't mind if he did, because having Cas around is always pleasant, but he gets that the man wants to work from his own home.
As soon as the bus pulls up, Dean is bounding up the steps and down the aisle to Cas. They easily get the tv picked up and maneuver it down the steps, all while Benny's watching them with a curious eye. He's sure he'll get a text later asking what the hell he was doing, but he can't be bothered to care because Cas looks so happy that he actually followed through with what he said.
Dean remembered, Cas' face was the last thing he thought about before he lost himself to the darkness. He looked back over at Cas, who was now covered in his blood.
"No, Dean. Look at me!" Cas all but shouted. Dean stopped and looked at him. "I need to tell you something now... I'm sorry."
"Nuh uh. If I'm helping, then I'm actually helping. Show me what you have." She said, turning toward the door.
Cas looks over at the girls snuggled in the bed, then back at Dean and his look is so fond Dean almost can't handle it.
"It's okay," Cas says, forcing a smile he doesn't feel. "I understand. I just, I need some time alone." He does understand, but that doesn't make it hurt any less.
Cas looked over at Dean, staring into his eyes, and slowly leaned over and pressed their lips together.
It takes him a few moments of confusion before it registers what he's looking at. They're invoices and delivery schedules... for women's underwear. Cas flips through the pages, noting seven or eight of them, all different, all delivered to their house through the last several years.
"You ready?" Cas managed to croak out. He had to make sure that Dean was sure, but fuck it was hard not to just go for it.
Dean's only made to wait ten minutes this time before he's ushered back into Naomi's office. He doesn't wait for an invitation to sit down, just plops himself into the chair and stares blankly at his boss.
Dean watches as Gordon fills out a zero in the tip spot, signs the receipt, and closes the folder, and something snaps inside him.
Dean just stared at him. "I wanted to say what I had to say in person. Plus... I didnt think you'd message me back."
They hang out for over an hour, but when Gabriel shows up Dean insists they leave to give them some family time. Cas wants to tell him that they're family, because what is family but what Dean's been to them, but he doesn't and let's them go.
He didn't have anymore time to think though, as the chorus came up and he sang it. Then, Dean's voice started again.
Feeling confused and disappointed, Dean figures he'll try one more time then go home, so he knocks again. After a minute, his shoulders slump and he gives up.
Dean could feel Cas shaking. He held onto him and rolled them, so Cas was on his side next to Dean, his softening member pulling out.
Dean doesn't even know what to say at this point, watching as Gordon digs into his food. He should just leave, before things get worse, but he really is hungry, not having eaten since breakfast, and how much worse could it really get? He's already resigned to never speaking to this man again after tonight.
Dean rolled his hips as much as he was able to, with the small amount of space Cas was allowing him to move.
Dean pulled his head back an inch. "If you keep doing that, I'm not sure I can stop where this is going. And this is a public place."
Minutes later, a redheaded woman approaches their table. "Is there anything else I can get for you?" She asks. She's smiling, but Dean can read people well enough to know she's pissed and is putting on a good face.
Dean pulled into the parking lot of the diner, and eased Baby into a spot. He sat there for a moment, just staring at the building.
Dean handed over the cash in his hand, and leaned in, loudly whispering "thank you sexy." Dean sat back down in his seat hard, and let off a chuckle.
It takes a moment for his brain to even register what's happening. Fern Guy is on his stomach on the floor now, wedged half under a seat reaching for something. There are several chickens, fucking
Dean reached behind him, grabbing a washcloth and his shower gel, and squeezed a good bit onto the washcloth. Setting the bottle down, he stepped closer to Cas and ran the washcloth down one of his arms, then the other. Taking each of Cas' hands, in turn, and washing the blood off of them.
Sam shook his head and took another long drink. He set his glass on the table and said "you guys are ridiculous."
By the time Dean leaves the building and is back to his car, he's fuming. Fucking asshole douchebag, nothing better to do than complain when all Dean did was the right thing. He's so damn pissed that he barely remembers the drive home, in a fog of frustration and dispirit.
"Jack. Hello. What... Did you need something?" Cas asked, trying to catch his breath and act normal.
Dean's working him open slowly and gently, running his lips all along Cas' skin, tracing the line of his groin with his tongue, nosing at his hard cock. Cas wants more, needs more. He makes a whining noise and pushes down against Dean's fingers. "Please." He begs.
Cas can't take it anymore. He drops the papers and stands up, quickly walking around the table and pulling Dean to his feet.
"I'm not leaving" Sam said. "I dont know what's wrong, but I'm not gonna let you sit in here and kill yourself with alcohol poisoning." Sam walked further into the room.
Dean perused the menu, already knowing what he was going to order, and once the waitress came over, he said "double bacon cheeseburger with everything, extra onions."
She says that Dean was amazing. "Seriously dad, you should've seen him jump into action like a super hero." She says, and though she looks so tired she's talking with more enthusiasm than she normally does. "He just picked me right up and carried me down the stairs because I couldn't walk. And once we were here, he wouldn't leave my side. They tried to make him leave the room when they were figuring out what was wrong, but, okay don't get mad, but I told them he was my dad's partner. I didn't want to be alone, and it hurt so much, and they were gonna make him leave. I hope that's okay."
He's still not sure if Gabriel's telling the truth about Dean not knowing who he is, but he really hopes to god he is. The last thing he could ever need in his life is the two of them discussing him.
"Look, he doesn't know that I'm your brother. We never met back then, and he doesn't even know my last name. He just comes in here for coffee. And pie. Always with the damn pie. I only know who he is because of the shop name. Oh, and I'm kind of friends with his brother."
He takes care of Claire, and wonders why. He works, and wonders why. He does household chores, and cooks, and showers, and dresses, and sleeps, and wonders
"It was, but not everybody does the right thing." Cas is studying him again, his stare almost piercing through to Dean's soul, and Dean thinks again how gorgeous this man is, his eyes intense in their scrutiny. "Dean?"
Courtney took a deep breath. "Look, I didn't plan this. I mean, obviously, I didnt even know you had a brother. But, things happened. We're all adults. So... It happened." She shrugged, and took a drink.
"I'll just, uh, go grab the laptop bag." Dean says, standing quickly and rushing out of the kitchen into his office.
"Oh my god, this is weird." Emma says. "I was just telling Claire about this place today. I couldn't get rid of the craving until I had some." Emma says, looking innocent as ever.
Dean looked upset for just a second. Then it hit him, why does it matter? Cas and Sam were friends. Despite that he was his brother, he was probably the only other friend Cas actually had besides himself. Dean reached for Cas' hand. "Its alright. Let's grab some food." And Dean led them out of his room, toward the food.
Cas nods, and when Gordon waves his dismissive hand again, Cas rolls his eyes and turns away. Dean's pretty sure that Gordon doesn't see it, as he's not looked at their waiter one time since they sat down, but he calls Cas back to the table once again, and now Dean's getting really annoyed.
Cas smiled, and proceeded to pull Dean's flannel off his shoulders. Once that was discarded to the floor, he ran his hands up under Dean's tshirt. "This too" he said, as he pulled it up over his stomach. Dean helped to pull off the shirt, then laid his body down on top of Cas.
Cas chanced a sideways look at Dean, but he was still staring at the book in front of him, with a serious look of concentration on his face. He watched as Dean brought the index finger on his left hand up to his mouth, making a point to stick his tongue out and lick it, then use it to turn the page of his book. As he did this, he moved his right hand further up so the entire thing was covering Cas' crotch.
It feels like the breath has been punched out of him, and he's lightheaded as he stares out at the man standing on his front porch.
Dean gets a heartfelt thank you from the woman, more thank yous from the other passengers as they load up onto the new bus that's arrived to take them, and a thank you from the police for not just sitting idly by while someone was harassed. Dean knows he just did the right thing, but he appreciates that they appreciate him.
They both got out if the car, and started walking toward the large building. Dean could feel some nerves creeping in. Being on a date wasnt something that really ever bothered him, but being on a date with Cas was causing butterflies to swirl in his stomach.
He throws on the first clothes his hands touch, jeans and a tshirt, and pulls a hoodie over his head because it's gotta still be pretty chilly out this early in the morning.
Okay, who's he kidding. He checks the guy out whenever he gets the opportunity. Dude is hot, and he can't help himself. He's a professional though, so all he ever does is give the guy a polite nod to acknowledge his pass, and the guy takes a seat.
"What is it?" Dean asks, Cas just gives him a look so he takes some on his spoon and pops it into his mouth, and it's... really good. Like, really really good. Once he swallows, he says "what the hell is that? And how did I not know they had that here?"
Dean's words are comforting, so he just clings to him and listens, face pressed into Dean's shoulder, the rumble of his voice soothing.
So many thoughts were flying through Dean's head. 'I'm kissing him. So amazing. Mmm so good. So hot. Cas' skin. I want. Need more.' Dean gipped Cas' hips and pulled him down closer to himself, causing Dean to make a pleased noise.
Cas puts his hand over his face for a second, then drops it to his side. "Well, I guess it's oversharing hour, but I suppose you should know." He bites his lip again, and stares out at the chickens. "Stupid things mainly, like eating or sleeping. I just don't think about it. But, the biggest problem has been with past relationships. It's hard for someone else to understand. It's not that I don't care, or that other things aren't important, I just lose track of everything else when I'm 'in the zone' as my brother calls it."
"We werent having intercourse Sam, if that's what you think." Cas said, taking his own slice of the pie and picking at it. He didnt eat, but liked to join the brothers while they did. It made him feel more normal.
"Aww, don't be like that Cassie." Gabriel says, at the same time Dean says "Gabe's pretty harmless, once you get to know him."
Dean could feel butterflies ripping their way through his stomach. He was doing it, he was kissing Cas, and it felt amazing. He felt a small amount of panic, which he pushed deep down into himself, and deepend the kiss further, pulling Cas harder against him.
He didnt realize how much time had passed in silence, when Cas suddenly stood up. "I'm going to wash my plate" he said, giving Sam a look that said 'talk to him please'. Then he grabbed his plate and left the room.
The man was attractive, and very nice. And he didn't seem to have a problem with the whole 'I have a kid' thing, which is hard to come by, especially when your kid is a surly teenage girl.
Cas sinks down onto the couch and puts his head in his hands. How could he have fucked this up so badly? He knows he should've tried harder, but Dean kept insisting it was fine, that he was good with the way Cas worked. He shouldn't have listened. This is the same shit that's happened every time he's started seeing someone in the past, the only difference is that Dean genuinely never seemed to have a problem with it.
"Look, if you didn't feel it, that's fine." Dean says, angling his body away so Cas' hand drops. "But you could've at least let me give you a ride home. I mean, jesus, am I that bad that you feel like you have to take the bus to get away from me?"
Cas paused. "Jack's dead. Chuck's gone. You and Sam have each other." Cas turned halfway around and took one last look at Dean. "I think it's time for me to move on." Then he turned around and continued to walk away.
Cas sets the pen down and growls to himself. His fucking brother. He's the only one who knows where he's living, and he always has the worst timing.
They make their way to the door silently, and Cas feels vaguely like he's heading to his own execution, which is ridiculous. Okay new plan. Knock on the door, hand the bag over, and leave. Don't go inside, don't participate in small talk,
Claire nods, and Dean stands up and scoops her into his arms. She groans again. But wraps one arm around his neck while the other is still clutching her side.
Cas leans in more, and in a desperate attempt to feel more, he swings his leg over Dean until he's straddling his lap. He has a brief moment of panic that this is too much, but then Dean's hands grip his hips, and their lips meet again, and it's wonderful.
A man that Dean knows, very well. Michael, Cas' ex. The man who was almost the end of their friendship. The one who hated Dean so much that he took every opportunity to belittle him and make him feel worthless. The one who held Cas on such a short leash that, at one point in time, Dean and Cas didn't speak for months.
As he unbuckles, he looks over at her and she has a smug smile on her face. "Knock it off, and get out of the truck." He says, opening his own door and stepping out, bag in hand.
Cas looked up at him. "I am too, Dean." Then he looked back down into his coffee, as if it held all the answers of the universe.
Cas laughed a little, looking down at his hand still on Dean's. "Yes. That I was your boyfriend. We hardly even kissed."
Dean gestures at the two little co-conspirators. "The girls wanted to hang out tonight, and instead of just asking they tricked us into coming here." Dean says. "You can sit if you want." He adds.
It's a long while later, when Cas' shirt is soaked through, and they've both cried out everything they had, when Dean climbs off of him mumbling something about water and disappearing into the kitchen.
Taking the queue, Cas climbed up to his knees and swung one leg over Dean's lap again. Popping his mouth off Dean's, he kissed along his jawline to his neck, stopping there to suckle a mark into it.
The guy is moving it up onto the bus step by step, and when he finally hits the last one he pulls his pass out and flashes it at Dean. Doesn't say a fucking word about the giant plant he's dragging onto the bus, just shows his pass, turns, and pulls the fern down the aisle.
Dean's eyes flick up to his mirror and watches as the woman tries to stand up to move but is pushed back into her seat by one of the men as he laughs. He pulls over at his next stop, but doesn't open the doors. He pulls his seatbelt off, stands up and turns around.
Arms come around him, a face nuzzling into his neck as Michael says "Finally," and anger wells up in Cas. He whips around and pushes Michael away. "Get out," he growls into Michael's stunned face. It's not Michael's fault, not really. Well, it kind of is, but it's Cas' fault too for inviting him here. He doesn't know what he was thinking.
Emma hurries to Claire's side and hugs her gently, and they talk for a few minutes before Claire is calling Dean over to her. She reaches up and pulls him into a hug, telling him thank you for taking care of her, and when Dean hugs her back and tells her of course, any time she needs him he'll be there, Cas feels his chest fill and ache and he can't push it down this time, there's too much.
A couple of hours later, it was approaching time to go. Dean headed back into the library to find Cas, but when he walked in Cas wasnt in there.
Cas could feel the shots already chasing around the current alcohol in his bloodstream. He looked back up at Dean, and Dean was already staring into his eyes.
Dean's cock was right there, in front of him, and Cas couldn't resist anymore. He lowered his head, taking the tip of it in his mouth and swirling his tongue around it. Dean's hips bucked up as he whimpered, and Cas sank down, taking the rest of Dean's length into his mouth as he pushed a second finger into Dean. The taste exploded on Cas' tongue, and a moan forced it's way out of his chest that he was tasting Dean.
Dean straddles Cas as he slowly removes the dark blue tie and throws it somewhere in the room. He starts unbuttoning the shirt and moves it as far to the sides as he can. He has every intention for Cas to keep it on. He captures Cas’s lips in his own, and then begins to move down Cas’s body. He appreciates every beautiful little noise Cas makes.
Cas sighed as he untangled himself from the mess on the floor. “I can hand you the appropriate tools, Dean.” Cas wasn’t going to admit researching the various tools in the kit his niece made him buy, but he did at least have a working knowledge of what was in fact, what.
The four of them remained at the table, each one going over in their mind what they had just learned.
“I am very sorry I worried you. The location I was at somehow miraculously had no cell reception. Even in the local library.”
“Hum. You see, it is your mission to control the emotions that flood through her memories. Keep those of Castiel and disregard those of her husband. It is not difficult.”
“Hum?” Dean leans forward, and not so subtly this time places his hand on the small of Cas’s back since the professor is now standing and hovering over the table.
Dean scrambled through his cabinets to quickly grab Cas a Tupperware container for his slime before he went to get some towels to clean the man up.
? Oh, that was terrifying, do people with those horrendous inclinations sit on park benches? That was more so terrifying.
Chuck looks to them, his creations. Two species who were never meant to be in the same sphere for an extended period of time. And yet, here they were, unable to be separated for too long. It was a type of miracle in and of itself. And okay, yeah, so Chuck put them in front of each other several times, but they still had an element of free-will, and here they were, obviously so
Dean risks a glance at Chuck as he puts the breakfast dishes in the dishwasher, and yup, he’s mad at the smug son-of-a-bitch. Who just forgets a kid? He slams the dishwasher door closed and gets his book off the dining room table.
Dean had prepared all the boards so that they could be assembled when the back panel dried. He decided to dovetail the joints so the bookcase would be more artistic than utilitarian. And because he was Dean Winchester making a piece of furniture for Castiel Novak, he decided to place a decorative hand-carved molding around the top of the shelf.
“And do you think I don’t know you would’ve saved those kids if you didn’t have to regrow all the parts of you that gave a damn? I know you Cas, and you, fuck Babe, you are the best of all of us.”
Dean really didn’t know how he was going to pull this whole ‘date’ thing off, but he knew he was going to make it fucking awesome. I mean, first off, it was Cas’s first date. Whatever that thing was with April didn’t count. Anna definitely didn’t count.
Dean felt somewhat insulted, and doubt wound itself around his mind. How could an angel love him? He was nothing but a disgusting human.
“Well, off I go then, perhaps to recruit or try to gather intelligence. Do pray if an idea pops into either one of your heads. Good-bye Cassie, Dean.”
Cas was not expecting the man to look like that. The rundown Claire gave him on the drive from the airport did not give this man justice. But why would it? She was a kid and did not find this man attractive, but dear God, was he attractive. Cas could tell he was built even through the robe, proud shoulders, angular face, dark dirty blonde hair, freckles, and the eyes. Cas could stare at those green eyes for days, and apparently, he was.
“Ever since Jack and Cas redid Heaven I haven’t gotten to make any cool as hell technologies to hack the place.” His look of disappointment is not lost on an amused Winchester.
So, Dean being well, Dean blurted out the first thing that popped into his head when he looked at Cas: “I like the dark blue tie better.”
“It’s not that I’m jealous, I’m glad Dean is able to have a relationship with someone other than me, but I feel left out sometimes I guess. I mean he made me ride with you.” Sam realized what he said, “Not that I didn’t want to, it’s just…”
He can see the relief in the slight lowering of shoulders, the beautiful face becomes slightly less set.
“No, not every meaningful relationship comes down to that. He was an angel, they don’t feel those things.” She thought of the sanguine Grace lodged deep within Castiel when he saw Dean’s soul, the same color that spread throughout his Grace now, but in multitudes. Wait, was that? She paused, her anger at the youngest Winchester subsiding, wondering about the unique Angel sitting in the other room. Is that why she had never seen the color before? Why Castiel hid it and why it was so prevalent now? Did that even make sense? Was it possible? Her eyes trailed to the door.
There was also a very interesting man who was very animated even though the flesh of his arm was practically hanging off. He claimed he was attacked by a bear, but Dr. Myers noted the wound was far too angry to be from a bear and the claw marks didn’t match up. Bess Myers knew bears. She also knew werewolves. She simply hummed and listened to the man’s story with interest as he described in detail about finding the bear, fighting with it, getting scratched, and eventually shooting the thing in the heart and then decapitating it. He also described burning the corpse, with Dr. Myers could have lived without. However, the man was incredibly diverting, even his name brought about a smile of amusement from the ER Doctor: Garth. Dr. Myers figured she would see Garth again.
Cas narrows his eyes at the angel in confusion, then raises his brows, widening them. “I do not understand that reference.”
Dean smirked at the warning in the man’s hella deep voice. A voice which sent shivers down Dean’s spine and he really wished he wasn’t wearing hot dog pajama pants in front of this absolute sex god. He tightened his robe around his waist and thought longingly about all the jeans in his closet that showed off his ass. Then he caught himself staring at the man’s ass. Then he looked up at the ceiling, held his robe to him and finally looked at the girl, who was also smirking? Geez, she was one of the observant ones. Shit.
The brown eyes look towards the chandelier, his eyes reflecting the crystals. “I do not wish to go, brother.”
Dean smiles, a sweet and heartwarming gesture that appears on the right side of his mouth. He inclines his head forward to kiss the top of Cas’s head.
then. The itch turns into something else, something he is unsure of, something he feels as if he never experienced before, but it is warm, as if it were a small flame working furiously to fill a hole he was not aware he had.
The memory jolts the angel, and he must focus on the memory of Dean’s question to formulate an answer.
The angel nodded, “I see that. Aside from my becoming human, you all do seem to possess a certain type of happiness.”
, because the creature did not like Joe. She saw him as a bug she could squash. Easily. And relish the feeling.
There’s a moment there, between them, when Castiel looks away before looking back to a forest of green that the heat intensifies, and Castiel wishes to move closer, his grace reaching out for connection, but he remains steadfast.
Sam just shook his head with amusement as he walked past their door on his way to brew some coffee. He was surprised to see the younger version of his brother already at the table, mug in hand.
Cas’s eyes narrow. “Really, Dean? What do you think was removed from my memory before I betrayed Anna to Heaven? Hum? Do you think they left in that bit where our graces connected?”
Dean full on chuckles then and leans his head back to see Cas’s expression. It doesn’t disappoint. Cas takes the opportunity to kiss the end of Dean’s nose in such a sweet and pure motion Dean thinks it must be frozen in time somewhere. And if that wasn’t the most fucking sappy thing he’s ever thought.
Crowley licks his lips as he sits back in his chair. “To be clear, you are suggesting the entity responsible is
“I have worked with people for years that have been trained in words, that have been taught how to speak, how to write, how to persuade; however, that was the most sincere, the most beautiful, and the most eloquent compliment I have ever received, and I will never forget it.”
from a mesh compartment inside the suitcase and walks over to Dean, who had completely abandoned his work at that point, entranced by the way Cas held the book out to him, as if it were holy.
“So, like I have this one, right? Where I meet up with the guy my dad caught me with, before Mom kicked him out. I talked about it with Sammy, and he thinks that uh… it’s like I’m trying to stop it.”
The next task is the living room, which is mainly just filled with trash. He makes quick work of that and then gets to the kitchen. The kitchen proves to be a more difficult job, and Dean learns he is going to require another shower. He surveys his work, deems it acceptable and remakes Cas’s bed, that no longer smells like
Eileen nods solemnly. “But, we discussed it, and we have the chance here to save a lot of lives, and we have to take it.”
He recovers the book he started and sits on the other end of the couch. He wants Cas to know he’s there, but also that they haven’t resolved their issue.
“Because you have a fondness for the desk clerk, and she is allergic to peanuts. So, if you tried to start a flirtation you might get more than you bargained for. I suggest you change your shirt now and switch to something less harmful to your coworkers for future meals.”
“So, he knows?” Dean began to fidget, playing with the sheet, suddenly aware he was on a bed and Cas was practically naked in his room. Okay, not naked, just without the coat and jacket. But, near enough naked for Cas.
Zachariah sighs dramatically as he walks around the office and picks up the picture Castiel was looking at only moments before.
“Thank you. It was a present my twin, Jimmy, gave me on our thirtieth birthday. He was the only one in our family that understood my line of work.”
His vessel’s eyes adjusted soon enough for him to witness Castiel’s slaying of their brother with an angel blade pulled from the ether and through the angel’s neck. The empty vessel hit the floor with a sickening “thud”, and the other angel, Penemue – Castiel realized, engaged him in battle.
Thank you so, so much for reading! I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I would LOVE to hear from y'all! Comments and kudos make my day, and they always make me smile! I would also love some input on how 5.04 "The End" could be written. Thank you again, wonderful readers!
“Ah, yes.” Crowley looks to the writer, “He is Moose and your boyfriend there is Squirrel.” Crowley bites the inside of his cheek in mock concentration. “I fancy myself as Boris, so I suppose you could be Natasha.”
in this bunker would be a hell of a relief. She didn’t recognize the number but that wasn’t uncommon. She figured tracking Lucifer would be over the long haul anyway, so why not take side jobs in between?
Cas smirked and nodded, his eyes admiring each flex as Dean used the wrench to tighten a bolt on the desk’s leg.
The plastic surgeon came and expertly stitched Cas’s brow, assuring Mr. Novak and his ‘partner’ (Both men thought it spoke volumes that neither of them corrected her) that there would be only the smallest traces of a scar hidden his eyebrow.
Not too long after that he walked into the motel room and right into the middle of another staring session. He spoke up like he always did, to diffuse the moment that made him feel like a voyeur. He caught his brother’s pain though, and Cas’s relief at the interruption. So, what the hell?
“When I reunited your soul to your body, your body was mangled beyond recognition. Your innards were shredded, your entrails all but removed. I carefully rebuilt you, molecule by molecule, atom by atom. The time it took caused my true form to lay waste to the nature surrounding me.”
It was awkward at first, each trying to work around their smiles and tears. However, they managed, and when they pulled away everything suddenly fit into place.
“Oh, uh, the fans. And again, I wasn’t on board with this whole love story thing, so I thought, hey! Back as Jimmy, fangirls will swoon, and Dean will control himself.”
She takes the tool in her well-trained tendrils of grace. She begins to work on the spot of red, drilling until she extracts it, the strapped angel screaming all the while.
Dean Winchester was drunk. As in drunk off his ass drunk. So, he did what any sane person who is so drunk they can barely stand up without assistance does – he got online. Craigslist, to be exact. He chuckled as he wondered who exactly this Craig was anyway and why he had such an extensive and expansive list.
“I’m impressed.” Patience smiles at him as they approach the cold juices. “Okay, so how about coconut cream?”
The creature snarls, knowing ending the man in front of him would be as simple as a touch to his forehead, but he can’t. His human nostrils flare and he nods, calling upon Lee’s knowledge in order to interact.
“The newness will wear off my love. After we have christened all the places you mentioned, we will be content with one another just being, we will wake in one another’s arms, we will make love, be in love, but we will also be happy. We will see our family, our friends. And we will learn there is no haste, for we have forever to explore and be with one another.”
Zachariah nods one of heads, a slight gesture that unnerves Castiel slightly. He stands taller and slightly unfurls his wings.
“Man, no. I was a dick saying that. You, damn it, you are the reason the world is still here, you know that?”
Hannah begins to rub the back of Castiel’s hand with her thumb. “I understand, Castiel. I do. But, I’m not asking for you to take me back, I could never do that. I’m asking for a friend. Do you think we could maybe try that?”
Chuck clears his throat, regrets not making Sam have some type of regular girlfriend if only as a means of escape for this awkward tension, replaces his glasses, and sets to type.
Dean notices as Cas closes his eyes, seemingly against the memories, and Dean puts one of his hands on top of Cas’s. Fuck whatever Chuck thinks.
“Like, how are you, how do you almost cry when you’re upset? How do mourn like you do, how do you care so damn much, man?”
Who took too much pleasure in his specialty. Castiel works hard to keep his grace from shirking at Uriel’s approach.
“Ah, ah, ah, that is still pretty high up on the chain of command, soldier. But don’t worry, all of the host will know soon enough.”
The creature abhorred the memories that occasionally pressed themselves upon what would be its mind. Castiel was to be a
Benny takes off his hat and runs his hand through his hair before replacing the cap. “There was some rich bastard who called in an order. Wanted custom made cabinets, which one of my boys is real damn good at. This pile right here happens to be the leftovers. And what Mr. Noah Cassity don’t know, won’t hurt him.”
As their kiss becomes more heated and needy, Dean carefully lowers himself on top of Cas as Cas sinks back into the bed. Just like he did prior, Cas switches their positions easily and Dean finds himself smiling, breaking the kiss.
Hannah runs to the other side of the room and rips the painting of the archangel Michael off the wall, revealing a long silver blade underneath it. Before Hannah can grab the weapon, the creature places both of its human hands on either side of Hannah’s head, causing the woman to fall to her knees in pain. When the creature removes its hands, Hannah’s body slumps to the floor.
Dean moves his hand so that their palms are touching, he lightly traces the inside of Castiel’s wrist.
I do not own Supernatural or any other TV Show, book, movie, song, website, and/or app mentioned in this tale.
Cas tilts his head at the man in front of him. He landed in the small kitchenette of the motel Dean and Sam were currently staying at, about one foot from Dean’s face.
Dean suddenly just felt so much worse for Gabe’s death. He tries to snap out of that train of thought real quick.
It’s slow and sweet at first, but small pecks soon turn into hungry, needy things, each unable to get their fill. Their wait and their want comes to the surface, and the kisses turn into wet, hot, lustful expressions of everything they have been holding onto for years.
Cas breaks their gaze as he looks to the ceiling. “Apparently, she left him and needed a ‘fresh start’.”
Castiel can almost feel his heart breaking and he subconsciously puts his hand there. Balthazar regards him with narrowed eyes.
“It is foretold that as one of the nine you are to break a seal. My coming here was to prevent that.”
Dean’s eyes narrow and he pulls his bottom lip into his mouth in contemplation. “Wait, you think He’s
Sam had never really thought of that implication until right fucking now, and his heart does this weird little flip-flop. Fuck yeah, like Dean. Of course, two self-sacrificing sons of bitches would end up getting married to each other.
With a look invoking the goddess of ennui, the Void takes a packet of tobacco out of his smoking jacket pocket and begins to fill his pipe, allowing the minion nearest him to strike a match to light it. He rolls his dark brown eyes languidly as the minion fumbles with the match in such an inadequate fashion that she causes the flame to flicker dangerously close to extinguishment. He draws from the pipe deeply and blows smoke in a succession of rings from his thin lips, the rings wafting away into the nothingness over him.
“Oh, come on Vic, it’s just Bobby and Ellen, you hit the jackpot as far as potential in-laws are concerned.”
. He tried to press it into his mind with all the grace he had left. The effort left him dizzy, and he breathed deeply to recover and keep up his defenses.
Thank you so, so much for reading!! I hope you enjoy this chapter. Thank you so much for the kudos, subscriptions, and bookmarks! They mean so much as the author of this tale.
“We are about to win here, Cassie. All of us. And those two mud monkey brothers are going to finish this up. Think about it, one brother breaking the first seal, the other breaking the last.”
He reaches out his hands, putting one on Sam’s chest and one on Dean’s. He pointedly ignores the reaction in his fingertips when they feel Dean’s blood pumping through his veins, the heat at the surface, the electricity that shoots throughout him, millions of electrical sparks jolting through, only fizzling when he steps back.
“No, angels and demons can only tell what they are when they are in front of us. The only ones who can sense them are the Guardians, and they are sworn to secrecy. They are the most trusted of angels.”
Cas feels Dean’s arms unwind from around him and notices as a weight is lifted from the bed. He takes his phone from the nightstand and looks at the time: 2:38am. He buries himself further into the bed and pulls the comforter to his chin. He feels the bed dip again and wonders why Dean didn’t resume his position of ‘big spoon’.
Cas averts his eyes to the ground and Balthazar turns his chin, making him once more resume eye contact.
Where Alastair called upon the power of Hell before, he was now invoking the omnipotent power of God to send Castiel back. The angel fights vehemently against him, willing his grace to stay within his vessel to protect him.
Chuck closes his laptop gleefully as he scratches at his beard. “That was great guys, really. Whew. Really got in there today.”
Anger surges through Castiel’s grace as he looks towards the roof of the building, the large fan spinning slowly. The Seraph summons rain from the firmament. The water pours in through the metal openings that allow the fan to process air, quelling the fire.
Dean looked towards the expectant Angel and pursed his lips. His nostrils flared and he muttered with a conviction Sam was used to only hearing when there was a big fight ahead of them one word neither youngest hunter nor Angel was expecting,
Dean places a bowl of shrimp and grits in front of Cas and one in front of Chuck. Begrudgingly, he might add. He adored cooking for Cas, but the in-law was not a pleasure. He sits next to Cas once he got his own bowl.
The creature walks throughout the apartment, noting there appears to be nothing of interest. She wanders into the bedroom, and finds a book titled “Dreamways of the Iroquios: Honoring the Secret.” The book recalls a memory from Hannah’s mind.
Castiel carried the soul of Dean Winchester to the grave his brother so lovingly and despairingly prepared. He opens up the wooden box and reunites body and soul. His true form is a hinderance on this plane, and he begins to carefully rebuild the body entrusted in his care.
She knew why he was asking. The memories Castiel had given her showed that Sam had been chosen for evil. He looked disappointed in her answer. Castiel’s memories were already proving to be a bit of a loose cannon. Yes, they were contained, but they seeped out. She imagined it as a vapor escaping different lobes making their way to the forefront. She had already learned a great deal about Sam.
Cas interrupted him, “Thank you, ma’am. I believe we’re ready to order, I’m putting this one in charge of mine.” He smiled so sweetly at the waitress that Dean almost melted, again.
“Did you bring Lisa? Where is she?”, Garth then asked, not realizing he wasn’t really helping improve Dean’s mood by bringing her up.
“They’re here.”, Charlie then slightly uneased exclaimed and Castiel thought she meant Garth and Bess at first, but when he followed her gaze he spotted them through the window. Dean. And of course, right next to him, Lisa.
Dean nodded in agreement. He felt a small tone of her thinking he’d be too anxious to ask the teacher himself. It was only half-true because he felt like it would make a bad impression if he went there and asked, when it was obvious he wished he didn’t have to be there at all. It annoyed him a bit that Charlie saw that and said it, but he decided to let it rest. In all honesty, he actually liked the prospect of helping with the lightning or sound. It’s something he thought could be interesting and fun to learn. He even thought he had seen a book about it at his uncle Bobby’s house once, which he could borrow.
“They’re trying to talk us out of moving in together after Graduation.”, Bess then chimed in. “It’s stupid, to be honest, they’re all saving money by it and it’s not like we’re signing some sort of livelong contract. Yeah we’re still young but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out between us. We’re old enough to make this decision by ourselves and if it’s a mistake, then it’s our mistake to make, you know.”
“Eh, yeah, Cas and Charlie are around here somewhere, Garth and Bess said they might be late though.”, David explained and Dean nodded.
. A year ago, Dean wouldn’t have even noticed if he walked past Garth, or any of the theatre kids for that matter, in the hallway. And if he did, he and his friends would have probably made fun of them.
looked at the boy in front of him. How was it even possible for a human to have such deeply blue eyes and perfectly dark curled lashes? … wanted to tell him something…
“So, you got it all figured out, huh?”, Dean said, already knowing of Garth and Bess’ mutual plans to go away to college together. He really envied them for having it all together and dreamed of how nice it must feel to not have that lingering stress of the uncertainty of the future, hanging over your head.
“I think Dean would make a really pretty princess.”, Alastair tried imitating wearing a dress and twirled around, fluttering his eyelashes.
“No, I’m serious. My brother had the same issue back in High School. He somehow messed up with the courses he took, thought football would be enough and it wasn’t. Because he has no other talents whatsoever, he joined the drama club and ended up just playing a tree and that was it.”, Benny explained and to Dean’s surprise, it actually made sense.
“I can’t. I have football practice right after Drama club.”, he explained and pointed at the gym bag over his arm.
Castiel seemed to genuinely be excited for him and it only verified Dean’s intuition about going to tell him in person.
It wasn’t really, but coming late to football practice wasn’t an option, so he always bought a bag of crisps at the vending machine before drama club and then ate it on the way to the football field.
Lisa was genuinely pissed at him and Dean couldn't blame her. He was pretty sure though 'I'm sorry I might have feelings for this quirky dude I met in drama club and have been in total denial about it' was the explanation she wanted.
“Okay.”, Charlie then just said, and they went on to fill up their cups, deciding to not let anything stop them from having a good time tonight. And they would. Cas was adamant.
The next day, Dean couldn’t wait to find Cas and tell him about how he might have finally figured out what he wanted to do after High School. He had spent a good amount of time on the phone to Bobby last night, talking everything through and it had put him in a really good spirit. He hadn’t talked to his dad yet, and only told Sam because he seemed worried about Dean actually being in a good mood for once, but most of all, he actually just wanted to go and tell Cas about it, feeling like he owed to tell him as soon as possible. Cas had really tried to help Dean with all this as well and he felt like this was somehow a win for both of them, or whatever.
I’m sorry I’m taking so long to update, but I’m currently having exams and can barely find the energy to write but I have a lot of plans for this so don’t worry, I will soon be back to regularly updating :) I'm a bit nervous about this Chapter because it went a bit different than planned so I hope you still like it :)
“Oh that’s Marcus. He works on the sets.”, he explained and Dean didn’t break his gaze at them for one second. They were standing awfully close to each other. “Good for him though.”, Garth then said and Dean finally turned his head to look at Garth questioning that statement. Garth noted the confusion on Dean’s face.
“He’s a family friend. A car mechanic, he owns a repair shop. I sometimes help him out when I’m there and I actually never mind. It’s very interesting, most of the time even fun.”, he explained and thought back to the multiple weekends he spent there, helping Bobby in the shop, while Sam was sitting somewhere reading a book.
“I don’t have a problem.”, Dean lied, still with the same note of attitude. Castiel already had had a good amount of alcohol, that was obvious, but still he didn’t break eye contact.
As if the universe had timed it, they arrived at the spot they had agreed to meet Lisa's friend at. But she wasn't there yet.
“Only one is missing now.”, Charlie said and looked around until something seemed to have caught her eyes.
Dean tried to play it off as casually as possible, talking while refilling his cup with soda, and putting Lisa’s empty bottle away before reaching to pick up a new one.
The next week, after Dean had enrolled in the Drama Club, he made his way to the small theater they had in the basement of the school. He sometimes asked what it actually was that got him to the point in his life where he had to join the Drama Club, in a school, he only just stopped being the “new Kid” at and now had this risk of losing his newly established “football guy” status. Being forced to spend his Thursday afternoon with some nerds that actually enjoy being embarrassing in front of people and while probably being primarily girls, surely not the type of girls he liked. He saw a few students waiting in front of the backdoor, which was where he was told to go as well. He recognized some of them from his classes and even thinks one or two were friends with his brother, but he didn’t take the time to look at all of them carefully.
“And no better place to start with that than a party, am I right?”, he said half sarcastic, half genuine and raised his glass, which contained a mixture of Coke and Rum that Charlie had prepared for him. Charlie smiled and did the same.
“I just feel like this is the first time I am actually excited about my future and I just really want y-”, Dean realized the huge error he was almost about to make and froze. Forced himself to just shut the fuck up right here and there. It felt like his head was spinning as he was just blank staring onto a slightly confused Castiel. Dean needed to find a way to resolve this little problem as soon as he could but as he was staring at Cas it got worse. He rather just forced himself to be quiet, say nothing, do nothing. He got this ache that he used to be able to suppress very well but apparently with all the happiness coming to the surface so did it. His eyes were luckily the only thing he couldn’t keep from doing something and he caught himself taking a glance at Cas’ lips. He felt his whole body wanting to just get closer, flashbacks came flooding back from the last time he had to fight against everything in him and luckily for Dean with it came the reason he was able to hold back. People. The little control he could gain over his eyes he used to change focus from Castiel’s flawless face to try and find something in the background. Jersey. Football Jersey. Three guys from Dean’s football team walked past right as Dean felt himself gain control over his everything again. There were people around. Judgy, mean, high school students. There was no need for Dean to embarrass himself by taking this leap and getting rejected anyway in front of other people. Not that he actually wanted to take the leap. Or do anything. Or say anything. Or ever would.
After football practice, Dean and his friends were standing outside the school. Dean was waiting for Sam while Crowley and Alastair were smoking. Dean was the only one in the group who didn’t regularly smoke. If he did, then only at parties, or before exams.
“You know, maybe this whole thing would be a bit more enjoyable for you if you actually got along with some of them. Maybe even made friends. I am sure she only tried to be nice. But of course that’s not something you’d consider. Just get off your high horse, it’s no one’s but your fault that you have to go there. At least try and make the best of it.”
This Chapter was never supposed to be this long, and I doubt I will keep up Chapters of this capacity, but yeah. I apologize if it's a bit chaotic, I didn't expect to have this much content planned for one chapter.
“Oh, calm down Cas. I know all about you, I’ve seen pictures of you in this position tons of times. But you were enjoying it then.”
She looked to Cas, “Maybe you know what became of my angel? I lost him three years ago.” She touched her coat absent mindedly, “His name was Ezekiel.”
Cas knew it was terribly domestic, and he knew he would be reaching for a lot. But after that breakfast, where Dean seemed to enjoy cooking for him, he thought maybe a couple dates wouldn’t hurt. And maybe Claire was right, maybe he wouldn’t ruin Dean’s life. Their chemistry was palpable. Cas felt Dean’s absence, which never occurred with another being in his life.
He passes by Dean on the couch, who is curled up in a fitful sleep, the bottle of Jack sitting precariously on the edge of the coffee table.
The angel wonders at the words, seeing earth for what it can offer alone. He is vaguely aware of time, but not as he knows the humans are. For he is infinite, and they are finite. He oft marvels at their expiry, wonders if that alone is what gives them meaning? If earth offers no meaning as the wise King suggests, then is their meaning to be found in their deaths since they will no longer be one with the earth but with their afterlife? Are their deaths what made their lives, their existences meaningful? The angel wonders alone in his thoughts, afraid to share them, afraid of the consequence. For angels were not supposed to think, lest they fall.
Dean licks his lips and raises himself slightly, using Cas’s chest to prop his elbow on. He was kinda thankful the guy had angel strength and wouldn’t mind. Although, he seriously doubted the human Cas would’ve shoved him off.
Castiel’s mind wanders at Uriel’s words and he knows that even if it hadn’t been ordered he would have raised Dean’s soul anyway, if he’d ever seen it. Something so bright should never be in a place so dark.
Claire walked over to him and shrugged. “Sure, I mean, it looks like even you could put this thing together.”
The blonde strokes Cas’s forehead lightly, his thumb tracing over the stitches. “Are you entirely certain I cannot heal you?”
“I have never known Father to be scared, However, I have also never known of an event that mirrored His power in terms of Creation itself.”
The angel walks to stand closer to his charge, he sees the hope on Dean’s face, and his grace settles in a type of pit, almost as if it were a weight in a human stomach. He knows that whatever Dean is about to ask he probably will be unable to help, as it will be forbidden, or against orders. He feels he must disappoint Dean at every turn, and it saddens him.
Lucifer rages against the bars and all of his many eyes burn red. Castiel stands his ground, confident in the cage’s warding.
Castiel walks back in, realizing not even acknowledging another human presence was beyond rude. He stands next to Sam and begins signing.
Dean opens the fridge to see an absolutely beautiful platter of sausages. He smiles as he pulls them out and sits them on the counter. He opens the freezer to see a bag of frozen hash browns, and oh yeah, smothered hash browns for breakfast.
“I understand your not being able to reciprocate my feelings Dean, and perhaps I do lament I was not brought back in a female vessel, if not only to experience all things with you. Would that be a consideration, if my vessel were female?”
But there was nothing to stop. Only pain, pain Dean didn’t need anymore of. But it didn’t matter, not to
Dean woke to the sun streaming forcefully onto his face. He kept his eyes closed against it, allowing the warmth to spread over him. He felt Cas shift on top of his chest and tightened his arms around the angel, content in this place, this space, with him.
It made a significant difference when Dean pretended that Baby stalled in the middle of a state highway, causing Cas to push her to the side of the road. Dean only realized after he had left the car in park.
The Demon flashed and hit the floor, and Dean looked down. Sticking out of his abdomen was the hilt of a knife.
"Yeah, seriously, just leave it. Call him, don't call him, I don't give a fuck. Leave me alone." He knows he's not being fair, it's not Sam's fault that Dean's had his heart broken, but he can't help it. It all hurts too much and talking about it will just make it worse.
When it was over, they just laid there for a while, tangled in each other, pressing soft kisses here and there.
God does Dean want to tell him though. He's come close a few times, but always chickens out at the last second. Maybe he can do it. He's going to have to, or he's going to have to move out, because he can't take the pain anymore, it hurts too much.
Cas turns around, taking in Dean's look with a puzzled look of his own. After a minute realization seems to dawn on him and he smiles. "No, not lunch. Lunch. That's her name." He says, before turning around and walking up the stairs, like that isn't the most random name for a chicken he's ever heard.
Inside are cards. Business cards. Dean pulls one out and looks at it. They're beautifully done, with 'Winchester Woodworking' on one side over a wood print, and on the other his name, phone number, and 'The family business, saving chickens, building things' with a little cartoon chicken. A laugh bubbles out of Dean's chest because it's so fucking
Dean started shovelling the food into his mouth. When it was halfway gone, he looked up and noticed Cas watching him with a small smile on his face.
"He didn't pick on me. And, trust me, being gay had nothing to do with what went wrong." He chuckles a little, memories flitting through his mind. Memories that are inappropriate for this conversation with his daughter. Inappropriate at any time really, but sometimes he can't help himself.
They sit in silence for a long while, and Emma starts to nod off in her chair, so Dean folds up his hoodie and lays it on one end of a row of chairs, and Emma lays her head down on it and promptly falls asleep.
"Does it matter, now?" Dean asks, stepping away from the door and walking into the livingroom. He hears Cas close the door and follow him.
"Its really fine, man." Dean said, looking at him. Dean stared for a few moments, then said "you really like her."
"Yeah, sweetheart. We can do that now." Dean smiles, before leaning in and capturing Cas' lips with his own.
Cas glanced over at Anna, who was leaning forward on the table, grinning up at Dean. A surge of jealousy hit Cas so hard, it knocked the wind out of him.
"Dean, what're you doing? You don't need to leave," Cas says from the doorway. Dean can't even look at him, just continues to stuff as many clothes as he can into the bag. He needs to get out, get away, and he's not sure that he'll ever be able to come back here. "Please, stop. Why are you packing?"
"Dean" Cas gasped, as Dean pushed his thigh in between Cas' legs. Dean brought his mouth back to Cas', shoving his tongue inside. Its was like Cas was air, and Dean needed him to breathe. He couldn't stop, he didnt want to stop. He wanted all of Cas.
Dean shakes his head. "You haven't. It's been no trouble, at least not until today." He says with a laugh.
It's not like Cas could just tell him why he'd been keeping to himself. He couldn't explain that watching Dean with other people was killing him. That being around this amazing man was making him ache with need and want.
"For believing me. For giving me a chance to earn your trust back. For..." Dean pauses, snuggles closer. "For accepting me the way I am."
Dread fills him as the voicemail continues, and before it's even finished he's standing up and pulling money out of his wallet to throw on the table.
Once inside, door closed, Cas deposits his bag onto the floor, shucks his coat off and slips out of his boots. When he turns back to Dean, he sees he's done the same, and is now staring at him with a mix of wonder and desire.
Sinking down, Dean takes Cas all the way into his mouth, before pulling back and doing it again, flicking his tongue along the underside and taking more in each time. Cas is falling apart beneath him, Dean can tell he's struggling to keep his hips in place and not thrust up into Dean's mouth, so Dean wraps his hands around Cas' hips, encouraging him.
A few minutes later, Cas was pulling onto a dirt road, if it could even be called a road, trees covering both sides.
Finally it registered to Dean, and he pulled his mouth off of Cas. Breathing heavily, he looked into Cas's face. "What's wrong?"
"Yes, exactly!" Charlie's says, punching him lightly in the arm. "Annnnyway, I'm Dean's bestie, but I always have room for more, and I think you and I are gonna be good friends."
Dean looked at Cas for another minute, before turning and heading for the stairs to the door. "I'll be back soon" he shouted over his shoulder.
"I am an angel of the lord, Dean. You underestimate my strength, and over estimate my patience" he growled.
Dean could feel a grin spreading across his face, and he looked back at Cas. "This is awesome." He said.
It's a while later that Cas' tears finally dry up, and he sits there slumped against Dean, worn out, exhausted. He notices Dean filling out some forms on a clipboard, and vaguely wonders when he'd gotten them, but feels very grateful that Dean is taking care of it.
With contentment coursing through him, Dean gets into the car and drives away, knowing he'll be seeing Cas again soon.
"It was a long time ago." He can hear the pleading in his own voice. The desperation for Cas to just
Dean's heart dropped. Hed almost forgotten he'd said that. Almost. "Saying that was one if the stupidest things to ever come out of my mouth. I was hurt, and mad, and I blamed you for moms death. But I should have never said that. I'm sorry Cas."
Cas slowly looked over at Dean. "Dean, if you're going to be friends with her, she deserves to know the truth."
They watched him go, and Cas turned around and sat back on the couch. "Well that was... something." He looked at Dean and saw concern on his face. "What? Dont worry about Jack, hes fine."
When the alarm goes off, Cas stops what he's doing, no matter how hard it is to not finish what he's in the middle of, and goes inside to take a shower, messaging Dean on the way to ask if he's still coming over.
The police escort everyone off the bus, and Dean explains what happened. Everyone who was on the bus backs his story, and before long the guy who punched him and his two friends are being cuffed and pushed into the back of the cruisers, for assault and sexual harassment. They say Dean will have to come down to the police station to file an official statement to press charges, but it can wait until tomorrow. After the police heard about what they'd done to the young woman on the bus, they're more than happy to let the guys cool their heels in a cell for the night.
"Cas, sweetheart" Dean says, their foreheads pressed together, rutting against each other. "I can't- I'm going to- please tell me this is okay."
By the time Dean gets home, his energy is depleted and he wants nothing more than to collapse on the couch. He kicks his boots off, shuffles down the hallway, and does just that, burying his head into the cushions.
When Dean looks back at Gordon, Gordon rolls his eyes. "It's always hard to get a steak cooked right."
Sam laughed "come one Cas, you guys have been dancing around this for far too long. It's about time one of you bucked up and made a move."
"Cant a man who almost died get 5 minutes alone without you freaking out?" Dean asked, shoving his phone in his pocket.
Cas doesn't even respond though, just starts putting food on his plate. Emma is looking at Dean, and he finally says "jesus, calm down. We just slept." Claire tilts her head in a very Cas like fashion, and Dean says "seriously, he came over to talk, it got late, and we went to sleep. Now eat your damn breakfast and stop looking at me."
