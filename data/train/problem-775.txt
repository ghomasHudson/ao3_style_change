. Just to spite her.”
I will like it...you look almost...
Sherlock shot him an annoyed look, lips ticked up on a brief, gentle smile as John removed his fingers, “The moon is needed as much as the sun,” he told him, keeping his tone low, the sound of Bach still surrounding them in the still night air. “You can’t be dull. You know how much I despise dullness. I won't have it. You have to be more to attract me. To keep me coming back.” Though his words were arrogant and laced in confidence, Sherlock’s expression of morose didn’t change, only his eyes shifted, sparkling for a second with a familiar energy. "I dismiss anything below my standards."

“...You would dispose of it if I said no?” Sherlock snorted, clutching the mug and then standing to get a better look around.

,” Greg chocked, sounding like he’d just been physically hit with the realisation of what he was doing. He didn’t stop though, scarcely even paused, only got a strong arm under Sherlock’s shoulders to heft his upper body up for easier access, cradling and tipping his head back to expose the long, tense line of his neck for Greg’s mouth again.
, why?--"
say what I’m apparently ‘supposed’ to say,” Sherlock retorted, feeling too hot and too breathless. He wanted to close the distance between them, needing to be sure, needing to look at him properly, and hating how far away John was, hating how he was rendered, once again, brainless by something John had done, had said.
“Wh-why not do both?” Sherlock whispered with an impatient quiver, lips twitching into a forced, haughty grin before parting, pink, wet and inviting.
Greg’s brow crumpled in a mixture of bemusement and scepticism, and he spluttered on his current gulp, getting coffee down his chin, “Doubtful,” he coughed, catching the worst of his spillage on his fingers to suck off.

Crowding into Sherlock's space again, not caring that his erection was smearing pre-come across the fabric of Sherlock's trousers, John eyed him up and down until the detective blushed, shifted apprehensively and went silent, “I'm going to kiss you. Right now…” he surprised them both by saying, “because it's either that or I punch you in your smug fucking face.”
“...I should do this more often,” Sherlock commented a few moments into it, when John was limp and shuddering, somehow caught between overwhelming relaxation and sharp, building arousal. “You have a lot of knots. And some ribs are out of place just a tad…”

.” Rubbing his face with both hands he then pushed back his hair, took a breath and looked back at John with an odd gleam to his eyes. “If we kiss, can we remove them?”
“No, just… “ John heaved a long slow breath and forced the tension from his shoulders, “No, only… you don’t.”
"Yeah... yeah, I got it," John nodded and lowered his head back onto the cushion, the weight of Sherlock feeling more amazing by the second. It was a different sensation of what he was used to, especially with Sherlock being naked under his robe, yet amazing nonetheless. “Just be careful with the top bit of the scar… that's where it's

sing it. You’re a terrible singer!
John opened his mouth, faltered at Sherlock’s lifted eyebrows, closed it and opened it once more to try again, "Well... I... I, uh, I..." he stammered and tried to think, tried to continue on with what he’d been doing, been saying, knowing it had been the right path, that he was going the right way about it, he just needed to carry on. One second became three, then more and more until he just clenched his teeth. He had no idea how to start this. How to talk to Sherlock. How to get out everything he felt, wanted, had thought, had said, had been told. “
“No. No, not really. I was just asking. Wondering,” Greg said with a shrug and a darting gaze, rubbing the back of his neck and then up under his chin. Restless and so far oblivious. John watched Sherlock watch Greg, and wondered if the obliviousness was an act. “I don’t have that many friends, not ones that are into stuff that’s outside the norm, stuff that’s new and exciting and a little bit—” Finally noticing Sherlock’s narrowed look, Greg sought out John for confirmation and aid. John tried to express his newfound interest in response. “
Stomping his way towards the tube station, John uncontrollably began giving death glares to anyone who even came even remotely near him, not wanting to be bothered, to be touched, to be looked at, as his brain worked in overtime to try and understand everything, make sense of what happened and how it would now affect him, affect his life, and if there was any way, any at all, to fixing what he'd done. John could have blamed Sherlock, as he had been the one to visit him in his bedroom, could have played the victim and tried to reason that Sherlock had seduced him when he was half asleep, still bleary eyed. That he had been dazzled by the glorious sensations of Sherlock's mouth on his dick. Yet he knew that it wasn't coercion. He hadn't been taken advantage of.

, I bet I could."
Sherlock twitched at the volume and let out a croaky, confused, panicked sort of sound, hands still trying to pacify him, “I… I…” he uttered uselessly, swallowing so hard that John heard the wet click of it as Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bobbed against his palm. John could see how dazed he was, how large his eyes remained, and couldn’t stop himself from flexing his fingers roughly, feeling a sick delight pierce through him at Sherlock’s responding fidgeting. His bare feet stepping on and against John’s own. "I was... was just..."
“... So
“Mm - Too tired. Can we just hug... for a minute?” John asked, trying for a dramatic playful sigh but instead moaning softly, wantonly, enjoying the warmth and proximity of Sherlock before he shimmied his trousers down to his ankles. Sherlock held him as he stepped out of them, using his left foot to stand on the fabric so he could pull his right foot out, and then he kicked them aside. "This... this is good. Nice... I, uh, I like a hug or two, you know?"

“No. Not at all.”

They’re extremely good at geography, can learn the intricate details of vast area, something immensely useful when they’re finding food, and exhibit problem-solving behavior, as well as being curious and inquisitive animals.” He put the bird down at his feet again, near his chair, and turned a hardened glare at John, arms folded. “And it's really quite hypocritical of you to mock
Sherlock dug into his pocket, paying the driver much more than was needed, strangely thankful that the man hadn’t looked at them with disgust, nor muttered pathetic, unneeded opinions about their sexuality under his breath, “Yes, thank you,” he said as he handed over the money and followed John out onto the pavement.

Sherlock seemed to be trying to rearrange thoughts within his mind-palace, “
“You'll like this one...” John promised, then pulled back and unceremoniously rammed Sherlock's legs down, watching him scramble to right himself on his feet, their cocks bumping awkwardly with a moist slap. He untangled their limbs and left Sherlock, naked, dazed and wanting to walk towards his bedside table. John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him the entire way, felt them burning holes into the back of his head, and so he took his time retrieving his bottle of lube, and a strip of condoms, casually, sternly looking back at him. “Turn around, face the wall. Put your hands on it and spread your legs.”

! Yes, make… make me come!” John wasn’t quite ready for the stiffening seizing way in which Sherlock’s body abruptly trapped him, nor the raw, deafening, cry of ecstasy as Sherlock came again, splattering the floor, the wall, in noisy, thick spurts.
“Interested in

“No, you can’t chase it,” Sherlock told him, bending to keep Orion back, grinning as the pup whined and jumped, trying to get over the barrier of Sherlock’s hand. “No, no. It’s not worth it.”
Using John’s hand to hide his face in, Sherlock huffed, “

In fact, he couldn't remember what Sherlock had thought, had said about the show, and knew, even before he opened his mouth that he would be making stuff up. “Jessica Fletcher was the one who did th'murders. She set 'em all up for the

"I guess you'll have to find out," John said as he wandered back into the kitchen. "Toast?"
! Why did you tell him to ask me about... the work!" John clarified, his anger building again. "If you wanted to clarify that you were already attached you could have asked yourself."
It was a stress relief, a moment of madness, and one John didn't want to end. He used the hand on Sherlock's hip to rumple and yank and stroke up under Sherlock's shirt, fingers skimming across hot flesh and juddering muscle. He could feel the erection renewing against his stomach already, could feel the wetness of Sherlock's previous orgasm smearing and sinking against his skin. It was a heady mix. Tightening his hand in Sherlock's hair, John bit down hard on his bottom lip and drank in the reaction with rolling eyes, gorging himself on Sherlock's wet gasp as he arched his neck to pull his head back, pressing into John’s fingers tangled in his hair and dragging his lip through the gnawing grind of John’s teeth. He was all submissive, writhing enthusiasm, quickly perspiring and slicking against John’s wandering palm and pinching fingers. Sherlock’s nipples were pebbled and stiff, and according to his jolting breath-hitching reaction, very sensitive to any sort of touch, be it the pad of a thumb, or the scrape of a nail. Everything John did, soft, hard, rough, light, sent Sherlock thrashing in ardour. He didn’t struggle, he didn’t tell John to stop, and he didn’t let John let go.
What he got, as he stepped expectantly into the kitchen, was a noise. A noise he had never heard before within the flat. A noise not made by a human. It made him freeze, every part of him tensing with an alertness borne from years of Army training. He surveyed the area, eyes darting across every counter, cupboard, and deep into the corners, before he turned to the open space of the living room and stood wordlessly, blinking in shock at the scene he encountered. At the black, beady eyes he stared into, the eyes of a large bird currently standing between Sherlock’s legs. It wasn't just any bird either, it the largest turkey John had ever seen. It was practically dinosaur sized with weird feet and dark feathers. It gave John the heebie-jeebies. Like a raptor.
a virgin too?” Sherlock asked with a small chuckle. “In a manner of speaking, anyway.”
“It will probably only be something little,” John promised, patting the pales curves of Sherlock's knuckles. “Just a daft little token and I won't be offended if you don't like it.
“No, no,” she said with a wave of her hand. “You two go, I’ll make some more cookies. Perhaps with this new mixer!”
As they passed into the corridor, Mrs Hudson gave his forearm a friendly pat, “Can’t hide much from me, dear,” she told him and he stared at the mistletoe that was hanging just outside Sherlock’s bedroom door, stared at what that meant and why it was that she steered him toward it in such an encouraging manner. “Now, normally, I don’t like to pry too much. But you and Sherlock sometimes need a bit of a nudge—
? You... wait...
Nodding in reply, Sherlock shot him a quick smile, “Yes. Yes, they are.”
?—And what
“Um, yes,” Sherlock replied with a shrug, clearly not interested or really listening to him as he pulled the jumper off, flung it over his shoulder, and started to work on the buttons of John’s shirt, stroking the skin of his clavicle and chest as he went. John knew he should be annoyed, or rather more annoyed, but Sherlock leaned closer still and pressed a momentary kiss to his lips, and he let it go. Begrudgingly. “Sit forward so I can have this.”
,” Sherlock told him. “Or sooner if you keep this up.”

John soothed him with a hush and crouched down to take him in his arms, “No, no, it's
As his teeth sank into the strained flesh of that gorgeous throat, Sherlock gasped, grabbed for him with slicked fingers and violently shuddered, exhaling the most erotically gruff bark of sound that he’d made thus far. John let go just in time to see Sherlock’s body thrash, every muscle contracted and shivering, from his jerking thighs to his bulging biceps, cock jumping almost straight up to spatter semen in high arcs along his body, catching John’s arm as it went, dampening the sleeve of his jumper. Everything about him juddered in the aftermath, clenching and unclenching, and Sherlock whimpered through it, eyes rolled up and mouth dropping open. John had to move in, had to kiss him, had to suck at his lips, smear his mouth up his reddened cheek, couldn’t not. Sherlock deserved the praise.
?” he repeated with a confused sniff, watching it wave its head and tail once more. Abruptly interested in such a simple concept, finding the results strangely quite compelling, Sherlock took it into the living room as he picked up the socks Mrs Hudson had bought him.
“Get these off,” John ordered, though quickly found himself too impatient, too frustrated with the wait to allow Sherlock the freedom and time to strip, and so grabbed at his clothes piece by piece. Tugging and roughly throwing Sherlock's quickly freed shirt to one side and then ripping Sherlock's sodden trousers down his hips, his long bent and shaking legs, and kicking them away.
Sitting, rigid and hyper aware of things outside of the room, Sherlock began stroking incessantly at John’s knuckles, “How did you happen upon this place?”
“He may not come back if called—Will he? If he makes a run for it, I’m pretty sure I can catch him, but I’d rather not go darting after a misbehaving puppy,” Sherlock said uneasily, petting Orion’s head and eyeing the park, gaze scanning the amount of people scattered around, some hidden by trees or relaxing on benches. There were some other dogs, small breeds mostly from what Sherlock could see, though he could hear there were others and knew that the park often allowed all kinds of dogs.
you two are so sweet!”
Sherlock blinked down at him and moved closer, though not towards John’s face, to his waist, where his crotch was exposed from a flipped back and crumpled piece of the blanket. John frowned, heart suddenly all he could hear, and watched as Sherlock bent his head until the tip of his nose skimmed the hard shape of John’s morning erection through the worn, soft fabric of his pyjama bottoms. It shot a thrilling jolt throughout his body, made him twitch and inhale sharply, and though he knew he should move, should question Sherlock’s actions, push him away, do something, he just lay there, watching as Sherlock breathed down against him and then returned his gaze, eyes dark silver.
John took a deep and sobering breath, “So,” he repeated, feeling the tendrils of some sort of crisis clawing at his insides. “I…I’m probably not…you know, entirely straight—given the evidence at…or, well, in your hand, heh.”
She sent him a warning glare but sat down in her own chair close to her present, “You’d best watch yourself young man, or there won’t be
John hummed and placed it on his palm. The fish then started to curl up until it was nothing more than a coil on his hand. “…
“Yes,” Sherlock said again, eye twitching, smile stretching his face, digging into his cheeks. She smiled back as she scanned the last of the items and told him the price, putting it in the bag. Sherlock waved his card at her and tried not to snatch the card reader when it was held out in response. “Straight home now, John.”

“I’d certainly like to repeat a few things we’ve done today,” John said in a guttural provocative tone, turning his head so their noses touched.

Greg’s eyes narrowed sharply, “Shut it, screamer.”
what he does. He’s a naughty little possessive elf who has you, fundamentally, by the crotch!” Sarah’s grin got wider and she leaned in to kiss his cheek, glancing down at the underwear with another giggle. “
As Sherlock leaned away again, gently batting Orion from his mouth, he caught sight of a thick stick near his foot, already wet with saliva, bark broken by sharp teeth, and reached for it quickly, lifting it high when Orion barked and jumped, “
to happen now?” John asked in return, leaning over and up to press a warning smooch to Sherlock’s quickly pouting, twisted mouth, “We can kiss some more.
John's legs felt weak, like he could barely keep them straight, keep himself up and he sighed, sagging with a breathless, blissed laugh, and staggering aside to catch himself on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, "
John grinned and stole another quick peck before pulling away completely and heading to his chair where his shoes were hidden, “I think I might wear those gloves Mrs Hudson bought me.”
. It's... it's like pressing a bruise in a... in a weird way. Painful but surprisingly enjoyable. A bit... addictive. - It's a confusing feeling.”
“… You deserve so much,” John muttered after a moment, still leaning into him, fingers combing and drifting up into Sherlock’s hair.
…” he muttered, lifting him, holding him, and carrying him towards Sherlock's chair, it wasn't the most comfortable, but it would be the easier to clean, and so he slouched down on the leather, wincing at the chill of it against his burning nude skin before. Sherlock, of course, tumbled on top of him, straddling the tops of his thighs and tucking his feet under the backs of John's knees. It was perfect. It was amazing. It was more than things had felt, had been, that morning. They were closer, more intimately interlocked. “This is better.” John cupped Sherlock's chin and brought him down for a kiss, a sweet and long and ardent kiss. “I... I don't think I can get enough of your body pressing against mine...”
I would love him.”
“You are too good for me, you know. I don’t deserve anyone like you,” Sherlock whispered, unaware he’d said the sentence out loud until he watched the response play out over John’s face. He followed it with his fingertips and then frowned, looking away and jumping when the microwave beeped. “I should see to that, but, John, I--”
Yet that wasn't what he got.
, stop that!”
“Not for long. She likes you. You’re the nice doctor who keeps the mad detective in check,” Sherlock assured him as he took a bite, holding out the remaining piece to John. “Here. Payment. Don’t say I don’t thank you.” John regarded it, his hands still full of paper, then opened his mouth. It was what couples did. What he’d done with others. What Sherlock had seen a thousands times in sappy films and TV shows. Sherlock stared at him, stomach in sudden, flipping knots, and slowly pressed the biscuit against John’s bottom lip, teeth and tongue, “Good?”
“Alright, fine, and now I'm finishing it—God, why do I
to…” he tried, trying to find the best way to word his heartbroken woes during their time living together. How he had flared bright like a beacon with jealousy and upset each time John had smiled at a woman, dated one, left him for one. Leaving him to mope, alone, in the flat, surrounded by their belongings, their life. He thought of all the subtle touches between them and all the times it had made his pulse skip. There had been times he’d wanted to tell John so badly it had pained him. Times he’d been so enraged and agitated, that he had almost let it slip. Though then, as now, he been afraid of losing him, losing what they had, and therefore had vowed to enjoy what he could until it inevitably left. “Perhaps you should have bought me a dog sooner?”
Sherlock was shuddering in arousal when John looked up at him, face, chest and stomach a mottled, dark pink, “
, Christ, Sherlock… like that, yes.” John hissed between gritted teeth as his hips twitched to push himself through the ring of Sherlock’s long fingers.
John moved to meet him halfway, straightening his spine and leaving the tiniest space between their bodies before gently, and almost tenderly, placing a hand on Greg's cheek. He waited a moment, checking that Greg wasn't flinching, grimacing or going to back out, then leaned in and softly placed a light, pecking kiss on his lips. It was dry, chaste, as innocent as kisses could get, but already John was craving more.
curious.” The dog played with the stick a little bit, chewing, nipping, and pouncing on it, and then crushed it between his teeth, bringing it back again to sit with his panting tongue hanging from his mouth as he waited.

He paused at the side of the bed and then reached out, deliberately unhurried, to take Sherlock’s nearest wrist in hand, “Come now, surely it’s
In the beginning, when John had been unused to what Sherlock needed, confusion had arisen by Sherlock's un-aroused state. They'd spent ages the first time kissing and touching one another, John himself had been hard as a rock, leaking steadily into his bottoms, but Sherlock had been more or less entirely limp. It took a few times, and some awkward conversations, before he'd figured it out. Realised Sherlock was different, of course. He didn't work the same way as John. He needed to be brought to hardness with a love and care, the things Sherlock was always so embarrassed about. John had no qualms in doing it then and none now, months in to their change, their growth.
“Done
. Spend all night kissing, if you like, to be honest. Or we could go further and bring in some touching? Start slow. That’s only if you wanted to go that far tonight.”

John felt a little like he was going to topple over and made a grunting noise as he got steady onto his feet, pushing a hand through his hair, “Yeah. Yeah, okay...” he replied, looking up at the bunch of mistletoe with a deep jerky sigh and heading to the bathroom.
“Sprouts.”

John’s eyebrow rose in the way it did when he was amused but also annoyed and he pulled away with a chuckle, “I’m sure Mrs Hudson will be bringing those in once the icing’s done.”
“You can,” Sherlock told her, not wanting to let go of John now he had hold of him again. It was a scary feeling, and he wondered vaguely if it was bad, if other people felt the same way as he did. Was it usual? Was this what caused people to act as deluded as they do? This feeling of constant, greedy, obsessive, possessive want?

John smirked around his coffee cup, wondering if he should lie, and nodded, going for the truth, for now, “
The ends of Sherlock’s mouth twitched tersely and he first looked down at his knee, then over at Greg with a steady, unreadable gaze, “Your evidence?”

didn’t want to be there. It was pointless.”
It wasn’t until he’d kicked off his shoes, shrugged off his coat, and made quick work of opening the top buttons of his shirt as he made for the kitchen, that he noticed the window in his living room was open. He’d not left that open, had he? Reckless. Too reckless. Despite the decent neighbourhood, he always locked up before he left for work. Had he forgotten? When had he even ever opened the living room windows?
“If it’s just comfort that you’re interested in, not appearances, then wear them and check them out,” Sherlock said, leaning in closer and closer until John couldn't arch back any further. It was then that Sherlock kissed him on the lips gently, eyes flicking sideways to the dreaded pants, therefore missing how hard John blinked at the touch. “I thought you… liked my face?”
! Yeah, they have guns on them! Mafia sharks! Or dolphins...”
John grinned and caught the other end, holding his own towards Sherlock, “On three?”
“No, it’s not a tie,” John said with one of his pleased, amused smirks as he sipped his tea.
John scowled half-heartedly, “Don’t make me say it. You know what I’m trying to say.”
“I don’t do half of my washing.”
“The ones I saw weren't bad. They could hold a tune… mostly,” John told him, following to sit on the arm of Sherlock's chair and lean his arm across the headrest. “And we both now know that it's not the carollers you don't like, not the songs, nor me singing them. You just wanted—"

“Yeah well, I've cut back on the caffeine at work as it was making me too jittery,” John said, letting his arms slip down, watching as they diverted, as if with a mind of their own, to wrap around Sherlock's waist. “I, uh, I
It took John a few moments to undress thanks to his shaking hands and in that time Greg sat Sherlock up to uncuff one of his hands, stretching, rubbing and rolling both arms before pressing him back down to the bed and throwing them limply above his head. The freed wrist was secured again, the link between each cuff seized by Greg’s hand. Sherlock watched through fluttering eyelids, still breathing rapidly. It earned him a rough, stubble grinding nuzzle, cuffed wrists tugged and twisted to elicit a beautiful arch of his back, then Sherlock was kissed, hard, rough, and with some almost palpable passion.
A muffled whimper shook through him in return and Sherlock immediately clutched at him, legs buckling as he took a step forward. John kicked him back by the shins and pinned Sherlock up against the wall with a surge of boiling, churning passion, unsure if it was more anger or arousal that fuelled his movements. It felt good to slam Sherlock back, to crush into him, to feel the thin, taut material of his shirt and the hard, round mounds of the struggling buttons against his naked, burning torso. He knew that this was slightly 'not good,' but John also knew that Sherlock was adept at martial arts and could fight back, could push him away if he truly wanted to stop and John would drop this whole situation.

Sherlock jerked upright, coming close to headbutting John in the chin, “I thought Angelo’s?” he offered, trying to remember where John had taken his dates and which places he’d enjoyed, and then realised he hated remembering anything to do with them and most of the information had been deleted. Heavily and angrily deleted.

– and I didn't even know they had talked!”
“Comfy?” John asked, his breath brushing his ear.
“What...did you have in mind?” Sherlock asked, crossing his legs to rotate his foot, trying to act casual as his heart fluttered. Trying to be more interested in the stone lodged in the side of his shoe than he was in their conversation.
Sherlock made sure to give the road a wide berth for the time being, not sure if Orion would be scared by a passing car and lorry, or worse, eager to chase one, “Let’s go to the park with him.”

cleaning it up,” he said, removing himself from Sherlock's embrace to open the cupboard under the sink cupboard for some marigold gloves, bleach and paper towels, handing them over.
Sherlock flushed and made his glare all the more irked at how carefree and unconcerned his landlady was, “He didn’t kiss me back,” he told her. “Not that I expected him to. I didn’t even
seem confident...” John huffed, wincing as he looked at those bird feet. As he thought about the amount of bleach he'd need to scrub the table with afterward. “She's the turkey equivalent of you. Just needs a long coat and she'll be set.”
John smiled in response, heart surging with strong, dizzying feelings for the silly man who lay blushing beneath him, “Whenever you're ready to tell me. Whatever you want. I'll give it to you,” he promised as he returned to Sherlock's thickening shaft, licking away the first bead of pre-come which had gathered.
“... Perhaps not
boy,” John said. “We love you too.”
“I should have warned you, but you did insist,” John giggled, sweeping a hand through Sherlock's hair, petting and combing and fluffing. “You don't ever have to do it again. - I like the idea of rubbing it into your chest more anyway... making you smell like me...”
John frowned again, "Yeah--"

John glared at him, “
other things. I realise you’ve been struggling with this, but I thought you…” Sherlock stumbled to a stop in the corridor and turned to face John, leaning against the wall with a narrowed gaze. He was still shivering and wouldn't look John in the eye, just stared resentfully at his shoulder. “What is it
“Neither do you,” Sherlock muttered, seemingly fascinated as fabric moved and shifted against the twin expansions, “not with me, in any case.”
Sherlock hummed and gave John a sideways glance, “She’s clean, you know. As clean as a turkey can get. I gave her feet a bit of a rinse down in the bath.”
. But only because of your lips… they're
“He’s still got it,” John said, rubbing his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles again. “Sleeps with it I’m told.”
John groaned, rubbing at his face, and put a card down, “It's not as

overtime trying to find the culprit. Maybe not a fire then.
“Yeah, but it depends on the situation. I think he missed me. Though he won’t admit to it. I was out for most of the day, after all,” John said as he gave in to an unmistakable and hard to ignore urge, gently taking Greg's hand to touch then entwine their fingers. It felt good. Different, yet the same as how it felt when his hand tangled with Sherlock’s. John was glad Greg didn’t comment on the action and only smiled, giving him a squeeze. “If we've been on a long case, I mostly just crash beside him afterwards… not up for the trek back to my bed. He, uh, takes good care of me. Covers me up and…” He let loose a laugh at such a random and unnecessary comment, peering into Greg’s face, trying to gauge his wants, feelings and fears. “Do you… want to watch? See how you feel?”
… but…
, you move around my equipment, you
“Oh I’ll
Sherlock watched for a moment and then glanced again at John’s hand, focused on the weight and warmth of it, the sensation of touch through his layers of clothing. With eager eyes he traced each finger, each knuckle, lingered on the smooth, beautiful, delicate length of bone, veins, and soft, small blond hair which were only barely visible. The urge to touch was stronger than it had been before. He wanted to tuck his fingertips up John’s sleeve, wanted to lean into him, wanted to have John’s arm draped possessively across his shoulders. Wanted to taste, smell, and own every inch of him. John, however, was unaware of his internal struggles and pulled away when Mrs Hudson opened her present with a gasp. Sherlock instantly mourned the loss of John’s hand.
"Stop..."
scream!”
“I don’t want—”
“Sit between my legs, facing me. It’s not that complicated, Sherlock,” John interrupted, spreading his legs a little further as invitation and then flushing at the position. “Sit here, and put your legs over my thighs, at my…my waist. You can do that; your legs are long enough. Come on, before you really get cold!”
!" John barked as he flexed his hips forward, pushing his cock into plush, tensing, squirming buttocks. “I can see that you're flushed, can see the sweat pouring off you... can see that your cock is dripping all down my wallpaper...” He stilled, an idea forming, an almost sadistic joy spitting wildly up within him, and leaned over to whisper in Sherlock's ear. “Maybe I should make you
Sherlock shrugged, thinking about the last time he had seen roses in a murder victims back garden, smeared in brain matter, “I have nothing against roses, nor flowers in general. Many are quite pretty. The types that honey bees prefer are the ones I enjoy the most though, as I get to see...bees.”
? Helpless?
Lowering his hands somewhat to better brace himself, Sherlock exhaled a breathless groan, eyelids fluttering, “Everything… you are not—

Inhaling his own saliva in shock, John coughed and snorted through his nose, holding his cards to his chest, “
"Well, we could always
Sherlock swallowed loudly at that, eyelids lowering, “Don't be ridiculous.That isn’t strictly true,” he said in a mumble. “You are a strong man, John. Strong in mind and in body. In will. I have full confidence that you would be... fine without me.” Reaching up, he pressed several fingers to John’s mouth to prevent protest in a playful mimicry of what John had done to him, and gave a wonky, small smile, shaking his head. “I
“Not quite a locked room case though, is it?” John smirked.
“Orion will be living here, Mrs Hudson. - In fact, you’ll have to dogsit when we’re on a case. We won’t be able to bring him along on every case,” Sherlock told her as he idled, feeling exhaustion descending upon not only his arms but his legs, his head. He wanted to go over to rejoin John, yet he wasn’t sure if he’d stagger or wobble. He hoped not.
! Yes... yes, please..."
“All right, all right,
After another second or so of John staring him down, Sherlock huffed, glanced skyward with exaggerated frustration and then wiggled his bowl, admitting defeat, “
“I don’t have to say it—”
“She certainly is.
? Whose home did you say it was?”
“... Are you naked under that thing?” Greg asked in a casual tone after a small sip of coffee, an eyebrow cocked in deliberate teasing.

. - God, I should kick you down the bloody stairs, but I'd be the daft twat who has to fix you up afterwards.

“Sometimes,” John muttered, his own thumb rubbing at the back of Sherlock’s hand now. “I was nine when they had to put him down. I didn’t understand it for a while, and I kept thinking he’d come back… There are a lot of fond memories I treasure, but he was an old dog in the end.”
, so it's closer to sex than anything I've done in months...”
“Yeah,

. Boring, dull, jumper-clad John. I'm like the moon compared to your sun. You're fire and dazzling, the source of everything. I'm boring and dependable.”
!” Sherlock all but cried out, temples and nape drenched with sweat. It was difficult for him to keep upright. Every time he breathed, shivered, and moaned, his legs would threaten to buckle, muscles tight. “Fuck me… do it, John. Fuh-fuck me!”
Sherlock kissed John’s skin first, sampling a few inches of it and following it up to the glans, then he shyly, timidly, sucked it into his mouth, the wet heat of his curious tongue almost too much for John to bear. He took his time with it all, dragging out every minute motion of his lips, every added bit of suction, every lapping swirling slide of his tongue, all while retaining eye contact with John, cheeks blushing blotchily in the hazy early morning light. It felt surreal, utterly surreal, and John wondered for a moment whether it was, whether he wasn’t just sleeping, dreaming of this. It had occurred before, of course. He’d had many realistic dreams, both horrific ones and pleasurable ones.
“You're not interested by the bells of Jingle kind?” John giggled, having no clue what he was talking about but knowing he had to say something to keep the mood light and in no way thick and awkward and bursting with palpable tension.

lot. I paid him no mind.”
!” Sherlock shouted, loud enough to make Greg wince and laugh at the volume, veins bulging in his throat. He even tried to look down his body at John, no doubt to try and work his charm, but his head was yanked back by Greg’s tight grasp on his hair. It made his length thicken with a jolt. “Please let me.

asking... if Sherlock agrees?”
Nodding again, this time solemnly, John processed the information and then slid from his stool, tripping over his own feet, “M'gonna go home and talk to him. Just... just

out your tongue and cook it for dinner! - And I know how to cook a good tongue.” His lips were inches from John’s ear, marking the sensitive skin with punctuating puffs of hot breath. "Simmer the tongue with spices until tender. Remove the skin and slice. Add a delicious onion and mushroom sauce. Add salt and a pinch of black pepper—"
Christmas songs? Surely?
Walking quietly towards the sofa, John settled on one end Sherlock wasn't and placed the cushion behind his back across his groin, opening his posture in invitation, happy when Sherlock wordlessly turned and lay his head down, “There we are,” John said softly, hands staying away for the moment as he turned on the television, content to let the sounds of the programme wash over them, “You're okay.”
Keeping his eyes on a triumphant and visibly turned on Greg, John thrust his fingers back inside Sherlock, curling them immediately to press hard and fast against his prostate, whilst he reached for his cock again, pumping in a mirroring rhythm. It felt like he’d connected a circuit, each point of contact to Sherlock’s body anchoring them all together in a rush of energy and stimulation. Greg let out a low thrumming sound from deep in his throat and tipped further into and over Sherlock, mouthing unexpectedly at the rapid pulse in his neck and groping at his toned pectorals. He even had one knee up on the edge of the bed now, eager to be participating. John felt himself pulse slickly in his pants at the resulting scrambling. He had to take hold of Sherlock’s waist to pin him in place.
we were together and...” John sighed, rubbing his face angrily, vibrating out of his skin. “Then I...”
. Try to at least.”
Stroking at John’s fingertips, Sherlock gave another shrug, this one looser, slower, allowing their arms to rub together for longer, “We can go to one if you want.”
“Not as thin as I used to be though. It's the late night takeaways that are killing me. I'll start a diet in the new year…
want—I do appreciate the attention," he mumbled. He felt ashamed and unsure and angry, and the fabric of his pants left almost nothing to the imagination. Cock was swollen and glaringly erect, pushing out, deforming the fabric, making his desire incredibly obvious. "And I wouldn't say
“We were
. So scared. She was brilliant and sexy and clever. She was everything I looked for, everything I wanted, she was just my type and well out of my league, so we stayed friends." He exhaled and glanced into his drink again, tilting his head as he reminisced. "I helped her through her break-ups, through heartbreak and rejection. I held her as she cried over the death of her parents. Held her hair back when she was ill. I went to her house all the time. Watched films when she didn't feel like socialising and, when she did, I was there for that too. There when she needed me… it took some time. Years and years. Blind years. But suddenly I realised that we were
Sherlock caught hold of his hand, trapping it there, heart racing beneath John’s arm, “There are others. Other things I like. Other things I...
“Sounds like jealousy to me,” Sherlock mumbled under his breath, though loud enough for John to catch. John sent him a mild glare, finding that a bit ironic coming from him. He watched with bated breath as Sherlock then tasted the elastic, fingered the fabric, and then checked the size. “Not cheap, which is perhaps the most surprising thing compared with anything else. And you
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open, cheeks suddenly aflame with chagrin, “I am
“Same thing,” Greg said dismissively.
you to kiss me.”
“We are not having this conversation—why are you rubbing your face against me?” John frowned, peeking down at Sherlock and getting a nose full of wet curls.
“Yeah,” Greg chuckled under his breath, following after the first tug as John hooked their fingers together loosely and turned off the lights of the living room, walking him slowly to Sherlock’s open door. He allowed time for Greg to change his mind, to both their light hand-holding and the offer of watching. John himself wasn’t even completely sure it was the right thing to do. “I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
Fighting the urge to either throttle the turkey, or Sherlock, he wasn't sure which, John clenched his jaw and jabbed a finger in his direction, “You're talking to a
when its right next to my groin… " John swallowed at his mindless admittance and stared back when Sherlock looked at him, into him. "
Sherlock valiantly tried to hide by curling into a ball, attempting to make himself as small as possible, as inoffensive and forgettable as he could, but John knew the routine. Knew the tears were there, had seen them, had heard the congested, quiet, shaky sniffs as Sherlock discreetly wiped his nose on his dressing gown sleeve. Knew that this was his cue.
“I'm not… I'm just – adventuring around your face, as you did to mine,” John whispered, flushing at his own words and remaining still, only partly aware of his thumbs as they stroked up and down Sherlock's spine, keeping a steady rhythm. “You annoy me too… but it doesn't change anything either. For what it’s worth.”
John leapt from the bed and was over the room in an instant, not worrying about his naked state or the jumbled confusion of his subconscious, instead he grabbed for the shape and pushed it against the wall, one hand around a throat and the other pulled back in a fist, ready to strike.
Crazy Eights. Make it more
Though she could be asking their of them, Sherlock shrugged, flicking his eyes from her cheery reflection to John’s, trying to see what Mrs Hudson had stated, that he really had no intention of leaving. What was she seeing? She was a shrewd, intelligent woman, yet she was a romantic, a foolish person who often let emotion warp her mind. It could be something, it could be nothing. He fixed his whole attention on John, searching for one thing in particular and only that one thing. John didn’t seem to be acting any differently than normal, though he was glancing at Sherlock every so often. More than he normally did, more than Sherlock had caught him doing. In fact, those glances lingered longer than Sherlock would have expected. How had he missed this? Was this it?
, enough of this! Five minutes, remember? Five minutes and I’m
“Really not.”
John barked a short laugh, “Well, you know what they say… It’s not the size… “

“I don’t know,” Greg mumbled around a flickering grin, rubbing at his mouth, the nape of his neck, and then tugging on his buttoned shirt. “What if it gets disruptive? I all but work with you two and...” He exhaled a long breath through his nose and looked again between them. “This
...” John tried to interrupt, but Sherlock was seemingly on a rant now, unable or unwilling to stop his tirade against their landlady who really only had the best – if clumsy – intentions.
Greg shut the bathroom door and the bedroom door, unknowingly, or perhaps knowingly, giving John a perfect view of his still very much invested cock, then got into the bed with Sherlock between them, “I don’t know if you even want it. Or if you will when you actually
considered sex?” Sherlock retorted with a haughty sniff and a defensive straightening of his spine. He waved a swift quivering hand towards John in mocking and pointed at the hard, jutting line of his erection, which John was very unsuccessfully concealing. John felt embarrassment scorch his skin in response. “And I thought you
“Okay, brilliant...yeah. Okay,” John mumbled, feeling sympathetically embarrassed for him, just slightly suspicious, and oddly smug. “Well, I'll go jump in the shower while you order for us then?”
“Or what?” John said, leaning to hide the treat.
“It means you’re
Unfortunately, there was nothing obvious (again), but the landlady had clearly caught sight of the opened envelope as she looked up at Sherlock with a beaming smile and said, “Oh isn’t John
“Thank you,” Mrs Hudson said. “It’s awfully heavy.”
“That’s not

“Then why do it? Why return, again and again, standing there and

There was a banging thump of blatant frustration, something probably being thrown at the door, “
“This isn't a
“Yes, I know, but, um, as I said earlier, he’s a bit loud,” he continued, not letting Sherlock’s heavy sigh derail him, “and if you're not sure you're ready for that, for hearing that, then… maybe you could put the TV on or something? - You're more than welcome to come in and watch though or join in if you feel the urge to. That would be… fine. Right, Sherlock?”
“Go on then,” John said as Orion came back, growling around the stick while John went to tug at it. The dog huffed and snarled in play at their tug of war before he released it and sat for John to pet his head, stumbling over his own feet when the stick got thrown again.
“There’s only fifteen, John.”

Slipping his hand back into Sherlock's curls with a soft soothing hum, John stroked and scratched, threading his digits through each of the curls until Sherlock practically had an afro of brown frizz, before returning to stroke along his throat, his chest and then across his belly and waist. Simply touching and caressing with a purity that John hoped was made all the more wonderful when alongside the gentle sounds of the radio.

“No idea,” Sherlock snorted, solving his wooden puzzle for the fourth time and then slipping it into his pocket.
,” he repeated, lifting and bending his legs up against his torso in blatant invitation. John took it, as he always did, and knelt up to go routing through the bedside drawer for the lube, condoms and tissues, placing them in a neat line and within easy reach of his position on the bed. He enjoyed this part as much as the previous. Greedily savoured the fact he could do it, that he was perhaps the only person to be allowed to do it, or who would ever get the chance. “John…”
Sherlock gratefully hid his face against her sweet smelling neck, “You were right,” he whispered to her as she enveloped them.
am I even telling you this?”
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson,” John said. “Merry Christmas.”
? Are you asking if...” He pointed at himself and quickly between all three of them. “
John faked a laugh and a smile, then rubbed his mouth and chin, “Yeah, that’s true, I suppose. I just – I'm not sure Sherlock is going to go for it—Where is he by the way?”
,’” Sherlock groused, shooting him a heated, eye-twitching glower he dropped his pointing finger and pushed back his hair, gripping and squeezing handfuls of it, before ruffling the large curls at the back in heightened infuriation. “It’s pierced my skull! Stuck… stuck in my head like a jagged shard of glass, that I can't just
“Even when you lecture me? Shout at me? And give me those amusingly sarcastic and rather condescending remarks?” Sherlock asked with a twitch of a smirk, despite somehow enjoying the range of emotion John often displayed. Even if it was anger, he basked in it, in the attention it provided.
The accused Santa laughed a booming, shaking, warm and gruff sort of laugh, a laugh that made John laugh too, and then he shook his head, his greying beard rustling and crumpling softly like ombré coloured candy floss, moving in the air expelled from Santa's mouth and nose, “I think you're

Closing the door behind him and shrugging off his coat, John looked around suspiciously for any more, for anything worse, and then headed up the stairs, noticing more above the top step when he reached the landing. He eyed it, looked at its placement, glanced down the steps, and wondered how on earth Mrs Hudson had managed without falling and breaking her neck, not liking how close it was to the sharp decline when he imagined her balancing on her old rickety ladders. Surely it wasn’t with it just to put up a bit of foliage?

“I noticed,” John said as he stretched, taking particular care of his left shoulder. “Being there’s still good though.”
“You—”
He watched John nod with some delight and then reached down to tap Sherlock’s clavicle with his index finger, signalling him to lean up with a sweeping hand motion. It took a bit, a few seconds or so at least before Sherlock pushed his way through the fog of want that was clearly clogging up his mind. Once he’d moved and shifted enough, Greg took the other arm to handcuff both wrists behind his arching back.
Sherlock gave him a tiny grin in response and angled John’s face again, nosing down to kiss him once more, as if they always did it, as if it wasn’t new, wasn’t awkward and frightening and big, “You can bathe later,” he murmured against John’s mouth.
“Which is why I was so careful about your present,” John said with a reminiscent, mischievous smile as he revealed a soft yet durable duck toy. Sherlock shot him a half-hearted, grouchy glare in response, disgruntled at being so blind and out of the loop for so long.
Not enjoying, fully understanding, or overly liking social interactions such as what was playing out in front of him, the boring go between, the annoying pleasantries, Sherlock turned his attention to the room again. Trying to calm his thundering heart and keep his face still, blank, unassuming, John’s hand in his was a much needed anchor. However, when he had found nothing of interest in the walls, chairs, or scattered leaflets, Sherlock let his eyes go unfocused and reached with his free hand to hook his fingers around John’s wrist, counting each beat, letting it consume him.
“If you keep attacking and
choke. I know how to eat,” Sherlock told him around a cheekful of duck and brussel sprouts, reaching to fiddle with a napkin rather than reach for John’s sleeve, wanting to touch the exposed skin of his wrist. It was getting ridiculous how much he ached to be against John’s warmth.
. Not… not exactly - I’m just a little…
” John moved to kick the door closed and then set about pulling off his shirt, yanking on it in such a zealous rush that the last two buttons pinged across the room to clatter somewhere behind the table. Throwing the crumpled material down, not caring where it landed, John reached for Sherlock again, attacking the long, pale neck with his mouth as he abused and adored the beautiful skin, working with Sherlock's motivated digits to strip the man of his shirt as well. "
“I got the both of you a few presents as well,” Mrs Hudson was saying as she came into the living room after him, which had been made much more festive than their own, with a large tree in the corner, tinsel wrapped around the curtain rail and over mantelpiece, and cards dotted about the room. She set her present down and wandered over to the tree, retrieving a few box shaped gifts and one or two softer ones. “There we are.”
“I like it,” Sherlock murmured hoarsely.
Huffing sharply, Sherlock shot him a glare, “She’s a
“Yes, yes. It's
“If he doesn’t, it’s fine. You...you were the first person he saw, you could just--” Sherlock pressed into John’s back as a whining bark cut him off and a woman with thick framed glasses and vibrant red hair, tied up in a high ponytail, walked through the open doorway, leading an excited, bouncing, sniffing, panting puppy by a blue slip lead. When the pup caught the scent of John, his dark ears pricking as he turned his head in his direction, he went wild with delight.
… but I have yet to find it.”
"What?" Sherlock’s arrogant expression dropped to one of annoyance in an instant. “
“Only in this situation though,” he said around a bark of laughter, becoming more and more at ease with the entire situation now that he’d found something to focus on, something to both bring him closer to them and put him at a distance. “Not when we’ve been on crime scenes. Can’t actually,
want me to want to gag you?” he husked.
“He’s had it for a long while. Six months is effectively 10 years to him,” Sherlock told her. “It would only confuse him if we changed it.”
“I mean… we don't have to do...
“Sit down,
,” John agreed, pumping at Sherlock's weeping cock, gaining courage himself and loosening thoughts he’d normally keep locked back, keep buried, to let them run free over his tongue, “And, uh, as for what, I… I was thinking him in handcuffs over your knee mainly. You spanking him whilst my – whilst I’m in his mouth.” His rhythm stuttered at the thought and he had to take a few breaths, turning his eyes down to the floor, to Greg’s shoe just in view. Once back in control and calmed from the abrupt yearning to see that idea through, right that moment, John returned to his task and caught Greg’s gaze again. “Or tied up against the bed where we can use him again and again and
” he confessed with a dry chuckle, only realising what he'd said, what he'd let out, seconds after it was done. He couldn't take it back. Did he even want to? Why did he have to be drunk or high on arousal to be open?
! She'll be smug. We don't want her smug, do we? - Don't want to... to encourage this behaviour!” he warned.
“Slowly,” John hushed and took Sherlock's hands into his own, guiding him to his jumper, to the peeking fabric of his shirt beneath and began to pull them over his stomach and chest.
"One of my walks, actually," John said. "I had some
“Never again,” John agreed with a firm nod, his own demeanour gaining a sharper edge. It soon vanished, however, when Orion started batting his paws at John’s hands and twisted back onto his stomach.
Putting the paper down under the table he resettled himself in the corner of the sofa and, for a moment, Sherlock thought he’d pushed too far already, but John, beautiful, wonderful John, opened his arms and said; “Come here then.”
“Merry Christmas Ryan,” Sherlock said giving the woman a sneering, triumphant grin as they turned for the door, Orion woofing and bouncing around their feet, ears perked, head tilted. “...
“It’s
“I want to
Sherlock shifted, “You’re angry because he mentioned my being married to my work not
“Oh!” Mrs Hudson cooed.
"Nope."
Wanting to take full advantage of that fact, that rare gift, it didn't take long for John to stumble into the bathroom, get undressed and give himself a good scrub under that nicely steaming spray of heated water, shoulders relaxed, head turned up, eyes closed. He was unable to fully bask in it though, unable to take pleasure in how easily the sweat and smells of the day were being washed away, because he couldn't stop thinking about Sherlock. Not uncommon, not since he'd first met the man. He couldn't stop thinking that Sherlock's reaction had been better than he had anticipated. That Sherlock seemed in good spirits overall. He had been convinced that Sherlock would have gone into a snit, yet instead he'd seemingly loved seeing himself like that. It slightly boggled John's mind. Especially when the pants had led to kissing, kissing he knew he shouldn't really encourage, but kissing that he just couldn't give up, couldn't stop.

“Am I?” Sherlock asked, suddenly self-conscious. Was he?
“Oh, alright then,” Mrs Hudson sighed, brushing her fingers against his as she smiled up at him.
—I can barely contain myself when you
Stepping forward, John shook his head, took Sherlock by the shoulders and squeezed gently, trying to get him to look at him completely, “
icing this time,” he told her, backing out into the hallway and twisting for the stairs.
“Dig in then,” Mrs Hudson said, reaching for the plate of stuffing first.
“Yes… Yeah that's it...” John rambled, turning to press their heads together as Sherlock trembled, seemingly as weak as a kitten as he shivered in John's arms. Without thought,  without any form of hesitation, any pausing thought and sobering realisation, John looped his arms around him and tucked him closer, caressing up and down Sherlock's back, feeling the goosebumps which erupted under his fingers. “Sh, it's alright, you're alright...”
John moaned in response, head falling back and hips thrusting out in an attempt to rub against one of Sherlock’s legs, his cock trapped and sore against the inside of his jeans, “I… I’d like that.
Eyebrows lifting, Greg ruffled Sherlock’s hair with a grin, exhaling in hilarity at the weak scowl thrown his way, “You know as well as I do that you can stop this and probably get out if you wanted to, and, as you said earlier, you’re in

“How does he expect to get away with pretending to be cold then?” Greg remarked, magnetised by Sherlock’s hair once again and ruffling through it with some relish.
"... It was after one of our arguments," John explained. "I don't even remember what it was about any more, just that I thought I might do something I'd regret if I went home."
...mm—We have Chenin Blanc…” he muttered, neck reddening and legs become jittery, one thigh twitching and tensing as he glanced at John for a moment. Sherlock then gestured towards the kitchen with an unsteadily waving hand, the direction he was signalling to vague and hard to work out, especially when John was more preoccupied with how Sherlock looked, how he reacted. He was fascinated. “Or Pinot Noir. We... we have one of them. I… uh… I don’t really recall which one we have. I bought one of them for… for something… yet I can't remember if I used both, neither or one over the other.”
"I'm glad you agree--"
Sherlock looked over the gifts, putting the lead amongst them and touching the rim of one of the bowls closest to him, “Thank you, Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock shook his head, “There is not always a need for a dog.”
relevant to you?” John grumbled rhetorically, unable to stop his gaze as it dropped once more to where they were pressed together. “…You’re not so small yourself, you know—God, this is…not what I thought we’d end up doing when I agreed to travel halfway across the northern countryside with you. What are we here for again? Was there even a reason? I honestly can’t remember.”

Sherlock’s glare was turned on him, “What’s that suppose to mean?”
“Are you going to ask after me the
boy.” The pup glanced at him, tongue lolling out the side of his open mouth, and after another whimpering whine, he sat down, panting. “
John felt a stab of dismay, but tried not to show it, after all, what had just transpired hadn’t been half bad, “Of course not. We're not going to hold it against you if you feel its not for you,” he promised, “I still value our friendship more than I want your knob.”
Sherlock's throat worked roughly, "And... and I still don't see how you can blame

asking for lists. Christmas lists, birthdays lists, shopping lists. You are told what is necessary, what is wanted, what others would like, what they think they need, and you pick and choose what to get them from that knowledge, written and gathered alike,” Sherlock pointed out with a scoff. “It’s rare you know

Greg gaped at him for a full minute, maybe more, before he found his voice again, “You... you and Sherlock are...” he murmured, signalling between them and then making a rather crude, if comical, motion with his fingers. Greg looked dumbfounded if a bit elated as if he'd just won the lottery. “
“Well, you do prattle on sometimes,” John chortled nervously, his breathing a bit faster in the small space between them as he responded to Sherlock with a tensing of his thighs and an adorted twitch of his hips. “You…like to hear yourself talk and I just…just let you…natter on.”
," he grumbled and twirled his finger around, eyebrow arched. "Front."
Sherlock huffed and clenched his jaw at another onslaught of shudders, “Th-the weather is a force of nature, John. There is hardly a s-set pattern to such forces. They merely happen and whatever—”
…. you know?” John found himself stammering in a nervous ramble, feeling sick in shock and shaking with an uncontrollable mixture of fear and elation. “I mean… if its up there… we could do it again? It's what Mistletoe is for?”
Sherlock, after initially flinching at the noise she had made, blinked widely, trying to fight off the oncoming sleep that had crept, unbeknownst to him, over his mind and through his body in the short moments previously, and lifted his head, “Mrs Hudson,” he half slurred. “Don’t start...”
“Fancy a game of cards?” John asked, smiling tightly as Sherlock popped his head up from behind his laptop screen. “We can gamble?”
. A bit.
“’What would you do if I
“Definitely,” John nodded, trying to smother the bubble of laughter floating up his throat, tickled and endeared by his stammering. Flattered by his unmistakable open-minded curiosity. “It's, um, a safe place, as they say. - I'm happy for you to kiss me, if you want to try? More than happy, actually. But don't feel pressured and if it's not for you, then it's fine, it's not going to massively affect our friendship. We're not going to
That's going to be in my wank-bank for years... ”
"They're not open on Christmas Day," John said, his voice laced with a giggle.
John nearly whimpered in sympathy, knowing how utterly frustrating it must be to stop whilst on the very edge of bliss, and had to admit that Greg was surpassing all fantasies, “He hasn't come for two days. He's desperate,” John whispered gutturally, fixated on Greg, “Can practically feel how much he needs to come. - I've never felt his cock so hard…”
," Sherlock muttered in raising irritation and knocked their noses together, eyes narrowing and lips turning down into a crumpled pout. "It's
“Obviously,” Greg mimicked with a roll of his eyes, crossing his legs in a very accurate impression of the pompous man. “Perhaps you should have a coffee too then? Warm yourself up? - Though I’ve got to say, it’s perfectly warm in here, warmer than outside, at any rate.”
of things in my life, but being a turkey transphobe is a new one...”
Humming huskily, Sherlock tipped John’s head so the next kiss was deep, was wet, was hot, yet stopped, tensing with disgust and amusement, when there was a moist, squelching splat, “She just defecated on the floor…” he muttered, turning his head in unison with John to look at the innocently blinking turkey, who was still pecking at her food dish, a fresh clump of feces behind her. “At least it was on the tiles and not one of the rugs?”
, Mrs Hudson?”
. No, no, no, no, no,” Sherlock told him and swatted to push his jaw closed and then pinch his lips together. “
...” John mumbled and gestured at Sherlock, trying to look at him, trying to stare at his mouth, at his eyes, at the expression on his face. Trying not to give too much away. He could barely hear himself talk over the relentless beating of his heart. Something was building. There was anticipation in the air and John wasn’t sure how to feel about it, how to react. He was terrified. “He's not comfortable with it, so we'll take them down. I appreciate what you were trying to do but… he's

Flushing hot in the face, unprepared for John to have succeeded in doing something behind his back. For the situation and the resulting embarrassment, Sherlock narrowed his eyes, watching John penetratingly, “You think I’ll like it—
…” Sherlock continued, staggering to lean against John’s armchair in uncontrollable hysterics. He pointed again and then tried to explain with some rapid hand movements and choppy, incoherent words, unable to stop, unable to even stand.

"Get me horny? Yeah, well... it worked, you...
“Let him be for a moment, I've coaxed him to drink when he was exhausted and barely conscious many times,” John laughed, pushing himself from the bed, cupping his genitals, and hesitating.
“You can touch… any part of… of me that you want,” Sherlock whispered, staying as still as he could, shaking and twitching and heavily breathing, until he seemed to get bored with it, impatiently so, and pushed back into John’s hands, rocking his hips. The underside of his buttocks and the hot shape of his tensed scrotum, skimmed John’s thighs. “
Growling huskily, Sherlock gave John a weak glare, “
“I’m fine--”
Greg blinked, then smiled in reply, “Fine, I will,” he said, then poked Sherlock away. “Now bugger off. I want to eat my Tikka Masala in peace.”
Sherlock moved to rest their brows together, “She probably expects you

“You’re talking about the

He pushed off from his chair and just about managed to hang his coat, scarf and gloves over a radiator, his shoes thudding down beside the fireplace, before he rubbed at his face, staring at his reflection in the mirror. He looked overwhelmed. He felt overwhelmed. He wanted Sherlock. He wanted to not want Sherlock. “

John’s grin softened into a smile, “I didn’t know you knew Greek mythology.”
“You’re both
Sherlock arched his back with a judder of his hips, “Chenin Blanc is the white… so… so if… if we have that then there is… is no…
This time, when Sherlock tilted his head and opened his jaw for a deeper, thrusting kiss, John felt a fizzle of responding want, an overpowering rush, and like that morning, despite everything he had berated himself for, had panicked about, he gave into it all, gave himself up for more heartache and trouble. Submitted to his base instincts and interests. He kissed back, pushed close, and bumped Sherlock against the door frame, knowing that the poor man would probably bruise tomorrow, but somehow wanting that, eager to be the cause of that. John couldn't and wouldn't stop, not now, and avidly pushed a hand into Sherlock's hair, groaning as he took over, took control and moved them, pressing him up against a wall beside the door.
“Amazing…” John whispered, inches away from Sherlock’s ear.

you,” John whispered into Sherlock's ear, biting and sucking marks into his pretty, flushed neck while he grabbed at his shirt and pulled, sending the buttons flying as they gave up the fight. The sounds they made, connecting with the wall, the floor, and his nearby wardrobe, only spurred John on. He pulled the shirt open and down, exposing Sherlock's spasmodically expanding chest and trapping his corded arms by his side by the elbows. “Can I? I want to fuck you into his wall and make you
Adding a little more lube to the stiff latex-clad line of himself, John shuffled further into position, tangling their legs together and bending an arm up as a pillow so he could be closer, have them touching from top to bottom as much as physically, humanly possible. His other hand reached down to align his cock, feeling the heat of Sherlock through the condom as he tentatively touched the tip against the puffed stretched rim, sliding in with tiny increments. He reached around halfway inside and held onto Sherlock's stomach, anchoring and altering them both for an easier glide.
“No, do it now,” Sherlock told her, a he looked at John’s hand too and wringed his fingers together, wanting to touch, to press back into it somehow. He knew he could. Their relationship had changed, he was allowed to touch and kiss John if he wanted now. The mere thought made him dizzy.
up for some experimentation,” he responded with a dip of his chin, beaming as Orion trotted over, panting and happy and sitting beside them as if proud to call them his.
been ashamed or uncomfortable to be linked with you. That’s not why I respond as I do… I...”
John cackled, stepping back and away to really look at Sherlock, which only set him off again, “Oh for Christ's sake, they're carollers, they're not

“What?
“Yeah, first man,” John replied with a laugh of his own, “He was all stubbly the first time we kissed too. It was strange, but not as off-putting as I expected it might be. In fact, it was, um, somehow
“I did nothing of the sort!” Sherlock gave her a small smile, watching her glower soften.
“And he's not my boyfriend,” John thought he should add, reaching up to stroke a thumb across Greg's cheekbone and stubble, scraping his nail over several strands of it with a fizz of excitement, “It’s not like you need his permission to kiss me.”
“Well… he likes… how you smell?” John said, his eyes wandering around the room, though they ultimately landed on him again.
“You’re most welcome dear,” she said, patting his cheek lightly before heading off towards the kitchen and leaving them both on their own.

adeptly. Conforming perfectly to every line, every bump and lump.” He chuckled briefly and then looked at him, cheeks still red, fingers curling and pulling him so he was standing between Sherlock's spread legs. “You fill them well.”

Leaving an unperturbed Sherlock, John slipped into the bathroom as he heard her arrive and made a show of flushing the toilet, washing his hands, and padding to with surprised smile, "

, I'll try not to squeal too loudly when you accidentally cause some nerve lesions then,” John groused, yet he was already relaxing into the sofa, indulging in the sensation of Sherlock's hands on him. It was incredibly comforting, to have Sherlock's weight against him – his hands on his body – his breath on his neck, it was as if John was surrounded by him. It made him feel safe. Made him feel warm. Made him feel stronger things that he daren't look too deeply at, even if he should. Even though he already knew about them.
