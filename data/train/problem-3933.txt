They go to the Ave, lunch that bleeds into them returning to his apartment, with purpose. She's cute, okay to talk to. Being down there had distracted him, though, reminded him of going out with Cas and his friends, so he brings her to his room. That reminds him of Cas, too, passed out in bed with him so recently, and he pushes the thoughts away, forcing himself to focus on her in the present. His phone buzzes so he silences it, and uses the pause to try and clear his mind. Succeeds for a bit.
“What? Are you angry that I can do it, too?” I yell at him, too drunk to care about the people stopping and staring.
“And then the three of them trapped Lucifer, the biblical Devil, in a cage in Hell. After being resurrected by God himself. And from then on, the Winchesters had an Angel on their rolodex. Time was we had never even heard of such things.” Bruce raises his eyebrows, as if to say,
There was that conversation about her Dean in Hell and the first mention of angels; there were those quiet talks between the brothers, but they always ended in wordlessness. This had always been her life, knowing only small snippets of the case before her boys came back to clean their wounds and rest, and then it was no longer relevant. But with such enormous stakes and so much going on, she feared she might never know the full story. If at some point her boys never made it back to her— she shook off the thought. They always had.
Castiel exploded, and all Baby could do was watch, her dashboard gauges flipping back and forth in a frenzy.
"Are you sure you want this?" he asks, to which I reply by groaning, nodding, and rolling my hips involuntarily all at once.
Cas looks at Dean apologetically, and sighs. He mumbles something to Dean that he can’t make out, so he shakes his head to indicate he doesn’t know.
"Man, that's bullshit, I'm sorry," Dean replies. Cas just inclines his head. "What would you study if you could?"
As he watches the opposite side of the table rearrange their cups, he feels the back of a hand on his elbow. He turns to find Cas trying to keep two cups upright and smiles. Cas is here!
As I head back into the bar, I notice Jo and Gabe sitting together in one of the booths. Gabe’s denim jacket is around her shoulders, and our pile of coats and purses is on the bench opposite them. I ignore my friends, hoping they won’t notice me. I don’t want to be around anyone right now.
“That is extremely bad for you, you know.” Cas has never before lectured Dean on his cigarette habit, so Dean's not offended; he's right, anyway.
"I would really enjoy continuing our conversation." Those earnest blue eyes. How could Dean say anything but yes?
This had been the second time: Trench, hanging there just out of range. She nodded, and they waved back, and that was as much of an update as she got.
Dean shakes his head and smiles as Cas walks out of the lecture hall. He can't quite tell, but he thinks that was an attempt at a joke. What a weird guy.
Dean pulled her over, alone in the front seat, and Baby could feel him tight in the shoulders. He answered the ringing phone. Click.
Who knows. Maybe she was just letting her feelings for Trench bleed into how she thought Dean felt about Ca— Wait, no, her friendship with Trench. Her deep friendship with Trench making her read into the intense gazes their respective owners shared. That was it. Maybe Lisa really was the one, and Baby just couldn’t see it.
And then silence falls upon us once again, and I stare off into the moonlight—which is very quickly becoming sunrise. Colors are lazily thrown across the sky, lighting up our suburban wasteland. We’re all in shades of orange and pink now, the both of us.
Before Dean can freak out too much, Cas stands again and gestures to him. With a nod, Dean rises and follows Cas to the other group, joining the half-circle of people on the floor and couch. A few people are passing around a bong, and Cas nudges one of them, claiming it for himself and taking a hit. Dean just watches, time in slow motion. He knows how ridiculous his thoughts are right now, but he also can’t seem to control them, or give a shit. Cas looks really, really good— his shirt isn’t quite covering his midriff from when he sat down, and without a jacket he’s surprisingly fit, and his hair shouldn’t look good in that state but it does, and his mouth shape right now is giving Dean very bad ideas.
Cas comes in the door of the library just as Dean is putting his bag down. Dean rushes to the door of the group room and waves him over silently but enthusiastically. Cool down, Winchester.
“Woah, tiger. That doesn’t mean you have to go right now.” Dean chuckles. “I have class this afternoon. Shouldn’t we wait a few days and make this a weekend thing?”
“Well, Gabe heard that there might be a house party down the hill, and Meg is seeing if one of her Sisters gets back to her with details of another option. Basically, we’re going with the flow.”
Dean has been grumbling for the past few miles as he drove home. Apparently the Leviathans have doubled as Sam and Dean, Impala and all, and gone on a killing spree; the brothers have been advised to tarp her until the news coverage stops. Dean knows it’s the best thing to do—Baby even sees the sense in it, though it disappoints her—but he won’t stop complaining under his breath about it. Sam has long since grown annoyed, and is riding quietly in the passenger seat, reading and blocking Dean out.
Lydia sets up camp next to Dean, leaning into him slightly. He turns instead to the left, towards Cas.
"Harley's." I reply, instead of, “You just kissed me and now you're pretending like it didn't happening, so what are you doing?” Like I should.
Dean looks up at me and immediately stops dead in his tracks, scanning me, his eyes going over my body from my head to my toes.
Here he hesitates for a second, letting Cas adjust, but apparently it’s too long because Cas brings Dean down with a hand on the back of his neck. Their lips crash together violently, and Dean resists slightly, pulling back a small distance. He locks eyes with Cas, then closes them again as he leans in for a series of sweet kisses. Cas sighs, hand pressing harder on Dean’s neck, and Dean obliges.
"Alright, acknowledged," the prof drawls dismissively, turning away from Dean. "I'd like the class to know that they should never feel intimidated, if they have questions, to ask them. Ask them of my TA, I mean. I'd also like them to know," he says, shooting his eyes once more in Sunglasses' direction, "that if they want to sleep they can do so in my TA's sessions, not in mine." The class gives him an obligatory laugh and the lecture continues.
“Don’t worry, you old man. They’re all cool.” Claire checks in with the table that yes, they are in fact cool. She shrugs. “We were actually just discussing your greatest hits.”
“Hi!” she says cheerily, patting Dean’s head as she turns to Cas. “I’m Charlie. You must be Dean’s new friend.”
"What the fuck is wrong with you? Crazy bitch!" I could almost hear my father shaking with rage, his voice deep and menacing.
Eventually, I manage to find something we all like, shoving the cassette into the player and slumping back into my seat. As soon as the first tinny notes ring out in the car, Meg’s hand goes to the player, holding down the fast forward. Jumbled sounds rush past until she hits the second song on the track.
Baby all but screeched to a stop; Dean banged his hand lightly against her dash, and she was reminded to start again.
"Y'know," Dean starts, breaking the silence, "When I was a kid, there was this thing in the attic, like this metal pole."
Cas doesn’t read anything yet, though, bright eyes still on Dean, and Dean can’t help himself. Screw just friends. He takes the stack of notecards from Cas’ hands, drops them on the ground, and puts a hand on the man’s chest, pushing slightly. Cas falls back easily, and Dean follows.
He doesn’t often need a car, but when he does he really misses his Impala back at home. Being the family car, it’s not like he could have exactly taken it with him, and parking would’ve been expensive, anyway. Still, it would’ve been perfect for this little road trip. Cas’ car is fine, he guesses. Except for the fact that it’s a fucking
I stand up, glass shattering onto the floor. There’s a shape moving along the wall—a shadow, speeding across it. I spin around wildly, but it always moves out of my vision before I can see its identity.
"What happened last night that's got you so giddy?" his roommate asks, a teasing suggestion in his tone.
"Cut it out!" she groans, poking me back, but she's laughing, too. "I told you, he's gross and creepy!"
“I’ll do it,” she eventually said, before taking a gulping breath of air and diving down into the water, her feet kicking around where our knees were, propelling her further down.
The table is filled with laughter from everyone, once more, as well as a few 'oooooooh's, except for Gabe, who has gone dead silent.
“How could you tell?” There’s a pleasant glow around him. I can see the air vibrate near his mouth when he laughs.
She looked out at the dark road, remembering a murmured conversation Dean had held with himself last week as Sam had slept cradled in her passenger seat. The words had been too soft to hear over her mechanisms, but it had seemed almost reverent. What she wouldn’t give to know exactly what Trench knew…
"You know, we can't be all that surprised. Mary had been suffering from depression for a long time. She was a very unstable woman."
The way Dean drives her to Cas is a wild thing. She's not surprised at this point; this is the way they are about each other, and it warms her engine. That's not the only reason she's happy, though. She's so close to seeing Trench again, and that always puts her in a good mood. It gives her extra energy to gun it, and soon she's screeching to a halt in front of an apartment building, and Dean and Sam leap out, slamming her doors to run into the building. She waits, humming.
They drive, and she falls into the rhythm of a hunt. Goes through the motions. The two work easily around each other, she can’t help but note. She’s happy about that, in a detached way. That’s about as happy as she can be nowadays.
“Be right there,” Cas shouts towards the door, and goes over to where his shirt is, tugging it on. He looks back at Dean and gives a small wave, then disappears out of the room.
"Sorry, I shouldn't have written that. I'll rip the page out." I say hastily, flipping back to where I mentioned Dean's mother. It was a stupid idea.
“Bottom of the ninth, and you're the only guy left on the bench... Sorry, but I'd rather have you, cursed or not.”
“Dean?” I knock on the window when I reach the car. As it rolls down, I see Dean in the driver’s seat, one hand on the wheel, with Meg riding shotgun.
She offers Dean a beer, which he takes with a nod of thanks, and simultaneously puts a cider in Cas' chair's cup holder. Cas turns to glare at her.
“Yes. I forgive you. It’s not like we were together, and I was unfair to put all these silent expectations on you and then expect you to follow through on them. Although,” and here his voice turns serious, “if you ever do cheat I’ll throw you out on your ass.”
Dean starts walking again, into the sand, with me trailing behind him. He throws his arms up into the air.
Now that she thinks about it, she can’t really justify her response. It just feels wrong, but not for any reason, per se. Tall, dark, handsome, and annoying.
Zachariah had never been his favorite uncle. “Like a fat Scrooge” Cas said, and Dean had to chuckle. He had answered, curtly, about his tests and essays. But like a cat after cream, Zach kept up the questions, asking his major as they brought out the pies and accompaniments.
They investigate a preschool, they return. Baby can’t get the image of Trench walking the road out of her mind, but that isn’t really much of a change from her normal thoughts. She must’ve imagined it. Maybe Dean saw something else to make him back up.
Cas' eyes are all the way open, after what seems like ages. He turns his head to Dean and shit, he caught him looking... but Dean really doesn't feel bad about it. He gives a lazy smile and then looks over at the fire. And if they lean into each other, if they are the only two mumbling into each other's personal space about Cas' theory on the edges of the sky and
"It was like a support beam or something- Sam and I used to swing around on it all the time, pretend we were fire fighters and all that, and that pissed my dad off." Dean stops to yawn. "So he told us- he said that if it broke or bent or anything, the whole house would fall down."
I know I shouldn’t do that to Meg, and every bone in my body is screaming, begging me not to make her part of Dean’s game. I continue with this begging and screaming as I walk over to her, pull her off of the couch, and kiss her. She gives a small gasp of shock, breathing in quickly before leaning into the kiss, into me. Her lips taste like cherry; like mint and everything else I ever imagined they would taste like. I carefully open my eyes to look past Meg and her beautiful face, to the corner of my vision. Dean’s hands have dropped by his sides, and he ignores the schoolgirl on his lap, favoring staring at me kissing Meg, a sort of shock in his eyes. I grin to myself, knowing that I’ve beat him.
“So just eat shit!” Jo lets out, breathing deeply. Silence punctuates her rant as Meg does nothing to retaliate. We all just stand and stare at each other, wondering what’s supposed to happen next.
"Not a problem," the recipient drags out as he turns halfway to retrieve it while fumbling with something in his lap.
It’s a surprise when Dean deposits Trench back into her trunk the next day. For what reason? Baby doesn't really care, though, because at least Trench is back. This is another chance to talk about what’s hovering over them, the words neither of them want to say to clear the air. Well, Baby doesn't know if she’ll take this opportunity, doesn't know if she had the guts, but either way it's nice to see Trench again.
Meg smiles, an unhappy expression, and walks into the apartment. The moment she sees Charlie behind him, he can see her hackles raise even more.
“Jesus Christ, Cas, are you okay?” Jo grabs my arm, a concerned look on her face. I jump back at her touch. A hole has burnt through my sleeve, singed fabric exposing my skin. Jo’s hand is black and blistered, the blotches spreading up her arm, her neck, her face. Her blonde locks disintegrate, leaving only the smell of burning hair.
“And how will you work? You’ve always wanted to be a working woman, Hannah, but you can’t do that on your own and with a baby.”
Sam looks me up and down. "It's better than Captain Dickhead over there." He nods toward Gabe, who does a doubletake of feigned distraught.
Baby just stews for a second, but tries not to let it show. If she has Ove captive, she might as well get some answers. It’s been a long time, but his association with Trench still prickles a little.
“Stop it. Right now. Cas, Hannah. Rooms. Now.” My mother issues curt orders, pulling my fuming father away from me and forcing him into a seat at the kitchen table.
to text me the second he entered my house." She smacks her hand back down and squeezes his shoulders, glaring playfully at his head.
I flick the lamp off, watching the lightbulb flicker for a second, before collapsing into itself. It's not like I haven't tried to fix it, i just haven't successfully managed, yet. Yet.
Dean isn’t sure if Cas is gonna return, and he’s not sure if maybe Cas had asked him if he needed help home, and Dean had said no. He knocks his head backwards to rest on the wall, and sits staring at the ceiling for a few minutes. Then he goes over to the group on the other couch to figure out his way to his dorm.
He knew this was too good to become anything, that he fucked up and Cas is just figuring out the best way to tell him it’s over before it’s began. Just study buddies, thanks.
"Nothing like you're thinking," Dean states, schooling his expression and setting down the pot. He takes a sip, and although it tastes horrible, it helps rid Dean of the fuzz in his head. "Anyway, I gotta get to class. You can have the rest of the pot."
“Okay,” I state blandly, refusing to look him in the eye as I hurriedly rush around the room, tidying things away to avoid having to look at him.
We’re sitting by the stairs behind Harvey’s, watching Gabe desperately try to dislodge his head from between the railings of the banister. Some guy in the club had bet him $20 that he couldn’t, then abandoned him after he got stuck. He’s an idiot, but I feel bad for him sometimes.
Dean stops dead in his tracks at the sound of my voice. He turns to look at me and stays still as I walk towards him, until we’re standing face to face.
I cautiously enter the bedroom. It looks just like it did last time. I lean over and open the bedside drawer.
“No, she did mean it” She takes another swig of her beer before putting her head between her hands. “I just didn’t think she would ever have the guts to tell me.”
“First of all, I’m a young, under-aged 20-year-old.” Dean drags himself to sitting as he addresses the back of Benny. “Second, I never got to do any sort of stereotypical college stuff at community college, so I gotta make up for lost time. And third, I’m not even worried.”
“This.” He hands Dean a bomber jacket that’s been neglected in the back of his closet. “I’ll be in the kitchen.”
. Faux-offended, high and mighty. She feels exposed, because Trench knows she cares about this topic.
“I’ve been wondering ever since that night a couple weeks ago when we played never have I ever. And then on Halloween you guys were acting super-weird. A while after you left, I drove home too, and gave this girl Eva a ride home—her house is a block away from yours—and passed your house. I saw Dean climbing out, figured it was nothing special, but then you leaned out, too, and kissed him. I damn near drove into a fire hydrant.” She gives a small laugh. “After that, it was obvious. You two shared all of these looks and sideways glances, and you’d make goo goo eyes at each other.”
Everyone laughs, Claire and Alex in a different way than the rest of the table. Yeah, Castiel is practically her father, and also wearing her dead father, but she’s not gonna drop that trump card, probably ever. Plus her mouth is full of burger right now. Not to be outdone, Kendall goes next.
It's been a long month, a stretch of time that feels like years, but the years haven't dulled anything. Everything is hazy, grey, except for the sharp red pain that lives inside her.
with him and hoarding the ice cream she insisted on bringing. The Imperial Walkers have just appeared on screen, so he doesn’t hear his apartment door bell the first two times it rings. It’s only when it rings a third time that he hears the tone.
The biggest thank you of all to the new mods of the DCBB, Jojo and muse, who are doing a great job at managing everything and being the only reason we even have a DCBB. No idea how they do all this and keep sane, I’m guessing crystal meth.
I find what I’m looking for in the form of Dean’s leather jacket, desperately cradling it in my arms as it melts. Gabe is grabbing me, his touch burning just as much as Jo’s. I spin around and my fist collides with his nose, and I hiss and scream as my hand turns red with blisters. Gabe is swearing and holding his face in black hands. Other people have started to notice the commotion, grabbing me with hands clad in yellow rubber, and I desperately shove them away, clinging to the leather jacket. I burst through the door, cold air soothing my burns.
Dean clears his throat, tries to laugh it off. “Nothing, just saw my friend out here and came to say hello.”
"That's it, really." I shrug, putting my hands under my armpits to avoid the cold. "So if you're just doing all this to get a kick out of it, just stop."
“You got what you asked for, Dean. No paradise. No hell. Just more of the same. I mean it, Dean. What would you rather have? Peace or freedom?”
So when a Trench-clad person casually slipped into the passenger seat, Baby was more than surprised. She could feel the confidence from the coat, and knew that this was Castiel without a doubt, not Jimmy.
"I'm using my brain, Cas, and my brain wants me to blow you." The seduction in Dean’s green eyes shines through the holes in his mask.
I stare out at the rows and rows of identical houses, like a never ending treadmill of suburban homes. As far as I can see, in every direction, houses are strewn like mountains, some with different-colored doors, and some with cracked paint, but all the same at their core. A beige house with a brown roof and a five-and-a-half foot fence surrounding the perimeter. Everyone I’ve ever been friends with, shared a class with, sold me something, has lived in a house that looks exactly like this. Most still do. No matter what makes us different or unique, we all have a rock that is one of those houses. I know that to my right, if you were to ever escape the labyrinth of houses, you would reach Boardwalk. The New Jersey Shore. And behind me, if you could escape that way, you’d find Salem, and the Delaware river, and something that would resemble civilization.
“Did I know what?” I ask carefully. I need to tread cautiously around this situation. Mess up one word and this whole thing could blow up.
If you bend a kid, they will break, no matter how many times you swear that it is only making them more flexible.
Since he's moved here, Dean has quickly become accustomed to the high density of weed, but is still sometimes amused by the whole subculture. Different strains, different highs, different ways to smoke... it's not really his scene. Some booze and a pack of cigs is enough of a party for him; simple and straightforward.
During the course of Cas’ story it had become clear that he needs a friend, not some creep who crushes on him from up close, so Dean’s resolved to be just a friend. And what a friend needs right now is a distraction. But then he worries that is verging into date territory, and pulls back.
Are contact highs real? Cause this room is not well-ventilated, and Dean is feeling something or other— less heady than the cigarette, something in the area of his chest. Cas’ eyes are back on him, and the light from the TV makes them shine…
Call her cowardly, but now that the high emotions have settled, she’d rather just enjoy Trench’s company for what it’s worth.
“Nuh-uh! I totally can, watch!” Hannah stepped towards the edge of the small wooden pier. She carefully leant forward, calculating her moves in her head, before turning around, grinning at me, and jumping off of it. She spun in the air, doing a—slightly clumsy—backflip before landing in the water with a splash and spraying me with foam.
He says something lewd in response, and, well, maybe she didn’t misjudge. But she’s still happy that she can finally quiet that niggling voice in the back of her head; she knows now that Trench feels something too—they must—and it gives her a strange courage. She’s waffled for too long, and it’s the easy way out.
It’s Cas. Speak of the freaken devil. Dean rests his head against the door. Why is he here? To have this awkward conversation in person? Why— to see the look on Dean’s face? Or maybe to continue what they started last night? He clicks Cas in, and his heart gets a nice workout as he waits for the man to reach his floor.
Trench curled their lapels inward and paused again. Just when Baby was sure they wouldn't speak, they began:
“You don’t need to tell me,” Benny says as Dean picks up their empty bowls and retreats to the kitchen. “Just be your charmin’ self and you’ll have no problems.”
Cas blows the smoke out, his head tilted back, and the curve of his neck— Dean really needs to stop looking.
They hug—Cas a little stiff as always, Chuck trying and failing to look at ease—and step away. Dean laughs internally. Like father, like son, he supposes. He comes forward to shake Chuck’s hand.
I sob for minutes, hours, years, I can’t even tell, with the gun under my chin, finger on the trigger.
“I don’t want to be another Tommy Reynolds." I sigh, my legs going weak all of a sudden. "I don't want to be some uncertain kid you blow just to get him to shut up."
“Damn, Superman, you’ve got game.” Meg gives me another smile. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go get another beer.”
“Well, what I wanted to say hinged on the fact that you were actually into Cas, but since you’ve clearly moved on…”
I squeeze in next to Dean, who moves down on the tiny couch, barely making a difference and leaving us still pressed against each other.
She and Trench look at each other. There’s so many things to say, but now that they’ve said what’s important, everything else feels ancillary. There will be time. There will always be time. If Baby’s learned anything since she’s met Trench, it’s that Cas and Trench will always return to her. Even through death, apparently; death cannot stop true love, as Dean is fond of quoting. She has to say it's proved very true.
“No,” Dean replies forcefully. “Now is good.” He gives Chuck a strong look and they end up through the doorway, Chuck running around trying to put things in better order.
“Oh,” Dean stalls. He guesses he shouldn’t’ve assumed Cas would want him to come, anyway. This is a personal thing, and they’re not more than study friends. Good friends. Friends that occasionally make out. “I guess you’re all set to go, then.”
Meg and I separate slowly, as I keep my hands on her waist. Trying to get back at Dean or not, kissing her is amazing, and I mentally kick myself for only ever doing anything romantic when it’s for my own selfish desires.
Our eyes all widen as Jo’s voice hits a crescendo, becoming more shrill as she continues. Meg’s face is filled with hurt, as we all become suddenly aware that the joke is very much over.
The flick of their lapel… Did Trench gain a sense of humor when they were resurrected? Were they teasing her? Baby’s temperature gauge ticked up, flustered.
A cheating father, heartless mother, pregnant daughter, psychotic son, and a partridge in a goddamn pear tree.
Dean waves his hand, dismissing the issue. “We get it. I guess. Um,” he turns to Cas, “I’m gonna give you guys some space, is that alright?”
I try to catch my breath, gasping for air as I laugh uncontrollably. Dean is still leaning over me, his face half a foot from mine, his arms supporting him on either side of me. Longer strands of hair dangle down in front of his face, delight unwavering in his viridescent eyes.
As if they can hear her thinking, Trench looks up, catches her looking, and narrows their gaze fondly.
, she replied, and Trench rippled their fabric in a responding laugh. Castiel wavered, and Dean helped him into the car on the way to the Whore. He could’ve teleported but, well, Baby for one was glad he was too intoxicated to do so. Even though it hadn’t taken as long as last time, each time the wait to see Trench seemed even worse.
"So why are you home so early? You're usually staggering back here at seven." I ask, and she gives a small laugh.
The car descends into the darkness of the highway to the Boardwalk as Dean turns a corner, away from the suburbs.
My hand finds the cold metal and I clutch it, my entire arm shaking. I glance around the room and my eyes settle on a hiding place I’ve known since I was a child.
“Huh-“ I cut off my own words with a shriek as I swerve to dodge someone. Who the hell is standing on the highway at midnight?
“I know.” Dean sighs again. “It's complicated.” He squeezes his hands together painfully, relaxes them. “I hoped that the dance we were doing was more than just friendship, but I wasn't sure how you felt. And I wasn't ready. And then when you brought it up, I lashed out.”
"Come on, Cas. Don't you want to show me your blueprints?" He gives a wicked grin, knowing I won't be able to resist the temptation.
Baby hummed as the men swung into the car, Trench with them. Trench shot a rustle her way, and she affirmed.
Castiel hums. “I did wonder quite a bit when I was younger. I imagined him as some magical figure who would find me on my 18th birthday and bring me to live with him. Though now, with the fact that he’s never tried to contact me, he’s probably an asshole. Maybe that's my mother's type.” Cas laughs a bit, but Dean can hear the wavering in it.
The ice at the table shatters and everyone explodes, laughing and asking Jack overlapping questions, directing some to Dean. Dean slaps the table and says he'll need some grub in him before he even thinks about sharing, and they scramble to comply.
“Oh, that was fast.” Cas is looking at him now, slightly tilt-headed. “Thanks, Charlie, you’re the best.”
Baby isn’t sure, but she could’ve sworn she just saw Trench, walking with Cas by the road. Apparently Dean gets the same vision, because he backs her up, but once they’re stopped, there’s no sign of either Trench or Castiel.
“The name came from her; we would talk about my stupid ideas and brainstorm together… who would've thought that she'd name you the same name as my character.” The man chuckles. “I'm published now, so I have a few crazy fans who track me down.” He looks at them. “Sorry about all that.”
Still, if angels are looking for Cas, that means he’s alive and safe from them, and that’s good. She’s content in the fact that Trench will be back eventually. That's how it goes. It’s just a waiting game; they always come back to her.
Baby knows they’re trying to forestall her from blowing up again, to placate her, but she’s still happy for the comfort.
Dean gives a muffled “Umph!” and I hold my breath, waiting for Gabe and Jo to turn the corner and find me here, eavesdropping.
“No problem,” he mumbles out, going to his own seat and trying not to knock it over as he attempts to sit down.
Meg’s behind the wheel, treating her more gently than she’d expected, but it still puts an itch under her skin. She guns it, the sooner to win this battle, the sooner to see the boys and Trench again.
"Nope, he literally means the bathroom. The Blue Velvet's bathrooms are known for being where people go to get off. My guess is that she's about to get some scuffed up knees." Meg shrugs and takes a sip of her drink.
We watched as Adam scampered up the pile, his shaking visible even from where we were, jumping a little every time a rusty pipe moved out of place slightly. The pile was unstable, and, whether or not our child brains wanted to admit it, damn dangerous.
I didn’t think he’d noticed. All of my forward moves, flirting, randomly kissing Meg- I thought that was all subtle enough for it to only really exist in my head.
A wolf whistle answers Dean as he steps out from his room, begrudgingly wearing what Benny picked. He has to admit that he doesn’t look half-bad, even if he looks like a 45-year-old trying to be hip. Whatever.
The guy obviously hears Dean laughing, because he props his head up on his hand and slowly turns to face the noise, his mouth a scowl. It would look more intimidating if the dude's eyes were also angry, but Dean can only imagine them scrunched up against the light behind his glasses, and he can't help but laugh again. Sighing, Sunglasses goes back to his face-down-on-the-probably-very-dirty-table pose. Dean would wonder why he's sitting in the front and not the way way back, but it looks like it took all of his energy just to stumble into the first chair he could find.
I stayed, pressed against the wall, breathing shallowly, until I finally gathered myself, convincing little Cas to open the bedroom door.
“Well your friend is full of it,” Bruce guffaws. “Whew, I’ll steal that punchline from you for later, thanks.” He wipes his forehead. “Naw, but those guys are the real deal. Can’t quite agree with all the shit I’ve heard they've done, if it's true, but even if it is true we still owe them quite a rap. Would be nice to go hunting with them one time or other.” Alex and Claire grin at each other as Bruce enters his fanboy tone. “I just know I’ll run into them on a hunt someday.”
"Nope, I could give a crap what he's doing. He's just Gabe. He's gross and creepy." She scrunches up her nose at the thought, but can't hide the blush blooming on her cheeks.
His carefully constructed excuses for Cas’ silence (his battery died, or he has a phone interview, or he dropped his phone when getting into a car, accidentally stepped on it, and then kicked it into the drain where it got eaten by raccoons) shatter. Though he’s not going to sit here feeling sorry for himself, he has to acknowledge that Castiel is definitely on his phone, and ignoring him.
"Jo?" I ask when I reach her, and the blonde looks up from her drink. She's relocated to the bar since I last saw her.
"Okay, me first!" says Meg. she pauses to think, before saying, "Never have I ever... Snuck out of the house."
Claire’s feeling upbeat after her successful hunt, so she pushes back. “You’re thinking of Purgatory. And angels don’t even have souls, duh.” Just then the waitress brings her order, giving an up-ticked brow at the angel comment.
“Yeah, I saw their asses,” I mumble to myself, feeling bitter and abandoned as I tug my pants back up. “The zombie was flat.”
He just can’t stop thinking it over— his freak-out, Cas’ reaction. The thing is, he doesn’t have anything to offer to mend it. He can apologize, sure, he can explain why, but it’s nothing concrete to say he won’t freak out again. Nothing to prove he’s really committed to this idea, of them, together, so at odds with the sentiment he'd voiced.
The beetle is crushed and Napoleon toys with it playfully, proud of himself for the catch. I scratch the top of his head and the kitten purrs gratefully. We seem to be getting along rather well, he and I.
I wander aimlessly for a few minutes, unsure of where I'm trying to go. Well, I know that I'm trying to get home- I'm sick of this night- but I don't know how. Hannah stayed in again tonight, and Gabe is probably getting his fourth round of blowjobs by now.
Dean had parked her in the dark, tarped, for what felt like forever. Baby partially welcomed the silence; the standoff against Lucifer was a lot to process, and she did so as she rested comfortably under her blanket.
Before long Meg has emerged as the winner—or loser?—of Never Have I Ever, all her fingers down and lots of alcohol presumably in her system. Across the room they see her jump up, declare an end to the game, and come to find Cas.
“And if he didn't come around, screw him.” Dean's startled into a laugh to hear his mother say that. “I'm serious, Dean. Your happiness is all that matters.”
That tone again… Baby pushed down her indignation and reflected on the words. She was taken aback but tried not to break her stride on the road. In the recent weeks she had heard talks of angels and seals and had pieced together the barest bones of the threat her boys faced. Only now did she realize how much she truly missed in their lives, and how many gaps would maybe never be filled.
Dean looks again at the email Charlie sent him, making sure he has all the details right before he pulls up in front of number 128. Dean looks over at the mailbox, which has the right number, but he can’t see the house clearly, just one of those big hedge bushes and what looks like a walkway.
So he pulls himself together. He's got to at least try. At least for the chance to apologize, regardless of if Cas forgives him or not, if Cas wants him or not. He deserves an apology, at least.
When I finally spot Dean, he's leaning against a back wall, talking to a Catholic schoolgirl and a somehow sexy zombie. As I near them, I hear the schoolgirl say, "Yeah, Gemini and Aquarius are, like, meant to be," while twiddling her long, dark hair.
-Cas’ father and mother got divorced in March of 1984. His father moved to Ohio, and refused to see Hannah or Cas for several years. Neither had the desire to see him.
Cas comes back out with two cups of water, setting them on the automan and joining Dean on the couch. Dean reaches for the glass for something to do, drinking half before setting it down. A little routine that he loves about Cas’ apartment.
“Because you fuck with people, Dean! You fuck with everyone and you don’t care who you hurt!” He seems taken aback by my anger, concern building in what little of his facial features I can see.
Cas goes first after a slight stutter-step. He sits down next to Meg, and Dean follows. Dean sees him rest his head on her shoulder and Meg mirrors him, resting the side of her head lightly on his crown. After a few seconds they separate and sit back up, all seemingly forgiven.
"By that he meant ‘drink responsibly and respect women.’" Meg gives a sweet smile, ignoring Gabe's whimpers.
To cover the moment or to extend it, Dean's not sure, he lifts his pack and asks before his brain can process, "Want one?"
“I’ll do it!” he interrupted, starting to clamber back onto the pier, skinny limbs struggling to lift himself up. He was easily the smallest kid on the block.
Cas looks down. “She started asking when we were going to get married." He grimaces. "We could've pretended to break up, I guess, but I couldn't help but say something. Coming out during an argument is not the greatest, but that seems to be my MO." He grins wryly, just a hint before it fades again.
"Okay, my turn now!" Jo returns to her usual bubbly persona. "Never have I ever... Made out with a friend's sibling."
“Hey, it’s not your fault. Look at me.” Gabe’s voice is soft, gentler than I’ve ever heard him speak before.
“No, you’re right. As you said, you have class later, and it will take several hours of driving both ways. We could make it a weekend ‘thing’, if you can get off work?”
No one says anything, eyes wide as saucers, until Bruce mutters “I thought their son was God? Is this an infant Jesus thing?”
She wracks her internal mechanisms for some plausible explanation, but there is none. Wherever Trench is now, they won't be coming back. And with Cas having abandoned them, Trench will no doubt cease to be an Object and go back to just a scrap of cloth at the bottom of some bin, If they’re still intact at all.
Dean takes the bunch of cloth from the back and turns towards Cas in the passenger seat. Baby just watches the interaction, numb. This connection is what she and Trench had seen and wanted, joked about, and something they had built their own connection on, and now Trench isn’t here to see it. The fact that Trench is gone sours her emotions, but she watches anyway.
“Now, normally, he moves on at lightning speed, but…” She waves her hand. “I don't know how you broke things off but it's really messing with him so it must've been immature. So what I need to know is, are you ready to stow the bullshit and actually talk to Cas like an adult, or is this just a fun game?”
Meg and Gabe have already gone through a pack together, despite the half an hour drive, and Dean's lit two up. Jo and I are left coughing and sputtering in the smoke.
They stand hesitantly for a second too long before Chuck jumps into action. “Oh, here, I’ll introduce you to some people.”
Cas watches him light up without comment, instead continuing the conversation about Green Day, listening intently to Dean’s view on rock operas.
Dean, are you still available today? We could study at my place instead, since it’s no longer a group that warrants the library
With that, Dean turns his attention back to the lecture, and Cas settles his head into the cradle of his arms on the desk. Dean hears a muffled "Noted" from his left and smiles, ducking his head to continue his notes.
It’s the happiest she’s felt in a long time, and it's a long time coming. Well, she knows time moves differently for her, that the time she’s tarped or turned off or parked for weeks warps her perception, shortens the days. But she knows more time has passed than she’s been conscious for, knows it’s been a long time from the creak in her axles. Sam doesn’t service her nearly as often as Dean does, either, and she can feel it.
“Yeah, we just followed the smell of teen spirit to this place,” Dean quips. He shrugs his jacket off and pulls up a chair, and Claire quirks a smile as hello.
She was bent over, peering into one of the cabinets, digging around various probably outdated medicines. I turned away quickly, trying to avoid looking at her butt, which was more than visible in her Levis.
But Baby is a stubborn lady, always has been, and Trench’s association with Ove still burns a little when the thought comes up. One day, finally, she voices it, out of restlessness more than anything else. She just wants to put this to away, talk it out and let it die.
"Hey." I call out, as I slide open the glass door leading out to the back porch. Hannah jumps slightly, startled at my voice, and turns around. She's sitting on the porch steps, head resting in her hands, and elbows on her knees. She's wearing usual Hannah-Friday-night-clothes, with a cotton candy pink, silky dress, that pools around her thighs.
He laughs again at his seeming joke, then lights another bowl as if the conversation is at its end, its mystery resolved. And Dean lets him, lets it fade into the night.
She hadn’t been sure what to expect from her first angel. Well, honestly, she had never really expected there to be one in her seats. Why would they ever use car travel? But Anna, though subdued, had fit into her idea of how an angel might act. Quiet, sitting up tall, observing everything.
“I know. I know now that it’s a bit more complicated than that. And I hate that I can’t just love or hate him. All I want to do is tell him these things to his face and make him acknowledge them, and apologize, but I can’t.” He pauses to steady his voice. “And at the same time, I want him back even though he’d hate me.”
“I can’t believe this! All these secrets being kept from me in my own goddamn house!” He slams his fist down on the kitchen table, making Hannah jump.
The car falls silent again, as our chuckles die out. It's not an awkward silence, though, this time. It's a nice silence, because nothing needs to be said.
I slowly pick it up, and as it emerges from the drawer, I know exactly what it is, despite the darkness.
“So, I don’t know how much you could hear, but Charlie found your dad.” He pulls up the new email, showing it to Cas. “Port Townsend, I guess?”
"Anyway, I was afraid she was going to disown me, send me to Bible Camp or something equally dramatic. But she didn't, just heaped on the pressure to make up for my
"...Thank you," Sunglasses, or "Cas" that is, says painstakingly. Dean chuckles again, and because the man is obviously in pain, shakes his head and resolves to stop bothering him.
I drop it right back into the drawer; into the unknown that it emerged from. It clatters about, knocking against the wood, as it lands. I scramble about in the drawer, searching desperately for the keys that I know I can't leave without, wincing every time my hands collide with the gun. Eventually, I seize them, slamming the drawer shut and bolting out of the room, not bothering to close the door, tripping on my own feet.
“It’s not like she has to know any details. I can just ask her to find this guy, and not tell her anything else.”
"I'm trying my best to figure stuff out, here." He runs his hands through his hair, staring down at the floor tiles. I can't see much of his expression, thanks to the mask that he eventually retrieved, but I can only assume that he isn't grinning with joy.
We both watch Napoleon scurry across the frozen grass, our breaths visible in the air. A layer of frost hangs over the entire backyard.
“Ehh,” says Kendall, leaning back and sipping on her drink. “So would that mean they’re in bed with the enemy, or are they playing them?”
"What the Hell, man? I was in there, and you just had to go and mess it up for me," he whines. I open the bathroom door, to see that it's almost empty, aside from a firefighter at a urinal and one of the stalls being occupied. I pull him into an empty one, as close the door behind us. The stall is surrounded by walls, instead of panels that have gaps near the ceiling and show your feet, and the doors are actual wooden doors; probably the reason for the soundproof reputation.
That Novak Boy (the name Charlie has programmed into Dean’s phone) becomes a permanent fixture at their study group, joining them on Wednesdays, too, once they find out he shares another class with Kevin. They all exchange numbers, and Cas joins the group chat. He’s surprisingly the best at keeping the group on track without earning any resentment. Or perhaps not very surprisingly; the more time Dean spends around him, the more he can see Cas’ serious side, and the more he wonders how this kid is the same one he met who was hungover in class.
"Man, why did we agree to this? I'm hot, and sweaty, and Gabe won't stop staring!" Jo whines, slapping Gabe on the shoulder. She's standing with her hands on her hips in the middle of Dean's living room, wearing a tight black spandex suit. She makes a good Cat Woman, but the suit might be a little too tight, hugging every inch of her body, making Gabe ogle whenever she moves, and the spandex readjusts around her figure.
Eager to be included, Rick has joined in with his own anecdote. He’s still green, but so was Claire not so very long ago—he may be a lot older than her, but they all respect each other here. She steals the rest of Alex’s fries and texts Jody that the hunt went well as she listens and waits for her order to arrive. She'll clean the grease off her phone later.
Dean takes the Bic gratefully, lights up, inhales, and relaxes. After a moment he exhales and makes to hand back the lighter, but the other guy has already withdrawn his hand, and takes no notice of Dean's attempt. Without hesitation, Dean scoots over on the top step and taps the guy on the shoulder.
Bruce huffs affectionately. “Oh, I forgot, you know the Winchesters like family, and my aunt’s Oprah.”
The gun I found in his bedside drawer two weeks ago probably doesn't do anything in his favor, either.
"Sorry, Jo, just so hard to stop myself when I'm with such a hot girl." He grabs the nurse's ass and Jo reddens. "We're just gonna go... to the bathroom." He smirks and they hurry off together, giggling.
“I mean, I really enjoy your company, and I find you attractive. I thought that was obvious, but maybe I wasn't clear enough.”
The question, though muffled, is sharp, and Dean can feel it hit him like a blow. He's ready for it, but it still throws him a bit. Cas turns back toward him, leaning against the counter. He’s almost close enough to touch, because it’s a small apartment, but he seems very far away.
“‘What would your grandfather think?’” Cas mocks, uncharacteristically animated in his story-telling. “‘As he’s dead, I doubt he’s thinking anything’ was my reply, which was when they really got angry.” He laughs weakly, the graveness sneaking back into his demeanor.
Speaking of… He shakes his head of thoughts and looks back in the window. Cas is looking down at his hands but his mouth is moving, so that’s a good sign. He looks up suddenly and catches Dean’s eye, and smiles. His hand motion beckons, so Dean opens the door and goes inside, smelling of smoke.
Sam and Dean had given her a tip for this one, said they were coming to town as backup even though that makes little to zero sense. A rawhead in her own town and they think she needs backup? She rolls her eyes as she clomps back up the stairs, dragging the dead meat with her. (Least favorite part of the job, but she’s not complaining about the muscles it gives her.) She’d been able to take out a singular rawhide without their help, thank you very much. No guns or knives even involved! It’s practically family friendly! And she’s not that shivering 12 year old they still think of her as, so the looks on their faces when they show up and she’s already finished the job… that will be priceless. She’s also sure the golden oldies have better things to do than come fry one little monster. But, well, who is she to complain about seeing them again after such a long time? Maybe she won’t admit it to their faces, but she has missed them.
"Batman is a mortal, genius." I smirk, before realising that our faces are suddenly much closer together. I can feel Dean's panting breaths on my lips.
As I reach it, I take a deep breath, count to three, and rip the curtains apart, to reveal the culprit. It's definitely not an owl.
“Hey,” Dean greets softly as he closes the door, Cas in the act of walking to the table and putting down his coat. “Sorry for the last-minute invite.”
I turn back to Dean, only to notice that my hand is still over his mouth and the other arm is pinning him down against the wall. We both stare at my hand for a while, looking from it, to each other, to the hand again; back and forth.
Baby’s never too worried about when Cas disappears— he always comes back, with Trench. If one of them’s okay, the other has to be as well. That’s just a law of the universe, in Baby’s mind. Every time she’s thought Trench will never return, they end up proving her wrong. By now she’s gotten over the anxiety every time Trench leaves, for she trusts Cas to bring them back; she can rest easy.
“Didn’t manage, huh?” I said smugly, only for Hannah to lift her hand out of the water, displaying a lump of muddy sand.
Bruce sprays beer over half the table. Claire groans as she wipes her face, and Bruce goes, belligerently, “Which one of them had the kid?? Riddle me that!”
We share a laugh again before she drives off into the darkness and I'm left alone at my house once more. I glance at my watch; 4:35. Everyone should be in bed already.
“Okay, then,” I shrug once more, making my way out of the bathroom. “They’re going to love you in prison.”
Dean lets him infodump and tries to anticipate how this meeting will go. He knows it’ll probably be emotionally charged. Hopefully positive emotions, but Dean’s a realist and he recognizes that even if it’s positive, it’ll probably still be awkward as hell. He thinks through several scenarios and what he can do in response, because he wants to be there for Cas however he can.
Dean has an irrational urge to say "we could share" since he doesn't really want a whole smoke anyway, but instead he dutifully taps one out and hands it to Cas. Cas takes it gingerly, leans forward and cups his hand to light it, his face thrown into sharp light by the flame.
"Oh, I'm the crazy bitch? What about-" my mother’s words were cut off by a sharp slapping sound. And her breath hitched just as it arrived, like a crescendo. It was as though everyone in the house had fallen still the moment it happened, like we'd all been frozen in time. I could see dust particles in the air, hear birds tweeting in the distance, feel the tension weighing down on me like it was the size of the roof. The sound still echoed in my head. I ducked back behind a bookshelf just as my father came barrelling out, combing through his hair with his hands, huffing quietly to himself, letting the bedroom door slam behind him. He hurried downstairs, and half a minute later the front door slammed behind him, too.
"You bein' a smartass now, honey?" Dean smirks back, the humor in his eyes replaced with a new sort of delight. He stares at my lips like a lion, and I can't help feeling like a gazelle.
Dean stares at him, a little bit in awe at that nonsensical answer but mostly horribly concerned for the guy's wellbeing at the hands of MacLeod. He's a teacher known for his verbal sharpness, especially toward off-task students. Becky almost cried last week when he picked on her.
I toss the book onto the floor of my room, and it makes a thump sound I'm sure my parents will mutter under their breaths about tomorrow morning. Right now, I have more important things to do. You see, I'm trying to break a world record. I'm going to be the youngest person to ever build a computer.
My face crumples in humiliation at the surprise in his, closing my eyes to avoid looking into his pupils.
“I do have one, Dean. I just keep it on Mercer Island at my mother’s house because I dislike driving. I could Uber there right now.”
I pause, for once unsure. What do I want to do? Eventually, after sifting through answers, I settle on one.
Okay, he’s sort of moping. His fling with Lydia, far from helping him rebound, had cemented the knowledge that he really would have liked a relationship with Cas. And just as he'd been ready to say so, Cas had showed up at the worst possible moment and Dean had killed that possibility. He wants to talk to Cas, but what could he possibly say?
I told them that Dean had entered the kitchen first, I hadn't really seen her, I was fine. They bought it. I just pawned my trauma off onto Dean, who was more than willing to take it.
And the thing is— they get along. When Baby forgets her grudge, which is often, they get along just as well as they always did. It would be so easy to let it go, to forget, to move on and not muddy their friendship. Tacitly clear the air.
"He said," Dean jumps quickly into the verbal gap before Sunglasses can dig his hole further, "that... red-green color blindness is... an example of an X-linked condition. A recessive one. Non-mendelian. Sir."
"Did you ever break it?" I ask, vaguely remembering something like that. We must have played on it at some point, years ago.
"Three months." He says quietly, turning away from me and combing through his hair with his fingers.
“Thank you for the last-minute invite,” Cas responds, and oh wow, Dean had forgotten about his voice.
And off they go. Chuck even manages to eek a laugh out of Cas eventually, and Dean smiles. The rest of his family may not appreciate him, but here Cas finally has some common ground and a promising new familial relationship to explore. After all that ostracizing, it must be a wonderful feeling. Dean’s happy for him, and judging by his current smile, Cas is happy too.
It’s tan, and large, and from what she can tell it’s a trench coat. Just a coat, but it hits her like a shot. The reminder that Trench is dead is something she can almost taste, and she starts her engine haltingly, hood in the clouds as Dean drives her to their next stop.
I stumble into the men’s bathroom, kicking open the door. I stop at a sink, one hand on either side of it, staring at my reflection in the mirror. My hair is tousled and sticking up at every angle, my eyes tired and bloodshot. My face is red and blotchy, my lips puffy.
“Don’t be a dick, Dean.” Jo says quietly. We all glance up at her—even Gabe, who lets out a small, pained sound when he turns his head.
But Kevin is always studying and Benny is with Andrea, so currently Charlie is the one cuddled up on the couch, watching
Baby can see it distinctly. She remembers how Trench and she used to joke about it, try to matchmake as best they could.
But most important in my list of impossible things that I could do: I could sit on this roof until I float off into the color-changing sky, into space.
“Oh, honey, why didn’t you say anything? I would’ve talked sense into him or fought for better custody—”
Realistically, I have no answer for that. I could go to Memphis and live in a hotel and write prose all day long. I could lock myself in my room until I’ve built my computer and refuse to talk to anyone and get my mother to pass me my dinner through a slot in my door. Hell, I could laze around in Dean’s bed forever, watching his eyes dart around the room.
“Shut up.” I grab the speaker—Dean—and slam him against the wall with me, covering his mouth with my hand.
But he's just been stubbornly silent, playing with his empty can, so after a beat of sitting on the tree together, Dean starts.
He knocks softly, then harder when there’s no answer. A shuffling behind the door and Dean can feel Cas assaying him through the peephole. When he finally opens the door, it’s not all the way, just enough to peek around it. His hair is on end and he’s wrapped in a blanket, and he looks ragged. Still attractive as ever, though, Dean thinks. He’s just happy to see him again.
“Three!” He jumps and runs up to Dean, who picks him up and puts him in his lap. “That’s right buddy,” he says.
“It’s cold, get in! I want to close the window!” Jo shivers from the backseat. Jo moved to New Jersey from Texas eight years ago and hasn’t ever gotten used to the cold, unlike the rest of us have.
I can't help but feel a sense of guilt because I know what Dean's up to. Probably still standing in that spot on the beach, starting to hate me.
Hannah’s at a loss for words, tears brimming her eyes, her lip shaking. My mother gets close to her, leaning across the table. And then, in her most sickly sweet voice possible, whispers,
“Yeah.” Dean knows that all too well. Cas side-eyes him at that tone, and he adds extra information, since they’re sharing and caring anyway. “My dad came home early once, caught me with this kid I had been fooling around with in highschool. It went over similarly. More yelling, though.”
It’s been two weeks since they started dating, and nothing has really changed. They still relax around each other, sometimes awkwardly bumping knees, sometimes fitting perfectly onto Dean’s couch. They still study with their friends, host movie nights, go to occasional and stupid parties. They joke, Cas in his stoic way, one eyebrow giving him away, Dean laughing unabashedly. They still flirt, in person and now over text as well, or through Snapchat (Dean receives way more pictures of plant specimens than he can reasonably be expected to look at).
Meg and Jo continue talking, but I'm already deep in my thoughts again. A place where no one knows what you're doing. Perfect. Dean and I need to talk, and if the location for that discussion is the men's bathroom, then so be it.
Claire smiles at the waitress, who comes over and takes her order of cheeseburger, rare. Sizzled flesh is still on her mind, so she figures she’ll shift to the opposite end and eat like a werewolf tonight, practically raw. Don’t forget the onion rings.
He can hear the smile in her voice when she speaks. "The usual: glorious, wheat-y..." They laugh, and Dean chances a few solid strides across the wet plaza. "The yard needs weeded after work and I'm really missin' your extra pair of hands right about now."
"You're a total loser." I say, as I pick up my sketchbook, because Dean knows how to use my weaknesses, and I know that the kid will be the death of me one day. Maybe not directly, but I know that when I finally hit the ground, it'll be because of him and his persuasion.
Now that Trench is gone, —good riddance—Baby’s back to normal. It’s strange, because for all the talking they didn’t do, having Trench there was still something of a comfort. And even though being alone is her normal state, without T she feels much lonelier than she ever did before.
I duck back behind the wall, not wanting to risk his eyes opening and seeing me watching them. It’s so intimate, they might as well be naked.
After that, the day passed in a blur. I went from moving in slow motion to speeding through everything that comes after a suicide. Dean called the police, and they called my parents. I went home, and my mom made burgers, which I didn't eat. And then I went to bed. I heard Dean's father, John, telling my dad that Dean refused to go into the kitchen for two months.
Jo and Gabe are kissing, her hands hanging around his neck, his on her waist, both of their eyes closed. Eventually they separate, staring at each other. I don’t know who kissed who, and it almost appears they don’t know, either.
"I just don't get," Jo starts, waving her hands around exasperatedly on the other side of Meg, "Why they only ever talk about the sad stuff in the news! I saw a puppy wearing a sweater yesterday! Where's that shit in the news?"
“What if she’s right, huh? What if it is me or the baby? What if I have to marry Michael and become a housewife like she did?”
“Stop it!” My voice breaks as I swerve to avoid the kid again. He keeps appearing on the road in front of me, watching with apprehensive eyes.
Her pride won’t let her admit that she missed Trench too, doesn’t think she needs to say it anyway. This was the outcome she wanted, sort of, but she still feels sour about it.
"What the Hell are you doing? Cas! Cas!" Hannah desperately pleaded with me, spitting out the mouthfuls of water every time she came up, gasping for air.
"No, no, don't ruin your work on account of me. I guess she's part of your life as much as mine." Dean flops back onto my bed, and the bed springs creak under his weight. I glance over at him, to see him close his eyes as though he's going back to sleep.
“Dad’s having an affair! She’s blonde! Big tits, too!” I blurt out, my grin replaced with a cheeky smile.
s. Next he brings up Facebook and does another futile search. Dean can feel his restless energy next to him, and isn’t surprised when Cas removes the laptop from his lap and abandons it beside him in frustration.
He won't cry, he won't. It's silly to get emotional. This is an old wound that should be dead by now. But he's emotionally stripped himself just to make this phone call, and his mother's acceptance feels good, goddamnit. The weight off his chest feels like a physical thing.
Cas nods. How can anyone communicate that much hurt in a nod? “Alright,” he says stiffly. “Good for you.” And then he walks away again.
After tugging my sketchbook out from under my pillow, I start to make adjustments to the design. Moving a screw a few inches down, adding notes about the metal, and mapping out the wires for the fifth time; it's my favourite thing to do.
He elaborates and dramatizes, and soon Cas is laughing along at seven-year-old Dean’s antics. His chest gets all fuzzy at hearing Castiel laugh deeply, and he keeps up the stories.
“We’re not fans, believe me.” Well, he can’t speak for Cas, but so far Dean is not a fan of this guy. “This is Castiel, your son.”
I glance over at Jo and Gabe. They’re laughing as Jo attempts to toss mini pretzels into his mouth, cheering and clapping when he succeeds.
“Madison just texted. She has invites for the three of us, so I assume everyone here can crash it as well.” She leans against the table a little unsteadily, but her voice is clear and steady. “Let’s kick off Fall break in style!”
“I’m just not sure what to wear. I mean, it’s cold out but it’ll be warm inside, but I don’t have any sweaters…” The more Dean talks, the more like a whiny teenager he feels, so he shuts up. It’s not like he hasn’t dressed for this situation a million times before.
I stare down at my popsicle, not previously noticing that it's gone, and that I've been toying with the wooden stick, not previously caring.
, Baby tried to reassure herself. But… what are the chances that God-lightning strikes the same place twice?
“And you’ve already met Dean,” Cas says, putting an arm around his waist and leaning against him. Dean grins down at him and then eyes Chuck. Thankfully he looks happy and relaxed, (or what counts for him as relaxed) and Dean grants him a smile too.
“No. That’s the thing, I wanted to protect him. Or something. It’s all jumbled, ‘cause I mean, he’s my dad. Was my dad. I love him, he's family.” While Mary collects her thoughts, Dean forges on. “I used to resent you a lot, you know.”
They’ve decided to spend Christmas with Dean’s family— well, Dean decided once Cas let drop that his grandmother hadn’t invited him to Christmas dinner. Not that he wanted to go anyway, but like hell was Dean going to let his boyfriend be alone on Christmas. As his mother is obliged to be at the Novak dinner on Christmas, she and Cas had celebrated a few days before with a small gift exchange. Cas had come over teary-eyed, and Dean was in a rage until he realized they were cathartic tears; happy ones, even. They were mending their relationship and building a small offshoot family— Dean held him tighter that night than any other.
They exchange a look. Hey, maybe the silly plan they cooked up what feels like years ago—love songs, stuck doors—is actually working. Baby switches the station to next Taylor Swift song she knows is playing, but the two are distracted.
Dean watches as Castiel opens several links in new tabs, searching through a knockoff White Pages and a few genealogy sites. It looks like there’s a few
“I don’t make the rules, man,” he laughs, conveniently ignoring the fact that he did make the rules.
It seems like a trap, but Dean’s quite alright with falling for it. “Very.” He leans forward and for an instant he’s not sure that Cas is leaning too, —a long instant of second-guessing himself, —until finally their lips touch and—
He wants to do it, fall on his knees, but— He looks over at Lydia and her polite, confused smile, and he can't. He's sure she'd be accepting, but that logic doesn't combat the discomfort prickling under his skin at doing this in public.
“The enemy’s in bed with them!” Bruce retorts. “Though I don’t know that I’d trust Mr. Blood Boy with the king of Hell running around his house.”
Neither knew what to say, and Baby was happy to remain silent, pressing up her seats to support her remaining boy. Well, her two current boys.
When she watches Dean help Cas out of the car, she feels nothing. When she watches Cas leave the bunker, so soon, sorrow on his face, she feels nothing. She just watches him go, sees the evidence of his humanity in the way he holds himself. She feels nothing at that, either— only mourns the fact that he can’t create matter anymore, that he can’t fly, that he doesn’t have the power to bring Trench back to her. She just mourns.
“Just talk, mom.” He can't seem to stop laughing to soften this conversation, even if levity is the farthest thing from his mind right now. “Though I took it as law.”
Dean is in a great mood. After he woke up and downed an ibuprofen for the slight pressure on the side of his head, he had time to reflect on what he could remember of the night. He can't pinpoint any one moment that made the night something special, but he can't stop the smile from stealing onto his face every other minute as he makes shitty powdered coffee.
I carefully peek my head around the corner to watch the scene. Gabe’s arms are wrapped around Jo as she buries her face into his chest. His face is pressed into her hair, his eyes closed. It’s weird, I’ve never seen emotion like that in Gabe before. Every time Gabe’s ever been this close to a girl, aside from his mom and Meg, he’s had his hand on her ass.
Dean huffs a small laugh. “Yeah, actually, I think I’m great. I just have some things to tell you, is all.”
"I see, you only kept me around for free labor," Dean laughs, as Mary interjects "All that food was definitely not free!"
“Rum and coke.” Cas looks amused and takes it upon himself to step even closer, leaning up to Dean’s ear. “Where have you been for the past half hour?”
I watch as Napoleon darts back and forth, pouncing at ants as they scramble away, trying to reassemble their line. His ears twitch as he spots a fat beetle blundering across one of the stairs of the back porch. Going still, crouching low, he focuses on his prey. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
Yeah, yeah. Dean shakes his head and puts his game face on. He’s got this. Right after he washes the dishes.
“Hey, Dean!” a voice calls out and Dean rips himself from me, breaking away and stumbling back onto the sand, eyes darting around, looking for the owner of the voice like a rabbit caught in headlights.
Baby felt for Dean, but she didn’t understand. Though years ago, when they had met, Lisa had seemed like a nice gal, the problem was that there had been many a nice gal in her backseat. She wasn’t sure what made this one so special. Then again, she did trust Dean to know what was right for himself, even if Baby disagreed. It’s not like she could have told him, after all.
"It's not— you pronounce it like dub— You know what— it's great, it's fine." Dean skips gracelessly over the topic, knowing Mary is teasing him and it's best not to open that can of worms. "How's the glorious wheat state."
As he leans closer to me, moving slowly, I notice that something’s off. Blood is trickling down his forehead.
Dean walks out of the library, holds the door for Cas, and leads the way to the nearest smoking area. He feels rather self-conscious with a guest, but they fall into easy conversation as they walk, and in only a few minutes they’re chatting away as they sit down in the designated area.
“Hello, Claire. Alex.” He looks at her with his now familiar unsettling gaze. The entire table looks back at him, transfixed. Rick’s mouth is hanging open. “Who are your... friends?”
He turns to see Cas looking at him with a small smile. He doesn’t try to hide his gaze, instead looking into Dean’s eyes calmly. Then he goes about getting his textbook ready as if nothing out of the way has happened. Dean does the same to distract from the slight heat he can feel in his cheeks. Study time, Dean reminds himself. Study dates are fake. Study
They tried to keep each other’s spirits up, but by the time Baby arrived in Detroit and Cas stepped out with the rest, Baby’s undercarriage was roiling with worry. And when Dean returned without Sam, slack-faced, when he slammed her door, when he called Chuck and then drove her towards Lawrence, she couldn't help but despair. She had no one to talk her through it; all she could do was move as fast as possible, and hope Dean had a plan in his head.
I slump down beside her, the breeze blowing through our hair, still smiling. My hands clasp onto hers as we watch the outskirts of the town; couples running by, groups of drunk friends, even some girls in tears. A man and a woman sit down at a bench just behind the wooden path, fifty yards away from us. In the darkness I make out the woman, a curvy blonde in a dark plum dress. The man is harder, but I can almost see brown hair, and maybe a beard. Their hands fumble around, and first the girl is climbing onto his lap, and there's a glint of gold jewellery, and he's grabbing her ass. Then, he's laying her down in the bench, kissing her legs and her neck and her tits. Then, blonde hair is flying around as she straddles him, and Meg is saying, "Oh, there's second base! Wait, never mind, it's third.", and everything is clicking in my mind.
“I swear to God, you little bastard…” he says under his breath, barely audible to me, let alone Hannah and my mother.
She’s not happy about it, but then neither is Trench. They’ve only just become friendly again, and it pains her for it to be cut short so soon.
“Hi guys! Find the dive okay?” Claire says, cheerily, as Cas and Dean make their way towards the table. Even Kendall is speechless.
After they throw their butts in his beer can (at Cas’ insistence) and head out, the walk back to the bonfire is a little more stumble-y than Dean would like to admit. He feels like a bubble has surrounded him and Cas, and they'll float in the same insulated feeling right to the end of the night. Everything’s lagging, but in high definition: the beach shifting strangely beneath his boots, Cas's low laugh, the reflection of the moon he can see on the water. He feels good and, well, high. And a little drunk. But he swears it's the company.
I stop the car at Dean’s house. It’s safe. Sam’s at a sleepover and John’s out. I can’t go home and put Hannah in danger. It would get her. I have to protect her.
Dean's eye flick to his face, then back to his hand. What the hell. He takes it as casually as he can and puts it to his lips. The smoke burns, but he’s drunk enough that he can relax into it.
I slumped down into the faux leather bench, tilting my head back and pressing it against the yellow cinderblock wall behind me. I squeezed my nose, as blood oozed out of it, the metallic taste sliding into my mouth.
"I've got to go. I'll see you guys soon," I interrupt Jo and stand up, making my way into the crowd. Last time I saw Dean, he was talking to some girls by one of the podiums. I shuffle around, scanning the people around me, looking for a Batman. People are packed tightly, bodies pressed together, the whole crowd pulsing together. There's something so overtly sexual about it.
Then: him and Sammy playing in a kiddie pool in the backyard. A shiny moment in time. His brain adds details from later, more cynical memories— the dead grass in the summer and the scorching heat of the concrete stepping stones. Dean’s splashing his brother, pushing him, holding him under the water— he gets carried away and Sammy comes up crying. It’ll be forgotten in a minute, it didn’t mean anything, but grown-ups just don’t get that.
The first round goes fast. Dean’s in it to win it, so he folds his crap hand and takes a drink. Cas and Megan also fold after the flop, take their respective punishments, and it’s just Lydia and Ash who play on. Lydia ends up winning, and Ash takes off his socks, to the protests of those present. Not very remarkable.
"So where should we hit first?" he asks casually, referring to the bars that we will no doubt hop between faster than we can finish our beers. He's digging around under his bed, probably trying to find his shoes.
Right now they're debating musicals, (a topic Dean knows nothing about, he swears, even if he can quote Rent), heads close together, Cas stealing bacon from Dean’s plate and pretending it wasn't him. Cas laughs and Dean is caught up in how his face looks, crinkled and genuine. He has to look away before he's sucked in so he looks up, and accidentally catches the eye of guy in line who, Dean notices, is holding the hand of the man next to him. The guy smiles at him, a smile of solidarity, and Dean swallows. Snaps his eyes away.
"Ugh!" I huffed in frustration, kicking the ground, only to be left with a face full of dirt and dust. It was a particularity hot summer, and the soil and grass had turned orange and brown from the lack of water.
They walk on in comfortable silence, and watch the seagulls play along the beach. Soon, the sun sets, slowly at first and then in a quick succession of hues, until it's finally below the horizon. The night gets chillier, and they hurry back to the car, tired and happy.
That gives them both lots of time to stew in silence and work up the courage to address the elephant in the car. And it gives Baby time to reflect on their past.
“You type it next to me every study session. ‘Winchester’ is a horrible password and you should create a stronger one.” Cas side-eyes him seriously.
"Cheerful, ain't they?" Meg gestured towards the pamphlets, "Man, sometimes I think all they're tryna do is scare us."
Unexpectedly, after that small hiccup, Cas is back. Something feels off, but if Trench doesn’t mention anything then Baby trusts that nothing is going on. Sort of.
Trench doesn’t say anything in response; there’s nothing to say that they don’t both already know. Well, that’s a lie— there’s many things to say. But Baby pushes that down. Now isn’t the time. They just got back to friendship; she shouldn’t rush it, shouldn’t scare them off.
Dean self-consciously flits his eyes to Cas, who’s sitting up now, too— looking down at his hands, slight color in his cheeks.
He returns to her, Cas following, and she does watch the way they are around each other, their silent communication. Feelings of betrayal—seemingly a constant—but also love. The more important constant. That, at least, is a comfort.
In the end, Dean breaks the silence first. Cas had looked over for a long second in the course of their walk, and Dean had thought he was ready to start talking. Cas had finished his cider, and Dean had thought he would start. Cas had beelined to a driftwood tree trunk, strangely smooth and white and out-of-place in the sparse forest, and when he sat down Dean had thought he would talk.
A cloud of smoke wafts over him as his cigarette lays idle between his fingers, and he breathes it in on impulse. It's not his thing, and it smells too strong, but it’s at least better than that froufrou watermelon smoke inside. Ick.
“It's not like you're much more talkative,” Dean says. “I never see you spilling your guts about your feelings.”
“Wow, will you look at that? Our ninth abandoned factory. Ain't that America? Hey, what do you say, this doesn't pan out, we head back to that beer-and-bacon happy hour about a mile back, huh?”
Everything is amplified, but muffled. The people at the table next to him seem interested in his conversation and he feels a hot flush of shame that anyone might be overhearing this, might be assuming he's someone’s
Cas still looks stoic, and Dean’s played his whole hand. He doesn't know what else he can say, expect the bare truth, and hope it's enough. He stands up and steps towards Cas.
“Buddy, we really don’t know what we’re supposed to be fans of. This is my friend Castiel Novak, and you’re his father.”
He takes a deep breath, centers himself. “I’ve been thinking about dad a lot, recently. About the responsibilities he put on me to take care of Sam and him when he should’ve been doing that. Stuff I downplayed to you, and everyone else. Nothing concrete… but I don’t know…”
"What's going on with us, Dean?" I say, slumping down to sit on the closed lid of the toilet, while Dean leans against the door.
Obviously Meg hadn't been told the full story. She had assumed they were together, maybe, and Cas hadn't corrected her. She’d assumed that Dean had said some immature things instead of breaking up, or had offended Cas somehow. But she still seems to think their ‘relationship’ can be salvaged.
-In the first chapter, the characters refer to GRIDs. This stood for Gay-related Immune Deficiency, which was the name used to refer to AIDs in the early days of the crisis.
Cas’ smile is a distant memory from his face; now there's confusion deep in the lines of it. “Dean, we've kissed before, and gone on several outings together that could constitute dates. We spend basically every waking hour together. As far as I'm concerned, you're more than a fling.”
“You sure did assume. We're nothing. Thinking I'd want to date you is laughable.” Every word he says makes him cringe internally, but Dean can't seem to help his mouth. He watches what's happening in his heart mirror itself in Cas’ face, then smooth out into an unreadable mask.
Dean slams the trunk of the Kia after putting the last bag in the back. He goes around to the passenger side, leaning against the side of the car as he watches Cas come down from his door, his backpack in hand. Dean idly plays with his lighter as he waits for Cas to reach the car.
"Nope! I'm out! You two are gross!" Dean stands up and escapes the couch, oddly disgusted by Gabe and the nurse, considering he'd usually be cheering them on. He disappears into the crowd and Jo and I readjust just as Meg appears and settles down in Dean's place. Jo groans as she's once again pushed against Gabe's ass.
“I’m not a scaredy cat!” he yelled desperately, edging towards the end of a pipe so that his toes were practically hanging off of it.
"Fine. See you girls later, yeah?" He kisses the school girl on the cheek before reluctantly stepping forward.
I watched Adam's face the whole time. I could see him accidentally crack a smile, before bursting out laughing and sitting up to laugh at us for getting fooled. I could see him wipe off the blood and lick it off his fingers, saying, "It's jam, see?" and dare me to do a handstand.
Of course Crowley and Ove are still in her trunk. Of course Sam is in the hospital, of course Dean is out of his mind. How else could the day get better?
Taser in hand, Claire descends the stairs to the basement carefully. Normal suburban house, the mom out, kids with a babysitter. She set all that up, with Jody’s help, because she knows the importance of a plan now, after— focus. She shifts back into hunting brain. Kill the bad thing, go eat burgers; easy, simple math. The steps barely even creak and she reaches the bottom easily, steeling herself before rounding the corner and confronting the space under the stairs.
Benny chuckles, walking closer and picking through the clothing options around Dean. “Aren’t you a bit old for worrying about house parties? Or going to house parties?” One of the shirts must pass muster, because he picks it up and walks over to open Dean’s dresser.
I remove the gun from my head and look at it, then him, then it, before holding it up. His eyes widen in fear as I hold him at gunpoint, and he stumbles back, away from me. Meg puts her hands up.
"Whatever you say, Sammy." Dean replies, the front door slamming behind us too quickly for him to reply.
“Not important,” Meg interrupts him, pulling a small bag out of her pocket and dangling it in front of him. “What is important, is this.”
“I've obviously never been explicit about it, but I thought you felt the same way.” Cas looks uncertain, his usual bravado absent. “I move slowly and it seemed you were okay with that. I know it's rather naïve but I thought—”
The situation was spinning wildly out of control and the realization was dawning upon me and Hannah. Adam wouldn’t be able to climb back down; the pipes were too shaky and unstable, and he couldn’t jump off; he was too high up. Adam, not wanting to be a chicken, ignored Hannah’s pleas and refused to admit it.
Rick scoffs, but Bruce nods, quickly, dismissive. “Yeah, we’ve all heard this story, sweetheart. God is a dick. And that’s a fact.” He points at Rick and Andy, who, skeptics a second ago, seem to take it to heart. Or are at least intimidated by the old hunter.
“I’ve been waiting all night for one of those,” Bruce says, and Dean nods at Cas, and Cas gives in, and they settle in to listen.
Last year, she decided that she was bored of her life. She was bored of her goodie two shoes friends, Lisa and Jess, and so she ditched them. She chose new ones, with cool haircuts and loud voices, and now they're rolling up on our driveway, in a red convertible.
Dean and I stroll through the empty streets, not knowing whether we can call this late night or early morning, and being so drunk that we don't even care. My watch says it’s 4:23 but it doesn't mean anything to me, and the numbers swim in my head.
Have you ever tried taking a walk? Sometimes when it’s all too much, all you’ve got to do is take a walk.
He almost doesn’t get the courage to go. Why would Cas possibly want him? He’s done nothing but lash out. He couldn’t even handle being friends, why would Cas want to try at more, seeing what Dean’s already unleashed?
Not all of it, of course. She took after Dean and his father before him, and didn’t trust easily. But by the end of the last ride, when Dean signaled to her gears to slow and stop outside a warehouse, Baby was entranced by the stories and grateful to the coat for providing them.
It’s just— he knows he likes guys, obviously. He’s been drawn to Cas since they met, and a few other passing flirtations before him. But that’s the thing: Cas isn’t a passing flirtation. Dean likes him a lot and that’s frightening, and he didn't fully realize until Cas confronted him with it, and he’s gone and sabotaged himself. Really, he doesn’t have a great track record for relationships, and it seems hereditary. It’s in his genes at this point. He can feel it in his gut.
“You came to see me.” I reply, not bothering to turn around to see the owner of the voice, who is standing behind me.
Dean doesn’t realize he’s been fiddling with his Zippo, spinning it between thumb and forefinger, until Cas reaches over and touches his wrist.
Dean goes still all of a sudden, letting his arms fall to his sides. He stares at me like he's trying to say something, but just can't spit it out. We keep looking at each other, expecting something to happen; for something to click and me to leap into his arms, and everything will be okay again.
Baby pulled up at the police station before Trench had even made a dent in the latest news, from the celestial to the mundane details that Baby appreciated. Each time Castiel reentered the car and Baby moved forward on the path to Raphael, Trench chipped away: Cas’ brainwashing; Dean and Cas, throwing out the rules and ripping up Chuck’s ending; the way Dean looked with the angel’s hand over his mouth; Castiel, using a cellphone; Jimmy and his love for his daughter; Dean handing over the amulet even after being dressed down by Cas; Castiel carving protection into the boys’ ribs.
Waves collapse next to us and dust forms in the air as we throw ourselves onto the sand. Meg's fallen to her knees in front of me, a truly picturesque moment:  her dark hair and arched eyebrows, breathing heavily, with the sea as her background. One of the straps of her tight, black dress hangs around her shoulder, and she's grinning at me and my half-untucked shirt and wild hair.
Somehow, distractedly, dangerously, she and Dean drive to a hotel parking lot. After Dean parks, there’s a moment of awkward hesitation. After all this time, they still hesitate? Baby rolls her headlights, and Trench laughs.
Dean does a mouthless smile, eyes only, then stares daggers at Claire. “Yeah man, we’ve seen a lot,” is all he offers up.
Her anger deflates. Baby isn’t stunned— she expected as much. Trench had told her as much. Instead, she just feels sick for all the time wasted, all the jealous muck that had stewed inside her for so long. Though in a twisted way the news of Ove had helped her realize her friendship with Trench was maybe not just friendship, no way in hell will she voice that. Instead she stays silent.
They sigh and peter out laughing together, leaving a warm silence. Dean looks down and notices that somehow they've become wedged against each other. It is pretty cold out, though, he reasons; doesn't mean anything.
I swallow. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just tripped up in the hallway." I feel bad lying to him, but I would feel even worse having to tell him that his own dad keeps a gun in his bedside drawer.
“Yeah, aside from Benny- that was the name of the guy in New York. I kissed Tommy Reynolds at the Spring Fling, but that was only ‘cause he wouldn’t stop goin’ on about how he’d never been with a boy and all that. I never really liked him or anything, but he seemed to really get off when I told him about Benny so I kissed him. He wanted to know what it was like.” Dean shrugs, like it was just an act of kindness to help the community.
"Depressing, as usual. They want to redo the Roe v. Wade case ten years later, like some sort of weird reunion. And then there's the usual GRIDs death count, so pretty cheerful stuff, y'know?"
Pushing open the door, he's greeted with a refreshing burst of cold air and a view of the alley. Not very picturesque, but the twinkle of the cars and shopping mall below gives the night an airy quality, much better than the stuffy, over-vaped interior he's stepping out of.
Life continues, an endless round of sleeping, class, studying, eating, and generally staying holed up inside because of the weather. He sees Cas frequently, and sometimes they hang out outside of study group, as well. Just the two of them doing flash cards or having lunch at Dean’s place. It's a comfortable routine, not least because Cas is always fun and interesting to be around.
Dean's insides turn to metal, heavy and oppressive. He instinctively runs outside to explain, but forgets that Lydia is still on her way out. She intercepts him right as he reaches Cas.
Castiel sighs, and Dean can feel him softening. But he's not done, not quite. Cas stands, goes to retrieve something from the kitchen counter so that Dean can’t see his face when he asks:
"I'm Meg, obviously," she says, bringing one hand up to tap her chest, where her fingertips linger longer than necessary. "And this here is my errant Castiel, who was
He laughs. “I dunno what to tell you, man. Don't psychoanalyze me.” He knows Cas won't really take that for an answer, but he has to throw it out first. “I think I say what I need to say, even if I don't go into detail. Or I make it obvious, even if I don't use words, y'know?”
Well, sort of. He went to the occasional party and kickback at home, hanging out in his friends’ basements in high school or going to a birthday party that got rowdy. But he tried to keep up on his studies and set a good example for Sam, so those experiences were over several scattered weekends. In college back home, it was all he could do to study his ass off in addition to working. Sure, he’s no recluse, but since moving to a campus he feels like he can officially be a college student. It makes him grin.
Baby hadn’t expected the man and coat to be back, but for the next few days they were in and out of her seats, with a woman and girl as well at times. Slowly, she heard the coat out.
My father is sleeping on the couch when I close the front door. He's been sleeping there every night since the big argument, and I haven't seen my mother look him in the eye since either. Things are going well in the Novak household.
I take a deep breath as I place my hand on the door handle, only needing to turn a key to unleash the chaos going on inside.
I only had to wonder if she was sarcastic, or just stupid. I'd always been a bad at picking up on sarcasm, much to Dean's annoyance.
I don't bother to look at his expression as I turn to walk back into the lively part of town, away from the sand and sea and the pained look on Dean's face.
“Oh, I fuck with people? Care to talk me through what just happened with Meg back there? ‘Cause it seems like you used her to get back at me."
In all honestly, Baby wasn’t sure that Dean would leave Trench in her trunk for more than one car ride back to the bunker. Why would he?
He intends to lie there and let Benny get it, since he’s not expecting anyone, but then he remembers Benny’s with Andrea for Thanksgiving. Sighing, he leaves the bed and walks to the door. He clicks on the intercom.
“Hi, Hannah! Hi, Cas!” a high-pitched voice called from the beginning of the pier, diverting our attention away from the splash fight.
Dean’s seventh birthday party had been so fun. There’d been pie and ice cream and they’d gone to one of those trampoline houses with a few of his friends. His dad got there just in time to open presents, and gave him the best nerf gun ever, and a helmet too. Dean ran around with that thing all day, even after they got home, and even got baby Sammy in on the game. It had been perfect.
Dean laughs at the tail end of his own exhalation, deeper than warranted. "Good, that's good," he manages, coughing at the end of the laugh. "Or bad, I guess. Don't like it too much!"
“Happy Thanksgiving, hon. We miss you.” Shuffling on the line. “Here, talk to Sammy while I take this out of the oven.”
Halfway through his second one, he realizes his lighter is still heavy in his hand, and looks down at it. He eyes at the engraving, running his thumb over the name.
, as if it were obvious. I know you're from a state where being gay or whatever is okay, but I'm not.”
Finally, finally, the boys stumbled back out, sans Cas, and Baby really didn’t know what to think. They got her back to Sioux Falls, Dean swearing the whole way and not saying much else.
Maybe it’s the beer, but I can’t help but feel left out. Meg offered it to Dean, not me. They don’t want me here.
“Ugh!” Gabe’s head pops out from between the railings and he stumbles backwards, hitting the wall behind him. He stares at Jo, also breathing deeply, unsure of what to say.
"Hey, stop judging me!" Dean elbows him playfully. "You're the one with illegal drugs in your coat pocket!"
Her gaze turns on Cas finally, and Dean can almost feel the wave of rage and betrayal that Cas directs towards him.
He thinks of Lydia and feels sick, but it doesn't change his answer. “It’s not a game,” Dean manages.
Mary is silent for a beat, letting it sink in. “Dean, is this you coming out? Because if so I don't care, you're my son.”
As it is, Baby’d rather save the talking for later. She’d rather enjoy the time they have tonight, and apparently Trench wholeheartedly agrees.
The shadow darts around, landing on the mirror, before smashing it. Metal falls to the ground, turning to blue china. I stumble out of the room, and find myself staring at the door that I’ve been so desperate to get away from for weeks. John’s room.
Chuck looks pale and not at all ready to hear this news. “I just don’t see how that could be possible.”
Nothing is turning out the way I planned and my life is spiraling out of control. But with Dean’s arm reaching around me gingerly, I decide that some things are simply out of my control. Some things are destined to happen, whether or not you planned for them.
He finally breathes out, as much a sigh as an exhalation of smoke, and looks back over at Cas who is staring at him. The man's eyes move up from his lips to his eyes, and though his expression is the same, Dean senses that the mood has shifted. Maybe not so unaffected as he assumed.
Baby’s had a lot to think about in the months that Cas’ been gone. Now, though, with the mad dash Dean, Sam, Meg, and Cas are making, doesn’t seem like the time to bring it up. There isn’t time, really, but she has to at least ask this.
The funeral was the worst part. Mrs. Milligan looked at me during her speech, tears in her eyes, peering into my soul. I started at the ground. She had first lost her husband, now her only son, and it was my fault.
“Fine then, I’m not a scaredy cat,” I declared, copying her actions in standing facing the beach with my heels hanging off of the pier. I took a deep breath, before flinging myself off, flailing rather unceremoniously in the air before crashing down into the water, landing on my back.
“She didn’t even want this, did she.” Charlie sighs and sits next to Dean, putting the rejected cups on the coffee table. “Well, what now?”
I spend the drive sobbing and dodging skinny limbs, the shriek of the tires squealing the only thing louder than the steps that chase me down the highway.
They go on like that for a while. It seems that Dean has fallen into a pattern: bringing Trench on hunts, taking them out to the bunker when he returns. It becomes a comfortable routine, an easy thing to talk about, short periods of time that don't lend themselves easily to big conversations or confessions.
“Can I touch you?” Dean asks, his voice steady. He shows me his hands, proving that they’re empty. There’s a quiver in his voice. He’s shaking.
The second one’s eyes widen. He turns to me. “We’re not queers! I swear I’m not a fag! We were doing drugs!”
And now, for our fourth kiss, with his hands on my waist and my door locked, I can finally just let it happen.
Meg, Jo and Gabe all look at each other as though they're all waiting for one another to say something.
I watch every muscle in the man’s face intently, waiting for the moment when it will click in his brain.
Slowly it comes out, Cas’ voice gaining speed and strength as he continues. He parodies the voices with only a slight change in inflection, but Dean catches on and follows the story.
They talk about everything. That's one of the things he loves—likes—most about Cas, the fact that they can talk forever and never run out of topics; everything sounds interesting in his voice.
I slump down on his bed, hearing the squeak of porn magazines that had been halfheartedly hidden beneath his mattress.
It looks fairly normal. The bed sits in the middle of the back wall, beneath the only window. A few lone shoes are scattered across the floor, and the wardrobe door is half open.
Dean’s the first to break the silence. “My dad’s been… weird about you coming over. Because of the, y’know…” He trails off awkwardly; we all already know what he’s referencing. The news about Hannah got around the school quickly, after one of her friends couldn’t keep her mouth shut. No doubt it reached Sam’s ears, then accidentally slipped out when he wasn’t paying attention. I scoff quietly to myself. The irony of John Winchester, parent of the year, not wanting me at his house. What does he think will happen? I’ll screw up his kids more than he already has?
It’s stupid, but this whole father-quest has forced him to remember things about his own dad, and he doesn’t want it. He doesn’t need it. But he can’t help it.
After ten seconds, she broke the surface again, gasping for air, spitting water out of her mouth, and shaking her head like a dog trying to dry itself off.
“I thought I was meeting you guys at your house,” I tell Dean as he peels away from the sidewalk and starts driving towards the Boardwalk.
By now the rest of the room has zeroed in on the drama and is waiting in a hush to see it play out. The kid continues to face forward, and into the quiet mutters, "Mendel would never betray me like this."
“Well, you got to be divorced. You didn’t need to see him anymore. It was easy for you to be separate, but… he’s still Sam and my’s dad. We can’t divorce out of that one.” He tries for a laugh, but it doesn’t quite make it.
"There's a cat in a raincoat, but no sweater puppy. The news really is awful, isn't it?" Gabe feigns shock.
“I’m waiting outside my friend’s house. Could we talk?” Wow, Dean. Finesse and segue are definitely your strong suits.
But when Cas appears in the middle of the road, she still worries, of course. Cas had flown the coop, and now he’s back and, well, he looks like he’ll pull through, but something has obviously happened regarding the tablet.
He caves under the intense look and tentatively nudges the shoulder next to him. After a delay, Sunglasses manages to sit upright, though Dean suspects his eyes are probably still closed behind the shades.
Jo’s head snaps back up to look at the brunette, brows furrowed in anger. “Why do you have to be such an asshole to everyone all the time? No one finds it cute, or funny, you’re just being a piece of shit!”
In a way, there are some similarities. Everything about a girl is soft, and Dean is soft too. At least, his lips, his skin, and his hair.
, but downstairs is the least he can do. She's laughing as she says goodbye and pushes through the door, and that's when he sees him. Cas, on the steps to the outside door, frozen.
"Never have I ever thought about someone of the same gender in a... sexual or romantic way." I carefully glance around the table, where they all look fairly confused, however none of them appear to be disgusted:  good sign.
Cas traces a circle over the engraving, then takes his hand back and continues talking as if nothing has happened. Dean curls his fingers into a fist around the lighter, letting it rest out of sight for the remainder of their break.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice is softer than Dean would've expected. “I understand what it's like, too. My mom wasn't thrilled, nor my family. I didn't realize you were still closeted.”
“Pretty impressive list of accomplishments there,” Bruce says, almost bashful. “D’love to hear your side of events.”
Dean doesn't usually sit so close to the front of the lecture hall, preferring the middle range, but he's running a little late and decides to beeline toward the first empty chair he sees. As he takes off his backpack and slides into the seat, he realizes he's picked a spot next to a preppy-looking student wearing sunglasses. Inside. On an overcast day.
“You’re right, it’s my fault that you decided the best way into my house was through a window.” I roll my eyes.
“It won’t be an issue!” My mother stands up to place a hand on Hannah’s shoulder, “You’ll either get rid of it or marry Michael. Won’t you, petal?” Her voice is sickeningly sweet.
But. But when Cas sits down in the back, something's wrong. She holds out hope when Dean goes around her, but he only puts weapons back in her trunk before he shuts it.
The game is pretty short lived, though; Megan gets bored again and Ash turns the TV’s sound back on. Cas seems a bit miffed, but he doesn't voice anything.
Chirrup! Claire glances at her texts, sends off a response, then back up, telling her story around bites of onion fries. “Well if we're trading... this one I know for certain, and it’s that both Crowley and his mother were personal friends of the boys. Even after all that stuff with Cas. It was practically a buddy-movie.” She chews.
"Oh." This is where I expect Dean to awkwardly climb off of me, and ask me if I could go back downstairs and if we could never talk about this.
"Okay, Cas, I'm going to- I'm going to go and get help. You stay here." She walked away, shivering in her bathing suit, her feet bare.
Castiel pulls out blank notecards and hands them to Dean to make them, since he know Dean enjoys that. Once he’s handed them over he buries himself in reading the text, eyes tracking back and forth. Dean begins the notecards with a distracted start, but manages to get sucked into it. When he announces he’s finished, Cas looks up and they take turns reading out the terms for the other to guess.
Dean just watches Cas, the way his hair curls around his ears, and how his eyelashes flutter, eyes still closed when he returns upright. There are no thoughts in Dean's head, exactly, it's just that his gaze is a tunnel on Cas and there's nothing he can do about it.
She smiles, and Dean takes Trench out to get to the arsenal underneath. To bring back inside the bunker, away from her.
“Watch out, though. I had a buddy who took it back in ’79, and he caught his best friend sleeping with his girlfriend. He started seeing all this disturbing shit. You’ve got to be happy,” he warns me before turning to serve another customer.
Chuck’s eyes light up. “Oh? That’s so cool. I actually took a few electives in that area, though it wasn’t my strong suit at all.”
Eventually I saw a skinny wrist clutched in Hannah's hands, as she fumbled and tried to drag the boy up. He was slipping through her grasp.
With a sigh, Dean throws his phone onto the bed and resolves to stop acting like a little girl. He’s overthinking it, anyway; people get busy, and he can deal with it. It’s Thanksgiving, after all, and Cas’ family lives nearby. Maybe he's already celebrating with them. The silence doesn't mean anything.
He can’t tell if his team is winning, thanks to all the crazy added rules, but he does know that he hasn’t had to chug punch in quite a bit, and for that he’s grateful. Or maybe it was only a few minutes… he can’t really judge the passage of time right now. Anyway, he’s probably in the lead.
Something pangs inside of me. A sense of disappointment, or jealousy. I don't know why, but all of a sudden, there's a sick feeling in my stomach.
They let me go home on the 23rd of December, just in time for Christmas. We all had dinner together on Christmas Eve, which I am sure will go down as one of the worst family dinners in history.
After spotting friends who are already there, the group fills out a booth at a small Mediterranean place. Cas makes introductions to those Dean hasn't met yet as they loiter next to the table.
Right now it's nighttime, a chilly Washington dusk that finds them turning on the heat, traveling in coats. Dinner was pasta, easy, but still with enough personal flair that Cas’ complements had made Dean’s face red. Now they're in the back alley of Dean’s place, hanging out with the garage and recycling cans, smoking and talking.
Dean looks up at him, a little belligerent. "Though it's not like I had the balls to do it while he was alive."
"Language!" John Winchester calls, jogging down the stairs, holding a can of beer in one hand. I divert my attention to the floor when he arrives in the living room. I've never been much of a fan of John, to be honest. He's always seemed shifty, giving a wavering smile that only existed in his mouth, watching Meg or Jo walk away for just a little too long, the sharpness in his tone when he speaks to Dean. The fact that the beers he drinks are more of a permanent fixture in the house than he is doesn't help his case.
My yard's empty, since it's a cold Fall and we're too old for any purpose that it served before. I remember, when I was younger, Dean and I would spray each other with water pistols, while Sam begged to join in, and Hannah, who was having a "rebellious" phase, sat with a magazine and refused, then shouted at us whenever she got sprayed.
Those visits, though, were the only things keeping me alive. Gabe and Jo both brought me books, cassette tapes, and their company. Hannah came, too, and we’d sit in silence and stare at each other for forty-five minutes. She’d sneeze. I would say bless you. We’d hug. She’d go home. Wash, rinse, and repeat.
I salute him in thanks, before climbing the stairs, and find myself opening Dean's bedroom door. Dean's room suits his personality. The decorations clinging to the walls are a mishmash of movie posters, newspaper articles, and photos, mostly of us. I also spot a few topless girls stuck up near his wardrobe, but I divert my attention to the half-naked freckled teenager at the mirror.
“She called me last night. Told me that she was angry at you. I don’t think she hates you. I don’t think she can hate you.” He shakes his head.
Hannah doesn't say anything more, and neither do I, but there's a telepathic connection, and we both confirm that we'll take each other's secrets to the grave.
"Going to have to agree with my partner over there." I gesture to Meg, who places her hand over her heart in faux gratitude.
His tongue moves around quickly, darting and making me suddenly shove myself against him and moan louder. My hands find his hair, tugging at the blondish strands to pull myself forward, to get more of whatever he's doing to me. I'm at his mercy, my dick controlling every one of my movements, and I finally understand why Gabe is so obsessed with sex.
"Cas! Get your ass up here!" a voice calls from upstairs, presumably my all-too-excited-about-Halloween best friend.
No but seriously, thank you to my wildly talented artist, Soph AKA idjitsaviors (I mean did you see that art??? How??? It’s not fair, she’s a good person AND she draws well jfc leave some for the rest of us). Thank you for putting up with my inability to reply to emails and last minute epilogues.
With the gun in one hand, I begin to toss clothes out of it, clambering in. I press my back against a shelf, maneuvering to allow my feet to fit in with me. I slide the door shut, enclosing myself in the pitch black.
Kendall leans forward and starts a very solemn conversation with Cas as he wrestles with a booster seat for Jack, which he either managed to find in this shack or, more likely, brought all the way from home. Cas converses with her as he methodically adjusts it, steals Jack from Dean’s lap, and starts him in on his toddler-approved food. Claire can only stare in confused wonderment at this little family unit. If tears are maybe choking up her throat just a little, she’s taking that to her grave. Watching her dead-dad-surrogate-dad-angel-of-the-lord tenderly care for this baby… well, it makes her feel things, most of them fuzzy.
The kitchen tiles feel cold under my feet, even though I'm wearing socks. I pull a jug of juice out of the fridge and pour myself a glass before making a bowl of cereal. I've hardly sat down before Hannah comes bouncing into the room, red velvet sweater and hair tied back.
“Yeah,” Dean says, looking into Cas’ eyes as they catch only the faintest glimmer of reflected light. “Mostly I did.”
"Dean- shit, I'm-" I struggle to say, only encouraging him to go faster, wilder, rapidly moving his head, digging his nails into my ass, and ten other things that I can't remember.
They end up in another, quieter room, falling onto a couch in the corner; something animated and annoying is playing on the television. Dean takes a sip of his drink, grateful for the time to recompose himself. Someone is heckling Cas and Cas responds in kind, their banter a background to Dean taking stock of the situation. Him and Cas, on their own small couch, in a dark corner. Everything he’d wanted and dreaded when he thought about what might happen at this party, and he’s not sure he can handle it.
Cas mutters that the phrase doesn't work quite so well at nighttime, but stands as well and starts up the steps with a small smile.
After a few minutes, Hannah began breathing deeply, and slowly let go of Adam's wrist. She stood up, still soaking wet, water dripping from her hair, and wiped her eyes.
Dean eats a spoonful of gumbo aggressively. “That’s different. I don’t need to be interesting to study with.”
Baby rocks as Dean shuts her trunk violently. She's still a bit sore from being flipped a few weeks ago, but she takes it. He walks along her side and slides into the front seat, taking a second of silence as everyone else piles in. Then he rolls her engine over and drives her the hell away from the reservoir.
“I found him.” Dean can hear the clicking of her keyboard. “I called Cas first but he didn’t answer. That boy’s voicemail greeting is something else. Anyway, here, I sent you the details. Background, location. Everything I could find, which wasn’t much, honestly.”
But still, she’s more mad at herself than at Cas; now that she’s ready to forgive openly, to talk it out, all those missed opportunities haunt her, and it’s only herself to blame.
“School’s been weird without you. No one knows what happened to you.” We’re speaking in short sentences, attempting to cut ourselves off because we don’t know what to say. What is there to say? The last time I saw her, she was the view from the back of a police car. The last time I saw her, I pulled a gun.
"Anna, back when we were dating, last semester." The mention of Anna doesn't bother me as much as it used to. I'm not sure if I'm even upset that she dumped me, anymore.
“I bet I can!” Adam said confidently, taking the same position that me and Hannah took. He flew off, also flailing before splashing into the water. It wasn’t quite a backflip like Hannah’s was, but it wasn’t quite as bad as mine.
I've been wanting to write this for a while now. It's not exactly a diary, so don't expect the whole "Dear Diary" thing. It's more of... A memoir. It's a way to record my life and the events in it, not that my life is thrilling.
The lecture lets out not long after that, and Dean watches most of the other students filter out before he starts getting ready to go.
“Did you see the look on her face? It was like I’d just slapped her. God, I’m such a bitch.” Jo’s voice is a little muffled, like she’s crying.
