Dean reached for the remote, opened the TV guide and made a happy noise when he saw that a rerun of Dr. Sexy was on. He was about to go to that channel when Cas grabbed the remote out of his hand. "We're not watching Dr. Sexy, Dean."
When Dean was once again filled with awe, it wasn't at the expense of his own self-worth. Not only did Cas paint enormous parts of the world with colour, but… "Shit.
It took everything Dean had not to spit out the sip of hot chocolate he'd just taken, especially at the sound of a choked-off laugh from Sam. With great effort, he swallowed and placed his mug down carefully before looking the girl in the eyes, refusing to meet Sam's mirthful gaze.
so naked as he did now. No one had ever looked at him the way Cas did; no one had ever made him feel like they could see all of him, inside and out. Until now.
Cas knows Dean has a lot of room in his heart, a lot of love to offer. It’s one of the things he’s always loved about him, so he can’t fault him for it now – can’t ask Dean to put limits on his affection. “What happens now, then?”
"Yes," Cas breathed. "I think I'm… almost…" His voice seemed even deeper than usual, and the vibrations of it in Dean's ear had him unable to hold on any longer; he went tumbling over the edge, slicking Cas's hand with his spend. Cas followed him shortly after, and although Dean always thought he looked good, he looked especially beautiful like this, mouth slack and eyes closed as pleasure overtook him. And right after was equally gorgeous, his eyes opening again to look at Dean with total adoration, a happy, sated smile on his face. "That was amazing," he all but giggled, snuggling up to Dean.
They had to weave their way through the guests, earning whistles and catcalls on the way, but Dean was too giddy to let any embarrassment wipe the smile off his face.
“You’re amazing,” Cas says once Dean has come down from the high of his orgasm, thrusting slowly up into him. Dean makes a soft noise at the words; he himself can’t even tell whether it’s meant as dissent or reluctant acceptance, but it makes Cas repeat the sentiment: “You are, Dean. You’re the most incredible human being I have ever met.” His voice is beginning to tremble with arousal now that he’s made Dean come and is finally letting himself pay attention to his own pleasure.
Cas didn’t respond for a moment. His voice was quiet when he finally spoke again. “Do you mean the road trip?”
“Okay,” Dean said slowly, as if he was trying to make sense of it all in his head. Cas couldn’t blame him; he’d spent years on trying to make sense of it himself, so it was only natural that Dean would need a moment to piece it together. He surprised Cas, however, by continuing after just a moment, “And, um. If I asked you to go out on a date with me…”
what I want,” Dean insists, blushing. It’s what he’s always wanted with the people he’s slept with, but he has never been as conscious of it as he is now, with Cas’s firm hand on his jaw and his demand for answers. Nor has he ever wanted it as much, he thinks. “I want you to – to do whatever you want with me. If,” he falters, “if there’s anything you want at all.”
Everyone around him seemed to be having a great time, cheering and dancing with their friends, singing along to the music from the nearest float and waving their flags and banners high in the air. Cas had thought that maybe he, too, would get into the spirit of things, the way everyone seemed to during Pride, but it turned out it was possible to feel lonely even in the midst of a parade full of happy, exuberant people. He looked at the nearest banner, proclaiming that “LOVE IS LOVE”, reminding him that what most of the other people were celebrating was
Dean’s arousal is starting build, getting closer and closer to the point where he – with only a little help from his own or Cas’s hand – will be able to tip over the edge into what he can tell will be a glorious orgasm. He tries to go faster, but Cas tightens his arms around his waist and slows him down until the pace is unbearably slow, just the barest movement of Cas’s cock inside him. But then Cas reaches one hand up to Dean’s chest and another down to Dean’s thigh, his fingers plucking at the needle hubs, making Dean involuntarily arch his back against Cas and gasp.
Cas is… built, Dean realises once his shirt is gone. Not gym buff built, but certainly thicker and more defined than his trenchcoat has ever revealed. It seems a waste, really, that he never wears anything that emphasises his body; he’d probably be getting offers left and right if he did.
From anyone else, Dean might have interpreted it as a suggestive question, but Cas meant it genuinely, and a fondness for him rose in Dean's chest. "I don't know. Go outside, maybe?" He stepped closer and put his hands on Cas's shoulders, just wanting to touch him now that he was finally allowed. "We could make snow angels," he suggested teasingly.
Cas nods, and then he lets a hand travel along Dean’s side and further back, until he can reach the place Benny’s fingers just occupied. He doesn’t have to touch Dean here to do it, but he wants to – makes Dean slicker before he pushes two fingers inside and lets his grace flow through them into Dean, who sounds like his breath is being punched out of him.
The nurse gives a short nod. “I’ll go and get a doctor. You’ll need to be examined now that you’re awake.”
"Why don't you have the beds pushed together so it's one big bed, like when we have other guests? So it's like Mom and Dad's bed?"
“Only you can decide if you want to have sex with her, Dean… but I would not mind watching if you do.”
As happy as it made Dean to hear Cas express a wish to stay in bed longer together – as much as he wanted to – he also couldn't wait to show him the house. "I have something to show you. A surprise."
Just when Sam has left Dean sweating long enough that his t-shirt has begun to turn damp, he decides to speak.
"I thought I heard Sam and Eileen return," Cas said in explanation for why he was standing at the window. "But it was just a different car passing by."
“May I ask…” Cas held Dean’s gaze for a moment before his eyes flickered to the floor. “Never mind. You’ve made up your mind. It’s not my place to…”
Cas lifts up the blankets in invitation, and Dean stops talking. He just stands there for a moment, looking, and then he seems to shake himself and walks toward the bed, hugging the pillow in front of him.
Donna being tireless and Cas having angel stamina, they go on long enough for Donna to reach no less than five orgasms. Dean ends up edging almost by accident, backing off every time he gets close, not wanting to get off long before Donna and Cas are finished. Each time, it gets harder and harder to pull away from the edge again, and in the end he’s a complete wreck, the near-orgasm constantly buzzing in his veins. He hardly dares lay a single finger on himself anymore for fear that he’ll explode instantly, and when Cas finally orgasms and Dean doesn’t have to hold on anymore, he doesn’t know what happens first – whether he shoots before he gets a hand on his dick or it's the other way around. He thinks maybe it’s the former, but either way his orgasm is too spectacular to care.
“Why not?” Sam’s brow furrowed as if the answer wasn’t obvious. As if Cas’s omega scent wasn’t so damn overpowering it was hard to think around him.
All thoughts of Santa and presents seemed to be instantly forgotten, however. "You were kissing!" Charlie exclaimed triumphantly, and she and Bobby started jumping with joy – literally – around the room as they repeated Charlie's words over and over again. Dean was painfully aware of the state of both him and Cas underneath the blankets, and when the kids started climbing up onto the bed, he panicked. It wouldn't normally be a problem, but now…
The sound of the knocking is loud in the otherwise peaceful forest where the only other sound is that of birds singing. The quiet makes it easier to hear the scrape of a chair inside, the slight creak of footsteps over wooden flooring. For each step Dean hears, the feeling of
"So…" she said with a knowing smile. "Slept well?" Her expression was more fond than sly, but her meaning was still clear. She knew about the bed. She must have known what her kids were up to yesterday, before she and Sam even left the house. Dean wondered if he should worry about his brother and his sister-in-law being okay with their kids' nefarious plans.
, which, I mean, technically you aren't one, but Matthew definitely is, and you've got man bits anyway, and – I mean, not that I'm interested in Matthew, 'cause I'm, I’m definitely not, but I had
Dean never needs much preparation these days, not with how often he has Cas or a toy inside him and how he's learned to relax his muscles, so Cas doesn’t make him wait. One finger quickly turns to two, twisting and turning for a few moments to make sure Dean’s ready before they’re withdrawn, and then Cas pulls at Dean’s waist. Dean goes willingly up onto just his knees, hovering over Cas’s lap where Cas positions his cock at Dean’s entrance. When he’s lined up, Dean sinks down, slowly, while Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s waist. Cas kisses his neck once he’s seated and murmurs praise in his ear, making Dean blush. It’s not a rare occurrence, but Dean doesn't think he'll ever get used to it – especially when there’s not much pain to distract him from the words – and so he tries to focus on the feeling of the needles again as he starts to move.
It starts out slow, out of consideration for Dean, but soon he starts getting impatient, fucking himself faster on their cocks. After that, it becomes fast, uncoordinated, and Dean cries out every time one of them thrusts into him, barely able to catch his breath in between.
“Doesnt mat–?” Dean breaks off, scandalised. “Of course it matters. The whole point of watching is… y’know, getting turned on. You need to find at least one of the people involved attractive.”
It's his inner thighs, however, that are wiped with an alcohol swab next, and then Cas is opening packets of higher-gauge needles – thinner needles for the thinner, more delicate skin there. Cas doesn't bother with the marker this time. He most likely doesn't even need it to place the needles perfectly; if there's something Cas has a lot of experience with, it's precision with sharp, pointy things.
“Oh.” An adorable blush made its way up Cas’s neck, even as he rubbed sleep out of his eyes. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to fall asleep, I just wanted to rest for a few minutes. How long…?”
angel Cas, best friend Cas – touching himself and by the deep, rumbling sound coming from his chest, so when Alicia moans “God, look at him” in Dean’s ear it’s a relief. He’s just following yet another order. “Look at how turned on he is by us,” she says, and Dean’s nothing if not obedient in bed, so he does. He looks at the pearl of precum that appears at the slit of Cas’s cock, looks at Cas’s hand stroking, squeezing a little each time it nears the head, looks at Cas’s eyes flicking between where Dean’s cock is sliding in and out of Alicia and, every so often, Dean’s own.
“Jesus,” Dean whispered, tears in his eyes again, for a different reason this time. “I’m such an idiot.”
He knows he’s right when Sam suggests that Dean get Cas to bed and goes off to sleep in his own bedroom.
"That's enough, you two. That's not an appropriate question to ask someone. Come on, let's finish decorating the tree."
Dean’s breath caught in his chest. “We don’t have to – just because, um. I mean, we’re not standing underneath it.”
It doesn’t make Dean feel looser, but when Benny adds his fingers, he doesn’t feel particularly tight either – but it still pulls a moan from Dean’s throat.
Cas is challenging him, which ironically is the last thing Dean needs, as his body reacts to it by wanting to slip under, but he fights it; fights it when Cas pushes the next needle through slowly, prolonging the burn, fights it when Cas plays with the needle hubs, turning them this way and that, twisting the needles and setting his skin on fire.
“Oh.” Cas wasn’t ashamed of his asexuality, per se, but he hadn’t really spoken to anyone about it either. Not to mention it was kind of unnerving to tell the boy he liked that he wasn’t interested in sex. “Um. It’s the asexual flag.”
When he reaches for the button on Cas's pants, he finds himself conscious of just how close he is to Cas's erect penis. This is not at all what he thought he'd be doing right now – and yet, he hasn't refused. He wonders just how far he'd be willing to take this, just by following orders. He wonders if he's soon about to find out.
Finally, Cas and Eileen came into the living room again, kids in tow, and then the kids ran in front of them again.
"You're the one who has showed me everything that has ever mattered to me, Dean. The time I have known you may be short compared to the rest of my existence, but it doesn't feel that way. It feels like this – the time I have spent in your presence – is the only time I have truly lived. The rest of my existence pales in comparison."
"Of course we do, Dean. Since when have you and I never worried about each other when the other one might be in danger?"
Dean hangs onto the words; lets them pull him back from the edge. "Yes," he breathes desperately, letting his eyes flutter open again. Yes, he does. He knows it won’t happen if he goes under; they’ve discovered that neither he nor Cas enjoy sex when he’s out of it. Cas doesn’t have a preference between sending Dean into subspace and having sex; he likes both equally, and truth be told, so does Dean, but right now he really wants to feel Cas inside of him.
The words had an impact on Cas, and if his choked moan was any indication he wasn't going to last long, but then neither was Dean. He was close already, subconsciously tightening his fist around Cas's, and Cas responded in turn by speeding up.
The first night in Sam and Eileen's house was always the best – especially this time of year, when the beds in the guest room were covered in enough blankets to stave off the cold of the Vermont winters. There was something so comforting about sinking into the warmth of the bed; it brought a feeling similar to the one Dean thought he could still remember – vaguely – from when he was four and his mother had tucked him into bed, kissing his forehead and telling him angels were watching over him.
Cas doesn’t noticed that Benny has removed his fingers until Dean pulls off as he thrusts his hips back, impatient. “Come on, Benny. Fuck me.”
Maybe Cas was figuring things out on his own. Maybe he was using his fingers to get relief. Maybe Dean could just leave and–
With a glance at Dean’s crotch, Cas seems satisfied that Dean’s ready, and he pinches Dean’s skin with his the thumb and index finger on his left hand while he brings the needle up to Dean's skin with his right hand. He starts at the top, right beneath the clavicle, where it's too close for Dean to see properly. There's a sharp sensation, and before Dean knows it, the needle has gone all the way through from one of the blue dots Cas drew to another. It stings, but in the best way possible, and it creates a heat underneath his skin that travels down his body, a zing of pleasure that makes his dick jump. Somehow, there’s no blood at all.
He didn’t know how long he’d been in there when the door opened and Sam entered. No sign of Cas, thankfully, although the scent of him lingered around Sam.
"Yeah, well." Dean gave Cas what he liked to think was a winning smile. "I'd like me better than hot chocolate, too."
"Hey, uh. When are you guys picking up the kids? I was going to show Cas the, uh – the thing." He lowered his voice as if Cas could glean what the "thing" was if he didn't, sending Sam a significant look. He only realised Sam hadn't told Eileen about it yet when she looked confused. "A surprise for Cas," he clarified for her sake. "And you and the kids too, kinda. But…" He met Cas's eyes over the mug of coffee Cas was holding up to his lips. "Mostly Cas."
"I need to use the bathroom." He realised too late that it sounded like he just wanted an excuse to get out of there – like Cas had made him uncomfortable – so he followed it up with "I'll be back in a minute. We can rewind and watch the rest if you want."
Suddenly, Cas does something that has Matthew calling out and reaching out with a hand to steady himself. On Dean’s shoulder. It remains there, squeezing, as Matthew moans again, and Dean… well, he’s in on this, isn’t he? It would be rude to ask him to remove his hand.
If Dean’s mind had been clearer, and if it hadn’t been his own ass that was about to get fucked, he would have asked if Cas was sure he didn’t need any prep. As it was, he knew Cas would be able to take it – and enjoy it.
Dean says nothing, and Cas thinks for a moment that his hesitance means he doesn’t want Cas there, but then he meets Dean’s eyes, and he can tell. Can tell Dean wants him there, can tell that Dean’s waiting to see if Cas wants it too.
“Yeah, well.” Dean’s face reddens, and he casts a glance at Sam, who is already in the process of quietly leaving the room. “You thought we were married. If it weren’t for your memory loss, you wouldn’t – if you were yourself, you’d never have wanted –”
It turned out Dean’s father hadn’t needed to bother with any kind of secretiveness, as Sam had noticed what was going on and nudged their mother, and all of a sudden there seemed to be some kind of game of Chinese whispers going on – except everyone seemed to get the message loud and clear, as they all went quiet and turned expectantly to Cas and Dean, excitement in their eyes. It did nothing to calm Dean’s nerves, but he closed his eyes and took a deep breath before he finally let himself slip off the log and down in front of Cas, the snow crunching underneath the one knee he was kneeling on.
It’s not until they’re in the car that Cas learns his husband’s name, when Sam says it: Dean. Cas likes the name; likes having something to call him in his mind now. “Dean,” he says, trying out how the name feels on his tongue.
"Who would I tell? Everyone knows, Dean. You're not as good at hiding it as you think you are." Cas looked as playful as he only ever did here, and Dean felt a sudden warmth suffusing his core, threatening to spill over into a smile of his own.
Once Alicia has shown Dean and Cas to her bedroom, she tells them to make themselves comfortable while she goes to freshen up. Dean and Cas both watch her go, hips swinging from side to side. “Hot, isn’t she?” Dean asks to cover up his nerves. He’s had enough time to come to terms with the fact that yes, they’re really going to do this, but that doesn’t mean he’s not the slightest bit nervous about getting intimate with a woman in front of Cas.
The plagued look on Cas’s face morphed into something different—into a look of confusion, eyebrows drawn together.
He doesn’t open his eyes right away, afraid of being met yet again with the sight of an empty forest. When he finally does, however, Jack is – not there, exactly. Not in the way Dean’s there, as close to physical as it’s possible to claim someone can be in Heaven. It’s more like… he’s been there all along, and Dean just didn’t see the shape of him in the trees, in the air, in the grass until now.
“Don’t worry,” she assures him as she comes up behind him to lay her hands on his exposed hipbones. “I can appreciate a man undressing his friend. Go on.”
The more Cas speaks, the more Dean seems to be drawing away from him, increasing the distance between them. It hurts, and Cas reaches out to touch his arm in an attempt to keep him from withdrawing further. Thankfully, Dean doesn’t pull away from his touch, although he does stare at Cas’s hand dolefully. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Not that Dean felt he needed a spark, personally; he was content with the mellow, domestic quality their relationship had taken on over the years. He’d thought Cas was, as well, but he supposed when you’d lived for millennia and seen everything the world had to offer, domesticity didn’t have much to offer in comparison.
"Dean," Cas laughed all of a sudden, his voice warm and his eyes full of mirth. "Relax. Poltergeist?" He shook his head. "Never mind, you can tell me later. But Dean…" He squeezed Dean's hands gently, even though they were clammy and almost slipping in his grasp. "Nothing would make me happier than moving here with you."
, and it never failed to fill Dean with warmth when he entered it. Especially when it was decorated for Christmas, like now, the lights and garlands and figurines bringing Dean a sense of joy and wonder that he couldn't ever remember getting from Christmas as a child. Of course, the smell of Eileen's home cooking didn't hurt, either.
He watches while the bevel of another needle enters his skin, flesh giving way like butter as the needle slides smoothly through it and out the other side. Cas tugs the plastic hub downward, giving the needle an experimental twist, and an involuntary moan tears out of Dean's throat. He's getting more sensitive the closer Cas gets to his nipple, and the twist of the needle stings in a way that makes the edges of his consciousness start to go fuzzy
Bobby giggled at Dean's new "Santa beard" and stood up to touch it, and almost immediately he, too, was hit by a snowball.
"Do you admit defeat?" Cas's eyes were filled with childlike glee, and although Dean gave it one more futile attempt, he didn't have it in him to be annoyed with him.
It only took Dean a few more thrusts before he, too, toppled headlong into an orgasm that felt like flying, soaring. His hips jerked against Cas as if trying to wring every drop of semen out of him, and finally he slumped against Cas, exhausted, resting his head in the crook of Cas’s neck.
Dean doesn’t know if he’s going to regret this later; if he has just let himself get caught up in the sight and sounds of sex and in his own arousal. Right now, he doesn’t care. Doesn’t care that the person giving him a blowjob is a dude; doesn’t care that it turns him on even more when Cas looks on with a dark, lustful gaze. Doesn’t care that he ends up spilling in a man’s mouth or that he slides out from underneath the guy to give him a hand while Cas fucks him until they all collapse in a sated pile.
Cas, it seems, doesn’t find it weird that Dean is continuing the conversation from ten minutes earlier, nor has he forgotten what they were talking about.
The next time, Dean is in his room when Cas comes inside and starts backing him against the wall, eyes dark. Dean hasn’t even
Once, Cas even puts a hand around Dean’s neck and squeezes, but it’s gentle enough that Dean wonders if Cas just wants to see his reaction, to see if he’ll fight it. He probably couldn’t if he tried, and his eyes flutter closed as he relaxes into it. Cas releases his grip, and Dean automatically sways forward, seeking the touch again before he can catch himself. Afterwards, he wonders what the hell just happened, but he comes harder that night than he has in a long time.
“Here, son.” John handed the box back to Dean and squeezed his shoulder, giving him a secretive smile.
He didn't have to pull Cas off him; Cas was already moving, getting to his feet and offering Dean a hand up. "We should go inside." Cas was shivering, too, so he'd clearly used up too much of his juice to do anything about it.
“What is it about this that you like, Dean?” Cas wraps his hands around Dean’s wrists and pins them to the wall on each side of Dean’s body, which is similarly pinned by Cas’s own body pressing deliciously against him.
"Um. Sweetie, Uncle Cas and I aren't… we're not… a couple." The words "Cas" and "couple" in the same sentence felt weird and foreign on his tongue.
But the thing is, it doesn’t, somehow. It doesn’t feel any less natural than Dean being his husband. “No.” Cas shakes his head and reaches for Dean’s hand. Dean stiffens, but allows Cas to take it and lace their fingers together. “I would never dismiss anything that might help me remember our life together.”
Dean's world became reduced to the shaky, stuttered breaths Cas had to break their kisses to release, the occasional helpless moan from either of them and the building pleasure that coursed through him. It was as if he and Cas were the only two people in existence.
a part of that community. It wasn't like he hadn't known he wasn't straight, but he'd never considered that it meant he was part of a group. That there were people out there who had struggled with the same things he had, and that he was allowed to identify himself with them. He'd always felt that the pride flag was for all those other people, not for him, but now – especially knowing Cas had had a part in creating rainbows to begin with— "As
“I’m fine,” Dean answers, and then adds, “I need your dick in me,” which probably isn’t what Cas meant – he was probably thinking more along the lines of a snack or something to drink – but it seems of utmost importance to Dean right now, and it makes Cas laugh.
“Cas…” Again, Dean’s voice is pained, and he has a regretful look in his eyes. “I’m really sorry, but…” He squeezes Cas’s hand. “This isn't… Cas, we’re not really married. I just had to pretend at the hospital so they’d let me stay with you.”
“Mr. Winchester?” the nurse says, and the man in the leather jacket looks up at her, but it wasn’t him she was talking to. “Castiel?” she adds. The way she makes eye contact and comes closer makes it very clear who she’s addressing.
“Cas,” he said, the tremor from before even more evident in his voice now, but the wonder in Cas’s eyes gave him the courage he needed to continue. “I wasn’t planning to do this quite like this. But… I guess it’s kinda fitting that it’s happening in front of my family, ‘cause… Cas, it would mean the world to me if you would be my family, too.”
"Hey. Cas." Dean put a hand on the back of Cas's neck, playing gently with the short hairs there. He didn't usually wake Cas up when they weren't on a case, but he was excited – and a tiny bit nervous – for today, and he'd been listening to the sounds of Sam and Eileen puttering about the house for the better part of an hour already, waiting for Cas to wake up on his own.
Castiel sucks in a breath; he begins to whimper. Tears well in his eyes the longer he holds eye contact with Dean who stands resolute. Mary adjusts the fabric on Castiel’s wound and he turns to her. Attempting to thank her, Castiel can’t meet Mary’s eyes. Shame and sorrow builds in his chest. Castiel cries as the Winchesters walk away; he’s scared and unable to follow. He doesn’t want any of them to die battling a fight made for him.
“It’s no problem.” Although Castiel is well versed in most human languages, he simply allows Eileen to read his lips as he is not ready to let go of the blanket in response yet. Castiel follows Eileen back through the hall, aiming towards the library until the hunter stops in her tracks. Castiel pauses as well, tilting his head in curiosity. Eileen doesn’t let him question it long though, looking at the angel with a look of sympathy in her eyes.
The words sting. Castiel knows they shouldn’t; he knows that Dean didn’t mean it in that way. Still Castiel hid his emotions behind closed eyes. He was no angel.
“Now, now. Weren’t you clinging to me just a second ago? Crying cause I was under a different omega.” Dean leans into Castiel’s space, lips brushing over Castiel’s earlobe. “Don’t you wish it was you I was underneath?”
If only Dean could feel the same way. If only he weren't dead to the man he sacrificed everything for. Both past, present, and future.
Dean gasps, pulling away from Castiel’s ass. Looking behind him, Castiel mewls at the sight he sees. Slick coats Dean’s tongue, hangs off of his chin and dribbles onto the mattress. Dean wipes what remnants of Castiel he can before climbing back on top of the omega.
Like most humans, these were the years that he noticed cravings. The need for certain scents and the touch of different textures. For comfort in close proximities – much to one of the Winchester’s distaste as a dormant part of Castiel pulled himself closer to the rugged young alpha. For every time Dean took a step to further distance himself away from the angel, Castiel took one step forward. This was the first time he
“Doesn’t look like you have space to store most of your belongings so I didn't bring much stuff this time around. Just a couple toys, here’s one blanket. It should keep you warm at night and um, I’m leaving the credit card open for the motel room. You should stay here until your heat resides. Maybe stick around longer. You know, so you have somewhere to go until you find a place to live.”
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” Castiel speaks like it’s a remorseful promise to not hurt Dean anymore. Not in the physical sense, at the very least. Castiel looks down on Dean with just a hint of wonder behind his gaze.
Like many things, Dean is the exception to the rule. Dean is a warm fire during a snowstorm - someone he curls up next to when his omega insists that Castiel is cold. He is a roaring river in otherworldly calm waters - the reason that Castiel's scent flares up when they argue. He causes a tremor in Castiel’s chest beneath his ribcage where one's heart would be - a sentiment Sam has taken to rolling his eyes at.
Castiel is still weak. His limbs tired and his grace faltering from having done its best in an attempt to heal Castiel’s vessel. There is no debate when Dean tosses Baby’s keys to Sam, demanding that he take good care of her as he hauls Castiel off to the truck, dead set on driving him back to the bunker where the angel could rest.
“I’m here,” Dean whispers into Castiel’s ear. He nibbles along the curve Castiel’s neck, palms rubbing the omegas sides. “I’m here.”
"I'm not sure those were your exact words." Sam smirks, but then he holds up his phone in explanation. "Cas texted. He wants me to grab some of his stuff from the truck."
Her name was April. She was kind and warm hearted and sleeping with her had momentarily mended some of Castiel’s aches and pains. After so many cold nights alone and utterly human, he felt safe held in her arms. Safe enough that he let his guard down and showed vulnerability to someone he only met that night.
“Things will be different and they’ll be able to handle these smaller threats!” Jack becomes frantic, his hands flailing before him. “It’s the apocalyptic ones I’m worried about, Castiel. The battles Sam and Dean can’t win!”
Dean’s lips knew where to suckle and kiss; his tongue knew how to slither in its movements. Even Dean’s nose pressed at the right crooks and angles, pushing down on Castiel’s scent gland to coax out more of his scent. Dean’s touches were warm, comforting, and protective. Castiel felt safe in his hands - at home in Dean’s grasp.
“You what?” Panic surges throughout Dean’s whole being. He grits his teeth, refraining himself from pandering Castiel.
Once Mary has said her goodbyes to her sons, she comes to Castiel as well. Her arms are already stretched out and the words of regret get stuck in his throat as she wraps them around him. Part of Castiel wants to pull away but instead he burrows his forehead in the crook of her neck and chokes on a sob.
“I know,” Jack assures him. “And they deserve to be happy. They can’t be if we continue to drag them into battle.”
Castiel’s eyes flicker between his twitching fingers and the sigil threatening to break where it's painted on the door. “When Jack was dying, I – I made a deal. To save him.”
Castiel whines. It’s not enough, he wants more. Castiel begs for more in the way he tugs at Dean’s hair. He doesn’t ask for permission as his hands tangle themselves in Dean’s shirt and uncoordinatedly shoves at the fabric to come off.
“Cas. Hey, buddy,” Dean cages the delirious omega in between his arms, his voice capturing Castiel’s attention. “Gonna fuck you now, okay?”
Dean was his home and the beast growing inside Castiel, working to break itself free, knew that Dean was his only.
When he next sees the younger Winchester, Sam is wearing the scarf of his old lover wrapped around his neck.
“Dean…” Drowsy voiced, Castiel looked up at the alpha with half-lidded glassy eyes. He reached with his hands, cupping Dean’s cheeks. He opens his mouth to say something, lip quivering. But the way that Dean gleams down at him - hungry and steely eyed - Castiel can’t catch his breath. Instead he settles for shutting his eyes and touching foreheads.
As it was, Castiel’s vessel - Jimmy Novak - was not a man that stood out. He was a mere beta mated to another beta by the name of Amelia. Sure, the two fostered and borne a child but neither carried instincts too strong for them to overcome. Living within Jimmy’s vessel, Castiel was never drawn to cute fragile omegas nor fiercely strong alphas. Not in a sense that he couldn’t live without them. Castiel had not ever succumbed into a knot-starved heat nor felt the overbearing urge to rut.
Blue eyes meet green eyes. The scent of an aroused omega bombard Castiel’s nostrils, the whine of a lustful brunette echoing in his ear. The woman on top of… on top of Dean nuzzles against his chest, pawing at the man’s dress shirt that is torn at the top button. Dean doesn’t say a word as he stares caught like a deer in the headlights. Castiel feels sick.
“Or that too.” Castiel grimaces, taking a swig of the bottle he holds in his hands. Alcohol never used to affect Castiel unless in extremely large quantities but the beer tastes bitter in his mouth now. The rising heat in his cheeks is a firm reminder of how utterly human he is now. “Dean was never one for tact.”
Jack opens his mouth then shuts it again, biting his lip. What he has to say takes a tremendous toll on his courage. “Would you rather come to Heaven with me or -”
Castiel squirms underneath Dean, the inside of his thighs rubbing against the hunter’s hips. The omega wiggles restlessly, needy little whines escaping his parted lips. Dean biting his bottom lip, studying Castiel all so intimately. The sight has Castiel’s heart beating fast. Giving into the urge to cling onto the alpha, Dean allows for Castiel to pepper kisses over his tilted neck. Allows the omegas claws to dig into his back as Dean’s fingers ghost over his prick and squeezes his balls. Dean shushes Castiel’s whine as his fingers push through the mess of slick, penetrating his hole two at a time. The calloused fingers dig into Castiel, nearly searching for something. Castiel is sure Dean finds it when he has to stifle a cry by biting his lip. Dean pulls away, coating his cock in the omegas natural lubricant, lining himself up with Castiel's hole.
Dean walks away; he demands that Castiel and Sam keep their distance. Promises not to miss a killing blow the next time that they attempt to stop him. The angels’ speech rewinds in his head, however, sounding relatively alike to how Cain spoke of Collette the first time they have met. How she had only hoped that Cain would stop one day and forever.
Castiel comes on Dean’s knot, the alpha tied in him spurting gallons of cum. They don’t talk as they wait for the swelling to go down. When Dean leaves, Castiel finally picks up his phone, reading the message he was sent.
Mary keeps one hand on each of the boys shoulders when she let’s go of their embrace. Dean’s sniffling, his fist furiously wiping away the tears at his eyes. Sam doesn’t shy away from the tears that streak his cheeks, standing tall as he looks down at his mother and cries. It’s time to say goodbye.
Castiel mewls, mouth widening to be a victim of Dean’s ministrations. Castiel's fingers thread in Dean’s hair, pulling him in close until they breathe the same air. For the first time in a long time, Castiel believes that humanity is beautiful. That this fleeting moment that Castiel has Dean in his arms is what it means to be human. The whole night in its entirety had been a dream and now… to still be in Dean’s arms. A purr reverberates from Castiel’s chest with a resounding rumble vibrating along his partner’s chest. This single moment feels right and perfect. Castiel doesn’t think anything could ever provide a larger limelight to these precious seconds.
Dean blinked his eyes open at the feeling of someone running their hand through his hair. He was too sleepy to realise where he for a second, but… that wasn't a pillow beneath his head; it wasn't soft enough. It was… a shoulder. Cas's shoulder. And that was Cas's hand in his hair. Dean closed his eyes and leaned into it like a cat, not yet awake enough to realise what he was doing until he heard Cas huff a quiet laugh. He opened his eyes again and reluctantly removed his head from Cas's shoulder, blushing and looking at the screen rather than at Cas. The movie had ended, and he had no idea how long ago.
He got his answer when Cas wrapped his arms around him and pulled him in for an enthusiastic kiss that made Dean feel like his heart was swelling in his chest.
Like the place where he found Cas in Purgatory the first time, apart from the green foliage on the surrounding trees.
"You know what? I wasn't going to get you back for the snowball fight, but now…" He shook his head, unable to completely suppress the smile that demanded to be let out. "I'll get you when you least expect it."
“Try,” Cas says softly in Dean’s ear, and Dean nods obediently. Cas goes back to touching the needle hubs again, running his fingers over them and turning them. The burn of it, combined with the feeling of Cas’s cock against his prostate and its slow movements against Dean’s sensitive rim, brings Dean closer to the edge again. He feels pleasure coil in the pit of his stomach, so slowly and so intensely that it can almost be mistaken for pain somehow, but then the two are often the same for Dean anyway.
Dean laughs and pushes gently at Cas’s shoulder until he takes a step back and lets Dean follow him inside his cabin. It’s warm and cozy, and it feels like Cas – but it also feels like the kind of place where Dean could see himself settling down.
“I’m sorry, Dean.” Cas can tell his voice sounds wrecked, but there’s little he can do to prevent it. “I thought… I thought you prayed to me. I heard…” He shakes his head. How can he explain it? He
The next time, it’s Cas who gets propositioned. Clueless as always, he doesn’t realise that the blonde is trying to get his attention until Dean tells him and encourages him to go talk to her. She looks to be somewhere in her fifties, still smoking hot and clearly on the prowl, and Dean would have gotten cougar vibes from her if Cas had been about a gazillion times younger than he actually is.
Cas’s chest heaved, as if he had forgotten to breathe for a moment – which he may well have, considering he hadn’t needed to for most of his life – and then he glanced across the room and let out a startled laugh. “Um. Dean, I think we have an audience.”
Dean looked away from Cas, and the scenery turned blurred and watery in front of him. “‘Kay. My mistake.”
"Charlie, Bobby, don't you think you're getting too big for that stuff?" Sam had a big smile on his face as he spoke and signed the words at the same time. It distracted Bobby enough that he didn't expect it when Cas suddenly picked him up and hoisted him up over his head, drawing sudden peals of laughter from the child.
"Do we have to?" Cas asked, mouth planting itself on Dean's jaw now that Dean's own lips weren't covering it.
Dean exhaled a quiet "holy shit" in wonder. When he met Cas's gaze, Cas looked as awestruck as Dean felt, except he was looking at Dean, not the spectacular light show in the sky.
Castiel at full-force began to refuse to help Dean anymore. The sight of the pink residue the Rit Zien left behind had caused him to go into a frenzy knowing full well Castiel was the reason he and the other angels were now trapped on Earth. The Rit Zien was certain to pick up on the despair of many of the humans that resided in Rexford. Though, the poor souls, some had only felt a momentary pain. Pain that would resolve itself eventually while others may have suffered for longer but… in the end they could have all gotten better. The souls could have lived long happy lives had it not been for the Rit Zien that had taken it all away from them. Further guilt fell upon Castiel’s shoulders. If it weren’t for his trust in others who had easily manipulated Castiel, those humans would still walk on Earth.
And as the day drags on, he comes to know he likes Eileen. She is more than suitable for the younger Winchester. Spirited and strong willed. Very pretty and though she is an omega just as Sam is, Castiel is certain they make a great pair.
Dean grit his teeth as he lowered his arm. Bowing his head, Dean looked down to the floor. He could fight or he could wait but he wouldn’t risk harming Castiel in any way.
“I can see that.” Castiel scowls at the Winchester, anger bubbling to a boil in the pit of his stomach.
"D-Don't leave!" Drool pooled at the corner of Castiel's mouth, his vision blurring. Castiel inhaled in an attempt to catch his breath but then he tasted wonderful apple pie. Castiel moaned, shifting his legs as his jeans became soaked with slick.
"Not now." Dean licks a long line up Castiel's neck, sucking on the omegas scent gland. Castiel's breath hitches, toes curling. "Deeeean!"
Dean swallows, his eyes becoming doe-like and shining with budding tears. Castiel’s lips tremble, showing the anxiety Castiel had been holding back.
That night, Castiel shares a bed with Dean in the Alpha’s room. His muscles are tensed with knots that won’t loosen without the soothing smell of apple pie and unique leather musk that could only belong to Dean. Castiel’s invisible feathers wouldn’t unfurl without Dean's arms wrapped around Castiel’s waist, pressing the angels back close to his chest. Something in the way Dean grips his hips until the hunters’ knuckles are white brings a certain sense of security to Castiel. He felt protected at that moment, felt wanted in a sense unfamiliar to the angel with failing grace. The way Dean's nose burrowed itself in a deep press against Castiel’s newly formed scent glands caused a purr to get caught in the back of his throat. Castiel gasped at the bump of Dean’s groin against his ass, short little pants had left his lips, shushed only by a nibble to his neck.
Dean’s breath speeds up, and he nods. “Yeah. Shit. But…” He ducks his head. “I still wanna feel the, uh. Stretch.”
Castiel wordlessly stands, the blanket still wrapped around him as he makes his way toward the female hunter. Eileen smiles gently at him as Castiel picks up the jar, opening it for her before handing the jar to her.
Dean doesn’t answer verbally. Instead Dean picks up Castiel’s box of belongings and turns it upside down, depositing all the items onto the bed. Castiel has just enough time to grab his plush bee before Dean shoves aside everything he deems useless. The sex toys clammer on the ground, a blanket slapping Castiel in the chest and then a shirt that is not his own smacking him in the face. Castiel scrambles on the bed, being pushed around again as – Castiel’s eyes go wide.
Castiel shuts his eyes, breathing in Sam’s scent once or twice. The younger Winchester could get his things; Sam was nice like that. Castiel pulled out his phone, texting Sam to make the request. He smiled as Sam replied instantly, agreeing to do so for him. Castiel turned the phone over, not checking the new message that pinged only two minutes later. Sam wouldn’t need help finding his things, he’ll know exactly what Castiel needs. Omegas help each other after all. Castiel sighed, laying his chin on crossed arms. He wondered if Sam would be courteous enough to brew him some tea as well, chamomile preferably.
And like Sam, Dean isn’t far behind in comforting the newly presenting omega. No, the alpha would share his clothing with Castiel because scented objects soothed anxious omegas. A hand on the small of their back calms their riled up temper. Sharing a bed, although Castiel didn’t sleep, seemed to be something he craved. Nearly every night that he spends with Sam and Dean ends in a morning in which one of the boys would awaken next to Castiel curled up in the sheets with them, most often than not Dean.
? From Dean and from Sam? Where was Castiel going? Would he be safe? Why did he leave? And was there more to why Castiel broke free of Naomi’s hold on him? Was there more meaning to saying
Dean doesn’t hurry; he takes the whole thing slow. They sit waiting for Castiel to adjust to Dean’s size and when he does, Dean pulls out in shallow slow thrusts. His length doesn’t leave Castiel empty, sliding out halfway before rolling his hips forward. In every bit of the word, Dean and Castiel are connected from head to toe. Dean’s forehead presses against Castiel’s, his emerald green eyes shut. Beads of sweat gather between them, pants growing louder - needier. All the while, Castiel stares up at Dean with fondness in his gaze, his lips slightly parted in lax affection. One arm loosely wrapped around Dean, one hand tangled in Dean’s hand. Castiel is lost to all but the man above him.
Dean doesn’t bother to reply. He stands rooted to the spot in Castiel’s room with unwavering eyes. It unnerves Castiel but he doesn’t let it show.
Castiel watches the news one morning as the reporters state that humans are disappearing quickly from town in what seems to be a string of precarious similarities. It’s a connection, something that has the local authorities thinking that each “kidnapping” has to do with one another. Castiel can see with his eyes that this is supernatural, that an abomination of some kind must have a hand in this occurrence. The former angel doesn’t think, instead he lets his fingers dial a number he knows deep in the recess of his mind. Castiel had no choice but to call Dean and ask him to investigate. Castiel lies to himself. He tells his omega he doesn't want to hear the alphas' voice, that it doesn't cause shivers up his spine. He tells himself he doesn't want or hope that Dean will visit but when Dean stops by the Gas n' Sip anyways, his heart stutters. Whatever it is that is happening isn't good for his health. So he denies wanting to hunt with Dean, wanting to be close to him at all. But Dean is a stubborn man and an even more charming Alpha. Castiel could never say no to him and so he goes.
Castiel can’t wait to be filled, wants his alpha to pump more of his spunk inside of him. Castiel withers beneath Dean, gnawing at the flesh on the alphas neck. Dean presses in deeper, slipping in another finger in search of the bundle of nerves he found yesterday - the spot he knows will make the omega go insane. Castiel cries out in pleasure, hooking his leg over Dean’s waist to pull him in closer. Dean smirks against Castiel’s chest, leaving a chaste kiss above his heart before lifting up off of Castiel. Dean wears a sly confident smirk, untangling their limbs. His fingers escape the tight clench of Castiel’s hole and Castiel whines at its loss.
Dean’s lips pulled back in a growl, his canine fangs growing in his arousal. Dean leaned down, capturing Castiel’s lips with his own. His hands ventured downward, finger tips leaving shivers along Castiel’s sides. His nails softly scraped along the omegas pale skin, sinking deep into the grip of his hips. Castiel gasped into the kiss, tilting his head to the side, eyelids fluttering shut. Castiel put his trust in Dean, giving him something much more fragile than his life. Castiel wound his arms loosely around Dean’s shoulders, pulling him in closer.
“Why though?” Irritation irks him. “This isn’t… This wouldn’t be the first time that Sam and Dean have seen me in heat. It doesn’t affect you. It won’t hurt anyone. Why should I be forced to be locked away in my room?”
When he was near Dean, on the other hand, it was as if all of his worries had gone away. They no longer mattered and the ache for comfort would subside. Castiel’s fears, his lonesome moods, they would diminish in Dean's presence. Dean caused Castiel’s wings to ruffle, not in agitation but in anticipation. The feeling was a pleasant shock to his bloodstream; a gooey sweet treat that resided in his heart which had not beat until after he put his life on the line for the Winchester brothers. Castiel put Dean’s needs before his own, the others' well being mattered most to him. Oh, how Castiel rebuilt Dean’s body to perfection. Memorized every joint and freckle, bore his gaze into forest green eyes and became overtly absorbed in them. A crack formed in Castiel’s chassis, from the moment he laid his hands on Dean Winchester in hell. He was lost and yet he found a better place - a better human - to come home to.
“I could go with you,” Castiel says it earnestly. His lip wobbles as he stares deep into the windows of Dean’s soul as if a part of the angel will die with Dean. Whether he physically stands by Dean’s side as the bomb goes off or if he has to wait in agonizing time. Every look Castiel gives Dean tells him how Castiel longs to stand at Dean’s aid, to give his life for the elder Winchester. It’s a sad face that Castiel wears and Dean knows he can’t wipe that fear away.
“- stay on Earth… Cas,” Jack looks at Castiel with pity in his eyes. Jack can read the angel like the back of his hand and he reaffirms what he is asking of Castiel. “Cas, if you come with me, you won’t be allowed to come back here.”
Time passes in a blur and neither Castiel nor Dean speak of the incident that occured between them. What happened behind locked doors stayed behind locked doors but Castiel is sure that Sam knows. He was aware after all that Castiel was in heat and Dean in rut when the elder brother insisted on bringing Castiel his belongings. Still Sam didn’t dare comment when a week had gone by before one of the two finally decided to leave Castiel’s nest, leaving a stench of soiled sheets wafting through the halls. It wasn’t as if they had time to speak of it, however, before they had to capture Micheal. Before Sam and Eileen were tricked by Chuck, and Dean and Castiel were sent to Purgatory in an effort to find a blossom that was their only hope of defeating God. There were things that were said but not quite the right words. None of that mattered because they failed in defeating Chuck on their own. Like Sam, they all lost hope.
Part of Castiel believed that maybe Dean would ask him to stay though, after all, he did ask Castiel to wait when he had opened the impala’s door to greet Nora in her home. But that wasn’t what happened. Castiel’s heart sped up as Dean instructed him to discard his vest and unbutton his shirt. His omega mewled and it threatened to purr. Castiel’s hopes had risen, only for Dean to crush those dreams and send him off to see April. He didn’t want him, of course, the alpha wouldn’t want such a wounded omega. A crack embedded itself in Castiel’s heart. Then another and another as Castiel’s date was revealed to be a babysitting gig. Disappointment stabbed at Castiel.
He wanted Dean, wanted all of his things. His love, his affection, his attention. Castiel knew that he would receive none of it. Even their small possessions seemed important, necessary, and all that Castiel could live for. He wanted clothes, maybe Dean's favorite jacket or Sam's heated blanket. He wanted to sit in the impala, smell Baby’s leather seats before he left. Smell the home he made in that car with the Winchester brothers. Perhaps if he… if Castiel were allowed in the bunkers kitchen, he could bake himself an apple pie. Inhale the crisp scent and bemoan his losses.
And when Dean returns home to the bunker, Castiel clings to Dean like a lifeline. Castiel whispers his name like a clutch, silently begging for Dean to stay.
Though Castiel paid the price for free will and he would do it over again. Fall and continue to fall.
“Read the damn boxes,” Dean grumbles into the speaker. “This is embarrassing enough to have to explain.”
Mary walks closer to her two sons and Castiel steps away, suddenly feeling out of place. She passes by Castiel, dragging Dean by the sleeve toward Sam, then she hugs both of her boys in a tight grip. “It was so good getting to see you two again. Getting to know you and see the men that you have become. I’m so proud of you.”
Dean’s heart aches but not because of the hold Billie had on it. No, this time it aches because he was gone. Castiel was gone and all Dean wants to do was sob on the floor for the rest of eternity. Earlier he said he would give it all for Chuck. Now Dean wishes he could take it back. He wishes he could give it all for Castiel. Wishes he had conceded and let Billie take him. Just him. Not Cas.
Dean stays the morning after, arms wrapped tightly around Castiel's back and pressed tightly against him. Castiel's head rests on Dean's chest, legs entangled in one anothers, palms warm on the other's skin. Dean burrows his nose in Castiel's hair, inhaling what the omega hopes in a pleasant smell. A sweet touch of honey and hint of chamomile bursts from Castiel's scent gland as Dean tenderly draws soothing circles along the omegas neck with his thumb. A touch so gentle, so subtle it’s almost insecure and has Castiel mewling in his morning haze.
Castiel’s not sure why Sam and Dean would rescue him to dispose of him like trash but they must have a reason.
“Damn it! Damn it, no!” Dean yells from behind him and there’s only so far Castiel can go without wings.
Dean has an angel blade in one hand and Castiel trapped underneath him, his body withering away on the library floor. Dean sees the haze in Castiel’s eyes, how he struggles to keep conscious. Snagging the angels’ tie in his free hand, Dean drags Castiel forward.
Castiel did not feel the same sentiment. Dean could see the fear in Castiel’s eyes, feel the way he shook each time they touched. Dean rests his hand on Castiel’s knee as the angel gives a speech that shouldn’t be told. Castiel opens up the heart he was not created with on his dying breath and everything clicks in Dean’s head. He can’t let Castiel die.
“With pleasure.” Dean smacks Castiel’s thigh, gripping him tightly so that he doesn’t squirm away. Dean aligns the dildo with Castiel’s hole, sliding it halfway in then pulling it out until only the head of the toy resides. Castiel mewls, chest heaving in anticipation.
Castiel continues to speak his confessions, letting slip an "I miss you," no longer trying to deny what they both know is the issue at hand.
Castiel shook his head, a fist slamming down on the kitchen table. No. No, this wasn’t about Dean. It would be selfish of Castiel to even think that – this wasn’t about Dean. It wasn’t about Castiel. It was about the family that they lost; the Winchesters’ mother and Castiel’s son. If Jack were still here, he would find some way to smile and find the light at the end of this deep dark tunnel. He would be the savior that Castiel had believed him to be since Kelly had allowed him to touch her pregnant belly. Castiel shakily inhaled.
Castiel longed. He longed to be back with Dean and with Sam. To curl up beside the alpha his omega had chosen. To be home and feel at peace. But all Castiel could feel was pain.
"D-Dean!" Castiel's body shook with uncontrollable shivers. He felt so empty; so lonely. "Don't leave! Please! Need you! N-need you, Dean!"
Perhaps Castiel’s new found needs were much like the carnal desire of a human’s secondary gender. How alphas and omegas craved to find a life partner and be mated. Though it didn’t seem possible, Castiel was always an Angel of the Lord. He had no primary or secondary gender. Sexuality never had an effect on him and never would so long as he maintained his position as a heavenly body. Of course, his plans were now delayed. As a falling angel, Castiel became detached from his brethren; no longer of importance to their higher purpose. He was weak both in strength and honor.
Dean had travelled all the way to the Gas n Sip to pick up some of Castiel's belongings. Dean also tells Castiel that he bought him some time off at the convenience store so that he can relax and get used to being in heat.
“But 'is too small,” Castiel slurs. Drool glides down his chin, shoulders shuttering in anticipation. “Want yours.”
“Do it like this…” Castiel knows what he wants. He wants Dean inside of him, wants the alpha to mark him as his. He wants to watch Dean as he fucks him, see in his eyes the pleasure he receives from Castiel. “Fuck me like this…”
Castiel has wanted to share his heat with Dean since the first time they mated together, since before then as well. Now to hear that Dean was in rut at the same time that Castiel’s body was preparing to copulate, it taunts him. It shouldn’t take more than an hour for Dean to head out of the bunker, in search of some pretty female omega to mate at a bar. If Dean were desperate enough, maybe he would even fuck her in the back of an alley way. Castiel growls at the thought. He’s hiding under layers of blankets, one of which feels itchy and makes him want to tear off a wing. Castiel almost wants to return to the mountain town he was staying at only days before, curled in the nest he had to unbuild before returning to the bunker. Here, his nest doesn’t exist. It didn’t feel right to build one in this empty room full of sorrow. As it was, many of his personal items were still in his truck, even the stuffed bee he cherished so much.
Lucky for the omega, Dean didn't leave Castiel to suffer alone. He crawled into bed purring a deep rumble in his throat. Dean nuzzled along Castiel's neck, giving little kitten licks to the omegas scent glands. This earned him a whine from Castiel who arched up into Dean's form. The two melded together in harmony. Where one body moved, the other followed, seeking out as much contact as possible. Castiel's breath hitched, his eyelids fluttering open and shut. Fingers burrow into the fabric of Dean's flannel, insistently tugging. Castiel preened as he felt Dean shimmy his hips between his legs, spreading him open and pressing them flush together from head to groin. It was a welcome sensation Castiel had never felt before. An experiment beyond riches that stole Castiel's breath away.
A whine catches between tightly clasped lips, sweat beading down Castiel’s forehead. His vision blurs as he blinks into awareness, a steady ache in his head. A quilted blanket Castiel doesn’t recognize slips from his shoulders. Castiel catches it just before it falls, wrapping the comforting item around himself and tucking his chin within it. The fabric smells like omega, a mix between Sam and Eileen, no doubt something they slept in at one point. Pots and pans clank behind Castiel’s back, a scurried hand rummaging through the cupboards. Sniffing loudly, Castiel slowly turns to see Eileen stretch her body upward in an attempt to reach something on the top shelf, her fingers just barely grazing a jar of jam.
“Thank you. Thank you. Knowing you… it’s been the best part of my life. And the things we’ve – the things we’ve shared together… they have changed me.” Castiel’s eyes travel, his head turning to and from each person that watches over him. As if he were speaking to them all but a part of Dean is certain that Castiel hides a hidden message between his breaths just for him.
He was pushed away by the man he fell for; by the only man he longed for. Castiel held his tears as he stood outside the bunker. The feeling of sorrow overwhelms him, swallowing him whole in a painfully tight grip. Castiel choked on a sniffle, his fist balled up in a borrowed hoodie and raised to wipe at his eyes. Castiel stood outside the bunker as he cried.
Castiel groaned, releasing a torrent of sweet honey fragrance. In the back of Castiel’s mind, he faintly remembers the significance of having a scent that attracts a person one would be compatible with. It rings in his ear that this is a sign that the two could work well together, mating with one another would be beneficial. Castiel wouldn’t mind creating a potential connection made of love and affection between them. As it was, Castiel loves Dean, he knows this now.
"Not on the cheek," Charlie complained, but she was too late, Dean's lips meeting stubble. It might not be a proper kiss, but it still felt intimate; it wasn't like he had a habit of kissing his friends on the cheek, at least not guys, so this was… different.
Cas’s breath hitched, his hand covering his mouth – and the next moment Ash was heard calling out, “Happy New Year!” from somewhere nearby, announcing the stroke of midnight; he’d clearly wandered off somewhere, unaware of what was going on. Dean couldn’t help but laugh, and then Cas cracked up. And then everyone else started, too.
After their road trip is over, Dean finds himself assuming – with a strange sense of wistfulness – that their sexual adventures together are now over and done with, never to be spoken of again. After all, Sam usually joins them when they go out, and, well. It was just some vacation fun, he supposes, before everything goes back to the usual.
"You saying that you have a lot of love to give, Cas?" Saying the words out loud in the silence of the room made Dean's entire body flush with warmth all at once. It was like being on a roller coaster and hurtling down a vertical drop – exhilarating and scary at the same time.
“Yeah. Come on.” Benny reaches around Dean, and Cas feels his knuckles rub against his stomach as he jerks Dean off. And then it happens: Dean’s body tenses, hands gripping Cas’s arms tightly, his voice hoarse as he moans helplessly while he paints Cas’s stomach with cum.
Cas, not what’s between your legs. Besides, y'know, I’ve got my trusty right hand, and there’s always toys to switch things up.” He immediately looked horrified at what had come out of his mouth. “Shit, sorry, is that inappropriate to say to you? Do you not want to hear about–”
Castiel’s knees give out and he collapses in front of the door. His arms fall from where they once held the door shut. The knob jiggles and they both know there is nothing that keeps Dean from opening the door - no lock - but Dean keeps it closed for the moment.
“Okay,” is all Dean can say, struck speechless as his gaze turns soft. Castiel preens at the look on his alpha’s face, holding Dean’s hand tighter when he squeezes the palm.
Castiel wraps his arms around Dean’s broad back, clinging on tight to him. Castiel mewls as he presses his nose into the crook of Dean’s neck and calms himself through steady breaths.
The angel has the stuffed bee pressed between his chest and the mattress. Castiel’s nose is buried in Dean’s recently discarded shirt, being forced down by a hand at the back of his neck. Castiel gasps as a body climbs over his back, heavy and solid. Muscled arms trap Castiel underneath the alpha, a growing groin grinding into the heft of Castiel’s ass.
Dean sits for hours, sniffling on the ground with his head in his hands. The world hurt and he hasn’t felt more alone. He loved the world too much and he let love take away the only person he had ever felt lost without.
“I’m not crying!” Castiel screams the denial in Dean’s ear. He feels the urge to lie, uncertain of what to say. "I just - I..."
Dean is ruthless as he fucks Castiel; no thought in his mind aside from shoving his knot as deep as possible inside the omega. Castiel hisses. His chin is pressed down against the mattress in a harsh manner, knuckles turning white where his hands grip the sheets. This time is nothing like their first. Dean's not gentle, no longer kind. He doesn't treat Castiel like fine china - they both know he isn't - doesn't take things slow at all. Dean buries himself to the hilt with each slam of his hips, skin slapping skin. It leaves bruises on Castiel's ass, he can tell.
Castiel sighs. If one thing hasn’t changed about the world, it’s that Dean and Castiel’s friendship has stayed the same. Even after the numerous times they sated each other's needs in bed or argued and fought over mindless things. Though Castiel was an omega, he would always remain “Cas'' to Dean. Former angel of the lord, who was no more than a friend and occasional fuck buddy.
Castiel whimpers. He clutches to Dean’s shirt, swallowing the alpha’s musk to calm himself. Dean is so cruel, teasing him. Touching Castiel yet not giving him exactly what he wanted. Castiel surges forward, nipping the scent gland on Dean’s neck. He makes a satisfied purr at the yelp that escapes Dean, the alpha’s hip bucking upward against Castiel’s already leaking ass.
What was happening between them was just sex. A mutual benefit to feed their stubborn need to mate. There's no love or appreciation involved, only heartache.
Castiel shouldn’t crave and yet all the small details began to make sense. The way that his body acts and reacts, the way that he nestles and burrows. How Castiel finds himself attracted to alpha-aligned scents and seeks out new objects that bring him small joys. The same way that Castiel shies away from itchy wool and anxiety inducing crowds full of mangled lusty stenches.
“Cas! Cas, let me in!” Dean’s fist bangs against the door and Castiel shivers not in fear but for a reason he is unfamiliar with. His chest hurts, heart beating a mile a minute. His breathing is coming out ragged, tears threatening to spill from his eyelids.
Castiel isn't so sure about the toys though. They look abnormal compared to the alpha's cock. They all vary in size and color, none similar to the girth of Dean’s penis. Dean’s cock felt very pleasant inside Castiel, his knot plugging him full of cum. Whereas only one of the dildos in his new collection has a rather small knot attached to its base, it is also quite short in length. Castiel furrows his brows as he inspects the toy, uncertain about whether it can provide him with the pleasure that his omega craves.
Cas wonders if this is what it feels like to be high, when Dean sucks a mark onto his neck, because he can think of no other way to describe this feeling. “Dean,” he keens, uncaring of what he sounds like. He hears Benny chuckle, but a glance at the vampire reveals that it’s not meant in an unkind way.
Dean woke up before Cas, as usual; the angel didn't need as much sleep as Dean did, but he usually stayed awake long after Dean, and then he woke up later.
Sam and Eileen's house was an old, but renovated, farmhouse that she had inherited seven years ago now from a great-uncle she hadn't even known about. It had come at an opportune time for her and Sam, just as they had been ready to retire from hunting and settle down together. Dean had always liked the house. It felt like a proper home. More so than the bunker – not that Dean didn't feel at home there, but… the reality was that it was still a bunker: a concrete block that also served as their headquarters. This, however… this was a
Dean hesitantly accepted the phone, not sure what was going on. Hands shaking from the emotions of the last few minutes, he opened the gallery app… and was faced with the photo Cas had taken at Hells Canyon. In the foreground was Cas, yes… but Dean was also in the picture. And in Cas’s hand, that he held up close to Dean’s shoulder, was a note that said MARRY ME?
Dean smiled at the kids' enthusiasm, and turned to Cas again. "Come on, let's go. I know you like hot chocolate just as much as the kids do."
There are five more needles, each one higher up on the inside of Dean's thigh and – unless it's just Dean's imagination due to the increasing closeness to his junk – each one offering a sharper pain, and with it, a feeling of sinking further into the depths of his mind, of detaching from his senses and floating away from Cas.
Of course he wasn't that lucky. Being Sam and Eileen's kids and therefore smart as hell, they never let go of something until they figured it out. Charlie looked thoughtful for a moment, and then continued her line of reasoning: "But Leon has two uncles who live together, like you and Uncle Cas. And they're boyfriends."
Dean nodded. "Okay. So, uh… I'll leave it a surprise then?" It wasn't going to be a particularly great surprise if he was dressed when Cas came back, but he needed to think about it for a minute.
The gift he got from Cas was a Blue Öyster Cult vinyl he didn't already have and a new robe; Dean's Dead Guy Robe was old and starting to come apart at the seams. He'd been planning on fixing it, but knowing their lives, he probably would never have gotten around to it. And he liked this one. It resembled the old one a bit, but it was a grey plaid and a bit softer.
"Who would have thought it would be the kids who'd finally get it out of me?" Dean asked, finally growing more comfortable with the topic. Cas was so non-judgmental – wasn't even straight
Their home is big. They live there, all three of them, and Cas briefly considers the possibility that Sam might be a third romantic partner in their relationship, but that doesn’t feel right; he doesn’t feel the same way when he looks at Sam as when he looks at Dean. He’d rather not ask, but every interaction he observes between the two seems to indicate that he’s right.
Cas can’t help it; before he even realises what is happening, he’s released a burst of Grace – and then all at once he’s coming while Dean moans anew, and Benny groans, thrusting a couple more times before he collapses on top of them.
tell me you and Cas have a way to fix this.” It was Cas’s voice coming out of his mouth, but it sounded different when he was the one speaking with it.
And Benny’s right. The feel of Dean’s mouth on him, when he reaches his target, is… heavenly, is probably what a human would say. Cas knows better. This is way better than anything Heaven can offer. There’s nothing Cas has experienced in his millennia long life that can measure up to this, to Dean being so eager to please him, licking and sucking and humming his pleasure around Cas’s cock.
"I'll leave that for you to decide." Cas stood to the side so Dean could look in, and what he saw was… one bed. He knew it was technically two beds, but they were now pushed together and made up like one; the blankets piled on top of it were queen-sized, much like the bed now, and Dean would be willing to bet there was only a single fitted sheet covering the two mattresses as well. It was clearly done by the kids, judging by how untidy it looked, the blankets bunched up in places.
Dean wasn't sure if he was breathing or not, but he nodded, and at the first touch of Cas's hand on him, Dean's cock jumped again and the towel fell and bunched at the root of it, revealing him before Cas's eyes. Cas didn't touch his cock, however, instead loosening the towel and pulling the ends to each side, exposing all of Dean completely.
"Yeah, I'm not locking myself in that tiny space." Dean waves his hand in dismissal, sweat beading down his forehead. "I asked 'where the hell are you going'."
Dean is so much more experienced in these types of things and it shows as Dean gropes Castiel’s soft pec, squeezing it tenderly. He messaged the sensitive muscles, rough fingers pads rubbing tantalizing circles around hardening nubs. Castiel’s breath hitched, his back arching into the touch. Castiel was almost tempted to let go of the alpha and retrieve his bearings. To unwind his arms from the broad frame and hide his face but he didn’t. Cheeks flushed, Castiel heaved out every breath. His chest would rise and fall with Dean’s ministrations, pure putty in his hands.
Castiel’s shoulders sag, his eyes widen in stunned silence. He freezes in place, no longer attempting to escape Dean’s embrace as the alpha pulls him in closer. It is a piece of truth that has Castiel forlorn as he looks to the floor.
Castiel’s laid out like a personal all-you-can-eat buffet, his arms obediently stretched out above his head just as Dean had left them. His lithe form waiting for the touch of an alpha. All that was missing was a canister of whipped cream for dessert.
It’s a close call but they all survive the fight against Ramiel. Castiel lives and Dean silently thanks Crowley for breaking a curse that seemed to be so obvious now.
With a new mission, Dean's palms make their way down Castiel's sides. They rove over birthing hips, grope thick thighs then moon over globes of ass cheeks. Castiel's groans through clenched teeth, nails digging into Dean's skin. Dean's fingers continue to grapple at Castiel's plump ass, slipping on slick. Dean growls louder, digging his fingers between the crack of Castiel’s ass. The omega’s hole twitches at the graze of a finger, the pucker greedily sucking the digit inside its warm cavern. Castiel moans at the intrusion, his mouth gaping open.
“You know ever since we met – ever since I pulled you out of hell… Knowing you has changed me.” Castiel swallows a sob, reminiscent of the first time Dean had heard this similar spiel.
Castiel wanted, and at the time he was not sure what it was he longed for, but he sniffed out for it. His nose ruffled, seeking out the familiar whiff of apple pie that led him to lean on his other side. Castiel breathed in a moan as his hand brushed upon soft fabric soaked in the aroma of apple pie.
The first thing that Sam does is light lavender candles all throughout the room - a stubborn stench that ruffles Castiel's nose. The angel chooses not to tell the younger Winchester about his distaste, though, as he watches Sam heat up a kettle of loose leaf tea. Part of Castiel believes that there is a more intimate reason that Sam coats the space in these scents. They don’t appeal to Castiel in any way, many things about this nest don’t feel right to Castiel. He’d tried to make adjustments to it by positioning the pillows at the very top of the bed, leaning against the headboard like a throne. But then Sam had hissed at Castiel not to touch another throw whilst the taller omega flips all of the pillows cool-side up onto the left of the mattress, piled to the length of another human being. Castiel starts to understand when Sam lays stretched out on the bed, head laying on the top pillows, his arms curled around the shape of its concept. Castiel sees Sam curl up in the fetal position as his body aches and Sam sweats buckets onto the sheets.
Dean decides to cut Castiel some slack once inside the bunker. He lets himself be vulnerable for a moment, to admit that the promise of a “cosmic consequence” worries him. It’s something he thinks about at night. A fear that Castiel may be closer to losing his life than he thinks because the hunts are becoming more challenging. The possibilities more probable.
“But there’s always going to be another monster,” Castiel argues. He doesn’t see the correlation. “Won’t they need our help?”
Castiel can't live in resigned peace, not with the longing he feels. He is full of guilt, heart calling out in anguish to a presence he isn’t aware watches him.
Dean settles Castiel’s ass on his thighs, a mix of his cum and omega slick soaking his jeans. Dean positions the dildo between Castiel’s ruddy cheeks, slipping it between his cracks. Thrusting it upward and downward, coating the toy in natural lubricant. Castiel grinds against it, moving his hips in hopes that the toy catches and - Castiel gasps. The head of the dildo slides effortlessly inside of Castiel’s warm cavern, rubbing his inner walls. Castiel pushes down on it, trying to get more of the toy. But Dean pulls away, the dildo slipping out once again. Castiel growls, Dean laughs. He continues to tease Castiel, swirling the tip around his puckered hole. Inserting just the tip then removing it.
Family isn’t that strong of a theory, however. Not with Cain being so certain that Dean would kill his own brother. Himself included was sure that, eventually, Dean will slaughter Sam like Cain had slaughtered Abel. But first was the Styne family. Nameless faces that held no place in Dean’s heart. Cain had said that Dean would kill Crowley, just as he had killed the Knights of Hell and before he had killed Collette. Killed his wife second and first his brother. But if Dean were living Cain’s life in reverse… the angel blade shook in Dean’s hand.
Dean only chuckles, his fangs protruding out of his gums, dripping saliva from their tips. He knows what the omega wants and he won’t give it to him. Not this time and only that once. Dean can give him second best though. Dean bends Castiel to his will, licking his lips as he raises Castiel’s legs and exposes his sopping wet hole. It’s gorgeous, achingly open, waiting to be filled. Dean spits onto the well-lubed hole and it twitches in need.
When Dean meets Amara in a beautiful garden, things don’t go quite as planned. Amara feels the souls trapped in Dean, can tell that he didn’t come to be one with her. He came to finish her off and neither of them wanted that. What Amara truly wanted was her brothers’ companionship, to have him on her side. To have his brotherly love and affection. A little bit of therapy, an opportunity to know one another and rebuild their trust. Chuck takes away the souls that would have turned Dean into a bomb and sent him on his merry way with a gift.
In the morning, Dean was out of sight. The room was bare and lonely without him; Castiel felt cold and warm all at the same time. The angel turned to lay from his back onto his side and when he did, he noticed a damp towel fall from his forehead. His vision was hazy and it took him a few tries to blink away the fog. When Castiel opened his eyes again, he saw new contents laying on top of the bedside dresser. He recognized a fresh box of heating pads, a gallon of water, plastic cups, and a bottle of ibuprofen. Beside them, Castiel sees what seem to be packages of silicone ‘toys’ and something labeled ‘Trojan condoms’. His brows etch together in confusion.
Jack laughs a hollow noise, rubbing the back of his knuckle against his eye. “If I go to Heaven, then Sam and Dean, they won’t have to worry about any apocalypses anymore. That will be on Heaven’s shoulders alone.”
"Hey!" Dean's gruff voice echoes from the hall, his feet stomping upon the ground. "Where are you going?"
“I do not.” Castiel sits straighter, his eyes boring into Dean’s smug gaze. It’s the first time the omega has looked at Dean since locking himself in the closet. Embarrassment dusts at Castiel’s cheeks and he scoffs, looking away.
Dean regretted it. He regretted every choice; regretted taunting Billie. They shouldn’t have come back; they shouldn’t have disturbed Deaths’ Library. Dean shouldn’t have brought Castiel. He shouldn’t have.
The sorrow that Castiel felt did not dissipate as they inched nearer to Nora’s home. It engulfed him and swallowed him whole. It was a lake that Castiel could not swim in; still he had attempted to wade. Castiel only needed to last a little longer until he could be with Nora, the kind woman who seemed to have taken interest in Castiel of all people. Their date should provide a more than suitable distraction at least that is what Dean convinced him of.
“Oh, it would take more than Dean having sexual relations to destroy such a wonderful event.” Castiel saunters off anyway, a pit in his stomach. He drops his half empty beer on a nearby table, walking under the stars and into Jody’s house. He forgets about dancing for a while, perhaps once he finds Dean, he can tempt the alpha into dancing with him. That wouldn’t be a first either, not after the many hours Dean had spent teaching Castiel how to slow dance for Sam’s wedding night, Led Zeppelin playing on an old beat up record player.
Castiel lays out on an old beat-up couch in an old beat-up barn not far from the house of the demon they had come to hunt. It should have been simple; they’ve used the magic demon-killing knife time and time again. Demons weren’t a new threat to the brothers but things had gone wrong. Crowley’s goons and the King of Hell himself had appeared to investigate the intrusion of privacy. They had killed a fellow hunter prior to warning and the one revealed to be a Prince of Hell had pierced through Castiel’s skin with Micheal’s Lance.
Castiel’s strength has been dwindling down again, even more so since they got on Chuck's nerves. It’s a cruel fate dealt by the hand of a malicious, self-absorbed God. To think they once trusted Chuck only to have been lied to for years - for a millennia.
So there the angel lay in agonizing pain, lifting his tattered shirt to show the deep black veins sprouting from Castiel’s wound. A wound the angel could not heal.
Castiel considered hunting. Not vampires and werewolves but instead deer and wildcats. Castiel can't build up the strength to do it though. The animals have done no harm. They eat; they sleep; they survive. Castiel understands where meat comes from, of course he does. Though Castiel is an angel. He has little to no need to feed on animals so to hunt them for game would be cruel.
But then Jack was returned to them and under Billy’s plan, under Chuck’s watchful eyes, the world had spun upside down. Earths of varying dimensions and universes were being destroyed, trust tested. Everyone on the little blue planets were lost at one point or another but Jack… Jack succeeded where the Winchester’s couldn’t and Castiel was so proud. So happy that their little family was being repaired and troubles mended.
All that Castiel wanted was for the space between them to disappear. He wanted to feel all of Dean Winchester, be one with the alpha. Castiel purred, his fingers tangling in the short strands of Dean’s hair. Dean’s strong arms hiked Castiel’s hips forward, pushing him until the omega’s head rested cozy on a pile of fluffy pillows. All the while, he didn’t allow their bodies to separate once. Dean nipped Castiel’s earlobe, causing the omega to wheeze.
Though as the months passed by, Castiel did begin to feel the body he resided in change to benefit the new being that lived within. The shifts were minor subtleties at first, such as labored breaths and an enhanced smell. Those attributes did not stand out to him. His grace was failing him slowly; fighting exerted more of his energy and left his lungs heavy. The stench of humans was not something Castiel could control. He had no order over how well they cleaned themselves and he dared not force them to wear a scent patch. The last time Castiel had attempted to cover Dean’s scent with one, he had ended up landing on his ass from the sheer strength Dean had used to shove him away.
Sam took in the scene in front of him – Dean and Cas with identical blushes, desperately trying to keep the kids from climbing on top of them – and his mouth fell open.
“It’ll help,” Dean assured him. “I know it probably seems… degrading, or whatever, to an alpha, but just try it. It’ll make this more bearable.” He had to bite the inside of his cheek to try to tamp down the desire that surged in him at the thought of Cas using it.
“Not you. The sex. Her and you, together,” Cas says, amused, and Dean wants to kick himself for Cas learning how to use people’s words against them from him.
"Unless I'm completely delusional," he continued as they took their mugs and started heading out of the kitchen. "But… I'd like for something to be going on between us," he admitted, face going pink as he finally said that particular embarrassing fact out loud to someone for the first time. Someone who couldn't hear it, but still. It counted. She understood him. "And I'm starting to feel pretty sure I'm
“What?” Dean looked at him with what appeared to be genuine surprise, as if he couldn’t fathom why Cas would think that. “What are you talking about? Of course you do.”
Eventually his body started giving into the exhaustion from the last few months of hunting, now that he could allow himself a good night's sleep without worrying about anything, and he yawned.
express them to the person they're directed at in one day. Especially if Cas doesn't return them. At least then Dean is safely hidden away from the disaster while it happens.
Cas’s next touch is reverent, a gentle grip on Dean’s hip – gloves gone now – and then Dean feels the tell-tale breath against his backside before Cas’s hands move to spread him open. Dean expects the wet touch that follows, but it still doesn’t fail to draw a sharp breath out of him.
"Very good," Alicia purrs close to Dean's ear. "Now his pants." Dean hesitates, but when his eyes and Cas's meet, Cas nods, giving him permission.
He has to hand it to his little brother; Sam doesn’t even once wrinkle his nose in disgust or look outraged at any of the things Dean says. Granted, he doesn’t go into detail about the explicit stuff, but Sam is a smart boy; he can piece things together. What Dean
“You’ve been in a coma for two days,” the nurse says, “but we don’t know why. You have no physical injuries. Do you remember what happened before you lost consciousness?”
attracted to guys, he still couldn't help but wonder what his answer would have been. Whether it might be what Dean had never dared to hope for before now.
“This is nice,” Cas said softly, accepting a cup of warm eggnog from Mary with a nod of thanks. “Can we celebrate New Year’s with your family next year as well?”
It wasn't hard to follow Cas's gentle order, and within only a minute, Dean was doing precisely what Cas had told him to, no thoughts of cases and monsters interrupting the peaceful calm of the room.
"You're doing so well, Dean. Can you take more?" Cas asks, and Dean nods. He doesn't even care where; Cas could probably suggest piercing his nipples or his dick right now, and he wouldn't even hesitate.
a round three (apparently, getting together with the person you'd been pining for for years did wonders for your stamina and refractory period), and by the time Sam and Eileen entered the house around midnight, they'd showered again and gotten back into bed, arms wrapped around each other as they slept soundly.
"Me," Dean answered quickly, before he had the time to think about what he was saying. "I mean, I'm not. Maybe. I… Why are you awake already? You never wake up this early."
The joyous shouts of "Uncle Dean! Uncle Cas!" could be heard from inside before Dean had even pressed the doorbell, and he smiled to himself. He couldn't wait to see the kids again. However long it took between each time he saw them, it always seemed like too long. A quick glance at Cas revealed that he, too, was just as excited to see them again. There had never been any question as to whether or not Cas was included in Sam's family; he was as much their uncle as Dean was.
"Dean, we're doing this whether you want to or not." Sam grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him up, and if Dean maybe helped a little, well, at least Sam didn't mention it.
Dean blinked a couple of times. This was it. This was the moment they’d reached the inevitable end. “I don’t know if I can do this anymore.”
"Hey, Cas," he says, his voice ever so slightly strained. "If you want to touch yourself, y'know, that's cool."
Even the beer – which, let’s face it, tasted pretty much like lukewarm piss in the first place – is getting too bitter to swallow. And always, in the back of his mind, is the knowledge that Cas is here. In Heaven – somewhere. Bobby never told him how to find him and Cas hasn’t shown up in the shotgun seat like Dean halfway expected him to, and… goddamn, but he misses him. Thinking about him and the way they parted makes Dean heart clench.
"Oh." Dean scratched his neck, his face warming. But Cas had said that it was up to Dean to decide if there was anything wrong with this. So… maybe that meant Cas was fine with it. "Well, I, um. We can try to find the other blankets if you want, but…"
The toys were more appreciated than the clothes, of course, which was just how it should be, in Dean's opinion. Kids should be so used to always having enough clothes that fit and weren't old and worn out that they didn't
The question is burning in his mind and on his tongue, however, and he has to let it out to get reprieve. “How so?”
“Well, what are you waiting for, ya idjit?” Bobby said to John, nodding his head in the direction of the box, and John shook his head and went to pick it up. Dean had forgotten how to breathe, and considering how perfectly still Cas was beside him, he probably had, too.
Someone bumped into his shoulder; clearly he was as invisible as he felt, and he muttered an apology – although it hadn’t been his fault – and pulled away, only to get a hand clapped onto the same shoulder instead.
does; he’ll float so far away that when it's time to come back, Cas has to place gentle hands on his face and ask him to until the words finally register with Dean and his senses begin to come back to him again.
Dean flushed with warmth, both at the kiss and Cas's words. Cas had never had trouble sleeping after Dean had left the room before. The fact that he did so now had Dean's heart beating faster, but he was too aware of Eileen's gaze on them and her grin to manage a reply.
Dean can’t help but savour the words, even while he doesn’t know if he agrees with them, but he never knows how to respond to Cas’s praise, so instead he grinds down into Cas’s lap. “Come inside me,” he begs. “Please.”
It’s not an outright yes, and it wasn’t an outright proposal, but Cas has no doubt, as Dean kisses him once more and pulls him to his bedroom, that sometime in the future he’ll get to call Dean his husband. Again.
