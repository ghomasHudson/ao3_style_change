“You can start researching without me while I take a shower, right?” Dean asks, as they pull into the garage.
He would have imagined himself cut-- well, not that he ever imagined himself with anything he didn’t have, but when he’d tried a kind of realistic packer, once, it had been molded to look cut. Dean is not cut.
He’s not totally scar-free, though. Going over all the other changes and the one merciful not-change makes that part clear. It’s a
“When you brought me back… how come-- How come you…?” He seems to struggle, he gestures in a way that encompasses all of him and communicates little. “Just, fuck… just, leaving aside why me at all, because that’s--”
“What part of ‘nothing to talk about’ sounded to you like I wanted to talk?” Dean glares at him and shoves about half an additional donut into his mouth.
“They’re a fascinating lifeform.” Cas hangs up his coat, slips out of his shoes, and stands by the fire in his socks and his shirtsleeves. Still soaked, but… well, he’ll dry over time.
boy. Maybe because Sam was already the favorite, and Dean hadn’t been put first since he was four years old, and someone had to. And… maybe because he could see so much of himself in Dean, the older he got. The good and the bad, but… well, maybe once upon a time, someone should’ve put Bobby first, just once, and some of the bad would be good now. So maybe he can try and fix some of the things there’s no helping in him, for Dean.
“Peachy.” Dean snaps. “She’s gonna be back. You know… she needed some time but she’s gonna be back, so… I thought maybe we should try and…”
“Our Cas who art somewhere, hallowed be thy dumb face, get over here and save my ass, wise man said just find your place, in the eye of the storm. Seek the roses along the way, just beware of the thorns, so here I am, will you send me an angel? Here--” Dean’s phone buzzes, and he pulls it out of his pocket. “Yo, Cas. Yeah, Sam’ll get the door… Uh-huh, he’s just worried about a thing, it’s no big deal. Hey, as long as you’re here, though, you know, I can make dinner for three as easy as for two...”
“Nothing. Is that a new shirt?” He hopes that covers anything-- it’s not as faded as most of the shirts he’s used to his own Dean owning, it’s gotta be somewhat recent.
In the morning, Cas is gone, but Dean’s awake, sitting up in bed with gas station coffee and a monstrosity of a breakfast created out of a box of donuts and a microwave breakfast sandwich that looks unappealing even by their life-on-the-road standards.
“Try and what? He’s not exactly built for that apple pie life, Dean. At least when he hunts with us, we can help him learn not to rely on all the powers he’s used to having. Save the angel mojo up for when he needs it. You really think he’d do better off on his own? You think he’ll never run into trouble? No one’s ever going to come for him because he’s low on juice and no one’s watching his back? He’s better off with us.”
“Yes, it seems my accuracy has improved slightly. I am more comfortable with this, it feels… sturdier. Though I am still mindful, they have so many delicate moving parts… not like a blade.”
“Dunno, what am I, the guy’s babysitter? He’s an angel.” Dean says, like it’s insane Sam should even wonder. Maybe here it is. He and Cas don’t seem to be on the friendliest terms… “When I woke up he told me he would go ‘obtain breakfast’, because I ‘deserve to have my mortal needs considered’. Dude was so salty you could use him to ward off-- well, actually, you probably could, he’s an angel… Anyway, he was pissy about something, but not about getting breakfast, that was just… weird. Good weird.”
“No. I mean-- maybe some company? I was just gonna… hang out. Maybe get something done in the kitchen, or watch a movie, no real plans. But you’re welcome to stick around.”
“Thinking about what?” Cas tears his eyes away from Dean’s backside, but it’s not easy, when it’s right there at eye level, and it’s so…
“Well, I don’t know anyone else who’s been outside Earth’s atmosphere, so… who can say? They still pretty nice, though? From here?”
He gets dropped in in time to see Dean take out the witch they’d been hunting, though not in time to help.
“I’ll let him know.” Sam rolls his eyes. Okay, so this might be a somewhat less stony and repressed version of his brother, but he’s still trying and failing to pretend he’s not embarrassed about getting hit in the face with cursed slime fighting a pretty novice witch. That feels about right somehow.
“I’ll do it.” He levels Sam with a look. “Not because of your really unsubtle attempts to bait me into it, but because I think it’s kind of interesting that
Finally, Dean nods, and Cas looks like something just cut his strings, all the tension leaves him and he sags, head bowed. By the team Sam reaches them, he’s ready for a fight, tensed again, but it’s a better kind of tense.
“Was I away from you that long?” There’s just the hint of a smile, a certain sparkle to his eyes, a tilt of his head that’s just…
“So… if demon blood is corrupting me, what? Does your blood… purify Dean, for this coming destiny crap?”
Sam groans and rubs at his eyes again. “Okay, here’s the thing… my brother is like… a decade away from being ready to have his bi freakout. This is
He’s still laughing when he opens his eyes and finds himself face to face with Chuck instead of Dean and Cas.
And a Cas he's pretty sure he can trust to stick by them, with or without his encouragement-- no matter how difficult this Dean can be.
He changes somehow, or moves somehow-- shifts in a way Sam can’t process, but is dimly aware of. Like a satisfied nod that his body doesn’t follow through on, like briefly sensing the puppetmaster and not the puppet.
“Well… I’m gonna have to get those calluses back one way or another, but, um…” He rubs at the back of his neck, and looks at Castiel again, really looks at him. “None of the things that cause me pain, huh?”
And there’s one more thing Sam knows, whether or not Chuck has grokked onto it yet-- if they don’t get Cas back one way or another, he’s going to lose Dean, too. He can lose him slow and ugly, or he can play out Chuck’s game and try and make things painless, but this is not his first rodeo with Dean grieving Cas so hard he loses himself, and he knows where it’s going. He knows either Team Free Will crosses the finish line together, or they don’t cross it at all, because every time they’ve ever tried to make it with someone missing, it all just takes a nosedive.
“All right… so tell me what you’ve got, that’s of any interest to me. Because I mean, I’m your god. This isn’t like laying down a c-note when you’re hustling pool, Sam, this is the biggest league there is. And I am notoriously difficult to amuse. And notoriously difficult to beat. So I’d really love to hear what you think you can do better than your god.”
He glances down at his cleavage again, and then back up to soccer mom Cas. “So… you don’t see what she sees, when you look at me, huh?”
“Will you shut up and come hang out in the kitchen? Or you can come see the tree, but it’s pretty disappointing.”
“Oh. Hey.” He blinks. “Um, glad you’re here. Dean’s got something up his ass about asking you for help, but we could use it.”
It puts a damper over the rest of their afternoon, and Cas isn’t with them, but Sam feels pretty confident-- this Cas is a lot like the one he remembers. This Cas is going to stick with them, it’s just whether or not Dean will let him.
It’s not like he’s not glad. He couldn’t afford to have them removed, not just the financial cost but planning out a recovery? He sleeps in his car as often as he sleeps in a bed, at a generous estimate.
“I dunno, he pulled you out so you could save the world, anything else… you know, what’s it matter?”
“Dean is not the problem. I can’t ask any more of him. Foolish of me to be so hurt by the truth, it’s not surprising to me.”
“Car! Now! End of discussion!” Dean says, looking at him like he’d stated an intention to let Lucifer possess him instead of suggesting he’s the better pool player. Which he is, at least in his own universe, but Dean’s a little touchy about that there, too. Still, the need to eat tends to win out over his pride.
It’s the body he’s had in dreams before. If he gave himself the luxury of imagining what he’d have wanted his body to look like, this. Him, just… streamlined.
“Am I certain of the outcome? It doesn’t look good. Am I certain of my own course of action? It… doesn’t look good, but I know what I’m going to do.”
Cas doesn’t respond. Cas is unnaturally still-- even for Cas-- save the rapid, shallow rise and fall of his chest.
“Yes. I do. I’ve looked at all our options, Dean, I’ve thought about this. It would be nice to hope that we would not have to make sacrifices, but at this stage in the game…”
“Don’t hurt yourself. Sam and I can handle things from here.” Cas orders, and this time Dean doesn’t argue, just watches as Cas strides through the library, then deposits the book he wants in front of Sam, opening it to the correct page. “I will procure the necessary ingredients, it should be simple, but with the rapid acceleration, it’s important we break the curse quickly. Paralyzing weakness shouldn’t set in before the second day. If it spreads to his organs… I can heal damage, of course, but the curse will need to be broken or it will keep happening.”
He just guesses he’s used to their Cas, who’s been known to deal out a smiting, but who’s so often just fighting alongside them. The deafening wingbeats and the crackling of lightning is bigger, showier, than their Cas normally is. The way the witch is slammed to the ground before he even touches her, the way he’s on her so fast after that that Sam can’t track how he got from point A to point B, the horrible half-melt, half-combust she does at his touch and the way he slowly rises from his crouch over her, eyes glowing… He feels so much less human than the Cas Sam’s gotten to know.
“The point is!” Dean places a finger to his lips, and Cas freezes. “You could ask me to do something that isn’t about Heaven, or Hell, or monsters, or
He dumps Cas on the bed furthest from the door, waving a bag of food under his nose and laughing when that pulls him out of half-sleep. When Sam gets back in with their stuff, Cas is wolfing down his meal and Dean is on hold with the front desk, taking agitated bites of burger and pacing the small space between the beds.
“If I did not believe you meant to keep to our agreement, I would of course kill you where you stand, and Dean would be very upset.”
anything. I fear you are too far from salvation and you will fall to the corrupting influence of your demon friend. Although, your soul is not so black as I expected. And of course Dean sees much goodness in you even now.”
“That’s not what was supposed to happen.” Chuck grumbles, waving an agitated hand towards the screens and starting up the next highlight reel.
“No. But… I have seen them in passing. Outside of the atmosphere. The… the distances are the same, the orientation, when you’re still within this system, but they still look… different. At least, they do to me. But perhaps my experience is not universal.”
“Sam, you know that if you attempted to injure him further now, I would be forced to stop you.” Cas sighs, weary. “And then he would have even more reason to be disappointed with me, so let’s just skip that… that whole mess.”
Sam does insist upon turning it into a group hug situation, and Cas allows it-- much as he wants a private reunion, he and Sam have been friends a long time, and Sam also missed him. He takes one arm from around Dean, to return Sam’s hug a little, before drawing back-- and scooping Dean up into his arms.
Cas turns back to gaze down at him, and Sam figures he didn’t need to ask. There’s a look of tenderness and sorrow that feels too private to be party to, no matter how many times he’s seen something play out between them, or at least, start to.
So he worries about what he knows needs taking care of. Water. Food. Figuring out where in the not-Hell he is. A little money that he hasn’t got the luxury of feeling bad about.
“Come on, get in the cabin.” He sighs, slinging an arm around Cas-- mentally preparing to pick him up and carry him if he resists, though he’s not sure how far he’ll get if he tries.
“Okay, okay.” He laughs. “Didn’t mean to interrogate you there, man. You sticking around? We could do a movie night.”
“This can be done.” His attention turns to the bathroom door-- no, not quite the door. The wall near the door, where the shower would be. “I made the mistake of asking a personal question, the last time we spoke. He informed me it was a personal question, I did not know.”
“Understood.” Cas repeats, nodding. “Deanna would like you to know you are not as funny as you think you are, but I imagine you were not attempting to be funny.”
“It’s okay to fall short sometimes. The important thing is… Well, I don’t know what the important thing is. I mean it kind of depends. Being human is weird like that.”
“No one’s better off with us.” Dean’s head rolls to the side, his gaze unfixed on the wall. “Can’t do this again. He pushed himself too far today.”
He had thought they would be able to speak, of course. After all… Dean was meant to be an Archangel’s potential vessel, so shouldn’t that mean he would be capable of hearing an angel’s true voice? And…
“Believe me, I know. You think I don’t cause my fair share of damage? You think I don’t make ugly mistakes sometimes? You think I fix everything I ever broke?”
Sam steps in, wrapping his arms around Cas. True, he’s had days with various other versions of Cas, all of them familiar in some ways even if none of them have been his best friend exactly, but this… this is a Cas so like the Cas he remembers from back when, ready to sacrifice everything for a shot at saving the world with them, and this is the goodbye he didn’t get to have before Cas went with Dean and they lost him to the Empty.
Cas didn’t just bring back enough for both of them, he brought back enough food to feed at least four people-- with donuts left over, even if you scraped the insides of the sandwiches between two donuts a pop. Sam’s not sure what the fresh-faced twenty-two year old version of himself he’s supposed to be would have said, he knows he used to eat garbage often enough when he didn’t have a more appealing option, but with a brain that’s pushing forty, he can’t look at that thing without feeling the ghost of heartburn yet to come looming over his shoulder.
Cas. Well, that makes sense-- he needs the chance to talk to him, otherwise this round can’t really count. He stands and moves towards the far corner, away from Dean.
“You could call Cas.” Sam suggests. “This might be the time to ask for a little miracle. Unless you know something I don’t about dragging lakes. And even then, I don’t think we want to sit around with hair dryers trying to get the bones dried out enough to burn.”
about all this? I mean, Cas… you’re giving him, like, a part of yourself. Doesn’t that mean something? Like, when this is all over, don’t you think that you’re going to want to be a part of his life?”
“Well… you tried. That counts. And… I’ve had time to move forward. I’m never going to forget about her, but… An angel trying to save her, that’s… that’s still something. I mean… I’ve dealt with a lot of loss. It’s… not easy, but you learn to live with it.”
“Obviously, when I required a vessel to speak to Dean after his resurrection, I wanted to find one closer to him. And… well, I wore out my welcome with my previous emergency host, when I failed to protect her friend, as I had promised.”
-- and trails his fingertips over the places where he’d knit bone back together, repaired tears to skin and muscle. As if he can still see how mangled it used to be.
“I--” Cas starts, and Sam motions at him, cutting him off before he can say he doesn’t need to eat. “Appreciate this, thank you.”
“Okay cool.” He lets out a whistle and rolls onto his side, punches his pillow into shape. “So what’s it do for him? Drinking from you, I mean. Does he get powers, is it like…?”
Cas’ hand wraps around his, bringing it down from his mouth, though for another moment, he doesn’t say anything. Just looks deep into Dean’s eyes like he’s looking through him and every single desire Dean’s ever had is laid out before him. Does he know how close he’s come before, to starting something? Has he scared off from it too easy, made Cas think he wasn’t ready, wasn’t serious? Does he know how bad he
“There… it’s all right. Sam will understand, it’s fine.” His voice goes gentle again, his hand slides from Dean’s brow to his cheek, then to his shoulder. “You’ve done nothing to feel ashamed of, so rest. Shh, rest…”
Time Sam can use to try and make what is probably the least appealing mushroom soup ever, because all he’s got is mushrooms, salt, and water, but hey.
His posture is all wrong, stiff and almost mechanical in the way he stretches, like taking his body for a test drive instead of living in it the way he always has. He closes his eyes and takes one more deep breath, lips curling into a smile that’s both familiar and horribly, horribly
This time, Chuck doesn’t give him a highlight reel, so much as one big fight. Out of all the times he’s seen Cas and Dean’s friendship break up-- at least, all the times he can remember-- this is by far the ugliest. He kind of wants to reach through the screen and smack Dean upside the head, but the Sam in that world just takes Jack-- who’s a baby here-- and edges out of the room to leave them to it.
Dean looks miserable enough that Sam bites back the ‘what did I tell you’ on the tip of his tongue, and wrangles his facial expression into something a little less accusatory.
“I’m… yeah, I mean, I know you guys are…” Sam hesitates, sounds out the word ‘dating’, lets it roll silently over his tongue once before he finds his voice again. “Together.”
Dean shoves the money back in his jacket pocket, before shedding it, heading for the bathroom and slamming the door behind him. Sam hears the shower start up, and he tries calling for Cas himself, but he’s surprised when Cas actually shows.
“Yeah, but-- Whatever, just… Look, should we maybe talk about what was going on when I came in last night?”
“Shit!” The car jerks, he nearly overcorrects. Judging by the weather, he should be watching out for ice on the roads. Trust Chuck to pick this moment to slam him into.
“Hey, don’t go making out like this is some favor to you, I just don’t want a baby getting hold of a gun or nothing.” Dean looks away, shoves a too-large bite into his mouth as an excuse to not have to respond to anything else Cas might have to say.
“All you need to know, is you’re on the trail of a vamp nest. And you’re taking a little downtime before you hit it.”
“Hinted around? This is Cas we’re talking about, I don’t think hints work.” Sam laughs, and then he sees the look on Dean’s face and he stops laughing fast. “What did you say?”
“You know how many of them I slaughtered? And even when I wasn’t poised against them, how many suffered because of me? How many Fell around me? How many were extinguished under my banner? Do you know what it means, to call me ‘family’? I don’t belong here.”
“Yes, I am aware that there is no one in your brother’s life who has never abandoned him or let him down at some point.”
“Yeah, he’s definitely not never wrong…  ugh, you know what I mean. I mean that’s my brother all right.”
Okay, probably better than demon blood, with time and distance from the man he was-- or is, in this world-- he’s man enough to admit that, but still… creepy. It makes this Cas feel so unlike their Cas-- or maybe that’s just what he was like, way back when, and Sam’s forgotten some of his weird hard edges. But their Cas brought Dean back without a hitch-- at least, without one significant enough to require feeding him
“No. The Empty took ‘em both. He… he summoned it, because he knew it would… He knew that if it came for him, it would take her, and I… I’d be left behind. He left me.”
“It, uh… He did it for Jack, and he, um… I mean it-- it doesn’t matter, it’s not-- He did it for Jack, and it came due. That’s all.”
“No. It can’t hurt.” He agrees, taking a bite. “The amino acid chains which make up the collagen in the meat have broken down considerably.”
“No, Cas, you shouldn’t-- Yeah. Fine. Do whatever you want.” Dean groans, turning and letting his head thunk softly against the doorframe. “If you want to talk about how I spent my night, don’t.”
It’s a dangerous offer, given Cas isn’t bound by human rules, where stamina and refractory periods are concerned, and Dean’s not a young buck in his twenties anymore, when he’s worn out he needs a little recharge time and maybe something for energy. But…
back, and maybe that’s why he’d been so insistent… They hadn’t burned Dean. And maybe they should have, but it’s damn hard to look at it that way when the living, breathing article’s sitting next to him.
Not the part where Dean is bi, which honestly makes more sense than Dean being straight, but Dean being into getting carried, that’s… that part’s weird.
“Because.” Cas tilts Dean’s head to the side. “We are friends and you were grateful that I agreed to come with you. And earlier… was not goodbye.”
“Sam left some of your things in the attic, but… I don’t know what’s there. Least maybe one outfit that didn’t crawl its way out of the grave.” He offers, in the kind of gruff tone he doesn’t expect is fooling anyone. “Son, if you’ve got meds you need or anything, I don’t know if they’ll be in there.”
The tee shirt that says BEST BI in big block letters on a pink, blue, and purple tag shape? That is not something the Dean in his universe owns.
He’s prepared for Dean to do a little fake-out. That’s how it happened before, and… okay, and Cas got blown across the country and temporarily lost his powers, but if he sticks with them through this and Dean doesn’t become Michael’s meatsuit, it’s still in the bag.
Sam’s not sure how to explain this little lapse to Dean, is ready for a ‘what the hell’ or a ‘how could you let him do that’, but instead, he just sees Dean deflate.
Castiel has never had to describe anything as ‘cute’ before, in his entire existence, though he’s sure that he’s seen enough things that qualify, in his time watching Earth. But Dean, so human and so fragile… who had already cast aside his shotgun when it proved useless!
“Oh. Yeah, definitely. Um, we’ve got milk, yeah.” He takes Jack again, so that Cas can grab the things he needs-- a bottle, a little spoon with a rubber-coated bowl, a jar of baby food. Sam doesn’t feel super comfortable with a baby, he kind of misses grown up toddler Jack-- had its own challenges, but Jack could walk around on his own, speak when he needed things, use a toilet.
“Right, but what if he still needs you?” Sam jumps on that. “You’ll come if he calls you, any time he needs you?”
Cas is steady enough and his posture’s good, but his first couple of shots still go wide, and he’s scowly over it, and the point of this whole thing isn’t to make Cas feel frustrated, it’s to let him feel in control of something.
“What, now I’m not allowed to be horny? Suck it up.” She makes a face at him, and the face is one hundred percent Dean.
-- even after the dirty work of digging himself free, his hands are softer than he can really remember them ever being. And not only that, scars and nicks are gone with the calluses. Not faded, but missing, as if…
“One more thing.” Dean says, before he can go, and some of the defensiveness drops from him. He sidles in closer. He ducks his head to bring himself in line with Castiel’s current physical height.
happened, and what might happen the next time Dean gets into a jam without him because he’d chosen rolling with a bad plan over waiting on a good one.
He should have realized, honestly. Why else would the highlight reel have started there, with that change? She had the same eyes, similar nose, could have been from the same bloodline, through a cousin somewhere. She could have been from anywhere, she was just there for school, same as him.
“Wow.” He mutters under his breath-- if the words had allowed for any ambiguity, and they hadn’t, the look Cas shoots him makes it clear enough he’s including Sam in that. “What I’m saying is, it would mean a lot to him if you didn’t just run out.”
They meet Cas out by the lake, after breakfast, where he’s got their skeleton dried out and waiting. Aside from the lake aspect, it’s an easy salt and burn. Cas spends the whole time standing too close, staring too much, the way he used to, but there’s a tension around it in this universe that Sam doesn’t recall from their own. A low conversation that they have, outside of Sam’s hearing, that ends with Dean getting angry, and Cas looking after him like a kicked puppy.
Sam… Sam’s gonna ask Dean about how he feels. That’s no slight on him, that’s… good, probably. It’s a sign that the two of them did something right, because Sam turned out a whole lot more like a normal person than Dean got a chance to, and that’s because Dean was the one raising him. There was only so much Bobby could ever do, the times he had them, but when he didn’t have them, Sam still had Dean, and Dean was a cushion between Sam and the hunting world. He was a cushion between Sam and
It was Castiel who seared his brand onto the Righteous Man, though he had not meant to. Inside and out.
When he does notice, it’s his hands he notices first. The lingering ghost of broken bones past are nowhere to be found. His palms are
“Yeah, well… there’s plenty. And it looks like it’s just us for the night, so… you might as well eat. Can’t hurt, right?”
“Fine.” Dean gets to his feet. “I gotta-- I’m gonna go-- laundry. Get the bloodstains out. Anyone wants to throw something in, grab it now. Cas?”
They’re going over the likely last resting place of one Frederick Graham, asshole ghost, when the bathroom door opens and Dean steps out in a towel. Cas actually looks up to the door before it opens.
“Making some quick cash.” He flashes a couple of twenties. Not a great haul for a night of hustling pool, but given the hour, Sam assumes Dean had gotten his four hours and then gone back out to some all-night place, too restless to stay in bed. Taken what he could find at a time when there were no high rollers to clean out.
“Maybe.” Sam pushes the thought of his own world aside, and gets up to do the dishes. There’s the sound of fussing and crying from the other room, but only briefly, as Sam washes and Dean dries.
“Dean doesn’t only worry about me. Look, I know he said… he said some things, that he shouldn’t have. You said you’re not his favorite person right now, I can’t imagine he’s yours, either, but he wasn’t only worried about what Lucifer could do to me. He was worried about you.”
“I am finding fatherhood… complicated. There are many joys, but… it is dangerous, trying to keep Jack hidden from his father. And I confess, I-- I don’t understand why Dean and I nearly came to blows over the issue. Even after months, I… I thought that we were in general agreement on right and wrong, and…”
“There are things you are not privy to, Sam, but I am aware. I know myself to be a disappointment. I appreciate that you want me to feel… better, but there is not much point. A request was made of me once, and I have failed to fulfill it.”
As much as he hates to admit it, Dean was perfect for it. He's attractive and charming, and even Castiel was dazzled from their first meeting, soul mate or not. He could easily get someone to trust him, and he's seen how easily Dean can lie to get out of situations. Through all of it, he believed Dean was a good man, but now, he wasn't so sure. How good could someone be if he killed somebody? Dean would point out that Castiel had too, but that was only when he was pursuing a suspect and he had to. That was different. And damn, did Dean have a hold on his mind.
It was easy for Castiel to pretend that this was just a small vacation. He called into work and took time off, which hadn't been an easy thing to do, but for Dean he was willing to. Everything was so peaceful, and now that they were relatively stable in one place, it was easier to believe things would go back to normal.
She died in a fire when he was four-years-old, and Dean will always feel partially responsible for a reason that Castiel doesn't know. With the information he now knew about John Winchester, he suspects that the fire that killed Mary and displaced the Winchesters wasn't an accident and was most likely started by John to covered up the murder of his wife.
Slowly, Dean got down on his knees in front of Castiel, and given no reason to pause, he moved forward and put his hands on Castiel’s hips and slowly, hesitantly rubbed them. He leaned forward and kissed Castiel’s stomach, just under his belly button and made him shiver, but his plan worked and he got his full attention once more.
Then there's also the blood. Everyone gets clear blood as they start out, and naturally it gets darker as they grow and mature. But other things can change it too. There are also things that can happen that can darken it further. Dean soon learned that the darkest Castiel has ever seen was a dark cherry, almost black. The man who it came out of was the worst serial killer Castiel ever faced. He can still remember seeing it after the man made sure he would never go to prison. There were laws set up to make sure no one was unfairly prosecuted, but no one really followed it. A self righteous jury gave quick, harsh convictions regardless of the laws in place. Even in his own career, Castiel had to continue with an investigation based on a trick to draw a drop of blood or two. He was just thankful that he had someone he could trust to come home too at the end of an especially rough day.
Every day, he fell more and more for the merman. It was the little things; Dean’s smile, his eyes, his laugh, the burning passion Dean carried with him at all times. It was how Dean could be so brash yet so vulnerable, shielded yet open. Dean would give and give and give to show he cared, and he did, Cas had no doubt about that. The merman loved more fiercely than he hated.
The last pirate was grabbed around the throat by a creature who was the storm-whipped sea incarnate. Sharp teeth and fury made short work of the poor fool.
"I love you, Dean. I've loved you for a long time. But I knew you would never reciprocate, and I could never provide what you wished for in life, or needed. The only reason I would ask you to stay was because I…" Cas looked down, trying to steady his wobbling lip with a shuddering breath. "Because it hurt my heart and soul to live without you. Even then, I could never… would never… I refuse to cage you, Dean. I can't, I refuse."
"Almost," Cas countered. "I would argue that, if this is the price to pay for your life in turn, then it is worth it."
“I had a late night,” Cas said as he settled in behind the library’s front desk. “The coffee at home decided to conveniently disappear.”
It wasn't because of the wet clothing; those were taken off to dry, and Cas himself was as close to the lively fire as possible.
Dean closed his eyes as his lips touched Castiel’s. For a moment, he wondered if everything was a dream. When the touch became a kiss, every single doubt was washed away. He returned the affection passionately, pouring all of his love into the kiss. All those years of waiting, all coming to an end in the best way possible.
“Whatever miracle kept us alive, I’m just glad that it was you,” Cas said, almost without thinking. It must have been either the sunburn or some other trick, but he swore Dean’s cheeks turned pink.
“This is gonna sound crazy,” Dean said, having finally removed all the bandages. “But I think these might scar over.”
There were other things on the human’s mind, too. Castiel would need more food, and gather as much drinkable water as possible. He would need to make a shelter, too; the arch of the cove wasn’t going to be enough, especially at night.
"N-No." Cas cleared his throat. "Charlie makes sure there's no forced, uh, interactions of that sort."
While you're waiting for the next part of this sad angst train, you can check out some of my other works. I promise you, majority of them are a lot fluffier.
“Stars,” he breathed, eyes fixed to the millions of glowing blue pinpoints of light attached to the ceiling of the cavern. “They look like stars.”
At least, that’s what Castiel Novak reckoned. Having been living on the water almost ever since he was born, Castiel was as much a part of the ocean as it was a part of him, and if the seas allowed, he would sail to every corner of this vast home. His heart longed for it.
What was he to do now? With no crew to go back to, no port that would welcome him anymore, and no way off the island, Castiel could officially label himself as “stranded and stuck.” There was a chance his wound could become infected, as well, and all that awaited him was a slow, painful death in the future.
Scales. Mer scales, hundreds of them, scattered around the lower waist before amassing lower down. They were iridescent blue, so close in similarity to Cas’ eyes.
Sorry for any mistakes, there is little to no editing involved, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.
While the unorthodox librarian wasn’t entirely dependent on coffee, staying up until almost three in the morning did have an effect on his mood. Not for the first time, either.
There was something about it that Cas could not explain. Why did he desperately wish to be where Dean had gone, through coral reefs and the blue abyss? Why did he wake up from memories that weren’t his own?
“Step away from the merman and turn around,” sneered the guard. Castiel obeyed, now second guessing his decision to keep his crewmate alive. “Captain!”
An inhuman sound pierced the air, something between a shriek and a loud hiss. It was a warning, and a challenge, but most of all, a threat.
Come to think of it, Cas didn’t know why Dean bothered to stay. He didn’t know why Dean kept hunting for him, or continue his incessant winks and quips. It was already a large enough matter, in Castiel’s eyes, that the merman chose to sing or hum in times of distress.
Thank you for taking the time to read this story, I appreciate you all! If you'd like, feel free to check out my one shots while you're waiting for the next chapter to upload.
It was a productive life, but dull. Despite being surrounded by colour, all he felt was grey. Despite getting so much done, he was never fulfilled. Castiel supposed that was how the rest of his life would be, a dull rhythm that was easy to follow, but at least he would be keeping himself alive.
He hadn’t noticed before how close they were. Still in Dean’s arms, their faces were only the barest of distances apart. The merman’s eyes shifted for a split second, and Cas swore on his life that they dipped down to his lips. But that was ridiculous. He could have easily imagined it in the dark… right?
That earned Castiel a raised eyebrow and smirk, and oh my, that redness in his cheeks was starting to become more prominent.
Castiel looked down, at the shell nestled within his palms. It was the same one he had slipped into his pocket the day before, completely forgetting about it. The shell was already unusual in shape, conveniently broken in such a way that it resembled a heart. It was the colouring, however, that caught Castiel’s attention the most; pearlescent shades of green, rippling in the light.
The fire was roaring beautifully in no time, but even so, Cas was too hungry to wait for the whole fish to cook. Raw fish wasn’t too bad, and it stopped him from essentially passing out during the cooking process. Dean stayed close by during the entire meal, generally leaving Castiel alone, but also silently checking in, as if he were afraid the human would actually pass out. It was appreciated, very much so, though Cas couldn’t help but think that Dean no longer owed him anything.
"You know what? You go on ahead," Dean suggested. "Cas and I will stay back for a while. I think we've got a few things to talk about."
There should have been panic; every instinct in him was screaming at him not to open his mouth. But there was no choking, no pain, no rejection of this foreign liquid. Cas touched his gills gently with the pads of his fingers, and felt the water flow through them. There was a slight tingle through his veins, and Cas realised that with his first breath came the first flow of magic.
The green eyed man leaned against the doorway for a second, smirking, then finally stepped inside and closed the door behind him. No. No no no no no.
Cas didn’t even feel himself move. All he knew was that one second, there was the roar of a blood rush in his head, and in the next instant, he had Dean pinned against the wall. Cas gripped Dean’s collar tight, his knuckles almost turning white. His mouth was set into a thin, firm line, and those blue eyes burned with desire. Beneath his grip, Dean panted slightly, that smirk giving way to something resembling a growl.
You could imagine the amount of cheering that took place when Cas said yes, after Dean kneeled down in front of almost the entire school and popped the question.
“That’s understandable. I was a part of the party responsible. And, Dean, your anger is normal. It’s almost rational. Your life was shattered, and you were left with no help.”
Ha. Victory. Cas closed his eyes, allowing himself to be pulled into the memories that Dean recounted. The stories were wonderful, each and every one, some in the most lighthearted ways, and others far more terrifying. But what kept drawing Cas in was the longing. No, not Dean’s longing, but rather his own.
Castiel knew he shouldn’t be so attached to the merman. It wasn’t a matter of “I can survive well enough on my own,” rather, he knew he would have to in the end. Dean’s sunburn was gone; he was back at full strength. There was only one small thread tying the merman to this cove, and Cas knew it wasn’t going to be enough. That thread was bound to break.
Why couldn’t he forget so easily? Simple. Cas’ bond with Dean had become so profound, he had never experienced anything like it. It was hard to imagine that he ever will. A love as deep as this… it tends to leave scars. Cas had come to terms with the fact that he may very well carry those scars for the rest of his life.
It was a Friday, too, which meant Kid’s Reading Hour at the local library. The librarians would take turns participating in weekly tradition, choosing one story to read to the bright-eyed school children. That particular day just happened to be Castiel’s turn.
“I don’t know what to do,” Cas replied, almost too quiet to hear. “I don’t know where to go from here. I am more lost now than I was when I left the crew. I… What do I do, Dean?”
It definitely wasn’t the soft smile that Castiel caught glimpses of in between smirks, or the caring personality, which hid beneath an armour of flirtatious behaviour.
“I love you too.” Cas reached up and brushed his fingertips along Dean’s lips, and the hunter managed to kiss them before they traveled to his jaw.
Was it the cooling air that sent a shiver down the human’s spine? Or was it the way Dean smiled, his eyes softening in a way Cas had never seen them do before?
By the time he returned to the cove with whatever he could carry, Dean was nowhere to be seen. Panic struck Castiel’s chest, until he saw a familiar tail flick up beyond the surf. Good. The merman was nearby, at least.
Dean was the one who offered to pick Charlie up from her house. Sporting a rather handsome maroon suit and tie, he rolled up to his crush's front door in a sleek, polished, black 1967 Chevrolet Impala.
“There’s a small cove,” he explained. “It’s sheltered from the winds most days. We could stay there for the time being.”
He had done all he could do, achieved all he was able to achieve. Once the limit was reached, Castiel forced himself to crawl back into his shelter; not that a lot of force was needed, if he was being honest. Maybe if fate was kind, he could get a proper sleep. Maybe if his mind was kinder, it would accept the invitation of slumber, perhaps even a dream. A pleasant one, if he were lucky.
“Cas!” The hunter laughed and shook his head. “I think you’ve had one too many drinks, buddy. How about we talk about this in the morning, hm?”
Dean was the first who dared to. That first night, on Captain Shurley’s ship. The fact that Castiel had responded to it then as easily as he did now… he liked it. And he didn’t.
There was so much to do, so much to take back, so much ahead. It was overwhelming, and Castiel’s mind running around it all didn’t help. Too much, too tired, weighed down, overwhelmed. When was the last time he slept? Normally, Castiel would have been able to erase such exhaustion, first with the help of his mother, then with all of Captain Shurley’s crew having each other’s backs. If nothing else, then duty kept the figurative tidal waves at bay. But there was no one else anymore. No family, no crew, no friend nor almost lover.
"Alright, Cassie, you're up!" Charlie's voice pipes up through the collective laughter of everyone in the group, cutting through Cas' thoughts. Charlie was practically heading the game. How she played it was that each person would go into the closet one by one, and their partner would be picked by the person who rolled the highest number on a pair of dice. Sounds simple, right?
“Sure, buddy.” The teacher knelt down so he was at the same level as the kid. “What did you anna ask me?”
Once again, thank you for reading through the story. Again, sorry for any mistakes (feel free to point them out so I can correct them, I do very minimal editing, if at all).
"I went home," Dean began to explain. "Well, not right away. I had a lot of meetings with a lot of friends, and most of them suggested the same solution. There were options, of course, but none of them were as strong, none of them would have been enough. It- honestly, it was terrifying to go back, I didn’t know how my father would react, but thankfully he wasn’t even around. I had to, uh, recruit my uncle Bobby- well, not recruit, but...” Dean stopped himself from rambling any further. He took a deep, steadying breath. “What I’m trying to say is… I may have found a way for you to live under the sea with me.”
Castiel tore his eyes away from the maps splayed out in front of him, and instead focused his attention on the man who had just entered the room. Or, rather, captain.
Dean was sure he had the entire bunker to himself. No Sammy around to bother him, no Jack to constantly check up on, and no Cas-
No. That was one possibility Dean would never allow himself to think about. Cas will make it through this without any problems.
“No, no, I wouldn’t. There are a hundred ways I could disappear, right into the middle of society, but… I wouldn’t belong. The expectations are confining, the crowds are suffocating. And if I were recognised, I would be running for the rest of my life.”
Something about Dean felt… good. Really good. And whatever they just started between themselves, Cas didn’t want it to stop.
"I know what you meant, I'm just teasing." Dean glanced sideways at Cas. "You sure have seen a lot of death in your life, haven't you?"
Those were the days when Dean would be leaning back in the shallow waters, a relaxed smile on his face as the water glitters around him.
Slowly, the angel turned his head to see Dean seated in one of the guest chairs, wiping the remains of sleep drool from his face.
With all ability to speak gone, Dean pulled away from the hug, only to slide the ring onto his boyfriend’s - no, fiance's - finger.
I light a candle for each one I mourn, on the anniversary of their… death. It's such a difficult word to think, let alone say. Friends, family, anyone who left a mark on me that I could never forget. Tonight, I light one for Samandriel.
“I can’t go to any port,” Castiel continued, “as they would probably hang me on sight. Even if that wasn’t a large possibility, it would take me a lot of time and effort to construct a raft. Asking you to drag me across the water again is out of the question.”
The shore welcomed them back with small waves and a hushed breeze. When contact was finally broken, Dean offered to hunt for Cas again, much to his friend’s protests. He said he didn’t mind, especially if it meant Cas didn’t have to work so hard.
“Dean!” Cas nearly wept with joy, the ache in his chest growing and subsiding at the same time, as he hugged his lover tightly. There was no possible way he was letting go in the near future.
With fiery red hair and an equally fiery personality to match, the half nerd half geek quickly became close friends with both males. She was as sassy as she was genuine, and nonchalantly captivating. Obviously, the boys thought this easy friendship had blossomed into a crush, and that in turn initiated a rivalry between the two to see who could woo Charlie over first.
"I used to tell my- those around me that it never weighed on my mind. That the blood could easily be washed off. But in truth? It hurts. Even after all these years. I had to do whatever it took to survive, but that never made it any easier. Just made me wonder what separated the man in front of the blade, and the man behind it."
“He is,” Castiel managed to reply. “He’s one of the nicest kids that come in here, so I’m familiar with him. Speaking of familiarity, I don’t think I’ve seen you in here before.”
Once everyone on the deck had settled back into routine, Castiel turned to face the merman, whose burning glare never wavered. Despite knowing that there was attention on him now, the navigator spoke in low tones, just loud enough for the merman to hear. Standing this close in the daylight, Castiel noticed that the merman’s eyes were as green as his tail. There were freckles on every inch of his human half, and to top it all off, a head full of short hair the colour of dark sand.
Creaking wood and endless waves helped mask the careful footsteps. Weaving in between the snorers and sleeptalkers, Castiel slipped out of the sleeping quarters with ease.
Maybe people are destined to find someone who slowly teaches them to let the fears go. Maybe love is something you learn, not something you feel. If that’s the case, then it’s been a long, gruelling learning process indeed, but Dean had to admit, with his heart in his arms, it was worth it.
“Yes, they do.” It’s difficult to say whether Castiel was still on the topic of books. “Well, I hope you enjoy reading that as much as you enjoy our little corner of the world.”
“I said, no.” Cas made to walk away, but was stopped by Dean’s hand on his shoulder. Now the latter male looked more concerned than anything.
“No.” And it was true. “It’s just a gut feeling. Probably nothing, but I thought it best to tell you.”
Castiel’s old crew hadn’t been sighted again since the day Dean drove them off. Sometimes Cas would catch himself glancing to the horizon, dreading the sight of that familiar ship, or any sailing vessel, really.
- and left the cafe feeling so much happier. That was even before he took a sip of his cinnamon beverage.
On top of making dinner for himself, taking out the trash, and leaving some food out for a friend, there was one other task that needed completing before the end of the night.
With the weight off of him, Cas lifted his head, gasping in the much needed air. A second longer, and his lungs would have been filled with water instead.
“I’m here,” Dean whispered. His fangs hadn’t gone away just yet. “I’m here, Cas.” With gentle touches, Dean inspected the man’s face, cursing under his breath at the injuries. They began healing in no time, including the injuries to his back. It must have taken a great deal of effort, Cas noted, but he was in too much shock to comment on it.
Cas, being so touched by the gesture, found it very hard to say no. Accepting his drink with as much grace as he could muster, he thanked Dean -
“You heard me correctly,” Cas continued. His heart screamed to take it all back. “Perhaps it would be better for you if you were with other merfolk. Someone of your species, possibly even find a mate-”
“Yes.” Castiel had done his research over the years, as had the captain, apparently. It was a slow, cruel end. There was nothing left in the end except a dry husk. Unable to handle the image in his mind, he grabbed the nearest bucket and tied a rope to it.
Cas chuckled. "I have been extremely gay for the past two years now, and no one knows it except Charlie. I'm trusting you to keep this between us."
“Wouldn’t dream of leaving,” he whispers, kissing my forehead. A certain kind of calmness seeps in, and as I close my eyes, all I am left with is the memory of Samandriel, and the promise of something better to come.
“Yes, I suppose not wearing my usual coat and hat does come at a surprise,” Chuck replied. “What I find more astonishing, however, is how you managed to survive. If I recall correctly, you were shot and threw yourself overboard, and yet here you are. Without a wound.” Shurley crouched in front of Castiel, close enough that both men could study the details of each other’s face.
"I have always thought of you as a beautiful human being. Not just visually, but in terms of your actions as well. I've seen how you treat your peers, and those younger than you. You give your heart out every day, without anyone fully knowing, and expect nothing back. I've also noticed how uncomfortable it makes you feel when people stare at you, at how they objectify you. You constantly wish to be viewed as a person, and not a token, though for the most part, the environment we're in won't allow it. I don't think people appreciate you enough, Dean Winchester. Not really."
“I may have seen you around the staff room and the playground, but never had the courage to say hi. Besides, I don’t think I would have been able to get a word in, what with one group of children or another trying to get your attention.”
"Later." Cas placed kisses along Dean's neck, each one pressed just a little bit harder against the skin than the last. "The case can wait."
They journeyed together through aisles of fiction, tossing back and forth their respective preferences, as well as the odd critique. It was interesting to see what made the man’s eyes spark to life. It was also interesting to see how their tastes in literature and media differed, and though Castiel wasn’t as big of a geek as the other man, there was fortunately one thing they could agree on.
Dean stared, stunned. All the words that Cas said were filling up his mind, drowning all thought in the best possible way.
They all took up the front two rows of seats. Children from Dean’s 5th grade, and Castiel’s 4th grade class, all dressed fancy and barely containing their joy as the vows were recited. Just as soon as the officiant announced that the grooms may kiss, a familiar voice brought a halt to proceedings.
“You think so?” Dean looked down at himself, and when he raised his gaze again, Cas was sitting at the edge of the bed. “I dunno. It feels comfy, not gonna lie about that, but…” He sat beside his angel, sharing that same smile. “Ah, you know me, I’m more of a leather kind of guy. Questionable fashion choices? That’s your forte.”
Castiel could feel Dean’s powerful tail push against the water, propelling them backwards to keep Cas’ head above the water. He could feel the struggle. They both could.
Dean lets go of me only to lie down on the bed. He then pulls me towards him, and I have no objections to being cuddled by my husband. I think I need it.
“Whale. Shit.” Dean sat up, his eyes absolutely boring into Castiel. “I’m not sure whether you know it or not, but you’ve been pushing me away. You’ve been sending me out, I barely see you anymore, hell, I can’t even talk to you anymore!”
He’d waited until well into the night, when almost everyone else was asleep. The captain was awake, no doubt, as well as whoever kept watch for the time being, but those weren’t a problem for Castiel. Captain Shurley had a habit of staying in his quarters once he’d retired for the night. As for the guard, well, that one is a little more complicated.
Castiel had been keeping an eye on the clouds for a long while. Every bone in his body told him to prepare for a turbulent day of reckoning, but he held off the preparations. The man half-heartedly assured himself that there would be enough time later.
Neither men could stop smiling the whole car ride back, and by the time morning came around, they were both safely snuggled into the arms of one another. A pleasant experience, indeed.
A particularly large wave crashed over the sand, dousing the merman. The first crackle of a flame followed shortly after, and soon, Castiel had a large fire going. Finally, there was warmth.
There had been no mishaps detected so far, but they both knew, removing the kelp could reveal something unexpected. Dean, being the worrier he is, would not begin the unwrapping process without being absolutely certain that Cas was alright, that he was safe, and that there truly was nothing else left of the transformation process. It did make Cas laugh a little, but only out of endearment. It took a lot of convincing (and kisses) to make Dean stop being such a mother hen.
Confused, he looked around for whatever had caused them to let go, but all he saw were still bodies, crimson waters… and a flash of green.
Also, "Cas" nickname privileges have been revoked because Dean isn't there (just for the writing style, I'm not actually taking it away, don't worry).
"I'm sorry," Cas whispered into the night, his useless apology carrying over waters he dared not touch. "I am so, so sorry."
“I began collecting shells while you were gone,” Cas said. “It was… a way to help me live. Small, but lovely. This is all that’s left of the collection.”
The wild winds came out of nowhere, fast and merciless. Hair, dirt, and grains of sand both whipped past Castiel’s eyes, as he struggled to fasten down any loose items. Trees, rocks, anything that could provide stability.
Castiel had been in the closet once already (they were on their second round), and the sheer anxiety he felt due to not knowing if he was going to get Dean was insane. You can imagine how big his sigh of relief was when Balthazar stumbled through instead, half drunk, taking up all 7 minutes by rambling on about some hot girl he hooked up with recently.
Though the brown-haired, scruffy-bearded captain was shorter than Castiel, that did  not mean the respect given was any less. As one of the most successful seafarers of his time, Captain Chuck Shurley was not a man to be easily underestimated. He was sly, cunning, patient, stubborn, and not afraid to get his hands dirty when needed.
What Cas didn’t know was that while Dean kept contact with one hand, the former hunter’s other hand was busy fiddling with something in his pocket.
“Ok. Ok…” Cas did trust him. Completely. Besides, he had no one else to help him now, and considering Dean hadn’t called for help, neither did the merman.
That behaviour continued well into the night, with the exception of dinner time. The two lovers lay peacefully in the damp sand, staring up at the diamond-dotted sky. Cas was using Dean’s upper arm as a pillow, which the merman didn’t mind at all.
Dean came back when Castiel was submerged up to his chest. The merman circled once, twice, then popped his head above the surface.
Cas continued to build and plan, but this time, he allowed Dean’s gentle humming to fill his ears, instead of his own voice. By the time the melody had ended, the human found himself at peace. Complete, content, an almost homely peace. It took him far too long to realise something.
“I never saw you as anything less than a person or another being, Dean. You had a life. I suppose it was the least I could do before that life was taken away.”
The shelter was flimsy, but it did its job, for the most part. There was almost nothing to be done about the lack of warmth; fires were useless, and the closest thing Castiel had for a blanket were the clothes on his back. Sickness was the last thing he needed.
The navigator cut himself off before he said anything that would get him punished. However, a low voice, one that was already becoming so familiar, prompted him on.
“Mostly, yeah,” the merman admitted. “But I did mean it when I said you worked too hard. I just thought you might like this.”
Dean dared to pull Cas closer, just a little, surprised that there was no resistance from the angel. Cas, in turn, tucked his head in the crook of Dean’s neck, and the two settled into each other.
Castiel wanted to believe him. He really did. The way Dean spoke, with such confidence, it would make anyone believe him. But there was doubt behind the merman’s eyes, Cas could see it.
Turns out that getting a hold of oneself was becoming more difficult. Especially when whatever birthed itself in Castiel’s chest was growing by the day.
Dean passed his gaze over the bright blue pyjamas which now adorned his body. A pattern of teddy bears all looked up at him. Silently mocking him. He knew exactly why the to had chosen this particular set of pyjamas; the lovers had gotten into a discussion about teddy bears once over some coffee, and Cas had called Dean his teddy bear. Unfortunately, Sam was within earshot of the whole thing, and boy did he refuse to let it go.
When it came to their first dance, Cas was so shy that he half hid his face in Dean’s shoulder the whole time. Partially due to the fact that he was only a half decent dancer, but mostly because Dean had refused to let go of his hand since the buddy check.
“Yes,” Cas replied, a little too harshly. He cleared his throat. “Sorry, I suppose I’m just stressed.”
Sometimes Castiel would catch himself sitting in the shallowest waves, casually running his hands through the clear water. Emotions would ebb and flow like the tide, but never release. Hollowness filled every other crevice. Feeling everything one could not feel anymore. Sometimes he would ache, most times he would just be.
The big day came four months later, with both families pitching in to help with the event. On Castiel’s side was his single father, Chuck, his two older brothers, Michael and Gabriel, and his younger sister, Anna. Dean’s mother and father, Mary and John, were both present, as well as his younger brother, Sam, and Sam’s girlfriend, Jessica. Several friends were invited as well, mostly colleagues from the grooms’ current and former schools.
So with the last ounce of air left in him, Cas graced his lips with the sweetest word he had ever uttered.
“I’m sorry,” Dean whispered. “I’m so sorry. I should have known. Cas, why couldn’t I see that?” He opened his eyes again, and Cas could see half formed tears on his bottom eyelid. “All this time, you’ve been letting me take you for granted?”
Dean nudged his friend's shoulder, prompting Cas to laugh and nudge him back a little harder. It soon turned into playful shoving, which then turned into throwing water in each other’s faces. Dean pushed himself further out into the water, splashing with his tail in a teasing manner.
“We almost were, asshole,” the merman snapped back. His voice… Castiel could only compare it to a storm; deep, rough, passionate, and most of all, dangerous.
The first appearance was accompanied by Castiel’s soft gasp. As more and more revealed themselves, Cas found himself to be a small child again, gazing up at the wonders of the world.
Angels feel just as deeply as humans do, if not more. Angels get just as lost, often begging for guidance ourselves. We have stumbled, lost sight of our path, and fallen more times than any of us would like to admit.
“Quiet!” Castiel flinched. “You know the penalty for mutiny, Mr Novak. And as fond as I had grown of you, rules are rules.” Chuck drew his sword, a bejeweled souvenir from a dead noble. “Such a shame, really. I will have to go through the trouble of finding another cartographer. Any last words?”
Exhaustion prevented him from waking up to the quiet sniggers and jeers of men, but by then it was too late.
“I do,” Dean grinned. “I really do.” He cradled Cas’ face, just drinking in the sight of his lover being so light and free. “I’m happy for you, Cas. I really am. And I am so damn proud.”
But there would be no reply. The storm carried his voice away, replacing everything inside with fear.
Spend enough time at sea, and the rocking of a ship becomes as natural as breathing. The salt in the air moulds itself to your body, your lungs, your hair. Each bird cry becomes a hello, and each wave on the azura surface becomes another heartbeat.
After an hour at the bar and many drinks later, Cas had shed off his trench coat and rolled up the sleeves of his white work shirt. Dean would deny it til the end of his days, but he definitely was checking out Cas’ forearms. Luckily, the angel was a little tipsy, and didn’t notice.
“I am.” Cas allowed himself to let his gaze meet Dean’s. Big mistake. Those green eyes locked onto him, piercing, searching, stripping Castiel down to all that he really meant inside.
Whew. Relief. And a little bit of laughter. Cas quickly saved the number and put the contact’s name as “Dean”.
“Huh. I don’t know. If you mean the place I was born, then no, I wouldn’t go back. I don’t even think of it as home anymore. Actually, for me, home isn’t a place. Sammy feels like home. You feel like home. I guess I don’t really have to return anywhere.”
Cas swore he had never whipped his head around so fast. That smug, smirking, wonderful merman was casually propped up on the sand on one elbow, just out of Castiel’s line of vision.
If their fates were to become stranded eternally with only each other as company, then they could live off of this moment alone. Each would drink it in place of water, and use this memory to feed their own hungry heart. The world be damned; for the night, this was their world in front of them.
Flashes of silver or colour would streak past in groups, sweeping the dreamer up before disappearing.
It took all of Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael’s strengths to lift Castiel and drag him towards the water. It was a cruel twist of fate, one the man would not accept willingly. Fighting against such fit people, when Cas was in such terrible health himself, bore no fruit for him.
"Surprise!" Balthazar flung the closet door wide open, catching Dean and Cas square in the middle of initiating their first kiss. They both looked like a pair of deer caught in the headlights as the rest of their group laughed and cheered. Cas pulled himself away from Dean faster than he had ever moved before, brushing himself off as his face and ears burned. He looked at Dean, not being able to hide a smile, and Dean shrugged.
Now Castiel was back in the closet, and this time, he was less nervous. It was a broom closet, really, but quite spacious, and all the cleaning equipment had been dumped outside. There was no light, except that which came from the small dirty window in the door. Even so, Cas felt cramped. Were there any spiders? There better not be any spiders.
Castiel could only stare, as open-mouthed as the fish Dean was offering. This was a dream. It had to be. But no, this was real, as proven by Dean waving his hand and asking if Cas was alright.
“Whatever you need to find, I have faith that you will,” Cas said. “Faith, and the knowledge that you are stubborn beyond help.”
Everyone turned to face the small boy with the mullet, who stood on top of his chair, a huge grin on his face.
“My mother,” Dean answered. Castiel managed to catch the merman’s jaw clenching, but just as he was about to dismiss the question, Dean continued. “She would collect human songs, so to speak. Used to sing them to me and my brother all the time.”
Dean almost couldn't believe what he was hearing. He hadn't meant to be so intimidating to Cas before the rivalry. Truth be told, Cas always had Dean's attention. The latter just could never bring himself to make the first move.
“When are you going to let go of my hand?” Cas chuckled. He felt a pair of lips press against his hairline, as Dean placed a soft kiss onto his temple.
“I can use my magic to turn you into a merman.” Dean grinned. “Yes. And these,” he gestured to the sack, “will help. It’s the kelp from my home we use to wrap merfolk while they’re changing, so my theory is, it will help you as well. There are some other items which will amplify my magic, if needed, but- Cas? Are you ok?”
So busy with tinkering and singing was he, that Cas didn’t notice when Dean pulled himself up onto the sand. He didn’t notice Dean resting his head on one hand, listening with a calm sense of awe. There were many beautiful sounds of the sea, many created by merfolk themselves, but this… Dean could tell it came from the heart. And in that moment, it was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard.
Dean couldn’t stop smiling, or giggling like a school kid. Despite the flutter of butterflies in his stomach, he felt free, almost weightless. In a rush of euphoria, Dean rushed forward and press his lips against Castiel’s, all care in the world gone.
The kids giggle their approval and hurry on back to their bus, with a little persuasion from their teacher.
The request was soft, but Castiel would not resist it. Sea-born knuckles brushed against his cheek as eyes of blue met eyes of green.
The question took Cas by surprise, and he sat up to get a better look at Dean’s face. Despite the surprise, he couldn’t fight the smile on his face.
Castiel didn’t even realise he had lunged forward, not until he was forced face down into the sand. Gabriel pressed a knee against his back, and it was only until Michael pulled him up by the hair that Castiel was able to breathe again. Good thing his mind stopped him from inhaling sand.
While the librarian had no trouble sporting a patchy denim jacket, several items of jewelry, various piercings, and a smattering of tattoos, this newcomer was… clean. So to speak. Short golden-brown hair in an almost standard cut, brown leather jacket, no tattoos or piercings as far as he could see, and the only piece of jewelry was a strange necklace dangling from the man’s neck. For all intents and purposes, the man looked ordinary, and yet there was something fascinating about him.
"Look, this has been fun, but I know what's been going on between you two. You guys are my best friends, and I love hanging out with both of you, equally, but I could never date either of you. I like girls."
The last thing he saw that night was the gentle swaying of the flames, before sleep finally embraced him in a tight hold. It almost became a death hold.
Dean knew that his angel was low on grace, yet even after being told over and over again, he didn't know just how bad it had gotten.
When Dean opened his bedroom door, he expected to find his headphones on the bed, right where he left it. What he didn’t expect to find was Castiel’s trench coat, draped neatly over the covers, as if it were expecting to be worn. Finding the coat in random places in the bunker wasn’t an issue; Cas had become so comfortable with the family that he often shed his outer layer of clothing, which had become his armour of sorts. This was the first time Dean had seen the coat in his room, and while it was just a piece of clothing, there was something that made the hunter hesitate.
Yes, your brain will remind you of things and feelings you'd rather forget. It will keep reminding you of mistakes and failures, to the point where you believe that those are the defining points of who you are. Speaking from experience, you brain is a liar. It's a caveman-era survival way of thinking that is blown way out of proportion, and ends up being self destructive, rather than a lesson learnt. Failure, anger, guilt, embarrassment, fear... they only make up a portion of your life. Yes, that portion varies from person to person, but there are still other parts of you, and they need to be loved and cared for as well.
"We don't have to do anything, right?" Dean asked nonchalantly, leaning back against the opposite wall with his arms crossed.
Cas nodded, hoping he would understand. Dean was already using his magic on Cas, keeping that one held breath lasting far longer than it should. That was more than enough.
Yet it wasn’t the spring-green eyes, dusting of freckles, full lips, and stunning jawline which tipped Cas over the edge.
Anyway, if you've enjoyed this fic so far, feel free to check out my other works, too! Majority of what I write are short one shots, but not too bad (I think?)
Finally got off my butt and finished the chapter. Whoo!! It's a bit short, but hopefully the next chapter is a little longer.
Every little thing Dean gave of himself, his time, or his effort was a gift, and yet they were given so freely.
Dean did nothing. He made no sound, no movement, and if someone were to walk in, they’d have thought him to be a statue. At first Castiel thought that he had made a mistake, but just as he was about to pull his hand away, Dean covered it with his own hand. The hunter closed his eyes and sighed, leaning into the touch.
“Yes. Quite the charmer, aren’t you?” There was a hint of a smirk on Castiel’s lips, and Dean swore the colour staining his own cheeks was permanent now.
“Absolutely.” They matched with mirrored grins and scrunched up eyes, noses bumping together in playfulness. Dean managed to steal one more kiss before Cas rested his head on the merman’s chest.
"I don't know. There were several instances where I tried to establish contact, but you either didn't notice, or I was too scared."
It was as if a switch was flipped inside Cas’ head. Cas could almost see the events of the night unfold, could see where that would lead him. It wasn’t right. He didn’t like it, didn’t want it, not anymore. And what Dean had just said… it wasn’t right. Clarity sliced through the drumming in his head, and Cas shakily let go of Dean.
When it was time to test his gills, there was hesitation. Cas held onto Dean’s upper arms as they both tread water, preparing for the important moment.
No one could make out the words, but whatever was said, it cut deep. The merman lashed out, one taloned hand clamping itself tight around Raphael’s throat, a harsh and shrill snarl ripping its way through the air.
We sit in silence for the longest time, and I admit, in that interval, I’m drawing as much comfort from Dean as I can. When my breathing becomes unstable, I close my eyes, and Dean uses that as his cue to run his hand up and down my arm. Part of me wonders what I would do without the human who taught me how to love, not just carry a heart. The human who caught me when I fell, and has continued to hold me ever since, despite our conflicts. Dean is someone I could never part with, even if I wanted to. I know the basis of our fight against the supernatural is the rejection of fate, but I can’t help but think that somehow, something with Dean feels right. Like I belong with him.
“Oh, don’t be like that, I only want to make small talk. It’s not as if you have anything better to do than to answer me, anyway. Now, one last time… how did you survive?”
Family is complicated, no doubt about that. And no matter how you may have felt about them, once they're gone, you can't help but miss them, in some way. Of course, some families are too cruel to ever miss. I should know. The Winchesters know it, too. This time, however, I have a good reason to miss the one I mourn.
Mr Winchester - a well built man with experienced eyes the colour of mid-spring leaves, a dusting of freckles across his structured face, and an easy, confident air about him - finished off with the roll and continued eating his lunch. It was a beautiful fall day, and half the school was out on a field trip to the local museum. Some of the kids had groaned in their seats when the announcement about the trip was made. A museum? Boooooriiiing! Mr Winchester, however, promised the class that he would make it a fun day, and he didn't let them down. As soon as they entered the building, there was never a dull moment; whether that child was a complete nerd, or absolutely into sports, Mr Winchester made sure everyone enjoyed themselves.
"And I'm bi as FUCK!" Dean announced as he grabbed Castiel, dipped him, and kissed him fully right then and there, in front of everyone. Among Sam's shouts of "Get a room!" was Cas' unbridled laughter.
I'm thinking next chapter might be the last one. It's been a great run, but unfortunately, all things must come to an end sooner or later. I don't know how long until it's uploaded, but we'll see.
In addition to that, Dean also made the wonderful mistake of buying four sets of fuzzy blue socks for Cas. It wouldn’t have made a difference, except the bunker had smooth wooden floors, and…
Cas checked in on himself, making sure he was anchored into reality. Two legs. Ten toes. Two hands, and ten fingers. Breathe air in, breathe air out.
He realised the gut feeling from before wasn’t for the crew and ship after all… it was for the living, breathing person bleeding out in a fish net, treated more like property than anything else.
When Cas was deemed well enough to be sent back home, Dean was there every step of the way to ensure the angel was alright. At times it was annoying, being treated like a child; Cas would have to repeat himself several times, before Dean would begrudgingly accept that he could take care of himself. However, Cas had to admit that, on the whole, the extra help was welcomed. And needed. Very much needed.
“Words can’t describe how much I regret what happened that night. And I feel as if I have no right to ask, but Dean… can you forgive me?”
Something in Dean’s tone made Cas look up. He blinked away the tears as much as he could, and found himself staring at Dean’s distraught face, as the man knelt in front of him. He knew that face. He knew just how much Dean’s throat closed up in that moment, and what kind of raw pain it would take to get that reaction in the first place. Cas just never imagined in his lifetime that he would be the source of it one day. Before Cas could process anything else, he was being pulled gently into a tight hug. At first he resisted, tensing his body and pushing himself away, but after a soft “please” from the Winchester, the blue eyed male finally fell against Dean’s body, holding him just as tightly as he cried into Dean’s chest.
They arrived at the school hall five minutes into the start of the prom (Dean being fashionably late, as always). He parked the car, opened the passenger door, and was escorting Charlie to the front steps when a confused, yet very familiar voice spoke up behind them.
Dean finally turns around, eyebrows raised at the request. Cas’ little head tilt, that ghost of a smile, the earnestness in his eyes… damn, it made Dean’s heart skip a beat every time.
Dean came back to find Castiel sitting with his feet in the water, a distant look in those sky blue eyes. There was something in the man’s hands that he couldn’t quite make out.
Neither could let go of each other. Neither wanted to. It was a moment akin to a birth, and this was their celebration.
“Fine,” Cas conceded. Dean’s tail did a happy little flick out of the water, and if the man was being honest, it was worth it.
the sea was something else entirely. Dean wasn’t wholly surprised, nor was he shocked, but there were questions to be answered. Mainly, how could a human possibly live under the water? Dean’s magic alone wouldn't be enough to assist Cas for a week, and certainly not for a lifetime. Looking down at the human finally asleep in his arms, Dean’s heart sank; humans just weren’t born to live in the seas.
“Good. Ok, let’s not celebrate completely just yet, that tail needs to be put to good use. Besides, we still need to test if you can breathe underwater as well.”
Not minding the damp clothing, Cas pushed further up the cove to collect more fuel for the fire. Now that the light of day was brighter, he could see just how dense the vegetation around the cove really was. He remembered telling Dean that he’d been to this island before, but even so, everything somehow seemed more lush. Like it had grown along with Castiel.
While not all clouds indicated a storm approaching, it was best to prepare for even the slightest of rainfall.
“Uh, regular cinnamon latte, please.” A burst of courage. “And your name, since I didn’t catch it the last time we met?”
“Ass.” Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Dammit, Cas, we were worried. I was worried. I honestly thought…” Dean didn’t let himself finish that thought, and instead looked away for a moment, lips pressed tightly together. “I’m just happy you’re ok.”
After spending three years as Dean Winchester's roommate, you would think Castiel would have gotten over every tiny detail that made the male appealing to him.
There was a shout from the shoreline; someone had noticed the blood. Three of the crew rushed into the waters, thinking Cas was responsible.
“It’s on the house,” Dean said with a shrug. “Figured I should thank you for helping me out last week.”
“How does it feel?” Dean asked. He watched as Cas lifted his new azure tail out of the water, wiggling it almost like a finger. The pure, happy smile on Cas’ face said it all.
“Head- head west,” Cas instructed. “There’s a small island. There’s not much, but it’s the closest piece of land around.”
The storm grew far too rapidly. It was as if the heavy rain poured down in the time it took to blink. Cold seeped into everything, including Castiel, right down to their core. He had seen what rain as freezing as this could do to a man, and it was not a fate he wished for himself.
This is more the official start of me shoving these two together in the proverbial closet and yelling "Kiss!"
“Yes, well, uh, I’d rather keep my good health, or whatever’s left of it. Besides, you are still recovering.” Castiel tilted his head. “Speaking of recovering, I thought you would be spending as much time under the water as possible.”
“Uh, really? I mean, you sure? You could be missing out on something good.” Dean raised his eyebrows suggestively. He meant the potential girls, obviously, but apparently drunk Cas didn’t see it that way.
“It’s alright,” Dean spoke softly, rubbing Castiel’s back. “Shhh, it’s alright. Hey… I’ve you, I’m here, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I… fuck, I should have been there earlier. You- They nearly…” Dean’s embrace tightened a little, his voice breaking as well. “I’m going to kill them for what they did to you.”
. One hand drifts up to his shoulder, slides halfway in across his chest before his arm drops back to his side and he…
“Well I care. He shouldn’t-- He pulled me out of Hell for something better than this, but this is what I am. So.”
As for Cas… as far as Sam can tell, Cas is normal. They’re on friendly enough terms, he doesn’t live in the bunker all the time in this world but he shows up often enough, and they help each other out. Actually, it seems like Cas not living in the bunker is a whole big Thing in this world, because he’s locked out of Heaven and he’s not really living anywhere, but he won’t just move into one of the open rooms, and if there’s a reason why, Sam doesn’t see it, but he can at least guess that that’s the problem he ought to be trying to fix.
. You’re still stuck here, in my world, playing the game I give you. And I can bring him back… that doesn’t mean I won’t take him away again.”
“Often. He is uncomfortable with what I have seen, and he wishes I did not know him so well. I don’t understand this, but I know it to be the case.”
.” Deanna agrees, bursting into the room just then and making him very glad he had put some clothes on. “Can never get the drop on ‘em. You got a lock on their location?”
The thing is, Dean’s a hunter in this world same as in their own. Wears the same basic uniform-- well, he doesn’t know if the jeans and boots are the same-the same, but the jacket thrown over the back of the booth looks like their dad’s jacket, she’s got a flannel shirt on over a faded band tee, and her hair might be short because it won’t get grabbed or get in her eyes in a fight, without the trouble of putting it up, but the overall look is very butch. Sam gives himself-- herself, he guesses, or… Sam gives themself a discreet look, only to get distracted by suddenly having cleavage. Okay, table that for later, he’ll assess the cleavage in private. It’s his cleavage, he’s allowed to do that.
“Your stomach is right where it has always been, between your liver and your large intestine.” Cas scowls. “I did not leave it behind.”
where you brought us. Yeah, I’m fine. You’re just a little punch-drunk there, pal. You feeling solid yet?”
“Well… let me show you what I’ve got so far on this case.” He motions Cas over, opens up his laptop and pulls up the research that his other self had been compiling, the stuff that Chuck’s highlight reel had given him.
“That was at the State Fair! We got to pet bunnies, Sam, I took you on the Scrambler! And you want to compare the culinary delights to be found in that veritable paradise to your cream-less mushroom soup? Mushrooms anywhere but a pizza are just--”
his strong suit-- stuff like feelings, or thinking about what he actually wants. And we… didn’t grow up with a lot of acceptance. About anything. I mean, our dad disowned me for going to
There’s a girl at the bar who’s his Dean’s actual type, who he could point out, unless this Dean is strictly into dick. That’s the stuff he’s got to know going in. She’s definitely giving Dean-- or Deanna-- the eye, which makes it a fair opportunity to play wingwoman, but...
“As always, it was my pleasure to do it.” Cas says, with a little shrug that verges on just being a tic of his head to the side. With a little smile that’s not quite relaxed and never seems to last long enough, the kind you don’t even see if you’re not looking.
Dean doesn’t sleep long. Cas, predictably, sleeps in. Dean sets Sam the task of guarding him while doing research in their room, while he heads out to question witnesses.
Except for the part where there are children, too, all of whom scream and scatter at the sight of him and Dean, cries of ‘raiders’ from the older ones and ‘bad men’ from the younger as they make for the other end of the enclosed garden--  and one just in tears, frozen in fear until an older child grabs him and carries him back through another doorway. Indoors, Sam assumes.
Cas lets out an amused huff. “He misunderstood me. I wanted… I wanted his help with something. I wished to-- I wanted to arrange something fair, in exchange for the favor I-- Well. We didn’t get very far into that conversation.”
“Is it? This is good to know.” He licks salt and ketchup from his fingers, momentarily devoted to the task.
Dean doesn’t believe she’s coming back. Not before Christmas anyway. He wants to believe, he’s probably told himself if he does this and that right, she’ll just show up and be a mother to them. But there’s no faith under it, Sam can tell.
“I’m glad. I’ve gotta… I’ve gotta go. I’ll try and make it quick. But you’re gonna be okay, Dean’s still here. You’ve got your cereal. You’re good.”
“Next settlement’s the Spike and Rail. Hold it together and I promise… If the 99 holds out and we don’t hit any monsters, it’s thirteen more minutes. You can rest when we get there.” Dean looks up at him, brow knit with worry. “I know we’ve been on the road a long time. And if you wanna stop… hell, we’ve been going a long damn time, maybe… maybe there’s no-- maybe we just stop, and stick with the next group of people.”
There ain’t exactly a world full of therapists who cater to hunters, and most hunters Bobby knows would rather get eaten by something than sit down and
Oh, and Sam’s officially reached the age where he’s turning into Bobby. Although, as far as father figures to turn into go… Yeah, no contest.
It’s so familiar and it’s so right, and maybe Cas wasn’t away long, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t feel long. It always does. More than that, it’s the way he says ‘from you’... like it’s not about being away from the bunker, from whatever the quest du jour might be, from anybody else but Dean.
. Bigger than anything he’s ever thrown himself up against. Whatever made that sound doesn’t even make the hellhounds that tore him to shreds look like a pack of chihuahuas-- whatever made that noise makes them look like a
“You know what, fuck you very much, don’t give me that-- don’t-- Can you just for once accept that you don’t know, and you’re not gonna know, and you can’t understand this? And there’s no chick flick moment on the face of this
“I mean, the oldest of those kids couldn’t have set up that kind of warding, which normally, you know, I’d think witches, but what’s a powerful witch want with a bunch of kids? Usually nothing good. And you’d think--”
“Let him take a walk, and if he’s not back in a few, I’ll go get him.” Sam pats Dean’s knee. “Eat your soup.”
“Oh? You don’t want to lecture me? Not gonna give me those sad eyes and tell me I’m better than I think?”
He finds the bag of stuff in the attic and he cleans up, and he looks like himself still, weird and welcome, as they head off to find Sam and read the big idjit the riot act.
And that has to be on purpose, the purr to his voice, the way he shifts, just enough to nudge back against Cas’ hips, it has to be that he wants what Cas does…
Sam raises his eyebrows at having been volunteered, but since Dean seems disinclined to move and it was his idea to call Cas, he gets up and goes to let him in.
He finally turns from his contemplation of Dean, fixing Sam with a sorrowful look. “I thought I could change things, for you. I thought if I could spare you… I thought I could change the dark road you were destined to take. But I failed you. I failed you both. How did you know me?”
Cas nods and surrenders the .45, watching closely as Dean loads and unloads it, so that he can do the same.
Apparently there’s a response to that he’s supposed to give, because Dean just looks at him when he doesn’t respond correctly.
“Cas explained everything, so I guess we don’t have to. I don’t know if you thought I’d be upset, or… disgusted, or-- what, but I’m not. I mean it freaked me out a little, I didn’t expect that, just… he told me what the deal is, and I guess I’m… I’m glad he’s making sure you, uh, heal up.”
“Just keep driving. I’ll tell you when to turn.” Cas promises, and there’s an effort under the evenness of his voice, there’s something hard-won about his composure, but Sam trusts him. Even if he had another choice, he thinks he would.
“I hope it’s all right.” He says, though doubt licks at his insides for a moment. “I had to let your soul guide me, and it’s possible that your freckles are not placed as they should be, I did not have a map of them. My goal was to restore your body perfectly. I understood that the tattoo was important, and aside from that it was only a matter of putting you together with none of the other things that have caused you pain.”
“Sam, you’re my brother, and if you ever loved me, you’ll dump this soup down the drain before Cas gets back, I am not eating this.”
“Okay, well, Sam’ll get you settled in. Don’t touch anything in the kitchen while I’m out, I’ll be back before it’s done.”
“When Cas comes back in here, I don’t care how much you tell him about your feelings, that’s up to you--”
“I don’t know, he knows a lot of stuff, he’s been around a long time. He’s healed weird shit before.”
He spares a little thought towards being grateful, once he remembers Sam is still in the room with them, that he’s elected not to turn that into an argument if he’s overheard them, and not to bitch over them having their moment if he hasn’t.
He snaps his fingers and they’re in his… office, or viewing room, or… well, whatever he wants to call it. Sleek and eerie, with a wall of screens. Sam’s on one of them, but it’s the Sam of twenty-six or twenty-seven, playing pool in some bar. Another screen lights up, the chess game from The Seventh Seal. Another, Bill and Ted challenging Death to a game of Twister. A couple other screens light up with scenes Sam doesn’t recognize, one lights up with a scene he does-- himself, again, poker this time, and unlike the pool game, that was life-or-death stakes.
“Hm?” He looks down at himself. “Hey, I’m not the one who made the ‘let’s all wear pants in the bunker’ rule. But you know how it is.”
“I mean hypothetically. So you just think about what you want.” Dean scowls at him, but there’s no real upset in it. He remains in Cas’ personal space even as Cas retakes his chair, bends over the table and pauses to stretch, arching his back between moves. “Thinking about it?”
“Hey, Sam.” Chuck’s voice whispers in his ear. “You don’t want to know what happens if you get three strikes. But as it is, I had to re-set some things. You’re going in blind, buddy.”
“I mean if he feels so strongly about it, what am I supposed to do? What do you want me to say, huh? Am I supposed to cry about it?”
“Dean…” Cas moves towards him, his steps faltering, his hand stopping short of finding the mark on Dean’s shoulder. “Sam asked for my help, I agreed to give it. That’s all.”
So now there are two less vamps in the world, Dean is fine, everyone’s back home… and Cas is about as stir crazy as a tiger in a dog kennel. He’s literally pacing around the map table while Sam is passing out beers, coat flapping behind him like a manic beige bat.
Cas glares at him, depositing him in an armchair, and then holding up a hand like he’s telling a dog to stay.
“I mean… give Dean some time. Don’t write him off just because he needs time to wrap his head around you being you.”
“Well I’m not gonna repeat anything else we said in front of the kiddo. I don’t know when kids start picking up swears, but the first full sentence Sammy ever said was ‘oh shit, my shoes’.”
“You don’t take an angel on hunts so he can stand around wringing his hands and repeatedly failing to reload a firearm. I should have smote our enemies and healed your wounds.”
“Remember, it’s a smooth motion. You’re not just pulling the trigger, you’re squeezing down. You let up after the shot goes off. Think you got it?”
“Couple hours. You needed it. Didn’t miss much. No abandoned cars on the pass-- nobody who knew the area’d try and take it if they didn’t have the fuel. We drove past a lake, that’s about as exciting as it got.”
“I did.” Dean isn’t the one to say. “I also healed you, and brought us here. But Dean was involved also, in all of these things.”
“Definitely checking you out.” Sam glances over at the mystery brunette. This Dean’s gotta still like women, right? The woman at the bar must think so, because she keeps shooting some pretty
“Mm-- better.” Cas nods, pausing only briefly and saying only that much, before finishing the rest of his food. “Much better. I forgot this feeling… or, it became unreal to me, after my experience with Famine. It is a relief to feel satisfied-- and on so little.”
Sam really gets a look at what mediating between the two most stubborn, self-loathing assholes he knows can entail.
“And you’ll get it.” Chuck says, touches his shoulder and sends him tumbling through the shaky chalk line between realities.
. But he got us the mushrooms, and he’s really touchy about not being full-strength. And I asked, they’re definitely edible.”
“I dunno… I did. But I’m kind of into what we got going now. You know, you guys, miserable. Alone. Suffering. You had your chance to play ball, Sam. You’ve had the chance to play ball for… what is it, over a decade now?”
“Have you felt any ill effects since the sliming? Did the witch say anything when you were exposed to the slime-- it would help if you recognized the language, but it’s not a barrier if you’re unsure.” He strides over, grabbing Dean and examining his pupils, feeling his forehead, things Dean submits to without protest, in spite of all his arguing earlier.
It’s a little A-frame, most of it squeezed into a single room-- though there’s a second bed up in a loft, which Sam guesses he’ll be taking, and what he assumes is a bathroom. There are a couple of armchairs flanking the fireplace, a queen bed directly in front of it, and in the back corner there’s a kitchenette, a couple of dining chairs stacked against the far wall. Looks like a table folds up from behind the headboard of the bed. Weird, but it’s certainly a use of space.
“Friggin’ witches.” Dean spits, wiping frantically at his face, and the viscous, inky purple substance that he’d had flung at him. “This curse better not be genital warts.”
“Hoo boy, we have… a lot to unpack there.” Sam collapses onto his own bed with a sigh. “How much can you tell me about this coming war?”
“I do not consider a mortal lifespan to be a very long time. And I do not mind waiting.” He nods, giving Sam a smile. “I believe in time we may have a smoother understanding of each other… and if we do not, it is still worth it to me to have tried, for him.”
Sam looks down at himself. He’s dressed like a normal person-- like the normal person he was going to be, not like a hunter. It’s just… stunningly
“Angels don’t befriend their charges. My duty is not to watch over Dean from birth to death, like some human conception of a ‘guardian angel’, my duty, after securing his rebirth, is to ensure his safety so that he might fulfill his destiny and prevent the end of all things. To prepare him for a coming war. It does no good to be his ‘friend’.”
He strides over to Sam and drops down to one knee, does it too fast to be human, expression completely impassive as he picks him up off the floor.
“We’re clearly not wanted here. Do I want to poke around traumatizing a bunch of kids? No. We-- we can still make it to Spike and Rail. Because if-- if we were supposed to find this place, then we’d have been here a long time ago. We’d--”
When Cas does emerge from his nest of blankets and general aura of grumpiness, coming up on noon, he blinks and scans the room before finally settling his squint on Sam.
“Uh…” Dean glances off at nothing, at least nothing Sam can see in the dark, then turns back to face him. “That’s a complicated question.”
“Oh, oh, he’s confident!” He laughs, moving his own pieces around. “Okay, tough guy. Let’s keep this going, you wanna compete? Let’s compete.”
. But… they’re sitting next to each other, and they’re not pretending things are normal. They’re just getting through it. That’s what they do.
“I’m glad to remain useful.” Cas says, something distant to his voice, and Sam gets his pot started heating, before joining him.
“No. It allows him to complete his healing… but no part of me could make him purer than he is. At his most broken, he was a
“Y’ello?” He brings it up to his ear without checking the caller-- only so many people it could be-- and reaches out to smack Dean’s hand away from the popcorn, because he keeps trying to eat their decorating supplies, like he doesn’t have real food going in the oven.
“I know how it feels, ‘cause I have slipped through, to the very depths of my soul.” He joins in, soft, half-hesitant, and Sam’s seen Dean be good with kids before, good with a baby, but this… this is the most clear-cut case of baby fever he thinks he’s ever seen on an actual human being. “Ooh, baby, I just wanna show you what a clear view it is from every bend in the road…”
“No. I really don’t. Jerk.” He rolls his eyes. “Guy brings you back to life with brand new arteries and you immediately wanna put a lifetime of cholesterol back in your body…”
“Unfamiliarity with the mechanics of it is also an issue, as is aim and factoring for resistance and gravity, but yes. My first encounter with one, it was… you’ll laugh.” Cas flashes him a bashful smile. “The gentleman was trying to teach me how to use one, but it was this… this little thing. A great deal of art and engineering had gone into it, but, when it went off-- not being used to them?-- I squeezed down suddenly, and…”
Things are subdued, to say the least. For all that Dean had put on a brave face in front of the kid, he’s
No matter how many times he does the thing where all of his organs fail because some angel is a huge dick, it never gets easier. He’d kind of hoped being prepared would count for something, but it’s still agonizing.
He’s not sure if he envies this version of himself or not, all things considered-- he thinks he’s done okay with the lot that he was handed. But he wishes Dean had gotten to be this Dean. The Dean who slept with his head in Mary’s lap in the front of the Impala at age four, parked outside a rest stop, Led Zeppelin for a lullaby. The Dean who took over making the sandwiches for all three of them because they weren’t being parented, but at least in this world he had a mother who would absently pat at his head and tell him he’d done good. Call him the man of the house, even if the house was a motel room, then put the baby in his arms and go out hunting, and…
He should act like this is unexpected, he should demand answers, attack, something… but instead he just stares.
, the fight had been rougher than Sam was going in expecting it to be, he can’t deny Cas was a big help, he just…
Sam heads up to his room, thinking warmly of his own world’s Jack, how eager he’d been to win Dean’s approval… he’d like to know that in this other world, he won it, too. That they all chose him just as sure as they all chose each other. Maybe if he ever tells this story…
“We got jack squat on that, but it sounds like there’s maybe a dozen of those suckers.” She takes the map from him with a nod, and hands over a paper sack with BURGERVILLE printed on the side. “Good work. We’ll hit ‘em hard and get out fast.”
“I’ll be fine, I’ll be-- I’m good.” Sam promises, though he glares at a billboard with GOD SAVES spraypainted across its faded and peeling facade. He picks up a rock and chucks it, though he misses the billboard.
And then, not Dean anymore. “We won’t be discovered here. We can find a motel room for the two of you, for the time being. Dean and I will go back for the car when the coast is clear.”
. Leaning on Cas and laughing around a mouthful of nacho, making the occasional silent offer until Cas gives in and puts one in her mouth and chews and swallows, looking supremely unimpressed.
“What?” Sam stumbles along after him, back across the room to Adam. “Hey, don’t touch him, he’s not--”
, for one. That’s a big frigging concern. Figuring out where he is is another-- the best he can come up with is ‘under a recent meteor strike’. It’s like the freaking Tunguska blast happened when--
“Yes. It is. It’s what he always does, it doesn’t matter if we need him, it doesn’t matter if we even-- if there’s no one else who could-- You know, he… he’s a rolling stone, and-- So why should this time be different?”
on Dean, in a way he’d never thought about before. The middle ground between fed suit and grease-or-blood-stained denim and flannel is just…
In the morning, there’s a plastic bathtub on the map table, Dean perched beside it reading out loud from a book that’s definitely not baby-appropriate, but not child-
“Mm, no, that’s-- that’s good. Sam was, uh, Sam was just standing, that age, had to hold on to stuff. Couldn’t really walk even if I held him up-- but then, you know. I was four, and that kid grew like a weed, so… first couple months of trying to teach him to walk I ended up on my ass often as not. Jack’s a little too young to worry about that. Just… wanna make sure he’s, um… developing normally. Normal kid. No freaky stuff.”
He takes a step closer, staring Adam down, energy crackling around him. Sparks erupting somewhere, but not enough to illuminate much of the space they’re in.
“Yeah, that makes sense, I’ll ask him. The one he never answers the phone for. Not the guy he dropped god like a bad habit for.”
“What?” Dean spreads one arm out. “Everything else is factory restored, except for the… magical mystery surgery. It’s not that crazy a leap.”
If the research he does mostly involves bathroom mirrors, nudity, and the magic of multiple orgasms, that is nobody’s business but his own. Also the fifteen minutes solely devoted to rubbing his legs together like a cricket because they’re just so damn
“Here.” He whispers, and he’s just about to point out his lips, just about to put it all out there and hope Cas picks up on it, caution to the wind, he’s just about to fucking ask when--
“Yeah. Yeah, they do that.” Sam nods. “Someday he’ll be almost as tall as you. I mean, I bet. I mean, right? Savor these precious moments, you never know when he’ll be walking and talking and… yeah. Well hey, come on in. You’re just in time to do, um… holiday stuff.”
Cas sits on the edge of the bed, his hand rests over Dean’s midsection, rising and falling with his breaths. “I could have done more. I could have done a little more. I was afraid… I was afraid that if it was too much at once, he might still need me, and I would be too weak to do more. That we could both be entirely reliant on you. As it is…”
The reel is less new information and more a reminder of where they once were-- this is when they were heading to Van Nuys, with Cas, before… Before Michael got Adam, before Cas got knocked down to human that first time. He winds up in the car, in the middle of mediating an argument about whether or not Dean is going to screw them all over by saying yes.
“He walked out because he thought he failed us, he thought we wouldn’t want him without his powers, why do you think that is?”
“We’re gonna pull through this. He’s going to do what’s right. And… look, maybe we won’t win everything we want to and maybe there are going to be sacrifices and losses, but-- But it’s going to come out okay, I have
“I-- I don’t know. Sometimes.” He shrugs, uncomfortable with the accusation lurking in those words. Maybe in this universe he doesn’t. Maybe he doesn’t want to.
This is the first time someone’s mentioned it, although he guesses there’s nothing subtle about totally failing to recognize someone you know.
He reaches down and puts the piece back where it was. Dean smells like leather, and peppermint soap. Like coffee and clean flannel. Like skin, warm. Tempting.
And then Sam’s there, in a motel room like a million others, meeting Cas for the very first time. Not the way he first met him, in the real world, his world. He wakes up and Cas is just
“No, it’s good. I just…” Dean smothers his face into Cas’ shoulder, before he can finish the thought. That he wishes he could still see it, feel it raised and shiny. That it isn’t fair that Cas can, when he can’t. He can’t see his own ribs, either, but it feels like a potentially weird complaint to make, all things considered.
And maybe none of it is such a huge difference in the grand scheme of things, maybe Sam came through about the same, but Dean… for him, it was different. Maybe not much, but enough. The Dean he sees in the sped-through version of their lives, in the brief clips he sees at regular speed and the moments a hair’s breadth off from what he remembers, that Dean seems less guarded-- well, he’s guarded, in terms of being a hunter, and it’s not like he’s any more prone to chick flick moments, but there’s something about him that’s lighter and more honest.
