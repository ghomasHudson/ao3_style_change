“It looks like there are a lot of people. Let me know if you ever feel overwhelmed, okay Jack?” He turned in his seat and saw his son scrambling to get out of the booster. He knew that the words for more for him than anyone else.
He shook her hand as firmly and gave her a polite smile. “Castiel Novak, my child is named Jack.”
“Please. Need any help.”
“Thanks.” Alfie is not shy. He immediately peels off his red and white striped uniform shirt, exchanging it for the long sleeve. Castiel bites his lip to his keep sounds from escaping because he looks so
“The best.” Alfie pressed a sweet kiss to his lip. “Oh! Just one second.” He walked away and came back with a small bundle. “Not the best at wrapping.”
Castiel didn’t make him finish. Instead, he grabbed a paper towel and handed Dean two of the cookies. He promised he would pay him for the time he spent today evaluating the roof. Dean told him he would call him with an estimate and a time frame. Even if he wanted to call Castiel for entirely unprofessional reasons.
Castiel did not respond. He put down his pen and went to his email. Sam sighed and got up to walk out. At the last minute he called out: “I will accept your invitation. Please tell Ellen that I will be making a pie.”
Castiel is practically exhausted by the time the car is loaded up and the children are strapped into their seats into the Prius. He supposed Jody was right, having another adult on his side would be a good thing.
“Normally I would be more than happy to lend a sympathetic ear, but you are right.” He dumped the sugar packets in his coffee and stirred it up.
“Cas, I know it kind of came off as a joke, but I am genuinely curious. You can’t keep this woman under lock and key forever. With a few candy bars and brownies Jack will sing like a canary.”
“Daddy, let’s go!”
Dean did. When it seemed like they were going to drive until they ran out of road, Dean pulled into a small pullout on the edge of a cliff. The cold, angry water whipped down below. Without a warning, Dean slid across the bench seat and put an arm around his shoulder. “I like to come out here and think. Sam and I used to come out with a cooler full of beers and just watch the ocean.”
Dean followed him through the house, no longer as worried at having to face the man’s wrath for his work boots tracking in dirt. Honestly, he was surprised to see the little boy perched on a bar stool in the kitchen. “Where’s the rest of them?”
“Sure you want to do that little bro? You should be nice to me.”
“Doubt that, but thanks for the ego boost.” Dean’s hand went to Castiel’s back, rubbing a small circle in center.
Castiel finished taking a bit of his sandwich before setting it down. “I wish you wouldn’t bribe my son.”
“I could care less as long as I am not the one consuming it,” he joked, following her with the leftovers in the kitchen. “Are the kids upstairs?”
“I give you free babysitting. You should be grateful.”
“Aunt Anna picks me up!”
“Semantics. Give me all the details. How did you meet? What is she like? How’s the sex? Has Jack met her?”
“It’s mainly for Jack’s benefit…” He looked at the items on the counter, landing on the American cheese. “And after eight years in the army you appreciate healthy, home cooked meals.”
“I liked the pie better,” he replied as he followed the check and slid it in his pocket. “Thanks again for dinner, I should really be heading out.”
“No. I can finish.” The words came out with great effort. “The hospital called the local law school clinic to send someone to draft a will. She said if anything happened that I was to raise Jack.” He laughed. It was full of bitterness, an odd sound that he forced out. “Because for some reason she looked at me and thought I would be a good father.” Castiel looked out distantly. “At that point I was three months stateside struggling to become a civilian again. Drinking heavily, begrudgingly going to therapy, working a dead-end job in grocery store.”
me.” He knew the sarcasm dripping from the word was uncalled for. She seemed like a sweet woman, but that hit a nerve.
“Army.”
“I’m going to be in first grade in September.”
“No.” His voice is firm as he sits up a bit straighter causing Dean to drop his arm. “Well first of all you should know that I’m not Jack’s biological father.”
“Why not?” Claire asked.
“He’s met Jack?” Gabriel’s eyes widened when a nod was given, he let out a low whistle. “Well, I’m glad for you little bro. You always put Jack first. I’m glad that you finally started dating someone.”
Castiel did say that. He had finally upgraded from his well-loved Lincoln Continental to a brand-new Prius. “As long as you promise to be careful.” Castiel doesn’t quite care right now. He practically runs down the stairs and finds a granola bar and banana for Jack. After he checks his backpack, they are off in the car.
“Need me to fix something else?” Dean joked when the man came back.
“Claire is a sweet child.” He looked out of the window to the backyard where Jack had bolted. Claire was currently engaged in imaginative battle with some sort of monster. He only hoped that her descriptions wouldn’t be
“Then why did you end up here?”
“You don’t have to tell him everything, not right away. Dean has his own secrets and I’m guessing he’ll have a much harder time than you,” Jody finally said as she gathered the trash off her desk.
“I haven’t had a ten o’clock curfew since—I never had one. Are you sure?” He leaned back into Castiel’s space, pressing a kiss on his jaw and working his way down his neck.
Almost two hours later, Castiel heard the now familiar rumble of Dean’s Impala. He parked it next to his Prius and got out of his car with several grocery bags. “Burgers were requested not a weekly shopping trip,” Castiel teased as he let him in the house.
“Gabriel…”
“I haven’t had an apple pie life. Didn’t know if I would ever want one.” Dean shrugged and then crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the counter, his hips dangerously close to Castiel. “But I don’t mind it.” A hand went to Castiel’s lower back as Dean leaned in. “And I would be stupid to not give you a try because of Jack.”
“What do you mean finally?” The secrecy had been burdening him for some time. He was taken aback to have the information so hard to give, taken so lightly. This was something he had worried about telling his family, afraid of a reaction like Luke's even though every ounce of common sense within him told him they would be more accepting. With Jody and Sam it just came out naturally, it didn’t feel like he was coming out. They never made a big deal out of it either.
“Hey, don’t stress little bro. It’s one night and you’re taking him home now.”
Castiel nodded and held it out to her. There was no passcode so she opened up his camera app. “What are you doing?”
“I believe in being an active parent. I’ve already signed up for room parent next week and am looking forward to the upcoming PTA meetings.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I made it.” Alfie twined it around his neck and pulled him close.
“The kids have all met him before, and I trust Dean. I’ve known him for a long time.” Jody shrugged. “It’s up to you. I know part of me is just being a mother hen.”
“A handyman…” Gabriel waggled his eyebrows. “Is he cute?”
“I already paid Benny for everything. Do you want to go out to a lookout in my car? If you still have time.”
“After you told me the roof needed replaced, I asked my brother for some advice—he works in real estate. He told me an approximate cost for how much the contractor he works with charges his clients and yours was significantly less. It seemed as if giving you a tip for the difference may be an insult since you were so kind, so I made a pie.”
“Right. I will try to keep the children out of your hair. Feel free to come inside to use the bathroom or get water.”
“Hey, Alex! Make sure Claire doesn’t climb on the Lion fence.”
“Is that a question?” Dean rolled his eyes. “Of course, Charlie’s my friend after all. I think you met her at the barbeque, bright red hair.”
So, they decorate cookies. Or Alfie does. Castiel is more practical in his decoration, more concerned with the ratio of frosting to cookie. Alfie is delighted by the fact that Castiel has loads of uncolored frosting and little vials of food dye. Every cookie is made with care. The Santa cookies with a red hat, pink dots on cheeks, and white beard. The reindeer has green sprinkles for eyes and a red smudge of frosting on the nose. Each Christmas tree has a unique string of frosting garland and sprinkle ornaments. Castiel could watch him do this for hours.
“Why? It’s my blanket.”
“We picked them ourselves,” Jack added.
“They can be a handful, and I don’t want you to get stressed out.”
“Yeah, it can be a lot. I saw you talking with Andrea. She’s real nice, but gets friendly pretty quick. Probably started a lot of questions about Jack?”
“Just gave you the family discount,” Dean replied slowly.
“You know I covered for Ellen at the Roadhouse last night. Everyone was asking me where Dean was. Unless you changed your hunting ground you haven’t even had a one-night stand—”
“Who is this Castiel? Dean’s practically blushing.”
“Okay.” A wide smile is spread across his face. “Is eating on the couch okay or is Mr. Manners going to insist on the table?”
“Cas? I didn’t expect to hear from you so soon.”
Castiel slowly followed him out, but Dean charged ahead to where his brother stood. He watched them interact playfully before he waved to Jack so he could help him plate up. As he stood around the table gathering food, he saw Jody come up behind him.
“Castiel.” He shook both of their hands in turn. “My son Jack is currently being occupied by Charlie or I would introduce him as well.” He paused only because Eileen came back with a beer for everyone. When she held one out to him, he shook his head. Jo said nothing, but quickly pulled it towards herself with a cheeky smile.
“Daddy says that cheese is only a few chemicals away from plastic.” He pointed at the blue and yellow package of American cheese. “Bacon
“Sure, Cas…”
Dean wondered where the hell Sammy found the guy. “I actually have, fun game.”
Castiel clenched his hand tightly around the pen. He was tired of people trying to set him up. It’d largely stopped once he spoke with Jody, but his brother—Gabriel—was on his case about it.  Now, Sam was doing it too. “I’m not really looking for anyone right now.”
Jody sighed again. She had looked so tired before, but now there was almost a look of pity crossing her face. “Cas I couldn’t ask you to do that. The kids are such a handful—”
Jody laughed, and leaned in closely. “You got a few minutes to talk?”
“That’s it? No board games? No movies? No snacks?”
“Couch is perfect.” Castiel gave him another kiss before he went to his bedroom. Most of his clothes are not meant for lounging, so he grabs one of his flannel pajama pants and a long sleeve with ARMY emblazoned on the front. In the living room, Alfie has made himself at home. His back pack is resting beside the couch, and jacket hanging on the hook beside the door. The food is spread out and he grabbed condiments from the fridge. One thing that catches his eye is a bottle of amber colored liquid. “Here you go.”
Another less serious note, is that I've never really set the exact years this takes place. Basically present day is in 2020/1 (minus Covid-19). This is important for some of the timing that comes up later. Their is a flashback contained in the chapter that just states 14 years ago, this is approximately 2006 and Castiel's Sophomore year of college.
Dinner Friday night had been a bit early, but at least Jody was there to help him cook. Even though she wanted to help clean up, he ordered her to go home and sleep, sending her on her way with a container full of leftovers. That was just after six, which meant he had to last two hours with the children.
“He can stay here,” Charlie said softly.
He tried to push the last thought out of his head as he put the pots and pans in the drying rack. Water had spilled everywhere and he looked around for a towel, but Castiel had said he was washing the towels as grease had spilled all over them when he was cooking. He felt uncomfortable digging around, so he went upstairs to ask.
“What? No, just the roof is fine…” He stopped and tilted his head. “Oh, you meant that. The children are insisting that the floor is lava. Have you heard of such a thing?”
“Listen, I’m not one for emotions or chick flick moments, but let me just say that I get it Cas.” Dean sighed and pushed his empty plate away. “My dad was a Marine. My mom she was…” Dean just smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His eyes looked as though they may well with tears any minute. “She got him. Knew exactly what to say or do. She died when I was 4 and then I became the one that had to help my dad.”
Dean pulled away quickly, turning around to lean against the counter. A smile crossed Castiel’s face as he turned around. “Fifteen more minutes and then we’ll have food.” He looked to the egg carton he pulled out and began to crack it into a bowl.
“Don’t tell Benny that.”
“Dean Winchester?” she whispered with a smile on her face. When he whipped around to scowl at her she held her hands up in surrender. “I promise to stay out of it, but I approve.”
“Thank you, Jack, it is very nice of you to say.” Jody looked at her daughter who stuck her tongue out at her friend as soon as Castiel wasn’t looking. “Claire do you like dinner?”
Castiel got out of the car and led Jack by the hand. As he neared the front door, the emotions he felt were strange. How weird it felt to leave Jack with perfect strangers. Everyone had told him the child would benefit from starting preschool so soon, but Castiel had never left him with anyone that wasn’t family. Thankfully he was not the only teary-eyed guardian there as it was only kindergarten and preschool coming today.
“I didn’t mean to.” Castiel leaned forward on the seat, grabbing at Dean’s arm. Though he barely tugged Dean came right back to him as they kissed once more. “We should go back to my car, it’s bit of a drive.”
“It’s good your excited, but they will eat you alive. Don’t seem too over eager even if you’re excited.”
“Huh, no offense Eileen but Sam’s work friends are usually dorks.” She elbowed the woman as she leaned forward. “What branch?”
Dean let out a laugh. “I guess Charlie is starting the kids early with the LARPing.”
“Anything. What grade are you in kid?”
. It’s written in the neat handwriting with his number to follow. For some reason Castiel can’t help but hope that Dean will be something like Sam.
“Of course, the only hurdle will be coordinating our schedules.” He looked down at his watch. “I should really be going if I want to be on time.” After getting up he waited to give Jody a hug before heading out.
“These things come up; I understand. It was nice of you to offer though.”
“Did Sam not tell you we met at the resource center?”
The officers exchanged looks. Castiel briefly wondered if he was not acting the way they expected. He had held himself together when he had lost men before, and he was not about to cry over his brother in front of these strangers. Perhaps if it was Gabriel, but not over Luke. There was a reason he had been nicknamed Lucifer.
“It’s why I asked him out.”
“Nah, I forget my bag downstairs.”
Dean drank down the rest of his hot chocolate too, and watched for Castiel to finish his. “Come here.” He pulled Castiel close, an arm around him. “Why don’t we watch a movie now, it’s not too late.”
“Why don’t we pour another drink and sit in front of the fire? I’m getting cold again.”
“Dad?” Jack moved closer; the girls were frozen in the living room next to each other.
He smiled that response. Surprisingly Gabriel was the best at grounding him if anything ever happened. The two of them were the closest out of any of his siblings. He was so familiar and distinctly home in his mind that he was able to bring him back from even the worst episodes.  As he scrubbed up the sauce and saw that though the knife and cutting board fell in, it was fine. He looked to the side of the cabinet and saw Dean’s card. After the glass was cleaned up, he reached for his phone, and clicked on Dean's name.
“There are baby books you can read, we all will be happy to help you, we all know you can afford a better place. I’m not touching the therapy because we all know you need it.”
“I come bearing gifts. Two boxes of cookies, one for the veterans and one for the staff and lunch for us.” He grinned widely as he held up the paper bag.
“It wasn’t his fault,” Jack explained, “It’s like what happened when he hears fireworks.”
“Cas I am fine. This is my last drink anyway and I’m used to sleeping on Charlie’s couch.”
Dinner is an uncomplicated pasta dish with zucchini, tomatoes, onions, parmesan cheese and a squirt of lemon. This he pairs with a crusty loaf of French bread that he picked up on his lunch break. The table is set and the food is out by the time Dean comes in. He took his coveralls off, but there are still splatters of paint that probably will only come off after a nice hot shower.
“I didn’t mean to bring all this shit up. It just never seemed right, and you never told me so I didn’t know if it was a secret.”
“Are you like an accountant or something?” She narrowed her eyes as she looked him over. Most everyone was in shorts and t-shirts. He had worn a pair of khaki’s and a short sleeve button down not knowing how informal it would be.
“Fuck, that’s…” Dean shook his head as he walked over to place the cutting board next to the sink, presumably to put the lettuce. “At least she was honest with you.” His tone was more serious, mouth set straight. “It hurts, but sometimes you just have to walk away to keep the people you love safe.”
“Castiel,” Sam explained to his girlfriend. “Dean fixed his roof.”
“My classic bacon cheese smash burgers,” he responded.
After placing the pie on the counter, he grabbed the two six packs from the fridge and walked outside. Ellen and Bobby are arguing over the grill. He dropped the beer on the picnic table.
“Let’s get these burgers started before it gets too late.
“You and me buddy,” he muttered to Jack.
“Here is the check,” Castiel slid a check across the counter, but he also set a pie down in front of him. “I asked Sam. He said that pie was your favorite.”
By the time he arrives at the resource center he ends up being five minutes early and found out that his first appointment of the day canceled. He lets himself take a deep breath as he goes out front to grab a cup of coffee.
“Is this an alright Christmas present?”
“Are you sure? My house is fairly far out—”
“I only have the one son,” Castiel replied as he pulled his checkbook out of the drawer.
Dean then picked up the plates, not listening to a word of argument from Castiel. Once dinner is picked up, Dean borrowed a book from his bookshelf and watched the kids outside while Castiel took a shower. By the time he came back down they are all on the living room floor playing with some of Jack’s toys. Dean was still reading. He stayed until the kids started to get sleepy and made his way to leave as they went in their separate direction to prepare for bed.
It’s Dean that ended up contacting Castiel. He received the text message during staff meeting. Typically, the only person that would text him during the day would be one of his siblings contacting him about Jack. His coworkers knew this and don’t bat an eye when he briefly opened the phone he kept flat on the table.
He reached out to the other side of the bed and briefly wondered how different his insomniac spells would be with someone beside him. If they would be different at all. In that moment he knew if he was truly ready to find someone, he would have to share his life. While it sounded terrifying, he knew that’s what he thought five years ago when Jack was placed in his arms.
Note: There are mentions of homophobia in this chapter, I will put details in the note below if you would like to skip but it does contain spoilers.
“Your brother Luke Novak and his partner, Kelly Kline, were involved in a car accident early tonight. Luke was dead on arrival and Kelly had been transported to Sacred Heart Hospital.” The words came out blunt and emotionless. He knew when you informed someone of a death you had to use concrete language. This was a conversation that he had unfortunately had to have a few times over the years that he was deployed.
“I don’t think it will be that late.”
After that they were refocused on finishing their food. Jody was in charge of ice cream as he cleaned off the table. By the time he was pouring food in Tupperware containers she sighed as she leaned against the counter. “You distracted them for a while.”
“Gabriel, what are you doing here?”
“Can I?”
“Exactly. Alex should know where things are.”
Come Friday, Castiel left work late. Partly because Jack is with Gabriel for the night and he had no motivation to get off early; and partly because it is his first with his new client. Fergus Crowley. An army veteran that spoke with a slight accent that he said came from his Scottish mother.
“That’s why I came.”
He didn't respond. Instead, he flipped his phone over and attempted to concentrate on the monthly goals that are being laid out for them. He didn't look at his phone until after lunch when he received a text from his brother.
“They are appreciated. Make yourself at home.” She looked at Jack again. “Charlie is going to start some games with the kids if you want to join.”
“Come on in.” He doesn’t say anything about Dean talking off his work boots, which he finds strange. The entire house is immaculate. Even with having three children running around any clutter could be picked up in five minutes. “I am in the middle of baking cookies. A bribe for the children I am afraid.”
anyone even after I left.”
“And protective and loyal and caring…” Castiel said. “You know the only reason she got into that fight was because of Jack.” As he watched the child play it was clear that he had not inherited any of the traits of Luke. Luke had a quick temper, and an even quicker tongue. Jack was quiet and gentle, sometime misinterpreted as being shy.
Dean cut off Castiel’s words with a kiss. One hand kept on the back of the neck to hold him close. “I know we probably shouldn’t do much with Jack next door, but would something like that would be alright?”
“But you seemed so mad,” Claire said.
“Can I help?”
From now on assume everything is in the present. Additionally, most everything is from Castiel's perspective, but there is going to be some from Dean's perspective starting in this chapter.
“I will accept your apology for the accident, but you need to know that you’re not responsible for how I reacted. I’m sorry if I scared you.” The girls seemed to relax a bit. “Do you want me to call your mom?”
“Love, I think…” Benny started to rub her shoulder as he saw the look on Castiel’s face.
“I don’t understand.”
family. Come on, I need to check him out. Make sure he’s alright for you.”
Castiel did not say anything but narrowed his eyes and set the potatoes on the counter. “I will get the children to wash up. That will be the more difficult task compared to what needs to be finished.”
Castiel tells Dean about how he came to adopt Jack, briefly discusses Kelly's passing. It is all inside "Dean's Perspective" section.
“Daddy?” Jack asked. He’s dressed himself in a striped shirt and shorts that have little lobsters embroidered all over them. He looks horrendous, but he doesn’t have time to care.
“Could you watch Jack for me on Friday night?” The words just came out. “Not all night and not too late, I think we’re playing board games.”
“Cassie! I was wondering when you were going to show.”
The words of Kelly haunted him nearly every day,
“Yes, are they causing trouble?” Castiel sat up a bit straighter, eyes surveying the children. All three were in sight along with another little girl who Alex appeared to be chattering with.
Castiel had to bite back a laugh as he gave his sister a hug goodbye. He and Dean had agreed upon Benny’s food cart because to Dean it was a crime to not have tried his cooking. Anna lived surprisingly close so he waited in his car for some time. Honestly, he couldn’t have been more nervous for a first date. Never mind that this had been the first one in literal years, and it was the first
“You do. That whole speech that you give your clients about how you’ll be there for them even when they slip up. The disappointed look you give, but you always tell them it’s alright. Honestly you should hold a workshop on it.” She gave him a smirk. “You think you can work him in.”
“Cas, you going to stay in the car all night?” Dean leaned against his car, head peeking through his open window.
“Corn is my favorite food,” he said to Dean.
“You’re going to make it, Kelly.”
“Yeah, thanks.” Dean downed the water, trying not to look at the man in front of him. “Listen, I’m mainly just a handyman. You are going to need a whole new roof. I have some guys I know that would be more than happy to help do it. It’ll just cost a little more.”
please stay.”
“I don’t want to ruin the night and it’s nothing.”
“You know Eileen, and that’s Jo, Ellen’s daughter. Just hang out. We’re going to eat in about a half an hour.”
Castiel walked into the group meeting where only a handful of people had arrived. He hated bringing Jack to these but it was more a support group than therapy. No one was bothered by it, but sometimes he worried about the things that Jack would overhear. All of these men had served in combat roles, had seen the worsts that war had to offer. Most everything now was about adjusting to this life.
He looked around. It’s mainly clutter: stacks of books, shoes, a pile of unfolded clean laundry. “You all promised to help me.”
“Thank you, but…” Dean will never turn down a pie, especially not one that looks like this. There’s a lattice work of crust and it’s sprinkled with sugar, pieces of cinnamon apple peek out.
“Well, if you don’t start talking soon Anna’s going to blab to Michael or mom.”
Castiel looked up to see Meg in the doorway. The two of them are not as awkward anymore and Meg has obviously come to speak about work, indicated by the file folder in her hand. “Just a little horrified.” He held out his phone to show the picture of Jack.
“You can. I don’t think my cholesterol levels could handle it.” Castiel took the final bite on his plate, then met Dean’s eyes. “However, one time one hurt me.” He got to his feet and looked at the table. “If you are done, I will take your plates.”
“Don’t mention it.” Dean turned to walk to his truck and Castiel reached for his arm. “Need something?”
“Grab a table, I’ll let them know we’re here. Want something to drink?”
“I thought as much, why didn’t you wake me?”
“Do not turn this around on me Gabriel.”
“Jack?” he asked as he eyes rested on her swollen stomach. How big it had grown since he last saw her only a few weeks ago.
“What do you mean Anna is going to blab?”
“No, I’ll go just give me a few minutes to change.”
The first date had gone better than expected. Much better than expected. He could not begin to describe how excited he was to get alone time with Dean again. Yet, here he was sitting in Jody’s office on his lunchbreak.
“And lady, I don’t know what you thought but the two of us are together.” Dean put an arm around Castiel’s shoulder, and then gave her his best charming smile.
After he grabs some glasses with ice, they sit next to each other on the couch. It’s the start to what should be the perfect evening as they laugh and drink probably a bit too much of the cheap whiskey. The food is devoured, and much appreciated. Alfie gets a steep discount so they are stuffed full of fries and burgers and other various heart disease inducing sides. “I think you promised me cookies.”
“Coffee is terrible, but at least it’s free.” Jody set a mug of coffee on her desk along with a few packets of sugar.
“Oh, I got off work, and I thought I would have lunch with my favorite brother.”
“Is that so bad?”
“I feel as though I always cast a cloud on our dates. I don’t know if I feel like a movie now.”
“Are you doing alright? The two of us haven’t gotten a chance to talk. After what happened when the girls spent the night, I thought you’d be upset.” She took a bite of the sandwich, looking him over. To anyone else it would seem innocent, but Jody was good at picking up any minimal body language. “I would be pissed if Jack broke my window. I am paying for it.”
“I know, it’s just hard.” She watched as Alex tried to kick a soccer ball around the back yard only to be blocked by Claire as she gestured around. Jack was the one that stepped between the two of them and handed the soccer ball back to Alex. “Does Jack like peas?” Not even hiding the fact she was trying to change the subject.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean muttered. “That killed my boner.”
“One of my windows was broken and I have no idea what to do. I don’t have plywood and—”
“I am not going on date with Donna.”
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. He can’t find the words to express what’s on his mind.
“Yes, it is
He walked over to the picnic table. “Eileen and Jo here together, am I dreaming?”
Castiel ignored him and continued: “He also painted my house, and was nice enough to work on the weekend when Claire and Alex broke my window.” He shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what you want to know. He is a kind man that is very understanding, and has a good sense of humor. He is not bothered by Jack. In fact, when you cancelled, he volunteered to come over and cook us dinner.”
“Hey, it’s no one’s fault. It was an accident and I could have done the same thing if I was out there with all of you.”
“Did you guys have a fun sleepover?”
“Yes, but… They don’t want me solely responsible for cleaning up Lucifer’s mess alone.”
The night was still young, dusk hadn’t even settled yet. Castiel suspected that Dean wanted him to go for a ride to show off his car, his Baby as he had called it. It was a sleek Black Impala that had clearly been restored with a lot of love. “Now this is a car, not that sorry excuse that you drive.”
“Hello Dean.”
“I didn’t even know you then,” Jody responded. “What are you even looking for?”
“Thank you.” He was busy unpacking a reusable grocery bag. Jody watched carefully as he laid down sandwiches, carrot sticks, and cookies down on the desk. “I hope you don’t mind; I made our food when I packed Jack’s lunch. However, he got apple slices instead of carrots and cheddar instead of pepper jack on the sandwich.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good, my favorite.” He smirked. “We have butterflies and birds after lunch, then some of the indoor exhibits if you want to see them.” Castiel was taking a bite of the sandwich as he thumbed through the brochures. The kids looked a little disappointed as they sat their eating their food. “But we can spend a lot of time here so you can climb on the play structures.”
Castiel blinked slowly. “I…”
“Do you require something Mr. Winchester?” Castiel questioned.
“Family’s not just blood. Sam thinks you’re a good guy and…” Dean looked at Jack with a smile on his face. “Sometimes people should cut good guys a break.”
“Cas, I’m not really the best person for this. I don’t exactly lead with the fact that I’m a widow on the first date, but I don’t usually get to the point where I talk about Sean with someone.”
When Castiel awoke the next morning, it was early like usual. Sleep had come easy, though, after he had told Dean everything. To his credit the man didn’t look at him with sympathy, just understanding. Beside him Dean was still sleeping soundly, covers wrapped around him tightly. Even after he took a shower, he was still undisturbed. He dug around in his nightstand to find pen and paper. Then he wrote:
“I tried dating. If you remember Meg.” He smiled fondly remembering the passionate, sharp-witted woman. The handful of dates they went on were some of the best he’d ever had, but there was something holding him back. Meg broke it off saying she was ready to settle down and that wasn’t fair to Jack.
“I will keep that in mind.” Castiel moved to pin the card on a bulletin board. A few moments passed before he turned around again. “I may need my house painted soon. Would that be something you could do?”
“It’s my apartment to,” he said. “And if you must know that bitch and I got into an argument so I took the first bus home.”
“Yes,” Jack said. Castiel was sure he saw an eye roll and he knew that was a habit that he picked up from Claire.
“The teacher approached me. I had yet to speak with Jack about it.”
Castiel saw a woman with short cropped hair wearing a police uniform holding out a tissue. “How can you tell?” He took it from her and dabbed at his eyes. There was little to wipe up but it was still a kind gesture.
“Need a hand?” he heard a man ask. The person next to him was not any of the other men he shared group with, but a stranger. He towered over Castiel not only in height, but he was broad shouldered as well. His inclination went towards distrust as he took in his suit and hair that hung loosely going nearly to his chin.
“He said he walked in on you with another man.” Gabriel shook his head. “I told him to fuck off, but he seemed giddy that he could turn you in to your ROTC leader.”
After he turned down the road and the lake house came into view, he realized that is not the case. The house was quaint two-story cabin painted bright white. There’s raised garden beds that appear to be growing vegetables and a swing set with a slide attached. He sees two cars: a shiny new Prius and rusted Lincoln Continental. For a moment he considered calling Sam to yell at him because he’s doing this friend a favor by working on a Saturday and he never works on the weekend. The last thing he wants is to see one of Sam’s stuck-up lawyer friends.
“You are my only sister.”
“Uh, yeah I did…” He reached for a beer and smashed it against the table to get the top off before taking a long drag. He recalled the kid mentioning Mrs. Mills. North Cove was small, so it wasn’t that weird that Castiel was friends with her.
Dean pressed a kiss to his temple. “Can I spend the night?”
The two of them sat on a blanket not far from the shore as they ate the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that Jack insisted on making. By now they were silent as they ate. Castiel finished his and wiped off his hands. “I wanted to talk to you about something.”
“Yes, and I will be at her place at 4:15 precisely.”
“It was my fault,” Alex said quickly. “I was the one throwing and it was too hard and…”
“I don’t think you know what a joke is.”
Castiel raised an eyebrow as he crossed his arms over his chest. He looked over his brother who looked like he rolled out of bed, but was most likely just in half of his work clothes. He wore grey linen pants and a white undershirt, dusting of flour still showing. Even though Gabriel was on the other side of the counter he could smell the sweet scent that clung to his clothes.
“Yeah. Good call on the paint, but being this close to the water will probably beat it up again.” Dean walked around to the back of his truck and secured things like the ladder and his tool box before slamming the tail gate shut. He stared at Castiel for a few moments and Castiel realized he was just staring at him.
Castiel’s good luck seemed to run out one muggy June day. The prior day it had been blistering hot, but now the sky was thick with dark clouds. He only hoped it wasn’t thunder, because no matter how many times Castiel reassured him and shown him documentaries on weather, it still terrified Jack. He didn’t even have to look outside to see if it was raining because he found a puddle in their upstairs hall.
“Are you Castiel Novak?”
Castiel held his phone as Jack posed in front of the apartment door. The small child took a lot of coaxing to get a smile on his serious face, but Castiel couldn’t resist. It was his first day of preschool and he looked so precious in his uniform. He wore navy pants with a pale blue button down underneath a red trimmed navy sweater.
“You said I wasn’t supposed to.”
“Cas, I didn’t really do anything.”
“Men?” Dean asked.
“Sorry, force of habit. My siblings and I’s nickname for him. My brother was not the most agreeable person. The details of which I may tell you at some point, but…”
The fire is still burning strong. Castiel pushed the coffee table out of the way and spread one of his blankets out before grabbing pillows to lean against. It’s like something out of a romantic movie. Although, he supposed those movies would have heterosexual leads and they would be drinking red wine instead of cheap whiskey.
Castiel hesitated, but Charlie grabbed his plate after storing the cookies in a container. When he drove to Gabriel’s place, his usually boisterous brother had told him to be quiet. On the couch Jack had fallen asleep, a fleece Scooby Doo blanket tossed over him. “I… I always put him to bed.”
“Reading. I can’t read good—”
Castiel frantically reached for clothes to hand Alfie. “Stop! Luke, please.”
Castiel looked down at the food and thought it would be better to eat something first. Goodness knows once he started talking, Gabriel wouldn’t let him stop until he finished. “First of all, you should know it’s not a
“I won’t hold it against you. My dad was a marine, Sam’s dad was too. It’s how we know each other.” She took a drink of her beer as she leaned back and studied him. “I guess I should have had you pegged as an army guy. All serious and stuff.”
“Do you have your phone on you?”
Castiel looked out the window above the sink. Jack was currently on the swing going high, he pumped his legs hard and then kicked them straight out like he was trying to touch the sky. “You sound like you’re speaking from experience.”
“I’m so sorry,” he muttered, wanting nothing more than to hold him close. Suddenly Castiel feels so very cold even with the fire burning hot. “Luke can you give us some fucking privacy?”
He knocked on the door again, but this time it is not Castiel but a girl that looked vaguely familiar instead. She couldn’t be more than seven with straight dark hair and brown eyes. She looked nothing like the man. “Can I talk with Mr. Novak?” Instead of saying anything she nodded and ran back inside the house. He saw two other children standing further back. They look to be the same age a little boy with neat brown hair and a little girl with wild blonde curls.
The apartment building wasn’t really an apartment building, but rather a complex with about ten apartments facing a breezeway. He climbed the stairs to apartment number five and only had to knock once before the door was swung open. Charlie stood there with a wide smile.
“Something on your mind.”
“Sam was trying to nudge me in your direction, but I resisted. Well, I did until you spoke with me at the barbeque. You weren’t judgmental and you didn’t feel sorry for me, you were just there. Just like you were their last weekend.”
Honestly, he swore his brother used Jack as an excuse to do all sorts of things that may be considered too childish for a man in his thirties. The photo came next: Jack with his hands covered in some thick purple sparkly substance. Castiel groaned at that, but knew better than to complain because Gabriel will try to give him a gallon sized bag full of the stuff.
“Peer support specialist…” He realized that he would have to do better as most did not know what that meant. “I help out veterans that are coming home, get them adjusted to civilian life again.”
“I get it. Wrong place for the convo. I’ll grab his bag. You grab your son. He’s getting heavy, would totally throw out my back…”
The man took Jack from him easily. He even smiled when he went to grab a fistful of his long hair that brushed against the collar of his shirt. “Sam Winchester.”
“The one that didn’t want to be around Jack. Oh, I remember.” To Gabriel that has to be the worst thing you could say about a person. His brother cherished Jack, to him the boy was an angel on earth. “You’ve never told me about liking men, and I’m oblivious to things like that. You should know that Luke told me.”
“We should try that sometime Daddy.”
“Perfect timing. Is water okay to drink?”
“You know part of the reason Jody and I got so close is because she wants them to have positive male role models. They aren’t around a lot of men, other than Jody’s deputies.” Castiel shrugged, but before he could say more, Dean called out:
They seemed to get the hint as he drank one beer fast, and then another. He hadn’t been shy with Sam about the fact he liked men just as much as women. Hell, even Ellen knew. She’d seen him take home guys from the Roadhouse before. Sam, though, had never set him up with a man. Especially not someone like Castiel. There was no way he’d be interested him. Someone like Castiel probably fit in with Sam’s nerd friends from the law firm. Just because he worked at the resource center didn’t mean he didn’t have some fancy degree. There’s no way he’d want to get with Dean. Not only that but he had a kid. Robin was the sexy musician and Cassie was no nonsense reporter.  Robin was nothing more than a fling, as much as he liked Cassie—hell, loved her—they both were on the same page when it came to settling down. Not for them, not yet. Both types of women that he could have fun with, no strings attached. Castiel didn’t seem like a no strings attached sort of guy. And Dean, he wasn’t ready, the last thing he wanted to do was screw things up with someone he could like, especially after Lisa.
It is his turn to be caught off guard. “Do it all the time. Especially if part of my pay comes in baked goods.” He laughed. “At least if your pie is half as good as the cookies you made me.”
“Have you had burgers, kid?” he questioned. “Like a cheeseburger fresh off the grill with bacon? That is my favorite food.”
“I’ve hit a dry spell too, it’s—”
Dean found himself standing in the butter yellow kitchen watching as the man poured him a glass of water from a frosty pitcher.
“I have a leak in my roof,” Castiel said as he dumped sugar into his coffee. “How does one even go about fixing that?”
“In a way, I’m his paternal uncle.  His father was Luke, if you recall I told you that he had passed.”
“It is awfully warm outside.”
“Keeping the peace between Bobby and Dean…” She pointed to the grill. “I’ll get us some beers and tell him you came.”
“Don’t call Kelly a bitch.”
my brother. He’s the one in my family I’m closest with.” Castiel shook his head, and paused when he saw he Jack freeze as a butterfly landed on his shoulder. “Besides if you meet him it’s only a matter of time before Anna hears about then she’ll tell my parents, and you’ll have to meet my entire family.”
“I already said yes, Cas. And the perk of being your own boss is I make my schedule, so let me know when you’re free.”
. Gabriel’s busy and I can’t leave Jack with Michael…” Currently Castiel was trying to put a diaper on a squirming Jack while the phone was between his ear and neck.
“I don’t know if I have tried that.”
“You need something, don’t you? You have a pensive look.”
“Dean.” He held out a hand for the kid to shake. Even though he was much smaller, Dean could tell he was trying to shake it firmly.
“Are you going to fix the window? It made Mr. Novak upset,” Claire questioned as she watched him with a careful.
Castiel couldn’t help but notice it was not Dean’s normal laugh. Usually his laugh was unguarded and came from deep inside his belly. When he laughed it reached his eyes, the most beautiful crinkles forming and the freckles on his nose almost seemed to dance. This was forced, and shallow. He hadn’t been with Dean that long, but it was as if there was more information that wasn’t being told.
“If you would just call me.”
“Do you want to go on a date sometime? Like somewhere not my house, without any kids?”
“You’re a guest,” Jack said as he came out of the kitchen to stare at the man. “Dean, right?”
Sam nodded and leaned back in his chair. “Listen, it doesn’t have to be
Castiel watched in amazement as Jack smiled at Dean and built his own dessert. Dean was quick to come up with all sorts of stories to tell the two of them. They were silly stories about his time growing up with his younger brother. Listening he realized that Jack was not an excuse for him. Granted he didn’t know Dean very well, but at the bare minimum he seemed to not hate children. In fact, he was much better with him than his own brother Michael. All that meant to him was that the decision was his.
“Yeah, like…”
There was a lot more to the story. Castiel could tell from the evasiveness of his gaze and the body language that show discomfort. “Did you ever go to college?”
Castiel sighed as he looked down at his son. His carefully planned schedule had been thrown off kilter with Gabriel’s spontaneous trip. Anna was a doctoral student and had the most flexible schedule of all his family. Well, except for his father, but he had gone to a cabin while he finished edits on his latest novel.
“What do you think about getting the house painted?” Castiel asked Jack, when he finished their discussion on pollination.
“We will leave soon.”
“He passed away.”
“Claire will probably pout, but it’s what I have on hand.” She set the beer down as she grabbed a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer. “So, tell me about this new place.”
“You don’t work weekends,” Eileen said.
There were a few food carts in an empty lot. They were surrounded in a semi-circle around tables, some covered, some in the open. In the center was a fire pit. “This is nice.”
Castiel almost interrupted, but when he turned around with a bowl of whisked eggs, he saw Dean cross the kitchen to ruffle his son’s hair and let out a deep, hearty laugh. The man then side tracked him by asking him to help set the table.
“Yeah, and it was Jack.” Dean held out his hand and shook it again. “Mighty nice to invite me for dinner.”
“A string of secret lovers?” Dean asked as he began to start cutting up the tomatoes.
“Jody, my siblings are already trying to locate the perfect spouse. It’s been their mission ever since Gabriel started dating Kali.”
“Yeah…”
“It happens to the best of us.” He came up beside Dean as he gently nudged him out of the way. “Can you handle coffee?”
Still, he tried to push these thoughts out of his head as he got the apartment ready. Alfie’s dorm kicked him out for winter break today, but he had a shift at the local fast-food joint. He promised to bring them dinner. Castiel had worked hard on desert. As a college student he couldn’t really afford much in the way of presents, but had been baking like crazy. Everyone seemed to appreciate homemade cookies, even if it did earn him a liberal amount of teasing from some of the guys in his ROTC class. Alfie, though, would appreciate getting to decorate Christmas cookies.
“I have it, thank you.” When he went to grab a napkin, he knocked over a tower of cups. “Perhaps, would you mind…?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have to be at work in thirty minutes. I permitted myself enough time to emotionally steady myself.” Castiel followed her as they walked to the parking lot. His car didn’t stick out quite as badly as the beige truck with North Cove Sheriff stenciled on it.
beef, Daddy says--”
“Cas, what’s wrong? I want you. Please hold me down, finger me, fuck me,” Alfie pleaded. From the look in his eyes it’s as if he thinks what Castiel is doing is a game.
“Luke and his girlfriend were involved in a car accident. It was just over five years ago.” Castiel stared straight ahead, his blue eyes seeming dark as the scanned the night sky. “Luke was pronounced dead at the scene. Kelly was taken to the hospital. I was close to her; I’d met her my freshman year of college. I stayed with her the whole night and…and I thought she would be alright.”
“Yeah, after you made him that pie, he’s mentioned you about three times, which for Dean is a lot.”
Castiel thought back to Dean saying that family isn’t blood, but still he replied: “I wouldn’t want to intrude but thank you for the invitation.”
“I am a private person. And if you must know I’ve been involved for almost two months.”
“Well sometimes grown-ups don’t think before they say something. But don’t you worry, I’m going to patch this up to make it safe. In a few days it will be good as new.” Dean gave her a wink as he pulled out safety glasses and gloves. “One time I was messing around with my brother and we dented our dad’s car. I’ve never seen him angrier.” He chuckled at the memory.
“Of course. It looks like drinks too.”
It was then he heard: “Mr. Novak I’m sorry!”  and “It was my fault!” and “Daddy.” Like a reflex he shouted: “Get down! Away from the window!” That was before his eyes landed on Jack. Suddenly he realized where he was and tried to regulate his breathing. After a few stable breaths, he then repeated quietly for himself: “I feel stressed because I am remembering when Balthazar was injured. But that is not what is happening. I am home. I am not in danger.”
After the door shut, Castiel wrapped him in his arms—rain be damned—despite the fact he was carrying to large bags of food and had a backpack. “The fireplace actually works. Sit in front of it while I grab you some dry clothes.”
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” Dean pulled the sandwiches from the Castiel’s backpack and handed them out.
“Luke?” Castiel practically dropped the spoon mid bite. His limbs froze, but his heart beat faster. It took a bit to stave off the awful memory from floating to the surface. “What did Luke tell you?”
Castiel hadn’t realized he had driven on almost auto-pilot to the Y. He got out and gave his son a hug. “I finished early; I hope you’re not too disappointed not to see your Uncle Gabe.”
“You drove baby Jack around in a Pimpmobile.” Dean put his hand on the back of the seat, fingers brushing against Castiel’s shoulder as he turned his head and put his arm on the seat to reverse the car. “And you still have that car?”
Once they were settled on the couch with Snickerdoodles he went back into the kitchen. He texted Jody to let her know what happened.
“God, yes, please…”
Dean set down his fork, and placed an elbow on the table as he leaned forward. “When you asked me out you said no kids. I’m going to hold you to that, probably because if I didn’t that would be the only thing you would talk about.”
“Come on, it wasn’t any different than what you did.”
“You need a recommendation?”
“No, but I made shortcake a couple days ago.”
He had no idea how long it had actually been when he went to the living room. Alex comforted her sister as Jack sat in the arm chair looking on with worried eyes. He pulled the coffee table closer so he could sit on the edge as he talked to the girls.
“Not unless you want to hear about the personal lives of the North Cove PD and how they are way too entwined with their professional lives.” She rolled her eyes. “Or you want to hear about the exciting results of children’s sports?”
Today it was quiet when he knocked on the door. Castiel answered, looking more relaxed even if he’s still dressed in business casual. The next thing he noticed is the warm smell of cinnamon in the air.
“I wasn’t ashamed, just fearful.” Castiel replied. “At that point I had my life all planned out and Luke had the power to rip it away.” Even though ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ was repealed during his service, he never was able to shake the feeling that it was dirty secret he had.
“You know my schedule. I’m sorry Cas. Can’t you just skip?”
Jack nodded quickly. “I liked her. She had foam swords and told us she was the Queen of the Moons and we were training to be knights.”
“He is Sam’s brother,” Castiel said plainly to his son.
“Her daughter Claire was in the same preschool class as my son.”
He turned and looked at Castiel, eyebrows furrowing.
“I think I would like Dean to come,” Castiel replied quietly. This just earns him a side hug from Jody before the pair sit down enjoying a few peaceful minutes before the children realized that he had arrived.
Castiel held his hand tightly as they went to the parking garage. He made sure Jack was secure in booster seat before slid into the driver’s side. The way there he had to force himself to keep his eyes on the road. As he pulled up to the Catholic school, he couldn’t help but feel out of place with his old Lincoln Continental among all the SUVs and hybrids. “Now before we go in do you know the plan?”
“I dunno. I don’t normally work weekends.” There was teasing in his voice, even Castiel could recognize that.
“A skill you pick up on an Army base,” he said. “I became quite good even if my men said that they let me win.”
“On paper I was good enough for the court. But I lived with my parents for six months, I had no clue how to care for a newborn. I don’t think I would have survived without them or my siblings.” He shrugged. “They helped me get a two-bedroom apartment here, and then about a year ago my parents insisted that I started putting down roots.”
Castiel wanted to say something more, but Jack pulled on his arm to ask a question. Though he had recoiled at Sam’s suggestion at first, maybe Dean wouldn’t be that bad.
“Dad, you should do it. I would get to see you
Jody smirked as poured the peas into a pan with a bit of water. She opened the oven letting out the wonderful smell of her roast chicken. “I am pretty handy myself if you need help.”
Castiel only answered with another kiss.
“Thought you’d never ask,” Dean teased. “I can’t do more than put up some plywood right now so this shouldn’t take me that long, but don’t wait for me.”
“I wasn’t alone, not really. I told you Dean came to fix the window.”
“I want to leave well enough alone, but when I looked at those pictures, I couldn’t help but wonder where Jack’s mom was.”
“Not at all.” Dean doesn’t leave, instead he grabbed a bottle of water for himself leaning against the counter. “How long has it been?”
Castiel fixed Dean with a look typically reserved for Claire’s sass. “We will agree to disagree. Now, let’s try to wrangle the children. I am very interested in the butterfly exhibit even if the children seem to be in opposition.” Castiel got off the bench before Dean can reach for him. As he goes to speak with the children, he looked at Dean. He’s packing up everything back into Castiel’s back pack. A part of him knew it was not right to criticize Dean’s actions. They weren’t that bad. He knew the real criticism came from the fact that this was unknown territory for him. Dean—the man who never wanted to talk about “feelings and shit”—certainly enjoyed physical contact. He had no care in the world as he held hands or casually touched Castiel’s back or arm. It was the approach of a man that had no shame or fear.
“Just bring him.”
“Let me walk you out.” Castiel followed Dean outside to work truck. He considered what he wanted to say but instead settled on: “You did a good job with the painting.”
Before Castiel got a chance to respond two other people walked up to the couple. A blonde, broad-shoulder man and small woman next to him. “Darling, I didn’t know you would be here.”
“Perhaps, but at least he gets to spend more time with you.”
“Good night,” he answered in reply.
It clicked into place for Castiel then. He had always known that Jody tried to fiercely protect the ones that she loved. He hadn’t known the Jody
Castiel tried not to curse again as he mopped the water with a cloth and put the biggest bucket he could find under the leak. “Can you eat in the car?”
“I like him. Dean should take notes.” Gilda got to her feet and took the plate of cookies from him and set it on the table. “Now how do you know Dean?”
“Nothing bad. I just want to know how you would feel if I started seeing someone.”
“He volunteers at the resource center where I work.”
“Alone from me?” Jack frowned as went to sit down Castiel’s bed. It was humorous as he sat at the edge, his feet dangling due to the height.
Mention of Dean drinking that worries Castiel.
“That was my plan.” He finished the task at hand as Jody scooped their ice cream into bowls. “I apologize if I’m not very personable tonight.”
“I had to drop off some paperwork for one of the guys.” He sat in his chair, looking wholly uncomfortable as he wiped his palms on his pants.  “And I wanted to talk with you since you’re not great with texts.”
Castiel just shook his head as he looked around where Dean was driving. He was heading toward the state park that was nearby. “It’s not easy to talk about. Forget I said anything.”
“Leave!” Castiel shouted, he threw the shirt at Alfie, but didn’t know he was the only thing blocking Luke’s view.
“You’re having a sleepover too?”
“It’s pretty late, aren’t you tired?”
“Do I have a choice?”
“What about breakfast?”
“How noble.” Castiel set the coffee down and slid the business card into his front pocket. “I apologize if that sounded sarcastic. My brother says my statements often come off as sarcastic.” He looked at the clock on the wall. “I am sure that I will see you around if you continue to come, but I need to head into group therapy.”
“Are you happy?” Castiel stormed over, knocking Luke’s feet off the table.
“I watch all three children on a regular basis.”
“Why me?” he questioned, but he knew the answer.
Castiel felt a knot grow in his stomach. It wasn’t something that he talked about all that much outside of his therapist and the people that were in his group therapy meetings. “Five years and one month,” he responded. The date was easy enough to remember. The last drink he ever had was the whiskey the day Jack was born. “Most people can’t tell. Are you—”
“Yeah.”
“It’s good that your family is in your corner.”
“Daddy got scared, just… wait in the living room. I’ll be there soon…” Castiel got to his feet as he shook out his hands and walked in place. He rinsed his hands off before splashing his face with cold water. When he still felt on edge, he took a minute to breath in the smell of garlic and onions and herbs in the sauce.
“Gabe drop the ball again?” It was Hannah. She was the only woman in their small group and she was always happy to see Jack.
“Lucifer?”
“With all the staff changes I’m going to have to have to work Saturday. School is in session next week, and with everything going I don’ know when I’ll be able to take them.”
“Is that why you seemed so angry? What are you going to do? Run to mommy like you’ve been doing for these past few months. You think she’d be thrilled about this?”
Castiel had to let the sauce simmer and had nothing to do but wait. He went to the couch and was met with Jack. His son grabbed his arm and held it tightly as Alex and Claire scooted closer to him. On screen was the classic Mary Poppins. The movie he’d seen countless times as Jack loved it, the music was familiar enough to ground him.
“Thanks for coming. Just follow me…”
Castiel froze he stepped forward to herd the children away from Dean. Then he could pull Jack aside. He’d had a similar conversation with him before, but it had been a year ago and in even simpler terms.
“He’s not tall like Sam.”
“I’m really sorry Mr. Novak…”
“Weren’t you the one that was so proud that I started “acting like an adult” and now you’re criticizing me because my life is boring?”
“I was just wondering if those were your children?”
“You made that assumption. I actually informed you of contrary facts,” Castiel teased. “But it is getting late, I told Anna I would be back before 10.”
“You’re adorable.” Charlie wrapped him in a hug after he got through a door, carefully avoiding what he carried. “Cookies are always welcome in my house. I’m glad you didn’t listen to Dean, total lack of manners sometime.”
“Wow,” Dean let out a low whistle. “What’s your favorite thing to learn?”
Summer was coming to a close rather quickly. For whatever reason, Dean’s business started to pick up and he had not spent that much time together. The two had not yet been able to spend the night at Dean’s place. Mainly because it was proving next to impossible to find someone to watch Jack overnight.
Early Monday afternoon he was surprised to get a phone call from reception saying that he had a visitor for lunch. Castiel frowned. He normally took his lunch from 12:30-1:30 every day, but the only person who ever came to see him was Jody. As he walked out, he heard laughter and saw his brother, Gabriel, leaned against the counter with two pink boxes from his bakery and a paper bag.
After Jack is tucked into bed for the night, Castiel responded to Dean’s text message. He ignores the excitement he felt when Dean immediately responded:
Hello again! Unfortunately for the past week or so I've not had internet. I just got it back last night so here is the chapter, I will try to post on Saturday as well.
Castiel thought of all the words he needed to say. But they got stuck in his throat, and the screams of delight of his children pulled him out. “I think I would. Let’s go see what trouble they’ve gotten themselves into.”
At the barbeque, Castiel and Dean briefly talk about alcholism.
“You met
“Her bias? You don’t have to put up with condescending shit.”
“If by sweet you mean high-spirited, stubborn, too clever for her own good, and prone to violence.”
Castiel waited a few moments, not wanting to ask for help, but at the same time he knew Jody wouldn’t object. She knew Dean. “It would.”
want to be the first one to know. I need to make sure that she’s good enough for you and Jack.”
“Gilda I’m afraid that you are on your own here. I have played quite a bit of poker. While Charlie and Ash may be a challenge, Dean will pose no problem to me.”
When Sam had texted Dean that he needed him to do a job ASAP, he almost bailed on it. That was until his brother called him and explained it was for friend from the resource center he volunteered at. He didn’t say anything but the man had called him,
They all loaded up their plates with the spaghetti and went outside to where a picnic table sat. The night was actually not too hot and there was a breeze in the air. Typically, Alex would be able to carry a conversation and Claire could nudge a few words out of Jack, but tonight they were mostly quiet. The talking didn’t start until Dean came out; a plate heaped full with pasta. He sat next to Castiel; the table not very large so their knees bumped together.
Her smile was weak as she looked at him. He didn’t know what else to say so he pressed record and stepped out into the hall. After that hours passed in the blink of the eye. He spoke to a lawyer the hospital contacted so Kelly could make her last wishes known just in case. Soon his siblings all arrived. Michael dealt with everything having to do with Luke as Anna dealt with trying to contact their parents and Kelly’s. Gabriel was Gabriel. He got donuts and coffee trying to lighten the mood, help everyone carry the burden. Castiel didn’t leave Kelly’s side once he had greeted them.
graphic or he would have to deal with the repurcussions which would most likely be an extra chapter in the book and Jack wanting him to stay until he fell asleep.
“We brought some dishes over from the cart, let us know what you think.” Andrea turned her head when there were squeals of excitement from the children. “Which one is yours?”
“We like seeing him.” She smiled widely.
“No, they’re very polite. I was just sitting on the bench over there when I saw you two. I just want to compliment the two of you for spending time with your kids. I should tell my husband that he should go on a dad date with your friends.”
“Thank you, we should hurry along.” Castiel rushed after them until he caught up with Jack. He let himself be distracted by their wonderment at the large creatures. Claire was particularly enamored by the lions. Jody’s nickname for her was her little lion cub. Partially because of her wild curls, and partially because of her feisty personality. They had walked through most of the outdoor exhibits when they got hungry. They found a picnic table near some large plastic animals the kids could climb on. “You three are in for a treat, I make the
“Really?” Dean’s easy smile appeared, more like a smirk as he leaned forward.
“It’s great.” He opened it and sees a scarf. It’s a chunky knit and dark blue speckled throughout with lighter shades of blue. “It’s lovely.”
“I brought cookies. Dean told me not to bring anything, but—”
He had to stop himself from spitting out. “You’re not meeting him.”
“Cas, you’re paying me for this.”
Mrs. Mills at school.”
“It’s with Dean, right? He’s your special friend.”
“Yeah…”
Jack was unusually hyper the day of the barbeque. Usually, he didn’t get like this unless he was around other kids, but he supposed it was the excitement of the day. Barbeques were a bit casual for the Novak family. While his father was laid back about everything, his mother was higher strung. A habit that Michael unfortunately picked up on, and now—as a married man—he took it upon himself to hold the get togethers which were usually dinner parties.
“No, like if I had a… special friend. Like Uncle Gabriel and Kali.”
He sat down on the bed beside Jack where he had made room and picked up the book they read together the past few nights. He started with the Hobbit and was on the next book in the series. Jack only made it a few pages before he dozed off.
“No, I probably wouldn’t have graduated high school if it weren’t for the combined efforts of Sam and Bobby. My dad said I should join the Marines like him, that’d I make a good solider, but I…” He stopped himself. “It wasn’t my thing. Started working at Bobby’s garage during most of the year and did some summer firefighting.”
“Ignore him we’re all at the kitchen table.” She led him to the other end of the living room where there was a large table. “My girlfriend, Gilda…” She pointed to a petite brunette woman. “And my roommate Ash.” She pointed to a man with an unusual hairstyle.
“Better than Lucifer,” she muttered.
“Well, you are still my number one babysitter if you let my kids step foot in your house ever again.” She laughed, but then set the sandwich down as she leaned forward. “I meant to ask you what happened that night. You’ve told me before that you don’t like to be alone when it happens.”
“Cas!”
Jack just shrugged. “If they were nice and liked me it wouldn’t matter.”
“Of course.”
“Daddy you always read to me.”
“Can we play baseball?” Claire questioned.
“Jack did request your burgers.”
“Are we going?”
Jody’s eyes widened. “I knew it. I saw it at the barbeque.” She put her hand on her face as her elbow went to the desk. “Given that you let me know about the date that you went on, I take that you aren’t here to give me a play by play.”
On the weekends he would usually spend more time on breakfast than the usual cereal or oatmeal. Glancing at the clock he saw it was 6:45, Jack would be up no later than 7:30 knowing him. He began to gather ingredients: some he kept in the freezer, onion, cheese, and eggs. He makes slow work of this, pausing long enough to start coffee. About fifteen minutes later he hears footsteps on the stairs.
“Are you going to make me?”
“Mr. Novak,” he softly corrected.
Dean comes back not only with the drinks, but also a startling amount of food. “Benny said we’d have to share; hope you don’t mind.” There are bunch of small containers, smaller portions of his most popular dishes. Dean pointed them out: hushpuppies, oysters, fried cat fish, red beans and rice, shrimp etouffee.
“Hello!” The person who greeted him at the door was a young woman wearing a conservative floral print dress, a cross pendant hanging from her neck. “And you are?”
“And dinner. With the move you have no idea how hard cooking has been. I’m pretty sure even Jack is fed up with microwave meals and pizza.”
“It is fuel efficient and has a high safety rating,” Castiel replied as he slid into it. “I had a Lincoln Continental before it and car seats were a nightmare to install.”
Alfie. He was also an accounting major, and Castiel hadn’t been this head over heels even with his high school girlfriend. He had adorable elfin features and bright eyes. He was self-assured and could carry a conversation for the both of them. Both had little experience with men and relationships in general. They kept their relationship quiet, though, they did spend a lot of time behind the locked door of Alfie’s dorm. That hadn't gone unnoticed by some of the other residents. The two of them hadn’t had any serious talks. There was no asking what they meant to each other, but the both of them had not seen anyone else. Castiel knew that was all he could expect, at least for now. Things would not be pleasant if his ROTC leader found out that he was dating a man.
There is a switch of perspective in this chapter. It is labeled with bold italics.
“So, what are your plans? You were surprisingly vague,” Anna said as Castiel stepped inside. “Is it a date?”
In the kitchen he dried the counter of the water and hung the towel on the small rack on the side of one of the cabinets. When he turned around, he saw Castiel leaning against the counter with his arms crossed over his chest. “You know many think that my social skills are lacking, but I like to think that I am perceptive enough to notice when something is amiss. It seemed as though you wanted to ask me something.”
“I know. It’s just I forget, the town is small, but…”
. His voice was deep and grumbly. He liked helping out old guys most of the time. Usually, they ended up being repeat customers and when he finished a job, they would invite him to sit down with a beer and talk.
“Thanks.” Castiel reached for him, a warm hand settling on his thigh. “To this day I don’t know what happened, but the trauma of the accident combined with the birth was too much for Kelly. She died shortly after Jack was born.”
date with a man in even longer. The only thing that calmed his nerves was that it was Dean.
“No, when we go grocery shopping, we can stop by the hardware store to get some paint samples. You can help me choose.”
Jack just shrugged again. “I haven’t met anyone with two daddies before, but I guess it would be alright.”
He was envious that he can fall asleep for bed that easily. His routine is slow and calculated: he tidied up the house—specifically his bedroom and the downstairs; then he took a long shower; brushed his teeth; steeped a cup of chamomile tea thick with honey; and selected a biography off of his bookshelf. The book was his company in the low light of his bedroom as he drained the cup of tea. He tucked the book into his nightstand drawer before he washed out the honey residue in his cup, then filled it with water.
“Rough morning?” It’s Sam. The young attorney who comes to the resource center and spends the whole day there the second Thursday of every month. He has been since the day that Castiel had met him.
“Yes, Claire was so wound up I needed them out of my hair. At least Jack can keep her occupied with non-destructive activities.” She sighed. “She’s really excited about the zoo trip.” Jody frowned as she turned on the faucet after squirting in a bit of dish soap.
“Better than the vending machine,” Jody said as she grabbed it. “Things have been crazy with Alex’s soccer and Claire’s baseball. It’s not like they are training for the major leagues.” She unwrapped the sandwich. “But I have a feeling that you didn’t ask to meet me for lunch to listen to me complain about kids.”
“Did you adopt him?”
“Enough of that.”
“Well shit, because I don’t usually do this whole dating thing. It’s usually a few beers and then sex.” Dean shrugged as he took a long drink from his glass of water. “I think that’s why Sam set me up with you.”
“We had dinner a week or two ago. She told me that like over a month ago she watched Jack on a Friday night. You came to the door with your hair combed and wearing your nice khakis and had on cologne, but all you said is that you were hanging with a work friend.”
“But you did.” He didn’t know how to convey to Dean how much it really did mean to him. Other than his family, Jody had been the only other person that was truly there for him. But they were there for each other. Dean did it with seemingly no agenda. There didn’t seem to be pity or worry in his actions.
“No, I can tell that Claire likes you. I know she thinks I’m…I forget how she phrased it but boring I suppose.” He sighed.
“This is Jack Kline.” Castiel gave Jack a gentle nudge forward.
“Of course, that didn’t change.”
“I suppose.” Castiel shrugged his shoulders.
It was mid-August when Dean finally invited Castiel to his house for dinner, and had slyly asked if it was possible for him to stay the night. Though he was hesitant he decided that he could always back out later. Gabriel volunteered to watch Jack for the night with the contingency that Castiel would set aside sometime to explain
“Are you coming to career day?” Alex questioned, pulling Castiel out of his head. “Mom was the class favorite when I brought her in and Claire said that it was next week.”
“We don’t do fireworks. Ellen has banned them since Dean nearly set the shed on fire. And Jody will be there with her kids.” He could tell that he thought this would be the biggest selling point. Sam was very close with Jody, even though their ages weren’t that far apart he knew Jody thought of him as her son. When Castiel didn’t appear to change his stance, Sam sighed and his shoulders loosened as though he was defeated. “Listen I may be overstepping, but I think Dean would be happy to see you.”
“Well,” Castiel corrected.
“He is a distraction.”
“Shit, I didn’t mean to bring you down.”
At the beginning Cas is drinking, references his problem with alcohol later. The police inform Cas of a car accident, and that his brother is dead. Cas speaks with Kelly in the hospital, she later passes away too after giving birth to Jack.
Castiel just went to kiss him again, he shifted his hands up, and held his wrists in one hand, delighted by just how thin they are. He reached for the waistband, hooking his thumbs in. When he was about to pull them down, he froze. There was a sound that didn’t seem like neighbors upstairs or the crackle of the fireplace.
“Wait, you’re the guy whose roof Dean made me help out with fixing,” Benny said with a laugh. “Don’t worry, brother. I’m just joking. I own a food truck now, but I help Dean out with his business if the job is more than one man can handle.”
“It took longer than that. I’m friends with his brother so we spoke at his family’s barbeque—”
“Luke? You haven’t mentioned him before.”
“I just told mom that he was acting like Lucifer again, but that wasn’t the truth…” Gabriel rubbed the back of his neck. “He…He was complaining about living with you. I told him to grow up, but then he started bragging about how he finally got dirt on the perfect Castiel.”
Without warning Castiel closed the gap between them, a hand went to the back of Dean’s head. There’s no hair to grab as Dean’s hair is shorter than his ever was, even in the service. Still, he used it to bring him even closer, to press their mouths together. It starts out relatively innocent, closed mouths, but Dean’s tongue pushed forward. Castiel tugged Dean toward him until he’s pressed against the window of the car, one hand of his on Dean’s head, and the other hooked into his belt loop.
That afternoon Castiel frowned as he packed his overnight bag. His years in the military and his own tendency towards minimalism meant that he knew how to pack lightly. As he grabbed a t-shirt to sleep in, he saw Jack standing in the doorway.
“Don’t worry Claire, I’m not mad at you.”
“Yes, daddy.”
“No.” Dean could detect the irritation in Cas’s voice. “But I want to know about you. Don’t people normally talk on these things? Get to know each other.” The tone was flippant, but Castiel could tell this was not something he was familiar with.
“There’s so much that Dean doesn’t know, but sometimes it just comes out. I’ve told him more in the couple months I’ve known him than I’ve told Michael in a year. Not everything of course, I told him I don’t drink but not why. He knows I was a captain and---” Castiel just let out a sigh. “I mentioned Luke. You know I never talk about him.”
“Unfortunately.” Castiel set a blanket on the ground and gave Jack one of his favorite toys.
“Can I give you a hug?” He waited until they said yes and he gave them all a hug at once, holding his arm out for Jack. “Why don’t you all watch a movie while I clean up and finish dinner? It will be a little late so you guys can have dessert first.”
Castiel begged again while Luke just sauntered around the apartment. He took a seat at the table with his feet propped up as he lit up a cigarette as if it’s a live performance he’s watching. Alfie doesn’t stop once he comes out of the bathroom dressed in his own clothing. When Castiel goes to kiss him goodbye, Alfie just reached over and gave his arm a squeeze. He just said that he would see him around, and not to worry, his sister had an apartment in town he could crash at.
“The only time I miss it is when I’m at something like this. A lot of people, especially people I’m not familiar with.”
Dean shrugged. “Kids will be kids. No explanation is owed to me if you ever need to cancel.”
“That’s what the kids call it these days, oh Cassie…” He tossed an arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “I don’t work at the bakery on Saturdays so he can stay late or spend the night if you need.” He gave a wink.
“Pardon?”
“I’m so sorry, man.”
A smile spread across Eileen’s face. “Did you meet Jack? I keep on offering to babysit, but I swear he only lets Jody watch him.”
“Just a play date…”
“Why would I do a thing like that?” Castiel shook his head and then gestured for him to follow him in.
“Just come inside when you’re finished.” Castiel walked away feeling like a weight lifted from his shoulder. Jack looked at him curiously, but he distracted the boy by asking him to help. He decided that dinner with him and Jack would be the best way to get to know Dean. While he wanted to see if they could be more than friends, he wasn’t quite sure how he really was with Jack.
“Why don’t you try not fucking in my living room?”
“I can be right over,” Dean said.
“It was the first time he yelled at me,” Jack replied softly.
Castiel almost said his goodbye, but he stopped himself. “If you want you are invited to spend the night. It will be a PG sleepover as Jack’s bedroom is across the hall, but if you want…”
“You of all people should understand it’s not
“Perhaps it’s for the best.” Castiel said goodbye and sighed as he hung up. Jack had given up on getting his attention and was doing his best to skip stones. He quickly typed a text to Dean before running to join Jack.
“Rather I call you one?” he replied dryly.
It was late June when Castiel was in his office finishing up paperwork. With any luck he would be able to finish up early and pick up Jack from his summer camp. That brought a smile to his face as he’d been begging to have a picnic for dinner since one of his friends had mentioned their parents did it one night.
“How can peas be dumb?” Jack questioned as he looked at Castiel.
“Iced tea.”
“That I can do.”
“I can try to get one of my siblings to come with me, but they’ve been busy. I would feel a bit guilty as it’s hard enough for them to make time to watch Jack like they normally do.”
Dean sighed and took another drink of his beer. “Can we change the subject? Can’t Jo talk about college or something?”
Alfie grabbed the drink from Castiel’s hand, and practically ends up in his laps. Their mouths meet and the kiss is far from innocent. It’s long and hard, tongue probing inside as Alfie grabs a fistful of Castiel’s sweater. Castiel groaned, grinding his hips against Alfie in the attempt to get some sort of stimulation. “Bedroom?” the smaller man asked.
“Nah, Sam is like part Sasquatch,” Dean said with a laugh, but saw that confusion crossed his face.
“Pro bono legal services.” A wide grin crossed his face as he dug in his pocket to dig out his card.
“Can someone watch Jack overnight sometime?” Dean asked jokingly. “Just wondering…you know for the future.”
“Shh… I don’t…” He let go of Alfie’s wrist, about ready to stand up when he heard what sounded like keys, and then… “Shit.”
It’s no use the front door led directly to the living room. “Holy shit. I wish I had a camera to document the loss of virginity.”
it’s a
Dean watched as the kid simply nodded along to the words. He seemed like he understood what Castiel was saying. The kid had to be like what, five at the very most? When he was a kid, he wouldn’t have understood half of what came out of Castiel’s mouth.
“It is very thoughtful.” Without saying a word, he began to unwrap the sandwich and take the lid off the soup to allow it cool. While Gabriel was the easiest of his siblings to get along with, he could be quite troublesome. He cared deeply about his siblings, but this was wrapped beneath many layers of jokes and antics. Over the years Castiel had learned to appreciate it. The letters, emails, and phone calls from Gabriel while he was overseas helped him forget—if only a few moments—all the violence and pain around him.
The biggest puzzle to Castiel was if Dean had said something about him. Dean was attractive, but he hadn’t thought he’d given any inclination as to his sexual preferences. “Even though I provide counseling in my professional life, it does not carry over into my personal life.”
Castiel set down the mug, holding himself as if he is cold. Dean throws an arm around him. He always forgets just how strong Castiel is until he’s in his arms. He looks smaller than Dean, but he knows it’s all lean muscle there. “Let’s just forget this and watch a movie.”
“I do have a secret to admit.” Castiel reached across the table, wanting to touch Dean’s hands. He liked how they felt under his own, they were worn from all the hard work he did, but they felt comfortable in his own. “I didn’t really need my house painted right away. I just wanted an excuse to see you again after the barbeque.”
wouldn’t want to take all three of them to the zoo. I barely want to take both Alex and Claire to the store with me.”
“You probably need the rest more.” Dean came up behind him as Castiel paused the ingredient preparation. “I’m not too used to someone else cooking; you’re going to spoil me.” He placed his hands on Castiel’s waist, rolling his hips against his ass.
Even after speaking to Dean at the barbeque, Castiel cannot imagine calling Dean Winchester out of the blue. Even worse is the thought of texting. Besides, what would he even say to the man? He’s seems perfectly nice, but he’s not sure if he’s willing to risk everything by going all in yet. Do people ordinarily call almost perfect strangers to ask to hang out as friends?
“Good night, Dean.”
Castiel has a PTSD episode. It is in last section that starts with: "Having seen Dean the day prior, it was not Castiel’s intention to call him again." The kids break a window by throwing a baseball, he has a flashback that originally scares the kids. Largely resolved through a talk, but he does call Dean to fix the window.
“Had to do something.”
“Scout’s honor.”
“I don’t get one?”
A hand went down to trace the outline of his cock with his free hand. “Stay there,” he ordered as he sat up. When he prepared for dinner, he stored some lube and condoms in the end table. “Do you want me to fuck you?” He kept his tone casual as he leaned down to kiss his cock through his underwear, hands going up to hold him down.
Dean followed Castiel out of the kitchen. He watched as he carefully placed them in the empty sink before the man pointed to the cabinet with the bowls and the drawer that held spoons. Castiel grabbed the shortcake, strawberries, and whipped cream before he went back to the kitchen. “Construct your own, but please make the whipped cream proportional Jack.”
“You’re… That’s…. Perfect little Castiel is a fag.”
“Of course.” Castiel attempted to tidy his papers and gestured to a chair. “But it is a Tuesday, and you aren’t scheduled to come in…” He turned to look at his calendar. “For another week.”
“Thanks…” He watched as the men went back into the house. Dean was puzzled as he gets to work on the roof inspection. After poking around, he discovered the news that was good for his wallet, but not what Castiel will want to here. Someone like him will probably chew him out. This will be the last time he took one of his brother’s friends.
“My dad, he…” Dean shrugged, looked almost ashamed as he glanced at the ground before opening his water bottle.
“Long enough to hear your voices,” he whispered. “I came for a dish towel but stayed for the show.”
“Yes, one of those pick the fruit yourself orchards.” He extended them toward Ellen who just gave him a wide grin.
“I have good news. I have started the training for peer support specialist. That means before Jack starts preschool I can hopefully quit working at the super market.” They asked him some questions, but the mood turned congratulatory.
“How’d you start your own business?”
Castiel relented and waved him through, leading him back to his office. He eyed Gabriel who grinned ear to ear. “You didn’t actually watch Jack so no information is owed.”
“And the only help you let me give you,” Sam teased. “Like I said, if you ever need a babysitter my fiancé Eileen would be more than happy to.”
It took several days of back-and-forth text messages before they agreed on a plan for their date. Saturday night worked the best as Dean never worked weekends. For Castiel he didn’t have to worry about work the next day and his siblings were typically available.  He knew that Jack was a little disappointed because he was going to stay with Anna. Though he thought he and his sister were most similar, to a child she must have been extremely boring. Currently she was finishing up her doctoral degree in some obscure subset of history while teaching undergraduate courses. Her apartment was lined with thick academic books and obscure fiction novels. She didn't have TV in the living room, and her board games were limited to a few trivia games and a chess set. Castiel always had to pack some sort of entertainment for Jack.
“No, you’re way better.”
“Nothing new with you?”
“I just want some advice, and I don’t know who to ask.” He pushed away his food as he grabbed the mug. The heat felt good in his hands. “How do you know when it’s right to tell the person you are dating about your past?”
Dean face dropped slightly. There was a scowl as he drained the glass of water like he wished it was something stronger. “I wanted a change, there was no handyman in North Cove. Besides if business gets slow, Bobby always has work for me to do.” He shrugged, then looked back at Cas with that teasing glint in his eyes. “Now that I have you as a customer, things won’t be slow.”
“Is that?”
“Jesus… I never expected that.”
“Why must you give me all the difficult cases?” He turned the file to face him and skimmed it over. “He’s not even violent.”
“Welcome Mr. Kline!” the teacher said to him.
“Well, thanks again. I should be going.”
“I just wanted to talk about what needs to be done.”
seemed to be the unsaid words Gabriel said. His brother gave him a comforting smile, Castiel knew when they got up, he would sweep him up into one of his warm, bone-crushing hug. “Tell me about this guy.”
“It’s nice seeing dads come to these sort of things.”
“Sounds good man. I will see you around. I have to meet with client in five.”
“It’s nice.”
They finished in three days’ time, and Castiel was there for none of it. He started to think that the check would just be mailed for him. Instead, he is surprised to receive a text message from Castiel asking him if he would come over to pick up the check on Sunday. Since he wasn’t working, he took his Impala and drives to the quaint little lake house.
