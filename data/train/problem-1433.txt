He had to smile a little bit. Ever since he got Sherlock over the drugs, him and the older Holmes brother were on friendly terms; Greg would even go as far as to call them some sort of friends (you never know with a Holmes) and sometimes he would catch himself flirting a little bit. He couldn’t help himself. There was something about the politician that he found attractive.
“Take an intelligent guess, genius”
Thank you, stupidly handsome super-model Kitchen Guy.
Sherlock’s face distorted in an expression that was almost pained, before he slammed is face back against John’s throat and let out one, tiny, heart-breaking sob. Slightly panicked by this turn of events, John tightening his grip around Sherlock, frantically analysing which part of his statement could have made the genius this upset.
In an explosion of frantic energy, John Watson burst through the door and Greg silently visited that thought again, holding onto it with a bit more force. John was carrying two large bags and his daughter; looking like he had been through a domestic warzone (and Greg would bet his badge that it had nothing to do with getting Rosie travel-ready).
Surprised by this turn of events, John queried some more: “You miss Sherlock, right?” A small nod.  Oh, fucking perfect! The cause of the problem turned out to be the solution as well. “I miss him, too, sweetheart” A small pause. Contemplating. Then: “Shall Daddy text him to ask if he has some time for us? If he comes home soon?”
They stayed wrapped up for some minutes in probably the weirdest embrace John Watson had ever witnessed; and certainly, the longest time he witnessed Sherlock sharing human contact while being in his right mind.
“You don’t need to apologize. I’m the one fucking things up here”
Why you got me going
“I’m four,” Rosie remarked, sounding a tad more scandalized than a toddler should be capable of.
Relief overcame him when he finally heard John's voice again, soothing and soft. "Breathe, Sherlock. I'm here, it's okay. Just breathe"
“I’m not gay.”
“Rosie, hand.” he tried to put some authority in his voice, but instead it sounded desperate and defeated. His hands were trembling.
As eager as he had seemed before, the lack of response made him visibly insecure. When there was one thing that John Watson cared more about than his pride, it was Sherlock Holmes’ happiness. And if there was one thing that made him more uncomfortable than a moment of humiliation, it was an open display of Sherlock’s insecurities. Because he knew very well they were there, buried deep below the surface of a self-proclaimed sociopath. Sherlock tried, he tried so hard, and John was about to lose his cool because he, for once, wasn’t the dominant part of a romantic relationship?  Seriously? What the hell was he doing? Fleeing because this bloody gorgeous man managed to catch him off guard? This might be a once in a life time chance (tho John hoped it wasn’t) and he was going to blow it over nerves?! Hell no! If Sherlock, who was so foreign to relationships, affection, feelings, wasn’t afraid to show John what he felt, why would he be? He invaded Afghanistan, god damn it, he could manage to kiss his best friend. Except… that it was
"Sir, I'm a doctor, and I can confirm you she is-"
“We’re a family now, for fuck’s sake. Rosie needs you, damn it, I need you”
an idiot!  He had gotten so lost in feelings sorry for himself, and self-doubt, and ‘Sherlock’s married to his work’ that he had failed to realize how much his friend had changed since they sort of became a family. It was written clearly all over the usually so calm expression that Sherlock felt so much more than he had before.
John, for his part, felt like someone punched him right in the face, in the best kind of ways. Everything was tingly and warm, relief mixed with affection and a deep fondness bloomed in his chest, seeping through every pore. Finally. Something… had always been missing, something… more…something big. Something he now saw in the stormy blue eyes of his mad genius. He bit his lower lip, suddenly overcome by a deep desire to cry, and laugh, and dance, and kiss Sherlock until they were exhausted and giddy. He coughed clumsily, to overplay the small noise escaping his throat.
His heart did a funny fluttery thing when the detective, while never ceasing his conversation, grabbed his wrist and showed him gently but persistent down in his chair. The hand on John’s wrist stayed for good measure, until the doctor subtly patted it, signaling that he affirmed the silent request to stay. Who was he to refuse?
He leaned against the dark side of the wall, hidden in shadows of a setting afternoon sun, and scratched the bumpy fabric with his fingernails frantically (Physical stimulus to ground him, bind him to reality, before he could get lost... lost somewhere... deep ... deep down in his mind). His breathes grew more and more shallow, the world was spinning even more than before, and with mild panic Sherlock registered his insides turning, right before he was sick over a rosebush. Instead of passing, the nauseous feeling intensified even more and John arrived just in time to watch him barf spectacularly for the second time.
“You could have had your sexuality crisis
(Get me out of my mind
between the two. His realization must have appeared written all over his face (at least for the master of deduction), for Sherlock visibly relaxed and actually
John let him, welcomed the attention from his favourite consulting detective in the whole wide world.
Another two hours had passed, and it was now nearing ten. Staring off into nothing for an undefined amount of time, the doctor realize that he wasn’t angry anymore. In fact, he felt a little bit guilty (he didn’t need to scream at Sherlock like that) and a great deal of loneliness (the quietness of the flat reminded him of a time he’d rather not remember). It was the first evening they spend separated since Sherlock had surprised him with a kiss and changed their lives. It was a weird feeling, being alone in the late hours of the evening; without the silent companionship, without another warm presence, without the pleasant rumble of a deep baritone voice. John sighed. Shook his head. Sighed again. Debated pouring himself a finger of whiskey. Vowed against it, got up anyway to get the bottle. Another half an hour passed with John deeply buried in his own thoughts, sipping the burning liquor from time to time. Finally, he let out a long exhale that sounded way too loud in the quiet flat, and fetched his phone from the coffee table.
“Stop smiling like that, it’s sickening” Greg looked up from his phone and was met with Sherlock’s calculating stare, since his focus shifted from the files to the detective. Greg gave him a wide toothy smile in reply.
“Mate! How’s it been?”
“You’re pretty full, buddy” the barkeeper said, while giving John a pointed look. The doctor knew instantly that the barkeeper hadn’t really been flirting with Sherlock, but that only flared his anger more. Sherlock was downright forcing it to piss him off. And it worked. Spectacularly well.
slime. Or they attempted to, more accurately.
“Greg’s hoping that the Fab 5 can help John to gain new confidence, so that he can face whatever comes his way like the wonderful person that he is-“
Naturally, Sherlock did it again. Or found himself almost doing it again, more precisely. The waking thing, mind you. The week went by in a blur. They didn’t really talk- not about what had happened, not at all – John retreated in the evenings relatively early, leaving Sherlock more often than not sitting alone in the dark, eating himself away on crippling self-doubt. John didn’t have another nightmare- or, more precisely, a nightmare that Sherlock witnessed- until five days later.
Lestrade was the first to notice them, making a low sound to acknowledge their presence (not even batting an eye when he saw Rosie). John felt the attention immediately shifted to them, felt confused, questioning stares in his sides. The array of officers was downright tiny in the living room: Lestrade, Anderson, Donovan; and of course, Sherlock. John could hear two more working in the kitchen.
It took a split-second for the genius’ brain to wrap around the meaning of those words. Greg could pinpoint the exact second when realization dawned on him. Sherlock’s expression crumbled. “What?” He gulped in some air.
- form with his eyes. He stumbled in the hallway and down the stairs on auto-pilot, went to the kitchen to make two cups of tea. While the kettle started to boil, he allowed himself to sink against the counter and let out a few dry sobs.
Sherlock stared down at the small box in his lap, which contained a nicely decorated cupcake. It was richly covered with raspberry frosting and smelled sinfully good.
"You don't have to be embarrassed to ask for these kind of things" John mumbled against the wild mop of curls, voice already slurred with sleep. "You idiot" he added, his tone warm with affection. Sherlock made a noise of protest (already a bit back to his old self), but John shushed him with a nudge of his chin against the slender shoulder blades.
In those nights, the gravitated together easily, in a sleepy embrace, and unspoken statements of affection were shared, and for the first time in his life Sherlock Holmes realized that he wanted to share so much more with another human being. Things like kisses, and touches, and promises. Things he thought himself above of. Silly sentiment. Just a mixture of hormones, being transmitted from the brain. Animalistic. Simple chemistry, nothing more.
it deep within his core, more than he would ever admit.
saved your life countless of times -“
, perhaps, John realized when his stomach gave another painful lurch while he sat in the back of the cab.
John would later blame it on the damn tone that he let a breathy “
"Stay with me?" he finally whispered, sounding small and vulnerable and devensive all at the same time. God, John had missed this voice!  "Please?" he added when John didn't respond right away.
But aside from the insanity he had to put up with on a daily basis, John didn’t really do bad days. The years as army doctor had taught him to be grateful for every day he could live in peace and quiet (as peaceful and quite as it can get when Sherlock was involved), so he wasn’t really one to get upset about a whole day. Life was short - a platitude with a hint of truth. John Watson had seen his fair share of forcefully shortened lives, so it came almost naturally for him to value the life he had.
So, they don’t talk about it.
Without another word, he hurried up the stairs to the nursery. Curiously and still a bit wobbly-legged, John followed some steps behind. His heart made an almost painful jump as he watched Sherlock bend over his daughter – their daughter – to give her silent smooch on the forehead. The little girl smiled in her sleep, but didn’t stir or wake. Sherlock turned to John standing in the doorframe, with a beaming smile, lighting up his whole face. John couldn’t help but return it, before he took the detective’s hand gently in his, to lead him downstairs to their shared bedroom.
“I love you, too.”
. The tremors stopped. His pulse didn’t quicken anymore as soon as the door of the flat closed behind him. He was better.
The loud sound of Mrs. Hudson’s grandfather’s clock startled the doctor out of his post-Sherlock-kissed-me-daze (He decided later on, that he would arrange his personal time-line with the measurement of ‘pre-Sherlock’s-kiss’ and ‘post-Sherlock’s-kiss’ in order to commemorate this life changing moment).  He then realized that he had been standing there doing nothing but staring like a fucking idiot for at least five minutes and that he was precisely two minutes away from having to hurry. Sherlock seemed to be aware of the time too, because he muttered in a low rumble: “You’re going to be late” No, he
“John!”
“What?” he asked, also momentarily forgetting that he dreaded repetitions.
Mycroft’s lip curled in a tiny amused grin. “Not many people are this eager to be considered as an acquaintance of the Holmes family”
hard about the presented social paradox. The concentration written all over his face made him look quite adorable in John’s opinion.
eyes flashed in front of his inner eye and he had to shake his head violently to get rid of the image. No, this was WORK, this wasn't Baker Street; he couldn't allow this sickening feeling into his system, they were reserved for solitude, for isolation, for the shelter of his bedroom when John was soundly asleep just one floor above and- There it was it again.
When he had dragged the barely conscious detective to bed and gotten ready himself, he spend nearly half an hour just watching his sleeping face, pondering about what the hell had just happened.
“No, Sherlock. That’s quite enough“
It was a bit messy, and he dumped into several objects while he tumbled down the stairs in a dizzy haze- but he had to run, run as fast as he could to just get away. He would have run to the end of the world if it had changed a thing. The cold air burned in his lungs like fire, but he just continued running- for running was the only thing that made the voice go away- the burning in his muscles and the taste of bile in his mouth made him feel alive and
So let's go
He flexed his un-Sherlocked hand, once, twice and breathed in the patterns his therapist advised him. He felt Sherlock squeeze his hand shyly, in a silent question. John squeezed back with a half-smile and felt his heart swell a little.
John, like a partner would. A lover.
Still, he let himself be pulled against John without any resistance, and let himself be kissed; warm, and reassuring, and gentle. A kind of kiss that makes you forget, just for a little while, that your life is about to go to shreds.
Well.
“Given the circumstances, and the presented new- and very promising- variable I’m willing to redeem my previous statement. We should give it a try”
A short while later, John was laying on the queen-sized hotel bed (he had the suspicion that Bobby might have something to do with the fact that they were in a single bed room), listening to Rosie’s sleepy snuffles from the crib by the window and Sherlock’s shuffling in the small bathroom. Naturally, he freaks out about this. It was kind of presumptions of them to believe that they- two grown men, best friends- wouldn’t have a problem sharing a bed.
Finally, when the tense muscles of Sherlock's shoulders slacked; finally, when the terrified cries turned into quiet sobs, Sherlock's voice reached his ears. John huffed in relief and forced a smile on his face when he looked at the bundle of detective attached to his side. Although Sherlock didn't look up to meet his gaze, John noticed that his eyes were no longer closed tightly, but open, red-brimmed and wet.
“Do I even want to know?”
“I love you, John.”
“Is it really that bad that you want me to care for you?”

he? Sherlock Holmes was the man who had died for him and had returned for him.
Kudos, Bookmarks and Comments are appreciated <3
When Sherlock had come back from the dead, John loathed him. He loathed every little second of this nightmare Sherlock had put him through without having the decency of at least giving him a small hint that there was still hope. No, he left John to suffer through depression and a sheer endless quest to find meaning in his once again meaningless life; only to turn up one day, just as John thought he had his life back together. 'You're planning to get married? Too bad, I'm back, John, make me some tea! Life? What life? I've been away!' (Of course, he didn't propose to Mary that night. Of course, she left him not two months after Sherlock's 'miracle'. Of course, even she understood that John Watson's life revolved around Sherlock bloody Holmes. What life? That damn bastard).
collection, so John must have snatched them from him) and ‘dumped’ the napping Rosie on his doctor’s stomach.
“Sherlock rarely sleeps and my old bedroom is Rosie’s room now. On nights where he does need to sleep, I’m taking the couch.”
It was the most fucking beautiful thing he had ever witnessed. The cock underneath his hand jumped violently, soaking the fabric of Sherlock’s underwear with long, hot robes of come. John shuddered, when he felt some of the warm wetness seep through the boxer shorts, lightly dampening his palm. He rotated his hand gently, prolonging the pleasure, until was his friend hissing from oversensitivity, lying boneless against the pillows.
It’s worth it, he tells himself.
He started drawing small circles on Sherlock’s back, the same soothing technique he used when the young man was shaking and vomiting through his drug withdrawal on his couch. “The work we do, you do for the most part” he paused to give Sherlock a small appreciating smile. The praise went unnoticed. “Is important. Very important, in fact. We keep this crazy world at bay. But family- Rosie and John and your brother- is what’s left at the end of the day. It’s what’s worth returning home to” Sherlock nodded vigorously, while looking like he might start to bawl at any given second.
Sherlock,
He would never admit it out loud, but he felt highly intrigued by his doctor's tempter. The moment John Watson got lot in his own passions, every fiber of his form radiated power and dominance; a dominance Sherlock never thought he could find appealing, yet when it came to the ex-army doctor it was very much so. So, he watched, with a rare bright smile as his friend's composure slowly crumbled. He loved seeing John come undone when he harbored powerful emotions. When he realized he had been more staring than actually observing, Sherlock scolded himself mentally. Stupid sentiment getting him all worked up even the morning after. Still...the intonation of John's voice made him feel...something.
Later, the doctor would also realize that Anderson and Donovan had probably been watching the whole thing, but right in this moment, he couldn’t care less when he heard a low whisper and a sound of someone being elbowed in the ribs.
. Genuinely disbelieving that it was possible for another human being to like him, just for being himself. It made a surge of protectiveness well up in the doctor, combined with the urge to punch anybody who had ever hurt this wonderfully odd and oddly wonderful man.
But this? This was different. Purposeless. Sentiment. Vulnerable. Things which don’t suit Sherlock Holmes very well. Desperately, he tried to grasp onto the corners of his mind palace, the corners which were falling apart, getting blurry; he really tried to claw into information he had collected, facts that made him feel safe, but everything started to fade away into a black sea of memories and another powerful wave pushed him under. He felt his own limps shaking, and strangely detached from himself, and he sensation he experiences was very close to drowning, he was drowning inside of his own head. His heart was exploding inside of his chest and the burning sensation made him afraid that he was dying.
Not the important stuff, anyway (yet, John couldn’t shake the though that he might be very mistaken here).
His life is a complicated mess, but most of the time he’s really, really happy about it. About Rosie. About Sherlock. Life is… good. For both of them. Even without Mary. This, here, he realizes, doesn’t feel nearly as anguishing as when Sherlock had been gone. Without Sherlock, John had been
He was sure everyone could see that he was struggling today, and this thought caused a new wave of shame to crash upon him. Sherlock’s warm fingers around his wrist grounded him, but there was no way in hell the detective didn’t
Sherlock turned his head to give his best friend a convincing ‘I’m fine’-look, but realized his mistake immediately when he took in the doctor’s appearance.
He doesn’t want to make himself unhappy over the concept of normative heterosexuality. He wants… he wants this.
2.) Sherlock is also intelligent and funny and surprisingly sweet.
They wrapped up the case early on a Thursday evening. Sherlock had been brilliant, and bustling, and generally high on his own brilliancy. If there would ever be anything Sherlock Holmes would never grow tired of, it would be hearing himself talk.
“I’ve.. ah! (John nuzzled right underneath his ear) I’ve never done this before”
And almost choked on it, when he saw Sherlock walking through the door.
He even looked more debauched than before, which made John feel indiscribable smug. There weren’t much people who could claim that they could make the great Sherlock Holmes come undone like that.
Still, he can’t quite kill the small flicker of hope deep in his belly, when a warm hand settles on his shoulder and the British Guy murmurs quietly: “We’re here to help with that, too.”
Alone.
. He wanted John to like him again, to be comfortable around him again, to trust him again. Never in his life would he have thought that he’d sit in is darkened living room at 3 am on a Thursday, watching two steaming cups of tea go cold and just
"She has always been different, our Violet, she has, but we didn't...we couldn't..." the woman made a strangled noise and buried her face in her shattered looking husband’s cardigan. John nodded in sympathy, but kept his doctor demeanour.
Sherlock gives him one of his “polite smiles” (that, John has told him on multiple occasions, only comes off as cold and murderous. He secretly thinks Sherlock likes it that way), deflating Jonathan’s attempts to “touch those curls, henny!”.
“Hotter than the woolen monstrosities? Impossible.”
, and Sherlock knew he had to ask him or he’d might detonate.
John was, to say the least, surprised about the open question directed his way. Sherlock still scarcely spoke about emotions, though he had grown more considerate for the doctor’s and his own. John didn’t, not after the night that changed everything between them, and wished he would never have to. But Sherlock sounded… unsure. And hurt; more hurt than he himself was probably aware of.
The doctor felt moved by the affection hiding behind the statement, but wrinkled his nose at its self-depriving character. It wasn’t like the arrogant, brilliant genius he knew and.. “Nonsense” he mumbled, lifting Sherlock’s chin a little, to force the younger man to look at him. The expression in Sherlock’s eyes made his breath hitch a little and his brain go offline.
. But the detective seemed to be oblivious to the state the doctor has worked himself into, at least he made no move to comfort John in any way, but proceeded to rattle on about the murder weapon, asking something about extended bruising.
Sherlock Holmes had been called an asshole countless times in his life- but for the first time since he could remember, he actually felt the consequences of his poor treatment of others.
‘And I’m thankful, too. It’s good to know he has a trusted companion on Danger nights. -MH’ However the politician knew about the whole situation was beyond Greg, but he long ago stopped questioning the ways of the Holmes brothers. They simply knew everything, except for how to interact with other human beings.
“And they’re so unfitting (here, Tan pinches the deep green jumper John’s wearing right now, that conveniently has bits of Indian take-out and baby drool all over it). You’re such an attractive man, you don’t have a reason to hide in those things.”
“It’s just that…Sherlock, I’m confused, too. And terrified” He gave a shaky laugh. “I’m just me, and you’re you and that’s-“
Behind John, people begin to shout excitedly upon seeing his flat mate (something about touching “those curls, honey!!!”) and the doctor shoots his friend the most apologetic look he can muster.
~ The End ~
Why did he agree, again?
After solving the case in merely 8 minutes (Drugstore tranquilizer shattered around, child-safe appliances although no toddler was present, weak attempts to hide demolished furniture underneath corny items of decoration- it was painfully obvious), Sherlock took it upon himself to get the girl with Lestrade and another young officer (mostly to avoid dull paperwork, really).
The first thing John noticed when he opened his eyes slowly was the absence of light in the room. His fondness of open shutters was a remnant of the long army nights under the stars. It was those nights where he learned to value the cold shimmer of moonlight and find peace in the bluish darkness of the evening sky. He never shut his shutters again, even if the hard ground of Afghanistan was nothing but a distant memory.
He wasn’t running away- you only run away from things you’re uncomfortable with. And he wasn’t. He loved it,
Sherlock was touched in a way he usually wasn’t; John rarely talked about his time in the war, so it was easy to forget what it meant, what it implied that his partner had been there to mend the hurt soldiers and innocents alike. A wave of gratefulness washed over him; to have John
. But Sherlock cared, John knew. Sherlock cared different than other people, but it didn't mean he cared less. The sheer vulnerability of the whole act just made it overwhelming to the sensitive detective. It is not easy to care, John fucking knew that, it was nothing but a risk, really, what a silly decision to trust anyone. But God, he
Sherlock took a much-needed breath.
John tries not to think about that, tries to ignore the cameras following his every move.
The smile on Rosie’s face when she showed him what he assumed to be a fair effort of creating slime, though was unbeatable. John was smiling as well, looking absolutely wrecked, but at the same time very pleased with himself. Sherlock came home just in time for Rosie’s afternoon nap, so he took it upon himself to give her a quick wash and read her a little story to lure her to sleep. Not even ten minutes later, Rosie was out like a light; and Sherlock returned to the kitchen, to possibly help his partner with the damage control.
”. But in this state of utter distress, the dark gaping, ugly voids were everywhere.
It had been one of the rare moments where he had felt rewarded for all the utter insanity he had to put up with. Not that he minded the excitement, quite the contrary (there were slow days at the surgery where he actually caught himself wishing for a diamond thief to chase or an anonymous serial killer to convey); but every so often Sherlock had been insufferable (again, it was a quite rich thing to say, considering Sherlock's 'normal form' was a charming mixture of condescending bastard and moody toddler).
“Not cleaning, I presume,” Bobby states bluntly-and just like that, the floodgates are opened. Just like that, the Fab 5 go from ‘Hi, we’re nice and harmless’ to full on action mode.
The doctor sighed, knowing he already lost the argument he was having with the version of Sherlock in his head. Although he didn’t really fancy facing the Yarders in the state he and his daughter were in, he was also aware that it was the only way to get a hold of the lanky brunette detective they both so very much adored. ‘Fine’, he thought. ‘Have it your way. If The Work is your top priority, then I have to insert our family into it.’ With small protests of his bad leg (Thanks, anxiety), John straightened himself and gathered a very quiet, very emotionally exhausted Rosie in his arms. “He is not finished yet” he explained the curly head currently tucked in the crook of his neck. “But we can come visit him, yeah? So, we don’t have to wait until we can see him. We’ll be home together in no time.”
While their voices shout over each other, John pats the poor lad’s hand and explains: “That’s the biohazard fridge. Experiments are vital to Sherlock’s line of work and sometimes they tend to be a bit grotesque. The food fridge is over here.”
When he caught Greg’s eye though, his own lit up and he gave his friend a lazy smile.
There were days when John Watson just didn’t
“The bug has been on her best behaviour,” John replied, arranging the infant seat in the back of the car.
, twitched into a grin at the corners. It helped to ease his tension a bit. Another beneficial factor was the way Sherlock tilted his head and thought very
Mycroft had been almost certain that Sherlock had erased most of their time spent together, seeing that they didn’t dwell in memories often; and even if they did, they weren’t this detailed, this clear, this vivid. ‘Night Hawk’, had been the name of
“Yes, yes of course, you madman! God, Sherlock… you never cease to surprise me!”
Involuntarily, a small voice in the back of the geniuses’ head piped up, that maybe it
With a practiced motion, he took the detectives' pulse again (still too fast, but slightly better) and talked on and on, in hope that his voice could reach somehow inside the endless corridors of Sherlock's mind palace and help him to find the way out. Familiar sounds had always helped him with his PTSD attacks, so he figured it was worth a try. So, he just talked about everything and nothing, soothing and encouraging his distressed friend.
“Please, John, lying is such a harsh word. Let’s just say he’s been a bit misinformed, but I will persuade him with my irresistible charm once he’s in the car.”
Get me out of my mind)
After all, she’s getting a more child-proof flat, an actual nursery, and a pretty awesome birthday party out of this whole thing.
John blinked rapidly at the dark wood. Then he shook his head. Looked at the door again. Shook his head again. A gleeful noise escaped his lips without his permission. This was absurd, absolutely insane! Then again, everything was absurd and insane about them, but that made it so bloody wonderful. Who would have thought – who would have dreamed?! – that they would ever find themselves in a situation like this?
While John was
, there had been no day without a fight, no commuting without the awful moment when he was sure he would pass out, no appointment without a tremor in his hands. He just lived with it,
“Let me stop you right there. Not even remotely interested.”
What he didn’t expect was Sherlock already being
John stared dumfounded as his best friend dashed past him, right through the open door of the house. It took him 11 seconds to bring the pieces of information together (He practically heard Sherlock sneering in his ear about the slow rate of his brain performance). When realization finally hit him, he was momentarily frozen at spot. Mentally ill girl, bringing a lot of pain upon her family, hurting her brother's friends... it all sounded awfully familiar. It took John another 15 seconds to wrap his head around the mess this case created, before he hurried right after Sherlock, cursing himself for being so daft. After all, it had been a long time coming.
“You had fun, I see?”
“I love a man in uniform,” Antoni murmurs mostly to himself.
for you?  That it’s a necessity- a set of dull niceties I decided to play along to- out of which I gain nothing? Do you think it means
This intense session of lamenting about his own complex emotional state and the inability to tell John’s motives increased until they almost happened every night. Most of the time, the doctor just left him to it, fondly shaking his head at the over-working genius (for he didn’t know that he was the subject Sherlock was contemplating) going to Sherlock’s / their bed alone (the most disappointing nights were those when he would wake up in the morning and find the space next to him still cold and unoccupied).
The physical stimulus kicked in instantly but worked against the desired effect (Data: Memory. Collected: Last evening. Content: John playing with my hair feels nice. Connotation: SHUT UP). The man resisted to let out a huff when he vowed himself to clear his hard drive of all these useless sentimental thoughts he seemed to produce.
He couldn’t imagine his life without Sherlock. Couldn’t imagine being truly alive when Sherlock wasn’t with him. Losing Sherlock… he doesn’t even want to think about it. Not when it’s like this. When everything is so…so…
Song: Ready to Go (Vices & Virtues)
Sherlock’s first instinct was to stay right where he was. The bruise on his jaw still covered most of the area, obscenely darkened in different shades of purple and yellow. Lestrade had expressed concern he first time he saw Sherlock on a case three days before- without John, was the doctor seemed to spend more time at the surgery (probably to spend less time with Sherlock)- but was unable to get the detective to talk to him. Sherlock kind of wished he would have been able to let the DI in on the true reason behind the bruise and John’s absence, maybe ask him what to
Maybe they’re not ready.
Even a relaxed Sherlock, was still a Sherlock, after all.
“If you read somewhere between the lines of ‘Is the lunatic still keeping you occupied?’”
he had made of himself. Or even better, he shouldn’t have been drinking at all. He shouldn’t have been following John at all. He should have stayed and make notes and then wait for John like a decent human being. What had he even been thinking to follow the doctor and Gavin in that ghastly establishment? Nothing. Nothing at all. “This is it” he mused bitterly to himself. “I’m loosing my mind”.
Not happening.
Sherlock hummed, before burying his face comfortably in the space between John’s shoulder blades. The fabric of the doctor’s T-Shirt was soft against his cheeks and he sighed contently. It was his most favourite place, with John in his arms- John’s heartbeat against his palm that he pressed right above his heart- and John’s smell all around him, and Rosie pushing up against his other palm, still fast asleep, asking subconsciously for some head scratches. Sherlock obliged willingly.
John would have never guessed that Sherlock could dance like that. He also would have never guessed that Sherlock could laugh like that; that Sherlock could so genuinely enjoy himself like he did at the wedding.
"Sherlock?" The tone of John's voice made him sob.
And Sherlock’s brain would go offline immediately when John used

John laughed sleepily, hushing Rosie, who was stirred by the sudden movement of his chest.

"You don’t have to be embarassed" John tried to prove his hypothesis about Sherlock's current emotional state. "Whatever you want, it'll be fine".
“I’m sorry” The doctor peeked through his fingers, surprised. Sherlock had never apologized to him. For nothing. Now, it seemed like this sentence couldn’t convey more meaning. “John… I... I’m so
The four men sat in comfortable silence for several minutes; the cackling of the fire and soft murmur of the wind the only sound around them.
He must have noticed, then.
pirate ship; which they had ‘sailed’ when Sherlock must have been the same age as Rosie was now.
– but it's important to me" John massaged his temples, a technique to calm his nerves adviced from his therapist. A small silence followed where Mycroft probably irritated his John with his tedious shenanigans. To Sherlock's surprise, a small smile of triumph appeared on the doctor’s face.
John had been home at Baker Street for one month; Sherlock had come back to the living three months ago. The doctor didn’t take it well, at first. There was arguing, and screaming, and denial, and anguish. John refused to even see Sherlock, let alone live with him, and for a few hellish weeks Sherlock seriously thought he had lost his only friend over a stupid nurse he met at the surgery. He was on the verge of another drug relapse. He didn’t know how he brought up the strength to resist. He was glad he did, though. One day, John was back at his doorstep; soaking wet from the rain, a stormy expression on his face, with two large suitcases in tow. They were together again.
By the two-hour mark, John feels sweaty, exhausted, and exhilarated.
So far, Sherlock didn’t even comment on the bed-situation. His nonchalance made John feel silly for being so touchy about it with Bobby.
He filled John’s mug to the brim –
“You’re making a mistake”
Only that he’s happy with Sherlock.
was he trying to proof?
So, all what was left was…. Sherlock groaned. Playing nice at the visit of
Greg read the message again and couldn’t ignore the giddy feeling it was giving him in the pit of his stomach. Maybe… Sherlock was right. Maybe making a move wasn’t the worst idea.
Lestrade had talked to the little girl in his calm inspector voice, coaxing her into taking his hand. She didn't put much of a fight, but there was a certain dullness in her eyes. She smiled at the nice inspector, but didn't say a word. Her smile didn't make it to her dead eyes, and Sherlock felt sweat run down his back (Why was it too hot in here? The heat was making one nauseous!).
Perhaps he still felt daring when he entered Sherlock’s/their bedroom 15 minutes later. He had expected to just grab his dressing gown (he forgot to take it with his pajamas to the bathroom) and persuade Sherlock to join him for an early night (to maybe… continue what he had started. Or never mention it again).
Bobby, Tan, and Jonathan simultaneously stop to clutch at each other, squealing. They talk over each other, overly excited: “Oh my God, they’re living together!” “How do I look?!” “I wanna touch his gorgeous hair!!!”
Mycroft rubbed the edge of the stray-hat defensively. “I look weather-appropriate.”
He could lie. He could at least try it. But he was tired and Sherlock was finally there- the only thing he had needed for days and now he was holding back solely because of his pride. His tries would be in vain anyway, since Sherlock had probably figured him out within the first 30 seconds of his appearance on the crime scene. This wasn’t about knowledge. This was about trust. Something, he had to admit, he still struggled with in this relationship. A painful reminder that although the fall remained nothing more than a distant memory most of the time, it still lingered underneath the surface. Not that they ever talked about it. Sherlock had explained himself and somewhere along the lines it suddenly was all “fine”, because there was Mary, and Mary kept him sane when Sherlock went away; but he came back and the tables turned, and once again the only safety under his feet was pulled away violently. The last year had been a confusing mess of suddenly facing the wonders of parenthood alone; of re-discovering negative emotions he thought he had overcome by then; of the blooming relationship between him and his best friend. John Watson was a simple man. Somewhere along the lines of cases and surgery and sorting out his own emotions, he sometimes got overwhelmed. Sometimes, the world was simply too much. The doctor felt the feeling of helplessness seep through him and chill his insides as he met the worry in Sherlock’s stormy eyes. The least he could do was being honest when Sherlock had figured him out.
“Sherlock however…,” he trailed off; and really, that was all the information Greg needed. Sherlock Holmes wasn’t exactly a ray of sunshine.
. 'No" he wanted to say, but his voice didn't leave his lips. Instead, a strong punch of East Wind hit the air right out of his lungs. "I have John" He wouldn't die here alone (he heard screaming. Was he screaming?). The pressure on his torso intensified, as if someone was holding him (John? John...) He clung to the heavy sensation like one would cling to a lifebelt in the middle of the ocean.
“Who now works at a local surgery and is a part-time blogger for his best friend Sherlock Holmes-“
He’d cough and cover his mouth, so nobody would see his dopey smile. It would give them away, instantly. And John really wasn’t too keen on Scotland Yard gossiping about his relationship status, when he himself wasn’t sure about it. All he knew was that he didn’t feel confident enough to drag it out into the open just yet. The something between them, whatever it was, felt much too fragile, much too private to share it with the world, at least for now. It needed time to grow, and privacy. A safe space.
like this before. And what did he have to give? So many broken pieces. Way too many broken pieces.
John opened his eyes, to look down at Sherlock in surprise. Of course, he had thought about it. Or rather… daydreamed about it. It seemed highly unlikely, thinking about Sherlock ever wanting to retire, let alone grow old with ordinary John Watson. Almost impossible. A new surge of affection welled up in his chest.
After a small amount of time was spend in this fashion- John stubbornly ignoring Sherlock, and Sherlock regarding him with an unreadable, searching look- the commercial break seemed to break the spell between them.
BUT Sherlock wrapped up a case only the night before and John has been navigating between early shifts, helping Sherlock as best as he could, and being a dad; so the flat isn’t really cluttered (alright. The
“John, I advise you, do calm down-“
- against his back. A complicated feeling swelled within him, when he once more realized that he had lost this curious man two years ago, and had him back now- safe, sane, alive, and bickering.
Miscommunication leads to hurt feelings.
‘Sad sight’ might be the theme of the day, John thinks to himself, when he watches his closet (still standing in Rosie’s nursery) being turned inside out. He didn’t even realize he owned this many poorly-fitting jumpers. While British Guy merrily throws everything to the floor, Blonde Guy engages him in conversation about the room. They hadn’t had the time to really make it homey, it’s practical, but not pretty. The guy (
“Because it’s working”
“Not necessarily, no.”
“What the hell!!!” “Gross!!!” “My design team is not touching that!!!”
.  A scientist, a genius, a hero in his own particular way and yet ... a child, driven by a need to understand the world around him, to understand the causal happenings of the whole universe, simply because he hated to not understand. A kind soul who pretends not to care about anyone or anything, but who escapes into the sweet lure of addiction whenever the world and his own existence gets too much. A scarred heart, controlled by a brilliant, yet sometimes cruel mind. A mind he seeks to always occupy so it wouldn't overwhelm him. Sitting in a golden cage to keep distance to everyone around him, because
He was glad; they talked and were honest with each other, like he hoped they would, yet he knew that the tenderness of the moment was fragile and fleeting.
“Fuck, Sherlock”
After around two hours wasted on the most boring case in history, Sherlock was greeted with a pink explosion that must have erupted in their kitchen. It was everywhere, covered every surface neatly and most of John’s clothes.
It was the moments where John asked himself if he loved Sherlock. Of course, he loved him, as a best friend, but somehow this status sometimes didn't feel like it was enough. After all, he had so many things to be thankful for, and if any other person evoked this amount of feelings in him he wouldn't have hesitated to take the relationship to the next level. But Sherlock wasn't any other person. Sherlock was different, so different and innocent in his own way, that John couldn't risc the fragile bond by rushing into things.
Figuring laughter would probably wake the wrong reaction, he instead shifted a little bit, that his own erection was lightly poking a milky white tight. How had he not realized before that Sherlock wore nothing more than a tight pair of black cotton boxers, which left his strong thighs exposed in a casual, yet sensual way? How did he miss the way those boxers were now stretching telltale over a sizeable bulge in his crotch?
Somehow, she reminded John very much of Mary in this posture, which did nothing to improve his situation. ‘She would have known how to handle this’ the thought pained him and he tried to push it down, but it kept returning to the surface. ‘She would have been the right amount of stern and gentle; she would have been a good mother. What the fuck are
RUDE.
John sighed again. He really needed to focus at the task at hand. Spacing out during the statement of the suspect's mother was a bit not good. Although the distressed woman only confirmed the deductions Sherlock had made about 10 minutes after entering the "crime scene". It wasn't much of a crime scene, actually. Social services could have done just as well, but terrified parents called Scotland Yard after their children returned from the subsects home with severe wounds, too scared to say anything. They placed their bets on a child molester. What they found had been something out of a complete different direction. It was a down-right tragedy, to be frank.
“I swear to God, I don’t care where you spend your evening, Sherlock. Just stay. Away. From. Me”
John consciously knows that this has been part of it, but he still feels kind of heavy when he closes the door behind the five fabulous tornados.
So now, as he stood on the pavement and tried desperately to reason with his very uncooperative daughter, he felt the very opposite of assured. He felt the very opposite of proud and strong and badass Captain John Hamish Watson – doctor, ex-soldier, crime fighter, his daughter’s superhero. Instead, he felt as if all the people walking by judged this poor excuse of a father they saw. A pretty pathetic guy who had ‘overextension’ written all over his forehead. He couldn’t even handle calming his Rosie’s mood when she was a mere toddler. Did he seriously think at times that he passed as a decent father?
“Mission is pretty clear, I’d say,” Tan comments, while turning into Baker Street.
. Because John trusted him with this vulnerable part of himself; it was a gift; it was important … big …significant and…. Overwhelmingly real. Sherlock just wanted to take care of John. Because John deserved it. John deserved everything.
Just this once… he had wished that this rule did not apply.
of those things. He’d later realized that he had acted incredibly stupid. That he reacted, before he thought about it. But in that moment, nothing else mattered, but getting John awake. Getting John out of there. He started out with shakingly calling his name, and when the doctor didn’t stir, he made the panicked decision to
for John. The problem was his fault. It was only fair that the solution was his doing as well. All this time he spent moaning over why John would never be in love with him, could have been invested in actually giving John something about him to love. He shouldn’t have left John alone with it. He wouldn’t leave John alone with it, anymore.
John hadn’t been moving for approximately 30 seconds and Sherlock was losing his mind. His heart was beating in his throat, and the patch of skin peeking out from his ridden up pajama top, where John’s palm rested, was burning. Everything was tingly. He never felt like this. He didn’t know how to work with this… sensations. All he knew, that he very embarrassingly longed for more. Everything John was willing to give him, he’d happily take at this point. If only his blogger would
Sherlock had set them up, with John’s back comfortably resting against Sherlock’s stomach, and the detective’s lanky legs enclosing his sturdy thighs. The points of contact, of warmth, helped him calm, until he was basically laying boneless against his friend. They settled on watching a bunch of animal documentaries on Discovery channel. John’s mind calmed with the images of a natural world that was completely detached from his insecurities and worries. Before he knew it, he felt comfortable with himself again; enough so that he allowed himself some soft giggles when Sherlock corrected the narrator’s monologue about wild bees. Sherlock paused. John turned his head a little to see what had brought this on, and immediately regretted it. The detective was looking at him
It's about time they open up about their feelings.
He was quiet the whole drive back to the yard. Sherlock caught the suspect, of course. Unfortunately, said suspect was armed and not very happy with the change of events, so Lestrade and his team arrived just on time to keep the man from stabbing the arrogant, unarmed so-called genius right in his arrogant, unprotected gut. Sherlock, of fucking course, seemed oblivious to John’s sour mood. He actually had the indecency to bicker the whole way about the “unnecessary interruption”, for he, the great wonderful all-knowing Sherlock fucking Holmes had everything under fucking control. Control, the only thing holding a very angry army doctor back of slapping this insufferable asshole next to him, partner or not. John Watson was a patient man. Sherlock Holmes was extraordinarily good in wearing this patience thin.
cried. At least…. Not when he knew Sherlock would notice. An unwanted memory of a graveyard on a rainy Monday afternoon forced itself into Sherlock’s mind. He stomped it down.  That was then, this is now.
And he is
Just because he actually came to terms with it, doesn’t mean that Sherlock would.
Of course, a caring Sherlock was nevertheless always a Sherlock, but oh! John was so thankful for it. It was his special way of thinking and structuring the world that made the genius so unique and utterly fascinating in John’s eyes. He admired Sherlock for all his brilliancy; and admired him even more when he learned that the non-existence of a verbal filter could have its positive sides.
John touches the scar with his palm. He can’t see it currently because he wears his old trusty sleep t-shirt, but he knows it’s there.
A sharp cry. Located next to Lestrade, belonging to a 10-year-old boy. Sherlock forced his head to turn to the left. His breath hitched at the sight. The way the young officer held the devastated child back was sickly familiar. Her brother, obviously, the kin was undeniably for the eye. As well as the signs of physical violence (Sherlock felt like he should sit down). "Don't" the boy begged, voice hoarse with an ugly mixture of tears and mucus. "She doesn’t mean it, she just doesn’t know...please don't take her away!" (He felt dizzy). He struggled against the strong arms, but it was no use, his exhausted muscles couldn't compete to the steady grip-
Later that day, John Watson congratulated himself on a job well done. Mycroft had left eventually, after filling all the blank spots in Sherlock’s memory. The more they reconstructed, the more at ease the younger brother seemed to become. Even the ice-man gingerly melted from time to time, when he retold a silly childhood story or shared a memory of their beloved grand-mére.
The moment John’s warm palm pressed gently against his clothed erection, something inside of him exploded. Unable to stop or control it, he let out a long moan, all muscles in his body going rigid, and a violent orgasm washed over him.
late, and the doctor didn’t give two flying fucks about it. This might be the most important moment of his life since Rosie was born, and he wouldn’t let it be ruined by his schedule. Or so he thought bravely, so he was ready to voice it and in a fit of passion throw the sneaky detective against the wall to show him that John Three Continents Watson wasn’t just some blushing virgin that shut down because a fucking Michelangelo kissed him- until everything deflated when he met Sherlock’s eyes.
In that moment, Mycroft saw a glimpse of the little boy that was still hiding somewhere deep inside the heart of the extraordinary man he grew up to be. His heart grew three sizes.
He felt a little bit like throwing up his own heart.
anything.
everything. Suddenly feeling re-surfaced he didn’t know he was still capable of, suddenly a desire arose within him that he couldn’t know how to control. He just wanted- that smile, and that kiss, and the gruff voice just after waking up, and the crinkling of his nose while figuring out a blog-post, and the chase, the excitement, the approval- John. He just wanted John.
Leave me a comment, some kudos, or a bookmark (or all, if you feel crazy) to let me know if you liked it.
John had been stupid enough to believe their romantic entanglement would change the tables. He actually believed that Sherlock would consider his feelings (or anything expect for the suspect for that matter) before he dived head first into careless dangerous situations. They talked about it. John promised Sherlock he wouldn’t have to change for them to work out. Always the consulting detective first, the partner and parent second. BUT he had hoped. He had hoped Sherlock would see. He had hoped Sherlock would understand. They were raising a child together. There was so much to lose. Something worth being careful about, something worth to not carelessly play with your own life. He had hoped and he had been proven wrong.
“Oh, absolutely.”
“I haven’t considered that before” John wanted to scream. Seriously, this guy would be the death of him.
“Are you nervous?”
Sherlock lost his serious expression for a split second to give John a little grin. “Everything’s fine. More than fine, actually” he circled his doctor’s waist with his arms, pulling them flush together. John pushed against his chest, gently.
John made a vague noise of agreement. He felt slightly bad for being so non-verbal on Greg who had always been a good friend, but couldn’t help himself. Of course, Sherlock was brilliant. Sherlock wasn’t the problem here. Discreetly, he rubbed his aching leg.
, right?"
. John always seemed to care. For others, for himself, for Sherlock's transport, his moods, his well-being.
“I, uh, I mean-“
like it did. Maybe he thought John was something special. Maybe he had been wrong.
“Oh my God, he’s a celebrity,” Bobby’s fanning himself some air. “Wait, didn’t he like die?!”
John was patient with Sherlock’s struggles with coping with sentiment. It was fine, most of the time, really. He enjoyed watching him learn. He could ignore a harsh word or two, spoken without thinking about the emotional consequences. But not today. John felt like the air was forcefully knocked out of his lungs.
John stares at the door. Rosie and Sherlock get along great; Sherlock spends a lot of time with her when no case is on (the evenings, when John returns from work and sees these two after a long day, are his favorite. Something about this kind of domesticity warms his heart).
Without thinking too much about it, Mycroft started pointing out constellations, explaining how and why they were shaped the way they were. Greg hummed in affirmation from time to time; and when Mycroft looked over his shoulder, he caught sight of his little brother. Because that’s who he was in that very moment, not the genius master detective, just Sherlock. He had his knees drawn up to his chest, arms wrapped around them securely, his head thrown back to catch the grandeur of the night sky.
something, to show him how he felt; all this time the missing link had been right there, underneath his nose, and he had just been too blind to acknowledge it. All these little everyday things, things Sherlock did not bother with before, were meant to show that he
unusual” the detective mumbled.
“We’ll take a small break,” he tells the camera team, who shrugs and busies itself with getting some footage of Karamo and Jonathan playing with Rosie.
“I’m aroused.”
“We’ll figure it out” he whispered. If he was reassuring himself or the sleeping detective, he wasn’t so sure.
Right on the brink of consciousness, John repeats some facts he can be sure of:
“Sherlock?”
He searched for words to describe his confused emotional state but failed. He missed years of practice for this kind of conversation; and found to his utter horror that he was completely unprepared. Better stick with a train of thought he was familiar with:
Sherlock snorted.
‘No problem- GL’
. He knew and he wanted nothing more than Sherlock's full and utter happiness. Another strong emotion overcame John in these early morning hours. He gripped his mug for support and took some deep breaths. His heart swell and felt tight with a strange mixture of emotions. He pinched the bridge of his nose a few times.
about them.
normal for John, that he was just being nice, because Sherlock had been having hard time, that all of this didn’t
"Need I to remind you that Sherlock basically made me part of your wonderful family, dearest brother mine? Or shall I just start calling you petnames instead?"
“I’m scared” he admitted quietly. “I’m scared whenever you’re not around that you… you leave again. Because I’m… I’m broken, aren’t I? I thought I got myself fixed but… it feels like breaking all over again. I” he hiccupped quietly, letting out an almost pained sound. “I should be mad at you, for deceiving me. But I’m not, Sherlock.”
“You were wrong”
Sherlock shrugged and drew him in for another kiss, enjoying how the light of the fire bathed him in a warm glow that only amplified the warmth he felt in his heart.
Why didn’t John
“Your psychosomatic limp is acting up again” It wasn’t a question, like almost nothing was a question out of Sherlock’s mouth.
Waking up with Sherlock in the room does wonders for his mood. Something about the fact that the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was Sherlock bouncing Rosie, the morning light catching both of their curls made him indescribable happy (he could get used to this).
John’s quiet laugh feels warm and familiar against the idle sound of their knives scraping against the cutting boards.
This time, Sherlock didn’t even bother with controlling his expression. His lips formed into a pout. “I want to spend time with you”
Mycroft paused, not even registering the enthusiastic approval of their little captain. Sherlock held his gaze shortly, before he looked away.
The quiet murmur of the rented mini-van was the only sound in the air on the beautiful summer afternoon; the afternoon Gregory Lestrade would take his family on an awesome trip.
Well. Technically that was true but… that wasn’t the point. ‘Right, the point is that you’re being a dick about something I care about, shutting the two people who constantly worry about you out’, Mind-John offered with a sly smirk.
"This is about Sherlock, for fuck's sake-" By the sound of his name, the detective was jerked out of his momentarily trip to his Mind Palace. His ears perked up. He was the content of the mysterious phone call! This was getting better by the second, what a great puzzle to keep his mind occupied! He wondered whom John could possibly talking about him-
„Sherlock, I’ve got him!“ His voice was raspy, because of the exertion of the tackle he just performed; his thighs hurt like hell, because of the hellish sprint; and he was soaked right to the bones, because he had been sweating like crazy. Yet, John Watson couldn’t remember a moment during the last few weeks in which he felt more
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to be defensive. “Problem, landlubber?”
His life is about to be turned upside-down.
to him?!
Sherlock nodded, dumbly. “I want to be her legal guardian as well” he added, quietly. “That she can grow up with a real family”
Mycroft wasn't there, it was his head playing tricks on him, but the pain was here and it was real and he was real. He felt like running forever in his dizzy state, but in reality, he barely made it around the front door. Sherlock faintly registered John's jogging steps right behind him.
Tomorrow, they’ll be home again.
“I won’t do it again, I promise!” the detective interrupted him loudly, desperation written all over his face. John normally would second-guess the honesty of this statement; Sherlock was an extraordinary liar, so much so that he didn’t even realize he made a promise he couldn’t keep. But something was… different about this exclamation. Something big and complex, something which made John’s heart swell with fondness for the man in his arms.
“That you’ll run out of reasons to stay with me.”
“I’m not debating about this”
‘I’m fine’ the doctor wanted to answer, deeply mortified that his friend and half a dozen other Yarders saw him
“Really? You’d ask me out?”
“Thanks for deserting me, git,” the doctor replies just as quietly, but the insult is lost in a smile. Sherlock does that to him, these days.
“Sorry mate, I better get after Sherlock-“ he started, standing up.
Is he?
Sherlock felt the body in his embrace tense up. He reacted immediately: “I’m sorry I didn’t notice sooner.” John sucked in a sharp breath, because, really Sherlock shouldn’t need to notice “it” sooner, there shouldn’t be an “it” to notice at all. Why was there always an “it” with him? Why hadn’t he felt
his priority’. And maybe throw in some corny joke about how the British Government wouldn’t be very amused when his little brother endangered the Queen by having a family weekend. Instead he chewed on his lower lip. Eyed Rosie laughing so carelessly. Sherlock smiling so brightly. Sherlock met his eyes over the crown of Rosie’s head when he gave her a kiss on the nose.
“How’s my favourite bug?” he cooed, which caused Rosie to laugh delighted about her uncle’s warm greeting.
Apparently, three things: 1.) Waking up alone with no Sherlock anywhere to be seen, probably off to some case John couldn’t be
Sherlock, obviously misinterpreting the silence, huffed annoyed: “Fine, don’t speak to me, then. I’m trying to be helpful, for the first time in my life, and I’m trying to make up for the sorrow I’ve caused you, but I guess my attempts are not very welcome.”
The detective swallowed around the lump in his throat and just knew that he
John snorted a little. “Have you met the Holmes brothers?”
There was a silence among the listeners, because each single one of them was reminded what a strong, exceptional, kind, and simply incredible human being was telling them with an unbelievable tranquillity about not loosing your humanity under inhuman circumstances.
Antoni regards him carefully for a minute. “You didn’t upset him. We get that a lot, it comes as a risk with the job, so to speak. But… we worry that you might make yourself unhappy when you cling too tightly to a concept of what your sexuality is supposed to be. And if that gets in your way of being truly happy, maybe it’s time to let go of the things holding you back.”
And at this very moment, when his daughter tried in earnest to contain the hitching sobs escaping her tightly closed lips, John felt his heart break a little. (Not that a crack could damage this very crisis proved heart of an unbelievably strong man who had endured enough loss and sorrow to last a lifetime. But the sheer fact that his Rosie was the cause made a papercut feel like a gunshot wound). The doctor closed his eyes for the split of a second to compose himself, before he tried to put on his brightest caring smile. It was forced. They both knew it.
Just when he thought he might blurt out something sentimentally and stupid, Sherlock himself called Lestrade over. The inspector crooked a questioning eyebrow in John’s direction to which the doctor replied with a shrug. He had a faint idea that it might involve the little bunnies Sherlock had been promising, but really couldn’t quite understand what the genius needed Lestrade for. John didn’t try to eavesdrop, but gathered that Greg was the chosen one to show Rosie the kits in the garden (had his mood been a bit better, he would have given a hearty laugh at Sherlock’s confident use of the name ‘Graham’ and Lestrade’s frustration about it).
“Or by the sea. One of those romantic land houses you secretly adore” He stopped the motion and raised his eyes shyly. The fond smile his doctor gave him was enough to make his heart do funny things in his chest. As John cupped his cheek and just continued to smile at him, Sherlock suddenly felt nervous and bit his lip.
“You’re acting funny, today”
. Did he always sound like such an insensitive prick when he said that? He did never notice. Without wanting to, he imagines that he might have hurt someone’s feelings with throwing this sentence around so carelessly (he prays that he didn’t offend Jonathan or Bobby- they’re helping him, after all).
“Ladies, keep your panties on,” Karamo laughs.
John doesn’t know why, but he feels flustered and giddy at the compliment. Tan is a drop-dead gorgeous man, himself, yet somehow the approving words feel genuine. Like he’s not just saying that.
“You’re a tit, do you know that?”
“Sherlock’s been better, I noticed” Greg mused thoughtfully, as thoughtful as you can be when you’re nursing your third pint. “He scared me, when he was breaking down like that. Thought he’d need a long way to come back on track. But he’s as chipper and arrogant as ever” He laughed, then grinned toothily. “Whatever it is you’re doing, don’t stop. It’s working”
They’re both overreacting, John thinks.
Without further ado, he bent closer to the trembling figure- surprised as the teacup was knocked out of his hand, soaking the sheets completely, with the force of John’s sudden movement. He nothing but threw himself into the detective’s arms. It was messy- there’s tea, and snot, and sweat- it was also awkward- Sherlock is half kneeling on the bed to keep himself upright, while John buried his face against his friend’s neck while his hands clung frantically onto Sherlock’s dress shirt. The shirt Sherlock noted absently, dampened rapidly from a mixture of sweat and tears.
Better to make his whole mess of a life not more complicated than it already is.
, he asked himself when the detective would stop taking pity on him. Their relationship had changed, and John wished he wouldn’t rely on Sherlock like he did. He

And John was late- it was already one in the afternoon- and what John just didn’t come back this time, what if John just left- God, he couldn’t possibly go on if that was the case and- John was never late and- no, it couldn’t end, not this time, he had tried to be good, he really did, but of course he wasn’t enough for he was always “just not enough”- but John was good, the best damn thing- and
. John’s heartbeat was far too frantic, he could feel it thrumming through his veins uncomfortably, and his skin was clammy and cold, goosebumps surrounding the warmth of Sherlock’s grip. He was mortified.
Sherlock swallowed audibly and concentrated very hard on the circling motion of his fingers. “Once ... you know, Rosie’s out of the house. Once we’ve retired” he explained hurriedly, as if embarrassed of thinking about their future together.
The real John wasn’t easy to understand, like his Mind-John was, Sherlock mused. Real John kept his thoughts and intentions private, he was an endless mystery the detective couldn’t figure out. Sometimes he would look at Sherlock like…. that. He didn’t know which emotion it contained, but its intensity never failed to make his heart flutter. Why, sentiment was a tedious thing.
It was a sight he could get used to- a flustered Sherlock held a certain charm to himself that the doctor felt himself been drawn to. Just another side of Sherlock he slowly unwrapped, to learn a little bit more about the fascinating man behind the billowing code and snarky intellect. This Sherlock was almost… cute? He held an innocence, a genuine wonder that John really couldn’t explain. All he knew was that he wanted to see more of him.
“I’d like to kiss you, now, if that’s alright” Was John even
John sighs fondly to himself and shakes his head at the impossible man that is Sherlock Holmes. How somebody could be so unbelievably smart and so unbelievably stupid at the same time, John would never know.

It really had been a long time coming. John couldn't even blame Sherlock, the last months had been too much for them. Especially for the self-declared, certainly not so sociopathic sociopath.
“And I want to catch up with Greg” John smiled softly, signaling Sherlock that he didn’t mean harm in his objection. But also that he wouldn’t budge. Although he loved seeing Sherlock this clingy, this excited to be with him; he’d need to establish boundaries, or else Sherlock would think he’d get what he wanted if he just pulled the emotional card on John. Not that he was already trying and succeeding this most of the time, but the doctor liked to think he would get some resemblance of control over the situation.
They were in love. And, really, that was kind of terrifying too, but the best kind.
“I’m not sure,” he finally says, tone carefully neutral. “As I’ve gathered, it’s supposed to be an occasion solely reserved for the children’s caretakers. I don’t want to impose myself upon it.”
If someone had told him a few years ago, that he would consider the snarky detective and the stubborn doctor his family, he would have flipped them off. But here they were; John and Sherlock were a thing now (not married but the closest they would ever get to it), Rosie was officially their daughter, and he and Mycroft started dating a few months back and were the proudest pair of uncles.
It was the soft baritone rumble that did it; this damn velvet voice breaking him every time; no matter if it was throwing deductions all over the place or whispering profanities in the bedroom. Without a word, John locked his partner in a bone-crushing hug; circling the thin, elegantly clad waist in a strong hold and buring his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock made a small surprised sound at the sudden display of affection (after all, John was the one constantly worrying about the things people might talk about, even after they confirmed the rumours about their relationship), but gained his composure back and returned the sentiment eagerly (after all, he couldn’t care less; people always talked, they did little else).
'Sherlock Holmes doesn’t do nightmares my ass' John thought, as he had already figured out the real motivation behind the unusual request. Sherlock was afraid of nightly terrors. But since John was an expert on those, he took the invitation and hoped that his nearness and warmth would help to keep them at bay.
“Sherlock” he started in his calm doctor-voice “Do you hear me? Do you know where you are?” Said Sherlock abruptly snapped his head to face John directly, making his own neck crack with the suddenness of the movement. The blinking stopped suddenly, and instead he watched Sherlock’s face go into deduction-mode. Oh well, whatever made him happy, John supposed. Sure, an actual answer (or reaction that wasn’t medically suspicious) would have been nice, but as long as the genius wasn’t bolting on him, John considered it a success. Sort of.
And here he stops himself, doesn’t allow the automatic response to roll off his tongue. Instead, he finishes with “pining” which sounds lame and unconvincing even to his own ears.
“Where are you going?”
“I just love you,” he murmured against John’s lips, nothing more than a breath.
Greg honked twice and drummed a little melody with his fingers against the steering wheel, already lost in thoughts about campfires and marshmallows.
“I’m not that posh” Sherlock argued playfully. “I could compete with your filthy mouth any day” He bumped his shoulder against John’s gently. “Git”, he added, for good measure. Another giggle escaped John, but he gravitated into the point of contact, gratefully. The detective placed an arm around John’s shoulder and pulled him into his side.
If there was one thing to know about Sherlock Holmes, it was that he really wasn’t the type to stand around and let himself be accused of hypothetical risks that did not occur. There was another thing to know about Sherlock Holmes, tho. He was a fucking idiot when it came to feelings. Sure, he was getting pretty good with showing affection towards his little family and did a splendid job when coping with John’s insecurities. But still. Quintessentially an idiot. He was that much of an idiot, that he didn’t even realize how hurtful the things were that he could say.
But years of training- first in a war shattered Afghanistan and later in a surgery full of hypochondriac Londoners or crime scenes displaying the deepest, ugliest corner of the human heart- made him a precise alert system for mental break-downs.
So, naturally, the John Watson in question wasn’t at all too eager when he put on his coat to leave for the surgery on one rainy Wednesday morning.  He woke up content, but way too early with a face full of eager toddler, who insisted on “playing before Daddy leaves”. Because he just couldn’t say no to the soft, breathy voice of his little girl calling him “Daddy”, he grumbled playfully, but agreed anyway. She had him wrapped around her little finger, and he was all too willing to do every humanly thing possible to make her happy. Sherlock joined them as a pleasing presence on their early morning lego built mission, and distracted Rosie enough for John to get ready without her being too sad about his inevitable departure. They were in the midst of a discussion about the construction of their second lego castle, when John cleared his throat to announced that he had to leave. He held out his arms for Rosie to give him a hug, and laughed when she skillfully attached herself to his neck instead. “Alright, little monkey” he picked her up and gave her a nose kiss, while she giggled at the nickname. “Daddy, you’re silly”, she smiled widely. Then her expression turned serious. “Daddy comes home, soon?”
He inhaled the familiar smell of his partner, calming his racing heart. He did nothing but breathe on John for at least two minutes, while John instinctively ran a soothing hand through the black curls on the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
anything. The discomfort caused by this thought must have shown in his face, for John’s easy smile turned into a small frown.
The only two attempts of relationships he had ever had ended exactly like this. After the second one, he had stopped trying. After all, he had never been the number one choice for anyone but… but although he… he always knew that it would end like that, he didn’t anticipate that it would end so soon.
Tingly warmth shot through John’s body in pleasant waves. No matter how often Sherlock made sure to say it, it never ceased to touch him so profoundly.
John never once allowed himself to dream that Sherlock wanted to adopt Rosie. That they could be her parents, thoughtfully and unconditionally. His heart leaped in his throat, and he might have started to cry a little bit. Sherlock caressed his slightly trembling shoulders soothingly.
He had even gone so far in trying to manipulate Sherlock into pulling the trigger, to end his life- so the choice wouldn't hurt him so much. He had loved enough to make Sherlock hate him, would have given all of his life without a second thought. Just so that Sherlock could keep John in his life. Because Mycroft
who was excited and eager and aching because of him. The thought alone was almost enough to bring the doctor dangerously close to shooting off like a rocket. Sherlock wasn’t too far off either, judging by the quiver in his thighs.
time in the past hour (he had
The moment Sherlock made eye-contact with Rosie, there was no holding back. The little girl wrung her way out of the (subconsciously defending tightened) grip of her father’s hand and ran towards a slightly crunched down Sherlock. Donovan made another well-timed, low comment about her disbelieve of Sherlock being a good influence for a perfectly
“Are you…. alright?” he asked tentatively. He had Sherlock expected to throw a fit, or sulk, or snap at him; he sure as hell didn’t anticipate to find him in a state of emotional turmoil.
“I’d love to”.
Sherlock's level of annoyance increased the longer his brain simply didn't let the topic of yesterday's weakness go. He let out another groan, louder this time, and slapped his face into the pillow to sulk for a bit. It had been a disaster. Sherlock snorted disdainfully when he pictured what a sight he most likely had been. All redundant body fluids and shaking limps and vulnerable noises. Like a child seeking comfort from his mother. (or in this case from his John).
with that fact for all his life. Then John happened. Then John happened and
Song: Trade Mistakes (Vices and Virtues)
“I know you don’t mean it. The Work dominates your mind, I get it” He nudged Sherlock playfully in the side, hoping to ease the sudden heaviness of the mood. He wasn’t fully sure what was going on, but it felt big and severe and overwhelming. “I’d just be happy if me and Rosie could have a little room in there, too”
By the time he hung up his coat with trembling hands, he was sure he had lost his mind. To overplay the violent flips his stomach was performing, he went into the kitchen to make tea, for tea seemed appropriate to soothe his nerves. He threw two teabags into two mugs angrily, while the kettle beeped at him.
Not understanding was a new, curious experience- one he wasn’t so sure he liked. He felt exposed, completely at John’s mercy; John who seemed to be comfortable and so very sure in this situation.
Life was a curious thing, wasn’t it?
“I’m home!”
“Whoever you’re texting with” he barked irritated. “You’re clearly emotionally invested, but your hesitation to type out a reply indicates that you haven’t made a move yet, you’re nervous and fear rejection” Greg blinked at him for some seconds. “So just ask her out and be done with it, your emotional turmoil is getting on my nerves”
Maybe John was just making believe here, but… they had been sharing a bed for weeks. And Sherlock had been searching his touch not so subtly as he might have thought he did. And he hadn’t stopped blushing since the taxi ride.
He’s doing it for Rosie, too.
The doctor smiled a little more to himself when he put sugar in Sherlock's mug and some milk in his own. He would invite Greg for some pints once Sherlock was better.
"Sherlock" John's voiced reached him like through a veil of heavy cotton. He couldn't hear properly, white noise vibrated in his eardrums. In between was Euros, Euros laughing at him, loud and clear, while she sang that song about the East Wind. He tried to open his eyes, but the muscles wouldn't obey, he felt betrayed by his own body and trapped inside of the golden cage of his mind.  Images of Redbeard, images which seemed to betray him mocked him behind his closed eyelids ...his friend, his only friend, what was his name again?
The merry Lestrade-Holmes-Watson team arrived at their assigned camp spot at the campground that Greg adored since he visited it with his girls, at least a decade ago. He held fond memories in this place and he was excited to make new ones with his new family.
“Yeah”, he coughed awkwardly in a weak attempt to give Sherlock another explanation for his sudden increase of body temperature (Sherlock didn’t buy it). “I should get going” John didn’t miss the tiny flash of disappointment in Sherlock’s eyes when he turned to face the doorknob. John also didn’t miss the slight hunch in the detective’s posture when he realized John wouldn’t comment on the kiss. Or repeat it.  The detective visibly retreated into his mind-palace, probably to analyze what had went wrong.
Karamo and Antoni roll their eyes fondly at their friend’s antics.
John held up his hand to stop the undoubtedly excited monologue about bees that was about to follow.
“Now, sleep time.”
John is too astonished about all of this to pretend he’s humble about the way he looks right now. Because, damn, he looks
“I’m sorry it took me longer than usual, I fetched a little something for you on my way back” he unceremoniously dropped a small wrapped box into the detective’s lap, who was stunned into silence. He just gawked at his friend, like he had suddenly grown an extra head.
Well…. excited and scared.
, overwhelmed him.
"Stop" Sherlock whimpered, begging his mind to cease the torture. But Euros sang, and sang and dead eyes smiled at him and he still couldn't remember the damn NAME (his knees scraped the ground, sharp stones ripped open his trouser legs. When did he kneel?) Still he couldn't open his eyes, he couldn't get OUT. Panic caught him like a powerful wave and for the first time in thirty years, the great Sherlock Holmes felt utterly terrified.
John shifted a little, in an attempt to take some weight off his aching leg. “Still…” he trailed off, feeling his neck and ears grow warm under his partners intense gaze.
He wasn’t good enough for this. He couldn’t handle this. He had failed. He failed Mary and he failed his daughter. He felt the echo of the pain in his leg return to him, reminding him of all the other things he had failed at in his lifetime. His hands were shaking violently now. He tried to calm his breathing before he worked himself up into an anxiety attack, the kind of which he had when his PTSD dominated his life. ‘You’re the adult here' he tried to remind himself. ‘You’re in charge. She
'Euros. Trigger. Small meltdown- JW' John typed awkwardly with one hand (How he wished Sherlock was there to witness his moment of clumsiness, he would have really enjoyed poking fun at him).
And that it would
“How would you know?”
They were really doing this.
“But I love you. And I love Rosie. And I love our… family. You’re more important than... work. You… saved my life. You keep saving my life over and over again and I can’t… live without you. I’m sorry that my actions…. Caused you to doubt the sincerity of my emotions. I will never… again make you feel so…. helpless”
His eyes flickered momentarily to John, seeking his friend’s approval and visibly glowing under the doctor’s approving nod. Mycroft was seemingly baffled for the second time that day.
Rosie only gave a nod and fisted his shirt. John then realized that he forgot to take her stuffed animal (a bee, Sherlock absolutely loved it) along when he brought her to kindergarten this morning; because he had been in a hurry; because he had spent too much time being upset about Sherlock’s absence. Great. Incapable of parenting, thank you very much.
“Are you okay?”
In the moment he closed his mouth, he spotted Sherlock coming back into his field of vision (he had gone upstairs with Lestrade, John recalled, to search for the mentally ill girl, who was the culprit of all this mess). Now that he thought about it, he shouldn't have let him. Not that he, John Watson, was in any position to tell the great Sherlock Holmes what to do. But he really should have tried (and maybe this once, Sherlock would have listened).
Darkness had settled over the woods and the four men were all huddled in blankets around the campfire. It was a mild night, the blankets more for the comfort than anything else, while they were roasting marshmallows over the fire.
It was easy.
and let the warmth from the detective’s shirt warm his face. He sighed, suddenly overcome by a powerful emotion.
It’s well into the fifth outfit they tried out and he looks handsome in. Every. Single. One. Of. Them.
When the expected reply never came, John actually paused cleaning and turned around, raising an eyebrow. When he saw the solemn expression on his partner’s face, he chuckled nervously. “Something up? You’re acting more funny than usual”
“Crept into the wrong tent.”
After some seconds of emotional kissing, Sherlock placed his forehead gently against John’s and ran his fingers through the older man’s hair. The gesture was so tender and so intimate, that the doctor’s pulse sped up immediately. This. He had been waiting for this all week. Sherlock. Sherlock and his gentle ways he never thought he could have; Sherlock and the connection he didn’t thing he would share with anyone; Sherlock and his velvet baritone and warm hugs; Sherlock being
1.) Sherlock is an attractive man.
Sherlock let out a pained groan and buried his face in his knees, closing himself in as far as possible. There were a few moments of silence and Greg thought awkwardly about what he was going to do if Sherlock actually had an emotional breakdown on his office carpet.
Tea, and crimes, weird experiments, and body parts in fridges. Take-away and crap telly, and giggles at crime scenes, and shared smiles. The doctor loved it. He loved every single second of it.  John was
Everything is still so new and fresh and delicate. But, somehow, John feels like this- this right here- has been in the making for several years. That everything they went through ultimately lead to them being right here, next to each other, in the early hours in the morning.
Then, as casually and as graceful as one with a shit-eating grin plastered to their face could, Sherlock draped himself against the doorframe. He studied John’s impression of a fish out of the water bemused. “Don’t think in such a language, John, there is a child present”. Right. ‘Get out of my fucking head’, John wanted to say. Instead, his mouth made an adventurous attempt to get to the core of the situation: “I….. you.. I mean
He closed his eyes and tried again- still, no light. Conclusion? Not his bedroom. He blinked, his mind still lulled in the drowsiness of one who had just awoken from his slumber. The first thing he heard was the chirping of birds reaching his ears. There was a tree in front of Sherlock's bedroom window, but no tree in front of his own. Conclusion? He was in Sherlock's bed. The realization made him slightly more alert, why was he in Sherlock's bedroom?
Why the hell was John
Alright, then.
even possible? “And.. and the dates-“
“I’m sorry about this” he waved his hands around for emphasis, gesturing between them. Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but John continued. “You shouldn’t have to put up with that. With me. I mean, honestly, I’m having troubles keeping up at the best of times, but like this….” He trailed off, angrily frowning at his tea. “I’m basically useless. A stupid broken toy soldier”
So, he ignored the uneasiness bubbling around in his belly and stood, and showered, and made breakfast- all the while just teetering on the edge of a panic attack but willing it away with pure stubbornness. He didn’t have a shift at the surgery today (for this fact he was a tiny bit glad) and had just mentally prepared himself for pottering restlessly around the flat all morning, when his phone flashed with a new message:
Not just a little bit. That hurt a lot more than John thought it would. The wort part was, that Sherlock was beating him at his own game. John realized with a start that they would need to have a conversation about this as soon as Sherlock was sober again, because otherwise the uncertainty would spiral into something destructive.
“What’s with that face? You don’t think you’re attractive?”
Greg considered his next move. The chance of the doctor ending the relationship over a rude comment seemed highly unlikely. But something had been triggered and it was not entirely unlikely that this whole thing ended up with someone getting hurt. Greg didn’t really want to mingle… but Sherlock deserved to know. Sherlock, in a weird Holmes kind of way, was his friend, too. So, he deserved to know with what he was dealing here.
John’s stomach gave a painful churn that had nothing to do with the beer he consumed. He had known the detective long enough to know when he attempted to flirt. And this, was very much flirting.
Surely, his genius brain would understand that this situation was completely different than... and would very kindly tell his hands to stop shaking, if that's not too much to ask for? He drew a shallow breath and observed a small punch of nausea hitting him in the guts. He closed his eyes and tried to block the sounds of a screaming child out, for they somehow made him sick. He mentally rolled his eyes about his own asininity. Sherlock Holmes would not let himself be influenced by repressed feelings attached to a long-forgotten memory of the worst moments of his childhood- he would NOT!
The sudden noise of Sherlock’s text alert made them both jump in surprise. The genius fumbled the device hurried out of his trouser pocket, fingers shaking and clumsy, almost dropping it twice. The screen lighting up his pale face and Greg took the moment of distraction to have a deep breath. Sherlock read the message once, twice, three times before the words made sense to him. He let out a long, relieved exhale.
So, he falsely assumed The Work was a sentiment-free endeavor and carelessly pushed the warning signs of his body aside. He had to admit, he was new to this whole emotion idiocy- but even he had to see that he wasn't as sociopathic as he had hoped. Still, he refused to believe that emotions could influence one of the greatest minds in England. Puny chemicals, hormones, transport... was nothing he couldn't suppress. He has spent years living above these basal reflexes, he surely wouldn’t start to be driven by them at the age of thirty-four. Sherlock Holmes was above sentiment.
