He sees John’s struggle before John even says anything, and he understands beyond any doubt that John wants him, but doesn’t think himself worthy.
Sherlock freezes, blinks into the semi-darkness tinged orange by the street lamps. John has his face in his hands and there is a glass and a bottle on the side table (the port Sherlock got after the dognapping case two weeks ago). It’s too dark for Sherlock to tell how much of the contents are gone. What does this mean?
"Alright, John," the detective spluttered, "give me a moment, will you? You 'require' more ice. I myself, require a spoon." Ears flaming hot, Sherlock practically bolted from the room.
"What?" the detective's eyebrows rose in consternation. "That's a ludicrous statement. You misunderstand what I mean."
Sherlock and John efficiently resolved the issues involved in supporting an ankle; John privately channelled MacGyver.* And oh...John deemed his earlier failures a blessing. Sherlock's refractory period matched that of a fourteen-year-old at a wet t-shirt contest.
on the ceiling, he slapped his art into wet plaster. Plaster dries really fast, I don't know if you knew that...not sure that it ever came up is a case, so...he didn't have a lot of time to dally.
Stuttering to a halt, John swiveled around to goggle at his lover. "Really? The Great Sherlock Holmes, making tea?" He made as if to stagger and lose his balance in shock. "You're kidding, right? Trying to lighten the mood?"
"Oh, fuck, Sherlock. Yeah, keep doing that, just like that," John begged. "But, if you think that I can't multi-task under pressure, then you're sorely mistaken." He squirmed against Sherlock's strong hand. "Don't forget. I was a doctor
John rolled over and stretched, too complacent to open his eyes. The lovers lolled, limbs pretzelled under the sumptuous, down-filled duvet. The doctor cuddled in close, serene and sinfully cozy. He was wake, but not yet firing on all cylinders. John strongly fancied a lie-in, and vague, random thoughts kept him amused.
This story seems to revolve around John's toileting habits. Maybe he should run a personal UA at the surgery. Shattered ankle, crazy flatmate, and on top of that, a raging UTI? Folks, this is John whump in a nutshell.
John screamed, voice rough from overuse. There'd been a lot of screaming orgasms in the last two weeks. "You came untouched! That's fucking
you thought of my silly infatuation. I certainly wasn't going to bring it up if you weren't. I was afraid it would destroy our friendship."
"Now," John stuttered, stymied by the enormity of the task. "Sherlock." Gathering his few remaining brain cells residing in his skull, the doctor gave them a pep talk. He was resolved, and therefore primed to forge ahead with the - plan? Or...something. Plan? Venture? Mission? Extremely personal mandate? No, those terms were far too flippant or trivial for John's purpose. The
When Sherlock finished the process, instead of carefully laying the vest down - like he had last time - he launched it straight out the door. It
"Right. Right. Okay," Lestrade plowed on. "Say it again, Sherlock, only louder this time and without sounding like you're chewing on your shoe.”
"First things first. Into the shower, dear boy, for your desperately desired ablutions. Or, in light of your current condition," Sherlock archly raised one brow, "remain here for a full body sponge bath? Et bien sûr, vous allez vous baigner avec ma gracieuse aide, homme précieux et délicieux."
it was) took over, logic all but abandoned. Sherlock tilted his pelvis, encouraging John to stimulate his prostate. John obliged, as he always did, jamming a pillow under his partner's sweaty bum. This change in the angle was evidently just what the doctor ordered. Sherlock yowled like a cat in flagrante.
In Sherlock's brain, the spastic voice-over of a play-by-play announcer bawled in hysterical amazement, “
are you hinting at?" He leaned into Lestrade's personal space. "About whom are these thing in reference to? Tell me at once, I demand it."
John thought back twenty-four years, to when his sister came out. She'd stood in the kitchen, defiantly tall (which was saying a lot, considering the gene pool of clan Watson). She'd screamed straight in her father's red, alcoholic, wife-beating face that she was a lesbo, a dyke, and a butch. He'd knocked her flat to the floor, kicking her twice in the gut for good measure.
. Lestrade couldn't blame him, considering the frequency with which he'd been subjected to eval. Psychiatrists tended to be patronizing prats. To stick it to Mycroft and the arsehat attending, Sherlock acted out random diagnoses. At best, Sherlock's shenanigans provided him with lukewarm amusement; but mostly, served to kill time. Inevitably, Mycroft lost patience. He'd pull the necessary strings, and Sherlock walked. This craziness, though, was no mere game of a juvenile genius. He judged Sherlock's behavior as very real and unscripted. How Lestrade wished it wasn't so.
The room fell silent as the three men gathered their wits. "Right," Lestrade eventually declared, "let's get this done. I think we're all due for a very long night's sleep." He rubbed his chin in that characteristic way he did when he was wrangling with a conundrum. "Here's the thing, mate. John may have appeared normal enough when you came back - all things as they were, you resurrecting from the dead, and all that lunacy."
The nightmare ran through his unconscious mind like a looping reel of film, set in motion as Sherlock tosses his phone. And then, Sherlock leaps from the roof, arms and legs pinwheeling nonsensically. Next,
"I'm impoverished for the lack of your fabulous cock," Sherlock joyously opined. "In veritably humble supplication, dear one, I meekly appeal to your baser animal nature." Screwing up his face, he wailed, quite pathetically overblown. John huffed out a laugh. Sherlock rather fancied blowing things out of proportion.
in the hallway out of John's line of sight. Out of sight, out of mind, and good riddance. Sherlock sat down besides John.
John quickly did his business, shaking off the last yellowish drop with typical military efficiency. He lingered, though, imagining the coming struggle involved simply standing up to hitch up his denims. His much-maligned, favorite pair of denims, that was.
"Mmmm, mind your words, John, for I mean to keep you forever." Slowly, Sherlock maneuvered one shoulder, and then the other from his shirt. Holding John's eyes with his own, the detective let the black cotton slip down the length of his arms. It fell in a silent pile around his hips. The detective grunted irritably, tossing the expensive shirt to the floor like so much detritus.
Stepping closer to the fireplace, Greg got a probable upshot of John's day. He slept, softly snoring; arms and legs spread akimbo, and crutches tangled up on the floor. An uncapped and half-empty bottle of scotch lay wedged between John's hip and the armrest. It rested at a roughly forty-five degree angle, and as far as Lestrade could tell, John had been drinking straight from the bottle. His cheeks were flushed pink, and the air puffing from between his red chapped lips reeked of alcohol.
“John,” he sighed happily and almost cupped John’s face in both hands before he remembered that one of them was covered in ejaculate and John probably wouldn’t like having it all over his face. Praising his foresight, he reached for the box of tissues on the bedside table and wiped his hand.
“Comfort’s not really the point,” he says. “The point is, you won’t hurt me.” He lets his voice drop back down to a sultry register as his hands roam over Sherlock’s chest, slipping under his shirt. “The point is I like being stretched and filled and I’m open and ready for you, if you want me.”
“I’m fine. It was lovely,” Sherlock tells him honestly and leans in for a deep, lingering kiss, enjoying the scratch-tickle-burn of Robert’s beard. He feels good, in a quiet, understated sort of way, and very ready for his post-coital cuddle, but not yet. “What can I do for you?”
It’s late when they return to Baker Street. Rosie is with Mrs Hudson, and Sherlock had suggested John should just sleep in his old room rather than going all the way to back the suburbs. They get off the cab and Sherlock unlocks the door and it feels so much like
John toes off his shoes and pulls his jumper over his head. Sherlock’s heart is beating so hard he thinks John must hear it. He reaches for one of the condoms he’d laid out on the bedside table, and when John takes off his trousers and sits on the edge of the bed, he presses it into John’s hand.
It all makes so much more sense now. John was attracted to him. In love with him, Irene said, and maybe she was right. There was clearly intense emotional attachment and physical attraction – if John wasn’t in love, then he wasn’t very far from it. And all the violence he’s ever inflicted on Sherlock was a reaction to that, to his inability to cope with what he felt.
This time, John has agreed to come over to help Sherlock go through some cold case files, looking for a possible link to a new string of stolen paintings. He continues playing even as John enters the flat, letting the piece reach its end. It’s essentially finished now and he’s rather pleased with how it has turned out.
After that, everything happens as if in a fog. He doesn’t have to do anything, just acquiesce when Patrick and Sam ask if what they’re doing is okay, let them undress him, kiss him, touch him. It’s the most passive he’s ever been in a sexual encounter. He’s often let his partner (or partners) take charge, certainly, but never like this, never feeling like his only job is to let himself be
“That’s nice of you to say,” Florian smiles. “I spent six years in Los Angeles, but then I had to come back here.”
“Aw, I’m sorry, man. That sucks. But yeah, I guess it helps a bit. At least I’m less likely to do something stupid just because I’m sexually frustrated, like,
Sherlock nods, too nervous now in the last few seconds to speak. He reaches for Robert’s shoulders as he braces himself above Sherlock, and holds on.
“Want to fuck you so bad,” John murmurs, and one of his fingers slides down between Sherlock’s buttocks, circling his hole. Sherlock moans, his knees almost buckling at the jolt of sensation. “I bet this lovely arse will feel just as unbelievable as your mouth.
“We’ll have to talk about it at some point, though,” Sherlock points out. “Having sex has been… important for me in the last few months. Therapeutic, even.”
“Nothing.” Sherlock’s tongue felt thick and heavy in his mouth, barely able to move. “I – overreacted. Please go on.”
Sherlock only realises that he’s still expecting searing pain when it doesn’t come. It hurts, but so much less than what he’s been bracing himself against, more pressure and stretch and discomfort than full-on pain. He’s been prepared so carefully and there’s plenty of lube and Robert moves at a glacial pace, waiting for Sherlock’ body to yield to him rather than forcing his way in – it’s honestly almost underwhelming in how
Right. Mrs Hudson has a travel cot in her flat, and she won’t mind having Rosie there overnight, if necessary. And if she’s out or can’t do it for some reason, John will just have to figure something out.
“What we’re already doing, but more. Continuing with therapy. Addressing what we feel instead of burying it down. Talking to each other, and I mean really talking, about what matters. Maybe – maybe seeing a therapist together to help us do that. Taking things slowly.” It doesn’t sound like  much, when he says it out loud, but he’s certain it would help. They just need to commit to it.
“Good.” John pressed a brief kiss to his lips and tugged at Sherlock’ elbows. “Come on, let’s get you up. The floor’s cold.”
“Could you do that?” John whispered to his ear. “Rub yourself against me, make yourself feel good?” Sherlock felt himself blush at John’s words, but he was too desperate for release to care. Hesitantly, he lowered his hips again, letting his leaking cock smear pre-ejaculate on John’s thigh.
“John,” he says softly, his voice slightly raspy. “Will you move in? Rosie can have your old room and I promise I’ll do anything to make you both comfortable, I can—”
The flight uneventful but uncomfortable (not even business class seats are cushiony enough to make sitting comfortable) and he prefers to spend the majority of the subsequent train ride standing. At the train station in the small town of Meiringen he is met by a courteous Haus Talblick employee who drives him to the resort in a car luxurious enough for Mycroft. It’s in the car, as he looks at the snowy peaks of the Bernese Alps rising from the valley of the Aare river that he begins to think he may have overreacted. His craving has abated considerably compared to how he felt when he woke up, there’s no reason why he couldn’t manage it at home and certainly no need to talk to a
he confronts John about this, because he’s going to, he’s entitled to the truth – what does he want John’s reaction to be?
,” Sherlock nearly sobs, and his arms come up around John’s neck. He slows his movements again, and they rock together for a while, Sherlock’s shoulders hunched as he bows his head down to John’s, breathing hotly on John’s ear. When John thinks he can’t possibly take it any longer, Sherlock begins moving in earnest, lifting himself up and then grinding down. His moans have a desperate quality to them now, and his body trembles in John’s arms.
. He’s been here, all this time, lapping up Robert’s kindness and generosity, and he’s apparently repaid him by moaning another man’s name in the throes of passion. Repeatedly.
“No,” he says as if it shocks him a little. “I wouldn’t, I couldn’t. Not ever again. I – want to make love to you any way you want me to. I want to make you feel good. That’s all there is.”
Terry’s obviously very sure about what he likes and what he wants from Sherlock, but he still takes care to make sure Sherlock’s comfortable. He complies when Sherlock asks to keep the room as dark as possible, only switching on the lamp on his desk without asking why, and he visibly restrains himself from going too fast, giving Sherlock time to relax. Sherlock watches in fascination as Terry pulls the thick, hot pink plug out of his body, watches him coat two fingers with lube and push them inside his obscenely stretched hole that swallows them greedily, and his heart beats so loud he’s sure Terry must be able to hear it.
Afterwards they lie in bed, Sherlock sandwiched between the other two, feeling warm and comfortable and greatful. He’s really been very lucky in his choice of partners so far. And maybe this luck will hold. Maybe he can find a stable partner after all. Maybe it won’t matter if they’re not in love with each other as long as they’re willing to take care of each other. Patrick and Sam have just shown him that it’s possible to make someone feel cared for and wanted without being in love with them. Maybe there’s no reason not to be hopeful that he could find a deep, meaningful relationship despite what he still feels for John.
(Kissing someone with a beard turned out to be about as scratchy as he’d expected, but he liked it more than he’d thought he would.)
John leans in and presses his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, his tear-stained cheeks, his eyelids, and Sherlock’s heart beat picks up in anticipation before finally, finally, John’s lips find his.
“Two reasons,” he says, and his voice carries a hint of the tone he uses when explaining a deduction, but only a hint. Mostly he sounds like he’s reading a phone book. “First, I thought there was a chance that you were right, and I would… benefit from a romantic entanglement. I thought I could give it a try, but I didn’t feel confident to… initiate anything with no practical experience whatsoever. I don’t suppose many people are keen on thirty-eight-year-old virgins. I figured it’d be good to gather some data first, to learn the basics in a low-stakes context. No need to impress, no risk of disappointing anyone.”
“Because I… because I was a closeted homophobic arsehole,” John says, and it’s so far out of the realm of things Sherlock could have expected him to say that he actually lifts his head to look at him. John meets his eyes briefly, a world of pain and shame swimming behind a sheen of tears, and then looks back down at the table. “I am – bisexual.” The world is clearly new and alien on his tongue, but he says it firmly. “I always knew this, but I never accepted it. Pushed it down, buried it… let it fester. I congratulated myself on being supportive of my lesbian sister, but anytime there was a man I was attracted to I found a way to punish him for it. And when you… when you said that you… loved me,” he says the words low and quick, like something that could explode if given too much room to exist, “it was like you were forcing me to look at a part of myself I spent most of my life pretending didn’t exist. Something just… snapped in me.”
being happy again. But Dr Schneider tells him happiness doesn’t have to be a grand thing or a permanent state of being and encourages him to look for small things that bring him joy, however fleeting, and then to try incorporating them into his life as much as possible. It sounds a bit trite, but Sherlock is, frankly, tired of being miserable, and so he tries. After his therapy sessions, between yoga classes and aromatherapy and massages and art therapy and horse riding and country walks and boxing in the underground gym, he looks for little things that make him happy.
“Oh, um. Thanks,” John says, and he’s not exactly good at articulation either. He takes two pills and drains the glass.
Sherlock smirked, “Yes, John did explain to me your desires when you and I were sparing wittily. As I’m sure you surmise, your banter went beyond me when we first met.”
When John’s mobile began to vibrate in his pocket, he wondered at first who would be texting him? Glancing at the display, he saw that it was Sherlock and opened it.
“Mind telling me what that was all about?” John asked. Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but was caught off track by a bulky man in a g-string and a robe harness talking up a Domme across the room. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he calculated for a moment.
It was quaintly called “Cuffs”. And it was on Dover street, behind and under the Mayfair club. It was off the books owned by the same people who owned the upper club. But that was not common knowledge. All the electricity, the water, the internet, all of that was run from the club above without anyone knowing. There were a lot of things that went on there that normal people didn’t know about.
happy, but the shock of it is too much. Years of longing and heartbreak and loneliness and now suddenly this,
“No!” Sherlock yelps, twisting himself out of John’s arms. It’s the worst outcome there could have been: John, prone to gentlemanly tendencies as always, now clearly feels the need to fight against his natural feelings – Sherlock has evidently managed to make John feel selfish for not reciprocating, enough to make him think he needs to make up for it. “You don’t have to do that!”
“You really don’t leave anything to chance, do you?” he chuckled and reached for one of the tubes. Now that Sherlock thought about it, it had probably been stupid of him to get so many kinds, but the reviews online had been inconclusive and he wasn’t sure what John preferred…
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says after a moment, his voice small but remarkably steady, given the circumstances. “If you hadn’t come here today I’d never have told you. I’m sorry. If you – if you still want to be friends after this, I promise you’ll never hear another word on this from me ever again.”
Sherlock didn’t notice that the door had opened and John had come in until he felt John’s hands on his shoulders, draping his dressing gown over his trembling form. Sherlock glanced at him through tear-wet eyelashes, but couldn’t bear to really look at his face, afraid what he’d see there.
“Not—not enough,” Sherlock gasps, moving his fingers inside himself, trying to find that perfect spot.
to notice. That night in Battersea, I had no doubt about it. I thought he understood it then, but clearly I overestimated him.”
John stands up again, throwing a pillow on the floor by his feet. Sherlock is down and kneeling on it before he knows it.
“John,” he moans helplessly, his body torn between the impulse to push against his fingers and find more of the sweet, sweet pleasure, and the need to
“Touch yourself,” he tells Sherlock as he begins to thrust faster, unable to pace himself any longer
“I’m sorry, Sherlock,” Irene says once the waiter has deposited her smashed avocado in front of her and left.  “I really thought Dr Watson would get over himself eventually.”
In two quick strides he reaches his chair and sits down, letting Jack jump to his lap. It’s not the same at all, but it’s nevertheless a warm, living creature willing to provide Sherlock with its comforting presence, and Sherlock takes what he can get.
“Yeah,” he says, and at least has the decency to go faintly pink. “I’m sorry, but that was way too hot.”
There’s sadness in John’s eyes, but also hope and determination and something else that Sherlock can’t quite name
you were nervous and I still decided that the best thing to do with a nervous virgin was to shove my dick up his arse, no questions asked! Who the fuck does that? And – oh my god, I can’t believe this! Even after you
touching himself, without consciously deciding to do it. As if on purpose, at that exact moment John starts thrusting harder, and Sherlock’s lost. He hopes briefly that John may be too distracted by his own pleasure to notice what Sherlock is doing, but after that the only thing he can do is push mindlessly into his own fist and then back against John, torn between which sensation he wants more. John’s driving into him hard, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, and Sherlock tugs at his cock helplessly, wanting,
“Yes, like that,” John encourages him, almost devouring him with his hungry eyes. “Do it the way you like it. Push one finger in when you’re ready.” Sherlock does so immediately, slowly slipping his index finger inside. The stretch feels like too much and not enough at the same time. The pressure makes Sherlock moan, and at that John moves his hand to palm himself through his trousers. Sherlock thinks of John’s cock, hard underneath John’s hand, and he wants to touch it so badly, wants it inside him, wants
It’s only after he’s sent the text that he realises he’s effectively asked for John’s help with a case. It seems like years since the last time he did that, but it doesn’t feel as unnatural as he would have thought. John offers some valuable insight and Sherlock ends up updating him on the progress of the case via text. When he gets back home to Jack, Sherlock finds himself smiling and feeling truly hopeful for the first time in weeks.
“Let me tell you what I think,” Sam says slowly, turning back from Patrick to Sherlock. “I think that something happened that upset you – I don’t know what, you can tell us if you want, or not, that’s up to you – and you were feeling… lonely, and you came here because you wanted something from us, but you didn’t think we would want to give it, and that’s why you didn’t text, or ring the bell.”
to, if he relapses again it will be the last time because won’t be able to get out of it anymore, he knows that and he can’t let it happen, he can’t let
John pulls the covers over them – they’re disgustingly filthy at this point, but it doesn’t matter. Gradually, Sherlock’s shivers subside and his breathing evens out. John wipes his tears away with his thumb, and Sherlock opens his eyes slowly, heavy-lidded and unfocused.
When Sherlock first moved to his quaint little rented cottage, the first thing he noticed was that there were beehives in his closest neighbour’s garden. He was immediately and vividly reminded of childhood summers spent in the Sussex Downs with his beekeeper grandfather, and how he imagined that when he was old, he would do exactly the same – live a little cottage and keep bees. He’d set off for the Cotswolds with the intention pursue things he already knew gave him pleasure, but to also look for new ones, and beekeeping seemed like something that was sure to fit the bill. And so once he had settled in, he asked his neighbour to introduce him to the art of beekeeping.
Sherlock’s heart is cracking down the middle. This is all so much worse, so much more painful and complicated than he expected. He never suspected John having any sort of attraction for men, but now that John had said it it seems so obvious. A part of him aches for John living in self-hatred and self-denial, but another part is angry at him for turning that hate outwards on innocent people… on Sherlock.
“Sherlock.” John took Sherlock’s head in his hands, looking him in the eye. “I’m finally able to be with the love of my life, I swear I’d be satisfied if all we ever did was kiss. If you feel comfortable with anything more I’ll be ecstatic because I’m obviously incredibly attracted to you, but I want you to know that it’s
John actually went slightly pink at that, which Sherlock found fascinating, because surely he must have been aware he was above average. It was bound to have been a source of pride and admiration from his past lovers.
“I want to apologise,” he says, looking Sherlock in the eye even though it clearly costs him a lot of effort. “And… explain some things, if you’ll let me. Not to try to justify what I… there’s no justifying that,” he adds hastily, “but you said… yesterday it sounded like you were willing to give me another chance, but you can only do that if you know the whole truth.”
Sherlock was quiet for a moment. He listened to the beat of John’s heart and tried to think about it. What he wanted the most was to give John what he needed, to be good for him, to know that he was enough. There wasn’t anything more erotic to him than the idea of being able to meet John’s sexual needs, but he knew John wasn’t asking about that. It was hard to think past it, to disregard John and think about himself, but he tried because John had asked him to.
“Sometimes, yeah. But this is where I grew up, and it’s beautiful here. Have you had chance to see any of our famous sights? The Aare Gorge, the Reichenbach Falls?”
“No,” Sherlock says immediately, and perhaps with a bit too much firmness. One thing he’s certain about is that he doesn’t want to have his back to Robert. His scars are not much of a turn on, for one. Robert has seen them, of course, Sherlock could hardly have kept them hidden for so long, but that doesn’t mean he particularly likes him looking at them. And aside from that… having his partner behind him would probably be a bit too much for the first time.
“Your hair is absolutely lovely,” Florian effuses as he shampoos Sherlock’s hair. “It’s such a treat to meet a man who takes good care of his hair.”
By the time Sherlock takes him in his mouth John is breathing rapidly and digging his fingers into the mattress, moans escaping his lips without even a hint of restraint. Sherlock takes him as deep as he can and John groans loudly, back arching, though his hips stay still – sober John is clearly a more considerate lover than drunk John. (Sherlock wishes he was a little less considerate and put his hand in Sherlock’s hair again.) He makes good use of everything he learned that first night, lavishing attention on John’s most sensitive spots, sucking gently but vigorously.
"What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree." - Sigmund Freud
Greg listened. He didn't ask any questions, but rather let Sherlock take him own time when he paused. There were a lot of pauses in Sherlock's narrative, whereby he stopped to gather his thoughts. His story was a long one, and he'd only shared it with two other people in the world. One of those people had been flesh and blood...his brother Mycroft. The other person, obviously, was with his lover; the incredible, and fundamentally inestimable Dr. (Captain) John Watson. Gregory Lestrade was a good man, a good friend. It was time that Sherlock acknowledged it, in fact, long overdue.
flagrant bodily efflux, unless the body in question was dead. "Uh...pardon?" John squeaked. He tried not to chew on his pillow.
Greg sighed, turning back to Sherlock. "This won't be easy for you, mate," he gestured wanly, "and in light of your,
Am on the mend after a hellish three weeks of tooth abscess/sinus infection. Hopefully, the speed of these posts will go up now that I don't feel like I am dying of a brain tumor.
Sherlock took a moment to tighten the sash on his dressing gown before flashing Greg a spine-chilling grin. "Having breakfast, of course. I would have expected you to deduce this, seeing as you
to do anything! And I - hey! Lestrade! I'm not finished with you yet. Get back in this crappy excuse of a police vehicle this instant.
On, and on, and on. In light of Lestrade's long-winded diatribe, Sherlock deemed it prudent to seek the Mind Palace. If provoked beyond his waning restraint, he might do (would do) something later judged a bit not good. Mind over matter, as it were.
Now, Sherlock managed a fierce "No!" before John covered the detective's mouth with his palm. The tall man loomed, glaring at the ex-soldier with a muffled, "Mmmph!" It was ludicrous for John to doubt his own strength. That was ridiculous, that was...
If he gave the commercial-grade fish slice* a go ("It's for an experiment, John!"), a tool ordinarily wielded to scrape egg off the burners...he just might manage to snag it. John ordered a full company retreat. Pulling his hand out of his pants, he adjusted his poor penis and sighed. Back to business.
Giggling, Sherlock patted John's arse. "It's obvious, John. You're my muse!" He dramatically cleared his throat, for absolute peak bloody voice gorgeousness. "And of course, you will bathe with my gracious assistance, you most precious, delectable man."
"Sherlock. Hey." John reached up to brush away sweaty strands of hair plastered to the taller man's forehead. "Come on, you. I want that cuddle we just talked about. Skin-to-skin, yeah?" The doctor demonstrated his nakedness with a flourish of wiggling hips. A deep line creased the bridge of Sherlock's nose.
"Charming. I'd rather not, thanks. Back to the analogy. So. We've been infiltrated by the influenza virus - any particular strain?"
"Listen," Sherlock dithered, sensing disbelief, "I experienced no pain or discomfort in the rectal region, including both anal sphincters." The genius tightened his quads to force John back into his body. "My insides feel marvelous, John, and my testicles have nicely recovered." For emphasis, he yanked John down for a glorious snog.
A ruined lunar landscape had been gouged into Sherlock's pale, pristine, perfect body. Both shoulders and the length of his back were peppered by gnarled, looping tendrils of collagen and small craters. Long, wire-thin bands of raised flesh ringed his ribs like a belt. A constellation of healed cigarette (and other) burns crossed Sherlock's flanks. Tract marks blanketed his forearms. There wasn't one swath of skin left unmolested. He was afraid to find out how much damage had been perpetrated by Sherlock's own hand, and wasn't quite sure which was worse.
"You see, John, this is why you are my blogger. You lay it all out on the line." Sherlock smiled, so profoundly in love with this man. Slowly, ever so slowly, the detective eased his lips down and brushed against John's temple. The little man shivered, pursuing the butterfly touch.
"In human beings pure masculinity or femininity is not to be found either in a psychological or biological sense."
"John," the detective choked out. He surreptitiously slid the whisky out of John's reach; but John wasn't so far gone as all that. "I have something to say."
Just to be on the up and up, things get really Bipolar later on. From experience, I know that when strong emotions are repressed and then expressed, nine shades of holy hell break loose. Thing do smooth out and then more sex happens (yay).
for the first time by somebody other than Mycroft.  John had seen Sherlock for the man he really was, past the narcissistic posing and sniping. John had seen, and accepted.
. Yet. The speed of which Sherlock had lost it. The reason for which he had done so. Granted, Sherlock was unpredictable, but it was the first time the wanker had punched him. Come to think of it, this might be the first time that Sherlock had initiated physical contact. Sherlock only ever touched John that he'd noticed, other than the inestimable, squeezable Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock made a moue. "Fine. It's true, I am brilliant." His brows lifted and rolled, left to right. "But, you are my beacon of light. I wouldn't have made it if you hadn't forgiven me and let me back into your life."
Sherlock's face fell. He turned about like a man in great pain, and reached down to pick up his chair. The detective stiffly sat down and wrung his huge hands. "Oh, John. What have I done?"
"Sherlock," Greg spoke gently, "Can we sit down, please, and work this out?" Their eyes stuck together as if magnetized. They'd managed to work past a myriad of issues, but nothing held a candle to
The detective's irises had always reminded John of glass marbles, the type that he delighted in as a lad. An ancient, yellowed leather pouch of marbles had been given to him by his father, before alcohol had poisoned his heart.
The case itself Sherlock rated as a pedestrian lower-level Three, another mind-numbing domestic gone wrong. Nevertheless, the wife's innovative method of slaughtering of her spouse was galvanizing enough to spur the detective interest. Besides, Sherlock's endless claustrophobic whingeing raised John's hackles, which triggered Sherlock's permanently ingrained paranoia. He'd quickly deduced that Lestrade might be facing a second domestic murder if Sherlock kept up mothering his lover.
"You don't know, do you?" John smiled, or scowled, or grimaced - Sherlock couldn't quite discern in the low kitchen light. "How I worry. How my fucking shorts legs with be the death of you one day."
"Yes," Sherlock agreed, "It most definitely was that, and then some. How are you, John? Did our rather -
Eventually, in an unspoken agreement, the men drew apart. Sherlock briefly nuzzled into John's neck before wordlessly moving off to complete his tasks. Pain pills, water, and a soggy bag of frozen peas were handed to John in short order, much to the doctor's relief. John drained the glass in four huge swallows and passed it back to Sherlock's waiting hand.
John complied, alternating quick licks to the glans with soft sucks. He could tell Sherlock was close by the tightness of his balls. He had to make a decision. Swallow or not? John wasn't sure he could do it. Yes, he'd sampled his own semen sharing kisses with women, but...this was different. He didn't know.
However, any choice John had in the matter was abruptly removed. Sherlock exploded, hips jerking madly. John swallowed. It was either that, choke, or suffer a sperm facial. He swallowed. It wasn't bad, really. Slightly bitter, mostly salt. Like taking a drink from the ocean. Besides...the expression of wonder on Sherlock's face - surely that was worthy on it's own? The doctor finished up by licking Sherlock's prick squeaky clean.
John was obviously gutted. Sherlock was long past emotionally wrecked. He should have known better, broached the subject of John's "troubles" some other day...preferably some time next year. After Christmas.  Pursuing the point at this juncture felt like opening Pandora's Box.
to do with you. John," he lamented, mouth suddenly snapping shut and locked tight. If possible, Sherlock's face reflected even more misery. He let fly with a loud, gusty sigh.
Even in the best of circumstances, he had to act as a rogue; dead men simply don't phone the police. In "The Empty Hearse", Sherlock is seen as unkempt and desperate, a man who's literally running for his life. This is the only information we're given (a fact that has launched a thousand prompts). Excepting for a few minutes' conversation with Mycroft, this three-year ordeal is never touched on again. By anyone.
The detective snorted, sucking in a breathful of air. He found himself too rattled to form a coherent sentence. "Shit! John...just fucking shit!" He stepped back and tore the clothing off his back. Ruined flesh reflected the light from the windows. "This, John.
He was the epitome of every love-struck arse on the planet. He, sacrificing everything for love. And yet,
John would have snorted if he wasn't so lust-filled. "Okay, so, I'll talk us through it, so you know what's coming next."
John's mouth tilted up. "Spooning, Sherlock. It's called spooning. Besides, I have my own pressing needs to attend to. As it turns out, right now I need the loo. And for pity's sake Sherlock, what the bloody hell is 'taction'?" Grunting, he added, "And stop giving me that look, yeah? It gets really old after a while."
"Oi," Greg groaned, "there's the rub." As if to demonstrate, he rubbed at the back of his neck. A loud thump resonated from the hallway, disrupting his reverie. The DI stood up tall and poised for action, thumbing over the release of his gun holster. True, he was in the relative safety of a second-storey flat - but, this was the
The room fell silent, the darkness oppressive. John forced down a strong  impulse to bolt. Sherlock sighed in deep resignation. "Oh, John. My lovely John. And I still want, and I know it's unfair. I can't ask or expect this of you considering - just considering."
Tender loving care, and then sexy times. Not very explicit in this chapter, just some arse-groping and kisses. The next chapter, though...
A pleased smile spread across the little man's face. "Excellent! You've been neglecting your body for years," he chided, more tender than not. "Might my influence also make a dent in your flagrant abuse of nicotine patches?"
Just to be on the up and up, I'm supplying the sources for dear Mr. Freud's words of wisdom (ummm). Anyway, I was too lazy to mark down the specific text from where each quote is cited. I blame it all on my id. ;p
“Hmm, yeah,” Terry hums. “Feels so good.” Good isn’t exactly the word Sherlock would use, it’s so vague and bland compared to the intensity of the experience, but he can’t come up with anything more specific, or any words at all, for that matter. He breathes, trying to get himself under control as Terry stays still for a few moments, presumably to get used to the stretch, but perhaps only to give Sherlock time to adjust.
“Of course I care, but what use is it? I can’t bring her back and I can’t turn into her and I never expected to be an adequate replacement in any long-term fashion. I don’t know what more there is to—“ he cuts himself off, because John’s expression has turned absolutely horrified.
. She’s John’s friend, too. Maybe she has a right to know. And maybe… Sherlock has a right not to have to do this alone.
Sherlock grunted, not able to form words or even just nod. John’s arms tightened around him and Sherlock sighed. He felt utterly sated and content, and not just because of his exceptional orgasm, but because he’d given John one too. They had made love, and Sherlock had
John nods, looking everywhere but at Sherlock. “Good… that’s good,” he says but he looks vaguely nauseated, and that makes Sherlock bristle unexpectedly. Is this still John’s latent homophobia? The only man he’s ever had sex  with (for a given definition of sex) continues having and actively enjoying sex with men. He’s gay, gay, gay. Does that still disgust John on some level? Or is it more specific, more personal – does John disapprove of the way Sherlock has chosen to cope with what happened? Does he think it would be more
There’s silence between them, interrupted only by the ambient sound of the restaurant. Irene’s beautiful eyes seem deeply sad.
“No, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is we’re both doing our best to get better, and I think we can help each other. Don’t you? Don’t you think that after
John looked at him with hungry eyes and Sherlock moved to the bed quickly, trying to escape the heat of his gaze.
“So how did you use to get yourself off?” he whispers in Sherlock’s ear as he runs his hands all over Sherlock’s chest before licking at his earlobe and then taking it between his teeth, not biting, just letting him feel a slight pressure.
Robert looks at him for a long moment, then he seems to make up his mind. He removes his hand from Sherlock’s hair and says, “Who’s John?”
He doesn’t sleep with Robert anymore. It’s just impossible, after having talked so openly – how could he sleep with someone who
“So… are you very busy with cases?” John asks. He’s still hesitant, careful, but some weight seems to have lifted off his shoulders.
He sees Molly’s hand twitch and still, then twitch again – obviously wanting to reach out to him, touch his hand perhaps, as a gesture of comfort, but not daring. Sherlock’s heart squeezes painfully, and he realises that he
, but he’s had a lovely, intimate experience with someone who’s only been gentle and kind with him even though there’s nothing but superficial physical attraction between them. But
John is next to him on the bed in a flash, kissing Sherlock’s face, and the vaguely nauseous feeling in Sherlock’s stomach is gone, replaced by pure desire.
Sherlock never reaches orgasm during their encounters. He doesn’t want to. It’s bad enough that male arousal insists on making itself so blatantly obvious, Sherlock has enough trouble being discreet about that. Most of the time, his control over his body is sufficient – he focuses on John’s closeness rather than his own bodily sensations, so that his arousal only reaches a low intensity and when John leaves, he’s able to just let it ebb away on its own. Other times, his body gets the upper hand, filling his veins with liquid desire, he struggles to keep himself in check while John’s fucking him, and the moment John’s gone he’ll get himself off within minutes, trying not to think of John but failing.
“Hello, darling. I see there’s food on your forehead, so it must be good,” John says with a smile and bends down to kiss the top of her head. As he does so he looks at Sherlock, and giggles.
“What I mean to say is...Nothing like that will ever happen again. You deserve so much better, and I… I promise to do all I can to be a better friend to you from now on.”
He doesn’t know how he manages not to embarrass himself terribly, but by the end of his appointment, his hair is cut, he has Florian’s phone number scribbled on a piece of paper in his pocket, and they have a date tomorrow.
When he came back to the bedroom John had decided that in fact he needed the bathroom too, so Sherlock was left sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting, so, naturally, he had plenty of time for his nerves to come back. It was different this time, of course, because now he knew he wouldn’t have to go out of his comfort zone to please John, but that didn’t mean he’d be any good.
“It’s—all of it, really,” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes and focused on John’s warm, solid body against his, rather than on what he was saying, letting it pour out. “There’s so many sensations and – and I have to think about everything and it all becomes too much.”
John lets out a moan as Sherlock’s fingers encircle him, and Sherlock can’t help glancing up at him: John’s head is thrown back, mouth hanging open, eyes screwed shut. (He isn’t looking. Of course he isn’t.)
“Oh, I’m sure it will come in handy,” Sherlock smirks, although he’s not thinking of John. Given their agreement, he knows he’s looking at weeks if not months of celibacy, and in that time he definitely intends to explore the world of sex toys a bit more. This will be a good start, and given Patrick and Sam’s words, he can’t wait to try it.
White noise filled his ears and he could barely interpret John’s concerned questions. He’d done it. Ruined everything. He’d got as far as being on all fours with the tip of John’s cock inside him and hadn’t managed to go through with it and now John would leave.
, it can’t be. It’s just one more thing that would eventually take all his hard-won shreds of happiness and stamp all over them.
“But I promise you’ll be the first person I’ll call if I ever run out of honey.” The boot of his rented car is full of jars of various sizes, some for himself, some intended as presents.
of me?” he asks, stifling down the painful feelings Irene’s assumption has awakened. This is, after all, why he wanted to see her in the first place. She’s the only one who could possibly give him an indication of which parts of his sexuality are
John gives a full-body jerk, as if someone had just jumped at him from behind a corner and scared him half to death.
“What?!” Sherlock can’t imagine anything that would shock him more. “His sister? But they don’t get along.”
“Yes.” The single word sends a powerful stab of arousal through John’s entire body, and he knows immediately what he wants to do.
But he doesn’t tell the driver to turn around. He lets himself be driven to the expansive mansion and checks in. Maybe he’s weak and a coward, but he has no strength left to try to do anything about it.
I'm sorry this chapter took so long! I can't promise the next one will be much better, but I hope to be able to finish it before Christmas. It will be the last chapter of this story, but if you're worried that Sherlock and John can't possibly reach their happily ever after so soon, do not fear because I'm planning a sequel!
just not entirely ideal. It didn’t matter to him whether he enjoyed it as long as John did: that would be reward enough for him.
“No,” John says quietly. “That part of my life is over, I think.” Sherlock wants to point out that that part of John’s life hasn’t even properly begun, but John continues. “I really don’t think I can be… intimate... with
“It’s only natural that you’d assume the role you’re used to,” Sherlock pointed out. “I don’t mind.”
he was when fully erect. Before, thinking about John’s above-average endowment had been mouth-wateringly arousing. Now, when it was no longer just a fantasy, it was… still arousing, but also just plain terrifying at the same time. Sherlock couldn’t imagine how something that big could possibly fit inside him… and that was most certainly what was going to happen.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock waves his hand. He doesn’t mind, really, he’s just shocked. “I wanted to tell you after a while, but it never seemed like a good time.”
“Sit down; you’re shaking.” It was true, Sherlock noticed as John said it: his body was wracked with tremors.
It’s late in the evening and Sherlock has just finished playing the violin for John, who’s sipping his tea quietly, somewhat tense. Sherlock estimates it’s time for him to go and get ready. He puts his violin away, feeling John’s eyes on him, and makes his way to the bathroom. He’s halfway there, his back to John, when John speaks.
He had no reason to be, he knew that. Firstly, sex was a basic form of human behaviour, almost everyone engaged in it and there was absolutely nothing difficult about it, and secondly, he was about to do it with
He went to the living room and sat on the sofa, hugging his knees to his chest. John had said they’d figure it out – he had to trust John.
“It looks small, but don’t let that fool you, the vibrations pack a punch,” Patrick says. “It’s a gem.”
As much as Sherlock enjoys spending time with John and Rosie, it always makes him a little nervous when it’s in public, because people sometimes tend to assume that he’s Rosie’s other parent. John no longer jumps in immediately to insist that he’s not gay and usually doesn’t correct people unless not correcting them would lead to further misunderstandings and awkwardness (clearly out of consideration for Sherlock, to avoid drawing more attention that necessary to the fact that they’re not a couple), but it obviously makes him uncomfortable.
“I don’t know. He disappeared a few days after y-- Not disappeared! Sorry, bad word choice,” Molly corrects herself hastily when Sherlock’s expression turns alarmed. “He just – cut off contact with everyone and moved in with his sister, apparently.”
Robert startled and blushed and looked at the floor. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable,” he said, clearly misunderstanding Sherlock’s – admittedly idiotic – remark.
Terry makes a questioning noise as if he has no idea what Sherlock means, but on reflection, Sherlock decides it would probably kill the mood if he said that he could well be a serial killer for all Terry knows, and Sherlock would hate to do that because Terry’s mouth on his pulse point right now feels rather amazing. He grabs two handfuls of Terry’s arse and pulls their hips together gasping at the contact. God, this feels good. Why didn’t he start having sex sooner? He’s wasted years.
“Why would someone gorgeous and brilliant like you be wasting his time here in the middle of nowhere with a fat old beekeeper, unless you were trying to get over someone who broke your heart?”
His face does look a bit greenish, and Sherlock’s anger deflates. It’s odd to think that the same event that kick-started Sherlock’s sex life ended John’s. It seems to have pushed the two of them to the opposite ends of the sexuality spectrum; Sherlock’s libido speaks loud and clear to him now, demanding to be fed at regular intervals, while John “Three Continents” Watson seems to have become more sex-repulsed than Sherlock had ever been. Sherlock isn’t sure how he feels about that. Before, he would have been pleased if John decided not to pursue any more relationships, but now it makes him feel uncomfortable – one more indication of how wrong things have become.
“It isn’t seri—well, it might be. I don’t know. It’s just that I noticed you seem rather reluctant to… have sex with me.”
He doesn’t know how long he stands there in a sort of trance, but eventually he shakes himself out of it.
His heart thumps hard, and it’s not that difficult to realise what he wants after all: he wants John to tell him he loves him. Take Sherlock in his arms and hold him close and never let go.
Sherlock can do nothing but watch as John strips quickly, revealing his perfect, compact body. As soon as John is naked he’s kissing Sherlock again, finally skin on skin, guiding them to the bed.
“I won’t,” John promises, tightening his arms around him. “Go to sleep, love, hmm? I’ll be right here and never let you go.”
The morning after they wrapped the case up, Sherlock woke up feeling warm and comfortable with John spooned up behind him, his breath ghosting over his neck. Sherlock shuffled closer to him, enjoying the way John’s arm automatically tightened around his waist possessively. It felt lovely, to slowly drift awake into the feeling of being loved and wanted.
Sherlock’s thrusts get impossibly harder as he chases his release, his rhythm erratic now, and then he stills for one long second and John can feel his cock throb and pulse deep inside him. Sherlock groans loudly as he comes and fucks into John roughly two more times before finally relaxing.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed. Just the thought of John’s hand on his penis was overpowering – John had never actually done that before, not skin on skin, and Sherlock felt himself go a little faint in anticipation as his heartrate increased further and his breathing went shallower – he could barely move as he struggled out of his pyjama bottoms.
Out if the blue, John's distress morphed into madness and his spine snapped up straight as an arrow. "Sherlock Holmes, I can't
John's eyes flew wide and he jerked forward. An instant later his hand shot up to shield him from the bright glare of the bare-bulb desk lamp. "
After his ablutions, the little man gave himself an unforgiving inspection, casting a critical eye at the haggard face in the mirror. Self-doubt welled up; the question as to why him, why John Watson, echoed silently in the confines of his brain.
"Christ, that sounds ominous," John grinned. "Alright, I'm all ears. It's not like I'll be going anywhere soon."
beautiful, John. So serendipitous it is, having you here by my side. Lost I would be, without you." He punctuated this confession with a series of soft, sucking kisses.
John screamed. He pushed away from the detective, sweeping the duvet aside. Most of it landed on the floor, along with two of the pillows. "Fuck. Fuck. Jesus
The doctor batted at the roll of loo paper, and rubbed the entire roll across his face. Saline and snot simply smeared. John gave it up as a loss, and threw the paper as hard as he could toward the closed bathroom door.
Lestrade goggled at his consultant, gobsmacked. "Jesus Christ, Sherlock. It's not half eight in the morning! Get up on the wrong side of the bed, did we?"
Sorry for the "blithering idiot" comment. I blame Moffat and Gatiss for this. Also, if any of the information regarding anal sphincters is incorrect, I blame Wikipedia.
"Yeah, love. Not a problem. What do you need? Can I help?" the little man burbled hopefully. Really, though, what salvation could he offer? The devastating fallout of torture fell beyond this doctor's ability to heal.
He lets his forehead fall on John’s shoulder and lets himself collapse into John, because John is there to catch him. John wraps his arms around him and Sherlock lets the tears fall, lets the years’ worth of heartache flow away.
“Oh,” John says, and for some reason the anger seems to go out of him, and he looks down. “So I suppose you really just don’t care.”
Sherlock snaps his hips forward, groaning. He makes very different noises when he tops than at any other time, more animalistic, and John loves it. With John’s encouragement, Sherlock’s thrusts turn progressively more powerful, pounding into John like his life depends on it.
He turns carefully to face John, examining his sleeping form. His hair is tousled, his face relaxed and worry-free in his sleep, a drop of saliva drying in the left corner of his mouth – he is the most beautiful thing Sherlock has ever seen. He can’t resist reaching out and stroking John’s face, marvelling at the fact that he’s allowed to do that now. John sighs a little but doesn’t wake. Sherlock watches him for a moment longer and then extricates himself from the embrace, careful not to wake him.
How much could have been avoided if only they had talked? If Sherlock had told John, that night when John asked him how he felt about Irene Adler being alive, that of course he was glad she wasn’t dead but on the whole he didn’t care about her at all and what made him unsettled was the implication she’d made about John? If he had confided in John before confronting Moriarty on the rooftop? If he had actually explained himself after coming back? If they had talked during those months after Mary shot him? They’ll have to change that. If they want to save their friendship, they’ll actually have to say what they mean.
“Come here,” he whispers, and Sherlock goes willingly, lets himself be wrapped up in a hug. “Someone hurt you, didn’t they,” Florian says softly and it’s not really a question. “I’m so sorry. But it’s okay now. You’re okay.”
“Robert, oh…I’m…” he sighs helplessly when the molten heat begins to tighten around the base of his cock and the heavy weight of his balls, the jerky motions of his hand falling out of sync with Robert’s continued slow, measured rocks.
“Oh, he has,” Sherlock says dryly. Honestly, this brunch was a bad idea. “But being bisexual doesn’t magically make him interested in me.”
Would he even be able to give Sherlock the kind of gentle, affectionate care he craves? John isn’t a selfish lover, he’s always considerate of his partner’s wishes and he’s never been rough unless it was wanted of him. But he’d never beaten a friend into a pulp before either, and that didn’t stop him from doing it to Sherlock. Is there any guarantee that this…
There’s a wave of nausea-like shame rising in him, but he can’t stop himself. He goes back to the living room to check that Sherlock is still fast asleep, and then locks himself in the bathroom. He braces one hand against the sink and unzips his flies with the other. His cock is rock-hard and leaking already when he takes himself in hand, and it takes only a few rough, furious strokes and a series of pornographic snapshots of Sherlock crying out in pleasure as someone (not someone: John) fucks his brains out, hard and fast and deep, before he’s coming, grunting out his release.
They see each other four more times before it’s time for Sherlock to leave. It’s just about sex, pleasuring each other with their hands and mouths, but Florian always finds a few extra moments afterwards to give Sherlock a little cuddle, even though it’s obviously not something he usually does with his conquests, and Sherlock is inexpressibly grateful for it. Who knew that a bit of affectionate skin-on-skin contact could be so valuable to him?
“Go on,” he manages to get out, and he watches John’s eyes grow even darker, pleasure spread on his face as he pushes in deeper, deeper.
“Can be a gift for Watson, too,” Sam adds. “Let him watch you use this on yourself and he’ll go weak in the knees, trust me.”
“Everything, yes,” Sherlock said before John could finish the question. He’d made extensive preparations.
He sends the text with his heart racing, knowing that it’s not just a text – that by sending it he’s permitting John to re-establish contact between.
“John,” Sherlock tried again as John sat back down. “I want to—do that. Have your dick up my arse,” he added for clarification, and John chuckled next to him, which more than made up for how awkward Sherlock felt saying the words. “But it’s true that it feels… rather intimidating, especially given that you’re quite… well-endowed.”
“You did so well,” John whispers to him as he strokes his hair. “You were absolutely wonderful, my love. Are you feeling all right?”
. He found it arousing to think about Sherlock stroking him. The realisation felt so good Sherlock forgot to breathe for a moment.
“That was gorgeous, Sherlock,” he whispers against Sherlock’s sweat-damp curls, kissing his face gently. “I love watching you come.”
And as for the sex itself… it was very enjoyable in the end, but dampened by Sherlock’s memories of John. How much better would it have been if he hadn’t been terrified of hurting Terry? He wants to try topping again, he determines with certainty, and again and again until the only thing on his mind while he does it is the pleasure he’s feeling and giving his partner. John doesn’t get to take this away from him.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” he says weakly. He should probably go, let Terry go back to the club and find someone better equipped to meet his needs. This is exactly the kind of humiliation he wanted to avoid. What was he thinking?
“-- but I don’t really care for the rest of it. I like my peace and quiet. The bees are all the company I need.” He looks at Sherlock from the corner of his eye, as if he’s expecting a specific kind of response he’s heard many times. “This isn’t a sad story.”
They rest for almost an hour, and John is stirred from a light doze when Sherlock begins squirming in his arms.
A longer text this time, a bit of flattery… John’s trying, obviously. Making an effort to talk to Sherlock without scaring him off. Sherlock can appreciate that – he remembers very well how hard it was to find the right words when the felt like John didn’t want to hear from him.
Mrs Hudson is happy to babysit, especially when John explains it’s because he thinks Sherlock shouldn’t be alone right now. He feels like an impostor when Mrs Hudson gushes about him being “such a good friend”.
“Now, where were we,” John says and reaches for Sherlock’s erection, which has flagged a little due to Sherlock’s nervousness. John could use Sherlock’s decrease of interest to rest a little, but he doesn’t want to anymore. He strokes up and down Sherlock’s length slowly. Sherlock shudders and sighs deeply, his body melting closer to John.
“I love you too,” John says as he drops open-mouthed kisses everywhere he can reach. “So much, Sherlock, so much.”
“I want you to come from nothing but my tongue up your arse,” John whispers against Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock’s breath hitches. “Think you can do that?”
After that, they develop a sort of routine. Every two to four days, Sherlock will notice John exhibiting subtle signs of heightened need for sexual release, and prepare accordingly.  Most commonly, Sherlock will clean and prepare himself in the bathroom and then wait for John in his bedroom, where they'll have anal sex without much foreplay or nonsexual contact. Sherlock is usually on his front or his hands and knees, or, occasionally, lying on his side. He would have liked it face to face, pull John close, wrap both his arms and legs around him, but of course that's out of the question, impossible like so many other things. If for some reason Sherlock doesn’t have enough time for preparation, he’ll bring John off with his mouth. Sherlock prefers the blowjobs, really – he feels more in control that way, clothed, less vulnerable – but his research indicated that heterosexual couples generally consider oral sex only as a part of foreplay, so he tries to provide John with penetrative sex as often as he can.
But anyway, even if he went back to Sherlock now, what help could he be? Surely his presence would only be making things worse for him. Sherlock
Sherlock comes with a hoarse shout, followed a long, loud moan as John’s body moves on autopilot and fucks him through his orgasm, drawing it out until, finally, he stills.
Sherlock looks into John’s stormy blue eyes. Nothing is magically solved, but hearing John say he wants to be his friend is everything to Sherlock.
John making love to him. Rewriting the memories of the assault with tenderness, erasing bruises with caresses, dissolving anger and pain with mutual desire and care.
He leaned on the sink and retched but nothing came up. Then a huge, dry sob tore itself painfully from his chest and he sunk to the floor, letting waves defeat and despair tear through his useless body.
“Repeat it,” John says again, but this time his voice drops an imperceptible increment and suddenly it’s Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers speaking, and all of Sherlock’s blood rushes to his groin with a suddenness that almost knocks the wind out of him.
There are many things John would like to say to that. To ask if it worked. If Sherlock got the data he wanted. To tell him that someone who loved him would not care how much experience he had. That they’d be happy to be as gentle and patient with him as he needed them to be. That first times are rarely perfect but that anyone who found Sherlock disappointing would be a fool and not worthy of his time. That Sherlock, of all people, deserved his first time to be with someone who cared about him, someone he trusted, not a stranger for hire.
“You don’t have--” Robert begins, but cuts himself off when Sherlock rolls his eyes at him. Now that the challenge is successfully behind him, he’s much less willing to be coddled. He finds a new condom and slides between Robert’s legs, taking as much of him as he can into his mouth. He feels too uncoordinated for any of the fancier tricks he’s learned, but Robert likes it messy and sloppy just as well, so that’s all right. Afterwards, he lets Robert pull him into one of his wonderful hugs and he relaxes into the warmth of him as Robert nods off.
Sherlock moans as he feels his orgasm building at the root of his spine, fucking into the tight circle of their hands. He says John’s name because now he can. “John,
“Hang on,” John said, and Sherlock immediately let go of him, tensing. Had he done something wrong? What had he done wrong?
John’s hands touched his hips and for a second he though John was going to do it, but then he realised John was gently pulling him down from his position, lowering him on the bed.
One thing that’s both a deterrent and a motivator is the fact that Robert is very well-endowed. More so than John, Sherlock thinks, although he can’t be sure. But he’s fairly certain – he doesn’t think he would have survived something of Robert’s size being shoved inside him so brutally. For some reason, the size feels significant and important – if he can be penetrated by penis larger than John’s and enjoy it, everything will be all right. John will not have broken him, and there will be a chance to make things right again.
Sherlock tensed. Yes, of course. Why didn’t he think of it sooner? The nature of their relationship had changed, it was now time to cement their new status as romantic partners by engaging in coitus.
Robert puts the mug and tea towel he’s holding carefully on the counter. “You said you didn’t want that.”
“You’ll be safe, won’t you?” Robert asks him the evening before Sherlock is due to leave, and there’s no mistaking his meaning.
me,” he says again and for a moment he looks like he’s going to laugh as he takes a step towards Sherlock. Sherlock instinctively takes a step back, adrenaline coursing through his veins. He has miscalculated,
“Harder,” Sherlock gets out between moans and John is happy to comply, thrusting in deep with force, skin slapping against skin.
John’s head jerks up and he flinches back imperceptibly, but to his credit, there are no denials, no protestations of hetersexuality. Instead, he looks Sherlock squarely in the eye.
He’s asking if he should reciprocate, Sherlock realises. Somehow, it hadn’t occurred to him that could happen, but it should have – John
John as much as he wanted. It had been pure bliss – but now it was time to move things a step further.
They meet by the pond in Regent’s Park to watch ducks. Sherlock wanted something simple and close to his home so that he could easily escape if it proved too much, and he takes Jack with him for support even though he really can’t be trusted around birds, but in the end… it’s okay.
