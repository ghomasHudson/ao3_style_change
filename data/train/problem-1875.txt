But John hadn’t become a soldier because he was trepidatious. He made the tea and hurried back to their room. Sherlock was regal in purple, sitting up and waiting. “Let it steep a bit, but you’ll have the warmth of it in your hands.”
John kept a steadying hand on Sherlock’s back as they walked the few steps to the bath. He was glad of the bubbles to hide nakedness, but he still wasn’t able to strip off like he normally would. There were too many pictures spinning in his head.
Sherlock seemed hurried almost manic as he pulled several bottles from the bag. “Body paint and oral gel.  Here, this one will be your favorite.”
John brushed his fingers across Sherlock’s and plunged.  “Your father’s cruelty wasn’t the worst of it.”
John’s first blow job had been behind the pizzeria where he had a part time job to put himself through uni so the scent of garlic proved a ready aphrodisiac. He spurted through Sherlock’s fingers onto the silk shirt on the floor.
“The thing that makes Rudolph different from everybody else turns out to be what they need most and he saves the day. He guides Santa through the fog to get the misfit toys and they all are given to children who need them.”
John’s hackles rose at the unfamiliar voice in Sherlock’s mouth. He wished his lover weren’t such an excellent mimic.
while eating warm mince pies that he had baked himself.  There was going to be peace on earth and peace in his fucking flat if he had to do it at gunpoint. He called Molly.
The mince pies were out of the oven, golden and steaming on a special tray borrowed from Mrs. Hudson; all the other treats were arranged on the coffee table on little china Christmas plates he had found at a charity shop. He had even used a cozy so that the tea would stay warm throughout the video. He poured tea into his mug, added the milk from a small Santa pitcher, stirred and sipped. It was good.
Here was one of those times when John didn’t want to be a doctor or use his vastly improved powers of observation. He wanted to be naïve and stupid and happy. Besides, he was just skirting the edge of all the horror he felt that Sherlock had been carrying so much pain around for the entire time they had known each other. How terrible were the other things John hadn’t observed?
He rested his cheek on the soft, warm bunny laden shoulder; he nuzzled, he grunted, he whimpered. Then he remembered that Sherlock needed a helping hand. His own arousal went up to eleven when he gripped his partner’s cashmere clad cock. Steel wrapped in more warmth and softness. His hand glided; Sherlock shouted encouragement.
Sherlock moved his fingers up and down John’s rodlike protruberance as if he were playing the violin, the calluses he had acquired from said playing had rendered his fingertips nearly insensate but he soldiered on. The deadened skin cells proved to be scratchy against John’s most sensitive skin but the rough treatment appealed to his yet unexplored submissive side. Mostly he was just glad to have someone else’s hand there since his sex life was dryer than the desert of Aghanistan and his bed was colder than the nights in that wartorn country.
Once they were paid for and a sensible shirt for work also procured and purchased, John was outside the shop to a corner away from prying eyes to pet the fleecy fabric. The soft warmth took him back to a time before he knew about wars and death; to a time when his parents were still kind and Harry was his friend.  He wore blanket sleepers when he was prone to kicking off the covers, not because he was having PTSD nightmares but because he dreamed about riding a bicycle or playing with a puppy.
They faced each other, glancing occasionally into the mirror. “It’s far too grand for me,” John said, reaching up to give Sherlock a chaste thank you kiss.
Sherlock’s head shot up, his eyes searching John’s for the source of the anger. His shoulders sagged with relief when he knew it wasn’t directed at him, and John’s heart cracked further. He rephrased. “Who gave you the idea that you had anything to do with your uncle being a sick fuck?”
They were huddled and cuddled and nearly too warm, dozy in the heat when John summoned the courage to ask, “Why the sock?”
“On the way home, I pretended to be asleep and heard him telling Mummy. ‘A big boy of eleven crying like a toddler over a television program. I was mortified. David will rub it in for years.’ Mummy didn’t say anything so I knew she was angry with me too.”
“I told him all of it and then he pulled me in his lap and rocked me. I felt safe and that was new to me. Nobody ever comforted me like that until—“
Sherlock snapped his phone and his heart shut. Without even making eye contact, he grabbed coat and scarf and hurled an explanation back at John while taking the stairs at a gallop. St. Bart’s again and likely another all nighter.
Sherlock was tousled and trusting. John pulled him in as if for a hug, his gorge rising at the cloying motion of open arms. Then with one sharp motion, John ripped open the trap door and unzipped the zip. He pushed a logy Sherlock over the table and spanked the hell out of ass and his own hand. The slaps punctuated an unprecedented speech, John having learned nothing from trying new things. “It’s not…nice…to disobey…Daddy…when he’s…trying to…do the…laundry.”
He went to the mirror and preened, knowing that showing pleasure in the gift might be the best tonic for Sherlock’s hurts. “It’s monogrammed.”
He turned off the taps and tested the water. This late at night, they could get it blistering hot because the rest of the house was settling in for sleep.  Maybe the hot water would wash away some of the poison. Back on the sofa, Sherlock was curled under the blanket, eyes closed, listening or dosing, but John was pleased to see that four of the gingerbread men were missing heads and a mince pie was gone from the tray.
“Thank you,” John said, pulling his briefs back on, wincing as they came in contact with his raw, limp penis.
No argument. After he took another bite, Sherlock put the remote in John’s hand and nodded toward the telly. John’s hand shook as he pressed the button.  The story was charged for him now, his own loneliness over the years fading to nothing in the face of Sherlock’s solitary journey. He slipped his hand under the blanket to stroke Sherlock’s bare foot, marveling at the long toes that he could almost twine with his fingers. As if he knew, Sherlock curled his toes inward. John looked up to a tiny smile.
John had been hugged, snuggled, cuddled, nuzzled, nursed, sucked and slow fucked. Not one for a lot of drama in his sex, he found himself wanting belts, chains, cuffs and a studded collar. He also wanted a big juicy steak rare with a side of rabbit stew and a whole chicken. Sherlock had been deboned.
In the kitchen, John switched on the kettle and leaned heavily against the table. Did he have the option of letting the story stop where it was? He could go back to the bedroom with tea and they would snog a little and fall asleep under fading candle light, warm in their new flannel sheets with the serpent secret curled between them.
But this year was going to be the celebration to end all celebrations, his first official Christmas with Sherlock, together in their own bed in their own flat. They had been starting something the previous year but not enough to carry the weight of a full Watson’s worth of merriment so John had spent it with Harry soused to the gills while Sherlock had ridden with Mycroft to Mummy’s for the dreaded Christmas dinner.  At Sherlock’s return, the flat had been filled with a terrible silence on the consulting detective’s side of things except for random shouted invectives directed at relatives John had never heard of.
Sherlock had been waiting patiently, slumped over the table, until John stepped back and then there was a half hearted attempt to move away so that John could slam him back down. “Your ass is so red,” he said, running his hand across it. “This tool will make pretty white lines in all that red. What should I write? You’re good at puzzles. Tell me what I’m spelling.”
Two feet on the stairs. One consulting detective with a shopping bag, striding across the room, sliding his coat off and tossing it on the chair. He plopped down and slid until his legs were under the coffee table and his head resting on the back of the sofa.  He didn’t look at John, but John was content to have him near. They both stared straight ahead at the snowman rolling over the hill with his brolly, resembling Mycroft at his highest weight.
After two hours, Sherlock began to stir, and it occurred to John that he was being given the chance to love the little eleven year old boy inside. He could replace some of the bad memories and maybe reclaim a bit of Christmas for him by babying him. For all of Maddy Watson’s faults, she had made sure that John was hugged and kissed and spoiled rotten when he was sick. John could give Sherlock that full attention and care.  With the wound lanced, he needed to make the rest of the evening about soothing recovery.
Sherlock was digging again in the bag and produced a blinking Rudolph nose on a bit of elastic. “What if I wore this?”
“He patted my shoulder and told me to run off and play as if nothing strange had happened. He knew I wouldn’t tell. I went to the loo and there was some blood, but I had a meal to get through so I sat through all of the courses and I could feel his fingers in me the whole time.”
It echoed. He smelled chlorine. Oh god. His legs started to go so he leaned against the wall. There was a pause long enough for John’s vision to return and his heart to leave his throat and drop back down in his chest.
How were they ever going to get past this? The careful foundation they had worked so hard to build was crumbling.  Once he recovered from the initial revelation, Sherlock would never be able to trust him again. In the morning, John would make tea and toast for him, take down every last decoration, and spend the rest of his life trying to make it up to his lover and best friend. But if he were in Sherlock’s place, he would never forgive the calloused way his needs had been ignored.
John was trying to get some feeling back into his genital yogurt dispenser when Sherlock returned with a nearly empty tube. “This was full on Monday. You have been busy.”
At 221B, John expected surprises that exploded or smelled of death or stared at him with lifeless eyes. He did not expect cut glass round candle holders with clear tea lights. The flames looked like they were dancing in midair all along the windowsill.
When John was nearly there, he withdrew and stripped off jumper and starched shirt and finally, his cotton vest. He re-entered, pulled Sherlock back against his bare chest and wrapped the vest around the consulting cock. Sherlock shook his head, drops of sweat flying from the ringlets. He squirmed away, but John was strong and stroppy and past ready.
They lay side by side, looking into each other’s eyes and before Sherlock even spoke, John was gripped by his pain.
John thought about hopes he had for future Christmases once Sherlock was more compliant. He recalibrated. No Christmas card pictures with John in his personalized Santa hat and Sherlock in an elf hat. No skating hand in hand at the park. No caroling for Mrs. Hudson. No secret Santa with Lestrade and Donovan. No snow angels. Those were right out.
Sherlock needed his full attention and not out of any sort of egomania, but because the man was wounded with an infection that had been buried all his life. John would have to caretake now and have his own break down much later.
Sherlock’s dark curls appeared around the open door followed by his forehead. With a wink he said, “Next time, let’s dispense with all that business about the nipples. I’ll buy milk while I’m out.”
“Fine, keep your bloody coat on, but when you steal the covers tonight, I’ll still be warm even if I need to use the loo.”
“Sorry, love,” John said, withdrawing and warming them in his fleecy armpits. “I should have asked first.”
There was another serrated pause. John removed the mug that Sherlock was twisting in his hands until it creaked and set it on the bedside table.
John struggled to see in the flickering candle light, but when he looked, really looked in his lover’s eyes, there was sadness and fear. “These past few weeks, you weren’t intending to be stroppy, were you?”
Sherlock’s eyes darted about and his mouth was pursed in that way he had when he was holding in an insult.
“Bring your blanket. You can curl up on the sofa while I make you tea and a sandwich.  Something mild, a toasted cheese maybe?”
The impasse was on day nine with no end in sight. Sherlock had not called or texted or answered calls or texts all day, and John had thirty minutes of down time while pastry dough chilled in the refrigerator beside a quart jar of an unknown black liquid. He was going to watch
This story is about truth. If we can talk openly about sick and ugly things instead of letting them fester as secrets, then we can make the world safer for victims to come forward.
John wasn’t a prude, nor was he adverse to toys, but he and Sherlock had been content for many months with each other’s bodies. They purchased lube at the chemist's and it was enough. One time they had run low and used olive oil and the scent had made for an interesting change, but something was strange about this sudden interest.
John noted the flush in Sherlock’s pinched cheeks, the sentences getting shorter, his voice getting higher.
AUTHOR’S NOTE: I wanted to make a Christmas card for people who might not have a happy Christmas because of family secrets. If Christmas is dangerous or scary or sad or triggering for you, I want you to know that I understand. It sucks; it’s unfair, and many times the abuser walks away unscathed. I am not ready to say with total certainty that it gets better.
There was preparation and entry and business as usual but enhanced by six foot of consulting fleece and the smiling, nodding visage of one hundred little bunny faces and one hundred twitching pink noses. John was fucking a cloud on Sunnyfuck Farm.
There may only be one diva at Baker Street but the drama is bipartisan. John had been an integral part of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers Improv Group. He searched the kitchen for props while one hand kneaded a steaming cheek. Kneaded. “Don’t you dare move!” he said, hoping for rebellion.
The combination of punishment and puzzle would need to be revisited but John’s agenda was narrowing. “Very good start. I wrote GET OFF NOW.”
After a toasty visit to the loo, John went to the kitchen and prepared an extra large breakfast for himself, one he would likely be eating alone, but he made enough for two. His feet were happily warm on the frigid lino of the kitchen even though he could see the puffs of his breath while he cooked.  Bacon, eggs, mushrooms, beans, tomato, and toast with jam. Coffee instead of tea. The flat smelled as close to heaven as any combined lab and living quarters could.
“He didn’t stop jabbing into me until he came and I was throbbing by then. He let go of himself and squeezed my cock hard and that hurt too.”
“Mmmm, I deduce you may need more stimulation.” John who had been to three continents thus earning the nickname, Three Continents Watson, pressed eager lips to his companion’s nipple.
“I will not watch clay figures jerk about to an ancient sound track. I will not contract diabetes from baby animals and elves frolicking and I will not learn the ‘true meaning’ of the holiday.” The greatest and only consulting detective had used air quotes far too close to the tip of John’s nose.
“He always smelled of garlic, but he probably didn’t know because his nostrils were packed with hair. Enormous hairy arms too.”
In the loo, John sat for some time watching the minty bubbles rise in the tub. How was his heart still beating? How could he do ordinary things? He wanted to sob the whole story out into his grandmother’s lap while she stroked his hair. Part of him wanted to walk out into the rain and never come back to the ugliness and the ruined dreams. And the damnedest thing was that he was the ugliness. Sherlock had good reason for all the bits of himself that were abrasive, but what was John’s excuse? He had tortured the one bright spot in his life without knowing it.
Sherlock’s eyes were glassy and his breathing labored. The doctor in John came up with words like agitated, shocky, altered, but the lover was gritting his teeth until his jaw popped to keep from crying out. He wanted to make it stop. There couldn’t be more.
“Mycroft, I’m sure Mummy will be devastated, but then she still has you, doesn’t she? John wants us to establish some traditions of our own. I have to be a good boyfriend. He’s baking mince pies and there’s going to be a tree. Isn’t a healthy relationship what you’ve always wanted for me?”
John couldn’t think beyond the next day, but he smiled and continued doing what he could to redeem the night. “Fancy a bath?”
“For weeks. What are you asking of him at home, John? He gave me a look so vicious this morning that a clump of my hair fell out.”
Sherlock’s eyes were glassy as he petted his own arm. Even the bunnies appeared to be seeking escape, their tiny ears at half mast. Someone had to take the bunny by the horns/ears/balls. John Hamish, Hell Yes, Hamish Watson was that someone. He got up and extended a hand. “Come on, love, up you go.”
“No, please continue. I’ve confessed my affections and I’m willing to help you along in any perversion that you fancy. If your suckling becomes tiresome, I’ll simply go to my mind palace.”
Sherlock’s lips were curled with disgust and John suspected with a sinking feeling that more than a hug had occurred. He hoped to be wrong. John’s mouth was dry but the question had to be asked, “What happened after the hug?”
Sherlock growled when he came, and the little rabbits’ ears went from ten and two to five and seven. With a last mighty hump, John pushed the last cloud from the sky and gripped bony hips and laid his stubbled cheek against a razor sharp one.
There hadn’t been any enormous seasonal demands on public or private Sherlock. No, John had kept things very simple for the first time. Decorations but nothing that disturbed experiments or essential piles. Christmas music played quietly, an all orchestral cd featuring strings that John had bought especially. John would attend Christmas eve services alone when he really wanted a hand in his during the prayers, and then presents when he got home after midnight. Dinner for two, which he would cook on Christmas Day. Sherlock had agreed to all of it until John had asked for the one tradition that had never wavered since John Watson’s 18th year, Christmas on his own at university.  Sherlock’s refusal had been absolute.
So John listened to the scuffing, the creak of the night table drawer, the creak of the bureau drawer, some rummaging, and then more scuffing.  Finally Sherlock was coming towards him with the lube in hand, but this fact hardly registered because Sherlock had a pink and gray argyle sock protruding from the front of his new pajamas and there was definitely bobbing with occasional weaving. He placed his hands firmly on the kitchen table and wiggled his feet apart into a ‘frisk me’ stance.
Sherlock’s fists were clenched and he was rocking, his body joining his mind in the past. “When I stopped crying, he still held me. He kissed my forehead just like Mummy used to do, and I put my arms around his neck and looked up at him. Then he was kissing me like I’d seen in movies. His tongue was in my mouth and it felt very good so I kissed him back.”
“Should have got the lube first,” Sherlock corrected, the scuff slide of his gait heading toward the bedroom.
The last one was hypocritical, considering what he did in the shower.  “Merry Fucking Christmas, John. You just grudge fucked yourself.”
Catching sight of his face in the mirror, John expected to see cuts and bruises, but for someone that was shattered, he looked fairly normal. No one would have to know that he was crying inside as his relationship trickled down the drain with the last of the bubbles. Dragging the towel hurriedly over his skin, John reached for his new dressing gown. His fingers stroked across the family crest he hadn’t even known he had. “Beyond expectation,” he whispered.
Sherlock opened his mouth, shut it again. The words would not come. He thought perhaps John was right, but how could that be? How could Mrs Hudson, who had loved Rosie like her own grandchild, ever have tolerated a world where Rosie willingly put herself into harm's way?
"They went out early," she'd said, settling Rosie on the ground in her sitting room, which she'd gated off from the kitchen and hallway. "Something about brunch and meeting the bridesmaids."
"No time to chat. Bit of a rush. Life or death situation. You know how it is," he says. He lets the door slam behind him as he leaves.
There was an older woman standing at his shoulder. She was smartly dressed in a dark suit. She was not holding an umbrella. Her fair, greying hair seemed to wilt in the damp. Her eyes were shrewd.
"Besides," John said. "I'm pretty sure the butcher is hiding a dark secret. You might want to look into it."
He turned around and went down the stairs, the shrieking, wailing cacophony retreating behind him. He ignored his coat, went through the front door and out into the cold night, his breath steaming in front of him. He took one, two, then three steps before stopping, putting his hands on his knees, letting his head drop with a miserable little groan.
John, smiling and glowing and happy, wavering unknowingly on a knife's edge, only weeks away from plunging into a dark pit of terrible tragedy and guilt and remorse and anger and pain. John, smiling without knowing what he'd have to carry with him for the rest of his life.
"How long have you been selling secrets?" Mycroft asked. His voice was mild. He might have been asking her what she'd had for lunch.
Mrs Hudson sighed, stood up. Petted at him once more. "Now," she said, her voice gone brusque. "How about we try that again? I'll bring up some nibbles."
"Ah, but what better way to showcase my poor behaviour than by insisting on unreasonable deadlines?"
Sherlock could keep him, but what he wants comes at the direct expense of John's happiness and well-being. It is unacceptable, unsustainable. John is collapsing before his very eyes.
"I know what I said," John said. "But I also—well. I guess I wasn't expecting you to actually listen."
Harry had warned him, after all, but she was really the last person fit to be doling out relationship advice.
Janine had slotted right in at Baker Street. And Sherlock certainly seemed to enjoy her company. He spoke to her. He asked for her input. He
Anderson was talking quite animatedly. Cheerfully, even. Sherlock was—well—Sherlock was ignoring him, more or less. Staring at his phone. He did not seem particularly bothered.
Sherlock maintained a rotating stable of false Facebook accounts. He had, it seemed, spent years building them up—adding photos, checking in at various locations, cultivating a varied enough list of friends as to make them seem entirely real. Real enough that he could usually get a client (or suspect, or witness) to accept a friend request without second thought, thus opening up their entire history of social media posts for his perusal.
But that was not his life, could not be his life. Not now. He'd made his choices, even if they had not felt much like choices at the time. He had responsibilities.
Sherlock had hesitated, just a moment, and then he'd laughed too. The sound was rich, and genuine. His eyes had been bright.
Rosie abandoned her cars, toddled over to him with clumsy steps. He bent to pick her up, tucked her against his chest. She tilted her head, listened to the music.
Sherlock had been very drunk. He'd likely spent the day hungover and aching, much like John had. Even worse, probably, since he wasn't much of a drinker. John hoped Janine had thought to take care of him, that she'd—
"In any case," Sherlock said, looking briefly flustered. "The hantavirus research. There are interesting possibilities surrounding identification of soil samples in cases where animal excrement is present, with certain applications allowing me to better pinpoint locations where violent crimes took place. Richard invited me back to his hotel to view some of his samples—" he hesitated, his cheeks slowly flushing up. "Oh."
"Well," John said. He looked up at the ceiling for a moment. "If you ever need help arranging another daring escape, you, er, you know where to find me."
"Excellent. Good. Glad we've had this talk," Sherlock said. His voice had gone alarmingly bright. He smiled, a terrifyingly soulless flash of teeth. Turned and went down the stairs without another word.
"You never got your coffee," John said. His voice fell flat to his own ears. "Think I might be kneeling in it, actually."
He looked back at the two men. "Well. I guess you should be—I don't know. Stumbling drunk? Flirting with some woman up at the bar? Starting a brawl?"
John deflated against the back of the booth. "Yeah," he said, and he was surprised at how tired he felt. "I'm not actually surprised."
Mary was dead. John was—John was lost to him. Possibly forever. Probably forever. Unless he found something, some way to draw him back.
"SHIT!" John looks down at the pages still crumpled in his left hand. Still missing Sherlock's signature in one stubborn, stupid spot.
"It's a valuable animal," Gregory says. "All that research Simpson was doing, for his 'book.' The perfect cover, really, when you think about it. He'd familiarised himself with the routines, and then made his move. Straker must have surprised him as he was leading the horse across the field."
"Not bad, Watson," he told her, looking at the cars. He reached out, tapped his finger on the top of one which was lying on its side. "Though if you're going for realism, an accident where the car is struck from this direction would actually result in something more like this." He picked up the car, carefully set it on its other side.
At ten-fifteen, Mrs Hudson came back in. He opened his mouth to say something and she shook her head, crossed the room with quick determined little steps. She sat on the edge of his chair, leaned down, hugged him.
Sherlock, who had opened his mouth to respond, turned to look at her. She was cradling Rosie against her chest. The little girl had calmed, no longer seemed wild-eyed and desperate.
Molly's cat was stalking something along the wall. Its tail switched against the floor as it tensed up, readied itself to pounce.
Retirementlock. After an argument and fifteen years of silence between them, Sherlock is surprised to find John at his door.
"You don't need to thank me," she said. "That's not—I didn't do it for thanks. I did it because. Because that's what friends do. And I'm Rosie's godmother, and I love her, and she needs—" Molly paused, bit her lip. "I mean, she
"Mysterious family emergency and then nearly dashed to bits by a rogue taxi driver," Mary said. Her eyes were sparkling. She leaned across the booth, her voice dropping, conspiratorial. "Are you
Sherlock's lip twitched, a faint smile. Genuine. He looked down at the table, still smiling. "You're welcome."
"Don't you think they're moving a bit quickly?" Mrs Hudson called after him, her voice dropped into an absurd stage whisper. "I know I'm a bit old-fashioned, but she's only been staying here for a week, and after the way things ended last time—"
Sherlock sighed, shook his head. For a moment he looked heartbreakingly bewildered. "Something." He pursed his lips, looked away. "I don't know. Not important. Is it important?"
Sherlock heaved what could only be called a long-suffering sigh. He studied the man for a moment, his gaze sweeping him up and down. He turned back towards Janine.
Sherlock banged cupboard doors and something broke in the sink before he returned with a dark bottle.
“I like them very much. I hope Mycroft has ample footage of you purchasing them. But all I’ve ever needed is your body, Sherlock. Kiss me?”
Sherlock reappeared, resplendent in baby rabbits, plate and mug in hand. He would not meet John’s gaze. Breakfast was silent except for the occasional groan as a bit of crisp bacon or peach jam tasted of miracles. John unclenched further. A holiday pending with no cases, no Holmes’ family appearance required, no party with friends to be insulted. They had been on case after case nonstop as well as his longer hours at the surgery during cold and flu season. Taking stock, he realized he needed rest, good food, and several shags to make it a proper celebration.
Sherlock curled his long fingers around the mug, resting it on his knees which he pulled into his chest. John switched the light back off and let the candles once again create a more intimate space. Then he sat on the edge of the bed, facing Sherlock. When their eyes met, they both held their breath for a moment.
Sherlock felt terrified for an entirely different reason as he pulled away slightly to make red, puffy eye contact with John.
“I find it fascinating that despite asking general questions about what I have been doing, you have yet to truly search for any answers. Why is that, John? Normally, one would demand to know why their flatmate was smelling them, touching them…” Sherlock’s voice lowered almost to a purr, “tasting them…” John shuddered as the image of Sherlock’s tongue dragging across his pants flashed through his mind.
Springing back up from his bed, John quickly made his way downstairs and into the kitchen where Sherlock was still bent over his petri dishes.
“Sherlock, have you been stealing my-” John cut himself off, not quite sure if he could truly finish that question.
sorry John. I will never stop apologizing to you for the rest of our lives if you’ll let me. I never figured this into my calculations, I never imagined me going away like I did would affect you in this way. It was never my intention to do this to you. If I had known it would affect you like this I would have done things differently, but at the moment there were no other options I could think of and I had to keep all of you safe! I had to! Please!
Sherlock pushed forward those last scant few inches and seemed to drape his body across John’s. His senses were utterly overwhelmed at this point and he felt more keyed up than ever before in his life. John was positively shaking and finally had to admit something to himself he hadn’t dared to look at this whole time. He wanted Sherlock. He wanted him with every fiber of his being.
Another day, as John was writing down their latest adventure to post on his surprisingly popular blog, he felt the weight of someone’s gaze. Sure enough, when he looked up, Sherlock was in his chair, hands steepled in their usual position, looking at him. Instead of his gaze glazing over as it usually would when he entered his mind palace, Sherlock’s eyes seemed to pierce right through him. It was as though John could feel Sherlock’s gaze like a physical caress, and he couldn’t bring himself to say anything as he watched Sherlock’s eyes roam over every inch of his body. It was almost painful for John to refocus on his writing and ignore the tightness in his throat and trousers at being the unsuspecting subject to the observations of such a man. He was glad his computer was covering his traitorous dick.
“No.” Tunnel vision was slowly setting in and he suddenly noticed there was a stain on the tablecloth underneath his straining white knuckles.
At this point the only thing holding John up was Sherlock, and as John’s aftershocks faded, Sherlock let John’s cock slip out of his mouth and he leaned forward to bury his nose in the wiry pubic hair at it’s base, inhaling deeply and moaning his pleasure.
John was beginning to wonder less what was wrong with Sherlock and more what was wrong with himself.
Wandering aimlessly into the kitchen, he started going through the motions of making tea and just as he was about to check if the milk was spoiled, as per usual, John’s body jerked so hard all he could do was watch as the glass shattered and the milk started to seep into his socks. He was at Baker Street. This was Baker Street. What the hell was he doing at Baker Street?! Looking up as though pulled by an invisible, inexorable string, his eyes fell on Sherlock’s backlit silhouette standing in the kitchen doorway.
"They didn’t send me anywhere, they just moved me to his flat. They did take away all his sharp knives though. Silly really, I would only off myself with my own gun, otherwise it wouldn’t feel right. Is that something I should say?” He asked himself distractedly, “probably not. Ah well.” Shaking his head, he continued slowly, “After that he got me up every day, helped me do some stretches, took me to work, picked me up, fed me, he even had to help me shower sometimes when I just couldn’t move on my own… I should get him a good scotch or something. Anyways, I was finally getting to the point where I was glad they had stopped me. A couple months ago I started volunteering at a soup kitchen, I went and got a library card, I even started going on dates again. Nothing drastic, just to make connections again, I guess.” Here John finally turned to look at Sherlock again who he was mildly surprised to see had tears streaming down his face.
John really should have considered that he was merely rushing closer to danger because as soon as he was in their front door, he was being crowded up against it by a lanky detective. Damn Sherlock and his long legs. Even as he tried to stop himself from hyperventilating, John noted how Sherlock seemed to be making sure that no parts of their bodies were touching as he bracketed John’s body with his arms against the door.
John tried to continue as he stumbled over his words, “And now… you… I… I feel like all that progress is gone. I just - just please go away. I’m tired.” At these words, his body finally gave out and he slowly slumped to the ground and curled up next to his grave. As darkness overtook him he smiled slightly, welcoming it as an old friend.
. The reaction was almost instantaneous. Sherlock jerked with a stuttered moan and stiffened through his release. Slumping forward, John watched while trying to catch his breath as Sherlock’s body jerked involuntarily through the aftershocks of what must have been an impressive orgasm.
As John brought himself off almost violently that night, he vaguely wondered why he was still going to therapy, because it clearly wasn’t working.
“... Jo-hn…” Sherlock’s voice broke and he cleared his throat as he attempted to start again, “We… We still
?” John spit the name as he would vitriol. “Just a nice holiday while you ‘went away’ for a bit, yeah?” Sherlock’s skull thumped hard enough against the carpet as John shook him that John wondered briefly whether Sherlock would end up mildly concussed, but immediately dismissed the thought in favor of continuing his diatribe. “You DIED Sherlock. YOU DIED. And you made me
What had gone wrong? Surely after everything John would have been pleased to see him. There were many possibilities that he had calculated; everything ranging from divine retribution to kissing (although, that had been more of a fantasy than calculation if he was being honest with himself). This simple denial had not been one of the options. It was as though someone had told John the sky was clearly neon green and he was simply rejecting the obvious insanity as concisely and irrefutably as possible.
“I don’t know what all of this was, Sherlock. Was it an experiment? Did you just want to see how I would react? Did you only want to know how far you could push the boundaries? How far I’d let you go?”
Bloody hell. John slumped back on his bed trying to convince himself this was all just a bad dream. It didn’t work.
Sherlock moaned as though he were in absolute ecstasy and another shockwave of pleasure shook through John as he watched Sherlock shove a hand down his pants and strip his own cock as he swallowed the last remnants of John’s release.
Sherlock’s voice lowered even further and the whisper shouldn’t have sounded so seductive. “Tell me what you observed, John.”
Deductions started bubbling up unbidden as Sherlock grasped desperately at the only way he knew how to process things. He became hyper aware of everything about John as he finally allowed himself to truly look at the man in front of him.
The very first thing he can remember was when they had been tailing an especially crafty criminal. John and Sherlock had been forced to wait for nearly 45 minutes in a very cramped closet for the burglar to finally enter the house and make his move. There had been nowhere else to hide and after the adrenaline had started to fade, John had started to feel uncomfortable for more than one reason.
“When you… ‘went away’?” Suddenly it was no longer gray nothingness that encircled John. Launching himself from the armchair John shoved Sherlock onto his back and nearly choked him as he clenched at Sherlock’s collar.
John could merely get up and walk away, but then he might have to deal with a Sherlock tantrum, so no thank you. He could demand that Sherlock stop, but, even though he hated to admit it, he was starting to really enjoy the sensation. Maybe it was best to just let Sherlock continue to what he was doing and act as though nothing was amiss. It wasn’t hurting anyone, after all. It wasn’t until later that John woke up covered in a soft blanket that he realized he had become so relaxed due to the touching that he had fallen asleep.
"I'm thinking of retiring," Sherlock said, out of the blue. He was surprised to realise that he meant it.
It had made him uneasy. Sherlock was usually far more loquacious. He tended to bombard John with stream of consciousness texts throughout the day. Instead, almost a full week had passed with nothing.
"Whatever it is that you're prevaricating on, just do it," Sherlock said into his pillow. "For God's sake, just stop thinking so loudly."
Sherlock had gone to him, had taken him gently into his arms. Years ago, he could never have imagined offering physical comfort in such a way. It had, over time, become second nature to him.
Sherlock had cleaned up well. His hair had been clipped, shorter than it was in any of the press photos John had seen. His suit was clearly expensive, though oddly ill-fitting. He must have lost a good deal of weight during his ordeal.
But Rosie had not answered his soft knock, nor had she responded to his louder knock or his call of her name. And when he'd opened the door, he'd found an empty room and an open window.
The NSSL had only been able to give an approximate location. Storm systems are capricious, and Sherlock's team follows where they go.
So many years. So many hurts, large and small, between them. He'd expected to feel the ground shift under his feet, had expected something earth-shaking, something momentous.
John had wanted this. To see him like this, to have him like this. For so long, he'd wanted without ever really knowing what it was he'd wanted.
"It's one of the things that Mary and I bonded over, actually," Janine said, and she lifted her head, almost a challenge.
abrasive, John amended. It was a normal enough giggle. She just seemed to inject it with a bit more cruelty than necessary.
"Better than being late for my own funeral, one would assume," Sherlock said. He sounded a bit more like himself, his tone crisp, his eyes sharp.
Sherlock swallowed, looked away. It was bad enough that all of Scotland Yard had heard the recording. They were idiots, the lot of them, even the ones he liked. They could easily be led to believe that his weakness, his desperation had all been an act.
Underwater, the world faded to little more than the sound of his own frantic pulse, muted, subdued. He could not draw a breath.
And there he is, Sherlock Holmes himself, stretched out across the RV's roof, fiddling with what looks like the Doppler dish. It's been partially disassembled, lying in pieces next to him. He barks something down at the ground, his face scrunched up in irritation, before turning his attention back to whatever it is that he's doing.
Sherlock's stride faltered. He glanced at John. Could glean nothing from his face but a sense of guarded curiosity.
"Given your near-constant need to embellish and exaggerate on your blog, I'd have thought you were already well aware of the disconnect between fiction and reality," Sherlock murmurs.
Sherlock is fairly sure that John would not like to hear that thought verbalised, and so he keeps it to himself. It is, he thinks, not surprising. He is many things, but comforting has never been one of them.
At some point, John had a carton of chips thrust into his hand. He followed Sherlock to a bench, sat down. Sherlock shut his eyes, put his fingertips against his temples, hunched forward with his elbows on his knees. He did not say a word.
The buildings he glimpsed through fogged window glass were familiar. The car slid to a stop along the kerb.
Lucy snapped her gum. She was still studying him. "I could give you her number," she said, finally. "If you want. I think you'd get on."
"Mary Morstan," Sherlock said, and wasn't this all getting a bit tedious? John was all set to marry the woman, obviously his feelings for her were stronger than whatever he'd shared with Sholto.
John pushes up, and Sherlock rolls off of him without complaint. He stands, ignoring Sherlock's proffered hand.
"I was thinking the Thursday before the wedding. That'll give you plenty of time to recover from the inevitable hangover."
John hesitated for a moment, his heart kicking. Then he squared his shoulders, went to Sherlock. Pressed a gentle thumb to his cheek.
John's exhale whistled through his teeth. There was something disgusted in that sound, almost startling in its vehemence.
John reached out with his index finger, touched the pale face through the screen. Handsome bloke, if a bit dour. It was difficult to reconcile the man in the photographs with Lazarus, bedraggled and dirty and cloaked in shadows.
"You interfere when it's not necessary, and you fail to interfere when it is. Remind me, what exactly is the
Sherlock's eyes snapped to her. Molly's face was sheet-white and miserable. Her lips were pressed together in a grim tight line.
Blood on a grey t-shirt. Too much blood, too fast. It was a fatal wound, he knew it at first sight. There was nothing to be done, anything he attempted would be for his own comfort and not hers.
"Oh, but you can speculate about everything else," John snapped. "Every other person under the bloody sun—their life is an open book to you. But not—not—"
Sherlock, looking at him in the sitting room at 221B, his face sad and beseeching and open in a way it rarely was. Stitches above his eye.
"You act as if you believe this work is beneath you," Sarah said. "Like you think you're better than this."
"I'm afraid she's in over her head," he said. "She didn't want to tell you because she thinks she can solve it herself. She thinks she can help, she—Christ, she fancies herself some kind of investigator, and—"
"We're a bit short-staffed at the moment," she said. "That's why we're in a bit of a rush to get this opening filled. How are you liking Bristol?"
John reached up, clasped that hand with his own. He choked on his own words, unable to speak. He did not want to leave. He thought of his lonely little house on the other side of London, thought of the endless grey hours he spent there, staring at the telly while Rosie napped. While the rest of the world went on around him, leaving him behind.
Sometimes Mrs Hudson would come upstairs and sit with him, would tuck herself into John's chair and watch with her hands clasped in her lap. She'd always clapped when he was done. He'd always offered her a little bow in return. She'd smile at him, but her smile was a bit sad.
Culverton Smith, dead in his cell. And, worse than that: the uncomfortable realisation that Mycroft had listened to the tape, that he'd sat at his desk and poured himself a glass of something expensive and listened as Sherlock's unwavering faith in John finally cracked under Smith's smothering hand.
"Careful," Sherlock had said, and had held Mycroft's chair steady while Rosie clambered up onto the seat. Her trainers squeaked against the leather as she leaned forward to examine the painting on the wall.
There had been something strangely reserved about Sherlock. As if he were expending a great deal of effort to hold himself firmly in check. As if there were things he wanted to say, things he was biting back.
A waiter, clumsy and hovering, set a basket of bread down on the table and attempted to explain the chef's specials on offer. His accent was thick, French, struggling to wrap around the pronunciation of the Italian dishes.
"No," he said, and turned around. "I wanted more. I would have, you know. Eventually. I wanted—but then you left, you ran off, and—" he let out a growl of frustration, took the empty glass back out of the sink, refilled it. He lifted the glass to his lips but did not drink. "When we—" his breath caught on
"John," Sarah said, and he turned, offered her a smile as she came through the hallway from the back offices. She grasped his hand, shook it firmly.
Molly and Lestrade were objectively a good match. They got on well. Both of their lives tended to revolve around Sherlock, which was convenient. Molly was highly unlikely to cheat on Lestrade, which would be an improvement over his last relationship, and Lestrade was—well, he was an idiot, obviously, because everyone was, but he was still orders of magnitude more intelligent than Molly's last fiance.
He'd felt wrong the night before, all wrong, rushing out into the cold. Leaving Sherlock behind while still half-stunned and giddy over the enormity of what had passed between them. Putting Rosie down in her cot and then settling alone in the bed he used to share with Mary, exhausted but wired, his heart a tangled, sparking mess of yearning and joy and guilt and loneliness.
"It was a long drive," John says, feeling the need to defend himself and hating himself for it. There is a hot flush climbing up the back of his neck.
"Can't you make an educated guess?" she stood up from the chair, prowled towards him. He lifted his eyes to the ceiling and she laughed. "What's the matter? Have I made you uncomfortable?"
"Look, after things ended—um—I'm not good at this, yeah? You know that. I don't—I don't talk about this stuff."
When they first met, there had been a spark of possibility between them. He fought against it, muffled it, forced it down because he was afraid to examine it too closely. And then—then, all of a sudden, it was too late.
"I know," Sherlock said, cutting her off. He did not think he could bear to hear any more. He softened his voice, turned to look at her fully. There were tears in her eyes. It might have just been the reflection from the firelight. "I know that you see me, Molly. I know you always have."
Well. He'd be glad she wasn't dead. He'd be happy for Rosie's sake, that she would still have her mother. He suspected his lingering sense of guilt over everything that had happened might finally be put to rest.
Sherlock swiveled in his seat, glanced behind him. Other than a child's car seat, the rear seats were empty. Neat. Clean. Of course, the seat fabric had been professionally replaced after the—incident in question. An expensive endeavour, though quite successful. If one didn't know that Rosamund Watson had made her dramatic entrance into the world  in the back seat of this particular Audi, one would never guess.
"Murders," he said, clapping his hands together, looking expectantly at John. "The messier the better. Can no one manage to be
John cleared away the breakfast plates, washed up, wiped down the table. He bathed Rosie, set her up in the sitting room with a pile of toys. He plugged in the fairy lights, even though it was still bright outside.
"John," Mary says. Her face is pinched, worried, and, if he's being honest, a bit murderous. She puts her hand on her arm, drops her voice. "Please don't do anything on camera that you'll regret. No—let me rephrase. Don't do anything on camera that will force me to fire you."
"—and they were kind enough to share with Mary and I what I'd already begun to suspect." John swallows, blinks up at Sherlock. "The past is never as far behind as you think."
"If you say so," Mary winked. She leaned back in her seat. "So that taxi driver. The police said something about your laptop?"
Sherlock shut his eyes and listened to the rustle of John's clothing, the sound of his feet on the uneven floor, the creak of cabinet doors, the clink of spoons. Familiar sounds. Comfortable sounds. The sounds of home.
He settles into the passenger seat of Sherlock's truck, breathes it in. The cracked leather welcomes him like an old friend.
Sherlock had nodded. His lips pressed in an uncertain, tentative smile. "Of course." He paused, and John cursed the video's low resolution, because he was not quite able to glean anything from Sherlock's eyes. "Good night, John. And—good luck. With your interview."
He was not sure who moved first. But then they were embracing, holding each other fiercely, John was a warm solid weight against his chest, trembling with emotion. Sherlock shut his eyes, held on.
Sherlock huffed again, clearly already losing interest in the conversation. "Information that suggests I may have been hasty in my initial assessment."
Sherlock's lips were on his, clumsy and desperate and damp. Sherlock's hands were cupping his face, long fingers cold against his skin.
"I know," Sherlock said, and he smiled. "I wasn't casting aspersions on your skills, merely pointing out that in the brief time you worked with—" he brought his hands up to trace irritated finger quotes in the air between them, "—'Sarah Sawyer,' you were kidnapped, she was kidnapped, you fell asleep at your desk on no fewer than three separate occasions, you received two verbal and one written warning for late arrival and, most memorably, you once dropped your stethoscope on a patient's foot and ran out the door mid-examination to assist me with chasing down an art thief."
There is a woman waiting at the edge of the kerb, bundled up against the chill in a long coat. She is holding a leash, looking down at a small terrier sniffing the ground beside her.
Rosie had been remarkably patient, though he knew his luck was bound to run out eventually. What was meant to be a two hour trip was now going on six, with no reprieve in sight.
John had the volume muted, but could not bring himself to look away from that smug, leering face. The news stations played an endless cycle of clips—Smith at charity dinners, Smith cutting the ribbon at the grand opening of his hospital wing, Smith smiling for the camera, Smith at bloody Wimbledon.
He went to the windows, looked out at the flat grey sky, at the busy street below. The forecast was calling for more snow. Perhaps even more than they'd had the night he'd tumbled into the Thames. The thought left him cold, uncomfortable.
"How could you ever have thought this was a good idea?" he'd demanded of his brother, three days ago, while Rosie stood by his side. His brother, who had called Rosie his
Sherlock snorts with laughter. He has laughed more in his two encounters with John Watson than he has in years.
His heart thudded in his chest. He did not want to go downstairs, did not want to knock on Mrs Hudson's door with his hands shaking, did not want to lift Rosie against his chest and feel her stiffen up and begin to squall in distress. He'd frightened her once already tonight, and he was not particularly keen on doing it again.
And Walsingham—left behind without so much as an explanation. Pacing and sweating, worried and heartbroken. He'd never get over it, being left that way. Would he?
He frowned, pushed it shut and checked the lock. The carpet just below the window was damp, faintly dirtied. Rain must have blown in during the night. He turned back to look at Rosie, who rummaged through her toys, unaware.
"Oh?" Sherlock kept his voice light. He stared out the window. The street below was blurred, indistinct.
They go out into the fading daylight together. John opens the back door to his car and Buccaneer jumps in without complaint.
when she wanted to be. If he slipped up, he thought it likely that he'd end up handcuffed again. Or possibly shot.
And somehow it wasn't working, John was still looking at him with that mild expression, his eyes soft. That tone should have sent him storming off, should have
"Don't they say something about doctors being terrible patients? I'm sure someone says that." Sherlock narrowed his eyes, his face suddenly quite close. His breath was warm against John's cheek.
"What? It's—erm—it's fine. It's a bowtie. Not like there's much of a variety in bowties, yeah?" John plastered a smile on his face, dared a glance to his left.
The storm had intensified. The wind whistled and beads of ice pelted against the windows. Trains had been cancelled. News reports were advising people to stay close to home.
Sherlock had stiffened up in his chair, his shoulders rigid, his face carefully blank. "It's—I'm afraid a precedent has been set. It would seem. Unusual. If you weren't involved in the planning process."
Sherlock heard the distinct sound of tearing tulle. He looked away from the fire, cleared his throat.
Silence fell. Sherlock sat and breathed and listened to his brother do the same on the other end of the line. He did not fool himself into thinking Mycroft was sedentary. He, like Sherlock, was prone to long silences but his mind was never quiet.
Sherlock crossed the room to the window, looked out. The warmth was gone, replaced by an odd, trembling cold. He calculated the odds of a well-timed car accident. Stabbing. Gas line explosion. He was not picky.
be the ENTER key. There is a bright red key nestled in its place on the keyboard. This key reads EXECUTE.
And then—his entire demeanor changed. He was no longer an interested customer, but the cool, aloof consulting detective.
hoped it would all turn out to be some sort of scheme, though two years is a long time to play dead, wouldn't you say?"
That leaves one option, and a fairly good one, so John goes back down the stairs and out the door and walks the short distance to Regent's Park.
"Dinner. When I'm back in London," Sherlock spoke rapidly, as if aware their connection could be severed at any moment. "Lazarus took four days to rise from the dead, but I fear there may be something of an extended hospital stay in my future. Let's make it two weeks. There's a little Italian place on Northumberland Street. Angelo's."
"Indeed they do," Victoria said, turning away from Janine and looking Sherlock up and down instead. The tip of her tongue darted out to moisten her lips.
Sherlock's gaze snaps back to John. His mouth falls open. He looks as if he means to speak. He says nothing.
The cocaine in his pants drawer called to him, but Mrs Hudson had taken the overnight shift and Mrs Hudson was
"You've been here for a while, now," Sarah said. She sat down in one of the stiff-backed chairs facing John's desk. Her gaze was very direct. "Almost three years."
The gentle chime of a message notification startled him, and he jerked his attention back to his computer monitor.
"Um," John says, after a pause. He is wincing, now, as if it pains him to speak. "If you could—if you could possibly not mention—"
His words land with unexpected weight. Sherlock thinks and blinks and cannot move his mouth to speak. Even if he could, what is there to say? What can he possibly say in response to such a thing?
And, God help him, John looked to Sherlock, saw his friend's shoulders stiffen and his head whip around, felt the moment when his searching gaze landed on him.
That first Christmas had hit him hard. He'd found it impossible not to think of the last one, that terrible and awkward and
In the kitchen, a cheerful shout, a clinking of glasses. Mrs Hudson's tinkling laughter. Behind him, a rustle of fabric as Molly moved away from the fire, went to join the others.
"Never mind that." Sherlock dropped the leash on the ground and withdrew something from his pocket—what appeared to be an entire turkey sandwich, wrapped loosely in paper—and hurled it towards a group of teenagers sitting in the shade under an ash tree.
"Only—" he said, and he pressed his lips together, gave a rueful smile. "I'm a little late. Trouble with on the tube. And now, because of that, poor Molly's birthday is ruined."
John snorted again, shook his head fondly. Sherlock looked utterly pleased with himself, his smile genuine, his face creased with mirth. The red lip print on his cheek stood out in sharp relief against his skin.
"Sherlock," John said, and stopped. His mouth worked silently, and then he nodded, squared his shoulders. Bracing himself for something unpleasant. "I—there are a lot of things I should say to you. I don't. I don't entirely know where to begin, but I—I thought I'd start with 'thank you.' For saving my life. For coming after me. I don't think anyone would have blamed you if you hadn't, and—
John did not bring much with him. Even so, the room filled quickly. He'd squeezed Rosie's cot into the space next to his bed, under the window. He stacked her things in his wardrobe, his own clothes pushed haphazardly to the side.
Sherlock went to her instinctively, then hesitated. She went on screaming as if she hadn't seen him at all.
a serial killer, and he might not take kindly to having his plans interrupted. So. Keep an eye out."
John nodded, turned and left the consultation room. He walked past the glass case with its myriad confections, headed for the front door. Drew up short just as Sherlock was backed roughly into the plate glass window at the front of the store, his suit jacket crumpling, his arse flattening up against the glass.
and he hesitated, breathed out hard through his nose. "When we caught up to you, when I saw you again, I was so—I just wanted—"
He cannot quite keep himself from scoffing. "And have the students and faculty changed their behaviour in line with this new—superstition?"
How long, he wondered, how long had Sherlock been covering this up? How long had he carried on, blissfully unaware?
Sherlock, on the pavement with a split lip and blood oozing from his nose, the way his eyes had tracked John and Mary as they'd climbed into the taxi.
John shakes his head. "Yeah, no, it's—sorry. Sorry. I'll just—I'll keep him at mine. For a while. Until I find someone who can take him in. I don't know what I was—"
Sherlock shifted in his seat, arranging himself against the driver's side door so he could face the back. "That he's dead. That you served together. Two addresses for a surviving brother; one in Chelmsford, one in Cumbria. Lestrade took the Chelmsford flat. I—"
"And if—" John said, stopped. He looked at Sherlock, there with Rosie on one hip, Janine at his side. A proper family. "If it does? Take long?"
Deciding it would make things worse to acknowledge it, Sherlock walked calmly into the bathroom, shut the door behind him.
Molly pushed through the doorway into the sitting room, her face pale and pinched with sorrow, and Sherlock knew without her needing to say a word.
John sets his empty glass down. He is not drunk, but his tongue feels looser. He does not want to sit silently any longer.
Sherlock swallows, watches a bead of water drip from John's earlobe and trace a slow, winding pattern down his neck.
The dance lessons. The lessons Sherlock had agreed to, even though they had nothing directly to do with the case. The ones he'd agreed to simply because Janine had asked, because she'd wanted to learn.
John's chest had gone cold. He opened his mouth to call him back. Could not seem to force the words past his lips.
"I—" John said, and stopped. He had no idea what to say. One of his hands had strayed close to Sherlock's and he tapped their fingers together, stopping just shy of taking his hand.
"Oh, right, of course." John shook his head, looked back at Sherlock. "Well. What I was trying to say is that—"
There would be clues, of course. John was easy to read in that regard—Sherlock had never had difficulty spotting a bad night's sleep on him.
John pauses by the glass, looks in. The tank with its looming sculptures and jagged rocks and dispassionate residents seems somehow more imposing, here.
Military man, invalided home from a long deployment. Clear disapproval of his sister's lifestyle. Said disapproval presumably not related to her sexuality, as she'd mentioned (more than once) his friendship with and fondness towards her ex-wife. The drinking, most likely. Perhaps the divorce as well.
There was no room for finesse. John dropped his head, buried his face in Sherlock's neck, chasing the feeling. He brought his hand between them and Sherlock gasped, bucking up against him, and just like that it was over, too soon, a shocking hot rush of sensation that left him shaking.
"Mm," Sherlock said, distracted. He slid over on the couch to give John more room. The loss John's warm comfortable weight against his side was jarring.
He clenched his fist, breathed out, looked up at the ceiling. Waited for his thundering heart to calm.
Mary had tried to get him to talk, that night. And the night after, and the night after that. He'd refused, stiff-shouldered and silent. He'd shaved his moustache. He'd spent days jumping at shadows, thinking he saw Sherlock on every street corner, in every crowd.
John looked back and forth between them. He had the strange, sinking sensation that they were having some other, deeper conversation just below the surface.
John snapped his eyes open, stiff and bewildered and overwarm. He had, for just a moment, been on the sofa at Baker Street. There had been a fire crackling merrily in the fireplace. Sherlock had been at his side, close enough that their knees bumped. John had been smiling. Sherlock had been smiling too, catching his lower lip in his teeth the way he did sometimes when he was exceptionally pleased.
When he was relaxed and happy, John often hummed while he washed dishes. He was quiet this morning. His movements had a short, mechanical quality to them. Plates clattered against the countertop, set down sharply. Not slammed. Not angry, then. Distracted. Mind elsewhere.
anymore, it all stopped. I was empty without it, without something to drive me. When you weren't there anymore, I was—um—I was a lot of things." He steels his face, looks off at the horizon. "Sad. Confused. Guilty. Angry, too, yeah. But the effect you'd had on me it—it didn't just disappear when you were gone. So I was able to keep going. Find work, eventually. And then I met Mary, and—"
"I didn't intend for it to be here. I'd wanted—" he catches sight of Sherlock's face in the shifting shadows and falters briefly. "I'd planned to go to Grimpen Village. Stay at the Cross Keys."
The idea was almost too absurd to consider. He was clearly in the grip of some kind of psychological—episode—and he needed to do something about it. He'd thought the worst of it had passed when he'd finally let Mary go; obviously he'd been mistaken.
"Please. Anyone with half a brain could see the pattern. You've been robbing chemists across London for weeks now. Working east to west. Always shops with late night hours, low foot traffic. Easy to guess where you'd strike next."
"I wasn't—" he stopped at the dubious expression on her face. "It's not about me," he said instead, sharp. "Not anymore. It can't be."
Sherlock smiled at her, because she was kind, and if he'd learned nothing else it was that kindness should not be met with derision. And he shook his head, because what she wanted for him was impossible.
"Yes, and he approached you after you delivered your message to Lady Smallwood," Mycroft said. "We've pieced together his movements, although he remains at the moment—elusive."
The sight twisted something in his chest, and he turned away, his gaze falling on a street musician standing at the edge of the kerb. The man was dressed far too lightly for the weather. His hair was cropped short, though he had the unkempt beginnings of a beard. The violin he clutched in his ungloved hands was beautiful.
The man in front of him was tall. He was wearing a long coat, something wool and well-cut and clearly expensive. John spent a moment admiring the lines of it, the way the collar fell. It was a nice coat. John was too short to pull off a coat like that, he thought, but it didn't mean he couldn't appreciate it.
"I sent texts. We have a case," Sherlock said. His voice was tentative, questioning. Whatever he'd seen on John's face had discomfited him. "Mrs Hudson said she'd be happy to take Watson for a few hours."
He'd got her involved in this. A coworker. A woman he barely knew. He'd called her and put her right in the middle of something dangerous. She'd walked into his flat looking for him out of
There is a thrill of satisfaction, a familiar electric rush humming through his veins that comes with being
Sherlock, the great idiot, actually managed to look bored. He raised his brows, favoured Pete with the kind of condescending look that John thought might well get him shot. "Oh?"
"Perhaps," Sherlock says. He steps closer, stares down at John, his pale eyes alight with curiosity.
"Right," John said, and looked down at the ground. He breathed through his nose for a moment, then lifted his head, met Sherlock's gaze. There was something strange in Sherlock's expression, something fleeting and uncomfortable. "So you're telling me that the video showed exactly what the police report said it did."
Moriarty is grinning, even in death. It is a mad grin, made all the more unsettling by the empty black eyes. A dark, wet crown has pooled around his shattered head.
She was slight of frame, unassuming. Her grey hair was tucked behind her ears. He thought that perhaps James Bond had got it wrong after all, spies should never stand out in a room, should never draw the eye. No wonder Sherlock had been captured.
"She'll be back again tomorrow. For breakfast, she said." John smiled a bit, took a step into the room. "I think that means it's your turn."
She patted him on the arm, turned away. He listened to her footsteps as she left the flat, carefully descended the stairs. Then he returned his attention to the fridge.
Sherlock moved to his own chair, sat gingerly. His chest clenched and burned. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck.
He was loath to step away from that strange but welcome warmth, but he did, letting John's hand fall away from his coat sleeve. He had come for a reason.
Sherlock had not needed to try very hard to talk him into going along. There had been the promise of a lavish hotel room, free meals, and a great deal of sex. That had been more than enough.
John laughs, glances away. He does not quite seem able to meet Sherlock's eyes. "Erm, just—med students can get a bit weird, yeah? I think it's all the, erm, stress. Just—" his voice breaks and he coughs. "Just take my word for it."
"Really, though," John said, and suddenly he wasn't laughing any more. He fidgeted in his chair, looked down at his hands. "I'd like to. Really, I would. But."
"She rode horses," John said. Anger had started to creep in. All of that grief. All of that terrible, weighty, unnecessary grief. "And her new husband didn't. I'll bet you didn't even intend to kill him. Any loud noise would have done it, yeah? Startle the horses—she keeps her seat and her husband ends up on his back in the mud. A nice dose of humiliation for someone you thought needed to be taken down a peg, yeah?"
There is an unexpected pressure behind his eyes, a rush of heat to his face. His breath, when he draws it in, is shaky and wet.
Mycroft had composed himself. There was no trace of the perplexed panic that had gripped him at Sherrinford, none of that uncomfortable wildness in his eyes. He’d changed his clothes. A fresh suit, well-pressed, no creases.
His shoes whispered across a threadbare carpet. Down the hall, past staff bathrooms and a small locker room. It was quiet, the sounds of merriment distant and indistinct.
The grass had been trampled, both by the murderer and victim and—irritatingly—the police officers first arriving on the scene.
The air left his lungs as if he'd been punched. He sagged, reached out and braced himself against the fridge.
Sherlock took another sip of water. Watched from the corner of his eye as John righted himself and approached the mantel, the slanting sunlight catching briefly on his silver hair, making it gleam golden. He looked younger in warm light.
It had been so very quiet, so still. He'd scarcely dared to breathe, lest he shatter the unexpected peace of the moment. Sherlock's head was tipped back against the couch cushions, his mouth partly open, his breaths deep, even. The stress and pain and sorrow of the last year and a half had seemed to melt off of his face in sleep, leaving him looking unguarded and heartbreakingly young.
John smiles tightly. He brings up his hand to rub at the back of his neck, an uncomfortable gesture. He's nervous. Mentioning his daughter puts him ill at ease. There is something weighing on him.
It was a great shaggy beast she called Trevor, and it had never quite warmed to John. It did not seem to matter how often he smiled at it, how many times he held out his hand and said "here, boy," or even offered it bits of crumbly treats that left his fingers smelling uncomfortably meaty even after he washed his hands. The dog would watch him with wary dark eyes, its hackles raised, a low growl rumbling in the back of its throat.
"I mean—" John paused, let out a miserable little laugh. "It won't help you right now. But. When we get out of here, you could always—I mean. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to hear from you. Right now he's probably thinking about how he missed his chance, and—"
Outside, in the sitting room, he could make out the low murmur of voices, the quiet drone of the telly. Lestrade and Molly, settling in for the evening.
The tall grass had wound around his ankles, damp cold tendrils. The creak of old wood underfoot. Cold air below. The gunshot crack-snap as the wood gave way.
John takes pity on him. "Come here," he says, and tangles his fingers up in the lapels of Sherlock's suit jacket, tugs him forward, brings their mouths together. It is slow, this kiss, soft and warm and tender in all the ways he has always wanted to be with Sherlock but never quite dared.
The morning sun painted the front of the cottage in pale gold. The warm light belied the chill in the air. The wind was bracing, and carried a hint of salt.
Sherlock cannot bear that concern, not now, not after the night they've had and the terrible days yet to come. He is irritated that he's got lost inside his head, that he's allowed John to see how rattled he is.
"You know, I've got something of a knack for codes," Mary said. She held out her hand, raised her brows.
Mycroft opened his mouth. Whatever he’d intended to say died on his lips as he took in Sherlock’s countenance, and he shut his mouth again, stepped aside.
John laughed, scratched at the back of his neck. "I see all of your extensive research didn't extend to the wedding night."
He took a step forward and this time John met him halfway, unhesitating, his arms coming up to wrap around Sherlock's waist, to pull him close against John's compact, sturdy frame. He was warm. Their mouths brushed clumsily against one another, noses bumping, before Sherlock tilted his head and—oh—that was why people did this—
He withdrew it, looked at it curiously. There was a crack in the plastic. Could have been an accident, but—the crease down the middle, the stress lines—it looked as though someone had held it in their hands and tried to break it, had given up before succeeding.
Sherlock rolls his forehead against John's. He is breathing hard, heart thudding in his chest. Surely John must feel it where his fingers are tangled tight in the front of Sherlock's shirt.
John's chest went cold. He flinched, forced himself not to look away from Sherlock's inquisitive gaze. "Mm?"
Sherlock looked away from the fire. The room had gone dark and still around him. The guests were gone. He had not heard them leave.
John went to the sofa, scooped Rosie up into his arms. She went willingly this time, buried her head against his neck as he carried her into the tiny kitchen. He set her in her highchair, went to turn on the kettle. Behind him, he heard the scrape of chair legs against the lino as Molly took a seat.
John shut his eyes, thought about Evan Bell, the way he'd been when he was still alive. Young and wide-eyed and terribly naive. It was not hard to imagine him growing up here, in this place.
He'd left and John had not followed. John had not called. John had not written. John had vanished from his life like a ghost.
He laughed, at that, the sound hollow and unamused. He pulled his gaze away from the screen, looked up at the ceiling. The room had grown dark around him, Rosie long since put to bed.
"He's the same. Always telling me what to do. But I'm fine. He's the one living in a bedsit," she says.
And then John had clawed the phone out of his hand, and was shouting angrily and Sherlock could not make out the words because everything had gone quite fuzzy and loud but he thought John might be agreeing with him and that was nice, that was good, and maybe he could just—
Harry needs very little urging to behave rudely towards him. She seems to derive great joy from it. Likely out of solidarity over the matter of Abominable Brothers.
"Ah—" John held up both hands, as if such a simple gesture could ever keep him at bay. "Doesn't this go against the whole—well, the whole spirit of the thing? Switching partners? I thought I was meant to dance with someone I've never danced with before."
Individual moments stood out with stark clarity. Glimpsing Mary in her dress for the first time, that lovely cascade of vintage lace. He did not remember what his meal had tasted like, or if he'd had white wine or red, but he'd never forget Sherlock's odd, heartfelt speech, and the rush of emotion that had had him stumbling to his feet to pull his friend into a hug. Dancing with Mary for the first time, her face radiant in flickering candlelight, carefully tracing the steps that Sherlock had taught him.
John staggered back like he'd been punched, his head thudding hard against the refrigerator door. Sherlock's lips were harsh and insistent against his own. There was no trace of the morning's hesitance.
At the front of the room, his back to the crowd and fiddling with a speaker and phone setup, was the man Janine had collided with outside of the bakery. Pete, she'd called him. He was fit, John supposed. Dark hair. Decent arse, not that he was looking too closely. A dancer's physique, slim but well-muscled.
He bent to resettle Rosie into her pushchair. Sat down in one of the comfortable waiting room chairs, looked up at the clock on the wall. Watched the minutes tick by.
He needed to—he needed to get out of the water. Before his limbs quit functioning entirely. Based on the weak struggle his legs were making against the current, he estimated less than ten minutes before that happened.
He winced, pinched at his nose again, sniffed. Already, there was a tickle building in the back of his throat, a maddening irritation just out of reach. His mouth had gone dry.
She laughed again, and this time it was almost genuine, as if he'd startled it out of her. "Oh, I can see why he likes you. He does so enjoy a bit of a verbal spar."
"Maybe you can spare some time tomorrow morning to tell me what I should be looking for at the ceremony," John said to Sherlock. A startling wave of anger had begun to build in his chest. His blood roared in his ears. "Since you've been too distracted by—by all of this—to discuss any kind of proper strategy."
"You can't do things like that. And you shouldn't have left your appointment. You need to talk to someone, John, it's important."
He stopped scrolling. Pete's face smiled up at him, the tiny photo terribly familiar from how long it had spent in his friend request notifications.
She dropped her half-empty bottle onto the tray of her highchair. It rolled and then stopped before reaching the edge, trailing a thin dribble of milk. She squealed, reached for it, pulled it back towards her mouth. Gummed at the nipple.
He disconnected the call, stood holding his phone pressed against his ear. He breathed out, hard. His breath was shaky.
John rocked forward in his chair, his eyes stinging, his chest tight. Only Sherlock, he thought. Only Sherlock could just go and
you want a salad because you've stopped cycling to work and you're worried—correctly—about putting on weight, but—"
John sighs, and there is a tired laugh caught somewhere in that sigh. He looks at the plate in his hand, seems to realise it no longer needs washing. He turns off the tap.
In three days, it would be a year since he'd walked out of Baker Street for the last time. Since he'd fled from the oppressive air, choking on all of the things he couldn't say.
"Should I—um—" Sherlock hesitated, looked around the room. His brain had not come back online and he felt sluggish, helpless.
"Considering you accused one the last time we dealt with this," John said, folding his arms over his chest. "I'd say no. Not obvious."
"Well, perhaps you can try their mobile." The woman lifted her brows at him, clearly expecting him to move along.
("He owes me a favour," Sherlock had said. "I once helped him track down a particularly clever thief.")
The very thought of it exhausted him. He could not quite imagine dragging Rosie along to shop for a new sofa. Well. He
"Of course it is," John said. He did not let go of Sherlock's arm. "It's your head he wants, yeah? It's what he's wanted from the start."
It was difficult to creep up on John. He was an army veteran with hair-trigger reflexes. Even with the telly turned up (he wouldn't have had it turned up, not with a sleeping child in the flat), John should have been aware that he was not alone in the flat.
He'd dressed for the occasion—crisp shirt, neatly pressed suit. His scarf was carefully wound around his neck, shielded by his turned up coat collar. For John to allow him anywhere near this case of his, it was imperative that he see the impeccable consulting detective and not the wounded former friend.
"I'm so sorry—" Molly was saying, and Mrs Hudson was rushing to the rescue with towels, and Rosie had thrown her head back and had started to
Sherlock stumbled against him, stiff and unyielding, his heart rabbit-quick against his chest under that thin t-shirt. He was warm. He smelled good. Familiar.
"Yes," Sherlock agrees. He is still holding John's face in his hands. His thumbs smooth gentle circles on John's cheeks.
He thought about the empty waiting room, the tense look on Sarah's face when he'd arrived. The way she'd rushed through their conversation. He felt a sick wave of guilt.
They stared at each other for a moment. John held out his hand. Sherlock took it, and John pulled him to his feet.
Sherlock lifted his hands, set them tentatively on John's shoulders, a light pressure, as if uncertain of their welcome, as if he might need to snatch them away.
"She's spent years with no outlet, with nothing except the few puzzles you dangled in front of her. Of course she created games. Of course she struggled with—with empathy."
"Sorry," he said. He pressed his lips together, continued walking. "Just—something just occurred to me."
He decides he would quite like to crack open the bottle. That much he can do. He does not think he can manage the rest of it.
ways), he has always taken care to help Sherlock navigate uncomfortable social situations, he must be choosing to show Sherlock, in no uncertain terms, that there is no longer any need for concern. The right choices have been made, vows have been upheld, there will be no returning (alone) to Baker Street to wonder about the troubling disconnect between words and thoughts and actions.
"No," John says. "Just—she was in a bad place, when you met her. And there are—um. There are a million people out there who might have—taken advantage of that. You didn't. You gave her a place to live, and—" He stops, looks down at the ground.
He laughed, the sound a little high, a little desperate. "I told you, I was rubbish at it. Kept calling the bridesmaids' dresses purple when they were supposed to be—I don't know—lilac or lavender or whatever it was called. Made me feel a bit like I was losing my mind, to be honest."
Well. It didn't matter what John would or would not have done. What mattered was that Lestrade was no longer standing behind him.
He wasn't sure how long he'd languished in Sherlock's room. More than one night, certainly. He had faint, hazy memories of Sherlock sitting by his bedside, of lukewarm tea sipped through a straw, of soup and even a wedge of orange, cool and sweet over his parched tongue.
Sherlock watches the woman watching John. She smiles at Rosie (good). Her eyes flick towards his left hand (newly bare of his wedding ring, a promising sign). She touches her own face, brushing at an imaginary strand of hair (common flirtation technique).
Sometimes he missed the chaos of Baker Street. The traffic noise outside his bedroom window, coaxing him awake as the sun peeked over the horizon. The stream of unexpected visitors and the muffled throb of Mrs Hudson's downright bizarre taste in music. Explosions and shouting and screeching tempered by the sweetest sounds coaxed from the strings of Sherlock's violin.
She moved to the gurney at the sound of a scuffle immediately outside the morgue doors. There was a slide and a thump that could only be someone hitting the ground. She wondered how many people John had fought past just to make it this far.
He stares at the words. It feels good, seeing them written out like that. It reminds him that he has not written a word on his blog since—since what happened. He should. He should set the record straight. There were, perhaps, people out there who had taken his silence as an admission of guilt.
He'd need to seek employment eventually, if only to keep from going mad with boredom, but he could find something part-time or even return to locum work. That had worked out well, back when he'd still lived with Sherlock. And living with an infant was not so different, really, when it came down to it.
John smiles tightly, looks up at the sky. There are a lot of things he could say, and none of them would make this any more bearable.
He'd looked at the frozen corpse, and he'd thought of John and the way that John would catch his eye sometimes, the way his mouth would fall open and his eyes would narrow, the way he'd occasionally look as though he were taking a deep breath and gearing up to say something monumental. Something that never actually made it past his lips.
Sherlock turned around. Behind him, the rain went on droning against the window glass. "Well," he said. He clapped his hands together, gunshot loud. "That's that, then. Was there anything else?"
Sherlock looked down. He moved slowly, as if confused. He touched the hem of the shirt he wore, rubbed it between his fingers. "Lestrade."
Two hours later, John took off his white coat and hung it on the hook behind his office door. He made his way slowly over to his desk, his leg stiff and his hand cramping.
Yes. Sherlock was lots of things. But the brilliance came first. And that, John could admit to himself, and only to himself, his face burning and his stomach crawling with shame, was the one area where he was entirely out of his depth.
What would happen after that—well. There was simply no way to know for sure. But Sherlock could certainly imagine several likely scenarios. He did not care for any of them.
John whirled around, his face contorted. "A few moments. You want to tell the vicar—Sherlock, what the
Sherlock stands for a moment, twisting his hands in front of him. Something heavy has settled in the pit of his stomach. He cannot recall the last time he felt so helpless, so adrift, so utterly at sea.
Sherlock was next to him, still in his coat. He sat at the edge of the bench, staring out over the water.
Sherlock blinked. The room felt at once much too cold and far too warm. His hands trembled. John seemed upset at having spoken, but his words were—good.
"Welcome, family and friends," Wiggins said, his voice flat, clearly reading from the sheet of paper in his hand. "We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Sherlock and Janine. You have joined us to share in their formal commitment so that Sherlock and Janine may begin their married life together surrounded by the people nearest and dearest to them. Now for the vows, do you Sherlock—"
"Does, uh—" Pete paused, ducked his head so that they were eye-to-eye. He smiled, bit his lip. "Does everyone also mention that you're quite fit? In person?"
He thought this might be the part where he was expected to say something charming in return. He found himself tongue tied.
John laughs again, tips his head back, looks at the ceiling. "I'll be more uncomfortable if I don't sleep."
"I'm only now realising how much effort he must have put into it," John said, heat climbing up the back of his neck. He felt oddly defensive. "It's not easy, you know. All of this."
Well. He hadn't really got a chance to tie up loose ends, had he? He'd been in hospital, recovering from a gunshot wound when his little web of lies had unravelled. And things had been— things had been chaotic in the immediate aftermath. Perhaps now, with the dust settled and life back to some degree of normalcy—
"Sorry if I—" John stopped, looked down at his hand, his fist clenched around the tattered napkin. "I didn't know if—"
He went back into the sitting room, cleared his throat. When no one responded, he clapped his hands together.
John, passing afternoons at 221B while Rosie was with the sitter. Sometimes there were clients and crime scenes and gleeful sprints through back alleys. Sometimes they just drank tea and John watched telly while Sherlock solved cases on Twitter. It was nice. It was normal.
"Are you all right?" she asked, finally. There was a sort of forced politeness to the question, an impatience that she could not quite conceal.
John cleared his throat, looked at the wall, the ceiling, anywhere but at Sherlock's face. He wanted to reach out, to take Sherlock's cold hands in his own, rub them until they were warm.
"Look, I'll—fine. I'll do it. When I get home." John clenched his hand again, scowled. Looked up at the ceiling. "Which I should be doing. Now. We've had a long trip. Rosie's tired."
"Of course I'm unhappy," John says. He smiles, an unpleasant twist of his mouth. "Anyone would be, yeah? I have everything I want within my grasp and I—I can't keep it."
"The entire staff has been relieved of duty, of course. Temporary replacements have been installed. This will—well. As I’m sure you can imagine, this entire matter will take some time to sort.“ He sniffed, looked down at his hands. "But preliminary efforts have been made to put the pieces together. So to speak.”
"No," Sherlock said, reaching out to pluck the torch from Lestrade's hand. He aimed the beam up at the darkened windows overhead, illuminating an open window. A wispy curtain fluttered in the light breeze.
at this) Christmas had not warranted cheesy photos and saccharine smiles and cheap plastic baubles commending BABY'S FIRST CHRISTMAS.
"And it seemed like she might need a bit of prompting to get on with what she really wanted to do, which was ask you to dinner."
"Sorry," Sherlock said again. He cleared his throat, wished he could clear his head. "Wasn't quite what I'd planned."
Sherlock shut his eyes, sucked in a shuddering breath. "I find the thought occupies a terrifying amount of my mind."
"Please," Lazarus said, and that mildly amused tone had dropped out of his voice entirely. He sounded tired, hoarse, a bit frightened.
In the top drawer he found it, folded up in a plastic evidence bag. The phone was heavy, sleek, a brand he'd never heard of. It looked expensive, the kind of thing that the overly rich bought up because they had nothing better to spend their money on.
John glanced up from the menus, made a shooing motion with his hand. Ah. It appeared that he'd committed to watching a film or—he paused, looked at the screen—a television series.
Greg reached out to clap him on the shoulder, a hearty well-meaning thump. There was a half-empty pint glass in his hand, clearly not his first of the night. He was flushed in the face and a little glassy-eyed. It had been a long time since John had seen him so cheerful. Well. It had been a long time since John had seen him at all, really.
John thinks again of Robert Walsingham in his rumpled tuxedo, of the misplaced bride with her plaintive eyes and stumbling apologies. Of her lover, standing just beside the door, chin high, unashamed.
Sherlock looks away. It is seared in his mind, the expression on John's face that night. He will never be able to delete it, no matter how hard he tries.
The morning air was chilly but the sky was clear, promising a lovely spring day. Speedy's was crowded, with several patrons taking advantage of the outdoor tables.
Bell fidgeted with his coat, crumpling the heavy fabric in his fists. "This all—things fell apart, here. I couldn't do it on my own."
and John would know immediately if Sherlock had got into the cocaine. And Sherlock did not have to be a genius to know that, if that happened, John would not come back again.
"Mm," Mary says, her voice noncommittal. He is not fooling her with his deflection, and he knows it.
