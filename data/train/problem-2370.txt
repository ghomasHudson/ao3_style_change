More trouble.  Castiel tapped the arm of chair, mind moving.  It would be wise to bring Balthazar in.  As flirty and obnoxious as the man was, Castiel was certain he wouldn’t report the two of them.  He didn’t think.  If he could phrase it properly, he might be able to gauge the man’s charity.
Dean also learned that Castiel had had two prior subs:  One, a man named Samandriel who lived with his Dom in New York and the other a woman named Hiel who’d decided to leave the D/s world behind and made a living as a photographer in Europe.
Dean blinked and sipped from his coffee as the elevator opened on the first floor.  Striding out, he mused, “You really
Ya'll are in for a treat; double-update!  The Ao3 version is now in time with the Tumblr version.  Needless to say, porn happens in the final bit.  :3
hm?”  He tugged on his briefs, letting the head of his dick peek through.  “I mean, I was willing to help.”
He considered balling up the card and tossing it out the car window as he drove away.  It burned behind his pocket.  Such a tiny thing.  Probably better to be rid of it.  He’d forget anyway.  Dumb idea.  Like the guy meant it.
writing but he couldn’t bring himself to say it.  It all boiled down to embarrassment of a different sort, however.  He wasn’t ashamed for the erotica he wrote; just that . . . well, he himself was nothing special.  Just someone with fantastic luck in the publishing world.
Surprising.  Given Castiel’s looks, Dean thought for sure he’d gone through more than the two subs he had.  To have that much of a dry spell?  He couldn’t figure that out.  “Why?” he asked.
“Do ya now?”  Dean grinned, eyes narrowing almost playfully and took another sip.  “Pretty big fan of it myself.  Maybe next time I’ll bring a fifth over and we can catch a game on the tv.”
Grumbling, Dean stood up, removing his mic and setting it on the desk.  He stopped when someone cleared their throat.
It shouldn’t have amused Dean so much to watch the guy fumble like a physical comedian but it was endearing in its own way.  Poor guy was awkward as hell when email barriers were removed, it looked like.  He could get used to that.  Shaking his head at himself, Dean grinned outwardly.  “You okay there, Gabe?”
Castiel shucked off his apron, slapping the garment down on his counter.  He didn’t have any day workers on Wednesdays and given this was his store, he was fully in his rights to close up suddenly.  He scribbled a hasty note and plastered it to the front door.
Mindful of Castiel’s perch on his ass, Dean tried not to squirm from the compliment.  He swallowed and turned his head, eyeing Castiel as the man continued to press his hands into Dean’s bare back.  “You do that a lot,” he mumbled.
“Y-you . . . kissed me,” Castiel rasped.  “With your mouth.”  He didn’t quite meet Dean’s eyes, staring at a spot somewhat to the left of his head, instead.  “You . . . aren’t supposed to do that,” he added, sounding genuinely confused.
Castiel smiled that same enigmatic smile that had snared Dean so quickly.  “I know.  You aren’t the kind of man who would dream of making such a demand.  And you aren’t.  This isn’t you coercing something from me, Dean.”  He touched Dean’s chin with careful fingers.  “This is me . . . making a choice.  One I should have made many years ago.  I’m only sorry you had to bear the brunt of my conflict.”
“Oh?”  Dean turned around, one book in his hand.  He reached out and tugged on Castiel’s hoodie, commenting, “strings were crooked” as he did.  Strangely, Dean wouldn’t meet his eyes and his cheeks seemed brighter than when he’d first walked in.
Dean chuckled.  ”It’s no big deal.  Just a bit of water and dirt.”  He shrugged, feeling his shirt stick to him.  Damn, hell of a way to meet his crush.  Given how stupid he felt at the moment, probably a good time to put that to rest.
superiors are unaware of the action.”  He snorted.  ”In fact, it’s your assistant director who’s been helping me.”
kissedhim.  Not accidentally knocked into him.  Or tripped.  Or had a seizure.  An honest-to-God kiss.  Maybe it was nothing more than a peck on the cheek, but far more intimate than he’d expected.  And then there’d been Dean himself.  As though he’d walked out of Castiel’s personal wet dream.  He’d been dressed in clothing even tighter than the day before, sleeves rolled up, collar unbuttoned.  Criminal.
“Careful,” he cooed.  “I don’t know the Heimlich Maneuver.”  He took a sip of iced tea, smirk broadening at Castiel’s glare.
Frowning, Dean fidgeted.  He’d been nice, if stuttery, all the times they’d met.  He certainly hadn’t come off as rude or arrogant.  Reserved for certain.  Wary, even.  Still, this was all a bit troubling.  “He must not like me much if he lied.”
“Oh, hardly.  I’m just amused at you.”  He perched on the chair Bobby had used, smirking.  “To be perfectly honest, I’m surprised you aren’t
So, really, it was Fate’s idea of torment that Sam and Castiel became close working friends and thus,
Sam still carried his concerned look.  “Before you broke up with him, I was going to ask you if . . . well, if he’d done anything to you.  You’d always go so quiet when he was around.  It wasn’t like you.”  He sat back.  “Like I said, I’m glad you’re away from him but you still don’t seem . . . happy.  I just . . . I want you to be happy, Dean.”
“I wanted to run,” he admitted.  “Almost hailed a cab, actually.”  He toyed with his cup, glancing once at Castiel.  “Didn’t think it fair, though.  I mean … you’re really the only one I trust, Cas.”  He set his cup down and dug in his jacket, pulling out an envelope.  “You might not believe me, but this isn’t what I wanted to do with my life.”  He held out the item to Castiel.  “It was just an easy way to get what I needed.”
The younger of the two sighed in disappointment.  “Kind of my thought, too,” she admitted, as she collected her change.  “He didn’t really give me a second look.  He’s really sweet, though.  Helped me with a flat tire at no charge.”  She tugged her canvas grocery tote over one shoulder.  “Seems real sad, too.  Hope he likes it here.”
Dean enjoyed his job.  He might be nothing more than a talking head but it was decent hours and damn good pay.  Besides, fluff pieces about local pet shows or stupid shit like why a grocery store might change its colors made for entertainment in some fashion.  And really, his co-hosts were like family at this stage.  Or too much like family, to be frank.
To his surprise, Dean glared, his fingers white on the plastic fork.  ”Not what that’s about,” he snapped.  His brow furrowed and he jabbed at his meal.  ”Not even close,” he added.
Castiel chuckled and stood, collecting their plates and frowning at Dean when the other man attempted to help.  He shook his head.  “You’re my guest.  Sit.”  Taking the plates to the kitchen, he ran them under the taps to let them soak.  Bending over the oven, he pulled out the pie and like the lasagna, carved out two large, messy slices.  At the last moment, he added a scoop of ice cream from the half empty carton in his freezer and returned to the table.
Dean laughed, pleased to see those plush lips quirk up in a familiar way.  “That’s right, Cas; talk nerdy to me.”
Bhahahaa!  Anyway, Cas writes gay porn, Dean is in lust/love with his persona and Balthazar is there to make everyone regret everything.  :D
He pushed open the door to his hotel room, immediately noting the broken seal on the mini-bar, the tiny bottles of liquor lined up neatly on the table above.  He sighed in irritation, stomping over. The note was hardly a surprise.
never died down.  And try as he might, he’d still flirt with Castiel.  Still tease and maybe stand too close.  Find excuses to touch.  It hurt though, after a while.  To know that
His phone rang and he snagged it, half-worried with would be Gabe calling to cancel.  He never did understand James Bartlett’s need for privacy.  Well, on the surface he did.  But to refuse interviews like they were plague-covered cesspools?  Made zero sense to him.  But hey, he’d managed the impossible in having the guy at his bookstore so shit; he was a damn hero in the erotica community at the moment.
had been answered.  If anything, they’d only birthed more questions.  After all, what kind of man retires to a no-name town and wards a cabin against the supernatural?
The other man led him to a small office and as soon as he walked in, Castiel closed the door and locked it.  He paced to the other side of the desk, smiling warmly.  “No interruptions, I feel,” he murmured.  He sat down, gesturing for Dean to do the same.  “I had . . . well,
Frowning, Dean jerked his head.  “The words.  Like, ‘pretty,’ or ‘lovely.’”  He felt a blush burn down his cheeks and along his neck.  Men weren’t
like me.  I’m . . . I’m a fraud.  I’m not . . . who you want.”  He took a shaky gulp of air and moved toward the front of the store.
“I, uh, was looking for a place that was off the beaten path.  Just . . . away from all the shit and noise and . . . actually, I kind of threw a dart at a map.”  He shrugged, looking a bit embarrassed as he did.  “I like it here, though.  It’s really quiet.  People are friendly but not nosy.  And, Portland and Salem are close by if I ever feel like I’m missing anything.”
Castiel squats down beside Dean, and to Dean’s relief, he’s chuckling and his blue eyes are as warm as they’ve ever been.  "You are exceptionally blind at times, for a detective."  He presses a lingering kiss to Dean's cheek.  "Get some rest and we'll see just
relationship; right?”  Fucking words.  They were so damn hard to spit out.  He could swear at anyone and shoot back retorts like they were nothing but here?  Here he felt like he’d only known English a short while.  Couldn’t grasp a damn thing.
As though sensing him, Commuter Angel’s head came up and swiveled toward Dean.  He blinked, staring at Dean.  In shock?  In delight?  Dean couldn’t really say; honestly, it looked like Commuter Angel’s brain had switched to offline mode given how still he’d gone.
The older man choked on his coffee, sputtering.  “I . . . what?”  He scowled at Castiel and set his mug down, muttering at the splashes of coffee on his jeans.  “Care to explain?”
Back at the hotel, Dean was noticeably quiet, his gaze flickering to Castiel and then away.  For his part, Castiel completely ignored the man, shoveling in ice cold Pad Thai and then taking a quick, too-hot shower.  By the time he was done, Dean was on the floor, having stolen some blankets and a pillow from Castiel’s bed.  He considered yelling at him for it but the man looked …
He dragged his fingernails down his thigh, feeling the denim snag at the bitten ends.  He shifted again, wanted to press his hand against his growing dick and knowing it the
Dean.  If it managed to get back to Bobby that he was aiding a known criminal to commit crimes, his job would be gone.  Hell, he’d probably be gone.
Well, that was a dumb thing to remember.  And the same cloud that had appeared when he’d woken, resettled around his bedhead.
The other man let the spoon fall into the bowl and looked at his right hand.  ”I am not what I was.  I don’t have the abilities I did.  I cannot heal.  I cannot fly.  I can fight.  I can research.  But I am … not much more than that.”
He’d been after Dean ever since, always at least two steps behind.  It rankled him to no end.  And now the asshole had mocked him on camera.
He . . . he couldn’t!  The nightmarish stories.  He’d heard . . . of towns wiped out because of these two men.  Death and blood that followed in their wake.  Of a world on edge and somehow pulled back from the brink.  Rumors of angels and demons.  Of Heaven and Hell.  Even tiny, tiny Grovelock had not managed to miss those stories.
He yelped when Bobby swatted him in the back of the head.  “Ya don’t need to bring him by the meet the folks but stop acting like you ain’t got a man you’re runnin’ with.”  Gruff as he was, Bobby was smiling.  “Ya been walking around here like you’re on cloud nine lately.  Don’t take much smarts to figure out
"I’m fine.  I swear," he mumbled.  Idiot.  That’s what Michael would have said, in that sneering voice of his.
"I had heard rumors you were quite familiar with him."  Again the smirk.  "Been after him a while, hm?"
He waited a full five minutes before peeking around the edge.  Two men stood at the end of the hall, their backs to Castiel.  One carried a semi-automatic in his hands, strap tight around his shoulders.  He waved at Benny, holding up two fingers.
He nearly rear-ended the Impala in the dark, screeching to a stop on gravel.  He shoved open the door, just as Dean walked out of the cabin, duffel bag in hand.  The rain drummed down heavy and fast and Castiel had to squint through the sluicing water.  “Dean!”
It seemed it would take time for Dean to understand.  Or perhaps action.  He leaned in, kissing Dean’s jaw, feeling tendon jump under his lips.  “I told you.  Stay here.  With me.”  Another kiss, a faint dart of his tongue against stubble.  “I would have no other.”
“Dean,” he began in exasperation.  It wasn’t quite accurate.  It was more than want and need that drove the color and light.  If drunk, it was one thing.  He squirmed under Dean’s gaze and explained, “I will be brighter when my inhibitions are gone; that’s true.  But when in the presence of a beloved?  It becomes . . . subtle.  A unique mark that is shared between mates.”  He watched Dean’s expression sober under the admittance.  Blushing further, he added quietly, “When it is soft and warm like this?”  He lifted his arm, his skin barely tinged with gold, “it speaks of adoration and being enamored.”
“I, um, didn’t grow up with my father.  He was quite distant.  Possibly due to my mother dying when I was barely out of diapers.”  Castiel stayed plastered to the door, though he’d lifted his head, meeting Dean’s eyes.  “I never really learned how to communicate with him.  I spent a majority of my life in either boarding schools or universities.
He grunted at the idea.  That had been it.  The chill Castiel had exhibited.  So quick to distance himself.  Came from practice, sure, but no less painful.  And such a stark reminder of Michael’s behavior toward Dean.  The callous dismissal.  The surety that Dean would be no more than an object of pleasure.  Little more than a living, breathing fuck toy.
Still, he learned Dean’s brother, Sam, was a lawyer out in California.  Married with twin girls.  His mom and dad still lived in town, retired now.  Dean had been working for the appraiser’s office for nearly six years and was set to make partner in another two.  Successful and sexy.  Castiel stood no chance, really.
aching on those brief words.  Reaching for the wine bottle, he refilled Dean’s glass, asking quietly, “Why did you come here?  It had to be more than just a dart that brought you here.”
to Dean.  Deceiving a very nice man for a very selfish reason.  He really should come clean.  Let Dean know
he thought.  He cleared his throat, returning to the subject.  “Yeah, see, I just met him and one of his writers.  I just wanted to get some insight in how to . . . uh, deal with him?”  He winced at the lame question.
Castiel gulped his wine, coughing when it struck his throat.  He waved away Dean’s worried expression, swallowing rapidly.  “Wh-why?”
Stiff-legged, Dean did as he was bid, already tense and awaiting his correction.  Maybe Castiel had given him the number because he wasn’t
happier without him but . . . I thought maybe . . . he’d done something.”  He fidgeted, wringing his hands.  “Dean, you’re not exactly an extoller of emotion, you know?  I had to do something.”
But that was a subject for another time, right?  Things were perfectly fine right now.  And it wasn’t as though Dean had asked if he was a fairy.  He’d only asked why he lived in Grovelock.  And while Castiel hadn’t gone into specifics, it was accurate.  This was his home.
He took a deeper breath and pushed away from the counter.  It didn’t matter.  He could admit now, over a month into their time together, that he loved the man.  Truly and deeply.  Perhaps, if he told Dean that . . . he frowned.  No, Dean needed to be
The snort this time was a bit more amused.  “Yeah, little bugger has that effect on people.  Still, boneheaded move, Winchester.”
The vampire nodded.  “I don’t need them but they still taste good.”  He scooted closer to Castiel, his stool scraping the cement floor of the hardware store.  “Is this about the hunter?”
Scrambling, Castiel managed to fall out of the car, bruising his ass in the process.  “It’s … no!  I … I wasn’t …
Dean was replaceable.  Always replaceable.  Though, for once, the word sat wrong with him.  He frowned, contemplating that.
Again, the strong swipe against his crease.  He whined in pleased desperation, wriggling into Dean’s grip.  Never.
Brow furrowed, Dean shrugged.  “Not like he’d have been able to back out of it.  Gabe confirmed it.”  He pointed at the phone.  “Hell, so did you!”
”  He could see Charlie didn’t believe him so he hurried on.  “Cas is helping me with some personal stuff, is all.  He’s, uh, just a friend.”
Or primed for flight.  Dean looked tense and unhappy, fingers plucking at the seams of the car seat.  Defeated.
That was the other problem.  Dean was beyond gorgeous and had a grin that turned Castiel’s knees weak.  The fucker.
And then it all went to fucking shit.  Dean flinched, swallowing frantically as Castiel’s voice brought up those old memories.  Hard hands.  Pain.  Laughter in his ears.  The pinching bite of leather bound too close to his skin.  He fumbled with the buckle on his wrist, desperate to yank it off.  Shaking, he only stopped when Castiel’s fingers trapped him.
“I get that your angry, Cassie,” he said quietly as he unbuckled.  “But trust me; it’s for the best.”  He gave Castiel a kiss on the cheek.  “Try not to be such a stubborn bastard and call Dean tomorrow.”  He grinned as he slid out the car.  “Besides, you still need to let Gabriel know about the signing.”
“Fucker!” Dean barked.  He squinted, rubbing his head as Castiel darted back into view.  Turning the scowl on Castiel, he sighed.  “You’re a pain in the ass.”  He seemed to give up, dropping his hand and rolling his eyes.  “Dude, I’m not interesting.  You stay here and you’re just going to spend hours watching me read and build shit.”  He flipped his hand.  “Go . . . pick flowers or something.  Or set fire to things.”
Castiel opened the door and smiled.  “Evening, Dean.”  He chuckled when Dean darted in, kissing him hard on the mouth.  “My, someone’s eager?”
him.  Twisting his want into a wild thing that made his brain bubble.  He didn’t want it to end but had to wonder if he’d survive it with his intelligence intact.  “I . . . I do it . . . for control.”
All this flashed through his head as he sat across from Castiel, toying with his wine glass.  He still had Michael’s number; hadn’t the courage to delete it from his phone, apparently.  And maybe all this was just a delay of the inevitable.  Maybe he just needed to head back to Michael.  Grovel and beg for forgiveness, even as the idea made him want to vomit.
Castiel insisted on accompanying Dean to his meeting place, ignoring the barked threats and general snarls of annoyance from his reluctant companion.  Oddly, the location was closer than he’d expected, on the South Bank in front the Eye.  It seemed strange that a man who held a thief like Dean in his clutches would want to meet in such a public area.  Granted, it
“Dark as sin, boys; we go this way.”  His light clicked on and Benny trudged off, his footsteps echoing in the dusty garage.  He crossed to a far wall, pushing hard against it.  It creaked and groaned, eventually falling back, exposing another walkway.  His light wavered, “Keep movin’; guards won’t be coming by tonight since they were part of that crew we left behind.”
“Wake up, asshole,” Dean grunted.  He rolled, coming out from under Castiel’s arms, propping himself up against the headboard.  He frowned at Castiel, watching him wake up.  “What’d you do to me?”
“No matter, love,” Balthazar chirped.  He patted Castiel’s cheek and offered a quick, sly look to Dean.  “Try not to make too much noise, hm, lads?”  He wagged a finger as he backed toward the door.  “I’m not in the mood for offering up bail money today.”  With a wave, he slipped out the door, the bell dancing merrily.
He whimpered into the kiss, clinging to Dean.  God, how long had he waited for that?  How desperately had he wished to have a man want him this much?  He returned Dean’s kiss with fervor, eyes shut as he sank into the sensation.  Just hands on his skin.  Dean’s tongue in his mouth.  The heat of the man’s body
After hasty apologies and a fresh cup of coffee, Castiel spent the next few hours in Balthazar’s office, going over what was stolen.  He didn’t, however, miss the sly smirk on the other man’s mouth.
Well, at least he knew that Dean wouldn’t be a James Bartlett fan any longer.  Hard to remain so supportive when your idol is a horny asshole.
Thrilled by Dean’s overture, it took a moment for Castiel to answer.  “Dean,” he began, “I’m an adult.  I get hurt.  You get hurt.  It will happen.”
he had bad choice in hair styles – Dean had fast lost all interest in the films playing, his eyes locked on the wide grin on Castiel’s face, the tears in the blue eyes as he struggled to breathe.
Swallowing his despair, he turned, trying not to hurry out of the auto shop, as tears gathered and spilled down his cheeks.
To his surprise and delight, Castiel’s smirk ended up darker than his own.  “As I’d hoped, Dean.”  He squeezed Dean’s hand between his own.  “Besides, you might need some, er,
expected.”  He smiled.  “You don’t need all the answers now.  But perhaps, you understand why I said
Still scowling, Dean snorted.  “Yeah, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?  Forget it all until you do it again.  And again.  And again.”  He slapped his pencil down on the desk, making Castiel jump.  “You do that to all your subs?”
At least there was that, right?  Castiel sighed and inclined his head toward Benny’s path.  “Go on,” he murmured.
“True.  We do.”  He thought of young Sydney and how terrified he’d been when the sisters arrived after he’d been found, hiding in the back of Castiel’s hardware store.  He’d read such horror on the young man’s face.  How he’d thought he’d found yet more masters to abuse him.  The sisters, much as Castiel enjoyed their company, were blood-soaked; he knew that.  Could almost smell it on them at times.
Dean turns his head again to squint up at Castiel.  "I told you I wanted to fuck you.  Because I didn't think you were
Jaw clenching, he stated, “I need a few days.  To think.”  His brain buzzed too much for him to consider it properly.  The good and the bad of the decision mixed until his head pounded with pain.  If he didn’t get away, he’d make the wrong decision; whatever it might entail.  He rubbed his eyes and sighed.
Yet, he felt he understood somewhat.  He almost wished he knew where this brother of Dean’s lived.  He’d speak to that man and try to find out just how often he might have done such things.  But it spoke volumes of his fear.  In the weeks that followed their splitting, Castiel had reformed his assumptions of Dean.
Sighing again, he plucked at his gloves, leaning his hip into the counter.  The wisest step would be to end things with Dean.  As
Castiel replaced the headset and lifted his eyes to the ceiling, watching the twinkling light of the chandelier above.
Panting, his body sparking at the intrusion, Castiel let his legs wrap around Dean’s upper back and reached up, stroking the man’s sweat-streaked face.  Dean’s eyes fluttered open, their green muddy and dark.  Castiel smiled, running a thumb along his cheekbone.  “Welcome home, Dean Winchester,” he whispered.
Blinking in surprise, Castiel took a second to level a glare at the man.  “Anyone ever tell you that you drink too much?”
Finally.  They could finish this nightmare and Castiel could go back to dealing with Dean’s stupid, immature taunts.  He watched Dean follow Benny and rubbed his forehead.  Yes, the taunts were so much better than this stupid one-sided attraction he carried.
That actually made way too much sense to Dean.  He settled back in his chair and reached under the table, nudging Gabriel’s calf with his foot.  The man’s blue eyes snapped to him and he winked.  And Gabriel . . . blushed and looked away nervously.
?  He chewed his bottom lip, hoping to hide his giddy relief.  “That isn’t exactly romantic, Dean.”  His lashes fluttered as his cock began to lift again, pleasantly tormented by Dean’s continued movements.  He whimpered, fingers dropping down to dig into Dean’s wicked hips.
“I’m not fidgety,” he muttered, feeling his first sense of relief since this whole escapade started.  “Besides, Balthazar is here.  I won’t be totally alone.”
Dean plastered a grin, kicking Pam in the ankle under the desk.  “Oh, yeah.  College sweethearts all legal now.”  He wanted to glare at her but the damn camera still focused on him.  As soon as it switched, he leveled his worst glare at her, earning a sweet smile in return.
Dean laced his fingers together in front of him, staring sightless where they sat on Castiel’s polished desk.  “Cas,” he rasped, “I’m pissed.”
“Did just fine without your help,” he preened.  He plunked himself down on his couch, checking his watch.  He had a few more minutes before he had to leave to get to the restaurant.  He didn’t want to be too early but he didn’t want to keep James waiting, either.
His victim groaned, one hand over his crotch, the other resting against his thigh as he crouched on the sidewalk in front of Castiel.  He shuddered, wincing.  “Jesus,” he wheezed.
to know.  That was to have stayed locked up in the bedroom.  Away from the people who would see him for a fucked up freak.  His heart thundered in his chest and his stomach twisted, sour and heavy with forgotten food.
It wasn’t as though he’d intended it.  In fact, it’d been the furthest thing from his mind.  Dean liked to think he’d learned a few things about the human condition and a lot of it boiled down to
After dinner, they took wine to the couch and Castiel turned on the evening news, sipping at his glass and commenting on the general state of the world.  Through it all, Dean fidgeted, his body still tense from all that had happened, barely touching his wine.
He yawned and shuffled into his bed, curling up on his side as his eyes began to shut.  Maybe Balthazar?  If he framed it right, he might get the inspector on his side.  Or make things worse.
He smiled, reaching over to pat the man’s hand.  “I told you, Dean.  I’m not letting you do this alone.”
If he’d kept his hormones in check, this wouldn’t have happened.  All he’d meant to do was say Castiel’s actual name.  Get him to come clean so they
He ran a finger down the bridge of Castiel’s nose and winked.  “You look a little dazed there, Cas.”
It had gotten worse in the last two days, in reality.  Dean had shuttered the shop for two days and left town, off somewhere for a quick trip he claimed was for parts for a classic reconstruction.  But when Castiel had arrived at his home the night he returned, he’d been dismayed to find the man completely intoxicated and collapsed on the couch.  He did all he could in his diminutive form to ease the man’s torment but he couldn’t ignore the moans of pain and stilted words as some nightmare laid claim to him.
Castiel nodded, cradling Dean’s jaw.  He kissed him softly, rocking in Dean’s lap.  The man shuddered under him but made no sound.  Strange, but Castiel was already sinking too deep into his own lust to think on it long.  “Please,” he whispered, moving again.  Oh, how he wanted this man.  How he loved him.  How he
If Castiel frowned any deeper, he’d go blind.  ”Dean?” he prodded finally.  Not that it was possible.  Dean only ever left notes for him.  Never called.  He didn’t even think the man knew
And listed a cell number.  The only address was that of the old repair shop.  Realizing he still stared at the card, he stuttered, “Y-yes.  Of course.  Apologies.”  He took a small handful from Dean, his fingers buzzing when they graced Dean’s palm.
, he thought, trying not to groan in irritation.  He wanted to know what Balthazar had said to the man but on the same hand,
was meant to be shared and passed to as many as possible.  At least, that had always been Castiel's motto.  He'd run into plenty who didn't always share that impetus.  Thankfully, Gabriel and Balthazar tended to think like him.
Panting, chest heaving, Castiel hardly noticed when a third finger slid inside.  He whimpered, shifting back, trying to take more.  God, he felt empty.  He needed more than Dean’s clever fingers.  They worked his tight skin artfully but he
“It isn’t pity!” Castiel shot back.  He shivered under the driving rain but wasn’t about to leave this time.  “It’s understanding.  Dean, the things you went through . . . a lesser man would have
“I think it takes a bit more than that, Cassie,” his cousin, Balthazar, pointed out.  He picked up his coffee and murmured, “Bit more buildup, I think.”
Castiel nodded.  ”Sam.  Yes.  We’re aware of him.  He doesn’t seem to know where you are, though,” he pointed out.
Fingers clenched in the sheets, Dean nodded.  “Y-yeah.  W-went home and . . . yanked it to your face.  Th-then found out who you were.”  His eyes were shut tight as he squirmed.  “Kinda . . . always made sure I was where you were.”
He wrote briefly of John’s death.  If his time as a specter.  How he blamed himself in such short words.  Castiel’s heart clenched.  The desperation bled through even with Dean’s succinct writing.  How he wanted to kill this
Frowning, he reached down, drawing the backs of his fingers against Dean’s cheek.  “Dean?  Are you --?”
Dean screwed up his face and without thinking remarked, “Only opera singers have passion in their voices.”  He winced and slapped his hand to his forehead.
Wait, this wasn’t what he’d expected.  He waited with coiled tension, for Castiel to rescind the words but when the man remained silent, expectant for Dean’s response, a giddy laugh burst out.  Blushing at Castiel’s wide-eyed look, rubbed the back of his neck.  The sudden welling of relief left him trembling anew.  “Hey, you know.  You
”  He reached out, touching Dean’s sodden chest, feeling his heart thud wildly.  “That you didn’t . . . that you stand here
Well, yeah.  Sort of.  Hot sex and amazing characters.  Initially, he’d started reading James’ work after college, his foray into gay sex, so to speak.  He hadn’t yet come out as bisexual so it was the closest he’d come to indulging himself when it came to sexuality with men.  As he’d grown more used to his own standing, starting
Dean blinked and then grinned.  The cold had to be why he did it.  Brain cells frozen.  Or dead.  Or both.  He leaned in and husked, “I know a
“I don’t deserve you,” he growled between kisses, his hands rubbing rough and hard against Castiel’s shoulders, “but I want you.  I
Why on earth had he done that?  Castiel wasn’t anything to Dean.  Not really.  He wasn’t even a publisher.  He was a lie.  A fraud.  A stranger to Dean.  But that kiss had been so sweet and tender.  Kind.  He didn’t deserve that.  At all.  Why would Dean have done that?
Head thrown back, Castiel gasped in delight.  He had no words left.  Dean’s mouth tormented him, all hot sweetness while fingers jabbed at him insistently, making him quiver and shake.  He pressed his heels into the bed, trying to thrust into Dean’s mouth and whined when the man only pinned him harder to the bed.  He needed more, though.  Needed it all.  His fingers tore at the quilt and begged and pleaded for Dean’s terrible touch.
Stunned, Dean stared at Castiel.  The other man met his gaze unwavering.  Swallowing his mouthful of food, Dean breathed out.  “Damn, you’re wordy,” he blurted.  He scrunched his eyes shut as Castiel chuckled.  “Sorry.  I just . . . I’m still trying to figure it all out, to be honest.”  He poked at his food.  “But, I, uh, missed you.  A lot.”
"The last time I cuffed you, you made me out to be a fool," he warned as he set the tin tray on Dean’s lap and handed him a fork.  "Do it a second time and you can guarantee I’ll never be charitable again."
Snuggling deeper into his blanket, Castiel nodded morosely.  ”Yes,” he whispered.  ”It pains me to swallow and talk.”
Dean shrugged.  ”Yeah, so what.  Colds are seasonal, anyway.”  He winced.  ”Well, more than seasonal.  They’re just kind of annoying.  So, even if we hadn’t done that, Sam and I will eventually get a cold.”
Feeling that same, sickening twist in his stomach, Dean licked his lips.  “Which means you’ll do it again, won’t you?  Pretend you’re straight?”
“Oh, like,” he leaned in, nipping Castiel’s earlobe, “more of that kiss?”  He slid a hand around to the inside of Castiel’s thigh, squeezing possessively.  “I’m pretty good at more than that,” he teased.
He resumed his pencil tapping, staring into space as he mulled the idea.  True, Castiel could just write Dean off but given his prompt response to the text, it was clear he wasn’t willing to.  And there had been no denying the man’s visceral reactions.  He’d been devastated by Dean’s remarks.  Possibly as hurt as Dean had been.
It hurt Dean to hear that loss of confidence.  But even so, he wouldn’t let himself fall again.  Not like with Michael.  Michael had done the apology dance with him one time too many.  The promises to never do it again.  The supposed regret.  Still so fresh.  He just . . . couldn’t do that.  He needed to know it was for real and not just a ploy on Castiel’s part.  Though, thinking that it might be made him want to heave.  Swallowing, Dean rose from the chair and met Castiel’s eyes.  “When –
Frowning, Castiel shook his head.  “You were far from stupid, Dean.  Alastair took advantage.  Granted, had you not been a thief in the first place,” he began, smiling at Dean’s glare, “this would be a non-issue.  But his interference is not your fault.”
Because, ideally, Castiel embodied all those awesome things he looked for in guys.  All of it in a tidy, trim, sexy package.  And maybe Dean had a bit of a complex when it came to his life in comparison to others.  He remembered being destitute and struggling.  Knew he’d barely finished high school and never went farther.  So, on paper, Dean looked kind of . . . dull.
The light blue eyes suddenly hardened.  ”Because I am well aware of the leak in my office.  I see no reason to give her more fuel for this nonsense.”
fine.  Sounded happy and charming.  But he wouldn’t touch Castiel and when lunch was over, he slipped away quickly, not even offering up a kiss like that morning.
Blushing and fiddling with the wine bottle, Castiel shrugged.  “I . . . it’s no trouble, Dean.  A-as I said, I wanted to welcome you to town.”  He darted into the kitchen, uncorking the wine and pouring two hefty glasses.  He returned to the living room, handing one to Dean as he did.  “Please, sit.”
Dean snagged a roll from the tray Jessica carried and snorted.  “Pfft.  No you won’t.  You’d never find another absolute
Heart lodged in his throat, Castiel pulled the journal into his lap, reading more.  He looked up only once when the lighter clicked out of its resting space but turned back, flipping pages slowly.  So young.  Both were
“I don’t care.”  Dean ignored the hurt in Castiel’s eyes in that moment.  “I’m not saying you had to throw out a banner saying ‘
Castiel sat back, grimacing at the pull at his side.  Thankfully, Interpol had sprung for first class so at least he wouldn’t be crammed into a tiny seat on top of everything.  Maybe, he could drink enough to knock himself out and forget all the damn turmoil in his head.
Sydney sighed loudly in defeat, “Okay,” he mumbled.  “G’night, Castiel,” he added, sounding more like the sixteen-year-old he looked like.
Dean groaned, face upturned against a pillow.  “I’ve . . . I’ve wanted you longer,” he taunted.  He grinned shakily.  “That f-first time I saw you?  God, you were
had become the new wrinkle in his life.  He’d fully intended to disappear into the shadows after Sam’s recrimination.  It would have been the least he’d deserved.  He never disagreed with Sam; he had lied in a way.  He’d let Gadreel infest his brother in a blind attempt to keep him alive.  Even if it had been for Sam’s benefit, he’d neglected to warn Sam about the angelic stowaway.
how humans took ill from too much drink.  More like a burnt out lightbulb.  If Castiel became ill while in fairy form, it might take him days to revert back to his mortal self.  Aware of that, he slowed, sipping at his whiskey.  It warmed him pleasantly and he trilled, hoping to convey his happiness.
Castiel wanted to see what had happened but another look might register in Crowley’s periphery.  If he knew how far out Bobby was, he might be able to surprise the man.  Though, he didn’t know
that?”  Dropping his hands, he shook his head.  “Fuck, Cas.  I mean . . . you know I’m a hunter; great.  Do you have any idea what that means?”
“He goes by . . .” he glanced frantically around his car, noting a magazine with Tom Hiddleston on the over, “Loki?”
word but speaking can . . .” he trailed off, looking down.  “I haven’t nearly the same confidence,” he admitted.
The bells of Dean’s shop jangled loud and sharp in his ears and he winced, blushing as heads swiveled his way.  To his relief, Dean grinned and marched over to him, trailed by Balthazar.  After a brief hesitation, Dean gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and murmured, “You okay?”
More than three sheets to the wind; he's got the damn boat upside down at this point.  The kind of drunk he's not been since college.  When he and his buddies tried to outdo each other Wednesday through Sunday.  Given
They’d kissed.  Rather desperately, from his memory, and the stupid shit couldn’t stick around?  So much for an actual emotion behind the gesture.  He figured it was as he’d originally feared; Dean just getting his jollies any way he could.  Castiel just happened to be close by.
Shit.  Did this mean Sam knew?  He knew about Dean and his . . . perversions?  Because it wasn’t normal.  Couldn’t be if he had to slink around in clubs or hide the gear.  Now Sam just had confirmation his brother was a messed up freak.
To his surprise, Dean stared down at his feet, blushing brightly.  Castiel jerked his head up when Balthazar chuckled.
He could see Castiel in loose, dark clothing, commanding him to kneel.  His arms yanked above him, rope bound to his wrists, looped through a ring in the ceiling.  His legs wrapped in more rope, forced to remain at his knees, unable to move.  His cock throbbed at the idea.  Of him pinned and helpless.  Hard and naked while this man stood before him.
Yeah, let Sam see him freaking out over all this.  That’d be the literal icing on the cake.  Not like Sam didn't know he was bi but the guy didn’t have a
Dean lifted the shotgun, cocking it a second time, aiming at the werewolf’s head.  “Do you know how many of you bitches I’ve put down?”  He grinned, all sour malice.  “Go on; I dare ya.”
Crooning and purring, Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair.  He let his legs fall wide, sighing when Dean settled fully between them.  “We will decide then.  For now, you are Dean
my Impala.”  Dean grunted as he stopped, fingers latching onto Castiel.  ”Where’s my baby?” he hissed.
He shivered, rubbing his arms, the chill nothing like the cold morning air.  Castiel rehashed their aborted conversation, his mood sinking.
He hung up with Castiel and set his phone down, sighing.  He sat forward, rubbing his forehead with both hands.  Dean didn’t enjoy being stuck in his head for so long but with Castiel, it kept happening.  He would rehash everything he said or did, looking for the thing that was preventing them from being an
“Very funny,” he husked, trying to glare but finding it difficult to focus.  He mewled desperately when Dean bit down on his neck, his fingers flying up to tangle into the man’s still wet hair.  Dean repeated the action and Castiel was soon panting, squirming underneath Dean as he tried to find friction.
He shuddered as he halted in the air, sensing the boundary easily.  In all his life, this was the only thing he feared.  His clan’s retribution should he dare intrude on their territory again.  Nothing Dean represented or could dream up came close to that.  Mood dark once again, he turned and fluttered away, coming across Dean’s cabin quickly.
Ignoring the clear warmth in the man’s voice, Dean blurted, “Why don’t you want me?”  Dean continued pacing, nearly stomping along the threadbare carpet of his office.  “I’m ready for sex, I swear it.  You can . . . whatever.  You can do whatever you want to me.  I’ll take it; I swear.”  He swallowed, his breath coming faster.  “I’ll sign any contract.  Please.  Just . . . I’m,” his voice broke off as his mind finished the thought
How's that for a holiday surprise?  :D  The chapter after this will probably have my normal waiting period but I didn't want y'all to explode given the cliffhanger from before.
With a grunt, his forearms covered in sweat and grease, he realized the thoughts wouldn’t fade.  Not entirely.  He always had to hash out this overly-friendly Dom who just wanted to help.  He swore as he stripped a bolt, flinging the wrench away across the concrete floor.  Folding his arms over his eyes, he grit his teeth, sucking in air.  Maybe that’s what this whole issue stemmed from.  The oddity of their relationship.  Why would a Dom care if Dean was fucked in the head?  Maybe he still felt guilty over Dean’s stupid freak out that first day.
Dean’s hands were warm under the t-shirt as he pushed it off, stripping Castiel completely.  Naked now, Dean lowered his head, sucking gently at Castiel’s neck.  His words rumbled into Castiel’s skin, making him shiver.  “What if . . . the town learns I’m a Winchester?”
needed to be looked after.  Dean was fine.  Dean had it all figured out.  Messed up as it was.  The idea that Sam felt he needed to step in proved that Dean hadn’t held it together as well as he’d thought.
Dean buried himself in work the rest of the afternoon, hoping to stave off the worst of such thoughts.
Castiel thought.  He tucked his hands into his jeans and shrugged, even though Dean’s back was too him.  He cleared his throat and said quietly.  “I had . . . something on my mind.”
Which frankly, sounded like bullshit.  He’d bet his pension that Dean was familiar with Singer.  Probably for longer than Castiel.  Though, why hadn’t Singer ever told him?  The man was fairly open with Castiel.  In fact, he’d always been the one to make certain that Castiel was on Dean’s cases.  He never tried to warn him away and never asked him for leniency with Dean.  But an argument for another time, likely.  Still glaring at Dean, he addressed Benny.
Balthazar barely looked at them as he scrolled through his phone.  ”Oh, didn’t I tell you?”  He grinned as he lifted the phone to his ear.  ”Can’t imagine why I’d do that.”  He winked and his smile lessened as his call appeared to connect.  ”Ah, hello, luv.”
it.  Not even a shitty sheet cake.  An actual, honest-to-God, fancy-ass cake decorated in tiny edible dicks.
that rolled off him like exhaust.  Even given the distance, Castiel quailed at the ferocity that spilled.
He’d expected mockery.  Derision.  Amusement.  Not the worry.  The concern.  That almost seemed to hurt worse.
“I didn’t.  Bobby called me, as well.”  He sat back, staring ahead.  “It’s a soul that I need to see returned.  You will
Castiel pulled out his gun, checking the clip.  “Tell me, Benny; why has Crowley not secured this access point?”
“You know, Cas, that thing should be buried by now.  Think you’ve had it for as long as I’ve known you.”
see about looking for Dean.  He knew where that land sat.  Somewhere in Kansas.  Lawrence, possibly.  He couldn’t quite remember the town.  So, really, he could
Despite his shame over what had just happened in his office, Dean couldn’t help but grin a little.  It faded, however, when he realized how far he had to go to be a good sub.  If anything, his anxiety attack and the ill-timed masturbation were proof enough.  He sighed and tucked his phone in his pocket, turning his thoughts to choosing a restaurant for tomorrow.
Castiel blinked, surprised.  He’d never had made that connection.  Dean had supposedly started around age nineteen.  According to their files, Sam was just over four years younger.  The heaviest of his sprees were in the beginning.  He’d tapered off in recent years but not by much.  It made too much sense to be a lie.
BEHEHEHEEHEE!  Even in romantic comedies, I will employ a cliffhanger.  I'm nothing if not shameless.  *flees*
Dean almost wanted to stay.  But he turned, heading out, the pleasant jingle of the store’s bell shrieking in his ears even after he slid behind the wheel of the Impala.  And he most certainly did
Castiel moaned and fell forward onto his forearms, breath panting through his chest.  He jumped when he felt something wet and strong pry at his hole.  “D-dean?” he rasped.
What little the interviewer had managed to pull from Castiel now fermented in Dean’s head.  He had a few boxes in his head to tick off in terms of riling the man up before he was willing to give up his new game.  He didn’t intend to embarrass Castiel or humiliate him; just . . . well, honestly, had Castiel been up front that first day, Dean might have given into his initial impulse of asking the guy out.  He’d seen him walk in, so flustered and shaky and had immediately been smitten.  When he’d
Dean blinked at him, a slow grin pulling at his lips.  “I think you swore at me but you basically sound like a record skipping.”  His green eyes warmed and he chuckled.  Dean yawned and licked his lips.  “Feel free to stay if you want,” he murmured.  “Dunno if you guys even sleep.”
For a moment, Dean’s gaze took on that hard-edged suspicion he’d glimpsed in the hardware store but it softened quickly.  “Sure.  Sounds good.”  He shifted his bag again, looking at the watch on his wrist.  “Say, six?  Or, you know, whatever works.”
he could switch off with Sam but then again, this was his baby so fat chance.  Which meant a numb ass and a burning crick in his back.
By eleven, Bobby kept throwing him the stink eye but Dean hadn’t stopped roving around the shop.  He and Bobby were partners in the restoration business but Dean didn’t think for one second he was actually the one in charge.  Bobby never hesitated to put him in his place.  Even so, he found himself unable to stop moving and after picking up the same torque wrench for the fifth time in a span of five minutes, he wasn’t all that surprised to hear Bobby sigh.
begging for forgiveness.  Was it heading that way with Castiel, then?  Was Dean just a step away from letting the man have whatever he wanted?
So, Monday morning, he sat on the edge of his bed, dressed in slacks, white-collared shirt, blue tie and jacket.  Staring at the mirror.  He turned, looking down at his cell phone and with a shaking finger, scrolled through the latest messages.
Smiling, Castiel directed Dean to the requisite cabinets and the other man helped him scoop out two messy, but heaping, plates of steaming lasagna.  They sat at Castiel’s tiny table, sipping wine and chatting about inconsequential things.
He left the car and trudged up the walk, feeling a curl of cold air tickle his neck.  Pushing open the door, Castiel walked in, finding lights blazing and not much else in the building.  The smell of old dust mingled with the newer smells of paint and coffee.  He inched his way in, wondering if he should have his service piece on him.  Hearing movement in another area, he tiptoed closer.  He cleared his throat and tapped on the door frame, smirking at the form bent over a short distance away.
He locked up the store, just as it began to rain.  He almost grinned at the sight.  He could mute his colors to match the raindrops themselves, hopefully giving him some bit of camouflage.  Formulating his plan carefully, he hurried home, nearly vibrating with anticipation.  Once inside, he locked all doors and windows but for his one escape hatch and shifted quickly, trilling at the pop of his wings.
They waited at the same stop to get on the train and got off at the same stop downtown.  Turned out that Commuter Angel’s office building sat less than a block away from Dean’s.  Which mean, at any point and time, Dean could have pulled his head out of his ass and asked Commuter Angel out to lunch or maybe to get drinks after.
Stripping naked in his bedroom, he recited the spell that would remove the charm from his wrist.  His viewpoint immediately bloomed as his body shrank to his natural form.  He stretched his wings, feeling the blood and magic surge through the cramped membrane.  Darting out through the small aperture he’d left in his window, he sped across town, heading for his old home.
Castiel shrugged, inwardly concerned by Dean’s changed demeanor.  In all his years of knowing the younger man, he’d never seen this anger.  Dean was always a flirty jokester.  Quips and winks.  This … this was a tightly controlled, frustrated rage.
He wanted to say the words but couldn’t under that direct gaze, instead dropping his own to stare at the edge of Castiel’s desk.
Disappointed and frankly, half-asleep.  He took his empty mug to the counter and slipped on his jacket, ready to head home.  Outside, the rain still fell and he squinted through the drops, horrified to see his bike chain had been cut and his transportation gone.
“Am not,” he finally replied.  He wiped his mouth on a napkin and grabbed a fry, gesturing with it.  “People can be single, you know?”
Amused, Castiel licked the seam of his parted lips.  “Oh, did I forget?  Seems I’m the head of a US Interpol office now.”  With his other hand, he gripped Dean’s ass tight, feeling possession flood his system.  “And frankly, as my initial duty, it’s best I keep . . .
“Only if you want me to,” Dean replied.  He leaned easily against the doorway.  “Cas, I’m not here to hurt you; I swear it.”
He’d been so wrong.  About a great many things, it seemed.  He’d not had much chance to talk to either Dean or Balthazar given the crowd but by two that afternoon, the crowd had left and only the three men remained in the shop.
His head spun as he struggled not to come right then.  All that warm, silky heat wrapped so tight around his dick.
He glanced again at Castiel, somewhat surprised to see the man’s face pale.  Castiel met Dean’s eyes and looked away quickly.
Dean nodded, phantom fingers and haunting blue surging through his mind.  “Uh, yeah.  Just . . . you, uh, mind driving for a bit?”
He wanted to throttle the thief.  He’d come close to capturing the other man three years ago.  To the point of having the bastard in handcuffs.  He should have known that it had been too quick and clean.  And Dean had been so goddamn at ease sitting in his office.
“Better hurry, though,” Gabriel warned.  “When Cassie’s upset, he sometimes lights out for days at a time.”
man.  How was that possible?  He shoved the gear stick into park, leaning back, staring up at the roof, the rain drumming fast and loud.  In all the time he’d been with Dean, he’d never seen him cruel.  Or cold.  Not until he’d confronted him in the auto shop.  Until he’d seen him react to the werewolf who’d stalked him.
Originally, he’d started up with the train because the Impala’s starter shat the bed and the replacement took a week to get in.  So, really, he should have ridden for a week.  He hated the train.  Crowded, noisy, smelled awful on a good day.  A week was doable, but painful.
“Christ,” he muttered, rubbing his eyes.  He needed sleep.  For like a week.  He and Sam had just had two nasty hunts back-to-back and then Bobby’s urgent call.  He
Eyebrows quirking, Dean snorted.  “I’m not . . . gonna stop wanting to protect you,” he rasped.  He canted himself to the left, using his other hand to tug on Castiel’s borrowed sleep pants.  Castiel followed the prompt and wriggled out of them, chirping when Dean lowered himself, letting their cocks slide against one another.
“Well, then.  No reason to freak out, right?”  The man coughed and shook out his left leg, twitching his shoulders as he did.  “Gotta admit, you got me pretty good.”
“Well, you’re officially bad at judging character, Ca-Fireball.”  He opened his mouth as though to say more but clapped it shut quickly, simply shaking his head.  He set Castiel down by his half-filled thimble and sat with a thump.  He reached over the side of the chair, pulling up a blanket Castiel had overlooked earlier.  He covered himself with it, wriggling in the seat as he resituated himself.
He made it another hour before he recalled Castiel’s message.  He’d not heard a peep since then.  Pursing his lips, he tapped his schedule book, wondering if he should just blow the whole thing off and simply
Said man pulled his hand away and ran it through his soaked hair, the strands flopping over one side.  “I’m Dean.  Dean Winchester.”
Castiel had for him.  Besides, after their brief one-on-one the day before, Dean was so damn close to ending this whole fiasco that he wasn’t all that certain he wanted to see Castiel.  While he’d held out yesterday, he had his doubts he could keep from begging for Castiel to forget.  That Dean wasn’t mad.  It was all fine.
At Castiel’s home, the man paused before exiting the car, turning to Dean and kissing him fully on the mouth.   “You are exceptional, pet,” he murmured.  He stroked Dean’s jaw and kissed him again.  “And delightful as always.”  He said nothing else and turned to go, offering Dean a brief wave before he slipped into his house.
Castiel’s cheeks flared hot.  “I . . . I mean . . . my . . . company’s book.  I’ve read them.  All of them.  A lot.”
” Dean snapped.  He grabbed Castiel by the shoulders and shook him, much like in the auto shop.  “What the fuck would you have done if he’d seen you?”
will come through for us.”  The cars were nearly there.  They burned through his head, tearing up dirt and gravel.  He could hear the officers murmuring in confusion.  Then alarm.  He turned then, pushing Dean down into a squat behind the van.  “I don’t trust anyone right now,” he admitted.
Nothing.  No sudden opening of the door.  Begging of forgiveness.  Just abject silence from the house behind him.
He smiled crookedly, shaking Castiel’s hand off.  “It’s okay.  I get it.  I was bad for Michael and thought . . . maybe you’d fix me.”  It was strange how easy it was for him to speak to Castiel, even in such negative light.  With Michael, talking always seemed a last resort.  As though Dean was simply
The couch creaked as Dean moved.  His tongue danced up the cleft of his ass before he pressed lips to his skin.  “How ya feelin’?”
Castiel blushed as he stood.  The color only deepening as he glanced down, Dean’s green eyes following the movement, a cheeky grin curling his plush lips.  Seems he wasn’t the only one awake at the moment, given the state of his briefs.  He shut his eyes tight and muttered a sharp,
Though the real Gabriel had pressed him over why he wanted that old article, Dean had been tight-lipped and had actually read the damn thing three times before Castiel had called.  It was cute, actually.  He could almost see a younger Castiel, all bright-eyed and optimistic but still so reserved and shy.  He’d talked about his first book,
“Tired, bitch.  Let me drink my coffee.”  He fished in the bag pulling out a burger.  He barely tasted it as he chewed, his mind instead drawn to the squeeze on his fingers at his final question.
Unmindful of his turmoil, Dean sighed and clicked through more channels, landing on a true-crime show.  “The guy’s . . . pretty awesome,” he began.  He glanced once at Castiel before continuing on.  “Lives in town; runs that hardware store.  I have no idea what he sees in me, though.  Guy like him should have people lining up at the door.”  He pointed at Castiel, peering at him.  “But then he goes and . . . fuck.  He’s . . . shit.  I don’t deserve what he has.”
Well on his way to frustrated, he threw himself into his work, focusing on a restoration of a Model A.  The longer he spent under the car, the less time he had to worry about what he was to Castiel.  How . . . useless he was as a sub.  How fucked up the whole thing really was.  Cars were so simple to read.  If anything went wrong, there was a way to fix it.  If not, the damn thing hit the junkyard.  But people were harder.  No blueprint existed to clue a person in.  All just . . . trial and error.
me, Agent?”  Chewing his bottom lip, he added, “You had me in cuffs in England.  Bet you that’s why you had that . . .
Snarling and spitting, the werewolf said nothing at first, his hands flexing.  Beneath the skin, Castiel could sense his power
“Cas,” he croaked, falling back to slump on his ass.  He held his head in his hands.  “I don’t deserve that.”
that Dean felt the same.  Even if he hadn’t yet used the words.  But Dean had also lost so much.  His barriers high and nigh impenetrable.
?  What the fuck?  Sick to his stomach but growing angrier by the second, Dean grabbed his jacket from the rack and slipped it on, before
“I know you’re in there!” he snapped, pacing the front lawn.  Castiel watched him try to move forward but Dean’s wards were definitely high quality; the werewolf could go no further.  He spared a thought for that.  He himself had been able to reach the windows.  Had Dean . . . left a gap somewhere for
“Oh,” he began.  He said nothing else, only reached out and tugged on Dean’s hand.  “Please, let’s take a moment in the living room.”  He said nothing more until they were both seated on the couch.  With a low cough, he leaned forward, elbows on his knees.  After a moment, he reached out, taking one of Dean’s hands.  “My apologies, Dean.  I had . . . I suppose I hadn’t thought that through very well.”  He smiled weakly.  “I clearly could do with hearing my own advice and actually
Taking a chance, Castiel opened the car door and slid inside, startling Dean.  Catching the man off guard, Castiel tugged his head toward him, kissing him deeply.  Dean grunted, clearly surprised, before he softened, his hand sliding along Castiel’s waist.  Eager fingers dug into the loops of Castiel’s jeans and he purred, pleased with the warmth that shivered through him.
of their conversation the next day.  Considering how he barely managed not to evacuate his entire body into Dean’s toilet, probably for the best.
He stirred the soup on the stove, staring at it as the pale broth began to bubble.  That clawed at him, really.  He wasn’t stupid; some of that decision had to be because of Dean himself.  Castiel had given up eternity to spend it with a couple of hell-bound idiots.  Probably more so because of
He breathed a sigh of relief when he recognized Sam’s number.  “Hey, bitch,” he chirped, unbuttoning another button on his shirt, squinting in the mirror as he did.  Not too much chest.  Just the right amount.  Besides, the t-shirt kept it classy.  Like . . . strip club classy.
He blinked, surprised.  But . . . what?  And then he found it, a scribbled page of drunken rambling.  How he
Well and truly drunk.  Castiel was horrified by the sight.  The man stumbled down the hall and Castiel shut the door, locking it again.  He followed carefully, noting that the cabin was in disarray.  Things knocked over.  A lamp broken.  He could smell spoiled food from the kitchen.  But the living room made him ache.
"It’s not like that," he muttered.  He shifted in his seat.  "This … thief.  He’s very … obnoxious."
He slapped the window frame.  “All right, you sit up there and be bird food.  I’m going back to my book.”  He snapped the window closed, turning away.
Castiel sighed lightly, rubbing his forehead.  ”How did you know I was here?” he asked, exhaustion seeping into his voice.  This was
’ and then you just . . . you let . . .” Sam gave up, sagging in his seat.  “Dean, you deserve good things, okay?”  He laughed humorlessly.  “I mean, look at how much you’re doing for Jess and I.  It’s not cheap!  Paying for our honeymoon?  The reception hall?  Dean, selfish people don’t do that.”
Frustrated, Dean rubbed his face.  “Then . . . how do I get what I want?” he breathed, not even aware that he’d said the words until he felt Castiel’s warm fingers on his wrist.
If he heard a woman’s name — or another man’s — Castiel would scream.  Patient, he folded his arms and sighed.  ”Pray tell; what
That … was unexpected.  Four days to repeat what he’d done?  Digging for the phone in his pocket, Castiel stated, “Dean, let me call my director.  He can get men to Sam’s home immediately.”
Castiel’s expression softened and nuzzled Dean, breathing in slow.  "It’s all right,” he breathed.  “You're with me, now.  You aren't as you were.  You live here, with me.  This is your home.  This is your life.”  He kissed Dean softly, trilling low and deep.
A simple sense of comfort began to wriggle in Dean’s chest.  He swallowed harshly, startled by it.  Did . . . did Castiel actually
He shrugged, clicking open the bottle of lube, letting the cold liquid spill over his fingers.  He stroked Dean’s hole, savoring the quaking sigh as he did.  “Do you know how long I’ve wanted you?” he rasped.  He slid two fingers into Dean, marveling at the heat and tightness.  “How long I’ve
Castiel’s grin broadened as he patted Dean’s wrist.  “I hoped that you would want to, Dean.”  He laced his fingers with Dean’s, squeezing his hand.  “For now, though; home?”
“Dean, fairies are keen to deceive; it’s what we’re taught to do.”  He pulled his hand away.  “I misled many travelers in this area.  Caused their injury.  Possibly their death.”  He swallowed.  He hoped it wasn’t the case but he wouldn’t have been surprised.  It had, honestly, been his impetus to begin visiting Grovelock.  Guilt and fear and curiosity, in equal measures.  He’d only ever followed his king’s instructions.  Never questioned
Two wounds, once that grazed his upper arm and the other, nicking a chunk out of his shoulder.  But nothing fatal.
To his surprise, Dean fell to his knees, his arms wrapping around his waist.  Face buried in Castiel’s midriff, he mumbled, “I . . . I know this’s a dream but . . . I . . . Cas, I
“Also, you need a new hobby.  Watching an idiot hunter fall asleep in front of the tv has to be the worst way to pass the time,” he chided.
Guilt nearly choked Dean and he smiled, hoping to alleviate the tension.  “I’m sorry . . . Gabe,” he began.  “I, uh, might have read things wrong?”  He’d thought for
Dean’s green eyes were hazy and bright.  ”Ow,” he muttered.  ”Shitty bedside manner, Cas.”  He shifted as though to sit up and yelped when the handcuffs halted him.  Dean rolled his neck and then glared at Castiel.  ”Seriously?  I’m wounded, Cas!”
Dean sat up a little straighter and shifted over.  ”Sit.  You look like crap.”  He patted the grass beside him.  When Castiel didn’t move, he snickered.  ”I don’t bite.”  A wicked grin.  ”Unless you ask me nicely.”
Sam grumbled, with a faint smile on his face as they made their way to the dining room.  The trio sat and began dishing out pasta and vegetables, most of the talk revolving around the upcoming wedding.  A lot of it bored Dean.  He didn’t have an opinion on napkins or lights.  Tableware just had to poke food.  Hell, enough alcohol would get anyone drunk.
The towel had fallen away and Dean’s cock was already half-erect, wet with water and warmly flushed.  Shaking, Dean licked his lips, eyes darting around Castiel’s face.  “I . . . I’ll probably still be a dick.  Try to get you to go.”
Balthazar blinked and then smiled.  “Oh?”  He leaned forward.  “You don’t want our charming Interpol agent involved?”
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline.  He sighed with drama, lifting his arms around Dean’s neck.  “Can’t say that I disagree with his advice, Dean.  Your thoughts?”  He licked his lips, leering all the while.
Dean grinned, holding up his thumb.  “Messy eater there, Gabe,” he chimed, wiping it off on a napkin.
But Dean wouldn’t hear him otherwise.  Was it truly so terrible to wind a truth spell into his touch?  To coax the honesty from a man who sank beneath it?  He wanted to
Balthazar chuckled as he drew to the curb outside the restaurant.  ”I see,” he mused.  He said nothing, leaving the car and gesturing for Castiel to do the same.
Castiel didn’t answer immediately, waiting for their waiter to pour out two glasses of wine before he’d respond.  He picked up his glass and sipped.  “You’ve clearly not had the
“Why not go smite it now?” Dean chided.  He smirked at Castiel’s squint.  He figured it a win every time he dragged one of those out.  “I mean, if it’s so damn imperative.”
He returned a weak one of his own and fidgeted, his shoes squeaking against the hardwood of Dean’s store.  “A-allow me to introduce myself.”  He clenched his hands together, breathing in again.
happy.  He wanted a relationship.  Wanted someone to talk to, to spend time with.  Someone who didn’t care that he wrote porn or that he had to wad up his socks a particular way, had to organize the books a certain way.
More confusion.  So James was real, obviously.  Then who the fuck had Gabriel been?  Dean let go of his pencil, feeling a headache surge.  Jesus.  “Uh, right.  Yes.  I just wanted to see if there was anything you’d need from me on my end.”
Castiel sighed, frowning.  By nature, fairies were perceptive creatures.  Mood, if one knew how to look, took very little effort to suss out.  And he hadn’t been wrong to think Dean’s mood shifted wildly from one moment to the next.  He hid something from Castiel.  More than being a hunter, he was certain of that now.  A secret that slowly ate at the man’s soul, leaving it ragged and wounded.  Given his state the night before, a very deep, dark secret.  He’d felt Dean’s terror as thick as the blanket he’d been shivering under.  His guilt and fear.
“You’re drunk,” Castiel stated, surprised.  Dean reeked of alcohol.  His eyes were bloodshot and his face flush.  Given that not much time had passed, he had to wonder if Dean had even paused to breathe as he’d sucked down whatever booze he’d chosen tonight.
Maybe the man was standoffish due to coming from a city?  Maybe small-town life was too new to him.  There were a few others he’d seen behave the same way.  Time settled them quickly, however.  Moving from behind the counter, Castiel grabbed a broom and began sweeping.  After a bit, the newcomer slipped from his mind and he found himself once more lost in his daily routine.
Dean towered over him, squinting at the writing.  “Why not?” he answered.  He snorted.  “I’ve no story to tell, Fireball.  I just live here and I fix cars.  That’s it.”
Wait.  That . . . that sounded like a flirt.  Hold the phone.  Didn’t Dean regret what had happened?  He should.  Then again, he’d been acting a bit odd since Castiel showed up.  Still, why would he suddenly start this whole mess again?  Confused, Castiel shook his head.  “No, thank you.  I will be little more than room decoration.”
Ten in the morning, right when Castiel’s shop opened, Dean was there, waiting in a tempered rage.  He’d thought hard on what had happened the night before.  And really, Castiel owed him the mother of all explanations.  Even if he wasn’t out to his dad, Dean didn’t need to be treated like a
Dean shuddered as Castiel opted for bandages only, gritting his teeth at the press of fingers and padding.  ”H-had to go somewhere,” he husked.  ”Th-they know my … safe house.”  He fell back, panting, hands clenched in the cuffs.  ”Don’t know you, I don’t think.  Not yet … anyway.”
The man surprised him by yanking him into another frenzied, sloppy kiss.  As though desperate for silence.  Castiel wanted to pursue the thought further but Dean had already unzipped his jeans, his hand sliding into his boxers to stroke his hardening cock.
Dean jerked away when he felt a hand on his neck.  Eyes wide and wild, he met Castiel’s dark blue.  The sorrow in them cut like knives but Dean’s own nerves were far too frayed.  He couldn’t take that affection right now.  Didn’t want it.  “Don’t,” he rasped.  “Don’t touch me right now.”
Castiel turned and glared at Dean.  Frustrated, he blurted, “Why are you sitting here?  For the last four years,
Dean shut his eyes and licked his lips.  Words were easy.  He could say these words.  Even though it terrified him to do so, his voice rough and shaky, he managed, “Stay with me?”
Gabriel didn’t answer, just rubbed his face as James walked into the restaurant.  He jumped when Dean leaned into murmur, “You okay?”
“It does matter,” Dean interjected roughly.  He slapped the rag in his hand down on the car and hissed, “If you knew
Pleased, he kissed the tip of Dean’s nose and turned off the tv, stomping on the power button of the remote.  The cabin fell into darkness and silence, filled only with Dean’s softened breathing.  Castiel darted to the window and ignoring the burning pain in his hand, pulled it shut, satisfied only when he heard the latch click into place.  He crooned at his blistered palms, knowing full well he’d need to wear gloves the next day; hopefully, the burns would ease by the time he met Dean for dinner.
Ignoring the comment, he fluttered up higher, plopping himself down atop Dean’s head.  He yipped at the soft tickle of the man’s hair against his legs and butt.  Making himself comfortable, he patted Dean’s scalp.
him.  He’d never felt that.  Not even from his family.  He licked his lips, fingers scratching at his jeans.
he admitted silently.  He sat back again, feeling his heart slow bit by bit.  “You . . . uh, you ever been interested in a classic car?”
That cold, detached tone from before.  The way he’d called Castiel a ‘good lay.’  These mannerisms were familiar to Dean.  That he could slip into them so easily was troubling.  Maybe Castiel was making a mistake.  Maybe Dean really
he looked ill.  A deep sigh and he shoved open the door to Dean’s shop, flinching under the bright, pleasant chime of the bell above.  Even the
And if he just repeated that to himself until he finally fell into a fitful sleep, that was his problem.
Sam snorted.  “You should look at a mirror when you say that.”  He grinned at Dean’s scowl.  “Want anything special?”
Castiel blinked.  So Dean had done something to the window?  He tilted his head, watching Dean curiously as the man walked them both over to the opening.  As Dean lowered his hand to the open pane, Castiel launched off, flapping his wings.  To
Cradling his injured hand, Alastair heaved for breath.  “What if he’s already dead?” he cackled.  His lips pulled back in a sneer.  “Couldn’t save the toy, could you?”
He scrambled from his car and jogged up the path, banging harshly on the front door.  It didn’t take long for it to open, Balthazar scowling at him from the entryway.  “Cassie,
Castiel could very well have done that but Dean was the one who had interrupted his evening; both with a poorly timed phone call and now with blood and whining.  He chuckled, the sound far from kind.  ”Dean, I can’t begin to imagine why you’d be so secretive.  Not as if you witnessed a murder or anything; you’re a simple thief.”
“Well, if you’re all right with it.”  The seat squeaked and Dean kissed him on the cheek.  “Get out of my car and get to work, Cas,” he grinned.  When Castiel complied, he added, “That deli on the corner.  Meet me there at noon.”  He didn’t wait for an answer but sped off, the Impala rumbling in the morning air.
how ridiculous you are immediately.  Fantastic.  He tried to smile but given the weird look the clerk gave him, it probably came off as more of a nervous tic.
He sipped his wine, offering up a word now and again, letting his family carry on.  And thought about Castiel.  Knowing that man, he’d have more than a few bits of advice for Sam and Jess.  Given his rather neat appearance, he could probably go toe-to-toe with Jess’ apparent consternation over a color scheme.  With a jolt, he realized Castiel would fit right in to this dynamic.
Castiel works with Dean which is why he's never said anything to his friend.  Plus, they work with other cops and cops can be stupidly hetero sometimes.  Still, doesn't change the fact he wants to see Castiel naked.  A lot.  In his bed.  Like . . . every night.
He looked up, glancing at Dean and then Castiel.  Taking in the sight of handcuffs, he set down his pen and leaned back.  “Shall I keep guessing or will you let me in on the fun?”
Clucking his tongue, Dean remarked, “Manners.”  He shifted, raising the gun, making a show of cocking it.  “If you’re talking about that bitch down in New Mexico, I’m not sorry.”
“Rude,” Crowley retorted.  His shoes clicked quietly on the smooth floors.  “I wasn’t all that pleased you’d dared to steal from me.  I
Humming, Dean slid his fingers in, cooing when Castiel whimpered.  “Gotta loosen you up, Cas.  You’re too tight.”  He shifted and crouched over Castiel, thrusting two fingers in slow and sure.  He kissed and nipped the nape of Castiel’s neck, his condom-wrapped dick bumping against Castiel’s balls as they moved.  “I wanna
-- had given up his life because of some dumbass hunter too damn stubborn to die.  So weak as it was, Dean tried all he could to show his thanks.  He hadn’t been — and
“C’mon, Dean.  You haven’t been the same since Michael.  You just . . . you’re kind of disappearing on me,” he muttered.
The years that followed Sam’s death and resurrection were no less painful.  He watched in Dean’s handwriting as the man became more withdrawn.  As he watched those he loved die.  The world itself breaking at the seams.  How he almost lost Sam a second time when they’d nearly closed the gates to Hell.
“That’s the intention,” he purred.  All his pent up anxiety surrounding Dean and the unanswered attraction between them had given him an insane boost of confidence.  Now, all he wanted to do was bury himself in Dean’s ass until the man came, screaming his name.  He tugged on Dean’s belt, loosening it quickly, yanking on the zipper as soon as did.  “I’m fucking you in this room.  Now.  I won’t wait.”
Heart flipping with equal parts joy and fear, Castiel nodded frantically.  “I am.  I’m here.  With you.  As long as you’ll have me.”  He whimpered when Dean latched onto his mouth again, the man’s strong hands reclaiming his ass in the process.  Oh,
this.  Wanted this so badly.  But it was only going to end.  He didn’t get men like Dean.  He was just
Dismayed, Castiel sighed.  “Dean, you have every right to be angry with me.  I would be, too, were I in your place.  But please, Dean.  I will do
Torn between following the command and demanding an answer, he swallowed and turned, facing the screen as Castiel massaged and caressed his skin.  He held himself stiffly, waiting for his cock to wake up and destroy everything.  Touch.  He was finally receiving touch from his Dom which would be the perfect time for his body to betray him.  Other than a stir or two, however, his dick remained blissfully quiet.
He blinked at that.  For a moment, he forgot he was talking to the drop-dead gorgeous owner of a bookstore and instead, just a man.  A man who
Dean works at a local news station alongside his co-anchor Pamela Barnes.  Completely professional.  Completely uninteresting.
Castiel paused and moved, sliding his hands warm and sure along Dean’s shoulders until he lay crouched over Dean.  “Not
He sighed, staring at his scruffy jaw and mussed hair in the bathroom mirror.  How in the hell had he managed to muck this up so badly?  If he’d just introduced himself like a normal person.  Just said who he was.  Instead, lie after lie after lie.  And now Dean was interested in him.  In a fraud.  He couldn’t keep this up.  Not at this stage.  Either he’d forget something or just let slip something that proved who he really was.
Shoving down his stupid, idiotic crush, he turned to both men, eyes narrow.  “We have a job to do, yes?  The sooner it’s over, the better.”  And for a brief second, he thought he saw Dean flinch but the man was grinning again, all confidence and brash ego.  Lovely.
Dean.  He wanted to prove to Dean that he didn’t need to hide, comfortable as it was.  That he could take control of his life, finally.  Taking a heavy breath, he pulled open his front door and locked it, trudging to his car.  Shaking and nervous, he couldn’t even stand the radio and suffered the drive to Dean’s shop in complete silence.
“Dude, it’s okay.  Not like you did it on purpose.”  He eyed Castiel with a smirk.  “Or is this a habit of yours, accosting people on the sidewalk with an umbrella?”
"Wrong again, Dean," Castiel began.  He shoved Dean toward the tube as the doors opened.  Pushing the younger man down onto one of the benches, he yawned.  Christ, he was tired.  And hungry, apparently, given the way his stomach started rumbling.  "It became
Finally extricated from his cable prison, Castiel looked again at Dean, clearly morose.  He gave Dean a brief, weak wave and began walking off, away from the set.
The man crooked a finger, beckoning Dean to sit up.  He followed, startled when Castiel held out his shirt.
He stared at his closed office door, stunned.  He knew Bobby didn’t care if he dated men but he’d not expected the absolute acceptance.  Blinking, he stepped outside, heading to the Impala in a daze.  As he sat behind the wheel, he realized this meant he’d have to tell Sam about Cas now.  Great.  That was going to be a
Castiel stared at the open door, wondering if he was still knocked out.  He slumped back against his pillow, frowning at the ceiling.  If he was headed back to America like Bobby claimed, he
“Because I was hoping you’d get his dumb ass to stop pulling this garbage.  Figured you’d be damn near as stubborn as he is.”  He snorted.  “No surprise the idjit gets himself tangled in this shit.”
Still kissing him, whimpering as he shifted minutely against the man’s stomach, Castiel fumbled blindly for the nightstand, yanking open the drawer there.  He managed to find lube quickly, and rolled them both, startling Dean in the process.  The man stared up at him, almost frightened as Castiel poured the thick liquid into his hand and slicked his cock.
Dean had been wearing his shit-eating grin since getting off the phone with Castiel.  James.  No, Castiel fit the man better.  Dean liked it a hell of a lot more, anyway.  Planting that name firmly in his head in regards to the shy, dark-haired man, he sat back in his booth seat, sipping on his beer.
“So, dart or not,” he explained, scraping the last of the sauce from his plate, “seems this ain’t too bad a town to retire to.”
“Uh, no?”  He took a step away from Castiel.  “I, uh, keep tabs on all you guys.  Need to … um … stay a step ahead?”
It didn’t take a genius to realize Dean feared intimacy.  He’d mentioned being ‘shit’ at such things before.  He’d had a long-term relationship in the past so it was clear he
Their conversation turned lighter, thankfully skirting family entirely for the sake of current events and the banalities of modern entertainment.  Plates clean, Dean sat back with a sated sigh, quirking an eyebrow when Castiel stood and headed to the kitchen, leaving his dirty plate behind.  Dean almost called out to him when the man returned, a thick wedge of cake on a small plate in his hand.
Flopping back on the bed, still half-awake but now curled like a cat around Castiel’s pillow, he murmured, “Floor’s hard.  ’swarm up here.”  He shifted, sighing.  ”Smells good, too.”
He could hear the pained sincerity in Castiel’s voice.  It wasn’t that he wanted Castiel to choose him or his father.  Just not cast him aside.  Act like he was just a

a fairy.  As long as Dean did nothing to harm him or the people he cared about, what did it matter that he was a hunter?  It was clear he wasn’t now.  Perhaps that was what he’d left behind that had left him so low.
In the brief second following Charlie’s departure, Dean entertained the idea that Castiel actually saw something in him.  He knew Kevin since he always worked at Sam’s law firm.  The kid didn’t know how to lie.  But the idea that
“You . . . you’re not upset?” he ventured.  He whimpered when Dean took the mug from his hands.  Without anything to distract him, he folded his arms awkwardly, staring downward.
would contact Castiel.  And once again, completely unlike Michael, Castiel had listened.  Guilt weighed down in his chest and Dean rubbed his nose.
Bobby shoved him toward the door.  “Well?  Get your ass movin’, boy.  I’ll close up tonight.  I don’t want to see you until tomorrow.”  He whistled as he went into Dean’s office, effectively ending the conversation.
The file sat heavy on his stomach and Castiel just sighed, nodding.  “Okay.  Let’s get it over with.”
Pushing at Castiel’s thighs, he grunted, “Hold ‘em up.  Might not be able to go slow, though,” he admitted, his voice thick with lust.  He slicked up his cock as Castiel pulled his legs back, body trembling.  With his other hand, Dean grabbed a pillow and stuffed it under Castiel’s hips, lifting him higher.
So, it was somewhat understandable that he never noticed his gun leaving its holster and barely heard Benny’s shout of alarm before something hard and heavy hit the back of his head.
Swatting at the man’s hands, Castiel coupled it with a quick swat to the back of Dean’s head.  Before he could respond, Balthazar clucked his tongue.
That it was all pretense.  Meant to look innocent and secretly, they were desperate lovers, unwilling to keep their hands to themselves.  Like some old, 80s, soft-core porn flick.  He’d have been embarrassed if anyone knew but luckily, he managed to keep his infatuation to himself.  Other than Gabriel’s knowing looks and eye rolls.
Balthazar grinned.  “Of course not.  Be an adult, Cassie; go to the store, meet the owner and then do the signing.”
Those eyes should have been classified as dangerous weapons.  “Castiel Novak,” he rasped, entranced by their brightness.  So warm and kind.  Even though Castiel had injured him, the man
"Wha?"  Shit, maybe going to Balthazar was the wrong idea.  He felt his stomach twist.  "What have you done, Balthazar?"
Holding out his hand, Dean muttered, “Stand here.”  When Castiel only looked at his palm in confusion, Dean waved it.  “Feet.  Down.  On.  Hand.”  He smirked.  “Twit.”
Castiel waited the better part of an hour before creeping out of his hiding place.  He was streaked in dirt and shook violently, loosening the worst from his skin and wings.  Taking a chance, he fluttered up to the window, but like before, it remained locked tight.  Though the rain-streaked glass, he could make out Dean pouring himself a drink and throwing it back.
his sex life was relegated to pages in a book.  Standing before him was a gorgeous brunet with dark-framed glasses, a white button-up under a charcoal waistcoat and – good
Fiddling again with the speaker box, Dean tried to process what he’d realized.  It wasn’t like he didn’t
The clerk raised his eyebrows at Castiel’s continued silence.  “Um, need help with something?”  He smiled warmly.  “Or do I get to add you in as décor?”
“What can you do against fire, hunter?  Huh?!”  He grinned.  “I hear you’re the devil himself.  Would it leave you right at home to lock you in and torch the place?”
Castiel sat on the edge of the end table, cradling his thimble cup, legs folded.  Truthfully, fairies could get sick but it wasn’t
The sincerity in the apology sent shivers of relief and dread down Dean’s skin.  In that moment, he wanted to vault over the desk and pull Castiel into his arms.  Kiss him.  Touch him.  Let him know it was fine and they could go back to how they were.  Dean would take his commands and it would all be unchanged.  So he gripped the arms of the chair he sat in, willing himself to remain still.  “Cas, you said you wanted honesty, right?”  At the man’s nod, he went on.  “Then you should have told me about him.  It wasn’t like you could hide him forever.”
“Running to the store for microwaved pizza doesn’t count, love.”  He patted him again and returned to his seat across the table.  “I think you should do it.”
The door creaked open and Castiel poked his head in.  “Hello, Dean,” he murmured, slipping all the way in and shutting the door behind him.  He shrugged off his coat, folding it over one arm.
knew he had a . . . whatever Castiel was.  Boyfriend?  Friend with benefits?  He shrugged.  “I, um, appointment,” he blurted.
hot."  He peers at the man.  Something familiar.  Maybe?  Eh, everything's all fuzzy and weird.  Just as long as it's not Sam.  If it's Sam, Dean's going to become a priest in the morning.
“Sorry?  What fo—“ he lost the words when Dean pulled him into a kiss, his arm a warm, iron band against Castiel’s back.  His eyes shut almost immediately and he whimpered, returning the embrace, his free hand tangling in the collar of Dean’s shirt.
Meeting Castiel’s eyes, he moved again, unhooking buttons and sliding Castiel’s shirt free.  With a wink, he stripped the undershirt off just as fast.  To Castiel’s utter surprise, he knelt, pressing his mouth in near reverence against his midsection, moving slow but sure until he came to Castiel’s belly button.  Winking again, Dean licked the indentation and moved his hands up Castiel’s thighs, squeezing once.
want to leave, I’m not letting go of you.  Ever.”  He leaned in, kissing Castiel with soft, gentle lips.  “I told you before:  I don’t care how we got here.  I’m just glad we did.”  He stroked his thumb along the edge of Castiel’s jaw.  “I know that you lied.  I also know
Castiel swallowed.  “Er, I . . . um, sorry.  I was distracted, I suppose.”  He rubbed the back of his neck nervously, gaze flickering to Dean warily.  Once more, his deep-seated nature trilled in his gut, delighted at Dean’s nearness.  It was more than the virility the man exemplified.  Fairies were attracted to power and strength.  But there was a kindness beneath all of that essence that called to Castiel.  And, frankly, he wasn’t blind.  Dean was an extremely attractive man.
Castiel held up his hands.  “Please?  At the signing?”  Just a bit of time.  He had to be ready.  Just . . . a few days would do it.  It would only be until Monday.  Just a few days.
to say them left an impression on Dean.  After four weeks, he felt he knew Castiel fairly well.  The man was quirky but genuine.  He didn’t think Castiel did it to placate Dean.  By now, he almost believed Castiel did it because he
“Pushy little shit, aren’t you?”  He crouched down, bringing himself eye level to Castiel.  “Ain’t much to tell.  I’m . . . retired.  Okay?  If this used to be your stomping grounds, tough shit.  They’re mine now.”
Castiel hadn’t moved, still sat forward, his hands clasped loosely together.  “As a Dom, he should have listened to you.  A Dom is nothing without his sub.  And frankly, if he did only what
Why on earth had he fallen for his roommate?  Yes, Dean was gorgeous.  Yes, Dean was hot.  But he was also kind and smart and entertaining.  Quite possibly the best friend that Castiel had ever had.  Truly the only reason he’d never admitted his attraction to the man.  Why jeopardize a good thing?
The warmth of Dean’s laughter made him forget the storm around them.  And given the result, he gave serious consideration to having his umbrella bronzed and hung in the hallway.
Castiel waited until Dean was out of earshot before whimpering and covering his face with his hands.  What had he just done?  His house was a mess.  And he was bound to say something stupid or incriminating.  He curled his hand into a fist and pressed the edge of it to his forehead, wondering if he carried any kind of time travel ability.
Castiel turned back, peering at Dean.  ”What?” he asked.  Given the state of his day, the last thing he needed was a sexy jock-head taunting him about something.  Not that he thought of Dean as a jock-head.  The two classes he’d had with Dean — English-centric — proved the young man was anything but dumb.  But Castiel just … God, his day needed to end
Castiel whined under his breath, tempted to refuse.  He couldn’t face Dean again.  Could he?  He’d been so foolish.  But . . . Dean
Warning signals screamed in his head that this was wrong, that he shouldn’t do this, but Dean’s stubborn nature got the better of him.  Why listen to the voice that said this was good?  That slow was
He considered calling down to the front desk for items but knew if he did, it’d raise more than eyebrows.  He sighed and dug through his bag, pulling out two pair of handcuffs.  He locked one set another Dean’s wrists and the other around the chain in the middle.  That one, he set against the bed’s post.
Castiel glanced around, surprised at the lowered sun.  “Oh.  Yes, certainly.”  He scrambled from his dig site, clutching the new vase.  “I’ll hand this off to Gabriel.”  He looked around the site, wondering what else they might find.  So far, the majority had been old, pitted weapons, coins, and the occasional pottery shard.  This was the first whole item they’d found.  It would be a stunning centerpiece for the museum.
Second: his lab times had changed and now his once light-and-easy Friday had turned into hell with classes starting at eight in the morning and not ending until five.
Castiel frowned and stood, taking Dean’s wine glass and setting both on the coffee table.  “Dean, can I try something?”
Dean complied, finding warm, stunning blue.  Castiel kept his hand in place, his other still moving against Dean’s neck.  “I don’t wish to hurt you.  We will move slowly but it will be no less pleasurable for you, I promise.”  He took a small breath, plush lips parted.  “I want you to be
with Castiel?  A wheezing whimper escaped before he could stop it and he coughed harshly, hoping to hide the noise.  “Um . . . all right,” he breathed.  “I, um, I’m free tomorrow?”
“Oh!”  Dean blushed and shut the door, sliding past Castiel toward the house’s interior.  “Uh, this is my place,” he murmured.  Thankfully, due to he and Castiel being apart for a week, the place remained tidy.  Not that Dean was a slob but at least nothing looked too much like a bachelor lived there.
He didn’t get much farther before he was pushed against a wall and Dean’s lips met his.  He returned the kiss eagerly, before reality stepped in again.  He shoved against Dean’s chest, breaking them apart.  “You don’t want me,” he managed, his voice rough.  “You don’t even know me.”
Dean watched him from the corner of his eye, not replying.  Most of the spirits they dealt with had attachment issues.  Whatever name they went by, they couldn’t leave.
It was official.  Castiel had been born cursed.  It was the only explanation he had for the shit storm that had been his day.
He shook his head and headed out of his office after Charlie.  What a dumb idea.  Castiel was . . . gorgeous, smart, educated, and refined.  The last thing he’d want was Dean tagging around him the rest of his life.  No, he was a project.  Castiel was just a nice guy and doing Dean a favor.  There wasn’t anything else there.
Castiel took a breath, wiping away tears from his cheeks.  He set the car into drive, hurtling back up Dean’s road.  He had been wrong to run.  Frightened, but wrong.  Dean wasn’t this monster the supernatural community spoke of.  He was a man like any other.  He’d been wounded and abandoned too often in his life.  And Castiel would
He could light a cigarette with his face in that moment.  ”D-dean,” he hissed.  ”Enough of that.”  He swallowed, trying to calm himself.  ”I ask again:  Turn yourself in.  It won’t take long for Crowley to find out who stole from him.”
“You gonna join me or what, Cas?”  He grinned and pointed to the lunch.   “I only get this because it’s your favorite.  Gotta admit; it’s grown on me.”
“Well, damn, Cas; just another reason to show up, huh?”  He winked and raised a hand in goodbye.  “Later, Cas.”  The bell above the door jingled merrily as Dean pushed his way back outside into the cold, wet, January day.
Grabbing his phone, he bolted from the room, sprinting down the hall to the elevator.  He jammed a finger against the
had been a lie.  He might just end up walking in on some bored sixty-year-old with a hobby and scaring the shit out of him.
Rather than call him out on it, Castiel lifted his chin, one eyebrow raised.  After another second, he stood, mouth a thin line.  “All right,” he said, nodding once.  He slipped on his coat and flicked the collar up.  “One dick cake, coming up.”  He turned on his heel, leaving Dean’s office.
Still lost in the bliss of Dean’s touch, Castiel reached up to stroke the man’s jaw.  “I was very much a willing participant,” he pointed out.
“Enough!” he growled.  He sat up, forcing Dean to fall back on his heels.  Annoyed and aroused, he grabbed Dean by the shirt front and shook him.  “I am no coward.  I am no weakling.”  His fairy self churned and flared inside him.  The things this man did to him.  To have Dean leave him now might very well destroy him.  While he struggled to calm his volatile senses, he smirked, remembering an old legend.  “Besides, I might have a leg up, thanks to you.  It is said, that when fairies bond, our magic is strengthened.  That our . . . beloved unlocks hidden reserves.”
“Good, neither do I.”  Castiel dropped his hand then and clasped his own together.  “Now.  What shall we have for lunch, hm?”  He glanced around Dean’s kitchen.  “I’m afraid you’ll have to instruct me.”
Castiel’s fingers slowed.  “Did he now?” he asked, his voice toneless.  Dean tensed waiting for the agreement and was started when he felt plush, wet lips on his skin.  His head snapped around and he stared, confused, as Castiel mouthed the marks gently, kissing them softly.
Confused, Dean leaned back and made a small noise of assent.  He shifted again, licking his lips.  “I should have asked last night.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to –“
Not that Dean had cared.  He’d been a bit too focused on the newest addition.  He’d learned that Castiel had graduated top of his class from Harvard.  Passed the bar almost immediately before moving out the Kansas to take a position with a now defunct firm.  He’d come to Sam’s firm with the path of making partner in another year or so.
Spent and mind swirling, Castiel yawned and nuzzled Dean’s chest, only catching on to the act when Dean himself chuckled.  He blushed, head shooting up.  “Oh, s-sorry,” he murmured.  He only hoped Dean wouldn’t realize it a sign of how deeply and quickly Castiel had fallen for the man.  Pathetic, really.  He’d keep that hidden for as long as --
Castiel turned, staring at Dean.  ”How do you know him?”  Castiel was certain he’d mentioned Assistant Director Singer around Dean but he’d never used the man’s given name.  In fact, if he had, he’d have used the more formal ‘Robert’ rather than the tone of familiarity that Dean used.
Smitten.  One hundred percent smitten with one Dean Jefferson.  The pleasure soured some as he recalled his antics as a fairy.  And the assumptions of Dean being a hunter.  He swallowed, chewing on the side of his thumb.
Gabriel made a weird noise halfway between a choke and a whimper before he turned abruptly in his chair and snatched back his credit card from the recently-returned waiter.  “

ago.  He’d only caught sight of Dean as he’d bolted from an art museum.  Even then, the man had taunted him.  Saluted him and jumped over a hedge.  “That so?” he murmured, moving his fingers again.
Rather than protest, Dean nodded.  He gave Castiel one more look before padding away into the adjoining bathroom.  The door clicked closed and in a few seconds, water began running.
The silence that met his comment had him worried that Dean had hung up until he heard a deep sigh over the phone.  ”
Fingers clenched in dirt, he opened his eyes slowly when it fell silent.  The werewolf’s chest heaved violently as he stood in front of Dean.  The man himself had barely moved, still held the gun up.  But even from a distance, Castiel could sense a change in the air.
Dean stared at the man, a million thoughts cluttering his head.  He’d made the request because he’d been pissed.  Asked for something stupid because he knew there’d be no way Castiel would do it.  A waste of time.  A dumb idea.  And yet, Castiel had
Dean sighed dramatically and straightened up, folding his arms across his chest.  ”Guess that means you’d better learn how to make soup, Cas.”
Dean grinned and dropped his hand.  His jaw still throbbed like a bastard but he had an inkling what was going on.  “Cas,” he chimed, “did you
”  He huffed loudly, spitting out water.  “I am not without abilities.  I, too, made enemies, Dean.”  He let go of the man then, gesturing to the woods around them.  “The fairies.  Others will know the mark that’s on me.  If any other fairy were to meet me, they would read my aura and see that my king wants me dead.”
Castiel grinned, wiping his face a second time and kissing Dean hard.  Beautiful, stupid, arrogant Dean was alive and safe.  He didn’t give a damn how the rest of the day went; his Dean was safe.  With a sigh, he straightened up as best he could, the blade in his side leaving a void of numbness along his left.
Well, there it was.  Dean nodded once and pushed up from his chair, not meeting Castiel’s eyes.  Michael was right.  He was
Smiling, Castiel nodded.  “I think you should listen to your sisters, Sydney.”  He looked at his oven, noting the time for the lasagna was almost complete.  “Please, go speak to them.  And if you’d like, come into the store tomorrow.  I’ll have some of those turnovers you like.”
Back at his room, Dean still slept and he breathed a sigh of relief.  Then got to work, clipping away Dean’s ruined shirt and exposing the wounds.  He worked for nearly a half hour, cleaning the wound, careful to keep the bloody water from dripping onto the bed.  As he began covering the lesser of the two wounds, he jumped at the whine of pain.
Face still red, he pursed his lips, brow furrowed.  “And you are nowhere near as charming as you may think.”
Castiel frowned.  He stood, crumpling his coffee cup and chucking it into the bin near Balthazar’s desk.  ”I’m going to contact my assistant director; I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
of his bedroom!”  He groaned.  “Oh, my God,” he mumbled into his hands, almost too quiet to hear, “someone staple my mouth shut.”
Castiel sighed, sitting back.  ”Fuck my life,” he muttered.  At Dean’s confused look, he waved his free hand.
He shuddered at Castiel’s dark chuckle.  “And then there is your body itself.  You are fit and firm.  Tall, well-built.”  Castiel shifted, his lips skidding down Dean’s bared spine.  “Skin like silk,” he stated.  He breathed out, slow and sure.  “
He winced but nodded.  “Just . . . if you . . . have faith in me, Dean . . . give me this?”  He met the man’s green eyes, waiting for the refusal.
Castiel held his breath, nibbling his bottom lip at the sweet touch.  He didn’t know why Sydney feared Dean so much.  A cruel hunter could never touch another being so kindly and thoughtfully.  He’d known Dean for little over a month but he felt safest at that moment.  He leaned in, pressing a kiss to Dean bowed head, scenting his woodsy shampoo.  “Dean?” he whispered.  “Are you certain you’re all right?”
“Because you asked me to,” Castiel answered, sincere and direct.  He came around the counter, careful to stay out of arm’s length of Dean regardless.  “What I did to you was . . . I wish I could take it all back.  Pretend it never happened.  Slam the door in my father’s face.  Any number of things I wish I’d done rather than send you away.”  He leaned against the counter, fingers white as he gripped the edge.  “And I will bake you a thousand cakes, if it means you’ll forgive me this.”  He snorted faintly.  “Please don’t ask for anymore marzipan dicks, however.”
Brow furrowed, he asked, “Would you prefer a word that will let you know when our scene is done?”  He pressed a hand to Dean’s chest.  “Something that will help you transition?”
while we deal with the thugs that Benny has so conveniently taken care of with accidental gas cans.”
So, Castiel didn’t want to hear about Dean’s supposed partner?  Most people wanted to avoid such information if they themselves were interested.  Dean flicked his gaze to the camera and then back to Castiel as he passed off his equipment to his assistant, Charlie.
He almost threw it across the room as though it had turned into a poisonous snake.  Instead, he opened his hand and it thumped to the floor, sliding under his desk.  He arched his neck back, fingers digging into the arms of his chair.  Still hard.  Still fucking hard from
?” he whispered.  His thumbs stroked Dean’s too-hot skin and Castiel’s lips burned like a brand on his neck.  “To be scientific,” he began, breath a puff of warmth, “you have what is often known as the
Not hiding the scowl this time, Dean snorted.  “Uh, doubt you’d get much of a book out of me, James.  Bookstore owners are kind of boring.”  He looked at Gabriel and found the other man covering his face with both hands, almost prone on the table.  Taking pity, Dean patted him on the back, feeling him tense.  His head snapped up and he flailed, almost tipping his chair over in the process.  Wide-eyed, he stared at Dean, mouth opening and closing like a fish.
Castiel shivered, kissing back.  He could taste cinnamon and apple on Dean’s mouth.  Felt his lust burn hot once again as he raised his arms slowly, shifting them around Dean’s neck.  He wanted him.  Badly.  Wanted the ferocity that came with sex and naked play.  But this?  This was . . . different.  This was sweet and warm and gentle.  And he wanted it to last forever as he felt Dean’s heart beat against his own.
Dean shivered at the idea, scratching at his wrists.  It might be a way to go but Dean wasn’t all that keen on it.  No, a sub was supposed to take direction.  He wasn’t supposed to initiate
to be accepted again.  I was always different.  I knew that.  To be what they wanted, I would have to deny my nature.”  He held out his arms.  “I am happy
either.  It was just . . . if Castiel didn’t take charge, how would Dean know how not to anger him?  How to keep him
Guts twisting, Castiel almost fled.  The downside of a fairy’s heightened senses was also their rather rash behavior at times.  Though it took effort, he held himself still, adrenaline surging through his legs, leaving them shaking.  No, he couldn’t.  He
Dean fell silent as soon as they pulled in though, gaze averted and foot tapping nervously.  Castiel felt a bit of pity toward Dean.  But, frankly, he had to keep up the idea that this was a ruse on his part.  He needed Dean to react as though actually being arrested.  If they went in calm, Balthazar would immediately be on edge.
With a flinch, Castiel yanked his arms back, nearly side-swiping the man a second time.  He wasn’t certain if he should be thankful or further humiliated that the man guessed the movements and ducked in time.  Humiliated and wishing lightning would strike him, he hid under the umbrella, shouting out, “I’m so sorry!”
He found himself distracted, however, when he recognized a flash of disappointment in Castiel’s eyes.  The man smiled again, sadder this time, no longer toying with his equipment.
Pleasantly unsettled, it took Castiel a bit longer to get back into his normal state of mind.  Mrs. Davis came in for some flower pots and had to remind him – twice – to add in a bag of fertilizer.  And when the weekly delivery arrived, he managed to forget how to undo the lock in the backroom.
“Easy, Cas.  Just gonna lock the front door and switch off the lights.”  He did exactly that, flipping his
Gesturing with a pointed finger, Dean teased, “That’s why you’re so hoity-toity with your words.  You’re a nerd!”
with just touch kept sex so far out of reach.  Castiel had mentioned he liked subs with attitude so if Dean just . . . gave up in his demands, would that mean it wouldn’t move beyond that?  They still kissed, occasionally, just not anything that would get Dean’s balls tight.  Castiel kept everything above the belt.  The man simply wouldn’t follow through.
Pulling Dean to his feet, Castiel kissed him again, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck as he did.  He stepped back, sighing.  “Dean, I –“
“If it’s so ‘very easy,’ why don’t you do it?”  Balthazar smirked at him, picking up his mug again.  “Just signing some books, remember?”
in bed.  Like . . ." he trails off, blinking deliberately.  He jolts and finishes his thought, "Like . . . scary good."  He grins, or thinks he does.  "You should try it."
Castiel made a high-pitched noise before letting his head fall forward.  How was he to explain the issue without
The latter was an accurate fear.  Castiel shoved it aside, however.  ”You told me yourself that Alastair has broken you out in the past.  Including when I arrested you.”  Dean blushed but nodded.  ”We merely need to show you being transferred to the station near Crowley’s compound.  He’s bound to have ears in the area and he’ll know you’ve been nabbed.”
“And I thought it’d be a problem to work with him every day but really, it’s the best part of my day to see him on the other side of the sound booth.”
Not that it made Dean feel any better.  In fact, most nights after their dates, he went home stressed and confused, waiting for the ball to drop.  Why did Castiel keep prolonging things?  Why wouldn’t he just take Dean home and fuck him already?  His dreams in the last few days had been raw and visceral; Castiel taking him any number of ways, using Dean.  Even humiliating him; something he’d always hated.
Dean snickered.  “I’ll take that as a ‘yes,’ then.”  He moved away but halted when Castiel gripped the back of Dean’s shirt, making a small noise of protest as he did.  Dean laughed in full as he untangled Castiel’s hand.
“His . . . oh.”  Castiel nodded, looking oddly crestfallen.  “Yes, I suppose you’re correct.”  He looked away when a waitress arrived and ordered a gin and tonic in a quiet voice.  “He . . . will enjoy the theatrics, I’m sure.”
A slight frown creased his forehead.  Lifting a hand to rub his neck, he looked away.  “My other . . . companions were never in my home,” he admitted.
Throwing his head back again, he shut his eyes and began stroking himself, hips bucking up slightly with each pass.  The lube was cold and his hand too tight but he kept pulling, feeling that lovely thrill start swirling in his spine.  Biting his lip, he called up an image of his torture, all tousled dark hair and bright eyes.
Reciting a quick spell, Castiel healed the wound and patted Sydney on the head.  “No harm, Sydney.  But I think you should go home and rest.  And I promise you; Dean is not here to hurt anyone.  I will make sure of it.”
lie to me.  I will not be insulted in that manner.”  His fingers trembled as he watched Dean’s cheek bloom red, the man touching the skin tenderly, eyes wide in surprise.  “I know what you felt, Dean.  Don’t
Unperturbed, Castiel grabbed his hand, lacing in fingers in Dean’s, though the man tried vainly to prevent it.  “I know what happened to you, Dean.  I’m sorry for running.”  Dean looked so young under the rain’s constant fall.  His hair flattened, his skin ruddy from alcohol.  Looked nothing like the horrors that had been visited on him.  All the grief that must lie in his blood.  “I admit, that name is frightening to my kind.  But as I said before;
Dean shook his head violently, hand clenching and unclenching as he moved.  “No, no!  It isn’t you!  I know it’s me!  But I swear, I’m good.  I promise.  I’ll do whatever you want.”  Dean’s head spun and he felt seconds from hyperventilating.  But he had to push this.  He had to find out why it was Castiel simply wouldn’t fuck him.  Use him like he was supposed to be used.
He took a deep breath and drummed his nails on the desk.  “Normally, I’d agree right now.  Draw up a contract, whatever you require.  But Dean, I have a feeling that may not be a wise choice for you.  I don’t wish you to enter into another agreement with a Dom if you only feel you’re
Benny – or the man he assumed to be, Benny – just chuckled and nodded.  “No worries there, brother.”  His eyes lifted.  “Canister’s gone off and if Bal’s prepared, he’ll be the only one standing.”
A flash and the man was now in the passenger seat, still scowling.  Castiel yelped and pressed against the door though the stranger remained staring resolutely out the window, jaw clenched.

“When you kept ignoring me,” Balthazar replied.  He leaned over Castiel, reading the email.  He smirked.  “Seems Gabe and I are of the same mind.  I think this is just what you need, Cassie.”  Balthazar squeezed Castiel’s shoulder.  “Get you out of the house, for one thing.”
Castiel squirmed under the attention, panting as his cock throbbed.  He’d expected driving lust from Dean.  Maybe even rough, quick sex.  But not this.  Not these sweet, tender caresses.  Dean seemed in no hurry to end things as his mouth moved in slow, careful passes along his trembling skin.  He could feel silent words on Dean’s lips, too dizzy to strain to hear the heady whispers.  One word cut through his haze.  A rasping
But … this whole … he’d called saying he was drunk.  That he needed a ride.  Face screwed up, squinting, Castiel asked, “You aren’t drunk?”
“All right, Dr. Phil,” he snapped, angrily returning to his burger.  He didn’t like this conversation.  It needed to
“Does it matter?” he remarked.  “You’re helping me get there; after that, you don’t really need to worry, right?”
“Good,” Castiel growled, grabbing Dean by his shirtfront and yanking him into a harsh, savage kiss.  Lips barely brushing Dean’s, he rasped, “I’d hate to have shirked my meetings today on a game.”
