"No, stay." John budged over and patted the small area of mattress next to him, yawning. "I'm awake now. You made sure of that."
"It's fine. I'm pretty much completely put off alcohol for a while now, though." Sherlock said. They stepped onto the carriage and it set off, rattling and shaking on the uneven path.
The bed is hot and stuffy with the temperature of the two bodies, and John is sometimes woken up by an elbow nudging against his skin or the weight of a limb on his stomach or the tickle of curls against his nose, but each time he wakes up, he smiles and settles down to sleep with one thought in his head.
I want us to be the type of siblings who can just talk about these things. Not the kind who will phone each other out of obligation once a month when we go our separate ways to uni.”
The corner of Mycroft's lips twitched, a false glimmer of lightness. "Okay. Try and eat today, Sherlock. You need your strength."
A soldier entered - Bill Murray, also a nurse, not the actor. John tried to smile weakly at him - he liked him, he'd go out for drinks with this one - and Bill returned it with an easy grin, but one that was full of relief.
“I’m talking to you right now, aren’t I? I could have hardly been run over and am now comatose in hospital - “
The cab ride back to Baker Street was spent in silence, the air claustrophobic,  Sherlock staring straight ahead with his knee jogging up and down. John tried to reach for the right words to say to comfort him. Sherlock may have prefered to pretend otherwise, but John knew that cases involving children tended to strike a nerve with him, making him work harder and faster to solve them, use softer voices when talking to them. It was always heart-wrenching to watch.
His eyes flicker for a couple more seconds, then he takes a breath and starts. "Your watch is your fathers' and he gave it to you as a gift on your sixteenth birthday. You've not been wearing your sling for the past three days, even though your doctors have told you to wait a week before taking it off. You didn't have any breakfast this morning and you got around...five hours of sleep, suggesting you were nervous about this meeting. Or something. This is the sixth outfit you tried on this morning. Your sister teased you mercilessly for it and your mother was fussing over you like a child, possibly crying. You were worried that either you got the details wrong or I had decided not to come - preposterous either way, the train was late and you know it. So now that I have arrived, and whatever nerves you were having has calmed down slightly, you need breakfast. Or brunch, rather, at this time of day. So, John, where do you suggest we go?"
John sighs. He reached for the memory stick that he keeps in his pocket at all times, turns it around in his hand contemplatively as he does dozens of times a day. "Should we give this to Mycroft?"
They quickly shuffled themselves into a line, single-file, while John finally turned to look at Sherlock, who was smirking proudly. John shrugged modestly and grinned back, feeling the slight, addictive buzz of adrenaline that always came with pulling rank.
No night shift at the twenty-four-hour coffee shop - which no one needed and no one asked for - is ever the same, but even this part of John's life becomes formulaic after a couple of months.
Not to mention the small, everyday things: seeing Sherlock curled up on the sofa sleeping, his curls falling in front of his face, or accidentally walking in on him coming out of the shower in the shared bathroom, or when Sherlock would get up each morning, yawning and scratching the back of his head, undeniably human.
Sherlock makes an unexpected turn left, while the suspect runs straight ahead into a separate street. John’s gut instinct is to obviously follow the suspect, but he trusts Sherlock. He follows him as they hurry down hidden alleyways, up and down fire escapes, even jumping across roofs before making their way back down to the ground, just like old times. Sherlock soon skids to a halt and drags John by his sleeve into a hidden crevice, pressed close against him as they wait, their chests heaving with exertion.
The cab stops and they quickly jump out. Before they enter the door to the Diogenes Club, Sherlock pauses and says, averting his eyes to the pavement, “by the way, John. I think, with you moved back in and Rosie there, Baker Street will feel more like home than it has done in months.”
Redbeard is having the time of his life. He barks excitedly at passing cars, at wandering pigeons, at fellow canines who sniff at him out of curiosity, then detect something other-worldly about his presence and immediately scarper away, back to their owners. Redbeard, ever loyal never once leaves Sherlock’s side.
"And you'd rather not tell your hypothetical grandchildren that you first met your soulmate at a dog funeral when he was in tears the whole time."
"All in good time, Sherlock. I've barely woken up, and I can't be bothered to find him with all these people around. But I'm sure you'll love him. He's gay. And you have a thing for the strong, natural leader types, right?"
"But luckily, my parents are out of the villa today, most likely looking around the nearby town for souvenirs or wine."
John didn't really pay attention to the conversation between Mcgonagall and the Durmstrangs' headmaster, or the walk back to the castle (he tripped over multiple times, affection his plan to not draw attention to himself). When they got to the Great Hall, John noticed that the decorations had changed; the flags normally displaying Hogwarts' symbol, each either displayed the Durmstrang, Beuxbatons' or Hogwarts' symbol. There was an extra table added for the guests, which completely threw everyone off as they stood around awkwardly, waiting to be told where to sit. Luckily, Mcgonagall said that houses and guests were allowed to mix, and the hall descended into mild anarchy as students hunted their friends down and dragged them to a table. John, as per norm, sat with Sherlock, Greg, Mycroft and Molly at the front. Once everyone had sat down, the food appeared and everyone started eating ravenously (save Mycroft, who had been on a semi-permanent diet for the past two years, and Sherlock, whom John assumed gained his nutrition off the air and sarcasm). The sight of food appearing out of nowhere was familiar to the Hogwarts students, who saw this happen at least once a year (John actually still got a thrill from the sight, what with growing up in a muggle family his whole life), but the Beuxbatons and Durmstrang students gasped in delight, to which the Holmes' brothers chuckled at. John looked for Mary and found her sitting in the middle of the bench, talking to a brunette girl and smiling excitedly. John remembered liking her smile; the bright excited grin and slightly cruel smirk when she made a joke or John did something for her to laugh at. Even only a few days after their meeting, it seemed familiar, like an old friend...
"What, you've never met a hypocrite before?" John said. Then he saw the bored look on Sherlock's face, and ate a spoonful of cereal. "Happy?"
"Avoiding the question, Holmes?" A female voice said from behind. They turned around. "I wonder why?"
"I am perfectly happy dealing with those 'needs' alone, as you so eloquently put it. It's your move, John."
"Well, I guess we'd better not take his word for other things too." Mr Watson finally looks up at the TV, making eye contact with Sherlock. "He says you're clever."
“You were hoping for a bit more action, right? Something more like what Adams and Egorov and Moran do?”
Sherlock gestures at John to take a seat. He would be ashamed of how quickly he sat down to listen to the detective talk further without caring about professionalism if he gave a damn about his job at all. The detective smiles approvingly. "Very good." The patronising tone of voice makes John almost roll his eyes. "So, as you may have seen from reading my notebook, I'm a consulting detective. It is my job to see the obvious that the police tend to miss, and so I observe more about other people that others tend to miss. Like how the than that doesn't go above your wrist, your military haircut, and your stature indicates you were in the army."
The man lunges with his knife towards Sherlock with a snarl, and John reacts on instinct. He grabs his wrist, bending it behind him, causing him to cry out in pain, then pins him to the ground, tossing the knife to the side.
John hummed in acknowledgement, and picked up and read the cards one at a time. The first was Molly, in a card she had made herself decorated with moving pictures of broomsticks and snitches, with the usual "get well soon!" and two kisses after her name. John smiled softly and put the card down, mentally making a note to compliment her on her art skills. The next was signed by the entire quidditch team, with a rude limerick from the team's seeker Bill and an awful pun about being stabbed from the chaser Georgia, who had no self-restraint, but John was used to that by now.
The day went by without event: a lunch, the quidditch team visiting, Molly returning, Wizard Chess. John quickly lost interest in anything but sleeping.
Nowadays he felt nothing but old, as he watched army mates get married and walked around with his cane and saw the world turn and turn as he stood rooted to the ground.
"Poor loves. I can't imagine what it's like being so distant from one another." John smiles hopefully, but the lady shakes her head. "I'm sorry, but I have to be firm with you. Maybe you could book for tomorrow?"
Sherlock shrugs. "It's fine." Then his eyes widen, and a grin forms on his face. "Although...I think I have an idea on how to watch it. For free."
"Vell, ve all know vhat happened last time Hogvarts hosted." His voice was sickly and slippery and his cold hard mouth seemed stuck in a permanent smirk. "Sixteen years ago. I vas a young teacher at ze time, barely began my career. I remember reading about it, hearing people's accounts of it; You-Know-Who's return, ze death of a student - your own champion, may I add... I hope you have been spending at least half of your budget and time on security as you have on... Decorations."
"Well you're hardly in enough control of your emotional faculties to be giving yourself advice. Look at you: you haven't stopped crying since I got here."
John grunted as he heaved Sherlock up the stairs and Sherlock made no effort to help himself. John attempted to get Sherlock to concentrate a little more on walking, but Sherlock continued his rambling, the subject having changed from alcohol to the importance of bees. Thankfully, they eventually reached the common room's door, with the eagle carved into the knocker.
But there’s been a couple of uplifting things to mention. Exams have been going well. It’s nice to know that everyone else did so much worse than me in most exams, and I’m probably not as ashamed as I should be when I say how smug I feel overhearing people’s conversations afterwards about the questions and thinking to myself 'wrong!'
They both look over at Mr and Mrs Watson, who are now talking only between themselves in harsh, whispered tones, jabbing fingers accusingly at the other - most likely an argument, then. John presses his lips together, suppressing a sigh. Sherlock shook his head. "Later."
She tilts her head, almost pouting. “Oh, shame. Still, have fun at your sister’s. Another time perhaps?”
"That Victor basically got you drunk then punched you. Never liked the guy, anyway, if it's of any comfort."
He got on a different carriage soon afterwards with some fifth years, and read as the self-driven carriage rattled along and the fifth years prattled on non-stop. On the train, he got into the first empty carriage and carried on reading. He hadn't felt this lonely since first year.
“So yeah. That’s just an update. I think - I think I won’t be coming back here for a while. Can’t have you interrupting my dates. Like you used to.  Except Ella would say this time, it’s just a ‘manifestation of my guilt’ and my ‘fear of commitment’ making me think of you so much. Bloody therapists, think they know everything, eh? So yeah. For now, I’m going to move on. With Mary. My girlfriend. So. See you soon.”
"I can't say I disagree with you there." He settled down against the pillow. "You know, it is a shame that they won't let me write about this on the blog. The case, that is."
“I must say, my brother’s standards have lowered considerably if this is what he is hiring now,” Sherlock’s snappish voice interrupted John’s thoughts.
When he finally woke up, he was exhausted and sticky with sweat but drained of infection. His arm was in a cast, and the heart monitor beat steadily next to him, a reassurance that he was okay, he was alive, he could go back to work soon.
By then Sherlock had pulled back, an unfamiliar look of uncertainty spread over his face as his eyes ran over John's face, deducing, checking. Not unlike the way the Milverssen had done. Except its eyes were dead, inhuman. Sherlock's were very much alive - glowing in comforting and exotic greens and blues. John had never been more in love.
"No people, no terrible DJing," Sherlock stands closer, his mouth next to John's ear, making him shiver, as he whispers, "No bloody balloons."
Having missed him at the station and not seen him on the train, he met Sherlock outside where the self-drawn carriages. Sherlock was in his uniform - his blue tie done up neatly with cat-like precision, a cloak which now was showing his wrists due to yet another growth spurt, crinkle-less shirts and trousers. John smiled at him with the same enthusiasm as usual, as though nothing had actually changed.
"I'm not gay." He'd responded, but he could not deny the way his voice faltered, his heart sped up anxiously, a mixture of fear and sadness washing over him. Irene had dismissed him with a laugh.
John can't help but grin with him. "What about you and your stupid accent? And here I was thinking you'd be a good actor."
John's eyes widened. His stomach twisted slightly and he had to restrain himself from groaning out loud. Forcing himself to turn around, he faced the girl who had just spoken, knowing full well who it was."
I’ve been on this train for half an hour and already I miss you like crazy. I don’t know how we’re going to survive being in desperate countries for weeks on end. It seems dramatic, because surely we should be used to this by now, but at least at sixth form we could see each other almost every other weekend. I have no idea what the work load will be like and...
“It’s the same as the others, in that they all took the same poison and were found in deserted areas that had no meaning to them, at least according to witnesses who knew them. Except,” Sherlock turned to look at John, his knee jogging up and down erratically, “this one has a note. Hopkins didn’t give the specifics, but I’m guessing it’s not exactly ‘this is my killer’s name and how to find them’. Even Lestrade wouldn’t need my assistance for deciphering it, if that was the case.” Sherlock thought of the man with amusement and mild affection. He had become an auror working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and was gradually working his way up the work ladder. Sherlock’s occupation meant that they often ran into each other on wizarding world-related cases, and he had observed from a distance how slowly, yet surely, Lestrade was getting on with his life in the aftermath of his bereavement. In the past ten years Lestrade had received two promotions, started dating, had three relationships, the current one Lestrade was considering moving in with, Sherlock had deduced.
"Oh, of course, it was all real, she only joined me once you two got together." Moriarty raised his eyebrows. "But her past... Well, that's a story for another time."
“Here!” John interrupts them abruptly, then clears his throat when he realises that, in a sudden and unexpected turn events, Sherlock and Irene are paying attention to him. “Here, use mine.”
"For you, then. You've missed me too, missed this. I saw you staring at me in the exam." Sherlock moved away from John's face and looked him in the eyes. His eyes were already darkened.
John led him up the stairs to his bedroom, his hand still around Sherlock's wrist and his heart pounding in his chest as he tried to come up with a way to explain time travel to someone whose world revolves so much around logic and reason and science, when he himself didn't really know how it worked. When they got up to John’s room, he turned to Sherlock, whose brows were creased in confusion. He took a deep breath, then spoke.
“Well, the newspapers would say otherwise,” John points out, something bitter curling in his stomach at the memory of Janine’s smug face plastered over every tabloid paper, the headlines in bold and their accusations. He didn’t believe any of it for one second, but sometimes he did wonder how far Sherlock let things get simply for a case, and yes, the idea did make him mildly jealous. So what?
"Last summer there were five stabbing victims around Sussex. The police thought that they were unrelated and the locations were random and, admittedly, so did I at first. But really, they were making their way towards me, with a closer distance between my home and the scene of the crime each time. The last victim was my second cousin."  Sherlock felt guilt rise in him like bile.
Write back soon with your stories from France. Is it sunnier there than it is here? Have you been visiting lots of art museums and historic sites and whatever else it is an intelligent family does on holiday? Have you eaten any snails yet? If so - you poor thing.
"There was an odd interval for a week until three days ago when you didn't text me very much. I deduced you were abroad, because there is always bad signal and texts cost more, so you refrain from using your phone so much. I knew it was France because you have a distinct tan. You were sunbathing. Your family rarely leaves Britain due to financial issues, but they went abroad this year. Nowhere fancy, though. Nowhere which would require flight. So there's no other option than France."
"If you kill him you kill me too," Sherlock said boldly. "It's only logical. I'm a witness. I'm an enemy. Either leave us both be or kill us both."
Molly inhaled, her eyebrows creasing. She's conflicted, John realised. "I - don't like keeping things from you. But the nurse said that we need to keep you from becoming stressed."
In the seven months since John and Sherlock met that day at St Bart's, John had been on twenty-four cases, helped to discover no less than eight vital clues, earning eight appreciative,  if slightly bewildered glances, and had shot one man dead.
19:46 Of course. I’ll come round now have a colour scheme for the wedding I wish to discuss with you. SH
"She has her own traditions and stuff." He shrugs. "Besides, have you any idea how expensive plane tickets are to get from Ohio to England? It's insane."
John was fairly sure that this was the most beautiful man he'd ever seen in his life, and the sign from the universe he needed to stay in the club. He leaned across so that the man could hear him properly, then spoke, half yelling:
"Oh, nothing much," Sherlock says as he stands up. "Except that she's single with an irregular and pitiful social life, and that she's training to become a teacher but sketches in her spare time. She's superstitious, though not religious as such. She also recently got out of a relationship with a well-built man who is about six feet tall, perhaps taller, and who is prone to bouts of anger."
I wish you had gotten the chance to meet Redbeard. He would have liked you, I know he would. He liked anyone I liked. Or gave him food. Or didn’t kick him off the sofa. Still, however low his standards, he would have liked you and you would have liked him too.
"It's not just lessons though. There's food and beds and your friends," John paused before adding, "And me."
"Very good, John. But it will take more than that to defeat me. Why not do what that Janine girl did? Oh, I see." He looked over at the judges' panel, where ministry representatives and teachers were watching, writing. "You won't get many marks for copying your rival. You're very determined to win, aren't you? Is it for the money? Because heaven knows your family needs it. Or is it to impress someone? Mmh..."
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, but John tugged on his arm, looking up at him pleadingly, so sighed and nodded. They swiftly left the theatre, coming out just as the police were starting to arrive.
“What for? She’s gone. There’s no sign she was ever here in the first place. Even you would only be able  to deduce the obvious.”
"....Consulting criminal." Sherlock settled on that term with a small smile. "People come to you with their problems. You organise the murders to help them. Brilliant."
Sarah broke up with me two months ago,  a few weeks after she and her soulmate started writing to each other. It's amazing how quickly they seemed to become attached to each other, but I guess that's a given with successfully matched soulmates. Don't worry, I'm not exactly heartbroken over it. We're good friends now.
John picks an Italian restaurant that he likes. The waiter winks and brings them both a candle, stating that it's more romantic, but neither John nor Sherlock correct her. They simply both avert their gaze to the menu and quickly order.
They turned over the page and the contents become less frequent. There’s nothing after Sherlock’s fall for over two years until John and Mary’s wedding. Say what you will about Jonathan Small, he could certainly take a decent picture. Afterwards, the pages are filled with Rosie and of her looking around wide-eyed at the park, or being held by various family members, or of her sleeping in various places. She's only a few months old so there's very little she is able to do that is truly worthy of being photographed. But John does it anyway and plans to fill up the entire album with her over the next few years, capturing all her milestones and memories for later.
"You mixed together chemicals that you knew would make an explosion. You studied chemistry at uni. You definitely had it coming." John pats Sherlock's ankles to get him to move so he can sit down next to him, and turns on the tv. "Besides, it's only one night so Mrs Hudson can get cleaners in. You're lucky she likes you so much and wouldn't evict you."
"No, it's not. I'm an ex-soldier, remember?" Sherlock doesn't look embarrassed or guilty at John's PTSD being brought up, and if he is honest, it is sort of a relief. "And I have the night shift here. I have an excuse, you don't. But if eight hours is not possible, sleep six hours tonight, and another six tomorrow night. And take a break off work."
I can see why most people would be put off by your cynicism and interest in murder, but honestly I’m just intrigued. Why are you so interested in crime? Do you want to be a police officer when you’re older?
Mycroft stared for a second, saddened, scared, then straightened his back and nodded. "Alright. Alright. I trust you."
John chuckles at the crude language, always surprised whenever someone as put together as Sherlock becomes snappish and bad-tempered enough to swear along with the plebs and commoners. John is very familiar with the mood swings and bad tempers that result from withdrawal and is glad that today the worst of it has passed, even if not all of it has entirely disappeared. “Maybe so, but genius detectives who took a shit ton of drugs a week ago and have barely slept since do.”
”John?” Sherlock said while walking into the living room, a biscuit in hand. His robe was dragging on the ground behind him from where it hangs loosely down, exposing his shoulders.
Five thrusts later Sherlock released into him but didn't stop pumping his cock. John pressed back into Sherlock to avoid the touching by reflex but didn't get very far. Soon a second orgasm started to build up, and he started moaning again, now in pleasure. As the second orgasm hit him, a tear fell from his pressed closed eye. The orgasm was so intense he screamed again, leaning his head back against Sherlock’s shoulder. This time Sherlock let his cock go, and kissed his neck softly.
It took John a while to get his breathing back under control, and when he did Sherlock pulled out. Soon John could feel the hot sticky liquid run down his thigh but didn't move.
”Can I come in?” Sherlock asked. He knew he needed to ask, especially when John was upset. John had told him that, and he tried to remember, for John’s sake.
John looked up and leaned in to kiss him again, slowly, to let Sherlock knew what he was gonna do. Sherlock understood at once and met it eagerly. This time it was different. It was as if they could read each other's minds. One of John’s hands went to Sherlock’s cheek, the other to his neck. Sherlock’s hand went to John’s waist, holding a handful of his shirt. John tilted his head a bit, and they deepened the kiss a little. It flowed so naturally. Slowly but surely John’s hand moved to Sherlock’s thigh, and the detective’s hand moved to cover John’s. To encourage him. Their kiss slowly grew bolder, and soon even sloppy. Their lips parted to let their tongues quickly touch, before going back to lips.
”It doesn't hurt anymore..” Sherlock mumbled, voice weak. John felt all colour drain from his face, and he grew cold. Shock was setting in.
John smiled and spread his thighs to reach better, making him reach along Sherlock’s upper body beautifully. Sherlock’s breath began to quicken, and his hand curled around John’s neck. He felt like his nerve ending would catch on fire, only by the way John’s warm hand stroked him with such gentleness. John was always gentle as if any rough or quick movements would make Sherlock bolt. Sherlock did want to try and get rough sometimes, but they had the time for that. Right now, he wanted them to touch each other in a relaxing way, to continue the way their cozy night had started. Usually, Sherlock hated relaxing nights. His mind had to do work all the time, or he would get bored. Right now his mind was racing, but the moment John kissed him all he could think about was that. The perfect amount of pressure on John's lips as they pressed against his. The way his hand moved. The way those muscular thighs pressed against his, and the way John’s ass pressed against his legs. It felt perfect. He was content.
”Alright. First of all, I’m sorry you ended up here. I’m sorry. There is also something I’ve always wanted to say to you…” He said and held John even tighter to distract himself from his shaking hands.”…that I never said…”
But, Sherlock was here to tease. He went slowly, pulling out a few times and leaving John empty and pleading.
”Tell Lastrade..Mrs Hudson..” Sherlock started, but started to cough. Now blood strained his whole neck and jaw, dripping down his cheeks as well. Every breath took enormous effort, but John refused to give up.
Leaning back up Sherlock put it over his armchair, making him face John again. He had started to earn back some muscle now since John made him eat more. His arms and stomach were much more formed and muscular. Still not a lot of fat, but just enough for it to be healthy. Although he still didn't have a single hair on his chest.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and started sipping his tea. A comfortable silence fell over them until John almost fell asleep. The room began to grow comfortably dark, the only light coming from the telly. Sherlock’s arm shyly sneaked around John’s shoulders as always right when John was about to fall asleep. He was new to the cuddling thing, and on his part, he still waited until John was half asleep. He didn’t know why, but it had become a habit. John didn’t mind, and only smiled and cuddled closer, until his nose lay against Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock was so warm. Oh, how he had missed this.
”Hang on..Sherlock..the ambulance..The ambulance..” He repeated as a mantra, eyes shut and forehead pressed to Sherlock’s shoulder. He looked down to see Sherlock’s eyes stare up at the sky, all light drained from them. Sobs started to wrack his body, hurting his lungs as they tore up his throat. He didn't realise it, but soon he just screamed, before his body slumped against Sherlock’s. He gripped at his coat, trying to ground himself, maybe to convince himself Sherlock was still alive inside of it.
Sherlock huffed and went to sit next to where John was laying on the couch, a cup in his hand. He was wearing John’s grey sweater, and it hung on his thin frame. It almost seemed to swallow him up, and Sherlock had to admit, it was warm and comfy. He sat up from his laying position on the couch and turned to Sherlock with a fond smile. Sherlock stared ahead at the TV, but John could see a small, shy smirk. When he lay his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, John realized how Sherlock must feel when he was leaning on him, like he sometimes did. It was often out of boredom, or that was what Sherlock told him. John suspected that he had managed to unlock Sherlock’s heart. The soft material felt comforting against his cheek, and he turned his face down into it, feeling Sherlock’s cologne on it. His curls tickled John’s forehead. He loved it.
Sherlock, as weird as it sounds, had really loved this moment. The adrenalin in his veins, John pressed against him. Now it wasn’t as fun. John was actually slowly dying. His words slowly turned to gasps. The water reached his lips now and Sherlock ducked to move John’s head onto his shoulder once more, to escape the rising water. Their time was running out.
”You can sit on the bed,” John said from behind him, sounding tired. ”Or the chair. Doesn’t matter.”
”On all fours,” Sherlock said, his breathing now heavier and voice darker with arousal. John crawled up on all fours, and Sherlock pressed his back lower down. Then, he pushed deeper in. John pushed back against him with a louder moan as more of Sherlock’s cock went inside him. His back arched, and his fingernails ripped at the couch.
”John?” Sherlock asked in a very soft voice. John opened the eyes he had closed and looked down. ”Yes?”
He went to the kettle and filled it up, before setting it on the stove. While the water was starting to get hot Sherlock leaned against the countertops, one hand on opposite side of the stove. He closed his eyes as they stung. Why did they sting? He took in a shuddering breath and realized. He was crying. He let out a quiet sob as he clutched at the countertop, the tops of his fingers turning white. His chest felt tight, and with every sob, he let out his breathing got more strained. Soon he was breathing heavily, feeling a bit lightheaded. The sound of the kettle over sounded his sobs, so hopefully, John wouldn't hear. The tears spilled from his eyes, over his cheeks, and onto the floor. Soon his cheeks were drenched, and his eyes red. But his chest a bit lighter. Who knew releasing your feelings in this utterly messy way could actually provide some relief? He took in a shuddering breath and picked up the kettle, his hands shaking a bit. Pouring two cups of tea he picked them up and went up the stairs.
”Good,” Sherlock replied as he sat back, and slipped one finger in. John bit his lip again, harder this time. As the pain subsided, he let out the breath he held in. John knew he was supposed to breathe, so he did. He took long deep breaths as Sherlock started to pump the finger in and out slowly.
Soon they were a panting, squirming mess. John pressed his thighs against Sherlock’s as he was getting close to the end, and that made Sherlock take in a deep breath. Knowing John was close Sherlock reached around and gently pressed in a finger in John. He knew the other man liked that. He remembered it from their last time. The other man gasped and closed his eyes, coming hard when Sherlock pressed against his prostate. His hand on Sherlock’s shoulder tightened along with his thighs, and he let his head fall down to his chest. Stars exploded in his field of vision, and Sherlock just watched. He watched how John’s mouth dropped open, how he curled into Sherlock, and how his chest rose in shaky breaths. Leaning up John kissed Sherlock, and began to stroke a little bit faster, but still in a gentle way. This was all about Sherlock now, and John was gonna make him enjoy it.
He swallowed hard, making a tear drip down his cheek, and rose his hands to lay them around John’s shoulders. The moment his arms closed around the smaller man, he collapsed against him. Sherlock tightened his grip, loving the feeling of the small bundle of warmth he now held against him. He could feel John’s shoulders shake under his hands, and moved his thumbs up and down. Leaning down he pressed his nose to John’s hair as if the smell would make everything okay. Nothing could make this okay. But at that moment, when Sherlock held John against him, he felt okay. He felt like everything could be alright if they could just stay like this forever. But reality would catch up with them sooner or later.
”I was afraid to lose you. You are the first person, besides my parents, to really care for me. Yes I know Mycroft might…care a bit but from outside the family…it’s you John. It’s always been you. Only you. You saw something in me worth staying for, and that’s…” He couldn’t find the right word. ”not something that happens.”
”Do you want me to talk? I don’t…I don’t know what to do.” Sherlock admitted, his voice cracking at the last word. His fingers and feet were starting to go numb. It grew colder around him. Wetter. The water reached his shoulders now, and John’s chin was almost under. The fall of water were right beside them, so close water was splashing on their faces.
John’s heart broke, and he rubbed Sherlock’s back. ”Of course.” He whispered and pulled Sherlock closer. He felt the other man lay his head in between his shoulder and neck, the rest of his body pressed against him. His knee bent over John’s legs, radiating warmth through their clothes.
Sherlock nodded and sat down on the chair in the corner, it seems like the polite thing to do. He could be polite, especially if it was about John. He saw John move to take the cup and sit on the bed, legs crossed, facing Sherlock. His fingers played with the handle, eyes glued on the liquid.
As a third finger was in John started to grind against the couch, desperately wanting some contact. Sherlock immediately put a firm hand on his lower back, holding him still. John wanted to groan and cry so desperately but bit his lip. He would not give in yet. Soon a fourth finger was in, and Sherlock was teasing him so much John wanted to just push back into his fingers and fuck himself. Although Sherlock had other plans. John heard him rise from the couch, before sitting back down. Now his cock was pressed up against John's ass, the head of it already by John’s entrance.
”You were always so defensive about it that I thought it would be better to not discuss it. But the chemistry between both of us…is clear to read.”
”Shush.” John breathed and started to open up his coat, trying to locate the wound. He heard how someone yelled for someone to call an ambulance, but it quickly drowned out with the sounds of frantic voices and cries. He both saw and felt Sherlock’s chest shudder violently under his touch as he pushed the coat away, revealing a big stain, spreading quickly. He cursed under his breath and shrugged his jacket off to press against the wound, while looking up at Sherlock’s face. He was pale, and with every exhale followed a pained grunt. The pain must be unbearable. He was shot in the abdomen, which John deep down knew was really, really bad.
And he needed to tell Sherlock. He swallowed hard and let out a shaky breath. Before he could call his name Sherlock entered the kitchen in his lap robe and glasses, a vial in hand. He went to the countertop in front of John to fix something, completely unaware of John’s emotions. Or if he knew, he didn't say anything. John watched his back for a moment, just thinking about how lucky he was. He got this amazing man, who wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for him. He knew he was blessed to have met him because he needed him. Sherlock made him eat again, he made him forget his limp and he made him sleep through the night. Sherlock saved his life. Finally, he mustered up the courage.
Once Sherlock’s wrists relaxed in John’s, John held them in a more gentle grip. He looked at Sherlock, but Sherlock looked away. Tears filled his gorgeous blue eyes, shading them slightly red.
Sherlock himself still didn't know how to progress this, and when John looked up at him he seemed almost more upset. Sherlock looked down. Why couldn't he cry, as John did? Now John would believe Sherlock didn't care at all like John didn't matter to him. That wasn't right. John mattered to him, more than anything else. So why couldn't he cry? Show that he was upset? The feelings didn't belong in his brain as words, he needed to express them. But he couldn’t.
As Sherlock turned off the telly and they were left in the dark, John cuddled closer. Sherlock’s arm tightened around him, and they both sighed in content. Just as they were about to doze off, John mumbled.
Sherlock looked down before he nodded. John rose to give him a hand, which Sherlock took and rose on shaking legs. He flushed the toilet and went to the bedroom to sit on the bed. He sat there in silence in what felt like forever before John came in with two cups of tea.
John’s body was wet and heavy against him. His breathing was so shallow Sherlock could barely feel it, despite them being pressed together. His own numbing transport didn’t matter. But having John against him, even when cold and numb, made Sherlock feel a bit better. As if their contact could keep John alive.
John let one hand slide down Sherlock’s hip, inside his boxers, which by the way was the only thing Sherlock wore as pants. He brushed his hand over Sherlock’s thigh, still amazed by how soft the skin was. Sherlock gently pushed up against him, eyes watching him through half-closed lids.
”Sherlock!” John exclaimed in surprise, his arm going across his eyes by reflex. When he lowered it Sherlock was gone, but his footsteps were heard on the stairs. John rose from the bed and put his cup down, before hurrying after Sherlock in fear that he might hurt himself, or the kitchen. When he came down he saw Sherlock completely destroying the kitchen. He pushed everything on the table to the floor, making it crash as glass broke, and liquid spilled. His face was angry, to say the least, but still, he cried.
”I don’t know if I made the right choice to. I still don’t know these things…just the science of it. That doesn't help anymore.”
John was quiet for a while, maybe gathering the strength to talk, before saying; ”I was stupid Sherlock. I…should’ve told you as well. I don’t know why I didn’t. Perhaps I was ashamed.”
When Sherlock reached John’s neck, he was already panting, and hard as a rock. When he bit down gently on his pulse point, John snapped. He grabbed Sherlock’s hair, maybe a bit more aggressive than necessary, and kissed him. John kissed him deeper than Sherlock had, and immediately pressed his lower lip in between his. He felt Sherlock grin against him but didn't pull away. He let John kiss him for another ten seconds, before he pulled back, strong enough to get away from John’s grip. Sometimes John forgot how strong Sherlock had become.
”Sit against the headboard,” John said and Sherlock complied. John put the cups on the nightstand before crawling up beside him and handed Sherlock his cup. He took it in shaking hands and brought his knees up to hold the cup against them to not spill and burn himself. They drank their tea in silence until the cups were empty. The John put them on the nightstand, and they lay down. Sherlock laid on his side, and John laid down to hold him from behind. After a while Sherlock turned around to face John, his beautiful eyes wide and frightened.
Only the roar of the water filling the well was heard, before Sherlock took a deep breath. He leaned in to speak in his ear, to make sure he really heard him. ”You can hate me for this, John, but it needs to be said. I am in love with you.” The realization punched him in the stomachs and he sighed. ”I always have been. I always thought I wasn’t capable of feeling these things, but the chemistry does not lie.”
”That’s it then? You're gonna tease me now?” John asked with a small grin, knowing he would not grin later tonight. ”All night?”
So John granted his wish. He went a bit faster, but not too fast. He was still making sure Sherlock would have a pleasurable orgasm. They went on for another minute before Sherlock was laying his head back and whimpering as the orgasm took over his body.  John watched, fondly, until Sherlock was spent. Then he leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s loose lips, getting a weak response.
But as Sherlock turned to hold his jar up to the light he saw tears in John’s eyes. They made John’s eyes darker. It made Sherlock curious, and surprisingly a bit concerned. What made John upset? If it was a person he would personally track him down and murder him without a chance of his body ever being found. He forged his gaze away and leaned down to add another liquid o his first, creating a small explosion in the water, making it splash over the table.
”Okay?” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips, who nodded. Sherlock’s hand moved up to cup John’s jaw, pulling him back against him. John’s hand moved to the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, before rubbing his thumb as close to his crotch as he could without touching it.
Sherlock entered the kitchen to see John staring at his computer, eyes wide. His fingers were pressed against the mouse as he scrolled up and down again, reading something over and over. Sherlock glanced at him through his science glasses before going to the sink to add water to his jar. If John was upset there was no point in asking. He would tell Sherlock later. Or more exact, scream at Sherlock before breaking down and disappearing to his room. Usually, Sherlock didn't mind. He knew John was burdened. That happened more often these days, as John had more on his mind. Sherlock had urged him to go back to his phycologist, but John refused. He said he couldn't talk to anyone right now, and Sherlock did not blame him.
Sherlock coughed, staining his lips with drops of crimson blood. John forgot how to breathe in that moment, everything moved in a blur. Focus, the military doctor in him shouted. Focus, and keep him alive. He looked down at the jacket again, which now was almost soaked in blood. The sight made John sick to his stomach, along with the puddle which was forming around Sherlock way too quickly.
”Sherlock! Calm down! This doesn't change anything!” He tried, looking up at Sherlock’s face. Sherlock stilled but avoided John’s gaze. John must be disappointed in him now.
”I love you too.” He said and kissed his head, before closing his eyes. He slowly fell asleep to the smell of Sherlock’s shampoo.
”Does that feel good? Having my finger all up your ass?” Sherlock asked in that deep, almost vibrating tone of voice. John wanted to groan and cry as his now achingly hard cock was pressed against the leather cushions, but all he could do was a nod.
Sherlock nodded, and looked down at his own cup, swirling the tea around in it. The silence was thick in the air again, and Sherlock desperately wanted to say something. He just wanted John to stay.
He stopped outside of John’s bedroom door, staring at the dark wood. Maybe this was a bad idea. No, his mind argued. John needed to talk. Sherlock knew that was logical.
John did not know when Sherlock disappeared from his sight. One second he was there, the next he was gone. His long legs carried him faster than Jon’s short, and he was soon far in front of him. Still John ran the fastest he could through the crowds of London’s street, following him, heart beating hard in his chest. Soon a gun shot echoed through between the walls of London, making John’s heart miss a beat. He prayed that Sherlock was unhurt, or the one that pulled the trigger. Soon he could see a body through the people starting to gather around, and his heart sank fast. That coat.
”How can you take these kinds of news, and be okay?” John asked quietly, still not looking up. Sherlock nodded. Fair enough.
Sherlock kissed back, his mind now spinning. He remembered the last time he orgasmed. He had feared it in the beginning, but when it was going on it felt so good. He wanted to feel that again, he craved it. He let out a shaky breath and leaned back, bending his back and pressing up against John. He almost whimpered, feeling the need for John to go faster. He needed the release.
He looked up at Sherlock, who was looking down at him, head tilted to the side. He wheezed, as if trying to gather enough strength to speak. Slowly he twitched his fingers, and John saw it. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand tightly with the one that weren't holding the jacket, squeezing it.
”John.” He whispered and tried to lift him, but the chain stopped it. His arms were getting tired. He couldn’t hold him up anymore. Then he started to panic. His brain abandoned him, and he was left with nothing.
”I..don’t..wanna..die..” He said with surprising strength, before all of it seemed to drain from him. His eyes drooped, and John slapped his cheek again. John had never seen Sherlock so weak, so vulnerable. And he never wanted to again.
John stared at the email, his fingers tightening on the edge of the table. He couldn't believe it. Apparently, his whole old army was being called to war again, this time in Iraq. There was a bombing going on, a work by terrorists. He swallowed hard, feeling nausea coming creeping up on him. He was gonna be sick. He bit his finger hard, trying to hold back tears. This couldn't be true, not when everything was going so well. He could not return to war now, he had finally got his life together. He got a job, a partner and a home. For once in his life he ate well, he exercised while on cases and he slept rather well. Usually, if he had a nightmare Sherlock would calm him down, and he did a very well job at it. He had gotten used to waking up beside Sherlock. He could not return now, he was already scarred enough.
The rain began to tap on the window, and John relaxed with a exhale. He loved rain and the sound of it against the window. Cracking his eyes open John saw the reflection on the raindrops on the floor and the now soft light from the telly. Sherlock picked up the remote and lowered the volume a bit so John could sleep if he wanted. Smiling John leaned up and kissed his cheek. Even in the bad light from the TV, he could see how Sherlock blushed quickly and looked down. John chuckled quietly and kissed his cheek again, this time letting his lips linger a bit longer. Sherlock arm around John’s shoulder tightened as he turned his head and captured John’s lips in a kiss. John’s hand went to Sherlock’s cheek, holding the now blush-warm skin. Sherlock’s free hand landed on John’s thigh as he turned his upper body towards him, radiating heat into it. John opened his mouth slightly to seal his lips around Sherlock’s lower lip, just pressing his lips against his, not sure how far Sherlock wanted to take it.
”Hey.” He tried forged Sherlock to look at him with the hand on his cheek. He gave a soft, strained smile. ”I will be fine.” Sherlock swallowed hard, before leaning down to press his head in between John’s shoulder and neck. John laid an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, and they sat like that for a while. John could feel Sherlock’s breaths by the way his chest rose and fell against his own, and tried to match it. Soon John nudged him, and he sat up slowly. Meeting his gaze John gave him an encouraging smile, and Sherlock felt a bit better. Still, his stomach hurt. He rose from Johns lap to run to the bathroom. Concerned, John followed him just in time to see him vomit into the toilet. Shock. He kneeled beside and lay a hand on his back. Rubbing it soothingly he pushed Sherlock’s locks from his face as he spits and heaved until he was done. When he sat back up, his cheeks were wet with tears again. ”This was not what was gonna happen.” He said in a low voice, eyes cast down.
”I will be fine.” He said slowly and clearly. ”I have been through this before, and I survived. I can do it again.”
He felt John’s hand on his neck. His thumb was rubbing in slow circles, like all strength was leaving him but he wanted to feel Sherlock one last time. Sherlock pushed the thought away. John was going to leave this well. Both of them. Alive. Not in body bags. Their story did not end here.
”What time are you leaving?” That question made Sherlock swallow hard, and he realized the seriousness of this situation. John was leaving, and would probably never return.
”What is the point of these shows? No one watches them! They're just taking advantage of stupid people to earn it.” Sherlock exclaimed with a raised hand, and John smiled into the sweater.
John opened his door with increasing trepidation as the afternoon wore on. When he found Sherlock curled up across three chairs, the patients all regarding him with a mixture of concern and clear disapproval, John couldn't bring himself to wake his friend - at least he was keeping out of trouble.
After much patience, much careful preparation and almost ejaculating twice already, John was on the brink. He had been on the brink for so long he thought he was on the way to mastering tantric sex. He thought maybe Sherlock would enjoy investigating that side of things actually. He would bring it up later. After... oh...
"Me?" John said, indignant as he turned to see Sherlock's retreating back swanning out of the room. "Charming, Sherlock," he mumbled. "I thought we just talked about treating your friends more pleasantly?" he called.
John took a deep breath and reached across to him. He met Sherlock's eyes again and they were shining. John loved what was happening to Sherlock. He was so much more aware of himself, even if he had unintentionally dressed to kill John again, he knew by now that John was turned on by the smallest thing Sherlock did. He didn't have to use many of his deducing skills to see it.
John took Sherlock's hands in his, tugged him away from the wall and walked backwards until he hit the door with his heel. He shoved and pushed through it, bringing Sherlock with him, the shirt flowing around him where John had left it dishevelled. To even things up a bit he yanked at his own collar, pulling off his tie and grabbing the hem of his shirt with one hand, pulling it loose and starting on the buttons.
Hi! I'm so sorry it took me so long to finish this, I fully admit to falling into two new fandoms (well one really, just Dylan O'Brien and everything he's involved in *sigh*) and letting John and Sherlock go for a bit. But part of this I'd written months ago and the last part came to me the other day and I had my ending. Yay! I hope it's a satisfying ending, they've definitely ended up in new territory, no secrets now. Thanks for reading and all the kudos and comments from before, you've all been lovely :D
There was a definite lack of urgency the next morning to get up and start the day. John awoke still in Sherlock's arms and although his first instinct was to ask if it was still ok to be there, he didn't. Sherlock was an adult. He had considered this for so long that he must know what he was doing. So John relaxed, breathed in the sleepy scent of Sherlock's skin, and waited for him to wake up.
"Oh, God," John cried, opening the front door to see several workmen repairing the mess that clearly emanated from Sherlock's earlier bathroom experiment. "Sherlock, you didn't tell me you made a hole in the floor."
John just nodded. He wanted a shower and some decent sleep. He looked over at Sherlock who was shrugging into his coat and apparently refusing to make eye contact with him now. He clearly wasn't up to any sort of discussion either.
John smiled, continuing his massage of Sherlock's body and when they were both finished they tried to get under the spray at the same time and ended up in a close embrace in order to fit.
John sighed loudly. "It's the alcohol," he said, deliberately avoiding any preamble as to why he and his sister didn't get on. "Mostly that. And the way she treats people because of it. It's not been good."
When he opened the door next time to see Sherlock was talking to poor Mr Willets, John called over to Mary to please swap his next patients. She jumped up and went straight over to rescue the man, Sherlock giving her a glare as she extracted the patient and escorted him to John's door.
"John," Sherlock exclaimed, rarely alarmed but apparently he was at the sight of John. "What's happened? Is it Mrs Hudson?" He had his hand placed on John's shoulder within two steps, looking anxiously between John and Mrs Hudson's front door.
"I am bloody relaxed," he blurted, tensing up instantly and feeling the irritation flow through him.
Sherlock was frowning when John glanced up but he didn't hang around, he nodded and tried to clear the emotion from his face, knowing what he must look like, as he backed out of the room and closed the door with a quiet snick behind him. He stood for a moment, hands going to his face and he released a silent groan. That was so much bloody worse than what he had feared would happen.
He waited a moment, fairly scandalised by his own admission, concerned by Sherlock's reaction, needing a cold shower with how hot he now was.
"What?" Lestrade just stood there, blocking the door while Sherlock shrugged into his coat, shaking his head and frowning as if Sherlock was speaking another language. Which, in fact, he was, by all accounts. His new language included words like: John, kissing, touching, sex.
John had been staring at him, wholly confused, apparently turned on, for most of the evening so far. But now, he seemed to have a certain something in his eyes that made Sherlock instantly regret that they were so far from home. Maps of the streets between here and home flashed through his mind as he determined just how quickly they could get there - fifty-three minutes on foot, over-estimated due to their alcohol consumption, or fourteen minutes by train from Charing Cross.
John put a hand on his hip, looked around the room, trying to find something to focus on other than Sherlock.
John felt the happiness filter through him, warming him more than alcohol ever could. Sherlock had really come up with something special this time - personal, meaningful. He was showing true friendship and John was humbled. He would do something in return; try to show Sherlock that he could be as good a friend to him. Not just a pining wreck of a man.
"Mrs Hudson?" John said, eyebrow raised. He pushed away from the breakfast table and downed his coffee before clunking the mug back down.
He tried not to be grumpy, he did. He smiled when he spoke, he responded in the right places when Sherlock talked. But by the time they were back in Baker Street, John was ready to stop for the night. He let Sherlock into the flat before him and finally let his face fall, rubbing at his eyes under the cover of closing the door behind them.
"I'm..." Sherlock started, and looked down to his toes while John watched him. "I've noticed that you've not been dating," Sherlock continued bluntly.
John slid his arm beneath Sherlock's shoulders and shook his head at himself. "D'you think we got a bit carried away?"
Sherlock just waited while John stuttered over his words. It appeared that they were both nervous. Angelo brought their menus out before John could finish, and he ordered wine and a starter before Sherlock had even looked at his menu. He could only stare at John.
The final straw was when he led his last patient back into the waiting room and Sherlock was tearing out pages from a medical subscription magazine and making a tiny set of origami animals on their way into a paper 'Ark'.
Sherlock wondered how long it would take before John touched him, or whether they would make it back home. Either way, he was enjoying their date very much.
Sherlock frowned harder and he slowly shook his head. "No," he finally said, and John had never experienced the thing his chest did at that moment.
"When I arrived back and found you with Mary, I- it took me some time to understand. But when I saw how happy she made you, how could I not be pleased? And yet, I believed I had let you down. By leaving I had created all that anger and you needed to release it. I believe that build up of anger culminated in what happened at the hospital."
Sherlock wasn't like that. Soft words, forgiveness, understanding where there was nothing to understand. That was Sherlock's way.
"I'll call her, arrange something," he said quietly, as they rounded the corner onto Baker Street, Tesco bag in hand carrying their dinner.
"I can't begin to imagine what you think of me, I don't even recognise myself, from that day, I don't-" he faltered, drawing another sharp breath, he refused to spare himself a moment of tears. He wasn't here for Sherlock to pity him, he needed to get this said. "Sherlock," he whispered, and he came to a halt again. John looked up into eyes so soft and adoring, and how... how could Sherlock still look at him that way? After what John had said, what he had done?
"Is that right? So, finishing off my cheesecake was a good plan was it? And swigging it down with the last of the wine?"
"Can I..." John's voice cracked, and he swallowed. "Can I touch you?" he whispered, barely audible above the rushing water.
So... Mary. I popped her into this story in the smallest way possible, just as I would have preferred in the show. No Mary hate here, I just think short and sweet is good ;)
He had no qualms about any of it now, not if it was ok with Sherlock. He risked a quick look at the man beside him, lounging on the seat, long legs crossed as he blatantly stared back at John, a look in his eye - he knew what he was doing. John closed his eyes. Only a few more minutes. The back of a cab was no place to out Sherlock Holmes.
Later, when Sherlock had slept off his painkillers, he emerged from his bedroom again, yawning, hair ruffled, and sheet just about clinging to him as he shuffled into the living room, slouching onto the sofa while John stared from across the room.
