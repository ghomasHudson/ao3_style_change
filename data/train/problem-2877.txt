"Figured you must have stashed them in the back somewhere," Dean says. "They get in here, knock the two of us out, start causing trouble. I'm sure they made one helluva racket looking for a way out of here."
Rage it is, then.
"Who says we want that?" Meg snaps back.
Sam stares straight at him, and it becomes one of those moments where Dean is uncomfortably aware of time passing. It feels like Sam looks at him forever. Then, he blinks, squeezing his eyes shut hard.
The first voice is casual, conversational. "Shut up, Wendy," they say to the third voice. "David said people hear things around this place. Someone calling out for someone else. He said people walk by and they just, like, cry uncontrollably."
"I'm going to find you, Cas," Dean whispers. "I promise."
The voices are coming closer.
He reads.
"All things considered," Cas says vaguely. He's still hung up on "Mr. Winchester."
Dean doesn't look back.
Dean just smiles at him, before he does something brave, or stupid, or both.
"It was supposed to be a simple job." Dean still can't meet Cas' eyes. "Just a grab-and-stab, something we've done a million times. But I screwed up."
Billie cuts in before Meg can respond. "There's no way we're even considering this." Her tone is sarcastic, but there's real fear bleeding into it. "You can't bargain with a Winchester!"
Dean snapped back at him.
Raising his eyes to meet Dean's, Jack asks quietly, "How did you get out?"
Then Jack sits bolt upright, and Dean takes a knee beside him, keeping his hand on Jack's arm in the hopes that it's reassuring. "Dean, I'm so sorry," Jack says, and his eyes are filled with horror as they find Dean's. "I couldn't - I didn't - it-"
"Proud of you, Sammy," Dean mumbles habitually.
Usually Dean isn't a ghost, either.
They're home, technically. Dean wonders if he can still call it that. Sam offers Dean a hand to help him out of the car, but Dean brushes him off. He's had enough pity for today.
"But I woke up. I woke up, and I'll do it again," Dean says, and he knows he will, he can feel the truth in his gut. "You can't stop me. I'll wake up, I'll find Jack, I'll find Cas, and we'll be right back here talking again. And in the meantime, I'll be makin' enough noise to wake the dead. I found out that I make a real good ghost, and I will haunt your sorry asses 'til the end of time."
Jack's posture crumples a little, his smile slipping. He closes his eyes. It's agony, the waiting. Dean isn't even sure what he's doing. But he can tell it didn't work when Jack opens his eyes and exhales a long, devastated sigh.
It's what he deserves.
asks Cas' voice in his mind.
Dean's staring at him from the doorway. He's gone completely numb, all emotion pushed out of his head by one all-consuming thought.
But day by day, as Dean fails to get their attention and their comrades fail to appear, the air in the bunker feels heavier, thicker.
Dean finds his makeshift Empty-opening spell in the library. He picks it up and goes to find the kids again, moving silently through the bunker.
He reopens his eyes, and Dean is down on one knee next to his hospital bed, box open to reveal a simple silver band.
The same quiet tinkling of bells as before announces the opening of a portal. Dean looks up at the stars, giving a nod of thanks before he steps through.
Dean doesn't really hear what he's saying to Sam. As his body shuts down, his brain is stomping on the gas, scattering him in a thousand directions. He thinks he's saying something to Sam about coming to get him at Stanford. All he can hope is that it's reassuring. He wants Sammy to be okay. To have a good life. That's all Dean has ever really wanted.
Then he feels the weight of Cas in his arms, the flow of the air in and out of his lungs, the pain and fear and love and joy in his heart, and knows it's real. Jack reaches out to help Dean balance Cas' weight, and they gently lower him to Dean's bed. Just as they did in the Empty, they take up positions on either side of him - Jack on his right side, Dean on his left. Dean's wearing the jacket with Cas' handprint on it, just as he was when he originally stepped into the Empty with Jack. It was the most important part of the spell, a tether to what they sought. He presses his hand to Cas' shoulder again, renewing their connection.
Dean opens his eyes.
"All the other doors are open. Why isn't this one?" Hazel ponders.
"You said...you said happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being," and even though his eyes are closed Dean can see Cas' face, alight with understanding and peace and love, love for Dean, love Dean was too stupid to see. His heart beats faster. "Cas, you had me. You've had me for so long. Maybe always, maybe since we met, I don't know. And I didn't tell you..."
As he's walking away, he thinks about what he would have wanted in a childhood home, if he'd allowed himself to want. "Y'know what, we'll spruce the place up a little, get some recliners, we'll get you one of those big-screen TVs..."
Dean again feels the sensation that he is too much for his body, that there's an energy pushing at the bounds of him. He knows what it is, but it's still hard for him to name it.
His body is slowing but his soul is thrashing against its bounds, raging against this end. He doesn't want to go. He has so much left to do. So much left to say.
Dean turns to look over his shoulder, hoping to catch Sam rolling his eyes at Dean. But instead he sees that Sam and Jack aren't following him.
All he can feel is the pain of all his lifetimes of loss.
"Hello Dean," Cas whispers.
The voice in his head repeats all this, and more voices pick it up, Cas and Sam and Chuck and Jack and Mary and John all howling like hurricane winds that Dean is alone. He drops the jacket to clutch at his chest, gasping for air again.
"I remember the portal closing, but that's it," Dean admits. "Do you know what happened?"
Dean's in the library when they get in, and he watches them walk towards Sam's bedroom. Miracle is leading the way, much quicker than the two humans. They're both shuffling along with the gait of two people who are bone-tired, as if it's been weeks since they've slept. Watching them walk arm in arm, Eileen squeezing Sam's elbow a little tighter than necessary, makes Dean's chest ache. He's happy for them, of course, but he can't help but remember what he's lost. It's getting harder to push those thoughts away. But after they disappear from sight, Dean shakes himself out of it and goes back to work.
"You didn't answer my question," Meg responds, her eyes glinting dangerously as she raises an eyebrow.
So he talks about the good times. About how proud he is. About how Sam was there for him, how important he is.
A woman is the next visitor to the bunker. She's short, brown-haired and brown-eyed. Dean recognizes her.
Dean inhales slowly before responding. "I'm okay, Sammy. I really am."
"Return." "Kill." "Wrong." "Lost." "Foolish." "Hunt." "Dead."
"Absolutely not," Jack responds with a grin. "Let's get 'em." He picks a direction and starts walking, Dean alongside him.
The drive takes too long, even though he's not actually sure how long it takes. Finding Pontiac is easy, but he's worried about finding the barn. It's been a long time. Dean finds himself taking turns without really thinking about them, slowing the car before the road even curves. Like a moth to a flame, he's drawn back to the place where he had first met Cas.
They find Michael and bring him back to the bunker, but he can't open the God Book, so that's a bust. Sam is trying to plan next steps when Dean's phone rings. He's five or six beers in at that point, so he doesn't realize how weird it is that his phone is ringing when there are only three people left on Earth, and one of them is in the same room as him.
He prays for help. No one answers.
He closes his eyes, and he remembers.
Dean lowers his fist, hitting his thigh harder than necessary. "Yeah," he chokes out bitterly, "yeah, there were. A whole gang of demons, just for us. It was a trap. I fell for it, and then you, Sam, and Eileen had to come rescue me." Before Cas can ask, Dean adds, "They're both fine. Some bumps and bruises, a few fractures, but they're okay. You took the worst of it."
There's nothing for what feels like miles. And then, all of a sudden, there's something.
"Cas," he starts, and then he realizes he doesn't know what to say. He's never done this before. He's never said it before, to anyone.
It's a strange kind of peace, just sitting there in the dark, anchoring each other through their hands, Cas ruminates. It's strange, but everything about their time together has been strange. The past few weeks, after Dean brought Cas back from the Empty, had been stranger than ever and yet so frighteningly familiar. There were no more apocalypses to stop. Cas was human. He and Dean had both confessed their love for each other. They were more open with their affections, sure, but much of their relationship was the same as it had always been. It was just easier to say out loud.
Twenty minutes later, they walk out of the hospital chapel as Mr. and Mr. Winchester.
Dean gently slides his right arm under Cas' shoulders, his left arm supporting Cas' knees. Dean grips Cas tight as he lifts him easily into his arms. He has nothing left to carry, no burdens weighing him down. Dean stands, cradling Cas close to his chest.
He could save Cas.
"I feel terrrrrrrific," he slurs. Dean opens his eyes and sees a beer bottle and his laptop. Two distractions right at hand. He shuffles awkwardly on his knees to face the chair so he can drape his upper body over its seat, pushing himself up to a near-standing position before maneuvering himself to sit down.
"Go."
"What?" he chokes out, and Sam looks at him, and he looks at Sam. Dean answers on speakerphone. Whatever is waiting for him on the other line, he needs someone else to hear it.
Dean continues to hold Cas' hand through all the tests, clenching his jaw and glaring in the doctor's direction. Cas catches his eye once, but Dean just shakes his head, jaw tightening further.
The three go quiet as they veer off into a storage room.
He's rewarded with a short bark of laughter, and a little tension eases from Dean's shoulders as it becomes a quiet, continuous chuckle. "Jesus, man, I'm sorry. Yeah, you do. I just...I...didn't want to waste any time," Dean explains, a current of guilt woven into his words.
Meg narrows her eyes. She stalks across the space that separates them, and comes within an arm's length before she stops. Dean stands firm as she looks into his eyes, then drops her gaze to Cas' face, solemn in sleep.
"Dean," she says, and she signs his name at the same time, unconsciously. She looks down at her hands, then starts over.
Looking to his left and right, Dean can see the hints of outlines of shapes. Looking down, he can almost see his feet. Looking up, a few gentle twinkles, like stars peeking through cloud cover.
Dean should be afraid, but he doesn't feel it. He feels calm, steady. Cas keeps him grounded, reminds him what he needs to do.
Damn. Okay.
Dean takes a deep breath, and feels Cas mirror him. "You have Chuck and Amara, don't you?"
Cas blinks, and blinks again. The room is coming into slightly more focus, the smaller details sharpening. He's still too cold, but his various injuries are unpleasantly heated, like walking on summer asphalt with bare feet. There's one point of warmth that feels different though. Cas shifts as best he can to look at his left hand, lying down near his hip. He finds there's another hand in his. It's Dean, of course, the fingers of his right hand placed perpendicular to Cas' and wrapping around the back of Cas' hand where it rests on the bed. Dean's palm, nestled into Cas', suffuses him with a soft, healing warmth.
Dean sprints back down the hallway, desperate to catch Sam before he leaves, but Sam is coming his way, with Miracle. He walks down to his room, slings a bag over his shoulder, and leaves without a backward glance. He stops at Dean's room, though, stands in the center of the room, Miracle at his heels. Dean stops in the doorway, and Miracle looks straight at him while Sam starts to talk.
Dean repeats it in as many places as he can. Mirrors, countertops, on scraps of paper. He can't seem to make them see.
. The numbness ebbs and is replaced by a crashing, surging wave of panic. Unthinking, Dean moves closer to Sam, tries to grab him by the arm. Dean's hand goes straight through, but Sam recoils as if he's been burned.
It's black. Not black like dark, but black like the void.
Somehow, that's worse. Cas feels his jaw drop. Dean stays silent, eyes scanning Cas' face. Cas struggles to gather up his thoughts, which seem to have scattered like cockroaches under a bright light.
He remembers how Cas held him then. Unconsciously, Dean's right hand moves to cover Cas' handprint. He squeezes. It doesn't calm the searing ache in the left side of his torso. Dean doesn't know if the pain is radiating from his heart or his shoulder. They might be the same at this point. Both touched, claimed, owned by Cas. Cas, who's gone. Again.
"Wait up," Hazel cries, and two more sets of feet go pounding after Wendy.
Good old-fashioned ghosting invokes a lot of smashing. Dean starts breaking things. He shatters a lamp in the library, scatters the contents of a cereal box across the kitchen, shreds a magazine one of the hunters leaves lying around. That, they notice. But nothing changes.
Before Dean has formulated a question, before he can even open his mouth to ask, Jack answers. "I can't interfere. I can't tell you how to raise him. But you can. Have faith. Remember the beginning."
He hasn't forgotten Cas - how could he forget? Forgetting Cas would be like forgetting how to drive, how to eat, how to breathe. It's muscle memory, thinking about him. Cas touched his soul. Cas touched his heart.
Dean leaps from his bed and rushes to the nearest blank stretch of wall. He tries to summon the strength to push at it, but his hands keep going straight through. When he's pushed his forearms through, he can feel his world start tilting. He's pushing forwards but tilting backwards, and he knows if he goes any further he'll just find himself flat on his back in his bed again.
Dean slams the door shut, and it's all he can do to not collapse again as the last embers of hope in his heart flicker and fade.
More than anything, Dean hopes that his actions in death can make up for his actions in life. He expects no reward, no express ride to Heaven. He just wants Cas to get the life he deserves. Cas deserves to be saved.
, Cas murmurs in his head.
And there he is. Cas, looking just like he did twelve years earlier, striding into that warded barn across traps and sigils while the lights exploded overhead. He's wearing his old coat, his usually tidy hair is a mess, but it's him.
"Wouldn't be home without you," Dean says. "Although I've had enough of this place to last a lifetime."
"Dean?" Jack asks, getting to his feet. "Dean, what do we do?"
Cas' voice murmurs in his ear.
"Wendy, I didn't hear anything," says Hazel.
Dean reads until he can't turn the pages anymore.
Cas wouldn't hesitate in this situation. He wouldn't wait around for someone else to man up and take action (and Dean winces at that particular thought).
"It's okay," Sam says. "There's nothing there." Miracle quiets to a growl that eventually drops off. She keeps staring at Dean.
He is okay. He's going to get Cas back.
Dean reaches a hand out into the blackness.
It's Jack.
His eyes are so blue. Dean hasn't forgotten.
When Cas is recovered, they move out of the bunker. It's just them. It's quiet. They leave all the ghosts behind.
It's hard to keep going, but Dean's afraid of what will happen if he stops.
Dean makes his way down to the dungeon. He remembers why he avoided it. Remembers the way Cas said "I love you." But he doesn't remember how he was taken, or why he did it. He can barely picture Cas' face.
Dean falls to his knees as sobs rack his body. Cold loss floods his defenseless heart.
The chorus is deafening and barely audible at the same time, echoing around his skull. He recognizes some of the voices but can't place them. Even if he could, Dean isn't sure he would want to remember everyone he's sent here.
“That was before he almost killed you.”
Dean snorts. “That your opinion or Sue Ann’s?”
“Gotta make sure I’m not getting rusty and Cas can learn something more interesting than harp music.”
“Dean?” Sam sounds like he’s talking through a thick wall. Wings beat through the air and a burning cold tears through him, light rushing over him like water, burying him and blocking out everything else in the room. Gentle hands hold something deep under his bones. He gasps.
Bobby claps him on the shoulder and helps him into the passenger seat, accepting the keys when Sam passes them over. He tosses Sam’s dropped cell phone into his lap. Sam shoves it into his pocket and leans forward to start digging around in the glove box for alcohol wipes and gauze to clean his face. There’s no glass in his eyes, but his forehead and cheek sting from the impact and embedded pieces. It’s too risky to get them out in the dark, so he settles for gritting his teeth and wiping away as much blood as he can before pressing gauze to his forehead until the bleeding stops.
“So, what now?” Dean asks and Cas smiles, small and easy. It brings out a dimple on Cas' cheek. Dean wonders if Cas can feel the way his pulse quickens.
“I didn’t say anything,” Sam protests.
“Oh, just Roy’s fine, son,” Le Grange—Roy—insists gamely and adjusts to sit back a little in his chair. “Woke up one morning, stone blind. Doctors told me it was cancer. Gave me a month, maybe two if I was lucky, since we caught it so late. So, me and Sue Ann, we prayed for a miracle.”
While the boys are still getting food, Bobby wishes he had a few more of his books with him. Hopefully, he and Sam can get Dean back to the scrapyard without Dean throwing a shit fit. They can get Dean downstairs and locked up. Figure out what rode him out of Hell. Bobby isn’t a fool. He’s been to plenty of séances doing this job and the thing had surfaced up out of Dean when Pamela had put in the call. Nearly blinded them all with the light show in the process. If Dean hadn’t pulled away from Pamela, Bobby’s sure they’d be dead or blind and Dean would be walking around with that thing using his body like a meat suit.
Elijah furrows his brows, obviously perplexed by the question, and Dean watches him, waiting until the creases in his forehead smooth out and his blue eyes widen with realization.
“Cas,” he says carefully. “You missed that point by about a mile.”
If this were a normal hunt, Dean absolutely would be sniffing up Layla’s skirt while Sam was off doing research in the capital, but nothing about this damn place has been normal. From the rain that never seems to let up, no matter how lightly it sprinkles, to the fact that the only answer they have is angels. He’s gonna be damn glad to see this place in the rear view mirror.
Dean nods and heads in the opposite direction she went, towards the bar. Castiel listens curiously to Dean thoughts, a swirl of images and vague memories of women he’s been with in the past, while he waits for the bartender to make his way over.
“You haven’t eaten anything, Dean. You sure you’re okay?”
“Soft ground.” He shoves the articles into the front pocket of his jeans and starts back through the house toward the window he came in through. “Pretty sure Roy’s picking victims he thinks are immoral and setting Elijah on them.”
“What the hell?”
Shit.
Sam grimaces. “You told Pamela not to look at your face.”
Sam grimaces at the back of her head. “Yeah, imagine.”
He pulls out his phone and calls Dean.
“Just keep your wings to yourself. Got it?”
“How can you see all the things we’ve seen and be this skeptical?” Sam asks, puzzled and a little offended. Dean looks out at the slowly growing crowd as they near the tent. The sick people and their families and friends slogging desperately through the rain, carried on by the hope of something good happening for them. He shoves his hands into the pockets of his hoodie and scowls.
“Your arm,” Elijah says, reaching for him again, and Dean throws up a hand palm-out and halts him in his tracks. Nope, he absolutely cannot do this. Not like this, not ever, and definitely not with whatever the hell Elijah might be. There are two very firm strikes against the guy, and Dean isn’t even counting the part where he has memory loss and might be being forced to kill people.
Sam exhales in a rush, surprised.
Cas tries to return the favor, but not even Dean’s instructions are good enough to make a first-time blowjob more than passable. A lack of gag reflex only accounts for so much anyway, so Cas makes up for it with the healing he seems intent on performing across every spare inch of Dean’s body he can reach. He drops kisses to every ache and pain he can find, from the ankle Dean turned in Mississippi to the shoulder he’s dislocated too many times to count.
“Holy shit,” Sam breathes.
“Is that why you possessed Dean? To stop Lucifer from being freed?”
Getting it doesn’t mean he’s going to let Sam be a bitch about it though. If he wants to have a problem, than he’s either gonna use his words so they can hash this shit out, or he can get over himself and let it the fuck go.
“You’re back.”
It’s a link. The image of Dean on the stage in the Le Grange church flashes across the back of his eyelids and he gasps, wincing. The angel made this when he healed Dean. Anchored itself to something bright and pure at the center of Dean’s body. It’s so intrinsically Dean that Sam forgets what he’s doing and reaches for it. Dean hisses, jerking away, but comes back before the connection breaks. His jaw and arm are tense. Sam pulls away from the beautiful light with a muttered, “Sorry,” and tries to follow the connection outside of Dean’s body. “I invoke, conjure, and command thee.”
“Ma’am?” the younger cop asks.
The grip on his neck disappears so suddenly that Dean drags in too much air and starts coughing. Cas reels back and away, clutching the necklace to his chest and staring wide eyed in astonishment at him. Dean twists aside and coughs blood out onto Sue Ann’s hardwood floor.
Looking at it too long makes his chest ache.
“I’ve got it,” he pants.
The pleased huffs of quiet laughter he gets at that make Dean want to lean in close and press his lips to the creases it makes at the corner of Cas’ eyes.
“I don’t know,” Cas admits and tips his head thoughtfully. “I would like to thank Sam for his part, and I’ll need to seek revelation and speak with some of my siblings. Find out what Heaven believes happened to me, and why they didn’t act when I was enslaved. Without alerting too many of them to my status.”
Fumbling to unshoulder his backpack, he offers Castiel his hand. The angel takes a second to blink down and then he’s wrapping it up in both of his. Sam stutters instead of asking his next question.
He nods into the silence of the car. Searching for another psychic will take time they don’t have, and Missouri’s hours away. He groans, pulling his hand away from the wheel long enough to swipe it through his hair and suck in a breath to calm down. Missouri waits patiently on the other end for him to pull himself together.
The left corner of Elijah’s mouth pulls up. It’s not a smile, but there’s a softness like he’s in on some joke that Dean doesn’t know about. He lifts his right hand up and cradles the side of Dean’s face.
Dragging yourself out of the grave has to be about the worst thing Dean has ever done, and he once ripped someone’s lungs from their body while Alastair threatened to carve his spine out one vertebrae at a time if he punctured either of them.
She pulls away. “It’s not just me you have to worry about, Sam. What do you think angels are gonna do when they find out what
Castiel frowns. “No.”
“Hey, no, let’s get one thing straight. I am not your vessel. You’re riding shotgun,” he hisses, kicking the bucket of trash and glass hard enough that it rattles and threatens to tip over before rocking back onto its base. “Phenomenal cosmic powers. No fucking privacy.”
“Not flaming ones.”
“God commanded it.” Dean parrots the information back mockingly, derision dripping from every syllable. “Dude, shut up.”
“Yes, I’m here again,” she says, the exasperation and exhaustion written into the lines on her face. She sags tiredly.
the angel.
“No sign there was ever anything wrong with your heart,” the doctor assures.
“He’s not harmless,” Dean says, straightening up with a pair of socks. He sits down on the end of the bed and starts pulling them on. “He’s… look, one or two is a freak accident, Sam. Not six.”
“Well, you’ve got the cheapest expert around to teach you then, but you knock me up and I’m gonna take your name back.”
“I need help translating this,” he says, waving the book.
“Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” Dean supplies to Layla’s worried amusement.
. He pushes the words into Dean’s mind.
“You okay?”
But there’s Dad, and that puts a stop to Dean’s brief fantasy. Dean can barely handle the fact that he’s been looking at Cas and seeing some
“That the worst you got?”
“Heard something. You okay?” Dean chafes a little under the worry in Bobby’s voice.
Sam leans over, puts a hand on his knee and laughs breathlessly. Safely tucked away from the spirits out for their blood, Sam lets Bobby look for answers while he pulls out some of their equipment and starts making more salt rounds. Whatever happens, they’re always going to need the ammunition.
Dean knows rationally what Elijah means. He’s too good of a hunter not to, which means Sue Ann’s getting reckless—but his mind zeroes in on every point of contact between their bodies simultaneously. Sweat breaks out across his hairline, prickling the skin under his arms and down his back. There’s a few inches between their stomachs and Dean’s hyper-aware of how easily he could grab the corner of Elijah’s open suit jacket and close the distance. Just a little more and he could slip his hand right under the damp wool fabric, and to the white dress shirt underneath.
, Cas explains. The answer makes him go cold. He can't remember the last time he really felt human. He was Sam’s shield when he was four, his father’s God damn blunt instrument as soon as he could hold a gun, and forty years is so long. He knows the taste of sulfur and blood intimately and wonders frantically if his eyes were black the first time Castiel saw him.
“You aren’t a monster, Dean. You’re human.”
He nudges Sam towards the basement, walking them quickly into a room that Sam knows wasn’t there the last time he was down here. Stepping over the raised lip of the door, he lowers the shotgun and stares at the curved walls and the pentagram protected light.
Castiel releases his hand and returns his own back down to the desk. He pins Sam into place with a sharp, searching look. Sam drops his eyes to the floor. “I told you he was safe with me. You have faith—unlike your brother—why do you doubt me?”
“Lucifer.”
He reaches inside of their body and pulls Dean’s mind back gently with a whispered apology.
The last of his doubts that Elijah could be anything else fade with the flow of pure heat and light that dips into his body. It’s what he always imagined being dumped into a hot spring would feel like, though maybe all the water around him is coloring his perception. He sighs in relief when the pain fades and Elijah pulls his hand away. Elijah nods and gets up, ignoring the mud caked into the front of his dress pants, and walks away toward the Le Grange house.
Okay, that’s a lot. Dean refuses to derail the conversation based on the implications of that right now, but it’s a close thing. He has to start folding clothes to keep silent. He smooths the lines on a t-shirt across his thigh and rolls it tightly into a cylinder before tossing it across the room and into the open mouth of the duffel bag.
“There’s a whole bit in Enochian—oh, I should have known this was about binding an angel from the beginning, sorry, I swear I actually know this stuff, but I mostly teach the historical, not the theoretical and definitely not the magical, but yeah, it’s all about the names of angels and how important they are. Cause you see, if you know an angel’s name, you can use it to summon them. Or control them, in this case. At least that’s what this priest of yours was trying to do anyway.”
Elijah reaches out toward him and Dean freezes, caught between rocking forward to meet him and stumbling back out of his space. The heat of his palm is a brand when it wraps around the lower curve of his shoulder, and Elijah moves forward while reeling him half a stumbling step closer.
Dean doesn’t know who Uriel is, but he’s pretty sure it’s one of Castiel’s siblings. Which means there’s an angel in the motel room. The motel room his brother isn’t in when he should be. He doubts the gun will do anything, but he thumbs off the safety. Useless weapon isn't going to stop him from burying a bullet between Uriel’s teeth if he doesn’t tell him where Sam’s gone.
“He…” Dean frowns at the floor. “He said please. Acted… acted like he was scared. And he called me something. Said I had a job to do. Maybe this job. So, we either let this go, which I can’t do, or we walk into it. We’ll put him down if we can connect him with the murders.”
“I’ll check it out,” Bobby murmurs, and he jerks his head toward the front door of the house.
“Okay, so…” Taking Missouri through the events of the last couple days takes half the time Sam expects. Mostly because Missouri guesses a few key things before Sam can even get to them. She takes the angel thing a lot smoother than either he or Dean did and Sam wonders, not for the first time, if maybe being as powerful as she is means she’s aware of some things that hunters might not be.
Dean doesn’t even bother to pretend he’s not curious. “Guy?”
The name repeats in time with the beat of Castiel’s grace and Castiel pulls Dean Winchester closer and whispers that his brother is alive.
“Anything about the symbol I showed you?”
He grabs Dean by the shoulder and it’s only because Dean wants him too, that he turns and faces his brother.
Maybe there is a God because Elijah only looks amused by the faux pas, lowering his head and letting out a quiet exhale of almost-laughter. When he looks back up, his eyes are glittering, and he reaches out and takes the book from Dean’s hand, turning it over to read the back. Dean smiles nervously at him, watching the way his eyes squint while he’s focusing. With the heavy weight of Elijah’s stare off him, it’s too easy to forget what he might be talking to.
Irritation swirls through him and Dean grinds his teeth together.
Sam rears up defensively.
“Sonuvabitch,” he murmurs, staring until the mirror fog up and his eyes sting.
“I’m an angel, Dean,” Cas says impatiently, like Dean forgot that little fact in the minutes since Cas flew into the room. “Those of us who receive names when we’re created… it defines us to the very first atoms of our true form.”
When the service is over, Dean shoves himself out of his chair, fully intending to corner the healer, but Layla and her mother pull his attention away when they stand, and Mrs. Rourke gives him a indignant glare.
At least their family is well adjusted.
He pulls on the angel’s sleeve again. There’s a wrenching feeling in his wrist as he loses his grip on the wool. The room whites out as light pours from the angel above him and the inside of his chest throbs as something wraps around him from the inside. His mouth tastes like ash. He gets his hand around Sue Ann’s necklace and lifts it shakily.
“Why not?”
“Guy heals people out of a fucking tent in Nebraska, Sam. How real can he be?”
The reminder sobers Dean a little, thinking of Sam’s unconscious body lying in the mud. “Yeah, well, you did what you could,” he forces out, and then checks that the cashier isn’t paying attention before shuffling a few inches closer to Elijah. He lowers his voice pointedly. “Look, Eli, me and Sam are hanging around a few more days. Looking into a job.”
A high sound stabs at the back of his head and he grabs the thread harder and pulls, repeating the words a third time. Wisps of light break away and reach towards him.
“Dean!”
“You said he had wings.”
No way. The guy looked them up somehow. Maybe the plates on the car or—he leans slightly to check his back pocket for his wallet—something. Maybe not their wallets. The only ID Dean has in there was from their last case. He would have called him Leo Cohen if that’s how he did it. It's Missouri all over again. Read like a damn book without a single word exchanged between them.
“Of course you did.”
“I… what? That’s not how names work,” he insists.
“What a bunch of dicks,” Dean says. It’s unhelpful, but he doesn’t know how to make the hurt feelings Cas is probably struggling with go away. Whole situation sucks.
“What the hell did you do, Sam?”
The smile he aims at Dean doesn’t reach his eyes.
“Who the hell are you?” Bobby demands.
“Why would an angel rescue me from Hell?”
Except maybe it is. The car's been their home since they were kids and Dean’s baby since Dad handed the keys over to him with a pat on the back and a stern warning to treat her like a lady. It took him until a few months before he died to start teaching Sam maintenance and now he’s a few days out of the grave with Castiel’s power clinging to his fingers and yeah, okay, he gets why Sam's got a bug up his ass. Doesn't mean he has to like it. “What’s your problem?”
“We’ll come back this afternoon,” she assures her daughter, still drilling holes through Dean as they walk towards the entrance. “You need to rest now.”
“Yeah,” Sam confirms. “I’m gonna find him. You stick with Elijah.”
“Seals?”
“I want to check on those hunters we’re been trying to get a hold of.” Sam hears him moving around as he talks, getting supplies together. “Haven’t heard back from any of them and that’s a problem. One person don’t call back and I can figure they’re busy, but three days of radio silence on all fronts ain’t normal.”
Dean glares at him. “Peachy.”
The case in Pennsylvania when they finally make it up there is a bust, so Dean sulks in the motel room while Sam visits the library to copy some books he found.
Dean’s mouth twists up in a grimace and he puts the glass down onto the table.
Bobby shoots him a look before he answers. “Nothing for booting angels, if that’s what you’re aiming for. Hell, a few days ago, I didn’t even think they needed to possess people. Figured they just showed up looking like the inside of a watch or a burning bush or something.”
He gets them both beers while Sam talks about Meg trapped in her own body, screaming for help. There’s something Sam’s not saying in the careful way he talks about Meg and the way he watches him when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. He puts his beer down after a few sips, the taste too many things at once to be enjoyable, and doesn’t pick it up again.
Sam stares.
The towel Dean and Castiel had been holding lays crumpled on the floor, still stained with Dean’s blood.
“You better not be looking at porn,” Sam threatens, closing the door behind him and shucking his dripping coat off onto a chair.
Sue Ann refuses to move from the spot where she’s collapsed, praying feverishly—so with a few silent exchanges of eye contact, Dean and Sam decide to leave her there. Getting out of town before someone finds her or she regathers her wits is their number one priority now, anyway. The job’s as good as done, even if Dean feels like there’s something missing as they retreat.
“Not bad,” a pleasant voice interrupts Castiel from admiring Dean and he straightens up and looks at the human that’s approached the table. His soul is bright enough, but there’s dishonesty hovering at the edges of his thoughts that makes Castiel squint at him, trying to get a better look at his intentions. “Need a few bucks for another beer before last call. Want to play a game for ten?”
He swallows. Sam heard. Sam, standing a few feet behind him at the door, watching his back.
She hums and nods, flipping through the pages and marveling over how well preserved they were. Sam doesn't dare speculate on the reason for that.
Dean stares. Cas looks back at him. He’s pouting. It’s subtle, but Dean knows a pout when he sees one. Sam’s been doing them as part of his bitch face routine for years. The one on Cas’ face is the most hilarious thing Dean’s seen in weeks.
“Okay, fine, what do we do then?”
He spits up soil and gags on the sour aftertaste of a worm that had gotten into his mouth as he drags himself to his feet to look around. It looks like a bomb went off; his grave is ground zero. Something is watching him. He can feel the sensation in his bones. Long forgotten hunter instinct makes him turn in a slow careful circle to stare out at the wide expanse of destroyed trees, trying to spot it. Anything. There’s nothing there, but the itch of eyes on him doesn’t leave.
Bobby’s sighs. “We’re on our own here.”
“And when Lilith is dead? What will you do then? Castiel is a liability.”
Bullshit. No one fucking understands. Not even Dean.
“Never mind.”
“Castiel," it answers, and it's almost Dean’s voice, but there’s a deep growl under the words. Like the thing's speaking from the back of Dean’s throat, crackling like ice. Castiel walks over to him and Bobby throws a punch, aiming for his throat. Castiel catches hold of his fist. “Dean and I need to talk. Alone."
“I’m an angel of the Lord.” Castiel reaches out with his grace and pulls lighting from the clouds to light up the sky outside. The flash makes a pair of his wings appear on the wall and he stretches them out so the shadows appear in Dean’s line of sight. Awe radiates from Dean's soul and Castiel feels pride for a second time.
Light, so hot it makes Dean’s inside melt even as the cold following it freezes everything in its path, pours into his body and through his veins straight to his heart. The dying organ gives one last series of painful palpitations as Elijah’s touch sinks into Dean and then stops. The relief of it sends Dean crashing to the floor on one knee even while Le Grange tries to hold him. Or maybe that’s all part of the show. He opens his eyes and Elijah’s eyes are whited out with the same light, the space behind his shoulders and most of the room blacked out with shadows. He’s beautiful.
“You okay?” Sam eases the car one-handed to the side of the parking lot while Dean cranks the windows down and sucks in breath after breath. It takes him eighteen breaths before he unwinds, slumping back against the seat and shrugging.
He should have put his foot down about Nebraska too. Sam’s specialist is gonna cost money neither of them can earn back. Especially not the way Sam thinks Dean does it. The thought of hustling pool or cards in a bar full of smoke makes his heart palpitate against his ribs hard enough to hurt. Maybe with a few hours of rest, he can test the waters with some truckers at the next stop. A few hand jobs won’t strain his heart much, and folks desperate enough for some company in places like this aren’t gonna give a shit about his health.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved.”
“Good, good, I suppose we can use this to our advantage for now. Keep Dean Winchester under your thumb, Castiel. Don’t tell him anything unless we tell you to. Earn his trust. Watch his brother. We’re considering options for dealing with him and Azazel. Uriel will report to you. Until you hear otherwise, he’ll be taking over the garrison while you’re gone.”
“Yeah, and I’ve been a hunter long enough to trust a feeling. Something’s going on here.”
He prays.
“Enochian?”
“You surprised me, Sam.”
“Easy on the wood. This’ll be over in a couple of minutes,” she assures. He’s having some of the worse days of his second life, but he’s happy to let her do anything she wants if she keeps looking at him like that. “I need to touch something our mystery monster touched.”
“Where the hell is my brother?” he demands, not giving a single shit for introductions.
“Depends on your perspective, I guess. According to some texts, angels acted on God’s orders to bring the plagues to Egypt. The whole smiting the first-born thing.”
Missouri hums musically down the line at him. “Your brother’s gonna be a lot easier for you to read than yourself.”
“Those demons I followed to town. Let’s go find them. Someone’s gotta know something.”
She’s almost convincing. Disappointed-sounding enough that plenty of people will believe she regrets the corpse lying dead in her yard.
“The library,” Sam mouths, nodding toward it.
Dean thrums incandescent with glee and Castiel puzzles over what he means.
Dean rolls his eyes skyward.
He points behind Dean.
“While he’s still trying to trust you?” Zachariah repeats suspiciously and Castiel freezes.
“That’s what he says—said.” Dean waves his hand through the air and makes a face. It’s two parts irritation and one part emotional constipation. “Whatever.”
She relaxes and walks away. Castiel picks up the traces of worry that Dean might still follow her back to her table.
“Castiel,” Pamela says slowly from her chair, feeling out each sound in her mouth. She looks at Dean like she knows exactly what he’s carrying around in his veins. Without thinking, he escapes out of the room and slams his way out of the house towards the car.
“Sam,” Missouri says firmly, and Sam snaps his mouth shut. “You're much more powerful than you think. You can do this.”
There's a blissful silence, and the pain in Sam's skull beats a little softer for a moment before the noise picks back up. He opens his eyes, and Elijah is pushing his way into Sam’s field of vision. If moving didn’t feel so much like being flayed, Sam would try to get out of his range.
And the bastard that killed Mom is family business.
The fault must lie with him. He lifts his borrowed hand to Dean’s chest. The amulet hanging from around his neck digs into the meat of his palm. This can’t continue. He can feel Uriel’s displeasure at their failure manifesting itself in the way his vessel’s shoulders rise and fall, wings stirring up the debris around them in angry circles of air. Arariel is tight lipped and grim before them. She plucks at the material of her white gown, a restless, nervous gesture that Castiel knows he should reach out and stop. Take her hands between his own and offer her strength and guidance.
It’s sort of nice feeling this good so soon after Hell anyway.
“But you could, right?”
He grimaces down the line. “Maybe. I’m gonna call Missouri. If a psychic can suss out a demon’s name, why not an angel’s?”
“There’s a ton of lore on fairies too, you gonna tell me those exist next?”
“Yes,” he says automatically and the man lifts an eyebrow at him and then shrugs, offering to set the table back up if Castiel will slide over the balls.
“Cas—”
Dean knows better than this, too. From the moment Elijah laid eyes on him in that tent, he’s had that stripped-down-bare feeling of being studied crawling over his skin. He’d let himself get drawn in by a pair of pretty blue eyes and a plea for help, overriding everything he’s been taught. If Elijah had been a werewolf, Dean would have shot him without daring to second guess.
“Private time,” he spits out finally, wiping his palm off on one knee and shoving himself up out of the Impala and back to his feet. Talking to Castiel is like trying to explain breathing to a rock, Jesus Christ. “There a way you can, I don’t know, go into standby mode or something.”
“Do what?” Dean demands and Bobby groans. This is exactly what he didn’t want to happen. A big blow up here and now is gonna make Dean run and give that thing a chance to take over. Then they’re gonna be chasing him down for who knows how long. “You gonna exorcise me, Sam?”
Castiel crouches down in front of him and reaches out to press two fingers to his forehead. Bobby tries to flinch away, but Castiel just keeps coming at him. He’s unconscious before he hits the floor.
—wanted his introduction to go. He's been weak since escaping from Hell, his injuries unlike anything he's experienced in the past, and he hasn't dared return to Heaven for healing with his brothers and sisters. Not until he has an explanation. It was easy fitting himself into the spaces between Dean’s cells and organs and bask in the radiance of his soul while he rested, soaking up the residual energy. When Dean was most open to him, Castiel had tried to reach out and speak to him, but he'd been clumsy in his weakness. He hadn’t expected Dean’s fear and suspicion to force him back down. Taking Dean's body over and smothering his personality with his own hadn't been part of the plan.
Cas’ grip loosens and Dean nearly lets him pull away. End it right there and move on from the whole mess—but the raw hurt from Cassie has made him desperate to pull someone, anyone, close. It’s too early to hit a bar and pick up a chick and definitely not late enough to look for a guy with dark hair and blue eyes and a couple bills to spend.
“I think this thing followed me to the fill-up joint after it dragged me out,” Dean explains as he tugs his shirt free to show Bobby the burn on his arm, and then adds carefully, “or rode me out.”
Sam hurries back to the Impala. “Anything from Dean?”
“Amen,” replies the congregation. Dean feels nauseous, sitting forward and breathing deeply, watching the friendly belief on the reverend’s face and his wife's polite, nodding agreement. The healer though… he’s focused fully on the reverend now. The searching expression is gone, replaced by something narrow-eyed and furious.
“They’re alive.”
Sam makes a noise of confirmation and there’s a muffled curse as Dean presses the towel over his face and then tosses it into the sink before striding back out.
He stops breathing. “You’re wrong.”
“That's your answer?” Dean asks.
“That was all Cas,” he answers. “What the hell did I miss?”
Dean settles back against the counter and tips the bottle into his mouth, taking a long pull, only to grimace around the mouthful before swallowing it.
doing, huh?”
There’s no lightning strike or earth-shattering realization. It just slots into place: angels aren’t unicorn levels of bullshit. They’re real, and one of them is standing a few feet away from him, washed-out and pale as he looks at this painting like it’s the answer to a question he doesn’t even know how to ask.
“Don’t move, Sammy, I got you,” Dean assures, and Sam's shirt pull against his skin when Dean curls his hand into it. He closes his eyes and Dean says something harsh and demanding. The words blur together into a cacophony of sound, and he realizes there are other people around them. Did Wright's scream bring them outside?
“Pretty sure fairies exist, Dean. You’d know.”
“Naturally. If I were there. The key to learning a name is getting in physical contact with something it’s touched. With demons, the host is more than enough most of the time. He has a body, right?”
“You saw what happened in there, Sam,” he says. “Something followed me up.”
Castiel snaps his head up.
He looks up to the top of the steps and sees Elijah peering down at him, wearing the same clothes as yesterday. The only difference is that he's stripped off the jacket and the dark blue tie has managed to flip itself backwards. His hair, which had been at least sort of tamed Sunday, now looks like it went through a wind tunnel. Or someone put their hands in it. Unfortunately, even standing partially protected on the porch, the rain’s doing a good job of slowly ruining the effect.
“We still have no clue what we’re dealing with,” Sam says conversationally after a few awkward seconds have passed. He puts his hands back down on the table. Dean relaxes a little at the attempt at normalcy. He’s half certain what’s going to happen when they get back to Bobby’s, but he wants to pretend a little longer.
“You know, a guy could get ideas,” he quips, hoping it’ll make the guy turn tail and run. Dean reaches the top of the steps and comes to a stop, turning to look at him. Elijah looks completely unfazed. His expression is blank, like he's been moving on automatic, and it's only the slight narrowing of his eyes that shows he even heard what Dean said. “What do you want?”
“What have you got?” Dean asks quietly.
“So get this,” Sam announces in the middle of the afternoon, cornering Dean in the upstairs bathroom. Instead of testing Castiel's promise to count the tiles on the wall or whatever, Dean’s crouched on the floor installing a new sink. “There’s been a bunch of demon signs in Jefferson City.”
“I was distracting her so he could!” Dean yells. Sam keeps looking at him. “He couldn’t do anything until that bitch—fine, damn it, maybe you’re right. I wish you’d never brought me here. Okay, so Sue Ann’s controlling him. How do we break it or whatever?”
Elijah releases Layla’s hand and extricates himself from Mrs. Rourke’s presence without a word. He spares Dean one more incalculable look when he walks past him. He steps around Sue Ann and into the house and she closes the door behind her, leaving them outside in the rain.
He chokes a little, impressed. “How’d you know it was me?”
“I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition,” he answers automatically. Dean’s anxiety over the words coming from his own mouth threatens to expel Castiel completely. He holds tightly onto their shared body with a pair of his wings until Dean ease the tension in his body.
“God blessed us by sending Elijah here, and we’ve been able to share that blessing with others,” Roy finishes.
Le Grange steps back up to the pulpit and picks up where he left off, diving into the immorality of homosexuality with the earnest fervor of a true believer. Dean’s skin crawls, but there’s a thrill of satisfaction in knowing he’s exactly what they’re preaching against one way or another, even if he doesn’t swing that way.
Dean finished eating and set the tray aside. “I dunno. I look at my life and all I see is the money I’ve thrown at it over the years. Clothes, and a ridiculous house. Three cars, a boat I never even use. What the fuck am I doing?”
“Thanks.”
Overcome, Cas simply nodded.
. “Actually, Lisa, can he just stay? I ordered groceries and I was going to come get clothes tomorrow for him and I dunno, I just--”
“Just uh - thinking about my old life.”
Overwhelmed, all Dean could do was nod. He picked at his sandwich, his mind turning Aaron’s words over.
Her voice faded to a buzzing sound in his ears. Some type of gel was brushed along his forehead, patterns drawn across his bare chest. A rough voice chanted in a guttural language and the words made Dean's skin crawl as realized that he was strapped down, his ankles and wrists bound to a flat surface. Panic set in rapidly and he fought against the bonds.
“I want to...as a thanks, I guess,” Dean said sheepishly.
“Actually,” Charlie smiled, “I’d be happy to help you with that, so Dean and Cas can chat for a minute.”
“Ok. I’ll go get my coat and meet you outside.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m being overbearing, aren't I?” Cas’s face fell again.
How long would Dean’s voice continue to haunt him?
“No, we have joint custody.” Dean added some bananas to his order. “Just Lisa has him more.”
Jacob waved him off. “Come, let’s get this hay out to the field and then we’ll head up to the house for lunch.” He leaned in closer and grinned. “My Lyddie’s making fried chicken today.”
“Yeah, well maybe you’re not.” Dean stared down at his coffee cup. “Maybe you’re just not there yet.”
He’d dreamt about Cas the night before. Wasn’t even a raunchy sex dream. No, he’d dreamt about taking a walk through a pretty park and enjoying a picnic. The dream was so fucking sappy, he’d woken up just as he and Cas were feeding each other little pies, hands clasped together. It was absolutely ridiculous.
Lydia cut the pies into slices, putting one each of the pecan and apple on Cas’s plate. “You haven’t even had the pie yet,” she smiled.
Fuck both of them they did nothing I asked them to do in this chapter.
Cas smiled indulgently at him and damn, Dean wanted to see that smile everyday. He turned to pull Dean’s coat from the closet. “I’m just waiting for Claire. She’s with Hannah. As soon as she’s ready, we can go.”
“I can’t go on a hunt without them! They’re my favorites!” He dug through the pile of shirts on the bed. “Can’t find my Zepp shirt either.”
“Ok,” Claire said. She dropped her parka in a chair and headed up the stairs.
“Somebody is a dickhead,” Cas shot back. “And hasn’t even had the grace to make me coffee yet.”
“He does love pie.” Cas stared down into his almost empty mug. “Yes, I was thinking about Dean. But I don’t want to talk about him.”
“Not to be a dick, dude, but pretty much everyone can see it. It’s not like you’re hiding it.” Vic sat up too. “Guess I ruined this, huh?”
“Hmm.” Dean glanced over at Cas and immediately did a double take, because Cas was giving him the most intense look. “I uh--I’m fine with you doing it, since it’s a closer shave.”
“As have I,” Aaron added, laughing.
“Did you get the address?”
“And it’s so
“Always did love your pastrami,” Dean grinned. “Bet you put bacon on it, too.”
“You’re so pale. And Cas said you almost died.”
“Well, as Trixie would tell you, Hello Kitty is Queen.”
“This isn’t new. I told you all this the night you left.”
“Cas. Dude, I’m fine. Stop.”
“Because you’re kind of murdering that magazine?”
Cas sighed and ran a hand through his hair, scratching along his horns. “I still don’t like it. Father is right, however. I have no right to deny you this.” He smiled at Dean. “But you’re flying with me.”
Cain dropped Cas and Dean off at the door of Minato Sushi and went to park his ridiculous truck.
“Thank you. You are, too. Honestly, other than Jimmy, you’re the closest friend I’ve ever had.”
“Yeah. Let’s go.”
“Oh no, sorry. Let’s try it like this,” Cas said, taking the pipe back. He took another deep drag, and before Dean really knew what was happening, his lips were millimeters from Cas’s as Cas exhaled into his face. Shocked, he sucked in the smoke from Cas’s lungs. He didn’t cough. He stared at Cas, still holding his breath.
“John?” Cas asked.
“My baby has been there for me since the very beginning,” Dean said proudly.
The water was comfortably hot and smelled of the lavender, sage, rosemary, and tea tree they’d added. Cas waded into the water up his waist and gently lowered Dean, still cradling him in his arms. The second the water flowed over the ugly, blackened bite mark, Dean made a noise of distress.
“I thought you’d be more into Butcher, to be perfectly honest,” Cas said. “He seems more your type.”
It almost felt like -
“Are you feeling ok?”
“Good timing, sweetheart,” Mary said kindly, placing a cool, damp cloth on his head. “The bakery is closed on Mondays, so I’ll be here to look after you until my lovesick son gets here.”
No. No, Cas needed more. He wanted a lifetime with Dean. He just had no idea how to express those feelings without destroying the best friendship he’d ever had. A burning sensation filled his eyes and he blinked away tears. Was he really this foolish? Mourning a relationship that didn’t exist in the first place?
Cas’s fingers trailed down his cheek, and Dean’s lips parted. “It is much smoother like this,” Cas murmured.
“An Englischer staying with Amish indefinitely is mighty strange,” Daniel offered. “But it wouldn’t be the first time. I can’t imagine this service was all that interesting for you, being in Pennsylvania Dutch and German.”
In the shower, they washed the come from each other’s bodies.
THREE YEARS LATER
“Dean, you broke your dominant arm. It’s ok to ask me to help. I don’t mind, especially after you cared for me when I had the flu.”
“Uncle Cas, can we--” Claire stopped. “Uh, are you ok?”
“That would be awesome.”
“Because Zeke said the angels are hunting you. Some douche named Bartholomew is building an army -”
“Just let it go, Sam. Ok?”
Sam knocked on the door at some point. “Dean, you ok?” he asked through the door, raising his voice over Otis Redding’s.
Charlie stuck her tongue out. “I get that,
“Oh, my boy. I think you do.”
Yah - Yes
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mmm.” Cas turned Dean’s head to the left and carefully dragged the razor over his cheek. “I can’t imagine it’s going to be easy to play piano.”
“Ok,” Charlie said, worry evident in her voice.
By noon, Dean had disappointed multiple students who wanted to sign his cast--there just wasn’t enough room on it for everyone--so Anna, goddess that she was, drew a huge pink cast on a large sheet of paper and hung it outside of Dean’s classroom. Throughout the day, teachers brought their classes to sign it. The kids were extremely interested in the nature of his injury but didn’t seem the least bit impressed when he told them it happened because he fell over another skater.
Cas looked down at the Reader’s Digest crumpled in his hands. “Oh.” He let it fall beside him on the couch. “Anyway, what were you about to ask me?”
“Yeah, uh - ok.” Dean mumbled. “Make sure you get Kevin vegetarian. He’ll be back from Branson tonight.”
“He’s becoming a demon,” Michael, Cas’s older brother, said softly. “You’re losing him.”
, Cas. You belong with us.”
“Yes ‘cause he says I can’t call him Mr. Novak at home, ‘cause it’s weird, so he said call him Uncle Cas like Claire does.”
Crossing his arms over his chest, Cas thought for a moment, Dean watching him with bated breath. Finally, he said, “I have a home here. I have my own rooms, I have three hot meals a day, I have friends who respect me and appreciate my presence.”
He finished his tea and wallowed in his misery, watching as the sunny cold January afternoon turned wet. Clouds rolled in and the sky opened up, dumping rain on his Continental. Sighing, he pulled out a few singles and left them on the table, throwing Aaron and Jo a weak smile and half hearted wave as he departed.
The evening was spent watching
“Are you sure? I don’t believe your friend Owen would appreciate that.”
“I’m sorry?”
stupid cute assholes i hate them
Then he noticed that Dean wasn’t alone.
Frowning, Cas sat down. “Is that your custody agreement?”
Laying on his side, Cas tried to clear his thoughts and settle down.
Dick’s visit couldn’t end soon enough. The man truly lived up to his name, and Dean felt sorry for Bobby. He was the store manager, after all, and all of that shit rolled onto him. Dean, as the assistant store manager, would be told later what needed to be fixed, but Bobby would never shift the blame. Bobby was the best boss Dean had ever had - he always stood between the Biggerson’s staff and the upper management.
“I feel like a part of your family sometimes.”
“But it doesn’t make any sense! If this Bartholomew is really building an army, then we should be protecting Cas not pushing him away!”
But yeah. Fuck Dean and Cas.
“Don’t get dressed on my account,” Cain purred, eyes sweeping apprecitively over Cas’s body.
It had just been a nightmare, after all.
Dean gasped and grinned. “I love you, too.”
“I know, but they’re dirty and I know for a fact those Scooby boxers are
Cas unpacked their lunch on Dean’s desk, carefully opening containers and setting them in front of Dean. He pulled out a can of coke and opened it. Cas laid a folded napkin next to Dean’s lunch and put his silverware down.
“Enough, Owen,” Jacob said gently, helping Cas down the side of the truck. “Just finish getting this unloaded and see Aaron, he’ll settle with you. Come, Steve.”
“Your mom came to take Claire to buy personal items, bless her. I wouldn’t even know where to start.”
hearts up for
“I dunno. I want adventure, yeah, but I just feel like,” she looped an arm through Dean’s and smiled up at Sam. “I feel like I’m needed here. What do you guys think about me staying for a while?”
“He’s like a baby bird and you kicked him out of the nest! I expected better from you, Dean Winchester!”
Ach - doesn't really have a meaning, just kinda of a Ah or Oh kind of thing. Like Ach, Cas you're a gut helper would be like Oh, Cas, you're a good helper.
, he thought,
Dean’s heart warmed his whole body. “Aw, that’s--that’s cute.”
“I understand. I’m going to see Dean.” Castiel left the courtyard, following Dean’s pleasing scent up the hallway to his rooms.
“I--I--”
The service ended with silent prayer, the entire congregation mobilizing afterwards to break down the benches and set up tables for lunch. Baskets of cold cuts and pie were brought out, plates and cups of juice were passed. Cas found himself seated between Jacob and the Bishop.
Dean didn’t respond. He climbed back into bed and rolled onto his belly, burying his face in the pillow, squeezing his eyes closed tightly, wishing that Cas’s face would fade from his memory.
“Sooner if I can get someone to hire me now. Gotta redo my resume.”
“Fuck this,” he muttered, sitting up. He’d go home and sleep in his own bed and make his excuses to Dean in the morning.
Rolling onto his side, Cas curled into the fetal position, tugging his blankets close around him. He just wanted to go back to sleep and forget what he’d seen.
The relief on Claire’s face was evident. “Can you ask Mary please?”
“Yup. Come outside on the patio with me. This’ll definitely help you relax.”
“Yeah, I got through a shower. I want to say no, I don’t need you to help me get dressed, but I probably do. I think it’s just gonna be a polo and hoodie today. Not trying to get into a button down.”
“I fought for you. I fought Adler to keep you when he wanted to can your ass a month ago.” Crowley dropped into a chair.
“Yeah, especially if this gets much worse. I appreciate the invitation.”
To the Tropefest mods - you guys are the best. Thanks for letting me play!
Dean snored. It was a soft sound, but it was there nonetheless. He lay on his left side, the cast on his right propped on a pillow.
“I’m here,” Jacob announced. Another man came in with him and sat across from Cas. “This is Aaron Lapp. He’s my hired hand.”
“Actually, I just moved in with someone. We’ve been together about a year.”
“So uh - can I share?” Aaron finally asked.
“Leese, he can stay as long as necessary, ok?”
“Jesus!” Dean startled, splashing beer all over himself.
“What was that all about?” Cas asked, leading the way back down the hall towards his room.
After a great weekend watching Jess and Sam get married, going back to work Monday was the ultimate downer. As expected, work was terrible that morning. Tuesday was no better, and when lunch rolled around, all Dean wanted to do was get the hell out, so he left his food in the fridge and walked across the street to a sandwich shop. He ordered falafel on pita, not even really aware that he was ordering a vegan lunch.
“Uncle Cas, I can’t find my sneakers!” Claire’s irritated voice carried up the stairs and both men jumped.
“Dean…”
“C’mon, get up. Get changed.”
“Dean -”
“I’m just saying,” Charlie held her hands up, “maybe don’t go in there all Captain Kirk, phasers armed and ready. Maybe talk to him, feel him out. You can’t just show up and demand he come home. You get me?”
Dean sat at his desk, staring out the window as snow swirled in the air. Outside his door, he could hear the ruckus of the children getting ready to leave two hours early. He was waiting for Sam to come get him and Cas, since neither of their cars were fit for snow days. Sam always picked them up and took them home in his fancy hybrid SUV in bad weather.
“Indeed.”
“Date that bad?”
“You plan to leave me here?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said. “Been lookin’ everywhere for you, man.”
“Charlie, he gave the last name Winchester. He’s ready to come home, obviously.” Dean wrenched open the car door. “I’m going to go get him.”
Cas felt his cheeks flush.
“It’s complicated. And I’m fine, by the way. Not moping.” Dean tugged the fitted sheet over the bottom corner of Charlie’s mattress. “He’s not here. He’s got his own thing and he’s not here.” Dean finished making the bed and stood up straight. Charlie was glaring at him, hands on her hips. “What?”
“Yes?”
“Are you alright? You look a little pale.” Cas raised an eyebrow as he studied Dean. He held out a pink box from Mary’s bakery. “Doughnut?”
“I do. We all shared a house…” Cas trailed off, his eyes filling with tears. “The night they died. I got home just as they were - as the firemen were -” He couldn’t get any other words out, overwhelmed with the images of the firemen pulling the black body bags from the house. “I miss them,” he whispered.
Cas was on the right side of the bed, Dean on the left, with Dean’s body turned away from him. Cas lay on his back, watching the headlights on Holabird Avenue make odd patterns as cars drove past. He didn’t know what to do. Dean asked him to stay, half asleep and maybe more than a little tipsy, and Cas couldn’t tell him no. That
He was starting to feel wonderfully floaty and peaceful. “Can I try?” he asked, reaching for the pipe. Cas nodded and handed it over and Dean took a deep, long drag. He held the smoke in his lungs, thrilled to be able to do it without coughing. Then, Cas was at his lips again, expectant, waiting for Dean to exhale. So he did. Cas sucked it all down, holding it for a moment before let the smoke go.
The bunker trembles mightily and he shoots to his feet, heart pounding in his chest. The voice is soft and comes to him from far away.
So I'm back! Gotta tell you, after so long I'm not sure if I even know what I'm doing anymore. I can't tell if this chapter is good or not. I dunno. I hope you enjoy it!
“I will.”
“He will. He called for while you recovered from your flight. Dean wants you very much. Don’t concern yourself with that, Castiel.” She set the embroidery aside and reached for his hand, rubbing her soft fingers over his palm. “When is that last time you’ve eaten?”
“I’ll leave you alone.” Cas looked like his dog had died.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Cas crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Cain, who responded with a cavalier grin and cocked eyebrow.
“You really thought it was that simple?”
“If that’s what you want.”
“I haven’t decided yet. The Beiler’s have been incredibly kind and have made me that offer, but I’m still unsure whether it’s the right decision for me - or them. If I stayed, it would continue to be an unusual arrangement, since I have no plans to convert.”
“No I don’t.”
Rolling over to face his husband, Dean pushed an unruly strand of hair off Cas’s face. “Love ya, grumpy,” he smiled, before kissing the attitude away. Cas responded enthusiastically to his kiss and it wasn’t long before they were both raring and ready to go.
Leaning in seemed inevitable, so Dean did, eyes fluttering shut.
Cas groaned. “Goddammit.” He scooted in closer, tight against Dean’s back. Morning wood made itself known and Dean couldn’t suppress a giggle.
“No, no, don’t be sorry. Like I told you before, you didn’t do anything wrong. You just got sick. It’s ok.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Dean protested.
“That explains so much,” Dean mused, letting his body fall back into the pillows. “But -” his eyes filled with tears again. “If Sam’s king, then Dad is -”
Anyway, hope you enjoy. Maybe I can get back to regular updates. We'll see. <3
They stared at each other, frozen. Dean didn’t know what to say.
“I’m fine. Get some rest, alright?”
Dean brandished a thermometer and slid it under Cas’s tongue. “Ok. Let’s take your temp and get you back in bed.” Whatever the thermometer said when it beeped, Dean didn’t like it, judging by the depth of his frown. “Cas, if you get much worse, I’m taking you to Bayview. You’re scaring the shit out me with this fever. 102.8 is way too fucking high.”
“It’s not him so much, I guess. Maybe it’s both of us.”
Cas’s frown grew deeper, and he tapped his chin with a forefinger, clearly deep in thought. “I’ve got an idea,” he said finally. “I’ll be right back.”
“Where’s Dean?”
“Oh,” Lydia sipped her tea. “You’re a very educated young man, aren’t you?”
“Fuck, Cas, need you so bad.”
“Do you want me to stay and help you get dressed? Were you able to shower?”
“Thanks. Uh, so - can I take you out? Maybe tomorrow night?”
“What was that all about?” Dean asked Charlie, confused.
Dean laughed. “We’ll get there. Back in a bit.” He ducked out of the room.
“Sorry, man, I didn’t see you there.” Victor reached down and picked up Dean’s things.
“Alright, we’re ready. Let’s go,” Cas said, unaware of the brotherly teasing happening as he lifted Dean’s bag from the desk. “Sam, you’re also welcome for dinner, although I’m guessing you’d like to get home to Jess.”
Dean blushed.
Tension racheted up to eleven in that little bathroom, and Dean was utterly aware of how undressed he was, in nothing but his boxers and ratty grey bathrobe. He couldn’t look away from Cas’s blue gaze, his brain on autopilot and filing away every different hue in Cas’s eyes. He was so gorgeous and standing there just staring at Dean like that? He couldn’t help it--a rush of heat shot up his spine and Dean held his breath, not sure what was going to happen next.
Back in his room, he settled under the quilts again, trying to push Dean’s face and words away long enough to sleep. But sleep never came, and when the rooster crowed, Cas dragged himself from his bed, as tired as if he’d never slept at all.
“I brought you here. King Alastair bit you over my claim. Dean - remember when you told me that things didn’t seem right with your father? You were correct. Your father was possessed, Sir Benny, too. King Alastair’s captain of the guard, Azazel, had taken your father.”
“Hey, Dean?”
“Just don’t be abusin’ his kindness,” Owen spat, “Or -”
“Can I share your table, dude? There aren’t any free ones.”
“Dean, I feel fine! Why do we have to keep going over this? I’m fine.”
“Hey, kid, it’s alright. I know he still wants you. You two - you’re trues. It’s not something that happens often.” Dean didn’t respond. “Anyway. There’s a tray here with a little broth and bread, some tea. Keep it light for now. I’ll be back in a bit.”
“Cas,” he chokes out, the words clogging his throat. He wants to scream for the angel, beg him to free him from this prison Michael has created in his mind.
“Totally. He’s probably in my office using his art table.”
“Alright.” Taking Dean’s glass with him, Cas wandered to the bar.
“Let me be clear, Steve. Lydia and I know you’re running from something - or someone. We know you have no place to go, no family. But you’re welcome here. You don’t have to tell us what happened to you or where you’ve been, just be honest, work hard, and don’t give us reason to regret bringing you in. That’s all. Got a roof over your head and Lydia’s fine cooking. You’re safe here.”
Which is why he was standing in his bathroom glaring down at the razor laying innocuously on his sink.
“It’s my home!”
Frustrated and not paying attention to his surroundings, Dean turned a corner and crashed into a hard body. He dropped his lunch bag and stumbled backwards.
Un-beta'd like WHOA
“And mac’n’cheese!”
“Are you ok?”
Dean was starting to seriously develop feelings for Cas. And that was nothing short of dangerous. Yeah, they were great friends. They did everything together, shared food and rides to work, and lived next door to each other. And while that was great, and awesome, it was also potentially troublesome. Because if Dean ever got brave enough to admit to Cas that he hadn’t slept with anyone else since the day they’d met, if he admitted that he couldn’t think of anyone but Cas, if he finally manned up enough to tell Cas he loved him and it all went sideways -
“It’s no trouble. I’m happy to take both of you.”
“Hey Leese.”
“You’re a wonderful mother,” he told her at one point, sure that he must’ve been imagining the tears in her eyes.
To the incredible beta crew - Colleen, Alyse, Lara, and Janne, but especially Jini, who knew I was capable of much better work and pushed and prodded. What you're reading is a better fic because of Jini. She really pushed me to do my best and it shows. Love you, Wifey <3
Dean pushed through the doors, heading straight for the Impala. “We’ll go to the motel, pack up, and head up to Rushford. We can get Cas back and head back to Lebanon and take care of the Sam situation -”
Grunting an affirmative, Dean continued staring at the coffee maker. “Ben was up barfing all night.”
“I’m good, dude. Let’s eat.”
“Alright,” Dean said, barely suppressing a yawn. He dozed off in the warmth and comfort of Cas’s arms.
“Never showed me your shirt,” Dean muttered, as Cas pretty much tucked him in.
Then Cain winked at him as he made his way around the truck and ruined Cas’s briefly good mood. Cas waited for Dean to get settled in the middle spot and then stared sulkily out the window as Cain drove them into the city. Cain and Dean kept up pleasant conversation on the drive to the restaurant, and while Dean definitely tried to involve Cas in the discussion, Cain didn’t, and Cas wasn’t really interested anyway.
“I don’t see it.”
“Cas, wait -”
“Daddy, Steve’s head went thump thump when he fell.” Ben looked so concerned and Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing.
“But your rig is loud, Owen,” the one guy laughed.
“Bedroom?” Vic growled, attacking Dean’s neck.
“Oops,” Charlie giggled.
“Dean.”
His whole arm ached. Six weeks in, two weeks post elbow surgery, and Dean was completely over it--over the pain, over the cast, over not being able to shower or play piano or do
“My name. It’s not Steve. It’s Cas. Castiel.”
Tucked into a booth at the Broadway Diner, Dean amused Cas with exaggerated stories of Sam’s wide eyed awe at his tiny daughter. “I am going to spoil that kid so hard. She’s gonna have Hello Kitty everything!”
“You look annoyed as shit,” Sam said as he walked into Dean’s classroom.
“Oh god I don’t know why I--you do?”
“I understand.”
Cas licked his dry lips. “Yes, it would. And a shower.”
“Yeah, but Sam was going to--”
he thought.
“Alright, then. I’ll stay, if you truly don’t mind.”
“The pool is ready,” Gabriel announced as he entered the room. “Hey, Cassie.”
Dean shook his head. “Get in the car, Charlie, or I’ll leave you here.” He slid into the driver's seat and shut the door. Charlie got in as he started the car, arms crossed over her chest and a stormy look on her face. “We’re going to get him,” Dean told her firmly. “And I’ll talk to him, and listen to what he has to say, but I’m sure he’ll want to come back with us. Ok?”
He feels Cas step closer and a low whine slips out of his throat. Dean can hear the sound of papers shuffling behind him and knows Cas is looking through the pictures. Whipping around, he quickly kneels near Cas, hiding the pictures as best he can. “Don’t,” he rasps, pulling them away and trying to shove them out of sight.
Aaron looked good, too. He was wearing a navy blue shirt under a maroon sweater vest, the sleeves of the shirt rolled halfway up his arms. His beard was neatly trimmed and he had a bit of a tan. He looked healthy and happy.
“Right there!” Ben said, pointing excitedly towards the front window. “Then everyone can see it!”
“Well, I had a lot of fun but I didn’t get to see you dance. And I wouldn’t mind seeing Meg again.”
Cas walked in, struggling with his ratty old trench and his messenger bag. “It’s snowing pretty hard and the kids got sent home early. I think it’s likely.”
, Cas thought.
>>Yum! Thanks, buddy.
Cas smiled. “Sleep well, Dean.” He turned to go, stopped by Dean’s hand on his arm. “Dean?”
“Oh no, buddy, I’m not mad at you,” Dean looked distressed.
“Not Owen’s business what I do on my own farm.”
Cas chuckled. “I’m good.”
“I can’t believe you didn’t hear me come in. I wasn’t quiet.” He walked the bottle out to the kitchen, coming back with a hand towel as Dean sat up, holding perfectly still as Cas dabbed all the beer off his shirt. “I came to see if you wanted a snack or help getting ready for bed.”
“No. You have to eat, I don’t care how you feel,” Charlie hissed. “Dig in, Handmaiden. You’re eating. I’ll feed you myself if I have to.”
“What the actual fuck,” he grumbled, throwing back the blanket. He knew it wasn’t Cas--Cas had stopped knocking a long time ago, since he had his own key.
They lapsed into silence again. Dr. Sexy cornered Nurse Elena in the elevator and she slapped him.
“Really?” Cas looked surprised. “Not even in college?”
“You don’t have to sit here with me in the loser’s corner, y’know? I see Jess’s friend, Sarah, checking you out. You could ask her to dance. I mean - you’re gay and all, but even gay dudes can enjoy a dance with a pretty girl.”
“Don’t wanna get up,” Dean whined into the pillow.
“Love thy neighbor, Owen. He’s hungry.” Jacob turned back to Castiel. “You are hungry, aren’t you?”
“I don’t know what to call Dean. Gramma Mary said maybe I should call him Daddy, but I think she was just joking around and that’s weird. I don’t call you Daddy.”
Daadi Haus - Granparents' house
“I’m hungry,” Dean said, abruptly letting go and hurrying to the buffet tables.
Sir Benny stepped forward with a roll of parchment in his hand. “Received this when the army first showed up. This is their demands.”
“Yes,” Cas said firmly, and didn’t offer anything else.
“I did. And you kinda were. But I wasn’t blameless either. I refused to meet you where you were, or even try to come to an understanding as to why you were working so much. A partnership is supposed to be exactly that - partners working together for a common goal. You worked too much, fine. But I wasn’t willing to work on us at all. We weren’t good for each other. It’s no one’s fault. And you still deserve to be happy and find someone. Ok?”
Turning his head, he saw Dean perched in an uncomfortable looking chair. “Dean? Where am I?”
I cannot promise I'm back to regular updates, because 2020 has sucked the life out of me writing wise, but anyway. Have a chapter. If you're still here, I love you. If you're new here, I will do my best to give you a finished fic. I outlined it today, I know where it's going...we'll see. <3 <3
“Do you need more water?”
“It’s Friday night. Claire just went to Kat’s for a sleepover. I was going to see if you wanted to go to the Crazy Cajun. I know you can’t really drink, but last time, we didn’t really get to enjoy it together and--”
“Ok.”
“Cas -”
“Alright.” That intense look was still there as Cas took a step towards Dean.
When it was over, Dorothy invited Charlie to join her in Oz. Dean stared down at the floor as Dorothy opened the portal, his heart aching. He’d just lost Cas and now he was about to watch another friend walk away from him.
“He’s not the only one who likes vegetarian,” Sam complained.
“Did you take your pain meds?”
“Dean?”
Castiel hesitated outside.
“I want Gushers!” Ben yelled on his way up the stairs.
“Yeah, ok, but I don’t know what kind or what to buy or--”
Cas shouldered his bag, wincing at the sharp pain that traveled up his arm. “Thank you for the ride,” he said quietly to Owen.
Castiel took the hand Jacob offered him, letting the man pull him from the hay. “You’re very kind. There aren’t enough kind people in this world.”
“Babe? What’s with the trenchcoat, it’s like ninety outside. And what are you doing here? Did you ditch work?” Climbing down the ladder with the tool in one hand, he pulled Cas in for a sweet kiss. “Not that I’m not happy to see you -”
Rolling his eyes, Cas moved around the room, turning lights on and pulling out materials. “I’ll set aside a turkey project for Ben if you’d like to take it home for him.”
Cas went home and plopped on his couch, scowling when he heard Cain’s truck pull up. He could hear piano music coming through the wall and imagined Cain and Dean seated cozily at Dean’s antique piano, smiling and laughing together and god, he longed to be in Cain’s place.
“Great. Text me your address and I’ll pick you up around seven?”
“Like being in your arms,” Cas murmured. “You’re so strong.”
Thank you so much for reading, and thank you to the wonderful mods. I really enjoyed this challenge!!
“I am
“That’s three words, but you’re right.” Aaron’s phone chimed and he looked at it, sighing as he read the message. “Dean, I have to go. It was really great to see you again.” He stood and Dean stood as well, not the least surprised when Aaron stepped around the table and pulled him into a hug.
“What? I don’t have it bad for Cas, what the fuck?” Dean sat straight up and scooched back against the headboard. “Who says I have it bad for Cas?”
Dean whimpered and tried to pull away, pressing closer to Castiel as he tried to escape the hot, salty water. The more Kali poured the water over Dean, the more he fought, struggling in Cas’s arms, barely conscious and terrified. His body shook, spasms running through his arms and legs as he fought Castiel.
Leaning over, Dean kissed his cheek. “This is why I love you.”
Heed the new rating.
It was like a dam broke and Dean shoved Cas’s coat from his shoulders. “This stupid black trench, so hot, Cas you don’t even know.” Cognizant of Dean’s arm, Cas pushed him up the stairs, leaving a trail of clothes in their wake. They shared increasingly filthy kisses on their journey up the stairs and by the time he carefully tumbled Dean onto his big bed, they’d managed to lose 90% of their clothes. Dean’s skin was hot enough to burn pressed against Cas’s own as he pulled him down on top of him with his left arm.
“She’s early,” Dean said, the worry evident in his voice.
Dean yawned, staring blankly at the Cracker Barrel menu in his hand. Charlie was typing furiously on her phone, bright eyed and bushy tailed, having gotten a full eight hours while Dean worried, tossing and turning all night.
“It’s not safe -”
“I should’ve spoken up.”
“I don’t have
Dean bit his bottom lip. Fuck, how many times had he used that exact same reasoning to get someone into bed? Funny how it didn’t feel so good to be on the other end.
,” Jacob told her, eyes full of love. “I married the best cook in Alleghany County,” Jacob explained to Cas. He patted his round belly. “And I’ve benefitted mightily.”
Cas’s grip on the bag tightened for a moment, but looking into Lydia’s kind brown eyes, he realized she truly meant him no harm and handed over the duffle.
Grievous abuse of Enochian (I almost scrapped this but I couldn't bring myself to cut it.)
Dean blushed and Cas sure as hell didn’t know how to respond, so he just mumbled a quiet thanks. His phone buzzed in his hand. “Dean, your mom says to pick Claire up as soon as I possibly can--they’re at her house.”
Dean ran his left hand through his hair. “I just--we’ve been doing this for a while and things are set and I don’t want to rock the boat.”
“Fine.”
“Your washin’. Clean your clothes.”
The warmth of the kitchen and their companionable silence comforted Cas, adding to that growing feeling of home. Lydia’s cinnamon buns were moist and delicious, delectable cream cheese icing soaking into every cinnamon laced nook and cranny.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s neck, breathing in his scent. He buried his face, trying very hard to fight back the second round of tears that were threatening. If this was the last time he’d get to have this, he wasn’t going to let his tears ruin the moment.
Cas turned his head towards the window of the smelly Greyhound Bus, watching as the countryside whizzed by, eyes following rain droplets as they trailed down the glass.
and he’ll never look at Dean the same again.
“Alright then, Cas. Let’s go get some of Lydia’s chicken.” Jacob patted Cas’s shoulder and turned towards the house, like it didn’t matter that Castiel had lied to him.
It’s almost a whisper, a soft susurrus of words not quite formed. Maybe he’s just imagining it.
“Hey, what are you getting?”
“They’re expensive. Everything I own is expensive. I’m high maintenance, Cas.”
Wait. Love? Dean stared at the back of Cas’s head as they walked down the hall and his heart skipped a beat.
Cain was ridiculously attractive, Cas could at least admit that. But Cain was also so manly, fit, and probably just Dean’s type. Considering Cas knew a bunch of the people Dean had been with--Victor, Benny--it seemed as far as men went, Cain seemed to be exactly Dean’s type.
“Alright then, c’mon down and let's get you to my wife. She’ll have something to put in your belly.”
Castiel flew as fast as his wings would carry him, stopping every hour to make Dean drink some water or force a potion down his throat if he was in pain. A trip that should have taken two days took one, since he didn’t stop for rest. Landing in the courtyard of his father’s palace, he set Dean carefully on the ground before transforming.
“I know, and I appreciate it, but I’ve got things to do, and you can go and catch up with Cain.” Cas inched towards the back door as he made his excuses.
“Why?”
Cas closed his eyes and bit his bottom lip, anything to fight the threatening tears. Mary stood and leaned down and kissed his forehead.
“No. Shut up and listen. I loved you. I loved you a lot and I fell in love with you because you’re one of the kindest, most self-sacrificing people I’ve ever met. If there’s anyone in this world who deserves happiness, it’s you.”
“I will.” Aaron stepped out of the hug, holding Dean by the shoulders. “Listen, if you like this guy, go for it. You’re a good man, one of the best I’ve ever known, actually.”
“I love you,” Cas blurted out.
Three hours later, after meeting Isabella Mary Winchester for the first time, Cas was driving a jubilant Dean home just after 1am.
“But what if she gets pissed off and sues me for full custody?”
“Dean -”
“Dean?”
Cas was right. He was stressed. His skin felt itchy, too big for his body. Dean’s entire being throbbed with an unknown restlessness. He didn’t know how to sate it. All he really wanted was to pass out and sleep.
“Ok,” Ben said sleepily. “I get to be here a long time?”
“Well, I was kinda square at KU, and super focused on grades at MIT, so no, Cas, I’ve never done pot.”
“I’m not an angel anymore! I can’t fix what you break.”
command. He nodded and walked over to Dean.
So the first two chapters of this fic have been in my "unfinished business" folder since DCBB 2014. This was supposed to be my DCBB that year, but as has happened every year since I joined fandom, I failed to submit a finished DCBB and dropped out. This year, I started writing a DCBB but didn't like the story. I was going through that folder and found this and was like YES THIS but Tropefest. And now here we are.
“Hang on, love,” he said softly, brushing his lips across Dean’s forehead. He followed Gabriel and Kali through the open air corridors of the palace to a glassed in room that contained the bubbling mineral pool.
“No you’re not.”
Cas pulled the blankets away to get up but was immediately stopped by a solid arm flopping over his midsection and the discomfort of a cast shoved against his back.
“I know.”
Sam found the flyer at the local gas station and presented it to Dean over breakfast. “You should enter. It’s a pretty decent cash prize, and the Impala is definitely the sweetest of the Sweet Rides.”
Dean opened the door to a room and waved Charlie inside, tossing her a pillow and the pillowcase. “Cas is Cas - off doing his thing.”
“I love going to Kat’s!” Claire informed him.
“Aw, don’t get all embarrassed. Not your fault you’re hotter than hell.” Aaron took another big bite while staring at Dean, looking like maybe he wanted to take a bite of Dean instead.
“Did you eat? You need to eat. I made dinner, there’s plenty left. C’mon, get up and come downstairs. Maybe change into something more comfortable. I don’t recommend sleeping in suits.”
Kat blushed. “Wish someone else saw it that way.”
The room spun a little when he looked up to see Donna, Charlie, Bobby, and Ellen all heading into the room. Within minutes, Donna declared him to have a fever of 101.9, Bobby was on the phone looking for a sub, and Charlie was leading him out of the room to Donna’s office. Dean was on the phone making arrangements for Mary to come pick Cas up, and before Cas could do much of anything, he was home in bed.
shirt with a hole in one armpit. Vader was damn near invisible after a million and a half washings, but nothing Dean owned felt more like a hug than that stupid shirt.
“Nothing really. Just that you might not be interested.” Vic paused his ministrations and stopped to look up at Dean. “But you’re plenty interested, right? And you play the field like I do? Like we both know what we’re gettin’ out of this. Just some fun, no strings attached? I ain’t looking for a relationship.”
“Dean?”
She didn't look convinced. Dean sighed. Zipping the duffel shut, he tossed it over his shoulder. “You ready?”
Danki - thank you
Castiel sat in the back of Becky and Jeremiah Yoder’s house, listening to Bishop Daniel Hostetler preach a sermon entirely in German. Grateful that his full understanding of every language on earth hadn’t departed with his grace, Cas soaked in the reverent service as the Bishop spoke about the importance of Baptism.
“No.”
Dean looked up, a frisson of fear dancing up his spine. “I honored your demands,” he said softly.
Dean stared down at his feet. “You uh, you look good, Cas.”
“Cas?”
“I speak many languages,” Castiel told them.
“Why?”
And to you guys - for every kudos and comment over five long years (!!!!), y'all are the best part of writing fics. Thank you so much. <3
“Dean--”
Cas picks it up, too. He studies both closer and God, can Dean just die? Like right now, just take him, let it be over. The things he feels for Cas are so raw, so edged with misery because he knows - he knows that Cas would never want him like that, Dean knows it, and if this is the real Cas, if it’s really his friend. Ugh. Cas knows. Cas
“Oh, sweetheart.”
“No worries.” Victor smiled, and a ray of sunlight created sparkles in his eyes.
Cas looked back at him with a raised eyebrow. “That whole thing just now between you and Gabe.”
Giving sleep up for a lost cause, he pulled on a pair of fluffy socks and his hoodie, lit a lamp, and crossed through the doorway into Lydia and Jacob’s house. As quietly as possible, he fixed himself a cup of tea, stirring in a spoonful of lavender blossom honey from Lydia’s stash. He settled at the table with his mug. There was the sound of quiet footsteps on the stairs, and Lydia herself entered the kitchen, her hair bound in one long braid down the middle of her back. “Can’t sleep?”
The back door opened and Cas let himself and Claire in, a crock pot in one arm. “I’ve got dinner. Did I see Lisa?”
for death. He felt like his skin was on fire, like he was being turned inside out and flayed with barbed wire.
“Don’t get me wrong, I am down with Billy Butcher, and you all know how much I love Karl Urban, just, I dunno. Homelander can get it.”
“It is delicious. I haven’t had a full meal in days.” Cas looked down at his empty plate. “I appreciate the kindness.”
“She’s a good guy!” Charlie shrieked, tossing a handful of popcorn at Dean.
“Ooh, pay up, Milton,” Charlie giggled as her and Gabe walked into the room. “We have a love confession!”
Gabriel frowned. “I said that should be a last resort.”
“No, I’m fine,” Cas protested.
“I have a headache.”
Cas turned and started walking back towards the house. “That’s all I am to you, a tool. You live in a bunker full of important arcane information.” Cas stopped dead and spun to face Dean. “You fix it.” He pointed at Dean. “You broke it. You fix it. I’m done.” Cas turned and started walking again, stomping up the porch stairs.
Dean and Charlie damn near fell off their chairs laughing.
“Ok,” Dean acquiesced, still not fully believing Cas’s declaration of his awesomeness. He leaned back against his husband, loving the way Cas’s strong, wet body felt behind him, shoring him up, and Dean tried his best to absorb and accept Cas’s words.
When he woke, he was tucked into a comfortable bed and he turned to find Dean beside him. Dean was pale, sweaty, his limbs shaking against the silken sheets. His brother’s alpha mate, Kali, sat on the edge of the bed, gently wiping his forehead.
“Father, please explain to Dean why it’s not safe -”
(Unbeta'd)
The song ended and switched to something a little more upbeat and bouncy. Dean lifted his head from Cas’s shoulder and stared at him, looking a little dazed. He stared at Cas’s lips and licked his own.
“And how do you have pot experience? Pretty sure the Navy doesn’t allow drug use.”
Another man climbed up the stack of hay and glared down at Cas from under a Mac Trucks hat. “What the hell you doin’ on my load?”
“Uh, yeah, what’s this all about?” The suspicious look had turned to concern. “The Beilers are my friends. Is this guy dangerous?”
“I’m sure, and I don’t want to see Meg.”
“You make it easy, Dean. Goodnight.” Cas’s voice sounded a little sad, but Dean was almost gone. He heard the door shut and drifted off to sleep.
Dean flushed. “Cas, he threatened to leave Sam and I don’t know if Sam’s well enough to handle it. If you come home with me, we can find a way to get Zeke out of Sam. I mean, he’s an angel, you’d know what to do.”
“Oh,” Dean looked down. “I like ‘em. They’re soft and silky. And the bear is kinda badass, right?”
Castiel nodded and followed her directions to a small washroom. He stared at himself in the little mirror over the sink and frowned. Deep purple circles rimmed the underside of both eyes, and his face was dark with the scruff lining his jaw. He looked awful, and in Jacob’s place, Cas didn’t think he’d have shown such kindness. Owen was right to be distrustful.
LOL FOUR EFFIN YEARS but hey, NEVER SAY DIE. That isn't the Winchester way!!
Dean laughed and pulled Cas down for a sweet kiss. “Stay?” he asked against his lips.
His mate had left him.
“Ok, I’m coming!” Cas turned back to Dean apologetically. “Let me know if you can’t get your arm through the shirt.”
Dean Winchester didn’t need anyone. He definitely didn’t need Cas.
“Dean, you’re incredibly stressed right now.”
“The rest stop? Son, that was about two hundred miles ago. You ‘spect me to believe you been asleep this whole time?”
Struggling to get away from Cas, Dean forced himself out of the dragon’s arms with unnatural strength - a move he regretted instantly as the salty water closed over his head. Dean thrashed frantically, fighting Cas and Kali as they struggled to get him out of the water.
“I’m sure I can handle it,” Cas said dryly. He cocked an eyebrow at Dean, confused by the bewildered look on his face. “You coming?”
“Mmm, bed, c’mon,” Dean squirmed, trying to get out from under Victor.
dirty, because that’s what we used to wipe you off the other night.”
“Well, Lyddie does the beekeeping ‘round here. She sells the honey and puts a little money in our pockets.”
?” Dean asked, his voice cracking like a teenager’s.
Vas is letz? - What is wrong?
“Yeah. Really don’t want to talk about it, though. I’ve got my Restaurant Management test today and I’m focused on that.”
“Please. We’ve all seen the way you two morons gaze at each other, spend all your time together, I mean really,” Gabe snorted, “it was just a matter of time.”
Just down the hall, Dean saw Cas leading his class inside from the playground. He admired Cas’s outfit for a moment, again thinking to himself how well those pants fit. How well the entire ensemble fit. Cas looked so good in his prefered waistcoat and slacks look and Dean wondered if -
Cas frowned. “I don’t know that I am. I just - I have this knowledge in my mind. It’s always been there. I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t -” Cas trailed off. “You must think me very strange.”
Huffing a sigh, Sam shook his head. “If you’re this upset about him being gone, why did you ask him to leave in the first place? He could’ve stayed. He’d’ve been safe here.”
“You gunna stay, right?” he asked, cut off by a massive yawn.
Dragging himself from the bed, he staggered to a set of glass doors and pushed them open, sucking in an awed breath at the sight spread out beneath him.
“I’m sorry, Dean.” Cas squeezed his hand. “Sam says your father blessed our union before he passed.”
Nodding, Dean sighed. “Yeah. Friends.”
“Are you real?” Dean whispered. “I’m so scared.”
Cas woke just after six am with a horrible headache. Which meant he was in the kitchen, getting himself some orange juice to chase some excedrin, when Dean’s door opened. He watched as Dean stepped out onto his porch, in bakery whites, and was about to step outside and offer a good morning.
“Yeah, yeah, I know, I’m your big disappointment.”
Dinner was a pleasant affair, and Cas was surprised to find himself warming up to Cain, who managed to be both charming and hilarious without it all feeling like an act. Dean seemed pleased when he noticed the shift in attitude, and it didn’t hurt when Cas realized that even though Dean looked at Cain with pure adoration, there was nothing sexual about it at all.
, but I still don’t see it. He smiles weird. Plus,
Dean could barely breathe as Alastair stepped from the tent, surrounded by demons and an fearsome looking black dragon.
Cas leaned against the door with his arms crossed. “Also in the hamper,” he said, rolling his eyes when Dean made a beeline for it. “Are you going to defeat the monsters with your stench?”
He wondered if they were serious, his mind flashing back to Meg telling him that Dean got around quite a bit. He wondered if Vic was just another notch in Dean’s belt.
Not bothering to light the kerosene lamp beside his bed, Cas walked across the hall to the small bathroom, turning on the taps until warm water ran out. He soaked a washrag and wrung it out, using the warm cloth to wipe the sweat from his face. Sniffling, Cas realized it wasn’t all sweat.
“Oh no. I can’t leave Dean - I knew this was coming, especially after what happened with King John -”
“You like this guy.”
“Shouldn’t we wait for Jacob?” he asked, obediently taking his seat.
“No, I was just--” Dean sighed. “Nevermind.”
Leaving Victor protesting behind him, Dean slipped into the shirt and headed back downstairs. He needed a beer...or three.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas smiles, his blue eyes sparkling, “it’s me. Really me.”
“Dean!” Sam threw himself into his brother’s arms.
“Hi,” Dean said sulkily, arms still crossed.
“Ok.” Dean stared at Cas’s ass as he left his house. He caught himself and sighed. “Moron.” He kicked his shoes off and into the hall closet and headed upstairs to wiggle into some cozy jammie pants. A little later, he was burrowed under his Captain America fleece blanket and in that happy state between doze and awake when a knock on the door startled him.
At some point, Cas dropped off again, and woke to the smell of something burning and a string of cursing drifting up the stairs. He jumped out of bed and relieved himself before heading downstairs to find Dean glaring at a smoking pan, his normally clean stove covered in globs of pancake batter.
“Are you ok? You screamed,” Cas turned to look at Dean, concern in gorgeous blue eyes.
“Yeah, and the pills ain’t doing shit. I just want to go home. Think we’ll have a snow day tomorrow?” he asked hopefully.
“He won’t be strong enough to fly with me. Gadreel, find Michael. Tell him what’s happened and see who can aid Winchester. Lucifer brings how many dragons?”
“That would be--that would be amazing,” Dean said, feeling his eyes fill with tears. “Thank you Lisa.”
“Is your sling too tight or too loose?” Cas was suddenly all up in his business, moving his hand under the strap of Dean’s sling to check the tightness. “Is your arm or shoulder numb at all? I can change--”
“But we’re not bonded,” Cas said bitterly.
“Yeah, maybe.”
“No. I’m going to bed. You can stay as long as like, hell, stay forever.” He stalked out of her room and down the hall to his own, slamming the door behind him. Dean tossed himself on his bed. Sometime later, he heard his brother’s distinctive footsteps outside his door.
“You sure? I don’t want to be a dick. I mean, you can go. I”m sure Meg would love to see you.”
“But why? I bit him first, shouldn’t my bite have more power?”
“M’fine.” Dean tossed her a set of white sheets.
“No, you’re not,” Dean argued. “You’re pale and sweaty, you’re way too hot. I bet you got what Ben’s got. You need to go home.”
“It was King Alastair,” Cas told them.
“Huh?”
A door clicked shut behind him, and Dean rolled onto his back, tears streaming down his face and dripping into his hair. Everything had happened so fast and now he was unmated once again. Despite Gabriel’s insistence that Cas still wanted him and all his talk of true mates, Dean couldn’t help but think of how weak Cas would undoubtedly see him now.
“Yes, that’s a good idea.” Cas stood and reached for Dean’s coat, holding it so Dean could slide his arm into it as Cain worked on settling the check.
And a recipe for Hot Pepper Chow Chow can be found here:
“Dean, sweetheart -” Cas trailed off as Dean claimed his lips again. “We don’t have time -”
Dean couldn't stop thinking about his roommate. He couldn’t get Cas’s face out of his mind. The morning of Cas’s graduation, when he’d stood in Cas’s room, putting that damn tie and tie-tac on him, he’d said that stupid shit about Cas deserving to have someone fuss over him and when he’d looked up, Cas’s eyes had gone all gentle and soft - fuck, Dean had wanted to kiss him. Wanted to kiss that sweet, impossibly gorgeous face and see where it went.
“I think we should go to The Crazy Cajun again,” Cas announced nonchalantly at lunch.
“I know,” Dean offered sincerely. “I do. And I am grateful. I swear. Just - this isn’t for me. I’m fooling myself into thinking I’m happy when I’m fucking miserable. I have to chase this dream now, while I’m still young enough to do it.”
“He said that?”
Across the room, Gordon Walker sniggered, an ugly expression on his face.
Every time he thought he was getting somewhere with Dean, there was an inevitable interruption. It was beyond frustrating.
“You’re not useless, Dean.” Cas smeared his face with fresh shaving cream. “Hold still.”
As he said that, Dean went utterly rigid in Cas’s arms. Looking down at his beloved’s face, Cas almost dropped him in shock.
Charlie threw her head back and laughed so long and hard she missed Gabriel coming into the room.
Not wanting to watch, but unable to look away, Cas quietly observed Victor and Dean’s embrace before they parted ways in the alley. He watched the Impala pull away before turning and heading back up to bed.
“What? Dude he’s my roommate!” Dean protested.
“What? Why?” Dean’s eyes met his. “I wanted to buy you breakfast.”
Twenty minutes later he was picking Claire up from a harried Mary. “Would you mind going to Kat’s when we get home? Miss Jess is in labor and--”
“For staying last night when I know you didn’t want to.”
Sam laughed. “Doesn’t it?”
“I just don’t want to piss her off, y’know?”
“Sorry, kiddo. That had to go, too.” Gabriel must’ve seen the despair Dean felt written on his face. “Don’t be upset. Think about how much fun you two’ll have getting to mate all over again.”
“Hey--” Dean reached out with his left hand and grabbed Cas’s arm. “Number one, I didn’t say I wanted you to leave, and number two, I appreciate the hell out of you looking after me. Please don’t apologize, ok? I need you, dude. I can’t even shave without slicing up my face.”
“Definitely,” Sam agreed.
“Bartholomew. One of Naomi’s protégés. Definitely a ‘douche’ as you would say.” Cas crossed his arms. “So because I’m being hunted, you kicked me out of arguably one of the safest places on the planet.”
“Uh yeah, this is Cas, my neighbor and Ben’s teacher. Cas, this is Timothy Cain. He teaches piano at the Peabody downtown. He’s gonna help me with the upcoming concerts since I am out of commission.” Dean waved his cast.
“Ok, ok,” Dean muttered, cutting into the pancakes.
Peering around him, Ellen’s sharp eyes found Dean across the room. “Is he ok?”
“Dude, do not psychoanalyze me. I always hated when you did that shit.” Dean folded his arms over his chest and glared at Aaron. “I’m not one of your patients.”

Wisely bypassing the door with the Minecraft poster, Vic crashed through Dean’s door, sending it slamming into the wall behind it. He grimaced slightly at the idea of any damage to his carefully painted Caribbean Sea Spray walls but forgot about it as Vic dumped him into the center of his bed. Dean moaned as Vic lightly nipped the skin at his waistband.
When it’s too dark to read, Dean pulls the hood of the hoodie he stole from Sam over his head and huddles down against the door, looking less like a person and more like a pile of laundry. Sam lets him sleep until he jerks awake several hours later, gasping for air just as Sam is pulling out of a drive-through a couple of hours into Nebraska.
Sam barely bothered looking at the guy except for a grateful mumbled thanks after helping pick Dean up off the stage. Had he been wearing a black suit? He decides to ignore Dean and pulls his laptop back over, opening up a new tab and leaving the old research up just in case.
“I’m not your son.” Castiel turns around and Sam forgets how to breathe. He’s still clutching the towel, but he’s looking down at it, mouth pinched, like he’s not quite sure what it’s for or why he's holding it.
He stares Sam down until he slumps in defeat.
“Why not? It fits, Dean. Wings, healing powers. The only thing that doesn’t make sense is why he’d even be here with the Le Granges.”
Dean shrugs regretfully. “I wish I could explain. I just wanted to ask you a couple questions. About Elijah. You’re probably the only person in town who’ll even talk to me right now.”
“Red hex box in the linen closet upstairs.”
“I’m not scared of my brother. Or angels.”
Her voice sounds tinny and staticky when Missouri picks up the phone. “Sam, this had better be good, honey.”
“Dude, I’m gonna put Nair in your shampoo if you don't stop.”
There are a few promises he wants to keep and won’t that he throws out there to make the goodbye hurt a little less, but ultimately, he does exactly what he knew he would from the beginning: he gets into the car with Sam and leaves.
“Really, Bobby?” Dean yells from behind the door.
“I’m just a guy. I don’t des—” He looks away, glaring into the laundry room.
His gaze drifts back over to Elijah, feeling strange talking about him like he’s not part of the conversation. The healer’s turned slightly away from them during Dean’s distraction, staring out the window. He looks like he's two states away from all of them.
“Wait,” he grunts.
“That’s kind of you, but I think I’m okay without miracles now. Elijah’s done what he can to help us here, and he’s promised to be with me at the end.” Dean tries not to show how surprised he is by that. “Good luck, Dean. With whatever it is you’re still here for.”
“Where’s the coffee?” Dean bitches, rubbing at his eyes with the back of one hand. He squints tiredly down at it like Sam handed him a cup of spiders.
Ford City’s just as damp and unpleasant as it was when Sam left this morning, a heavy drizzle tapping on the roof of the Impala as he pulls into an empty spot outside of the hotel. Dean’s waiting for him in the room, one leg curled under him where he’s perched on the bed, Sam’s laptop balanced carefully on his knee while he types.
“We didn’t know Lilith was coming.” The excuse sounds exactly like it is. An excuse. Henriksen reaches out, whip fast, and grabs Sam by his jacket. He yanks him around and throws him into the side of the car with a heavy thud. The metal dents under the force of it. Sam scrambles for the handle. The shotgun’s only a foot away on the dashboard where he left it. Henriksen gets to him first, grabbing him by the hair and dragging him back. His other hand hits the windows in front of Sam’s face and Sam sees a brand on the back, ugly and red, before he’s pulled back and slammed face first into the window. The glass cracks.
“Whiskey,” Bobby growls at him. “Some of my best stuff.”
“If you insist.”
“Bullshit!”
Forty minutes later, Sam pulls into a gravel driveway, passing a lit-up billboard planted in the mud declaring ‘Service Today!’. He parks in the field outside of a worn out, but tidy, two-story farmhouse. People are spilling out of the couple dozen cars and the two RVs already parked there. He spots a few struggling on crutches and walkers in the mud. The sign outside of the tent’s open flap calls the place the Church of Reverend Le Grange and Sam hears the sharp angry inhale Dean makes when he notices it.
It's like trying to argue with traffic. Nothing's gonna move Elijah except time and he's got way more of it than Dean. Hesitantly, Dean struggles up from the chair, flapping a hand at Sam when he tries to help, and eases out into the aisle, his heart fluttering at a hummingbird’s pace. Getting up the steps to the stage makes him wheeze and Le Grange grabs him by the arm. It’s impossible not to lean into the support while his chest burns from the exertion. Elijah steps in close enough to touch and Dean stares at him, taking in the unnaturally bright color of his eyes, the steady probing pressure of his gaze, and the line of his mouth bowed in concentration.
He needs to keep him talking.
were made aware.”
Dean thinks about telling him, gets so far as to open his mouth and feel the shape of the sentence, but it sticks there. He swallows it down with a click.
Sam shushes him. It’s okay to use the help. Missouri had made him repeat the words until Sam had them memorized. This isn’t a failure that he needs them.
“Okay. How do I do it?”
“You know what Sam Winchester is becoming, brother. It’s time Dean did too.”
Sam groans in frustration. “There’s ten times more lore on angels than any other creatures we’ve actually hunted before,” he argues as Dean paces the room, clearly looking for something to do. Sam can think of at least a couple things, but Dean lingers over the weapons they brought inside, and then circles back around into the kitchenette before turning on him with an unimpressed look.
“You don’t—what, is this like a psychic thing?” He steps under the shelter of the house’s porch and out of the rain, into the space where Elijah hovers by the door. “Born with it or…?”
“Special favor,” Sam lies, and it slips out a little easier than the first one.
“You clean now?” he quips. There’s a flicker of annoyance and in the span of one blink and the next the stain is gone. In fact, the damn dashboard looks brighter and cleaner than Dean’s ever seen it. As if forty years of built up dirt and blood and sun damage have been lifted.
“This was hidden in their library. Haven’t had a chance to look through it much yet, but I’m pretty sure it was written by some priest in the late 1500s. There’s a couple references in the first few pages to—”
“It’s a panic room.”
“I’m so sorry, we thought—” she flashes across the room and backhands him.
“I’m driving ninety-seven down US-20 in the middle of the God damn night, Samantha, and I’m pretty sure Cas can’t drive.”
He’s so distracted that he doesn’t even notice Sam’s dragged him up toward the front few rows and positioned him right in the aisle seat behind Layla.
“Me and Sam’ll get back on the road soon as we find a job. Plenty to do then, but we got to lay out some ground rules,” he says, and grimaces when Castiel flutters in confusion. Instead of having that conversation, whatever that conversation even is, Dean shrugs wildly and hauls himself out of the car so he can replace the window. Sam appears while Dean is carefully slotting the new glass into place. He urks by the hood, listening to Dean sing along to Since I’ve Been Loving You when he’s not explaining a fiddly step to Cas.
It takes Dean three hours before he relaxes enough to convince himself that Sam isn’t going to say anything else about what happened. Or mention the scar, though he keeps shooting it looks when he thinks Dean isn’t paying attention. A giddy feeling of relief settles over him. Like he got away with something.
Fuck. Fuck, no.
“Gotta what? Dean, what do you have to do?” Sam asks, and this time he’s demanding, trying to get anything but half conversations and vague replies. Dean reaches for the kitchen towel on the counter and starts drying his face.
“You heard her. It was a freak accident,” he argues, and Dean clenches his jaw to keep from snapping at him. “Do you really have to look this one in the mouth, Dean? Why can’t we take the win and move on?”
“It's probably the best guess we have besides the really obvious one. That this is all a coincidence. Freak accidents, just like the doctor said. Maybe Elijah’s the real deal and completely harmless.”
Maybe.
“My people skills are very 'rusty'.” He makes actual air quotes with his free hand when he says the word 'rusty'. Really? Where did he learn to be human? Chris Farley? “I was told that I need to make an effort to interact without Sue Ann around to smooth over my mistakes, and there’s very few places here that are… appropriate.”
“You can let him go. I’m not gonna press charges.” She looks briefly over when Sam strips off his jacket to wipe the mud off it, and her eyes widen when she takes in the state of him. Soaking wet and completely uninjured. Something hardens behind her eyes when she looks back at Dean. “The Lord will deal with him as He sees fit.”
She tips her chin up and grins, all teeth. “Don’t worry, Sam, I’m not a demon.”
That’s something Dean can’t exactly argue or apologize for, so he nods and lets himself accept the gratitude that Cas is trying to express.
He glances at Dean and raises both his eyebrows. Dean shakes his head minutely and, okay, so they don’t need to start budgeting for a second room yet. Sam’s been oblivious, but he’s not stupid. Gives him time to think about how to explain Cas to Dad anyway, though Sam’s still sure he’s gonna blow up no matter what.
Dean ignores him. “Number two: Stop asking stupid questions and help me get you undressed.”
Dean screams his name and Sam jerks back into consciousness, helpless not to listen. He blinks his eyes open, the world swimming into focus as he takes inventory of himself. Clothes soaked through and cold with water as he lies on his back in the mud. Dean's leaning over him, patting his cheek frantically. He turns his head away from it with a groan and agony lances through him at the movement.
“Yeah, okay, okay, maybe…” He chews his lip, thinking while Dean kicks off the rest of his wet clothes and changes. He opens another webpage and starts reading, sitting up excitedly once he’s gotten through a few paragraphs. “Hold on, what if… what if we’re both half-right?”
“I’m fine. Stop asking,” Dean grinds out when he opens the door a few minutes later.
Elijah stalls, completely thrown by the question and all that it implies. For one wild second, Dean feels guilty, and then he’s just done. With this conversation and this job. He should have walked away as soon as Elijah opened his mouth and dared to say anything about John Winchester.
Castiel has been to places like this before. Humans gathering together for drinks and games is not something new, though the game they’re playing isn’t familiar. He hovers near the surface of Dean’s consciousness, observing from behind his eyes and reaching out around the room to learn their surroundings. Dean sweeps the room to check for obvious dangers. No one stands out to him, but Castiel sees a pair of vampires at a table in the middle of the room. He doesn’t bring them to Dean’s attention the way he did the demons in the diner. They’re clean of human blood and only here to enjoy themselves.
“Uh, so you knew about that?”
