Which means he’d heard Dean confess his love earlier than today, back when Dean was in the thick of discovery. Dean feels the tips of his ears start to burn. He’s nothing if not embarrassed. Those prayers had become half diary, half confessional by the end. And Cas had heard every last word. Jesus Christ. “Please tell me there was at least some interdimensional static.”
“Hey, hey, hey.” Dean puffs out his chest, squares his shoulders. “Spare a man his pride. Nobody out-eats the Meat Man.”
“No.” Dean leans his head against the doorframe. “He didn’t even wake up. I had to carry him to his room.”
Dean wrenches his arm free. “And I told you, I’m fine.” At his feet, Miracle whimpers, suddenly uneasy. Dean hushes him with a firm hand atop his head.
Sam, looking at Dean with those stupid pound-puppy eyes, had said, “Just wait here, I’ll be quick. I know she’s alive, I just… I just need to see her.”
Sam shrugs. “If you want a heart attack, that’s your business.” He pointedly ignores Dean’s look of scorn. “Eileen says hi, by the way.”
Dean slips Miracle a few pieces of bacon. He tears into his own piece, taking one large bite before spitting it out into his hand.
note, and then Dean’s too caught up in the minutiae of slaying vampires to do more than send out a vague feeling here and there. A cross-dimensional Facebook poke, he likes to think of it.
Something in Cas must deflate too, because the angel joins Dean on the bed now. He perches gingerly on the edge of it. Eyes facing the wall, Cas says, “I meant what I said, you know. Back in that room. I need you to know that.” And the way he says it, clipped and rigid, pinches a nerve. “I won’t apologize for that either, but I noticed you seemed… distressed by it.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replies, a soft smile on his face, cheeks flaming as he stares down the beautiful man.
“You okay, Dean?” Ellen asks, and Dean can only nod. He takes a bite of the food he must have served himself on autopilot and forces a smile. He’s sure it looks sarcastic and biting, but there isn’t much he can do about that fact. He eats the rest of his dinner in silence, listening as Sam tells Ellen about his amazing grades, his amazing girlfriend, his amazing life. He’s proud of his little brother, proud that he’s been able to find the happiness that life found it hysterical to rip away from him…
“All rise,” the bailiff says to signal the judge’s entrance, and everyone stands. Cas looks away from Bobby to look at Dean. He fidgets with his jacket, and Cas’ first instinct to take Dean’s hands in his, to calm the fidgeting. Be that as it may, he will not be afforded that luxury today…maybe ever again.
“Jerk,” he replies without hesitation. They fall silent, the last few miles to the school turning beneath the wheels. As they pull into the parking lot, Sam looks back to Dean, a soft smile on his face. Dean holds his breath at what’s sure to come. “Really, Dean,” he starts earnestly. “The way he looks at you…it’s like you filled the whole damn sky.” Dean feels his cheeks heat. He feels his eyes burn. His whole body aches for Cas. “Don’t be dumb and give that up, especially not when you’ve never seen the way
“We can’t finish?” Dean asks, only half-kidding as he raises his hand to cup Cas’ cheek, earning himself a blue-eyed glare. Dean grins and moves to put his pants on. “I’ll talk to him,” Dean assures, leaning back down to kiss Cas.
“Cas,” he starts finally, silently fumbling for a way to explain himself. “I didn’t mean to…you know..”
wanted Dan to kiss him, but he didn’t want to stop being best friends with him. He didn’t want Dan to get in trouble for kissing him. But after Clarence ran away, Dan found him and told him that they would never stop being best friends, that he wouldn’t let them get in trouble. And so they kissed again, and soon, they became real boyfriends, spending every single second together. Their relationship had to be a secret though, because people still thought that boys liking boys was wrong, but Dan and Clarence didn’t mind. They were too in love to mind. They were very, very happy together, that is, until Clarence’s mom came home one day to find them acting like boyfriends together. You remember that most people thought that it was wrong, so when she saw them, she banished Dan from ever seeing Clarence again and locked Clarence away in the top of a tower.”
“No idea. I guess we’ll see. Trial starts in seven minutes.” Gabe waves an arm towards the door, so Cas sighs and pulls it open. They find a seat in the middle, just close enough that he can see the sweat beading under Sam’s collar, but far enough so that the words Dean is whispering feverishly to his brother cannot be heard.
“Sure I do. It's part of the job.” She offers him a small smile. “Can I get you a coffee? Soda?” Cas starts to decline, then he hears the ghost of himself screaming at Dean all those weeks ago.
He strips Dean of his jacket first, hands ripping it from Dean’s shoulders and tossing it to the side. Dean’s hands mimic and liberates Cas of his trench coat, tossing it to the floor atop his own jacket. Once jackets are gone, Cas has to pause a moment to delve against Dean’s neck, nipping and licking and tugging, encouraged by Dean’s breathy moans and hands gripping at Cas’ ass.
“Whoa, wait. My make-up,” Lydia stops him, leaning away as quickly as he can lean in. He freezes, both of them bent at awkward angles to keep in this silly limbo.
They sit in stilted silence for a long moment, and Dean feels the alcohol rolling, rolling in him. He knocks back another just to keep the words from rising.
“Anna,” Cas groans, putting his head back on Dean’s shoulder. “I thought you were going to Rachel’s.” Anna hikes her bag higher on her shoulder.
“Are you sure? Because it sure seems to me, and now I know I’m just an outsider, that Dean spends an awful lot of time using
“Can we talk about this?” Dean asks quietly, glancing around to the faces still blatantly watching them. “Privately,” he says pointedly, putting a hand on Lisa’s back, one that she promptly slaps away but moves for the stairs anyways.  Dean follows, throwing a mournful glance at the door Cas has the good sense to keep firmly shut between them. When they make it outside, Lisa decides that they have gone far enough and turns to Dean with fury in her eyes, demanding an explanation. "How did you find out?” Dean asks quietly after a long moment of surveying the groups of people around him. Everyone outside is too wasted to care what Lisa and Dean are arguing about.
He begins to cry. Hot, angry tears roll down his cheeks, but when Cas tries to pull away to check on the heaving breaths tearing through Dean, all Dean can do is clutch him closer, roll his hips, dig his fingers into the soft of his ass.
, and it shocks Sam how much it hurts to hurt him. “I don’t think you should see him,” Sam blurts, and Cas closes his eyes, dead smile still plastered there. “It’s just.” Sam pushes out a burst of air and runs a hand down his face. Cas pulls in a slow breath and opens his eyes. “He’s really happy, Cas. Seeing you would just…bring back old memories, memories that he’s worked hard to forget and get past. It would only upset him.” Tears well up in Cas’ eyes, but he nods a bit.
“Please, Dean,” Cas says, whines, begs. “Just say it for me. Please. I need it. You don’t even have to mean it.” He sounds wrecked, impossibly so. Dean pulls away from Cas’ shoulder to stare into his eyes. The rhythm of his hips falters, and for a disappointing second, Dean thinks Cas won’t need Dean’s love after all. “Please,” Cas sobs, now looking as wrecked as he sounds.
“I’m so sorry,” he murmurs, and Dean closes his eyes. After Dean’s heartbeat returns to normal and the anger has drained away, replaced by the overjoyed reminder that Cas is here, Dean continues his lazy brushes through Cas’ hair until he falls asleep, his palm pressed against Dean’s beating heart. Dean follows close behind, pressing a kiss to Cas’ hair with a soft smile before falling into the dark abyss.
Cas pulls up to the clinic with a numbness eating away at his heart. It has been fifty-eight hours since he has seen Dean. Ten years have passed, but fifty-eight hours feels like a lifetime. Even so, he stares at the building, slate gray concrete and ten years paved into its cement. It sets his nerves on edge, so much so that his breathing shallows and his hands begin to shake. He draws in one, two, three quick breaths before he shoulders open his door and stands tall, false confidence pulling into his stance.
“Cas,” Dean hisses, the heat inside of him coiling tighter and tighter as Cas’ breath pants against his neck.
“Cas,” Dean groans, rolling gently onto his sleeping boyfriend. Dean knows they have the house to themselves, for Gabe is away at college while Anna and Ms. Milton are visiting family up north for the holidays. “Caaassss,” Dean whines, bouncing until Cas’ eyes snap open to glare at Dean.
thrown water on him. If Cas weren’t so hungover, he’d roll his eyes. “What on earth possessed you to drink a whole fifth?” Gabe demands, picking up the empty bottle and tossing it aside.
Dean holds his eyes for as long as he possibly can, and when he has to close them, wrench them tight against the idea that he got Cas back just to lose him in the worst possible way, Cas is suddenly at his side, lifting a hand and swiping through the tears under Dean’s eye, so impossibly tender, so entirely undeserved that it makes him cry harder.
Dean’s phone rings in his pocket, slamming the reality back into them. He sighs as he digs it out, forcing himself to part from Cas. He groans when he sees Sam’s name in the caller I.D.
“Very much so,” she mimics softly, and Castiel believes that. She made faces and noises this time that she didn’t make last time, and Castiel, gay as he may have been, knows what an orgasm looks like.
“Thank you, Adam,” he says, and with that, the two head to the stairs, a comfortable silence hanging over them. They find Jess in the living room, turning on a colorful children’s movie for Sammy. Adam leans against the frame of the door to watch her, but Cas moves on, sitting next to Sammy and scooping him into his lap. The child coos, but Cas only grins. Soon, the child he holds will be his.
Dean. Castiel’s whole body is covered in chills, not that he notices. All he can focus on is trying to push Dean out of his mind, away from him.
“Thanks,” Cas murmurs, and slides into the front seat of Lydia’s car. Dean watches him, rapt, hating himself for still loving him after ten years.
“Yeah, Sam. You know he does,” Dean says, his throat tight as he swallows. He threads his fingers together between his knees.
There’s barely time to suck in a breath of that tarred mountain air before the non-walls of the Empty start bubbling around them. Panicked, Dean scrabbles his useless fingers over the back of Cas’ coat.
“Who told you?” Cas asks, once the girl is gone. His voice is level, commanding. He has lost too much to tremble now.
“I guess,” Dean says, and some part of himself believes it. Some part of him believes that kissing Cas meant nothing, that he is still only interested in girls, that he has no feelings for Cas, and the part of him that
Dean doesn’t see Cas again until later that night. He and Sam sit in the living room playing Mario Kart (Dean is just letting Sam win so the little bitch won’t cry), and John is dead to the world, passed out in his bedroom.
“Because we’ve been apart for a very long time,” he tells her, brushing her hair back from her face.
“Are you kidding?! How could you be so goddamned blind? Honestly!” Dean puts a hand to his head and wipes angrily down his face. “I came out to Sam for you! I broke up with Lisa for you! How could you think I didn’t want to be with you?”
?! I didn’t know you wanted me to stay! You said it was just supposed to be fun! No strings attached and purely physical. I thought it was all I was going to get, so of
. You thought you were better than me, thought that you would save me from myself.” Dean stops suddenly, chest heaving as Cas readies himself for another round of swearing that he entirely deserves. When Dean speaks again, his voice is loud, but level. “Don’t you get it?” Dean asks, his voice big in the small space of the kitchen. Cas cocks his head to the side, his vision blurry with tears. Dean strides closer, hands reaching out to grab Cas’ face. Cas practically melts into the rough touch, so it’s not surprising when Cas lets himself be pushed backwards until Dean is able to thump his head against the refrigerator. “I will
Bobby comes down first, Charlie’s arm wrapped around his as she beams, a small bouquet of flowers in her hands. Following Bobby is Sam, Gabriel strolling along next to him, waving to the crowd and reaching for Sam just to embarrass him. Judging by the blush on Sam’s cheeks, it’s working, and Dean laughs, the nervous energy growing as Sam takes his place next to him. Emma comes next, skipping down the path and dropping petals with every step. Her blonde hair bounces as she comes hopping to a stop in front of Sam. There’s just one person left, and as He appears, dark hair a mess, blue eyes wild, Dean can’t help but remember what brought them here in the first place.
“Yes,” Dean says, stepping forward and beginning to climb. When he gets to the top, he turns to help pull Cas through before scooting to the edge and looking out over the creek. “Do you remember that time when we were…I don’t know, nine? Anyways, we had been playing like you were God, but
“What are you watching me for, Dean?” Cas asked, though he knew perfectly well, and Dean knew it too.
lose him, not again. As long as he’ll have me, I’m not leaving.” Gabe stares Cas down, his eyes narrowed until he sighs and breaks his fighting posture into one of defeat.
Dean knows Cas likes it dirty. He likes the sloppy sounds and the spit all over Dean’s face and the occasional fingering. Today though, he is practically doing all the work for Dean. He has both hands threaded through his hair and is groaning, fucking up into Dean’s mouth. Dean lets Cas do what he wants, keeping the pressure tight and his tongue working even as he unzips his own pants and takes his dick into his hand. Dean moans around Cas’ cock, and Cas lets out a groan like sin. He’s close, so Dean releases his own dick with a slight whimper and takes Cas’ hips into his hands, stilling his thrusting immediately. Cas whimpers.
Dean shows up a couple hours into the unloading and unpacking, and after a quick hug from Cas, begins helping. Cas, though he is separating the kitchen ware from the dining ware, keeps an eye on him to make sure Anna does not go back on her promise to leave Dean the hell alone. She leaves him the hell alone, despite an icy reply to his warm hello and the glares she keeps tossing at him. Cas rolls his eyes, expecting this to be as good as it will get with her.
“I don’t think I can stay forever,” he says with a laugh, standing and shifting her weight so she is hanging upside down from the hand he has wrapped around her ankle. She giggles in delight, so he starts swinging her side to side, filling his heart with the sound.
“Shhh...You’ll…be okay…my little bee,” Cas says, mustering the strength to push a hand through her hair.
Cas. He always has. Dean, too distracted to notice that his coffee is scalding, takes a sip and nearly spews it over his tiny kitchen.
“Always a pleasure, Doc,” she says exiting the circle and heading for the door. “Peace out, bitches.” As soon as the door shuts behind her, Naomi visibly relaxes, fists unclenching in her lap.
“Yeah,” Gabe says, and Cas frowns. “It didn’t hit her until June. She thought it was just a cold. It probably was, at first.”
,” he leers, leaning closer to his boys. Dean brings a protective arm up around his brother. “You’re not.” He turns to Dean. “And there’s nothing
“He was jerking me off in the school bathroom, and when I came, it was because he said anyone who walked in would know I was his,” Dean says, watching with halfhearted glee as the horror makes its way onto his little brother's face.
“Okay,” Dean murmurs, and walks between his two fuck buddies to the library. When they get there, Cas immediately tears off for the historical fiction section, but Lisa is sticking to Dean like white on rice. “Uh,” he starts, detaching his arm from her vise-like grip. “I’m gonna go hit the head,” he mutters, and leaves the library. He really does go to the bathroom, but as soon as he checks that there is no one else in any of the stalls, he locks the door and pulls out his phone.
.” He leans in close, smells the stench of manipulator and bitch on her skin, and smiles. “You fucking lost.”
“Hungry?” Bobby asks when he enters the kitchen, and Dean nods as he sits at the table and pulls a plate to himself. “Dig in,” Bobby says, sitting next to Dean in silence as he loads his plate. Bobby waits until Dean has a mouthful of food--unable to defend himself, the sorry bastard--to begin speaking. “Listen,” he starts, and Dean chews all the faster in order to talk, not listen, because 'listen' means they’ll have to talk about what happened last night, about Dean liking guys, about life, and it’s not a conversation Dean wants to have, like
“Yes, Dean,” Cas asks, tears in his eyes because his will is not strong enough to walk away without tears. Before Dean can open his mouth, Emma’s little hand pats against his shoulder, needing him, and Dean tears his eyes away from Cas to look at Emma.
“Are you still cold?” Cas whispers after a moment, and Dean feels like he’s just had a bucket of ice scraped straight down the length of his spinal cord. But he knows that’s not what Cas means. He shakes his head.
“That doesn’t make it hurt less,” Dean whispers instead, and Bobby nods, pain and empathy in his eyes.
so I can spend Christmas with you and the boys?” John glowers, and Bobby knows he has won. So in semblance of his victory, he turns away from John. “Your bother up?” he asks Dean, and Dean nods. “Good,” and Bobby is off moving towards Sam’s room. Dean watches him walk away for a moment before turning his eyes back to John. He looks seriously hungover, but as far as Dean can tell, the only alcohol in his system is left from what he ingested yesterday.
“Wow,” Naomi concludes, startling Cas away from the darkness of his thoughts as she straightens the last page of his inventory before folding it into his file. Cas looks down. “You felt pretty strongly about
“Do what?” Dean asks quietly after an eternity has passed, but he knows the answer. He’s known the answer since he was ten and felt it himself.
“Soft kisses, cuddling…pretty much anything an old married couple who secretly hate each other would be comfortable doing.” Cas offers a smile, and Dean grins. They stare at each other for a while until Dean looks away and lets out a low whistle.
“Would you tell me about yourself, Dean?” Cas asks gently, a small smile on his lips. Dean’s eyes darken again.
“I moved here with Sam. It was follow him halfway across the country or stay in Kansas by myself in a house that both of my parents had lived and died in. It wasn’t a hard decision to make.”
“No!” Bobby shouts finally, and Dean sees Sam flinch. Dean doesn’t react. “No,” Bobby says, softer this time with a small shake of his head. “Boys, it’s just gonna be the same old song and dance. He’s not gonna treat ya’ any better than when you left.”
“So hold on to that. You’re going to be fine without me, and if not, just give me a call." She smiles at him, all teeth and crinkled eyes before she pulls him close and buries herself in his neck. “Thanks for being awesome,” she whispers, and when she pulls away, he swears he sees tears in her smiling eyes.
He realizes that he should stop correlating the years that pass with Dean. Dean is elsewhere, hopefully happy with a nice woman. Castiel wants that for Dean. He really does.
“Then what’s stopping you?" Dean growls, pushing against Cas’ straining dick once again, his own reaching a crisis point. He removes one of his hands from Cas’ chaotic hair to sit back, unzip, and take it in hand. Cas’ lips part hungrily at the sight of Dean’s swollen and leaking cock, even going so far as to lick his lips before he speaks, his eyes still on Dean’s penis.
“Wanna go to the old tree house?” Dean asks, pushing himself off the chair and offering a hand to Cas. Cas groans, falling back but putting his hand up for Dean to grab. Dean rolls his eyes and pulls Cas up, lingering his hand against Cas’ before letting it go and heading for the door with Cas on his heels. He pulls in a deep breath, setting his shoulders against the cold and torment before pulling it open. They walk in silence.
Castiel won’t lie and say he was unaffected seeing Dean after all this time. He’s still Dean. He’s still Castiel’s best friend. Castiel’s first instinct was to run to Dean, to jump into those arms and squeeze him with everything in him. But then he thought of Naomi and April, of himself, of everyone who worked to get him where he is today.
“I’ll be back in a few days,” Cas promises softly, his hand curled around the back of Dean’s neck with fingers that scrape against Dean’s skull. Their hips press together in their embrace, but they each want the other closer. No matter how close they get, there always seems to be the distance of ten years between them, and it is always enough to leave the pair cold. Cas presses his lips to Dean’s shoulder to push away the frost and the past.
“Sorry, man,” she replies with a sorrowful smile. “He didn’t want to leave his spouse?” she asks, and Cas scoffs.
“I’m just saying. It sounds like a set up for some cheesy rom-com. Stands to reason that it would end like one. The girl always gets her hero.” Sam winks at him, and Dean bitchfaces him, because thank you very much, he
smitten with the green eyed man named Dean. Not only that, but some small part of him had felt, despite it being a job, despite Cas being ace, despite it all, that Dean might still be here when he woke up… But he was wrong, and so he pulls the covers higher around him, pretends he never felt as warm and content as he had last night, and tries to go back to sleep around the disappointment.
of hurting Dean. “I just want to make things right with him.” Sam takes him in slowly, from his two-day-old rumpled suit, to his shaking hands, and up to his bloodshot eyes.
“You know,” she starts, leaning forward so that her breath brushes against Dean’s ear with every word. “On your last birthday, we never even left the bed,” she whispers, and presses a kiss to the corner of Dean’s jaw. He pulls away slowly.
“What?” Cas asks, and Dean prepares for the screaming, the fighting, the hot of their hot and cold relationship. “No, Dean, calm down. It’s okay. I’m happy for you.” Dean blinks.
“I’m fine,” he tells her, he tells them. He offers them all a smile before backing away and sitting at the table. Her smile stays in place, but so does the glint in her eyes. “Really,” he assures, but no one looks any more convinced. He sighs and looks away. He misses Cas.
goddamn sick of this,” Gabriel shouts, throwing his hands in the air and turning away from Cas. “Your
“Alright, team,” Dean says, clapping his hands, “back to the books we go.” He turns the handle of the door, steps through the threshold, and stops dead in his tracks when he spots the oozing black void hung above the library table. “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”
“And it hates Cas too,” Sam agrees. “But how’d it even get him? Jack made it seem like Cas wasn’t supposed to be there, like he’s not actually dead.”
Vicious to the end, Cas spits at the Empty, “You’ll never be able to sleep again. It will never be silent for you ever again. Not after all this.” This — this is how the last fight against the Empty could have gone down. Go down swinging, Dean always said. But now, watching Cas stare down the tip of his own death again, Dean can’t think of anything worse. Where’s the valor in dying?
The Empty twitches as it takes a step towards Dean. “You,” it growls. The sound is strained, like its voice was caught in a voice. “You wouldn’t stop talking.”
“It’s not like any of these books are gonna tell us anything.” Sam nudges his fallen spellbook with his toe.
It screeches, an ungodly sound that has the four of them covering their ears. “You don’t get it! I can’t fall asleep with you four around. You’ll fuck everything up like you always do and I’ll get to sleep again.” Its snarl twists into something painful, its eyes watering up. Dean feels something almost like pity. Almost.
“Hm?” Dean looks up, hardly remembering the throwaway line. “It was probably nothing. Thing was half out of its mind.”
“No, this affront to food is disgusting. My mouth feels violated.” Dean makes an act of pretending to retch, which Sam promptly ignores like the bastard he is.
and he’d said it crying, but he’d been smiling too and goddamnit if that doesn’t hurt worse. A foot to the face would have been kinder than Cas’s sticky-sweet confession, a bargain for Dean’s life against Cas’s own. And the angel had had the audacity to call it the happiest moment of his life. What a bunch of shit.
“So we close the rift,” Sam says. “I can probably hobble together some of Rowena’s spells for that.”
“Not even to let him down gentle?” Sam doesn’t deviate from pressing Dean further, not even when Dean flips him off. “Why not?”
He sees a tear open up along its middle and two pale fingers — human-shaped fingers, but aren’t they always human-shaped? — scramble to pull the rest of the void apart. Out pops the rest of an arm, one leg and then the other, until the whole creature finally stumbles loose and shakes itself off. When it straightens, Dean’s grip on the shotgun wavers. He’d know that face anywhere.
“You don’t understand, though. I tried,” and there Dean lifts his head from his chest, moving to the doorway to hear better. “I tried, but it was like there was something… I don’t know, holding him back? He was stuck.” That would explain what Jack had said back in that small town. Sam knows the Empty’s involved now too, and that’ll be a conversation for later. How thrilling.
“You got a dog,” Cas says, pointing at Miracle. The dog is laying on his side, nose tucked under his front paw.
“We should close the rift.” Jack extricates himself from Cas and examines the rift up close. “This is a door to the Empty, right?”
He sits back up, cracks the stiffness from his joints. Time to head back inside before he catches a chill. Jack and Sam are still in the library when he steps through the front door. “Hey, Dean,”  Jack calls, waving.
Dean snorts. “It’s gonna have to. God, is it too much to ask for a break? We were doing really well there, we really were.”
“So you’re the only big bad left, congrats,” Sam says. By now, he’s lowered his gun — if this breaks into a fight, they’re more than screwed. Dean hopes Sammy’s found something in that spellbook or maybe has a lullaby stashed in his back pocket. “Nobody’s around to keep you awake anymore. You’re free to go to sleep anytime you want.”
The Empty has no time to scream before its head is falling from its shoulders, followed by the decaying of its own body into black sludge. Behind Dean, Sam and Jack gag on a sudden influx of air. They rise to their feet as Cas steps away from the wall clutching his shoulder. The Empty plunged the blade into Cas’s shoulder right, its aim for his heart disrupted by the clean slice of the scythe. Cas’s wound will sting for a while unless he can muster up some mojo to fix it, but it won’t kill him. Not this time.
He feels the corners of his eyes begin to prick now. He doubles over the counter now, arms steeled out straight in front of him, and closes his eyes tight. “Goddamn it, Cas.” The tension rolls over Dean full-body before he grips it tight in his chest and shoves it back down into a pit. “If you came back, I could quit feeling this way, too. What do you say to that?” And this comes out almost a growl, left blunt by the shortness of Dean’s breath.
The dish is clean. Dean starts on it with a towel, sets it aside for Sam to put away later. He reaches over for Sam’s plate next. “If you came back, you could talk him down yourself.” This plate he cleans quickly and stacks atop the other. “He doesn’t love me or Sam like he loves you.”
Cas is tender when he threads his fingers through Dean’s hair, his cheeks warm and soft uner Dean’s own fingers. Dean has been with many women over the years, none so much in recent years and not for anything more than a one-night stand in even longer, and it makes him realize how much he’s missed this — this, the mushy brew around his heart and the feeling of being touched by someone he genuinely trusts. Fuck the rest of the world, he could live in this moment forever.
It’s striking to Dean how much he could have and did not say. “I don’t know,” he tells Sam slowly, another white lie. He feels an impression of the answer laying like lead on his tongue, though he does not trust himself to speak it. “I really don’t know.”
“No?” Sam says, hazarding a guess. “Same thing as there being no more god but Heaven’s still intact. Right?”
Dean leans forward over the table. “I bet it was,” he says. “Come on, give me the details. We can gossip like high school girls. If you’re nice, maybe I’ll even paint your nails.”
Dean sits on the floor next to Miracle. The scythe he places down next to him. Whichever reaper takes Death’s mantle next is absolutely going to have to pry this bad boy from his cold dead hands. He runs a hand down Miracle’s side -- no wounds, thank god. Miracle shuffles into a sitting position and licks the side of Dean’s face. “I say we mark this bridge as ‘cross it when we get to it.’ What do you say, huh? I think we’ve earned an easy win for once anyway.”
“You know,” he continues, “I think I’d bring him back if I knew how.” The library is vast and empty without someone else in it. Dean’s voice reverberates off the shelves and the walls, refracted back at him. “Even if I have to jumpstart the next apocalypse, I think I could do it. We took down fucking God. What’s the Empty to God, right? But then I start thinking, like right now, if I could risk losing Sammy and Jack for that.”
comes out as a string of garbled sounds. Cas’s brows scrunch together and even Sam gives Dean a strange look.
The Empty still comes but this time Cas finds a renewed fighting spirit. Somehow the two of them emerge from that room victorious over both Death and the Empty. It’s the happy ending Dean’s been pining for.
But Sam was always, unfortunately, too smart for his own good. “You promised you wouldn’t lie, Dean.”
And without missing a beat, Sam pulls over one of the books Jack had thrown around and opens it to its first page. “You heard the man,” he says.
Dean makes a habit out of praying. None are very special or grandiose, more akin to a goodmorning text or a “how’s it hanging” message. Dean can’t quite say why he sends them other than that he can and, if he’s lucky, he’s annoying Cas with their frequency. Can’t let the angel get too comfy over in the Empty.
die.” And with that, Dean jumps back into the fight, loading off another round into the Empty’s skull.
“Sure thing, Sammy.” Dean snatches the book he was reading off the table and continues past them, ignoring Sam’s protests that he better not make burgers again. “Holler if you make any breakthroughs, I’ll be in my room.”
They take the next few minutes in silence. A brief patch of light breaks through a gap in the clouds, then disappears as the clouds pass over the sun again. Nearby, a small animal rustles in the bushes.
When he finally does fall asleep, it is shallow and dreamless — while deep in the Empty, something smothered to sleep stirs.
Cas spares him by beginning first. “I don’t know where to start.” One of his hands comes up to the back of his head, tugging at the short hairs there, a habit Dean hasn’t seen him do too often. “I’ll admit I didn’t expect to come back.”
Jack remains undeterred. He doesn’t even look up when he says, “We’ll find something.” He scribbles something incoherent on a pad of paper next to him, then scribbles it out with a frustrated sigh.
wasn’t precisely nothing, but Dean doesn’t think it was much of something either. “What was I supposed to say, huh? What would have made you listen, you fucking lovesick angel?” There he goes talking to Cas again like there’s any reception in the Empty. It helps, though. Makes a punching bag out of thin air.
“I thought it was,” Jack says perhaps too sincerely, leaving Dean to puzzle over who may or may not have taught the kid sarcasm.
Dean snorts, closes his phone, and slides it across the table. Sammy deserves a night off. Things might go sideways later, as they so often do, but at least for the moment his little brother can have a break.
“Absolutely.” A lie. A deserved lie. And with Jack fast asleep in the backseat of the Impala, wiped out from Chuck’s powers burning straight through him like a short wick, Dean sped off from the curb. When he pulled the car into the Bunker, he’d carried Jack to his bed, grabbed a couple beers from the kitchen, and plopped himself down in one of the library’s hard-backed chairs. It’s where he sits now, lost in the dregs, choking on the sharp core of grief in his gut. The pain hits like a bullet with no exit wound. When he’ll find the time to dig it out, he’s not sure yet.
“You know,” Dean says, purposely with his mouth full to make Sam squirm, “I was just thinking we should find a new Mrs. Butters, but you’re looking pretty good for the job. I’ll see if she left a spare coat behind, you can start tomorrow.”
Dean’s knees feel weak all of a sudden. He feels his mouth open in a goofy grin. Sam raises his eyebrows, eyes drawn to their clasped hands, but says nothing more. Jack seems to barely notice at all. Instead, the boy’s forehead scrunches up in confusion and he says, “What did the Empty mean when it said Dean was talking a lot?”
“Huh…I just always thought it was because of Jo’s crush on me,” he says thoughtfully, passing her another dish to be dried and put away.
that righteous anger as though he was truly embodying the Righteous Man for the first time in his life.
“Not just yet,” Dean says, squeezing Cas’ fingers and staring out towards the lazily moving creek. They sit there hand in hand for a long while, sit there in their thoughts and silence until Cas’ stomach grumbles loudly, bringing a small laugh out of both of them. “Come on, you nerd. Let’s go get some food,” Dean says, squeezing Cas’ fingers before detaching and starting for the ladder. Cas follows close behind him, and by the time they have broken through the trees again, Dean has decided that he’s
His fingers leave streaks of yellow where they dig into Cas’ arm, and Cas glances down at it. Dean realizes suddenly that he’s holding Cas exactly how he’d held Dean, how he’d said goodbye.
“No,” Dean says, picking up a card from the counter and holding it up for Cas to see. It’s the same one he holds in his hand. “
“He’s my best friend,” Cas says with a shrug, his face hot with the accusation. “Of course I know this stuff about him.”
“Ah, so you have an accomplice,” Naomi says, tsking quietly. “Well, group, what do we say about accomplices?”
“She’s yours now, son. You can do whatever you want with her,” John says soberly, dropping the hand he still had resting on Sam’s face. Dean nods at John, and turns away.
“You know what I want for Christmas?” Cas murmurs, reaching up and pushing a hand through Dean’s hair.
Dean blinks, the movie ends, and he drives Sam home without a word. Sam, however, is happy to fill the silence, chattering away easily about school and Jess and his happy life. Dean tries to pay attention.
acting coupley, there is an even greater one that they are cuddling on the couch or fucking each other over the kitchen table.
“Cas!” Jack, the first to overcome the moment’s shock, launches himself across the room. The boy nearly knocks Cas over grabbing him into a hug. Cas closes his eyes and pulls Jack closer; the top of his head rests atop Jack’s, and he says very quietly, “I missed you.”
Dean senses Sam’s nervous energy rolling off him in waves. He tries to ignore it, but it grows harder to do when Sam starts shifting and clearing his throat. “You come out here for the view,” Dean finally says, “or are you trying to talk about feelings again?”
There’s not much grass here, but Dean finds a big enough patch to lay himself down on. He’s out there for close to fifteen minutes, arms folded behind his head and his eyes closed against the sun, before the door to the Bunker creaks open. He opens one eye, sees Sam walking towards him with a sandwich on a plate.
A shiver rips through Dean. Whether from the wind or something else, it doesn’t matter. “That’s because he’s not. It… it took him. Popped out of some rift looking like a Venom wannabe, snatched up Cas and Billie, and left. Didn’t even look twice at me.” And why would it, when Dean poses less than a threat?
Eileen elbows Dean in his side with a cheeky grin. “Admit it, Dean. I did all the heavy lifting here.”
Sam seems to sense Dean’s struggle. Rather than dig into the wound, Sam mercifully claps Dean on the shoulder and heads back into the Bunker. The research won’t finish itself and all that. “You should come back in soon,” Sam adds, “before it gets too cold out.”
Dean elbows Sam playfully in the gut, knocking him off balance. “Don’t think they won’t take you, too. You have the interests of someone’s grandfather.”
A layer of grease covers the plate that had the bacon on it. Dean brings it over for Miracle to lick. “We’ll have to get you some dog food soon,” he says. “Though if I were you, I’d want to stick to the people food, huh?” When Miracle sits back on his haunches, done, Dean returns to the sink and attacks it with the scrub brush.
“It’s bacon.” Sam scoops a helping of eggs onto his own plate and joins Dean at the table. He tosses another piece of bacon at Miracle. “See, even the dog likes it.”
He catches Cas’s eyes from across the room. Dean’s mouth is dry, his tongue sluggish. For all the confidence he had in his prayers, he finds none of it now.
“I made you lunch.” Sam drops the plate onto Dean’s lap, no room made for a refusal. Dean pokes at and, finding it satisfactory, bites a chunk out of it.
Dean is a little breathless, giddy in that post-battle-adrenaline way. He passes the scythe between his hands, grins and says, “Come on, someone admit it, that was pretty cool.”
“My absence seemed to have made Dean a devout man.” Cas squats down next to Dean, offering the palm of his hand for Miracle to smell. To Dean, he says, “I heard all your prayers, Dean.”
Dean thinks that might be a tear in the corner of Sam’s eye. “No, god no,” Dean says hurriedly, and watches some of the tension release from Sam’s shoulders. The tension in his own body remains taut as a rod. “Fuck if I know what he was on about. Do I look like his keeper?” Keep it light, keep the levity, maybe Sam’ll get distracted.
They would think he was pathetic. He kinda thinks he’s pathetic, and even as he tells himself it’s just morbid curiosity—a shifter sex worker? That’s bonkers—he knows it’s a lie.
“Hi,” she says before glancing to Sam. He is looking back to her, as red as Dean has ever seen him. Dean barks out a laugh, and both sets of eyes cut to him, Sam horrified and Jess curious.
“You love him, and he willingly went to that SOCE clinic, and now, he’s ignoring you,” Sam starts again, his voice louder this time, more sure of himself.
“Fine,” Judge Mills says before she can continue the dramatics any farther. She looks back at Dean. “I’m afraid, Mr. Winchester, that I have no choice.” Dean braces himself; Sam’s shoulder’s fall. They both know he has failed. They all know he has failed.
“What are you doing here, Castiel?” Sam asks, his voice deep like Cas was never able to hear it change to.  He is cold too, distant with years and resentment. Cas swallows.
It’s not just that he’s familiar. Dean…Dean doesn’t feel like he has to put on a show for Cas. He doesn’t have to be the caretaker Sam’s always needed, the soldier his father always wanted, the blunt little instrument, the bad guy, the ladies man, the pretty boy, the high school drop-out. Cas has seen him from every angle, and still, Dean gets to lie there, feeling the soft puffs of breath fall from between Cas’ lips, feel the slow unfurling of his muscles as warmth claims him again, feel the steadfast beat of Cas’ heart under his cheek.
“I guess I’d better go,” Charlie says finally, leaning down to pick her bag back up. “I just wanted to tell you goodbye…and thank you.” Cas keeps that forced smile until Charlie has disappeared down the hall, one hand threaded through Gilda’s and the other raising the bird up for all the disgusted workers to behold and get the fuck over. He wants to be proud of her, wants to cheer her on and shout her praises...but he can’t, not when all the while he's feeling that she is making a irreparable mistake by leaving. Cas sits on his bed for a long while, attempting to sort through the mess that is his feelings, and when he comes out on the other side, he has five things clear and straight in his mind.
“Charlie,” a voice says from the door, and Cas looks up to see the lady from the picture staring at Charlie with a smile. She is every bit as beautiful in person as she was in the photograph, her long, brown hair curling down to her waist and twisting back in a look he’s beginning to suspect is a habit of hers.
Dean doesn’t have a key anymore—his copy is still wrapped up in Baby's key ring—so he climbs in through the window he didn’t have the time or inclination to lock before he left. It doesn’t seem as high at seventeen as it did as seven, but he still lands on the other side with a hard thud. When he straightens, he sees his desk, covered and dusty, his bed, ruffled and empty. The room smells like him, and along side him, Cas.
“Shh,” Dean soothes, nipping against the strain in Cas’ neck then licking over it with his tongue. “We don’t have much time.” With that, Dean begins to palm at Cas’ crotch, drawing a groan out of him. Soon enough, he is dropping to his knees and tugging Cas’ jeans around his ankles.
“Jesus, Cassie,” the voice is saying, swimming in and out of Cas’ awareness. “You smell like the bottom of a flask. Did you bathe in vodka or something?” The voice takes on a familiar quality, but he cannot focus enough to determine who. A low drone is filling the air, and instead of focusing on the voice, Cas’ attention is being stolen by the buzz, even as his limbs register tugging and pulling.  He can’t open his eyes yet. He feels like shit twice baked. “Christ, Cas, shut your mouth,” the voice says, and as a hand presses over his lips, the low drone stops. Cas realizes the sound was coming from him. He is so bewildered that his eyes pry open, and the instant that they do, his brain violently protests to such a careless act by sending shrieking pain into and through all of his nerves.
Cas thinks sleepily. He wriggles around in his fiancé’s arms, trying not to wake him. Cas, once Dean’s face is in perfect clarity before him, takes in the sleeping face with sweeping eyes. Cas follows the line of his nose, the spattering of freckles, bringing up a hand to lightly follow in the line of his lips. Dean, after several moments of the light caress, opens his sleepy, green eyes to the night. He blinks at Cas, smiles, and pulls Cas to him, his hands resting over the hook of his shoulder blades.
“She’s precious. How would you like to hold her?” Missouri smiles at Cas, but he is nodding and crying before he realizes it. Missouri leads Cas and Jess into the hallway and deposits them in a room dimmed and warm. He sits in a stiff arm chair with Jess next to him and waits.
“I miss you too, bug,” he tells her, the nickname sour on his tongue. “But you need to sit and answer a few questions for now, okay? Can you do that for me?” Her struggling stills a bit, and she looks at him through her wet eyelashes.
“No,” her mother spits, pressing her foot down harder into the floorboard. “He wants to change his sex.” Oh.
“Oh! I’m making avocado brownies,” he says, waiting for the reaction people always give when he tells them what he makes for his late-night snacks. The cashier does not disappoint. A look of pure disgust flashes across his face before he can reel it in and make it seem more welcoming.
“You said you didn’t love me anymore. I couldn’t have been around you even if I’d believed that was what you wanted. I’m self-loathing, not a fucking masochist.” Dean falls short of concealing his anger, but,
“I didn’t have the time,” Cas says simply, and it hits Dean like a bag of bricks. Guilt creeps into his veins, swallowing him in its heat.
“Dean?” Dean turns on his heels and finds himself staring into eyes of the bluest blue to ever blue. He bites back a groan. “Are you alright?” Cas asks, tilting his head in earnest.
“Emma,” he murmurs, watching her. She is wearing a frilly purple dress, the choppy bit of hair left from her gum incident now long enough to be pulled back into her bow. Dean’s heart swells, and he wants nothing more than to race over to her and sweep her up into his arms and refuse to ever let her go. She looks scared, and Dean’s heart breaks for her. The bailiff leads her up to the chair where she sits, looking out at the small crowd as she kicks her feet. Her eyes land first on her mother, who she waves at with a smile. Then her attention shifts to the other side of the room, and her eyes land on Dean. The minute she sees him, her whole face lights up, the smile only a child can pull off burning through the whole room.
But he’s got nothing left. He is being held together now by nothing but skin and Sam, and it is all too much. Everything is too much. He just wants Sam to be happy…if he can have nothing else he cares about in this God forsaken world, give him that.
The world around Castiel is fresh, full of endless possibilities. The first year without Dean is a new house all his own, a new dog, a new school, constant joy. He begins checking off boxes on his to-do list for adulthood. High school, college, job. The air around him is always crisp and always refreshing. He learns to bake.
“Hold all questions ‘til the end please, miss,” he teases, squeezing her side and listening to her giggle. “Their names were Dan and Clarence.” He applauds himself for his subtlety. “So Dan and Clarence were best friends, and they loved each other very much. They grew up laughing and playing and even built their very own treecastle! They spent every day together, and when they were older, Clarence wrote a play. Do you know what a play is, bug?” She nods, still fiddling with his buttons. “So Clarence wrote a play about two boys who were boyfriends.” Emma’s eyes widen.
When the door shuts behind them, Cas takes his camera to his room and returns to find Dean in the living room peeling off his shirt. Cas clears his throat, and when Dean turns, Cas swears he sees a blush on Dean’s face.
“I’m gonna get you home, Dean,” Cas mutters, though it seems like he’s mostly talking to himself, since Dean’s too fucking cold to have made any indication that he was back in the realm of semi-consciousness.
“Well I’m sure eating pancakes is by far the weirdest thing someone has ever asked you to do,” Cas says, deadpan, and Dean surprises him by laughing.
Cas sits up blearily as they park, then blinks at the bunker with about as much enthusiasm as he’s approached the rest of the humanness so far. Meaning, with nothing but a grim resignation and a tight clench of his jaw. Dean’s stomach rolls.
“Well don’t leave me in suspense,” Dean says with a snort. His fingers trace the lines in Cas’ back. The years melt away between them.
“Um,” Cas says, looking to Dean for guidance, but he is too shocked to respond. “Yeah. Okay,” Cas stammers finally, turning away from Dean to look at Meg.
It goes through him like a shot, and though he’s crumpled on the un-ground nearly frozen solid, it’s enough to make him turn his head, and then,
“He wouldn’t budge. He got that stubborn little set in his jaw and wouldn’t cave.” Dean can see it now. They are fighting over pizza toppings. They are fighting over a movie to watch. They are fighting over a million little things, but they are not fighting over Cas leaving, never about Cas leaving because Cas would not leave. “He said to tell you he meant it. Said you’d know what he meant.”
"Wow," she says when he is finished. She straightens her clothes, smooths down her hair, and looks back at Dean with a grin. “Are you quite sure it isn’t
This chapter is the reason for the rape/non-con warning... Just thought I'd give you a bit of a heads up.
“Good,” he says with a smile. April gives Castiel another smile before pushing herself away from him, leaving him lying there naked and alone. He stares after her for a long moment, watching the curve and sway of her walk as she makes her way to her desk. She dresses smoothly, never sparing Castiel another glance before she unlocks the door and leaves. Her smell is all over him, clinging to his skin in the way Dean always did.
," she mimics, stealing his words from moments ago and ignoring the main point of his words. Dean must be safe. "Cas, you’re not broken. You know that right?”
“I’m still mostly a virgin, so we’re good there. We should probably still use condoms, just in case.” Dean can see the wheels turning in Cas’ brain as he goes down his mental checklist, but Dean has been smacked across the face by the word 'virgin,' floored by the realization that sooner or later, Dean will be expected to have sex with Cas. He pulls away a bit.  “What?" Cas asks, brushing gently at Dean's hair, taking in Dean's wide eyes with concern. "You didn’t know I was a virgin? You’re my best friend. I’d tell you if I got laid.” Dean barely hears him. “Dean, what is it?” Cas asks, bringing his hand back around to Dean’s face. The touch startles him back to reality.
“No!” he half-shrieks. “Sam,” he then sighs, irritated and embarrassed. “Did you give Jess her present yet?” he asks, anything to change the subject, and Sam grins widely.
His legs shake on the first step, knees falter a bit on the second, but on the third, his shoulder square back and his stride takes on purpose.
any time soon anyway,” she says, and Dean freezes. His eyes flick back open, first to stare at his daughter, at her green eyes and long, blonde hair, and then to stare at his wife, her cold demeanor and heartless actions.
“I’ve never had a friend before,” he says finally, but it doesn’t sound like it saddens him. It just sounds like facts falling from the small child’s lips. Dean frowns. He had lots of friends at his old school. Ash and Chuck and Victor, and he was even friends with that girl named Donna. Now though, now he only has Cas.
,” Gabe shouts, pumping his hips for emphasis, causing Cas to groan into Dean’s shoulder and Dean to snort.
When he gets back to his room, he finds Lucifer in their room, folded in his bed, dead to the world. Castiel rolls his eyes and sits at the little desk built into the wall, desk light turned on and pen in hand. He spends a long while staring at the paper, sifting through his emotions until he feels like he has words. He starts with his mother.
"If you have someone you love," she begins gently, fiddling with the photo in her hands. "Hold on to him, make sure he knows you need him now more than ever, and go through the steps, Cas. Just do it. Hold on to him, and make your way through the steps as quickly as possible. Put a wall up around all the bullshit they’ll tell you, because they’re going to tell you some bullshit, and go home to him.” Cas stares at her for a long while, but she is looking at Gilda.
Dean immediately perks back up. He flicks another piece of the imposter-bacon into Miracle’s mouth. “Speaking of, how was the reunion?” It only takes a quick waggling of his eyebrows to make Sam choke on his eggs. “Something worthy of The Notebook, I hope. Or Fifty Shades, I don’t judge.”
“Well, you two look like you have things covered. Personally, I think my eyes might explode soon.” Dean rubs the balls of his hands against his eyes for emphasis. The chair screeches against the floorboards when he rises. “I’ll be outside if you need me.”
“I just want to sleep.” The Empty shuffles. All its movements are choppy and listless. The thing’s going off the total deep end.
He hears Jack’s voice start to come through the walls now. “I tried to bring him back, Sam. I promise.”
“You hear that, jackass?” There’s no way Cas can hear him from the Empty, but Dean finds himself praying again in spite of it. “You made the kid sad. Hope it keeps you rolling in your grave.”
to be happy, then the Empty always comes and it always takes Cas. Game over, bad ending, do not pass go. Another failure in the life of Dean Winchester.
Dean’s mouth is full with the response he cannot bring himself to acknowledge, the one scenario he has not yet played through his mind:
It wouldn’t feel right without Cas. It wouldn’t feel right without Sam either, or Jack. But Dean Winchester is used to moving on with some empty pieces. Who cares if this one feels like it took a whole chunk out of him?
Between the four of them (with Miracle appointed by Dean as the Impala’s watchdog), the hunt goes down fairly smoothly as far as those things go. Jack forces them to stop at a hokey roadside diner right off the highway for a celebratory lunch. Eileen eggs Dean into tag-teaming the diner’s infamous burger stack challenge and together, as Sam looks on with comical nausea, they manage to slog through the entire dish of grease-soaked meat and bread. The diner hangs a photo of them on the wall, signed and dated and all.
Sam clears his throat. He’s been working up to something, and he’s clearing the space for it now. “What happened to him that night? Was it Billie? You never really said.”
“I’m tired of this game,” it says, and swipes it arm to the side. It sends Miracle skidding across the room into one of the bookcases. He whimpers, making no attempt to get up, but otherwise seems fine. This doesn’t stop Dean from seething.
“Sorta?” Jack flexes his hands out in front of himself. Briefly, his eyes glow before snuffing out again. “I haven’t really tested them out recently.”
Now how’s that for a starting place? Dean feels a low simmer of hurt build up in his gut. Before Cas can edge another word out, Dean is already up on his feet. “If you ever pull an assbackward trick like that again, I’ll kill you myself.”
he mouths, pointing to the scythe. Jack maneuvers the scythe around the table and slides it across the floor to Dean.
Any other day, Dean would have grumbled about clearing the dishes. Today he waves Sam aside with a mumbled “yeah yeah” and sets to work. Miracle stands in the doorway, ears perked up like he wants to eavesdrop but can’t bring himself to leave Dean.
“The more it bothers you, the more he’s going to say it,” Eileen points out. She gets a sly look to her eye, glancing over at Dean before saying to Sam, “But I guess that makes me the Meat Woman now, so… get used to it?”
“You said he’s not dead, right? So we can try to find him. But…” Sam hesitates, the next thing he says dipping out of Dean’s hearing range. Miracle, apparently the noisiest dog on the planet, is already halfway down the hallway. Dean follows suit.
Several hours later, and the void remains suspended in the library. Dean is half-asleep, jerking back awake every time his head lolls. “Go take a nap or something, I’ll wake you up if anything happens,” Sam says, his own head resting on his fist as he flips again through Rowena’s spellbook.
There is no fanfare, no villainous quip, when the Empty raises Cas’s blade above its head, poised to kill. Nor is there any sense of victory when Dean surges across the room, the Empty’s powers a vice around his heart. It’s not supposed to happen like this. I just got you back, Dean thinks. The horrid biting hole in his chest can’t just be from the Empty’s powers mashing his guts into pulp anymore.
It’s enough of a distraction for Miracle to get in his own hit against the Empty. Looking for all the world like Cujo, Miracle snaps his teeth around the back of the creature’s thigh. The Empty howls. Black, sludgy ooze bubbles up from the wound.
he could have said. It doesn’t sound very much like a lie, and damn if it doesn’t scare Dean to think he might have been sitting on this feeling for years. Back in the early days of their acquaintance, when Cas had just starting sticking around, Dean had just been happy to have a friend again — an angel to boot too, harder to kill than all the others. Now, he thinks, he can understand what Cas had said about just being. It had been enough, with Cas always by his side, to call this thing friendship. Why risk admitting what it really was when there was nothing broken to fix?
“Come here, Cas,” Dean says, offering the space under his arm. The other one comes up to cup the back of Cas’s head. “You have shit timing.”
Dean works the problem out in his head, running down Cas’s last moments over again in his head. Plug in absolute silence: a bust. Plug in a sterner plea: another bust. Cas was working on flawed logic. If all it takes is fucking
“If you’ll do the same.” Cas pulls out of Dean’s arms, holds him out at arm’s length. His eyes hold a depth of ardency.
All the fight leaves Dean just as it flares in Cas. Fucking hell, the angel has a point, and Dean doesn’t like it. Dean collapses back on the bed. “So we gotta go cold turkey on the sacrifice, noted. Make sure you forward that to Sam and Jack, lord knows they could use the memo, too.” This isn’t at all how he wanted this conversation to go, he realizes now. He feels deflated all of a sudden.
“You should come with us though,” Sam says, and Dean has to wonder if maybe his brother’s been playing a convoluted long-con to get Dean out of the Bunker. “It’s been awhile since you and Eileen have seen each other.”
“You’re a cranky baby that missed its nap, we get it. Skip to the part where you leave and never come back.”
“Are you sure you’re okay? I mean, I’m still upset about Cas, so I can’t even imagine what you’re feeling.”
In his pocket, Dean’s phone rings. It’s Sam. He lets the call time out, go to voicemail. When he’s sure Sam has hung up, he puts the phone to his ear and listens.
This puts Dean on guard. “Nothing.” He knows how cruel it makes him sound, sees it in the grimace on Sam’s face.
All of Dean’s aches decide in this moment to flare up. “Go team,” he says halfheartedly, pulling out a chair and falling into it. He groans. “Make it quick, Sammy, I’m exhausted.” Sam pays him no mind, already reaching for one of the spellbooks. Jack sets about clearing the table for him.
amen-less and a sinner’s best repent. He flips down the covers of his bed, crawls in with Miracle at his back, and lays listlessly for half the night staring at the ceiling. The bloody jacket hanging on the foot of his bed strikes a phantom ache into his shoulder.
“Okay, alright,” Sam says, still processing, “when Cas gets back we gotta talk to him about timing. And emotions. Noted.” He swiped a hand over his scalp. “God, he says he loves you. And?”
Dean downs the rest of the bottle and massages the bridge of his nose. His hand stills in Miracle’s fur. The dog whimpers. “I’m tired, man. I’m old, I’m tired, I’m done. I just want the easy way out for once.” And a place to retire, some bungalow on a beach, a jetty to go fishing in the afternoon. Somewhere with no monsters, or nothing more complicated than a nest of vamps every other Tuesday. Something somewhere normal.
The moment, however, doesn’t last for very long. Ever the cockblock, Sam calls out for the two of them. He sounds uptight. Dean pulls away from Cas with a grimace, feeling the sudden loss of heat like a panging absence. “I’m calling for a raincheck,” he says pointedly and laughs at Cas’s doe-eyed look. There has to be some sort of brag for making an angel of the lord look like that, Dean thinks smugly, before he and Cas are running off towards the library.
“Sit down before you fall over. Jesus Christ, man, you look like shit.” Perhaps not the kindest thing to say to your crush, Dean thinks, but who gives a damn at his age? He kicks out the chair next to him and pats the seat. Haltingly, Cas takes it.
“Don’t flatter yourself, we’ll manage just fine,” Sam says, cheeky. Even Jack looks up from his book with a smirk tugging at his lips.
“I think they’re what woke me up,” Cas says, and it’d be sweet if it weren’t such a blatant misdirection. Sam starts cackling in the corner. If he had anything at hand besides the scythe, Dean would throw it at Sam in a heartbeat. Cas continues, “Your prayers might have even opened that rift for me, though I suppose God’s rogue powers helped loosen the barrier. Which, by the way, might be a problem for us down the road.”
“Happy birthday, son,” John says, eyes gleaming and a smile on his face. Dean thinks he looks sadistic as hell. Dean looks to the bored receptionist for help, for concern, for anything that says ‘if this man lays a hand on you, I’ll do more than pretend I never saw.’ He’s not scared of his father. He’s never been. Or at least…that’s what he keeps telling himself.
enough that Dean has the single, chugging thought that he much prefers this end of the exchange before the cold drags him under.
The lunch table the next day is crowded with its usual suspects. Jess, Sam, Cas, Dean, and Lisa. They all sit together and they laugh together. Dean keeps stealing glances at Cas, all the while imagining his lips on Cas’. He knows it has reached a crisis point. He keeps watching Cas laugh. Even with his fucking hot girlfriend slyly sliding her hand up his thigh, he watches Cas. He watches him, watches his every blink, his every inhale…right up until a new face arrives at their lunch table. Even if the new face hadn’t been wearing a v-neck that practically showed her nipples, the smile that she brings out of Cas is enough to make Dean see her in a new light, one that makes Dean hate her.
When they pull up beside the quaint little house fit for a white picket fence, Sam jumps out of the car and bounds up the steps. Dean turns the volume down so they don’t get a noise complaint called on them, and watches as Sammy raps against the door with his knuckles. Jessica comes out a few minutes later in a thick, white sweater, hair twisted back but falling into her face. She grins at Sam like he hung the moon, and Dean quietly loves her for that. It reminds him of the way he’d seen Cas look at him so many times, even as kids.
“Love you, bug,” Dean murmurs, skimming his fingers over her corn silk hair. He turns away from her and moves to hang her princess dress back in the closet. He steals one last look at her steadily moving chest and fluttering eyes before smiling and leaving her room.
“Cas, where are you going?” he calls after him, and when Cas does not respond, Gabe runs after his little brother and barely manages to slide into Cas’ car before it is speeding down the highway. “Where the hell are we going?” Gabe demands, clicking his seat belt into place in hopes of counteracting Cas’ outrageous driving.
Just looking at it and thinking about giving it to Dean makes Cas’ heart skip two, three times in his chest. He takes a pen from his pocket and scrawls next to the hamster inside:
Staring down at her, he forgets every unhappiness he’s ever known. He forgets his parents abandoning him. He forgets finding his sister dead. He forgets losing Dean. He forgets every disappointment along the way. Staring down at her, her tiny blue eyes staring back, he thinks every heartache up until now has been to balance the sheer happiness of this moment.
“Told me what, dear?” She asks, setting her clipboard to the side and smiling at him. Her eyes are cold.
“There are worse ways I could have found out,” Sam says with a shrug and a small smile. “At least you were clothed this way.” Dean snorts and stands, ready to make his way inside. When Sam stands, Dean wraps and easy arm around his shoulder and begins to lead him inside feeling lighter than he has in weeks. “By the way,” Sam says before they get through the screen door. “You guys haven’t...here...in your room or anything, right?” Sam asks, that horrified look coming back to mingle with desperate hopeful. Dean shakes his head.
“Keep it objective, pal,” Judge Mills says to the lawyer, but he just nods and raises his eyebrows expectantly at Dean.
but Gabriel wasn’t about to ask their mother. Gabe doesn’t understand it. He doesn’t understand what could possibly have ripped Dean and Cas apart, and the allure of that mystery has been enticing him for ten years. Every time he sees that checked out look in Cas’ eyes, he wonders where Dean went, why he left and took Gabe’s baby brother with him.
On to brighter subjects! I want to thank you all so much for reading and living the first part of this journey with me. You guys give me life with your sweet and expressive comments,
The light glinting from Dean’s wedding ring catches Cas’ eye, wrapping the coil around his heart even tighter. Dean continues.
“He didn’t,” Cas replies, and though his voice is dismissing, hope bubbles up inside of him, fast and dangerous and overwhelming.
“Oh, speaking of which,” Lisa says, raising her voice a little and turning to Cas. “I don’t appreciate you stealing my boyfriend,” she says, and Dean’s eyes snap to Cas, feeling sure the horrified look he sees there is reflected in his own face. Even Sam and Jess are looking over now, knowing and sadistic smiles growing on their faces.
“I love you too, by the way,” Cas murmurs, his thumb running along the seam of Dean’s blue jeans. Now when Cas braves a look over to Dean, there is definitely a soft smile gracing those lips.
Dean thinks mournfully. He takes one last look around at the empty pizza boxes, the empty beer cans, the endless piles of dirty clothes and dirty pasts before leaving, not bothering to lock the door behind him.
“Emma didn't come in today,” the woman had said, and when Sam had told Dean he’d been on his phone for an hour calling Lydia and Lydia’s office and Lydia’s favorite coffee shop and anywhere else he thought he might find her. When he finally managed to get her on the phone, he’d almost cried with relief.
So what if he doesn’t want to sit and watch Cas laugh at everything Meg says. He’s not jealous. He’s
“He makes me eat yucky food sometimes,” she says, sticking out her tongue in disgust, and Dean misses her so much it physically hurts.
sitting the fuck down, and stands. He finds Bobby at his desk in the library, curled over a pile of papers written with a graceful hand.
“Hey Jessie,” Dean says with a grin, savoring the eye roll Jess gives at the nickname. The couple crawls into the truck together, Jess worrying her scarf before settling. Dean watches the blush creep across Sam’s cheeks as he takes her hand. He wonders how long he’ll blush when he touches her, and he hopes it’s a long time. He wants his little brother to keep this wonderment. God knows he always felt the heat when Cas touched him, be it the brush of their hands or something more…
thought Dean was still unconscious—that he finds himself tumbling out of Cas’ arms and onto the not-ground.
Cas stands outside of Dean’s door for a moment, listening to His bare back scrape against the wood of the door before He’s finally sitting. Cas can picture Him: opposite the wood, elbows on knees, head in hands, heart breaking for His little girl.
“Alright,” Dean murmurs, pulling back and lining his cock up with Cas’ tight hole before pushing slowly past the ring of muscle, letting out a shaky exhale for every millimeter he feels Cas around him. He feels Cas, despite the shaking of his hands, relax beneath him, allowing Dean complete access. “Fuck,” he hisses when he is fully buried in Cas. His hands are threaded through Cas’, his forehead resting on Cas' shoulder as he reigns the control it takes not to slam into Cas again and again because he’s so fucking hot and tight.
” she says, practically a sneer as she twirls her pen around her fingers. “How is he doing?” Cas’ eyes narrow in frustration.
When Dean gets back to his house, Lydia is waiting, her back rigid with annoyance. Emma, however, runs straight to Dean, jumps up into his arms and clutches him with her arms and her legs.
“How did you do this? It’s been six years, and it still hurts so much every god damned day. How did,” Cas hiccups. “How did you live after Sam?” Jess takes a long moment, one that Cas uses to continue to sob.
“I wasn’t sure if I’d ever hear from you again! I sent you another letter, but it got sent back, said the addressee no longer lived there!” Cas laughs at the eccentricities in her voice.
“Cas,” Dean asks, pulling gently at Cas’ shoulders so he can look at him, but Cas refuses to leave. His grip is a vise around Dean’s waist, his tears pooling rapidly in the hollow over Dean’s collarbone. He smells like oil and plaster.
But eventually, Cas does go home. Well, he goes back to his empty apartment. Like he told Charlie, it’s not really home without Dean…Even so, he flicks on the lights and is greeted by silence. Sam is probably at work, and who knows where Gabe is. All Cas knows is that four mornings ago, he was standing here in the kitchen, cooking with Dean’s arms slung low around his waist, and now, Cas has cost Dean his wife, his daughter… Cas turns the lights back off and goes to his room.
“Cas…” Dean says slowly. “I don’t mean to fan the flames of your disaster, but…the whole play was staged.” Dean grins as the words reach Cas’ hunched form. He straightens a bit in the darkness.
“Dirty needle, dirty sex, dirty blood, who knows. She’s probably been infected for years with no idea.” Cas says nothing, just stares at the road ahead. He’s still got miles and miles to go before he gets to her, and the anger is still hot and present, fighting like hell for the forefront of his attention. He knows that if he thinks about how much he still loves her, the anger will lose, and he will not make it back home.
“My…little bee,” Cas rasps, and at that, Mary bursts into tears, kicking off her shoes and crawling into bed beside her father. She puts her head on his chest, wraps her arms around his middle, takes special care not to disturb the tangle of wires the hospice nurse rigged, and sobs. Cas shushes her with his hissing breaths and wraps an arm around her shoulders.
“It’s okay. I knew all along,” he tells her, looking down to his hands. They are sparkly from Mary’s latest piece of artwork. The glitter seems to stick to everything but the paper.
“Hey,” he says, pulling up to the curb where Cas is walking, his backpack bouncing between his shoulders. “Need a ride?”
“Gabriel is bisexual and had been kicked out two years earlier for coming out. I hadn’t heard from him in months when I came out, but that very night, he picked me up on the side of the street without a word and took me back to his place. We’ve been in California ever since.”
“Let’s go see her,” he says finally, giving the women beside him one last smile before starting towards the doors.
"Well, yes. I knew we couldn't do this 'friends with benefits' stuff forever. I've seen the movies. It was either going to end here," Cas pauses to kiss Dean, and when he pulls away, his eyes are incredibly sad as he thinks of the other possibility. "Or with us apart, and I mean really apart. I think I was just trying to figure out if I would ever be happy without you."
“You stop your temper tantrum,” she says sternly, brushing the water off of her arms before she speaks again but softer. “Sam’s been telling me that you aren’t doing so great without Cas.”
Over the next two days, Dean hardly has the time to sneak away and be alone with Cas. What makes it worse is that, since his own family is away, Cas is always there at Dean's, sitting a respectable distance away, smiling politely at what ever Bobby says, touching Dean only what is platonically acceptable. There's the occasional shoulder touch...the ‘accidental’ hand brush...the discreet foot sliding up Dean’s leg under the dinner table, and all the while Cas, hands folded innocently under his chin, carries on a perfectly normal conversation with Bobby about something Dean is too busy trying not to rut against Cas to listen to. It is all driving Dean relatively crazy, and when Dean decides he can no longer take the torture of Cas being so damn close and very obviously off-limits, he stands abruptly from the table, turning every eye and bringing a blush to his already bothered cheeks.
