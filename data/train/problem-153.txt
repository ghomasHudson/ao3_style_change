“Ah, that’s why you’re cranky!” the prince exclaimed. “You’re no use to me like this. Maybe we could find you something to eat down there,” he pointed towards a grove of weeping willows at the bottom of a gentle slope to the left of their path.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he pushed through the shrubbery to reach the side of a small, frozen lake. The snow was thinner on the ground around the lake, sheltered as it was by a thick barrier of weeping willows, their drooping branches glistening in the sun like delicate crystal chandeliers. The bleak winter landscape was alive with multicoloured lights, flickering softly as the chilly breeze gently pushed against the willow's branches.
Mycroft pushed the study door open, concealing his trepidation under an icy glare directed at the footmen waiting outside.
Sherlock was rescued from any questioning that would surely follow by the Master of Ceremonies, who had opened the Ballroom door and was making his way inside to announce their entrance to the guests.
It’s interesting to know that John wouldn’t pick up his phone all through the day and only answered his sister and therapist’s worried comments in the afternoon. Afterwards, he continued to not pick up his
Sherlock froze from where he was hushing John and stroking the man's hair gently. “What about them?” he murmured, pulling John closer.
leave. You’re a fool not to. I just admitted to wanted to hurt you, to make you bleed, to cut your very skin from your body!”
, and so he only learned to follow. While the memories of learning to dance on his fathers’ feet were good ones, for they were the scant few times John remembered a sober happy man in place of the abusive drunkard he suffered, he couldn’t bear to hold Sherlock about the shoulders like some wilting maiden. Sherlock took his hand and tugged him up gently.
But if John was honest, all of that was currently at the back of his mind. As Sherlock sat on the floor in front of their coffee table, carefully watching an instructional video on napkin folding (“Sydney or swan, John?”
“Ah, thanks?” John said, bewildered as his strange flatmate drifted into the kitchen, making them a pot of tea.
. There was nothing left of him but misery and destitution. Whatever fate thought he needed; it could go fuck itself.
“And no one can see me like you.” John agreed with a sad smile. “God help me.” He added with a laugh. Sherlock slowly, hesitantly, reached out a hand, John took his own hand out of his coat pocket, meeting Sherlock halfway. They stood in silence for a moment, the night air ruffling their hair slightly.
“Ok,” John said, thinking slowly, “ok, how 'bout after your grandparents died? You said you purposefully wrecked that wing of your mind palace.” Sherlock grunted in acknowledgment. “What was
Greg looked about him and motioned the boy closer, when Sherlock stepped up to the bars, Greg leaned in. “How’d you like to be of
of delight. Save for Mycroft, who looked just as uncomfortable as his little brother with the display.
“Ok,” John said two weeks later, nursing a sprained wrist from a run in with a rather nasty identity thief the week prior. “How about information that you delete? I mean, did you
“Let me take care of you,” Sherlock said quietly, thumb stroking over John’s inner wrists. John fought himself for another moment, half of his brain twisting and writhing in an animal fear, part of his brain serenely quiet for the first time since he awoke in that dilapidated warehouse, since he was shot in the desert, since he signed the dotted line and got himself shipped off to war, since he left home at 18, since his father straddled his chest at 16 and forced a bottle of liquor down his throat, hell, perhaps for the first time since the day he was born.
As John lay in bed, their door cracked least the girl find herself needing anything, he stared at Sherlock’s face. The man was illuminated by the soft light coming from the bathroom, (light on, door open in case the girl needed the loo and couldn’t see in the dark), and the hazy moon filtering in their window between gauzy curtains and London fog.
They were seated in a circle, some on reindeer pelts, others on wooden crates. The sun shone brightly on their reddened faces while they ate their portions of bread and salted fish. John had quickly finished his own portion and stood a bit away from them, by the newly made water channel. He was conspicuously throwing a stick for Harry to catch while trying to eavesdrop on the men’s conversation.
He is frustrated that they haven’t caught the bomber yet, disappointed that Sherlock isn’t worried about the victims and perhaps a bit jealous that the bomber has engaged Sherlock’s attention in a way John feels he can’t compete with. That shows through in the way that he describes Sherlock’s actions through the case.
“Trade deals, they’re so boring…” Anderson said, taking a hearty bite of the confection and spreading powdered sugar over his front. “I just tune them out when they start discussing taxes, and tariffs…” he trailed off, dusting himself disinterestedly.
“Oh, yeah, I slept fine,” he assured her, climbing his chair. He waited patiently while Mrs Turner pushed his chair forward and tucked his napkin under his chin.
With a sigh of relief, Mycroft unclasped the sapphire pin at his neck and felt his heavy cape fly off his shoulders. He turned around to see the shrinking speck of burgundy disappear into the thick grey clouds below and felt like his problems disappeared with it as well. He would live his life as he was meant to, alone with his powers, where he could hurt no one else. To his amazement, that decision filled him with a novel sense of relief, of... freedom?
John’s cheeks became beet red. “Well, someone threw all my supplies at the wolves!” he argued, shooing away Harry’s concerned sniffing.
Sherlock raised both his hands placatingly, regretting his indiscretion. “Calm down. Please, call me Sherlock,” he added for good measure.
“Oh- My brother’s cape. He wore it to the coronation with my mother’s sapphire pin - that’s probably what scraped you,” Sherlock explained
“Well, maybe they need to make themselves clearer,” he answered moodily and sat at the foot of the queen size bed, duffle bag at his feet.
“It won’t do to have you fall off the bed like this,” she carried on, “maybe it was too early for a big boy bed. We’ll put back the rail guards and-”
As soon as he was on the roof, he heard a door being slammed somewhere down the hall. He ran across the rooftops as fast as he could until he reached his parent’s bedroom window. As he approached, he could hear his mother’s urgent tones.
“I have no idea…” Sherlock admitted and let his head fall on his forearms. “I’ve read every book in the library, catalogued every plant and insect in the garden, played every piece of music I know until I can’t hear it any longer. They won’t even let me in the kitchen anymore since the pig’s tongue debacle…” he lamented, “I’m so bored I could die.”
“Hullo there, your princeness. I just thought to check in on you, see how you were doin’,” he said, as casually as one would greet a friend on the street.
To his surprise, the prince’s smile turned into an earnest, boyish grin, that constricted John’s chest in a way he steadfastly ignored. But the smile was short lived, as Sherlock, catching himself, quickly schooled his features into a determined scowl.
Sherlock waved away Jim’s concerns, “Yes, I’m fine, don’t worry.” He was fine, better than fine, actually.
“What are we doing here, exactly?” Jim asked, swirling the glass of wine he had snagged from a passing waiter.
“Will you wait a-” Sherlock had finally stepped on the lowest branch when he felt John’s hand grabbing his ankle and pulling him down. The prince fell in a flurry of snow, bottom-first onto the sledge’s floor.
“Go put on your robe, first,” he tied the sash primly over his pudgy middle. “Mummy won’t like it if you catch a cold.”
The Grand Stamford nodded and raised his staff in the air, pointing the crystal at the flickering image. “I recommend we remove all magic from the young prince’s head, even memories of magic, to be safe.”
He could feel his cheeks heat and gave silent thanks that no one could witness his lapse. He shifted back to the edge of the bed, making the matress creek. The noise must have disturbed his bedmate from his deep sleep because John mumbled incoherently, turned on his back and, surprisingly, stopped snoring. Sherlock freezed.
“I said, do you want to solve a murder?” Mycroft repeated, a hint of frustration permeating his tone.
It wouldn’t take a very smart police officer to assume John was the shooter. He admits to having seen Sherlock and Hope with the pills and to have seen Hope getting shot. That could only have been done if he were on the next building, and there was a
I wanted to say thanks to all the wonderful people who have been leaving kudos and writing such nice comments! ❤️ I love you all!
“This was some ten years ago,” Sherlock remarked, “I had some ideas about it, but Father wouldn't let me access the evidence,” he added, unable to keep a small hint of disappointment from permeating the distant memory. Not one to contain his curiosity, Sherlock opened the envelope with slightly trembling fingers and took out a thick stack of assorted documents and handwritten notes.
The unfortunate prince tumbled down the steep hill with his head tucked in his arms, until he rolled to a stop at the bottom of an ice cold stream. As soon as he touched the water, instinct took over and he jolted up and away from the stream, mindless of direction or plan.
Things started to look promising when Sherlock noticed a couple across the room, whispering angrily and pointing accusing fingers at each other. He was so engrossed in trying to figure out the cause for the fight that he almost jumped when an unfamiliar voice whispered uncomfortably close to his left ear.
Billy’s body was as gaunt as his face, his limbs long and wiry. For someone who supposedly worked with water and soap all day, he didn’t smell like he gave his body the same treatment as his windows. He sat next to Sherlock, a respectful couple of feet away from the prince.
“Ah, it’s good to see you looking so rosy-cheeked!” he told Sherlock, stepping back. “I’m going to prepare the spare room for you. You must stay the night!”
Sherlock let out a nervous breath and uncrossed his arms. “The governess’s husband. Powers was having an affair with her. The husband found out and decided to have his revenge using the old passage.” He approached his brother’s desk and opened the envelope, extracting an old interrogation report. “He worked as a carpenter at the time, had the skill and tools to open the old passage and then close it up again after the deed was done.”
He drew a shaky breath, trying to keep the tears from spilling over. The lonely prince turned and sat himself against the door. There was no point in being anywhere else, he realized.
The sight of the smiling window washer filled Sherlock with a mix of annoyance and relief. He jolted from the bed and made for the window, trying to control a vague sense of nausea that filled his senses as he stood upright.
His heart gave a painful twinge at the memory of a much smaller foot stomping to freeze a marble floor. That was the last time he had willfully used his powers.
"I know that!" Ella interrupted, startling Harry. "But why aren’t you home? Won’t your parents be worried?" she turned to John with concern on her rough features.
Looking at him more carefully, Sherlock realized that the man was a few years younger than him - nineteen, if he had to guess. His hair was mousy-brown and styled into a very unfortunate buzzcut. His features, although burned from the sun, telegraphed a fragile health. His eyes were sunken, his cheeks sallow and he was already missing a few teeth.
Sherlock ducked his head to hide his smile at the obvious ploy. “Ugh, you’ve convinced me,” he conceded. “In fact, I could use your help.”
Sherlock gave the bottle a final wary look before hiding it in his coat pocket.  “How do I know this won’t just kill me?” he called out to Billy, already lowering himself on his pulley.
As he added walls and doors and windows to his new home, Mycroft's mind never once turned to the one he left behind. Unlike Londondalle Palace, his new palace was growing into an imposing rectangular building, filled with straight angles, sharp roofs and carefully interspaced balconies. The ceiling finally closed over Mycroft's head and dripped down into an intricate crystal chandelier, that glowed blue and purple in the dark room.
Sherlock coughed awkwardly while keeping his eyes resolutely forward, trying to ignore how he could feel Jim's body heat near his left shoulder.
“I didn't! I did?” he asked, surprised. Before he knew it, Sherlock was being steered towards the bathroom in his robe and slippers.
“I can’t!” Sherlock declared solemnly. He flopped on his back and stretched his arms over his head and towards the window, as if trying to reach the night sky.
The young woman turned to John, with tears in her eyes. “I’m sorry sir, but we have no other available rooms. Maybe I can call the nearest inn, see if they-”
I've decided to divide this chapter into two smaller ones for readability. Next chapter should be out soon, with a new song!
Finally making up his mind, Anderson picked up a pastry and leaned back against the table with fabricated ease. Something about his self-satisfied air made Sherlock’s skin crawl.
The room was quiet while they ate, the silence broken only by the crackling of the fire and Harry’s loud chewing.
“Nice choice,” said Mycroft, when the orchestra had resumed its playing and the guests returned to their drinking and dancing.
He heaved a theatrical sigh himself and sat on his bed. “Alright, alright, no need to throw a tantrum.”
His companion shrugged dismissively. “We simple folk grow up listening to stories of elves, trolls and draugr. Magic is as real to us as the sun and the seasons…”
Sherlock chuckled for a second before coming to his senses and grabbing John by the shoulder “- wait, no!”
From the corner of his eye, he saw John’s head turning to him in surprise. “We will?” his friend asked in astonishment.
This is one of the entries that have been changed (again, does anyone know if there is a saved version of the deleted posts?).
Sherlock felt another pair of hands touching his temples and swiftly pushing under his collar to touch his neck. “He’s freezing! We need to get him out of these clothes.”
Mycroft still wasn’t up, either, but Mrs Turner didn’t seem to mind it. She puttered about the nursery, picking up the princes’ toys and folding their discarded clothes, acting like they weren’t even there.
I know this may be just an artistic choice, that they decided to make the vase slide to underline that the center of our universe, that what really matters here, is Sherlock.
Alone with the seagulls, he cracked open the door on one of the most secluded rooms in his Mind Palace to poke at the ache in his heart, if only for a second. There, where he kept his dreams about his future career, he always imagined another presence by his side - a partner to stand by him and share in his adventures. The prince felt his cheeks warm in shame. In his excitement, he had let his innermost urges surface onto his consciousness. Cursing inwardly, he shut the door firmly closed again.
“Don’t you think I’ve read them more than once? More than ten, twenty times?” His father was growing more agitated by the second. Sherlock didn’t think he had ever heard him like this. Had he misbehaved that badly?
The prince made an effort to gather his wits and try to salvage the situation, but all he could summon was an intense feeling of injustice.
Since the original Frozen script described the Ice Harvesters as dressed in typical Sámi clothing, I decided to roll with it and make John Sámi.
He turned slowly around and, sure enough, there was no sledge in sight, only the angry wolves, sniffing and howling on the other side of the gorge.
After being divested of his ruined suit and boots, Sherlock found himself sitting comfortably by the fireplace, clad only in a pair of thick blankets and his underwear, his bare feet curling pleasantly into the carpet.
The ever present shadow of Moriarty (Anonymous) looms. This last bit makes me wonder… Has Moriarty already set up his surveillance system on 221B? Is he already watching Sherlock and John?
“Please don’t look at me like that! I’m not weird, I promise!” Jim said anxiously, “It’s just that I spend so much time alone, sometimes I forget how to make jokes. I’ll shut up.”
Before he knew it, John was pushing a bag onto his hand and throwing him over the dash and onto Harry’s back - an impressive feat for a man his size. It was all Sherlock could do to hold on to the reindeer’s mane and look offendedly back at John.
He raised his chin and took a deep, steadying breath. He wouldn’t fail. He couldn’t. If things went south, he had an escape plan - one that fit in his pocket.
“Maybe he was looking for Agnes’ frozen heart!” Danny suggested. John felt his cheeks heat at the laughter that ensued.
Mycroft raised his icy blue eyes towards his father. “Do you have to go?” he asked in a subdued tone.
Focus as he was on the action below, it was all Sherlock could do to keep from crying out when he heard Jim singing softly into his ear.
Unable to control his enthusiasm anymore, Sherlock broke into a run across the Ballroom, decided on exploring every bit of the Palace and drink in all the energy and change. He would make the most of this day and commit it all into his Mind Palace, where he had built a lovely new room dedicated to the first day of the rest of his life.
Hey guys! This next chapter was getting a bit too big so I decided to divide it in two. This is a smaller chapter to set the tone for the next one, where, you've guessed it, we'll have another song.
When the King and Queen entered Mycroft’s bedroom, they found their eldest pacing back and forth, clearly agitated.
Hundreds of eyes turned towards him as soon as he stepped outside, surprised and delighted to have their king in their midst.
“I really don’t…” Sherlock trailed off when he saw his reflection in the mirror over the wash basin. Above the angry bruise on his forehead he noticed a single curl of white hair nestled among his jet-black curls. He raised his hand to touch it but was cut short when Mrs Turner stepped in front of him to pour water in the basin.
“That man over there, though…” Sherlock gestured at his new suspect, who was apparently ignoring the conversation around him in favour of staring at another man on the other side of the room.
"Everything has to be just so or it's no good.  If a paper chain or glass ball was off I'd sneak back in after dark and rearrange them."
Sherlock gave him a small eye roll but didn't argue further.  "I think I should probably just lie down here," he suggested, motioning to the sofa.
, Sherlock had begun to help John and Mary plan the wedding. Mary's bridesmaids had proven to be quite uninvolved, which was just as well, because Sherlock had found the planning process to be quite enjoyable once he had been able to compartmentalize it from his feelings. As anyone who was close to him could tell, Sherlock was a man of details, and details at a wedding are everything. He was actually... dare he say it... having
He wasn't gay.  He didn't lust after Sherlock's abs or anything like that.  He liked women and was attracted to women and always would be.  But Sherlock transcended gender somehow; John was in love with the most compelling, spellbinding person he'd ever known, and it was just happenstance that he was male.  It had been a long time coming but he felt okay about it.  Sherlock desperately didn't want him to leave and he desperately didn't want to leave him.
Sherlock doesn't argue with that, but looks at him for a long minute.  It's not enough, this bathing thing.  He has to show John what he means to him.  Has to show himself.
Sherlock has bubbling away inside of the cauldron of his mind right now.  The hate, and the fear (although Sherlock didn't often openly admit to fear, not usually), the sense of possessive anger, and the chilling, mind-bending
"It was the only time of year things were consistently cheerful," Sherlock said softly.  "Fairy lights, decorations, the sort.  Could make anybody feel good."  His voice was deep and breathy, adding weight to the stillness of the room.  When John didn't say anything, he continued.  "We always had a grand tree in the hall.  Huge glorious thing.  When you're a small boy it only seems grander.  My parents never decorated it, they let the help do it.  I used to order them about, if you can imagine."
"The tree, the Christmas tree.  It's usually right there," the detective said peevishly, pointing to the corner.  He looked expectantly over to John, shadows of flames from the fireplace licking over his features.
John numbly wonders if this is the event that will sever Sherlock Holmes' last fragile strand of sanity, although on some level he's relieved to see Sherlock snap, cutting the tension that's been building over the past few hours.
"So that's him," he mused to Mary. "Major Sholto." The name still felt strange and offensive on his lips.
John had had a minor girlfriend some years ago who took it all off, and that was pretty fantastic.  He had also rogered a pretty young American doughboy some twenty years earlier who had naturally sparse haircover and was quite smooth.  Had John laid in bed on mornings fucking his own fist to thoughts of a hairless (
"I love it when you play.  I love watching you play too.  It's like you're outside of yourself, it's brilliant."  John knew he shouldn't have been drinking.  Damn it, damn him, why did he have to drink?  But he was so happy right now... Sherlock was near and on the mend, and it was Christmas, and here he was with his head in John's lap.  John hadn't cared much about Christmas for a long time, but suddenly it had meaning again.  "Christmas meant nothing to me for years, Sherlock.  I'm glad you've made it mean something to me again.  I'm glad we can share it together.  I'd have it no other way."  Shut up, John.
; he knew he could love John much better than this, but it certainly wasn't the first time he hadn't approved of his own actions.
Oh yes. Sherlock knew this one well. The two of them, they did seem to automatically connect. And John was, in fact, quite nice, even if Sherlock wasn't.
...his lips on Sherlock's, his hands grasping and pulling at his hair, his chest and arms all around him so he had absolutely no way out...
He starts with the fingers, of all things, pulling each of John's weathered hands into his pale ones, running the sponge softly up and down his arms, leaving cushy lather in its wake.  From there he works on John's chest and neck, taking painstaking care to touch very gingerly around the ligature marks.  John remains silent, just watching him, his eyelids growing heavy once more.  Thoughts slosh around in his brain.  It's quite an intimate act, the realization comes, letting someone else wash you.  Perhaps, in some ways, more intimate than sex.  It involved giving up a bit of control and a tremendous amount of trust.  John feels fairly defenseless at the moment.  Perhaps Sherlock was sensing the same thing, because his cheeks were tinged a light pink.  Could be that or simply just the heat, John supposes.
"I didn't even know they had artificial trees in Finland," John had said, trying desperately to ignore how amused Sherlock was by the whole thing.  Finally he got it upright, though a bit lopsided.  Then they had both dug into the ornaments, which were ancient as well.  John set them on the sofa so Sherlock could keep busy unpacking them.  He held them out for John to retrieve one-by-one, dictating exactly where they should go and getting quite bossy about it if John had anything to say.
Realization sank in that he had, in his adult years, finally tasted happiness before having it swiftly yanked away from him.
"I love you," he said again.  "I love you.  I love your brilliance, I love your ignorance, I love your ridiculous quirks and your addictions, and I want you to go on being your intolerable, stupid, insufferable self until the end of my days."  John leaned in until they were touching foreheads.  His breath ghosted over Sherlock's face, carrying with it a fetching hint of whiskey.  "Until the end of me.  Which, by the way, you will be.
Sherlock has propped his partner up on the sofa with great care, pulling the coffee table closer so John has somewhere to rest his swollen ankle.  John had caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror as he shuffled into the flat, Sherlock helping him up the stairs, stooped to accommodate his arm around his long neck.  Even from across the room, John could see the ligature marks around his own neck.  He doesn't relish the thought of seeing them up close.  The sensitive area of his neck, right under his jaw, is still throbbing pretty badly.  His voice is hoarse and strained, although breathing is much easier than it had been even an hour ago.  He is sore, and exhausted, but he is home with Sherlock now.
"What is it, Sherlock? Thought you wouldn't attend the wedding? Did you think you could manage to keep yourself out of it? You are, you know, the
Deep, heavy breathing settled throughout the room like dew and Sherlock threw his head back, murmuring "Oh...
"Yes," Sherlock gasped, bucking beneath him.  "Yes, please John..."  His heart jumped in his chest as John held him down and pressed him deeper into the mattress.  This seemed to have brought out the beast in him, to Sherlock's dark delight.
John was once told that Sherlock had wanted to be a pirate as a boy.  The thought had made him smile both on the inside and out.  With that imagination, of course Sherlock had wanted to be a pirate.  John certainly did not have a hard time believing that.  John could picture the stubborn little thing now, all dark curls and bright blue eyes and gawky limbs and slight lisp, shoving off for lands unknown in a striped shirt and paper hat.  Perhaps he had been playing pirate at a Christmas party, scribbling deductions down in a captain's log.  The image made him smile and get a bit romantic.
"I did," Sherlock breathed, but it was unnecessary as John's hand had slid below to feel around for itself.  Sherlock spread his legs for better access.
"I loved Christmas as a boy," Sherlock continued, his mind obviously preoccupied with memories.  It was unusual for him to talk this much about his past and John chalked it up to the analgesics, but decided to keep quiet and enjoy the few scraps of Sherlock's life story that were thrown his way.  "Even as I got older and so many things fell away, so many parts of my life sloughed off, it was something to somehow look forward to."
He pulled away from Sherlock's arse, but not before slapping one cheek.  Before Sherlock could get peevish, though, he had his mouth back on the brunet's engorged penis, sucking more forcefully than before.  Sherlock relaxed again and threaded long fingers through silvery-blond hair.
The clock on the mantle makes itself known, a soothing presence of ambient noise.  Calm, reliable, steady.  After pulling his chair to face the sofa, Sherlock sits down, his face whitewashed with agitation.  His mercurial eyes pierce John from five feet away, his expression is still stricken.
John wished so badly he had been there to care for Sherlock during his darkest years, but it was out of his control so he didn't like to dwell on it.
During the day, Sherlock could usually occupy himself well enough to feel alright. He really wanted a smoke more than ever these days, but he somehow managed to come up with ways to get his mind off of it. He knew that smoking would make John angry, and not the Good Angry.
John watches with mild alarm as Sherlock becomes more and more agitated.  He has to quell him somehow.  He's in no condition to deal with the situation if Sherlock goes out and does something stupid.  And in any event, if he is going to shower, it probably would be helpful to have a second person in to help him with his ankle, he supposes.
But oh, if he could just see John smile once again. If he could see that beautiful face light up with a smile and know that he, Sherlock, was the one who put it there.
Sherlock's eyes searched the air in front of him before he clicked through the menus on his iPod to another waltz.
John must've been staring longer than he thought, because he heard Sherlock say, "Oh for God's sakes John,
When John collapsed into his chair, exhausted, Sherlock was still keyed up; he poked at the fire a bit. He shook his leg and tapped his fingers against his mouth, a gnawing uncertainty taking bites out of his insides.
Sherlock, who has been staring at John in silence since he deposited him on his spot on the sofa.  John has been watching him in his peripheral vision.  He's just staring.  Who knew what kind of rockets were firing off behind those eyes.  Finally John turns his head and looks at him squarely.
He did NOT, however, want to share any of these thoughts with Sherlock (not just yet, anyways).  His eyes went all shifty as he tried to suss out exactly what his lover was getting at.
John was already halfway back down his torso.  "Hang on.  You sure look different down here, I want to see if you taste different too."  Gently, gingerly, he picked up Sherlock's heavy, flushed cock and gently sucked with a loose mouth.  In spite of his penchant for danger and excitement, Sherlock had proven to be surprisingly sensitive in bed.  After so many years of being without a partner, it had taken him a bit of time to become accustomed to someone's mouth on him in that way.  A couple of weeks had gone by before he felt completely secure and was able to come from John's mouth alone (a finger up the arse never hurt anything, either).
John feels like he should say something to break the dour mood, but he doesn't really know what, other than
"Thank you," Sherlock rumbles, his voice catching in John's chest as he leans in to smell John's neck.
"Case, what case?" Sherlock shot back.  John regarded him for a moment before it hit him.  The opioids.  The hydrocodone had taken away the pain but had made Sherlock a tad loopy.
John couldn't see it, but Sherlock smiled a bit ruefully.  "Hmm.  Well, to be honest, it takes me back a bit.  To when I was a boy."
The question startled John enough that he literally stopped mid-bite and pulled his teeth back out of his toast, leaving behind tiny buttery divots.  Slowly he turned his head to face Sherlock.
John leaned his head against Sherlock's once again.  "Happy Christmas, you git.  I'm afraid I don't have any gifts for you."  John did feel genuinely bad about that.  He enjoyed the aspect of giving to people he cared about.  "You know, what with what's been going on and all."
Suddenly, Sherlock leans forward and puts his hands on the sides of John's face.  He leans in to take John's bottom lip between his, and then states plainly, "I wish to mark you."
"John, I..." Sherlock could taste John's breath, he was soaking him up like blotting paper, he could smell his love, he could taste it in his soul and it was so damned, hatefully terrifying and new.
"Do you like it?" Sherlock asked with a bit of uncertainty.  The fact that he couldn't deduce the answer said volumes.
John snorted a little.  "Yes, believe it or not, I can imagine it all too well," he said with much mirth.  "No wonder you were telling me where to put things."
He wipes down the rest of John's face, even scrubbing in John's ears like a mother might do to her toddler.  John scrunches one eye shut as the cloth-covered fingers sweep inside of his ears, tickling a bit.  Then Sherlock abandons the cloth and reaches for a cup they keep near the sink, filling it with bathwater and pouring it over John's head.  John looks a bit like a shaggy dog as his fringe sticks to his forehead (his hair's a bit on the long side these days, for him anyway) and he feels a little sheepish but pleasantly surprised as Sherlock's long, shampooed fingers rub at his scalp, working up a lather.  John leans into the touch and feels his neck muscles unwind a bit.  The ten small points of pressure wind and bob around his head, rubbing, feeling, cleaning, making him shiver.  Sherlock doesn't miss a single spot on his scalp, rubbing behind his ears, his temples, even back on the occipital ridge, giving John gooseflesh.  Some more dunks of the cup and John's hair is clean and rinsed.  He smiles gratefully up at Sherlock, quite surprised but touched at his caring behaviour.
"No, John, not there... this one is larger than that one, it goes lower."  Sherlock heaved a heavy sigh so that John knew just how terrible he was at his job.  "No, that one."
Sherlock was hot with shame and regret at Mycroft's voice. "Why did I bother to call someone like you," he seethed into his mobile, fingers poised to end call. But before he could, his brother spoke again.
It was Christmas Eve, and his dear friend was laid up with a nasty injury.  They were both lucky it was just a nasty injury and not a life-threatening one.  The bullet had missed Sherlock's organs but that didn't mean the wound wasn't painful.  On top of that, the detective was so thin and frail.  The last case had been a long one, keeping nourishment out of his friend's body no matter how much of a ruckus John had made.  All John seemed to do anymore was worry about that man.  He loved him so dearly...
"Damn."  Sherlock leaned his head back on the sofa to stretch out his long neck, his eyes focused on the ceiling.  "Hopefully I'll be back in shape by New Year’s."
John did get bruised up a bit; he knows it will take him a few days to recuperate.  He was tripped and taken out from behind while running down a dark alley (really, where else?), punched when he wasn't looking.  John's fairly good with self-defence, but he is a bit out-of-practise these days, admittedly.  Before he even had a chance to react, another attacker appeared and it was two against one, and then a rope or something was wrapped around his neck.  He was nearly strangled.  His memory from there on is a bit of a blur, but he remembers Sherlock yelling a lot, his eyes glowing yellow.  To or at whom he was yelling, John isn't certain.  To his attacker, or into his mobile, or perhaps to John himself?  It wasn't important anyhow, John supposes.  The disturbing image of Sherlock's normally cool, collected visage screwed up and blown out with rage and horror will stick in his mind for a while though, that much was certain.
. He played it from the deepest of depressions to the highest peaks of euphoria and back again. All the old parts were there, but now he could play the newer parts, the parts he added recently that mortified him. The parts where his soul was steeped in John, the way water is made cloudy and more delicious by tea. He played his violin, the strings vibrating on the frequency of John, with all his heart and all his might until he thought his mitochondria might be transcribing John. He played the part of the melody where John saved him, his heart climbing higher, ever higher, spinning off into dizzying fractals. Sherlock's favorite part, though, was the part where he was a tightly-sewn seam and John came along, mercifully, and violently ripped him apart. Here, right
"Hmm?"  John was pouring himself a whiskey in the kitchen.  Sherlock had settled himself on the sofa and had taken right away to complaining about this and that until he made the previous statement.
Of course, Sherlock was quite good at doing absolutely nothing; he spent about a third of his time in a somewhat catatonic state, completely inwardly focused. But this was different than what he was used to, and far more uncomfortable. It felt an awful lot like Before.
John was sympathetic there; after all, he had had the unfortunate experience of being shot once as well, and although he was sure it felt different being shot in the side rather than the shoulder, the image of Sherlock taped up and obviously hurting brought the memory of the agonizing pain back to the forefront of his consciousness.  He was, on some level, happy to have Sherlock released into his own care so that he might ensure his partner's comfort.
Where were the chairs? All the chairs. There used to be more. No, that was wrong. Less chairs. There used to be one more human taking up a chair, so technically less chairs. Sherlock was a genius.
John had nearly died in his arms today.  Amazing, John thinks, how something so harrowingly romantic almost happened to someone as ordinary as he.  It was painful, and frightening, but he really is going to be fine now.  Surely Sherlock ought to know that.  Right?
And what were those lips up to now? John and Mary, off this very night on their Sex Holiday. John would strip off his suit and his pants, his naked body climbing on top of his new wife to mount her, his strong legs and arms pushing her down on the bed, his scent all around her. They knew now that Mary was pregnant, which meant that John probably wouldn't bother using a condom.
John was thankful that Sherlock couldn't see his eyebrows shimmy up towards his hairline.  Sherlock talking about his childhood.  Now they were getting somewhere.
"Your pubic hair coverage is absolutely perfect," Sherlock said decidedly.  "It's everywhere but the shaft.  It's manly.  I love it."  He shifted, turning to face John.  "Besides, they've already got your pubic hair pattern on the menu.  Some people pay to get the shape you have.  Know what they call it?"
Sherlock's brain was adrift in a sea of John's words.  John wanted him near... well of course he did.  But to have it said plainly like that was something in and of itself.  Sherlock wanted no one near him but John.  He had to ask this next thing.  He had to or he was going to drown in himself without ever knowing.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth quirked up softly before he turned his head away again so John could resume petting his hair.
Sherlock began to think of methods he could use to quantify and calculate the ratio of time John spent talking about Major Sholto vs. Sherlock Holmes as his eyes stabbed daggers across the room. More jealousy, white and hot, coated the inside of his head. Clearly Mary had gotten the two of them mixed up. If there was a useful reason for John to yammer on about some washed-up ghost from yesteryear, Sherlock was unable to identify it, and if Sherlock Holmes was unable to identify it, it must not exist.
There was, buried deep within the confines of 221b, an old, fragile box with a rusty hinge. As a boy, Sherlock had tried his hand at carving various flora into the soft wooden exterior, mostly ferns and ivy. He spent hours trying to get each leaf and tendril just right, studying their forms in his mother's garden. There was a fairly good rendition of a daffodil in one corner of the lid that Sherlock had always been especially proud of. Over time, dust had crept up and settled into the nooks and crannies of his childhood art, creating a fine fuzzy coating that couldn't be blown or wiped away no matter how hard he tried.
John watched the dark figure schlumping his way up the staircase with a wary eye, following close behind with outstretched hands should his partner stumble or lose his balance.  The consulting detective should
He quickly calculated probable outcomes to hugging John and decided there was a very real possibility he'd simply latch on like some sort of monstrous Sherlock-barnacle and cause a scene. That would cause awkwardness and John would be left wondering long after Sherlock was dead.
, but in the back of his mind, Sherlock was also aware that this evening he was standing on a precipice. The wedding was going to change everything, regardless of whether he acknowledged it outwardly or not, regardless of whether John claimed it would or not, and suddenly the finality of it all hit him. John hadn't lived with him since he returned from the dead, but Sherlock knew that he could expect his companion to visit less and less, his visits becoming rarer and more perfunctory as his new wife and home tugged him in another direction. John, dropping in on a rainy Tuesday, running up the stairs on a Saturday afternoon, bringing him take-away on a Friday night... soon it would all be nothing more than a ghost of a memory, a haunting presence to follow Sherlock barefoot throughout the lonely, empty flat.
He was really pounding into Sherlock now.  Skin slapped against skin, the bed shook with the force.  John was high on endorphins.
Sherlock felt more lovely heat throughout his body. His smile got even wider. John knew him so well... and what's more, John accepted him. It was a feeling Sherlock hadn't known until he'd met him.
Sherlock hoped that he didn't look deflated, or if he did, that John misconstrued it to be stage fright or some such thing. He pursed his lips a bit.
Sherlock felt an overwhelming heat fan throughout his body. Of course he wasn't an idiot, and had a lot of theoretical knowledge on sex, but it seemed that when the matter pertained to himself, he could never get it to not overwhelm him.
Sunlight was filtering in through the kitchen windows, cutting through the air like some sort of golden butter knife. Dust from 221b bobbed and weaved in its wake. Sherlock had just dropped an eyeball into his tea.
In short, he can smell John, his clean skin, his shampoo, simply because there are literally pieces of him in his nose.
his flatmate had been when they first began a romantic sexual relationship.  True, the experience had been disturbingly pleasant on some levels, but the bite marks had lasted for days, and it had been an argument just to get Sherlock to let him out of the flat to do the shopping.  And that was just because of a mild uneventful kidnapping.  John isn't sure he wants to find out what this case of actual potentially serious bodily harm would cause Sherlock to do in retaliation, especially when John needs rest so badly.
The rhythmic tensing of orgasm in Sherlock's pelvis tugged on John and he gave in, feeling his own orgasm pulse even as he felt Sherlock's cock in his hand twitch at the same time.  John moaned in lusty satisfaction with each shot of semen, but Sherlock, as per usual, was quite silent, having buried his red face in a pillow.
"Here. Follow my lead first and then I'll follow yours." Sherlock hesitated. "Just... imagine I'm Mary."
Today not might be one of those days, he thought, growling ferally with pleasure.  Squelching noises filled the room as he slid in and out.
Sherlock couldn't find a dance partner; he looked around frantically for someone to notice him but no one cared to. He felt completely at sea. John was dancing cheek-to-cheek with someone who was decidedly not Sherlock Holmes.
They sit there in silence, gazing at each other as the last of the bubbles in the bath crackle and disappear.  This man, John thinks.  This man before him is something else.  Scoffing at emotion and sentiment when he builds such frightening emotional sandcastles around himself.  Only John could watch them fall and not be spooked.  Only John could reassure him and quiet his unspoken fears.
"Oh relax, we've plenty of time," came Sherlock's cheeky reply. "After all, the orchestra can't play without their undercover conductor." And with a flourish, he whisked himself into the sitting room, dressed in a tux complete with brandished conductor's baton.
. But really, for John. When Sherlock put his earbuds in and listened to it, really listened, he could hear every nuance of the song, every quiver of the string, the weeping of the notes. He might as well have written notes of his own blood on staff paper made of his own skin. The waltz was a part of him and as such, it had to be perfect. So he recorded himself so he could concentrate on the sound unfettered to be sure of its perfection.
They layed there for a while, spooned against each other, Sherlock feeling John's galloping heart come to a canter against his back as their breathing slowed.  After a minute or two, John began to mouth gently at Sherlock's shoulder, and said, "Shit.  I'm knackered."
"I love it," he growled, tackling Sherlock, who yelped.  John nuzzled against Sherlock's mouth, a bit dominant and forceful.  "Did you decide to go and get yourself ready for me?  Decided to go and get yourself fixed up like a proper whore?" he asked in between hot, forceful kisses.
Sherlock steeled himself and played Waltz for John and Mary for the newlyweds, his face grim and blank. He wished he could say that being able to see the look on John's face was worth it, but he really couldn't.
John waits for the complete thought, but Sherlock refuses to continue.  He seems to have run out of steam.  He leans against the side of the tub, resting his head in his hands, running pale fingers through unruly dark hair.  John wants to wrap him up tight in his arms; Sherlock is nothing if not an intense person, and seeing him in a mood can be truly disturbing.
It wasn't their first Christmas together, but it was one of their most memorable ones, their bodies and breaths and thoughts entwined as they watched the fire burn down.
"Ahh," came the pompous disembodied voice through the receiver. "So he asked you to be his best man, did he?"
"Um. Hi." John's voice was soft, but it managed to cut through Sherlock's thoughts all the same. He looked up and smiled.
"Nah," Sherlock said with a dismissive flip of his hand.  "Parents didn't have time to notice anything.  I'm sure Mycroft did, but he never said anything."
him, to examine him closely as though he were smeared across a glass slide, to lay on top of him and fuse to him the way a skin graft fuses on an injured limb, to slide in and around him the way the elemental bathwater had filled in and around his body.   To have John...
They got the trousers off and Sherlock managed to shimmy his way out of his pants as well.  John tried to avert his gaze and handed the man one of his silk dressing gowns.  John had experienced much nudity in the military of course, but with Sherlock it was somehow different.  He was cleaner, more innocent.  He made John feel guilty.
Sherlock is proficient at hiding his emotions; he wasn't born that way, he's learned it over countless years of emotional distancing and alienation.  Control over himself is something he prizes perhaps above anything, and it actually caused some friction early on in their relationship.  His inability to open up triggered some insecurity in John until Sherlock learned (very slowly) that he could trust John with his stickier, hatefully human side, and slowly let his guard down.  But he never let it down all the way, not really; there was always a thin wall left standing between the two of them to the point that John never knew precisely what Sherlock was feeling at any given moment unless Sherlock made the decision to expressly tell him.  Until now.  Sherlock knows he is being read like an open book, and it's terrifyingly new, being on the other side.  He feels peeled open, metaphorically bent prostrate before John, and he can't tell if he feels more mortified or freed.
“Really? What about you?” John hovered by the door. He was usually the one to take care of all the arrangements so he found Sherlock’s solicitude unusual.
Oh, this bit is so meta. We can almost hear the higher powers, all the critics and all the experts, speaking through that fortune. “It’s all been done before”, this formula has been done and repeated, this will be nothing new. John, our author, begs to differ.
Harry, until that moment distracted by the frozen willow branches, approached the lake to stare at the dancing snow woman. Noticing the reindeer’s interest, Mrs Hudson slid elegantly towards her and put a tender hand on her probing snout.
The boy’s boat kept swinging about as it approached the enemy’s once again. “We will bring justice-” the boat gave a sudden lurch and Redbeard toppled over the edge.
Mycroft grumbled and turned away from his sibling’s voice. He hid his face in his down pillow and sighed deeply. Everything was warm and comfortable. Perfect.
She was cut off by a loud thud - books thrown to the ground, Sherlock deduced. He suddenly realised that the conversation wasn't about him, anymore.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as the pieces fell into place in his head. “I imagine that it would be terribly convenient for some if the Ambassador would suddenly…”
“Come on, then!” the prince urged her. Not giving her time to answer, Sherlock sprinted out the door and into the hallway.
The prince took a step back, feeling as if he had been slapped in the face. He reminded himself to stay calm, but Mycroft’s cold dismissal had opened old wounds and now his resentment was pouring out in an unstoppable wave.
Sherlock turned to address that comment when he suddenly noticed the room tilting sideways. The man’s large hands grabbed the prince's shoulders just before his knees gave way, keeping him upright just by the sheer strength of their grip.
Sherlock's head snapped up in alarm. It took him longer than he would like to come up with a retort. "I have no idea what you are talking about. I've merely-"
He took his hand away and strands of blue light left Sherlock’s forehead, gathering in the troll’s open palm. He pushed his hand upwards and the light sprang up in the air, forming an image of the two brothers as they were playing in the snowy ballroom, just an hour before.
She was dressed in a plain brown dress and her graying red hair was pulled back in an impeccable bun. Despite her usual steely appearance, Sherlock noticed some new lines around her lips and dark shadows under her eyes. Maybe she was feeling sick as well…
“Never… But not for lack of trying.” he said, resting his elbows on his bent knees. “The guards are always expecting me whenever I try to get out. It’s like they know what I'm going to do…” Sherlock would not admit it to his new-found acquaintance, but he had the nagging suspicion Mycroft was watching him, somehow, and that he kept tipping off the guards whenever he devised an escape plan.
The prince gave him his most winning smile. Now he was asking the right questions. “We just follow the wind. As long as we got a wet finger, we’ll be fine. And I bet Mycroft’s fat arse will keep him from climbing too high up the mountains.”
The Queen answered in kind. “That’s right, before we got married. Us!” she yelled. There was a moment of silence before she continued in a more subdued tone, “I thought you were done, you gave me your word. And there I was, pregnant with your first-born and you still fell into bed with him!”
Feeling that Sherlock was well on his way towards a temper-tantrum, Mycroft conceded his point. “Alright, alright!” He brought his hands together and held them in front of him. As he spread his hands, white swirls cascaded from between them onto the snowy floor. Slowly a little fishing boat started to come into shape, made entirely out of compacted snow. It didn’t have oars or a sail, but Mycroft assumed Sherlock wouldn’t look too closely at that.
A more patient man would have walked all the way to the edge and carefully lowered the rope towards the victim, but Sherlock had no time to waste. After giving it a couple of experimental tugs, he swung the pickaxe over his head and threw it as far as he could. He watched expectantly as it flew gracefully into the air and disappeared into the gorge.
The prince signaled his friend to follow him and they quickly made their way towards the Western Wing, where they would have the best view of the garden. They had reached the area over his own bedroom when Sherlock held out his hand and dropped to a crouch. Jim followed his lead and together they peered over the edge of the roof, just a few seconds before two dark figures became visible under the dimly lit archway on the opposite side of the garden.
“I’m glad no one saw that,” John mumbled, his eyes stubbornly fixed ahead even when the breathless, snow-drenched prince finally caught up with him.
He gave the umbrella an experimental twirl and smiled as he clutched its reassuring weight in his hand. Finally feeling like himself, Mycroft marched forward towards the hall’s magnificent balcony, ready to greet the first day of the rest of his life. He was the Ice Man, and this was his true kingdom.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and waived one finger in a circle. A new snowman materialized inside the boat, but this time it looked closer to a cylinder with a pirate hat than a human shaped form.
Safely on the roof, Sherlock rolled onto his back to regain his breath. A giggle bubbled from his throat before he could help it. He suddenly imagined his mother’s face, looking up from the courtyard at the Palace's front and seeing footprints on the walls. That would get him grounded for a week, at least!
At the floor level, Mycroft kept the wave moving about with his left hand, while he produced another boat with his right hand. He took that boat up to Sherlock’s level using another snowy wave.
“Because he’s going to be a little older, and he’ll need to really start learning how to be king, when the time comes.”
Suddenly, Sherlock heard a loud rattle coming from inside his Mind Palace. Closing his eyes, he quickly searched for the source of the sound and found himself standing in the dark, dust-covered halls of the East Wing. He was facing a long wall of closed doors with rotting wood and rusty locks. The door in front of him was shaking in its frame, shedding spider webs and flecks of paint with every motion. He reached forward to open the door, and it rattled harder and harder at his approach.
“The only one mad enough to be out in this weather is you, young man...” Angelo answered kindly, relieved to see the prince becoming more responsive. At that moment, the front door creaked open and Sherlock felt a blast of cold on his back before the door was closed again.
He climbed carefully down the windowsill and backed away from the moonlight that shone through the windowpanes. The cold wouldn’t touch him again… He wouldn’t let it.
Sherlock’s heart began to hammer in his chest as he turned towards Jim, who answered with raised eyebrows and clear eyes. With a wordless agreement, they made their way down the roof in search of the two arguing men. Since Sherlock was the one familiar with the surroundings, he naturally took the lead, maneuvering between rooftops and balconies with graceful ease. He had only to turn his head to see Jim’s dark form behind him, managing the obstacles with the same quiet efficiency as him.
In retrospect that may have been a bit too much, as his brother returned the gesture with a raised eyebrow and a curious smirk.
It’s a fairly long post describing the whole case. My intention isn’t to go into the whole description of the case but to point out some details I find relevant to understanding John’s mindset and to gain some added perspective to the overarching story.
They formed groups to score the lake and begin splitting the ice. Some drove the horses as they pulled menacing ice plows, others worked with ice picks, chisels and saws. John ran after them with his own ice chisel, Harry hot on his heels.
Sherlock furrowed his brow at the guard. “Aren’t you supposed to defend the Law and Order or some such? I thought that was what guards were for...”
Behind Lestrade, Anderson scoffed loudly despite Donovan’s warning slap on his arm. "Oh please, they’ve planned all of this together. I bet he has magical powers too!"
John had risen dutifully at the break of dawn to prepare Harry and his sledge for their journey. The storm had died down around daybreak and it wasn’t long before they were on their way, leaving the thick, snow-covered forest and whizzing along the winding path that took them up the slopes of the Londondalle mountain range.
are posted on the same day. Looking at what John wrote and the timestamps on the comments, I would say that John posted both entries on the afternoon of the 23rd of March, after they found the body of Eddie Van Coon.
"We’re working. We’re ice harvesters." John said, puffing out his chest. When that didn't elicit any answer from the troll, he continued, "We, huh, cut ice from the lake and…"
John ends the post up at the end of the episode, again not mentioning their encounter with Mycroft but deciding to mention the name of Sherlock’s mysterious arch-enemy. And again he compares Sherlock to a child… John, you know I love you, but please stop doing that.
“I’m sorry, Mummy!” Mycroft repeated, his desperation growing by the minute. His mother motioned to take Sherlock from his grasp, her light blue eyes not meeting Mycroft's pleading gaze.
He continues to describe the case and, as a sensible person, completely erases Mycroft from the narrative. What is not so sensible is that John puts himself in the scene of Hope’s murder. I don’t know about you, but if I were John I would just say “I drove after Sherlock and when I arrived the police was already there. The taxi driver had been shot!”. John, on the other hand, writes:
As much as he relished The Work, Sherlock began to dread those idle moments between a solved case and a new one. With every hour that the Captain failed to provide him with a new cold case, the high of success faded away and the ever encroaching boredom took its place. In those moments, he heard the siren call of the powder, enticing him with promises of warmth and comfort. Those calls had been growing stronger lately, as the Captain had been struggling to bring him more unsolved cases. The well was drying, Sherlock had realized with a jolt of dread, when he was handed an eighty-year-old case with little more than a few fading reports and descriptions of long lost evidence.
“Don’t give me that “digestion slows me down” nonsense,” he had said between mouthfuls, “We both know this case will be a no-brainer.”
As soon as he got his breath back, Sherlock stood up on the roof and smiled. From there he could see all of the town, with its smoking chimneys and mismatched roofs, sprawling from the docks to the edge of the forest. There were people, moving, working, living, on every street, taking their boats to the open sea and their cattle out to pasture.
The growing sound of marching boots took Sherlock’s attention from the mirror to his window. Looking down he could see the Palace Guards slowly pouring into the courtyard in preparation to open the Palace’s gates. Even though he couldn’t see beyond the walls, Sherlock could make out the faint noise of the crowd gathering outside, laughing and singing, ready to step through the long closed gates and cheer for their future king.
that says that Sherlock is purposefully winding up John and cutting him off from cases to get him frustrated enough to make some sort of move. He is making the adrenaline junkie go through a dry spell after giving him a taste on excitement on ASIB. He eventually aquiesces to taking John to see Sebastian, probably because he wants to show Seb that he has a
Mycroft moved his left hand in a circle over his head and Sherlock's wave took another lap of the room.
"A troll, yes. Nice to meet you, I’m Ella," she held out a large hand "Come one, be polite. What’s your name?"
This entry is posted the day after the newly minted duo finishes their first case. John is excited to
“You are holding the case file of the Powers murder investigation,” Mycroft explained in a gentler tone.
Nervous energy sang through Sherlock’s limbs and he grabbed at the windowsill in irritation. If only he wasn’t stuck inside the Palace, if only he could open the gates and run into the town square, he would help the boy win the fight. They’d return everything the pickpocket had stolen and the people would-
“There you are, Blackbeard!” Sherlock proclaimed, pointing his dull sword at the empty boat. “Prepare to fight!”
The boy flinched and hid by his side. The icy mist continued to pour from his hands, but it disappeared as soon as it touched the ground.
“I was seventeen when I fell into the lake,” Paul explained with a toothless smile “Couldn’t make it home in time before the frost took my ears.”
He remembered the Grand Stamford telling him how his magic would become foul, how the icy swirls would turn into spikes that pierced those around him, if given the chance. So now he threw his hands left and right, letting the magic flow freely from his fingers and ricochet against the snow, daring it to turn sharp and menacing. But, to Mycroft's surprise, only snowflakes erupted from his fingers, forming intricate spirals that disappeared in the wind. For the first time since that night, he could see beauty in his powers.
“I just said that -” he managed to argue before John cut Harry’s harness and the reindeer was jumping over the gap.
From his vantage point he could see how the narrow path opened into a small clearing, surrounded by a wall of dark stone. The ground was covered by a thick mantle of deep green moss interspaced by cracks that spewed a steady flow of steam into the air.
Sherlock walked slowly to the middle of the darkened ballroom, his wide eyes taking everything around him. The room was familiar to him, but in the darkness of the night, mundane objects gained an otherworldly quality. The modest thrones on the wooden stage became looming figures, the draped curtains became magical trees, the pale blue pillars of moonlight that came through the high windows were ruins of an ancient temple.
The guard took a step back and eyed the prince with disbelief. He swallowed visibly before grumbling through his clenched jaw.  “I’ll pass on the information...” he said, and turned back towards his post.
The following days brought a procession of solemn faced soldiers to the Palace, each bearing pieces of splintered wood and ripped burgundy canvas for Mycroft’s inspection. On the fourth day, two soldiers brought the water-logged trunk of the Andromeda’s first mate, found on the shores of the southernmost village in the Kingdom. Mycroft issued an official statement declaring the King and Queen to have been lost at sea and made arrangements for the funeral ceremonies to be performed without the bodies. After all the papers were signed, he retired to his room and there he remained, no matter how much Sherlock banged on the door and demanded, argued and, at one time, begged, for him to come out.
That last detail seemed to convince John. “Ok, don’t forget to book us a place to stay. I’m not sleeping in some moldy old castle.” he called out, already climbing the steps to his room.
Mycroft smiled at his brother’s eagerness. He took a step backwards and pushed back his sleeves, like a magician performing for a rapt audience. Technically, he didn’t need to close his eyes or wiggle his fingers, but he did so anyway. Sherlock squealed with delight.
Sherlock let himself lie on the bed for a few more seconds before trailing after his parents, already walking down the main stairway. Mycroft was waiting at the foot of the stairs, with a perfect posture and a sombre face.
There was utter silence as Harry flew over the abyss. Sherlock closed his eyes and hid his face on the reindeer’s neck in preparation for the inevitable impact. The moment seemed to stretch forever as they fell, and Sherlock spared a thought for Jim - wondering if he would ever be able to find his mangled body and discern his remains from those of the reindeer. Unless he decided to add a bit of both bodies to the urn. His skeleton would look impressive in reindeer antlers...
The prince had been quietly contemplating the crackling fire when a mug of hot cocoa was shoved into his hands. He grabbed the offering as best he could before looking up to find Angelo smiling happily at him.
“Yes, that’s right,” she agreed, “but Mycroft is turning ten years-old, and that’s a very important thing.”
This episode spans a total of 5 days (March 23rd to 27th). Today we will look at the first two entries.
Looking across his imagined audience, the prince noticed an antique display cabinet filled with skulls from different animals, a collection left by his quirky grandmother. On the topmost shelf stood a lonely human skull, gazing back at him with hollow eyes. Sherlock grinned at the skull in return. There was his partner!
He released a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding when, one by one, the men on the staircase began to move. Slowly, they stood up, stunned but unharmed.
- My fictional nation of Gaulia is based on the name Gaul (Gallia in Latin), a large area of Western Europe during the Iron Age that includes the modern French territory, between others. Since Lestrade is a french surname, I thought that it was a perfect excuse to include Greg in the story.
Sherlock cursed inwardly at his own awkwardness. He had had no intention of making his new friend feel inadequate. “No, it’s alright. I have a strange sense of humour myself,” he tried to explain.
A week after the King and Queen’s departure, Sherlock was summoned to his father’s office. There he found his brother in the company of the Captain of the Royal Guard and a man he didn’t know. A terrible feeling of dread filled his chest when he scanned their faces.
"We like working! And Mr Murray needs our help," John argued. He couldn't really explain why, but he felt it was important to reassure the troll of their well-being. "We are learning how to harvest the ice from the lake. We're going to be the best harvesters in all the Kingdom!"
The snow proved to be too deep, however, and after straining to move only a few feet, John yelled at Harry to stop. “This is useless," he told her between heavy breaths, "We need to find a place to wait this out.”
It those other moments where the same tilting effect is used, there are no props sliding. This instance is unique because of this.
His eyes sparkled with a glint of mischievousness that Sherlock wholeheartedly approved of. “You can call me Jim. Hi!” he added in a sing-song voice.
In a few disjointed steps, Sherlock climbed up the narrow windowsill, pushing down the several porcelain vases that adorned it. They fell and shattered on the floor with an hilarious popping noise. Sherlock giggled as he looked down at the mess on the carpet. Even the grandfather clock laughed rhythmically from down the hall.
Turning his attention back to his glowing hands, Sherlock decided to try and touch them to his face again. To his delight, they no longer burned his skin but caressed it with warm waves of pure energy. The prince brought his hands lower to tenderly hold his aching neck and shoulders. The waves permeated his tense muscles and slowly chased away the cold weight in his chest, coiling around his bones like heavy, sun warmed boas.
There was only one thing to do, Sherlock realized. He sat down on the driver’s seat and clutched the reins in both hands, heart lodged in his throat. “Get ready to jump, Harry!” he cried.
In an Inception-like manner, the months that follow fit inside those seconds of consciousness he has left. Although his hold on logic is fragile and his hand-made scenarios are not exactly perfect (themes are reused, objects chance places and shape, people act strangely, logical threads sometimes lead nowhere) he does his best to anticipate what is going to happen. Time is running out, and so is his mind. Remember, he doesn’t have all the data, sentiment may be clouding his judgment, but he will try.
Down in the main hall, Sherlock had no such internal debate. He had long ago decided what he wanted and what his plan was - and he had only one day to put it into action. His heart was racing as he climbed down the front steps into the courtyard. He could see a pair of guards marching towards the gate, awaiting their orders.
Sherlock kneeled on the roof, trying to peer through the window, but the angle was too steep to see. He was keenly aware that his wasn’t a conversation for his ears, but his curiosity was stronger than his sense of decorum. Besides, if he was being punished, he should be the first to know.
Confused by his brother’s dispassionate attitude, Sherlock picked up the envelope from the bed and stared dumbly at it, frowning against the fog in his mind. “Why? What's this?” he asked, weighing it in his hands.
was the same that had him disappear into the night a month ago, leaving his son in the care of the ice harvesters.
Suddenly, a crow flew from a nearby tree, dislodging the snow that covered its thin branches. It plopped wetly in front of Sherlock's mare, startling the animal, unused as she was to the sounds of the forest. The mare whinnied and buckled while the prince did his best to regain control of his mount, but his limited riding skills couldn’t keep him from being thrown off the saddle and face first in the snow.
The prince was contemplating the calm waving of the moored ships down at the docks when a loud banging noise cut the stillness of the night, followed by the the sound of voices (
Sherlock drew a long breath as his shoulders relaxed. As happy as he was that the pickpocket had been caught, the outcome had been decidedly anti-climatic. He wished the boy would at least be allowed to take the thief to prison...  The boy didn’t look very happy with the outcome, either. He patted the reindeer’s head and mounted it quietly. They made their way through the crowded streets and disappeared from Sherlock’s view. The people in the streets continued on with their day, already forgetting what that brave boy had just done.
As you can read in my previous post, John posts 4 entries relative to TBB (March 23rd to 28th). This time we’ll look at the last two.
“I had horrid night terrors when I was little.” Sherlock started up, his voice low and gentle, meant to calm. “My brother had the room next door. When he heard me, he’d go fetch a wet flannel. He wasn’t always terrible, Mycroft I mean. He’d stay up and trace Latin words on my back until I calmed down.” Sherlock said all this with an underlying vulnerability John had yet to hear from the man.
Mycroft’s face melted into something hesitant but hopeful. “No,” he whispered, serious and half silent, private. “I suppose it wouldn’t be.”
“I… I’m no better than that man today. I want to own you.” Sherlock started haltingly, “I want… I want everything you do and say to belong to me. I want every word you speak to be for me alone. I want you to always be looking at me, I want every thought of wonder to be inspired by me. I want… I want every bad memory, every fear, ever horror to be chased away by me and me alone.” Sherlock stopped, John could see his eyes closed tight as he held John closer and closer.
them sometimes. Some nights Moran’s hands gripped his hips, Moran’s weight and heat settled over his body, pressing him down, pressing into him. Moriarity's voice and fingers still grasping his hair, whispering across his skin, wrapping itself around his soul. Some nights he still awoke, afraid, reaching for Sherlock, like a child scared of a thunderstorm.
They fell back asleep wrapped in each other, safe in Baker Street, guarded against the horrors of the outside world by warm arms and warmer hearts.
Something in Sherlock's chest twisted as he pictured another artists hands, dark with melanin, larger, less scarred. Decades younger.
“Thank you.” John murmured as they came to a halt at Sherlock's direction. They held each other tightly as the tune drifted away, clearly unfinished, and all the more beautiful for it.
“Every moment,” Sherlock answered somberly. “Some of it is removed, the pain is worn around the edges, no longer so sharp to touch. But the…” Sherlock froze here, before squeezing John and taking a shuddering breath, “the sexual assault I was subjected to… No matter how I try, it just seems to stitch itself back together, a tapestry of pain and humiliation I can't force away.”
“You gonna tell me your name yet, or do I have to guess?” Greg asked in good humor, leaning against the bars. The boy analyzed him for a minute before rolling his shoulders and standing. Greg was surprised to see how tall the lad was when he wasn’t hunched over or sitting. He easily towered over Greg, and probably many other people.
John flushed and grinned at his husband's delight, “I found some at the market this morning. I thought you’d like it. Have you ever had it?” Sherlock smiled at him fondly, that smile that said he was grateful to John.
“I love you.” John breathed against his cheek, coffee and morning breath, grown out hair tickling Sherlocks temple.
A few minutes later found John laid out on in the living room, warmed by the fire, their chairs shoved to the side. Sherlock was staring at him seriously as he donned a pair of rubber gloves.
“Why haven’t I seen you doing this before?” Sherlock asked, puzzled. John cleared his throat, uncomfortable.
“I mean it. She went right to you, asked for you and everything.” Sherlock was silent for a moment, analyzing him.
John was silent as he removed his hand from the hallucinated chest, going about his business with the rest of the shopping. The shade trailed him as he put up the toilet paper and replaced the empty box of tissues in the sitting room.
“Sh’rl’ck” he croaked groggily, rubbing at his eyes. The sniffling stopped. As John got his eyes opened properly, he furrowed his brow. Sherlock was sat in John’s chair, John’s coat draped over his lap. A cup of tea had gone cold at his elbow.
” in amazement and sitting with weakened knees. He was still sitting there gaping at the pile when John came out in his bathrobe. Sherlock was momentarily distracted by John’s strong calves with a fine smattering of golden hair, not yet gone silver.
) and Mycroft flipped quickly through a color palette book, comparing samples at lightning speed, John just wanted a walk. He wanted a pint, actually, but he’d been trying to cut back. He knew he didn’t drink to excess, just a pint or 3 a week, and he never got drunk, but could anyone blame him for fear of still becoming his father? John bit his lip anxiously and twisted his own engagement ring around and around on his finger. It was a dark gold color and had the chemical formula for love engraved along the inside. Sherlock had it hand made by a man who “
“John?” Sherlock rumbled after a long moment, John felt himself gently coming back down from the haze he had drifted into and humming in acknowledgment. “I know you said you didn’t care for a honeymoon but… I’ve a surprise for you.” John fought to be alert again, finally managing to open his eyes and look up at his husband. (
) John couldn’t possibly picture Sherlock feeling any kind of joy at any person’s pain, especially someone innocent. Crimes with violence towards innocent people, namely children, could easily send Sherlock into a rage. The idea of this stoically calm man, who had a stranglehold on his emotions, finding pleasure in the pain of an innocent person was outlandish.
“A- Afghanistan, how-?” John stuttered, entranced by where his own red string wormed its way into this strange man’s chest, burrowing past his deliciously tailored shirt and into flesh that was probably pale as porcelain. The man smirked playfully, then pulled back, suddenly self-confident to the point of arrogance.
“I know you,” the man said after a long moment of analyzing John, leaning down into his space, seemingly trying to take in every curve, pock mark, and blemish on his face. Memorizing him, tearing him a part. “I know you’re a military doctor just returned home from service, I know you have no close friends to speak of, a brother you disapprove of, a father who drank too much, and…” he trailed off, one hand hesitantly rising, his fingers touching John's face gently. John gasped a little, both jumping and leaning into the touch. A small feather light whisper of finger tips under his eye setting him aflame in the most glorious way, “I know you have eyes like the deepest parts of the ocean, and despite all the wrong choices and my constant doubt of your existence, you stand before me.” He straightened again, flushed, excited, like a puppy trying not to bounce around the feet of its owner.
“Oi!” Greg snapped, both PC’s turned, still shell shocked, “go get back to work, quit standing around, will ya?” Greg glared and crossed his arms. When neither PC moved, he scowled deeper and took a step forward. This seemed to spur the policewoman into action, and she snapped to attention, dragging her coworker away.
Greg) had both had to work and as it was still Christmas break the lad was left home alone. He and Sherlock had a lovely day of dissecting human eyes and analyzing the fibrous tissues. Sherlock filed away the information in case he ever needed it, Harvey just seemed content to squish something icky. Sherlock approved of the boy immensely, though he was baffled each time the lad called him “
Once Sherlock had access to the computer of the ringleader, the whole story just fell together so easily even the police could have handled it.
“Maybe I’d react differently if I didn’t feel exactly the same,” John admitted quietly. After a moment of silence, John expanded, “sometimes, when I’m working on a victim, or fighting, or even when I just say something that spurs god knows what in that amazing mind of yours, god, Sherl. The way you
Sherlock, who was at the desk typing on his laptop, felt his breathing pick up before he forced his body back in line. Heart rate dropped, breathing pattern even, no outward indication he was bothered.
“He’s a great kid, I just don’t think he knows it. He’s gonna help a lot of people, if he can just keep his nose clean.”
“So were you.” Sherlock rumbled lowly, as though they were discussing the weather, though John could see the flush on Sherlock’s cheeks.
Mike Stamford led him into the lab at Bart’s. John kept up the brittle, jagged smile as best he could, his nerves already wearing thin. This wouldn’t work, whatever person Mike knew that was looking for a flatmate wouldn’t want someone like John. Someone broken, crippled, scarred from a war he never wanted to join (
, tonguing and sucking on John’s prick. John felt his breath come heavier and heavier, his body twisting before he cried out in a gasp. Sherlock's name on his lips.
“Yea well, they’re vain gits, aren’t they? All that time spent on their clothes and hair, it’s no wonder they spend so much time on the big day.” Greg shrugged.
“Yes. You seem to have had quiet the influence on my little brother. So, I’ve come to thank you, and ask… ask simply that you keep your promise, once he gets out.” The man shrugged, though there was something vulnerable in his posture. It all clicked for Greg suddenly.
“Greg,” he breathed, moving to take a step closer to the man. Greg instantly clutched the politician’s shoulders.
As he shakily made his way downstairs, he was surprised by the sound of clicking china and boiling water. He furrowed his brow as he rounded into their living room. Sherlock cast an assessing look in his direction before swirling about the kitchen, flaring dressing gown in his wake. A moment later Sherlock whirled back into the living room, setting the tea tray on a table between his chair and John’s. Sherlock eyed him silently, then set about making a cuppa.
The next day found them peacefully wondering a small marketplace. John had never smelt so many foods, nor seen so many different people all in one place. The air tingled with joy, the sound of a thousand languages rolling over John in waves.
With Sherlock's mouth on his cock and Sherlock’s fingers inside him, John found himself on the brink, the effort of keeping his hands and hips still only turning him on more. The idea of pleasing Sherlock with his obedience almost sending him over the edge.
John loved him already and with a breathless chuckle he nodded as the man shot him a secretive grin and winked, whisking out the door and muttering about a riding crop. John looked to Mike expectantly, who just stared at him dumbstruck.
“Yea,” John whispered roughly, “I’m yours. Only yours, a separation from you wouldn’t just break me, love. It’d destroy me. There’d be
“What about memories?” John asked through his tears. He'd had a nightmare, spurned by their last case. A young girl had come to them, telling them she remembered being raped as a young child but had no resources to find the man. The culprit, a handsome man who now had a barely legal sugar baby, a large home, and a six-figure job, turned out to have been the older brother of the girl's childhood babysitter.
“I don’t care.” John snapped as he began to slam things around while putting the shopping up. The soldier blinked and Sherlock was in front of him, between himself and the icebox. John’s hand was straight through Sherlock’s chest.
As they spun to enter the alleyway again and lead the police into the catacombs John swore he caught Sherlock snarl something that sounded like “
“And this one,” Sherlock whispered in awe, drawing John back to him. The detective pressed on Johns gunshot wound, his voice breathy when he spoke. “This scar I
“It’s your birthday, wherever you’re most comfortable and can see best.” John shrugged. Sherlock cast his eyes about the room, before turning slightly and eyeing the living room.
“I’m fine,” John replied, far too quickly. Mycroft shot him an exasperated look at the obvious lie and Sherlock lifted one eyebrow as if to say, “
“Cool.” She said, almost in awe, allowing John and Sherlock to hug her for a moment longer before squirming out of their hold and excitedly running about her new room.
“I was a bloody captain,” John growled, relaxing further into the bed, his feathers still ruffled, but intrigued by Sherlock’s unraveling of his past.
As they passed two or three stands of honey sellers in a row, Sherlock's eyes lit up. His hand slipped from John’s and John allowed it with an indulgent smile. As Sherlock seriously conversed with one of the beekeepers in a rapid language that surely wasn’t French, Johns' eyes drifted. They lit up as they landed on a stack of small squares at the next stall over.
“Now.” Sherlock hissed, his eyes closing tight in pleasure as his pace picked up, every thrust rubbing against Johns’ prick perfectly, “god John,
“Very well then,” Sherlock cut in, “If you can’t speak verbally, will you answer with nods?” the girl nodded readily. John’s eyebrows rose and he looked at Sherlock who looked rather relieved but was still analyzing her tensely.
Perhaps if I had… If I had held you like the day that grandfather died, perhaps if I had loved you more you wouldn’t have torn yourself apart. I’m sorry for that, brother,
The cab ride home was awkward, the girl sat stoically between John and Sherlock, silent as the grave. John was honestly a little uneasy with the lack of noise. They stopped at the shops to fetch the girl a few necessities, toothbrush, comb, a pair of pajamas, when John asked if she needed pullups at night, she just silently shook her head. John was unsure if she even knew what pullups were.
The man pressed the phone into John's hand, the warmth of his long fingers sending a shock wave through John.
The girl, now carefully clutching her cooled half-filled mug of tea, squirmed back into the couch for a moment before going still. She delicately began to sip and John had the thought that, tomorrow, after he had slept at least eight hours, they would need to get a name out of the girl, or else pick one for her. After a long moment of Sherlock seeming to wrack his brain, his deep voice began to tale of
John shot up from his bed, gasping in ragged breaths and letting out little sobs. He whimpered as he curled in on himself. The bed felt too soft, the air too cool, the window… well, there
” all those months before. Trying to convince himself and John this was real, this was something they were capable of and above all, deserving of.
Then someone called his name. Frustrated, but unwilling to be rude, he turned to see a portly man with small eyes. The string pointed straight at him, and not for the first time, John realized once the man said his name.
“You.” The detective breathed out. It was lower than a mumble, a sound so low it was felt and not heard. Shy, uncertain, laced with shame.
. You make me feel like I’m… like I’m perfect. Just perfection incarnate. I’m 10ft tall and the picture of masculinity in your eyes. And somedays I want to keep it. I want to bottle those moments, every time your eyes turn away, I want to force them back to me. I know what you’re feeling. I don’t fault you for it. Maybe it’s not the healthiest, but it’s understandable. It’s
at me. It’s arousal and amazement and wonder. As if I’m something precious, something treasured, something… something
Greg complied anyway. He stayed close by as the lad punched in a number and waited for the ringing to stop. There was silence on both ends, nothing was said. Finally, the boy sighed in frustrated defeat.
, I would lay myself at an alter to this scar and everything it signifies. Without this, we’d have never met, you’d have never been put in my path. Where would we have been, had you been left to your own accords? You’d have stayed in the army until you found yourself unable to hold a gun, and probably past that. You’d have never come home at all, would you? And we’d have never met, you’d have never put me back together. You know that, right John? You know you took all my broken pieces and made something of the nothing I was before you, you know that, don’t you, my love?” Sherlock was crying now; John could feel the tears hitting his skin where Sherlock was half laying over him.
You can sense John’s excitement as he describes the case. He is settling in into his role as a blogger and he is a bit proud of his work.
John had received his gift with tears in his eyes and a promise to take the absolute best care of it.
John tried to swallow down the knot in his throat. "Thank you, but we can’t. We have to work really early in the morning…"
Not far from where he stood, over the top of the trees, rose a steady plume of smoke against the metal gray sky. Sherlock's heart beat wildly in his cold chest as the prince made a renewed effort towards the source of the smoke. Slowly, he was able to waddle through the storm until a small wooden lodge was visible between the trees. The fluttering yellow light that filtered through the windows beckoned the freezing prince forwards until he found himself at the foot of the wooden steps, without much recollection of how he crossed those final yards.
“I 'ave a new batch for you. Some prime stuff.” He kneeled and dug his hand deep in the grimy bag at his feet, searching inside.
Mycroft inspected his cuffs in a poor attempt to hide his self-satisfied smile. “Oh, haven't I mentioned it? I am to be crowned king in front of all Londondalle society, as well as several heads of state and foreign dignitaries.”
With no warning, the snow woman walked briskly onto the frozen lake and turned to the men like a performer facing her audience. Smiling at their confused faces, she swayed from side to side before breaking into a happy little song.
