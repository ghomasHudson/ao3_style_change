"Yeah no that sucks, what else?"
Cas grinned and it made Dean's whole body fill with joy.
Dean laughed " oh well I think I've learned my lesson" he raised his head closing their distance. Fear and doubt found their way back to his mind, he looked at cas for a moment then closed his eyes.
"Myself" dean clearly means it and cas can understand.
He remembers the new name he chose for himself "castiel" and the unknown town he's in now, going for a walk at the beach, the diner, was that real or something his mind made up to mess with him? That guy was way too good to be real. He remembers the park and the dog, that damn dog and oh a car. He was in a car accident.
"That would be hokers" crwoly cuts him off
I don't know how I ever lived before
Dean scoffed "thanks, but you don't know me enough to say that."
"No it's fine thank you"
He follows dean and Claire to the parking lot, they stop in front of a big black beautiful car
"Yes sam, it's me" he sounded like cas, dean thought "Jack brought me back I-" he was cut off by sam throwing himself into his arms, he hugged him back with a soft smile.
No half of my family is trying kill me, the other half told me run and never look back.
He sat down to eat with them and talk about how the hunt went. The smile on Eileen's face when he signed a few of the new words he learned from a youtube video was precious and sam looked proud.
Cas stood there, unsure.
Sam cleared his throat and took Eileen's hand, he pat cas's shoulder before they left the kitchen.
What's the point of watching a movie if sam isn't there to make fun of him, jack isn't there to mimic the way characters talk and cas...
"You're awake!!" a familiar deep voice says. Cas tries to focus his vision on the source, it's the same ridiculously green eyes again. Is he hallucinating?
"No they hated him because they were from the other gang"
"What if I never let go?" Dean thought to himself "who's gonna make me let go?" He was sure he would kill anything or anyone who tried taking the angel away from him again.
They made their way to Dean's room. It was a mess but cas didn't mind.they looked awkwardly at eachother for a while when dean said "I should probably brush my teeth" and ran out of the room.
"You're saying this is the town for romantics and criminals?
Jerry smiles and taks dee's hands in his own "happy anniversary darling"
There's obviously an story there and it's obviously not his place to ask, not that he cares ofcource. Maybe just a bit curious.
The last job that went very wrong, the fight with Micheal, nick and meg being after him and running away. For the first time in his entire life he had to run, leaving his family and everything he worked so hard for behind. It's all ruined.
Dean ponders for a moment then grabs a bottle of bourbon from the shelves and pours him a glass, an arguably safe choice but not wrong.
"We danced for hours, this was the last song."
"Thank you Claire, lucky for both of us I'm completely fine. I'm sure you'll drive very carefully in the future just stay away from dogs."
"Umm...let's take a different approach, what do you do for fun?"
"I'm sorry I was too afraid. I was afraid and I lost my chance and now you're-" a quite sob broke the sentence and he realized he was crying "and now you're gone"
So what else was on his list for today? Or maybe he could go look for a job... nope no jobs God dammit he's supposed to be relaxing after thirty five years of being generally tense SPECIALLY the last few months. Even if juts to prove to himself that he is in fact capable of doing so.
"No I'm not gonn let you sit on that chair the whole night. It's really uncomfortable."
That doesn't make sense "how would the sheriff know?"
"Hmm...is that what you came here to do? Make love to the sound of waves and watch the sunset?" Should he be saying that? He doesn't know how gay friendly this supposed paradise is and dean seems to be very popular. Cas may not remember much from high-school but he remembers popular people were almost always dicks.
Cas considered for a moment "I believe you said because you were an idiot"
"I forgot to ask is there anyone you'd want us to call? You're probably gonna be stuck here for a while"
Chuck and billy are dealt with, hell is doing well with rowena in charge and jack seems to be doing alright in heaven.
"How's that going?" He hosnet to God wants to know
Dean pours him another drink "so whatcha running from?"
"But we're in a diner, there are people We'll bother them."
"Come on Winchester" he tried pep talking himself "you're too old for this shit. It's about damn time you took responsibility for who you are and how you feel."
He thinks about what he's seen so far "I find that hard to belive, people here seem so..." he doesn't know how to finish that without sounding like a big city trash.
Dean snuck a peek at him and smiled when he saw that Cas was watching a bee on one of the flower pots by the edge of the patio.  Cas looked comfortable in his space and Dean liked it that way.
Cas only hummed and continued to stroke him gently and kiss him along his neck and jaw.  Dean was thrashing under him, wanting more but enjoying the feeling of Cas’ hands and mouth all over him.  Dean’s hands flexed and pulled on Cas’ ass, trying to get him to thrust against him, but Cas held back.
Cas chuckled and threaded Dean’s arm through his.  They continued to walk at a leisurely pace through the downtown area and they joined the many other people who had the same thoughts about enjoying the weather that they did.
Dean frowned at that.  “So, you think they will move, or will you?”  He was careful to phrase it properly this time.
“Thanks, Charlie.  I owe you,” Dean tells her, relieved.  She laughs before replying.
By midafternoon they had gotten something out from Novak Networks, along with a nice picture of Cas and Dean that Charlie had been able to photograph with her phone.  Dean had put on a nice outfit that Cas bought for him and Cas had dressed up a little too.  They looked like a happily mated couple, Dean’s bite prominently displayed on his neck.
And that beauty was on in the inside, too.  He was always working in the castle, helping out wherever he could.  Dean still wasn’t sure what was going on, but he knew that Cas seemed happy.  He had shadowed Dean’s mother and was in a role not unlike Dean’s with his father.  It made Dean swell with pride that his friend was valued.
“Ha!  Well, I am a lawyer, Dean.”
“He’s moving more,” Cas told her as soon as she opened the door.  “He’s moved his legs and his hands.”
“Well, Castiel.  You said that this visit wasn’t for you, but needed privacy.  I have to say, my curiosity is burning.”
Cas told him about Lilith coming to find him to get the root and about the sick child.  He recounted the feeling of being watched and how he saw Lilith stab Garth.
“Hey Dean, thanks for getting me,” Sam said as he pulled the door to the old Toyota shut.
“Anyone want dessert?” she asked.  “Dean, honey, you want a slice of pie?  I’ve got cherry today.”
“About what?” he asked.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Alright, bitch, we’ll go then,” Dean said brusquely.  He softened his tone.  “Thanks though.”
Laid out between the two women was his pup.  They had dressed her and put a bow in her hair and she was currently on a soft blanket sucking on her fist.  “Hey sweet thing,” Dean said.  His voice was soft but she immediately turned her head.  “Did you have a good time with Auntie Jo and Auntie Charlie?”  Dean pulled off his suit jacket and threw it and the tie over the back of the table chair.  He rolled his sleeves up and leaned on the back of the couch.  “Was she any trouble?”
“You move fast, Sammy,” Dean commented.  Sam shrugged.
A few days later Dean said something to Cas that made him pause.
Dean felt lightheaded with exhaustion and his hole was tender when Jimmy entered him.  It was hard and fast and dirty and Dean was screaming in pleasure through the whole thing.  Dean came when Jimmy locked into him and they collapsed together on their sides.
“Why?”
“You’re comfortable there already and I think it would be better than your room,” he agreed.
“Did something happen with Jimmy tonight?” he asked carefully.
“How are you feeling?” Cas asked him.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean securely and leaned them back further into the cushions.  “It makes me feel better when we are equal partners in our relationship.  You want me to hold you up and fuck you against the wall, I’m happy to do so, just make sure it’s what you want and not offer it because it’s something you think I want or need, ok?”
?” she continued, eyes flashing.
When Cas left the hospital, he felt uneasy.  He had seen the vacant look in Dean’s eyes and it frightened him.  He didn’t want to admit that he was scared, but he was.  He sat in his car with his head on the steering wheel while he sifted through the events of the night.
Dean hadn’t really considered the fact that he would be making a salary in addition to gaining a home.  He smiled at the thought of making his own money and what he could do with it.  More books would be first on the list but he wasn’t sure how much time he would actually have to read from now on.
“Oh, um…”  Dean faltered.  He started panicking and the alpha frowned at him.
He hadn’t had a heat since January.   He was due for one in April.  He had been pretty regular on the three-month cycle that was typical of omegas.  If he had had one in April, he would have been due for another in July.  His body wasn’t ready then, obviously, but what did that mean for now?
And he and the nurse exited, pulling the curtain closed once more.
The hospital was ready to release him and he was going home.  Dean felt empty.  What was he going home to?  Would Cas come in person to break up with him or would the Alphas take care of it?  What would Dean do?  Would his father keep him to the house?  Would he have to move out of the manor house?  Finishing his degree was certainly not going to happen.  His dad had only agreed because it would help with a good mating.
Cas was outside of Dean’s building at six fifty Monday night.  He wanted to make sure he caught Dean because he couldn’t find a place to park on the street.  When he saw Dean exit the building with some friends he smiled.  Dean caught sight of him and waved.  He ran to him and threw himself into his arms.
“Mom and Cas have all the chambers ready and Ellen has delegated several cooks to move to the camp to help with meals out in the field,” Sam added.
Dean watched her scent the air, checking Cas’ scent.  She seemed satisfied with what she saw and scented.  Dean took a deep breath too, checking for himself.  Cas’ scent was still the same.
“I know you don’t, Dean, but I want to give them to you.”  Cas squeezed his arms gently.  “I know that you don’t need me to buy you things, Dean.  I know that you want other things.  We’ve talked about the food and spending time together.  But I also like to spoil you with things that are nice, that I know you like and that you haven’t had a lot of in your life.  Even though I didn’t buy you the gifts before, I do want you to have them.  We can both have what we want for each other, right?”
Cas growled.  “Charlie!”
Cas was becoming desperate at the lack of reaction from his mate.  Dean sat there, confused and withdrawn.  He was unreactive and it scared Cas more than he wanted to admit.
“Don’t be afraid to growl at me, Castiel, I can take it.  I know it’s not directed at me.”
“I’m going to pay it,” he told Dean quietly.  Dean balked and shifted to face him in his chair.
They filed up and Dean found himself between Amelia and Cas.  He gave Amelia a small smile and she returned it.
“Sit down, Sam,” he commanded.
“Someone’s at the door,” Dean called into the den.  Cas had already gotten up and was walking into the kitchen and Jimmy wasn’t far behind him.
“Thank you, alpha,” Cas replied.  “You look handsome as well,” he said returning the compliment.  Cas fingered the embroidery on the collar of the tunic, feeling the fine stiching and the softness of the fabric.
“Alright, let me have it,” he sighed looking her in the eye.
“Likewise, Castiel.  Thank you for seeing me on short notice,” Crowley replied.
“Dean has been a great sounding board for me,” Cas told them.  He glanced over to Dean and smiled.  “He’s been a great help letting me decompress.”
Dean frowned and looked at her.  “What?” he asked.
“What’s up alpha?” he asked.  Cas squeezed his hand.  Dean tried to put on a brave face, but his scent had spiked in response to Cas’.  He knew he wasn’t going to like whatever Cas was about to say.
“We know you’re good for it and together we could save the land and the pack,” he continued.  “You could consider ours as a mating gift for you and Dean or reparation for past sins or whatever you want to call it.  This would be a gift, with no expectation of repayment.  And if, Sam would be able to renegotiate a reverse dowry with Naomi, then there would be money to restart the pack.”
Before Dean could blink Cas was up and had him out of his seat, pants around his ankles and bent over the back of the couch.  Dean was just catching his breath when he felt the cool lube dripping on his hole.  Cas must have grabbed the bottle they kept in the remote basket on the table next to the couch.
“Ok, baby, here we go.  Now,” she told Dean as she pulled away from the curb.  “Everyone has been notified but they will stay home until further notice.  I’ll stay with you like we planned.”
With a grunt the alpha moved off of him, quickly to be replaced with the second alpha.  He was quick to come all over Cas’ ass but he left it red and stinging from the spanking he administered.
Dean shrugged again.  “I don’t know.  We haven’t talked about it yet.  I don’t really need to see anyone for a few more weeks yet, so we have time to figure it out.”
Dean had a harder time brushing off his mother’s comments about his drinking when he accepted a second glass of wine.  Dean had said yes when asked about a glass, and even knew which wine would go best with the meal he ordered.  He wasn’t prepared for the glass to be the smallest glass of wine there ever was.  He knew it couldn’t have been more than four ounces.  When the waiter left to get his second glass, along with Jess’ second glass, his mother looked at him imploringly and stage whispered that maybe he should think about slowing down.
Castiel’s own pack had benefitted from the Winchester’s troubles.  When his mother had risen to Pack Alpha, she had taken his grandfather’s business and turned it into a multimillion-dollar company in just five short years.  She had continued to expand it over the next ten years until they had amassed a fortune and their pack numbers had grown.  What was once a small pack with a local marketing firm was now one of the largest firms in the central US.
Cas kept his eyes closed as he tried to swallow the nausea and roll himself into a ball.  He felt the bed dip and someone crawl under the sheet with him.  Gentle hands firmly pulled him from his position as he heard voices speaking again.  He couldn’t make out what they were saying, or even who it was because his nose was suddenly buried in his alpha’s neck and he was dragging in lungfulls of sweet apples and fresh air.  He felt the alpha rub his chin over his head marking him while he pulled his wrist up and tried to mark him gently with the rope burns.
“So, I guess we should find a tree,” Cas said.  He reached for the axe on the back of the saddle and Dean turned to look around.  He walked to several different trees before he found one that he liked.  Dean stared at it for a few moments.  He envisioned it in the den of the house, decorated with the new ornaments he bought and the soft lights.  He reached out a finger and touched a branch and he could tell that this was the tree.
“Dean!  Hey!”  Sam’s happy voice broke him out of his memories.
Dean’s excitement was contagious and the lingering irritation with his twin dissipated as he relaxed into the feel of Dean’s hand in his and his chatter about what they might see.  When they arrived in town, he pulled into the parking lot designated for the festival and saw Jimmy’s truck follow him in.  He parked and killed the engine.  Cas had made sure that Dean was dressed warmly enough before they left the house, but he made sure Dean’s scarf was secure when he helped him out of the truck.
Sam sighed.  “Mom just kept on and on about how-“ Sam stopped and took a breath.  “You know what, it doesn’t matter.  It didn’t go well and Mom said that she hasn’t heard from you since that call.  I’m assuming you’re putting distance there for a reason?”
Cas looked at him skeptically.  “We’ll see.”
Mate.  Cas wanted to mate him and marry him.  He wasn’t shocked.  Cas had talked about this.  Dean knew it and had even told Sam that he was all in.  But talking about it and having it actually happen were two different things, and Dean had never been one to put his faith in words alone.  How many times had his father said he would do better?  Try harder for the boys?  Often enough Dean could recite the speech along with his father.  But nothing ever changed.  Those were just empty words.
“What the fuck is that thing?” Dean pants. “Where—“
“Then why am I the only one saying it’s a
They sat in silence. The plastic encasing the mixtape clicked as Cas tapped a fingernail against it nervously. Finally, Crowley popped his lips, sighing.
?” Dean practically growls.
“Lacy, want to go look at the balloons while Cas gets his face painted?” Dean asks the girl. At her nod, Dean says goodbye with a wink in Cas’ direction, disappearing into the crowd.
John sneers at him. “Or what?”
“Because you never said anything!” Dean yells back, rising from his chair. “Where is this coming from? And why are you choosing to scream at me about it at
“Not a problem with these guys helping me,” Jody said, hooking a thumb over her shoulder. “Alex was here earlier too, but she picked up a shift at the hospital. There’s been a big influx of patients since the demon attacks last night.”
Raising a curious eyebrow, Cas stepped through the door frame, Dean’s clothes still clutched to his chest. Dean stayed in the doorway.
“I regret losing my grace.”
Sam and Eileen were bundled in the back of the car, huddling close with their steaming coffees in hand. Sam asked how the hunt went for Donna and Patience. Jody informed him it went fine—all the demons were taken care of. Sam gave a half-hearted reply, staring at his hands. The car fell silent.
“What are you going to with your Saturday?” asks Cas’ deep but quiet voice.
“God damn it,” Dean gritted out, turning away. Anger bit at his chest, making it itch; he swallowed it down. The last thing he wanted to do was blow up at Jack again. The kid had enough to worry about.
Lightning cracked open the clouds. Small flashes of electric blue danced through the air.
“We’re just going to find him now,” Sam says, smiling forcefully.
some recommended listening relevant to the chapter:
“Dean, I don’t want to piss you off,” Sam began.
The air was crisp and fresh, the sun just having set low in the sky. Dean leaned against the porch railing, beer hanging over the side. His knee bounced, hitting the wooden slats, the familiar itch to take off running, to walk straight into those trees and try to escape into something that at least made sense.
“Or a lobotomy,” Dean muttered around another sip of soup.
His fingertips reached out to touch it; his hand went right through. Confused, he took a step forward—even though the darkness looked solid, it parted for him as he walked..
A loaded moment passes. Cas leans toward the dashboard. “I’d like to put the
“Later, Dean,” Cas says dismissively, orienting himself toward Bob. He folds his hands on the table and does his best to look intimidating. “We don’t like you, and you don’t like us. But we are clearly hunting the same monster. Why aren’t you telling us what you think it is?”
“Oh. Good.” Dean pauses, then smacks his legs with his palms. “Well, better get back to it. You don’t mind if we watch a movie in the living room, do you?”
After a few quiet minutes, Cas pulled Dean to his chest, hooking his chin over Dean’s shoulder. Dean idly traced patterns into Cas’s skin.
“Hey, no way,” Dean says, snapping his fingers and gesturing next to him. “Get your ass up here, man. This bed is huge.”
Cas pushes himself into Dean’s chest, laying his head on Dean’s shoulder. He feels as though he can’t look at him during this conversation.
“How many demons were awake?” Jody cut in.
“Well, that goes without saying. You always had anxiety as a kid.”
“I really feel that we need to talk about this, Dean. So we can move forward.”
“Who, Cas?”
He can’t even look at Cas; the vice around his heart contracts too painfully. He adjusts gears as they round a curve in the road with a little more force than necessary. “This time doesn’t have to be different.”

?” he repeated.
Among the chaos, Dean has teetered to his feet and is fighting beside Castiel, landing the occasional second blow after Castiel deals the real damage. Castiel grabs Dean by the arm, leading him toward the door that opens to the hallway. He fumbles for his taser, aiming and firing at a man running toward them.
“All right, Winchester,” he mutters to himself, sitting up and swinging his legs over the side of the bed, “time to get a fucking grip.”
Dean saw Cas dying, bleeding out on the couch—
fucking choice
“He disappeared?”
“Yeah, to get me to stop asking, probably.” Lisa crosses her arms over her chest and looks toward the bar’s entrance. “I’m positive that I saw the last of Dean Winchester
"Oh good, you're awake" the doctor points out as she enters alongside the sheriff. Now say what you will about this town but the people have great observation skills.
He did a few with sam but mostly he tells him to go with Eileen. They work well together and he trusts her to have his little brother's back.
"Let's see, I cook although not good enough for any payin customer to eat" I plan hits "exercise" I clean and organise my weapons "I read a-"
"Including me" the smile is gone and cas regrets asking, dean takes another glass and pores himself a drink too. "So? Whatcha running from? Don't worry My bar is like a confessional, everything remains here"
"I don't know why you hate me but stay away and no one will get hurt" he tries to plea with the dog who barks at him again with a show of it's teeth.
Cas says, cocking a bullet into the gun’s chamber, “I’ll just keep trying until something sticks.”

Jack winced. “Hundreds of thousands. At the very least.”
Dean goes still. Takes a deep breath. “What?” he asks on the outtake.
“Why would I be angry at my breakfast foods?”
talk to him about where you two stand, before he starts to think he did something wrong.”
“Sorry about letting it throw you around like that. I needed it to talk.” Gabriel picked up the angel blade, pressing it into Dean’s palm. “Good news is, I got a working theory about where the Empty put good old Cassie.”
Sam huffed out a laugh; it was pale of any humor. “This is starting to feel sort of familiar.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was shocking how similar their families’ stories were: Danny and his dad were a hunting team, a family business, like the Winchesters. Danny’s mother died by a supernatural monster, like Sam and Dean’s mom. And like John, Danny’s dad was on an obsessive, self-destructive path to find revenge.
“Navigate me,” Dean demands, tossing his android phone over in Cas’ lap.
That gets a smile out of him. It’s like the sun breaking. “That was nice.”
Dean grunts and throws the fridge door closed. “No food in this goddamn place.”
choice, you know? If that’s the way I’m gonna go.”
Sam looked at Cas: where Sam was devastated, Cas was stone. He just stared at Dean, frozen, like there was some huge decision to be made that Sam couldn’t see.
Castiel feels a warmth to his cheeks. “I didn’t mean to cause him stress.”
Dean blinks. “Are you quitting?”
Dean held out his hand, counting down the fingers one by one. “It’s barely a lead at all, it could be dangerous if it
“I said,
Cas turns. He looks nervous—clutching a backpack in one hand, a book in the other. “Dean, you know that you don’t have to accompany me. I know it’s not your type of outing. I know that the things I said to you last week might prompt you to think that you have to do this, but…”
“Yeah. Yeah, I…” Dean pressed his fingers harder into his chest, bruising, as his heart stuttered. “I couldn’t… I couldn’t tell you because it’s like—it’s like this hole. And it’s right here,” he jabbed his thumb into his chest, right in the middle, “and it’s huge, and time heals and all that bullshit so it scabbed over but—but it makes me crazy. I can’t think about anything else. And I’m really sorry I didn’t tell you, kid. I really am. I couldn’t do it because I’m a coward, and because thinking about—about him… dying or how you’d react, I just couldn’t… do it.”
His depleted grace is causing this problem to increase tenfold. Without his grace to stifle them, these emotions these unhealthy amounts of emotion are causing physiological responses that Castiel doesn’t know how to interpret.
that even if Jack repairs the tear, that the Empty’s still gonna try to use you as a way to open it up again.” Dean brushed his wet hair from his forehead. “I know this plan’s a long shot, but it’s better than the alternative: that you stay here and die.”
The room spun as his eyes scanned its occupants. Too short, too skinny, too bachelorette party, too smiley… His gaze landed on a man in the corner of the bar nursing a beer and glaring at it. Muscles rippled underneath his tight black shirt as he raised the beer bottle to take a drink.
“It’s simple,” Sam argues, “we haven’t met her yet and that’s a problem. I mean we’ve even met your
“Human.” Cas scoffed. “Right.”
The elementary school Dean works at is the stark contrast of Castiel’s university: cheerful, bright, and full of laughing little humans tripping through the halls. Castiel smiles at the cut-out music notes on Dean’s classroom’s door. He remembers helping Dean decorate his classroom in the summer; putting those music notes up and grumbling at the glue getting in his hair. But, secretly, Castiel loved every moment of decorating Dean’s kindergarten music classroom with ridiculous cut-outs and instruments.
hello, i'm not dead! this is probably the longest this story has gone without an update, sorry guys... real life stuff and friggin WRITERS BLOCK all slammed into me at the same time but! here i am. special thanks to lexi and lindsay who read through this chapter for me and reassured me it wasn't garbage and also gave me wonderfully angsty suggestions
Probably because of the fact that he’s in love with him.
“You first,” Dean offers, tilting his glass towards Castiel. “Hit me.”
“It’s crap to think that there’s one person out there for you, based on a goddamn tattoo, and that just because there’s a person chosen for you in the first place, that you should automatically be with that person.”
Castiel nods in affirmation. “I know about the letters.”
Behind Cas’s back, memory-Dean’s face had dropped. Because he felt like something had slipped away, like he had done something very wrong.
Food. That was something he’d need before going back on the road. Food, and caffeine.
So it’s not like he outright wanted the notes to stop, but after that day of complaining about them, they stop coming.
“You should call it,” Sam says, again prying his big nose into Dean’s personal business.
Castiel sits on the couch, hands in his lap, looking adorably out of place in the situation. “Why me?”
Nodding, Dean tried to keep the worry from his face. “But Gabriel said he’d drop in to check on Jack, right?” Waving his hands, he added, “To do his whole… grace check-up?”
Don’t change the subject.”
“Who is he?”
“Like my brain is inside out,” Dean mutters against the pillow. “But the pain’s gone.”
“That was my thought.” Cas moves toward the couch. “That is why us being a convincing married couple might help the monster target us.”
you don’t want to be with that person if you don’t even give it a chance?” Lisa shoots back.
“Sorry?”
“Cas, tell me what’s going on, please.”
“Dean, are you listening? Should we get—”
moment that Cas was human and staying in the bunker, and all the crap that went down from it. And I did the only thing I thought would help: contacting him.”
When Mary is silent, Sam hedges, “Mom?”
“Because I’m in love with you, okay, you idiot?
don’t do anything,” Gabriel said. “Jack here has enough juice to mend that—tear between the two universes, if you will. No more geological events caused by explosions, no more possible world implosion.”
“You asked about anything embarrassing. Saying a name is far from that.”
Castiel hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he smells the burger’s enticing aroma; he resists the urge to grab it and shove it all into his mouth, risks of choking be damned. “God wants humans to utilize their potential for happiness as much as possible,” Castiel explains. “With a soulmate, a human can be perfectly bonded to a life partner and know what happiness is.”
Cas’s voice whispered.
“I think it’s time you leave now,” Dean suggests firmly.
“Where’s Cas?” Dean muttered. Even though he didn't have the energy for it, he looked over Sam's shoulder. "Did he die? Is he..."
Castiel is sitting on the couch with Thoreau's
The walk to the next bedroom felt endless. Dean’s legs were numb from disuse, his muscles shaking from the added strain. He felt the tugging at his chest, that thread that pulled him toward the bedroom door across the hall. He heard voices coming from behind it; Jack’s quiet laugh, and Claire’s unusually animated voice. Dean pushed open the door, sunlight from the room spilling onto him. His breath caught. He stood still.
He sees Cas on the edge of the bed, head bent over the phone that he holds in his hands. Dean smiles sleepily at the bare and hard planes of Cas' back, peppered with red marks where Dean's nails dug into his skin just hours earlier. Because of Cas' usually tense frame and stature, Dean had assumed that trying to make love to an angel would be like colliding with a mountain. Instead, Cas was immediately soft and pliant in Dean's arms. He feels a swell in his chest when he remembers Cas' punctuated gasps and uncharacteristically emotional moans.
“Benny?”
Shaking his head, Dean begins, “Like
The waitress, an older woman with more frown lines than smile ones, raised an eyebrow. “Your cup’s full.”
He tries to think harder —
Castiel knows how stubborn humans can be. He was a guardian angel for eighteen years to one of the most stubborn teenage girls alive. He can see that Dean is much like Claire: deaf to anyone once they make a decision and determined to get their way. The tactic that Castiel learned with Claire was offering a sense of reason.
He realizes how significant this hug is to him; how desperately he wants to keep holding onto Dean forever.
(See the end of the chapter for
A skinny kid with a beanie on that took up almost his whole head shifted from foot to foot. He ran his tongue over his teeth, thinking. “Couldn’t sleep that night, so I was outside. And I saw stars.”
“Cas!” Dean shakes his shoulder. “Cas, what is it?”
There’s a suspiciously long amount of silence from Cas’ end. It’s explained when Cas asks, “Dean, what is this?” while holding up a very pink, very sparkly tape case.
And Dean had meant to say something sarcastic, make a deflective joke out of it. There were a hundred snarky lines that had run through his mind. But what came out was a soft, gentle, “You remember when you used to watch me sleep?”
the back jacket read.
Raising an eyebrow, Dean crossed his arms. “Fine. But it’d better be the best freakin’ hug I’ve ever gotten.”
“I’ve gotten better,” Cas protests. “Interrogating humans and interrogating angels are entirely different things. I was one of the best interrogators in Heaven, I thought it would translate.”
<3 i love you all, and your feedback gives me so much valuable help in my writing, so I'd love to hear your thoughts.
So this habit of packing up his scant possessions at first light, it’s a bit difficult to break. It takes a quick minute to unpack everything back onto the bed: the few articles of clothing, the book that Sam lent him before Cas left the bunker.
Anna’s voice, sharp and short, breaks off Dean’s frantic rambling. “Dean. He’s lost his grace. He can’t hear you. He has to heal.”
Cas should look happier; this is the most leeway Dean’s given the whole soulmate topic since they met. But Cas just frowns and looks down at his bare feet, tucking his legs to his chest. “I appreciate it, Dean.”
“It’s kind of weird phrasing,” Sam said, “but I know where it’s from. It’s from a book;
He’s expecting indignation from Dean,or annoyance, anger; not… acceptance.
“Thank you,” Castiel whispers back with perfunctory nod.
The eye strain and stiff back is worth it for Cas approaching him over the next few weeks to discuss the books.
“Well, it’s successfully
“Oh, I’m… I’m sorry.”
He is addicted to tea (Dean never sees him without it).
When he hits the warm air in Dean’s house, he immediately begins shaking. Or, maybe he was shaking before but didn’t notice. He’s not sure. For the countless time that day he’s frustrated with his lack of grace.
“When you left a location without informing me,” Castiel continues to explain. “Again.” Dean still doesn’t look up. “That’s dangerous,” Castiel adds.
“If you’re not feeling well, you should rest.”
The family looked over at him again, this time the parents scowling. Dean grabbed his bag, sprinting, bursting out of the diner door and onto the main street. He tracked the man walking with harried steps down the main street, his shoulders hunched and hands shoved into his pockets. Dean would recognize him anywhere.
He opened his eyes.
Dean squeezed and released his palms. He didn’t remind Cas that they needed the angel warding against his homicidal brothers and sisters out there looking for revenge on a certain ex-angel. “Well, bet Jack’s happy not to have a god complex anymore,” he joked half-heartedly.
have taken it less seriously. If I hadn't let my emotions get the better of me, then all of this wouldn't have happened."
“Dean.” Cas’ jawline is hard, determined. “Saving you; using my grace to heal you both times. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”
“I’m tired, Sam,” Dean sighed. “I’m tired of all this bullshit. And if dying means closing these gates, if that’s what I gotta do to be something of use, then that’s fine. I’m okay with it.”
“I promise, Cas.”
Pulling the coat around him tighter, he squeezed his eyes shut. Laid down on the cold, hard ground. It couldn’t be Dean. It was only an echo, broken fragments of a beloved memory—a storm on the horizon.
That elicits a happy sigh from Dean. He pulls away; Cas’ hands instinctively grab his shirt, wanting to pull him back to him. “You know, there’s a memory we haven’t talked about yet,” Dean says.
Dean stops at a curb, letting cars go by without trying to cross to the other side of the block. He shoves his hands into his pockets and squints into the sun. “Do you like your angel family?”
that all of Cas’ grace was gone.
people I consider my parents. Losing Castiel—” He cut off, shaking his head. “I can’t do that again.”
Dean held his flannel closer to his nose. His eyes blurred from the sharp headlights on the road. “Going too fast,” he muttered.
“Oh, I know,” it giggles. Its limbs grow, stretching toward them. “That’s why eating you next will be a special sort of triumph.”
“Whoa, slow down! Why in the hell are you getting so defensive?”
After pulling up to the elementary school (an hour and a half before his class starts, therefore ample time to look for Cas), he jobs to the entrance and raps on the door for the janitor to unlock it for him, impatiently tapping his fingers against his leg.
He messaged the member of the group who posted it, who gave him a vague location for the low, low price of fifty dollars through PayPal. Dean just hoped, as he walked down the sunny main street of the town, that it was worth it.
“It’s healthier if we talk about it,” Cas says, the disapproval in his voice thick.
Dean clutched his glass of whiskey more tightly, the sound of Gabriel’s crunching punching at his headache. “Think we’ll get to the damn point anytime soon?”
“Barely.”
“You really want me to say it?” When Cas didn’t reply, just stared at him in shock, Dean threw up a hand. “Jesus, Cas, you—you said that your voice was you the whole time. You
“You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to do this,” Cas whispered against Dean’s lips. “How much I thought I would never have it. Never…”
“I—” Jack licked his lips, hesitant. “There’s more to it, though.”
house!” the woman exclaims, poking her head through the doorframe. “You have an open floor plan, I’m so jealous! Bob—that’s my husband—he’s useless at remodeling, and I told him to hire someone to open up our walls because for god’s sake there’s
“Charlie…” Anna pauses, and Castiel can hear her shifting. “Why is Dean so upset? Castiel is clearly recovering, and he’s going to be fine. I don’t understand why he’s still so restless.”
In reply, Dean rises to his feet, albeit unsteadily. “I can make it.” He subconsciously pushes his hand into his jeans pocket; an action that Cas has noticed him doing habitually over the last two days, but one Cas never understood.
As Crowley’s hand went to the glove compartment, Cas’s eyes minutely widened. He grabbed Crowley’s wrist before he could unhitch the latch.
Dean seems to understand; he lets out a happy laugh and takes Castiel’s hand in his (Castiel supposes that it would feel nice, if he could feel it at all). "Your voice works, Cas," he says with a grin.
“Faith, you say?” Jerry hooks a thumb over his shoulder toward the cul de sac. “Saw her just ten minutes ago leaving her house.”
Dean slammed his bedroom door, sitting on the end of his bed. Miracle jumped up behind him, whining as he laid down against Dean’s back. The cell phone in Dean’s jeans pocket buzzed as he scrubbed a hand over his face.
Anna’s face drops into a neutral expression as she directs her attention to Charlie. “I had to talk to Castiel about something.”
“A sunflower,” Cas says. He looks down at his hands. “Because it tilts toward the sun.”
Dean grunts in agreement. He remembers trudging through
“Dean—”
Dean follows him, arm hanging uselessly at his side. Probably dislocated, he thinks when the movement makes him hiss in pain.
"Remember your promise, okay?" Sam asked, voice cracking.
Castiel looks for a moment at Sam’s reassuring smile. “I’ll go,” he finally relents. “At the very least to apologize to him.”
“But your choice was taken away,” Cas says, somehow finding his voice. “I didn’t—”
Cas’ mouth is agape; Dean turns on his heel and stomps back to the trail.
Dean stopped, mid-gulp, his lips still poised on the opening of the beer bottle. As he set down the bottle, Sam saw that crinkle between Dean’s eyebrows form, the one he usually gets when he’s upset. “Now why the hell would you bring something like that up now?” he asked.
Sam shrugs. “My guess? Someone tried to make it look like a vampire.”
“I’m choosing this,” Cas said firmly.
As an angel with limited grace, he had his moments of feeling useless. But at least then there was a fire burning in him, one that he could feel and use when he needed. Now, his chest his empty, his body can’t move, and Dean won’t open his eyes. Castiel would yell in frustration, if his body would let him.
“And there’s a strike three.” Bob flattens both palms on the table, stands from his chair. “This ain’t convincing in the slightest, boys. If you don’t give us a good, solid reason to trust you right now, we’re treating you as suspects.”
Castiel says, his eyes not leaving her sight, “I promise you that I will not force Dean into anything he does not want to do. Me living here in this house, me interfering with his love life; it all ends when he says the word. He said he would give Lisa a try, and the moment that he decides it’s enough, I will leave his life forever. I have…” He stops, wetting his dry lips before he says, “I have come to care for Dean’s well-being.”
“What’s up, Cas?” Dean asks, not looking up from his phone.
“See? A case. And definitely a supernatural one.”
“Of course he did. He bared his soul to me, because Dean Winchester is the most emotionally mature man I’ve ever met.”
And not to mention, Castiel is far too busy in his tenure year as a linguistics associate professor to think about these things.
“So what are you looking for, when you observe me? My compatibility with kids?” Dean leans back in his chair, hands threaded behind his head. He regards Castiel for a moment, side-eyeing the door to the lounge, before his face splits into a grin. “Or are you just looking for an excuse to stare at my ass?”
“Castiel.” Anna takes his arm, waving the paper in his face. “I’m being cruel so that you'll listen. If you fall for Dean—if you get involved in any way and come between him and his soulmate—“
Cas loves him. Somehow, the sun seems even brighter.
He finally looked at Sam, who had gone completely still, unblinking. It wasn’t characteristic, since Sam was usually a squirmy drunk. He was staring at Dean very strangely, and for some reason, tears were pooling in his eyes.
Castiel lowers his hand. Clears his throat and runs a sweaty palm through his hair. He walks to Dean, who is standing there with his arms still raised and his endlessly green eyes wide. He walks until his chest is in line with Dean’s, and he can feel Dean’s arms lightly touching his.
Dean is quiet, yet still conscious. Cas asks his question again, this time jostling his shoulder.
Castiel isn’t deterred. “You’re trying to make me uncomfortable so that I’ll leave.”
“No, you don’t.”
“Well, for one, you’re not the person who punched me.”
Dean nearly lost it at the familiarly earnest look in Cas’s eyes. He grabbed at Cas’s hand, unable to help himself. Cas’s frown deepened.
man?”
Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise; this must have been when they were tracking down Lucifer’s vessel. When Cas and Crowley went off to hunt on their own.
“Dude.” Dean snaps his fingers. “Exactly.”
Knowing he’s proceeding into some sort of trap, Castiel says cautiously, “Yes.”
It was Cas’s voice that almost did him in. His knees got a little weaker, his head a little heavier. He took a shaky breath through his nose.
Dean swiped a hand over his face, taking a sharp sip of the rest of the beer and firmly crushing the can in his hand before turning on his heel, walking toward the sliding glass door into the warm house.
He takes the stairs that are down the hall from Dean’s office. His feet hitting the metal stairs echo sharply in the empty space. Striding through the lobby of the office building, he narrowly avoids connecting shoulders with a group of men who are walking quickly in the other direction.
Dean scrunched his forehead into a frown. “What the hell’s that supposed to mean?”
“Or setting the record for eating the biggest cheeseburger.”
thoughts about his live-in cupid.
“Is this him?” she asks, her voice hushed.
“Fine,” Dean says with a gusty sigh. “We’ll go. But only if you’ll shut up about it. And only if you change out of that ridiculous fucking leather jacket; who are you, the Fonz?”
“Is she flirting, or just interested in ripping out your jugular?” May asks.
“Yes I goddamn can,” Dean says. “The only way this is gonna work, and that we won’t kill each other, is that we pretend it never happened.”
Jack’s eyes glowed a bright yellow as his face contorted. “Stop.”
Dean scoffs. “Nah, man. That’s just one of the perks of being human.” He sends the text and looks up; Cas is rubbing his neck irritably. “It could also be because of the fact that you’ve had your head bent over a book for the last few hours.”
“Yeah,
know. It thrummed in his bones.
*wildly throws rose petals all over dean and cas' naked bodies* good job, kids, you did the feelings thing
“Cas, c’mon.” Dean waves him off. “She was just returning your coat. And being a concerned neighbor. Something’s off, I agree but—I dunno. I’m just not seeing it.”
He sent an application for an available house to rent in the same breath that he sent a move-out notice to Frank.
Cas glares. Nods.
“I was so stupid. Incredibly, deeply stupid. I don’t know why I agreed to do this case with him. It won’t change anything, it’s—”
The countertop under his hands faded as Dean saw instead the blackness, engulfing Cas: first his torso, then working its way up to his face, those blue eyes burning brilliantly with tears getting swallowed up last, disappearing as Dean struggled to breathe—
She sighs exasperatedly, slamming her palms on the table. “Darn it! This is why people shouldn’t tell me secrets! Dean, I should tell you something. But I don’t think it’s my place to tell. In fact, being the middleman in this situation is very conflicting. And I—”
“Yes,” Cas says, smiling down at his hands. “It’s a wise page to take.”
“There’s a soccer game tomorrow,” Bob says. “An adult intramural thing hosted by the housing association; whole neighborhood should be there.”
Cas tilts his head. “Falling in love is bad,” he says. “I understand. Now that I’m more human, I understand.”
about going easy on your ass.”
When Dean speaks, his voice is quiet, and he stares at his brother with a dangerous expression. “I said. To leave it alone.”
Sam shook his head. “Dean—”
“Dean.” Castiel takes a step backward, lightly pulling his arm from Dean’s grasp. “You should go on your date.”
“I’ll learn, then,” Dean said, throwing up a hand. “And I won’t even make fun of you for listening to those musicals you like, or that stuffy classical music like Sibelius. We can visit Claire and Jody in South Dakota, hang out with Jack too whenever he wants. And we can go on walks, argue about dumb things like politics or talk about the weather or bees or what we’re gonna make for dinner and… and we can…”
“Oh shit,” Sam says emphatically.
it is. I'm genuinely afraid of what it could be.” He looks at Dean. “Mostly because I’ve been alive for millennia and even I can’t figure out what it could be.”
When Cas gets too cold they huddle under a blanket, shoulder to shoulder, and watch the sun sleepily dip in the horizon.
"I doubt you would ever be rendered insane, Dean," Cas says with a small shake of his head. "Besides, through all this trial, I was able to meet you."
Aloud, he says, “I can’t leave until I’ve completed my task successfully, or until I’ve explored every option to pair you with Lisa and they have all failed.”
“Yeah, I know, just… I’m just trying to let bygones be bygones, okay? And it’s not like… it’s not completely
Baby rumbled under his feet as he turned the ignition and Dean settled into his seat, sighing.
That Irish shit-ho—“ He abruptly shuts his mouth. “Dempsey’s, it is,” he grumbles, veering the quickest way possible to Massachusetts Street.
He stopped in the doorway, bracing himself with both hands as he raised his eyes to the scene. He and Cas were sitting on the bed on opposite sides. Dean was a little tipsy from the beers, a little hyper from the two bowls of ice cream he inhaled. Even though they weren’t next to each other, Dean had gravitated toward Cas anyway, both their heads bent toward each other as they watched something on Dean’s phone.
Mary talks about her small and local bookstore and how its profit margin is finally in the black this year.
Cas was able to get out of bed and roam around during the third day. He kept running his hands over everything—books, different texture surfaces of tables and even the living room rug, the flannel that Sam leant him. It was like seeing a kid experience new things for the first time. And every time he discovered something new, his face got even softer. More peaceful.
Cas scrunches his nose as he looks down at his outfit, protesting, “I don’t see anything wrong with it.”
Cas nods and mentally side-steps the sudden stab of hurt. “We could sit more closely,” he offers. “We may have to do that at the dinner.”
“It was.” Cas gives him a look. “So I’m not exactly ‘bad at everything’, as you said during that case.”
Cas sighs and gives her a small smile. “You’re still very stubborn.”
“Gabe threw me into the antiverse,” Dean said. He stared up at the flashing sky. “He thinks that Cas is here.”
“Are you really okay?” Sam asked softly.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, but it’s nice to meet you,” Jody replied. “Hear you’re our new god, Jack. I hope homicidal tendencies aren’t a genetic thing in your family.”
Castiel opens his eyes and wakes up yelling Dean’s name.
“Faith. And you’ll have to define the term ‘canoodling’.”
“I don’t give a
“And if a human doesn’t give a shit about that?” Dean asks around a mouthful of burger.
The last thing he saw before Jack’s fingers gently touched his forehead and everything went black was Sam’s wide, frightened eyes.
Dean sniffed, nodded, and pushed at Sam with his knee. “Scoot. You’ll give him a scar.”
"I don't care," Dean argues, knowing he's sounding like the small petulant ant of a human that he is. "I'm here for you now Cas, for better or for worse. And Heaven can't fuck with you like that again, not without me fighting tooth and nail to make sure they don't."
“If he’s hidden, Jack won’t be able to direct you to him,” Gabriel said. “It’d be a failed mission before you even start it.”
When Lisa gives him a strange look, Dean quickly changes the subject from Cas. He learns, over their burgers, that Lisa is also a nurse that juggles her time between random shift schedules and yoga instructing. He also learns that if teaching yoga paid enough, she would commit her time fully to that. She has a dog, two older sisters, and parents that have been happily married for thirty-five years.
, and
“Well… no.” He avoids Dean’s eyes.
“Okay, well, everything else makes sense,” Sam continues. “When they bite, they release venom, and it paralyzes and eventually kills the victim. Maybe the Vetala in your area keeps getting interrupted in their kills for some reason, and can’t finish the job.”
“Cas! Cas, where are you, man? Answer me!”
“I’m going to call Sam.”
“Yes, I do.”
His hopeful look makes Cas say, “Of course, Dean. Thank you. It was a great day.”
Castiel tries hard not to wince when her grace suddenly slams him into the chair in front of him. “Naomi—“
But it’s hard to separate the two time periods—Cas as a new human, present Cas—as he just sits there at the counter, staring down at his coffee while Dean makes breakfast. This is how the whole shit-show started: Cas losing track of time by spacing out, not making eye contact, only supplying monosyllabic answers. Sam called it a defense tactic, said that Cas was just retreating behind a wall of sorts to process all the emotions he was feeling. But it’s a wall that Dean never liked being shut out of, and a wall that Cas refused to let him pass for six months in the bunker.
fake-marry Cas,
Cas isn’t in danger, Dean tells himself.
Castiel looks over his shoulder. Everyone in the classroom has turned their heads to gape at the man who has a wild expression on his face, chest heaving.
. His visitor’s pass is slightly lopsided on his jacket.
Dean cleared his throat. Nodded. “Okay. Be back with that water.”
Cas scrubs a hand over his face and snaps the stove off as the kettle starts whistling.
Dean whispers, on the precipice of something he doesn’t want to name, “Then why did you leave every goddamn time?”
“What did you think?”
made it come to this!”
Black ooze bubbled inside the portal, its black glossy surface catching the hazy light. It looked different, now that it wasn’t in a dim cave in Idaho or wrapped around Cas’s body as it snatched him away. Jack stood over the portal with closed eyes, his hands glowing blue. Dean stopped next to Gabriel and crossed his arms.
“Okay. But you said no to a date.”
“—doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try again.” Sam peers at his watch. “And I’m not due at the firm for another hour, but thanks for asking.”
“I didn’t see him in the Empty,” Jack said, his face contorted. “I thought I’d be able to at least sense him, at least see his grace, but I… I couldn’t.”
“Totally, dude,” Dean says distractedly, rustling the papers together as he cleans up a spot for Cas to sit.
Dean frowns at him in the rearview mirror. “What do you mean?”
story. Maybe another time, okay?”
stupid. You kill all those people, we finally find you out, and you play the dumb act? Not going to work.”
“Dean.” Cas tilts his head to a roughly shaped outline in the dark.
“Yeah, sure, Cas, go alone and get sprung on by some monsters. No way.”
The ground rumbled, vibrating the ice underneath Dean’s knees. Spidery cracks appeared in the glassy water, splintering beneath him. Dean looked over his shoulder at the shore a few yards behind him—a looming creature landed in the snow, shadows leaking off of it. It was slender, inhumanely tall—red eyes suddenly gleamed through the darkness.
Castiel abruptly stands, his knees knocking against the table, causing the slices of his sandwich to fracture from each other. Dean follows, stumbling over his words.
She bites her lip and shrugs. “In a sense?”
“Yeah, just direct me when I get to the main road.”
“I won’t paint your whole face,” Claire tells Cas very seriously.
His hands carefully pulled up Cas’s shirt, his heart stopping at the sight of Cas’s tan and bare skin. He carefully moved forward, kissing Cas softly as he unbuttoned his jeans.
Please let me know what you thought of the chapter<3
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Anna asks beside him, looking no less nervous than he feels.
Dean jumps back a foot, startled. “What the—what are you doing here, bitch?”
Squinting, Dean raises his head toward the Facebook page sprawled out on the screen. There’s a picture of a very blue-eyed, very chiseled, very dark-haired man smiling in his profile picture. Dean can immediately match the voice to the face—he even recognizes remnants of young, eight-year-old Cas in between those smile lines—and his soul leaves his body for a moment.
Dean holds up a hand to stop Cas before they round the corner. He peeks his head around, peering into the darkness, at the fractured light spilling in through the cracks of the bleachers above. He gestures for Cas to follow.
“I’m gonna go… research,” Sam says, fumbling with his chair and vacating the kitchen.
“And I have an assignment,” Castiel continues, withdrawing a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and displaying Michael’s elegant cursive.
“I’ll get on it,” Sam said. “Eileen and I have been making a contact list of hunters the last few months. I can make some calls.”
When Cas didn’t say anything for a long minute, Dean cleared his throat. “It’s been a few days, obviously, so I wasn’t able to dust in here. But other than that, it… should be good to go.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam shot another look at Eileen, adjusting in his seat. “All I’m saying is to… think about the bigger picture here.”
The admission was soft, small.
“The broken glass doesn’t seem to have injured you,” Castiel concludes.
“What?” Dean laughs, slapping Cas on the shoulder. Cas is trying to hide a grin. “Uneventful, my ass. What’s the promotion?”
There’s movement by the barn door that catches Dean’s eye; it’s only a flash of bird’s wings glinting in the dark. He makes a noncommittal sound and sinks further into his seat, the leather creaking.
Dean’s tired green eyes are the last thing Castiel sees before he slips into unconsciousness.
Dean jolts awake, flinging his hand out from under the pillow and whipping around, knife held in front of him. He forgets he’s on a couch; loses his balances and smacks to the floor. He rolls over on his back and squints upward. Cas is standing over him, hands on hips, bed hair sticking every which-way. Real-Cas looks substantially more grumpy than dream-Cas.
"No not our wedding, our first date"
"You better still be here when I wake up" he mumbled what in his head sounded alot more threatening.
"What look is that?" He finishes his second drink
So dean stays in the bunker, he looks through the books for anything on the empty and finds nothing useful. He goes to the dean cave to watch a movie but all he can see is the empty place of his family.
"Is it?"
"Welcome to Bobby's, what can I get ya?" A voice that does not belong in public specially during day light said.
"You guys doing okay?"
"Yes, just arrived last night"
When he wakes up again it's close to sundown, his body remains sore and the first thought in his head is 'alcohol would make this better.'
Heaven is in your eyes
"Calm down kid, I'll get go get her." Dean puts a reassuring hand on her shoulder. The door opens again.
Dean snaps out of it first "HEEEY, look what the cat dragged in."
He opened his eyes and looked up to his face. "Why didn't we do this sooner?"
And not making any acquaintances
"Yeah, so I guess your memorie's fine"  dean says jokingly but cas can see the relief on his face.
Sam signed something to eileen dean was too nervous to understand.
"Morning sunshine" dean said without attempting to move.
Another old songs plays, Jerry goes back to his seat but before dee can go back to hers dean is in front of her with an extended hand "will you give me the honor?"
"Sorry?"
"It's a nice theory" he offers
"How so?" So far he doesn't see the appeal
Assuming  the lighthouse to be as boring as the beach he decides to skip it and find himself something to do, eat or drink. Whichever comes first, he's not going to be picky.
"Yeah, sheriff told me the story."
"Either they are or their parents were or their parent's parents were, at least everyone i know." Dean poures himself another drink,downs it at once and fills both their glasses again "This is the perfect place for it."
'Killing nick and everyone involved would be a good start'
Cas doesn't know any other teenagers but if they're all like Claire then they're getting a very unfair reputation.
"58 years ago today remember? You told your folks you were going out with Jane because they didn't like me, I borrowed my brothers bike and we went dancing"
She laugh at his completely reasonable advice, Dean shakes his head but cas can see a hint of smile on his face. After another round of apology they wave goodbye and cas drags himself into his house.
There is cold breeze that makes him shiver, he looks at the pale sun and the sky and all the beauty around him. The world they saved. The world that was now safe because of them. Wide and beautiful and amazing but he couldn't bring himself to enjoy any of it.
"Physical training"
Dean hummed and closed the remaining space between their lips , he kissed him slowly but surely. It didn't matter that he had morning breath or that cas froze for moments before putting a gentle hand behind Dean's head and kiss him back.
He managed to make his way to the beach finding it too busy for his taste and also a weekday, force of habit makes him take everyone under observation and his mind goes trough various highly improbable scenarios of how every individual would try to kill him which is stupid and a bit paranoid considering how throughly paraiod he was when he picked this town and this new identity for himself. There's no logical reason to worry, No one was going to find him here. The town was barely on any maps.
Seeing sights
Two couples, one very old and one very young were eating in quite. finding  himself a booth to sit at castiel tried not to be too self conscious.
"Dean I'm-"
"Only if you watch over me"
"Mr shurley I know you said it wasn't my fault but I'm really really sorry for hitting you with my car, please tell us if there's anything we could do for you"
Everything hit him again, cas was back. Really actually back and still here.
"Cas"
"So you new in town?" dean more declares than ask as cas finished his first drink.
Getting drunk?
Cas met Dean's eyes for the frist time and gave him a shy little smile which dean tried and fail to give back.
Dear god he had to say it, he actually had to ask cas to join him on the bed.
"Yes. walk, run, hyke that sort of thing" he can see the look of disapproval on dean's face. Facanating how every single feeling he has is so clearly and honestly shown if you pay the slightest attention (or borderline stare in cas's case).
When dean got back he saw the angel standing exactly where he had left him. He remembered that time he told him "don't ever change" and when cas said "you changed me" he fought to urge to attack hug cas untill he realized he didn't have to. He could just hold cas and it would be okay. So he did.
"Duke's a good boy" dean protests
"Yeah, some time" dean mindlessly licks his lips and cas barley suppressed the urge to pull him close and taste them for himself. Neither of them breaks the silence or whatever the fuck it is they're doing with their eyes until they hear people coming in.
"Walk?"
"I told you it wasn't her fault, If anything it was that damn dog's fault"
He's never actually eaten alone at a diner before, it was always a meeting with someone sketchy or "night outs" with gabriel and balthazar.
"Well When you put it that wa-"
"Not bad, but the fucker persistent" dean says in a poor attempt at lightening the mood.
He curses himself for not having any at home and thinks of the bar he saw earlier. Getting drunk to forgets his pain is exactly what a normal person would do, he's already becoming so good at this.
He turns back to see crowley and company. He only met crowley in person last night when he arrived and went to get the keys to his new house from him, the rest have been done by his new fake lawyer.
"Yeah" he said "yeah we're good" they followed sam back to the war room and drank in celebration for a while. Dean sent a quite thank you prayer to jack and sort of invited him to join them which remained unanswered.
Pushing back the stupid and somewhat graphic thoughts he embarks on his first walk on a beach. Five minutes later he fails to understand all the fuss, it's just walking on an uncomfortable ground. why do so many people make such a big deal out of it? He might never know. Much like a lot of other things he fails to understand about life or so he keeps hearing.
Towards the ends of the song Jerry begins to look a little faint, they hold eachither tight moving slowly in their place. They kiss when the song is over, Dean and the young couple cheer them which makes dee blush even more.
"Whatever" he said to no one, a glance on his watch showed the time to be 9am and way too early for drinking even by his standards which admittedly have been questionable lately.
"You're back" he took a reluctant step back to see cas's face. No trace of the black goo, no hurt. he was good and he was back.
They had the rest of their lives, maybe eternity to try make it perfect and romantic. For now they stayed lazily in bed kissing like an old married couple and they were happy.
She looks uncertain. Dean walks towards them "cmon dee, before I steal your man. He's still pretty handsome you know." Then he glances at cas "im sure the gentleman won't have any problems with having a bit of love in the air" he says wiggling his eyebrows.
"Dean?"
.....
"You're awake!!" She shouts with the same enthusiasm as dean, definitely family  "I am so sorry for running over you, Are you alright? Should I get the doctor? I should get the doctor"
He goes out for a drive, half an hour later he finds himself on an empty field right in the middle of nowhere. He walks around for a while, stops, looks up to the sky like he's about to say something but doesn't. He doesn't even know which way he's supposed to face when he prays to cas. He's not even in heaven.
I'm sorry for making you think like-"
Dee beams at him "of course young man" they go back to the dance floor.
"Uh..." he's never been interduced to a car before
"She was in the car. she's teaching Claire how to drive."
"Yup, don't take it personally though. Almost everyone here is a runaway."
Jerry slowly leads dee to the smal empty space between the tables. Cas's eyes go from them to the young couple slow dancing alongside them and then to dean looking overtly proud of himself for making this happen.
Cas smiled and dean could see it in his blue eyes too.
After Crowley joins his friends and dean goes to serve them cas demands another drink, most likely his last one for the night. His at that perfect stage between buzzed and drunk and he'd like to keep it that way. Dean poures himself one too which come to think of it is kind of unprofessional and unhealthy, how much does this man drink in a day?
"On the house"
"I know, I was there." His head hurts, his whole body hurts, he doesn't have the energy to be nice.
Walking out his front door he was surprised by the pleasant weather, that might make being resentful hard for him if he didn't concentrate. He remembers gabriel telling him about mean old men who yell at kids from their front porch and the chances of him becoming one before he even gets old.
"Dude I totally belive you" Claire says
He didn't know any words that could deliver all the emotions going wild inside of him at the moment. He doubted there were any.
It's small and if he was beig honest quite cozy, the blue theme of the place takes some of the tension he wasn't aware he still carried away.
"Uh, Well eileen and I just got back and we have pizza and pie. so get your ass back here before it's all gone.
Dean looked around, he wasn't really sure of that "just came out for a drive"
"You're not serious"
"And how do you plan on using that to get me a deal?" Cas was maybe impressed that dean would do that, Not a goody two shoes boring guy after all. Good
Cas let the 'getting you drunk' part slide. He still doesn't know if dean was interested in men or not.
He walks past the hippy cafe and into the bar. The place is bigger than the next door diner and has a brown and dark red theme. There's a pool table in the far end the walls are full of paintings, except one that is picture, wait isn't that...BABY?
This was his new start, he should take his time and actually start when he's ready (or absolutely has to). He could afford maybe a month or so of unemployed before he got anxious about his financial or mental situation. So getting himself a cup of coffee or as some (only he) calls it 'spicy blood' because its a necessity for staying alive he began to plan a day completely wasted by unproductive activities.
He closed his eyes and let the realization wash over him, He was wanted by dean.
"You're sorry?" Dean step back again with a chuckle "you died saving my ass, again, and you're sorry?"
"He has the hots for my uncle" Dean sayed with wicked giddiness "They had a thing back in the day, before he left for the big cities, made some crappy deals with some shady people, got himself in trouble and ran back here."
"Yeah, there was a second hand bookshop not far from here. the owner died couple of weeks ago I think it's in crowley's hand now, Don't really know how that happened but I think it would be perfect for you"
"My family" it's not a total lie "what did you run from?"
"Squirrel, how's business?" Crowley says as he approaches the bar
"Alright, thank you dean." He means it
"I am and I would like to leave now."
Dean laughs "true, but we are a close second. Come whatever, people need to get drunk. It's like therapy, except that it actually works."
"You didn't hav-"
"Mr.shurley!  fancy seeing you here. Are you settling in well?"
Cas said nothing
Perfect, that's exactly what he needed. Bunch of noosy old people watching everything he does. He hates this town already and so far it seems the feelings mutual.
"A dead guy's second hand bookshop will be perfect for me? I'm flattered."
"Alright" dean chuckles "This is my bar, the diner next door is my uncle's...actually he's more of a adopted father, he kinda took me and my brother in when we came here but that's a while other story. I was just helping around this morning because Kev was out of commission"
The old lady from the other booth calls the man over "dean honey can I get a glass of water?"
Fuck it actually sounds good. if only his family could see him now, drunk deciding to buy a bookstore. Gabe would have a field day, hannah might have a heart attack, Micheal would well who fucking cares what that fucker would think anymore? This is his life now, castiel the bookseller.
"Hey dean, where are you?"
"Hmm you remember Jerry from this morning?"
Right from paradise
"Just a few quick test and you'll be on your way mr...uh actually we didn't find any id on you"
"Excuse me?" His paranoia rises, his right hand ready to reach for the gun tucked at his back. Happy to not have made the same mistake as this morning and going out without it.
Morning again
"So Tell me cas, new start, new town, what are your plans?"
He's getting naive too if he's thinking the world is supposed to be fair.
There is an angry bark behind him as he's about to walk into the street, he freezes immediately trying not to ask himself "why does the universe hate me?" Because there are a lot of decent answers to that. but dogs? That's just being petty. It's not that cas hates dogs, really he tries to be friendly, it's the dogs that hate him. Always have
They stayed like that for a few seconds or minutes. Unable to part or to say anything.
"I'm the one who should be sorry, I was an idiot. And not even for the right reasons. I was just afraid and angry but yeah most of all an idiot"
"You were wrong thought" dean said and cas looked confused.
"Cas" sam half yelled and dean whispered.
"I'm sorry" cas said
Cas taks a swing at the drink and looks at dean expectedly.
"I KNOW RIGHT" Claire shouts again which doesn't help with his headache "I never liked that dog"
"I don't know"
"I think there are a lot of things you haven't told me yet"
"You're a good parent" cas's mouth says without waiting for permission from upstairs
Cas wanted to ask why would you do that but that would probably make things awkward so instead he asked dean for another drink. Dean obliged happily pouring himself one too.
He found his way back thanks to the gps thingy sam had forced him to get. They were waiting for him in the kitchen. it was nice, having peole wait for him at home.
......
"Nice to meet you Mr shurley i am doctor Alex Jones, Now how about we get this tests out of the way so you can get back to your life."
His heart stopped beating for a few seconds and then started pounding like it was making it's way out of his chest.
"I'm pretty sure he wanted to eat my soul" maybe he's being a little extra here, he doesn't care Duke looked evil enough.
Oh my darling, I love you so
Eyes still shut Dean pulled himself closer to cas and felt a hand wrapping around his shoulder. half convinced cas would be gone when he wakes up in the morning he let himself have this moment.
"So EVERYONE here is a runner?"
"Cas I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was such a fool.
"Yup, we're what you might call a tight community here"
"The sea ofcource. You come here, get a new start, fall in love, you make love to the sound of the waves, you watch the sunset with your lover and if the lawman comes for you, you sail away to the free world"
That was  not what dean had in mind although for a moment he considered it.
Cas opened his mouth to say "I'm an angel, I won't feel discomfort" but shut it immediately.
They all look at cas until he says "no, ofcource not"
"Whatever, look it wasn't her fault I ran into the street. "
"Yes?"
He picked up his toothbrush "this is your second chance, DO NOT MESS IT UP".
I know you're an angel
"Angel....angel" a soft 50s song starts playing from somewhere
So that was weird, nice but weird. Back to the real shitty world now thank you. Cas checks his phone, no calls or text, no work, no Micheal, no gabriel, no balthazar nothing.
Oddly enough cas believes him, not that he would actually confess but the genuineness in deans every move is awfully refreshing.
"cas?" The same voice he's been hearing all day says, he turns to look at dean standing BEHIND the bar.
"I suppose" there's still doubt in his voice
"Sorry?"
"Nothing yet, in weighting my options." He lies
Alright now what do people do to relax? He could find a gym and blow off some steam, watch a movie, find nick and put a bullet in his head for ruining his life, go for a run, furniture shopping, call gabe, find nick and put him in a meat grinder, listen to balthazar and go on a dating app, find nick and rip out his heart, check out the neighbourhood. There are just too many options.
"Okay first of all" he starts with a defensive posture "im not a cop or anything I can drink on the job if I want to but no" he ran a frustrated hand through his hair "today I guess...I was a little stressed out." He huffed "when the sheriff called and said Claire had an accident I...I don't know I just freaked." He gulped down his bourbon "guess I'm still a bit shaken up"
"Don't you dare touch that pie sam. I'm on my way."
"Yes let's put it that way, I'll talk to crowly tonight and let you know how it goes. Can you come around tomorrow? I'll either be here or at Bobby's"
Life yes he shohld get himself one of those. Dean gauids Claire out of the room while the doctor gets to work and sheriff mills starts asking questions. Apparently he's not the only one who wants this thing over as fast as possible.
Cas looked at him knowingly "it's alright dean, you need your four hours" he tried to make dean smile
"I saw more than enough today" now that he's into this he's going to commit mostly because its a simple truth "that girls clearly loves you dean, now I don't know a lot of teenagers personally but from what I understand that's not very common. You must be doing something right."
"So that's why dee's parents hated him"
"Uh actually..." The old man gestures towards himself,  Dean gives him a curious looks and gets closer so Jerry can whisper something in his ears.
"I'll think about it" he glances at crowley busy playing pool with his friends "are you sure he would sell? I don't know much about realstate but I'm fairly certain he ripped me off on the house."
Dean is getting old, it doesn't hit him suddenly like the aging spell did all those years ago. He notices it in the little stuff like how his back hurt alot more than it used to when he passes out drunk on a chair or more likely the floor, how his headaches the morning after are far worse and last longer.
"Start with why and HOW are you everywhere please" he said sitting on the stoll dean was pointing at.
"One hundred percent. told you, most people here are on the run." Dean responses with a satisfied smile
Dee looks confused "but it's not our anniversary we..."
"Here we are" dean pulls off in front of his house and he gets out.
He closed his eyes not knowing what else to do.
"You got your ears on angel?" His voice broke at last word
Dean and Claire jump out of their seats when they see him come out of his room.
The door opens before there's any chance for an awkward silence and a blond girl walks in.
"Pancakes" he said Starring at the green GOD so very green eyes "uh coffee, Black and pancakes please"
"Quit bein overdramatic, cast..ca..cas sorry I can't remember your name you ready to go?"
"Uh..you were in a car accident"
"Yeah He does that" dean sounded amused "I'm sure i can get him to give you a good deal, don't worry."
"What kind of skills do you have?"
"What?"
"I will" the angel replied and started to slowly Cares Dean's shoulder with his thumb.
"Castiel would you please get your ass on the bed?" Dean said as he kicked of his shoes.
"We have a small gym here, the owner is a friend" cas tries not to scoff at that  because ofcource he is " i don't think they have any available positions. still, I can talk to him. i bet we can find more options tho"
It was the fist time he'd said that name since he begged chuck to bring him back. It felt both strange and familiar on his lips.
Somehow he thinks 'i can kill everyone in this room in under five minutes without any weapons' isn't the answer dean's looking for.
Dean tugs at the edge of the familiar trench coat. Stealing his eyes once again from cas. He can't belive how much he'd actually missed the ugly thing.
"It's not fair" he thinks, why does he always have to watch the people he loves die.
"No argument there, we'll have the usual." He's about to follow the other two guys to table on the far end of the bar when he comes eye to eye with castiel.
Back in his room cas was standing still on the same spot. He had died making his peace with the fact that this day would never come. He knew it was only a small start, to be in the same room as dean while he slept, and knowing dean it would be rocky road but it was an start. Something he never thought would happen.
"Oh God please don't use your young lady voice I'm sorry"  she doesn't seem sorry but dean let's it slide.
"Dork" Claire coughs
After a while sam and Eileen, too exhausted from the hunt, said goodnight and went to bed.
"Not when there a huge bed with a memory foam mattress in the room"
"The only business that would never go out of st-"
"Hey you want some bacon on the side? Cause you know, Bacon makes everything better" the man said from behind the counter and although castiel doubted the truth behind those words he noded in agreement.
He thinks back on that night, cas being surrounded by the black goo and he feels his heart being squeezed by invisible hands in his chest.
"I thought I'd never see you again" dean said almost in a whisper before pulling cas back into a hug.
"Duke right, jody told me that too i don't know what happened man He's usually such a sweet dog."
"No?"
"I would like that." Cas replies.
"Is this some sort of a fever dream?" He asks only half joking
"Hey sammy" he tried to sound fine answering the call
"serving an special request for an special lady" dean says from behind the rusty computer and happily.
"I talked to Alex" dean says "paperwork's done. We can leave if you're ready." Aaaand ofcource he's on the first name bases with the doctor too. How is this place real?
It's not fair for the angel who was so good and kind and pure to be taken like that, covered in something dark. No cas was light.
"I don't know man but I get it, you had rough day. Come, sit, let me get you drunk and we can talk."
He's not saying hello to a cas no matter how hot the owner is. thankfully dean doesn't ask him to, they get into "baby" (God these people are weird). Dean asks him for his address and when he gives it to him he half expects dean to say he knew the previous owner too.
Cas looked up to it's owner and found the face to be equally inappropriate. Somethings better remain in fantasies and maybe strip clubs.
Cas isn't there...
"What do you want to do? Like what makes you happy?"
He picked a worn out black t-shirt he didn't even know he still had and jeans with some holes that didn't originally come with it. That should keep most people away, a voice in his head (that suspiciously sounds like balthazar) called him stupid for that but like most things said in that voice he elected to ignore it.
Not that he's gonna let it stop him from drinking, because frankly he doesn't know what else to do with himself.
Today he supposed should be different, a new day in a new town (where everyone was delightfully unaware of his existence, no one waiting for him, no one expecting anything from him) he was unknown and decided on keeping it that way as long as possible.
"Sorry... Claire... the girl who hit you, she's seventeen so the sherif called me to come. They're out there talking to your doctor now"
Cas blushed and dean laughed. Was this the happiness cas talked about? It felt like it.
He looked at dean blankly "part of me thinks this whole town is playing a prank on me"
"Have you now?" His third drink is in front of him.
"Yes, thank you for furnishing the house before I arrive" he hates most of it but he also knows interior design isn't a part of his vast skill set.
Sam looked just as startled, slow footsteps could be heard and none of them knew what to do.
Cas vaguely remembers a time in his life when that phrase was said enthusiastically by him and not spat out like the punch line of some cruel joke the universe kept playing on him.
"shurley, Castiel Shurley"
The dark, the thought of not seeing cas again tarnished every other feat he had. So he looked at him again, His best friend.
Dean rolls his eyes at him "look This place is full of old people, you're gonna have tons of customers AND you'll be surrounded by books which is freaking awesome. plus it's peaceful and you can have your privacy."
"May I have this dance with you miss?"
"You have a teenage daughter?" He said before he could stop himself.
"Sure but first, What's your poison?" Dean asked with charms of a bartender
"if you're going to get me drunk then surprised me" he doesn't necessarily likes surprises but he's curious what the man would offer him.
He wakes up with pain pretty in pretty much all over his body, the feeling is familiar and for a moment castiel thinks he's back at home the morning after finishing a difficult job. Then it all comes rushing back to him.
"That's exactly what I'm saying" dean downs his next drink and cas follows.
Finding he's way back to shoreline is easy, he's there just in time to watch the sunset. There's a cool breeze and for a moment cas feels calm.
Dean let himself get lost in the touch and warmth of the angel and slowly fell sleep.
"Maybe I'm here for business" he argues not wanting to admit dean was right for some reason. He did hate this shitty place.
Eating unhealthy lunch
"Come on, you're with me tonight."
The sound of the heavy bunker door open and close made him jump on his feet which by the way still hurt a little. Sam and Eileen followed his lead, weapons drawn.
"I remember. You were the handsomest guy in the room, I couldn't belive my luck"
"Including you?" He taste the bourbon on his tongue as he drags his eyes back to dean's. Fuck have they gotten greener?
"DUKE...COME HERE" A woman yells breathlessly running out the park.  cas and the dog both turn to look at her when a Laud hunk from somewhere brings the beast's attention back to being unnecessarily aggressive. It barks again coming closer making cas automatically run backwards to the street and the squeek of wheels on asphalt is the last thing he hears.
"No" how could he say that's too far away without sounding clingy WHICH HE WASN'T.
Shit how long was sam standing in the hallway behind them?
His head was somehow on cas's chest and one hand over his waist.
"You were there to support her when she needed you today, You listened to her and you didn't blame her for something that wasn't her fault. I know these all sound pretty estandard but you'd be surprised just how many parents fail at accomplishing them."
"Sure thing dee"
"Maybe I should try that sometime" he says instead.
He's face was red when he looked at it in the bathroom mirror.
The sound of his ringtone made him aware of his surroundings again, it was almost sunset and dean wondered how long has he been standing there cause his feet were hurting now.
"How would you do that?" He highly hopes what his messed up mind was imagining wasn't the case.
No end of the world situations he can throw himself into, not even any major hunts.
"PERFECT" dean half yells
We? How drunk is dean? How drunk is he to just sit and answer?
"But you're back now. And maybe we could...you know... slowly... I could show you... how I feel." He looks up to meet the Angel's eyes
"Do you want to walk home?"  Dean asks her calmly
Their happy faces, the good food and the music really make castiels plans on being annoyed with the world difficult. What in the 80s crappy sitcom is happening here? Kind of feels like he's intruding in a private moment, leaving money for the food and a generous tip on the table he sneaks out while everyone is busy pretending they're in a freaking musical.
“Uriel,” Cas greeted the other as he shook his hand.  “I need to get some things today for Dean,” Cas continued as he indicated Dean next to him.  “He’ll need a laptop and a cell phone.”
Cas frowned and shook his head at the memory.  He had brushed off a lot of things at the beginning now that he was thinking about it.
Cas leaned up and kissed him before laying down again, nose pressed to Dean’s neck.  Dean wrapped his arm around him, and pulled him close.
Dean went to protest but Gabe waved him away.  He looked at Cas who shrugged.
The semester picked up and Dean was busier than he had been.  Cas tried not to be frustrated, especially when Dean was so excited about his studies.  Cas used every opportunity he could to meet Dean on campus, even for an hour.  They spent hours in the coffee shop where they met, in the library together while Cas read and Dean studied, grabbing lunches and quick dinners together around campus at the different restaurants and delis.  Cas would always support Dean in everything he wanted, but Cas missed him.  He missed how the days flowed when he wasn’t in class and how free their time together was.  Cas knew that they still had another year before Dean graduated, but knowing the omega would come home to their home together every night soothed his alpha.
Dean felt weighted down by the sorrow and regret they shared.  He wiped the last of the tears away from both of their faces and pressed his lips to Cas’ in a reassuring kiss.  “I’m here with you now and forever.  I love you.  And I want to mate you and share my heat with you and only you for the rest of my life.”
“Hello Dean.”  Dean smiled back.  Something settled in him just by being near Cas.  Just by hearing his voice.  Dean pushed aside the worry about that and opened the door, letting Cas precede him inside.  They were greeted by a warm wall of air and they both breathed a sigh of relief as they walked further into the large entry.
Sam laughed.  “If you weren’t in la la land you’d have known I was here the whole time.”  Sam was sitting on the couch in the living room that was just off the foyer in their house.  He had a clear view of the hallway where Dean stood.
“Dean, would- “
“It’s about three o’clock.  Are you hungry?  I asked Ellen and Tessa to hold food for you because I didn’t want to wake you.  There is some bread and cheese here though,” he continued.  Cas cracked his eyes open when Dean placed his hand back on the bed.
“Alright.  Thanks, Pam.”
“Oh, uh, yea, sure.  I um, don’t want to hold you up.”  Dean leaned forward with his elbows on his knees.
“Alright, Dean, you’re ok,” Cas murmured.  Dean took a few deep breaths and listened to Cas’ soothing voice.  It wasn’t long before he drifted off again.
There was no question that Dean would have to talk to them when they got home for dinner.  He just wasn’t sure what he wanted.  Going through it alone was not something he thought would be wise.  He was used to having a real alpha now, so his fake knot that was hiding in the back of his armoire wouldn’t do anymore.
Cas took in his shaky hands he clasped around his knees and the blotchy skin that mirrored Dean’s stuttering breathing.  His scent was still laced with too many emotions, but Cas could also pick out the loneliness and fear in it.
Dean shook his head.  “Cas, no one has taken care of me like you do in general, but today…no one has ever done anything like this for me.  Thank you.”  He sighed and lightly tapped the card on his leg.  “I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about seeing someone myself.  The back and forth is getting to me, and everything you said is true.  I can see it clearly now, away from the situation, but last night was harder.”  He pursed his lips and studied the card again.  “I’ll give her a call tomorrow.”
Cas had had heats already, so he knew what it felt like to be filled with something, but he also knew that having a real live alpha would be better and he couldn’t wait.  He whined again and turned his head, baring his neck, hoping that Dean would see his submission and get on with it.  Dean’s answering growl satisfied Cas and before he knew it Dean’s finger was coated in his slick and had pressed into his tight channel.
As they came down the steps Cas could hear the murmur of voices getting louder.  Everyone had gathered already and were just waiting for the last, most important people.  There were several seats placed in the front close to the arch for the pack alphas and Sam and Eileen.  The rest of the party and the elders would be standing for the ceremony.  As the crowd saw them emerge a cheer went up to greet them.  Dean tightened his arm around Cas’ where it was threaded through his and Cas squeezed his bicep in return.  Dean didn’t falter as they made their way through the crowd and up to the arch.  Dean let him go and Cas took his place next to Mary in the line of people.  He saw Sam, Eileen, Alpha Bobby and Alpha Cain take seats at the front as well as his parents.
“You two staying for dinner?” he asked as he made his way over to the sink to wash his hands.
Cas watched them with half an eye while he wondered where Dean was and how he was doing.  He had been violently attacked and was hurt emotionally and physically.  He should be home, resting and being taken care of, not God knows where on the street.
“Well, turns out the pining sickness was pretty bad, but little pup here wasn’t making it easy on her Daddy either.  It was a pretty bad time, Cas.”  Dean gave him a sad smile, remembering how horrible it had been and regretting that it was, now, causing Cas pain to hear.
“What can I do?” Cas asked him.
He was glad though, that Dean wanted to go.  Ellen had come around a bit, but Cas knew she was still wary.  He wondered if she had hoped he would get himself together before only to be disappointed.  He hoped that she would give Dean more credit this time, but they would have to wait and see.  Cas was glad that Bobby had been able to talk to her, but he worried that Jo wasn’t coming around and that she might be hindering Ellen’s view of Dean.
His survival depended on Cas keeping his promise.
Dean didn’t have time to say anything before Cas had him with his legs wrapped around his waist and was walking into the den.  He set him on his feet and reached for his belt.
Cas nodded and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips.  “I want that too.  I need you too.”
Suddenly, the alpha withdrew and stood to his full height.  The look on his face scared Dean more than anything so far and he couldn’t catch his breath.  The red bled into his dad’s eyes and Dean’s stomach dropped.  He knew his father was about to make a decree as Pack Alpha.
Cas had quietly led Dean through the penthouse when they arrived.  He knew that Dean was looking around and taking everything in.  His scent was all over the place, but Cas remained calm.  He wanted Dean to be able to settle in and he knew that it would take some time.
He laced up the boots and headed outside.  The sun was still shining brightly in the sky and the air was warm.  He was comfortable in his shorts.  He waved silently to Jimmy on his way to the barn and Jimmy grinned at him and gave him a thumb’s up.
Cas silently decided that he would distract Dean and make sure that he was taken care of on the nights Jimmy went out with Amelia.  Dean tried to tell him again that he was fine, but Cas didn’t listen.
“I know,” Sam agreed.  “I just don’t know what else to do except try and keep doing what we’re doing.  I can be here some now.  School doesn’t start for another few weeks, so I can help too.  And I can come in the afternoons.  Dad doesn’t care what I do most of the time,” he said as he shrugged.
Gabe huffed and rolled his eyes.  “You’re a moron,” he told him.
Talking about his childhood was easy for Dean right now.  It was the events of the past six months that were excruciating to think about.  He was glad that Pam had stopped him and only asked him to discus is childhood.  He had another meeting with her in two days and he was a little worried about what she would ask him to talk about.  But for now, he needed to focus on Sam.
“I found Dean.”  He paused before he continued.  The look on her face showed that she was impressed with him but also interested.  “It’s complicated, Pam.”
, he thought.
“I’m sorry babe, I’ll call you later, ok?”  Cas did sound like he was sorry.  That made Dean feel a little better.  And besides, he wanted Cas to be happy.  He wanted Cas to make new friends.  He knew that Cas was going to meet people better than him.  He was going to meet omegas better than him.  Omegas that were small and delicate.  Omegas that had better manners and didn’t wear hand me down clothes.  Omegas who were Cas’ equals.  Dean knew that, was expecting that.  It’s why the pining sickness was so strong.  Dean was mourning his mate already.  He swallowed thickly before answering.
Dean nodded thoughtfully.  He knew it would be good for the pack and he knew that Sam was interested in a mate sooner than later.
“Yes alpha,” Dean purred.  He gave him a sultry look from under his lashes as he stopped in front of Cas.
“What?” Cas asked again.  He felt like a broken record but things were rearranging in his brain too quickly for him to keep up.
Dean liked the way he was treating him now.  He had been nothing but the doting alpha while they were at the hospital and Dean had soaked it up.  He wanted a life like that.
Dean growled and Cas stopped.  Dean was a little surprised at himself but he continued forward.  He stepped into Cas’ space and looked up at him seriously.  “Stop.  The police investigation is over.  Everything is fine now.”
She shrugged.  “I’ve helped omegas before, Dean.  I know how you’re feeling right now.”
Dr. Crowley frowned.  “Dean, the more you rest the arm the faster it will heal.  Now, I’m sure that you can find someone who could possibly help you while you’re healing,” he continued looking pointedly at Cas.
“You’re a sap,” Dean told him.
Dean snuggled back into his chest and sighed.  His scent rippled with relief.  “Thank you, alpha.”
Dean swallowed thickly, holding his mate gently as he began to relax.  He looked around the room at the others.  Naomi and Chuck were at the foot of the bed, much like they had been the night before.  Chuck’s eyes were streaming and red and he clung to his mate.  He felt sorry for them.  He could only guess at how hard this was on Cas’ parents.
Cas couldn’t contain his laughed at the incredulous look on his mate’s face.  He tried to cover his mouth but Dean turned his look to him.  “Are you laughing?” Dean asked.
Sam smiled and nodded slightly.  “I’m looking forward to it,” he told Dean.  “In fact, I’m really looking forward to it.  Her scent is amazing, Dean.  It’s like vanilla and orange and it’s sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  Some omegas just smell too sweet to me.”
His father smiled at him and pulled him in for a much warmer welcome than his mother’s.  Cas returned the hug, scenting his father and finding comfort in his familiar scent.  He wasn’t sure how his father was going to react but he could predict how the rest of the family would and he needed the calmed, settled feeling he got from his father.
Cas pulled one of his legs up and over his shoulder as he rolled his hips shallowly at first before he slowly began to increase the length and force of his thrusts.  Dean wrapped his other leg around his waist and pushed back, meeting Cas’ movements.
Cas smiled in satisfaction from the seat of his horse.  The clear May day was beautiful.  The sun shone brightly over the field they traveled and he sighed when he looked over to the snow-covered peaks in the distance.  The lowing of the cattle next to him and his twin’s bright smile across from him made all the hard work of the last year worth it.
Cas looked at him and Dean could see his face soften further.  “Why?  What made it so hard?  Didn’t you think about it before?”
“What are you doing here?” John demanded.
Dean thought about it.  “He tells me all the time that he loves me.  He’s affectionate no matter what.  He doesn’t withhold affection or attention if I haven’t done things perfectly.  If I cook dinner, he thanks me and tells me how much he appreciates it and enjoys it, but if I didn’t and we have sandwiches or whatever, it’s ok too.  He sleeps in my nest with me every night even though I keep giving him mixed signals.  And he noticed that I stole one of his shirts to put in my new nest and he changes it out with a new one every few days.”
“Thanks for coming, Sam,” Cas told him.  He closed the door behind the other alpha and they turned to see Dean.
“I should have realized it, Dean.  When I think about what the last four months have been like for you, it hurts me to think about what you went through.  I didn’t know how fearful you were.  And I’d like to say that if I had known, things would have been very different, but I’m not sure.  I know that I wouldn’t have wanted you to live in fear, and I would have tried to make that clear to you but I’m not sure I would have even been able to understand what it must have felt like for you to not know.”
He looked over to Cas, whose face was thunderous and he had to smile.  Cas was a sweetheart and could be the gentlest person on the planet.  Dean had seen it with his bees and experienced it himself.  He was generous and kind, and he was calm and peaceful.  But he could also be righteously angry and ruthless when it came to protecting the things he loved.  And he was pissed.
Dean chewed on his nail as he felt his throat close up and his stomach turn.  He reminded himself to keep breathing and stay calm.  He didn’t know what Cas was going to say, but he knew Cas was struggling with the approaching conversation.  Fear clutched his heart and he knew it was leaking into his scent.  He had wanted Cas to talk to him about what was going on, but now that it was here and his contract was on the table he wanted to be anywhere else.
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas asked from beside him.  Dean turned his face to his mate and his scent and expression must have told Cas something was wrong because he frowned slightly.
“I thought this was where we were headed,” Cas murmured as they broke through the clearing.  Dean chuckled.
“That’s what I’ve been doing.  I haven’t taken care of him the way I should have.  I thought he was okay.  I convinced myself that he was happy to be my mate and be secure but I didn’t realize that he needed more than money and a house.”
Cas had used condoms.  He didn’t want Dean’s pups.
“Cas, this is enough.  I can’t watch this again.  You’ve been doing this for almost a year now.  It’s not good for you.  You can’t keep living like this.”
“We’re going to keep you for observation tonight,” doctor Eden told him.  “The CT scan should be done any time now and they will take you down there when it’s ready. After that’s done you’ll be admitted into a room upstairs.”
Dean sat on his bed at the Omega Institute and looked at the pamphlets spread out on the thin blanket.  His eighteenth birthday had come and gone in January and it was now May.  He had to decide what he was going to do, and soon.  Omegas had six months after their eighteenth birthday to leave the omega house with a job or be forced out.  Dean didn’t know what to do. His options were limited and honestly, he was scared of being alone.  He had been within the shelter of the omega house for four years and he didn’t really know what to do otherwise.
He could scent the salty tears on his face but he could also scent the fear and pain and underneath it all was a thick layer of shame and guilt.  Cas couldn’t help but reach out and groom his hair while he watched his mate turn his face away and cry.
Cas’ nostrils flared.  Had Dean sought him out?  Did his omega need him as much as the alpha needed Dean?  He went to step forward to claim him when he blinked.  Dean had backed up and was talking about needing something.  Dean was leaving and Cas needed to stop him.
“You are not to go anywhere without an alpha escort, do you understand?” Dean told him seriously.
“Please?” Jimmy gave him a sad pout.  “Come on, it will make me feel better.”
“Are you ready to go?” Cas asked him.
He pressed their lips together again.  When he broke away Cas was smiling so wide Dean could see his gums.  Cas rarely smiled like that and it was a beautiful sight.  Dean thought his own smile probably mirrored it.  He inhaled the scent of lavender again and his eyelids fluttered shut.  He felt Cas’ hand land on his neck softly and opened his eyes.
“Love you, Cas,” Dean told him.
Medici’s was an upscale, local restaurant that was located downtown.  It was modern and popular but it was a place Dean would feel comfortable.  It was definitely a place Dean would go for a special occasion.
Instead he had a protective, possessive, hot alpha in his bed with his claim on his neck.  No matter what happened in the future, Dean knew that he and Cas would face it together.  Dean had learned that he needed to communicate more and let people help him.  He knew that they wanted to help him and it was a way to show their love.
Dean couldn’t do anything but nod once before he was pulled back under into slumber.
And he would have to leave Cas.  That thought alone made his stomach churn.
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Charlie exploded.  “I told you you needed to make this right with him.  What happened?  What is the matter with you?”
They didn’t need to talk much while they rode.  Dean just enjoyed the riding with Cas.  It was comfortable and relaxing and Dean found that every time they went out he fell more in love with the ranch.
“I wanted to wait until after we mated to tell the rest of my family.  I don’t want anything to happen and I want you and Emma to be secure when you meet them.  Some will be less pleased than others.”  Cas sighed, looking deep into Dean’s eyes.  “I’m sorry, I should have talked with you about this.  I just wanted to spare you from it.  I thought that if you brought it up I’d talk to you, but since you didn’t I didn’t think you were worried about it.  I’m sorry, I was wrong.  I should have just talked to you and I’ll remember that for the future.”
“Dean is my mate,” he finally said.  To his embarrassment his parents both burst into laughter.  Several heads turned in their direction and Cas felt himself flush again.  Cas tried to tug his arm away from his father but Chuck held on, composing himself.
Cas shook his head and he heard chuckling from the rest of the table.  He looked around to see the older adults smiling.  Only Sam looked a little confused, as if he too had never thought about it.
Overall it was a smooth labor and delivery.  Tessa was a calm, efficient nurse who helped both Dean and Cas through the process until Dr. Hanscum came in for the delivery.  At six oh four and six twenty-two, almost twelve hours after Dean’s labor started, they welcomed twin boys.
Dean agreed and that’s how he found himself sitting in the front room of an old house turned into office space downtown.  He was a little nervous but he felt comfortable in this setting.  It was almost like sitting in his grandparent’s house though he had checked in with a woman at a desk in the foyer.  He made himself comfortable on one of the micro suede couches and pulled up the Kindle app on his phone.  He had arrived a bit early to make sure he found the place and a space to park so he wouldn’t be late.
He smiled at them.  “Everything is ok.  We’ll go ahead and bring in the portable ultrasound so that you don’t have to move.”
You get another chapter because you waited so long last week!  Thank you all for reading! ❤️️
Cas pressed a kiss behind his ear.  “I’m fine, beloved,” he whispered.
“This is your home, Dean.  We want you to feel welcome here, comfortable here and love it so much you never want to leave,” Jimmy told him enthusiastically.  Dean chuckled.
Dean nodded and moved to take the pan off of the warmer.  “I made something for us to eat,” he told Cas while his back was turned.  He put one of the omelets on a plate and handed it to the alpha.
The alpha’s eye narrowed.  “Are you?” he asked.  Dean realized that he needed to be careful.  He didn’t need to be manhandled out of the building.  He couldn’t hurt his pup and he thought Cas would probably be furious with him if he caused a scene.
Cas had been right, though.  There were no direct shots of Dean, but they captured the fear and agony on Cas’ face clearly.  It hurt Dean to see those pictures the most.
“Dean, that’s bullshit,” Pam told him.  He looked at her shocked.  “It is
He bit his lip after he sent the texts and put his phone down.  He needed to get some studying done while he could.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas whispered.  Dean seemed reluctant to pull away, but he did and Cas watched as he strode over to his family and embraced them too. He looked to the three others standing close and saw them staring at him.  Cas blushed and excused himself.
“No.”
“I’m glad to see you two,” she said.
Dean kept his face buried in his alpha’s neck, chest to chest and relaxed, though he did chuckle.  Jimmy was like a tornado.  He closed his eyes again and sighed.  Cas’ arms tightened around him as he lifted his head.  Dean got the message that he didn’t want the omega to get up, but Cas didn’t know that Dean had no intention of moving at that moment.  Maybe ever.
“This is disgusting.  You’re not good enough to be anyone’s mate, Dean, let alone an alpha like Castiel Novak.  You’re nothing but a homeless, filthy whore.  He won’t want you and when he’s done with you, no one will take you, not even us.  And then-“
Cas slid back in bed behind him and pulled him into his side.  Dean’s head naturally fell on his chest and Cas ran his hands down his arms and pulled one of his legs over his stomach.  Dean sighed at the scent of his alpha and relaxed.  Dean was surprised that Cas wanted him to stay but he wouldn’t question it.  It felt good to lay in the alpha’s arms.
, bad, but Cas lit up like someone had flipped a switch on him.  His smile was wide and happy.  His scent lightened and the fresh smell of a summer day increased.  Dean wanted to roll over and bare himself for this man.
“Not yet, but that will be remedied shortly.  I wanted to talk to you first,” Cas told her.  “I didn’t want to just throw them out.”
“Amelia agreed to take care of these so that we could go for a ride,” he told him.
“Tomorrow,” she confirmed.  “If his scent has changed enough for you to pick up on it then he’s well on his way.  It will hit hard and fast, so we need to have a plan that is more than Gatorade and a fake knot.”  She ran her hands through her hair and blew out her breath.  Cas sat back down slowly.  “I’m going to go to the store and get you stocked up.  This should be five to seven days and it will be brutal.  His fever will be high and his cramping will be debilitating and he’s going to be emotional, Cas.  This is going to be hard for him mentally, too.  The first time you knot him is going to bring up memories he is sure to want to forget.”
Out in the parking lot, Cas was excited to see Baby again and ran a hand lovingly over her side as he walked around.  “I can’t believe there is a car seat in the back of the Imapla,” he says.  I think I might need a picture.”
Dean smiled at him and squeezed his hand where he still held it.  “I’ll take care of you, Cas.”
“Dean, I can smell the pining sickness.  Were you blood bonded or scent bonded?”
Dean growled and began thrusting, setting a harsh pace.  Cas could feel the flush rising from his chest up his neck and into his face.  Dean was pounding into him and Cas was helpless to do anything but hang on.  The force of the thrusting sent him onto his tip toes, ripping a cry of pleasure from his throat.
Cas huffed.  “Yes,” he told Dean.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said.  Cas raised Dean’s hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it.
“Right, I’ll just…” He trailed around as he glanced to the floor where the scraps of lace lay in tatters.
“What do you mean, what do I expect from you?” Cas asked him carefully.
Dean had gotten to his house before Cas and he was in the process of cleaning up and changing when he heard the door open and Cas called for him.  He sounded agitated and Dean pulled his shirt over his head so he could run down the stairs.
“What do you think, dad?” he asked his father.
“I’m sorry sweetheart,” Cas murmured as he spooned up behind Dean.  Dean let him gather him close and slip his arms around his belly and chest.
Charlie narrowed her eyes but followed them around the corner to the base of the stairs.  She put her hands on her hips and looked at them expectantly.  Dean bit his lip and shifted slightly so that he was closer to his mate.
“Dean, that’s not-“
“You’re welcome, Dean.  I-“  He sighed and swallowed and Dean was interested to see signs that his cool and commanding alpha was a little flustered.  “Well.  I have a few things to do in the shed before dinner, so I’m just going to go back out.  I just wanted to give you those.”
Dean nodded and Cas pulled him close to nuzzle him behind his ear.  Dean breathed in his scent and they stayed there for a moment as they calmed down together.  Cas pressed a kiss to his neck and pulled back.  He took his hand.
“Right, ok.  So, the good news is that my body was healthy enough again to have a heat.”  He saw Sam cringe slightly and took a little brotherly satisfaction at making him squirm.  He quickly stopped though, knowing that he would be even more uncomfortable in a minute.
“Want to care for Emma,” Cas finished for him.  “We’ll take care of her, Dean, don’t worry.”  As if Cas was going to let his family suffer any more than they had already.  His omega needed him.  His pup needed him.  He would do everything for them.
He took an involuntary step forward before his father tugged on his shirt.  Dean whined again and looked back to his alpha.  His father had a strange look on his face, but it cleared when he saw Dean looking at him.
Dean felt bad for the way Cas was feeling, but he would be lying if he said he wasn’t excited about a chase.  It wasn’t something that was done publicly any more.  It was mostly a fun time between mates when they wanted to reconnect their wolves together.
“This is how it’s going to work,” Dean began, letting his alpha bleed into his voice.  “Cas will hand me the traditional omega items, mom can stand in for the official Pack Omega, but no vow will be made or renewed.  Cas will take the vow when we mate.  It will default back to mom and things will continue to run as normal.”
Cas shook his head.  “I don’t know if he’s ready, even if I am.  I’m worried that I won’t be able to stop where he wants or if he asks.  My wolf just wants to take him.  And I’m very, very scared that I’ll mate him if I knot him.  The heat was excruciating and the mental damage it did to Dean when I bit the pillows and the sheets was significant.  Now that he’s pregnant I’m sure I won’t be able to knot him without biting him and then I’ve taken him against his will.”
Before he knew it, they were pulling up to a red carpet.  Cas put his phone in his pocket and waited for the attendant to open the door.  He stepped out and reached a hand back in to help Dean, a frown on his face.  Dean smiled at Cas in thanks, though he knew it was mostly for show.  Cas smiled back at him and even though he could see that it wasn’t a complete smile from his alpha, he was still reminded how handsome his mate was and Dean forgot he was frustrated.
“I just thought it would be nice to have a variety of things to choose from,” Cas told him, head in the fridge.
Cas silently changing the shirt in their nest every few days.
“Breathe with me now,” she continued in a soft voice.  Dean followed her and she smiled and nodded.  They did that for several breaths before Dean began to feel his self-control coming back.
“I don’t know,” Amelia said.  Cas turned his full attention to her and scented.  She was telling the truth and she looked as worried as he did.   “He was fine before.  We had a nice chat and made dinner together.  It seemed like everything was okay.  He went upstairs and I made dessert and then you came in to eat.”
“I love you,” Dean whispered.  It was the first time he had said it since he had come back.  The smiled that broke on Cas’ face at hearing those words would stay with Dean forever.
Dean sat with Cas while he laced up the boot.  It was cold, but not as cold as it was last night.  The temperatures were almost mild during the day compared to the nights.  Cas sighed in satisfaction and sat up.  He turned to Dean with a smile.
“Vic?”
Dean sighed a heavy put upon sigh.  “I guess she is.”
“Of course,” Kevin said with a sigh.  He moved past Dean and shouted down the hallway.  “Hey Charlie!  Get in here!”  He pulled his head back in and turned to Dean.
Dean could only nod silently.  Cas began typing on his phone and Dean took a moment to look at him while he was distracted.  Cas was already dressed for the day in a light grey suit with a dark grey button down, accented with a red tie.  He was intent and the firm line of his mouth told Dean he was determined to make this work today.
“I think you should be leaving, Gordon,” Dean told him.  His face was set and his scent was radiating his irritation and anger at the beta.  Gordon held Dean’s gaze for a moment and Cas was afraid he would challenge Dean.  Finally, he nodded once and turned to walk away.
Cas returned for lunch and seemed to be happier all around.  He scented the air when he walked into the kitchen and Dean smiled at him.  Lunch passed easily and after Cas left Jimmy pulled him upstairs where he kept him for a long while.  Dean thought it was a good thing he didn’t have much to do that afternoon.
The relief coming from the alpha nearly bowled Dean over.  He frowned.
In the end Cas stayed in Massachusetts for that week, working on getting settled into the apartment the internship provided for him and working out a new routine that was shockingly similar to the previous one.
“I’ll be back in a few minutes.  Just get that on and nothing else.”  She winked at him and closed the door behind her.
“She is, but if it makes you uncomfortable, you’re my mate, I’ll do what you want.”
“Do you have a preference of what I wear?” he asked.  He knew that some alphas had specific requirements for their house omegas.  Anything from a uniform to only dresses so they had easy access to knotting.
“Sammy?” Dean croaked, looking at him.
He already didn’t want to go to dinner and now his brother would be there to make everything one hundred times worse.  Hopefully Jess would be there because she was usually an ally, regardless.
He turned back around to find both Cas and Jimmy watching him.  “Ok, who takes coffee and how?” he asked.
“Just try and rest, we’ll be there in a minute.”
Dean leaned his head back against the wall of the bathroom and closed his eyes.  He breathed slowly and carefully.  He thought he was ok and opened his eyes to find Cas’ watchful gaze on him.  Dean smiled slightly.
“Why did you think I would take Emma away?  That was your first reaction.  I could smell the fear on you.  That’s what made me get control.  I’m sorry that I scared you.  I was shocked.”  Dean could see the regret on Cas’ face.
Cas stilled and his brows slammed down.  “Charlie, I’m working.  Dean is better off resting at the table.”
“I said sit down,” he thundered.  Dean was slightly mollified to see that his brother felt intimidated enough to do as Cas said.  “I’ve had enough.  Most of you here should be ashamed of yourselves.  There is a very small number of people who have been there for Dean this past year and the rest of you should be ashamed of yourselves for the way you have acted.  Your treatment of Dean is unforgivable.
“Becky can be overzealous sometimes, but it’s always well intentioned,” Cas told him.
Cas took his hand and smiled.  “It’s perfect, Dean.  You did a wonderful job, thank you.”
“Nice to meet you,” Dr. Mills replied.  “Ok, Dean, let’s see what we’ve got.”  She sat on the stool and rolled forward to meet him.  She took a look at him.  She stared at him for so long Dean began to squirm.  She took a deep breath before she spoke.  “Tell me, Dean, how are things?”  She phrased it as a question, but Dean could tell she already could see how things were going.  He didn’t have the strength to put up a front or joke his way through this conversation.  That alone made him a little scared.
Dean didn’t have to think about it, but he was having a hard time accepting it.  “Like my brother.”
“Weeeelll,” Jimmy started.  He paused, clearly not knowing what to say.  He glanced at his twin, who was also sitting stiffly on his chair, a guarded look on his face.
“The house will be empty for a bit, but I think Jimmy is going to ask Amelia to mate soon,” Cas told him.  Dean was grateful to Cas for ignoring his slip.
Cas nodded and patted Dean’s hip.  Dean stood and gathered their plate to take to the sink.  Both alphas headed out to the field to tend to the cattle and Dean watched for them to return as he put away the meal and did the dishes.  He got most of the items away before he heard Jimmy in the chicken coop.
Though Dean was healing he was still struggling.  His body was working on itself and he was working on his mind and emotions.  He was using the breathing techniques and reassuring himself with his routine and regular comforts.  Cas had been a great resource for him, too.
Dean turned to him in surprise.  “What do you mean about me?” he asked.
Dean is a wonderful man who has done a lot of work to heal and move past his trauma but you have been too caught up in the past actions to notice.  Instead of letting him self-destruct you should have stepped up to help him.  The fact that none of you noticed that he was struggling so badly speaks very poorly of those of you who he calls family.
Dean hummed again as he watched Cas get dressed.  “Are you coming, Dean?” Cas asked him smiling.
Cas hated to see his omega in such distress.  There was nothing he could do about this unless he walked away from his pack and neither he nor Dean wanted that.  Cas thought he was a pretty liberal and modern alpha, but he was ashamed to realize that he hadn’t really thought about the practice of the reverse dowry before.  This was another truth of his privilege that he had to face.  He was the one who had put the price on the contract his mother offered for Dean.  He had wanted to offer a high amount so that Winchester wouldn’t refuse but he hadn’t thought about what message that might or might not send to Dean.
“Thank you for coming, Tessa,” Dean told her.  “Cas over did it tonight going down to the pyre and he’s in a lot of pain.”
“Mom called me.  She couldn’t believe it either.  Apparently, Dean got over whatever he was upset about and finally called her back.”  He scoffed in disgust.  “What kind of a son ignores his parents calls for two weeks?  It’s so childish.”
He looked up to smile at Cas and caught sight of his expression.  Dean sniffed slightly and didn’t find anything off about the alpha, but he was stony faced and Dean didn’t like it.  He squeezed the alpha’s hand where he still held it and Cas blinked before he looked down at Dean.
Dean laughed and nodded.  He sighed a happy sigh and realized that something was off.  His brain began to work and he realized that he didn’t know Charlie was crying until he felt her shaking a bit.  And he couldn’t smell her.  He took another breath and narrowed his eyes at her.
“Dean, what can I do?  I do want you, more than anything.  I love you.  That won’t change.”
Victor stayed in the hospital overnight and then his sister brought him back to the cabin where she stayed with him for another week, until she was satisfied that he was going to be fine with just Benny.  Dean packed up food each day and brought it down to him to make sure he had what he needed while he was still slowly moving around.
Cas pulled him to his mouth again but this time the urgency was gone.  It was replaced with slow and sweet licks of tongue, gentle caresses of his hip and jaw with Cas’ hands and Dean mewled.
“How many times did Cas knot you?” he asked him.
“Ok, well, knowing the dates are good.  We can predict when you’ll be delivering.  Right now it looks like the end of May.”  Dean absorbed this new information.  Ok, well, maybe he could make this year work still.  He could take classes in the spring and then deliver the pup.  After that though, he had no idea.  “Now,” Dr. Mills continued as she opened a drawer.  She withdrew several brochures and handed them to Dean.  These are all the options available for you right now.  I would suggest that you take these with you and look them over before you decide anything.”
Cas shook his head and shifted closer to him.  “You’re not damaged, Dean.  This is a horrible situation and I’m so sorry for it, but I won’t leave you to suffer if I can help you.”
He looked so innocent and fresh.  Cas couldn’t wait until he got his hands on him, but overall, he was glad that Dean would be there in general.  He knew that in addition to the relief he would provide his body, Dean would help with the chores and the house and be a genuine companion.
Charlie nodded once and clapped her hands together.  “Good, then that’s settled.  Let’s see what else there is to do.”
“Dad!” Cas was shocked that his father thought so little of his and Dean’s restraint.  “I would never break the rules.  That would have lots of consequences, not only for me and Dean but the pack too!”
“I was worried something was wrong, but I’m guessing that’s not the reason you’re home early,” Dean said breathlessly.
“Hello, Crowley,” Cas greeted the other alpha.
Cas looked at him in confusion for a moment.  He took another look around the restaurant and then back to Dean.  “I don’t know, honestly,” he said.  “I bought the penthouse because it fit my budget and I wanted a nice view.  I wanted something completely different from where I was moving from.  I hired a decorator and that was that.”  He shrugged.
Jimmy was an enthusiastic lover and though it was different from Cas’ intensity, Dean still enjoyed it.  Jimmy wanted him to come whenever he was ready and be an active participant in their activities.  It didn’t take him long to knot Dean for the first time.
She paused and looked at Dean before continuing.
“I know, Sammy.  I just don’t know how to be anything else right now.  And I hate that because I have the best thing in the word sitting in the back seat right now.”  Dean shook his head at himself.
“Alpha Novak, Omega Novak,” Doctor Milton greeted them when she came inside the room.  She smiled softly at them.  “I’m glad to see you’re connecting well.”
“Anything we discuss in here stays private, Castiel.  I would not have agreed to meet with you otherwise.  What can I help with?”
He couldn’t decide what to do and it was making him crazy.
He and Dean had gotten more and more comfortable with each other.  The morning that Cas woke to Dean’s distressed scent and the sound of his whine, Cas was immediately sent into protective mode.  He had pulled Dean closer and soothed him with his scent.  He had let Dean work through whatever he needed and tried to stay strong for him.
Cas must have fallen asleep there because he was jolted out of his dreams by a scream.  He launched himself up and was down the hall and through Dean’s door before he registered what he was doing.  The scent of fear and helplessness was heavy in the room and he saw Dean curled in on himself on the bed whimpering.
When Jimmy pulled away he made sure that Dean was looking at him before he spoke.  Dean was a little surprised because he had never heard Jimmy use his alpha voice before, but it came out strong and clear.
“You did a good job tonight, son,” Rufus said.  “John was once a good alpha, but he hasn’t been for a long time, we just didn’t know what to do about it.”
“It’s alright, Dean.  Everything will be fine and I’ll make sure that you’re able to come into your home.”
Cas nodded, a pang in his chest, regret clouding his scent.  “I should have, Gabe.  I should have never left in the first place, but when I did I should have tried harder.” He ran a hand through his hair.  “Christ, Gabe.  When I saw him for the first time- it was like nothing had changed.  Everything was still the same.  And-“ he broke off taking a breath before continuing.  It hurt him to be reminded of how much Dean had suffered while he was enjoying all the comforts of his high status.  He looked back at his brother.  “When I first came back and saw him, I thought he had had a mate that died.”  Cas looked right into Gabe’s eyes and he could tell that the older man understood his meaning.  He let out a low whistle.
“Maybe she just wants to help,” Cas suggested.
“Alright alpha, thank you,” Tessa murmured soothingly.  “We are going to take good care of your mate.  You got him here as quickly as you could and we are going to help him, ok Dean?”
Dean thought
“How are you feeling, Cas?” Tessa asked.  She had sat on the edge of the bed and was carefully looking over him.
The omega was taller than Gabe by a good foot at least.  He had brown hair and eyes that matched and he held himself with confidence and ease.
“We are very pleased,” he agreed.  “You are everything we hoped for, Dean, but there are a few things that have come to my attention in the last several hours that I want to address before any more time passes.  You have done nothing wrong, do you understand?”
When they got back to the house Dean started on dinner.  He had thrown some chicken in the crockpot before they left, so it would be nice and tender when it was ready at six-thirty.  He seasoned some potatoes and put them on a pan to put in the oven and threw together a salad.  That would be plenty for Sam and if their dad wanted to eat too.  Sam would be able to put the potatoes in the oven at six if Dean left him directions.
“I think there are those who would take advantage of the fact that the Pack Alpha is not as strong as usual and the future Pack Alpha has a true mate he hasn’t claimed yet.”  Dean looked to his father and Cas’ mother for confirmation.  The grim looks on their faces convinced Cas more than their nods.
“Sure thing,” Benny told him.  Dean didn’t respond as he turned and made his way into the house.  He was grateful that there was no one inside as he slowly walked upstairs to his room.  He took off his apron and balled it up in his fists as he sat down on the edge of the bed.
Dean smiled brightly at him and let his happiness with Cas wash over him to help smooth out his scent.  “Everything is fine, Cas, thank you.  I had a great time all day and this is nice.  The barn is beautiful and I have missed dancing.  It was one thing we did at the omega institute often.”
“I know, sweet omega, I can’t believe it either.  I’m so glad though.”
Dean shuddered at the commands and suddenly felt tears prick his eyes.  He blinked rapidly and Jimmy’s face transformed from fierce to concerned at Dean’s expression and scent.  To have autonomy over his body was something that not a lot of omegas had and he was relieved and grateful for it.
“I know.  I’ll see if Ellen or Sam can pick up Emma and you can meet me there.  I scheduled the meeting so you could have your first day back without leaving early.  But, I’m worried that you’re going to overtax yourself.”  Cas scent showed his concern and he stroked his thumb over where their hands were still joined on the table.  “I know that you want to get back to your routine, and I don’t blame you, but I also don’t want you to push yourself.”
The following week life had gone back to normal.  Cas officially moved in, which just consisted of moving two or three boxes of items and the rest of his clothes to Dean’s house.  Dean’s satisfaction when he saw their clothes together in the closet was palpable.
“Dean!  What’s up, I’m so glad you called,” Charlie’s perpetually cheerful voice filled the line.  Dean found himself smiling at her greeting.
“Heya Cas,” Dean greeted him as he stepped back, gesturing for him to come inside.
“It looks different,” he commented.  “I like it this way.”
Cas’ brows pinched together and his frown deepened.  Dean put the salad forks down and looked at him curiously.
“Pants.  Off.”  Cas commanded.  Dean scrambled to comply and before he could think he was on Cas’ lap again, sitting on the couch, impaled on his cock.  Cas pulled Dean’ shirt off so he was completely naked and in no time they were locked together, both sated.  Dean leaned forward and rested against Cas’ chest, breathing heavily.  He closed his eyes as Cas’ hands stroked up and down his back and he waited for his knot to go down.
“Of course, Alpha, anything,” she responded.
Joy spread through Cas at these words and he quickly kissed Dean again before nodding.  Dean helped him up into the saddle and they made their way back into the castle.
“Oh, well, guess that means that we weren’t bonded that well.”  He pushed away from the table and put his bowl in the sink, suddenly not hungry anymore.
“Cas.” Dean cut him off with a desperate tone. Because he couldn’t do this. He couldn’t have Cas go down this path, not when his choice was taken away, again. Not when he was a human because Dean told him to fight, forced him to get them both out of there, no matter what the cost. He shook his head, meeting Cas’s wide eyes. “Cas, I’m so sorry.”
“Oh. Well, that explains a lot.” Dean adjusts his hand in Cas’, their fingers interlocking tighter. Cas doesn’t mention that they probably could let go at this point; Dean doesn’t either.
Jack shifted his weight from foot to foot. “If you were to go to the Empty, into that universe, you’d die. So I… I can get your consciousness into the Empty. Remake a body for you.”
Dean grabs his gun from the table, the barrel scraping against the table. He pockets it under his waistband. “Should have been there,” he bites out. “Should have been down here with him, shouldn’t have let him leave the room in the first place.”
“He doesn’t blame you, Dean,” Sam said.
Dean returns his gaze steadily. "What wouldn't have happened, Cas?"
“No, don’t feel guilty or anything, it’s just—I just meant that things seem different with you. In a good way. And what I’m saying is… that I’m trying too, okay? You’ve changed, and you seem better. And I’m trying to get there too.”
As always, please let me know what you think. :) you guys are so awesome, how you're sticking with this story and giving me such great feedback. thank you thank you thank you
Sliding into the passenger seat, Cas puts his backpack on his lap, glancing in Dean’s direction. He smiles; Dean returns it, feeling the tight feeling in his stomach loosen.
Castiel’s inner voice screams,
“Hurts,” Dean grits out through clenched teeth. He raises a hand and clumsily gestures to his chest. “Here.”
Cas crossed his arms. Nodded. “I wish we could have kept him at Jody’s. Flying here just exhausted him more.”
“Rabbit food,” Dean emphasizes. Castiel can feel Dean’s careful fingers pick his glasses off his cheek and set them on the bedside table. He can feel the weight of the mattress sag with Dean’s weight as he sits on the edge.
Castiel opens his eyes, and his voice comes deep from his throat as he groans.
“Okay, okay. Geez.”
at the end of this chapter
if you wanna come scream at me,
He realized his mistake as the dust cleared. His reply, too harsh and a beat too late, caused Sam to turn his worried eyes on him.
(See the end of the chapter for
It turns its head toward Sam. Dean’s legs twitch with the urge to put himself between the monster and his brother.
Dean crouches before him, arm propped on one knee. “Cas, what the hell? You were out there all night?”
“I understand what you mean.” Cas takes the book back, tapping it thoughtfully. “It takes me multiple reads to find the meaning in a sentence of his.”
Dean would tell him to go get a life, but since he would do the exact same thing if Sam were in his position, he turns a blind eye to it.
“Guys,” he says breathlessly. They both turn to him. “Guys, I know who my secret admirer is.”
“You’re not going to—“ With a hesitant glance around the empty hallway, Anna hushes her voice to a whisper. “You’re not going to tell her about your feelings for Dean, are you?”
Sam sighs. “You really underestimate people's abilities to take care of themselves, don't you? Speaking of which, how was Dad when you saw him yesterday?”
Dean counts the hours, as they go by. Counts them as he wanders the neighborhood in the middle of the night, looking for any clues as to where Faith could have taken Cas. Counts them as he canvases the neighborhood at first light, asking if they’ve seen either Cas or Faith, ignoring their questions of concern. He watches the hours tick by in the top right corner of his laptop screen as he researches anything in the hunter’s databases and chat channels, anything that could indicate what species Faith is.
“What’s that?” Sam asked distractedly, eyes scanning his laptop screen.
“Yeah.” Dean blinked out of his thoughts, turning to the screen. “Fine.”
Sam climbed out of bed and sat on Dean’s, giving it a bounce. “You can tell me. I’m your brother.”
-Thoreau, Walden
“Damn it,” Dean says to the deserted library, head in his hands.
Cas grumbles a curse, sounding distinctly like Enochian, pocketing his knife. “I don’t trust her.”
“I am perfectly capable of telling you my opinion without shouting,” Castiel says after a blessed sip of coffee.
“I’m not.”
Dean grinded his teeth. “We didn’t do a funeral because he’s not dead. I can get him back.”
“Okay, fine. Let’s say you screwed it up. What are you going to do, leave again? Because you
Dean wasn’t complaining—at first. The small cafe tucked into an only marginally larger quiet town never gets a lot of excitement. At first the notes were cute. He has a whole drawer for them in his desk, next to the receipts.
Shrugging, Cas says vaguely, “Dean knows more about it than I do. He…” He stops, frowning down at the ground. “He organized the trip.”
“I just need to try, Sam, okay?” Dean said into his shoulder, grabbing Sam’s jacket like a lifeline. “I need to try.”
Death’s haunted him before. But not like this.
“Got me, man. And I’ve never seen a coroner’s report say “maybe” on a cause of death—usually it’s definitive, or unknown.”
Cas looked up at Dean, eyes wide. “You…”
Dean takes to reading in his car during his breaks after that.
“Oh, lovely,” the woman titters.
to you.”
Dean winces. “Cas, I’m really sorry about—”
“Okay?”
“Makes sense,” Dean says. He taps the papers beside him. “That info checks out; all the victims before this were either not very well-known and married, or recently divorced. Whoever is doing this is targeting people that wouldn’t be missed very quickly.”
Cas’ expression hardens. He looks straight ahead. “Oh.”
?” Dean all but shouts.
There’s a moment of paralyzing, freezing-in-his-veins fear after he opens the door. Dean is on the ground, sprawled and unmoving, the silver knife on the ground next to him.
“Well can you blame him for doin’ it, when you had a gun to his partner’s head?”
“He told me he loved me,” Dean said. The words fell swiftly, like a hammer on iron. Vocalizing them just ripped the hole in his chest wider. “When he made that deal with the Empty to save Jack… it said that it’d take him when Cas felt happiness. Real happiness. And he told me…” He cut off, gritting his jaw.
Cas momentarily closes his eyes against the jolt of panic. He turns to Faith, who is standing with a glass of water in her hand.
“Dean,” he says firmly, attempting to remain as blank and impartial as possible. He turns to face his friend. “Please, forgive me for my actions. It was a long few days and I’m tired. I’m not thinking clearly.”
Like a shot out of a gun, he whips around and bolts through the revolving doors. He holds the phone to his ear like a lifeline with one hand, pushing people out of the way with the other. “Dean, hang on!” he shouts into the phone. “I’m coming, just hang on! Call the police, tell them to come to office 202!” he barks at the bewildered doorman as he sprints by.
“Definitely the latter,” Cas says with a nod.
Cas’s shoulders squared as he fell into his familiar determined look. He shook his head firmly. “It’s too much of a gamble. If you leave now, you’ll live. Jack can repair the tear, and you can live.”
“We don’t know
to feel something, eventually, if I wasn’t so resistant to the idea.” He fights a grin when he thinks about all the times Cas threw out snarky comments about Dean’s ‘insufferable stubbornness’.
Dean gives Cas a horrified look. “Uh—”
“Why the hell would I do that?”
“Colloquialisms, Cas,” Dean says shortly. He stabs a sausage link and savagely chews it, pointing his fork in Sam’s direction. “I got a rule and you know that. I don’t double-dip. Comes with the job.”
,” Dean snapped.
The Empty chuckled lightly. It struck a quick hand across Gabriel’s face, droplets of black substance flying to the side. “It seems as if both of you have some memory loss related to this whole situation.” It pointed a hard finger at Dean. “You and your angel’s freak son bombed me and woke everyone up in here, so I had to do the only thing I could: get them out, and have some peace and damn quiet.”
(trust me, it'll make sense;))
There is a tense electricity in their shared glares as they stare each other down.
was stagnant. A dead-end. Sometimes I feel like he’s right to think that.”
May hooks a thumb over her shoulder. “Whole neighborhood will be here in 5 minutes, guarantee you. It’s a tradition for everyone to get sloshed on Bloody Marys before coming to watch the game tipsy.”
“Okay, okay. I’ll quit it with the socks.” Dean spots a few large rocks on the creek’s beside. “We can go over there? Probably cooler by the water, too.”
Castiel blinks at the girl standing to the left of the table; he hadn’t even noticed her approach. “Yes,” he responds, nodding his head in greeting. “I’m assuming you’re Sam’s soulmate?”
I hope you enjoyed the chapter, and I would love to hear your thoughts!! Your comments are what I munch on with my morning oatmeal. <3
the one that pushed me into this date. This is your job that you’re trying to succeed at. And I’m trying to tell you that you
It’s the dreams that are good, but impossible. It’s the dreams of him visiting Sam and Jess and their huge and happy family, of being able to play-wrestle with Sam’s dusty-blonde, perky kids in his huge backyard.
“I know every
“And you’re sure it’s still there?” one of the boys asked in a not-subtle whisper. His friend jabbed him in the side, shushing him. “
Nodding, Sam accepted it. “Okay. What else?”
That makes Cas chuckle unexpectedly. “I’ve never held my liquor well.”
“Dean,” Sam said softly. He laid a gentle hand on his brother’s shoulder.
Two limbs shoot through the air, straight for them. Sam and Dean move as one, rolling out of the way to avoid them. Dean hisses in pain when a streak of the black crap plasters on his skin.
“What do I want?”
Cas stops. How can he explain the helplessness he felt seeing Dean with a gun to his head, when just a mere year ago, he could have blasted Dean’s attacker across the room with a single glare? How he can’t even offer anything to heal Dean with now but a bag of frozen vegetables?
Sam rolled his eyes toward the garage ceiling. “
The last time Castiel disappeared for only two nights, Dean was sick with worry. Castiel remembers this now. He should have remembered it earlier.
“My aim is to improve your quality of life, not worsen it.”
to describe his emotions to Dean. That would be giving more attention to the emotions, and thus a greater likelihood of them overwhelming Castiel. “I have nothing to say.”
on his lap, legs tucked underneath him, when he hears the front door open.
sorry this took so long, and it's so short! somethin' angsty to tide you guys over until I update again - which will be next week, i'm hoping:)
“Fine.” Dean takes off toward the kitchen, grumbling.
Despite hearing the telltale rumble of the Impala’s old engine before it even rounded the corner, Cas’ stomach still does wild flips as he sees the sleek black car come into view.
Cas nods. “Good, that’s… good.” The fight leaving his shoulders, he lets Dean guide him upstairs.
“Well, according to you, you ain’t much of an angel anymore anyway.” Dean pulls out a bottle of Jim Beam (Black label, none of that cheap shit) from the bottom cupboard.
“Sure.” Dean scoots past him to go back to his desk; pauses. “It isn’t a gardening book, by the way.”
During the first hour that he is alone, Castiel reads the book in its entirety. His fingertips brush across Dean’s scribbled notes where he wrote in the margins of the pages, almost smiling at the cleverness of Dean’s observations. Dean had even written a paragraph-long hypothesis of why Vonnegut ended the entire novel with such a senseless question posed in a made-up language.
“We’ve been hunting this monster a hell of a lot longer than you,” May says, pushing off the wall. “We know how it operates.”
thank you so much for reading, everyone. seriously. and giving your feedback... it makes my day.
“I realize that. But we have more questions than answers at the moment. Researching is one thing, but if we don’t know what this monster even looks like, it’s hard to judge what it is.”
Dean faces the birch and clenches his jaw until the point of pain. Cas hasn’t been able to catch a break since he got saddled with Dean. First, he treated Cas like shit. Then, Cas was unlucky enough to have to watch Dean teach every day, instead of doing something useful with his time. Sure, it’s Cas’ job—but he probably didn’t expect to have to babysit a human with a shitty home life and an inability to connect with his own soulmate.
Castiel dashes into the stairwell he used earlier to leave. As he begins sprinting up the stairs, he hears the grunts and thuds he heard over the phone become a reality.
Cas shoots his gun. The bullet hits Faith in the chest but she doesn’t go down. Instead she holds her hands out, arms growing to an unnatural length. One grabs Cas by the throat. With a shout, Dean wildly unloads his chamber into her center mass. She barely stumbles backward.
“Since I had to,” Cas responds firmly. Dean’s jaw snaps shut.
“I didn’t even know you were married, honestly. I never would have guessed it.”
Anna frowns at him, seemingly considering his words. She lays a gentle hand over Castiel’s. “Castiel… are you sure that Naomi will ever give those memories back or let you near Claire again? Even if you were to complete dozens of successful missions?”
“Strange?” Dean scoffs. “Cas, buddy, in human speak we call this a bad mood.”
“Because you and I both know that Cas is still getting used to this whole human thing, and he may not be… that great of a hunter yet. He needs the help.”
” Cas shook him, jolted him awake. “I can’t heal you with my grace alone. You need to let me possess you; let me in so I can heal you intrinsically, so I can—”
Dean nods with a sigh. “That does sound like some Cas-like bullshit.” He tries to find more information in Charlie’s face, and when he finds none, he says, “Can you promise me it’s nothing serious?”
With a grin, she wipes a trail of blood on her face with the back of her hand. “I’d hoped you had more respect for me than that, Castiel,” she says. “I put you into your little bad memories cage once, I can put you back there again. I know you have plenty of shit that I can feed on.”
“No,” Eileen said, shaking her head decidedly.
He’s met with silence, so Dean just stands there awkward and stiff at the door. Maybe this is some sacred angel time that he shouldn’t be interrupting, or—something. “Uh.” He clears his throat and tries again, “I just wanted to make sure you were okay, but I’ll leave you alone. Sorry, man.”
Sandwich finished, Dean turns to dump it on the table in front of Cas; he freezes when he sees Cas looking at the papers spread across the kitchen table.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes and said, with a completely straight face, “That’s the only reason I can see as to why she would put herself and everyone else on the highway in danger. A desperate need to urinate.”
“We’re friends,” Charlie shrugs. “And I lead a dangerous lifestyle. Teaching art to elementary kids has its hazards, ya know.”
He grabs Cas into a hug; puts a hand against the back of his neck. Feels him alive and breathing against him. “You’re okay?”
He remembered the explosion, and the pain as something hard and crystalized formed around him, keeping him together, keeping his grace from doing more damage, keeping him from—
“Him getting drunk off his ass and doing something stupid?” Dean scoffs. “Of course. Plenty of times.”
“Cloudless and sunny forecast,” Cas reminds him.
A moment later, Castiel can hear Dean’s obnoxiously loud car start in the driveway and pull away from the house. After begrudgingly locking the front door, he stands on the doorstep and watches Dean’s black car amble down the road. Castiel uses what little grace he has left to transport himself to the backseat of Dean’s car.
Cas’ voice isn’t loud, but it cuts into the ringing tone Dean hears in both his ears. He lowers the phone, walking to where Cas stands. He notices, as he approaches, the deep-red burns on Cas’ neck that mingles with the remaining black liquid clinging to Cas’ skin. It’s enough to make him stare dumbfoundedly, the goddamn ringing cell phone tone in his ears, not looking away until Cas says his name again and points toward the ground.
They bump into the medical examiner on their way out of the building. “We have all we need,” Cas says politely, scurrying past him as Dean blows ahead.
“Yeah, I’m sure you will, smartass.” Dean rolled his eyes as Cas took a prim sip of coffee.
Tears begin to spill from his eyes—another human physiological response that he can’t control anymore. He turns his face away from Dean’s, but still sees Dean’s face twists into something unreadable. Castiel feels Dean release his hand, hears Dean whispering, “God, Cas, I’m so sorry…”
