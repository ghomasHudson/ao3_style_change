"Jesus, Rhodey!"Tony pushes away from the counter and Rhodey sees it coming, moving out of the way, watching as Tony starts his pacing around the apartment, his hands smoothing roughly over his face, his chin, pulling down his cheeks as he groans."Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
Cautiously - mostly because he doesn't want to be spotted by a doctor or nurse that could escort him out of the building - Steve is peering into one of the private rooms on the floor that his Mum is stationed on. It's in a ward where it is mostly occupied with patients that have been in serious accidents that have landed with in comas, or have severely damaged an individual.
"Well he got you there."Phil shrugs, gliding into the kitchen from the back door, dressed in different clothes from the night before and a mug in his hands, green this time.
"I'll let you believe that."Steve snorts, loading the washing machine and slamming the machine door as soon as he's stuffed in the last sock. Steve has known Natasha longer than Bucky has, and despite all of what Natasha is on the outside, she's very knowing and understanding.
His mouth opens to comfort, to release words of calm reassurance or sympathy, but the words don't come out and Rhodey is sure that Tony doesn't want to hear them either. There's a fine line to their friendship, because Rhodey may fight the world for Tony's revenge, but he's not blinded by his mistakes and his problems, in which the mountain is piling.
"4 Dollars for a carton of milk?!"Steve shouts, even making Tony flinch and jump."Why don't I just a buy a whole cow and milk it myself!"What kind of planet charges a carton of milk 4 dollars? A planet that Steve really doesn't want to be a part of right now because that's just outrageous.
"Shrapnel poison hasn't damaged your ego, it seems."Tony freezes suddenly, lips parted momentarily at Ty's words, stomach is tight coils, but he removers quickly as Ty now moves into his line of vision, lean body towering over him, body blocking his path.
"It'll keep you warm."Bucky smirks, taking a gulp from his own glass. He sets the glass onto the side table, knowing he'll get a yelling at by his mom for not using a coaster."And it's Christmas, live a little Stevie."
"I don't care. And besides, who's going to listen to you."The paparazzi weren't exactly besting down doors and crossing police lines to get an interview with Tiberius Stone and neither was his word worth anything either. Sure, the tabloids got a kick of plastering his handsome face over their front page now and again but even at that, it's rare for him to be plastered on the front page. Page 10 maybe.
"Tony!"Steve's always soft, always conceding voice is greeting through the phone. He's in a party type atmosphere, just like any Teenager would usually be on a New Years with his possible friends hanging off of his arms as he tries to move through the crowd to talk better.
"Okay, Love you Honey Bear. Give my love to Momma Rhodes."Tony kisses down the phone even after Rhodey has said his own goodbyes and has hung up. With a heavy sigh, Tony looks down at his phone, a weight off of his shoulders now that he knows that he won't be alone during this dinner.
"So you agree with him! You are all conspiring against me because I'm deaf! Using me for the disable badge, for the sympathy card, for the-"
you to stay."Steve stresses, a little annoyed with the way that Tony's face falls into set, lips pursed and eyes narrowed at the much bigger teenager.
Steve is never more glad to be dropped off at the hospital, calling out a goodbye to the three remaining in the car as he ran his way to the entrance out of the cold before he suffers from frostbite. He's never had good experience with the cold, it brought back bad childhood memories that he tries his hardest to forget.
"It's my job to remain civil with patients and their families, regardless of history."He recites in monotone, picking up the Stark Tab he had previously slammed onto the wooden counter, unable to look if he has broken its glass, but he can feel the cracks through the touch of his finger tips."And I shall be civil within work related hours, and nothing more than that. If you are to be Barnes' emergency contact, so be it, but I want nothing more to do with you than that."
"Good, so that means we have 6 hours to grab everything that we need for a party- cake, balloons, party hats, the whole shabam!"
."Despite the venom Tony wishes was behind his voice as he spoke to the doctor, it comes out hoarse and throaty.
"You have to wait in the waiting room, I'm afraid. It's hospital policy."Tony explains halfheartedly, hoping that Steve will get what he is aiming at and just accept what Tony says. It would make Tony's life so much easier if people just took him by his word. Today, however, is not one of those days.
"When? In between your partying or your manic depressive episodes?"He leans against the counter, arms crossed over his chest and he makes such an action that is seen as negative look for casual as he drawls out his mocking words, not unkindly, and Tony knows that.
. That most I can do is fiddle with a television whenever the screen gets all scrambled, and even at that I have to get Bruce or something to fix it for me. I'm terrible at technology but you- you have a gift."
"I have wallowed in pity and pain because of you for far too long and I'm over it. I've been over it for
"It's a low risk procedure. If we're unable to connect the remaining tissue and nerves to that of the cybernetic prosthetic, we will accustom you with something equalling as matching. The only issue that we have is that of time. If you want us to push forward with this new prosthetic, it will take a lengthy amount of time. We're talking maybe 6 months to a year."
Tony likes the company of his own, and if not on his own, then the bots back in his workshop at MIT or Rhodey on those days that he needs the comfort and attention. Sure, he liked that Steve came up the hospital to visit him, and the texting but that's different. Steve is different, he looks at Tony different, treats him different and that's what Tony likes about him. He just isn't sure that he'll like his friends.
Which, Tony has also figured out means months with Strange, months of late nights and early mornings, months of spilled coffees and shaking hands, months of hunched over paperwork, specs, designs, planning. And Tony isn't exactly sure how he feels about that and the bad thing is, Tony isn't sure if it's the idea of months spent on the same project or spending all of those months with Strange.
"I swear to- stop this! Stop this right now!"Rhodey has grabbed Tony by the shoulders, spun him around until his back is to the kitchen counter, hands tight on his shoulders, Rhodey caging Tony's body with his own. Tony's face falls, eyes wide in shock and unsuspecting fear that bubbles under the surface before it's schooled, face set to match the frustrated anger and determination of Rhodeys own. They're breathing heavy, chests falling rapidly as Rhodey speaks quieter."Just fucking stop it."
"Not a lot, I guess."Steve shrugs, fiddling with his hands."There's Bucky, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Natasha and Phil. I'll introduce you to them all whenever they arrive. Phil and Clint are dating-"
"Tell him I'm not home, I'm in the office or something."He huffs, lips chapped and dry and God, he's dying of thirst. He's not even sure what time it is.
"So, what have you been up to?"You would think that small talk is Tony's forte but the tension is so thick in his office that it physically makes him stuffy and uncomfortable, god knows how he would have dealt if Steve had been looming over his shoulder.
"Of course, I'll make sure you're the nurse I go to the next time I nearly die from alcohol poisoning."He smirks, holding his hands up on the air whenever Sarah glares at him."I'm kidding! I'm a responsible young adult."
"Sorry for the mess, hasn't been gutted since summer."Tony apologises because despite his attempts to clean up whenever Rhodey told him of him arriving, it still, wasn't enough to clean up the sheets of paper and forgotten mugs that once contained coffee.
"Steve."Tony is letting out a breath that he didn't even know that he was holding, one that follows with a smile that he only seems to smile when he's around Steve, that warm type of smile that's usually accompanied with the flutter of butterflies in his stomach.
like a lot of people. Tony has just never presses the right impression onto people, especially people that know
"You're early."Steve notes but he doesn't seem annoyed by the fact, instead the smile only seems to get bigger and Tony curses the fact that he can feel his face beaten with a blush to know that he's the possible reason behind that smile.
"That's...a lot to take in."Steve mutters, shocked by how monotone Tony is about the Arc Reactor - as Steve now knows it as - in his chest, practically keeping him alive and preventing shrapnel - from a fucking bomb? What the hell as his kid been up to? - from piercing his fucking heart."I was to introduce myself again. I'm Steve Rogers."
Tony is ducking around the curtain just as quickly as those words tumble out of this mouth, almost stumbling away from the curtained cubical and into the hallway that he had came, wanting to escape the suffocating atmosphere that was the inclosed cubical and it's occupants. Steve's eyes had bored into his skull as he spoke, Tony could feel the stare of those blue eyes, of how his eyebrows had scrunched together, how his lips had pursed, how his expression was one of wanting to speak his mind and apologise in that moment. And that's without even looking at him.
"Yeah, I mean kind of. It's just Clint, drunk."Steve pitches Tony in just in time for Clint to belt out Steve's name.
Don't get him wrong, he's had his close encounters and each and every time he's been well over his head with some type of illegal substance in his system and encouraging words whispered in his ear as they're crowded in a frat house bathroom. He's just lucky to have his guardian angel around to drag him out of those types of situations.
"Stevie! There you a-"Hiccup,"-re!"He's stumbling his way down the steps, nearly toppling over into the bushes as he sways to the side. There's already the loss of his hearing aids and Clint is too drunk to lipread.
problems. And he definitely doesn't want to deal with Obie, not today, not ever and especially not when hungover.
irresponsible to get us arrested!"Tony sound offended more at the fact of being arrested rather than being called a brat, which in most cases, he is and he isn't exactly in the right place to try and deny that he is. Being arrested, however, was a low blow because Tony not only has the brains to not get arrested but the money to
And at 28, it's a good year. He features in Times Magazine. He earns his third PHD in Medicine to add to the growing collection. Stark Industries has crushed Stone Inc into the ground. He had improved the Arc Reactors abilities, with great difficulty. Obadiah is out of his hair. Tiberius has fallen off the edge of the world. Rhodey is safe and alive and striving well. Justin Hammer won't leave him alone, which is bad. Stephen Strange also won't leave him alone, which is good. Peggy is still in contact. DUMM-E is annoying. JARVIS is brilliantly sarcastic.
But of course, that was a man that Tony had never met, a stranger that's only remembered in newspaper clippings and neatly kept scrapbooks that Maria Stark has kept treasured in the library for years. Now, the Man that was once, has been replaced with one that Maria has had to grown to get use to, and a man that Tony wishes that he never knew.
And Tony hates himself for it, for the tears in his eyes, for the sobs in his throat, for the ache in his chest that he'd like to believe has only appeared, but has been present for an awfully long time. He's weak, gnawed down to the bone, brittle, vulnerable as it crashes, dawns, to him. Of the days, the weeks, the months, the years.
"Oh, yes we are."Bucky is quick at his heels, storming into the room after Steve with determination written all over his face as he speaks."You don't know jack shit about this-
"If you came with affection and adoration yourself then maybe I would."Strange stands up from where he had been sitting at the desk, looming at opened folders that are spilling with pages, sprawled across the fine oak wood desk, somehow in a fashion that's so neat and organised to Tony's usual clutter.
But nevertheless if Steve had felt all those emotions, that he had felt more battered and bruised in those last moments he had with Tony than any street fight or scrap he had been involved in, he still
"If you can't make it to your doctors appointments, I don't think you'd be committed to a gym."He nearly sings, sounding smug and looking it as he types out some notes on his StarkTab before turning his attention back to James.
Steve had a weird, outgoing bunch of friends, all brought together because maybe they weren't all the brightest, or a jock, they weren't sorted into a popular group of meatheads and bimbos nor were they getting awards for being goodie two shoes.
"Steve, Calm down."Tony near enough hisses, cheeks pink in embarrassment as heads start to turn and voices start to whisper about the commotion that Steve is starting.
"Will I always need this?"Tony asks, trying his best not to stare at the glowing blue under the thickness of the bandages. Yinsen graciously showed Tony the designs of the arc reactor and Tony has to admit that it was pretty impressive and didn't look as shabby as Tony had thought it would. It would be visible under most of his clothing and unfortunately enough, there would be scaring around the arc reactor.
He sure does love his bots but they will definitely be the death of him one day. And he reckons he's okay with that.
So all in all, his bedroom has mostly been left untouched, with a bed that Tony has only slept in a handful of times. Tony has never gave himself the opportunity to sleep soundly while at home, despite the bolt lock he has installed on his bedroom door and the locks on his window, he never felt safe.
"I'll try."He answers what she can't dare speak and then they're hugging, wrapped in one another's arms in the middle of the kitchen and Sarah can't help the feeling that she's hugging her little boy, not the big strapping lad that's actually wrapped in her arms because all she feels, and all she imagines is 5 year old Steve with scraped knees and a runny nose."I'll have Buck with me, don't worry."
child - head off to war, not knowing if they will return with open arms and kiss to the cheek or in a coffin with the American flag draped across in respect.
He should be happy that he's going home, that he's going to be able to see his Mom for the first time since that day of the accident, that he'll be able to see Jarvis without seeing that look of concern wash over his face every time the heart monitor misses a chime. He should be happy because it's his home, it should be his home, he should be happy.
"It doesn't matter, I'll take whatever."Steve reassures, setting the two foam cups onto the table at the end of Tony's hospital bed. It was able to roll on wheels, to be moved to rest over Tony's bed. Steve is pulling our sugar sachets and milk pods out of the pockets of his hoodie, setting them on the table as he moves the table so it was over Tony's bed but in a way that didn't effect what way he was sitting and still allowed Steve to reach.
Steves neighbourhood is on the line between where the sun doesn't touch the ground and one that uses diamonds at cupcake toppings. It was one he has grew up in, the game house on the same street in the same bedroom with the same neighbours, one where everyone knew everyones business and the kids will grow up with one another until adult hood because no one ever seems to move. It's an atmosphere that Steve has witnessed lacks in other neighbours across the US. It's what Steve likes about his neighbour hood.
"Yeah, I normally spend it with my friend and his family. My mum will be working, but it's all good fun and she normally gets off in time for desert."Steve smiles sadly. He would love for his Christmas to be family filled, for him to spend the entire day with his mum but she has to work and Steve doesn't blame her for doing so."What about you? Will your parents come up and spend the day with you?"
"As if I'd allow some community college bloke come and fix a television that I can do in less time that them."Tony rolls his brown eyes, eyeing the television before shaking his head and looking back down at his blueprints.
"He didn't tell you the truth either."Bucky deadpans, stuffing the phone back into the pocket of his jogging bottoms, pushing a hand through his longing dark hair."He lied to you, Steve, he made you believe that he was some type of wounded animal, and what, because he has that thing in his chest? Boohoo, poor little rich boy is just hanging onto that as a charity case stunt to pull in sadsaps like you for fresher cock."
Tony is on the field more often than he had expected to be, mostly because Tony had thought a simple measurement here and another one there would be enough of a feel that Tony needed to gather before zooming off to make the desired limb, but that hadn't been the case. It was so much more difficult working with human beings and human flesh in comparison of machines and robots that Tony is so use to working with, but Tony was able and he learned that it's not as bad as he expected.
"Why do you have to be so mean to your sisters?"Steve rolls his eyes, taking the tall glass from Buckys grip.
There's a phone screen being flaunted into his face, a headline caption of some tabloid that Tony knows of but doesn't know enough about. His vision is blurry, the pixelated words on the stupid IPhone blurring together, paragraphs smudging and lines adjoining but Tony can read the headline clear enough that it makes his stomach drop and the photographs along side the article to cause his throat to close over.
"I'll come back, I promise. Just, just not right now."Tony sighs, a heavy dread in his chest, in his voice, the voice in his head included. He can't look Steve in the eye because he knows by the time he goes back to MIT, the life he leaves behind for the holidays is going to come back at full force; the drugs, the parties, the men, the sex, the alcohol.
to."Steve corrects, a drawl in his voice as he speaks."And anyway, I'm fine. It's not life threatening and it's not as if I'm house bounded."Steve gives his mom a look, watching how her shoulders sag with a loud sigh as he looks longingly at her son, almost as if she's trying to calculate what is going on in his head, reading his mind.
"Oh, well, um, Saturday?"Tony actually has to stop and think, backtracking his days to figure out if that's correct or not.
"A peck, nothing more, I just- I just want to test out a theory."And as the words tumble out of Tony's mouth, their lips meet in a kiss that Steve has initiated but one that Tony has met him half way for. There's no movie moment of sparks and fireworks, but there's a warm, bubbling feeling of anxiety, of fear or of some other adjoining emotion that comes with feelings and crushes and sweet on's of the like.
. A grin breaks out into Tony's face, happy to see the man despite only seeing him a couple of days ago. However this was different, this wasn't just Jarvis coming to visit Tony, it was him bringing him home.
Which is never a good thing, to be so caught up in your own thoughts that you get lost within them, a tourist in your own mind where your thoughts are so jumbled up and scrambled that it all but seems to be in a different language. Tony was always one for being alone, he adored the thought of being left to his own devices, but he loathed the idea of being alone with his own thoughts, a dark territory which when revealed, stained him as if ink that could not be removed.
Steve nods, turning and eyeing the chilled shelves of milk. He didn't know that there was so many types of milk to choose front, low in fat, full fat, goats milk, almond milk, coconut milk and the lost went on. Steve just takes a lucky dip and reaches for one, checking the price and nearly having a god damn heart attack in the middle of the dairy section.
Which was weird, because never has anyone begged for Tony to stay longer, with the exception of Momma Rhodes of course. And it just gets weirder whenever Bruce joined him on the sofa and they sat and discussed Tony's new layout of the Arc Reactor he was thinking of upgrading to, or the phone that he made from scratch in his college workshop, or how Bruce has one of the most intelligent, undiscovered minds of the century ( even if that did make Bruce blush to the tips of his ears ).
"Howard."Tony finds himself automatically replying, looking at Howard with the same monotone expression that suggests he wants to be anywhere but here.
And surely everybody has their weak spots, something that just gives everything away. Whether that's the way you stand, the way you look, how your eyes move or your finger twitches, whether you're revealing a hidden emotion, telling a lie, hiding a secret. Everybody has a weak spot and Peppers just so happen to be her eyes. She may be a very strong, independent woman but she's easy to tears and it's the unshed tears in her eyes that give her away, that with one blink from her or one wince of pain from Tony will send her over the edge; a flood of tears. And Tony honestly doesn't think he could take that.
"Good health? I don't know if you're unable to see or not, but I have a metal sticking out of his chest and the skin under my bandages feels like melted rubber. I am the furthest away from
His heart hammers in his chest, palms sweating, a pulse in his neck, lips trembling in anger or sadness or disbelief or maybe in betrayal as his fingers dance across a beaten up computer in the corner of his room. Steve's finger hovers over enter, trembling, hesitant, uncertain because does he want to have himself fall down this rabbit hole? Of every thought that he has, sight he has cherished, opinion he has kept, of Tony to be tainted by the truth of what he truly is?
"Stole it from maintenance."He shrugs his shoulders, stroking his thumb over the blueprints that he's looking at. It's the outline sketch for a new robot, DUMM-E is getting bored all on his own and deserves a friend to get along with and also help out Tony in the lab. Tony leaves out the part where he actually paid some nurse to get it for him and bring it back, Sarah doesn't need to know that.
"Well, If I tell you that I do want to go out on an official date with you, will it knock it back up?"
In some way, Tony should be happy that he's heading home, that's he being discharged with a clap on the back, a complete food and work out schedule to get him back on track and a stern talking to about looking after himself. He should be happy, it means that he gets to sleep in a bed that doesn't have a mattress made of rocks and a room that gives off the comforting smell of motor oil and aftershave that still lingers despite the many times the housekeeping staff clean his room.
When Tony is involved, nothing ever goes to plan and honestly, he thought that his Mother would know by now not to bring him along because it's going to end up in with an argument between Tony and Howard or something worse. It always does because Tony and Howard can never see eye to eye and both provoke the argument.
"No. This is obviously fake."Is Steve's first reaction, scoffing, shaking his head, pushing the phone out from his face because that can't be Tony, not
, especially when Steve remembers how adamant Tony was to peruse his degree in Electrical Engineering.
Peggy - as Christened by the group whenever Thor had pulled the car out of a scrap yard - skids into the ambulance unloading section at A&E, with the windows rolled down manually and some Bon Jovi tape in the player. The car gets out an u heathy rattle and wheel as it slows to a stop. Steve doesn't expect anything else from Natasha, the girl makes her own rules as he goes and that's why Steve lobes about her.
"I know,"His voice is soft, softer than it's been in weeks, in months, because he's had no one to speak softly to, he's had no one to whisper reassurances or murmur praises and encouragements, or to be gentle around a subject because he no longer wants to be gentle. But this is his mom, someone who spent years being gentle around him, picking him up when he fell, looking after him when he was ill, working hard to pay off medical bills, buy him Christmas gifts, take him out for breakfasts.
"But you were thinking, and I could hear you thinking, and I haven't had coffee yet so I'm not in any mood to deal with your 21 questions."Tony lets out a quiet, snuffly sounding huff as he somehow manages to curl into a tighter ball, body coming closer to Steves. Steve just snorts a laugh, rolling onto his back and stretching his arms up above his head, a groan escaping his lips at the new found comfort that relaxes from his body.
"This is me, of course it's me nobody else could ha a handsome face like this,"Tony smirks, gracing a hand under his chin and grinning at Sarah who just laughs."And this is my best friend Rhodey just this summer, we went to London for a week to see some sighs and it was honestly the best holiday I've ever had."He gushes.
friend,"Tony corrects, pointedly looking at Steve who stares back a hum."Two if I count you. I have people that tolerate me, want to get to know me because of my looks, for my body for my...
"I use to take you here,"Her voice hasn't changed, it's still soft and British and holds a higher regard of authority but gentleness that Tony has never been able to get his head around. It never has changed because she always spoke to Tony in the same way that she spoke to Jarvis, or Anna, or Maria, but never the same way with Howard. No, because with Howard, Peggy always spoke as if she had the higher ground, in such a way, over him, as if she knew things about Howard that no other did, and maybe, she had and maybe she still does, but that information would be useless now, Tony thinks.
"You have no fucking idea how happy I am to see you. Did you know that I found fur in my pudding while in hospital? Fucking
"A tough nut to crack."Obi shakes his head with a dark chuckle, one that causes Tony to shiver and move closer to Rhodey in an automatic reaction for protection. He leaves rather quickly, casting a glance at Tony as he leaves, the pair remaining outside in the cold December night.
"Well I don't see any other electrical engineering students around here, do you?"Tony raises an eyebrow, bringing his cheeseburger back up to his mouth and taking another bite, once again letting out a delightful moan at the wonderful taste that attacks his tastebuds. Whatever the medical staff in this hospital were trying to feed him was not food, Tony knows his food and food does not have fur.
"It's complicated."Tony comments, eyes still following as Steve walls down the hallway, watching the way that his shoulders are tensed and slumped and it seems so unlike the Steve that Tony knew.
Tony had been jostled out of his thoughts and the gears had shifted from one of wallowing to one of action as he rushed and bustled to make himself look charming and alive.
want Tony to meet his friends, because of course he does, just now doesn't seem the most appropriate of times. Tony is just out of hospital, he's spending som time at home with his family before he's going back to MIT for months. It doesn't seem like the right time to be shoving the idea of meeting his peers in his face.
"Thank you,"Tony smiles finally, a smile that is so little and Steve would have missed it if it wasn't for the fact that he was
"Who said anything about loving you, ha! Put your shirt on, I'm going to sort out when we can schedule our next appointment, I'll be back in a minute."Tony waits until he receives a nod of understanding before he leaves the room, making his way back to the nurses station where Strange just so happens to have returned too also, handing over his tablet for a nurse to read the details off of quickly before taking it back, giving it a thorough once over himself.
"You look terrible,what happened this time?"Natasha breaks the silence, watching as Steve struggles to pull the seatbelt over his body with his good arm. The player is turned down to a reasonable volume to allow herself to be heard.
"You're making the right decision, Mr. Barnes."Tony's smile is still tight, despite the fact  that his body has seemed to relax without the heavy stare of Steve's boring eyes on his shoulders. His cheeks have numbed with that familiar stretch of a smile far too large, a smile he usually reserves for nosey journalists and talk show hosts that put their hand too far up his thigh. He catches himself on, wiping the smile off of his face with a cough into a closed fist."I'll have a colleague of mine, Dr. Stephen Strange, come and outline what is about happen next. Of course, we won't be jumping into things straight away, we will have to run a couple of assessments and hold some very lengthy discussions with your lawyer and our legal team-"
But Tony is stubborn, he doesn't want his ideas to be in the hands of people like Howard or his business partner Obi. He knows that whatever Tony has his ideas for, will be turned on its head and used for weapons, for manipulating technology that will sure be used to take over the world or some illogical shit like that.
"Good Afternoon Sir, the time is 5:12 in the afternoon, the temperature is currently 53 degrees Fahrenheit and you have 157 voicemails awaiting in your inbox-"And Pepper has gawked, if only a little as JARVIS had continued to impress and Tony had continued to shine if only for a little while at a creation he worked so hard upon. But he, JARVIS, was still only an infant and Tony had not finished with him yet, he had explained, because JARVIS was going to be the best, he was going to be worldwide known, but untouchable but only to Tony.
But he's good. He's 28. Going on 29. And soon he'll be 30. And then 40. And then, Tony won't exactly know if he'll be good or not. But for now, he is. And for now, that's okay.
"We aren't gonna spend Video Game night playing fucking Mario Kart."Bucky deadpans, sending Steve a deathly look. Mario Kart never ends well, with usually the console thrown out the window by Thor and Clint being sulky over his 4th consecutive loss."Clint also says no to Mario Kart."
"If you don't want to talk, that's fine. We can just sit here until the sun rises, or until the sun sets, and remain here, with you, for you if that's what you need. We don't need to talk."His voice is so soft, just like his skin, just like his hands, and his lips move so perfectly around each word and syllable that Tony's eyes are drawn to them.
"Maybe."Steve shrugs his broad shoulders, his t-shirt tight and smaller than it should be. He's came along way from the sickly skinny boy that he use to be, but still a long way from becoming the man that he's training to be."I was actually going to ask who it was in my bed, but I've figured out that answer pretty quickly."
is the signalled discussion of a disbandment, a split, a breakup in all sorts of shapes and forms and right now, or any now perhaps, Tony doesn't think he can take it if Rhodey decided to pack up his stuff and leave Tony in the dust of all of his makeshift problems.
Rhodey hadn't stayed long, and Tony didn't expect him to either, and in a way he didn't want him to stay long either. He knows that Mama Rhodes wants him home before he's back off to MIT and Tony may miss his company, crave him attention and touch - because it's moments like these, where he's alone in the cold that he needs that familiar touch and attention - he's not going to get in the way of Rhodey and his Family.
Also, Bucky lied. Cheese burgers cost way more than 2 dollars, and the extra fries and milkshakes rounded the cost to 15 dollars - including his bus fair. Steve was just glad that he had that extra cash that Reta gave him last week after doing her shopping, and the spare change from all the Christmas gifts he had bought for the gang. It would be worth it though, Tony looked sad and he didn't want anyone to be during this Christmas period.
"Everyone is fine Mom. Go back to work."He basically shoos her away with a gentle and reassuring smile. She nods, already turning so she can start rushing down the hallway once again, allowing Steve to breath a little easier. It didn't take a genius to know where Steve got his kindness and good nature from, it was knitted into Steve.
, has sent Tony's blood running cold for a whole new reason for a second time this day, for the hairs on the back of his neck to stand on edge, his heart to hammer against his fragile ribcage, to feel it in his throat because a
"Are you hungry? I bet you're hungry. I'll tell one of the chefs to cook you up something. Something small, snackish, cheese grills? Yeah okay."Tony dodges, babbling away as he grabs at Rhodey's arm."Come on, you're bunking with me."
When Tony awakes again, this time, it's on his own accord and he's on his own. Replacing the sickly sweet voice is the continuous beeping sound of the all too familiar heart monitor, monitoring Tony's heart beat that seemed a little too slow for his liking. The cotton ball feeling is still in his mouth, mouth dry from lack of swallowing and hoarse from lack of speaking.
"Ring him now, J."Tony crosses his hands and swipes the prototype projection away, saved for later. S.I were up his back about his lack of input in their devices, it had only been last year that the Stark Tab Gen 3 had came out but people become superficial, materialistic and as much as it's known that Stark Technology are far more advanced than that of Apple or Samsung, their competitors were pumping out products like there was no tomorrow.
But if he phoned you up right this minute and asked for you to come to him, or for him to come to you, you'd fucking do it, and you know you would, because you're naive and gullible and this guy could be anyone, for fuck sake!"
' but the more rational, levelheaded part of Tony stands his ground and motions his hand in the vague direction of the waiting room, watching as Steve nods his head at Dr Strange in acknowledgment and turns to follow orders.
"As you say, Sir."And this time, Tony does glare at the ceiling because the point of having technology that he built is to make sure they continue to inflate his ego,
"Is that sass?"If tony had his eyes open he'd be narrowing them at the ceiling. Tony can't remember programming his A.I with that much sass, or maybe he had, JARVIS was modelled after
"Because it was on his goddamn medical bracelet, you idiot!"And his medical sheets, and at the foot of his bed in block letters on a clip board that had read
"Someone come and fix the television?"Tony's favourite nurse asks, raising her eyebrow at a chilled back Tony who wasn't even paying attention to whatever movie that was playing on the hospital television, and instead looking through some type of blueprints. Tony fixes the glasses on his nose that were gradually falling, looking over at the nurse.
The room spins for a moment or two, but eventually settles enough to allow Tony to make the distance from the living area to the stairs, eyes scanning over empty bottles, plastic Cubs, confetti, articles of clothing and garage that litters the floors, furniture, draped over chairs and banisters. Jarvis would go nuts if he saw the state of Stark House and his mother would have been dragged by the ear.
"Um, Thank you."Tony manages a smile, ducking his head to hide the blush that coats his cheeks and instead taps his fingers on the heart monitor."That's the first anyone has ever said that to me...and meant it. I mean apart from Rhodey, but he rarely sees anything I work on so that's a rare occasion. So thank you, really."
"You're not that kind of doctor,"Tony smirks, shrugging a shoulder,"And besides, you kept declining my offer to be apart of my team."
"What? Oh fuck, I forgot all about that."There's a momentarily moment of panic that flashes through Tony as he sorts through the mental notes and dates in his head, trying to figure out when he's next free. JARVIS will know, of course, but he doesn't want to look too reliant on his technology. "Right, uh, I'll only be gone for 3 days. It's a flying visit, really, so I can bring you back in in 27 days time."
for him. Tonys touch had still lingered in places where his hands had smoothed over, his lips had placed butterfly soft kisses upon, his foot had gently pressed against, his body had leaned into. Tony's touch was a ghostly reminder, something to gravitate towards when he was pressed flat to a dusted road in a tattered country of bullets and bombs.
"You know exactly where I went, Mr.Barnes. Away."His body is angled to the curtain as he forces himself to look at Bucky, whose heavy jacket remains draped over his shoulders in an attempt to hide the deformity and Tony's fingers seem to have wondered to the Arc Reactor in his chest in that moment, a reminder of his own deformity. "'Just like what everyone wanted."
"I know."Is all Natasha replies with, revving the engine to show her lack of patience and instead of dwelling any further in this miserable cold, Steve is rounding the car and getting into the passenger seat, the car taking off before he can even fiddle with his seat belt.
"No, you did Steve."It's the first time he's said his name in an awfully long time and it almost had Tony freezing all over, in an icy chill so suffocating and numbing that it has Tony struggling to breathe because his name,
"Call me Bruce, please."He hadn't changed, he'd just matured, gotten a bit older looking, a bit more handsome. There was still a skittish quality about the man, but that was nothing that Tony couldn't deal with. The heels on Tony's dress shoes made him a few inches taller, but without they would stand at the same height. Hair knotted in tight dark coils and rectangular glasses that Tony can't help but notice that he takes off to clean even when they're not dirty.
"They should be grateful that they're even getting the opportunity to glance at my work."Tony mutters halfheartedly, picking up one of the prototype tablets that had been left abandoned on his clustered desk. He wouldn't go as far as saying that his bedroom is a mess, I mean yes it could go with a tidying up and maybe once in a while the maid could be allowed in to clean up, but Tony knows where everything is and it isn't
"Is that what the rumours are, shrapnel poison?"He laughs in disbelief, rolling his brown eyes as he tries to push past Ty's body, a voice at the back of his head telling him to ignore the words that are coming out of his mouth and to push on. Tony had learned long ago on how to school his expression, it wasn't going to flatter now.
"Good evening, Steve."A doctor nods Steves way whenever he spots the teen walking the halls in boredom as he waits to be picked up. He had disturbed Natasha with a phone call obviously at the wrong time, seeing as she was
. His voice still rings in Steve's head even know, as he finds himself back at home, away from the constant voices of fellow peers and worried glances from friends who don't know the meaning of personal space and boundaries, cloaked in the darkness of his bedroom where curtains are drawn shut and his bed is freshly made. Tony's name still floats behind his eyes when he closes them, his voice ringing in his ears, his touch on his skin, his scent lingered on places he touched months ago.
?"Tony laughs darkly, shaking off Maria's touch and taking steps away from her. The house has obviously been fixed as best as it can despite the short time, but it has been fixed up and you wouldn't even know that there was a problem to begin with."I'm the one with the fucking hole in my chest and
"Thanks..."Tony's voice trails off, looking at Steve skeptically as if he was waiting for the backlash that was yet to come. Nobody ever commented Tony's work, even his professors just
It also doesn't help his case that they can be a bit overpowering. There's nothing that Steve can do about that because it's their personalities, who they are and Steve loves them for who they are and wouldn't change a thing in the world about them. What Steve doesn't have to fear is the group judging Tony for being that much of an outsider, none of them have the right to judge and neither of them would.
Tony lays there, for only a moment of two as he ponders the 'request' that is being urged towards him, if he could really even call it a request. They've been famously circling one another for months now, a game of Cat and Mouse that neither really acknowledge but both very knowledgeable that it is happening. And it's so different to what Tony usually does, when he knows there's a spark, even if just a little one, he shies away from it because Tony doesn't do sparks, and he sure as hell doesn't do
"Well I didn't promise you it,"Steve smiles, snorting a laugh just as Tony rolls out from under the covers of Steve's bed and nearly falls onto the floor, swiftly up onto his feet. His outfit hasn't changed, a hoodie and a pair of joggers but his hair is a messy of tight, corkscrew curls that remind Steve of that day he first saw Tony in the hospital, in joggers and a tank top, fully exposed in all his skin, muscled arms and scars.
"Trying to get the fuck away from 'Tasha and Thor. Those two crazy bastards take snow ball fights way too fucking seriously. I think Thor bruised my ribs with a ball of snow."Clint grimaces, giving a shiver as he looks over his shoulder. The snow ball fight had started an hour before, taking it from across the city to Steve and Buckys neighbourhood.
"I haven't seen snow in so long,"Which was true, and it couldn't be blamed for Tony being in hospital. Winter break meant a winter vacation, one that Tony would try and opt out of but seemed to always fail to do so. The Starks have many homes across the world, in warm and cold locations. He would guess that's where his Mum and Howard are now, on their private island in the Caribbean.
James 'Rhodey' Rhodes was the closest being that Tony has ever had as a brother, a best friend and God did Tony love the guy a lot. He was on Tony Starks very very very short list of people that he adored - also on the list being Jarvis, Anna, his Mom and Aunt Peggy - and believe me, not a lot of people made that list.
"Well, we sure weren't boyfriends. So what was I, hmm? A whore, a slut, a slag, a tramp?"Tony lists off the words that he has heard to be recited back at him over the years, name tags that have stuck, wrapped around a cord around his neck.
"Oh, save it."Tony rolls his eyes, peering up at Bucky through his thick rimmed glasses, the cigarette dangling from the corner of his lip as fishes out the remainder packet of cigarettes from his hoodie pocket, holding them out to the mysteriously edgy looking teenager."Join me, if you wish."
"What the fuck is wrong with me,"Tony's words are muffled, his tongue heavy and his mouth feeling numb because the words that come out of his mouth are so harsh and filled with venom that is only directed at himself. The grip that he has on Rhodeys t-shirt tightens, he pulls himself closer, standing on his tiptoes as he's held, a heavy pressure behind his eyes as his voice quakes."I'm such a fucking asshole."
And Tony smiles, even if it's small and not real, just so that he can see Pepper smile at him in return.
"I don't care, but Stevie does."James is bringing the burning cigarette up to his lips, inhaling and exhaling the smoke into the crisp cold air as he side eyes Tony. The smaller teenager looks so fragile beside him, a shivering shoulders compared to Bucky's broad ones, overly large jumper in compassion to his tight shirt.
"Home, I guess. Long Island if you wanna know. Then I'll be off to MIT by the New Year."Tony informs, throwing a couple of items of clothing into the open suitcase, most of his clothing being brought forward and back by Jarvis whenever he came up to visit. He's normally be doing this, but now that he's up and about Tony is going to take advantage.
They smell different too, of coffee but not the cheap garage coffee that Phil always stinks of but of coffee beans, freshly grounded and a hint of hazelnut to the scent. They don't smell of perfume, or aftershave, but of sweet cigarettes and potato chips, radiating a sort of warmth that doesn't make Steve kick off the bedcovers but makes him want to curl an arm around them and pull them in closer.
, nudging at his chest once more before whirling off towards a far end corner of the workshop, determined to clean up the mess he had made which he hopes that Tony hasn't noticed, which he does, but he leaves Dumm-E to it.
, favouriting scandalous stories of newly contacted STI's and an exclusive interview with the latest who has crawled into bed with Tony Stark. Tony, of course, finds amusement from indulging in such articles, a guilty pleasure to read because it's always fun to know if he has Chlamydia this month or be reminded of all his favourite kinks.
Sarah looks over at the Dark skinned boy shown in the photograph. He was obviously older and taller than Tony, but his smile was genuine as he has his arm draped around Tony's shoulder and grinning at the camera.
"It's my job, Tony."She shakes her head, following his lingering eye to the tray of food and medication that's sits on his table. It was an endless battle when it came to food, but medication came simpler than what people thought. Turns out, Tony doesn't want to die yet, but he doesn't mind suffering."You're only 16, you don't have the trouble of a job, just yet that is."
Clint is flapping his free hand around as he talks, scrunching up his face and puts on a mocking voice. "Sure I'm
The funeral has been small. Jarvis and Anna had had no children of their own, or any family beyond the outskirts of the Starks, especially Tony, who had been in the arms of Jarvis and Anna during his infancy more than his own parents. Tony had watched the coffin lower into the ground with hands shoved into the pockets of his trousers, crisp and expensive, with a lowered head and a heavy heart as he dared to flicker his eyes off the coffin and to the outstretch of land in front of him.
Peggy Carter was a massive part of Tony's life, from the minute that he had been born, Tony had spent more time in his Aunt Peggy's arms than his own Mothers. She had carried him on his shoulders through shopping centres, took him to the park, was at all of his Science fairs and took him traveling during the school holidays. Peggy Carter was his Godmother, his only childhood friend and it has hurt when she exited his life.
"Oh yeah, a terrible life coming from the family of Billionaires. That must be so fucking hard."He spits with pure venom in his voice, a fire in his eyes, jealousy."Must be terrible to have always have money, to have whatever you want at a snap of the fingers, to be jetting off to one of your many homes around the world. You're so disadvantaged."
Hey sorry it’s been awhile! I love the love and support that everyone gives me so thank you very much!
"Steve, listen to me, please."Tony is almost begging, following after Steve into his home, so close to dropping to his knees, kissing his feet, beg to be listened, to explain, to wallow."You
"I would suggest you get yourself one, Mr. Barnes."Tony shifts the Stark Tab, cracked in its left hand corner from the slammed impact it had to endure moments ago in Tony's frustration and anger, onto his left hand so that he can use his other to dig inside a pocket of his coat, pulling out an old fashioned business card. He flicks it over, checks that it's correct before handing it to Bucky."Call them. They're small and quiet but trust me, they do their job."
"I- you better be fucking kidding me."Rhodey freezes, eyes wide and hands on Tony's shoulders, jostling the younger man."Tell me you're fucking kidding me and that you did not give test subjects your prototype meal replacement shakes."
"Oh you charmer, stop it."Tony winks through his shields at Happy, earning himself one in return and god, doesn't it feel good to flirt again. The car starts and begins to drive and they're not even off the runway before Pepper begins to speak up.
. Remove the rest, I don't care what happens to them or where they end up, just get them off of the property."The shadow that had been casted over Tony shifts away, a beam of sunlight lining through the massive, stretched out windows and onto Tony, casting the light upon his rugged, hungover features.
"Oh yes, it was just a couple of minimal things, procedure."Tony waves Steve off as he goes back to leaning over the counter to type stuff out on his StarkTab, almost wanting to curl into himself and disappear as Steve stands beside him, eyes boring into him as he stands and waits for Tony to tell him more. "Oh, um, James will be right out. I'm thinking of bringing Mr Barnes back in 2 weeks time? It gives him time to check out his physiotherapist and look at all the legal stuff too."
of that look, because he had just seen his reflection just moments ago in the hospital bathroom look exactly like that, waxy and ill. As if he had just seen a ghost of a man he had imagined to be dead because to be dead was less of a heartache than for them to have just gotten up and left because being dead was not a choice. In a way, Steve had been a ghost, a ghost of a past that Tony had no interest in reliving and one he had been working years to forget with alcohol and pills and new heartaches to numb the one that left a gaping hole in his heart.
"Howard."He nods his head in a sort of greeting, half of his body remaining hidden behind the bedroom door, not fully opening or exposing himself to the man in front of him. It's obvious that Maria is the one that has forced Howard up the stairs to talk to their son, Tony can tell by the way he has yet to leave.
"You say that but you barely come out of your workshop unless you have to."Steve drawls out, pushing the trolley towards the dairy section.
"Because you called my face pretty for the wrong reasons, Doctor."And he's off to the ER department, located down the hallway, opposite direction of where Doctor Strange had been heading, but he's sure that they'll meet up one time or another before Tony leaves.
"Well I ain't pretty."Tony mutters, brining the lighter down and taking the cigarette out from between his lips. He'd been tempted, an inching feeling under his skin since he had left the hospital because he might not smoke all of the time but he did when he was anxious and right now, he was very anxious.
"Oh I know, this is not a physical bruise."He puts down his elbow, throwing up a holographic screen so that he can swipe and swerve through them in search of the thing that he's looking for.
It's not something that happens often, because usually neither of them are right, but when it does happen, it's as if a massive boot made out of steel has kicked him repeatedly in the backside and Steve is not fond of that feeling whatsoever. It's a feeling of dread in his stomach, and the voice in his head that taunts him with a chant of
"Stay out of trouble."She sighs in defeat, watching as Tony smiles whenever she puts the money back into her pocket.
"Pretty boys shouldn't smoke."He hears a gruff voice tut, causing Tony to turn his attention towards the voice. A familiar figure stands a couple of feet away from him, in a suit that costs probably the same amount as one of Howard's prized cars.
Joseph Rogers was a man that Steve hated the sound of his name, the man had left when Steve was 10, walked out the door after slapping around his mother for the years of their marriage. Steve was glad that he was gone, he was a waste of a father and an even shittier husband. His mum deserved better, she deserved the moon, she believed that whatever Steve wanted to do, or be, where ever he'll go, that he'll have a good life and that's all the support he needed.
Bruce became Tony's go-to brain, someone who Tony could rely on to talk to about inventions and specs, to have a look at his latest prototype or test out one of Tony's newest inventions. The only person that Tony could trust was Tony, but sometimes when Tony couldn't trust Tony, he trusted Bruce.
"-Tasha said that we can borrow her car, which is an understatement because she gave me a fucking Bible of instructions on how to start the stupid piece of shit, and apparently, if we damage it, we have to pay for it as if it's not already falling apart- and you're not even
"Then you can repay me with something else, not with money."Steve huffs stubbornly, watching how Tony scrunches up his nose in utter confusion as to what else he could repay Steve in. Steve takes that as his moment to leave the room,"I'll be back in a mo'."
He has bought two cheeseburgers, and fries, and two milkshakes and even if Steve doesn't like burgers or fries from fast food industries, he would eat them so that Tony didn't eat alone or Tony could just have them both, he didn't care. Anyway, Steve likes milkshakes and he hopes that Tony likes milkshakes, and he really hopes that he isn't lactose intolerant because that would really make things shit.
"Stay optimistic, Ms Potts, or I may have to fire you."Tony waggles his finger in that way he has seen Obie use towards him, all condescending and dripping with superiority. But Tony is using it teasingly because he would never fire Pepper and truth be told, Tony doesn't even know where to start when it comes to firing people, he usually gives that job to Pepper and wouldn't that be awkward for Pepper to have to fire herself. "I think I ought to fire you for not bringing that cheeseburger, however, I've been starved in a cave, Pepper!"
The Doctor Introduces himself as Dr. Ho Yinsen, and he explains throughout the process he had went though to accustom the new found Arc Reactor magnet in Tony's chest, which would stop the piece of Shrapnel from the missile from entering his chest and killing him. Tony seems to take it in his stride, he nods, he asks questions and is pretty calm whenever Yinsen explains what would happen if the arc reactor is damaged and broken.
"Tony!"And that one sound of his name, in that sweet familiar voice manages to make all of Tony's worrying thoughts disappear, melting the tension and the worry from his face as he's greeted with the welcoming grin that's plastered on Steve's face.
"Sir, I do need to remind you that you wanted to call Doctor Banner this afternoon."Tony blinks, hands stopping in its tracks of gliding across holographic screens, eyes tired of squinting because he forgot where he had last set his glasses and doesn't want to ask JARVIS where they are. He looks at the clock, making a strangled sound of surprise at the time.
There's a hoodie laying on his bedroom floor, a pale blue and softened with age and laundry detergent, one that Tony recognises only for its odd appearance in his bedroom of oil greased tanks and dirty work boots. It sticks out like a sore thumb, from his colour, it's touch, it's smell as he brings it up to his nose; of how laundry smells on a windy day, of freshly cut grass and cheap, old cologne that makes Tony want to bury his nose in the scent that rests at the base of Steve's neck.
As much as Tony has feared of how uncooperative that James Barnes would be, it was actually quite the opposite, much to his surprise. James was actually more talkative and interactive with Tony than when they were teenagers sitting on the front porch of Steve's house smoking, back then, James was so standoffish and smouldering, acting like the world was against him before the world even had its chance at him. Now, it seemed that James was more of a move on and grow kind of character, which Tony admires deeply.
"I don't think I'll experience that type of life, anyway."Steve shrugs his shoulders, looking away from Tony whenever he hears a crash from inside of the house, followed by Clint stumbling out through the open front door and onto the decking. He's drunk, and anyone would be with the way he has been drinking all night."Fuck."
"Bucky texted. Get in the car, Steve."He tenses at her tone, looking down the street as if he's going to see Bucky sprinting down the pavement, the sleeve of his leather jacket, of where an arm use to be, flapping behind him in the wind. He almost wishes he had been because Steve would rather sit in stony silence with Bucky over having to talk with Natasha.
"Or Stark Industries will forever be known as producing faulty weapons, and wouldn't that be the worse to hear that our dear men and women overseas see us using bombs that could potentially blow off their own limbs. Oh the lawsuits! The money! The shame!"
A prime example of people like that are Tiberius Stone, a fellow MIT student 5 years older than what Tony is. It hadn't taken long for Tony to understand that all of Tiberius's flirty gestures and free drinks was all for the sake of getting into Tony's pants, all and hoping for Tony to scream out SI secrets in bed. It was a pity that Tony found out that Ty was a spy for his own father, especially when he's so hot.
It's a weird conversion starter but he guesses he can go with the flow. Tony has been stuck in worse and weirder conversations before and this is by far the best on that list.
"What's wrong?"Tony says over a mouthful of food, looking over at Steve with wide eyes. He has his cheeseburger in one hand and a screw driver in the other, starting to close up the heart monitor.
Tony doesn't trust alot of men, it shows a lot whenever he refuses to take his medication or eat any food brought up by a male nurse. He barely listens to Doctor Yinsen whenever he comes up to check on Tony, because as much as he's a doctor and Tony knows he should be able to trust him, he can't find it in himself to do so. But he trusts Sarah, Tony knows that Sarah just wants him to get better.
Tony is never more glad to have Rhodey along side of him during their mingling, mostly because the attention was often moved off of the Arc Reactor whenever brought up, thanks to Rhodey being able to stir the conversation a different direction. And of course, not all of their interactions were overly bad or boring which also helped the entire situation.
"Yes, thank you Thor! Say it louder, I don't think Bucks little sisters heard."Clint hisses, throwing himself onto the floor beside Natasha and curling into her side like a vulnerable little puppy desperate for affection. Natasha - being the brilliant best friend that she is - strokes at Clints hair.
"Shirt off or I'm going to start thinking that you actually do have two arms."Tony throws himself onto his chair, the chair spinning with the force which gives him the opportunity to grab the equipment that he needs to take measurements, test reflexes and a couple of photos and test samples. By the time he has turned back, Bucky is without his shirt, wearing an under vest, avoiding eye contact with Tony as the doctor slides his chair closer to him.
Pushing himself off the bed, Tony shuffles his way towards the door just as the knocking starts again, more inpatient than before. Hesitantly, Tony is unbolting the lock on his bedroom door and opening the door, finding himself face to face with Howard who stands in front of Tony. It's a shock to even see the man, nevertheless for him to be knocking on Tony's door during the
Tony truly wasn't listening when Barnes spoke those words, his eyes too focused on the vacant uncomfortable, fragile blue chair that a man Tony hadn't thought about in a long time sat, rigid and tense when tony had first ripped open the curtains of the cubical, stumbled to get up and get his attention as Tony had tensed, visibly shook and avoided eye contact. It was terrible how such a person, who Tony had once swooned over, could make Tony's entire body shake.
, Howard's voice still rings in his ears as he digs the palms of his hands into his eyes, trying to push back the heavy pressure behind them.
"Hello Doctor Caldwell."He nods with a polite smile, continuing his venture down the corridor. He gives polite smiles and little waves as he walks, peering into side rooms that he knows people that are in and getting a chorus of greetings whenever he passes one of the open wards. He's passing a room which makes me stop dead in his tracks.
"I'm going to go."Tony blurts even though every logical part of his mind is screaming at him to stay, stay for a while longer, stay and watch dopey television shows with Steve and his friends, stay to listen to Bruce talk about University options, stay to weirdly enjoy being the one to be glared at for intimation rather than the other way round.
Tony's relationship with Howard could be the source of a lot of his problems. He couldn't necessarily blame Howard for everything bad that has happened in his life, but he could very well try. Tony was a child of rebellion from the minute he could start talking back to Howard's smack talk or lift a hand up himself to defend his face from any more cuts or bruises. Psychiatrists were full of shit, telling Tony that his Troubled ways was for his Dear ol' Daddy dearest attention; It wasn't.
By the time Tony admitted to missing the rain, the water boarding began. As much as Tony is a chatterbox, a spitfire without a pause button, he wasn't a snitch. Stark Mansion was a chamber of secrets and Tony had become the gatekeeper to them all. Tony had so many things to say but his loyalty was built in stone, even if the locality was undeserving, Tony would rather die than to become a traitor to a company that his father had worked so hard to make what it is.
"Hey, you alr-"Tony pauses, following Steves wondering eye and realising that he is looking at the covered up Arc Reactor."
"No you don't."Because there's no way that Rhodey would know, or maybe there is, because Tony isn't as discreet as he wishes that he could be, and Tony is also very oblivious to tabloids and gossip for someone who spends so much of their time fiddling with ways of how to improve technology and creating shortcuts to life.
"Ha! You've obviously never played video games with me and Rhodey. He tries to tell me that I'm a sore loser, which I'm not by the way so don't be fooled by my act of acting like I am, when he got so angry that he kept getting killed that he threw my PlayStation out the window. I made him climb out our door window in the rain to retrieve it."
"Look, I really don't see why you dragged me alone to go Grocery shopping with you, Rogers, but it's honestly a waste of time because I've never set foot in a supermarket before in my life."Tony confesses, kicking his foot against the tiled flooring of the Supersized supermarket that he stood in with Steve smiling like some sort of goof behind a trolley that was half his size.
And Rhodey knows that, he knows that when Tony makes up his mind then that is that, and if Tony isn't going to speak then he has to deal with that, and instead make up to him with the soft touches and attention that he knows Tony craves. Because he's a good friend, he best of friend that Tony could ask for, and it pains him to watch him walk through the airport security away from him, with nothing but a murmur to text him and a promise to meet him at the airport.
Picking up his Phone, Tony can't help the grin that breaks out on his lips as he sees the messages left by Steve, rubbing the towel through his hair once more before dropping it into the hamper. He's dressed in a pair of legging type tracksuit bottoms, a thick hoodie thrown on in an attempt to cover the slow old the reactor and glasses on his nose, for the mean time until the dinner.
, as if feared that it's not Steve at all who answered the phone for Tony's aid."Tony, what's wrong, it's-"Steve casts a look at his alarm clock,"-3 in the morning."
"Does it matter?"His voice slurs between a mumble and a grumble, head lulling back and body a deadweight in Rhodeys hands, wanting to fall back into the mattress and allow it to swallow him whole like some unexplained, extraordinary black hole that will make him disappear, and coincidently, all of his problem too.
The grin on Rhodey's face flatters whenever he comes face to face to the damage that has been thrust upon Tony's body, from the healing scars on his face, arms and chest and the odd blue glow of the arc reactor that is now nestled in his chest. He was told by Tony of what the damages were, even send the blueprints for the arc rector, but seeing it now doesn't help the overwhelming sensation he now feels.
"Maybe I was and you've just knocked my confidence down a peg or two."His face flushes a coy pink, over the bridge of his nose and to the tips of his ears. The idea had been planted into his head a while ago back but never having the opportunity.
"Don't worry, it's a good thing, the Arc Reactor."Tony taps at the metal frame around the main body of the Arc Reactor through his jumper, going into descriptive detail of Tony's entire winter break from start to finish as if Dumm-E understands, and he does understand goddamnit, he's smarter than anyone gives him credit for."It's keeping me alive."
And it made Tony's skin itch, as if there were thousands of little ants crawling under his skin that he just couldn't get at, that his skin was getting tighter, constricting him from moving, from being himself, because he didn't feel like himself with all of this generosity. It just wasn't
"Hello Tony."She smiles, bruising a strand of her falling blonde hair out of her eyes."I've been told -"She picks up the clipboard hung beside Tony's bed,"- that you've been refusing to eat any meals that the hospital provide you. Now, what's the case with that?"
looking. And yeah okay, apart from scrape ups, a couple of scars and the arc reactor built into his chest, Tony has a pretty good body of muscles himself.
"You did this on purpose."He narrows his eyes, watching how Stephen seems to hesitate for a reply before he continues."You sprung this onto me because you know that planning is not my expertise."
For the years that Tony and Rhodey have been friends it wasn't usual for Tony to be the one inviting Rhodey over to his home in Rhode Island, because yeah they stayed in the London apartment when they visited London over the summer and one of the Winter cabins in Canada last winter, but it was always just them too, in a house that defiantly didn't feel like a home. Rhodey hadn't questioned it, he knew of how bad of a relationship Tony had with his parents - or at least knew
The male wasn't wearing a hospital gown unlike most patients but he knew he wasn't a normal technician fixing the television due to the hospital identification bracelet around his wrist and the heart monitor and IV drip attached to him. They are in a private room, the only difference being the television that hangs on the wall and the slightly bigger side.
"Look, I'll get you started-"Tony is throwing open cupboards, rummaging get through them, throwing out items that look like they belong to Tony."You can keep the place, I'll live in the workshop, god knows I'll only be here for a short while anyway, I'll pay the rent for you, and your groceries, and whatever else that you want-"
Rhodey always does stupid little things like that, like opening windows to air out a room because he knows how much Tony gets stuffy in his sleep and how he adores the smell of the ocean, the beach, the sounds of seagulls squawking or the ocean lapping up onto the shore. Or how he leaves painkillers and a glass of water on the bedside table, even if he knows Tony won't take them, he still tries.
