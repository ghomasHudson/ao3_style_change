Cas pulled into the barn and parked the atv. As he got off of the vehicle, he noticed a door he hadn't before. He walked over to it and slowly opened it.
Dean and Cas were laying on the ground in Dean's back yard watching the sky overhead. "Do you have to leave?" It was March. Cas would be leaving in just a few days. Cas rolled to his side and looked at Dean. "My parents said we have no choice. My mom got promoted and we have to move."
"No, Dean. I wanted you to fight for me. And you didn't."  Dean just stood there, staring at Castiel.
He forgot how to breath. He was lost in thought. Only snapping to reality when Sam clapped him on the back. "Ready?" He asked. He looked at him for a second, then nodded. Pushing open the door of the recruitment office, he exhaled. There were different offices for every branch. Including the national guard. "I'll be waiting out here." Sam sat down in a chair and picked up a magazine. Dean walked in to the Army office. The recruiter looked up from his computer and stood up. Dean stood in the doorway for a moment. "We talked on the phone yesterday. My name is Dean Winchester."
The camera cut to Cas' face. "Alright, we just landed in LA and our stuff is taking forever to come out on this stupid conveyor belt thing." He turned the camera to show the conveyor belt then back to his face. "If they lose my guitar, I'm gonna be so pissed. Like, I will beat a mother fucker with another mother fucker. Oh look!" He turned the camera. "There's everyone else's shit."
"Shut up and clean yourself off." They cleaned themselves off, and then the floor, and the wall. Dean looked around the room. "I hope you guys don't use blacklights in here."
Cas took his guitar off and threw his pick into the crowd. His eyes met Dean's. Dean was smiling. He whistled and Charlie was screaming. Cas smiled at them and winked before going backstage. Charlie met him back there. "Kick ass show Cassie!" She hugged him even though he was covered in sweat. He smiled as he put his guitar away. "Always." He teased. She rolled her eyes. "Hey, I'm gonna catch a ride with Meg. See you at school." She kissed his cheek and practically bounced out of the room. Cas shook his head. "Too bad you both play for different teams, you'd make a cute couple." His band-mate Adam said.
Cas jumped on beat, already a giant ball of energy. His classmates fed off it and started dancing around.
Dean kept his pace, hitting the sweet spot every time. He took Cas in his hand and stroked him. Cas' eyes fluttered, but didn't close. He moaned loudly and bit his lip. Dean's rhythm faltered briefly. He wasn't going to he able to keep this up much longer. He squeezed the tip of Cas' dick as he moved his hand over it. Cas yelled as came, shooting himself all over Dean's chest. He closed his eyes for a second, opening them and staring straight into Dean's. His eyes had turned from sapphire to ice, and it sent Dean flying. "Fuck Cas!" Dean was coming. Cas pulled him in and kissed him. "I love you." He whispered. Dean shook as he pumped out the last of his load. He took a breath and looked at Cas. "I love you, too," he said breathlessly.
Cas rolled his eyes and did as he was told. "Have you drawn a live model before?" Cas asked getting in position. Dean sat down and put the sketch book in his lap. "A few times in class. None of them were as attractive as you though." Cas looked at him. "You ever heard the saying 'flattery gets you nowhere? Whoever said that was clearly never complimented." Dean smiled and grabbed a pencil and went to work. He looked at Cas, taking in every feature.
Naomi lost it. She was doubled over in laughter. "Well that went like planned." Cas fixed his shirt and tie. Next to him, Dean was laughing too.
His morning work routine was the only repetitive thing about his job really. Some days it was quite, others it seemed like they got calls every time they just got back from one.
"Oh, wow." Seeing pretty much nothing but ass. "Well, if I were straight, I'd do whoever that ass belongs to." Again Cas rolled his eyes. The owner of the ass straightened and Charlie's jaw dropped. "Really Cas? Dean freaking Winchester? You have the hots for golden boy Winchester? The king of the school..."
"Deep breath Dean, we'll find him. I'll call the band and we'll tear that city apart til we find him. Do you think he'll..."
Dean just laughed. "Looking forward to it." He winked. Cas finished buttoning his shirt and walked over to Dean and kissed him slowly, then pulled away.
As usual, they promised to Skype, text, and call every day. The hardest part for Dean was always having to leave. "I'll be back as soon as I can." He kissed Cas on the forehead.
Cas rolled his eyes. "Are you happy with the way it turned out?" Dean asked. Cas looked at him. His blue eyes practically glowing in the light. "It turned out perfect." Cas replied. Dean's smile grew. "You're perfect." Dean said leaning in to kiss Cas on the lips. "Mr Winchester."
They stayed in that position until Dean patted Cas' leg, signaling for him to move. Cas slowly got up and collapsed on the floor, watching as Dean took off the condom and threw it in the small trash can by his desk. Dean got up and grabbed a towel and wiped Cas' mess of the both of them. "Shield your eyes." Dean said. Cas put his arm over his eyes seconds before Dean turned the light on. Both of them were still catching their breath. Cas heard Dean open a dresser drawer. Cas moved his arm and sat up, sluggishly grabbing his boxers and falling back to the floor so he could put them on. Dean laughed. "That good?" Cas looked at him, watching him pull a shirt over his head. "I'm pretty sure I just died and went to heaven." Cas replied as he pulled his jeans on. Dean smiled and shook his head as he finished dressing.
"Dean, I know you would never do anything to hurt Cas. But put yourself in his shoes. He's had nothing but bad luck since the day he was born and he's come to expect it. Especially when things go good for awhile."
Cas was just about to have a little more fun when the waitress arrived with their food. Dean laughed and kissed him.
Dean unfolded his, though he knew it by heart. He had written it weeks ago, so he kept his eyes on Cas. "Since I can remember, you have always been by my side. Even through that ten year span. I must have drawn a million pictures and written a million letters for you and to you in that time frame, which are still hidden in my room." A few people chuckled. "I may not have know what you meant to me when we were ten and thought we were superheros, but I do now. Now that we're older, I get to fall in love with you all over again every morning when I wake up next to you. I love you Castiel. Thank you for being my sidekick."
Dean spun around and decked Zachariah square in the face, sending him down to the ground. Dean stooped next to Zachariah as he sputtered. Zachariah’s nose was bleeding.
Cas swallowed his bite. "Probably later this week." He didn't sound very enthusiastic about it like he normally would be.
Dean made a low rumbling noise, nuzzling Cas' neck where the mate mark was. Cas dropped his head onto Dean's shoulder.
Dean looked around the stables, finding Crowley handing his horse over to a man. He walked over to him. "Hey," he spun Crowley around. "I saw what you did to my boyfriend. You have a blade in your whip. You hit my boyfriend with it. Let me tell you something, if he didn't tell me not to beat the living shit out of you trust me, you wouldn't be standing right now. If I ever see your face at another track, I will find you and you won't know what hit you." He patted Crowley roughly on the shoulder. "Good talk." Crowley turned as Dean walked away. "And uh, who exactly, are you?"
After everyone was full and Dean ran out of stories, they decided to call it a night. Dean was the last to leave. He shrugged into his favorite leather jacket as he stepped out of the diner. Cas was standing there looking at his car. He turned to Dean. "Yours?" Dean pulled a cigarette out and lit it. "Yeah. High school graduation present from my dad." Cas nodded. "Well, thanks for the food." He turned to walk away. "Hey!" Dean called after him. "Can I give you a ride somewhere or something? A hotel? If you want to save money, my couch is free." Cas turned. "Offering a stranger cigarettes, food, and I ride. Not planning to kill me are you Dean?" The way he said Dean's name sent a chill up his spine. Cas closed the gap between them an inch away from Dean's face. "Or...are you queer?" Dean swallowed. He laughed and shook his head. "Well, I offered." He started for his car. Cas followed and stood at the passenger side. Dean looked up at him. "Hey, you offered." Dean shook his head and got in. Opening the passenger door for Cas. He climbed in and Dean started the car. "Where to?" Dean asked. Cas thought for a moment. "Your couch is free?" He asked in reply. Dean nodded. "Free it is then."
Dean straightened his bow tie in the mirror. "You look so handsome honey." Mary fixed his collar. Dean smiled at her. His dark blue tux fit perfectly. Mary smiled back. "When did you know for sure, about Cas and I?" He asked. Mary's smile grew. "Since you two were ten. You two were sleeping in the living room one night and I came down to check on you. I saw your tattoos glowing." She smoothed out his sleeves. "Why didn't you say anything when I was thirteen?" She looked at him and kissed him on the cheek. "Because I knew you would find him."
"Thank you." He hung up the phone and ran to the front door, throwing it open just as the paramedics got to it. He ran back to Cas’ room, where they immediately got to work. His eyes were dilated to pinpoints and his breathing was even slower. His pulse was almost nonexistent.
Near the end of the song, Dean walked out. He looked out at the crowd and put his fingers to his lips. He stood right behind Cas and put his hands in his pockets.
"I mean, I've kind of been trying to avoid the reality of it but in a few week, you're going to college and I'm going to LA. What if we just, Idon't know, drift apart?"
“Hey. So I just checked the inventory. We're good on perishables for now, but we have next to nothing for toiletries, and Ellen is running out of medical supplies.” Chuck said, showing Dean his list.
"So you got me down here...to see if I'd patch things over with Dean?! What if this plan of yours didn't work?"
Cas turned to the sound booth where the band had been running through the music. "Think we can lay one down?" They all nodded. Cas clapped his hands. "Let's get to it, then."
They walked across the parking lot, a few people already recognizing them and taking pictures. Some asked Cas for an autograph and a picture, which he happily obligated.
"Well hell boy, your dad's a fuckin' hero son! Good man." He looked over his shoulder. "Put Winchester in the 101st." He turned back to Dean. "Grab your bags kid. You're with me."
“Dammit...” Dean looked at all the face down cards, choosing carefully. He picked one up, clearly it wasn't a four. He sighed and set the cards down, running a hand down his face. Cas looked at him.
"Alright, you win." Cas laughed. Dean let go. Cas handed him the picture. "Come on, let's get inside before we get sick." Dean put his arm around Cas and they walked back inside.
“What school is in Dallas?” Benny squinted at the envelope for a second before Cas grabbed it from him.
Halfway through, Cas got up and laid on the bed. He put his hands behind his head and sang along with the rest of the song, smiling.
Dean saw the kid immediately. He was crying in the back of the ambulance. Next to him, was a guy named Castiel.
Dean walked through the door. Charlie jumped up. Dean just put a finger to his lips. She nodded. He closed the door. "He's been singing his ass off all day." Charlie whispered as they walked up the stairs. Dean smiled.
Cas sat back in his seat and looked at Dean. Jeez, he had missed him. "Dean, are you suggesting that we go out, say fuck the paparazzi minions, and make a scene?" Cas raised his eyebrows at Dean.
Dean walked Cas back to the wall, pinning him to the brick building. He brushed his lips up Cas' neck, across his jaw, then to his lips. "Because I'm gonna take my time with you."
Dean rolled his eyes. "People can see us you." Cas smiled that crooked smile of his. "And since when has that stopped either of us?"
"Yeah. I haven't told my mom yet. I just don't want her freaking out. The cops did catch him and charge him with assult with a deadly weapon. With his record, he'll be in prison for a long time." They moved to the couch.
Cas pulled out of Dean and flipped him over, pulling him up at the same time so that he was flush against him. The glass table shattered as soon as Dean was off of it. Cas shrugged.
Dean put his phone down, his ear still ringing from Charlie's shrieks of excitement. She would be getting Meg. Next thing he knew, he was tackled to the bed and Cas invaded his mouth. "You are the best boyfriend ever. In the history of ever."Cas showered Dean with kisses. Dean laughed. "I know." Cas got up. "I have to tell my mom! She's gonna be so amped!"Cas practically flew to his phone and called Naomi. Dean pulled some clothes on and watched Cas. He was talking a mile a minute and his hands were all over the place, which is how you could tell if he was really excited about something. Dean pulled his phone out and called his mom.
It was a typical afternoon at the Winchester house. Dean and Cas had been out on Whiskey and River since school let out for the day, mostly racing each other out back by the pond. Cas won, like normal. They trotted back to the front of the house.
Cas was extremely pale and there were dark circles around his eyes. Dean had never seen him this bad before. It had never been this bad. Not even when they were teenagers. Dean knew there was a chance Cas might relapse, that he could deal with, but an overdose? He really didn't know if it was an accident or not. Right now, he really didn't care.
"That I forgot about you?" His eyes flicked up to Cas. "I could never forget about you." He looked back at the paper and picked it up. Opening it, he examined the contents. It was a drawing. Not just any drawing, his drawing. "You kept it." He said quietly. The drawing was of two superheros with the same blue mark on their hands and said: "Secret superhero best friends forever" Dean looked up at Cas who was smiling.
"Okay..." Dean did as Cas asked and let him lay back on the bed. Cas wrapped his legs high on Dean's waist and pulled him in, gripping the headboard and moving his hips so that Dean went in deeper. Dean smirked.
The giant auditorium erupted with cheers. Cas let out his breath and smiled. All the members stood up. Dean gave Cas a hug and a quick kiss. Wildfire started playing and the video played on stage.
Cas looked up then looked around the room as Dean asked. He looked at the bed. Dean's favorite blanket. He looked at his nightstand, a picture of them in the old house. He looked at the wall, a picture of Dean in his dress uniform. Finally, he looked at the closet. Dean's favorite shirt was the first thing he had seen. Cas smiled, more tears running down his face. He looked down and continued reading.
He opened his eyes and blinked everything into focus. Forms turned to his friends sitting next to him.
They hadn't been able to just be together in a long time, even before they broke up. Sometime around three in the morning, they staggered into their hotel room. The door was barely shut and they didn't even turn the lights on when Dean shoved Cas against the door. They tore at each others clothes and Dean lead Cas to the bed, pushing him down onto the mattress. Sounds of heavy breathing, grunt, and moans filled the room as they brought each other into blissful completion. Cas and Dean passed out in each others arms in a mess of blankets.
Cas smiled and scooted in closer. He kissed Dean on the nose.Dean stirred a little, grunting as he woke up. He opened his eyes."Hi, creeper."
He finally found the cafeteria. He wasn't really hungry, but he didn't want Cas to get mad. He had never really seen Cas mad, but he imagined it probably wasn't something he wanted to see. He still felt horrible for yelling at him, he kinda deserved it if Cas did get mad at him for not eating or whatever. He sighed and sat down with his sandwich since they didn't have burgers. He sighed and took a bite, forcing himself to eat. He tried to remember the name of the doctor working the night shift, just in case. Miller? No...Mills. That was it. Jody Mills. Maybe he should go find her and ask her to run some tests or something. He felt absolutely
"If he didn't just do that, I would have." The band laughed. "Alright, down to business. So we're gonna stand over there in the front, then take a few pictures on the stairs over there.”
Cas took a deep breath before getting out of the limo. He met up with the band and they walked down the red carpet. Flashing lights, reporters, and screaming fans all present. The band stopped and took photos with some fans and sighed autographs. One reporter from people magazine stopped Cas for an interview.
They walked out to the parking lot. "Next stop, graduation. Can you believe high school is almost over?" Dean hopped on the hood of the Impala and sat don front of him and put his arms on Cas' shoulders and kissed him. "Have you picked a college yet?"
"Well, I'm about to tour for a few months. Then I'll probably get back in the studio and get started on the next album."
“Jeez, fine! There was a guy in college that I hit it off with pretty well for a few months until he graduated. Law major.”
It may be a sin to kill a Mockingbird, but even Mockingbirds get broken wings. He put the bike on it's kickstand and took off his helmet, throwing it to the ground. He walked up the dirt path and right to the cliff. He sat on the edge and looked at the gold promise ring on his finger. How could Dean even want to stay with someone so fucked up?
Dean whipped around. "He's breathing..." It was barely a whisper. He stepped back into the room as they moved Cas to a stretcher.
After dinner they walked to the theater. Cas bought the tickets and handed them to Dean. "You guys go in. There's something I need to do real quick." He gave Dean a quick kiss and walked off. "Any idea what he's talking about?" Dean asked the girls. They shrugged. "Maybe he has to pee." Meg said. Charlie linked arms with Dean. "Come on, let's go get our seats. He'll find us."
"Thanks, Leah." He slid a folded up fifty dollar bill to her. She smiled and directed the other hostess to seat them.
The reporter turned to the camera. "Well, folks, sounds like we're in for a treat. Sheila, what's going on inside the theater?"
"Calm down, son. It's just Dean." She opened the door. "Oh! Wait! Don't answer yet!" He ran back up the stairs. "You have to answer it like those stupid movies on tv!" He yelled down to her. She shut the door. "What?!"
John left for work, Sam for school. The neighbor was supposed to be in every so often through out the day to check on him. When the neighbor left for the last time that day, Dean got out of bed and went into the bathroom and grabbed the bottle of pain killers. Thinking about all the new comments that had popped up on his profile after he was raped saying he probably like it and he was nasty and should die. As he shoved a handful of pills in his mouth he thought about how it would all be over soon. That he wouldn't be suffering.
“Yeah well, you know me.” He drained the rest of his coffee. “I'm gonna go put some real clothes on and go into town. I need to email the moving company about getting my stuff out here.
"You're such a smart ass. Gonna pay for that." Dean pulled himself off of Cas and swiped the precum from his own cock, slicking it up. He lined up with Cas' hole and pushed in. Cas arched his back off the bed.
He threw his pencil down and picked up his cell phone. Maybe Dean still had the same number. Maybe he was thinking about Cas just as much as Cas was thinking about him. Or maybe...Dean had moved on. What if Dean had moved on? Was with someone else?
“Everyone but me.” Cas put his hands in his pockets and stepped to the side. “I was living my life, having a decent time in my comfortable apartment and shiny office and you all were here. Suffering. I’m an ass. I honestly don’t know how you can all be so welcoming after what I did.”
Cas looked at it. A white gold band with small diamonds all the way around. "It's beautiful Dean. I love it." Dean smoothed out his hair. "Really? I wasn't exactly sure what to get..." Cas grabbed a chain from Dean's swing and pulled him closer. "It's perfect. I love it."
"Um... yeah. Yeah I am. I'm also going to go to that race. You should, too. Mom!" Gabriel looked at Naomi, who had been silent the entire time. "Will you be joining me?"
"Well if that's the case..." He grabbed Dean and spun him around, grabbing his hip with one hand and pushed him down with the other, bending Dean over. Dean put his hands on the tub. Cas put his tip on Dean's hole, working it over before slowly pushing himself inside. Dean pushed himself back. Cas closed his eyes and moaned, head falling back. He grabbed Dean's hips and rolled his own, moving Dean in rhythm. It didn't take him long to hit the soft cluster of nerves. He pushed into it, causing Dean to moan loudly. "Fuck Cas!" He moaned. "Well, if you insist." Cas smiled. He pulled out halfway and pushed in hard, hitting Dean's prostate. He heard Dean's nails scratch the tub as he moaned even louder.Cas smiled to himself. He drove hard and fast, obliterating Dean with every hit on that bundle of nerves deep inside. Dean felt himself coming undone; his head was spinning and a painful pleasure was overcoming his body. Dean braced himself and pushed back hard, almost knocking Cas over. Dean couldn't talk, he was too far gone, so the only way to get Cas to do what he needed was to show him.
"I've tried them Cas..." Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. "I'm waiting Dean." Mary finally passed the potatoes to John who wanted nothing to do with hearing about his eldest son's sex life. Dean looked at Mary. Yes mom. I did. I though I shouldn't knock him up first try." Dean said sarcastically. Cas choked on his potatoes. Sam was dying with laughter. "What's for dessert Mary?" John asked as Dean stood up, totally done with the situation. "Yes! Dessert sounds nice! Would you like me to bring you some Dean?" Mary smiled, pleased. "I'm proud of you honey!" She called as Dean retreated up the stairs. "Oh my God! Mom! Just stop!" He called. He heard Cas right on his heels. "Use another condom Dean!" Sam yelled. "Shut up Sam!"
"Hey, you're the one who brought it out of him in the shower apparently."  Cas walked back to the edge of the porch and set his beer down. He pushed of the porch with his feet and did a back flip in the air, landing on his feet. He straightened with a smile. "Boom bitches. That's right. I still got it." Cas put on his aviators.
He slammed the door and walked to the bedroom, taking off his tie and blazer, leaving them on the floor. He paced around the room. He stopped in front of the dresser and pushed everything off and punched a hole in the TV then grabbed it and threw it to the floor. He flipped the mattress over and broke the headboard.
He had light brown hair and blue eyes, not like Cas'. Jaxon's eyes were almost gray. As good looking as he is, Dean couldn't understand why he didn't have a girlfriend. When they got to the bar, it exploded with cheers. Dean smiled and bowed. "Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all year. Please, no autographs." Jaxon laughed and clapped him on the back. "Come on, first round's on me."
They walked out of the store and Cas checked both off the list. "What next?" Cas ran down the list. "Venue?" He looked at Dean. He was met by a quick kiss. "Sounds good."
Cas looked up at Dean, straightening himself out. He tipped his head up slightly and took over Dean's mouth in a slow, deep kiss. He opened his eyes in time to see Dean's eyelids flutter. Cas brought his hips in to Dean's and noticed that Dean had an erection. A sly grin crossed Cas' face. He whispered to Dean. "You know, this is a hotel."
One of the paramedics pushed him back down. He took the neck brace off. Hands were all over him, trying to keep him on the stretcher. All of them failing. "Dean, what are you doing? You have to go to the hospital!" Dean shook free of the paramedics. "No, I really don't."
“I can’t..I can’t do this…” He lightly pushed Anna away and stood up from the bed, pulling his jeans back on. “What the hell, Dean? There’s never been a problem before…” He hung his head. “I know. I know. And I’m sorry. I just..” He sighed and looked at her. “I just can’t. Here’s for the room. Sorry.” He put the payment for the room on the table by the door and walked out.
Later that night, Dean was lying in bed. Fully intending not to go to group therapy. It was at this time he decided to try again. He got up and walked over to the window. He pulled on the bars, checking the sturdiness. He pulled down on them then he pulled himself up. The bars held his weight with no sign of protest. He let go and grabbed the sheet off the bed and looked at the top of the bars, it was higher than he could reach. He went over to the other side of the bed and grabbed the chair that they had forgotten to take out after visiting hours, Dean thought that it was stupid of them. But then again, they didn't know what he was about to do. He set the chair in front of the bars. Standing on it, he tied the sheet to the top, then tied it around his neck. Only a few more minutes of suffering. He hung one foot off the chair and kicked it away with the other, his feet didn't touch the floor. The chair tipped over sideways and hit the floor. Any second now. He would pass out first. then no more suffering. No more nightmares. He blacked out.
Fresh tears spilled over as Dean made his way to Cas. He pushed the chair right next to the bed and sank down in it, taking Cas' hand. With the other hand, he ran his fingers through Cas' hair.
By the end of the second week, they took off the restraints (But he was on watch every second of the day) and allowed visitors again. Sam would come in every day after school and tell him everything that has been happening. He told Dean that their dad couldn't stand to see him like this and couldn't bring himself to visit. Dean was surprised that Sam even visited. After all, he did find Dean half dead on the bathroom floor. He couldn't bring himself to look at Sam, and still refused to talk. Sam told him Wyatt was arrested and his trial was to be determined. This held no comfort whatsoever.
Cas sipped at his coffee and watched the sunrise over the hill in the distance. He had missed this place, and his friends, and... Dean. Although he hated admitting it. He took another sip of coffee as Adam walked past him into the house. As he and Adam exchanged greetings, Cas' head gaze caught Dean out by the barn, doing his morning work. He was wearing those worn jeans again, the ones that seemed to be barely hanging on to life. Cas bit his lip. "This is absurd," he said out loud to himself.
Castiel moved around the table. "So what, we get along for our friends sakes?" He sunk a ball in the side pocket. Dean took a drink of beer. "Until you leave and we can go back to pretending the other doesn't exist." Castiel looked at him. "I guess I deserved that."
Cas stepped back from the podium and the students and parents erupted into applause. He smilednat everyone and then found his seat again.Mr Surley took the stage once more. Calling out names in alphabetical order. "Charlie Bradbury."   Charlie got up and went to the stage. Cas, Dean, and Meg cheered for her as she received her diploma. A picture of Charlie as a kid appeared on the screen behind the stage. Then a picture of her now, sitting in front of her computer. Smiling at the camera. A few other kid's were called.
“Why? This is like the safest place in the world to have a pup.” Alec looked at Cas then back to Dean.
They all hung out until the fire was almost dead, then decided to call it a night. Benny, Adam, Charlie, and Meg all piled in Benny’s truck to go to their respective homes to sleep. Dean on the other hand, had other plans, and none of them included sleep. As soon as he closed the bedroom door, he pulled Cas in and kissed him, slowly. He thrust his tongue into Cas' mouth and brought his hips to his own, pushing him up against the door to the room. Cas ran his hands under Dean's shirt, feeling his way around his chest and down his torso, undoing the button on Dean's jeans when he got there. Cas slipped his hands just inside of the fabric of Dean's jeans and boxers, gripping the skin on Dean's hips and grinding himself against the other man’s cock. Dean pulled his shirt over his head and let it fall to the floor, then walked Cas back to the bed. He lowered Cas slowly, never breaking the kiss. When Cas was finally on his back, Dean worked at his own jeans, then Cas’, sliding them off of Cas' hips and thighs slowly until they were on the floor, kissing his chest and torso as he worked, stopping only to nip at the skin as he passed over. Dean bit his lip as he heard Cas let out a soft moan and felt him lift his hips from the bed. Dean smiled as he pinned Cas' hips to the bed. He moved to Cas' neck, gently biting as he went. Cas pushed his hips against Dean's, dragging his erection against his partner's. His breath hitched.
Dean took one of Cas' hands and spun him around, the blinding flash indicated Mary took yet another picture. Dean pulled Cas closer and kissed him gently on the lips. Yet another flash went off. Dean looked at his mom. "You're gonna break that thing will all these pictures." He teased. Mary smiled and pushed him gently.
There it was. "Good. It was really good." Even though the party was a week ago. He forgot he told her he was going. He could hear the smile in her voice. "Does that mean what I think it means?" He smiled. "Yes ma'am."
Cas shrugged. "Oh it's horrible. We hate it. Always fighting and shit." He laughed. "Uh, really, it's great. Nothings changed. The only thing that's changed is I dropped half a million for a piece of paper."
Everyone had left. Cas was always the last to leave. It was around midnight when he locked up and walked to his motorcycle. He swung his leg over. Before starting it he looked up to see Dean's car still sitting there. Dean was sitting on the hood. "Thought you would have gone home." Dean slid off the Impala and walked to him. "Figured I'd wait for you, see if you wanted me to hold on to your guitar." Cas had the guitar strapped to his back. "I have a key to Charlie's car. I can just put it in there." Dean stepped in front of his bike. "I don't mine Cas. It'll save you a trip." Cas looked at him for a moment. He slid the guitar off his back and handed it to Dean. "Take care of it like it's your car." Dean took it and stepped even closer to Cas til they were inches apart. "I'll take good care of it. Also, it'll give me an excuse to see you again." Cas looked at him, tilting his head.
Cas jumped up on the table and cheered. The rest of the people in the bar were going crazy and had gathered around the stage. Suddenly, Cas yelled over the crowd.
"Dammit. Well, it's gonna be a long night." Cas said as the car slowed to a stop. Then he looked at Dean.
Benny nodded as he reached up into the locker he shared with Cas. “It goes. You know the drill.” As the boys gathered their things for their first class, Cas dropped a stack of papers.
"Damn right, I am." Dean pushed past the remaining workers and climbed into the back of the ambulance, sitting on the bench next to Cas. The whole ride they continued to work on Cas. The only thing Dean could do was hold Cas' hand.
"Okay, okay Winchester. I have a reputation to keep." Cas looked Dean over. "So uh... what's with the jersey? Thought it was gonna be blue and silver?"
The ride was silent. Cas and his father weren’t big talkers when it came to being around each other anyway, but this was different. Tense. Finally, Zachariah spoke.
"Like hell you are. You were uninvited the other day. Or was my right hook to subtle for you? Do I need to spell it out in crayon?"
"Enough of this! You're coming with me. We are getting you help." He grabbed Dean by the arm. Dean stood planted in his spot. "Like hell I am."
Cas moved to his knees and cupped Dean's face with his hands, moving his head so he was looking right at him. “Listen to me. None of that...there was nothing you could do. The Betas are fucking sick and twisted. I know if you were given the choice you would have walked away, but you couldn't you were trapped in that situation.”
She led them to a table near the stage area. There was a local cover band setting up for the night. Cas watched them as they put their gear in place.
Cas moved back to the bed and sat down as Dean sat up. "What time is it?" He looked for his phone. Cas whistled and Dean looked at him. Cas was holding his phone, he tossed it to him. "What are you doing with my phone?" Cas smiled at him and raised his eyebrows. "Texting." Dean unlocked his phone.
"Dean. You should go wherever you want. You don't have to go to UCLA just because I'll be in LA." Dean laughed. "I've been waiting to stare at that ass all day." He smiled. He snaked his hands down to Cas' waist. Cas smiled. "Well then take me home babe." Dean slid off the hood of the car and stepped to the driver's side door, never breaking eye contact.
He made it just in time. "Jeez where the hell have you been? Late to everything!" Charlie shoved his cap and gown in his arms. "Yeah, yeah, blow me Red." He put the gown on. "Wait a minute Cas, aren't you valedictorian?"   Cas looked at her. "Fuck! I forgot to write a speech!"
"It's awesome." Cas smiled as he looked around. "Dean get your ass in here and look at this!"Dean walked up next to Cas, who took his hand and kissed it. "Alright, guys, I need the band over here for a briefing." Cas raised an eyebrow. "Kinky." Dean shoved him. "Go do... whatever it is that you're doing, hot shot."
“Cas, no matter how complicated it may be, I want to know. I really wasn't going to push the subject but whatever is going on, I don't like what it's doing to you.”
Dean rolled his eyes. "Nice to see the crash didn't affect you at all." He put his jacket on and walked over to Cas. "I'll be back later." He kissed his lips. Cas grabbed his jacket and pulled him closer and down until Dean was on top of him. "Cas, I really have to go." He breathed into Cas' lips. Cas smiled but didn't let go. He just brushed his lips down Dean's neck. After what felt like hours, Cas let go.
He sat up and grabbed the syringe off the nightstand and looked at it. He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair then took the cap off the needle. "Fuck it." A few minutes later, he put his head back on the pillow, closing his eyes and letting the sensation take him over.
After hair and make up, they left the trailer and walked into the hotel. "This place is for sure creepy."
"You sent him away from me because him being here and being himself would damage your spotless reputation. To have your son stay here and be with me was the worst thing that could possibly happen to you, so you shipped him out."
It rained that night. It was around ten at night. Dean was looking out his window remembering when he and Sam used to play in the rain. The memory seemed so distant. Like it happened in another lifetime. "You like the rain?" Dean almost jumped. He turned around and looked at Castiel then nodded. Cas smiled. "Come on." He stood up and walked to the door, pausing to look back at Dean. Dean looked at him in confusion. "Just trust me." Dean followed him out of the room and down the hall. The place was so empty at night you would think it was abandoned. He followed Castiel to a part of the facility he hadn't seen, which wasn't surprising since it's only the second time he's left his room. Castiel pulled out his employee I.D. and swiped it. The door clicked and he opened it to reveal a fenced yard. He allowed Dean to step out first. He was met by the smell of wet earth. He loved the smell. He looked back at Castiel. "Go on." He said half laughing. Dean stepped out of the protection of the covered porch, into the rain. Getting soaked almost immediately. He looked up at the sky then closed his eyes, feeling every drop as it hit his face. He held his arms out. He suddenly felt like a kid again. No. Not a kid. He felt like
Cas let out a strangled yell as he finished. They stayed there for a minute or so before he pulled out and grabbed some toilet paper and cleaned himself and Dean off. They were still catching their breath as they pulled up their pants.
"I hate you both." Cas said as he cleared the table. "But that does give me an idea for Desperate Measures. Well, when we actually sign with someone and start playing shows."
Dean rolled his eyes and opened the door. "At least try to behave." Cas smiled and drew a halo around his head.
Cas walked into the studio and quickly realized, of course, nothing got done while he was away. So he cracked his knuckles and got down to business. "Alright guys, album time." For the better part of three hours Cas was running around the studio putting music tracks on the sound board and writing lyrics to put to said music. Not to mention his agent had been blowing up his phone about the events of the previous night which had taken the media by storm.
They all walked out together and Dean stood next to the Impala. "So boyfriend huh? Well, he's cute." Naomi smiled at Cas. Cas returned the smile. Cas talked her into staying at the roadhouse for at least one night. She followed the boys. Cas called Charlie on the way and told her everything. It still sounded weird to say and he was still blown away that he actually has his mom back. The woman he hasn't seen in five years. Right now, sitting next to Dean and looking in the side mirror seeing his mom close behind, it was the happiest he's been since he was twelve years old.
"It is." Mary laughed. "The day you two decided to play house, you made Dean wear an apron." Dean took the picture out. Cas grabbed it from Dean's hand. "I'll take that!" He laughed.
He tore out of the driveway and down the street, leaving a trail of smoke in his wake. Dean stood on their driveway with his hands in his hair, starring in the direction that Cas left in. He couldn't move. What the hell had just happened? Dean wracked his brain for what to do. He ran his hands down his face and neck, realizing that he was still in his tux from the awards ceremony. He grabbed for his phone, which was in his pocket, and dialed Charlie as he climbed into his car.
"This isn't a sickness or some stupid lifestyle. It's not a choice. The only choice I have is who to give my heart and soul to. Just like a straight person. But I'm not straight. I like men. More specifically, I like Cas. From the second I saw him in the diner-"
Dean scrolled down. "What is my dream car?" Cas looked at him. "You own your dream car. A 67 Chevy Impala. What's mine?"
He grabbed the keys. Dean turned around, grabbed something, and handed it to Cas. "It's not your original helmet. It was damn near cracked in half. So I got you a new one." Cas took the helmet and smiled. He handed Dean his crutches and swung his broken leg over the bike and started it up. She roared to life. Dean opened the garage door and Cas used his right foot to push it out. When he was out, Dean closed the door and walked to the Impala, putting Cas' crutches in the back seat then got in. Once Cas heard the Impala roar to life, he revved his bike, put it in gear and took off down the road. Dean was right behind him. Cas had to admit, he was a little nervous being back on his bike so soon after he wrecked it. He thought it was totaled. Thank goodness Dean was good at fixing cars. As soon as he was out of town, he hit the throttle. Going as fast as he possibly could. The bike topped out at 120. Dean was still right behind him. He weaved back and forth, checking the traction of the tires. Dean must have put new ones on. He slowed down and pulled into the Roadhouse, which had a few cars. Cas parked on the side and hopped off. Dean parked next to him. He got out and handed Cas his crutches. Cas grabbed them then took his helmet off with one hand. "Tell me you did not just drive that bike here Castiel James." Cas jumped and turned around to see Ellen with her arms folded.
"You bitches are awesome. Thank you and goodnight!" He trotted to the back of the stage and into the curtain legs. He saw Charlie with her laptop, cords coming out of it into the ports in the stage. "You recorded it?"
He swung his leg over and leveled the bike out and handed Dean the spare helmet. Dean strapped the helmet on and took his place on the seat behind Cas. Cas turned the key, bringing the engine to life. He revved it a couple of times, turning to Dean and kissing the air at him.
"Hm." Dean didn't say anything, just hummed his response. He was lost in those blues again and it was getting more and more difficult to hide it. Castiel smiled.
“We added the kitchen areas for the Omegas and the families so they don't have to leave for meals if they don't want to.” Ellen said from the doorway.
Cas rejoined the band and they walked into the building, posing for a few pictures and signing some things.
"This might not be easy to see, he's pretty busted up and has a tube to help him breathe until he can on his own."
Then he found the email of the cover art and picked out a few. Now it was time to write the thank yous. Cas went into detail on a few. After he was finished with that, he sent it to the label along with the album tracks. "Well now that that's done, time to do some interviews. Which we have to go all around the country to do." The first interview was a local radio station. Then they had an interview with MTV where the were giving a performance.
Dean rolled over and shut off his alarm. The clock read five thirty. He sat up and ran his hands through his hair and rubbed his face. Finally, he got up and got dressed.
Halfway through, Dean looked at Cas. Thinking about everything that had happened in the past year. In the beginning, Dean thought nothing would ever go back to normal. Yet here he was, sitting on the couch with Cas watching a movie like a normal couple.
Dean inhaled sharply and drummed his fingers on the bed. He looked at his phone. It was about twelve thirty in the morning. Suddenly, he had an idea. He needed to prove to himself that he was over Cas. For good. He grabbed his phone and thumbed through his contacts, stopping at one after a minute or two. “Perfect.” He hit the call button. The phone rang for a few seconds. He drummed his fingers on his thigh. Maybe she wouldn’t pick up. Maybe she was sleeping or already out or…
Dean walked out on to the field, helmet in hand. There were cameras everywhere since this was being televised. Before the game, he would always be nervous, but as soon as he stepped out onto the field he fed off the crowd. The adrenaline rush. Dean looked at the Lawrence crowd, the sea of maroon and white. His eyes scanned for Cas, finding him eating nachos with Charlie and drinking a soda, wearing Dean's home jersey over his hoodie. His mom and Sam were wearing matching hoodies that said "Lawrence Football" with Dean's number on the front. Dean smiled and put his helmet on, joining the huddle. "Alright guys, let's party." He said after telling them the play. They all took their places. Dean right behind a kid named Dylan. He called out the play down the line, in this case it was "Blue 75" and looked down the line making sure everyone was where they were supposed to be. "Hut!" The ball was snapped. Dean caught it and took three long steps back. His eyes scanned for his men, finally finding Cole. He threw the ball and a second later, Cole caught it and took of down the field. Making it to the fifteen before being tackled. The crowd was on their feet. Dean ran down to the fifteen yard line. He told his guys another play and they lined up. He called the play and everyone was in place. "Hut!" He caught the ball and faked pitched it to Cole, instead he pitched it to Benny. Benny ran it in for a touchdown. The crowd was roaring. Dean looked over at the coach and held his index finger up, signaling for one more. "One more! One more!" He called out. His players lined up again. Dean called out the play. "Hut!" He caught the ball. One of the other team got lose and ran towards Dean. He needed to get rid of the ball and fast. He ran back a few yards, finding Cole in the end zone. As soon as the ball left his hand, he was taken down, hitting the ground hard. Cole caught it and the ref signaled touchdown. Dean got up slowly. "You good brotha?" Benny asked. Dean took his helmet off and smiled. "Yeah, I'm good.  He was a lightweight." He patted Benny on the back as they walked off the field. They band started playing and Dean found Cas and Charlie hip bumping each other in the stands. He rolled his eyes and smiled. "Good job Winchester! Keep it up!" Coach shook him lightly by the shoulder pads before Dean sat down.
When they got to the house, Cas' phone rang as soon as he walked through the door. He put it on speaker.
Again this chapter broke a record with 6,163 words! Thank you guys for giving me the inspiration to keep going!
The Alphas nodded and went to move into position. Dean grabbed a few magazines for each weapon and got down on one knee, aiming at the tree line. The Betas slowly trickled out, weapons drawn.
"Yeah, it's pretty crazy. I mean I had no idea that many people even listen to our music. The best artist nomination did come as a shock and I almost crapped my pants and threw up, but I just feel honored that the fans love us that much and we love them for it. I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for them. Even if we don't win anything, we'll still give a kick ass performance."
As they got him on his side, Alec grabbed some medical gauze, handing some to Cas. “Put pressure on it.”
It was around four when the movie ended. Dean pulled up in front of the house and turned the car off. "That was fun." He smiled, getting out. He walked around and opened Cas' door. "Yeah, it was. We should do this more often." They walked up the path and Dean unlocked the door. "We could have a date night every Saturday." He suggested, opening the door. "Yeah, that sounds good."
Cas shook his head. "Never told anyone. Not even Charlie. She knew something was up though, as usual."
As they made there way inside, the party was already in full swing. A few jocks were doing keg stands, while others were making out with girls and hoping to get laid.
Throughout the song, he stopped and corrected what he messed up, getting more frustrated with each mistake. He ran his hand down his face and looked at the ceiling. "Alright from the last chorus one more time Cas."
His phone buzzed at four in the morning. He rolled over and answered. "Dean, there is a two hour time difference remember?"
"Sshh don't worry. I'm not gonna whip it out. Just needed a little more space to... ahh, there we go." Cas smiled a mischievous smile as he watched Dean bite his lip when he got his fingertips on the shaft, just barely inside Dean's jeans.
"Hell yeah! Let's do this!" Cas took out his guitar and strapped it on. The song started. Cas looked out at the crowd. There had to be upwards of three thousand people. A lot of them were holding their phones up, recording. Josh started singing.
Cas looked at Dean with a huge smile on his face. Dean kissed him quickly and then looked around the room. Mary and Naomi were almost in a full on ugly cry and were passing a box of tissues between them.
"And now, performing their new single 'Celebrity Status' with two awards under their belt, Join The Hunt!"
Cas woke up to sunlight drifting into the room. He blinked his eyes, adjusting to the light. Once he had adjusted to the brightness, he rolled over. A smile crept across his face. Dean was still sound asleep, his face mushed into the pillow and his sandy hair a mess. Cas pulled himself closer, resting his forehead on Dean's and their noses touching. He had really, really missed Dean. And it wasn't just the sex, which was amazing as usual. Watching his partner sleep, Castiel came to terms with how much he loved Dean. He kissed him softly, and then snuggled in for a little while longer.
Dean bit his lip, a loud moan still escaped from the words. Cas moans grew more frequent until "God, I'm coming Dean!" Cas body shook with sheer pleasure. Dean felt a warmth pool up in his stomach until he too, came. His body went rigid, both still moaning.
"And how exactly did he do that again? Was it when he dropped his dreams to be a big time businessman for you or when he manned up and decided on his own future?"
He had a few close calls. One that landed him in the hospital for a few weeks. Cas wasn't happy when Dean finally called. "Why are you so reckless?!" He yelled into the phone. Dean held his phone away from his ear. Adam was sitting next to him laughing. "I'm not being reckless Cas, I'm doing my job. I'm fine by the way." Cas sighed. "What happened?" He asked. Dean was silent for a moment.
“Well, I'm working on a new project and I need some help. I wondered if you might be able to lend a hand?”
burger for Cas. Cas looked around the restaurant. There were definitely a lot more people in the place now and the seats were pretty much full. Cas downed another shot and began to wonder how he could stir up some trouble. In between songs, Cas figured he'd introduce himself to the band. He got up and walked over to the lead singer.
"Well it could be the fact that my video got shut down because Dean and I are gay. And the video was gonna be me watching him from a distance blah blah blah." He put his face back in the pillow. "The school won't let me do it because people might get uncomfortable. And now people are looking at me like my gayness will rub off on them. Other than that, everything is great."
Cas pulled Dean down next to him. "I know." He kissed him. "I have a surprise for you when we get to the studio today."
Dean watched them file out of his room and saw the door close, only for it to open again with Adam's face peering through and giving Dean a thumbs up. Dean gave Adam the middle finger, and Adam finally left.
They ate mostly in silence. Dean was actually a little confused. Cas had never been this vocal about Dean leaving before. Maybe it was because of what happened, he didn't really know for sure.
“Hey, Charlie.” Charlie wrapped him in a hug. “It's so good to see you.” Charlie squeezed his biceps. “Damn boy, nice…”
"...repeat!..." Cas smiled as he brought the mic back to his face and finished the bridge. He put the mic back on the stand and played the guitar solo. The whole concert he was high energy as usual. Cas was himself, running around the stage and jumping around. You’d never know that he felt incomplete at all by just
As they left, Dean looked back at Cas. He was warming up to everyone. He'd be fine."Guys, this is Cas. He's the Contest winner. That's Matt the lead guitar, Mike plays bass, and that's Ian the drummer." Cas shook their hands. "This is the most awesome thing I have ever experienced." He smiled. "So Cas, you play?" Josh asked, taking a drink of Coke Zero. "Yeah, I'm lead vocals and guitar in my band." Josh nodded. "Nice!"
As soon as she left, Cas moved off the bed and crawled under it, reading what was carved into the frame.
The stranger offered his hand. Dean took it. "Thanks" He said as he dusted the snow off his jeans. Out of habit, he looked at the man's wrist. "You're glowing." He said irritability.
Cas walked him as far as he could go. He wrapped his arms around Dean and kissed his forehead. "I love you. Now go put on that spandex I love so much."
The Omega crossed the room and opened the door the rest of the way, looking down the corridor. “They're gone for now. You can get out the back way.”
"Ohmygosh this place is amazing!" Charlie yelled, wrapping Cas in a hug almost tackling him to the floor. "Did you look in the closet? There's a surprise in there you're gonna need for LA." He smiled. They all walked to the girls room. Charlie walked straight to the over sized closet and opened it, seeing a case and pulled it off the shelf. She set it on the table and opened it. "Holy-"
Cas left and walked down to the room where Josh was at. He knocked on the door.Josh answered. "Hey Cas. What's up?"
As soon as the barn came into sight, Dean stopped. The fire had engulfed the whole barn and the roof was starting to cave. "Oh my God!" Charlie's hand flew over her mouth in a gasp. Dean's eyes scanned the area around the barn. He didn't see either of his parents. "No..." He took a few slow steps forward. "No...no no no!"
Silence. Naomi stopped the car. She turned in her seat to face Cas. “And when were you going to tell me this?”
"Technically RJ is your horse. I can't yell at you for riding your own horse." Dean looked at him. He watched as Cas grabbed some feed and gave it to RJ. He felt a smile threaten his face.
"Well look at you go, Winchester." Cas smiled. He grabbed Dean's shirt and pulled him down. "The wait has been driving me up a fucking wall." It seemed since they got home from the hospital, every time they tried to get intimate, Cas would start coughing and Dean would instantly back off, which drove Cas even more
“Well, yeah, but I'm sure you'd want a pup, right?” Alec asked Dean. “It would be pretty cool if you had an Alpha.” He continued.
Cas pushed his guitar behind him and hugged Dean like he hasn't seen him in years. The crowd was going nuts. Dean dipped Cas, kissing him full on the mouth, deep and slow. The audience shrieked and cheered. When Dean finally pulled away, Cas just stared at him, grinning. Adam passed Cas a mic.
"I wish I was." She looked over her shoulder then back to Dean. A few nurses passed them, Charlie  waited for them to get out of earshot. "Nobody knows except me what really goes on. He doesn't even tell Ellen." Dean connected the dots. "This isn't the first time." It wasn't a question because he already knew the answer. He didn't even wait for Charlie to respond before he was walking briskly down the hall looking for Cas' room. He almost walked past it when Charlie stopped him. He turned his head to see Cas sitting on one of the beds. His face turned away and his lips pressed gently against his shoulder. Dean stood in the doorway for a moment, just watching. Cas didn't seem to notice Dean or Charlie, like he was in his own world. Dean heard him sniff then Cas wiped his nose on his shirt. "Cas?" Cas' head moved so fast Dean thought he'd get whiplash. His wide eyes locked on to Dean's, then flicked to Charlie. "You called him?!" He growled. Dean's eyes looked him over. His cheek was scraped and bruised, his left wrist was wrapped in an ace bandage, and his lip...  His lip ring was torn out. Dean's heart dropped. "Yes, I told him. Get mad if you want but I think he should know." The room went silent, Cas refused to look at Dean. "I'm going to get coffee." Charlie said, looking at Cas. Cas looked at the floor when she left.
The years had definitely been good to the man. He must have started working out or something because good God, it was like he was made by the gods themselves; sunkissed skin pulled tight over his slender, muscular frame. Dean kissed Cas’ jawline and then his neck. He slowly moved down Cas' toned torso to those 'fuck me' hips of his. He was pretty sure Cas' hips could be considered a sexuality at this point.   He moved down and flicked his tongue across Cas' tip. Cas sucked in a breath. Dean licked a trail down to the base then took Cas in his mouth. Cas moaned, grabbing a fist full of Dean's wet hair. Cas propped himself up against the shower wall, face toward the ceiling. He felt his eyelids flutter shut as the sensation of Dean's mouth on his swollen cock took him over.
“Bye.” Dean put his phone down and got dressed. As he headed down the stairs, he wondered what the heck Charlie was up to.
The man, Alec grabbed a knife out of his pocket, opened it, and cut Dean's shirt open. He moved the shirt as gingerly as he could. Dean grunted, squeezing his eyes closed.
Dean put one hand on Cas' hip, taking his free hand in the other. Cas put his spare hand on the small of Dean's back and pulled him closer.
"That's true. But growing up in a small town, it's boring. And everyone knows you so if something happens, everyone knows about it fifteen minutes later." He watched Cas pour himself a cup of coffee. "So you're from the city?" Cas nodded taking a sip. He outlined the top of the cup with his index finger. "New York." He replied. Dean whistled.
Dean sighed and dropped his hands, leaning against the counter. "Because I've been here the whole time. Watching. Waiting for you to move on because I don't want to leave until I know you're okay."
"Well good, because I'm never letting you go, either. I love you too. "They kissed again and then joined the rest of the class as they filed into the courtyard to meet their families. Both of their moms were crying like babies. Naomi wrapped Cas in a tight hug. "I'm so proud of you Castiel James."
The drugs he had taken at school that day wore off hours ago and he was starting to come down, which sucked by itself. Never mind the fact that he would go through withdrawals sometime in the next couple of days. He wished he could call Dean. He had never seen Dean so mad and he felt like a dick. He groaned and covered his face with the pillow. He would apologize the first chance he got. Dean wouldn't have gotten so pissed if he didn't care about Cas' well being. He removed the pillow and rolled over, staring at the radio.
He smiled and hit it again. "Fuck!" Cas breathed. Dean let go and put his arms around Cas and lifted him, moving Cas so they were both upright. he grabbed Cas' hips and moved him in rhythm with his hips.
"True," Gabriel said with a nod. "And I didn't get the creepy rape-y vibe from him when he picked you up. Oh! And I saw him open the car door for you. He's a classy guy."
"Now is probably a good time to introduce the man who made this possible buly entering my band in the contest to meet this jackhole over here." Cas motioned at Josh, who flipped Cas a middle finger with a smile. Cas turned back to the crowd. "Dean, get your sweet ass up here."
"It'll wear off." Josh smiled. "Took me a while to get used to it. Just don't let it go to your head." Cas smiled. "That's why this dude is here. He keeps me level. One of the many reasons I love him."
The flooded out into the hall and waited to be announced. Running out on to the field when they were. Every game so far had been a shut-out. Dean stretched out his shoulder as he walked across the field next to the coaches. He looked at the stands, Mary had her camera out and was recording, Sam was taking pictures. He found Charlie but didn't see Cas. Charlie pointed down to the fence. Dean followed to see Cas leaning against the fence, his leather biker jacket over Dean's jersey. Dean walked over to him. "I didn't get the chance to give you a kiss for luck." Cas smiled. It was true. Dean left early before Cas woke up to go over plays with the coaches. Cas grabbed Dean's jersey and pulled him closer, their breath mingled just before they kissed. Dean breathed in. Cas smelled like leather, cigarettes, and Axe body spray. Dean pulled away after a few seconds. "Gotta go." He gave Cas a quick peck on the lips and backed up smiling.
"I love you, too." He whispered into Dean's lips. Dean slid down the shower wall to the floor of the tub, taking Cas with him in his arms. The water was still on. Cas buried his face in Dean's chest and sighed. "You mean, we could have been doing that for the last decade but we choose not to?"
He whipped around to see Charlie and Ellen standing in the doorway. He walked over to them and hugged them.
Dean looked at his phone. "Shit, I have to go. If I miss another morning practice I'll get benched." He stood up.
The whole bar erupted with cheers. "This rounds on me!" He jumped down from the bar then leaned against it. "That outta get em talking." He smiled taking another shot." Dean looked at Cas and shook his head. "What? You wanted a night out, that's what you got, sweet cheeks," Cas said to him. Dean kissed Cas on the forehead. "And it's awesome. Now, you stay here. I'll be right back."
"You have no idea. The more intelligent you are, the more sarcastic you are. And since I'm a genius...I'll let you fill in the blanks."
"The cliff. It's nice out there." Cas turned around. "You know, I'm surprised you didn't just rip my head off for riding him like you did when I petted Pandora."
Dean brought himself to his elbows. He touched Cas' cheek gently. Cas moved into his hand and closed his eyes. "I don't know what's worse. The migraines or the night terrors." He said. Dean sat up. He put his head on Cas'. "I'm sorry you have to put up with this." He whispered. Cas opened his eyes. "Why do you want to go back when you almost died? Look at what being over there has done to you already. You have nothing to prove. You've already shown them they couldn't kill you. But you're not invincible Dean." Dean kissed his forehead. "I have to. I have to see this through."
They walked up to the bar and flashed their new fake ID's as soon as the bouncer looked at Cas' he looked at him. "Aren't you the lead singer of Join The Hunt?"
"Of course you do. You're a reputable and respected man, but you're forgetting something. So am I. There isn't a person for miles who don't know my name. Everyone in this town loves me and I'm held in pretty high regard."
The boys stayed silent. John turned his attention to his son. "You've pulled some crazy crap before Dean, but this? Jumping out of your window to run away in the middle of the night?" Cas looked at his friend. For some reason, he was thankful their jackets were hiding their glowing superhero tattoos.
Due to the two tackling him, Dean flipped through the air, the back of his head was the first thing to hit the ground.
"Okay. Eyes open." Dean fought to do what he was asked. He could tell it was hard for Cas too. Cas found Dean's prostate once more, hitting it repeatedly.Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, lowering his hands to the cleft of Cas' ass.
Dean rolled over, not fully awake but still listening to the waves. He put his arm around Castiel who opened his eyes and smiled. "Looks like we fell asleep on the beach again." Dean smiled back. He sat up and brushed some sand off of his shirt. "Looks like it, but at least it isn't kidnapping this time." He stood and helped Cas up.
"So the kitchen is there, your room is down the hall, first door on the right. Bathroom is across the hall. Stay out of my room at all times. I mean it Gabriel, or I'll put a lock on it."
Dean was up before the sun. He walked over to where his hanging clothes were and grabbed an Army pullover, then got in his dresser and pulled out a t-shirt, boxers, and basketball shorts. Quietly, he made his way to the bathroom to get dressed, deciding on showering after his run.
"Well, we figured since you'd be at school, we'd celebrate early." John said. He clapped Dean on the shoulder. Dean turned to Cas. "You wanted to go on a date just to get me out of the house." Cas smiled. "This was his idea." Sam said. "We wanted to go up to Michigan but since you're birthday falls on a Wednesday, and Sam has school, Cas came up with this." Mary explained. Dean smiled and shook his head. "Thanks everyone."
"Oh, I don't know. An hour ago. Was gonna wait in the back but I heard you start Beside You so I decided to make an appearance."
Charlie thumped him on the head. "Of course he will! Have you seen the way henlooks at you? The boy is loves you."
"If you mean an insane night out that is sure to make headlines and leave people wondering what the heck our game is, then hell yeah we did."
Cas ran his fingers through his hair and sighed. "Yeah, but now I have to work for what I just earned."
The took the field once more. He turned and looked at Cas again as he made his way to the huddle. He said the play and they lined up. The game was tied. The crowd was silent. Dean looked back and forth as he called his play. "Hut!" The ball was snapped. Cole ran behind him. Dean acted like he pitched the ball to him. He looked for Benny but Benny had been tackled. Dean ran forward a few steps then jumped as high as he could over the sea of players. He flipped over them and landed on his stomach still holding the ball. The whistle blew. The referee threw his hands in the air, signaling a touchdown. Dean jumped up and took his helmet off, then threw it to the ground. "Hell yeah!" Cole yelled. Benny and Cole picked Dean up and set him on their shoulders. They had won the last game of the regular season. They were going to the playoffs.
Cas again ran his fingers along the keys. “The family I lived with before Rob and Julie taught me how, the only decent thing they did for me.” “Play something.” Dean urged. Cas thought about what to play for a few moments, then began to play “Roads Untraveled” by Linkin Park.
The video ended and everyone clapped. Dean looked over at Mary who was crying. Sam stood up again. "Dean, our family got to watch you and Cas fall in love since you were toddlers, and watch you fall even more in love every day. If there's one thing I've learned from watching you and Cas over the years, it's how to love."
"Guess they got out. Better help round 'em up. Especially River. Crazy ass horse." He got up, taking his beer with him.
"Okay, fill us in! I'm dying over here! You two have been my only source of entertainment." Charlie gushed. "Hey!" Meg playfully slapped her arm.
Dean flashed his green eyes up at Cas. "Don't make me bend you over a pool table in front of our friends. They're lucky we're even out right now, instead of in my room, or by the pond..."
He climbed up on the bar. "Hey fuckers! I want to make a toast! Hold up your shots or beer or whatever the fuck you're drinking!" Just like that, all eyes were on him. The paparazzi immediately started taking pictures. Cas pulled Dean up on the bar next to him and put his arm around him. "To my boyfriend Dean! What can I say? He just can't stay away from me!" He drank the shot. "Now let's fucking party!"
Cas stood at the top of the stairs. "I don't know what we're going to do." He heard John say.He heard the man sigh. "I knew he would try to pull something like this, but I can't bring myself to be mad at him."
At lunch, everyone else ordered beer and Cas ordered a nice Chardonnay. When they picked up Naomi's dress, Cas made sure to nitpick the fabric and take extra time to find her shoes that complimented the look. Gabriel just watched and laughed.
Cas looked from the Dean to the small black box in his hand. When Dean opened it, Cas gasped. "Will you be my sidekick?" Cas looked at him. Tears of joy forming in his eyes. He smiled. "Who else would I fight crime with?" Dean smiled and took Cas' left hand, sliding the ring on to his ring finger.
Dean walked down the narrow halls, trying to find the cafeteria and realizing it was on the first floor. "Of course it is..." He sighed and made his way to the elevator. He pulled out his phone and called Ellen. It went to voicemail after a few rings. "Hey, it's me. Just calling to let you know nothing has changed. Still hooked up, still unconscious. I'll call in a few hours." He hung up. He didn't know if he should be relieved or scared that nothing has changed. It could go either way, especially with Cas.
I thought I was paralyzed because I couldn't feel anything until I realized it must have been from adrenaline." The three stood there in silence until Dean's coach broke it.
Dean couldn't hold back anymore, the sound of Cas coming put him over the edge. He thrust hard a few more times until he came inside of Cas. As his cock twitched out the last of its come, Dean collapsed on top of Cas and exhaled raggedly. After a few minutes, Dean pulled out and rolled off of Cas. Cas looked at him, still trying to catch his breath. "I think you should take your time more often." He smiled. Dean laughed and turned his head to looked at him. "That good?"
Everyone in the mess hall got quiet, now watching the twins standing inches apart. Sam stood up, putting an arm between his brothers.
"Wha... what?" Cas looked at Dean, snapping to attention. Dean laughed. "I said, you'll be great. So stop the nervous fidgeting."
Winchester. Dean Winchester. King of the school. Figures. Now he's gonna get his ass kicked by the whole football team. Why did it have to be Dean fucking Winchester?
Dean hit Cas' prostate again, causing Cas to feel a familiar warmth in his groin. "Fuck!" Cas moaned as his head fell back again. He arched his back. "Dean..." He breathed, working his hand up and down his own shaft. Dean hit the cluster of nerves again and Cas came undone. "God Dean...I'm coming!" he breathed, stroking himself through his orgasm.
The tone in Dean's voice pretty much told Castiel he didn't really want to talk about it, so he kept his mouth shut.
This chapter is a little shorter than the last few, mainly because I got blocked for a few days. And now that I'm going to classes for my GED, I'm not sure how much I'll be writing. But I will update as much as I can until this story has reached it's end which I don't see happening yet!
Cas darted his eyes back and forth for a second and then looked back at Dean. "Yes. Yes we are. Problem?"
"Castiel Novak."  A picture of Cas when he was eight came up on the screen. Smiling a toothless grin at the camera. He got up and walked to the stage. The picture changed to him on stage in the gym during the music video. Playing his guitar and singing into the mic. He took his diploma. "Congratulations Castiel." He shook Cas' hand. "Thank you sir." He moved the tassel from one side to the other and joined his classmates. Several other names were called.
The door flew open and Cas saw him hanging there. He immediately ran over and grabbed Dean by the waist and lifted him with one arm. With his free hand he untied the sheet from Dean's neck. A few attendants ran in and helped. They laid him on the bed and began CPR, bringing Dean back to life.
He hit the ground with a thud. Undoing his harness he laid down. The rest did the same. He crawled a few feet over to Adam. "You good little brother?" Adam nodded. Dean was commanding the mission. A guy named Chad Burkley was his second in command. He turned his head around. "Burkley! Get your ass over here!"
"Well, now that you bring it up..." Cas slouched in his seat a little, making teasing Dean even easier. He used his big toe and a little more pressure, starting at the base and moved up Dean's length to his tip. He flicked at it with his toe. Dean hit the bottom of the table lightly with his fist.
Mary and Naomi walked together and found their seats. Then Charlie and Sam, who took their places near the officiant. The music changed to Elvis' "I Can't Help Falling in Love With You." Dean waited a few bars before slowly stepping out.
Cole spun Dean around. Dean used that force to punch him as heard as he could, connecting with his ear. Cole too hit the ground.
Dean got up and walked to the balcony of Cas' room. He looked out over the city and then back at Cas. "I don't want to leave. I want... I want to stay here with you."
Cas was still rocking his hips when the door opened and the light turned on, blinding him for a second.
"Mom, I...I'm..." He dropped to his knees in front of the stone. He bowed his head and closed his eyes. "I'm so sorry...I'm sorry I wasn't there. I fucked up mom. It wasn't your fault. It was mine. I was stupid and weak. I guess I couldn't handle it. I'm sorry." He looked at the head stone. "I wish you were here mom. I'll...I'll make you proud. I love you." He kissed his fingertips and pressed them to the stone. He got up and walked back to the car. Once inside, he stared out the window at the grave.
Cas leaned in and kissed Dean slowly, smiling into his mouth when he heard the other man sigh softly. Cas pulled back.
"Nope. Not a word. But there was something in her eyes... I think she wants to come and support you. Guess we'll see."
Everyone left the studio, giving the two a few minutes alone. Cas let his hands drop to his side. "It's just..." He sighed, looking away. "It's like my world came crashing down in one second." He sighed again and closed his eyes for a second then continued. "It was the worst I felt in awhile and I came dangerously close to relapsing a few times because I was just at a loss of what to do."
Cas looked at him. "You want to know if I did it on purpose." It wasn't a question. Dean nodded. Cas sighed and sat up. "It's kinda hard to explain. I knew if I did, everyone would get upset and probably fuck them up for awhile. Especially you and Charlie. If I didn't, at the time, I though I'd be fucked up probably for the rest of my life." He moved so he was sitting with his legs crisscross. "You know, sometimes I still have nightmares about Rob and Julie? Mix that with mom dying and a fuck ton of whiskey and I was pretty much a time bomb about to explode."
Dean walked in the building and found the stairs, taking them two at a time. He walked through the hall. Students were getting ready to go to their spring break destinations. Dean found Cas' room, the door was wide open. He stood in the doorway and smiled. Cas was walking around grabbing things and throwing them in his bag. Dean leaned against the door. "You're cute when you're flustered." Cas jumped and turned around. "Jesus Dean. You scared the shit out of me." Dean's smile grew. "Just adding to the cuteness babe." He walked over to Cas and put his hands on Cas' hips. "Miss me?" Dean asked. Cas laughed. "We were together last night dork." Dean shrugged and pulled him closer. "Doesn't mean we can't miss each other." He kissed him. Cas smiled. "You're a dork."
“It's basically the clothing store here. We call it The Drive, because it's all donated from clothes drives held under false pretenses and given to the refugee camps around the nation. Sam told you this is the biggest one right?”
Cas smiled. "Calm down. Doc said coughing is normal. While you were asleep, doc said there's probably still a little fluid in my lungs. She also said I'm lucky I didn't get pneumonia. I'm probably gonna have to take some kind of steroids on top of whatever meds she gives me for the arrhythmia."
"There was nothing you could have done to change the outcome. From what I've been told, the barn was completely engulfed in flames by the time you got there. You would have only hurt yourself, babe."
Dean took himself in his hand and stroked slowly, moaning into Cas. "Fuck Dean!" Cas bit his lip as the vibration traveled down his dick to the base. Dean slowed his head but moved his hand faster, moaning again.  Cas dug his nails into the shower wall and fucked himself into Dean's mouth. "Damn...feels so good Dean," He breathed. Dean used his free hand to stroke Cas in rhythm with his mouth.
They set a date to start filming. The principal sent home permission slips. There were only a few parents in each grade that were still against it and didn't sign. March turned to April. Dean tried out for the soccer team and naturally made the team.
Dean grabbed Cas in a hug and just held him as tight as he could. "I love you. So, so much. And I know you don't want to leave but we need to go. Right now. Cas? Cas!"
Walking up the stone path to the front door, the door opened and he looked up. "Took you long enough." Cas smiled. Dean returned the smile. "Sorry. Session went longer than usual."
He pulled out a small wrapped box and put in his pants pocket. With a deep breath, he headed to the auditorium. Cas was standing on the stage. "Knew I'd find you in here." Cas turned to see Dean walking up to the stage. He climbed up.
His assistant, Kevin, leaned in toward him. "Uh, sir? What's with your voice? You sound... different. "
"It'd be more enjoyable." Dean fell backward onto the bed, covering his hands with his face. "This. Is. Bullshit."
Dean continued to look at Cas. His hair was still the same black mess it had been. His eyes still the same breathtaking blue. He was gorgeous. Dean could really find the words to describe just how beautiful Cas was. He shifted to his side and with his free hand, traced the tattoo on Cas' wrist. Cas smiled.
Benny walked over to the cops. "Hey, uh, could you not do that here? Their oldest son is sitting right over there." The officers nodded.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I look weird." He said as he met his mom at the bottom of the stairs. "You look amazing." She kissed her son on the forehead. "Dean will be here soon." Cas exhaled. The doorbell rang.
As he fed the horses and worked the ranch, he looked back at the house. Particularly the window to Cas' room.  He sighed as he went back to mucking stalls. As he wheeled the full wheelbarrow out of the barn, he noticed someone standing outside. It was Adam.
Dean reached in his wallet and handed him five dollars. "For the food Benny spilled. You look like you need a sandwich."
There was a knock on the door and he jumped up. Sam was standing on the other side of the screen door.
“Bobby and Ellen have pretty much become parents to us since our parents died after all this went down. Our Dad was an Alpha, mom was an Omega. They wouldn't tell the Betas where Dean and I were so they killed both of them.” Alec recalled.
“And worked. He built the new barn with Benny. And one day, I came over and poof. Dean was back. He had cleaned the house, put on decent clothes. Shaved his face. I just hugged him and cried. He cried too.” Charlie sighed. “It’s been tough. On everyone.”
They settled back into the movie. Dean still couldn't help thinking about just how far he's come. From being a kid in a mental Institution, broken and suicidal. To the young man he's become today. You would never know the horrors he went through  that night in March last year. You would never know he tried to take his own life twice. All thanks to Cas.
"Be that as it may, there is a zero tolerance for fighting in this school. Even for first time offeners. I have no choice but to suspend Dean for one week." Great. Punished for defending his friend. "We understand." Mary said.
Cas sighed. "We don't even have our stuff here..." Dean shrugged. "After party in the auditorium? Just a few songs?" Cas perked up. "Let me make a few calls."
"Bout damn time." Cas said. He pulled Dean close and their lips met. Everything around them faded until it was just them. Cas pulled away. "I love you Dean."
Dean smiled and hummed. "Yes. But at least we have the rest of our lives together." Kissing him again.
Positioning his tip, he pushed in until he bottomed out. The boy under him tensed but moaned. Cas pulled out slightly and rammed back in, drilling into the kid til they both came.
“I will go get Cas. You can either stay here and fuck off, or you can help me get Castiel and burn that fucking place to the ground.” He put on his jeans, socks, and boots. He walked across the room to the door, then stopped and looked back at everyone.
Dean tried to keep his eyes open. He looked at Adam who had a tight hold on his hand. "Don't you fuckin' die on me!" He could feel warm blood coming from his ears. He saw everyone yelling, but he couldn't hear them. "He's not gonna make it..."
Before he knew it, strong arms wrapped around him tightly. The scent of spice and trees and earth enveloped him and he buried his face in the Alpha's chest as the Alpha let out a low growl. Words escaped him. Tears flowed from his eyes.
Dean smiled. "I'll see what I can do. Now, get to it. You have an album and a show to put together."
The bell rang, the sign of recess. Kids flood out on to the playground. It was the same thing every day. Even though most kids have already gotten their "special tattoos" They gave them little to no thought. The procedure was completely painless.
Dean was only trying to help. So Cas decided to help him for once. "It's not his fault Mr Winchester. It was my idea. I talked Dean into running away so I wouldn't have to leave." He said quietly. John stopped and looked at Cas. Dean looked from John to Cas. "That's very sweet of you to try and cover for Dean," Mary began. Cas went back to picking at his jeans. "But we know his handy work." She smiled sweetly at Cas. Cas averted his eyes to the coffee table.
Cas stuck his face directly in the camera, Blair Witch style. "It's so.... spooky!" Adam shut off the camera and sat down to get ready for the shoot. Cas hopped into the chair next to him.
"Well taken care of my ass! What, do you think he's gonna have a better life living in that broken down, shithole of a house as he was in his penthouse in LA...?!"
Cas rolled his eyes. He was done playing stupid. “Would you rather he had tits? Could you sleep at night then?” Zachariah slapped Castiel straight across his face. Cas looked up at his father.
"He called me from your phone when he woke up. I asked where you were, he said 'Right in front of me sleeping.' Then he told me you looked like crap due to lack of eating anything. He could tell from one look that you weren't sleeping well or eating very much. You know what he did? He chewed my ass out for letting
He dried off and dressed then walked out to see Cas grabbing his things. He looked up at Dean. "I'm sorry. I should have knocked. I should have known that you might be in the shower." Dean laughed at the look on Cas' face. "Hey, we're both to blame. I should have locked the door." Cas straightened. "You're not mad?" Dean shook his head, smiling. "With the look on your face? How could I be?" He started laughing again. Cas tilted his head to the side. "What look?" Dean calmed his laughing. "You looked like a lost deer. But I can imagine I had the same look." He scratched his head. "I think I should go."
Cas didn't look up from his food. Neither did Dean. “Dude. Stop hounding me about my sex life.” Dean said, a little irritated.
Alec grabbed a towel off his bed and wiped his face with it. “Dude, chill. We don't have to be around each other all the time. We're not kids anymore.”
As they stepped out of the cabin, Cas looked around. There were kids running around, laughing and playing. Alphas walking hand in hand with their Omegas. No one seemed to have a care in the world. He was actually really confused.
Castiel snatched his phone off the counter and looked at it. Sure enough, there was a text from Dean.
Cas got up and looked out the window. "Huh." He looked at Dean. "Better call your mom. Looks like your stuck here til this clears up."
Dean shrugged. "Well, she was really worried, as we all were, and was relieved that you came out of it. But I won't lie; she's probably gonna pop you on the head."
Dean hung up. Jaxon pushed him out the door. "Okay, okay I'm goin jeez." He laughed. "Well, we can't start without you." Jaxon walked around him, leading the way. Jaxon was a little shorter than Dean and had a small muscular frame. He always said he was built for speed. It must be true too because Jaxon was damn near untouchable.
He thought. They had restrained him by chaining his arms and legs to the bed. Then he notice some rubber thing in his mouth.
"The nerd chasing after the jock. I like!" Charlie smiled. "You just like how I look in athletic shorts."
They took off in a dead sprint. How could something look so close yet be so far? Dean really didn't have time to gauge the distance. The Betas began firing at them. Dean aimed the assault rifle at the grill and the tires, anything to slow them down. If they could just make it to the woods, he knew them like the back of his hand.
Then he noticed the sound the fireworks made. Like bombs. Every few seconds. He suddenly felt like he was back in Germany. Bombs and grenades exploding around him. He tried to breath. To take deep slow breaths. He closed his eyes and covered his ears. "Dean?" His family looked at him. Cas was on his knees next to him. "Dean? What is it?" He shook his head and pressed his hands tighter over his ears. "Fireworks...bombs...granade. God Cas the grenade!" John scooped him out of his wheelchair. "What are you doing?" Bobby asked. John looked back at him. "He can't be here! The noise! It's making him have a panic attack" They all got up and followed John to his car. He laid Dean down in the back seat. "Just keep your hands over your ears Dean. You'll be home soon." He closed the door. "What do you mean a panic attack?"
"Well, feel free to stay as long as you want. Well, unless I get deployed." Cas nodded again. He sat down on the couch. Dean went in his room, shutting the door behind him. He didn't know why, but he trusted Cas to not run off with his things. He didn't know why he offered him food or a place to stay. He didn't know why he felt the way he did. "Or are you queer?" The words rang in his ears. Dean shook his head. He undressed to his underwear and climbed into bed. Pulling the covers over his legs up to his torso. It felt good to be sleeping in his own bed again. He sat up and looked for his uniform. Finding it on the floor. He got up and dug in the pockets. Out of habit, he found the picture of his family and looked at it. He smiled, crawling back into bed. He put the picture under his pillow. Before he knew it, he was asleep.
It wasn't until after lunch they got a call for a vehicle accident. So they suited up and headed out.
They looked through the pictures for a while longer until Dean almost fell asleep on the couch. Cas explained Dean drove through the night to beat the storm. Cas helped Dean up the stairs to his room. Dean stumbled to the bed and laid down. "Your room is almost exactly the same." Cas teased. Dean rolled his eyes. Cas sat on the edge of the bed.
"We go to all the games. My band doesn't play until after the game anyway." Cas replied. He watched Meg as she said her monologue.
Dean sighed. “Cas, there is nothing wrong with her. She’s fifteen and moody. It’s normal.” Cas had stopped listening and was reaching under the bed. Dean walked in the room.
They walked over to their table and sat down. While they ate, Cas quietly took off his shoe and rubbed it against Dean's thigh, then slowly moved up to his slight erection. Dean jumped. His fork dropped to his plate and he looked up at Cas. He looked up at Cas, who had a 'what did I do something?' look on his face. Dean smirked.
Hey all! So I pretty much had forgotten about this story until recently. I started writing a bit for it about a month ago and see it going in a different direction than I originally planned.
Dean lowered himself on to the couch. Everyone sat around him. Cas right next to him. He was to tired to change into regular clothes at the moment. Sam handed him a beer. "Oh thank God. Haven't had a beer in a while." He opened it and took a drink. He leaned back on the couch and closed his eyes. They sat in silence. "I know you guys want to hear how I'm even sitting here and what happened. But I'm not going to tell you. Not yet anyway. I just need time to deal with it." They all nodded. "Nobody's pushing you Dean." Sam said. There was a knock on the door. "That's probably my wheelchair. They want me to avoid walking for awhile." Bobby answered the door. He signed for the chair and rolled it over next to Dean. He handed Cas the crutches and asked him to put them in the closet. He disappeared to the bedroom. Dean looked at Sam. "What happened when you heard?"
“Still, you and Dean haven't mated yet and your heat is coming up. I know you guys aren't trying to rush into it but maybe it'll help the other Alphas back off a little.”
Dean just rolled his eyes. As soon as he took another bite, Cas flexed his foot again and rubbed against the bulge in his partner’s pants. Dean closed his eyes and moaned quietly.
He opened his eyes to see nothing but white. Praying the previous events were some kind of dream and he was really dead. He sat up. Nope. Still alive. The door opened and a nurse walked in. A male nurse. "Good morning Dean. Good to see you finally awake." The man said smiling. Dean said nothing. He turned his head and looked out the window that unfortunately had bars over them. He remembered fighting the doctors at the hospital before his transfer. He didn't want to be touched but they kept touching him. Poking at him with needles. He hated needles. In the end they must have sedated him just to get him here. The nurse sat on the bed. "My name is Castiel. You can call me Cas if you want." Dean nodded, letting him know he was listening. "Your file says you're nineteen?" He nodded again, continuing to stare out the window.
Cas smiled as he twisted his hand up. Dean's mouth fell open in a moan. He felt heat coil. "God Cas...don't stop..." He breathed. Cas moved his hand faster. He twisted up and Dean's head fell back as he came. "Cas...I love you." Cas claimed Dean's mouth as he stroked Dean through his orgasm.
He walked back into the kitchen and started making scrambled eggs and sausage. He just put the toast in the toaster and was about to put more wood on the fire when he heard stirring from the living room. "Finally awake?"
Cas groaned as she walked over and took the keys out of Cas' hand. He heard Dean snicker behind him. "And you Dean Winchester, should have known better than to let him do it. Until that cast comes off, I expect you here every morning to pick Cas up for school and drop him off no later than ten on school nights." Cas turned his head and looked at Dean. Dean swallowed. "Yes ma'am."
"Castiel James Novak. Born in May of '98 to a Naomi Novak and a Danny Marks. They were both druggies, dad got busted with a kilo of coke the day you were born. You had to be weaned off the drugs, mom got clean after that. Mom was allowed to keep you, dad got out on parole the same day she disappeared and you got thrown into the system. How am I doing so far?" Cas leaned back in his seat, not taking his eyes off her. "I've been working your case for a few years now." She slid the folder over to him. "Yeah? Where were you a few weeks ago, hell where have you been the last five years?"
The crowd cheered. Some headed to the bar, some continued eating. Cas jumped down and took another shot. Smiling at Dean.
They denied him visitors until further notice, until they were sure he wouldn't try to take his life again. Castiel still visited. They finally took the mouthpiece out. Dean figured it would be awhile before they let him out of his restraints. They gave him fluids since he still refused to eat or drink anything and sedatives to make him sleep. Even then, some nights the dreams would enter his mind causing him to wake up in a cold sweat.
Dean worked his ass off studying for mid-terms but he finally made it through. He even finished his project for film ahead of time. It was a short documentary on collage life. He wouldn't know what grade he got until after spring break.
Cas got up before the sun, and Dean. He walked out to the barn. "Hey Pandora." He pet the mare's long nose. "Thanks for being there for Dean when I couldn't." The horse snorted in response. Castiel smiled. "You look just like your mom Whiskey." He heard another horse and walked further in the barn to see a brown and white Appaloosa colt. He looked at the name on the door. "RJ aka River Junior" Castiel looked up and smiled. "River, you sly mother fucker." He stepped closer to RJ. "Hey buddy. Your dad was my best friend back in the day."
the video played on, Dean sat up. Cas was singing. No coughing, no scratchiness... just him. And it was the best he'd ever sounded. Dean felt his eyes sting as he continued to listen and watch as Cas poured everything he had into the song he was writing as he went. Dean wiped his face with his towel.
He ran his fingers through his hair. He thought back to the first time he had ever seen Cas. Cas and Charlie were sitting by themselves during lunch. He remembered seeing Cas smile for the first time. And those eyes that always took his breath away.
Alec patted Dean on the shoulder and walked out the door. Dean followed, stopping on the little porch. Alec stopped on the path and looked back at him, smiling.
"I know. I'm not blaming him. I was scared too." He dug his teeth into the plastic wristband and pulled. "Besides, I knew my sarcasm would get me shot sooner or later." He threw the wristband in the trash. Charlie rolled her eyes and hopped off the bed. "But seriously, why can't I just have some fucking peace and quiet for a change. Six years of shit followed by rehab and getting shot the day I get out."
"I'm sorry. This is my fault. I should have left this morning. I was about to. But I couldn't. I couldn't leave you for some reason. Now I know what that reason is. I fell in love too. Same as you. As soon as you asked if I was lost." He sat in front of Dean. "I got you into this. And I'm sorry." Dean looked at him and smiled. "Love at first sight."
Cas looked at him. Had it really been four months? Felt like longer. He shrugged and started in on his food.
yelled at him. Dean actually yelled at him. After everything Cas had done, Dean never once yelled at him. Hell, he barely raised his voice.
"You and Castiel want to have a sleepover?" Dean grabbed two apples out of the bowl on the counter and handed one to Cas. "Bingo!" He grinned. "We already asked his parents." Without even waiting for a response, the boys ran out of the kitchen and up to Dean's room. Dean took a bite of his apple and closed his door.
Cas smiled. "No glass. Got it." He pulled away. He looked in to Dean's eyes. "See you later ever after."
Dean woke up and looked around. The room was dark and Cas wasn't in the bed. He scrambled to his feet.
Cas kissed him again and got up. "I guess I might as well give you your present." He walked over to the tree and grabbed a small box with a bow on it. He jumped over the couch and sat down, handing the gift to Dean.
Dean turned to walk away. Mr Novak stood up, grabbed Dean's arm and turned Dean to face him. "How dare you talk to my wife like that!" They were standing face to face, their chests touching. Dean looked from Mr Novak's hand to Mr Novak himself. The room door clicked open. "What's going on?" He heard Cas ask. Neither man moved. He heard Cas take a few steps forward. "Dean..."
Crowley left them alone for a short time. Cas and RJ were leading with a short ways to go when Crowley came up next to them again. He saw Crowley shift in his seat, sending Little Demon nearly into RJ. Cas heeled RJ on, pulling ahead again. And then Cas felt a stinging pain on his thigh. He bit his lip and pressed forward.
