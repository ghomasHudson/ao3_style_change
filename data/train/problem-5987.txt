Chester Phillips/Fidelis is an ex-gladiator and the doctores retiarii (trainer of the retiarius gladiator) of the ludus, who trains Stefanus and Bacchus.
Because this is how you own a man: You take away his reason for fighting, murder his image of himself and twist it into something that doesn’t even want to come out of the fog. Even if Stark could find the mental fortitude to resist him (unlikely), he won’t be able to look at himself the same way, knowing he betrayed his friend, knowing he wanted to in the first place. They’ll never be what they once were, and better yet, Stark won’t even try. Not anymore.
“Helloooo Miss July,” Dum Dum whistles appreciatively, turning the centerfold on its side to better appreciate the lady’s assets. “Hey Stevie, get a load of this; why don’t you?”
“Now that’s something I understand,” Tony gives him a pat on the back then turns away, giving the man a slight wave over his shoulder as he walks away. “See you in a couple hours, winghead.”
It’s not a certainty, he is well aware. Presently, they are hurtling towards Tython, towards possible allies and an uncertain future. They could use what time they have left mourning what could have been, worried about what is to come and what will be, or–
“Then show me,” he points to his tin mug balanced on a fallen tree across from them. “Bring me that cup with your special Jedi mind powers.”
“Back in my day, a man was careful with his words. Using language like that is what’s tearing apart the moral fabric of this country.” Then again, getting a quickie marriage followed shortly after by an annulment isn’t exactly peak morality either, and yet here they are.
“So, let me get this straight: We are traveling across the Atlantic by ship to reach Egypt, where we will meet up with your contact, hire a bunch of locals for the actual digging, and then break into the final resting place of their king to retrieve…” Mr. Rogers – or Steve as he had insisted on being called – pauses to look at the diagram of the artifact originally found inscribed on the walls of the tomb of their target’s father, Pharaoh Ramesses III, “his golden dildo.”
Steve seems to hesitate, then: “Just… good luck at MIT. Study, but don’t forget to have fun, okay?” he says, a touch awkwardly. He never was a fan of goodbyes.
Steve knows his boyfriend is nervous for tonight – he is too – but it’s starting to border on ridiculous. An outside observer would think Tony himself is the one meeting Steve’s parents instead of vice versa.
He's almost gotten the hang of it, of slipping back into that headspace when suddenly there’s a cloth draped over his groin and a familiar voice telling him to “Get dressed and get out.”
It escalates from there with Tiberius touching Antony for longer than he ought and describing his own sexual conquests in graphic detail under the guise of male bonding, until Tiberius abandons pretense altogether and kisses him under an cypress tree in the garden of his family’s villa.
Stefanus can tell Fidelis already regrets his choice in the training swap. Erasmus likely received a retiarius he could use to train his secutores in the finer points of combat, and here Fidelis was stuck with a distracted secutor who lost to all but the greenest of retiarii.
Clint protests, “That doesn’t count. You need to pick someone. Look, I’m a reasonable guy. I’ll let you review tabloids from the last couple months to make your selection.”
“No, it’s not Rhodey,” Tony calls out weakly, trying to sit up and failing. He plops back on the pillows of the hospital bed. “Goddamn it, don’t drag him in here! I swear, Cap, you’ll be the death of me.”
And so he saunters past. “Pearls before swine,” he states before racing Steve to the door. Tony reaches the handle first, but Steve nearly lifts him up, removing Tony bodily so he can cross the threshold before him.
But Steve is still shaken, his fear transforming to anger as he pushes away from Tony, declaring, “I can’t believe we’re going to die over a glorified sex toy!”
Tony’s body melted into the bed as he felt light and soft. He floated away, unaware that Steve had pulled all the way out until he slammed himself back in.
At sunset, they arrived at a wooden cabin, which Tony understood to be some sort of rebel outpost. It was beside a lake, which they jumped in, eager to wash the dirt and grime off their bodies. Tony took his time, enjoying the view as Steve busied himself with chores - breaking logs, spearing fish and kindling a fire.
He can see Antony thinking back to his visit to the ludus as he tries to identify the gladiator in question. “Is it that gladiator with the long hair? Your training partner, the one you were sparring with when I came to see you at the ludus?”
They reach the garden center, a vulnerable fenced in area to the right of the building. It’s a touch rusted, but the fence has held. Inside are rows of dead plants, split bags of potting soil spilled over cracked cement and covered in weeds, as well as faded signs advertising sales, some hanging by one end on broken chains. The draped netting and plastic serving as a roof is ragged and torn, large swaths of it having fallen in to cover the rotted wooden pallets. The entrance into the building proper is similarly boarded up from the inside. Steve supposes that in the early days, the survivors foraged what they could from the garden center to build what he had scoped out on the rooftop, before they had to seal it off entirely to prevent being overrun by undead hordes.
“Most men don’t want me like you do, not in the same fashion, and the women? They want me to pay for it, and I never really had the extra money lying around, so… so this is different.”
“Is that a crack about my beard?” Steve strokes his facial hair. He had long forgone his daily shaving routine, choosing to trim periodically as a practical matter. “It does interfere with my jawline.”
“You know when Roosevelt said ‘speak softly and carry a big stick,’ I don’t think he meant in your ass.”
Dracula takes the interruption in stride. “It relates to my father’s accomplishments, and I’d rather not rest on his laurels, not when I have other names I earned in my day,” he tells him before turning to Steve. “You may call me The Impaler.”
“So instead you aim to trade the possibility of Bacchus’s death at your hand for the certainty of your death at his?” Antony knows it is cruel, that it is manipulative, but in that moment, he cares not. “Should you lose, Hadrianus as editor will signal your death, and Bacchus must kill you, but if you win… if you win, Bacchus at least has a chance of reprieve should he fight well enough for the crowd to demand it. Hadrianus does not know of your connection, and– and he is not senselessly barbaric in his proclivities. He will not risk angering the constituency over an unpopular call,” he reasons. “I implore you to consider your situation. Could you really do that to Bacchus then? Force him to fell you in the arena should you fail to fight to the best of your ability?”
However, against expectation, the guy falls silent on the line, so much so that Tony thinks the call might have dropped. “Hey winghead, you still there?”
“Jedi can employ this persuasion technique to compel others to do something or convince them of… of alternative realities,” Steve explains, “but I’ve never been very good at it and never with more than one person at a time.” That was the downside of always solving his problems with his fists, the gentle art of persuasion (or mind-fuckery as some of the other Initiates would call it) is almost completely lost on him.
He puffs away at the smoldering stick. “Honestly?” He inhales with a wheeze. “Not really, but not much I can do about that.”
“Haven’t you heard?” Antony asks him when Rabirius had kindly introduced himself. “I’m persona non grata in these parts.”
“Or the tooth fairy,” Tony continues, undeterred. “That’s a good one. What the fuck is she doing with all those teeth, huh? And we’re not supposed to be terrified of some lady who breaks into our homes to steal our excess bones?”
Then again, his only crime had been trying to take the mission seriously while Tony was treating the entire venture as a goddamn holiday. Why should Steve be the one left out to suffer? Worked up over the injustice of it all, he stomps back inside, ready to give Tony a piece of his mind then force him to sleep on the floor where he can roll around to his heart’s content. He doesn’t even knock as he throws open the door.
,” Hadrianus points out, before his voice goes deathly quiet, almost conspiratorial. “The gladiator will not be a problem for much longer anyhow.”
“If you can’t get it up, I could always get Bruce in here. The Hulk could probably get the job done right.” Tony is blasé, cultivating a nonchalance calculated to piss off the man.
as a full-fledged citizen. Anyone possessing even a passing familiarity with your earlier indiscretion can tell.”
“Seems like it would be an impediment during… more intimate activities,” Steve comes over to sit on the fallen log across from Stark.
“The King is dead,” Tony interjects. Howard had wasted forty-six years of his life, had sacrificed his wife and his relationship with his son on the altar of this pointless all-consuming obsession. No way in hell is Tony about to continue his folly.
Clint is about to crack another joke, something about Steve’s losing on purpose to get back at Stark, who would be the one footing the bill for his ruined furniture, when Stark limps into the kitchen and gingerly slides into an open seat across from him, his face screwed up in pain as he settles in.
“The ‘public’ includes members of your own family as well, Priscus.” Antony knows Priscus is liable to sell his own mother downriver should the price prove high enough, but it doesn’t hurt to clarify the extent of discretion he expects.
Steve coughs, clearing his throat. “Well, you know what they say about getting a good night’s rest.”
“Anyone hungry?” Clint asks absently from the chair adjacent to Nat. His thumbs sweep across the screen of his phone, clearing indicating he is deeply invested in some mobile game.
“I don’t want to hurt anyone. Brock’s a bully. He was picking on the new kid whose mom just died of sweating sickness. Said it was syphilis on account of her being a… um… an H – O – R,” he whispers, demonstrating both his knowledge of social niceties as well as his impressive grasp of letters. “Pinky’s littler than the rest of us, and Brock was mean to him for no reason. He made him cry,” Steven says, stating bluntly, “I don’t like bullies.”
Tony rolls his eyes as he draws a finger down the condensation gathering on the outside of his glass. “Oh please. Aren’t you supposed to be my big strong man on this little trip?”
Stark is still for a long moment. Steve is uncertain whether he’s mulling it over or just mulishly standing his ground – it’s so hard to tell when all he can see is an impassive mask – but his plea must work because the Mandalorian steps aside.
Tony reflexively draws up his legs, clutching his pillow like a crab, before relenting. “You are inhuman,” he complains. “This is a violation of the Geneva Convention.”
“It wasn’t real,” Steve points out, and now Tony’s jaw tightens, his hands clenched into fists ready to brawl, “on her side. I know you loved her, and it was real for you.”
“Oh really? Captain America might have bought her thirty-five years, but you let her die while searching for his corpse. You always prioritized him over us, never able to accept the truth. Well, here it is: Captain America’s dead; do you hear me? He’s dead! And yet finding him was still more important to you than Mom’s life. What would the good captain have had to say about that, huh?”
Steve crosses his arms. “I don’t know what your problem is. Hawaiian pizza is good. It’s sweet and a little salty.”
“Well then, I guess that means you’re out of luck. Besides, you look like you’ve aged four years in four months.” He uses his thumb and forefinger to mirror the shape of Tony’s goatee on his own face.
Antony cuts his hair, grows out what little facial hair he can, and returns to eating full meals. And when Tiberius takes up with another boy soon after – one he had expressly told Antony was just a friend in the waning days of their relationship – Antony tries not to care, but the rejection, the heartache still stings.
For his part, Stark takes a deep breath, but he holds steady, as if steeling himself for the next blow he knows must be coming.
So Steve simply sighs, his eyes steady on the road. “Of course I did,” he replies evenly. “You reminded me fifteen times and saw me load up Billy.”
Upon entering the living room, he had grabbed a beer to give himself something to hold, and then another when he had drained the first out of nervousness and lack of anything better to do. The alcohol loosens something inside him; whether it’s a psychological or physical effect of the social lubricant is hard to say, but halfway through his third, Tony is speaking a mile a minute to an enthralled audience of fellow co-eds, discussing the ethical considerations of emerging artificial intelligence technology.
“Tony!” Steve cries out again, his hand now on his dick, sliding his foreskin up and down over his shaft. “Tony, I’m– I’m so close.”
Antony says nothing, but his face darkens, grows cold and furious. Stefanus should wait, but there is more he must ask, and he’d rather do it all at once than piecemeal, lest Antony think him dishonest or greedy.
Priscus drops all pretense of ignorance, baldly stating, “Tiberius may be blood, but this is business. My lips are sealed.”
“Yeah,” Steve concurs, his fingers swiping long strokes as if scrolling through a list. “I think we should eat each other out tonight. What are you guys thinking? Chinese?”
“Listen here, Tony. I–” he stops, the scene before him giving him pause, because there is Tony, keeled over and hugging the white porcelain of the toilet, heaving into the basin.
There’s nothing Steve can say that will make him change his mind, so he only looks down at the growing pile in his arms. “It’s nothing.”
He breaks their kiss, his forehead resting on the other man’s. “Antony,” he murmurs into their shared breath. His hands slip into his toga, roaming from his hip then lower, trailing along the rise of his ass as his cock thickens against his thigh. “Antony, do you want… can I…”
Tony gives her ten minutes to walk downstairs before he follows after, putting his ear to the door of the study in an attempt to hear the muffled argument. The walls are thick, and he can’t quite make out any words, but the anger he does hear makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, and when footsteps stomp towards the door, Tony runs to the guest bathroom opposite the study and hides.
“First, I am going to repair my ship,” Stark replies, returning to the engine to hunt for more replacement parts. “Second, I’m going to return you to Tython as agreed.” He pulls out a piece, handing it to Steve. “And then… well, I’ll figure out something.”
“White roses? God, that’s just so… so basic. So cliché. You’d think my body could at least come up with a better flower if it was going to up and die on me,” Tony says to no one in particular.
On an excursion to Pax, Master Erskine and Master Phillips stumble across a force-sensitive child. Master Phillips thinks the boy too angry to be trained in the ways of the Jedi.
They make the trek back in silence, each stewing in their righteous indignation over the other’s behavior. And when they make it back to the room, Tony goes into the en suite bathroom while Steve walks through the sliding doors to their pool deck.
Steve knows he’s being selfish. He is well aware of the Mandalorian code. He knows the helmet stays on no matter what, but: “Can– can I kiss you?” he asks softly, a touch hesitant. Stark goes rigid beside him. “It’s just… I’ve never – that is to say, I haven’t… um. Well–”
Dracula pushes his chair back, allowing himself room to stand should the occasion call for it. “And what if it is?”
. His advisors probably got it for him so he’d be less uptight and go easy on the capital punishment. I cannot be the only one who sees it.”
Before Tony knows it, he’s lying supine on the couch, his hands gesticulating wildly, talking about all sorts of things, about Mom and Howard, and Steve and MIT, about having to grow up too fast to fit in. Their time is up, but he comes back week after week, divulging more and more of his inner turmoil, his doubts and feelings. It’s freeing in a way, to share all his intimate thoughts and experiences with a stranger, a professional. It really cuts the weight of it all in half, helps him come full circle. It’s what is making him sick, and this allows him to release the pressure valve every once in a while, to process and overcome his personal traumas…
“Gosh, you’re so tight. Such a good, good fuck,” Steve groaned. “Just lie there and let me love on you. No touching,” he said, and smacked Tony’s hand away from his throbbing cock.
It was an obsession. Like a long line of great leaders before him, besotted with a pretty face. And his was indeed beautiful, with his soft hair, wet eyes and pink lips, swollen from biting down on them in an attempt to remain silent while his well-muscled body struggled in his binds.
It was something his father was fond of saying, convinced that embracing change was the only way forward. It was just as Tony remembered then - Howard was going to sign the accords with those same pens when he was killed.  And if Zemo had them…
I’m so sorry for posting this so late. I had a draft ready for the second chapter when I posted the first one and I thought I could edit it in three days. But the plot bunnies didn't leave me alone and it's swelled to three times its length.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, plucking at the blades of grass. “I guess it would have been easier if I hated you. Like I was supposed to. You took away my parents, my home, everything I ever cared about. You stood in the way of our freedom. I wanted so badly to hate you back then.”
“Yeah,” Tony said brightly. “Poor neglected hole. Sure explains why you’ve been acting up. A thorough thrashing will remind you of your place, won’t it?”
It didn’t take long for the belt to do its work, turning Steve into a sputtering mess. He found it increasingly hard to hold his position, often twisting away from the pain.
“No one else has had this tight cunt?” he asked, raising a brow as he breached the tight ring with an oiled finger.
“Don’t move,” Steve ordered, as he climbed onto the bed and positioned himself in front of Tony and lined his wet tip with Tony’s entrance. He slid inside in one slow move, which drew a loud moan from Tony.
He thought of Steve often, keeping tabs on his career, happy to hear of his meteoric rise through the ranks, to
Tony made a sound of approval, sliding his other hand down his body so he could fondle the firm balls and take hold of the young man’s cock. Humming appreciatively, he gave it a few slow strokes until Steve thrusted forward in an attempt to fuck his hand. Tony squeezed Steve's cock in warning, as he withdrew his finger, smacking his naughty hole several times to calm him down. “Patience, love. There’s a lot we need to talk about.”
By the time Tony was done, his young lover had begun to drift into a deep sleep, so he left the room, taking a stroll to clear his head.
The real question was whether he could forgive himself. It took a while but he found the courage to survey the damage, to come to terms with what he had done. He returned to his place between long, slim legs, sickened at the sight of the angry strokes that covered the lovely white canvas, now a mess of pinks.
“Yeah, I um… I got sober, and uh… you told me to call you when that happened. Three months. Haven’t touched a drop.”
“He is tall and fair and bears a striking resemblance to a certain patrician, the source of your original shame. You gallivant around the city like a fawning woman on his arm,” Hadrianus grits out accusingly. “And with the exception of today, he never leaves before dawn. Do not presume it has gone unnoticed.”
“You’re getting too old for this,” Tiberius says, his tone cruelly casual as he crushes Antony’s still-beating heart. “Your ass has started to sprout hair. I tried to ignore it because I care for you, but it’s unseemly and rather perverse should we continue.”
Tony almost chokes on his smoothie. He coughs and pounds his chest to clear the burn in his windpipe before mumbling, “I told him to use the back entrance.”
“No,” Master Erskine replies, having chosen to answer only his second inquiry. Steven is visibly disappointed. “I am a Jedi. My name is Master Erskine.”
Steve nearly fumbles the remote while Pinky loudly complains, “Hey dickheads, swap spit on your own time. The game is starting!”
”No,” Steve says, holding up his hand palm out to silence him. He exhales slow, collecting himself. “Now you listen, Tony, and you listen good. This is what’s going to happen: You are going to tell me who you’re in love with, and then we are going to make a plan to bag you the man or woman of your dreams. Because you are not going to die, and if I have to be your wingman to make that happen, then that’s what I’m going to do.”
Priscus holds up a hand to assure him. “Fear not, Staius. I do not disclose the identity of any who come seeking…
Steve knows it doesn’t matter. Tony is single; he can do what(–or who–)ever he wants. So what if he made the beasts with two backs with someone else? Virginity is a social construct in that no one’s dick or vagina is important enough to change any aspect of another person’s identity. Tony is still Tony; he’s still the guy Steve had been sweet on for the past year…
Cap waffles for a moment longer and then exits the lab. Tony slows, puts down his tools, pushes back from the Iron Man armor, and massages his forehead with both hands. He breathes out slow and steady.
Master Phillips positions himself in front of Steve, trying to give him cover for escape. “You must!”
Captain America is above reproach, the patriotic embodiment of their great country, but Steve Rogers is just a shell of a man, weak and flawed and ultimately unable to live up to that lofty mantle.
refusals, Tony had massaged his forehead and sucked in a steadying breath. “…Are you kidding me right now? What’s the problem this time? Are they too flirty? Too available? What’s your deal?”
It takes a while for Steve to adapt, but with Bucky vouching for him, the other boys eventually warm up to Steve, including him in their games and studies. He becomes a little less isolated, a little less lonely, and even though he never truly overcomes his confrontational nature when pressed, he gets better at suppressing it. In time, he even passes the Jedi Initiate Trials and is quickly chosen by Master Erskine as his padawan.
Stefanus would never deny Bacchus his delights considering the man had won his fight, but he had other plans. “Perhaps another day I will join you, my friend.”
Cap tries to get the meeting back on track. “Right. So, if we could move on from the topic of Stark’s sex life…”
Tony places a hand over Steve’s and drops his voice low, his tone almost sultry. “I can think of a different arrangement.”
And now Stefanus looks surprised as he touches Antony as well, his fingers pressing over Antony’s own, threatening to penetrate him dry.
“I’m afraid I do not understand… Antony. Have I displeased you in some way?” Priscus will have his hide if Antony returns him untouched with demands for a refund.
With a roar, Steve grabs the retreating stick, snapping it in half before he tackles Stark to the ground. Stark uses his momentum to flip him over, but Steve knees him then rolls him off. However, before Steve can pummel the Mandalorian, Stark is on him yet again. They tussle across the forest floor until Stark uses his superior weight to pin Steve to the ground, his knees pressing into Steve’s thighs with his legs locking around his calves, his arms holding Steve’s own up over his head and his helmet inches from Steve’s face. Steve can see his reflection, angry as he struggles. His breath is ragged and rapid as it gently fogs up the shiny metal. And then he feels it. A growing hardness in Stark’s groin pressed flush against his own.
(If asked later why he had chosen to engage with Antony, perhaps Tiberius would have said he wanted to see how the plebian (though equally rich) half lived, to slum it a little so to speak, or perhaps he was simply bored and Antony had been convenient.)
Tony had gotten as far as dialing the first six numbers, but he always hung up before the seventh. He doesn’t even know what he’d say: that he’s sorry, that he wants Steve back in any capacity he is willing to give him… that he’d like to know if Steve still loves him?
Before he can complete his task, Antony asks him, “I’ve heard you have a rather talented tongue. I was curious as to the veracity of such a tale.”
“Or carnal lust, not as the object of such but as the lover himself,” Bacchus amends. “Livia is very good; she does this thing with her tongue that can strike a man dumb.”
Antony’s fingers slip along the crack of his ass as if he wants to hurt Stefanus like Stefanus is hurting him. When that inspires no reaction, Antony presses a blunt thumb against his hole until it gives. Stefanus’s body goes taut. He sucks in a breath, shakes his head no. His body is too tight, his muscles tense as he takes the abuse.
He pushes down quickly, efficiently, sheathing the sword through Aemilius’s neck downwards, spearing his heart. Aemilius chokes, shudders, and falls to the side, his body spasming and twitching, blood spilling from his mouth and neck as his eyes unfocus and roll back.
Tony curls reflexively, his knees drawn up and hands cupping his sex. “Fucking A, Cap! It’s freezing!”
She smiles, perching her chin delicately on the curled fingers of her raised hand to frame her face. “And still drinking all by your lonesome?”
Out of fury or perhaps borne of a certain helpless vulnerability of being alone and pinned, Steve reflexively, desperately pushes out with his mind. Stark goes flying, slamming into a tree and bouncing off, landing unceremoniously on his back with a grunt of pain.
“Oh… Oh God, Tony,” Steve audibly smacks his lips. His eyes are half-lidded with sweat dripping off his forehead and glistening on his bright red chest. His fingers grasp the sheets as his body tenses up, his toes curling and back arching over the bed. “Jesus, God Damn!”
Tony is frowning, his expression thoroughly annoyed. He doesn’t mince words. “No offense, Director Fury, but this might be your most harebrained scheme yet. I may have a brain tumor, but no one’s going to believe I’d be crazy enough to abscond with a random blond I just met.”
“You are strong and were able to avoid my bite,” Dracula says, observing how Steve’s bruises are already healing on their own.
“I want to go to school for art,” Steve says over a lunch of burgers. “I’m probably not going to make enough money to pay you back for a fancy education.”
One of the upsides of having had sex with Captain America (besides the obvious) is that the man is more reserved around Tony. When Tony talks back to him at the next team meeting, instead of flying off the handle at the thought of an omega challenging his authority, Cap tries harder to be civil, even if Tony can see him practically bite his tongue off with the effort. Hell, if he had known sex was all it took to clip the man’s metaphorical wings, Tony would have fucked him months ago.
into consideration. Now, I’ve got work to do, and not a lot of time for chit chat.” He pointedly turns around and grabs his soldering gun, pulling a portion of the chest piece closer.
Stefanus wonders whether they will still bury Bacchus all the same or if he had earned a more ignoble end with his last act. If he is to be discarded, forgotten… who will provide the coin over his eyes to pay Charon for passage on the River Styx? Who will ensure a proper burial and engraving for a born slave, much less tend to his grave, clearing the weeds and leaving offerings for the nourishment of the dead? Stefanus has money enough to bribe the gravediggers and hire a stone mason to do his work. If he has to do it alone without Priscus, without the collegia retiarii, then so be it.
They lead him to the main house to a private bedroom with walls decorated in erotic scenes either painted or inlaid directly into the stone. Suibne blushes at a particularly explicit mosaic featuring three men in a rather compromising position.
It is a pragmatic solution to a whole host of issues, one that would tie Stefanus to Antony for the near future, if not for life.
“This what you want, huh?” Steve whispers into his ear, his tongue sliding over the shell. He pushes down Tony’s pants to his knees then unfastens his own. He pulls a slim packet of lube from his pocket and tears it open with his teeth to smear it over his erection.
And so it is that by the third day, Steve has had it. Between the traveling and Tony’s nightly wriggling, he hasn’t had a good quality sleep in days. He’s cranky, tired, and Tony continues to tax his limited patience while offering no respite from his presence. Steve’s normal avenue of stress relief – he looks a touch too hard at a gaggle of sun-kissed tourists – is unavailable to him. He’s
She relaxes, and Steve wonders if she would have had the strength and resolve to do what needed to be done. If not her, would Bucky…
“A: I have not been in love with him for years. Shut up. And B: I can like more than one guy at a time,” he spells out, digging into a particularly large reservoir of hot fudge. “So this guy, he’s been off limits because… um. Because…”
“I suppose so, even comely ones such as he,” Romulus allows, even as his manner remains uneasy. “I’m sure he will guard your body closely, my friend.”
Master Erskine smiles down at Steve gently then pats him on his upper back to subtly push him forward. “Go on. Up into the ship with you, alright? I need to talk to Master Phillips.”
With Quinquatria soon upon them, Antony looks into Ignatius, the retiarius Stefanus is destined to fight in the arena. The man is a seasoned gladiator, a veteran of good record as Hadrianus had reported, having lost his second bout and been reprieved only to win the next fourteen. Antony can easily deduce why this may be the case. Ignatius is skilled, true, but he also has an edge, something Stefanus and many a secutor would be unprepared for…
Steve is crouched low in the tree line just outside enemy base. He peers at the building where his new buddy Sergei had said they were keeping Tony. He had even drawn him a poorly-rendered map in exchange for keeping his right hand mostly intact. He had then knocked him out and kept him and his unconscious buddies securely tied up and stowed away in the bathroom of their pool villa for safekeeping, leaving a do-not-disturb sign on the door handle to prevent housekeeping from finding and freeing their guests.
“You work on getting better, prove you’re ready, and then ask him out again,” Rhodey replies, as if it really is that easy or fast.
Steve lights up, the ember at the end burning a bright red to ashen grey even as he coughs through the smoke. “I have to breathe it in deep. Doc says the cough is how I know it’s working.”
“Come on, Rogers. Why don’t you loosen up a bit? Prohibition has been over for six years already, and even if it wasn’t, international waters. Arbitrary American laws hold no sway here,” Tony gently cajoles him as he takes a sip of his first scotch. “Anything you’d like. On me. I started a tab, and I aim to make the most of it.”
Rogers gasps, his grip loosens, and Tony thinks he’s won their little game of Gay Chicken when he feels it: the man’s growing erection pressed against his thigh. Tony pulls away in surprise before he can think better of it, and Rogers covers the offending member with his hands, his expression bereft and slightly horrified.
The only thing that will make him feel better is for Tony to suddenly become a different person entirely.
“It’s a little more complicated than that, patatino mio,” she replies, sweeping her hand across the blanket to smooth it out. “Your father will do what he thinks is right.”
“You beg so pretty,” Tony says, giving him a stroke, causing Steve to shudder and clench around his buried fingers. “And your hole is so tight. I’d love to take it for a spin.” Steve groans at the thought. “Maybe next time,” Tony adds with some regret. The way Steve’s ass is rippling around his fingers would feel amazing on his dick. “But I think I promised you something else, hm?”
Stefanus is wary of Antony’s intentions when the man quietly negotiates with Priscus for exclusive privileges to his “bodyguarding” services. Though Stefanus has little say in how Antony chooses to use him, Antony tries to win him over anyway, showering him with compliments and gifts.
Tony cups his hands around his mouth to project his voice. “Anyone home?” Clint nudges his shoulder to silence him, while Tony turns to face him, completely oblivious. “What?”
Oh… Bucky thought, but no. No, that’s not possible. Steve hadn’t done anything yet, least of all with Tony Stark.
Purple Man is getting better at this, or Rogers really does want to make Stark feel better given he has no choice in the matter. Either way, this isn’t how he wanted to spend his evening. He looks down at his watch. “This is getting dull, and we really should be getting back to implementing your plans for clean water in Ethiopia. Why don’t we move this along?” He sits back and steeples his fingers.
No. Steve is their only viable option, regardless of whatever Doc had to say in her final assessment. Depression. Insomnia. PTSD. Symptoms of maladjustment disorder, and whatever bullshit she could cook up to bench him. Steve is fine, perfectly peachy. And if he wasn’t… well, who wouldn’t be a little rattled in his position? But he’s no pansy. He’ll just walk it off like always, even if it was taking a little longer than ideal. After everything that happened with Jan, with Clint’s family and Loki and Natasha, he could use a–
Not when the very thought of it makes the man shudder. Irrumatio has never been Antony’s preference, and so he replies. “No, it is a rumor I heard, and I was simply curious.”
Tony shrugs. “I don’t know what to tell you, Steve. Maybe you shouldn’t have pulled the alarm directly in Dr. Pym’s line of sight if you didn’t want to get in trouble. I mean… at least wait until he turned around or something.”
“It’s Antony, and would you like that?” He asks, now sitting up fully on the bed to allow space for Stefanus to do the same.
“Come on, Stevie. There’s no need to play dumb, not with me. A couple days ago, Stark was helping you study for your physics midterm, and then all of the sudden, his unicorn is nowhere to be seen,” Bucky continues with much aplomb. “And here I was thinking you’d never make a move. It was painful, you know, watching you struggle to so much as talk to the guy. I’m impressed, didn’t know you had it in you.”
“Your punch needs work. I barely felt that at all,” he says, tapping the raised pink ASPS brand on his own right fist and then his eye. “You should put your whole body into it…” He eyes Suibne’s physique. “Though that might not be much.”
“Oh God; you feel so good, so tight.” He drives forward then shudders in place against Tony’s slicked ass, inspiring a shivery feeling up his spine. He leans over to plant open-mouthed kisses along the back of Tony’s neck, along the plane of his shoulder. “I can’t believe you’re mine. Tell me you’re mine, Tony.”
Antony should have told him to fuck off, and had he been older and more self-assured, he would have, but at the time, he is sixteen and still much too conscious of the other man’s social capital. He holds out his hand for a shake of reconciliation. “Agreed.”
Clint raises a brow as Stark attempts to speak in muffled tones before prying off Steve’s fingers. “We were not. Steve made a bet that he could touch the vaulted ceiling in his room, and he had tried to use the bed as a trampoline to reach it.”
“It isn’t about what we deserve,” Aemilius heaves, his voice hoarse with fear or from the near strangulation, Stefanus is unsure. Aemilius clasps the victor’s thigh and presents his neck as he has been trained to do. “Uri, Vinciri, Verberari Ferroque Necari… this was always the way it was going to end. For all of us. Eventually.”
“You were a slave before,” Antony points out, but he gets up as well, crosses the short distance between them to sit shoulder-to-shoulder beside Stefanus on his settee. His side is warm where he touches Stefanus. “Though I
Facing Steve with Stark’s hand moving towards his blaster, he signs off. “Thanks, Rhodey. I’ll take that tow when you can get it out to me. I’ll send you the coordinates later, okay?”
Tony leaned over and kissed his forehead, holding him close in his arms, as he felt like the happiest man on earth. “I love you, Steve. I love you too.”
Tony hummed in approval. “Looks like you can listen after all. I think I should keep you naked more often, since you seem to have grown too big for your britches,” he said, stroking his back and rubbing circles on his bottom. He put a hand on the small of his back to calm him down, before kissing his forehead. “What happens to bad boys in this house?”
He took a long last look at the bedroom, a tiny bubble where they forgot they were at war. In there, they’d created beautiful memories, all of which he would never forget. With a final glance at his sleeping lover, he walked out and shut the door.
Tony's mouth fell open. He'd forgotten how direct Steve could sometimes be. “My heart wasn’t in it,” he said. “You took it when you left,” he added, curtly.
Tony raised a brow, hearing about this for the first time. “Who's behind all this?” he asked, genuinely curious.
Hardening his heart, Tony picked up the crop, and stroked the exposed cleft with its tip, tapping it lightly against the tender rosebud. Without warning, he pulled it back, flicking it directly on the tightly-clenched hole. The effect was immediate. The boy howled in pain, twisting wildly in his futile attempt to free his hands and soothe his sex.
And that is it. Their relationship ends not with a bang, not with the sword or spear and Stefanus bleeding out on the sands, but with a whisper, a glance, or so Antony believes.
“How do you figure that? Tony. You’re dying. You’ve been dying for months now, and no one knew. Not Pepper, not any of us.”
Stark’s fists ball up. He stands, walking around the fire to confront Steve. “You speak of attachment as if it’s something wrong, something dirty, but guess what, Steve? Attachment is
Tony resisted the urge to roll his. Of course, Steve, unwaveringly loyal to the ones he loved, would think so. “Then why did Zemo insist?” Tony countered, remembering the general’s damning evidence of Barnes’ guilt.
It was romance. And Tony would fight anyone who claimed otherwise. It was love he’d seen in those blue eyes, which burned fiercely for him, even though they glazed over at one point and Steve froze for so long that Tony was sure he’d changed his mind.
“Oh!” Tony shouted as his leaking hole stretched around Steve’s throbbing dick.  “You crazy, jealous, possessive prick!” he cried when Steve did it
Tony squirmed as his juices leaked all over Steve’s firm grip. “Might make them worse,” he admitted.
Tony stared at him in surprise. "And why would you want that? Now?" he asked, when he finally found his voice.
get you into the shower and scrub away his scent. Can’t wait – all your fault – need you – now,” he said, and lifted Tony over his shoulder in one move, keeping a possessive arm over his bottom, as he made their way to the bed in long, purposeful strides.
“Stand down now. Final warning.” Tony's voice was stable, a low growl, but the look in his eyes brooked no argument.
At the threat, Steve buried his head and sobbed miserably, but he stayed in position, head on the ground and ass in the air, legs apart, just as Tony wanted.
do you mean Bucky, your best friend of a hundred years, who was just holding on to my shoulders so I wouldn’t fall off the stage?”
Why then did his boy, who lived in the lap of luxury and had his every need catered to, repay his kindness by running away each time he could?
“Head down,” Tony said, applying pressure to the back of his neck. “Knees apart. I want to see you.”
His first stop was to the treasury - to retrieve the weapon that the guards had seized when Steve had been caught. He hadn’t needed it then, not with Tony as his fortress. But if he was going back to his old life, surely, he’d need to be armed.
“Thought so,” Steve mumbled, and went back to sucking at his hole and running his tongue all over Tony’s freshly-waxed cleft and taint.
Tony felt loved and cherished, and wet and open, with the combination of spit and slick dribbling down the back of his thighs. He wanted more. He needed more. He whined when Steve pulled away, and wiggled his bottom in invitation.
Steve brushed his other hand across Tony’s bare chest, gently running over his flat stomach and his hip to wrap his fingers around Tony’s leaking cock. “I don’t know,” Steve said, considering the question. I might allow you a cage and plug. That will at least keep their hands off you. Think that would curb your wanton desires?”
His heart clenched painfully in his chest, the thought of being apart from his boy, his – Steve, shattering his heart. Well, that would be
He was quiet now, silent tears running down his cheeks as he strained in misery, his muscles flexing and unflexing as he endured the harsh strokes on his thighs. His back was coated in perspiration, the evidence of his suffering in the sultry evening heat.
Tony’s eyes flew open at the threat. He flashed a rueful smile at the larger man. “But you’re not,” he squeaked in a small, meek voice. “So maybe we’ll let this go, just this once?”
Tony found a bottle of oil, pouring a generous amount on his palms before rubbing them together. He covered the expanse of Steve’s bottom, paying special attention to the inner cheeks.  He placed a hand on the small of his back to soothe the touch-starved man, who was breathing through his mouth, eyes closed.
“Of course, it does,” Tony agreed, pressing a soft kiss to his temple. “I'll give you the belt,” he whispered in his ear.
Tony ignored his pleas, so Steve sighed and resumed the position. In no time, warm hands were on his bottom, examining the damage it had taken.
A hand stroked Tony’s length while the other fondled his balls, and the combination of sensations turned his brains to mush. “Steve… Oh Steve!”
“They used to be, until they developed a more violent agenda of their own. Order through chaos. Something like that," Steve said, shaking his head. "They're against the accords," he added.
“You see,” Tony said slowly, slipping his finger back inside his soft cunt, slowly fucking his sweet boy, who was so so so soft, warm and tight. “We're going to need a new home.” His fingers moved in a slow circle, stretching the ring of muscle. “This cabin is a real tight squeeze. I mean there’s barely any room for two,” he said, stressing the word as he inserted a second finger, drawing a choked gasp from Steve, who squeezed back in response.
“No. No. Now. Please. Just please. Fuck me now,” Steve gasped, tears running down his cheeks as his fists crunched the dried leaves under the blankets.
That’s not what his father says. Tony is a Stark after all, and as such, excellence runs in his veins. With his potential and pedigree, anything less than perfection is practically a moral failing.
They’re both wearing entirely too much clothing, a problem Tony quickly remedies by unbuttoning Steve’s shirt with his teeth while he makes quick work of Steve’s button fly.
“And remain silent for the term of six years after said agreement,” the second faerie finishes, bounding ahead of the first. “If you fail in either task, you will share in their fate.”
“It was cancer. Steve didn’t tell any of us, except Bucky before we shipped out, and Bucky didn’t tell me until she died. You know how the guy is. He probably thought she’d get better and didn’t want to be a bother.”
Steve blindly reaches out, managing to grab Stark’s retreating forearm on the second try. “Stay,” he says, his voice scratchy and sleep-soft.
“No no no… it sounds like you’re in love with the guy,” Rhodey clarifies. He begins to giggle softly to himself at the idea.
Steve had done what he always did when confronted with a bully and punched him square on the nose, but Hodge didn’t go down as easily as Brock. He retaliated, laying Steve flat in the dirt with a well-executed kata. That had led to a scuffle Steve couldn’t hope to win, but then again, he never knew when to quit.
“Okay, just so we’re clear,” he turns to a side cabinet, opening it to find it disappointingly empty. “We’re here a couple days until Rhodey can tow us out, and then a couple more days so I can repair the damage and restock.” He looks over his shoulder, “I’m going to take stock of what is left of my ship and what parts I need so I can relay the information to Rhodey. Why don’t you make yourself useful and find a water source, maybe forage some berries or whatever you learned to do at Jedi scouts–”
It was a warm, summer evening, so they lay on their blankets with only the night sky for cover. The forest floor was a good bed - soft, thick with several inches of soil. Gazing at the blanket of stars, they munched on wild berries and talked about the ceasefire and the rebuilding efforts, heartened by the progress on that front.
“We’ll have to keep searching,” Tony said, moving deliberately slowly in search of the spot which drove Steve wild. “Until we find the perfect spot,” he said as Steve screamed and shuddered, sobbing into the blankets.
“Zemo,” Steve echoed, with contempt. From his satchel, Steve pulled out a box and handed it to Tony. “We found this among his possessions, at our last raid. I think it belonged to your father.”
Still panting, Steve rested his head on the bed beside Tony’s. He placed his weight on his knees and elbows, careful not to crush him under his weight.
“Freedom,” Tony scoffed. “A noble idea. How many men are truly free? You think I chose this life? That I chose to be a king? Do you think I enjoy this? Every widow made by my decision? Every child orphaned by my will? These are
The boy had ridden back in disgrace, arms bound behind his back, feet lashed to the stirrups. Nonetheless, he kept his back straight and head held high, like a wild horse one sometimes found at the fringe of the forest. As he passed the gates, he looked directly at Tony, blue eyes blazing with the heat of a thousand suns, defiant even in defeat.
Inwardly, Steve groaned. He didn’t want any more punishment, and not on his hole, but there was no point in begging. He learnt that the hard way. “Yes, sir,” he said instead, trying his best to be the good boy Tony wanted him to be.
. Tony smiled indulgently at the scribbles in the margins denouncing the monarchy, tickled by the hand-drawn moustaches and beards. It was a gesture which spoke volumes, even if Tony was the only one who understood. It was Steve’s way of telling him - that he was the only one who mattered.
When Tony sat down on the edge and lowered his trousers, Steve didn’t have to be told what to do. His mouth was around Tony in a second, his lips moving up and down on his shaft.
Tony had already calmed down from that morning when he discovered the rebel’s escape, on Gerald, his noble steed no less. It was by a stroke of luck that his guards had caught up with the young rider before he reached the forest.
Tony remembered the first time they’d met. The boy was on his knees, head on the ground, under the toe of Stane’s filthy boot. His legs were tucked neatly under his body, back and bottom covered with the marks of a single-tailed whip.
“All eyes were on you, following the sway of your hips, staring at the jiggle of your round ass. They have no right to look at you like that. You’re mine,” Steve complained, and stuck out his bottom lip unhappily.
Steve turned his head to meet his gaze. “A lot of things you don’t see from up there on your throne.”
“Oh, baby,” Steve sighed. “Have you any idea how you look, all pink and wet and waiting for me?” he asked, before he pressed his warm lips against his entrance, tickling the insides of his cheeks with his beard.
“I do,” Steve said, and a small smile spread across his face. He leaned down for a soft kiss. “I love you, too.”
“You’re mine,” Steve said, as he reached for Tony’s cock and stroked it in time with his thrusts. “Mine,” he repeated when he pressed a soft kiss in the middle of his forehead, still driving into him. “Mine,” he whispered into his ear as he nibbled on his earlobe.
Tony followed closely on his heels, shouting out warnings as he tried his best to stay out of the way. “Steve!” he cried, pulling the shield out of a tree and hurling it at him at one point when he was outnumbered.
“Don’t pretend you don’t want this, you manipulative asshole,” Steve retorted, a knowing smirk on his lips.
penance, for daring to go against nature, for daring to take what could never be his. And he would have to bear it for the rest of his life.
It was a warm evening, so they were comfortable in their underclothes, neither of them embarrassed by the lack of clothing. Using branches that Steve had skinned and sharpened at one end, they skewered the fish and roasted them over the fire, shoving the thick end of the spit into the ground to free their hands.
Tony's hand rested at the back of Steve's head, cupping his face as their breaths mingled. He raked his hand through the soft locks, lowering his own body until nothing remained between them, the warm press of Steve's chest setting his body on fire. As he kissed his warm lips, he could feel the heat spreading through his body, smothering him with fumes. Still, he delved deeper, allowing the flames to swallow him whole.
Tony fisted his hand in Steve’s hair, pulling the man off as he handed him the bottle of oil. Steve coated his length, spreading it from the tip to his balls.
“No,” Tony said. “I’m not going to punish you for running. You were doing what you believed in. That’s all we can ever do.”
Tony parted the swollen cheeks to peek at the rosy flesh between, focusing his gaze on the tender pink bud. He stroked the rim with his thumb, gently tracing circles as the boy squirmed, fully aware of what awaited him. He’d been warned. The next time he betrayed Tony, his sweet boycunt would pay the price.
Tony had kept him against his will. Forced him into a relationship. And hurt him too. Steve should run as far as he could. Why would he even want to come back?
The bubble burst, and the weight of failure sank to the bottom of Tony’s stomach. He let out a deep sigh, thoroughly defeated. He’d exhausted his options, used the very last weapon in his arsenal, but still, his rebel refused to yield.
Tony had never expected the blotchy smudged scribblings of a farewell note to be honoured, and he was deeply moved.
Steve shot him a dark look. “Obviously not enough,” he whispered harshly and nibbled on an earlobe. “Do you have any idea how you looked, dressed in that see-through number with those pants hugging your round ass?"
“Very well,” Tony said, running the leather tip over the smooth, round bottom. “Let’s see if this will change your mind.”
Tony sank to the ground, hands fumbling to untie Steve’s long legs from the bedposts. He rubbed gently at the ankles, chafed from struggling against his bonds before he untied the ropes that bound Steve’s hands, kissing away the indentations of coarse rope.
And Tony couldn’t ignore their demands. It would start a coup, the very last thing he needed in the middle of a revolution.
“What happens now?” Tony asked, the next morning, as he watched Steve saddle the horses in preparation of their long journey.
“Yes,” Tony said with a happy sigh as he rubbed himself against the rough fabric, but the heat and friction barely did anything for the ache down in his belly.
Tony's arm snaked around Steve’s waist, hoisting him up. “Walk,” he said, nudging Steve away from where a crowd had gathered.
“You know, if I were a more traditional alpha, I’d take a belt to your ass, make sure you won’t be sitting for days.”
Tony slid a hand down Steve’s body, caressing his hip and his bottom, his fingers gliding between his inner cheeks, dancing around the young man’s hole. Pressing his lips to Steve’s ear, he asked, “Did you feel me that morning when you left?”
He turned Steve over, so he lay on his elbows and knees, punished bottom in the air. With a steady hand, he drizzled the oil from the bottle directly down the cleft, spreading it evenly so a thick layer coated the swollen boycunt, and slowly worked his fingers into the pretty pink rose.
Steve moaned. The oil was warm, but the rubbing kindled it so it felt like he was on fire. Tony ignored his protests, pouring more oil down his crack, carefully working his oiled fingers into Steve's hole. Finally, he slipped the metal plug inside to keep it all in. It was the large one, too, for punishment.
Tony sometimes wondered where Steve even considered his home, now that Brooklyn had been razed to the ground, in revenge for what they’d done to his parents. It had to be the redwood forests that bordered the city, where the rebel base was rumoured to be.
Steve nodded, placing his arms around Tony instead. He rocked with him, moving in time to Tony’s thrusts, desperately chasing his relief. If Tony came before him, he wasn’t going to be able to come at all. Thankfully, he’d been well-stimulated and his release came quickly.
Tony hummed. “You know, you're right. Your poor bottom has had quite enough,” he said, and Steve felt himself feeling light with hope. Then, Tony’s hands were spreading his cheeks, giving Tony a good view of what lay between. Tony stroked his cleft, drawing circles around his hole. “But we’ve neglected this, haven’t we?”
“Oh,” Tony said, the air rushing out of his lungs as his heart swelled to twice its usual size. “Funny how you once said you couldn’t give your heart to me.”
Tony ran his fingers lightly over his sore bottom, tracing the welts that had been left behind, making little sounds of satisfaction. “Feeling all right, baby?” he asked.
“When did you wax?” Tony asked, placing his thumb directly on his hole as he stroked his smooth perineum.
Tony moved his hands to the back of Steve's head, stroking the young man's hair as he searched his hopeful eyes. “I don’t know”, he answered, hesitantly. “Look, I want to, all right? I really do. But that will just make it harder in the morning when you leave. You know, it really hurt me when you left.”
Tony turned Steve to lie on his back, carefully bending his knees to relieve the pressure on his sore bottom. Tony broke the kiss, peppering Steve’s neck with lighter ones, kissing a trail down the flat planes of his stomach before finding his cock.
Tony put down the crop to review the results of his work – red stripes covering the graceful swell of his bottom to the middle of strong thighs. He ran his fingers gently over the raised lines, eliciting a whimper from the well-punished boy, whose body continued trembling with violent sobs.
Steve’s eyes flew open and he turned to face him, looking horrified at the insinuation. “No,” he said. “No one.”
Steve didn’t last very long, soon spurting ribbons of come onto the bed, some of it dripping onto Tony’s fingers. With Steve finding his pleasure, Tony followed soon after, as he had no wish to prolong the young man’s misery.
Steve groaned softly into the bed before he rose to a kneeling position and straddled Tony’s hips, even as they continued to stay locked together.
“Perfect. This will make the crop more enjoyable. Don’t move,” Tony ordered before leaving him, presumably to fetch the wicked riding crop.
“You’re so perfect like this,” Tony said. “But knowing you, it won't be long before you're right back here. Am I right?"
Tony swallowed his hurt, barely masking his pain. “Why? Why do you have to fight me all the time? Is your life here so hard? Do you hate me all that much?”
Tony blinked in surprise, looking from Steve to the cabin and back to him. “Is this a permanent arrangement? Don't you live in housing of some sort?” he asked.
Unlike Steve, Tony had no love for that man. Notwithstanding the fact that he’d killed his parents, Tony hated his perfect hair and well-proportioned features, especially those large brown eyes filling with tears when Steve had offered his freedom in exchange for his life. He could still remember the man’s impassioned pleas.
Tony allowed his eyes to roam over Steve’s naked body. His hands hovered over his skin, drawing soft gasps and short sighs each time they made contact. “Look at you,” he said, gently squeezing one of his thighs. “All grown up now.”
He wondered if Steve would think of him on occasion, hopefully not as an adversary, but a lover who’d once shared his bed. What would be his favourite memory? Would he remember the first time he tried chocolate and made such delicious sounds of pleasure that Tony commandeered the city’s next shipment for his personal use? Or the first time he’d had a warm bath, delighting in the novelty of scented bubbles?
“Oh!” Tony moaned as sweeping fingers brushed over his sweet spot. He bit his bottom lip to stifle another moan. “Is it working?” he asked.
It was a bittersweet moment - two bodies joined as one even when they were really worlds apart. Tony bit back a sob, muffling the sound with Steve’s shoulder. It was for this reason that he chose to take Steve from behind. He wasn’t going to let his lover see him crying. It was their final moment together and it was going to be perfect.
Between his sobs, the boy could barely string a sentence, yet Tony understood the devastating words. “All that I have is yours – the richest food, the finest clothes, the softest bed. Still, you would rather be with your friends, starving in the cold, as you plot the next protest or maybe even my death?”
Tony turned to face the younger man, cupping the side of his face with his hand, just in time to wipe away a tear. “Hey, hey. I’m not mad. I’m not mad at you for leaving,” Tony said, stroking his cheekbone and wiping away another tear as he tried to reassure the young man that nothing had been held against him. It appeared to work and Steve began to calm down. Nonetheless, he kept his hand on Steve’s cheek, tracing the trembling lips with his thumb.
“Not sorry for running though?” Tony asked, noticing the omission. “You’re going to try again, aren’t you?”
Those in attendance had gawked at his outburst. It was objectively absurd, for the king to be defending a thief, an enemy of the state. How could he have such strong feelings for someone he’d never met?
Tony paused at the doorway of the bedroom, desperately trying to catch his breath and slow the pounding of his heart. As always, his thoughts raced ahead of him, but he needed to calm down and focus.
Steve flinched at his tone, swallowing hard before dropping the subject. For a while, they said nothing, just watching the fish browning over the grill before devouring it with their hands. It was far from the best meal Tony had had, but it was warm and satisfying after going a whole day without any form of nourishment.
“Don’t,” Steve said, waving away his apology. “You gave me a home. This was my choice,” he said as Tony's heart ached at the thought of his precious boy living in these conditions, alone.
“I believe you,” Tony said, planting a kiss on the middle of his bottom, where a red mark was beginning to appear. “Shhh… Shhh… It’s all right, my love. You’re doing so well. Can you turn over now? Turn around and lie on your back?”
Steve’s rim burned with a different kind of sensation. Tony paused for a few moments, giving him time to adjust. Slowly and lazily, Tony thrust in and out of his hole, before progressing to erratic, unpredictable strokes. “You feel so good. So so so good. My good boy,” he said. “You’re so beautiful like this.”
It didn’t take long before Tony was gasping and moaning. “Oh - oh Steeeeeeve!!!” he moaned as he spilled all over his stomach, his thighs trembling from the waves of pleasure still cresting through his body.
Tony had exploded, rebuking the pompous general, threatening him with a whipping of his own. The boy was stealing Tony’s plans in Tony’s study in Tony’s palace. That made him Tony’s captive. What authority did Stane or anyone else have to lay a finger on or in
With his other hand, Tony squeezed Steve’s cock, stroking it slowly and rubbing around his tip. “Brooklyn has got potential but I'm not sure - if I like the hustle and bustle of city life,” he said, increasing the pace of his thrusts, before inserting a third finger, causing Steve to moan loudly and arch his back.
It didn’t take long for Steve to reach his climax. He came with his head thrown back, eyes closed and lips parted, sobbing his pleasure as he spilled over his stomach. Tony fucked him through his orgasm, watching Steve as he lay, calm and pliant, waiting for him to reach his. It came swiftly, the waves of pleasure building up at the base of his cock, before cresting as he spilled deep inside his boy, marking his insides.
“Yes,” he said, looking at him, as if pleading with him to understand. “Because then I would get to choose. Then, I would be free.”
“No, not at all.” Tony put his arms around the small of his back as Steve pressed a soft kiss to his neck.
His next stop was the study, where he found Steve’s sketchbooks, filled with sketches of the palace and its curios. He would want to show them to his mates, find a point of entry and finish the mission that Steve started.
Steve gave him a sideways look and let out a whistle. It took a while for Tony to hear it the unmistakeable sound of hoofbeats. The white horse was magnificent - sturdy and well-built, clearly bred for battle, but it was the one behind, dark brown with a white star on his head, which made his heart stop.
They kissed for a long time. It could have been seconds, minutes or hours. Tony neither knew nor cared. It felt like time had stopped as the world crumbled to their feet. There was no pain, no suffering, no war.
Steve begged, pleading for mercy and for the punishment to stop, but Tony remained impassive to his cries. It was probably just as hard for him to ignore Steve’s pained whimpers, but Tony always gave him exactly what he needed.
“Oh. That is nice. That is real nice, sweetheart,” Steve told him in a hoarse whisper, and showed his appreciation with a round of applause on his bottom, where a few sharp smacks landed dangerously close to his twitching hole and full balls. “Want you on your back now. Legs up.”
Tony wasn’t even afraid, having lost the ability to feel anything else apart from despair, now that the love of his life had left. He just couldn't bring himself to care, not even about prosperity, peace or progress, when he had no queen by his side. He'd given up on finding one. Not one of the beauties in his harem could hold a candle to his Steve - a beacon in the dark, who burned fiercely as he left stars in his wake. Someone like Steve could never belong to anyone. Tony wasn’t supposed to want him, much less try to hold on to him, and keep him for his own.
“Beautiful,” Tony said, admiring his little display of humility. “I think I’ll keep you like this for a while, let the lesson sink in.” Tony’s fingers trailed over his hole and the cleft, finally cupping his balls. “How do you feel?” he asked.
He’d asked if Steve wanted to stop, promised to wait as long as he needed. But Steve, his hotheaded lover, had demanded that they keep going, even threatening to kill Tony at one point if he dared to pull away. Tony had obliged, kissing the soft pout with desire, before finding his warm ass and burying himself inside.
The exit led them right into the middle of the forest. Looking at the rows of trees surrounding them, a bone-deep weariness began to settle on him. “You know what?” Tony said, planting his tired ass firmly on the grass. “Just leave me here," he said, only half-joking. "It’s a good place to die. Where else am I gonna find a view like this?”
Tony pulled him closer, pressing a kiss to the middle of his lower back. He held him tightly, keeping his voice even, despite his desperation, resisting the urge to beg. “Look at how your body responds. You belong to me. Tell me you’ll stay. Promise that you won’t run.”
