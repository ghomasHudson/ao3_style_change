“We’ll just have to do it like this.”
“No,” Sherlock replies finally. “I can just... sit in the library.”
The door clicks shut behind him.
“Sherlock?”
Rachel, Jennifer Wilson’s only daughter, is dead, has been for 14 years, was never actually alive, born dead, and Sherlock can’t understand that anyone would go through such a painful experience as scratching the name of someone dead for over a decade on the floorboards with their fingernails.
“You have a new life ahead of you now. A clean slate. I have made sure that not even I can bring back the evidence of your past life. You are safe now.”
“Your hand is in my pants. Again.”
People you love, people who love you.
“You’re kind, you care, you comfort me when I’m upset,” John helps.
“This is as far as it goes,” he says.
Victor told him about his childhood, his numerous pets, his siblings who had all scattered to the ends of the earth before he was even born, the nanny called Margaret he had had until he was of age. Sherlock remembered his own nannies, the nameless, faceless creatures that had appeared and then departed, who he must have loved at some point. People his mother had hired only for convenience’s sake. She would raise her own children, she had told her husband, and since Mycroft was already ten years old when she had decided she wanted one more son, raising Sherlock proved to be “like riding a bicycle, everything just took care of itself.”
It looks like the landscape is reflected on John’s face, in his eyes, and Sherlock thinks his never seen anything more beautiful.
, like a cross on the IPA chart. He wonders how it can be so different when said by two such different people. The dark velvet of his brother’s voice, full of comfort and hope, and the simmering chocolate of the slightly nasal Irish accent that makes his skin crawl.
, please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?”
John has shrunken to a dot. It’s easier to do it like this. He couldn’t come down if he wanted to, and even if he could, he wouldn’t want to.
While Sherlock never forgot, he did not let it show.
“I think that’s the most sincere thing you have ever said to me. And I haven’t seen you that embarrassed since you thought I was coming on to you at Angelo’s.”
He turns to go, his legs feeling like they will give out under him as he takes the first shaky steps.
“Say it. Give me hope.”
“The plan is not for you to win this war alone,” Mr Holmes interrupted him. “It is to move adequate amount of resources to where they can’t be afforded to be missing at the moment, even with the minimal ones we
The body that is still in the boot of Jim’s car.
repeats the voice.
But he did not know what love was back then. He only knew that the girl had cheeks red like cherries and a laugh like soap bubbles and that when she danced with him, he never wanted to let go.
He is twenty-seven years old and sitting on the floor of his flat, a used needle lying innocently among the shattered glassware.
Sherlock clenched his hand. His voice sounded like a snarl.
Sherlock had come to stand behind him, hovering over his shoulder as he put the rifle back together.
“Or maybe that was his name, I’m not quite sure.”
Three hours later John had fallen asleep against Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock himself was bored out of his mind. Continuing John’s earlier task of counting the tiles had not proven to be a long-term way to kill time, so he had been calculating how long a line they would make and how much plaster had been required to put them in place. He was on his way to concluding how many Lestrades standing on their heads would fit in the room when John startled awake.
They curl up in John’s bed (Sherlock uses the nostalgia card again and says the sheets remind him of the ones they had at home and that they make him feel less ill), and John reluctantly agrees to be naked if Sherlock in turn promises to keep his clothes on.
The visit has been a sort of Watson family reunion as well, their mother and father and some nameless relatives arriving all at once to comment on the state of Harry’s flat and the state of her health and the state of her now non-existent marriage and the state of her life in general, and she needed all the support she could get. Mrs Holmes, having listened to John’s apologies over the phone, had ensured him that he should be with his family and that their party would only be a minor event anyway, only the closest friends, only the immediate family.
It’s nothing like the drugs. It doesn’t flow like melted honey into his veins and make him feel blissed out and light as air. Before the bliss of unconsciousness sets in, it burns and sears and floods his veins, making his blood boil and feel like he is set on fire from the inside.
Sherlock pats a spot on the blanket.
A man had appeared by his elbow, tall and elegant in his black suit, clearly having just arrived for snow still glowed in his hair.
Luckily, Mr Hartley seemed to be an excellent judge of the situations surrounding him and saw John’s discomfort. Stepping aside, he offered John the chair he had been sitting in and pulled another one for himself.
“You are exceptionally odd.”
“I have read your file and it is a great moment in any officer’s life to meet a true war hero.”
He goes back to his old habits, making John get stuff for him, from as high up as he can think, staring intently as John reaches for the burned light bulb, dusty shelf (“Mrs Hudson shouldn’t do all the work, John!”), important documents he has folded into aeroplanes and flung on top of the bookshelf. All the while wearing the jumper that hugs his form and barely covers his back.
Everything he had not permitted himself to feel, everything forbidden and shameful, everything sinful, everything that had begun to trickle back to the surface after years of suppressing it burst out in a sudden rush of the finches taking flight, in a deafening music of rustling leaves and bird song that seemed to fill the entire world.
The rest was lost under the sudden quiet click of the door as John shut it behind himself. Sherlock turned around only to see his dark form descending the steps to the yard and run towards the forest.
Perhaps, Sherlock thought, he should not be surprised. After all, he himself had not done any of this either, but then again, that’s what
anyone or anything except my own company and you can believe me that all I was doing was sleep.”
She snickers.
“She’s an old lady. I’m not going to be an old lady’s lover.”
He tosses Sherlock’s loot in the general direction of the bunch of constables gathered nearest to them and starts directing Sherlock towards the only civilian car on the park road. Behind him Lestrade groans. It’s his car and it’s new.
“That’s what I was suggesting,” he fingers the piece of brochure for the Chinese circus he picked up last night and stuffed in his pocket, thinking it would be the perfect excuse to get John to come out with him for some fresh air.
John bangs the window shut. Sherlock has crashed on the bed, making it shake with his shivers and reminding John of the very uncomfortable scene in
Sherlock clears his throat.
She waved her hand towards her son. Sherlock, painfully aware that she had enjoyed several toddies already, leaned away slightly to ensure that the rattle the baby was now suckling would not accidentally be smacked away from her by his mother’s waving hands.
“Should I get you a straw?” John grinned.
It’s true, though. He has been dying for a long time. Ever since he started holding Mycroft’s hand on their walks home from school, tears hidden from the other boys tossing gum in his hair between classes. Mycroft saw his sadness and tried to help, did everything Mummy and Daddy didn’t and in the end he hid his sorrow from him as well, hid behind his monster of a brain, perhaps not as big and full of knowledge as Mycroft’s, but more consuming.
“Bad day, was it?” with a laugh. She is nervous about something uninteresting, he isn’t really paying attention.
“Perhaps you should go put socks on,” John suggests to his book.
Never having looked away from him, Mr Trevor peered intently into Sherlock’s face.
” he asks.
“You know why,” he replied.
Sneaking through the kitchen and the sitting room and actually using the front door was obviously out of the question. John would likely alarm Mrs Hudson beforehand and even though she was a frail old lady, her hearing was still perfect and she could scare you half to death with a look and glare lightnings that hit you in the heels as you ran away.
“They say I should kill you,” Sherlock whispers.
He almost tears the pocket of his dressing gown in two as he fishes the phone out and types in the four digits.
“Queen and country!” Sherlock yells from the kitchen as he empties the bucket into the bin.
“Thank you,” John takes a sip. “You know, I once tried to count them all.”
“Sherlock.”
“Have you ever had anyone?”
“Do you shoot?” John asked.
“You are better with him. And he is better with you. In the end, does the road really matter if the outcome is worth fighting for?”
There’s no one there.
“Why? You feeling bad that I didn’t get the information you needed and failed miserably at what is apparently the only way I am useful to you?”
“No, you need food. Take your hand so I can go and make us breakfast.”
That stops him. Ice and heat flush through him at the same time, he has turned to stone, he is a marble statue. And now John’s hand is in his hair.
Lestrade drives them. At Baker Street, John stumbles out of the car with Sherlock glued to his back. They get through the door, collide with the small table in the corner, and the noise makes Mrs Hudson peak through her door. Her hands go to her mouth and John shakes his head quickly, mouths confirmation that everything is okay with Sherlock (physically) and she nods and watches their slow ascend upstairs.
“It is unusual but Sherlock’s case is borderline extreme. He has been ill for years, his first hallucination - that I know off - dates back over fifteen years and his depression is highly likely to be older than that. You do know he was addicted to cocaine?”
He looked up to see him smiling at him, his voice void of all embarrassment or need for privacy.
Sherlock blushes and looks at his shoes.
“Yes,” Mycroft replied.
“Having fun?”
“What, now?”
He watched from the window as John’s figure appeared from the thin spring mist gathering among the trees. The steady noise from the radio lulled him into a trance, allowed him to sink into the moment, to relax into watching John come out from the shadows, stomp his boots as he went, a rifle slung over his shoulder, the Enfield against his hip.
“To take a shower.”
Of course, John gets it all wrong but no matter. His presence, having someone to say things to out loud helps Sherlock figure out who the shoes must belong to.
He is four years, nine months and six days old, though everyone thinks he is older because of his books, his height, and the way he dresses.
The next time John went into the woods, Sherlock took the notebook from its pocket and copied everything down. After that, every private moment he had was spent translating the complicated shorthand. He tried every possible way to break the code he could think of, even dove into his books to remind himself of what he had forgotten. There was a pattern, he was sure of it. John was nothing if not meticulous, and there was a scribble on the top left of each page to indicate what had to be the date but not even those provided the necessary key.
“Never been,” Irene Adler says, sitting in John’s chair, looking at him softly and full of interest. “Is it nice?”
Sherlock’s head whips up.
The noise Sherlock makes is lovely, though. John tries moving his foot again.
“I should have seen it,” he gulps. “I should have known, I should have made it better. I could have
Thank you
“Trust you to come up with a proposal when I least expect it.”
Sherlock knew. John didn’t have to open his coat to show him what was under it.
They stay glued together until the sun finally reaches their windowpane and they feel ready to face the coming day.
“’Good morning.’ ‘I like your funny hat.’ ‘I’m sad tonight, let’s have dinner.’ ‘You look sexy on Crimewatch, let’s have dinner.’ ‘I’m not hungry. Let’s have dinner.’”
John reaches for the hands clutching the side of the table and takes them in his.
Sherlock had gnawed his own nails down to the flesh. He had even torn his cuticles to shreds so that his fingers felt like they were on fire, the epidermis angry and red.
“Yes, very. Is that news to you?”
He doesn’t need to see the powder burns on John’s fingers. He stands at ease behind the police tape, hands behind his back, eyes locking momentarily with Sherlock’s. And he knows. He must have seen Sherlock getting to the cab through a window, he ran to his rescue.
Sherlock presses his forehead against the door and breathes in. Behind the wood, the shower is turned on, the water starts running, the room fills with steam, and Sherlock pretends he can hear John’s bathrobe hit the floor (he knows John, overly meticulous, always hangs up his bathrobe before climbing in the shower, but it would be more dramatic this way, John’s bathrobe dropping to the floor in a pile of cotton, revealing everything in one smooth motion, his legs, torso, abdomen, shoulders, the scar the scar
Such an ordinary woman and yet she can still surprise Sherlock. She begins to speak of the murder they have been investigating, of course familiar with the case by knowing what some nameless policeman likes.
And stops short.
John reached for the teapot and turned back to the sink. Furious, Sherlock stood up and walked out the door.
Sherlock shakes himself slightly and squeezes back.
He orders John to read out the email address from Jennifer Wilson’s suitcase, types it and R-a-c-h-e-l in with dramatic taps of the keyboard and opens a map of London with a red dot indicating the location of the missing phone Jennifer Wilson in all her cleverness planted on the murderer when he wasn’t looking.
She looks up at him.
“Once again, John, I know how to swim...”
He turns his head to look at the magnificent fireplace, one of the few in the building still functioning, never meeting Victor’s eyes.
John puts the clippers away and takes out the small scissors from the emergency kit. He takes a tuff of hair between his fingers and cuts a few inches off. Sherlock is crying silently into the sink, the tears turning crimson as they run down his face.
He stops pacing. They’re at a crime scene, surrounded by the police and facing a gory sight of a body chopped to bits and placed in a triangle, perfectly clean of blood and excrements, interesting, enticing, wonderful.
Sherlock moves behind him and slides his hand over John’s stomach to rest on his other hipbone and stares up into the sky. Squinting, he steps in and takes John’s hand. Pointing with the index finger, he connects a group of stars to draw a palm tree that stays glimmering in the sky.
“Sherlock, I didn't mean the Donald Duck comment as ---“
“Sherlock.”
“Occasionally, yes, when I remember, when my landlady insists,” Sherlock mumbles, pretending to look for something, anything, among the chaos on his table, so he doesn’t have to see John’s face.
“Yes.”
John Watson is sitting in his armchair doing a crossword puzzle, and it looks like he is actually going to finish it as an inhabitant of 221B Baker Street.
Standing on his wobbling feet, trying to hold his head up high, Sherlock meets the stare of the man leaning against the doorframe, a pondering look on his face, takes a step forward suddenly and blocks Sherlock’s way.
“Ch-ch-cold…”
He wondered if he would be able to sneak out while John was in the shower. But John showered in the evenings, and the time he took in the loo in the mornings would not be sufficient enough to allow an escape via a second-floor window without breaking anything in the process. Then again, John would probably take extensive measures in securing the window before going to bed.
He attempted to wedge his face against the mug of coffee again so that the rim would not touch anything but his lips and managed for a moment. Then the hot liquid spilled over and dripped on his shirt. He cursed, but did not bother to clean himself up. The coffee stains were just a minor addition to the smears of blood on his collar.
But not before Moriarty has walked out again and gone into hiding.
The rifle dropped to the ground with a heavy thud, followed by the limp form of the soldier, his lower body trapping Sherlock on the ground.
It is a beautiful day, sunny and warm. Sherlock feels light and finally able to breathe again after being locked inside for what feels like forever.
John is strong. He will recover.
“Old acquaintances,” Jim says before Sherlock has the chance to ask.
“He said we’re only to use it in emergencies.”
Then he gathered himself, shaking off the effects of the intense stare.
“No.”
Sherlock looks round manically, at Jim humming to himself in the corner, at Harriet crying against her mother’s dress, John at the kitchen door, phone still in hand.
He doesn’t put it all together before it’s almost too late, but suddenly he knows exactly where to look. The first answer was on her body, the key code to her safe the measurements to what hides her best, the skin, flesh and bones covering her heart. This, her life, must be something much more intimate.
“Anyway, happy birthday.”
He sounded young, so so young, but experienced, his voice hardened by years of army and war.
But he can’t help a startled retreat and a silent gasp as he sees the clay model of the enormous footprint Fletcher, the boy running the tourist walks, pulls out from his bag. A little boy at the back of his mind screams for him to run, run and hide. He doesn’t let it show, only pulls out he fifty pounds he lost in the made-up bet with Fletcher’s condescending smile hovering over him like a spotlight. John pockets his winnings, finishes his beer and follows Sherlock to the parking lot.
Press play.
Lost in thought, he doesn’t realise that John’s slight snores have stopped. He doesn’t notice the change in the rhythm of his breathing, just watches the rise and fall of his back, thinks,
Bang of the door and Sherlock is left alone in the dark.
“Not good?” Sherlock asks him.
“Who are you talking to?” he whispers.
“No. I think you’re that particular when it comes to pork pie and when you haven’t eaten in two days.”
He leaves one of Mrs Hudson’s flower vases directly in front of the door and sneaks back upstairs.
) and his hands stop with a metallic clank only a few inches from where they are resting in his lap. He jerks awake, world swimming in front of his eyes, the humming more insistent now (
The room is enveloped in darkness. Sherlock listens to John’s breathing in the surrounding silence, straining to hear any unusual sounds.
about anyone.”
It’s impossible to speak with such little amount of oxygen flowing to your brain.
He was dying, and John saved his life. He would have swallowed the pill, didn’t even know if he was right or wrong, it didn’t matter. There was nothing to live for anymore.
Then the windswept man appears in his office, asking about body parts widely recognised as erogenous zones, and he thinks,
“And did those whispers have a name?” Sherlock presses.
“I don’t care,” John snarled.
The next Wednesday was the coldest day of the winter. Mycroft and Mr Trevor arrived early, eagerly running up the icy steps to the Holmes’ door towards warmth and drinks. Having disappeared to the far end of the house to make sure every fireplace in every room had a roaring fire in them, Mrs Holmes was not there to receive them. So when she arrived to the sitting room where the guest was being offered an aperitif by the able butler, she was astonished to see her youngest son already there, engaged in discussion with Mr Trevor. Mycroft, it seemed, though standing securely by his associate’s elbow, could just as well have been in the Antarctic. The two were so deeply engaged in conversation that Mr Trevor only noticed his hostess when she had stood by his elbow clearing her throat for several minutes.
Mr Hartley looked for a moment like he did not believe what John was saying. Then he gathered himself, put his glasses back on and suddenly he was again the MI6 agent that had been sent to recruit a retired MO to serve his country once again together with the most insufferable arsehole as well as the most intelligent man he had had the misfortune to meet.
John senses him staring, he always does, and turns to look.
Sherlock collects, gathers and catalogues and the image of John inside his mind palace gets stronger and clearer. He smells and feels every part of John and every surface in the flat to get him right in any possible situation. He categorizes John’s sexual preferences into a bookshelf he keeps cleanest and most organized, and makes sure he won’t trip on anything on his way there, always accessible, always necessary.
“Your comfort comes second to my ability to hear my own thoughts. So shut up, Anderson, and don’t move.”
“Then again, if the Führer decides troops need to be sent to inspect a small patch of forest by the Welsh coast, perhaps a wolf or two is just what he needs to ensure himself that his Lebensraum should be cut short just on the edge of Cornwall.”
But John just drains his beer and slams it on the table.
“Yeah, that’s going to sting in the morning,” John informed him, skimming his fingers over his scalp gently. “You will have a bump the size of a goose egg.”
“I had to!” Sherlock bellows. “Jim was killing people! The explosions were all him. And now he has Irene and Harriet! I needed to think.”
He looked at his watch again. He had less than half an hour before the car would come pick him up from his home, even less if Mr Holmes realised where he had disappeared and he would arrive to Mulberry Terrace to see another car waiting for him there.
“I may have to ask you for something soon.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, the great Sherlock Holmes!”
He turns to Irene.
“John?”
The only possibility would be to take the gun while he slept, which in turn would be a useful experiment in how deep John’s slumber was. It would be interesting to see whether John gave himself enough time to recognise him or shoot him standing.
He hasn’t been in touch lately either. Sherlock inspects Irene’s letter, reads the words voraciously, starved for contact with his old friends. With John gone away for two weeks to visit his family in the north, the flat is quiet and deserted. Sherlock has noticed he has already begun to talk to himself in order to have
“I’ve seen people blown to bits by IEDs. I’ve had to dig into the mess to pick up anything recognisable enough to be able to tell their families that their son or daughter has actually died. I’ve lost good friends to bombs.”
Mycroft must have had something to do with it. He's been calling Sherlock twice every half hour now when before he only tried once every hour.
Sherlock glances over his microscope again. John is looking at the crime scene photos, he has not heard. He does that face, that angry/musing face that fits him so well. He has the perfect lips for it.
Without a word, Donovan pulls out a regular A4-piece of paper from the bottom of the file and gives it to him. John inspects the letters cut from newspapers and magazines, frowns at the words promising more devastation with no remorse and refers to recent bombings done by certain fascist groups, describing them as beautiful, works of art and only a small example of what he himself is about to do.
“Good choice,” he says to Sherlock’s wiggling toes. “My nana knitted those. The yarn has aloe vera in it.”
Lestrade laughs and relaxes against the backrest of his chair.
-with-a-bastard-who-forgets-that-the-springs-are-on-hair-trigger-and-the-box-locks-from-the-outside-phobic!”
He almost uses again, three times. Every time he sees John’s face in front of him just when he is about to pierce the needle through his skin. John never looks disappointed or disgusted, only concerned and sad.
With a last smile at the thought of the text, John turns his focus to the elderly lady worried sick about the strange blisters on her wrists, just on the slight sliver of tanned skin between the white of her hands and arms.
“I can feel these ones too,” John said, waving his other hand slightly, Sherlock’s face going back and forth with it as he was still busy bestowing kisses on the knuckles.
Sherlock loved Mrs Hudson, that much was obvious. He would have laid down his life to protect her, had in fact several times. He appreciated Lestrade and Molly and trusted them with his life. He had clearly given up with Mycroft, but there was something deeper between those two. Let them call it sibling rivalry, the main thing was Mycroft was and always would be there for his brother.
A crash and hurried footsteps from outside their prison informed John that Lestrade had arrived, obviously running straight into the thugs running around the warehouse. John hoped dearly that the man with the machine gun didn’t get a chance to shoot all the Yarders before they could free him and Sherlock.
, struggling with her newly discovered sexuality, likes to try it with comfortable, everyday men just to see if they are any different from the gigolos she was married to, both of whom left her for someone more interesting, before deciding whether to give men another chance or switch completely to stormy lesbians.”
Then. Someone else’s voice at the back of his head.
“Then
John coughed, and both Holmeses turned to stare at him.
“Shh!” Sherlock whispers, goes slowly to the door and looks in the hall. He listen for a moment, then closes the door and goes back to John.
something
, John realised.
He is twiddling a Biro between his fingers, staring at the empty floor like he usually stares at crime scene photos he spreads over the rug like a game of solitaire. John can see how his skin is already starting to crack from the excessive amount of showers. He retreats to the bathroom, swipes a jar of lotion and returns to the sitting room, sits in front of Sherlock on the floor and takes a hold of his calf.
John puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out the pink phone. He throws it on Sherlock’s chair where it sits looking so very innocent, both of them staring at it.
“Used the fifty quid you lost me.”
John smiled, and as he did his mouth seemed to stretch across his face and make it glow.
“I wouldn’t consider that a fault,” Mr Trevor said sipping his drink. “I was just saying to him how remarkable it is that he was able to get little Agatha to quiet down. Whenever I visit the Kovács, she lets out the mightiest howl and won’t stop until I’m gone. I thought she just hates me, but György ensured me she is like that with everyone.”
Sherlock still doesn’t know what love is, but he hopes that if it is anything like what John feels towards dried apricots and Doctor Who, he would very much like it if one day John was to bestow some of it on Sherlock as well.
“Sherlock?” she asks quietly.
Sherlock wanted to talk, but John had shushed him so violently he was afraid to breathe properly, afraid that more German soldiers would come bursting through the forest. Instead he tried to think of other things, pleasant things while John fixed his nose and cleaned his face. Twice he almost fell asleep with his head falling against John’s chest.
He sniffs quietly. His eyes are puffy but Mycroft hasn’t mentioned it, not yet. John begs Mycroft will give Sherlock the illusion that his brother hasn’t caught him crying. He would feel even more surrounded and small.
“No, it can’t. Not if it is inside my pants. I will not cook you an omelette with your hand caresssss--!”
It starts low, the first notes draw along for a while, are repeated twice, no, three times.
“We have to go. There may be more of them. You have to get up.”
Sherlock pulls out a bundle of cash from his coat pocket, his last drug money. He’ll have to come up with a way to get more for tomorrow or he’ll crash. This is not wise. He shouldn’t be here with this woman, spending money on things he knows will only make him feel worse, not numb his senses like the sweet flow of cocaine can.
The heap has been staring at the door, waiting for John to return, and if Sherlock had any energy and a tail, he’d be tapping it on the pillows in his joy of John’s reappearance.
Sherlock’s whole body is so concentrated on following the stick fly to the pool that he completely misses John’s leap at Moriarty’s neck until the sudden movement and the grunt from the consulting criminal pull him back into focus.
Her lips are too close to his and he is still not pulling away.
Light brown moustache, beautiful pale blue eyes, the face red from exertion and the mouth but a tight line.
John folds to his knees in front of him.
They don’t have broadband, so there are not many channels to choose from. Luckily, it’s childrens’ hour still, and they’re showing one of the Chip ‘n’ Dale classics. John is still on his back on the sofa with Sherlock on top of him, and when the squirrels jam Donald in the chimney with a rubber pancake, he makes them both shake with laughter.
“I need your help!”
“And you’re a doctor!” Sherlock exclaims in mock horror.
She never had friends herself, just people she considered worth her time and energy, people with high social status or just enough money to be important. She made sure Mycroft never had any friends either, he was to concentrate on his studies. Sherlock’s friends were a lesser evil, as long as he concentrated on being miserable enough to please her.
“And he gave me 12 hours. I solved the case quickly and that gave me time to get on with other things. We’re one up on him!” he marches to Lestrade’s office.
), creak of the tub and John splashing about.
Sherlock speaks less now, replying to John’s questions only in monosyllables. But he likes to hear John’s voice so John does everything he can to replace the sounds in the flat that used to come from Sherlock alone. He walks from room to room, making tea and cleaning the table and keeping up a running commentary on everything he does. If he is not doing anything, he still goes around slowly, describing the colour of the walls and counting all the mugs they have, one mug, two mugs, three mugs.
“Well, that was tedious,” is all Sherlock says.
Slowly, Sherlock gets up, takes a suitcase from the closet and begins to pack his clothes in it.
Sherlock looks up at him quickly, swiping his eyes over him and behind him to look through the window.
Save file.
It’s like from one of John’s action films. Like mother lifting a truck that has fallen on her child. Superhuman, unnatural, so very, very good.
“Moriarty.”
Might as well test the paint he found on the body now that he has time.
) and he looked up at Sherlock, his mouth hanging open again.
“Sherlock, please, let’s not make a scene,” the woman pleads.
“After I found out, there wasn’t a moment of remorse, not a second of thought about termination. I could finally have something of my own. The man was just a client, in town for a day, never to be heard of again. I could keep the child and no one could have a say into how I raised it.
Sherlock stares.
Inside he feels something similar to a Mentos being dropped into a litre and a half bottle of Coke – a bucket – a bathtub. There is no area wide enough or mint-flavoured sweets packs big enough to compare to the bubbling and welling inside him. He feels like the 60s songs Mycroft used to teach him how to dance to when he was three, like that exceedingly hot summer in Mexico when he was sixteen, like cotton candy and popcorn at a theme park all at once, like being in love.
The map of Westminster flashes in front of his eyes, full of dead ends, traffic lights, zebra crossings, alternative routes.
John strokes Sherlock’s back with his left hand while the right stays on top of his head.
But John is smiling.
“Oh, were you there? I didn’t know we had an audience. I would have used a lot less tongue.”
Shaking his head, he told himself to forget such delusions. The onset of paranoia was the first sign that the lies you had told had been good enough to even fool yourself.
She leans in, her breasts brushing against his chest through the thin dressing gown.
Sherlock sees the confusion.
“I know, but did you? You must have told someone. I see that you did. A friend. A fellow officer, perhaps.”
An arm wrapped around his middle and pulled him down on his back in the grass. Victor’s face hovered over his, his mouth spread in a wide smirk at his surprise, his hair gleaming golden in the warm sunlight.
“Aww, how sweet,” Jim sighs behind them.
John leans in again.
“You can talk, Johnny-boy. Go ahead.”
He wonders what John would have done if he had told him the same thing he tells Molly in the darkened lab after he has realised the worst plan he and Mycroft could come up with is the only way out.
And John does the amazing, unexpected, dazzling thing Sherlock finds beautiful the moment he hears it: he laughs.
John, sitting as close to his husband as possible, hands clutched around his cup of tea, looks carefully at Sherlock who is staring at the table, hands loose on his lap.
“Fine.”
“It’s a problem,” Sherlock says, eyes suddenly on John. “Only a problem. That’s what I do. I… solve problems.”
Puffing a gasp of air against the shell, he retreated slightly in order to peer into Sherlock’s eyes.
“That’s what people
Come Wednesday, John
“They still haunt you?”
His speechlessness persists as Sherlock leads him along the hall towards the gaping hole of an open door.
John nods.
“You’re not real,” he whispers.
And in the forest.
Jim’s eyes barely look his way but they go bottomless for a moment before flicking back to Sherlock. He moves closer, almost touching him as he hovers behind his back.
“Jim?” the man tries. “Jim from the hospital?”
“No, no,” Sherlock rushes over to peck his nose. “Just muttering to myself.”
The fingers pressed tightly against his pulse point.
“Enter,” the familiar deep voice calls from inside.
“This is about the solar system,” he groans.
“Tonight?” John asked, incredulous.
But (and Sherlock ponders on this a lot afterwards as well) this time he actually starts to clear the space round them. To make John more comfortable, to make him stay.
When he returns to the bedroom, Sherlock has taken the hint and ransacked his sock drawer, apparently throwing all the useless ones anywhere but back in the closet. He is in bed once again, blankets cocooned around him so that only his nose is visible.
“We’re good, Sherlock.”
The barrel hit him again.
He turned to look at his brother, whose hands were crossed over his abdomen, inspecting the situation as if he was bored to be in the middle of it.
“The curtain rises,” he says quietly to himself.
“He said blackmail?”
“Doing what? Catching enemies of the country? Little bit of extra excitement on the side?”
If she wasn’t dead, Sherlock would kiss her.
He took his coat and hat and stood to leave.
“Irene, get out. It’s my ---“
“Everyone has to get married,” Sherlock hurries to say. A giant lie, he knows, but maybe it’s a way to dodge the kind of love that comes with a broken heart. Both of their parents seem happy together, so maybe getting married has helped.
He has only taken a few steps, when he hears stomping behind him and turning around sees Sally storm off towards the entrance hall’s extremely bushy ficus that is shaking slightly.
Then he looks up and nods once.
Victor grins.
Sherlock is like a sack of potatoes lying on his stomach but John succeeds in manoeuvring him on his back, opening his trousers and shirt and dragging everything off. He manhandles Sherlock back on his stomach so he can get to the edge of the duvet and drape it over the shivering form.
He turns to Lestrade.
John finally lifts his head and looks at him for the first time in a week.
“Away from you!” John yells from the bottom of the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, we don’t.”
She is back to her muttering, blabbering, stammering, and Sherlock wants to touch her, for the first time since Christmas he remembers what Molly truly is.
“I wonder if I should come by one day to install some kind of sound system? Oh, the things I might hear.”
She stared at the jar of goose fat.
Doesn’t make it any easier when the topic moves on from them and Moriarty’s plan to a direction Sherlock does not want it to go.
They stay quiet for a long time, watching Harriet sitting in the middle of the quadrangle and pick up sticks and stones to build something by her feet.
“Hmm?”
“Would you like me to try?”
“So far,” she says and sips her tea.
“Elegant,” Sherlock whispers.
John was scared stiff at the pool, being so close to death again after he had thought he’d be safe. But still his first instinct was to protect Sherlock, to jump on Moriarty’s neck, ready to be blown up. Screaming for Sherlock to leave him and run away.
“First? You mean he’s going to give you five puzzles in total? Then what?”
“Jesus Christ!” he gasps.
“John!” screamed Sherlock.
This is why Sherlock has been so excited about his theory.
It’s not an interesting situation, they’re not even at a crime scene or in the middle of a case. They’ve just happened to come home at the same time, John carrying heavy grocery bags, clearly annoyed with the heat of the summer that makes his shirt stick to his skin and the weight of the bags which make his arms ache.
Sherlock is up on his knees and elbows again, swaying gently and pleading no, no, no, no into the pillow.
“Whatever it is, let me help. If it’s worse than usual, at least don’t drive me away. We can go to Mycroft. We ---“
detectives. Brainy is the new sexy,” she says, drawing another smile from John, and Sherlock is suddenly struck by a very uncomfortable image of where that kind of smile might lead with her.
Point it at him, he orders himself.
. His stomach sinks, but he tries to stare the men down and they walk away hurriedly when they realise they have been discovered.
He started to cry.
interview several men ‘still on the army payroll’, but when they heard who they would have to work with, they all… scattered to the winds, so to say. It was like being hung up on several times, without any telephones included.”
Later, John finds his note under the sofa, swiped there by the wind from the open window.
His skin was warm and soft to the touch as he took Sherlock’s hand in his. The nails were smooth and evenly cut, not a hint of dirt under them.
He had been at Bletchley when he had heard.
Like her four-wheeled namesake, the nurse was fast-paced and efficient, able to do the job of several of her colleagues simultaneously while maintaining the cool and calm reserved only for the very few fortunate these days and thus for none of the inhabitants of the St Bartholomew’s hospital. Loved by everyone, Nurse Ford was the bringer of joyful news, explorer of new possibilities and the coolest hand on the feverish forehead of a patient. Some said that when the war would finally end, she would be the one to broadcast it around and one or two said that if she had been in charge, she would have single-handedly ended the bloody thing before it even had the chance to start.
Still, John is in desperate need of a toothbrush and a shower. His tongue tastes like cat pee, and when he rubs his head he grimaces at the icky feeling of unwashed hair.
But with each passing day the war seemed to move further away from his thoughts. Each day he took another step towards the living and forgot the dead, remembered where he was and what he was supposed to do. Little by little, he adapted Sherlock’s neutral tone towards everything but their assignment and saw everything else as something he could not affect. Now, he let others bury the dead and allowed himself to forget.
“Ow,” said John.
“What?” John asks gently.
He jumps on the desk and crouches so that he is staring into Sherlock’s face.
“Right, so what do you want to do?”
He looked at his watch.
Sherlock’s world goes into somersaults.
He looked up. A piece of translucent onion was stuck between her front teeth, hanging in the air like a fibre of flesh as she flapped her mouth open and shut.
The man stands a fair distance away, weight on his right leg, hands in his pockets, clearly enjoying every moment.
He steers Sherlock towards the doorway despite Anderson’s angry muttering.
“Meaning…” Sherlock prompts.
“Did you like it, the little glimpse I’ve given you of what I’ve got going on in the big bad world? It’s my specialty. Crime. Like yours is fighting against it, the brave little hero that you are.”
“And still you came.”
Only now Sherlock seems to notice the crowd around him, everyone still staring, some whispering to each other, and he tears himself away from Victors grasp and stumbles away. Victor calls his name desperately and runs after him.
“Don’t be troublesome, John. I’m sick and cold and will never get better if you won’t help.”
“I won’t catch my death if I continue to stand out here, though.”
No one there to see it but Sherlock.
“I promise you,” says John and drapes a blanket over Sherlock’s chilly toes, “that I will both love you
“I am not ill,” he says to them.
He reads of people who suffer from amnesia that wipes their memory clean every 10 seconds. How he would love that, not to be able to remember anything new, not to be able to remember people you hate, people who hate you.
John hums acknowledgingly, smile tickling at the edges of his mouth as he recalls the occasion.
John blinks like he has forgotten Sherlock is there.
“Anything, Sherlock. You know that.”
“Oh, I’m sorry! I’m ---“
This is how he wants to remember John. Taking care of their lives, the parts that actually make them meaningful, the things that make 221B a home instead of headquarters or storage for all of Sherlock's research material, thus making their lives a unity. He could empty the house of everything else but John and still have all the answers there.
He knows he has passed out because when he comes to, there are already sirens and flashing lights outside his window and Mrs Hudson is crying on her knees next to him. He reaches a hand out to pat her knee and her crying only amplifies when she realises Sherlock is still alive.
“We’re losing him!”
. Not Baker Street. He is taking John home to try his best to make him forget Soo Lin’s body and all the other ones her death has brought back into his mind.
“Really, Sherlock? I’m actually having this conversation with you? You’re actually such a child that you have to have a fight over a
He sounds so enthusiastic Sherlock is afraid to continue.
Sherlock pushes one of the shoes towards John.
“Not so sure about you,” she says ponderingly to Sherlock.
“Sherlock, answer me.”
The crash has been looming over him for a long time. It has hovered at the back of his mind ever since he saw John at the graveyard, and he finally breaks down completely during his second year away. Stuck in Dubrovnik for three months, the smell of the tea filling the hotel room he can’t leave making him go crazy with home sickness, he phones Mycroft and breathes his brother’s name to the phone.
“I should get some,” Sherlock continued and turned around.
He doesn’t look up, not when his phone goes off, when John informs him offhandedly about it, when it goes off again, nor when John comes to stand next to him, the phone in his extended hand. Only John’s breathless (
He was hurt, yes. But everything else John got wrong. He never thought John was Moriarty, for a split second he didn’t even recognise John in the damn coat, his face so filled with fear he looked like a different person. He went for Sherlock’s eyes and saw disappointment there.
After a night on the sofa clearly meant for just one but now occupied by a grown man with another very heavy one sleeping on top of him, no one is in the best of forms. Especially not an ex-soldier who trashes in his sleep and has a bad shoulder and a psychosomatic leg.
A tap on the window made him jump up. In the glow of the street lights coming from outside he could see the form of a man looking inside, pale face, blond hair, a wide smile transforming into a whisper of his name.
So when John walks in to the Queen’s fancy sitting room, all gold and expensive furniture, he first sees Sherlock sitting on the sofa facing the window, still in the sheet, tapping the floor with his toes in annoyance. John only shrugs at him, a silent question of ‘Why are we here?’ and when Sherlock does not have the answer, he sits down quietly on the edge of the sofa.
He is already in his bedroom when John trots up the stairs.
They were boring straight into him, red and hot like fire.
“His practice round,” Donovan tells him while Sherlock discusses the location of the bombings with Lestrade in front of a huge map of London stabbed hesitantly on the sitting room wall with pins and Sherlock’s knife. Mrs Hudson walks in, tuts at the misuse of her walls and lowers a tray of tea on the desk.
She has never used it. It’s always just the smell of shampoo and lilac moisturizer on her.
“Let me just get this part so I don’t drop everywhere. Then you can have the bowl and water.”
Sherlock looks like an emotionally crushed fish again.
“Could you,” Sherlock whispers, ”please pretend that didn’t just happen?”
“John. My throat hurts.”
John doesn’t mind ill-fitting clothes that reveal his scar in front of Sherlock. He doesn’t mind casual touches or even a tickle fight with him sitting astride on Sherlock’s back. He only gets embarrassed when there is someone else in the room.
“How is it that you still remember ‘Round and round the garden’ but have deleted the paramount talent of Clarence Nash?”
Mycroft watches John. He follows him around the city in his cars, steps out sometimes to try and convince John to let him give him a left. In the pouring rain, Mycroft holds the majority of the umbrella over John, and for the first time John does not reward his presence with a rude gesture, but neither does he follow Mycroft into the car.
At the edge of sleep, he lay still, quietly whispering the name. It was beautiful, comforting, unlike his own name which, like his body, was weird and unfitting.
But before this comes the laboratory, locking John in with an imaginary hound and scaring him to death.
John smiles as well, but there’s no warmth in it.
“I’ll radio Mycroft and ask for more.”
“I sit there the most. Ergo, it’s my spot.”
“Go on then,” he says. “Do your thing. Deduce what happened,” and continues to whistle.
“What, am I that dashing?” John smirks.
Despite the weather having been less than tolerable for the past weeks, John had gone out and disappeared into the forest every day while Sherlock stayed inside, waiting for the sun to come out. That morning the weather had finally turned, and after John had been out of sight, Sherlock had thrown his equipment aside and sat down on a tree stump near the door.
John stood behind him, clearly more at ease now that they had arrived, feet firmly set apart to support himself on the rocky yard.
He has no idea what to say, but John seems comfortable in the silence, gazing out of the window at London passing by, wet with rain and gleaming. Sherlock stares at him and still cannot believe this man is his date, that he has
When he comes back to bed, Sherlock pretends to be asleep though he knows it will only make John feel worse.
There was an explosion of scar tissue covering the back of his shoulder, exposed for anyone to see.
John opens his eyes and looks at him, mouth slightly open in a confused smile.
He knows it’s him. Has to be. He promised something big for his next appearance.
Sherlock himself is sitting in the chair, leaning his head against his hand, and he barely turns to look towards the door fast enough for Lestrade to interpret it as movement. He seems to be having difficulties focusing on the figure standing awkwardly behind John, who walks in briskly and kisses Sherlock’s cheek.
John turns back to his shoes, only to see the toes still wriggling next to them. Sherlock is like a cat on hot bricks on an equally hot tin roof, in desperate need of some kind of closure.
he is browsing whilst his human seat keeps on waving and wriggling under him.
He pulls Sherlock’s hair tighter and shakes him. At Sherlock’s moan, he loosens his grip but leans in even closer to whisper in his ear,
John looked at him, surprised.
Sherlock heard the respect in his voice and despised it instantly. It was not the sound of sincere politeness but a chore one must perform before their superiors, no matter how much one hated them in their heart. Perkins’ sudden long vowels and round tones made him shiver with their stinginess. He would have preferred the quick whip-like sentences he had thrown at him. At least they were a true reflection of the speaker.
Pulse on her wrist feels elevated, or is it his own pulse? Never measure it with your thumb, might get the wrong reading, feel your own rabbit pulse instead of
Especially when Sherlock lifts his feet up to rest them on the edge next to John’s head. John doesn’t quite know what do with his hands, so he places them on his stomach and closes his eyes.
Anderson, trying to look intimidating and determined, gulps at the tone and stammers,
John rolls his shoulders and ruffles his hair. The vertebrae in his neck stand out when he tilts his head from side to side. If he was facing the kitchen, Sherlock could see the place he likes the most, the little hollow at the bottom of John’s throat. It would show just now, when John stretches his shoulders, his clavicles pushing up. He has just the right shirt (rare, that) so that if he’d just turn round, Sherlock could see it.
“You just want to see if I’ll break. Believe me, you’ll fail. I’ve been kicked and beaten down so many times in my life I’m used to it. I don’t break easily.”
Sherlock feels the same.
“The Reichenbach hero.”
John looks up at him, eyes shiny. Sherlock wonders if nostalgia is infectious, because he also feels tears tickle at the corners of his eyes.
Sherlock presses his mouth against John’s, not quite a kiss anymore but a desperate attempt to keep John attached to him while he takes a hold of his arms and squeezes so that it hurts.
He clutches at the doorknob, knowing that the stupidest thing to do now is to barge back into the house. They can easily follow him there and corner him.
“Just this once?” Sherlock begs.
It’s been two and a half months.
Another red dot lands on Sherlock’s forehead and John freezes in horror.
The nose disappears.
John looks so strange and so familiar. Sherlock calculates every fraction of his body he can see, and peaks under the covers to look at the parts he can’t see. John’s legs are coiled tightly around his, his torso attached to Sherlock’s side, his other hand hidden somewhere under his body. He will be sore when he wakes up, and not just from sleeping on his arm.
The ugly gold and black wallpaper. Their books on the shelves side by side.
“Yees,” Sherlock purrs.
Jim stays silent. Sherlock stares out of the window at the boys playing football on the quadrangle, the principal walking briskly towards them to tell them off.
John made a sort of sitting down pirouette, struggling so forcefully that instead of shaking Sherlock’s iron grip loose, he managed to tangle his feet between his legs.
“Just another cure for boredom for you, is it?”
“I’m not as good at deducing as you, but based on tonight I thought you perhaps wanted to be kissed?”
“Hmm?”
He stops a few metres away.
John was lying in a bed with breathing tubes in his nose. John was full of pain meds. John was in hospital. John was shot, and Sherlock was very, very angry.
His eyes meet those of the woman he met on Baker Street.
“He beat the boys up. Didn’t break anything, none of them even bled, but he scared them so thoroughly that even now when we see them at Christmas they treat him like a king. You should see them grovel. I don’t think it hurts that he is now the British government and able to audit one’s company whenever he feels like it and fake one’s tax records convincingly if he wants to, but I also believe strongly that the image of an 11-year-old screaming in Japanese lives on.”
He disappeared to the room on their left from where John could hear glasses clinking as they were dried and set on a rack.
and let my work slip. He is just an errand boy.”
“I don’t understand though,” John says turning to him, “why do this at all? What does he have to gain from this?”
Mrs Holmes let out a laugh and patted Mr Trevor on the arm.
But it’s worse. He goes blind with panic every time his head goes under water, he hears Moriarty’s sing-song voice constantly in his head, he feels like someone will grasp his foot and drag him to the bottom if he doesn’t stop kicking.
), sunlight pouring in through a large window, lighting up the Persian rug his bare feet are resting on.
But John Watson looks at his flatmate with evident worry as well as slight anger in his eyes.
“What?”
“No, I know.”
Imagining kissing John under the mistletoe.
“I’m never bored when I’m with you,” Sherlock breathes.
He is breathless from running, and the way he says it makes it sound like a general statement, applied to every aspect of his life instead of just this one where he needs John to come with him to catch a murderer.
Sherlock thinks for a moment.
“Sorry, boys, but we’re in the middle of a murder investigation here and I know you are an invaluable part of it, but we have a consultant here who needs some peace and quiet to solve this one. Now, it’s really hot in here and the stiff is really starting to stink up the place. So if you could just keep it down for, like, 5 minutes?”
“And now they’ve turned up,” Sherlock whispers to himself and strokes the trainers gently.
Sherlock looks down at his feet.
“You never call them Krauts,” Sherlock said. “You only speak of them as ‘the Germans’ or ‘soldiers’. You never even say ‘enemy’.”
“What?”
But right now, he has much more carnal love confessions in mind.
“Please.”
“Aren’t ordinary people adorable? Well, you should know, you have John.”
He knows this, from somewhere.
Sherlock huffed angrily.
Perkins, whose grim countenance has glued itself over John’s retinas from the several mugshots he has seen of the man when he has been going through the files Sherlock has left on the kitchen table. Larceny, arson, assault, armed robbery are just a few of the accomplishments on the long list of reasons the man has spent years altogether in jail and of which arson has apparently been his absolute favourite. He has burnt down more buildings and more people than several wildfires have and he knows bombs better than the whole bomb squad of the New Scotland Yard.
He felt slightly better with the gun safely back in the holster. He took another sip from his cup, the coffee still hot without any milk in it to cool it down.
“Chinese,” Sherlock breathes immediately, mouth as close to John’s as he can.
He should have remembered how ordinary she was.
John looks defeated.
“There’s the car.”
It makes Sherlock happy, to know that John is just as affected by him as he is by John.
Sherlock presses his forehead against the cool glass. He can see Mycroft clutch the stack of papers that require his signature, look at John who shakes his head vigorously.
Or perhaps he enjoys the power over someone so small, struggling to pay for the lives of his children, ready to die at any moment.
There is a courier from the butcher’s waiting for them, Mrs Hudson staring in horror at the bags of butchered pig she is supposed to accept into her house. She throws her hands in the air and stomps back in, followed by profusely apologising John, while Sherlock stays to sign the delivery and watch over as the men carry what is left of the dead pig into their kitchen. Sherlock inspects the parcels with interest. The butcher has packed everything neatly in their own parcels, the innards and meat carefully labelled.
He tries again.
“Evidence that the stupidity of the forensics team never ceases to amaze me. The hair most definitely came from Anderson’s head. He is the only one still idiotic enough to parade around without his headgear.”
“No. Like… What our mums and dads have.”
for him, because Sherlock Holmes is not
At John’s confused look he gestured at the folder, encouraging him to open it.
With every shake of his head, the mirth drips away from him until his teeth look sharper and his eyes darker as he hisses,
“Huh?”
Between him and the uniformed sergeant driving the car (
Is that really him? The horrible person who insults those he loves to get attention or because he doesn’t know any better.
“It’s all for your own good,” replies John, turning the page of the morning’s
He turns around one more time.
But his coat was gone.
He is still as calm and collected as before, but Sherlock can see the tremor in the hand of his reflection. He clenches the handle of his umbrella tighter but it doesn’t help.
He stares at John, sipping his tea, watching the morning news, scratching his hair, sensing the stare, looking at Sherlock, raising an eyebrow. In the morning light, dust dancing round and the shadows slipping from the corners to fill the dusky dips and hollows on John’s body and make them even darker. Most of them seem to gather on the one at the bottom of his throat, and Sherlock can’t tear his eyes away from it.
Sherlock shakes his head, shows the license plate to Lestrade who jumps up to make a phone call to check if the car has been reported.
People further away from the scene standing by the walls glanced at one another. All of their expressions said the same. They had never seen Mr Holmes so excited over an attack on their troops before. No matter how cold your blood was, it still seemed to burn hot when it was a question of your own kin.
Standing up, John drained his mug.
The pub is full of smoke and glasses clinking against table tops. There is already a crowd, even though it’s still early evening. Jim has lured him into playing a game of chess on the pretence that besides beer, no one would be there.
“John, I seriously just woke up feeling too hot and took my pyjamas off. No one was in my room other than myself, I didn’t
It is time to perfect the plan. Every detail must be worked out, nothing can go wrong with this. He needs his homeless network, lots of fake blood, and Mycroft.
Before he has the chance to leave, he is picked up by one of Mycroft’s dark vehicles.
“Grow up!”
The looks on Molly and Lestrade are priceless.
John came home and yelled again, but not for long and not very loud. Sherlock’s eyebrows grew back and he returned to Bart’s, only to find out that Molly (blushing and stammering) had been ordered (by John) to cut him off from anything more dangerous than a toenail for a month.
! I have never struggled so much, because I wanted to make it so good and confrontation scenes are always so bloody difficult.
“Did you tell anyone? Where you were going.”
He remembers the other laughs, the giggles, the chuckles, the snorts, the funny hiccoughing sound after John has been laughing for hours and his eyes are watering and he can barely breathe.
“I have been reliably informed I don’t have one," he tries anyway.
“Got trapped in.”
The only thing John couldn’t figure out was how Sherlock felt about him.
By late afternoon, Sherlock’s voice has gone hoarse and every drop of energy has drained out of him. He is lying on the bed with his arm slung over the edge.
“Why not? Why can’t I?” Sherlock screams back.
Running, metal bolt sliding free, and then Lestrade was wrenching the crate open, worry edging his face until he saw that neither of them were dead or even bleeding.
Sherlock’s eyes stay closed even after John pulls back, his head feeling like he will need extra oxygen to start the regular flow of blood again.
A hand grasps his chin and a voice says,
Thankfully the doorbell rings before things can get really ugly and he pounds to his room to change into a suit while John lets their visitor in. When he returns, there is a young man waiting in John’s chair, looking timid and dead tired, saying,
do. Sherlock tries John’s boundaries but he also likes to test him in other ways, teach him how to think like him. It is necessary for the work. All it takes is an unfinished sentence, the right question hanging in the air or an encouraging nod or praise. John loves it, the danger, the running, the deductions, but he doesn’t seem to think of them as a real job. Not one that gets you food on the table, at least.
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to his brother’s. He bit down on his cigarette, almost cutting it in half with his incisors, the ashes dropping on the creamy carpet without either of the men stopping them.
“Don’t mess it up for him. It’s important he knows he is safe. So no histrionics, no yelling, crying or anything. Be neutral, be calm, be yourself.”
“You wanna take care of me sexually right now?”
Towel safely somewhere in the general vicinity of the door, John tries to remove Sherlock’s feet from his person, dealing first with the one giving him incontinence. He grasps Sherlock’s ankle lightly to drag it out of his pants.
“Ah, don’t think I’m not familiar with your fancy with big words. I heard you on the courtyard yesterday. Gave our dorm supervisor hell of a time outing him with his drinking habits.”
“Two days ago. You must understand, that though the situation is dire, certain factors,” here he turned to give his brother such an ugly stare that John could have sworn the man flinched slightly under it, “slowed us down and we were not able to move as swiftly as we would have liked. But now that you are here, we can act. You will leave for your mission tonight, as soon as the necessary equipment have been ensured.”
“Why are you wearing a toga?”
It’s like they are children again. Mycroft using the exact same phrasing as he did when Sherlock was 13 and came home with a detention slip saying he had glued several of his classmates into their chairs.
No more quiet mornings after that.
He is clearly uncomfortable in his jumper and zips up his jacket to hide it. When Sherlock touches his hand to get his attention, John blushes crimson.
Sherlock scoffs.
“Opening the window, it’s really hot in here.”
He gathers her into an embrace, his open coat covering her like a blanket, and breathes in the scent that is distinctly Molly, with or without perfumes it’s always been Molly, always there for him, always ready to help, and he has only had horrible things to say to her in return.
“You died.”
Sherlock turns around instinctively, looking behind himself as if he doesn’t know better.
“Uncle Sherlock?” another voice whispers next.
Only the few times when he let it slip. At the pool. At Irene’s with John at gunpoint. On the roof.
The paramedics throw a blanket over his shoulders, he sneers at them and snorts at Lestrade’s sigh of how they have nothing to go on. There’s always something.
Entranced, Sherlock stared at the spot where the fingers had been, his mother’s droning voice buried under the susurrus of his own thoughts, hopes of the hand resting on his with that same lingering touch.
“Go to bed,” he instructs Sherlock. “Be with your mother. You barely see her anyways and you promised her to be on your best behaviour. It’s only for another day, anyway.”
“Morning,” he heard John, his voice very far away.
So they’re going to an abandoned animal cemetery where they used to burn deceased cats and dogs.
John doesn’t say anything. Sherlock moves his gaze away from his hands, only as far as John’s shoes to see he is standing over the threshold, leaning against the door frame.
“It rained all the time, though. I don’t think we had one clear day the whole time we were there.”
But John is calm and far from tears. He stares into Sherlock’s eyes, roots himself in them, making sure Sherlock knows he is not going to leave.
Sherlock is nineteen and ready to burst out of his skin. John is almost sixteen, so close to adulthood that Sherlock can taste it. He has long since outgrown the idiotic idea that marriage somehow protects love. He knows marriage doesn’t even require love, but it doesn’t mean he has stopped wanting to marry John.
“I know, it’s not fun at all. I’m sorry.”
Lestrade, who has followed his gaze go from the people occupying the familiar place to the door now shut to him perhaps forever, slows down their pace to draw John’s attention to him.
He turns back to the corpse, tries to wave away the flies and lowers his face towards the rotting foot. A slight breeze makes the newspapers piled near flutter and the noise grows. He turns around angrily to tell Anderson off, but it’s not him, it’s the blond man.
“How do you know?”
“Are you going to punch me now?” he asks John’s shoes.
“Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out ---“ John starts just when Sherlock says he already moved in.
Moriarty is laughing, cheering at John who turns his head awaydisgusted when he looks at him over his shoulder.
He thinks of the words now more than ever before. They appear like a neon sign over John after he almost takes a bullet in the head, or pop up in a puff of white smoke in good old Arial, the font John uses on his blog and which Sherlock detests (“It’s like you are writing the bloody thing for people with visual impairment!”), or are stamped repeatedly on Sherlock’s brain and heart when he looks at John in situations like this, performing regular, everyday tasks that keep their household together and make John look so beautiful and Sherlock feel so safe he feels like he will need a tank of extra oxygen.
God, that smile breaks his heart.
“No.”
Especially not those of long ago.
John shrugged and turned his eyes back to the sea.
He knows he is begging for nothing. John will be traumatized. He will leave. There is no way in hell he will stay now that Sherlock has failed him this badly.
“How are you, John?” he asks.
Victor really knew how to make someone’s birthday.
“Did you run out of notebooks?” Jim asks him quietly.
“Of course it is,” Victor says. “I’ve been wanting to call you for so long ---“
Sherlock managed to drink another mouthful from his mug.
So John grasps a thick chunk of the hair and cuts. It comes off and falls on the floor in a clump. Sherlock sighs heavily in relief. John continues his shearing until there’s only a few inches of uneven hair left on Sherlock’s head, then takes the electric razor he uses to shave and trims what is left. Big chunks of hair and mess of blood and skin stick to the blades and make the shaving difficult. Finally he steps back and lets his hands fall to his sides.
“John, I need data. Does this warrant a long-term commitment? Our relationship. I have tried to analyse it but it’s futile to deduce without justifiable data.”
“Are we friends? Victor.”
The next morning in the bathroom, Sherlock inspects the ugly pink pill between his fingers. He listens to John clink away with the dishes, thinks about how he hasn’t touched his bare skin in months, how he has almost forgotten how he tastes.
Then she shakes herself as if to rid herself from a feeling that has followed her from the other room, is suddenly back at the bed and climbing on it to lean over Sherlock.
He stops touching John, stops looking at him, hunting for exposed skin, but sulks on the sofa in his dressing gown and waits for a case. When one comes, Sherlock jumps up and drags John with him from wherever he happens to be at the time. He doesn’t even pay much attention to his actions until he notices that he hasn’t seen the date shoes in weeks and that they have been eating take away for five days now.
“As long as I keep all of them out of your hair, I consider my job done.”
John, huffing and puffing his frustration at Sherlock not letting him in before, walks briskly through the door and crouches over the body.
John followed him in with another box of cans in his arms, Sherlock with his own trunk of clothes.
“Come on, now. I’ll help you up.”
Anderson crowds in front of him and stares him down.
Hismeagre attempts at making John praise him or at least comfort him with something like “There will be a case soon” receive no response and he is left alone, banging at the pillow angrily when John storms out of the flat, almost knocking down Mrs Hudson who comes in with the shopping bags and asks if they had a domestic.
“Bit not good, yeah,” he replies.
“It’ll take some time for the news to reach Lestrade and even longer for all the paperwork to be sorted out,” Sherlock said, lying supinely on the only cot in the cell.
A wave of disgust flashes over John’s face and he turns his head away. Sherlock wants to grab him, shake him and scream,
But it does start. Someone calls Moriarty just as Sherlock is ready to shoot the vest and die together with John on their own terms. Someone calls and Moriarty allows them to leave with an apology and a pondering “Wrong day to die.”
Press record.
He never wears white. All his trousers are black. Except his pyjama pants, the ones John bought for him after he had worn through the last pair.
He was once again weighing two different items in his hands, steadily not looking at the rest of the things on the shelf marked simply as
John is looking peaky, so Sherlock makes a detour on their way back to Baker Street and stops at a café he favours for their full English.
Again.
Once or twice John gets enough of Sherlock’s cuddling, but no matter how stern he tries to be, he is never actually angry or would want Sherlock to stop. It is only very inconvenient when several feet of consulting detective suddenly jump into John’s lap, just when he is about to dive into his morning cup of tea.
Sherlock’s hand clenches the windowsill but Mycroft merely goes on.
After a decade of marriage they had four children and were about to embark on their first tour through Europe since 1927 in order to retrace the steps they had taken ten years earlier. The children, each of whom had inherited their father’s aquiline nose, were ecstatic about the future trip and spent the Christmas dinner running around the house telling everyone they met about it.
The next morning they drive back to the inn to get their luggage and eat a hearty breakfast the innkeepers insist they have, the least they can do after what happened on the moor. Sherlock goes in to get them tea, which John takes. Which he almost drinks.
John holds up two fingers in a rude gesture without turning and gets up on the countertop. He grabs the nuts just in time to lose his balance and fall down on the floor on his back, accompanied by an undignified
Sherlock beeps.
Staring at John’s shoulder, Sherlock realises John never actually told him how he got shot. It is wonderful, that something so horrible brought John to him. Dipping his nose into the notch between John’s clavicles (John sighs, guttural and deep) he goes through all the good things he can add to his list by saying them out loud into John’s skin. Staring into his eyes (John chuckles softly, slightly uncomfortable, but flattered by the attention), finally able to categorise the exact blue of them, he takes a pen and writes it down in big, bold letters.
Jim laughs as well.
“Hallo, Perkins. Met Holmes, have you?”
Then he hears John say slowly,
He had laughed so loud and long he had to lean against the doorframe for support.
“Is it the medication?”
,” he hissed.
Behind him, John had dropped something, cursing quietly.
He is still deep crimson when he is standing outside the building, inspecting the crowd of policemen between Lestrade’s waving arms, looking at John’s easy smile and wrinkles around his eyes as he throws his head back and laughs.
“Toes.”
John does not look bored, however.
“Still the old Sherlock,” Jim chuckles and smacks him on the back.
“More like ripped,” Sherlock muttered, his hand involuntarily clenching John’s hard.
When the bathroom door opens releasing a wave of steam and John, red-faced, clean-shaven and huffing out a satisfied breath of air, Sherlock is securely back at the kitchen table, eyes glued to the microscope. With enormous amount of willpower, he manages not to glance up as John walks past him, brushing against him accidentally as he rubs his hair dry, blinded momentarily by the towel thrown over his head.
“You’re drunk,” John informs him.
They were such a mystery to one another, both going the wrong way to try and interpret the other. Irene took the only approach she knew, tried to arise Sherlock’s sexual desires, receiving confused data that made her test her powers anew with John.
Now both John and Doctor Albertson had their brows furrowed. Doctor Albertson’s bushy eyebrows were stitched together so tightly he looked like a very concerned walrus. In any other situation, John would have found it very funny.
John actually turns round to check the disbelieving faces of the yarders standing behind him.
“The case. The bombs. How are you dealing with them? You must be familiar with them. Can’t have avoided them in Afghanistan.”
In his club room, Mycroft is sitting in his chair with a glass of whiskey the colour of pure amber,
Sherlock cries.
“So that’s him? John, whatever they're having you do, I think it’s best you know something about him. You are not one for rumours, but the stuff I heard about him was pretty drastic. Drugs, for one. That one was pretty obvious. He didn’t even try and hide it in the end. But the other stuff I heard…”
Sherlock moves in front of him and kneels down. John’s expression grows worried and his hands go to hover over Sherlock’s knees.
– and you wanted me to stick my face into it!”
“In your dreams,” John answers with a sigh.
The alligator split open like a pillow, and John and Sherlock were left standing over pieces of crocodile, stuffing and the shiny pearl necklace which Sherlock was on his way of taking to the Met when he ran into a constable, dropped the parcel with the pearls in it and was then arrested by the over-eager constable who - like everyone else in the force - recognised the pearls the moment he saw them.
“You’re in this now, Sherlock!” Jim bellows behind him. “You’re in!”
“Humdrum desk job for a mundane personality.”
He deposits John into the café at Bart’s to nurse a cup of tea while he catches Molly by the sleeve and asks (
He is absorbed in the game at this point, too giddy to see anything else, too happy that he is doing experiments again, but somewhere at the back of his head he feels ill, hates himself for doing this to John. He has to remind himself there is no one else. He can’t test the sugar on Henry, he’s already seen the hound, has probably been exposed to the sugar for years. And this would break him, darkened room, nowhere to hide from your childhood nightmare.
Sneaking into the bar, hiding his phone discreetly between his palms, he takes a quick photo of her before dashing out to type a text to John. He knows how to play him. Give him a pretty tail to chase and he’ll forget all the hurt in the world, happy to show off his talent in his natural habitat.
He has no time to try and ask her anything before Jim is back.
Sherlock looked behind himself to see the boy smiling widely, pointing at their retrieving backs and his mother listening with an expression of surprise and love parents always give their children when they are excited about something.
“You mean like pretend?”
“He was big for his age and he had been itching to put his karate lessons to use.”
“You still don’t say much,” Irene notes, leaning against the bench. “Drugs seem to be treating you well though. You look really good.”
“Jim!” Sherlock screams. “Let her go!”
“I’m not taking you with me. The bathtub is small as it is. It will not fit two grown men.”
His head aches and he feels like he will throw up.
Natalie Georges had married a Hungarian photographer she had met when she had been only eighteen and travelling through Europe documenting the effects of the war. In Budapest, the place she herself referred to as The City of Love – Paris having never been too kind to her – she had been introduced to György Kovács by a mutual friend who had been her pen pal for years and his best friend since birth. Together they had planned to continue to travel through Europe, combine their talents of writing and photography and perhaps one day publish their journeys. He had followed her first to Zagreb and from there to Ljubljana, Graz and finally to Vienna where they had been abruptly stopped by news of his mother’s sudden passing. He had returned home to Szolnok which he had fled under the occupation, leaving behind his elderly mother who had hoped that in the capital he would have a greater chance for happiness.
But tears are supposed to be bad.
“But I hate
? Unable to hurt even those who hurt you?”
“Aren’t you always?” Sherlock pulls out a pair of gloves and blows in them before snapping them on.
He could recognise that shade of blue no matter how far he was, no matter how dark it got.
Then there is shouting, fully on John’s part, and lying on Sherlock’s, a door banging closed on John’s heels. A silence for a microsecond. Funny how short amount of time it takes to have your heart broken.
He felt horrible.
“I’ve inhaled so much water my
Sherlock returned to the front room, sliding his finger over one of the tables.
And yet, two months later, John Watson is still there.
Sherlock untangled his legs and John let go of his arms. They sat down on the floor, leaning against the cot. John really wanted to throw the sewage jacket down the cell lav, but drained from all energy he just sat very still, the ache in his head like a steady drumroll.
“I haven’t agreed to anything yet!”
Sherlock hated the feeling of having invisible eyes on him. He had felt it last night, lying awake in his bed. As if hundreds upon hundreds of people had lined up under his window to peek in.
“Are we still here?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around his legs and buried his forehead against his knees.
This one knows what he's doing and he is definitely not doing it alone.
“Either wear it, or freeze your ears off,” Watson said in the dark.
Without another word, Irene turns around and walks out of the door. On the landing, she glances back over her shoulder, suddenly looking very sad. The door closes behind her just when John emerges from the bedroom, dressing gown on, ruffling his hair.
John wanted him to go out with him. To walk in the woods, he said, to get to know the surroundings.
Pulling sheets is important in a study of the person you are living with. It tells your compatibility with the said person, shows straight out whether you fit together or not. If you fold the sheets automatically the same way working with the other person like a clockwork, your cohabitation will be long and happy.
The air freezes round him, as does everyone in the room. John looks at him like he doesn’t understand the language Sherlock is speaking.
He took a tentative step to the right, then back to the left.
It only takes about quarter of an hour after Sherlock has been left alone with his brother that they hear the front door open.Then John’s footsteps on the stairs. John’s voice on the landing, calling for him, asking if he’s all right.
“I don’t mean to break you, Sherlock,” Doctor Mortimer assures him.
“Now,” John rests his arm on Sherlock’s shoulder, “you say you believe me. That you trust me. But the part that you don’t know, is if I want to marry you.”
Judging by the way John turned back to his mug, Sherlock had chosen his question poorly.
But Lestrade keeps the case to himself and Sherlock gets another one, a stupider one, a very minor one that only takes a few hours at Bart’s to solve but gives him the satisfaction of being able to put his frustration into beating a corpse and picturing Anderson’s face on it. Molly, never too shocked about what he does with the corpses she provides him with, is suddenly standing next to him and chirps,
With a flick of his wrist, he checkmates the king and stumps his cigarette into the ashtray.
“You’ve never seen a person been blown up, Sherlock. And I hope that you never have to.”
Frustrated, he slammed the notebook down, ready to tear off the pages.
“How do you know, if you haven’t tried?”
John waved his hand at him and jumped into the water. He came up a few moments later, hair wet and clinging to his skull. He splashed and shook his head, ringlets of water flying everywhere, before he dived back in and began to swim out to the open sea.
Behind him, Jim spits insults at him and by the door Harriet and Irene are still crying quietly. Sherlock doesn’t look at any of them but stares at John. He can feel them though, every fibre of their being is glued on his skin like an itch.
“When I was five and a half…”
He stood still staring at the light on the table until everything was dark, and he could see John pick up the lamp, go to the door and open it to call him in.
“We only got after him when we found the remains of the bomb at the last location. The parts that were not scorched beyond recognition gave out the edge of a sticker. We were able to trace the bomb or at least parts of it to an old army warehouse that had had a yard sale a few weeks back. No list of buyers but there was a security cam video which was really helpful at least with putting faces to the hundred or so people who visited that day.”
He should list John’s laughs, too.
Doctor Albertson, a man he admired and respected greatly, sat at his desk, the soft glow of the morning light halloing him from behind. In his softly lit office full of comfortable furniture and a blazing fire, the doctor looked even more of Santa Claus than he usually did surrounded by trainees and nurses in the dazzlingly white hospital rooms, conversing with the patients dressed in crispy white gowns and reclining against starched white linen beddings, all of which made his surroundings look like they were covered in everlasting snow.
Driving with his arm over the open window, Jim turns to look at Sherlock sitting next to him.
He remembers how awkward these are, beginnings. When he has to explain to a stranger what he does and how he does it. So he lays it out in front of John, bare bone and marrow and sits back to wait for the evident glare of mixed horror and embarrassment. He has said things about John he knows people usually think are very private and disturbing when brought up and several would punch him for stating them so casually.
“Who do you see?” Doctor Mortimer asks quietly.
Back at Baker Street, John tosses his jacket over his chair and strolls round the flat like before. He turns round to look at Sherlock, is just about to say something when another pillow hits him in the face. In seconds, he is armed with the fleur-de-lis monstrosity, ready to continue the war after the abrupt interruption.
“You did not.”
Sherlock almost bit the spoon in half.
At eleven, just when John is about ready to climb the stairs and go to bed, Sherlock emerges from his bedroom, dishevelled and dragging his dressing gown behind him. He stops in front of John, who pauses in turn and waits for what is to come.
With a small bow he said goodbye to them both and exited the room.
John’s face is as solemn as ever, his dummy long forgotten at the bottom of the backpack his mother carries around for him, his eyes lavender blue.
The baby is due on 12th of August and for the whole spring and the blazing hot summer Sherlock goes to Bart’s every day to make sure Molly drinks enough, rests enough and gets home safe.
John, dressed in green shorts today, is on his knees in front of the oak, clearly determined to catch something crawling on the roots pushing up from the ground. Sherlock tries not to care about the intrusion, sits down and opens his book. He barely has time to get through three paragraphs when he feels John sit down, offering his closed fist to him, which is clean and dry this time. Sherlock looks up. Even the dummy is gone. John is as solemn as the day before, pushing his fist towards him, clearly asking him to take whatever is in it. Defeated, Sherlock gives him his hand and something black and blue and incredibly small falls on his palm.
Sherlock stands in front of him, ready to jump out of his skin, doesn’t know for the life of him how to ask for advice from his brother who he hasn’t gone to for help in over twenty years.
He looked at John’s neck, sunburn pinking the skin, stretching from under the collar of his shirt to his hairline.
“I lived alone in university, they have no record of you there.”
“Yes, how nice to see you again,” Sherlock tells the stairs behind Anderson, already crossing the floor to start climbing.
He looks so much like their father did at his age. If the black and white photos are anything to go by. But Sherlock is sure Mycroft even has his hair.
Instead, John leans in, slowly to give Sherlock time to assess the situation, and once he knows he has his permission, places his lips on Sherlock’s.
A door clangs open behind him.
It pleads again and John snaps back to himself. The sounds Sherlock is making are so pitiful, edging on pure horror that John slides to him like on wheels, kneels and begins to scoop the bits of tissue and bone from Sherlock’s face. His hands turn crimson, but his trousers get most of the mess when he wipes his palms on them without looking. Two bright blue eyes stare out from Sherlock’s shock stricken face. John takes off his own jacket, strips his jumper and frantically wipes at the mess on Sherlock’s face, his own breathing still blessedly calm while Sherlock’s comes out in gasps. He is swaying his body from side to side, balancing on his knees and elbows until his legs give way and John catches him just before his jaw hits the concrete floor.
Sherlock stands at the bottom of them for a long while, clutching his hands into fists, counting the pairs of feet walking past, dozens and dozens of shoes, blue, black, brown and white. Skirts and trousers whish past, some on their way in to the temple of learning, the others towards the leisures of weekend and free time.
) walked by, the woman stopped to look at the canned goods on the opposite side of the narrow aisle while the boy staid still with his eyes glued to a comic magazine.
“I mean,” Sherlock continues hurriedly, “I’m more reliable now than a few years back. Hell, I’m more reliable now than I’ve been in my entire life! He has a steady income and he can help me with the cases. We get along well. Is there any reason for us not to do it?”
Suddenly the woman is at his elbow, grinning from ear to ear in a way she must think is seducing. She opens her mouth but before she can get a word out, Sherlock opens his.
The anger raised its head in John’s chest again and he clenched his fists against his knees.
“Excellent! How, when, why? There has to be a connection!”
To John’s surprise, his eyes stayed longer on his brother than they did on him.
Sherlock strokes the veins visible in John’s palm, the callouses and the softer skin of his fingers and looks up when John doesn’t answer.
“With that logic, every chav is gay,” John points out.
Every time Sally Donovan uses the term with slightly less of a sneer in her voice, something else lurking behind her words. Something deeper, sharper,
“Mrs Hudson did offer you your own cup,” John reminds him. “You wouldn’t have to scrunch your face into expressions it will stick into if you stopped stealing my tea.”
“I’ve always thought it was, taken that nothing I’ve ever found funny has been boring and everything I’ve found boring has not been funny,” Sherlock says, closing his notebook. “What do you think is the opposite of funny?”
Mycroft phones the next day. The only reason Sherlock goes is that now he owes him. A bit.
streaming from his top-of-the-range stereos.
Sherlock’s eyes were glued to the rifle as John pulled the sling over his head. He lowered the gun on the ground and took a step back, away from Sherlock, leaving the gun between them.
John looked at him, waiting.
Sherlock, having been at Bletchley Park long enough to know what had been happening and guessing the rest did not take the news too badly, but John was clearly more affected by them. For days he wandered aimlessly round the cottage, walked out, trotted in a circle round the garden or disappeared into the woods. To him the war was real in a way it had never been to Sherlock. The amount of dead people were mere numbers to him, but to John they were each a person with a soul and a beating heart. For him the thick rain covering the earth each day fell on both the living and the dead, the mist covered both the houses alive with families, lovers, friends and enemies as well as the gravestones of the people they all had buried.
His voice is deep, hardened by crying and the sorrow of having lost so much in one night. John tries to think of some movement, some indication that Sherlock has not lost him.
, the bomb going off, releasing a dead silence in its wake.
Then he hears John curse his leg and for some reason he comes back upstairs, thinking that at the very least this man cannot be as annoying as Anderson, and asks him to accompany him to the crime scene. He sees the pain in John but also the terrible longing for action, even violence lurking behind the sharp gaze and the protective military pose.
“The hours are better. I can actually go home when I’m supposed to and be with Sherlock. But I do miss it. The excitement. The familiarity of the unknown. Now the most action I get are runny noses and vomiting 3-year-olds.”
“So it’s no kisses and no loving until I’m better?”
“Real enough for you?” Jim hisses.
“You always say such horrible things,” Molly breathes. “Every time. Always, always.”
“Colleague,” John corrects quickly.
The belly laughter.
century, and a stuffed bat he thought John could use to snuggle. When the nurses saw this latest addition to the pile of debris covering John’s bedside table, they instigated a strict “No organic matter” policy. Sherlock huffed and puffed and pouted, but consented after the nurses pointed out that if this rule was not followed, it would be extended to bipedal Holmeses too.
Which is exactly what Mycroft tells him when they go to the morgue to see the body. Sherlock looks at Molly, wearing a comfy jumper and her hair down, and he feels his heart sink down to his stomach.
Sherlock visited every day, coming in as visiting hours began and only leaving when the security came to escort him out. Lestrade, Molly and Mrs Hudson also stopped by every day, but as reasonable people they coordinated their visits and never stayed for more than an hour.
“Oh, come on,” he says, looking at them both.
“What if you lose?”
John Watson is standing outside his door, the landlady Mrs Hudson hovering behind him, looking slightly timid.
Sherlock looks baffled.
“Pick a shape,” Sherlock breathes quietly over his mouth.
Victor does seem happy. He is laughing with a colleague when he stops at the café door and his smile only widens when he sees Sherlock sitting at his table. He walks over, nodding at the familiar girl cleaning one of the tables, mouths his order to her, bangs his books on the table and slumps in the chair opposite Sherlock’s sighing happily.
Sherlock goes to Mycroft. He has given up on pretending his brother will not help him when he truly needs help.
He could still see nothing, could hear nothing, but he felt that the man was there, waiting for him to move first.
Sherlock reads John’s blog when he doesn’t notice. Even though he leaves snarky comments to tell everyone he couldn’t care less, he actually spends a considerable amount of time poring over every word. He reads John’s notes on the Baskerville case especially hard, analysing every tone, every shift in his storytelling to find out how much others will gather from it about what happened in Dartmoor, how much John himself understood about it.
“The best,” John assures.
) exclamation makes him look up.
“What do you need?”
He is not supposed to look like that, John, his soldier. He is supposed to be brave and sturdy, hands steady in the most dangerous of situations, ready to patch up any physical or mental wound.
He felt like the man was making fun of him.
Ashtray back in one piece, though the crack still fairly visible, John places it on the window sill to dry. Then he goes to the kitchen and gets a garbage bag and a rag and holds them out for Sherlock.
For security’s sake, Mycroft has parked at the back. For security and so that Sherlock does not have to see the blood still splattered on the pavement by the front door.
John sipped his coffee.
John lay gasping and panting on his bed, covers twisted around his thighs, trapping him down.
“I have explained some things to my brother before your arrival, Doctor,” Mr Holmes said, somehow apologetic. “This attack, this very
“As I said, particular brand.”
As always, his mother had invited the better part of twenty aunts, uncles, cousins, and acquaintances to eat and enjoy a toddy or two she herself favoured during the cold December evenings. She also took the chance to impress her sisters and friends by the quantity and quality of her dinner table and succeeded every year.
John stopped and looked over his shoulder at him.
“Irene?” he asks.
He reaches for a piece of paper from the TV-stand and scribbles down a simple,
“You don’t have a case. That’s why the walls took a pounding. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you’re just trying to fume your brother up.”
Sherlock taps the bonnet where the blonde hairs are clearly visible in the blaring lights of the car.
Sherlock is achingly happy about this. He has understood the importance of regular, ordinary-guy-friendship between Lestrade and John and his heart almost bursts with joy when he sees John snort out beer through his nose when Lestrade says something funny Sherlock can’t read from his lips. John’s laugh, every variation of it, is still on the top of his list and this one is definitely the roaring belly laughter directed at crap telly, late night comedy and the raunchy jokes of his friends.
“She’s pregnant,” John informs him.
John looks surprised again.
Sherlock has the energy to send his brother two letters (
He thinks about the look on John’s face after he has deduced his whole life and laid it out in the open in front of him, making him only look slightly miffed about it. Then John actually turns up at the flat the next day, shakes his hand when offered and looks like he might consider living with Sherlock.
Mrs Holmes fluttered down the hall in her salmon pink dress, her perfume leaving a waft of roses in the cold Christmas night. She walked briskly to the door, slammed it shut to stop any more of the freezing air getting into the house and took her son’s face between her hands.
He turns to his bag to look for his wallet and takes his reading glasses from where they have been hanging on his shirt collar. He peers at the receipt on the plate, munching slowly on the complimentary biscuit.
Sometimes Sherlock spoke whole sentences in angry German, waving his arms and kicking with his feet. Sometimes he whispered frantically in several languages at once, all jumbled up in an unrecognisable heap. Never in English.
A light from a torch shone across the moss. John walked slowly towards them, keeping his gun aimed steadily at the soldier. He rolled the body over with his shoe, then kicked the rifle away just to be certain. Only when he saw the whiteness of the man's eyeballs, his gaping mouth and the small trickle of blood make its way steadily down his face he dared to turn away and look at Sherlock still lying trapped under him.
Sherlock eyes John pace back and forth between Detective Inspector Dimmock’s desk and the closest door, his hands clenching into fists so that his nails make indentions on his palms.
Sherlock almost crashes the car there and then, not because of the effect of the conclusion Doctor Frankland – like many others before him – has erroneously come to and the innuendo he has made, but because now he finally has a suspect.
Sherlock shook his head.
, so you created John Watson?”
As the driver takes care of the crowd, showing them something he pulls out of his pocket, speaking calmly the whole time, the two men hold Sherlock down and the woman, having been helped up by the third man who has given her a syringe from a medical bag, approaches Sherlock. She, too, is speaking calmly, giving orders to the men to steady his leg while assuring him that everything is going to be fine.
“But then I look at him, and remember that underneath all that is the man I fell in love with. And I realise he has been there the whole time and not hiding at all. I remember that he loves me, and that I love him. Then I feel angry at myself for forgetting that. But he always does something that only he can do, he looks at me in his own special way or says something others might think is insulting. And we are back to just being in love, together. And that’s enough.”
), looking for the necessary one.
“The security there is even tighter than at the Parliament, and the members are not allowed to talk within the walls of the club. They respect each other’s privacy and what is done for this country behind closed doors,” he had continued as he ushered John into a car and driven to an innocuous looking white-bricked building in the heart of London.
The green eyes were rimmed with red, staring wide and full of concern, suddenly showing more emotion than John had seen since the day he had finally asked Sherlock about Victor.
He flopped the shapeless hat on his head.
“Because your mind is where the problem is in the first place!”
Tears are already blurring his vision and he still closes his eyes as he spreads his arms and falls. He can’t handle it, the expression on John’s face when he dies. John screams his name, he knows he does even though he is too far to actually hear it.
Sherlock, however, looks bewildered.
“God with two faces. Why would you be giving me a clue?” Sherlock asks when the pink phone rings in the silence of Bart’s lab.
John drags the covers from under Sherlock and drapes them over him. He feels his forehead and Sherlock whimpers.
It is silent and dark in the library, close to closing time and only a few students still linger between the shelves leafing books by the tables.
John hands him a folder he has been hugging against his chest.
“What are you looking so smug about?” asks John, tongue appearing briefly between his lips.
“Gottle o’ gear,” he says mechanically. “Gottle o’ gear, gottle o’ gear.”
Mr Hartley chuckled softly.
He kisses John’s hands, thinks he can hear the thrumming of blood inside the veins, and he couldn’t be happier. He has been allowed to stay by John’s side long enough to see his hands change from smooth, steady surgeon’s hands to soft, veined ones of an old man whose eyes glimmer with happiness because of what
“What do you know about these?” he asks a second after and pushes a photo of a thing that looks like a mixture of an IED and something a child could have built in their cellar at his face.
Suddenly, Sherlock understands everything. Anger rises in him and he snarls,
“That is not fooling anyone. You’re in my spot. Get up.”
Seriously,
“Well, we can’t really do that with you around,” he whispers, glancing round the corner to see if John has appeared. The door to the bedroom is still closed.
“You do eat, don’t you?”
So he jumps into his clothes and follows the car to an abandoned factory, just in time to hear John tell Irene Adler to reveal she is alive.
He waits for a reaction but nothing comes. John is still staring at the wall, though he has been listening, Sherlock can see it from his neck. His eyes slide lower over his back, admiring the muscles and the posture, the evident power there.
“I wanted to help,” John says. “After I got the cat wrong I wanted to be of
“They say sex is a very good cure for cold,” he hears Sherlock mumble under the blanket.
Sherlock did not pay any attention to the news. Mycroft would have condemned his indifference, shocked that he took no interest in international affairs. Sherlock turned off the radio and lifted John carefully to his feet, whispering softly in his ear to help him to which John only snuffled quietly but took the necessary steps towards the bed before collapsing on it.
A derisive snort from John’s right followed the announcement, but he paid it no mind. But when offered a pen, his brother had signed the paper with a swift flick of his wrist before John even had had the change to reach for it.
The next morning, Sherlock has a sore throat, a raging fever and an incessant need to get out of bed. John stops his every attempt to get anywhere further away than to the toilet, which isn’t hard to accomplish considering how weak Sherlock is. However, John has to sit on his back for about fifteen minutes to tire him out when Sherlock is particularly eager to see why his phone (which John has hidden from him but forgotten to turn off) is ringing so.
“Plus the suggestive fact that he left his number under this dish.”
“We don’t own any.”
But it had been before, years ago in the early days of the war. John was an outcast now. The people dying on the front were unknown to him, though clearly just as dear.
Eyes cold and stormy, he lifts his head to stare John down, but is suddenly completely dumbfounded at the sight of him. He is still smiling softly, actually waiting for an answer. Not mocking, never mocking.
Mycroft turns, stares at his brother. He is silent for a few seconds as he takes in his appearance once more. Sherlock can see the light when it finally blinks on above his head, the only confirmation of his own feelings that he needs, and he is ready to throw up with the emotions dwelling over.
“John,” Doctor Mortimer says gently, “he had a mental breakdown at sixteen when his mother died. I don’t think he ever truly recovered from it.”
out of you.”
“You should be naked more often,” Sherlock kisses John’s collarbone.
He licks his lips (
“Your ridiculous monkeytoes should be helpful with this,” John grunts as chlorine water splashes in his face for the tenth time.
‘Funny’ is nowhere near what happens after Sherlock finds out the explosion was caused by a bomb, not a gas leak, fishes the copy of the Pink Lady's pink phone from the envelope, hears the five Greenwhich pips, sees the photo and takes John and Lestrade with him back to Baker Street to visit the C flat. It’s damp and dark and dusty, just like the last time he came there, but there’s something new in the middle of the musty sitting room.
Arms covered in fresh linen, John Watson was barely able to see the wave of brown curls bobbing towards him and so confirm that the voice calling after him in the deserted hall indeed belonged to Nurse Ford.
“Impress a girl,” she whispers, and the world slows down round him. The numbers and letters dance in front of him, forming a pattern, her mouth comes closer and closer, John lifts his eyes and something like worry, something like jealousy passes over his face, the world goes back to its regular speed again and lips land on his cheekbone.
“Maybe just try again tomorrow?” John suggests.
“Take it,” Sherlock says and thrusts the memory stick at Moriarty.
“Sofa, Sherlock, it was the sofa,” Mycroft singsongs, judgingly like big brother’s do when their baby brothers have behaved idiotically.
“Why not just build an actual surveillance tower and have an actual team work there?” the younger Holmes continued.
Before either of them could say anything, the hatch on the door suddenly opened and a policeman – clearly having heard the racket and come inspect – yelled at them,
John nods.
For the first time since he has met John, Mycroft looks taken aback. They stare at each other over the table, John stern, Mycroft calculating, posture stiff. Sherlock realises he is afraid. Afraid for him, afraid he has made a mistake, has miscalculated John.
Sherlock looks down at him. John’s hair is standing up, his cheeks are ruddy with sleep, he is dressed in the pyjamas Sherlock gave him last Christmas, the awful fudge brown ones he bought by accident.
Sherlock runs all the way from the hospital to the restaurant, barely stopping to catch his breath outside the door. He stumbles in, all eyes turning to him, staring, except the ones that have barely glanced up at his entrance and gone back to stare at the table. Ignoring the waiter, he walks to the table and stops to look at John, hands crossed on the table, face tight.
“They're called happy tears, Sherlock.”
“I’m Doctor Ella Mortimer, and you are in St Bartholomew’s Psychiatric Hospital.”
All done, John sprays Sherlock clean of the soap, drains the tub and lifts Sherlock up. He drapes the towel over Sherlock’s shoulders and has to dodge away when his arms start to wave, and he wails,
“You know Anderson?” Lestrade says desperately.
Then there are angry hissing words, an insult (slight one) from him, a confirmation on John’s part that yes, Sherlock Holmes can get it wrong, a promise that John will be fine once he has excreted the drug, and a joke that makes Sherlock smile and laugh, that makes him genuinely happy.
They have to start planning, always one step ahead, that’s their motto, and this time it is even more vital they know exactly where Moriarty is and what he will do. Lots of paperwork involved.
“You weren’t at the Chemistry department enrolment party though.”
The rare occasions Sherlock does sleep are limited to post case and post coital moments. John, however, falls asleep on the sofa, in the bed, in his chair, on the floor, at the table, while Sherlock drones on and taps away on his computer. John snores (which he himself says is patently untrue) and the susurrus of his sinuses droning in his throat disturbs Sherlock. Sometimes John almost wakes up to a cold finger arranging his hair, cataloguing the exact texture, strength and colour of it. He doesn’t have Sherlock’s wild fringe, so there are no errand curls out of place, just a tuft of hair on the wrong side which apparently needs to be arranged immediately.
After breakfast, while Sherlock continued to fiddle with his radio equipment, John sat down at the kitchen table, covered it with old newspapers he had found at the back of a closet and took out his polishing kit again. Kneeling by his bed, he slid out an old wooden case and took out a hunting rifle. The smell of gun oil and the tinge of gunpowder were not familiar smells, but Sherlock felt drawn towards them, suddenly intrigued by the process that made the killing machines he usually despised efficient in their job as well as with the man who went about his task efficiently but performed it with great care, checking and polishing each part with tender fingers.
As it turns out, the swimming gear is the least of John’s problems as they jump into the shallow end of the very cold pool the next day.
“What the ---“
“Collecting,” Sherlock sniffs deep over John’s shoulder and rubs his fingers over the skin of his back.
Turning round, he sees Victor holding a chessman in his hand, tossing it up and down. Without having noticed, they have been standing in the middle of the quadrangle with several board games on stone benches. Victor looks at Sherlock with a wide grin.
John is still leaning against his chair but his eyes are cast down so Sherlock can’t see his expression.
“Hello, Victor.”
“I do like Poe,” Sherlock heard himself say.
“Of course we are. We always have been.”
Sherlock shrugged.
“What, the match box?” John asks as Sherlock gets to work.
Sherlock’s hands brushed against his shoulders.
Irene laughs and leads him towards a small bench.
John eyes the table like it could give him the answer. Clearly it can, because he turns to Sherlock with a pondering sigh.
The same happens every time John exits the shower, but for a completely different reason. Sherlock has named it Lust, never having felt it, never having spared any thought to it, he now experiences the symptoms on a regular basis. Every morning at 8:45 John emerges from the bathroom in a cloud of steam, dries his hair on a towel and makes Sherlock’s blood sing in his veins.
He picked up the book and turned the page, lost in thought, sucking on the last inches of his cigarette.
“And Mycroft?” John asks carefully.
“I am not being a child. I sometimes experience pain in my feet because of the veins. I need to lift them up when this happens. But before I can do that, you have to get your butt up, up and away from my spot.”
“He’s our bomber.”
John looks over his shoulder before going back to his latest blog entry.
John shrugged his shoulders.
John looks amazed.
“Aye, milord.”
He never does, and Sherlock knows he has to accept that. He has to keep his distance. So he abstains to one call a week, Fridays, six o'clock precisely.
“I’m not going, Sherlock,” John gulps half of his pint down his throat, like talking to Sherlock is an emotional strain and he needs to strengthen himself with alcohol.
He can’t stop it.
“Just for a few months. You’ll be back before you know it and then you can continue to live your life just as usual ---”
John could see it, of course he could. He was a doctor and a soldier, he was used to identifying pain.
It’s shameful, that he has forgotten something so important. He must remember to check. But he forgets all the ways of collecting data when John does indeed push up from his chair, crick his neck one more time (oh, there it is, so so slightly but still), walk to the kitchen and smile at Sherlock.
“You don't know that. You will familiarise yourself with the surroundings. Now.”
At the edge of the forest, he stopped and listened. Further and further away, the voices of gunfire could still be heard, but now it was only one gun, only one man shooting blindly into the dark. And it was the sound of a rifle, not that of the small handgun John had for his only protection.
He lets her hold his hand until they reach the hotel.
“We should consider getting married. I hear they give you good whiskey when you do,” Sherlock informs him and he rubs his earlobe.
“It didn’t hurt yesterday.”
Three minutes to midnight he picks the lock on the front door, steps inside, leaves his coat in one of the dressing rooms and opens the door leading to the pool area, pausing to scan the vast room before stepping in slowly.
Mr Trevor opened the window, shoving at it with both hands while his legs stayed tangled around a sturdy branch of the elm growing under Sherlock’s window. His grin grew wider as Sherlock turned on the lamp by his bed and gathered the blankets closer to cover his body.
“You promise not to blow up my X-Men comics?” John asks.
“How is Beth doing in university?” Sherlock asks, surprised how much he is actually interested in Victor’s family.
Sherlock slips, dives back first into the icy water and gets fantastically soaked. Any normal person would get out from the pool as fast as possible before freezing stiff, but Sherlock stays in until he finds the highly important piece of evidence they need to formally charge the man watching the show with Detective Inspector Lestrade, Sergeant Donovan and half of the Metropolitan Police force.
“Irene, what the hell?” Sherlock hisses.
“What did you use to do, then? Before the war, I mean.”
John’s fingers were grasping his face, his nails digging to his cheeks like he wanted to attach himself to Sherlock from them. Sherlock stared down at him for a moment, looking at the tears that were gathering in his eyes, at the open desperation there, before bending down and kissing him furiously, all teeth and quick presses of lips.
Jim pulls a handgun from his coat pocket and throws it in Sherlock’s lap.
“And this?”
All the while, the red dot was pointed at his heart. Sherlock didn’t need a mirror to know where the other sniper pointed theirs when John froze and let Moriarty go. Of course it was his head, he doesn’t have a heart after all. Where else would they aim when they wanted to shoot to kill?
Pull.
Apparently, Sherlock is ticklish.
His eyes roam over Sherlock.
Pity. Embarrassment. Curiosity.
Sherlock blinks. He has forgotten Lestrade has stayed outside to talk to one of the neighbours and John is still at the clinic. He had sensed another person’s presence and just began to explain his conclusions.
Another radio operator had come in for her shift, set down her messenger bag with a pickled onion sandwich inside it, and chimed in with the latest war news to the circle of women and men gathered around one of the tables.
He flexes his fingers and squeezes them into fists as John walks into the room and sits down in the opposite chair. Listening to him prattle about the case, about the possible reasons that could make their client act like this, Sherlock only wants to get on his knees in front of him and bury his face against his stomach.
Sherlock lowered the book, staring out to the sea. A pair of seagulls flew above the waves, one of them sweeping around the other, attacking it with its beak wide open. Clearly the other had something it desperately wanted for itself.
Yellowbeard
“Why?”
“And still you choose to talk to me instead of your precious
Doctor Mortimer nods.
“Because I have no place else to go.”
“Sherlock?”
They are silent throughout the drive, Sherlock only occasionally giving Jim instructions on where to turn. Jim had insisted he would drive, so Sherlock sits next to him and stares out of the window, trying not to think of everything that might go wrong.
No reason to leave behind bloody footprints and give the Yarders more reasons to call him heartless.
He sees him later, after he has embarrassed the whole Yard once more by finding the essential piece of string that points the evidence towards the jealous sister-in-law. Anderson looks murderous, Lestrade is busy calling in the rest of the forensics to find the remaining pieces of string, but John stares at him like the second coming and says,
“Why?” he demands.
“Perhaps.”
. I don’t know why she was. You may have threatened Harriet.”
It’s a pity that Sherlock doesn’t hear what John has to say about his suddenly healed leg after Angelo has made his entrance and returned his cane. When Mrs Hudson hurries in the hall, almost in tears, they both forget about the miracle and run upstairs, Sherlock hoping that John notices even fleetingly how wonderful it is to
Referring to her by her preferred title, the Dominatrix, and what kind of services she provides gets a raised eyebrow from John and a muttered repetition of the title from Sherlock.
Sherlock’s fist hits the chair’s armrest and the whole room freezes.
Sherlock glances at the cane resting against the seat next to John.
“Both,” he says, pulling the gun out and pointing it at him.
“I was wondering if you’d like to have dinner.”
“Morning. Were you talking to someone?” he asks.
of a metal bolt sliding into a lock, silence, and a second later the voices of their perpetrators filling the room.
John’s tone is light. Anyone would say he is his normal self, but not Sherlock.
Bowl on the bedside table, John starts to drag the moist towel over Sherlock’s brow and neck. Sherlock beeps again.
“You sure can kick! Thank god for pilates.”
But somebody is already there.
But the look of disgust on John’s face as they exit the office space actually makes him trip on his feet.
“Same goes with you girls.”
Sherlock lets go of his right hand, his own still securely locked with John’s left. Together they take John’s last step with support, then Sherlock reluctantly lets go of John’s fingers and sure and confident of himself John begins to walk towards his mother. The camera flashes again.
He stares at the phone on his night stand until dawn. John comes to his door every hour but never says anything. Sherlock can see him standing there, probably leaning his ear against the door to hear anything out of the ordinary.
“What does it feel like, to have an itch you can’t scratch? When you got nothing to do to feel alive? Like I do. Have you ever tried it, Mister Holmes? Killing someone? Oh, it makes you feel so alive. Better than any narcotics, I’d say.”
Wilkes’ girl whistles, Wilkes himself chuckling slowly and turning round to collect fivers from the crowd having stopped to view the game. In the middle of the grumbling and victorious snickering, Sherlock suddenly jumps up, tipping the chess board over the table and scrambles to the exit with his papers clutched against his chest. Behind him, Victor, waving a bundle of money he has won from the viewers calls after him:
“I am not getting in there.”
John picked up a jar of gooseberry jam with his left hand, a jar of strawberry he usually preferred already in his right. He weighed them as if to see if the weight could somehow tell him which one he should take home with him.
“I find you attractive,” Sherlock begins.“Your aggressiveness towards me indicates you feel the same, but the tedious rules the society has placed on wooing has forced us to keep things slow and progress in a pace defined by an unknown indicator of customs and regulations which seem to be taken as truth by all sexually active human beings on the planet. Certain rituals have to be performed before we have sex. But now my formerly non-existent desire to have intercourse has suddenly been lit to a flame and directed solely at you. I am proceeding with the said customs accordingly, but all I really want is to have you as soon as possible.”
Next thing he knows, John is back and he has a
“You could always tell the truth. You know I appreciate that about you.”
“Why do you think that?”
“Of course I can. I just need to ---“
“I don’t know… What do I do? God, what do I do?”
“What are you, eight?” Sherlock screams.
John usually finds it easier to just sit in the armchair that has become his and not to complain but when so happens that for once he is at home without Sherlock and thus the sofa unoccupied, he throws himself on the thing and sighs contently.
John’s mouth works silently for a moment, before he laughs quietly.
‘Jim’ puts his arm around her waist and smiles.
And there it is. That dark velvet
“It’s freezing!” he exclaimed.
Sherlock looks up at him, eyes wild and when he speaks, it’s breathy and desperate,
John looks like he has been crying again, but Mycroft is his usual cold self, standing in attention in the middle of the room, claiming the whole space to himself, taking charge.
“But the hospital was real. And he was the one who put you there. Crawled inside your head and gave you in. Better finish him now or it will be the girls next.”
“Help me! They’re foreign operatives! They have my husband locked up somewhere! Please help me!”
“I’ll let you know next week’s lottery numbers.”
“So should I,” Sherlock says half asleep.
And rock back and forth in midair like some very gangly and surprised-looking spring rider.
He trails behind John, dodging between the graves, trying to keep his tone neutral, to make John laugh, casting his eyes down when he fails.
“Yoghurt. Banana.”
He clears his throat, rolls the pen around between his fingers for a moment.
“I’m missing it, what is it?”
He dreaded the day they had to start drinking Postum or some other horrendous mixture, and only because his brother had deemed other supplies more important than a decent quantity of quality coffee.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean ---“
“There is no usual in this case,” John snarls. “You don’t know him
“188.”
He opens the door and Sherlock stumbles against him and on him, pulling them both to the floor. The small bag stuffed full of clothes and other bric-a-brac lands next to them.
“You died and I couldn’t save you.”
,” he kisses the memory stick and strokes it between his fingers.
It had been easier that way, piece by piece. His jaw was sharper, his lips thinner, his nose more pronounced.
It’s more intimate this way.
“Never mind Perkins. He’s going blind with age. Probably didn’t even realize the dog was the only thing covering your modesty.”
Mycroft walks in before the fire crew even has had time to put their gear together, takes one look at the dusty floor and pieces of glass still hanging from the window frames and sinks down in John’s chair with a heavy sigh. Sherlock does not see this. He is taking a shower, washing pieces of glass from his hair, and when he enters the sitting room one of the firemen is interviewing Mycroft and there’s a hot pot of tea in the kitchen, provided by Mrs Hudson. Mycroft sits in John’s chair like it’s a throne, Sherlock sneers at him, picks up his violin and sits down in his own chair.
. I was having a good summer, listening to Thom Yorke's vocals and thinking "Yes, I shall write a fanfic on this." This was almost two years ago.
John tries to call out something of an answer and perhaps his muffled yell conveys some kind of understandable message to Mrs Holmes. Her steps tap away down the stairs and into the dining room where Mr Holmes and Mycroft, bowties already in place, are sitting with their knives and forks ready, napkins folded in the collars of their Christmas jumpers.
“Well, there, you see? Problem solved.”
Molly stares at the paper for a second, then marches out with her face suddenly very pale.
A blonde, a brunette and a redhead. It’s like the beginning of a bad joke.
His expression was priceless.
John stretches on tiptoe and his jumper hikes up slightly.
Sherlock grasped his hand tightly.
His own monster under the bed, his own words echoed in Henry’s first visit.
“I meant maybe you could offer me one. John still doesn’t allow me to smoke even though it’s now been scientifically proven I am mad.”
“Because you do, and I believe you.”
Of course John doesn’t come back to him right away, of course he doesn't.
Suitable name.
And so Sherlock slept.
John looks like he wants to break his spine.
“There are
The Union Jack is next to fly and Sherlock dodges just in time but is caught by John’s foot that extends in front of him, sending him crashing on the rug. John jumps astride on his back and begins to explore his sides in search of ticklish bits.
When he next set off towards the woods, Sherlock followed him from the window, trying to determine where it was that John was able to observe him, but the darkness swallowed him instantly and Sherlock could not catch a glimpse of him before he was back in the sunlight again.
“Listen, I have a good feeling about this. I really like her and for once she has not had the chance to meet you before the third date when it’s
“We are sitting ducks, waiting for a plane to pop up in the sky, fly over us and drop bombs on the nearest village. And while we wait, I sit in front of the radio and hope that someone will start tapping in not-yet-decoded German while you stalk around the woods like an elf with a shotgun.”
A man opening the front door to his building.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock answers to his clergyman disguise.
Sherlock opens his mouth, expression set to deny this, to argue against it.
“Do it again,” John whispers, leaning into Sherlock’s warmth. “Do it again!”
Sherlock brushed his fingers over it. An Enfield No. 2 Mk I, .38/200 calibre. A fine gun, standard for military personnel. A much better one than its replacements issued due to the shortage.
He is wearing the cornflower blue shirt with white stripes. Or white shirt with cornflower blue stripes. Sherlock would very much like to count the stripes, drape his hand over John’s back and chest and stomach and sides and arms while he counts.
“First of all, you must know that we could not reveal all the details before you had signed the contracts. Obviously, even if you hadn’t and would have exposed the operation, the consequences would have been unpleasant for you but this way if you give out any information about this mission, you will be publicly shunned and measures will be taken for your imprisonment.”
“Lies, lies, lies!” Jim singsongs, taking a few waltz steps towards Sherlock, standing right at gunpoint. “All lies! All creation, all in your pretty little head. No real people there, no real wedding. You were asleep the whole time.”
He promises to lie through his teeth, even though it will only hurt John more. But it will remove the suspicion, make John hate him and return to Sherlock. He needs him back before he can send him away again. Needs him to be able to pretend for the last time that he doesn’t care, that he doesn’t feel.
Mycroft excuses himself in the middle to answer a phone call and returns saying something clearly in code about Bond Air and Coventry which Sherlock finds vaguely interesting.
“Stay there,” John tells him.
A clatter from the next room told them that ‘they’ were indeed in hearing distance.
It’s sure to make John come with him, mentioning his passion for writing down Sherlock’s life in his blog, and even remembering the title.
He scrambles to his feet and squeezes her tightly. She laughs in his ear and kisses his cheekbone.
Sherlock stares at Jim, then Irene.
While John had prepared the coffee, Sherlock had stood in front of the small mirror next to the faucet, the thin curtain pulled securely between them to separate the nook from the rest of the room. Sherlock had stared at himself, unable to recognise the pointed jaw and sharp cheekbones at first.
And yet, and yet.
“Then give me something to think about so I won’t have to talk out of boredom.”
It had passed through several hands on its way to Sherlock’s, like a secret love letter being handed from one trustee to another until it finally reached the one it was intended for.
here, John,” the terrified whispering continues. “And they’re all idiots, none of them have committed any murders, only a few infidelities and one or two insurance scams, and they’re so
“No, they didn’t. The war did.”
“Never fall in love, Sherlock,” he says. “You will only get hurt and spend the rest of your life pining for something you could never have.”
Sherlock inspects him from the corner of his eye.
Sherlock glances at the men holding their army machine guns, holsters with handguns balanced on their hips, arms thicker than his head.
“I realise my actions, my inability to talk to you about my life lately have seemed odd. Insane even.”
He knows John hates having his nipples touched, sees this in the way he tenses the one time Sherlock’s tongue goes anywhere near them, the way he whimpers softly, in a way that is in no way sexy or pleased.
Without stopping to ponder whether his brother had taken to sleeping under the table in the radio room to be available to bark orders at him at all hours he ran to the door, grabbed the closest of the guns John had hung on the wall and stormed out.
“MF2? Come in, MF2!” the soldier called.
Sherlock lifted the covers in an invitation. Like a boy climbing in to his best friend’s room without their parents knowing, his guest quietly pushed himself in with the strength of his upper body, jumped nimbly to his feet to close the window against the growing blizzard, all the while shivering in the cold. He chucked all his clothing except his socks and ran to the bed. Sherlock would have found his shorthanded nakedness amusing, but when Mr Trevor pressed his bare skin against his, instead of creeping coldness he suddenly felt that incinerating heat again that took his breath away. Even Mr Trevor's cold fingers against his stomach, his chilly cheek against his thigh, made him feel like he was being burned inside out.
in my
“You’re still here.”
Sherlock is walking on pins and needles the whole time, sitting in the kitchen with Irene Adler’s photos covering the table and he curses the fact that John’s chair is not the one facing the kitchen. If he tried to move it, John would probably just turn it round again and keep on ignoring him.
“Take it out.”
The battle ends with a kick from John’s knee hitting Sherlock’s temple and they call it a draw. Not the hollow humming inside his head or the ostrich egg sized bump that is forming on his head can take away the glee Sherlock feels as he lies on the dusty rug, hand up John’s jumper, having searched and found where the good doctor tickles, and John does not comment on the hand but lets it be.
“Stop slobbering over my hand, it aches.”
Sherlock covers John’s barely visible mouth with his hand.
. Barely.”
It had taken hours for Sherlock to wash the smell and filth from his hair, and his dry-cleaner had predicted that the Bellstaff would never be the same.
Damn that Mycroft had to be there.
“Doctor Watson,” she panted, “there is a man --- goodness, where are you taking those linen? You should let one of the nurses take care of them! --- a man in Doctor Albertson’s office waiting for you --- give them to me, sir --- and wishes to speak to you urgently.”
Sherlock can’t resist a few deductions, trying to show off to John more than to Sebastian, who turns to John almost immediately, like he is his ally, and explains their history.
His usual group of admirers is surrounding him, Wilkes from Economics, Anderson from Chemistry and several others who Sherlock hasn’t bothered to memorise. They are eyeing a group of girls standing at the bar, though Anderson’s eyes wander off to the opposite corner where a curly-haired woman in a tight mini skirt is talking to another one in an even tighter skirt, both holding a pint.
“Girlfriend… Not really my area,” he says dreamily, eyes glued to the street outside the window.
He hides his shaking hands inside his coat pockets and his fingers hit something. He pulls out the squash ball, useless now that he has been declared dead. No need to have it hanging around, no need to make sure that should the occasion rise he could use a simple trick to fool someone else into believing his pulse has stopped.
He stays focused on him as the people lay him down, fuzz around him, attach him to things, poke him with things, tie him to things.
He turns to look at John. Instead of applauds, he gets a slap in the face from Miranda who storms away and a disgusted look from John.
He would blush, that’s for sure. He always does when Sherlock suggests something he deems inappropriate.
“Don’t take it too seriously,” Victor said, sitting down next to him. “You’re only human after all.”
“You wanna work for us?”
“A what?” John seems to be having trouble concentrating on anything but Sherlock’s lips.
He was not this easily affected. He could endure physical and emotional torture. He didn’t have feelings. Everyone said so. He should not, would not, act like this –
“Sex doesn’t alarm me!”
“Might have. It was mostly the cat and the mouse who tried to kill each other.”
“Of course I will,” he tried again, burrowing himself deeper into John’s embrace. “You’re here.”
He does not look at Sherlock but feels him nod, gets up and walks fast to the kitchen. Sherlock hears a glass clink, water run and silence as John gulps it down. Glass breaks against enamel, a hard kick sounds against the cupboard and John sobs quietly,
Extreme jealousy hits him a mere second after he has pressed send. He looks at the picture of her, taken from behind one of the ridiculous large barrels that used to store wine or beer but now serve as a place for the patrons to lower their glasses on while chatting each other up in the dim candle light.
“Boys, please, not here.”
“He was young, probably had a blind belief in authority. I saw many people like that in my time: so trained to take orders they couldn't understand how anyone could live without them. If he had had any sense, he would have recognised you for what you are.”
Sherlock remained in the library for as long as he could, hoping that his silence would make his mother forget about him. She might have, but nothing could save him from his brother, who, having knocked on the door for several minutes, finally entered by his own volition and informed him that the Kovács had arrived. The news successfully roused Sherlock from his melancholy, for even though he would have to suffer through several pinches on his behind as well as claps on the shoulder that almost knocked him to the floor from his boisterous aunts and uncles, with his cousin arrived the one spark of light that could help him endure this horridness.
The street is suddenly full of screaming, running footsteps, luckily noises of struggle as someone pulls the gun from the attacker, kicks him to the ground, and someone is there, with John and Sherlock, trying to help, trying to see where they are hit.
nightmares meant trauma on the battlefield.
Lifting his head from his notebook, he sees her lips shine in the sickly light.
“Watson!”
He is aching for a cigarette.
But the flash in Moriarty’s eyes, the deep deep stare Sherlock recognises from the lab ensures him that Moriarty knows exactly where to look for the missing beating organ.
At first, the man’s presence had made him feel like a trapped mouse in front of a gang of hungry alley cats. Now the imminent threat had suddenly transformed into a deep feeling of uneasiness and embarrassment.
He’d only remembered he couldn’t swim when John had asked him. And he thought that if John was there when he went under, it wouldn’t be too bad.
John smirks.
He peeked at John through the steam. The mug was back in his hands, warming them in the cool sea breeze. He was dressed in his trousers and a warm long-sleeved shirt. He had a gun securely holstered over his hip.
In the morning, the room smelling of sex and the sour aroma of two men breathing the same air for the whole night, the windows and doors closed to protect them from more than just the chill of the winter morning, Sherlock finally felt truly happy.
Sherlock, never paying much attention to her mother’s ramblings, had offered a solution in the form of a softly mumbled suggestion, almost a thought spoken out loud by accident, that she should invite the Trevors. This was succeeded by an exclamation of glee from his side for having checkmated his brother yet again, followed by an even louder one from his mother who deemed her son’s idea worth a run to the telephone and loud orders to the butler to get two extra plates for the table.
“The missile
Now John says it like it’s natural for anything Sherlock does to be fine. Oh, how little he knows him.
“Here.”
He wore a sour face all the way through dinner, which was not an uncommon expression for him. These days it seemed to be permanently glued on his face whenever he was forced to spend time with his little brother, and now that he had invited his lover to their home to eat supper with their mother his scrunched nose and tight mouth indicated even more distaste, even more disapproval.
“There’s something there.”
surprising.
“Cold hands, Sherlock!”
John is safe.
So Sherlock decided to bring in the cases instead, since photos of organic matter (no matter how deceased) did not count.
John was surprised by the phrasing. It was not a question though he could hear the intonation of one at the end as a sign of a question mark.
“I forgot to kiss you goodbye,” Sherlock explains carefully.
“The way I see it,” she says, “John is the only thing you still consider real. I would recommend you hold on to that.”
“I am so pleased you could come,” she said, planting a kiss on the man’s cheek. “Mycroft is here somewhere, discussing
John lowered his arms.
“Do I have a choice?” Sherlock asked, without a hint of hope in his voice.
There he stops.
“You are young enough.”
Mrs Watson fidgets with a tissue the whole time they sit and wait, never looking up. But when the doctor comes to tell them the surgery was successful and that John has been moved to recovery, she sits down next to Sherlock and lays her hand on his.
John kept his eyes on him, even though from the corner of his eye he could see that Sherlock Holmes whipped his head around to see what his next action would be. To his surprise, John did not hate him. He was annoying for sure, but he could live with that. He had lived through a war with several of the worst people he had ever met among the soldiers in his troop. He could survive just one, even if he would turn out to be worse than all of them put together.
He actually said that? No piss off, or screw you, or go to hell?
Mycroft has a text alert on his posts but with a little bit of luck he is busy and won’t have enough time to figure out which pool he means.
Sherlock sits down at the edge of the chair on the other side of Victor’s desk.
“I didn’t know you could sing,” John comments back at Baker Street, sitting in his chair as Sherlock tunes his violin and drags the bow over it once or twice.
“No,” Sherlock said and leaned his cheek against John’s shoulder. “You’re warm.”
“And please refer to your employer by name. I think I’ve deserved at least that.”
It’s nothing like the kiss outside the restaurant. It’s cooler, deeper and somehow even softer than before.
“Hopefully not!” John says to the First Folio. “I just have a blog I write stuff into. I’ve had good feedback, but to publish something? No.”
Sherlock jumped up.
Sherlock freezes.
“What’s in the stream?” John asks together with Detective Inspector Carter who has been tailing him, his bald spot catching the camera every once in a while.
Sherlock looks back up.
“Stop.”
“He could have stopped it. He could have sent anyone else, but he sent you. Just to spite me. Just to see how low I would fall, then pick up the pieces and pretend like he had done me a great service.”
Sherlock scoffed.
“Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. My lack of social graces will make me blurt out something stupid and you will reply with physical violence, more or less. Tit for tat,” Sherlock straightens his posture slightly.
He finds the lists by accident while he is sitting on the side of Sherlock’s bed, stroking his hand through the curly hair. He doesn’t find them as much as sees them, staring at him on the bedside table.
He punches Sherlock in the stomach and he falls back on the carpet, couching. Patting his hands like they are dirty, flicking lint from his suit, Jim turns around and walks leisurely to the door. There he turns again and says brightly,
“I'm afraid you have to endure him for a long time yet.”
On a final note, the name and chapter titles come from the Radiohead song
, says John’s heart.
“Would you like to do this? Help me out every once in a while? Nothing big. Just… little stuff every once in a while. Very hush hush though. Can’t have everyone finding out we use consulting detectives to catch the bad guys. You’d soon be courted by every country in Europe and abroad.”
Sherlock is stunned.
“Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.”
He takes a breath and Sherlock wonders if what is to come will be John’s resignation from the case. It could be too much for him, this.
“This is a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock?”
“How about Irene?” Doctor Mortimer persists. “Why do you think you saw her in my office?”
!” John screams.
He turned back around to scratch at his beard, showing the star of the exit wound and every well-defined line of his back again.
“Oh for goodness sakes, John! Don’t be such a child.”
He leans casually against the table, making a metal dish clang to the floor.
“All I can do for you now is give you a friendly advice to go back to bed. You’re doing yourself no good walking about,” he looks down at Sherlock’s feet, “without any socks on. Jesus, Sherlock! It’s like you
John glanced at him. Since Mr Holmes’ speech had had no impact on his brother, it had clearly been meant for him.
“You’ve even started to sneeze like a cat.”
Victor glances towards the empty doorway, then back to Sherlock and his clenched fist.
“I’ll give you all the whiskey you want even if you don’t marry me,” John ensures him.
“Come on, John!” Sherlock pleaded. “I’m bored, and it’s all your fault!”
“Thank you,” John whispers. “Thank you so much, Sherlock.”
“Tell me where they are! Please, just tell me!”
Sherlock sits and drinks it all in. In the busy room, no one sees his stare wander over every single person in there, scanning them as he goes, filing away funny things to tell to John when he goes home.
His voice is shaking,
It’s not the leg, because he hasn’t noticed it yet. He’s stopped because he’s afraid of heights. He has stopped to calculate the distance between this roof and the next and how far away he is from the safety of the solid ground.
In the kitchen, the music was still flowing quietly from the wireless, a woman’s voice was humming along with the song. The hallway was dark and the only light came from under the closed kitchen door. A shadow moved over the spot of light, heels clicked against the floor, the music was turned up when a new song began.
He looks wonderingly at the piece of meat oozing something unpleasant over his hand.
John had said no so forcefully both Henry and Sherlock had startled.
He steps away from the gun and moves to stand next to Sherlock’s shaking form.
kiss you as much as you like when you’re healthy again.”
“But what else am I supposed to say to you, her mother?”
“But with enough good reasons, what do a few bad ones matter?”
, but he is hoping it will make John stop, make him turn back and return, not make him walk even further away to the parking lot and disappear behind the bushed
John disappears to the kitchen and they listen to him click on the kettle and place cups on a tray. Lestrade tries not to look too hard at Sherlock, who takes the pills like they burn, places them on his tongue and gulps down the water.
The machines hooked to the rest of the patients in the recovery ward beeped in agreement.
John sighed quietly, placed his wallet next to his bag on the bed and went to open the first box with canned peas and bully beef in it.
“Why is it all about sex with you people, hmm?” he throws the pile of photos on the table. “You, Irene Adler, all of you are the same. It’s just carnal pleasure and nothing more. Why can’t you just think with your
Another shot shook the forest, and Sherlock, never minding anymore about correct language, broken radios or his own life, called out to the microphone.
Sherlock Holmes snorted out a laugh.
Sherlock looks back at John whose mouth is hanging open, sees the stiffness in his spine as well.
“They will,” Sherlock says, scooping up a handful of peas and dumbing them in the bucket. “As soon as I solve the case, they will invite me over for tea once a week and hand me a souvenir bag full of ashtrays.”
Of course Sherlock wants to ask. He wants to know what Moriarty did to John in the hours between the front door of 221 closing behind his heels and his reappearance at the pool. He wants to know if he just has to pluck all of Moriarty’s teeth out with pincers or to stable his fingers on a table and burn the room around him so that the screaming inside his head will stop.
“The usual punishment followed: locked in the attic for a few hours and to bed without dinner.”
“I just want to take you to bed all the time,” he tells John, rubbing his face against his neck. “I can’t think about anything else.”
“Mr Hartley,” he said kindly.
“Here”.
“I don’t think they’ll be very pleased to see the state of their back yard when they come to work tomorrow.”
John pockets his own phone with a sigh and returns Sherlock’s to its hiding place inside his chair (there is a hole in the upholstery under the seat).
“You know who that is?”
He let Nurse Ford take his burden without a fight and hurried past her towards the offices at the front of the building.
John is still following him.
He waits until he sees John return to the bar, spot Louise Mortimer and steer towards her with prominent ease in his step and a bottle of white wine under his arm. When Sherlock sees her smile at him, he turns around and walks upstairs to their room.
“What is so great about it anyway? Disgusting,
Probably was. Or had been.
“You can’t reason your way out of this!” Mycroft bellows suddenly.
“How is the clinic treating you?” he asks.
His tone has stayed cold, but there’s a sting in his words he doesn’t want John to hear.
“Did he dive in again?” she asks John who has only stopped to apologise for the ruckus and the drops of water in the hallway.
“Don’t talk,” John said, pushing him upright slowly and slotting his arm around his waist, threw Sherlock’s own arm over his shoulder and began to walk towards the cabin.
Sherlock wondered what would happen if he snatched it while John did not notice. He took it everywhere he went. It would be a challenge.
“Yes, I know,” Sherlock smiles.
John Watson will be brief, swift, shorter than he is himself, he will leave in a fortnight and people will start their search again, friends will worry about him being lonely, Mycroft will worry about not being able to snoop into his business.
“No, thank God!” Victor chuckles. “But when she does, I’m sure you’ll be very charming and not pick her apart but give an interesting lecture on how you once found that body with the mouldy genitals.”
Back at Baker Street, John is still sitting in his chair, dutiful as ever, looking for a case for him. He glances up when he bursts through the door, sees the harpoon first, then lifts his gaze slowly and almost raises his eyebrows over his head in surprise.
Jim’s eyes have gone dark, determined. He knows Sherlock has realised he has no choice but to help him.
blame yourself for this. If anything, we should be thankful that you appeared in his life. You saw the symptoms, you called us, you did the right thing. And when it comes to the hallucinations, he has had them for years, far longer than is typical. In his case, I’d recommend medication as well as ECT.”
It does.
John says nothing.
Sherlock looks at him embarrassedly from under his fringe.
“Instead of taking a taxi, you wanted to have a jog to the NSY.”
He still had the Enfield strapped against his hip. Sherlock thought about how quick John was to draw, tried to calculate whether he would be able to lunge for the rifle and fire before John had time to react.
Nor do they bite them, but Sherlock still attaches his teeth to John’s face.
“Such a fuss!” Jim tsks. He shakes invisible lint off his jacket, rolling something between forefinger and thumb, flicking it away he turns to Sherlock. “Why bother? He is not even real.”
Excitement. Interest. Bafflement. Disbelief. Anger.
“That’s because you were getting better and then threw it all away because you can’t shut up if your throat is not welded shut.”
He ran into the forest.
Sherlock continued quietly.
Sherlock jumps up and stares down at John groaning with his face squashed into the pillows.
He doesn’t feel as victorious ten minutes later. The answer to the puzzle posted online, the phone rings instantly, the old woman screaming for help on the other end, suddenly describing the man who dictated to her,
Sherlock panted with hate, both of his hands now clenched into fists.
“They just let us in and allowed us to take whatever we pleased and we suspected nothing!”
“You’re still fuzzy in my mind palace. I need to know exactly how you feel and smell to be able to remember you.”
“I’m wearing pants.”
“How do you like her?” Irene asks, slipping her arm through his.
In the dimness of his bedroom, lips red and eyes bright, Sherlock looks up at him for admission only once and John gives it to him without a second thought.
“But,” John stammers and clenches the knees of his jeans, “I would know if his work included anything like that. I work
“The bullet wound. It’s gone. I can’t find it.”
John expression is neutral, inspecting Sherlock without judgement, waiting for him to say more.
