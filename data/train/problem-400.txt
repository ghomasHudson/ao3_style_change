And so Sherlock sits back on his heels, slides his hands up John’s thighs, and leans down to rest his head on John’s knee.
She was pretty practical about patching us up, and we weren’t supposed to cry, just sort of keep calm and carry on.
John shivers at the still fresh memory of Sherlock’s hand accidentally sliding over the curve of his arse, of his tongue sliding against John’s, tantalisingly slow, exploratory.  He thinks he can still feel the taste of Sherlock’s moans in his mouth.
Sherlock can simply drift, can let his mind wander to thoughts of all the potential; lazy afternoons, naked, tangled with one another under the sheets.
Sherlock’s eyes slide shut, and then pop open again with a frown, when John’s fingers catch and tug.
And he hates himself most of all, for getting up off the sofa, and frantically rooting through the cramped little closet for his clothes, and dashing for the loo where he’s now standing, back against the door, head spinning, blood singing, cock half hard in his pants.
By the time Sherlock looks back, the man has disappeared inside the shop, and John’s fist is white knuckled.
He has the sleeves of his button down rolled up to the elbow, and a glass of scotch in his hand, scotch Sherlock can only assume came with the house.
His fingers stir at Sherlock’s waist, slide up over his ribs even as John’s breath, warm and wonderful, whispers over Sherlock’s skin.
And Sherlock wonders at himself, why he is like this, pushing this thing, why on earth he is so invested, so ‘all in’, so quick and so early.
“Well, it’s kind of hard to say when you’ve only just got here, yeah, but I think you will, and Sherlock’s bought it for us as a Christmas present, so we can come here whenever we like.
“And yet, the letter this envelope contained is nowhere to be found, which suggests he took it with him.”
He is beautiful, Sherlock thinks, not beautiful in the way Sherlock is, not all flawless skin, and sculpted muscle, and lean, taut flesh.
John gets two paper cups of bracing tea for the road, and they head West, where they encounter village, after village, question shop-keepers and tourists alike, and all to no avail.
Sherlock huffs, another tear spilling over to cling to his bottom lashes, just as he looks back down at the ring on his finger.
Sherlock’s eyes crack open, still heavy with sleep, and his brow knots in the way that always makes John want to lift a finger and smooth it out.
From what I gather she wasn’t too keen on leaving Arthur here, and only did so because of his education.
The Skype session flickers to black, and John leans back in his chair, and lifts a hand to his eyes.
“John, all through the Victorian era public baths were very popular in Europe, and co-bathing in the nude was hardly considered…”
He stands in the middle of the little kitchen that just a couple of years prior had been a drugs lab, and he listens to Rosie singing along to her film in the lounge, breathes in the scent of John’s home cooked meal in the oven, and relishes in the warmth of him in his arms, and he realises that he is the luckiest person in the world, and he never would have thought, a few years prior, that this could be possible, that it was even something he might want.
John hasn’t been really angry in a long time, and Sherlock thinks that’s good, that maybe that’s progress, but why should he care?
Mycroft takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly, and John sees something he never would have expected—genuine worry.
Sherlock points them in the direction of the bed and when they get there John lets himself be pushed back, yields beneath Sherlock’s weight, hips pushing up, an already impressive erection pushing against Sherlock’s belly, brushing against his own.
John’s fingers are small, and his cock thick, and it’s going to take a lot more prep than this for Sherlock to be comfortable.
He’s afraid John might break, and if he’s perfectly honestly with himself, John’s not so sure himself.
And John does pull away at that, rolls onto his back and stares up at the ceiling.  “Not hard enough, you mean.  Not about the things that matter.”  He scowls, and cranes his neck, to stare down the length of his body.  “Christ we are a mess.”
It’s not harsh, but there is an authority to it that immediately reminds Sherlock that he is dealing with a soldier and a doctor, and not just some fly-by-night eccentric with a penchant for alternative therapies.
He’s not going to cry, not here, not like this in front of the whole world (or at least the 5K+ followers Sherlock has on his YouTube channel).
He wants to speak, but there is nothing to say, and they have never really done well with words anyway.
“When I spoke to Wilder in London he mentioned that your son was a very practical boy, that he would not have been prone to running off with strangers.
But you—you’re aroused by what she does, or is, hence the jealousy, hence you trying to foist her on me, or me on her.”
I hated you for so long, and when I stopped I started hating myself instead, but—I’m glad you’re home.”
His tongue darts out to moisten his lips, and he rolls his eyes toward the ceiling, before sighing deeply.
“Suit yourself.”  And then John is back in the kitchen, banging pots and pans about, much more loudly than before.
A lot more people than I anticipated are unfamiliar with ASMR, and are starting to discover it through this story.  I promised a few folks on Twitter that I would add links to my favourite ASMR channels here, if people want a little taste.  Bear in mind that everyone's tastes and tingle triggers are different, so what works for me, may not work for you, but here's my list:
Sherlock knows he is fortunate to be allowed to stay here.  Some meddling of his brother’s no doubt. He’s grateful for once.  He can’t imagine what he would do if he weren’t allowed to see John, shut out, family only.
Sherlock is laid out on the bed, in the rattiest pair of pyjamas John thinks he’s ever seen, his t-shirt inside out, and his hair a mass of frizz, as though he got into the shower and then got out again without remembering to wash it.
“Sometimes at night, when I’m alone, and we’ve been talking, after you hang up I’m left aching, aching for you.
John wonders if it’s shock, or if he just isn’t sure what to do with his hands, so he waits, lifts his hands to cup Sherlock’s face, to trace his thumbs along his cheekbones, and waits.
Scooping Watson up in one quick motion, he holds her out in front of him like a piece of sour laundry.
And as he starts to drift again, it’s to the question of whether he had been this for Victor those two, unbearably long years.
“I think I could spend a lifetime plumbing your depths, and never come close to unravelling your mysteries.
Sherlock’s thumbs trail through pools of come, leave slick, cool trails in their wake over his abdomen and hips.
For a moment John thinks he’s going to leave, just like that, that’s it’s all been too much, or not enough, that he’s got this all wrong—it wasn’t wanted, he’s not wanted, and Sherlock will walk away, now—for good.
His legs rise up to lock around Sherlock’s thigh, and he ruts against him, panting, grabbing out blindly for any part of him he can find.
He’s wearing a black collarless shirt and jeans Sherlock has never seen before, and has his hands shoved casually into his pockets.
Sherlock’s eyes slide closed, and his mouth drops open, and they haven’t talked about this, not at all, and why now?
His eyes search John’s, and John feels naked, raw, laid bare in the face of that piercing, knowing, gaze.
- This is the channel that inspired this story.  Originally I was going to have John be the one with the ASMR channel, but changed my mind.  ASMR Surge does amazing work, dresses and is built somewhat like John, and even has a few videos were he is unboxing military MRE kits (and wouldn't Sherlock just LOVE that!).  He never shows his face or speaks.  All of his triggers are tactile/auditory in nature and involve the manipulation of objects.  Check out
He’s rambling.  It’s panic, John suddenly realises.  It’s sheer panic, and Sherlock is unwittingly showing every single one of his cards.  It’s all the confirmation John needs.
Sherlock is just entering the lounge from the kitchen, and she swings Rosie up into his arms, and then reaches out for Margaret’s hand and pulls her into a dance.
He pulls him closer, hands sliding down Sherlock’s back, the tips of his fingers dipping just under the waistband of Sherlock’s pants, and stopping.
What would John do if Sherlock were to give in to the demands of his body, surge forward, nuzzle, palm, mouth, lick, swallow him down?
John laughs about it, and mentions that it’s only the mad ones who are out strolling the beach in so much cold, and Sherlock’s blood sings at the lightness of his tone, and the way his eyes sparkle while he presses in close for warmth.
He’s panting into cool, sterile air of the loo, with Sherlock’s hot breath on his cheek, along his jaw, whispering over his earlobe.
It’s slow progress, but Sherlock thinks he could go on this way for some time before he would ever start to crave something more.
He shakes his head, somehow, just a little, but enough for Sherlock to see, and Sherlock exhales, as though he had been holding his breath, too, waiting (
Oh, he still has moments where he’s just not in the mood, and John has learned not to take those personally, but when he
Sherlock’s cock throbs against him, and he can feel himself getting hot, and somehow impossibly harder in Sherlock’s hand.
“I’ve rather bungled this it seems, but what I have rather artlessly been trying to suggest is that perhaps you and I might…”
Sometimes he still worries that it will all fall apart, because he knows he doesn’t deserve it, could never deserve it, and sometimes it all seems too good to be true.
He sees John consider, and then he does as asked, shrugging out of the vest, his wounded shoulder clearly stiffer, and with less range of motion than the other.
Mrs. Hudson cries, and hugs them both, and John can tell that Sherlock is properly satisfied with the level of sentiment expressed, even if he pretends the whole lot of them are ridiculous.
This thing they are is a battle Sherlock has been losing from the start, and he must be exhausted and terrified.
It’s clear John is all in, at the moment.  His hips are rolling in a slow, maddening cadence as Sherlock palms him, the weight of him giving Sherlock everything he needs, possibly too much, because it has been such a long time, and now that they’re here, and it’s happening, Sherlock knows that he’s too keyed up, that he’s likely to go off in another minute or so if John doesn’t stop.
Sherlock strips naked, without any preamble, and crawls beneath the sheets, so John does the same, draws close in the dark.
He stands back and motions for Sherlock to get in when he does, and Sherlock looks at the empty bed with John standing beside it, slightly ruffled (the woman at the pub had kept touching his hair), clearly exhausted, a bit tan, and breathtakingly beautiful, and he cries.
It hadn’t taken long of course, and he was quite tidy and all tucked into bed by the time John had come out of the bath and climbed into bed himself.
The rain of the night before has washed the air clean, resulting in a beautiful sunny day, cool air but warm sun, puffy white clouds skittering across a brilliant blue sky.
He swallows the last of the toast in his hand, and then hands the plate with the other slice across the bed to John.
John laughs, and then seems to realise that now that the bath is drawn, and Sherlock is in it, he is expected to get in it too.
He’s strides to the window, stares out it for some seconds, and then turns back to the room, and his secretary.
John smiles and get out of bed, fumbles about in the dark for his dressing gown and then goes downstairs to start the day.
not all the extras that Sherlock has barely given a thought to all these years, but which suddenly seem to be occupying his every waking thought.
Y'all, I realised this wasn't rated.  I've put a Mature rating on it now, just to be on the safe side where the lovin' is concerned.  If you know my stuff you know that the sexy times, on those rare occasions when they happen, are usually more love-making than porn.  But, anyway, I hope this doesn't make the rest of it unreadable for anyone.  If so, my apologies, and I totally understand.
With his girlfriends he was the good time guy, until he wasn’t, all laughter, and flirtation, and screaming orgasms until they’d pulled away, gotten cold, gotten angry.
Sherlock swallows back the lump in his throat.  “Yes well—let’s not waste another minute then.  I believe the food is getting cold.”
John looks up, needle still hovering threateningly close to his arm.  “Why?  Always together, isn’t that what you said to me six months ago?  Together or not at all.  You promised.  We vowed, so…  This is what we’re doing now, it seems.”
Sherlock walks to the bed, lays down, curls tight and stares at the Spring clouds skittering by outside the window.
“Perhaps you should stop asking me to help in the kitchen altogether, then, since I’m so clearly hopeless.”
Sherlock hears John open the fridge and close it again, take out the cutting board and their best paring knife which Sherlock had used on a cancerous liver on the weekend, and then absently put back without washing.
John lies back down, and reaches out, and Sherlock comes, curls into him, like nothing’s happened, and John tries not to hate himself.
They talk about the future, the things they might do to improve their little place, and about Rosie’s schooling, and about the way that London has changed, the whole of the country has changed since Brexit, and how that may affect both of their careers in the future.
He doesn’t want 221b Baker Street to be nothing more than rest stop John returns to on his journeys between women.
John rolls onto his side.  He’s looking at him, and Sherlock can’t even find the courage to look back.
Told her it was my leg broken, not my jaw, but she still seemed to think soup and bland sandwiches were the thing.
“Yeah, see—I’m not as clueless as you think I am, and I don’t think you’re quite telling me the truth.”
He turns around, shrugs his arms into the sleeves of the coat Sherlock brought him, and prises the axe out of the chopping block.
It’s quiet in the flat.  Mrs. Hudson is out. The evening rush of traffic has yet to pick up.  There is only the soft ticking of the clock on the wall, and John’s ragged breathing.  John’s nostrils flare. He presses his lips together in a straight, grim line.
John reaches for him the moment they are both under the covers, wraps his arms around his waist, tangles their limbs, pulls him close and kisses him.
“Listen, I—I know you saw her as a friend, and I think she saw you the same, she loved you in her own way, but…”
He looks afraid for a moment, like maybe the offer to come home is something Sherlock already regrets, something he might renege on at the slightest whim.
Unless—perhaps being by an open window, or other means of ventilation weakened the substance enough that they were less harmed?
Sherlock just says it, like it’s nothing, like it’s not John being the coward he knows he is, like it’s not John hurting him, over, and over, and over again, not being the sort of man that Sherlock deserves, not being…
It’s been a long while since they’ve kissed like this, taken their time with it, tasted, explored, let themselves sink into and get lost.
Sherlock turns his hand palm down and runs it over his arm, and John feels it, thinks he does at least, a warmth, a weight, a quiet hush of movement that leaves that subtle fire in its wake.
Rosie goes back to watching her film, humming to herself as she colours with the new crayons Mrs. Hudson brought her from the shops.
It’s not going to take long at all, and he thinks about Sherlock across the city, hard as a rock, touching himself, stroking himself, moaning John’s name.
He—he doesn’t have the right to even be thinking these things about a bloke he’s never met, whose face he’s never seen, and who he’s only started talking to a couple of days prior.
I wanted you from the moment you stepped into that lab with Mike, against all logic, wholly unexpected.
He’s actually grateful he indulged earlier, it means his body isn’t so quick to respond, no matter how stimulating the fodder.
John’s mouth is open, the muscles in his wrist tense, a sign that even in his sleep his fingers still stir, a subconscious echo of the pleasure he had just teased from his body while awake.
John races after him, and when he finally catches up, Sherlock reaches back and takes his hand, in the middle of the crowded street, he takes his hand, and just keeps on running.
a perfect surge of pain/pleasure that causes his hips to arch up off the chair of their own volition.
John looks stunned for a moment, and then a soft, shy smile spreads over his lips and his eyes flit away.
John laughs.  “Sorry about the sentimental display.  What would you say to dinner at Angelo’s in a couple of hours?  Too much?”
Sherlock is still beautiful in the way young men are, and John almost feels guilty at times, like some old letch, when he stands and stares at the way the sunlight worships and caresses Sherlock’s skin, the way his maturity has only served to soften out his angles and hard edges, the way his cheeks are still pink, and his eyes still sparkle.
She quiets, and then giggles, and Sherlock sighs, and rolls his eyes, but John can see the colour in his cheeks as he meets his eyes during the chorus, and he knows well enough that he’s pleased.
He’s managed to get ahold of the lube, has slicked his own hand, and taken over the rhythm John had abandoned.
John is relieved beyond measure, when they leave the country roads behind for the brightly lit motorway on the outskirts of London, and more relieved still when they finally get into the city proper, to familiar streets, and finally park the car in the car park a street over from
John clears his throat, returns to the table, stabs at the potato gratin with his fork rather more violently than necessary.
In the beginning John was unsure of how to navigate all the day-to-day logistics of a long term, committed relationship.
Sherlock wants to tell John that he knows, but he’s smart enough to know it might derail things, and so he keeps quiet, waits, barely dares breath in the fear of stopping John now.
And Sherlock somehow completely missed what John is asking, but he doesn’t care, because he’s aching for anything, everything, so hungry, starving.  “Yes.”
John reaches out, and slips an arm under his waist, and another over it, pulls him in close, tangles their limbs.
Hello,” because he can think of nothing else, so caught off guard he is by the depth of John’s eyes, the red rims, the way his brow knits in momentary confusion.
Mrs. Hudson comes up and brings them their mail, and a chocolate-hazelnut bundt, and then stays awhile to hear about Rosie’s day.
Finally he settles, thinks about other nights lying alone in the dark under this same roof, far away from home, his room, his dog, everything familiar.
He stands and stares out the window into the gathering dusk and gloom and tries not to think about the way he feels: small, and stupid, and a waste of space.
“Listen, it’s clear you’re used to snapping your fingers and people stepping up, that you’re used to moving people about like pawns in a game of chess, but this isn’t politics.
John’s cock pressed between his own abdomen and Sherlock’s perineum, slipping along the underside of his balls.
he juggles his cane and library bag in one hand as he keys in through the front door and heads for the lift.
He scowls down at the front of his trousers.  Half hard already.  It’s slightly embarrassing, how much he wants this.  He’d sworn he’d stay a step above base desire in this arrangement.  John needs him to keep a clear head.  It wouldn’t do to topple headlong into the chemical stew of lust, let it cloud his judgement completely.  He’d come dangerously close to that that day before in the hall.
He unzips, reaches inside his pants, and moans loud at the sensation of his cold hand wrapping around his hot cock.
Sherlock had been nothing but eagerness on the short drive over, but now that he is here, standing on the pavement and staring up at the windows of the flat (curtains curiously drawn at eleven o’clock in the morning), he suddenly feels uncertain.
Sherlock loosens each button carefully, peels the shirt open, frowns at the vest beneath, and then looks up and meets John’s gaze with a roll of his eyes.
He just lets it come, a bright burst that kicks a shout from his throat, and then washes over him in soft waves, as it subsides, waves that string out into quiet moans, and then to sighs, and then to quiet.
But his eyes linger over the soft plaster walls, and the rough hewn beams in the ceiling, and the faded chintzes of the overstuffed sofas, and they soften, the tension he always seems to carry in his shoulders loosens, his step is a little lighter.
Sherlock must be staring at him stupidly, because the corner of John’s mouth twitches upward, and he huffs out a laugh.
He politely declines, and accepts the invitation to stay for a month (or as long as they like) at a cottage in East Sussex.
It’s logical that she wants to find a way to categorise me that aligns with how she sees her peers categorising their adult caretakers.
He’s said his apologies again, and again, and again, and he doesn’t know what more he can do to make things right.
To John’s great relief Sherlock kisses back with a gasp and a sigh exhaled slowly through his nose, as he opens to John, let’s him deepen the kiss.  The relief washes over Sherlock’s body like a wave, all the tension of a moment before disappearing as John slides closer, twines their naked limbs.
Sherlock’s still not hard, and John tries not to worry about it, because he seems to be having an amazing time, and he’s resting the whole of his body weight on John’s throbbing cock, and it’s heaven.
It grips him suddenly, and with surprising force, a burst of pleasure so intense it makes his toes curl, and his back arch, and a sound escape his throat that would be embarrassing if anyone had been present.
He catches a cab easy enough, but it gets caught in traffic, and he’s late despite all his best efforts.
He thinks of watching Sherlock sleep, curls falling softly over a furrowed brow, lids fluttering, and how John had almost physically ached to be there, spooned behind him on the sofa where he could watch over him, feel and know that he was safe.
All these things, always battling within him, and him always terrified to see which of them might gain dominance.
“Is that what you meant when you said that your ASMR research was partially personal, that it was complicated?
He lies down, a makes sure to leave a little room for John on the pillow, and John crawls onto the mattress, and then lies down beside him.
He reaches between their bodies, reaches for Sherlock’s trousers, and Sherlock instantly stills, lets John unbutton and unzip him, reach inside his trousers to palm him.
He feels John smile against his chest.  “Mm. Feeling's mutual. Was very good of Donna—being murdered like that.”
He’s shown you who is, and believe me, Your Grace, that is something you want to take seriously, before it’s too late.”
Jesus, Sherlock, you don’t really think that after all this time, after everything, I’m still just here for the cases?”
If I was there, I—I’d make you so wet, I’d—I’d put my mouth on you, I’d swallow you down, and my mouth would be so slick, and so tight around you.”
Sherlock is usually more careful with him, but perhaps this is Sherlock more thrown by the video than he realises, desperate, stampeding through rather than treading on eggshells the way he usually does, and maybe that’s a good thing, necessary even, but…
People are usually hurling insults at him, or if the compliments do come, they’re meant as manipulation, being twisted into something far from desirable, used as a weapon rather than bestowed as a gift.
“So just to be clear, I could walk out of here, right now, and never come back, and that’s fine by you.”
They’re back on the road in no time, John wrestling to eat his hamburger while driving, and Sherlock relaxing back into the seat more and more, letting the sound of the road beneath their tires lull him as he nibbles at his food.
A voice somewhere denies him, and he weeps, he knows he does, at the sheer, inhumane, unfairness of it all.
He follows Sherlock’s stretcher into the A&E, and gives his forearm an encouraging squeeze before he’s carted off to radiology.
He sees something flicker across John’s face that makes him decide they will definitely revisit the entire idea at a later date.
He tangles his tongue with John’s, reaching out to taste him, and John shudders against him, moans into his mouth, all but rolls on top of him.
Sherlock slides down a little, trying to give him something to grind against, but it’s still not quite right, and so finally with a growl of frustration, he scoops John under the arse, and stands up.
He holds up the letters, and Sherlock rubs a hand over his face, and lets John arrange some pillows behind him, before lounging back again.
His ears strain for the sounds coming from downstairs—the opening of cabinets, the clinking of glasses.
John’s internal muscles relax and take Sherlock deeper, and Sherlock can imagine it now, what it might feel like to have that other part of him taken in, pulled close, held tight.  And he wants it suddenly, overwhelmingly. He wants to be taken. “John…”
He does as Sherlock orders, and Sherlock seems satisfied with John in his shirtsleeves, stroking his body through the thinner fabric.
It’s deep, and warm, the sort of voice that seems to envelop you like a blanket, make your blood sing and drain all the anxiety from your veins with a single syllable.
He lets his eyes slide shut, listens to the warmth and depth of the voice, listens to the whispering shush of hands stroking paper.
John sits up, heart racing, head spinning, ready to race to his assistance, only to realise that Sherlock is there, beside him in the bed, curled tight, trembling.
The flat is oddly dim when he emerges, and for a moment he wonders if it is the middle of the night and he was only dreaming when he heard John come back, if the delicious scents wafting from the kitchen are all some sort of hallucination and he’s finally tipped over the edge.
He makes it to the end of the alley before the shockwave of the first blast reaches him, flings him like a rag doll to the pavement on top of John, who does cry out then, but Sherlock doesn’t get up, he covers his head the best that he can, and lets his body shield John as pieces of debris rain down around them.
But John isn’t used to Sherlock noticing or calling out such things, and it makes that seemingly bottomless font of fondness well up in his chest all over again, tight and nearly overwhelming.
And that’s it, that’s the thing that breaks John wide open.  It’s sudden, and glorious, all restraint gone, he strides forward, jams a finger into Sherlock’s chest, vein in his forehead pulsing, eyes wild.  “No! No. You do not get to tell me how I feel. You do not KNOW ME, do you understand?!”
He sighs, and goes to the kitchenette, pours himself another glass of whiskey before going to fetch it.
It’s barely a whisper, which somehow seems appropriate given the hushed atmosphere, the pale, glowing silence outside.
And not just what you feel for him, but what he feels for you, what he’s always felt for you, by the way.
He shivers, and John says nothing, just pulls the front of his shirt open with one finger, and frowns at the bruising painting Sherlock’s ribs.
He’s unarmed.  He’s vulnerable, there are plenty of walkways and rafters above him, where a sniper could easily perch, unseen in the darkness.  He does his best to stay close to the shelving, to check his corners before turning to make his way down one long corridor after another.  He’s two rows from the end, when he turns the corner and sees a huddled form, curled tight on the concrete floor. It’s hard to tell in the dark, but something about the curl of the spine, the tuck of the head, the controlled stillness makes him think of John.
He’s nearly crying and he’s kissing Sherlock like it’s the first and last time, like he’s a drowning man, and the only thing keeping him alive are the moans he is drawing slow, and deep from Sherlock’s mouth, the way Sherlock shivers against him, and draws him in even closer.
And he must pitch his voice just right, must telegraph the requisite level of enthusiasm and desire, because John’s breath catches, and his lips part, and his eyes drop to Sherlock’s mouth, before returning to his eyes.
Sherlock pulls a chair closer to the fire and cracks open the book to the spot he’d left off the afternoon before.
The front door of the flat opens as they pull up to the kerb, and the woman John had seen chatting up the man behind the counter in the cafe weeks earlier stands there motioning for him to come in.
His hand shoots under the covers and clamps down, like maybe, somehow, he can stop it from happening, but he can’t of course.
He speeds up his hand instead, let’s the heat pool low in his belly, fill him up until he wonders if he could die from it, just this, right here, this peaking surge of pleasure just before he breaks, so tight and full, so pure and absolutely, fucking beautiful.
He’s so wet Sherlock can feel saliva dripping down the length of his shaft, and wonders how John is still breathing, is still making the sounds he is making against Sherlock’s skin, the sounds Sherlock can feel in his body, vibrating, making his cells sing.
John’s face does a myriad of things Sherlock doesn’t understand.  He looks pained. After a moment or two, he shakes his head, and lifts an arm to drape it over his eyes.
Sherlock can tell he’s thinking, that there are things he wants to say, and doesn’t know how, and it seems a foolhardy endeavour to try to broach such a conversation now, when they’re on a case and when neither of them can extricate themselves from the situation, should the conversation go—badly.
But John doesn’t work many cases with him these days, what with his determination to work regular hours at the surgery and a child to tend to and support.
He can feel John’s smooth, small knuckles graze his temple, the backs of his nails whisper over one cheekbone, and John’s nose presses against the hinge of his jaw as he slowly grows hard between them.
Sherlock leans over to shelter him with his body, strokes his hair, his face, smooth and clean-shaven now, and Sherlock realises it seems like lifetimes since he’s properly seen it.
He’s not hard, but he’s hot and full; a delicious, yielding weight against Sherlock’s leg, a heft and shape that suggests something much more impressive than any of Sherlock’s wildest fantasies given John’s height and build.
He’s waited two and a half years to go home, and finally there is nothing to deter him but the medical and clerical incompetency of her majesty’s government.
John is on his feet, staring down at him, and Sherlock pulls the plate of half-eaten food over his lap.
Though, If you can manage to behave yourself, there’s a rather substantial reward in it, so I hear.”
“What?  Love yourself?  Well, we all know that.”  John breathes into Sherlock’s curls with a chuckle.
“If you could do anything to me, anything at all, and I would be amenable, and there would be no guilt, no shame, what would you do?”
He loved the spontaneity, the way her antics always kept him on his toes, but he’d never quite known how to respond to playfulness.
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes again, making absolutely sure that Lestrade knows just how incredibly boring he’s being.
But John responds in kind, anyway, and before he knows it, they’re both surrounded in a flurry of churning water, and flailing hands.
She’s grinning, and there is the sound of some children’s show echoing into the foyer from the lounge, so it seems all is well.
John gives Mycroft a parting scowl, but does, as he says as he climbs out of the car, and heads for his flat.
Sherlock reaches up, and cards fingers through his hair, and John feels that, feels it move through his body, tingle over his skin, race through his veins, burst bright and full in his centre.
Dr. Carlton is grabbing him, and so he drops, just drops, dead weight to the floor, and he keens, and keens, and keens.
His eyes bite, and he swears to himself that he will not cry, no matter how hopelessly pathetic he is, no matter how overwhelming it all may be.
And to debase yourself so much that you are willing to pay for what you could quite easily procure anywhere.”
There are so many of Sherlock’s videos he hasn’t even gotten to yet, but he knows which one he’s going to pick, even before he clicks it.
“I was thinking that I would rather die there, with you, than keep living the way I had been: alone, hopeless, afraid.
She bought this cottage with the earnings from selling sensationalised accounts of our relationship to the press after the Magnussen affair.
A part of Sherlock wishes that his brother could see him here, now, sharing a bed with a beautiful man, wanted, valued.
“At the bottom of a waterfall, on the blood-stained sidewalk, on the floor of some blokes office, on the table in an operating theatre, in some foreign country where I’m not even there to…”
There is a small pink scar near the bottom of his sternum, and a light dusting of hair that makes John’s fingers twitch with longing.
Why should he be John’s rock and foundation if someone else will be the one who actually gets to build a life and a future upon it?
Desperately trying to win back some sense of purpose, when he’s simply a waste of space, now, and he knows it.
It’s been years, years since he’s felt anything like this, and all those decades ago, he had sworn that he would never let himself feel these sorts of things again.
John sets his tea down, walks over, and slides onto Sherlock’s lap, leaning back to press a line of kisses along his jaw.
“She’s responding, which is good.  Seems disoriented.  Not very talkative.  A bit agitated.  But her vitals are good, and the swelling seems to be abating.  She might have gotten really lucky.  Still, it’s going to be a bloody long, hard recovery, and you know Harry…”
He downs the whole thing, refills the glass, and then leans back against the counter and runs a hand over the stubble along his jaw.
He would have looked around himself before typing it, old habit, but he wouldn’t have been able to suppress that certain fond smile he gets, the one that makes Sherlock go warm all over, that makes him yearn, and ache.
The windows must be new, because he can hardly hear the wind outside, and it’s warm, despite the fact that it is obviously heated by a combination of
A young boy, in what appears to be school uniform, and behind him, nudging him upward, rather roughly, is Wilder.
And so John does, and chuckles a little when Sherlock catches him by the belt and pulls him back into the doorway of the kitchen, where Mrs. Hudson had predictably hung a sprig of mistletoe the day before.
There are the occasional, halting attempts at the sorts of deep conversations John imagines one is meant to have in a serious, committed relationship, the sort where you talk about feelings, and misunderstandings, and how to make things work better than they have.
John slams his head back against the pillow, with a grunt, and wonders how on earth he got so fucking lucky.
He wants her out of their hair almost as much as Sherlock does, and Sherlock thinks there is no way he could possibly love John more.
And that’s it, it’s the sounds John makes that always seem to short out his brain, and flip the switch to something so much more primal,
Though, if you are going to find yourself another wife at some point, I would prefer advanced warning.
Well on that night, while I was listening to your voice, while I was stroking myself, fast and desperate at first, and then slower when I decided I wanted to make it last, I decided I wanted to try that new thing I talked about, so I slicked my hand up, and I reached down, down, down behind my balls, and I found the spot.
And of course that still sometimes goes on today, your observations are accurate and apprehension is valid.
A week ago he would have at least gone through the motions of pretending he needed or wanted to go back, but tonight he hasn’t.
Sherlock pulls his head away from the toilet bowl, and there is John, squatting on the floor beside him.
They stand just inside the door and stare at one another in awkward silence until John’s cheeks start to pink and he looks away, strides away toward the kitchenette.
The train pulls into the station in York and Sherlock sighs, bone weary at the prospect of hiring a car, driving to Malton, and then trying to find a place to stay before he heads for the school.
It takes him a few minutes to figure out how to post as private with a link, and a few minutes more to load the video, due to its length.
A fresh wave of arousal washes over him at the memory, and he can’t help but wonder if John might let him return the favour.
Alone, and as ridiculously sentimental as it is, he misses John, John who is only one room away, but who feels unbearably distant given all that has transpired over the last week, and the import of the day.
John is lying atop him, elbow of his good arm propped on the mattress, his other hand stroking the hair away from Sherlock’s forehead, his erection flagging.
And somewhere through the white noise in his brain he can hear, can feel John murmuring against his hip.
Sherlock had always seemed so confident, so strange, so almost abrasive at times, that John had expected a harder face.
It’s late when they finally leave the restaurant, still reminiscing about cases past, still a little high on the light and companionable atmosphere the whole evening has seemed to hold.
#love confessions, #internalised homophobia, #mild past infant death reference, #post S3, #canon divergent.
John’s hand is on his face, and he turns into it, without thought, seeking out the warmth, and the scent, and the sensation.
By the time he checks out and makes his way back to the cafe, Sherlock and Rosie are already nearly finished with their mid-afternoon treat.
There is a scramble of wet limbs, John fumbling to turn off the water, Sherlock nearly tripping on his way out of the tub, and then they are both stumbling into the bedroom, naked, and dripping, and desperate.  John yanks the top drawer of the bedside table so hard, it ends up on the floor, but he finds the lube, and then Sherlock is crowding him up against the flocked wallpaper, right there beside the bed, and John fingers, slick and warm, are finding their way back where they belong, and this time, this time it’s perfect.
Sherlock lets his lips part, and just stares, the sort of stare that used to do things to John back in the old days, used to send his pulse racing, and his pupils dilating.
He’s learned so many things about Sherlock this year, both fascinating and irksome, which given his former track record in relationships, should mean that the shine is starting to wear off, but it’s not, and he doesn’t know quite what to do with that fact.
He grunts, and then moans long and loud, back arching off the mattress as he spills over his hand and chest.
Sherlock’s hands smooth down John’s back, and John settles firmly back into his body when Sherlock kneads his arse beneath hot palms, and dips down to kiss his neck.
It puts him in a foul mood before they’ve even begun, and then there is the issue with his hearing to battle on top of that.
When he gets there, Sherlock is flopped on his back in the middle of the bed, sides of his dressing gown flung wide like a pair of silken wings.
Sherlock sighs heavily, stretches out and pops out of the bed, stark naked, to go to the loo and get it himself.
He wants the helping hand with Rosie when he feels at his wits end, and he wants the large, warm hand sliding knowingly, comfortingly down the length of his spine on his bad days.
When they’re both snuggled back beneath the covers again, Sherlock twines his icy limbs around John’s warm ones, presses his cold toes against John’s calves, and earns himself a playful swat on the arse, and a bit of a tussle, that results in more kissing, before he finally pulls back and and stares at John in the dark.
He didn’t know John had taken it, and he looks impossibly young, a soft smile playing at the corners of his lips.
One particularly useful woman kindly informs him that Rosie’s mishap the day before had been down to a certain little boy in the class who’s known for such behaviour, a detail the nursery had declined to add when he’d picked her up.
(Oh… ) “Oh…  Sorry.”  The pads of John’s fingers rub gently against his scalp, and he can’t think.  His eyes slide shut.
He reaches down and inches his fingers between the throw pillow and his body, drags his palm slowly over the bulge beneath his pyjama bottoms.
Do you think that you could bear to come back to the house with us, tell us what you saw, how you found him.”
Sherlock doesn’t make a sound when he comes, only goes rigid in John’s arms, his fingers digging into the soft flesh on either side of John’s spine, head thrown back, cock pulsing against John’s thigh between two layers of clothing, and when the last wave of his release lets him go, he curls up, and goes completely still.
It comes out stronger than he anticipated, and John finally glances over his shoulder, brow furrowed.
It won’t lift overnight.  Sherlock will be in one of his moods for a few days more, at the very least, but hopefully he knows now.  Hopefully he knows that John was just as serious as Sherlock on that glorious, sunny morning in June, when they stood side-by-side in front of friends and family, and vowed to never be apart again, to never take one another for granted, to always lift the other up, to hold them up when they were slipping.
He drapes his clothes neatly over the sink, and hopes that the steam will help to air them out a little.
John shifts a little, and rubs the back of his neck, and Sherlock takes it all in in a glance, eyes narrowing.
John is in a talkative mood on the way home, and Sherlock sits back and enjoys listening to him ramble on about this, and that.
The room is growing lighter now, the muted, silver-grey of dawn, and John is looking at him, looking at him like he wants to unwrap him, to solve all the mysteries, deduce all the secrets, and then take him, vulnerable and raw, and keep him; pull him under his skin, shelter him beneath his ribs, mend together all the cracked and broken bits with little pieces of his own soul.
He’s tried, and he feels he’s doing better, being better, and if there is one thing he knows, it is this.
John lets out a high-pitched, nervous sounding laugh, and Sherlock steps forward, and looks down at him.
John blinks, his brows knitting for a moment, tongue darting out to moisten his lips before he speaks.
He keeps glaring down at his phone screen, willing it to light up, willing himself to stop being so fucking pathetic, willing Sherlock to be okay.
Sherlock does.  He looks small, and vulnerable for the briefest of moments, before his masks start to slide back into place, and isn’t that just the very last thing John wants to see happen.
She points to a page with a picture of a bee and the title: PHYLOGENIES AND THE HISTORY OF LIFE emblazoned on the top.
To share breath, to let your tongue slip between the seam of their lips, to enter them—that is something altogether different.
They draw stares, and Sherlock stands a little taller and a walks a little closer as they pass by a group women who don’t even attempt to disguise their appreciation.
John’s eyes slide shut, and he does it again, and again, and then lifts his fingers to use the blunt end of his nails.
His lips part like maybe he wants to say more, but they close again, mute, his eyes dropping down to his lap.
He stares down at Sherlock, and then reaches out and pushes his fingers into Sherlock’s curls, fisting his fingers around them in a delicious pull that makes Sherlock’s lips part in an inaudible sigh.
And still he strokes one hand, rhythmically over the opposite page, and John forgets to breathe, forgets everything but the sound of that voice, and the sight of that hand, stroking the heavy vellum pages like the skin of a lover.
John is even now across town, servicing another client, quite pre-occupied, and Sherlock would rather not think about it.
They let go, and with a flick of his wrist John sends the disk into the flames, and seals the door shut before fumes from the plastic can escape into the lounge.
He thinks about getting up and looking for his phone, but then Sherlock hums, and stirs, and he decides that staying right where he is, is the better choice.
Sherlock pulls him close, and John lets him, lets himself be held naked against Sherlock’s body, lets Sherlock stroke his back, and whisper into his hair.
He’d met Mrs. Hudson in the hall, and she had told him that John had eaten some soup, but refused his sandwich, that he’d seemed anxious and snappish after Sherlock had left, but that he did stay put, and keep his leg elevated, as instructed.
But if feels like taking a step down, expecting to find solid ground, and realising you miscalculated.
He asks, just to be sure, pitches his voice low, and tempting, and John’s fingers tighten in his hair, and his body arches upward, seeking Sherlock’s.
He gets up from the hearth, gathers up the lube and condoms from the top drawer of the bedside table, sets them on top, goes across to the loo and gets a flannel, comes back into the bedroom and gets the massage oil out of his bag, and then stands in the middle of the room, looking around for something, anything else he can put to rights, before—before…
Sherlock shoves the nearest officer out of the way to reach Lestrade’s side.  “What is it? Where is he?”
For a moment he thinks he may be having a heart attack.  His heart monitor lets out a series of frantic beeps, and John’s eyes flit to the screen, brows knit, mouth a tight line.  But then it passes, and he relaxes again.
He feels the now familiar warmth begin to curl tight in his belly, and decides he had best let his thoughts settle, or they will be right back to the point that had sent them both scrambling two times in a row already.
The cottage used to be the gatehouse of a larger estate, long since burnt to the ground.  But it’s big enough for the two of them, and when they finally get settled, John on the small, fraying sofa near the hearth, and Sherlock in a nearby chair, John catches his eye, and then laughs, actually laughs at the absurdity of it all, at the brash, reckless daring, and Sherlock can’t help but think that no matter the risk, it’s all been worth it to see him smile.  He would risk it all and more again, just to see his eyes sparkle, his cheeks pink, and to see the way all the tension of the last couple of weeks slowly seeps from his bones, and his shoulders drop, and his eyes search Sherlock’s warm, and fond, and just a little bit hungry.
No, I have never been in a relationship, or had sex, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t or wouldn’t, should the proper motivation arise.
He waits for John’s shout of release, before pumping a few more times, and coming himself, all over John’s belly.
He drinks his fill, tastes John’s neck, his shoulders, his chest, delights in the way John’s nipples peak beneath his eager tongue, how it draws a surprised gasp from John’s throat, and he wonders, for a moment, if any of his swiftly cycling sexual partners had ever taken the time to notice that his nipples were sensitive, that there was a spot behind his ear that could make him moan, that if you pressed firm circles against his hip bones he would arch up into your touch, his cock growing hard, straining for attention.
There is something he can’t quite peg in John’s manner, tone, in the way he treads soft and careful around the kitchen, barely making a sound, making himself small and silent.
John looks up at him, and he can see the guilt written all over him like an epitaph engraved in stone.
John is still too tired to really make any effort.  Everything is slow, and heavy, and warm, and Sherlock’s arousal is simmering low and steady, a perfect thing that pulls and aches just right, that he thinks maybe he could ride forever if he wanted to, floating between one state of consciousness and another, like when you half wake after a very late night out, and have nowhere to go, and so just choose stay there, drifting in and out.
“You’re lucky I love you so much,” called over his shoulder as he clatters down the steps to the first floor, and their bedroom.
I’m thinking about if it was your hands touching me, those gorgeous, long fingers, the way you would fill me.”
Sherlock looks over at him, but they’ve pulled out onto a busy thoroughfare, and John’s attention is wholly on the road.
John looks stunned, a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming lorry, frozen, waiting for the lethal strike.
He begs forces he doesn’t even believe in to let him die, just to let him die, because he can’t anymore.
Tea is finished, and Rosie is sitting on the lounge floor playing with her Duplo bricks, listening to Sherlock screech away distractedly on the violin when a cab finally pulls up outside the flat, and John emerges with arms full of shopping bags.
Mrs. Hudson’s lovely, but you know—I think she sort of feels like I need to be drinking broth through a straw.
Their bodies move together like waves on the sea, Sherlock’s voice always there, murmuring, a lulling hush.
His hands are still cold, and John hisses as Sherlock crawls between his legs, takes him by the hips, and pushes him closer to the headboard.
For all they have done, they still haven’t done that, and there is an intimacy to it, Sherlock thinks, that is something more than stroking another’s knee, their thigh, more than tracing the length of their spine, or burying your fingers in their hair, or even of growing hard against their body.
John glances over at him, at his pink cheeks, and the curls clinging damply to his pale forehead, and just shakes his head.
Sherlock swallows dryly.  Clever.  John is getting much too clever.  In the past he’d have kept this conjecture to himself, but now…  “Maybe.”
The toast is spread liberally with jam, and John brings in a mug for himself as well, crawls back onto the bed, and reads the morning paper, while Sherlock eats.
“Mmm.  Probably a wise decision, that.”  John agrees around a mouthful of food.  His mood is completely changed, and Sherlock suddenly realises that perhaps this was a conversation they should have had years ago, back when the Adler case had first ended.  “Maybe she just gets off on it; the thought of two blokes fucking.”
“I imagine you spent a restless night, formulating your approach, plans, which by early morning you were prepared to carry out. You set off for the Roundhay cottage, but not before filling your pocket with some red gravel that was lying beside your garden gate.”
John lies very still.  He doesn’t seem in any hurry to pull away, clean up, and move on with his evening, as he had the day before.  Sherlock holds him a little tighter, and hopes he hasn’t just made a horrible mistake.  He really hadn’t meant for it to go so far.  He’d hoped for a quick hand job in the shower, something to take the edge off, so he could take John back to the bedroom, tie him to the headboard, and give him what he desired.  Instead he’d gone to pieces.  They both had.
He wants to pull him close, breathe his air, taste his mouth, pull him up under his skin, his ribs, inside the echoing chambers of his heart until John beats and throbs in him like a sympathetic pulse.
I believe we will at least take a day or two to enjoy your quaint little village and perhaps hike the moors.
He looks down at the bulge of his half hard cock and momentarily considers keeping his pants on, and then remember’s he’s alone, in his own flat, and he’s being ridiculous.
When Sherlock’s tongue nudges tentatively at his entrance, his breath catches, and he stills even as his cock twitches in protest where it lies trapped between his belly and the mattress.
Sherlock repeats, hoping John will understand, that it is his presence he craves more than anything, hopes that John won’t guess the real reason for the request, that it is Sherlock’s presence John needs now, just the sound of his breath, and the warmth of his body, and the assurance that he is alive, and well, and safe.
John’s arm is around him, leading him over to the sofa, and there is another blanket from somewhere, and somehow they fit together on the narrow cushions, and John is covering them over, pulling him close, burying his nose in Sherlock’s hair, and pressing his lips to his scalp while his hands stroke the length of his bare back.
Sherlock gets up, stretches and strolls into the loo, turns the water on in the shower and stares at himself in the mirror.
Sherlock smears his mouth along John’s neck, down to the crook of his shoulder, sucks hard, and John moans and feels his cheeks flare at how wanton he sounds.
Sherlock knows he’s in trouble the minute he rounds the corner, oxfords skidding on wet pavement, and comes face-to-face with a large, meaty fist.
He glances over his shoulder.  John has propped himself up on his elbows.  “Can I ask you something?”
He thinks about how quickly John had come, and wonders what it must have felt like for him, to be filled at the moment he did.  Had it felt different? Had it intensified his pleasure? It’s something he might like to try for himself, he thinks, but perhaps they can save that for Mrs. Hudson’s outing next week.
Sherlock’s thighs are shaking with exertion, and John can feel the way his body is resisting. John grins.
Sherlock is slightly embarrassed by how much it is affecting him, how soothing and yet paralysing it is.
Sherlock makes a small sound at the back of throat, brings his bound hands down from over his head, like he wants to touch his cock, and then seems to catch himself and puts them back.
Sherlock holds his gaze a moment more, and then blinks once and heads for the bedroom door, snatching his dressing gown from off the floor in the process.
And then it’s several minutes of him pouring over Yelp and Google maps, looking for something local, and punctuating each broken link, or one star review with a staccato of profanity.
Sherlock just stands blinking at the madness, while Rosie squeals to be let down and get back in the fun, and John decides to take pity on him, sidles up beside him, taking Rosie’s hand in his, and starts to sing along with the lyrics.
They turn into the gravel drive, and Sherlock stops to open the gate to the back garden for John, before turning and pulling him into another kiss.
He’s drenched in sweat, and making so much noise he’s sure he’ll get them evicted in the morning, when Sherlock starts to plunge his tongue a little deeper on each upward curl of John’s hips, and John whines in surprise, and starts to fuck the mattress frantically, the pleasure building, and building, curling tight in his belly, curling his toes, drawing his balls up, up, up, until it explodes inside him, and he moans loud and long, comes, and comes all over the sheets, and realises that Sherlock has pulled out, has his cheek resting against John’s arse, and is thrusting against the bed himself.
He’s taking his time, sitting with it, truly considering his answer, and it makes something warm bloom in Sherlock’s chest, something almost like hope.
His voice is deep and firm when he speaks, but the fondness John has come to recognise and love is still telegraphing from his eyes.
Sherlock huffs, and then sets off across the garden toward the hives, leaving a trail of footprints behind him.
Rosie’s off investigating the pile of wrapped presents in the corner, now, and John comes up behind Sherlock and rests his chin on his shoulder, handing him a cup of coffee as they watch and ensure Rosie doesn’t decide to dig into the gifts early.
They have almost an hour’s drive to Malton, and Sherlock suddenly realises that unless he plans to sleep, he and John will be stuck in a car together all that time, with nothing else to do but talk.
Sherlock turns and pretends to busy himself with something at the sink, listening as Mrs. Hudson descends the stairs.
He should know better than to expect his ill-timed and impromptu love confession to be met with something equally sentimental and spontaneous.
And then Sherlock’s mouth is on his, a gorgeous contrast of hot and wet in the cold around them, and John moans into the kiss, only then realising how keyed up he his, how alive he feels, adrenaline racing through his veins, the crackle of combat singing through his cells, and the heady, commanding, safe weight of Sherlock’s body bearing down on his.
And it sits on their shoulders, making their steps a little slower, their hair a little greyer, their vision a little blurry around the edges.
He knows what (or rather who) he is looking for long before he opens the door and comes face-to-face with him.
You’ve been on the run all week, and if I didn’t know better I’d think you hadn’t slept or ate since Monday.”
He smiles when he finds exactly what he was hoping for, and then returns to the room, trying to ignore Tregennis’ corpse in the corner, which can offer him nothing more until an autopsy.
Through the haze of his own pleasure he is only vaguely aware of Sherlock’s hips stuttering, and then snapping forward as he cries John’s name, every muscle in his body taught, his grip on John’s hips tight enough to bruise.
So far we haven’t lost electricity, and if we do we have the stove, and the fireplace in the bedroom, and the cooking is gas.
Without a conscious thought, Sherlock drops to his knees on the cold tile, wraps his arms around John’s legs, and presses his face against his body.
limestone floors polished smooth with a century and a half’s foot traffic, polished oak-panelled walls, the long line of portraits of headmasters-past getting more and more modern in style the closer they get to the headmaster’s office.
He looks down at their joined fingers and has to fight the bite he feels in the corners of his eyes.
When their entrée is finished, John asks for the dessert menu, and orders something rich and chocolate, something Sherlock knows he doesn’t prefer, but which is Sherlock’s favourite, and even though he’s already full, Sherlock does his best to eat his half, more touched than he has words to express.
It’s supposed to get up in the mid twenties this afternoon, and here you are plodding around the back country in a full suit and wool coat.”
Sherlock sighs, and shrugs out of his t-shirt, before scooping the shirt that goes to his costume up off the bed.
But there are other things, things they’ve already done that were perfect, wonderful, and he would love to do again.
Sherlock’s hands are still cupped around John’s arse, and he squeezes hard, without thinking, and then moans when John tightens around him, feels almost like he might pull him deeper still, which is impossible at this point, quite impossible.
John sighs, and rolls his shoulders to stretch out some of the tension, and then turns when he reaches the first step up to their flat, takes the lapels of Sherlock’s coat in hand and pulls him into a slow, deep kiss.
The flat is freezing, so he dresses in layers, before shuffling into the kitchenette to make breakfast.
John kneels down beside the corpse, despite the smell, and the constantly hovering crows, and squints at the man’s neck.
It doesn’t take them long to track down the headmaster, who somewhat begrudgingly agrees to show them to Arthur’s room.
He’s not really getting the friction he needs like this, and so John figures he should help him along.
There is a long stretch of silence, so long that Sherlock’s curiosity finally gets the better of him, and he peeks over his shoulder.
Sherlock stares down at the top of John’s head, the way in fits so perfectly into the cup of his hand, the way John rests beneath it, without even realising.
And now here they are, and he’s terrified, and it’s stupid, and childish, and he has no idea how to go about making it right, because he has no idea how to—be, what he thinks John is asking him to be.
He lets out the giggle Sherlock is swiftly coming to love and shakes his head. “Maybe shouldn’t keep them where food is, though.”
He’s getting properly hard now, and he has to fight the urge to take himself in hand and just finish it, because, Christ, but it wouldn’t take long, and…
Still Sherlock sits, still he holds John’s hand, and John lets him, because it’s warm, and right, and feels so safe he suddenly realises he never wants him to let go.
It’s been a long day, and perhaps some of these things would be better discussed when we’re both less tired, or with Ella?”
He aches at the memory of it, at the realisation that it is something he may never experience again.
He unclips his seatbelt and lays down on the warm leather, turns his back to his brother, and drifts into a fitful sleep in which he dreams of London—the wet streets, the distant, late night hum of traffic, the thick walls of Baker Street insulating him and John from the dangers of the world outside.
Her reason being that she felt that she was a danger to me, that her background might—mar my political career, that my acquaintance with her, my love for her, might ruin me.”
He knows that it is difficult for John, and the fact that he sits quietly, and submits to it, no tension in his body at all, feels significant.
John stares down at Sherlock’s cock gliding against his palm, and his mouth waters as a bead of precome gathers at the head, and wells up to run down his shaft, mingle with the saliva there.
And then Sherlock is dropping to his knees on the stone floor, and pressing his face to the front of John’s trousers, and John’s knees buckle.
He only feels marginally better afterwards, but he supposes he should just be grateful all worked as it should, as that has (frustratingly) not always been the case since he got back to London.
It was Sherlock who had broken that ice first, when he had asked nervously, one night, cheeks flaming, if John would touch him, and when John had responded with his usual flirtatious banter, Sherlock’s cheeks had flamed brighter still, and he had shaken his head, and replied in less than a whisper.
I had my doubts about sending Arthur there after all that nonsense that came out a few years back, but Huxtable always seemed so…”
Perhaps it’s the memories attached, the summer spent in the hospital after his dog died, the school insisting on special classes when he got out, Mummy pulling him out to have him tutored instead, her disappointment in him when he turned out to be merely clever, to have no exceptional talents at all, and yet still had all the
I only meant that you get stiff when you sit about too long, and you’re better when you get more exercise.
But this—this arousal brought on by something other than autonomic response, as the result of sentiment, attachment, and the mental replay of emotional and physical stimuli, this is something he has not experienced in a very long time.
He moans in relief, arches his back up off the mattress, and is met with the hot, tight plane of Sherlock’s abdomen, the welcome weight of his body, the still hard line of his cock.
His muscles are still stiff and sore from their dash down back alleys and over fences the night before.
Something behind John’s eyes shifts from rage to fear, and for a moment Sherlock considers stopping, but they’ve been teasing the edges of this thing, whatever it is, ever since John moved back in, and they can’t keep going on this way.  It’s a dangerous game they play with one another. It’s always been. That will likely never change, that toying the edges, walking the razor fine edge between healing and utter obliteration. Best to press on.
Just hums.  “Yeah?  Cause I’ve been thinking about it, thinking about what you tasted like when you came, thinking about how I want to feel you come again, come all over me.”
He pulls out the Crosby, just as Sherlock returns with the turntable and a small set of speakers and sets them down on the coffee table.
John lets his arm slide away from his eyes to rest on the pillow behind his head.  He looks scared, Sherlock thinks. But if there is one thing he knows about John it’s that he’s brave as well, and if he wants this, really wants it, then…
It doesn’t take long with that voice in his ear, the phantom sensation of Sherlock’s hands on his body, each whisper of fingers over paper echos against his skin, each susurrus of fleece like fingers ghosting through his hair.
“This is what I’ve dreamed of doing,” John murmurs and presses another kiss a little higher up the inside of his thigh.
It shoots pleasure straight to John’s core, and he knows he should still, or he’s going to be at the brink again in a minute, but he’s all hunger and need now.
“Tenderness, gentleness, vulnerability, those things are different, unfamiliar, and perhaps somewhat terrifying, perhaps especially with men.
Sherlock’s hand presses, down, down, holds him under, and John looks up at him from the rippling depths, confusion, betrayal, terror.
He leaves a prescription for antibiotics and the sedative and instructions for it to be filled immediately.
Sherlock nabs a small piece of chicken off the plate and pops it into his mouth, before delicately sucking the chicken fat from the tips of his fingers.
He looks over at his phone still propped up behind his laptop, video still waiting to be deleted or sent.
Please note that this chapter really earns it's explicit rating.  See the added tags below.  Also, if explicit stuff isn't your cup of tea, I think you can read just past the opening of the Christmas Crackers and still be safe.  There's sort of an important happening in this chapter, you probably don't want to miss, and the first half of the chapter is SFW.
The owner, who knows Sherlock, owes Sherlock for clearing him of a murder charge apparently, is gregarious, generous, and filled with praise for Sherlock, which pleases him, John can tell, even if Sherlock is obviously doing his best to play it cool.
John crashes into Sherlock with a decade’s worth of pent up want, nothing but rough, frantic, almost violent thrusts and grinds, moans and bites, fingers knotted in curls, mouthes, and lips, and tongues crashing together so fiercely John tastes blood.
I just—I wanted to say it, because if I went my whole life and never did, I—I don’t think I could have lived with that, and I don’t want regrets in the end.”
“A lot has happened since then,” Sherlock reminds him.  “And if you want this. If we do this. Things won’t be like they were.”
John is honestly astounded at his own courage, and something in the back of his head tells him not to rush this, to take it slow.
And suddenly he realises that the voice is outside rather than inside his head, and is calling his name, here in the middle of London where he knows no one.
But John just shakes his head.  “Unless it’s you who doesn’t want to do this, which is fine, by the way, let’s not talk about this, okay.”
John moves like he’s going to bolt, but then seems to decide against it, and turns back, eyes wide and desperate.
Somehow he can feel each stroke of the page like it’s a stroke against his own skin, and he doesn’t understand it at all, but who fucking cares!
However, if something exceedingly dear to him was used as a lure, it is possible that he would forget common sense.
You were the one thing I never thought I would have, and so had convinced myself I didn’t want at all.
The man’s suggestive tone is equal parts infuriating and intoxicating, and John tries not to think about what his response to it might mean.
After a few overnight sessions, I figured that holding someone while they slept was something I could do just as well as anyone else.
Also, a big thanks to @SherlockSister1 for the Brit-picking, and, as always, to @astudyinsnoggy for the SPaG beta and general cheerleading.
Had to go to Baker Street today, to the Lost Property office, because like an idiot I forgot my cane on the bus yesterday.
Normally he would fear the coming of day, fear that it would mean John getting up, going, returning to his tiny, spare flat, his clients.
John’s face is doing a million things at once, none of which Sherlock can seem to interpret (frustratingly enough).
John frowns.  “No.  No.  Just because…  That doesn’t necessarily mean….  There was Janine.  Irene Adler.”
John steps forward, reaches for Sherlock’s belt, and Sherlock nods in assent, feels a race of anticipation and slight anxiety, as John looses it, pulls it free, tosses it on the floor and then undoes the flies of his trousers and pushes them down over his hips.
sheets still rumpled and hastily thrown back, the slight dent in the pillow where John’s head had been resting.
Sherlock presses a finger against one of the buttons, a mirror of John’s actions the first time he’d touched Sherlock in this way.
Disappointingly, the kitchen is empty when Sherlock finally manages to shuffle out in a pair of ratty pyjama’s and a dressing gown hastily tossed over his shoulders.
When they get back to the school, classes are still in, and so they are undisturbed as they make their way to their room.
“Ro’s likely to be in high dudgeon because she has to go without us twice in one day, but that’ll be the minder’s problem.
It’s hypnotic really, and it keeps that ember burning low, and deep, and makes John sleepy and pliant from more than just the wine.
His mouth is hot, and wet, and tight, and it’s the best thing he’s ever felt, nothing at all like anything he’s ever been able to do for himself, and he’s wanted this for so long, and with such intensity that he realises the moment John takes him in hand, and hollows his cheeks that there is no way he’s going to last.
The shorts are certainly John’s but they have an elastic waist, and fit Sherlock just fine, much to his surprise.
“So I guess this video is just meant to be a thanks, and of course well wishes for a speedy recovery, and I’m not sure if I’ll do any more of these, but…
Sherlock stretches out dramatically and then curls tight into a little ball, but one eye cracks open.
Suddenly Sherlock shifts his weight, flipping them both, dislodging John’s fingers, and leaving him blink up in surprise.
John lets the needle fall away from his arm.  “And I love you, which is why you need to bloody well learn to love yourself.”
He gives over to it with wild abandon, rutting against the sheets, and impaling himself on Sherlock’s hot and eager tongue, all the while trying with every ounce of his strength to hold back, because it’s the best thing he’s ever felt, and he wants to make it last.
He sucks in a breath, and then huffs it out again as Sherlock gives his cock a long, languorous pull.
He lets go of Sherlock’s cock, and grabs onto his hips, and starts to drive up into him hard, with nothing but a mind to chase his own pleasure.
Sherlock’s brain is working overtime to file away all the sensations flooding his body at once, and is grateful beyond words that John doesn’t seem insistent on keeping up a conversation, because he’s not sure he could process this and talk at the same time, even if he wanted to.
Sherlock looks down at his large, trembling hands clasped in John’s small, capable ones, tucked up against his heart, and he realises this is John asking, John telling him he wants this thing they’ve started, he wants it to continue for as long as it can.
He pulls John as close as he can, and cups his head in his hands, and mirrors everything that John has done (
“You never having been with someone, was that because of lack of opportunity, or because you weren’t interested.”
He pushes the desk chair in, and has just begun his fight with the sticky desk drawer, when he hears a click and a pile of old, faded envelops tumble into the middle of it.
Sherlock’s hips roll and he pulls himself closer, close enough that John can feel the hard, twitching length of him press against his belly.
He breathes through it, tries to fight the lump in his throat, and the bite at the corner of his eyes, and gives up after a while, because if he can’t be this way with Sherlock in this moment, then what’s the bloody point of any of it.
They follow the man back down the long corridor from the headmaster’s office, through the foyer, up the great stone staircase, through the second floor gallery, and then turn down a narrower corridor with several rows of doors.
The ‘I love you’s change to ‘perfect’, over and over, and then other encouragements and endearments that John simply loses track of because he feels as though somewhere in the process he’s been lured and lulled into some sort of hypnotic state, a place where there is nothing but Sherlock’s voice, and the gentle, repetitive touch of his hand.
“Told me what?”  Sherlock snaps. He’s exhausted at being talked about rather than to, and now Greg and his brother are looking at one another as though they are having some sort of private conversation he isn’t privy to, and it’s driving him mad.
John stares down at the cup of coffee in his hand, the one he’s barely touched, and then shrugs, sets it down on the table, and gets to his feet.
He presses his face deeper into the down, mouth slightly open, breathing in all the microscopic scraps of John: hair, skin cells, sebum, like maybe it will calm him somehow, satisfy the ache to take pieces of John inside his own body to mesh and meld with his.
“Well,” he says after a few moment of silence, during which John lets his eyes slide shut and just tries to relax.
He does as he’s told, without hesitation, crawls onto the mattress and lies down beside Sherlock rather than on top of him.
Sherlock pulls back grabs John by the hips, and pushes him up toward the headboard, and then leans down, grabs his bound wrists, and ties them to it.
Sherlock pouring water back and fourth between two beakers, dripping it from a pipette into a bowl, boiling it in a florence flask over a bunsen burner.
Sherlock watches John dash into the restaurant, admires the way his new trousers cling to his bum and thighs, and then catches and wills himself to behave.
Sherlock glances down at John’s cock as it throbs beneath his chin, and then reaches up to grind his palm against it.
He jerks his chin toward it, when Sherlock looks to offer it to one of their guests, and Sherlock cocks a brow but obediently sits where he’s bade.
Sherlock tells himself he’s playing for John, but he quite loses himself in the music for awhile, in Tchaikovsky’s 6th, the 4th movement especially, and as the last, low, sad strains reverberate from the instrument he realises that the flat around him has gone completely still.
Good, Sherlock thinks.  Good. He should be. This whole thing is his fault.  If he’d just allowed Sherlock to finish up his case with Adler none of this would be happening.
“I don’t know how to say it, how I can ever make it clear enough that you were my first choice, from the very first moment we met, the second I walked into that lab with Mike, and looked over at you standing in front of that microscope, trying to pretend you weren't interested, from that very first glimpse, all I could see was you, all I wanted was to be with you, all the time, every minute of every day, but I didn’t know how to…”
The hit is strong, exactly what he needed, and he does hail a cab after that, heads straight home in the grey dawn, praying that he can ride the high long enough to track down another case of interest in his inbox.
John kisses him back, small sips from his lips, hand sliding down Sherlock’s flank to cradle the rise of his arse as well.
And Sherlock knows what he would like.  No. Not like. Need. A burning, yearning, all-consuming need, like desperate thirst, like starvation.  He needs more. He needs to be deeper. He needs all of John, everything he can give, and he needs it now.
“Weren’t we supposed to do that at the beginning of the meal so I would have to suffer through its entirety wearing a one of those ridiculous paper crowns?”
Sherlock pulls his coat closed, and then lifts a gloved hand to his mouth in an attempt to hide a cough.
John Watson is clearly remarkable—in all things, and Sherlock has no idea how he has managed to get so lucky.
Sherlock starts to shrug out of his coat and jacket as the trail ascends a small hill, and John smiles at the line of sweat soaking through the fine, white, silk-cotton blend of his shirt.
Greg looks over his shoulder at him, and then points down at the map on the screen.  “We found the car Adler picked him up in. It was abandoned near the river in Dagenham.  There’s a bunch of empty warehouses down there, so we think…”
Sherlock can feel himself drifting, his brain shifting into that slightly detached state he can usually only achieve with drugs.  It’s fascinating that it should happen now, between them like this. It never has before. He tries not to cling to it, or to notice it too much.  He lets himself drift deeper with each whisper of John’s fingers, press of his lips, whisper or sigh against his neck, his ear, his chest.
Sherlock unpacks the food, listens to John chat with Rosie, the way she does her best to form a picture of her day with her swiftly emerging vocabulary, the way that John listens, patiently responds.
He waits for it to warm, lays on top of the covers, and closes his eyes, listens to Sherlock’s voice, and thrusts up into the cold air, denying himself, waiting until he’s so desperate for touch he thinks it might kill him.
John’s back is cold against the warmth of Sherlock’s chest, and the tension he can feel in John’s body as he first draws him in dissolves almost immediately with a deep sigh, like it’s a relief to finally be like this together, skin-to-skin, pulse-to-pulse.
Because they’ve been teetering on the brink of this thing for years, and it had become painfully obvious over the last few months that they were at a tipping point.
He hopes that the seriousness, the fondness of his tone is clear, that John knows that ‘a great deal more’ means: family, companion, anchor,
He snorts and shakes his head, but Sherlock thinks he sees the corner of his mouth twitch upward for a moment, before he represses it again.
John files that away for future reference, wonders if maybe that’s part of the aversion to sex, too much sensory input at once equals ‘not good’?
He sucks in a breath through his nose, and shifts his hips a little, tries to ignore the way his own body responds to the memory.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open, and his mouth opens and closes, opens and closes, like he can’t get enough air, like there aren’t words for what is about to take him, and for one brief moment he looks desperately afraid, until John tilts in, brushes their lips together, tastes Sherlock’s panting breath against his tongue and whispers, “I’ve got you.
She looks up as Sherlock comes in the door behind them, carrying John’s small overnight bag they’d hurriedly fetched from his flat before coming over.
They were teetering on the brink of it before Sherlock had stupidly found his courage, and now it’s more sure than ever.
John blinks, and looks down at Sherlock kneeling between his legs, and then at his bloody, poorly packed palms.
“Of course I wish you might have been spared the lot of it, but I imagine that would mean we never would have met, and I can’t bear to think of a universe in which that is a possibility.”
He can feel the surge of adrenaline race through his veins, and must give some tell, because Sherlock’s head snaps up, and he looks at him, looks at his hand in the envelope, meets his eyes again, and blanches.
He’s forty-five years old, and he wonders if he’s ever really had sex a day in his life, he wonders how, and why now, and who fucking cares because Christ Jesus in heaven he wants to come, and Sherlock won’t let him, and he’s so fucking grateful he could cry.
Sherlock’s lips ghost against John’s scalp, his hand returns to his back, pulls him a little closer.
Of course, there is no way of knowing, because the substance, no matter what it is, is nowhere to be found.
This morning they had awoken to stiff necks, and sore backs, and had lazed about reading in front of the fire for hours, before bundling up and poking about the back garden.
And he wonders if it’s Santa Claus himself, because he has no idea who else would come out in such weather, and it would only be with a sled and reindeer that anyone could traverse the mess of the roads.
It’s a spectacular waste of time, but Sherlock finds he can’t bring himself to rush when John is looking so utterly relaxed; even, dare he say, happy.
breathes in, rubs his cheek along the side of his head and breathes out against the shell of his ear.
Sherlock feels this perfection in his own body like a sweet heat and in his heart like a safe harbour.
John stares at the dark smudges beneath Sherlock’s eyes, at the slight trembling in his fingers, and the way his hair lays matted and limp against his scalp.
It makes Sherlock’s breath catch in his throat and his lips pop open in a small inhalation of surprise.
Sherlock rocks up into John’s hand again, an unspoken plea, and John seems to have just enough presence of mind left to understand.
John glances over at him, brow furrowed, and looks quickly back at the road as they come to a tight curve.
John takes another sip of wine, the last in the glass, and then puts it down and runs a hand down his thigh.
And there is guilt attached, because he also favours his leg at times, something else he seems to work hard to hide, but isn’t as successful at.
Sherlock feels a sort of calm satisfaction, that he has managed to be something of value to John, that he has done his best by him, and it has helped.  Clearly it was the right decision to disappear. He begins to think about returning to London, but that is a decision that is up to John, and he isn’t quite sure how to broach it.
“Which were accurate, and which worked, and which would have ensured a prolonged and enjoyable evening if not for your meddling.”
He craves it for one brief moment, the feeling of John’s fists on his his face, the feeling of his shoes against his ribs, the rare and wonderfully intimate sensation of being murdered at the hand of an unwilling lover.
He does his best to tame his damp curls with his fingers, gives his mouth a rinse with the mouthwash on the counter by the sink, and then makes his way back out to the lounge, the clothes he came with draped over his arm.
John struggles again, and this time Sherlock pulls the ties he has around his wrist tight, so tight it actually hurts, and John blinks.
It’s gentle, the way Sherlock gets around him when he senses he’s about to break, and sometimes it floods John with rage, that carefulness, rage over the fact that Sherlock has to be on tenter hooks around him, or that he feels John is some delicate thing that might break with the slightest of breaths.
John feels a momentary twinge of fondness, a fondness he’s been allowing himself to indulge in more and more, of late.
The room is cold, and bleak save for the golden warmth of the flames in the hearth, and the comforting heat of the mug cupped in his hands.
In the beginning it was a big part of the attraction, until that day at Barts, until it hurt too much to be seen so clearly, and abandoned anyway, and all John wanted to do was hide.
He avoids his cock, but it’s close enough to be an aching tease, and he sees Sherlock subconsciously rock his hips upward, seeking more touch.
They have started to weigh him down, each one sucking a little of the life he has left with unruly, unbearable regret.
Sherlock is struck speechless, and then John is kissing him again, with a depth, and a tenderness he never has before, and Sherlock forgets everything else for a long time.
Leona looks back and forth between them, as though trying to gauge their sincerity, and then gets to her feet.
And so Sherlock does, and John thrusts forward seeking out the sensation, and then groans when it causes Sherlock’s fingers to pull halfway out, and pushes back again, and Sherlock realises, in one wild and wonderful moment, that he has John strung perfectly between two battling sensations this way, and it’s beautiful the way it’s making John pant, and keen, and move stuttering and hungry, the hand around Sherlock’s cock losing all coordination, as John is hit again, full force, with a surging flood of desperate desire, walking a microcosm of the tightrope he has balanced precariously on for years, the desire to pull away, in tenuous, torturous balance with the need to press in, press closer.
Sherlock gets a mobile signal halfway back, and calls the police to report Hayes’ escape and have an ambulance dispatched to pick up Wilder’s body.
He wonders, now, if he should have warned John more, discussed it with him, not done this thing on a whim after his accident a week prior.
John’s head snaps up, and his face does a million things before settling into a smirk that seems to suggest he is not at all averse to the idea.
The most recent one was posted a week prior, and from the thumbnail it looks like it’s just SensoryScience stroking a pillow.
He bites into the apple, rinses it down with a mouthful of tea, before rubbing a palm down the top of his thigh to work out some of the tension.
John appears a moment later with a cup of coffee and plate of bread and jam with a couple of slices of cheese tucked along side, and pushes them onto the tea table beside Sherlock’s chair.
John doesn’t say anything in reply, but Sherlock can see him looking at him as he hurries through the gallery and down the corridor to their room.
Sherlock says without turning around, and John does, reaches down to palm himself through his trousers.
And when the radiator knocks to life, and the sounds of Mrs. Hudson’s television drifts tinny and muffled from downstairs, it suddenly hits Sherlock full force that he he’s home.
Whenever he thought he might have found a friend, there was his brother with an open billfold, and an offer, and…
He could certainly provide one, but it isn’t required with John, and it speaks to John’s renewed trust.
Sherlock can’t help the twitch of a smile that teases at the corner of his mouth, and he hears John chuckle low, and fond.
It catches, and he squats, leans over even more to blow gently at the crackling paper and wood chips, the seat of his trousers straining, forearms flexing as he reaches over and grabs a couple of small logs, sets them carefully in place.
They all pause, and then a few seconds after the last of the clattering dissolves into silence, the distant voice of a child echoes in the darkness.
If any of you know affordable flats on the outskirts, zone 4 or 5, or someone who’s looking for a flat share, let me know.
John tries to think about the things his superstitious nanna used to tell him, bread for grounding, a bath with salts, firm, steady human touch from someone you trust, someone who’s solid and true.
“Well, I look forward to hearing more about your job, and how things go with the new living arrangement.
And he very much tries not to think about how it had felt to see all that trust shatter in an instant, and over something Sherlock still can’t fully understand.
John reaches over his waist, finds the lube and slicks his cock, and hand, before pulling Sherlock back against him, and letting his cock slide deep in his cleft.
He sees Sherlock’s whole body tense for the briefest of moments, before John’s voice registers as John’s, and then he relaxes again, the corners of his mouth twitching.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches upward in a fond smile before he turns his attention back to the road ahead.
John rubs Sherlock’s right foot between both his hands, and gives it a squeeze before setting it back on the floor again, and getting to his feet.
He had imagined a carefully arranged evening, a little candlelight, a little conversation, or perhaps a spectacular case, the thrill, the adrenaline of it racing through their veins.
A smile teases the corner of John’s lips, and he laughs outright when he sees Sherlock roll his eyes with a slight flush to his cheeks that probably has nothing to do with the warmth of the pub.
Sherlock’s nose wrinkles, and he makes a contented hum at the back of his throat, stirring, frowning, stilling.  His eyes finally pop open.  He blinks, disoriented for moment, before his eyes focus.  “John?”
The tears that had been threatening spill over as Sherlock huffs a small, incredulous smile.  “Do you?”
But even so, it’s been a valiant attempt, and he still looks striking, his hair brilliant silver in the bright afternoon light.
His knees buckle, and he lets out a sound like a wounded animal, a sound that stops Sherlock’s heart in his chest for a moment, and then sends a rush of adrenaline spiking through his veins.
John does without questioning, and wonders why, a moment later, when Sherlock carefully parts his cheeks, and begins to delicately clean there as well.
John sits up, and props his leg on the coffee table, and Sherlock spreads out their meal on the space that’s left.
If Jack’s returned to the house and his father hasn’t returned from town, he shouldn’t be alone with his step-mother, or the baby.”
“You’ll chafe this way,” Sherlock informs him, like maybe John’s changing a tyre for the first time, and Sherlock’s telling him not to tighten the lug nuts too tight.
He watches the man stroke a hand over the woman’s hair, watches the way she stares up into his eyes with a look not unlike the one Redbeard used to turn on him when he would scratch behind his ears.
It’s raining, and they’re lying in bed with the window cracked just enough to let in a little cool, and the blankets are pulled up over them like a cocoon, and their foreheads are pressed together in the close dark.
It crashes over him with enough force that his knees buckle, and he falls forward on the table, feels the warmth of his come spread out over the soft fibres of the blanket beneath him, while John holds his tongue just inside his entrance and whines at the sensation of Sherlock’s muscles pulsing around him, drawing him in deeper.
Sherlock wonders if he should try to distract her, if it’s going to be one of those sorts of post-therapy evenings, but John just smiles, and scoops her up, and lets her tell him all about the ant pile they found by the bins, and helping Mrs. Hudson dust her furniture, and decorating sugar biscuits, and Sherlock silently mouths a thank-you to Mrs. Hudson as they make their way upstairs.
The kitchens are a mad bustle, but one of the members of the staff proves sympathetic, and puts together two plates on a tray for him, and so it is that he gets to wake John with the enticing scent of a full English breakfast, and fresh-brewed coffee, and enjoy the bleary-eyed confusion that gives way to surprised pleasure.
He reaches up and pushes against Sherlock’s chest with his free hand, and Sherlock sits back with a shiver, as John dips his hands inside Sherlock’s pants and draws him out.
Though this chapter is a bit rough in spots, if you know me and my writing, you know this is heading toward lots of love and healing.  Always that.  Promise.
He twitches against his palm, leans back in his chair with a low moan, and begins to stroke in time with Sherlock’s strokes, thinks he can feel it, his own hand feeling detached, not his, could be Sherlock’s, could be…
I mean some of it was in email and chat before we met face-to-face, but I’ve alluded to it since, especially after he told me some of his worst.
Sherlock can hear the tightness in his voice, that jealousy that still plagues him after all this time.
Sherlock gently prises John’s hand from his wrist, looks down at him, small, and terrified, and coming apart at the seams.
Sherlock lets out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding, and then sucks in another, sharply, on it’s heel, as a stab of pain bursts in his chest and radiates, muscle deep, all the way through to his back.
“I’ll let you in on all the secrets, and I’ll stick close during the party, and if you want to invent some case in the middle to duck out, I’m not going to stop you.
Sherlock vows to keep his promise, to take more care, no matter how much it goes against his natural inclinations and instincts.
Sherlock’s instinct it to stride forward, reach out, and—and keep him, keep him close, keep him warm.
Small oval nipples, the shoulder wound, with the point of entry being at the front of the shoulder, and the exit at the back (it’s possible he was looking at whoever shot him).
He pulls John a little closer to the headboard, easing a little of the pull, and then settles back down on his thighs, just enough to pin them down, but not close enough for John to be able to rub up against him.
Sherlock sits up, gazes up the stairs.  John has been down twice to use the bathroom, on one of those occasions he had grabbed a glass of water and a sandwich, but he hadn’t acknowledged Sherlock at all.  It’s been almost 24 hours.
John reaches up and wipes at his damp forehead and cheeks, stares down at his shaking hands, and then looks back up at Sherlock.
He feels light-headed at the sensation of John’s body surrounding him, clenching tight around his fingers.
The silence of the flat at night gets inside him, crawls under his skin like a swarm of cockroaches, itching, itching, until he has to do something, anything, to chase it away.
John suddenly feels lonely, a great, gaping chasm that swallows up everything good, and leaves him feeling small and useless, broken and wrong.
John doesn’t know why, but there is something about this confession, tagged on the end of a seemingly unending list of facts, and delivered with a sort of soft shyness he would have never previously thought Sherlock capable of, that reaches him more than any former confessions.
When he looks up, to his chagrin, he can see that Sherlock has stopped to study some truly ugly jumpers, something he knows John would never wear, and John suspects he’s doing it on purpose.
John’s hands are warm against his hips, his fingers hook beneath the waistband of Sherlock pants, and slide downward.
His cock has started to take an interest, and John glares down at it, as though it’s betrayed him, as though he doesn’t want this, isn’t teasing this to the surface purposefully.
They sit on a bench near the zoo’s playground, and eat it, and once Rosie is finished, John wipes her clean, and lets her run off to play on the equipment.
Sherlock turns to look at him again, and John meets his gaze for only a moment before turning his attention back to the sea with a tight sniff.
Sherlock’s heart is racing like a small, frightened bird, and John worries sometimes, when they are together, when they are intimate, if Sherlock’s heart really should be undergoing so much stress and strain.
What in Christ’s name was any of it for, if this is how it ends—with a kidnapping, a kiss, and bit of fooling around on the phone?
The wind isn’t quite so severe, but he has no idea how Sherlock thinks he’s going to get into town, or who would be there to meet him if he did.
He gets up and goes to the window, parts the lace curtain with one finger and stares out across the dead lawn.
Did you for one minute think he wouldn’t feel the need to stand up, to prove himself a man when given half the chance?!”
“And we are both standing in the middle of posh hotel room about to do, I assume, quite unspeakable things to one another, so probably a touch kinky as well.
John looks down at the small box Sherlock has just laid on the arm of his chair, and then up to meet the eyes that refuse to meet his.
And now he’s out of words, and he’s left sitting awkwardly on the edge of the toilet, staring down at his hands (that are no longer shaking).
They sit in absolute silence, save for the sound of Sherlock chewing, the soft rustle of the newspaper now-and-again, and the hum of traffic outside.
John’s voice is low, and soft, and close enough that Sherlock can feel his breath whisper over his lips and nose as he speaks.
“It’s possible that the motivation isn’t a desire for money, but simply to hurt the father, which means that the boy…”
John had got up that morning, craving his gran’s tea cakes, and since they didn’t have everything they needed to make them, he decided he’d just have to go into town to get the missing ingredients.
He’s dizzy, and aching, and blinded to everything but the need to have more, more of Sherlock’s breath, more of his skin, more of his mouth, his warmth, his pulse thrumming against and through John’s body like it’s his own.
The cottage’s only other loo is on the first floor, so he retreats there to change, to not think about John’s face, soft, lax, peaceful, pressed into Sherlock’s pillow, to not think about how his pillow will smell of John tonight, to most certainly not think about how he might arrange switching pillows without John noticing, and sleep with his face pressed against the same down that had been tucked up between John’s legs with only a thin layer of cotton between it and John’s…
They’re both growing hard again as their tongues tangle and their heartbeats speed up and fall into a perfectly coordinated rhythm.
Please see the new tags below.  This is an explicit chapter.  If you would like to skip that, you can without missing much by way of plot.  Just stop reading When Sherlock offers to give John a blowjob. ;)
They had been planning on heading back to London later in the day, and that is certainly not going to happen now.
John feels a momentary twinge of fondness, a fondness he’s been allowing himself to indulge in more and more, of late.
Sherlock reaches out and takes the basket from John’s hand, sets in on the floor, reaches out and takes his hand, leads him out of the shop, onto the street, into a cab.
Sherlock stares at the small blood stain on the placket of his white shirt, and wonders how it got there.
He feels every muscle in John’s body let loose, even those that are always tense always ready to run.
He hadn’t told Sherlock what John had said, and Sherlock had been too furious to ask, but now he wishes that he had.
He has hated everything about the night, thus far, from their cancelled dinner plans, to Sherlock running after their suspect and leaving John panting and limping after him in the driving, icy rain.
I mean I was, I was angry that I didn’t know, that Molly fucking Hooper and fifty plus tramps knew and I didn’t, but I was mostly angry at myself because…”
He gives John’s cock a long pull, and finally moves, pulls out just the slightest bit, before pressing back in as far as he can.
Sherlock looks down at the mess between them, and then back up at John, a look of mild guilt written across his features.
A proper supper, and then he’ll sit down and give Sherlock’s new video another watch, and maybe make a new one of his own, try his hand at editing.
John swallows and licks his lips, his eyes dragging the length of Sherlock’s body, as much of it as he can see anyway.
It would explain why Heidegger saw him climbing down from his window in the dead of night, actions I suspect Arthur would not have been prone to under usual circumstances.”
He stares at John, skin and hair glowing warm by the fire, lips curled around the rim of his teacup, and suddenly Sherlock wants desperately to kiss him.
He should have done it the day after Sherlock came back from the dead in a flurry of ill-timed theatrics.
Sherlock has pulled the sofa over closer to the telly, and is curled up in one corner, wrapped in his afghan, still clicking through one channel after another, one leg bouncing frantically, even though he’s got it curled mostly under himself.
One page has been bookmarked, and pressed between it is a boarding pass from Dalian DLC to London LHR on Zhuang Airlines.
Sherlock reaches out and wraps his arms around him, strains up to kiss his neck, and John cries out, his forehead dropping to Sherlock’s cheek, panting in small, strangled whimpers, looking more and more desperate.
He briefly contemplates telling Sherlock this, just to see the reaction he would get, and then thinks better of it.
As always, thank you for reading, and thanks so much for your patience, as work and real life got uncharacteristically busy soon after I started writing this one.
John swallows tightly, takes a deep breath, and lets it out, again, tickling Sherlock’s earlobe with his breath.  “I don’t know.”
Sherlock sits up and reaches for the tray eagerly, which seems to please John, because he grins even wider.
There is an odd assortment of books, on the shelves behind a heavy mahogany desk: old military histories, cookbooks, some faded Victorian tome on astronomy, an eclectic collection of pocket books that mostly seem to have been published between the fifties and nineties, some leather-bound classics, right along side a small handful of books on bee-keeping and gardening.
He just stares up at Sherlock, and hopes that the language they are speaking in that moment, the language they have always shared, is enough for Sherlock to know everything this has meant to him, everything Sherlock means to him.
John watches him place the star back in the water, pointing out things as he does, no doubt explaining to her why the creature needs to stay there.
I only mean that you want to be here, and I want you to be here, and every moment you are not here is a moment we are both unhappy, so…
His cock twitches against Sherlock’s thigh, and he rolls his hips on instinct, screws his eyes shut at the intensity of the sensation, wills himself to still, because if he starts, he…
His fingers inch outward again, but he stops just shy of the hand John has resting on his own thigh.
John looks over his shoulder, taking in the crowds around, them, and then stares down at his hands, and lowers his voice.
is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. It has been compared with
But John doesn’t stop, instead, once Sherlock has settled, he wraps a hand around the base of Sherlock’s cock, and begins to add long pulls to the bobbing of his head, and the swirling of his tongue, and the building suction he adds as he pulls almost all the way off, only to plunge back down again.
He breathes John’s breath for a moment or two, and then decides to give him the space and respite he may need to process everything that’s just happened.
There is a long pause, so long that John wonders if Sherlock hasn’t taken him quite literally and run off again, without a word.
Silence descends between them.  The central heating clicks and whirs through the vent overhead, someone slams a door down the hall, a fox cries somewhere, outside, in the dark.  Sherlock takes a deep breath. He holds it, listens to John’s breathing—even, and calm beside him.
Your only exposure to touch as a child was what you experienced from your father, and it was violent and abusive.
And yes, he’s done what he set out to do, he’s eradicated Moriarty’s network, he’s ensured their mutual safety, so why is it that he doesn’t feel safe enough, safe at all.
John looks up at him, holds his gaze for the briefest of moments, and then drops it again with a shake of his head.
Sherlock is leaning toward the camera now, elbows propped on his knees, hands steepled in front of his lips.
She usually watches something light this time of the evening, while indulging in the marijuana habit she likes to characterise as medicinal.
But then there is the way John shrinks afterward, the quiet, pale man sitting across from him, who looks so strangely and incredibly young, who is coiled tight, and hyper aware, and…
John stays perfectly still, but trembles, and trembles, and grows impossibly harder against him, and Sherlock aches at how much he wants, how much they both want, and yet…
He thrusts into the mattress with each pass of Sherlock’s tongue, completely given over, completely wanton.
All worn wood floors, chintz sofas, and faded watercolour landscape paintings in gilt frames adorning the plaster walls.
And I know, I know that too much has happened, that it will never be like it was, but I guess I hoped that maybe we could find out what it is now, and that we could start from here and build something else, something new maybe.
It’s only after he’s hit submit that he realises that perhaps such an approach might be considered more than a tad ‘not good’.
They take their time strolling down the country lanes, hand-in-hand when they find some of the more secluded trails through the nearby woods.
Sherlock gasps, feels his nipples peak, and his hair follicles tingle, and his balls draw up tight, and then…
He feels like he’s buoyed up on the crest of some great wave, being swept away in the flood of Sherlock’s…
When he does, Sherlock goes in to do his own nightly ablutions and by the time he’s back out again, John is in his bed, head propped up slightly, reading a book.
No urge to try to hold back, to make it hurt as much as it thrills, no thoughts of reciprocity, or performance, or what is right and what is wrong.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel ... uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to.”
And he wants it, wants the sensory distraction to help him ignore the emotions that continue to threaten to overwhelm.
He’d got a call from the bank the second he got home, had tossed it in and then predictably forgot all about it.
Sherlock chuckles in a breathy huff, presses John’s body back down against his, and thrusts deeper, all the way home.
Sherlock is panting, but he rolls into John’s arms eagerly, smearing his lips against John’s neck, hands scrambling around and behind to grasp John’s arse and pull him close.
Since so many people expressed interest in what comes next, this ficlet has now become a fully fleshed out fic called:
This is John playing doctor, believing the reports Mycroft no doubt supplied, from a neurologist, and psychiatrist, and a whole litany of other specialists.
She was talking to her while I finished up with Lestrade, and she said she didn’t know what Rosie called me.
Somewhere in the back of his head he wonders why now?  Why after everything, after he almost lost John, after months of careful dancing around one another, followed by tension, followed, again, so swiftly by disaster, are they here now, doing this like they’ve been doing it all along, no months of nothing, no fear, no hesitation, a relief, almost, a joyful thing.
I spent two years thinking you’d killed yourself because I hadn’t seen the signs, because I wasn’t enough, because you thought that I only stuck around for the cases, for ‘The Great Detective’, and I didn’t.
The sleep that eventually claims them both is deep and dreamless, and when morning comes, Sherlock opens his eyes to find John still in his bed, watching him slowly wake with a look on his face that Sherlock thinks he wouldn’t mind waking to for the rest of his life.
And when he finally comes back to himself, when his brain finally comes back online, the first thing that he thinks, is
It is, he thinks, one of the most enjoyable mornings he can remember spending with Sherlock, in a very long time.
Sherlock nods because it is more than he ever could have hoped, and now he has it, he doesn’t know what to do.
He dives for his bag, pulls out the box he’s had stowed there for over a week, pulls out it’s contents and stuffs it hurriedly inside the cracker in his hand.
Someone has come and cleared a spot for skating, just that morning by the looks of it, which means it must be suitable to hold a person’s weight, but there is no one there now.
John seems to run hot where he runs cold, and the space John’s been occupying is already a cocoon of inviting warmth.
He tosses his new, claret, silk dressing gown over shirt and trousers, and makes his way into the kitchen for tea.
He reaches up and brushes a thumb over his nipple again, huffs at the pleasure and cants his hips into his fist.
It’s true he hasn’t the practical experience some of them no doubt had, but he’s had plenty of years to observe and research—both technique, and John himself—and he’s a quick study.
it’s starting to get unsettling, and he hopes to heaven that he hasn’t inadvertently brought William Edwards home with him.
Sherlock murmurs, pitching his voice low, all the way down to that octave that seems to always register in John’s body like a throbbing pulse.
He takes a step closer, leans down and carefully lifts the glass from John’s hand, sets it on the cluttered, dusty desk, and then comes back around to stand in front of him.
Molly will spoil her ridiculously, of course, and Sherlock doesn’t feel as bad as he might for leaving her.
John appears at Sherlock’s side, a cup of warm tea in hand, which he sets down in front of him, before giving his shoulder a squeeze.
He takes everything in in a glance, and appears out of his office with smile and a lolly for Watson, and a curious, concerned look for Sherlock.
John’s lips are white, lids heavy, and the bags under his eyes more pronounced, two angry bruises, almost livid against the pallor.
John settles into the chair beside Sherlock, and Sherlock can’t bring himself to look at him as Lestrade slides into his desk chair, across from them and grins, all the while looking back and forth between the two of them in a knowing way Sherlock isn’t exactly sure he likes.
He lays there, spent, and cries like he hasn’t since the day he found out he was being invalided home.
Sherlock sucks in a sharp breath through his nose, leans down to set his violin on the seat of his chair, and then turns back.
Sherlock cranes his neck to stare up into the dark shadows of the landing to the third floor.  “He’ll come down when he’s ready, I imagine.”
He sees a flash of movement through the trees, John standing beside the pond in the woods, one of Sherlock's old haunts--lovely, but rarely frequented by anyone.
And so they sit like that, John’s thumb sweeping in slow crescents over Sherlock’s skin, occasionally punctuating the touch with a slight squeeze.
He dips down, and presses his lips to the corner of John’s mouth, breathes against him, and John reaches up to slide a hand round the back of his neck, tangle his fingers in Sherlock’s curls, and kiss back, soft and full, but still mostly chaste, the way Sherlock likes when its the middle of the day, and he’s up to his elbows in an experiment.
Sherlock huffs into John’s hair, and mumbles something nonsensical, and John smiles even as his stomach knots with anxiety.  Last night happened.  It happened.  He has no idea how it happened, he’s glad it happened, but he doesn’t know if Sherlock will feel the same way now, come light of day.
He can hear Rosie’s soft breathing on the baby monitor by John’s chair, the rain outside all but masking the sounds of the traffic.
John gets to his feet and stares down at Sherlock sitting on the floor, knees splayed open as he leans back on one hand.
He takes the pillow from off of John’s chest, and brings it down to rest under his head, motioning for John to lift his own head, and share it.
After a moment he stares down at the medication and glass of water he’s still holding and takes the tablets.
If there’s one thing he’s noticed about Sherlock it’s how well spoken he is (or well written, or whatever you say when your entire relationship with someone has been entirely via text and chat).
There is more sentiment in his reply then he would have liked, and he knows she’s heard it, because she comes up beside him at the window and gives his arm a squeeze.
Sherlock takes his hand, lets himself be hauled to his feet, and then steps closer, and reaches out to cup John’s face in his hands.
When the clock finally reaches its destination, Sherlock pulls back a little, and stares down at John.
She leaves and John lies still trying to focus on what he can and can’t hear in the environment around him.
The man’s face is slowly turning purple, but after a moment he seems to see reason, and drops back into his seat in defeat, burying his face in his hand.
He sets about making some peppermint tea, and when it’s brewed, returns to the loo and knocks on the door.
It’s three days later, after John has been released from the hospital, and set up on the sofa at Baker Street with telly, and tea, and a very attentive Mrs. Hudson, that Sherlock finally goes to see his brother.
“You don’t know, because I never told you, but I worked for my brother for several years in my early twenties.
This was not the response Sherlock was expecting, not the response he usually gets to his unsolicited excavation of people’s deepest secrets and rawest of wounds.
But, the way his heart rate had picked up and his whole body simultaneously slipped into a state of perfect calm when John had wrapped an arm around his waist and buried his face in his nape, earlier, is not something he has the energy or mental space to process.
I asked you if even though you had already seen so much danger, and horror, and violence, if you wanted to see some more, and you said…”
I would have told you he talked to me sooner, but you seemed so lost that night, after the old woman died, and then I was being abducted, and then—well we both got a little distracted after that.
He gets an apple, wraps himself up in his dressing gown, and then goes to his desk and flips open his laptop.
This kiss is different, more heated, and though it sometimes takes them a little time to warm up, that is not the case this morning, it seems.
“When I became aware of his movements, when I began to see what he was capable of, I should have put a stop to it.
He had been shocked then, upon meeting John, to discover that his warmth, and praise, and attentiveness lit something up inside him, stoked to life the thing that had always been smouldering quietly just under the surface.
Well, um, she said she could probably come round to take a look at it next week, see about getting it listed asap.
Sherlock looks at him, and the way his hands are just now starting to shake, at the paleness of his skin, and the bloodshot look of his eyes, and the way he is starting to curl in on himself like a wilting flower.
I was so stupid, and I didn’t see until it was too late, and then I had to jump, to leave you, and I—I didn’t mean to leave you alone.”
John is a man of his word, and a man led by his heart, and by his own admission his heart keeps leading him back to Baker Street, and so here he is now, pressed against Sherlock’s body, curled into the warmth of his arms.
John interjects, his hand reaching across the space between their two chairs, to rest momentarily on Sherlock’s knee, before retreating again.
of pleasure, and John huffs against his neck, in response, kisses him again, let’s tongue join lips.
Sherlock frowns, and stares down at the sod beneath their feet as though it might somehow offer up answers.
Sherlock hates the easy way John and Lestrade seem to find an instant rapport, when it took Sherlock months to be sure where he stood with the man, and even now, almost two years on, he still finds himself sometimes wondering.
He rolls onto his side, pulls John in against his chest, reaches back and pulls the coverlet around him like a cocoon, and waits.
Sherlock scoots back as far as he can go, giving John room to lower himself into the fragrant froth, and John does, settling into the V of Sherlock’s legs and sitting there, somewhat stiff.
I always swore to myself that if I ever had a kid of my own, I’d make sure they were fed, and clothed, and taken care of.”
He reaches up, grabs his hand, tries to rip it away, but it’s no use, there’s no point, there’s no—no need?
And now all the confidence, the commanding presence of before is flagging, and he sees the Sherlock he only very rarely gets to see, the one he likes to pretend doesn’t exist—unsure, afraid.
Then again, he’d also said that what he and Sherlock had those 15 months they’d spent together had never been enough, and so Sherlock is left guessing (left aching), and wondering just what it is that John wants, and if John even knows himself.
Sherlock’s eyes are still closed, but he’s clearly awake now, and is humouring her with is usual patience, which still astounds John, even after all this time.
Just a little Halloween something.  It was going to be fluff, but it ended up getting a bit creepy in the middle.  Warning for the #ghosts of gays past, #possession, and #John Watson being a badass who would do anything, including going head-to-head with a ghost, to protect the man he loves.
When the door from the street swings open a half hour later it is to the sound of Rosie screaming, John snapping at her, and a bag of shopping bursting open to spill all over the floor of the foyer.
When he gets back to the lounge Sherlock has locked the door to the landing and changed his setup entirely.
His cheeks warm, and he realises he’s blushing, fucking blushing like some sort of besotted school girl…
“It’s just a half-mile from the sea, a 20 min walk to the cliffs, a mere jog to Eastbourne and easy drive to Brighton.”
Three buttons undone, revealing just a tease of chest and hint of long pale throat, before the rest disappears out of frame.
“At least, I’m not the one secretly dying their hair at three in the morning, and then attempting to hide the evidence.”
John’s lips part and he licks them wet as Sherlock wastes no time in unfastening his belt, and unzipping his flies.
John can tell by the way he shifts a little, slides his fingers down John’s spine, until they stop, hovering in the dip of John’s spine, waiting, waiting for John to tell him, show him what he wants.
Sherlock is overwhelmed. Completely and wholly overwhelmed with gratitude at John’s presence, his thoughtfulness, his care.
He looks back down at the man beneath him, reaches down for a pulse, and then climbs off him and rushes to Sherlock’s side, kneeling beside him on the pavement, where he can still see their suspect if he tries to move, but where he has decent access to Sherlock as well.
“Mrs. Hudson’s gone to her sister’s for the next two days, and I though it might be a good time for your experiments.”
He pulls slow, savouring the pleasure racing down and pooling at the base of his spine as he wanks himself slowly, watches Sherlock watch him, slack-jawed, and half drunk with pleasure.
We would spend hours in the library pouring over all the pirate lore we could get our hands on—fictional or not.”
It had been ages since he’d been able to get himself that worked up, and he honestly can’t recall a better orgasm.
There had been a handful of times when John had brought girlfriends home, when Sherlock had heard them together, had almost wondered if John had wanted him to hear, because he had done nothing whatsoever to hold himself back, and John can be extremely quiet when he wants to.
Sherlock looks down, and his mouth waters at the sight of John’s erection, full and twitching, straining at the thin cotton of his pants.
I believe we’ve already had this conversation, and if you will forgive me, at this point it is beginning to feel as though you are just looking for excuses to not be here.
Here we are at the end!  I can hardly believe it.  Writing this story has been such a cathartic journey.  A final huge thank you to everyone who has read, left kudos, commented on or recced this fic.  Thank you for coming along for the ride.
They lay there like that for a moment, very still, their breath synching, John’s body adapting to the fact that Sherlock’s is now a part of it, foreign yet familiar, wanted but new.
Well, I probably should have said ages ago, years ago maybe, and I thought—neither of us is getting any younger, so…”
Sherlock just follows, lifts his hair away from his forehead to look for lacerations along his hairline, and then drops it again when he doesn’t find any.
He nods toward the vista spread out below them: rolling, brilliant-green farmland threaded through with ribbons of trees and dotted here and there with small, stone villages and snowy flocks of sheep.
John’s brow had been knit, but curious as he passed it off, but now he has an explanation, any hint of warmth has suddenly disappeared.
Cold, boney fingers wrap around his upper arm, and he hisses, his attention immediately drawn back to the task at hand.
If something ever happens, and I’m being threatened, the information I gather could be used to buy my protection.”
Sherlock stares at John’s head, as he feels his pants whisper over his knees and calves, and fall to the floor.
They’re talking about ASMR, and he’s segued off into something akin to sexual negotiation, like the complete dickhead he is.
John’s eyes slide shut, his head falling back against the wall with a small thud, before he rallies and hurries after him.
But Sherlock’s tongue is working miracles, his hands, those big, gorgeous, talented hands massaging John’s buttocks as his tongue strokes, and tastes.
He puts the toast down, and the tea on to brew, downs two glasses of water, and then goes to take a piss.
And John does, even though he knows there is no Sherlock standing there in his kitchen, any more than there used to be a James, or a Peter, or his mother.
He’s already eaten one, and is eyeing the one Sherlock’s left untouched on the console between them, when Sherlock speaks.
He nods to his secretary, and they head for the door, the headmaster following meekly in their wake.
He must sleep, because when he opens his eyes again, it’s to John trying to shift off the sofa beneath him.
‘Oh,’ Sherlock mouths, and then screws his eyes shut when John shifts above him, pulling back a little only to push down again.
Finally, John’s arm slides down the wall to rest at his side. He wipes at his eyes, pulls himself up straight and returns to his chair without even looking at Sherlock as he brushes past.
He turns back.  “I’ve shown you what I can do. I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even thirty million quid just to get you to come out and play.  So take this as a friendly warning, My Dear—back off.”
There is a small red dot beside the Messages icon, and so he stretches, sits up a little, and clicks.
Dragging his hand out from under the covers, he fumbles around blearily, until his hand closes over his phone.
John momentarily wonders if he’s possibly hideously deformed. If it’s all some sort of Phantom of the Opera scenario.
This is the part he hates, the coming down afterwards, alone in an empty bed, the gaping emptiness that had momentarily been filled by a chemical rush, now even more overwhelming than before.
It’s the sort of velvety dusk that can play tricks on the eyes, and John fights instinct, willing himself not to spook over what looks like a dark shadow moving at the far end of the room.
A small child hurries toward the pond’s edge, hand-in-hand with her nanny, and starts to toss frozen vegetables onto the surface of the water.
Sherlock lifts a hand and subconsciously rubs his chest, just over his heart, in exactly the spot where Mary’s bullet almost took him away for good.
He has to root about in the cabinets for a few minutes to find a bowl and skillet, but by the time Sherlock comes back into the kitchen, inexplicably back in his pyjamas and John’s jumper, which John is seriously starting to suspect he is never getting back, he already has the batter well on it’s way.
It’s ragged and raw, and he drops the terrible secret at Sherlock’s feet like it’s a poison he’s horrified to have carried so long, horrified even more that he’s carrying still.”
When they reach the last building on the left, something that looks more like an old smithy, than a house, a man pokes his head out of the door.
They’ve seen things they never wanted to see, and they’ve survived things no one should have to survive, and they’ve lost—oh how they’ve lost—so very, very much.
He’s reminded of the similar gesture he’d seen in Watson’s nursery earlier in the day, and he wonders what it is he’s been missing, if maybe this thing he’s been feeling as ‘off’ between them all this time has been something else entirely—John struggling, holding back, holding in, as he always does.
A weird number of people seem keen on believing he and Sherlock are a ‘thing’, which he figures he really should set straight.
I just wanted to help, but I felt like my mere presence was an irritant to her, and I—I held on as long as could, but eventually the opportunity to go to Afghanistan came up, and I took it.
Christmas Eve he had a nightmare, and crawled down into bed with me again, for the first time since we’d left school.
And if, several miles north of Perth, an old and rarely used cottage, on an all but abandoned estate suddenly happens to have smoke pouring from the chimney, and a basket of food delivered to the front door, and slivers of warm, inviting light spilling out through the windows and into the darkness, no one in the vicinity will talk or mind.
John appears at the entrance to the kitchen, a tea towel slung over one shoulder, and glowers down at Sherlock spread out on the sofa, louche and lazy, shirt half unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up, shoes kicked off, and a hint of bare ankle peeking out between sock and bunched up trouser leg.
to go to the school, to see the boy’s room, interview the other students, learn more about the German professor, Heidegger by name.
Sherlock’s eyes shift, drag up the length of his body, and return to the task he’s doing a very poor job of pantomiming.
John is sound asleep on Sherlock’s pillow, his own tucked between his legs, and his hand disappearing beneath the waistband of his pants which are slung low over one hip.
John sounds near tears, but there is something in his tone that makes Sherlock think it’s safe to proceed, and he hopes he knows John well enough by now to be right, because being wrong could be disastrous.
“Hey…  I’m sorry.  Jesus, I don’t know what…  I shouldn’t have left.  I just went down to get some tea, and…  I’m sorry.”
Sherlock hums, and dutifully nibbles at the cheese as he scoffs at the wholly illogical advice on segregation of the queen.
In that case, Heidegger’s death was probably unplanned collateral damage, making whoever is really behind Arthur’s disappearance, now an accessory to murder, as well as abduction.
Sherlock rolls his head against the pillow to look over at him.  He can’t help himself. John meets his eye, and smiles. It’s fond, and a little sad, too, Sherlock thinks.  But that’s just John, no matter the situation.
Sherlock’s face goes solemn, but the firmness of his embrace never falters.  “Alright.  What did you want to say?”
“‘Course I am.  Wouldn’t make you wake up alone.”  If he sounds slightly defensive, it can’t be helped.
I—I’d only hoped that maybe, someday, when Rosie is grown and away at university, and you and I have tired of the mad rush, we might…
His fingers graze Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock thinks that John has finally said enough that he might just dare…
He’s dizzy with want now, rocking against Sherlock’s stomach, moaning like he’s half out of his mind.
John pulls the bluetooth from his ear, and stumbles back, but Sherlock catches him around the thighs, and pulls him close, holds him up, presses his face into John’s groin and breathes deep.
John removes his hand, and places it back on the steering wheel, and Sherlock has to resist the urge to lean over and snatch it back.
, that they can never be anything other than friends, and that, all things considered, perhaps it’s best if he move out, find a place of his own.
Sherlock forces his eyes open at that, forces himself to meet John’s gaze, reaches up for his face, pulls him down, presses their foreheads together, presses his lips to John’s cheek, just one side of his nose, and feels John melt.
The sensation of springing free, of his damp head sliding over the soft cotton of the sheets feels so good he inhales in a surprised gasp.
Rosie is more than keen, as she loves to show off, but by the time he gets her and the ducks fed, gives her some time to play on the swings, and wards off a veritable army of ridiculous women, he’s usually exhausted.
Sherlock has been taking his time eating, trying, he supposes, to avoid the conversation he knows is coming.
Rosie falls asleep early, in the middle of the lounge carpet surrounded by her duplo, and her new books, and the plush tiger that Mrs. Hudson gave her, and once John carries her up to bed, and tucks her in, there are Christmas drinks in the lounge, and Mrs. Hudson and Margaret sharing the story of how they met, and the long, winding history of their friendship, and there is Sherlock and John sharing their own story, and then all of them pouring over the house’s history, and the letters, and paintings, and photos William and James had left behind.
Sherlock searches John’s face, every nuance and tell to see how this announcement has landed.  John looks relieved, he thinks.
Sherlock stares at the back of John’s head, at the way his hair curls in the curve of his nape, the way his muscles rise and fall beneath the fabric of his jumper as he tosses the stones into the water.
He hears the telly switch on in the next room, Sherlock absently surfing through channels which he only does when he’s anxious as hell, and itching for a hit.
He’s still initiating, and John is only too happy to let him because he’s still reeling, but now he has John naked and in his arms, his whole approach has shifted from the erotic, demonstrative flirtation of earlier into something that feels much less like sex, and much more like…
He sits up straight, worrying the arms of the chair with his fingers, deepening the bald spots in the teal-coloured velveteen upholstery he’d already started to wear down in sessions past.
Before everything, and I need you to know that you still are, that you’ll always be, and I need you know…”
He reaches out and lays a hand lightly on John’s thigh, for the briefest of moments, and then lets go again.
He realises too late that he has nothing to put in his hair, and it’s likely to be a riot before their session is through.
“Because you keep me grounded, are a catalyst to my deductions, your mere presence has a centring effect.
Circumcised, sadly, due to his mother’s fastidious nature, and his father’s penchant for all things American, but other than that, a rather perfect specimen.
There is the familiar brocade wallpaper over the leather sofa, there the honeycomb pattern curtains hanging over large windows, to his left is the leather chair set up beside the hearth, an open violin case sitting on the seat, and another red brocade chair across from it.

There are windows on one side, but it is so overcast outside, that they do nothing to cut through the thick black.
They’re all things he’s seen in flashes and snippets before, but seen together they make for a warm and inviting space.
The crease of his thigh is slick, and Sherlock’s cock slides perfectly into place, nerves pricking, arousal pooling, thick and hot.
A few more inane pleasantries are exchanged, but Sherlock hears none of them, because John’s neck is slowly flushing around his collar, and Sherlock is rapt.
He can hear Mrs. Hudson talking to Rosie in her flat, but he goes straight upstairs, shuts himself in his bedroom, curls up on the bed and tries not to think.
