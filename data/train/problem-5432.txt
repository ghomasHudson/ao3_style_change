*Damnit Dean, NOT the time for channelling your inner nerd!*
He refuses to cry. This was not in the plans and it can’t get in the way.
Cas brings him back to reality with a sharp thrust. Dean take is a deep breath and starts grinding again. The hand around his throat pushes down a little bit.
“I gotta go. Lots of work to be done.”
“Well... been a while since I fell for a line like that... you’re not my usual type. Your sort usually doesn’t have the... finesse... to satisfy a woman like me, sweetie.”
“Hello?”
Before Dean can say or do anything, he’s being stripped of every piece of clothing, save the panties. A bottle of lube's being thrown on the bed. Cas then swiftly removes his own clothes, a determent urgency to his actions. Next thing he knows, his cock is being fondled through the lace, Cas’ nose pushed against his balls, tongue licking this shaft from root to tip.
His voice is low and even. The tone of voice that used to make Dean cower like a little bitch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fear. Fearfearfear.
Ah man, Cas sounds so worried. That wasn’t what he was going for. Ok Dean... brave face... act the shit out of this!
“Dad, just give up... Cas’ll eat anything, you can’t win this. You'll only hurt yourself”
***********
Mmm alright!
Cas tears his eyes away from Johns to look into Dean. Yup he’s definitely intrigued...and curious... and mischievous... *Oh lord, here we go again!*
“He would do anything for him. Did some things to keep Sammy fed that still haunt him.”
Cas bites his lip and gives an unvoluntary little trust.
He lets it go, but can’t help but notice the very disturbed look on Sam and Bobby’s faces.
“Lisa! He’s a priest for fucks sake!”
Dean can see tears in his eyes. God, how did he manage to destroy Cas like this? He whipes a hand over his face. What can he possibly say to that?
“I might... Come under the covers?”
*Don’t think about Cas... don’t think about those blue eyes, that raven hair, his immense strength, his hands -oh fuck- his fingers...*
“Do I look ok to you? I came here to drink and now I gotta do it surrounded by people who are apparently sooooo much better than me... That sound fun to you?!”
“Will you not look at me, Dean?”
A shower... he needs a shower... Not only did he sleep with a witch, he let that ‘thing’ do those unholy things to him!
Dean is sporting a deer-in-headlights-look and silently does as he’s told. As he’s leaving, he sees Cas is about to make a remark and shakes his head at him. God, how is he going to handle this? He promised he’d be nice to John and the guy has been more than friendly all day... Is he reading too much into this? Is he being oversensitive?
Dean looks at his dad with his mouth hanging open. He wants to say something, call him a hypocrite... but his little shit of a boyfriend beats him to the punch.
“In the flesh. And you are?”
But Cas isn’t in the mood for games. He starts unbuckling Dean’s belt, makes quick work of his zipper next and before Dean can even think of something to say he‘s half naked and being pressed backwards onto the table.
“Oh hey, look what the cat dragged in...”
“Off course, Dean. Whatever you need. What is it that a doctor checks during such an exam though?”
“I know, sweetheart... just let it out... Look, Dean, these are clearly not accidents anymore, I have to react. And I’ve got just the thing...”
Dean audibly swallows. He takes a shuddering breath. His voice is low and shaky when he asks:
But Father Castiel just smiles at him and says: “Oh, Father Zachariah’s sermons could make an angel lose their faith in God... First time I came here to inspect my soon-to-be-parish I actually fell asleep! Don’t tell anyone that...”
Now that’s one for the books...
“It did bring them back together in the end, didn’t it... Even if you did try to shit on their happiness, there’s no place they’d rather be than in each other’s arms. That's where they are right now, in fact!”
***********
John looks at his wife and sees she’s absolutely beaming.
“That’s very unhealthy Dean. Not to worry, I still have to take your temperature and examine your prostate. I hear prostate stimulation can lead to a very satisfying orgasm. I’ll see what I can do...”
Cas... *sigh* Dean knew that man would be trouble. From the way he looks, to his voice, his insight, his dominance... It’s like he struck a match and lit a fire in him. And tonight... tonight was like... like the lights finally being turned on, like he could finally see... everything. All of himself laid bare.
Mary taps out after the Chocolate Habanero. But Cas and John are not ready to let the other win just yet. The Ghost Pepper makes John go so red in the face, he’s almost purple. Cas just keeps on smiling his I’m-better-than-you-smile to egg him on.
He parks Baby in the driveway and walks over to the house. Let’s get this show on the road!
“He did. I’m not actively hunting and, ok, I’m only 18, but I can do it, I can help. I WANT to help, even if dad doesn’t. And you need Winchester Expertise, so...”
He pauses... the next bit he has to get through without tears. He HAS to persevere!
“God fucking damnit!!!”
Something hits his forehead out of nothing and stops him in his tracks. He looks up and sees Kaia glaring at him. Claire’s shaking with laughter next to her.
**********
“Oh don’t try to talk honey... you can’t.”
“So, tell me Dean, if we are to do this right...do I have your consent?”
Deans hands are roaming all over his chest, back, ass, thighs... biting his lip, a blush high on his cheeks. He’s never looked more beautiful.
John has a filthy smile on his face. And now he’s winking!
“So euh, the girl... Chastity... she didn’t do anything for you? Like, at all?”
“Not a fan of boys dancing, I see?
*hypocrite...*
Make me scream!
She leaves for a moment, giving Dean the time to start questioning himself, off course... What the fuck is he doing here? Relying on a shape shifter of all things and for what? For an illusion...
Fear again. Incredible tiredness too...
**********
There’s movement on the bed and suddenly Cas’ voice is in his ear, low and dangerous.
She is clutching his hands in hers and he can’t help but wonder if those hands were on Dean earlier. No matter how much he tries, his brain keeps tempting him, keeps telling him he’s an idiot. A fool for the man standing next to her.
“I know what you look like, sound like when you come...”
Cas is rubbing his back. The dirtbag who corrupted his son is fucking touching.his.back!
She starts doing that very thing.
“Yes. See? These arms... my chest... my abdomen...”
************
If this was supposed to drive Dean away, that plan failed miserably. It only makes him fall harder for the man. And when he tells him he wants to be involved in all of this, the look in Cas’ eyes tells him this thing between them is far from over.
“Sorry man, got a bit violent because of how the case worked out and then Cas came in and...well... we got carried away I guess.”
“Dean tried so hard to be like you. To just not be himself, at all cost. Became daddy’s good little soldier. Then Sam ran away to Stanford and you beat the shit out of him.”
The smile on her face is positively radiant.  John’s absolutely terrified.
His angel looks over to the table on the far left of them and a proud smile forms on his face.
“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea, Dean.”
“It’s a fantasy... anything goes, that’s how it works. And priest or not, he’s a hot guy. Don’t you think so?”
I want you just like me!
“Good morning sweetie”, she says with a tender smile, “noticed you were having a VERY good dream and I couldn’t just let that go to waste, now could I?”
You want to know, you want to see
Last order of the day is a group meeting. Like AA but for the LGBTQ-community. Dean is surprised to see some familiar people, shocked at some of their stories. He wasn’t planning on sharing his own experiences, but ends up talking about his father anyway. Being in a safe space sure seems to take away his boundaries...
“Well, that’s... great. Real great. I’ll just... Get help somewhere else I guess...”
Sam then says his final words: “Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you, for the first time, to Cas and Dean Winchester... FINALLY!!!!
It’s Cas. He’d know that profile anywhere.
In celebration of the 24th of January, I'm throwing Dean a birthday party.
Cas collapses on top of him, buries his face in the crook of Deans neck. As he comes down, he notices Cas is shaking. Little sobs escape him. Dean wraps his arms around him and kisses the side of his head. Oh, the lengths he’d go to, to keep this man safe and happy...to shelter him from the world and all its ugliness.
A soft, wet kiss is placed on the head of his cock. Dean lets out a whine, desperate for more... but Cas keeps teasing him. Keeps kissing his dick as if he were French kissing his mouth, lips puckered, tongue sweeping all over...making him impossibly harder.
*Oh man, just shoot me now...* Dean clears his throat, opens his eyes and makes the mistake of looking down. Cas is down on one knee, looking at his junk. Intensely.
“You can keep a secret... right Dean?”
John’s crying. Openly, ugly crying.
The look Cas throws him could mean he’s angry and wants to eat him alive or... something else. His eyes seem...heated? Noooo, he’s just projecting. No way Cas could want him. Do angels even ‘want’?
He walks over to their table and tells them to count him in. He’s completely oblivious to the evil grin on Jo’s face or the wink she sends Charlie’s way.
“That’s it... keep going, I’ve got you”
Deans eyes grow comically large when he sees what his dad just threw on the kitchen table... *OH FUCK!*
Lisa turns back around, nuzzles his neck, still trembling.
He stops in front of him, just a liiiiiitle bit to close... and places his right hand on Deans left shoulder. A warm feeling travels through his body. Like Cas is hugging him right through his skin and bones. He feels relaxed and starts leaning into the touch.
“Hey dad, you and mom have a good night?”
Cas sighs. Dean takes his hand. “Please, Cas. Let me in.”
“Yessss...”
(You didn’t think I’d leave without a happy ending did you?)
Alright, there
But he knows the cure to this travesty... They’ll never know what hit them!
Dean has never felt this nauseous in his entire life. He starts gagging and hurries to get out of the car. Just in time... His vision is blurring, so he sits down and leans against the Impala. Okay, it’s fine...he’s fine...
CRACK!!!
“I’d sure say so... Yer boy’s birthday. First birthday celebration he’s had since he turned 4.”
Dean’s been so good lately. So responsive, so giving. Cas decides he’s earned a reward...
*************
“Oh, just your dad being... your dad. What brings you by?”
The older priest is talking, but Dean is hardly listening. He’s constantly sneaking glances at Castiel. He can’t possibly call him Father, he’s too young, too hot, too... NO! Bad! Stop it!
Cas places a hand on Deans forehead en looks into his eyes. Man, those are some blue eyes...Dean almost finds himself getting lost in them, basking in the intimacy of prolonged eye contact... Ugh, his stomach is killing him! Can’t Cas make it stop?!
Cas feels... oh God, he’s never felt like this! This full... this taken... yet completely in charge...
Sam arrives in Heaven!!! And conspires with Cas...
He hears her walk up behind him and suddenly his world goes black. She’s blindfolded him.
“Dean!”
Cas gives John his best Dom-brow-look and says: “For your information... I am a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent. My true form is as big as the Chrysler Building and has 6 wings and 4 heads. This is...or was... a vessel. I choose to look like this for Dean.”
“I am. What’s the case about?”
“Nice reflexes, dear. A hunter I presume?”
Cas looks down at his form and takes of the trench coat and jacket.
Although... I’d rather you kept your mouth shut. Let me do my job. And maybe... let me do you. Alas, only in secret, only in the shadows. Can you really do that”
“And if she’s not?”
John doesn’t give in though. Only one left: the Carolina Reaper.
As he lets his eyes roam, he suddenly notices something under the front seat... something pink? He reaches over and... oh hello! Panties! Very sexy, frilly, satiny, crotchless panties... in hot pink. Why would there be women's panties in here? Suddenly, realisation starts to sink in... Well, well, well, seems like Deans’ been using his own Winchester-charm on someone else than that so-called angel. A grin appears on Johns face. He knew it! He knew his boy was just being temporarily mislead. He knew he’d see the light one day...
“We’re not together”, he says as he sits and looks at his feet, “it’s just... this.”
“Anything?”
He looks up into those blue eyes and...
He can’t take it, he pushes himself up, wraps his arms and legs around Cas and buries his face in the crook of his neck.
He’s just about to agree with his dad and change the subject, when Charlie and Cas appear in front of them.
But John’s not giving in... “Really son, that’s just being rude. Why don’t you just hop into the house, help them out and let the men have their drinks in peace huh?”
Puttin’ on a brave face then. That's his prerogative...
The song is "Scream" by Billy Idol btw...
Suddenly strong arms encircle him and even though all his instincts scream at him to fight back, he stills.
They both instantly say “YES!”. Bit awkward that...
“There is no brighter soul in the whole of existence than you, Dean and I am humbled to have been chosen by you. You have been my teacher, my friend, my saviour, the father of my children... you have changed me for the better and accepted my many flaws. I love you, Dean. More than words could ever say.”
He looks up at her and sighs.
He nods. It's all he CAN do. It feels like there’s a handprint seared into his shoulder, the electric blue eyes on his conveying more secrets than what is said with words. *he knows... oh God, he KNOWS!*
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Kind a woman, I give you my all
There's a Scoville-scale-pepper-eating-contest and John is feeling very competitive. But will he beat Cas???
He can’t. Oh god, he really can’t...
Lisa starts talking to the priest and Dean zones out again.
And right before he complies, Dean notices a hardness against his thigh. As he spurts all over Cas’ hand, the angel tenses and lets out a low groan, almost a growl.
And even though the plan was to give the fucker a good show and a nasty comeback, all is lost to pleasure as he feels Dean come inside him and they tumble over the edge together.
All night, all night long
The way Johns jaw drops just fuels his fire... He picks up the panties an caresses them gently while smiling.
Dean lifts up his face, searches Cas’ eyes, but he actively avoids them.
“Did you know my uncle?”
Cas turns around and looks him right in the eyes.
He’s laughing and drinking and acting like there’s not a cloud in the sky.
This position makes Cas’ cock slam right into Dean’s prostate again and again... He’s lost all coherent thought by now... Words spill from his mouth, but he doesn’t know what he’s saying. He’s almost there... nearly there...
“I had the same idea, you know... After you were gone and we had no idea how to beat Chuck... I was desperate for... I don’t know... something. Anything. Took the jacket with your handprint on it to a local tattoo artist.” He quickly pulls of his own shirt and reveals a handprint tattoo on his left shoulder. “Looks just like the mark you gave me. Made me feel like you were still with me.”
“I grew up in a very religious household. My childhood was a happy one, on all accounts. My parents were the perfect couple, I had 4 older siblings, we were rich, … I wanted for nothing. The church was a very prominent fixture in our lives. My brothers and I were sent to a Catholic boarding school for boys, my sister to one for girls. Priests and nuns were like aunts and uncles to us, people we trusted above everyone else.
“No problem, honey. Your always welcome here! But... what happened?”
He does. He steadies himself for a moment and goes for broke:
Crowley takes a sip of his scotch and puts his flirty persona back on.
“Yesssss... Oh you’re such a good boy, aren’t you... following orders, consequences be damned... look at what you do to me... making me behave so sacrilegiously.”
Dean can’t hold back anymore, his moans reaching a crescendo as he comes untouched, all over their stomachs. The way he tightens even more around Cas is maddening and a handful of thrusts bring on his own orgasm. The way he growls into Deans neck makes the other man's cock twitch and spurt a little more semen as a last hurrah. He feels his smile against his skin and finishes his sentence:
They hear a chair falling over and the backdoor slamming, but they pay it no mind. Just the thought of Dean in those panties makes Cas want to slam his lover against a wall and have his way with him. So, he does.
“Please... don’t...”
And he liked it.
“DAD!!!”
“Noooo, no bloody, messy torture for you sir! Doesn't mean you won’t suffer though. Personally, I’ve always found mental torture to be far more satisfying. And far more elegant. The scars of the soul do more lasting harm than the scars of the body after all...”
“You seriously couldn’t survive ONE week?! I let the Empty take me so you’d live, you assbut, you should have shown me some respect!”
The sound is overwhelming. It’s like a culmination of years and years of waiting and hoping and longing... people breaking out in tears, kissing their own significant other, basking in a delirium of happiness.
///Bend over Dean... yes, such a good boy. Let’s see how much you can take, hmm? Want some more? I’ll give you more... mmm, look at you... So needy, so desperate... Oh you take it so well... You like it hard don’t you, hard and deep and... ///
“Yes! I’ll go with you. Right now!”
All night, all night long
A tear makes its way down his cheek as Cas puts his hand on the tattoo. A perfect match.
“Hello Dean”
“Ok, you want my life-story? You got it...”
“Could you please not throw my underwear around like it’s trash? Do you have any idea how delicate this fabric is?!”
“Well son, that angel sure is looking out for you huh!”
Unbidden memories come to mind. He can still feel the hard bathroom floor underneath his knees, can still feel the tears running down his face.
Make me scream!
Ya think?! Dean has started thinking about kissing Sam to stop him from coming all over Cas’ hand! Nothing spoils the mood like incest...
Yeah, ok, as distractions go, that’s a good one!
So, he just withdrew from the rest of them. Filling his days with manly things. Cleaning his guns, sharpening his blades, shooting cans from a fence, cleaning the guns again, his daily workout routine (death is no reason for slacking off after all), taking naps in his favourite recliner… the works.
“Dean. Love of my life. My righteous man. You are the most loving, most giving person I have ever met... and I’m ancient, so that’ saying something. You always put everyone else's needs before your own, never asking anything in return. And yet, you’re hardly ever shown the same courtesy. Today is not just about you finally getting a real birthday party, it’s about honouring you. It's about us showing you how important you are. We may be one big family up here, but it’s you that brought us together. You are the glue, Dean. Overlooked, often forgotten... but absolutely indispensable.”
His tongue flicks out, he licks and sucks until Dean feels like a live wire. If only he’d known about THIS before! Total gamechanger... He actually let’s out the most disappointed noise, when Cas stops his ministrations to go fetch some lube. God, if it were up to him, he’d spend all afternoon on his back with Cas’ face buried between his cheeks. Any reservations he might have had about what they’re about to do, have vanished like dawn to the daylight.
“Huh... afraid of this itty-bitty blade? Surely not... Anyway, no need to worry. Since you endured 100+ years being tortured in Hell without giving in to Alistair’s proposal, I figured physical torment just wouldn’t do.”
Cas pulls away, but not before cleaning him with his grace and covering him with a plaid.
Later, when Dean’s driving and gradually starts feeling better, he allows himself to think about what Cas did. How it felt. Fuck...it felt...good. Really good. And he wasn’t even doing that much. Imagine if he’d... NO! No, no, no... Cas is his best friend, he can’t be thinking about him like THAT!
She perks up at the mention of Cas’ name and interrupts him.
John's in for a surprise... and so are you! ;)
“Muscular?”
************
Sam arrives early one morning. He finds himself outside a perfect replica of the house he and Eileen spent the rest of their –very happy- life in. She died only a year before him, quietly, in her sleep... and he hasn’t felt truly alive ever since. So now, standing outside his house, seeing the love of his life sitting on the porch smiling at him... yes, this IS Heaven.
The lights are dimmed and the crowd disperses. A familiar tune starts playing and Cas leads Dean to the dancefloor.
They both take a deep breath. Cas can see Dean kneeling on the other side of the screen, hands buried in his hair. He leans his head back against the wood of the confessional and asks:
He shows her the picture of Cas with the cowboy hat. Not that he has many to choose from. Taking pictures... not exactly a thing you do when you’re busy saving the world. Again.
“Have you told her? About last night?”
Ah ah ah yeah!
Dean is disgusted. This is how well his dad knows him. He didn’t have a clue his son was bi, he’s been disrespecting the man he loves, now he’s talking about his sexuality like it’s ‘just a fase’ and he thinks he’s a cheater to boot! He might have been a bit reluctant about Cas’ plan to make John suffer, but he’s all in now!
“I’m going to fuck your mouth and you’re going to take it, understood?”, Cas says and Dean hums his approval, making Cas let out a filthy moan.
“That’s great Dean! I’m so happy for you guys! Oh, I gotta see this in person! I mean... not see... everything... ‘cause: ew, but... WOW, I’m SO stoked about this!!!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Castiel raised him from perdition off course, but it gave Dean something he could never shake.”
The end.
Cas jumps up, ready to defend himself. Their faces are only inches away from each other and he can’t decide if he wants to kiss or hit that beautiful mouth.
***********
John leans forward, arms on the table. *could it be...?*
“You guys do remember I live here too, right? I mean, it’s nice that you two finally gave in to that infuriating sexual tension, but come on, man... on the map table?!”
Dean is blushing and suddenly seems very interested in his shoes, while Cas look like the cat that ate the canary.
Cas starts shaking his head, starts pushing him away.
(See the end of the chapter for
He has no idea what she’s meant to be the protector of... destie-what? So, Jack’s making more of these freaks... that’s nice.
“She died, Cas...”
“Relax Dean”
“Relax Dean. You’ll like it, I promise.”
Soon, the head-priest noticed and I was called to his office. He asked me all these questions... Was I not interested in girls? Did I ever look at boys instead? Had I defiled myself? I told him no. He then proceeded to explain the physical side of love, what happens between a man and a woman. It made my stomach turn. The mere thought of having someone touch me like that repulsed me and I told him that. He sent me back to class after that.
He... actually doesn’t suck at this... Colour Dean surprised...
Blond Girl is giving him a smouldering look. *oh yeah, old man, you still got it!*
The bible became my guidebook to life. I’d never been a rulebreaker or a rebel... I followed the rules that were put in front of me and asked no questions. A good little soldier in their vast army. A nightingale, the crowning glory of their choir. The envy of all the other boys. The popular one.
For all Deans teasing about Sam's puppy-dog-eyes, he’s pretty good at putting them to work himself. How can Cas possibly refuse him anything now?
Cas recoils so quickly, Dean nearly tumbles of the table. He pulls his trench coat tightly around him, but not before Dean notices the wet spot. *OMG, he totally DID!*
That is when I lost my faith... My faith in my oh-so -righteous father, my faith in my ‘loving’ mother, my faith in family, my faith in religion...
The fear is overwhelming. He feels like he can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t do anything but piss his pants.
Suddenly Cas’ demeanour changes. The slightly goofy smile returns.
Dean nods
*Please, please, please... no parent-sex in my car...*
For you to me are the only one
“I’ve therefore arranged for my successor to attend our next –and last- meeting this Wednesday, so he might observe my methods. Mind you, Father Castiel is still very young, he might provide you with new insights, but you’ll find my way far superior, I’m sure. He will learn, undoubtedly... given time.”
John makes a face and puts his hands over his ears.
************
***********
“NO, I’m taking a stand here! I AM going to beat him at this! I’m a marine ffs, I’d eat dirt -worms and all- and rate it 5 stars while I’m at it!”
They had just reached the Poblano when John joined them, cockily sitting himself down right in front of Cas and telling him to ‘bring it on’.
Dean sighs. *Sacrifice, my ass!*
So, I listen to those who the church deems sinners. I help where needed. I no longer close my eyes to the cruelties of this world. And when the mood strikes, I fuck. Sometimes women, sometimes men, sometimes others... Surely, if there is a God, he is indifferent towards sexual orientation and gender. And why would he give mankind the gift of pleasure, only to deny it to his most loyal servants? I simply honour all he created.
Dean’s silence is telling. Fuck it, he’s not letting this go without a fight...
He pushes in another finger and starts moving them, opening Dean up, preparing him for something... bigger.
Cas arrives at the bunker and is immediately dragged to Deans room. Dean is sweating... he’s nervous and excited and feeling mischievous all at once. He needs to do this very carefully, so he doesn’t scare Cas off. Off course he could just ask him to throw him on the bed and finger him until he goes cross-eyed, but come on... like Cas would ever want to do that. Like he’d ever have a chance in hell with an actual Angel of the Lord. Cas, who gave up so much for him and Sam, who rebelled against Heaven, who did a bout of self-inflicted penance in Purgatory, who is still so naïve and kind... What is he, compared to that? Still just Dean... traumatised, scar-riddled, emotionally constipated Dean.
Cas smiles without opening his eyes and says: “Very astute observation, dearest. And your point is?”
Behind him, Cas hears the front door open, hears John say... something...
“Well, if you’re sure...”
Mm, closer dear
“I want to. I want to be selfish and have it all. With you. But I can’t. It would go against everything I am... and you wouldn’t want me if I betrayed that.”
“She did. Said she wanted her own torture-moment with him. And you know how I like to spoil her... Don’t worry, she’s gotten much better at controlling her anger.”
“Where I’ve been is off no importance, nor is my wellbeing... I just had a very interesting phone call with Sam. He seems to be under the impression that you hurt me.”
“He never got to say it back. Not in life anyway. He didn’t need to die the way he did though... he could have been saved if he had just let Sam call an ambulance. But he didn’t want to live anymore. Not like this. Not without Cas.”
“Well, its been a very long time since my dad was actually present. Maybe for the best... being a good straight Christian man and all, the gay vibe might not have sat well with him. Ugh, you should have SEEN the staring! I swear, if I had made it to Heaven and saw those idiots STILL dancing around each other... I mean, ok, is it weird that Dean is banging my dead dad’s corpse? Yeah... but hey, it doesn’t even hit the top 10 of weird shit we’ve had to deal with. I mean, Kaia and me, we’ve been hunting since our teens. Not many things faze us these days...”
Inspiration for Cas’ picture:
She comes closer to him, starts circling him, knife still twirling...
Lisa stands, puts a hand on his shoulder.
Father Zachariah sounds annoyed... *shit*
The church is packed. Their eyes meet and he knows. Cas is the one he wants. And he’s the one he’ll get.
Sure, he had to play nice and endure some seriously fucked up shit, but the greater the cost, the sweeter the revenge!
John grins... ok she looks a bit young, but hey, it’s not like you feel it.
For the first time since they came in, Dean looks his father straight into the eyes. “Anal, dad. He means anal sex.”
Dean’s torn. He knows he has this...urge, buried deep inside. It’s something he thought he’d never act on. His dad put the fear of God in him to never do THAT. But other-Dean... Fuck it, he has to ask.
The sermon is emotional. It speaks of being lost, being found and knowing when to walk away.
After his last ‘stunt’ John decided to keep to himself. Sure, eternity was turning out to be a bit boring, but anything was better than once again witnessing Castiel riding Dean like he was going for a mechanic-bull-record. Seriously, THIS was Heaven?! Shame Hell was ruled by Rowena or he’d be begging Jack to be sent there...
“...and giving up on the sweetest of all pleasures, forsaking all selfish desire for duty, is it not more than one can bear? It is... but the power of conviction can move mountains. All of us make sacrifices for the good of others. Sometimes they are small, like giving your last candy to your child. Sometimes they are heart breaking, like letting go of someone so they can have a better life and be free. But they are never simple, they are never unnoticed, they are always a sign of good and loving heart. Our decisions, no matter how insignificant they may seem, can hold great change for others. And that is by far the most important thing: to love one another, help one another, accept each other's differences... and give... for one day you may be in need of receiving.”
************
Dean doesn’t give up, “Then tell me, damnit!”
Cas takes his hand, looks him in the eye and says:
“And then you tell him he’ll have to kill his brother. Like a sick deathbed wish. The boy he raised and loved as only a parent can.”
*I’m so completely and utterly FUCKED!*
They walk into Father Zachariah's office and suddenly his world shifts.  Blue. All he sees is blue. The strangers’ eyes fixed on his like there’s some sort of magnetism between them.
John races inside and throws up in the sink.
Cas blinks. Fast.
************
An uncomfortable silence fills the room. This sure didn’t go where Cas though it would. He has great respect for Lisa, though... Walking away from Dean is incredibly hard and he’s only known him for a week! It's just so... weird. He never believed in the whole ‘love at first sight’ thing. Love has to grow, needs foundations, needs time... and yet, here he is. Living the ‘coup de foudre’ fairy tale. Or rather, his own Lifetime Movie Drama.

Happiness, I'm glad
He feels mellow...boneless. Sex with Cas was always good, but damn... that was something.
He opens his eyes and sees... darkness. Nothingness. Complete silence.
“Wow, John! Look at you, pushing the boundaries of your sexuality! Good job! Maybe we’ll pull you over to the dark side after all... Have to say... I love a nice bum myself.”
“Well... hah...” Lisa is smiling timidly and bites her lip, “I’ve been working on improving our sex life. I was so glad we could stop following Father Zachariah’s advice... I mean, no offence, but how was that ever going to help? And after we both had a session alone with you, I felt like I understood our situation so much better. And then Dean arranges for a Saturday where it’s just the 2 of us and he says he has something to tell me... I was so happy that he finally trusted me enough to tell me about his sexuality and I saw an opportunity...and I took it.”
“...but you know, Cas, I don’t feel better now. I feel worse. A cheater... on all accounts. Lisa is wonderful and the way she keeps trying is admirable, but I still feel like I should leave.”
He tilts his head back and just gives in.
“Well, I’m off. Here, Dean, have a chair. I know you love this whole chick-flick-routine, but for fucks sake boy, you’re giving my son-in-law blue balls!”
Cas is standing in front of him, hands around his waist, copping a feel...
“I have a little surprise” *thrust*
Before long he sees a field appear, filled with flowers and light and life... and Cas. He’s just standing there, watching his precious bees. It always makes him melt a little, such a powerful being, so entranced with the smallest of creatures.
“Should have figured you two’d be queer, just like that faggot son o’mine... Fuck, what the hell is the world comin’ to? Just wait ‘till I give my speech, everyone will see, everyone will understand and say I’m right!”
Cas' POV. First a bit smutty, then a bit sweet.
Claire lets out a laugh and flips her hair back.
Dean let’s out a most delicious cry. Not in pain, no... he loves this. This show of strength. This domination.
Cas retracts his finger slightly and pushes back in with two fingers this time. With deadly fucking accuracy. Oh yeah, that’ll do the trick... Deans rock hard and itching to touch himself, but he doesn’t dare doing THAT. No... no... that would give the game away. He grips his sheets so tight it hurts.
Deans stomach starts to churn. Oh god...he’s gonna vomit again...
And he had sex with an angel in the backseat of the Impala.
“Come Dean.”
Without making much of a fuss, he pushes his fingers home once again. Shit, that feels so good... when did he become such a slut for this? Cas isn’t moving though... why isn’t he moving? Dean looks back at him and is met with the surprising sight of Cas leering at him like a man starved.
“So, Jack did all of this?”
“Let them get another priest? Are we all the same to you, Dean? Just slaves, fresh from the mold? A thousand more just standing by? You have no idea who I am and what I’ve been through!”
There’s a laugh coming from behind him. John turns and finds the rest of the family standing there, smiling.
When Dean touches the letters, Cas jumps up like a bolt of electricity has passed through him. Dean understands. He feels it too.
A hand lands on Dean's arm. He lets out a sob.
“Does that really matter?” She turns around, bends over and pushes her bare ass against him. His hard cock nestles between her cheeks and she starts moving her hips in circles.
*Wait...wha...salt?!* Dean throws Cas a terrified look.
She points a finger at him and says:“You just shut your mouth around them.”
While he’s waiting for Mary to come home, he decides to give the car interior a once-over. She’s immaculate off course... Dean has always taken care of his ‘Baby’ like a mother-hen with OCD. Still, best make sure to put a blanket on the backseat, maybe hide some wet wipes within reach. One never knows where the evening might lead...
“I know every hidden spot on your body that makes you shiver with lust...”
Thanks for helping me out with this one Jas!
And then his cock is ingulfed in wet warmth. Dean closes his eyes and let’s his head fall back. *God, that’s good!* A priest he may be, but damn, boy’s got skills. And to think he gives sermons with that sinful tongue...
John is being a very naughty boy! Luckily, Cas knows how to handle naughty boys... bit smuttier than usual.
They share a small, forced laugh, but the evening is ruined.
She looks the same as she did 3 years ago. He can’t help but wonder who’s face he’s actually looking at...
Castiel remains silent the entire time, save for when they leave. He shakes his hand and the combination of the young priest's warm skin against his own and the gravelly voice saying “Dean” gives him more lustful feelings than his wife ever has.
Sobbing. He's sobbing now. Feels like the world is ending, like nothing matters anymore. And guilt, so much guilt...
Bobby looks at him with a smile, but he can’t smile back. Hell, he can’t breathe for a moment. His mom...AND dad? How is HE here?! That fucker deserves to rot in Hell for all eternity for all the shit he pulled! Why...?! Off course...Jack. He doesn’t know.
He looks him straight in the eye and lowers his voice.
“Ok John, no problem... I don’t mind, Dean, you know where my hands have been! Your father’s been around the block, he knows how this goes.” He turns towards him and continues: “You know John, I was a bit sceptical at first too... I mean, it’s not the cleanest place on a man’s body, but seeing one’s partner enjoying himself is worth crossing some imaginary borders, isn’t it? And in all honesty... getting to fifth base without the right preparations would be just cruel really.”
“I thought I told you when we met, angels are soldiers. I was the commander of my own garrison of angels. Used to be obeyed, used to be feared...admired...wanted.”
How much you can squeeze
************
She giggles... “Wiped you out good, huh? I’ll give you 5 more minutes... Maybe you can spend them coming up with something to repay me with tonight?!”
“First of all, call me Cas. ‘Father Castiel’ makes me feel ancient. And second... before we even start touching on your relationship with Lisa... I’d like you to tell me the truth about who you really are.”
“Women, amiright?!”
I want you lovin' me
Sam seems genuinely confused. He takes one of the chairs and faces Dean. *oh great, therapy-Sam... Okay Winchester, time to lay all your cards on the table. How bad can it be?*
“Yeah, no... I don’t know Lis... “
“Were IS mommy-dearest? Thought she was going to join in on this whole Heaven/Hell-mixer?”
Dean had been waiting for Cas to come to him, to talk about what he said before the Empty took him (he refuses to call it dying, Cas simply isn’t allowed to die!). He hasn’t. And Dean being... well... Dean... he hasn’t got a clue as to how he’s supposed to start that conversation. Who knows, maybe Cas has had a change of heart? Maybe he’s already regretting his decision to be human?
He's been researching about this stuff and he’s read all about prostate and how it’s supposed to be the male G-spot, but damn... he did not expect THAT.
Only... within the hour, he finds himself in front of the church. Fuck this shit, he needs to see Cas. Right now.
He drops his voice even lower as he says: “We’re guilty of the same crime, Dean and while you may feel the need to apologise, I assure you it is unnecessary.”
Another silence. And then: “Ok, ok... don’t make a big deal about it...”
So, he improvises.
Beer. He needs a beer. Or 5.
“So ah, Cas is it? The angel who rescued Dean from Hell? Funny...I thought angels would be all ethereal and flowy gowns an harps... you seem very...not that.”
Cas takes his head in both hands, “I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation.”, then kisses him again. With vigour this time.
She bats her eyelashes at him, gives him a challenging look. He wouldn’t normally go for someone like her. Too posh. Too slick. She looks like the type that eats ‘boytoys’ alive. Beautiful though... and man, has it been a while. Time for that Winchester-charm to make an appearance.
“If the sun refused to shine
Juice running down my leg
Cas’ fingers start grinding aggressively onto his prostate and he’s so close...so fucking close...
“I have other duties this afternoon, but I’m amendable to seeing the two of you in my office in 15 minutes. Would that work?”
“Feel that? They’re thick and strong and very masculine. Surely you wouldn’t... Dean? What’s wrong? Breathe Dean!”
She blushes and looks down. A coy smile on her face.
Okay, maybe he’s been having some less then pure thoughts about the angel...been eying him a bit more closely, but that doesn’t mean anything...right? Right???
All night, all night long
She does as he asks, a frightened look on her face.
Like a moping child, John turns away his head an mumbles: “It’s gross is what it is...”
“Fuck!”
The twinkle in Cas’ eye is unmistakable. He’s on board with the messing-with-John-plan.
They’re wearing matching smirks.
“Dean, I... I had no idea... I’m so sorry... I was so mad at you sometimes for defending him the way you did, I can’t believe I was so blind... I need to make it up to you, tell me what I can do to make it up to you? Wait... who the hell let John into Heaven?!”
Dean looks him in the eyes, silently begging him to be careful, “Run.”
John would give everything to be able to say “Please...no...”
He doesn’t even think about fighting back, just does what he’s told like a good little soldier. But he’s not good... a good hunter would not have... SHE wouldn’t have...
“I’m going to take a shower... and a nap.”
The feeling is indescribable. It's crushing him. He thought nothing could surpass the pain he felt when he lost his wife, but this was just...
She startles him, so he reaches for his gun... oh, right. Heaven. No guns.
He spins on his heels and flees the bunker like it’s on fire.
He looks up and sees a young woman standing next to him. She looks... different. Ethereal even. Long flowing hair, all the colours of the rainbow in it...
Dean’s sitting behind the wheel of his car. Utterly dumbstruck. He feels like he’s on the verge of something big, like this is the eye of the storm and the rains are about to come crashing down on him. The numbness is scary. He has no idea what’s to come... Will he break down? Will he cry? Will he suck it all up, lock up and forget about everything that just happened?
(See the end of the chapter for
BAM!!!
“I’ll be your first, Cas.”
“Good evening, Dean.”
They both start laughing and collapse together in a heap of arms and legs. It’s perfect.
They toned down the innuendos, but still acted like a normal couple... touches, kisses, nicknames... just being “disgustingly cute” as Charlie says. And John just seems to allow it. He doesn’t look away, he doesn’t flee the scene... Cas feels weary. It’s the eye of the storm, he’s certain about it. And the shit is about to hit the fan...
“No.”
Gonna get obscene
“Come on, handmaiden, your queen needs you to do shots with her!”
*Ok Dean, time to come clean with yourself... you’re a bi man and you’re head over heels for an angel of the lord who probably has no understanding of romantic love and unknowingly fondled you just right a few days ago. Nice going...*
Cas squints. He lifts himself on his elbows and asks on final time...
**********
But he does mean offence, he’s laughing at Cas. Not that he minds...Charlie is about to put Dean up to something that will make John’s head just about explode. So, he stays quiet and waits for his lover to get some more alcohol in him...
“Oh god no! No, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Cas... when he first came down to earth, he needed a vessel. My father was a very devout man and offered up his body to Castiel. Things happened... Cas was killed a few times... which led to my dad dying too. He and my mom are in Heaven together and they’re happy, so I’ve made my peace with that long ago. Cas felt bad for me though. He and Dean tried to help me in any way possible, tried to keep me from becoming a hunter even. Kept doing it anyway... So, they started mentoring me. Became my pseudo-dads!”
He sits down on the edge of the bed, elbows on his knees, head in his hands. “I’m sorry, Cas”, he says as he feels his eyes get wet.
Both his hands are running up and down his thighs and Dean just can’t... he bites his lip and nods. It’s all the encouragement Cas needs. Before he knows it, his pants are undone and pulled down under his ass, cock fully exposed and completely at the other man’s mercy. Cas puts a hand around him and gives him a final way out:
Cas starts kissing his way back up, lingers on his mouth for a few minutes and –to Dean’s surprise- positions himself over his head.
They both nod.
Surprised at John being civil for once, Bobby relaxes and he starts explaining:
“Sleep well, Dean. I’m here when you need me.”
She seems unfazed and follows him.
Cas raises his left eyebrow and yep... there goes the poker face...
“Yeah... maybe not. But we did have a nice uhm...talk... last time.” He takes Cas’ elbow and steers him away from the crowd, “don’t you remember? Because I do...”
Dean chuckles. The audacity!
The stern voice, the tight hold...like a steel cage, yet so very comforting. He feels himself calm down, submits to Cas without a thought.
“Take of your pants.”
The sudden change in atmosphere throws Dean for a loop and he suddenly finds himself on his belly, pyjama pants gone and arms restrained around his back. Cas’ firm grip on his hands makes him moan. God, he’s always been a sucker for the strong ones...
“No Dean, we are not done! If this is what I think it is, I won’t be able to heal you! But I need to be sure....”, he holds up his index finger, “Now let me take your temperature.”
“Hello Dean.”
Kind a woman, nothing more
Cas gives a sermon and couples therapy takes an interesting turn. Warning to the sensitive hearts: adulterous smut at the end.
A hand slowly moves down the back of his upper left leg. They maintain eye contact as that hand slides lower, as fingers lightly touch uncharted territory. Dean gasps.
There’s silence for a moment, then Dean clears his throat and says: “Ok look... there’s something I’ve never told you and I have no idea how you’re gonna react, but here goes... I’m bi. Also, Cas and I are very much in love and living together.”
“Relax and bear down. Stop me at any time.”
He pushes Dean again and he finds himself backed up against a tree.
A wicked smile forms on Deans face as a plan starts to take form in his head.
“Goodbye Dean”
“Good boy...”
Saturday comes sooner than expected and Dean is not ready. He’s not ready to tell Lisa. He’s not ready to have a romantic weekend with her either... He’s basically screwed. He keeps going back and forth in his mind... Why fuck up what he has? Why keep living a lie? But Cas refused to be together anyway... but... he felt so... liberated.
Dean is completely blown away. A party... for him? It takes a moment for reality to sink in. He'd be 42... if he still had a birthday that is. With the whole Heaven-Earth time difference, who knows, he might be 273 by now. Doesn’t matter really... What DOES matter is that his family thought he deserved to finally have a real birthday party. And he’s going to enjoy every minute of it!
“Was I not enough for you, Dean?” His seductive tone obviously has an effect on the other man. He’s squirming...Cas loves it.
*So much for that...*
Gonna get extreme
They drive in silence for a while, after fleeing the brothel. Dean still hasn’t been able to lose his smile after that debacle. Cas, man... Mr. Angel-of-the-Lord-raised-you-from-perdition sure wasn’t kidding when he said his people skills were rusty... The angel is currently looking out the window, frown on his face. Dean decides to break the silence:
Mind made up, he starts the car and drives home. He’s got exactly 15 minutes to figure out how to tell the woman who loves him, why he can never love her back.
“Are you ok? You need anything else?”
“Think about it, Dean... him fucking himself back on your cock”
“Be grateful it wasn’t a knife.”
And boy, does he have a plan...
He did NOT just call his dick PERFECT!!! Oh man, he’s going to hell...again...
Aaaand they’re on the floor... Seems like some things CAN break in Heaven. They look each other in the eye and start giggling like madmen.
*LIAR...*
They don’t say much afterwards. They get dressed, exchange shy smiles... Cas almost hopes he’ll just leave without much ado. No such luck off course...
Thank Jack for this mischievous nerdy little dude.
That breaks the ice a little and they’re both chuckling. The bartender is a 22yo twink that has been eyeing Dean since he first saw him. He winked at him once... poor boy dropped everything and ran to the bathroom like his pants were on fire!
He almost started crying when his eyes met Deans earlier in his sermon. He is strengthened by his faith though. Not his faith in God... that seems to diminish each day, but the faith he has in his own ability to change lives... THAT is unwavering. He finishes the service and goes through the motions of greeting his parishioners. Amongst whom...Lisa and Dean off course.
CHAPTER 3
Claire’s beautiful smile suddenly gets a bit... on the psychotic side and a shiver runs down his spine for some reason.
They're both shaking, panting.... Cas quickly turns off the plug and slides down, covering Dean from groin to neck.
After drooling over the August one (a gorgeous redhead laying back on haybales with white feathers laid out in a wing-pattern and his hat covering his junk), he turns over the page to September... and his breath hitches.
The hand moves over his chest, downwards.
“Sharing secrets, gentlemen? Oh, Father, you look a bit flushed... are you okay?”
Said tongue is currently wrapped around the head of his cock, after licking up from the base. Without any warning Cas suddenly takes all of him in, burying his nose in his pubic hair. Dean’s eyes pop open and he looks down... only to see pink lips stretched around him and blue eyes staring into his. Cas winks and swallows, causing Dean to let out a strangled cry. A hand shoots up and his fingers tangle themselves in Cas’ hair. He struggles to keep his hips still, but it’s a lost cause... He gets up from his chair, careful not to hurt the man between his legs, waits a moment to get permission and then starts fucking Cas’ mouth with abandon.
“Sure. Is there something you’re worried about? Are you in pain?!”
You see, Dean, they’ll never out me. That would look bad. To the outside world I'm just an ascetic priest, quietly doing his sacred duty... So, yeah, they might “punish” me and send me to a little parish in Buttfuck Illinois, but jokes on them. Sure, there’s no LGBT-community to speak of here, but people like us are everywhere. And I’ll drag them out of the safety of their closet, out of the Hell of their own making if it kills me. I’ll change the homophobic parishes bit by bit, until the church HAS to acknowledge us. Until it can’t hide behind their ancient, redundant lore anymore... Now tell me, how will I do that if I leave the church? How can I change the constitution from within, if I am no longer a part of it? How can I save people, when I’m no one?”
He turns away from him and lets the tears flow anyway. His voice is now coloured with emotion, but he still keeps talking:
One part of his daily work out is going for a run. Normally he hardly ever encounters anyone, but today is a completely different story.
His voice is barely audible, choked up with anger and pain and regret.
Suck it!
Dean is squirming... when did it get so hot in here?
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
She lets out a giggle and removes his blindfold. Turns out it was one of her silk scarves. Kinky.
Dean has been quiet this whole time. No comments, no questions, no comebacks. He hears him get up and suddenly he’s wrapped in his arms.
They agree to the arrangement and leave.
“Ok, Lisa? Would now be a good time for you? Dean can come over on Wednesday evening, as planned. If that works for you, off course?”
“Remember when you met Lee and his father? You 2 would go on a bender and bitch about how faggots were worse than demons and monsters and all the while your sons were having sex in those cheap motel rooms you left them in. Dean always knew he liked girls AND boys, but how could he ever come out to such a bigoted father? You nearly caught them once. They had a big fight after that. Lee wanted out and he wanted Dean to come with him. Dean refused to leave Sammy.”
“I’m not”
“Let’s add some losing Cas to that, shall we? Seeing the love of his life pierced by an angel blade, giving him a hunter’s funeral, scattering his ashes in a carefully selected place...”
Dean rolls his eyes so hard, he wouldn’t be surprised if they rolled right out of his head.
“And I feel like I should let you go.”
He doesn’t know what to say to that. So, he stays quiet and reaches for a blanket. Once covered up, Cas’ breath is slowing, he’s falling asleep. Dean stays.
And Dean gets it. He does. Keeping everyone happy demands sacrifice. Figures that even in Heaven, he couldn’t be truly free... Not even free to love.
“But... have to say, I’m glad you found them. Couldn’t find them after... well, you know... after. Hey, What happens on the backseat, stays on the backseat, huh dad?”
That’s it, Dean can’t look at this anymore...
No actual pissing of any kind!!! I'm kinky, but not THAT kinky...
He finds Cas sitting on his bed, reading. Dean sits down next to him and shows him the calendar. Cas’ face pales.
Sam looks up and throws a bitch-face his way.
He gets out of the car and makes his way over. Cas turns to him, his smile so radiant it’s like staring into the sun. Dean starts running and scoops him up in a fierce hug. They don’t need words. Except... THE words. Dean still needs to say them back. Those 3 words. Here goes nothing...
“I... need to go. Goodbye.”
************
He can hear the smile in his brothers’ voice. He sounds so light...happy even. God knows he’s deserved some happiness.
He runs the idea by Lisa and she’s unexpectedly excited. It doesn’t hit him ‘till later in the day that she’s probably thinking about a nice romantic weekend together...Fuck. Yet another thing to distract him from work... He’s been trying to do some paperwork, but it’s not going anywhere. His mind keeps providing him with images of last night. And then there’s the intense feeling of lust that’s been plaguing him all day. Not to mention the inexplicable need to call Cas. To hear that deep voice. God, the mere thought of Cas saying his name alone makes him hard as nails!
He doesn’t have the heart to tell her this might be what finally ends them.
I want a chick who makes me feel
It’s Cas. He stands up and turns to Dean...
“HOLY SHIT!”
He grins. The angel looks extremely turned on and boy, is it a good look on him...
Dean comes to terms with what happened and what is means. What to do now, though?
He never knew his son could move so well. Dance moves... on top of everything else... he’s got fucking dance moves. John huffs and looks away.
“Poor, poor Dean... My lack of filter seems to be contagious.”
“Maybe you should man up and join them then. They’re having a little pissing contest as we speak... You could try to beat them, show them who’s got the biggest cojones in this joint.”
He doesn’t have to wait long. People have been using the karaoke machine all night and when Dean stumbles on stage he’s met with a chorus of cheers and catcalls.
He can’t meet his eyes.
************
“Is there a man you like, Dean? Maybe an actor, a singer... the bartender at Rocky’s?”
“Not yet, love, not yet...any...oooh... moment now...wait for it”
“No Dean, nothing like that. I don’t require lube for this because my grace makes my vessel vibrate slightly. Hardly detectable, but enough to make your skin and muscles relax. Temperature’s fine by the way. Now let’s see if I can find...”
“Can you touch yourself for me, Dean? Nice and slow...”
“He was so glad when Sam came back to the fold and it hurt him at the same time. Sam losing the girl he loved the same way they lost their mother... he felt so guilty about that.”
“Still sore I had your boy first, Feathers? Still wondering which one of his talents he learned from me?” He’s enjoying this. Cas... not so much.
*********
Fear. Despair.
“Your scars all seem to have healed nicely, no weird spots or irritated skin... every freckle accounted for. Let’s move one...”
He takes a deep breath and pushes the pedal all the way down.
He whines and grips her hips, stopping her movements. He tries to catch his breath for a moment, takes his cock in hand and guides it into her. It’s wet. Warm. Tight. He starts thrusting, she starts moaning, breaking the illusion. It doesn’t feel the same either. Not Cas’ scorching heat, not his low gravelly voice. His thrusts falter and he feels himself going a bit soft.
God, he’s shaking like a leaf... and does his voice always sound so squeaky? He’s never gonna get through this without at least one manly tear, is he?
Not trusting his voice to be steady, he simply starts rolling his hips. Little thrusts upward that make Cas’ breath hitch.
“No... I’m afraid he just stepped out. I’m Dean, his son.”
“Dean has a son? He didn’t tell me... Things have been a bit strained, what with the gay-thing and all... Another grandson. Guess one of those waitresses got a little more Winchester in ‘er than expected, huh?!”
*************
“I know. Just one more minute... you smell so good... wanna rub myself all over you so I have something to remember you by tonight.”
“Cas? Those panties... they’re crotchless.”
Make me scream!
**********
Ah, Dean... such a beautiful mess... :)
He whispers in his ear: “ I know what you like Dean. And I’ll always be happy to give it to you.”
I want to hear you scream
Dean breaks out the old Winchester-charm and leans in for a kiss. It’s soft and new... the angle a bit awkward... but nice... very nice.
His brains short circuits. He has no words for this...
Dean scoots closer to his angel, throws an arm around his shoulders and starts ‘whispering’ in his ear.
POV John
“Cas...Cas, why... why doesn’t it hurt? You got some angel-grace-lube thing or what?!”
Everyone still alive? Anyone actually enjoying this?
John feels a bit sick.
He’s openly crying now, letting the tears flow freely. He doesn’t care who sees anymore...
Angry Dean, problem solver cas, Sam is scarred for life :)
“Oh yeah! Me and the Winchesters go waaaaay back! Huntin' buddies, I guess... The name’s Garth, by the way. Sam... he never told you about me?”
Cas looks down onto HIS righteous man... even after all these years, still beautiful, still THE Dean Winchester. He loves the way he submits to him. He’s got his arms locked together behind his back with one hand and 2 fingers up his ass and yet, Dean doesn’t move an inch. He’s such a skilled fighter, but makes no move whatsoever. Amazing.
He sends his sexiest wink his fathers way and the man just... stares.
No one around for miles
It was good, no doubt about that, but dear lord, that woman could probably make the devil blush!
Dean sees understanding dawn on his father's face. Suddenly Cas is beside him, innocent smile on his face.
Yeah!
“Come on dude! You can do the eye-fucking-thing with Mr. Dreamboat for all of eternity, but now I need some quality time with my BFF!”
“Damn, sweetheart... you’ve been holding out on me.”
“Oh, don’t look at me like that... no need to fret, the king of Hell never kisses and tells. Not even about cute, freckled demonboys...” He takes a step closer to Dean, looks him right in the eyes and askes: “Has Clarence gone exploring yet?” He lowers his eyes, fixates on Deans groin. “Followed the trail of freckles...all the way...down?” His eyes flick back up, brown meeting green.
“I can’ just turn it off, Cas. The anger... it’s festering beneath my skin and I just...I need... I don’t know. Distraction? Something good to focus on? I don’t know man...”
“I’m Jasmin. The first angel Jack created. The angel of truth and justice, heavenly protector of fandom and destiehellers. And I have an offer for you, John Winchester”
When Dean sees Cas again in Heaven, he’s ready to say everything all over again. For real this time.
“Yes.”
Gonna get obscene
He’s so fucked.
Shit, that eyebrow... if he wasn’t feeling like shit right now... Hey! No! Bad Dean!
“Cas, sweetie, you’re making the lights flicker...”
The laugh John let’s out chill’s Sam to the bone. Let’s see how he takes this: “Ah no... no waitress. And look, I know you’re not a fan of interspecies relationships, but bear with me. See, Jack, he’s not all human. He’s a nephilim. That’s half-angel/half-human. But he’s such a good kid and they raised him so well! He actually became the new God when we killed the first one. All the more reason to be proud... Dad?”
More loneliness. Cold. Stressed.
***********
BAD!!! Very bad!!! Sam is currently sporting a mother-of-all-bitchfaces and chewing him out like nobody’s business.
Then suddenly the mood darkens.
“You do realise John’s homophobic right? And interspecies relationships? Bet he won’t be too keen on that either. Cas, I don’t want to hide anymore...”
The room is dimly lit, clothes all over the floor. Cas is on his back on the bed, moaning softly as Dean rides him reverse cowgirl style. It’s slow and agonising, a deep grind of hips...lazy circular moves.
Things have been tense since he came back. After Jack absorbed Chuck’s powers he brought everyone back and now being more powerful than Chuck ever was, he put the Empty to sleep. Dean jumped on the opportunity to sneak in and “raise him from perdition”. Cas was then presented with a choice: he could go with Jack and reorganise Heaven or he could stay on earth as a human. He gave up his grace without a second thought.
Cas gets back up and looks him straight in the eye. Such beautiful blue eyes... eyes like the sky...
Mary putters around the kitchen, confusion evident on her face.
John crumples the card and throws it on the ground.
Cas gives him a confused look, but follows anyway. They take their respective seats and –hidden from Cas’ all-seeing eyes- Dean finds his voice:
“It vibrates” Cas holds up his right hand. Off course he has a remote... Before Dean can even begin to process what that means, the toy starts buzzing, hitting exactly the right spot.
He gets back up again and opens the door, but then...
“Oh, she had plans with your mother. And Benny. I've long since learned not to ask... Why, ain’t I enough for you, sweetheart?”
“What did you just say to him?” He speaks the words quietly, but his tone is dark and menacing.
He looks away... shit, maybe Cas didn’t like that after all...
*What the hell was that?!*
“Trust me... let me take care of you. If you want out, just pat the bed, ok.”
Dean feels like he can’t breathe... he wants to tell Cas how he’s the one that changed HIM, the one that made him discover and accept his true self, the one that means everything to him...but he can only form one little word.
He takes Dean in a tight embrace and feels him instantly relax.
He nods. There are noises. Clothes moving over skin, a zipper being opened... Then there are hands on his belt. She doesn’t bother taking all his clothes off, just pushes his pants and boxers down to his calves. She gets back up and reaches up to kiss him, while pushing the palm of her hand against his cock. He doesn’t know if it’s excitement or shock or just the complete surrender, but he’s getting hard. She smiles against his mouth and starts talking.
You know just what I mean

Cas’ mouth has gone completely dry. He swallows and before he can tell Dean to leave, Lisa is back by their side.
Thanks to you, it will be done
“What?! Why?! Let them find another priest! What does it matter who’s in charge here? Let’s just GO!”
After the Trinidad Scorpion John needs 2 glasses of milk before he can even speak again. Cas’ glass has remained untouched from the beginning.
Cas disengages from his lover and collapses next to him. Thank god for wall-to-wall carpet... He turns his head to Dean and sees he’s smiling, eyes still closes. He sighs.
“Ok... look, Dean, if you’re uncomfortable, I could find you two another advisor on marital problems, but maybe you could look at this from the other side? You’ve said it. You’re out. You can choose to be honest with yourself and the people around you, to be brave and be who you were meant to be, to love. Really love. Whoever you choose. The constant hiding is what...”
“Touching himself... giving himself over to you.”
“Are you sure?”
Mountains crumble to the sea
“Dean...what you said to your dad...”
Ok, no, not those 3 words... Dean is pushed back and is suddenly met with a very angry angel of the lord. Oh man, he forgot how scary Cas could be when he gets into this whole smite-mood...
“Heaven ain’t just relivin’ your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been: everyone happy, everyone together. Rufus lives about 5miles that way with Aretha. I thought she’d have better taste... And your mom and dad? They got a place over yonder. It ain’t just Heaven, Dean, it’s the Heaven you deserve and we been waitin’ for ya.”
“Feeling lucky boys?” Mary askes in a sultry tone. She sounds better than she looks... All red in the face, teary-eyed... Poor mom, trying so hard to keep it together. It’s hilarious! Unlike the staring competition between Cas and his dad... Seems like John’s made it his goal in (un)life to beat him. Well... good luck with that...
“Forgive me Father, I have sinned. I committed adultery. My wife is a really good person. Honest, loyal, caring, an amazing mother... and I broke our vows. Actually... I broke our vow before we even made them. I lied to her. I told her I loved her...and I do... but as a friend. I have never had romantic feelings for her. I’ve never even been sexually attracted to her. How could I be? I... I’m... I’m gay. She doesn’t know that either. Both of us are just...caught in a web of lies and I...”
[POV Cas]
Then one day, the whole family decides to spend the day at the lake. It’s loads of fun and after some clowning around in the water, Cas throws himself into one of the beach chairs and watches Dean approaching... all wet and slightly sunburned, dressed only in tight swimming shorts... They should go swimming more often.
“Dean...Lisa... I hope you enjoyed the sermon? I know I do things a bit differently than my predecessor, but I hope it’s a good change at least?”
Dean chuckles, “Oh don’t you worry about payback... Cas has made it his personal mission to make his Heaven a living Hell and you really have no idea about how vindictive that little shit is... It’s actually Jack that let him in. He didn’t know about any of this, he’s not to blame... actually, Cas tells me he’s all in favour of mentally torturing his pseudo-grandfather, so hey...”
He finds himself panting, heart racing, eyes closed. Is he really ready for this? It's his final frontier...where no man has gone before...
Next chapter will be a Cas POV.
The more Dean tries not to think about him, the more his hand accelerates its movements. He wonders... maybe he could use his own fingers? He could do this himself, right? Right. He’s never had anyone go near his ass, ever. Well, except Cas the other day... It’s one thing to admit to yourself you’re bi, but he hadn’t really been on board with acting on it.  For fucks sake, he’s 37, he can do this and shouldn’t be ashamed to want it!
“John?! Why is Baby here?”
“I’ll stop as soon as you tell me to.”
She says it without malice, but Dean can’t help but wince. Sure, let’s spill the beans to the new guy about his lack of faith! Way to make an impression...
“What’s going on, son? Trouble in paradise? You and Eileen doing good?”
