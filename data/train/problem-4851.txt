The team had allowed Steve to stay down there at first, bringing him food and giving reassurances but as the days stretched on, the worse Steve got. Bucky felt the same way, he loved Tony like Steve did, they had talked about it after Tony was taken and Steve came to him for some comfort. Bucky wanted to just say fuck it and fly all over the place looking for Tony himself but he knew that he had to be there for Steve. He was barely hanging on now and without Bucky to be his rock he isn’t sure what Steve would do, nothing good. the last time Bucky wasn’t there Steve had put a plane in the arctic and got himself frozen for 70 years.
“From what I can tell you were… well let's take this back to the animal kingdom, shall we? When a Wolf has a mate another wolf can challenge him for the mate and then they fight, whoever wins gets the right to mate and pass on their genes, in birds they Present to their potential mates and the mate picks the best male to fertilize her eggs, what I believe happened here was,” Bruce paused and pulled up the camera footage from the kitchen before everything went to shit, “When you fall your wings spring up and this caused Bucky to believe that you were presenting to Tony, then he presented back and shielded Tony,” on the screen Bucky pushed Tony behind him and opened his wings. “This caused a fight between you two, to see who was the best fit as a mate.” Steve noticed movement from the corner of his eye and he turned to look at Bucky, he was sitting up higher in his bed, and from the blush on his face he had heard everything that Bruce had just said.
“-eve? Honey? You have to breathe for me baby, come on, I know you can. Remember how you breathe when your asthma acts up. Yes, there you go darling. Good job, doing so well for me. Can I touch you?” Steve nods his head and Bucky moves forward, makes sure to telegraph all his movements and keeps from grabbing at Steve, even if that is all he wants to do. Grab the man and never let him go, curl up in a giant ball of feathers and never come out.
Partially obscured by Bucky’s raised wings he caught their eyes before he reached his hand and massaged Bucky’s oil gland. Loki leaned in over Bucky’s wing joint and addressed the room. Mainly to calm the others who were in defensive stances.
“The little punk was always getting into fights with guys the size of four of 'em, I'd always have to drag his sorry bleeding ass back to his ma so she could stitch him up. He always got sick ‘cause of it. One time I really thought I was gonna lose you Stevie, your fever was so hot and you were spewing nonsense, I'd always have to share the bed with you in the winter because it was too cold but, you had a- creative, solution to that problem as well. The winter of ‘35 you were shivering so bad I pulled ya on top a’ me, Stevie was 17 at the time, and he musta had a-”
Steve reaches behind himself and takes Tony into his hand, he lines Tony up with his hole and slides down.
“Steve, we are going to be doing a lot more than see you naked, we have to fit you for clothes. Think of it this way, you’re not really naked with us because you are a girl right now, no need to be shy. We have all seen it before.” Pepper told Steve as she walked out of the closet with an alarmingly large stack of clothes that she set on the bed and then walked back over to take the sweatpants from Steve’s feet to put in the laundry shoot.
When they arrived the driver and a few other employees were almost finished unloading the car which was full of many, many bags. Nat and Pepper were standing by the door which was slightly open and whispering to each other as the employees moved around them and took the bags from the car. (quite a few were striped hot pink and this intrigued both of the boys, Tony perhaps more because he actually knew where they were from.)
“Calm down, you impotent mortal, I have saved your lover. You should be grateful to me.” Steve was pretty sure he heard a growl from Bucky, he watched as Bucky’s wings tensed and he was preparing to attack again when Tony pushed in front of him and calmed him, acting like he was a spooked horse. Bucky was eventually calmed down and Loki had watched with a smirk on his face from the corner.
No, that was just how Steve was raised… raised in the 30’s when people were killed for loving each other. Fuck, and now Steve thinks that he is ‘sick’. Damn those fuckers who made Steve feel this way. Tony pushed forward and pulled Steve into his arms, Steve stiffened for a second and then melted into Tony’s arms. Tony rubbed calming circles into Steve’s back and listened to his hitching breaths and the now wet spot that was growing on his shoulder from his tears.
Steve huffed out a breath and dropped her pants and the boxers that she hadn’t changed out of since the change. “well, here we go”
“I’m good, and i think you should stay in that cell until we have all of this figured out.” Steve was glad that nothing happened, but he couldn’t help but feel saddened at the rejection, even if it wasn’t directed at him. The other him, he really needs to come up with a better name for the guy, starts his slow pacing of the cell.
Other than a chemical smell and some more pink mist there was no explosion or other disaster. Steve looked back at Ironman, Tony did something that Steve could only assume was a shrug. He turned back around and entered the floor, Ironman right behind him.
She also got a couple normal tees, pajama pants, shorts and a set of workout clothes. Steve wasn’t sure how the serum would be affected but the electric feeling of unused energy under her skin that he got when he didn’t go running for a few days told her that she was likely be in the gym, same as before.
He got up and went into his bathroom and turned around to look at his back in the large mirror behind the sink. His back was red and inflamed near his shoulders and looked puffy and bloated.
“Now, let's get this shirt on you, I can't let you leave the house like that,” Tony ran his hands up Steve’s abs and pulled at his sensitive nipples, which got a whine out of him and his wings to open.
When he arrived at Loki’s floor the door was open so he hesitantly walked inside. The room was like all the others, furniture and set up generally the same. There weren’t many changes to the floor that he could see, other than the overflowing bookshelf and some very soft looking  fur blankets on the couch.
“ok guys, whatever you do don’t get hit with the blasts from the ray guns.” Tony called over the comms.
“I need to get some lube, it makes it feel better when you rub it.” Tony stumbled around how to explain everything but he figured that when Bucky felt how good it would feel he wouldn’t protest. Once the lube was acquired he settled back in front of Bucky and squirted a bit of lube on his hand and rubbed it to warm it before he wrapped his hand around Bucky’s length. Bucky’s hips twitched forward and he groaned out, but cut himself off and looked at Tony with wide eyes.
“Yeah.” Steve’s voice was no more than a rushed exhale. He barely had time to inhale again before Tony stepped up to him and crushed their mouths together.
Tony closed the holo-screens he was working on and checked that the bracelets that call the suit were up and ready if he needed them. The elevator ride to Steve’s floor was torture, they shouldn’t have let Rogers out of that cage.
Steve flipped over on his back and his Wings were spread under him, Tony took one of the pillows and pushed it under Steve’s hips, then he opened Steve’s legs to settle himself in the space between. Steve had his head back and was glaring intently at the ceiling, Tony could tell he was worried and it would never get anywhere with him keyed up like this.
The brunet's eyes were closed in pleasure but the blond was looking at him with love in his eyes. Bucky had never seen that in something like this before, they were usually just women with breasts the size of watermelons and guys with dicks the length of their arm, never anything like this. Not even in Steve’s drawings.
“Well, what are you waiting for,” Clint jumped up and grabbed Steve’s wrist and started to pull him toward the elevator. “Let’s go try!” Steve shot a pleading look at Tony but just got a chuckle in return.
.” Steve’s tone made Bucky hesitate for a second but this stubborn matched Steve’s in kind so he flipped over the paper and stared at the image on it. Shit.
"It means sir, that I cannot allow you access to master Rogers unless he allows me to. Would you like me to ask him you would like to speak with him?"
"No, Steve. No. You could never be a monster, You are NOT now or ever will be a monster. You are one of the best people I know, Steve." Tony pleaded with the distressed man. "You don't have to tell me anything I don't need to know unless you want to tell me. It's ok, Steve. I know how scary it is, I get panic attacks too. You are not alone."
Steve arrived back at the penthouse to find Tony grooming Bucky’s wings while they watched a movie, the sight of his two lovers together like that made him smile.
“Yeah, yeah. I'll take a nap later, I still have to finish this, then I'm going to work on designing the new arm I'm making for Steve’s friend.” Bruce huffed out a breath and rubbed at his temples.
“I’m sorry.” both of them said at the same time, Steve’s face lost some of the tension and Tony found himself grinning back. Then it registered what Steve had said.
“Well, you look like an Angel.” He wasn’t entirely sure if that was supposed to be an insult or not, but just continues staring at Steve's body. it’s normally amazing enough, but the wings are just a cherry on top of the gorgeous sundae that is Steve Rogers.
Nothing sexual had happened since that first night, even when Tony washed and oiled his wings Bucky didn’t react like that first night. He did however follow Tony around like a little duckling, he was curious about everything. He loved being in the lab, while Tony worked, he played with Butterfingers and U.
“I thought the first time we had a bath together would be a little different, but we can have another once you get big again.” Tony slipped in the steaming water and let out a groan. Steve fluttered up and into his water and let out a squeak of happiness as well.
He disposed of the torn shirt and got another one from his closet in case Bucky wanted to wear a shirt instead of his wings later, then he grabbed his sketchbook and a pencil before returning to the living room to sitting on the couch to sketch. He was in the middle of his drawing of Bucky when he noticed the condition his wings were in, he had seen them in medical but he had forgotten just how dull and dirty they were. He decided that he should try to talk to Bucky now. Bucky had calmed and watched him from the slit in between his wings for about a half an hour now, and his wings needed cleaning. A somber feeling shot through him as he realized that Buck had probably never had his wings groomed or even touched, or perhaps he had but never without the intent of pain. Steve set his shoulders and decided that that would change today.
Having the scans was one thing, but it did no justice to how...ethereal, Steve looked. The wings that he could once keep from dragging were now so long they were constantly touching the ground, there were feathers scattered everywhere. Steve looked nearly insane, but a week in solitary will do that to a man.
What the hell was he to do when the baby does come! He has no idea how to deliver a baby naturally, minds less for him. What if the baby has wings or something?!
"Master Rogers, may I ask you what you are attempting to do?" Steve shifts the couch he has in his right arm and sets down the armchair in his left.
“No, no, I think I want to hear what you were like when you were 17.” Tony and Bucky shared the same mischievous smirk.
Steve had led Bucky into his room and sat him on the bed as he went into the bathroom to get the washcloth and a bowl of warm water that Tony used on his wings that first time. As he was filling the bowl, he started thinking about Tony, he hadn't seen him in a while, not since he had brought Bucky in to medical. As he sat behind Bucky and wrung the washcloth he continued to think of Tony and all the times that he had done this for him. He decided that he couldn't do this, Tony knew how to wash wings better that Steve could, hell, Steve couldn't even reach his own wings to wash them so Tony had even more experience with them that he did.
“before we see him though, you need a shower and a change of clothes, you stink.” As if realizing that he hadn’t cleaned up from the mission for the first time, he looked down at himself and blushed when he saw the state he was in. “I'll be on your couch when you finish cleaning up.” with that she left him and Jarvis turned on her show as she waited.
“He knows that now, I hope. Back then, it was horrible for Steve. There- God, it makes me see red just thinkin’ about the son of a bitch, one of the doctors that he saw said that he wouldn’t live past his 17th birthday, and even if he did he would just “spread his bad genes” the guy said that he would just give Steve somethin’ and he would pass.” Bucky had to stop for a second.
"Good work team. Let's take down the rest of the base. Hawkeye and Widow take the upstairs. Iron man, get to the computers and scan them for information. Thor and hulk, there are another group of drones coming from the southwest. I will see to the prisoners in the basement levels." once they got their orders each Avenger split up to take on each of their designated tasks.
“Bu-but I bit you, you’re bleeding because of me.” Steve’s self-flagellation was interrupted by a drop of crimson falling onto the other side of Tony’s chest. Steve turned and saw the brown mop of Bucky’s hair draped over his shoulder where the drop had come from, for a second Steve’s heart stopped thinking he hurt Bucky as well, but then Bucky lifted his head, his blood-stained lips and the mark on Steve’s shoulder told a different story entirely. Still in a daze Bucky licked at the wound and wiped his mouth off with the back of his hand.
“You better keep those wings clean, or so help me I will pluck you myself!” there was a beat of silence and then a flutter of wings and Steve running up the stairs to get ready. Bucky sent out a alert to the team and followed to get ready himself.
“Steven? Rogers? Come on wonder twins, I got an alert from Jarvis.” Tony made his way to the kitchen, but didn’t see Steve, he must be behind the island, Tony circled the counter and found Steven breathing heavy on the floor, his eyes were wet and his face was red. Tony fell to his knees and started looking over Steven for what happened. Steven pushed Tony’s hands away and wiped his arm across his face to rid it of the moisture.
“Uhm, Steve? You ok? Wha-” Steve started scrambling for the suit, his fingers pulling the delicate pieces of metal apart. “STEVE! Steve, stop it must be that freaking slime, Fuck I knew something was wrong- NO not the distal power circuits. FUCK.” Tony couldn’t move now; Steve had ripped out the power supply to the limbs of the suit so now he was effectively paralyzed. The emergency release on the HUD clicked open and then Tony could feel the heat of Steve’s breath across his face. He looked ruined, his entire face was flushed and his hair was in disarray, his chest rising and falling quickly, his pupils dilated and his hands furiously pulling at the suit.
“No, I think it is most likely a way for them to break you mentally, to change their subjects' body so they no longer feel themselves. If one is fighting their own mind it is much easier for that same mind to be broken,” Loki gave a shiver and continued as if nothing happened. “They wanted you to become theirs, and if they got some genius rug rats in the process, well, it would continue the line.”
They got back in the car to get back to the Tower when it finally dawned on Steve to ask about how they paid for all the bags of clothes that they had bought. She wasn’t the only one to benefit from the shopping trip, Natasha had gotten a few new sets of lingerie at Victoria’s Secret and Pepper had bought a rather dangerous looking pair of heels that Steve thought looked more like a weapon that a shoe.
Tony got up and shook at Steve but, when Steve didn't wake he gave up and went down to Steve’s old floor himself. Steve, having the serum made it so that he only needed about 4 hours of sleep a night but, when he did sleep, he slept like a rock and so far Tony had found nothing that worked to wake him when he was like that.
“Most, but Fenrir is the only one who has to suffer. My others were simply taken and put to work elsewhere.” Steve’s hand clenched in Loki’s shirt again. He pulled his fingers through the blond’s hair again until he calmed enough to listen.
damn!) suit and pulled the shirt over his head, his hands explored the now muscular planes of Steve’s chest, he stopped and pulled at one of Steve’s nipples and then continued down to his belt.
“Would you allow me to give you a ride to the roof?” Bruce smiled and walked into Thor's outstretched arms.
Tony nodded and before he could tense for the first hit Rogers’ hand came down again, exactly on the spot he hit the first time, but now he had no protection with his jeans removed. The loud sound of skin against skin rang in Tony’s ears as his body jolted from the pain/pleasure sensation.
“Come in.” He heard from what sounded like the bedroom so he went inside and made his way back to the bedrooms.
“Ok gang, gather ‘round. We have a little announcement to tell you.” Bruce, Thor, Loki, Natasha, Sam, Clint, and Pepper sat on the couch and looked at Tony and Bucky with nervous curiosity.
“Steve?” He turned to look at the winged soldier behind him, Steve still had his pants on his wings were arched high around his shoulders, Steve had this look on his face that Tony just couldn’t place. Steve leaned over Tony’s body and caught his mouth in another frantic kiss, then he moved down to his shoulder. He kissed and licked his way down Tony’s spine, stopping at the dip in his lower back to massage at Tony’s ass with his hands effectively pinning the inventor down so he couldn’t rub against the blanket for any relief. Steve parted Tony’s ass cheeks and blew over his twitching hole, Tony had no time to think before Steve dove in and started to eat him out. A loud noise left tony and his hips rolled back into Steve’s face for more. Steve’s tongue swirled around his entrance and then he would suck at the muscle, the noises that Tony made had Steve wanting to hear more. He dipped his tongue in and then out again, working the inventor to relax under him. Steve brought his hand up to rub at Tony’s perineum to stimulate his prostate from the outside and that was it for Tony. He came so hard his vision whited out. When he came to Steve had curled around him like last night his large wings wrapped protectively around them. He nuzzled into the soft feathers and Tony fell asleep with a grin on his face.
The arc reactor had glow-in-the-dark paint on it so it gave off a small hue of blue, Steve squirmed at the feeling of both men on her. Bucky held her thighs open while they stared for a second, entranced by the small slip of fabric between her thighs.
Surprisingly, it didn’t take as long as they guessed it would, Steve had actually worn something like it right after the serum. while they tested his endurance the extra weight on his chest would set his breathing off every so often that they gave him something that helped until he got used to his new body, Steve now realizes that some of the scientists were making fun of him.
He doesn’t do that though; he takes Steve by the arm and gently guides him to the couch where he sits them down with Bucky behind him and Steve’s back to his chest.
After Steve's wings got oiled and Tony put the stuff away, he returned to the bed and Steve pulled him onto his chest, almost laying completely on him. Steve's wings surrounded him as they always do, The smell of Steve and his warmth was his whole world. Steve would normally get cuddly after his wings got washed, but this wasn’t entirely cuddly, it was clingy. Steve held onto him like of he let go he would lose Tony forever. Tony decided to prove him wrong.
“Honey, Tony would do anything to make you happy, if you want to find your friend Tony will do anything and everything he can to find him. The only reason why I am not ripping your head off your body so you watch me as I castrate you for making Tony sad is because I know that you would do the same for him.” Steve shuddered at her words and that made her smile.
So now the boys all know and are (hopefully) on the same level. Please leave a comment below and tell me what you think.
It was bugging him. Steve didn’t just collapse while he was making a sandwich, unless he hadn’t eaten in a while and his blood sugar got too low. It was affecting his work and he almost just soldered his gauntlet to the workbench. Tony lets out a huff and sets the soldering iron down.
Steve looked beautiful, Bucky’s large shirt hung off of her smaller frame and she had her long legs tucked under herself as she read the book in her hands.
There was a ruffle of movement behind him and that meant that Steve was regaining conscience. Bucky stalked over to the couch and sat at his friends feet as he woke up.
“what do you mean, another like me?” Steve questioned. Loki grinned again and the feeling in his gut came back.
“It appears that there are Hydra agents with shrink rays attacking in Central Park.” The cool British tone answered.
When he stopped staring at his finished work he noticed how quiet Bucky was being and also saw the tense line of his shoulders, this confused him, Steve was barely coherent by the time Tony finished the backs of his wings and had been moaning the entire time. Bucky had not made a sound, good or otherwise, the entire time. Tony got off of the bed and went around to look at Bucky’s face. When he saw the reason why he wasn’t sure if he wanted to laugh or cry. Bucky had a erection like Steve had got but, he was looking at it like it would bite him, did Hydra even control this aspect of him,? Had he not felt pleasure for over 7 decades? Tony decided to change that, he knew Steve would understand.
“I need ya too,” Bucky quickly jerked away and all but ripped his clothes off. “How do you want me?” Steve turns an impressive shade of red given the amount of blood that is in other places at the moment.
yep, this is the final chapter of this story, i hope you enjoyed and if you really liked it (or didn't) tell me what you think comment and leave kudos.
“Well, I cannot have my host dying on me now, can I? I don’t believe I would still be welcome to stay if that was the case.”
When Steve could see again, he got into a defensive position and watched Loki for any aggressive movements now that he had him alone. Loki looked at him like he was a stray cat scrounging in an alleyway and turned to start walking down the dim corridor.
“I have to find him, they-they’ll hurt him, more...” Steve was still gathering stuff from around the room as he mumbled. She moved into the room and caught his arm where it was trying to stuff all the clothing into the duffel.
Something brushed the middle finger of his metal arm, he lifted his head in time to see a small robot, it was white and had two little arms with cleaning brushes that were pushed together in front of it as it polished the metal. Bucky huffed and sat in the seat, making sure to hold still as the little robot rolled around his hand cleaning the plates and scuffs that Bucky hadn’t gotten to because of all the chaos. When the top of his hand was clean the robot lifted and dropped his arms as if to say ‘all done!’ Bucky let out a little chuckle and turned his palm up, the robot made an indignant noise and rolled onto his palm already working to clean it. When it was satisfied that Bucky’s hand was clean it backed off of his palm and looked up at Bucky, Bucky brought his flesh hand up to pat the robot on its tiny head.
“anyway, let's see what ol’ Williams will pay a fiver for, it must be good.” Steve tried to grab it out of Bucky’s hands but Bucky twirled around so Steve couldn’t get it. “Say, is it anything like that one he had ya do with the dog and the two dames?” Bucky taunted Steve further as Steve jumped and huffed trying to crawl up Bucky to take the paper out of his hands where he had it held above his head, way out of Steve’s reach.
“Yeah,” Bucky’s voice was tortured sounding and he pulled Steve closer to him. “I think him wanting this might have to do with the thing that Loki did, or I may be wrong, could be that he finally feels safe in the future enough that those wants he repressed for so long can come bubbling up.”
“it's looking good kiddo, try increasing the pressure by 15%.” Peter nodded and increased the pressure, the shooter held so he took it off the stand and attached it to his wrist, aimed it at the beam on the ceiling and let it fly. The pressure was too much and the web fluid exploded all over the both of them. They looked at each other and laughed. Then, there was a sudden burst of thunder so strong that it shook the tower.
“come on sleepy-head.” Steve’s sounded soft and kind. He gently pulled his wing out from under Tony, he shivered at the loss of warmth. Steve let out a good natured huff of air and scooped Tony up in his arms. Instinctively Tony threaded his arms around Steve’s neck and nuzzled his head into his collar. “What am I going to do with you,” Tony could hear the grin in Steve’s rumbling voice, he could feel the vibrations from it where he was pressed against his still naked chest. Tony rebelled by giving Steve’s right nipple a lick that made a shiver go up the soldier's spine.
Steve had a headache, which, was strange because he hadn't had a headache since 1943. The team had just finished their food and was going into the den for a movie
“get some sleep Tony, we can continue in the morning.” he placed the sleeping Steve, cushion and all in Tony’s arms and pushed him towards the private elevator that goes directly to his floor (he hasn’t been up to his penthouse in a long time mostly spending his nights on Steve’s floor.) Maybe he should ask Steve to move in to his floor, it did have a bigger bed. He shook that thought out of his head, he’d think about that once this whole shrinking incident was over. Then he and Steve would talk. Man, he was getting ahead of himself, what even were they to each other? Boyfriends? More? Less? They hadn’t really talked about this whole thing, it just sort of happened. He guessed that he had the whole wing thing to thank for that. He would have never acted on his feelings if Steve hadn't showed to him that he trusted him enough with something that intimate. GOD he was so whipped.
First, He went into the closet and got some towels and laid them on his bed, then went and got some warm water and wash cloths. He didn't exactly know what to do, but figured that warm water couldn't hurt anything.
When Steve wakes up he is in Tony and Bruce's shared lab, he is laid on his back on a gurney on Bruce's side. He gets up and walks over to where he can hear Tony pattering around on his side. When he sees tony he is standing in front of a control panel and typing on it so fast his fingers are a blur, Steve also sees that the other him is pacing around in the Hulk cage and watching Tony like he is a raw steak and him the hungry wolf. His eyes flick up and he winks at Steve before he goes back to pacing and watching Tony work. The slight pause of the other him must have caught Tony’s attention because he looks up and turns around to look at Steve
“you are such an amazing person. I wish the world was everything you thought it could be and more.” Tony kisses the back of Steve’s neck, Steve hums in pleasure and a chuckle reverberated through Tony's body. He did it again, but a little lower and more to the side, Steve’s wings twitched under Tony and he moaned. “well, well, well. what have I found here? Do you like when I touch you here? Hmm?” Tony ran his tongue over the sensitive skin, this time Steve began purring like when Tony would wash his wings.
“Yep. and I'm gonna spoil my little girl rotten.” Bucky had that grin on his face that meant trouble.
“Relax Steve, I’m not going to hurt you.” With Tony’s voice Steve slowly relaxed and hummed in contentment as Tony’s hand drifted closer, and closer to the base of his right wing.
“I’m going to get something to clean him up a bit, okay?” Bucky kept his voice low so only the little bubble between them created by the shield of strong wings could hear. Steve nodded and Bucky ran a hand over Tony’s head before he got up and went over to Bruce to ask for some supplies. When he asked for them, he saw a flash of green in Bruce's eyes but the man opened his bag and pulled some sterilizing wipes and gauze to hand to Bucky.
“What are you talkin’ about, Punk?” Steve jerked his head up from where he was looking at the floor. “I told ya that nothin’ you were drawing I hadn’t seen or heard before, I was just shocked, was all. Didn’t expect to see that come from ya’” Bucky mussed his hand in Steve’s hair and crawled out the window to the fire escape with a bottle of cheap whiskey in one hand and his gift in the other. Steve scrambled after him and stood next to Bucky looking at him like he was speaking Japanese.
“OH! ~” Steve could feel how wet she already was but the feeling of Bucky’s mouth licking and sucking at her breasts sent another wave of heat to pool between her legs. She was sure at this point she must be making the red of her panties darker with her liquid pleasure.
“Uh, yeah let's get you out of those soiled clothes.” Steven followed Tony to the bathroom when Jarvis had already started the 4 waterfall shower heads and steam was billowing out of the room. Steven stood and waited as Tony rummaged around his closet for some clothes that would fit Steven. “You can get in and clean up, I'll put the clothes in the bathroom when I find them and you can throw your dirty ones down the shoot next to the sink.” Tony still had his head on the closet but he heard as Steven quietly padded into the bathroom and threw his clothes down the laundry shoot.
“Stev- what?” Tony was then pulled into consciousness. Steve swallowed around him again and Tony's hands grabbed at his shoulders through the sheet as Steve let Tony's length fall from his lips so he could speak. Tony let out a little whine at the loss of friction on his dick. Steve left a placating kiss on Tony's hip.
A groan from his side brought Steve back to his attention. “Tony, did you actually go looking online and saved a page just so you could throw it in Clint's face the next time this came up?” Tony fidgeted in Bucky’s lap, but the man held him still while Steve shot his best ‘Captain America is disappointed in you’ glare at him.
“Go sit on the table for Bruce.” Steve moved like his ass was on fire, he jumped from the couch and sat patiently while Bruce got him cleaned. Bucky stood a few feet away with his arms crossed over his chest and Steve never made eye contact with any of them.

Tony laid on the bed on his back with Steve between his thighs and Bucky was behind Steve. Steve pushed into Tony and then waited as Bucky slicked up his dick and pushed into Steve, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders and kissed him as Bucky pressed in slowly but surely until every inch of him settled inside of Steve, he let out a rush of air when Bucky’s hips finally pushed against his ass. they stayed like that for a moment so Steve could get used to the feeling.
“no Shit, Sherlock.” Clint called back while shooting a Hydra agent with one of the new stinger arrows Tony had made him. The agent dropped to the ground and started convulsing. “nice!”
“A hot dog is not a sandwich, Limiting the hot dog's significance by saying it's a sandwich is like calling the Dalai Lama 'just a guy,' ”
“One squeak for yes and two for no.” Steve let out a single squeak. “do you want me to stop?” Steve thought about it, he knew that Tony would never hurt him and his asking before he did anything was proof of that. Two squeaks.
“yeah.” they both helped Tony out of the bed and (with Tony’s insistence) flew him up to their room. They curled together under the covers with Tony in the middle, a wing and an arm from both of his favorite people wrapped around him.
“I thought you would want to see your female form the second that the Captain no longer needed it. I must say it is rather small in the chest, is this normal for Midgardians?” Loki inquired from Bruce. Bruce pushed up his glasses on the bridge of his nose and frowned slightly.
“I figure that you would like to clean up.” Steve placed the towel next to him and then fluttered his wings up to the lip of the cup, ripples moved across the surface of the water from Steve’s wings. He slowly lowered himself into the cup first testing the water, once the temperature was deemed worthy he splashed in and bobbed to the surface. Tony laughed at Steve's enthusiastic little chirps of happiness at the feeling of warm water around him after the battle.
"Oh my! I am so sorry I have no idea what just came over me." Steve’s face was almost as red as Tony's armor.
“Steve we really need to leave before the news crews get here.” the hand returned to stroking at his wings, his feathers shuddered under the attention. Steve couldn’t take it anymore, he didn’t deserve the affection that Tony was showing him. In less than a second, he was in the sunlight again and face to face with Tony, he looked so... Steve didn’t get to finish the thought because he was already in the air and halfway to the tower before the image of Tony’s shocked face processed in his tortured mind. Steve landed on the landing pad that took him to the penthouse, he didn’t stay long before he took the elevator down to his own floor and collapsed in a ball on his bed, wings pulled tight around him he began to sob.
also i cannot believe i got 2,000 some words of this chapter written. please tell me what you think and everything else as usual. Thanks!
Bucky came back to himself slightly and moved up to Steve’s right side leaving her legs open for Tony to move between. “Well, I guess I better leave my mark on you too, it’s only fair. Don't you think doll? Would you like me to suck on your beautiful tits while Tony fucks you in those panties?” Steve moaned out and tilted her head back into the pillow. The rhythmic rise and fall of her breasts with every breath caught Bucky’s eye, he zeroed in on the movement and dipped his head to take one of the flushed pink buds in his mouth.
“-Stevie,” Bucky slurred his words and he was breathing hard as Steve’s length pushed into him over and over feeling like it was pushing the air out of his lungs. “Don-don’t you ever leave again, never, can’t lose you.” Steve cut Bucky off with a kiss and he kissed every part of Bucky’s face, he kissed his nose and his forehead and then he kissed away the tears as they slid down the apples of his cheeks to the sharp angle of his jaw. He traveled down to Bucky’s neck and followed the tendon to his shoulder. He knew that Bucky’s uniform covered this particular stretch of skin so Steve latched on and sucked a claiming bruise on Bucky’s shoulder, while he changed the angle slightly and Bucky choked out a sob and his hand flew up to cover his mouth as Steve hit his spot over and over, Steve was close too, he sped up and pushed his hips as deep as he could go, he saw stars as he came and Bucky tightened around him as he came too in long stripes against his chest.
It wasn't the public speaking thing or the 'performing for the masses' thing either (god knows he had been doing that for so long, he had it down to a science) but, this was different. It wasn't just Captain America selling war bonds or taking a Nazi stronghold in the movies. no, this was as much Steve Rogers, kid from Brooklyn as it was the Captain speaking to all those people about his body and the changes that had been done to him without his consent, it left a bitter taste in his mouth. He really, really didn’t want to do this. It was one of those rare times he hated the serum and wished he could shrink down to that kid no one took a second glance at and disappear forever. He couldn’t do that, He had to explain to the public that he was not a mutant, and how if he was it would make no difference in anything. God, he felt like after Bucky convinced him to go on the cyclone and he puked up the hot dog they had for lunch.
“Yes, yes want you in me.” Rogers nibbled at the tendon of Tony’s neck while he pulled his cheeks farther apart and angled his hips so he could breach Tony’s lose and still-lubed body. He pushed inside slowly and Tony groaned when he finally felt Rogers’ hips meet with his, he clenched down reflexively but Rogers pinched Tony’ s right nipple in punishment, without even bringing his mouth up from where it was sucking a hickey at the base of Tony’s skull.
“Sir, Master Rogers is inquiring about you going and seeing him.” Tony stands petrified, in the middle of his kitchen with his 4th (or 5th? he lost count) mug of coffee in his hand, halfway to his mouth.
did nothing!” Tony’s voice was high at Peppers accusation. “It was tall, dark, and crazy over there.” Tony pointed at Loki like a petulant child and Loki scoffed while he rose from his seat.
“Fuck.” both Tony and Bucky said at the same time, the sound of Bucky’s hand moving up and down stuttered and his breathing became more labored.
“We can give him stuff for the physical wounds and have him stitched up, but what we can’t do is magic, whatever they injected him with has changed his biology, from what I can tell it is unstable in the body Without the serum to counteract it. If we are going to save Tony we need someone like Strange to help, science can only take him so far.” Bruce paced and ran his hand through his hair as he told the team that he couldn’t do anything else to help Tony. The other guy was restless and Bruce could feel his shifting, just under the surface, but not yet braking the water.
so what do you think, I really wanted to get more into Loki's relationships with the avengers and Steve specifically. anyway, as usual please comment and i hope you enjoy!
The slick sound of Bucky’s hand sped up again, matching the pace that Steve set, another burst of heat moved to her core. She planted her hands on either side of the arc reactor and pushed herself up and down on Tony’s length. She settled for a second and circled her hips, feeling Tony’s cock inside her twitch. She smiled down at his blissed-out face and bent over, placing a kiss on the middle of the reactor. Tony seemed to come back to himself, he caught Steve’s eye and flipped them again.
“Yesterday Steve passed out, he was rushed to the medical lab and Bruce and Loki were called in to help, in order to help Steve wake up from the coma state we had to change him into her,” Bucky turned his head to the side where Steve was waiting behind the corner and called her out.
“And now I am glad to introduce: The Avengers!” an overly cheery host introduced them as they walked onto the raised platform with chairs for them to sit on and talk. The studio audience was going crazy as first Tony, and then Steve stepped out of the side stage and into the view, followed closely by Nat and Clint.
"Put the vials down and back away" his voice echoed through the lab. The scientist stiffened and turned to look at the Captain.
Steve successfully used the bathroom and went to wake Bucky who was now spread out across the entire bed and covering Tony’s face with one of his wings and drooling on the pillows
“I see our little bitch has woken up just in time for all the fun,” he spat in Tony's face and walked around behind Tony. “well, look at this, she is already all wet and loose for me, just begging to be bred.” Tony felt fingers probe in his hole, he could tell that he was indeed wet and loose already. Fuck! His body jolted without his say, he tried to remain still but the feeling of something at his hole was like nothing he had ever felt before. His whole body felt like it was on fire, and his ass felt even wetter.
“Eww, come on Buck.” She crawled back onto the bed and shook Bucky’s shoulders. He just groaned and pawed at the air with his metal hand before letting it fall back to the bed.
Bucky makes his own breathing more defined and Steve, whether from muscle memory or actual memory, starts to copy him. This is how they would sit when Steve would have an asthma attack, Bucky would coach him to breathe and eventually he would copy Bucky's breath.
“Sorry, I just...” Steve trailed off not knowing how to communicate all the things whirring through his head. Tony nodded, knowingly.
“Thor, this is Bucky,” Tony opened his suit and it flew back to the lab as he made his way over to the two super soldiers and stood between them. Thor’s face split after a few seconds of nothing and he rumbled out a loud laugh and clapped Steve on the shoulder.
"Umm, this feels really... wrong?" Steve's voice was barely audible as Bruce inspects his wings closer. Steve's head was to the floor, but Bruce could see the horror and embarrassment on his face.
He washed his hands but had a contact high from Steve, his pants were obscenely tented and he was flushed in the face. He adjusted himself so the raging hard-on wasn’t as prominent and walked back into the room. Steve was still blissed out from the grooming so he walked over and kissed his forehead and left to his floor.
“R-really, it- it is ok now?” Steve was searching Tony’s face like it held the key to the universe, he watched as Tony’s face softened more and uttered the single most beautiful word that Steve had heard in a long time.
“I don’t know…” Steve’s face crunched in thought he whined and was doing his best impression of a potted plant, which wasn't very good.
Bucky watched transfixed on Steve’s ass as she walked out, once she was out of sight he jumped up and threw on a shirt and some pants before he rudely shook Tony awake and sprinted out of the room to find Steve.
“Lets go have our talk, we can finish with his wings when he wakes up,” Steve nodded his head and followed Tony out of the room, softly closing the door with a quiet ‘snick’ of the latch clicking into place.
“Everybody hear that?” Tony called over the comms. He received a few positives and then both he and Steve landed in Central Park.
Tony's dick made a valiant attempt to twitch back to hardness at the feeling of Steve's knot expanding inside him and the hot cum flooding his hole. Tony ran a finger through the mess he made on Steve's chest and he brought it to his lips, Steve opened his mouth and licked it off of Tony’s fingers. Tony cleaned up most of the mess to the best of his ability and then collapsed onto Steve's chest out of exhaustion.
“Do you want to get up and go to the bedroom so I can properly groom you,” Tony wasn’t asking a question. “Come on you big loaf I can’t carry you.”
“who?” This time Steve’s face crumpled in a way that looked...Well, the soldier didn’t know, but it wasn’t a good look.
He slowly slid his hand down his toned stomach and rested it over where he imagined a tiny life growing. ‘It’s just you and me now’ he thought.
“I know Stevie, I just’ want ya to be able to be known as an artist, and drawing these pin ups for some crook isn’t gonna get you there. Your work is too good for him.” Bucky toed off his boots and set down the gift he got secretly in the bundle of his coat while he sat heavily on the couch and made a move to take up Steve’s paper. It was upside down which, while Steve is usually kinda touchy about Bucky seeing the work he does for Williams, Bucky could tell from the way that Steve was acting and the faint blush on his cheeks this was a really good one,
“If I let you go will you actually get some rest or are you going to sneak down to the lab and work until I come and drag you to bed?” Tony could tell that Bucky was in full mother hen mode and he wouldn’t hear the end of it if he went to the lab, Tony ducked his head and didn’t answer. “That's what I thought, go sit on the couch while Steve gets cleaned up and then we will all go back together.” Tony nodded and made his way to the couch where Steve was sitting with his head down and back straight, Bucky trailed after Tony and as Tony sat Bucky stopped in front of where Steve was sitting.
When Bucky stood in front of Steve, he could see just the top of Tony’s head where it rested against Steve’s chest. Steve took a calming breath and the slowly dropped his wings to the side so Bucky could see but Bruce could not. When he could fully see what they had done to Tony he thought back to the bodies littering the halls and then he glanced at the ones that were in the room not feet away, they died easy for what they had done, they were lucky Steve had found him and not Bucky first because if he did there would be nothing left of them. He pointedly looked at the marks on Tony's hips and legs knowing what they were from but, not wanting to believe that it was true. He looked up and met Steve’s eyes, they were wet and he nodded when he saw the look on Bucky’s face. Bucky steeled himself and crouched down so he could help dress Tony while Steve shielded him. He saw red when he was pulling the sweat pants up Tony's limp legs.
“Look at that, already so hard for me.” Rogers worked Steven’s cock hard and fast. Rushing him to orgasm and then Steven came into Rogers’ hand with a whimper and let his head fall to the counter with a thud. Breathing heavily Steven thought that Rogers would leave him now but, then he felt a warm, wet finger against his hole and realized that Rogers was using his come as lube. Rogers was rough with opening him and pushed into Steven quickly, bottoming out in one thrust.
He felt that the part of him that long ago shriveled away was once again thriving in the sun. he had not had this much fun since he was but a babe, causing mischief with Thor by his side.
When the elevator arrives, they exit it and Steven stands awkwardly by the couch and fidgets and shifts his weight trying to find a more comfortable way to stand.
At this point Tony had been staring for a while and he was actually glad that Steve read that stupid paper, because he had his head ducked behind the page and didn’t see him. Tony’s apparent luck dried up in a second because Steve closed the paper and neatly folded it. He glanced up and caught Tony’s eye.
Tony groaned at the mental image of him standing over Tony after a mission and taking his belt off to ‘reprimand’ him for endangering someone during the mission.
in this chapter Loki talks with Steve about his past, this is pretty much just me wanting to love on Loki. he talks about his kids and although I did a LOT of research on Norse mythology I did take some artistic liberty's to make it fit the story.
Whatever Tony was expecting, it was not this. There Steve was, sitting half naked on his bed, fingers Nervously grooming the golden insides of his... wait, are those WINGS! What the Fuck! Steve had wings! He must have had one hell of an expression on his face because Steve let out a chuckle.
"I-I couldn't breathe." Steve's voice is ragged and you can hear the tears and pain in it. Tony's heart jumps in his chest. He wants more than anything to bust in and hug Steve forever, but he can't, that wouldn't help Steve now.
“No, that wasn’t me, that, that was you, you were with Jack, it wasn’t me.” Steven could feel his whole-body heating and his eyes were damp. The worst part was that it felt good, being trapped, pushed against the wall by Rogers and held there.
“It is as I thought, the serum that I took from Stark and put into him was meant to create a ‘supreme mother’ as it is called in my books, but I believe you humans use the term ‘breeding bitch’. Given the serum was in a normal human it would have simply changed the body to accommodate the new need for bearing children, but in captain Rogers’ case the serum already in his veins is fighting the new serum and keeping his body male. The serum continues to urge the body for change and in doing so it has caused a collision of inner energies. The only way to reverse the effect at this moment is to give the serum what it wants so it can carry out what it was designed to do.”
“SUCK MY ASS, STARK!” Clint was perched on top of the couch and Tony was being physically held back by Bucky as he tried to punch the guy while Bruce laughed in his chair and Natasha laid across the floor with a knife in one hand and a half empty bottle of vodka in the other.
It had a skylight that was open so he flew up and lowered himself inside to the cement floor below. He began to look around for signs of life, making sure to not make any noise that may alert his presence. There was a hallway that led from the large room where he had entered that he could hear muffled sounds coming from. Hesitantly, he followed the hallway deeper into the building to another open area that wasn’t as big as the other one but had better sight lines and extra exits, it was there sat off to the side and tending to a wound on his leg that Steve saw him.
“Jarvis, alert me if Steve feels like company and don't bother Tony, I want to have some words with him before he sees him.”
He returns to the room when he is finished to find Bucky and Tony curled around each other, Steve has the urge to draw them, Bucky’s feathers spread so beautifully across Tony’s flank while Tony had draped himself over Bucky’s chest where he is drooling on the shirt that Bucky stole from Steve a while back.
Steve wanted to look around so he tried to fly and was happy to report that he still had wings. He hovered above Tony for a little and caught a glimpse of himself. His... naked self, ok, first objective find something to wear. Luckily Tony had left the door cracked so he could go out into the bigger room. He flew over to the kitchen and He saw the paper towels. those could work. 5 minutes later he still couldn’t get the towel off the roll. Tony said that he would get some doll clothes yesterday, maybe they were here. He flew back into the bedroom to wake the sleeping inventor.
“Oh, Bucky. You feel so good. Perfect, all for me. Love you, love you so much baby. Love feeling you around me.” Steve kept his pace slow and smooth even though he wanted to fuck into Bucky without any inhibitions but this was special, this was the both of them, together at last. Forever.
“No Stevie, I'd never kick you out, ‘specially on your birthday,” Bucky smiled at the confusion of Steve’s face before he took a long swig out of the bottle and gave Steve the newspaper wrapped package. “Happy 21st Birthday, Punk.” Steve looked down at the package like it will bite him.
“Hmm, looks like we have a little guest,” Tony pulled off and turned to see who was there and Steven caught his eyes. They were wet and his lips were red from being abused, he breathed in heavy gulps of air and his pupils were large with hunger and arousal. “Well, looks like someone wants to join in on the fun.” Rogers makes Steven jump a little with the sudden words, he takes a moment before he realizes what he means and then sees the rather obvious erection tenting the front of his sweatpants. Steven flushes and tries to curl in on himself.
Steve woke up and crawled out of the bed, she made it to the bathroom in her half-asleep mind and realized that she was a
Bucky looked at Tony to see his answer, he looked contemplative and unusually serious, but then he nodded his head and grabbed the tablet off of the bedside table to work on while he sat at the other corner of the bed. He was present, but would likely not participate in the conversation, having his presence be there, but not intruding on them and the same time not being left out of the loop.
Tony lays there, trying to get his brain to function again when he notices Steve start pulling his Suit off. He gets frustrated and rips, Literally fucking rips the reinforced Kevlar blend off of his body.
black lacy panties: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixqcWkmYziAhXnUt8KHX_MACYQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shape.com%2Fshop%2Feberjey-anouk-lace-culotte-panties-pd40a6b2ae71ed42a4c5ae81b5a9e67b3.html&psig=AOvVaw3IswWHHrCki5woCU2XfV5w&ust=1557413961837013
Steve squeaked once in agreement and they headed upstairs to Tony's penthouse again. Tony walked through the bedroom and into the bathroom where he deposited Steve on the counter by the sink and started to draw a bath. Tony added in some bubbles and then went into the other room to get so things. When he came back the overwhelming aroma of lavender was fulling the bathroom. He had brought some towels, a bottle of wine, candles, and a plastic dish. He set up the candles and stopped the water when the bath was full then took the plastic dish and filled it with some water from the bath, Steve realized the dish was for him. Tony got up and took his clothes off, then waited as Steve slipped out of his pants and carried him over to the bath with him.
“Looks like the gas is fine, other than looking freaky it is completely safe to breathe.” there was a collective sigh of relief and the members who had to wear the suits took them off immediately. They all collectively tossed them in a pile in the ground.
“I have thought of a lot of ways to do this, but I figured the best way is to show you and then answer any questions you have.” Steve mentally steeled himself “during the attack on the A.I.M lab a few months ago I was exposed to a vial of the stuff they were using to mutate the people there. yes, I am perfectly fine, that is why I have been getting checked out by Bruce frequently and have been absent from team bonding activities like movie nights. There was a side effect of the vial though, and I hope it doesn’t change how any of you view me.” Steve concluded his speech and raised his arms to take off his shirt but his wings had other ideas. He hadn’t been wearing the new harness Tony had made him because he was going to be showing his wings to the team so the movement made his wings open and his shirt was ripped off of his body. He lowered his head; his ears were red and he felt the blush run down his back. He heard some gasps and even Natasha’s breathing picked up a little despite her unfazed look.
“What ya thinkn’ bout?” Steve’s Brooklyn accent made Tony hot all over and GOD the things Steve could do to him.
“Good, Thor go back to Banner and tell him we won't be needing the big guy, if he wants you can bring back something to put a sample in, when you get back though don’t engage. We need you on backup while we are on the inside.”
He rubbed at the glass plating on the arc reactor as he slumped onto the bed in his lab, placed there for the occasional nap, and fell into a deep sleep.
Steve was knocked over by Tony jumping on him to embrace him. They both landed with a thud on the floor, Tony with his hand strangling Steve’s neck as he sobbed into his boyfriend’s chest. Steve stayed stunned for a moment, and then he wrapped his strong arms around the weeping man on his lap. He kissed Tony’s forehead and put his chin on top of Tony’s head, Tony wept into Steve’s shirt and Steve held him, every once and a while he would shush him and rub circles over his tense shoulder blades. Steve cried with him and they sat there, just like that for a while, holding each other.
Tony didn’t make him wait after he answered, so he pulled off of Steve and then back down again, he continued this over and over again going faster and faster until he really was bouncing up and down on Steve's cock. His legs were trembling and he felt like he was going to collapse when Steve's strong hands caught him. He lifted Tony and then dropped him back onto this dick over and over, each time he pushed up as Tony came down and he hit his prostate every time. Tony threw his head back as he rode Steve, his orgasm rushed up to him without warning and he screamed out in pleasure as Steve hit his prostate that last time before he tumbled over the edge. Steve continued to lift Tony half a dozen times more before he pulled Tony down, hard, and his knot popped past the twitching ring of muscle.
Bucky looks directly into Steve’s eyes so he understands every word he is about to say. “You don’t have to tell me anything. Not a single word, and even if you do, I promise you, Stevie. That whatever happens I'll still love you, both of you, you and Tony are stuck with me, Ok?” Steve nods and lets out a small, wet, ‘Okay’
The final place that the stopped at was JCPenney, it was a short car ride away but with the New York traffic it took a while. Pepper said that Steve would like the selection here better if she hadn’t liked the luxury type clothes at the previous stores.
Tony rubbed the gland and Steve’s back bowed as he let out the single most filthy moan Tony had ever heard, and that’s saying something coming from a guy that has had at least 3 sex tapes leaked online. He continues his rubbing and more oil leaks onto his hand, it is warm and smells so good; like Steve and warmth and goodness. Steve’s moans turn into whimpers and he stretches out his wings further. He first started with the joint at the top of the right wing and Steve purred. that’s right, purred, like a fucking cat. Steve was in a different world as Tony moved to the next wing. When he finished, he got up and Steve let out a little sad huff of air, still coming down from the high of chemicals that were pumped into his brain.
“We need a shower.” Steve’s voice echoed in his sleep muddled mind. He let out a whiny noise and buried his face further in the warm feathers. He felt Steve chuckle.
“Sir, there appears to be an atmospheric disturbance above the Tower. Given the speed at which the storm arrived in it is not likely to be of natural causes.”
“I don’t know Tony,” Bruce trailed off as he examined Steve and Bucky where they had passed out on top of each other, if it weren’t for the circumstances Tony knew it was for, they would be cute, but the subtle way that you could see the stress on Bucky’s face and how Steve had him pinned tells another story. “I need to get them down in the lab to run some tests but from what I can tell they were in some form of rut. A hormone panel will hopefully tell me more.”
“the incident that resulted in the wings is confidential and S.H.I.E.L.D. has not allowed us to talk about it.”
“Steve, I want you to answer honestly to a few questions. I promise that I will not tell anyone and i won't laugh or whatever you think i will do, do you trust me?”
“Sir is currently in the common room kitchen cooking with Mr. Barnes, would you like me to give him a message?”
“Ugh.” Tony smartly exclaimed but had the brain cells left to reach up and cup her breasts. Steve raised herself again and sat back, starting a rhythm and fucking herself on Tony’s cock.
“What were you thinking about?” His voice was quiet and soft like a child. Loki tensed. “I mean, only if you want to. You just looked so… I don't know. Never mind, its stupid.” Steve ducked his head and made a move to get out of Loki’s lap, but he held his arms fast and kept the man from getting up. He took a breath and began stroking through Steve’s hair once again.
“What do you mean ‘I'm sorry’ you did nothing Steve; it was all my fault. You were not yourself, I took advantage. I-I raped you,” Steve lunged forward and pulled Tony into his arms. Tony was a horrible, selfish man so he melted into Steve’s embrace, clinging to him even though he deserved nothing of the sort.
“I liked it,” Steve’s neck and ears went pink and Bucky knew that tone, that was the tone Steve used when he liked something that he thinks he can’t or shouldn’t. The same tone he had used when Bucky had caught him outside the queer bar getting beat up by some fucker that was calling him a fairy. “Ok? there, I said it. Can I leave now?”
“What the Fuck are you idiots doing?” Tony went over to the coffee maker and poured himself a cup, drained it in one large gulp and whacked Clint off of the top of the fridge.
“See, it's so much better when you accept what you want. remember how we could barely walk for a week after Jack.” Steven groans at Rogers’ words and tries to bury his face in the pillows, but Tony pushes in and his whole-body crests with the pleasure that he feels.
A few moments later Loki let out a small gasp, he lowered his hands to touch where they had been hovering for a few moments longer than anywhere else on Steve’s body. Steve’s hands reflexively clenched in the soft fur, worrying it between his fingers. he made eye contact with the god, frantically searching his face for anything that might tell him what is was. Loki’s eyes softened and he rubbed circles into Steve’s abdomen.
warning there is some pretty graphic explanation of what Steve does to some HYDRA dicks that took Tony.
"Well... I've kind of sort of broken Steve" Bruce winced at the way Tony's head whipped towards him.
“shit.” Steve looked down the front of her pants contemplating waking someone up for help but figured that neither Tony or Bucky would be any use for this situation and the only females in the tower were Natasha and possibly Pepper, the former Steve was pretty sure was going to maul her when she found out what happened and the latter was always so busy.
“I'm not going to disagree with that point, but the other one couldn’t be farther from the truth, Tony needs you Steve. I had to carry him to bed because he fell asleep on the couch crying for you, he thought you were hurt or brainwashed by Loki, and you didn’t want him anymore.” Steve looked up at her stunned by what she was saying. “he loves you Steve, it hurts him to see you hurt, he didn’t know what happened to you, and the way you ran away from him...”
The flash had awoken Bucky and he came bounding over to the bed, nearly tripping Bruce as he pushed him out of the way to get to Steve. He took one look and turned around to face Loki, Steve was confused, Bucky had his murder face on like he did when he was the soldier. He attacked Loki, Steve lunged forward in the bed but got light headed and fell back into the bed where Bruce was getting up and looking over him.
“Yeah, I’m gonna agree with you on that.” Tony was trying to figure out what to do. Steve let his head fall onto Tony’s shoulder, his arms still holding his body off of Tony so not to crush him. Tony still had his legs wrapped around Steve’s hips. He raised his arms and hugged Steve rubbing at his back, tracing the seam between his wings and Steve’s skin trying to soothe the larger man.
When they all reached the training room, Steve was not happy. His wings were pulled tight to his sides the scraps from his shirt were still hanging off of him. He had his arms crossed defiantly across his chest.
“Your name is James Buchanan Barnes, but I call you Bucky. Is it ok if I call you that?” the soldier mouthed the words to himself, James. He had a name, weapons didn't have names. that meant that he was person, just like Steve was a person.
“It looks like they used Barbiturates to sedate you after missions and calm the soldier when he got out of hand, that way they could keep him from acting out against them, then when he had a mission, they would pump him full of Amphetamines and just about every other stimulant drug out there,” Bruce’s brow furrowed as he flipped through the pages. “The drugs would explain the previous inability to have an erection, now I know this is sensitive but can you tell me if while you were at HYDRA, did they ever touch you or used your body in a sexual way?” Bucky’s eyes were scrunched in confusion, trying to remember what happened to him. While he thought, Tony asked Bruce some questions about the various drugs that had been in his blood and what would happen now that he was off to them.
“Come ‘ere, ya’ punk.” Steve just about flew into Bucky’s arms, Bucky first wrapped his arms around his shoulders and then he wrapped his wings around both of their body's as Steve's form shook in his arms. “We are gonna be ok. You said it yourself, we are going to get Strange or Thor, hell, if it comes to it, I'll go an’ find us a fae and convince them to help us.” as Bucky spoke, he petted the feathers on Steve’s back, Bucky’s voice rumbled in his chest where Steve had buried his face, he smiled at the reference to fae, his ma had told the both of them stories about them from when she was a little girl living in Ireland, Steve had become obsessed with them for a period, it was all he would draw. He enjoyed giving his mother's stories pictures and that was the first time he thought of what he wanted to do when he grew up.
“готовы соблюдать” Bucky’s voice was ruff and sounded unused. Loki shifted and Steve flinched, he had completely forgotten that Loki was there.
“This was supposed to be a surprise but because of the circumstances I guess you should know.” Tony sighed and walked over to Bucky’s bed, he sat at the foot and took the metal arm in his hands. “This isn’t the only thing I did some work on.” Tony turned to Steve and gave him a smile. “Buck, tell me about what Steve was like before the serum.” Energy seemed to fill Tony up as he asked the question and his smile only grew, with the shocked and slightly frightened look on Steve’s face.
Steve leaned in and licked Tony from base to tip, he took the head in his mouth and swirled his tongue around the slit tasting the salty bitter flavor that was all Tony. Above him Tony moaned in his sleep. Steve smiled around the length in his mouth and pulled off so he could trace the vein that was on the underside with his tongue. He stopped just before the head and then sucked on the frenulum. Another moan was heard from above and Steve took Tony in his hand again as he moved to his balls. Steve licked at the seam between them on Tony's sac, then he sucked them into his mouth, one after the other. Steve pulled off and kissed Tony's inner thigh before going back to his straining cock. He licked broad striped up him and took Tony's full length into his mouth.
Steve has been surprisingly submissive since last night and Bucky wants to ask about it, but he knows when not to look the gift horse in the mouth, and trying to get a stubborn bull-headed Steve to get his wound looked at would be hell, so it will have to wait until after he cleans up the wound.
“Dude, what's it like having tits!” Clint's sudden exclamation in the silent room broke the silence after Steve started laughing, she bent over in pain from the laughter at the looks on her friends faces. She straightened up and wiped a tear from her eyes.
Tony shot into the sky and circled around the park getting a count and location of all the Hydra agents spread around. The team was doing well, most of the agents had been taken into custody and their guns confiscated for Tony to look at later. There was one thing wrong, Steve was missing.
“I never would have guessed,” said Tony.  He paused as the waiter, who had a strong jaw, badly cut reddish hair, and a sullen expression, pulled out a well chewed pencil and held it poised over an order pad.
A wisp of steam rose from the tunnels underneath Atlas as the lights changed and the two men started across the street.  Neither was in range to smell the faint trace of ozone in the smoke, or see the tiny hint of a smile play about the great statue’s lips.
“This is actually good.”  Tony took a second bite of his turkey burger, chewed, and swallowed.  The cranberry ketchup had a nice bite to it and the ground turkey was fresh and flavorful.  “Much better than that turkey-flavored fake bacon you brought back from your last grocery run.”
“Ross wasn't even there.”  Steve took a step forward, even though the rational part of his brain knew he and Tony had to be invisible.  “He was at Fort Hamilton during the Chitauri attack.”
“That’s a very good question, young man,” said a strong, deep voice from somewhere above him.   Steve reflexively jerked away from the plinth and fell into a defensive stance, every muscle suddenly tense.  What was going on?
Thus endeth the tale of mighty Stephanos, Knight of the Star, and his sweet friend Antonius, King of Graymarie and Knight of Adamant. May all who read it rejoice in the knowledge that friendship and true hearts may overcome all obstacles, and that they who serve land and people with faithful intent are blessed of God and beloved by men.
The land thrived and was at peace for many years. Harvests were rich and plentiful, and soon scholars of renown came to Graymarie to grace her court and instruct her people in the knowledge of God and the wisdom of the past. The great nunnery of Our Lady of Perpetual Liberty was raised as a thank offering by Margaret the Lady Knight after her marriage to Sir Gabriel and her safe delivery of their daughter, known as the Rose of Sharon for her beauty, and soon the finest sculptors and artisans of the land came to adorn the cloisters. Graymarie was spoken of throughout the world, and her Captain accounted as wise and just a ruler as any in Christendom.
“Ah, don’t deny it.  The weight of responsibility, the grief at your losses – they weigh far too heavy on your shoulders, broad as they are.  You question whether you should even walk about the world at all, or if you should have stayed frozen where neither Zeus nor Hades has sway.”
“We were still doing the headless chicken thing,” Tony murmured.  The boy was young enough that a sobbing woman who seemed to be his aunt was burying him in his Little League uniform.  “Plus, you were the only one who thought about getting civilians into the subway tunnels, at least till the Mayor got involved.  Park Avenue was a shooting gallery by then, and don’t even ask about the café under the viaduct.”
Antonius was wounded sore in body, and his heart was heavy with the loss of his parents, for he had loved his mother dearly and also his father despite King Huard's jealousy and scorn. Even so, he directed James and Ginevra to make them a sledge of willow branches to bear the Dragon’s head and tasked Felix Pugilisticus to harness the remaining horses to the same. Only when this work was done did he allow his own hurts to be tended, after which the party did set out for Graymarie’s city to display the proof of his triumph to the people.
And so the years passed, in Graymarie as in the world. Those who came after would not take the title of Captain, so it was that Stephanos was succeeded in time by kings and queens, as in other realms. None was followed by their own child, as it was deemed fitting that the land should be ruled only by one acceptable to the people and willing to subordinate all pride to the service of Graymarie, as had Stephanos himself.
“Nuh-uh, my idea, my snacks.”  There was more scuffling, and a muffled yip from the battered Heinz 57 dog Clint had dragged in from Bed-Stuy.  “Good boy, Lucky!  Good boy!  Sic ‘em!”
…then darkness fell upon the land, for as greatly as Huard had desired an heir, so all too soon did he find his son wanting and treat him ill. The prince, endowed with all the gifts of mind and body, did sense his father’s animus and lost himself in the pleasures of the flesh and idle sports. The King sent his own confessor, Bishop Obadiah, to remonstrate with the youth and remind him of the fear of God and the risk to his soul of such debauchery, yet his warnings did fall upon deaf ears as the Prince grew to manhood….
“What?”  Steve’s robe disappeared in a swish of cloth.  Warm, ozone-heavy steam rose from the fissure to cover his nakedness.  “You – “
A Teutonic Knight of dark reputation, born Johann Schmidt but called Caput Rufus for his fiery countenance, turned his eyes to Graymarie after suffering defeat in the Rus and resolved to strip her of her riches and enslave her people for his own profit. Long since forsworn before God and men, it was said that by his practice of alchemy and evil rites, he had acquired the strength of ten mighty men, which made him all but invincible. His foul and blasphemous campaigns had so blighted the land that the Princes of the Rus had had to ally themselves with the Mohammedan hordes of the steppes to provide their people with grain and meat and firewood for the long cold winter.
He hissed as he read the glowing white numbers:  a few minutes before 2200.  Even on his Harley, even running, it was far too late to get down to Alphabet City in time for Mass, even if he’d been dressed and ready to go.   He took a deep breath – how had he lost over an hour?  - shoved the blankets aside, and stood up.
Steve came awake with a jerk.  Tony, in a dark topcoat and a Russian-style hat that would have looked better on Natasha,  knelt beside him on the sidewalk.
“Communal floor, please.”  Steve waited for the elevator door to open, then stepped inside and leaned against the mirror-bright wall.  He tensed at how cold the metal felt against his back, but it was only a couple of floors.  He’d be fine.  “Thanks.”
“You sure about that?”  Tony arched a nicely groomed eyebrow at the touch, as if he couldn’t quite allow himself to believe that Steve was flirting with him.  “I didn’t know you liked – “
“Capra?  You mean the guy with the Motion Picture Unit?” Steve brushed the frond aside, or started to.  It was oddly warm to the touch.  “He directed me in a couple of shorts, but  – “
The only darkness to mar this peaceful time came soon after Antonius was crowned. The former confessor to King Huard, Bishop Obadiah, attempted to reclaim his place at court, stating that the King was still not of age and thus he should be regent. The councils of state would have none of this, for Antonius had proved himself more than worthy of the crown, and Obadiah repaired himself to his estates, muttering and complaining that Antonius was ungrateful and unfit to rule. And dark rumors of plots and counterplots soon sprang up about the Bishop, even whispers that he had consorted with demons of the East to summon the Dragon hence to kill King and Queen and Prince alike, so as to leave only the Bishop to rule the land.
“I am going to start with the right side again, so can you open that wing please,” Bucky opened his wing and Tony studied it to make sure no feathers got damaged when Bucky went on his rampage around the apartment. Everything was still in place so he picked up the damp washcloth and held it up to Bucky’s wing. “First I am going to wash off all the dirt and stuff,” Tony waited until Bucky ducked his head in acknowledgement and then he carefully touched the wet cloth to the feathers on the top of Bucky’s wing, Bucky had a whole body shutter and then his wing ‘fwapped’ out fully just like Steve’s had done, but he kept the left wing pulled securely around his body. It took a while to work all the dirt (that's what Tony was calling it, he didn't even want to know what else might be dirtying Bucky’s wings) out of the feathers, but once he was done the colors of Bucky’s wings stood out more and, look at that, he was right, the cream color was white under all that dirt.
The next pair was plain and pink cotton that Steve liked better, the only thing was the color. It hurt her eyes to look at and she couldn’t imagine the color not showing through any pants that she might be wearing.
“Sor-Sorry, for interrupting... I'll just…” Steven started to run-walk off in the direction of his room when he was pinned against the wall. Rogers leaned into Steven and he could feel his arousal pushed into the dip of his back as Rogers spoke into his ear.
Back at the tower Tony was listening in through the bugs he put on the jet but Jarvis, that sneaky son of a bitch, didn't let anything through. (Wait did that make him the bitch?)
“At first yes, but to be in a state of constant arousal for approximately 7-10 days will get old after a while. It is also likely that manual stimulation will not fully alleviate the symptoms given your… unique anatomy.” Steve and Tony winced. Bucky just looked confused, they really needed to have a talk with him about the other body changes that happen with the wings. Steve doesn’t think that Bucky will enjoy popping a knot for the first time like he did and completely flipping out, possibly hurting himself and his partner.
“There is movement inside. Ironman, scan and scout the building for other entrances. Widow and Hawkeye, you two get on the roof and work your magic. Thor you will come with me.” the team each took off in their respective directions as soon as they got them.
It turns out being Tortured and used as HYDRA's asset for 70 years had its benefits, in the form of knowing almost all the HYDRA bases all over the world. Bucky cross referenced the locations he knew with what Steve had been able to find through cameras and money trails, this led him to a abandoned warehouse in New Jersey,
“I don’t know Tony,” Steve ran a hand anxiously through his hair. “How about I make an announcement before movie night tomorrow?”
Steve let out a long moan, his voice an octave lower and broken when he answered.“yes.” his voice made a shiver go down Tony’s spine.
“I promise you Steve,” Tony pulled back enough to make eye contact, “I promise that I will do everything in my power to help, in any way that I can. Be that spending my money researching ways to help with whatever Hydra did to him, or just to be next to you and help you both through this.” Steve pulled Tony close to him again and sobbed into his shoulder, Tony stood holding him even after his back started to protest to staying in this position for so long, he meant what he said, he would do everything to make Steve happy, even if that meant losing him.
Steve reached behind herself and took Tony in her hand, then in one smooth movement she took him fully until she sat flush with his hips.
Rogers abruptly pulled away and slapped Steven’s ass before he sauntered to the couch and plopped down, he put his legs up on the table and flicked the Tv on. “I think I'll have a beer with my eggs.” he called out without turning from the Tv, it wasn’t a question. Steven turned and dished out a plate of eggs and then stopped at the fridge to pull a beer out and walked it to Rogers.
“See, that's not so bad now, is it.” Tony’s face had that smug look on it that Steve hated, but the look of his abused red lips and the gleam saliva on his chin in the low light was distraction enough from the expression and he clenched his muscles experimentally around Tony’s fingers. Tony grinned to himself and curled his forefinger in a come-hither action and a wave of pure pleasure shot through Steve’s body. It felt like electricity through his spine and his dick jumped at its place against his abs as it steadily leaked precome into the muscular dips of Steve’s stomach. Tony bent over and licked up the mess before he pulled his fingers out of Steve.
Clint was on top of the refrigerator with an arrow on his bow, pointed at Loki who was lounging on the couch looking like the cat that got the canary. Natasha was on the other side of the room with a large blade in one hand and her other stretched out to push Bruce towards the elevator. The best part of all of it was everyone was in their lounge wear, Clint had purple polka dotted fuzzy pants and bare feet, Natasha had a black tank top and large grey sweatpants. Tony rubbed at His temples to help with the caffeine headache that wasn’t being helped by Clint's yelling.
“J, pull up The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. You know which page I mean.” Tony stilled and crossed his arms in Bucky’s lap as Jarvis pulled up the site and read off the information.
“Hey! lovebirds, lunch is ready!” Someone (Clint) called from below. Steve held on to his waist and Tony clasped his arms around his neck as Steve tipped off the beam into a free fall before opening his wings and gliding down. When they reached the ground, Steve kissed Tony again groping his ass and then started towards the door.
“That's playing dirty! Steve help me here, that's not allowed!” Bucky sounded just like he did when he would go running to his mother because Becca had cheated at their game.
Steve reached back to trace the new appendage. He shivered when his fingers made contact it was so soft (also a little sticky from the blood and god knows what else) and sensitive.
“It was the only way to stop his body from killing him. He is fine.” Tony was stroking Bucky’s wing joint and fixing his hair
Steve woke up, not in the car where she had fallen asleep, but in the bed she shared with the two loves of her life, both of which were curled around her in sleep. She looked down and noticed that she was still in the clothes from yesterday, the bra digging into her ribs but the softness of the shirt felt nice against the smooth planes of her stomach. It was nice to be able to lay on her back without her wings getting in the way.
trigger warning there is brief talk about the sexual abuse Bucky experienced from HYDRA but it is only mentioned once and never actually talks about what happend, it you are triggered by this please be careful. I am not sure but it is also likely that I will go into detail about Bucky's time with HYDRA later on in the story. please be safe and I hope you enjoy!
“Now, how about we go get a few minutes of sleep, because I don’t know about you, but I haven’t slept the best without you there beside me.” Steve nodded and moved toward the bedroom that Tony had kept away from all week, as he took off his shirt to crawl into the large California King beside Tony he called out to J.A.R.V.I.S.
Steven dropped his things and pushed the guest bedroom door open to find Rogers standing with his pants around his thighs. Rogers caught his eye and grinned his hand tightened in the short brown curls of Tony's hair where he was on his knees, his head bobbed and rogers groaned again and pulled Tony’s head down again. Steven made a high-pitched sound kind of like stepping on a cat and he could tell that Tony now knew that he was here.
“I think you will be difficult to work with, how about I set a few rules. Rule number one, you don’t get to cum till I let you. Rule number two, you only get what I give you. Rule number three, you will do as say with no question, rule number four, you will follow the rule or you will face punishment.” Toy nodded agreement but the hand came down once again on his ass. “You will respond with ‘Yes, Sir’ or ‘No, Sir’ when asked a question, capiche?”
