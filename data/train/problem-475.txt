Sherlock groaned in approval, eagerly helping John up to his feet.
“I'm busy,” Sherlock gave a curt reply without making a move to face him.
It was so surreal.
Sherlock and John host a little Christmas party to celebrate with their friends.
Of course, life didn't let him enjoy their snuggle, as no matter how much he fought against it, his full bladder made itself known with unbearable intensity. Cautiously and reluctantly, he disentangled himself from the soundly sleeping doctor. Tossing the melted ice-pack from his ankle aside, he watched John's peaceful expression for any sign of waking. But John didn't notice his bedfellow leaving, just nuzzled his face into Sherlock's pillow and carried on sleeping contently.
“I want to be sober when I touch you tonight,” Sherlock whispered huskily.
Sherlock stared at him incredulously. “You think I’m appealing?” He asked tentatively, searching his friend’s eyes closely.
“So... that's what we are now...? Officially?” Sherlock stammered, hope rising in his chest.
a little inside voice added.
"The great detective misses the details at times." Seeing that his friend still doesn't get his drift, John continued. "You see, but you don't observe ..." Sherlock searched the doctor's eyes for a clue. "You deduce that I might not be against the idea of sleeping with you, but you take my words of refusal for granted. Isn't there a contradiction?"
His hand sneaked to John's backside and cupped the firm arse. John groaned and broke away abruptly. Sherlock froze in motion and blinked in confusion, fear flashing through him. “Have I done something not good?”
“You want to convince yourself of that? Try harder,” Sherlock countered with a brittle smile. “You aren’t worried that I don’t want this, you are scared that I do. You don't believe you could be an equal partner to me. You doubt that I could ever feel something for you.” His gaze never left the doctor's. “But you are so wrong.”
So, while Sherlock didn’t know what exactly it was that he felt for John, he knew it was a ‘first day’ thing, if anything like that existed at all.
Any other time, Sherlock might have retorted with some arrogant remark, but now his mind was occupied with pondering the result of the equation of their night plus John’s intention to stay plus his newfound approach on emotions and where that could lead to.
“Christ, Sherlock...” John rubbed his face forlornly.
This was getting more and more unreal. He should pinch himself to see if he wasn’t dreaming.
Sherlock blinked rapidly, trying to process John’s answer. “So you’re not…”
John swallowed hard. “You don't have to do it,” he said hoarsely as their gazes met.
How will they get back to the mansion and what happens to Sherlock? The answers are here.
This chapter's triggers: graphic description of a HIV/AIDS patient's condition and the progress of the illness.
Poor Barnaby didn’t notice how much he was spilling about the family, John thought. Lady Isabelle surely wouldn’t approve it, but for them, it came in handy.
John had never been happier for Sherlock saying ‘obviously’.
“...start dating you, I am going to want more than just crumbs of your attention.”
A warm smile appeared on John's face. "See, you have feelings for me. You're not that emotionless as you think you are." He sneaked his hand into Sherlock's, intertwining their fingers.
Heavy sobs shook his body, while hot tears streamed down his cheeks. He didn’t want to wake Sherlock, the detective shouldn’t see him like this. John couldn’t face him asking questions right now and he definitely didn’t want Sherlock worry about him.
A happy glow lit up John's eyes, and he opened his mouth to say something, but Sherlock cut in with a smile.
“That...” Sherlock mumbled, but he couldn’t go on, the unshed tears burning his throat and eyes.
“You... what?” Sherlock kept staring at him, his eyes widening incredulously.
“Pardon?”
“I have to go,” John sighed in resignation, apparently giving up on making Sherlock talk to him.
Unpacking the groceries, John couldn't help but noticing the immaculate kitchen-table. No experiments today, yay, he noted. But the discovery also meant that it was very unlikely that Sherlock ate anything that day. Nothing new, John sighed.
“Yes... that...”
Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
Again thanks to my betas, Lucie, Mimi and Donna, but especially nutmeag83 for her suggestions and support. If there's any mistakes left, it's my bad, apologies.
“Yet you never countered either, when he brought us a candle.”
“Unless you have some case to work on,” John shifted nervously, “what about going out somewhere? Our first date?” He blushed a little at the last bit.
Till laterz! :) xx
“Are you serious?” John still couldn’t wrap his head around what was going on.
Sorry for this being a bit shorter than usual, but this scene needed its own chapter.
“In this very moment, yes,” John added patiently.
However, finding the detective watching porn was something new.
“There's nothing to thank me for,” John uttered softly, caressing a pale hand.
Sherlock sighed. John’s soft pleading broke his resistance. There was no way back, he had to do the hardest thing in his life—baring his heart. He had to take the leap now that he stepped onto the ledge, the only question was whether he would survive the fall.
“But you love danger,” the doctor smirked. Licking his lips, he grabbed the lapels of the shirt and pulled down the young man onto himself again.
“What's wrong?”
like what he feels by the end of the night...
“Sherlock,” John tried to get the man’s attention in a quiet, composed voice. “We need to talk.”
A quiet whimper caught his ear, and his movements ceased abruptly. Had he hurt John? Was the scar still that painful that even the light pressure of his lips caused distress? He jerked his head up, seeing tears in the corner of John’s eyes
John snickered.
, he gritted his teeth.
Sherlock snorted. “Oh, John, will you ever get tired of saying that? It's really very boring.”
“Seriously, John, a selfie?” Sherlock raised a brow.
John gave him a warm, satisfied smile. “Good.”
"Say 'John, I appreciate your interest, but I'm married to my work', or 'Thank you, John, but you're not my type'. Anything?"
“No, it's not!” Sherlock countered vehemently, giving a fleeting glance to the army fatigues John wore. While at other times he found the apparel exciting, now he hated it because it symbolised that the army was taking John away from him. “You belong here.”
, he thought as he bit his lip fearfully and gently tilted Sherlock’s head toward himself, caressing the hot face with his thumb. “I'm back. I've got help.”
He, who dismissed sexual interaction and was disgusted by its mere mechanics, was just about to engage in oral sex of his own volition. It was a milestone in his life—changing perspective, defeating inhibitions and aversions, breaking free from the restraints of a young boy, shaking off the shackles of his insecurities. Was he strong enough to do this?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Obviously.”
“Not again,” John groaned. “What dark secret do you still keep and think this is the right time to share?”
Sherlock arched into the touch, finding the sensation unexpectedly delightful. He never knew that some stimuli to his nipples could elicit such a pleasant feeling. He jolted and stifled a cry when a hot mouth suddenly replaced sturdy fingers, sucking lightly.
Before some of you might get upset on my approach on John's sexuality, this is my take on the issue in this fic. Some people reject the idea of him being "gay for only Sherlock", so if this concept isn't your cup of tee, please, just accept it here and don't come at me, telling me off. I respect everyone's opinion; but please, John is just a fictional character. I'm open to civilised discussion, but no flaming, thank you.
His limbs trembled, anger buzzing in the nerve endings, and he just couldn't sit still. Jumping up, he started pacing around the room, high on self-reproach. His mind raced, images of the night before and this morning flashing with high speed, evoking contradictory feelings in a fraction of a second, making him dizzy. His head felt like it would explode under the contrast of anger and affection, the different emotions overwhelming his body with so much force that he thought that his veins would rip apart under his skin.
“So what now?” John's hand enveloped Sherlock's. “Shall we tell it to our friends, or let them figure it out on their own?”
John Watson found himself not being able to tear his gaze away from those bright uniquely blue coloured eyes that were waiting for an answer. An answer to a question he hadn't expected to hear, let alone to reply.
Many thanks to everyone who stuck with me till the end, special thank you to my faithful readers (you know who you are)! Again, thank you for nutmeag83 for the beta-work and support! I owe it all to you! If there's any mistakes, that's mine, apologies!
Chapter title: Saliva - Forever And A Day
The detective nodded. “I am. I want to make it up to you for the incident with the recording.”
But, obviously, John didn't share the sentiment about him, his words gave it away.
“I wasn't joking,“ Sherlock remarked flippantly, pulling an innocent look.
“Invite me in?”
The song Sherlock danced to was Don Henley's 'Boys of Summer' :)
“Mmm,” John smiled, sliding the silky material off of the detective's arms. “We're quite a pair.”
Again thanks a lot to my betas; any mistakes left, that's my bad.
The detective stopped playing and lowered the instrument with a huff.
No matter how awkward this could be, they needed to talk. They couldn’t live with each other under the same roof without clearing the situation. John needed to know Sherlock’s motivation and how would that affect their future. He just hoped that such a crazy interlude wouldn’t put a wedge in their friendship. Sherlock was important to him, he didn’t want to lose him for a silly, drunken mistake.
John had never felt that alive. When Sherlock filled him, shaking wildly, John found release along with him, in perfect sync, shivering in pleasure. His whole body was overloaded with sensations; he couldn't tell where he began and ended.
Their banter was interrupted by Angelo coming up to them with a bottle of red wine.
“You aren't.” John's warm hand cupped his cheek softly. “This is real– as real as it can be.”
This chapter is free of angst - finally? :D -, so just sit back and enjoy the Johnlock holiday edition!
“Shh.” His free hand sneaked up to the pale, moon-lit face and cupped it gently. John’s breathing turned shallow, and his heart thumped louder in his chest. His eyes fell on the perfect lips, before finding the twinkling silver-blue eyes once again. Sherlock stared back at him with dilated pupils and slightly parted lips.
Sherlock smiled solemnly and, snuggling up to John, drew idle circles on the toned chest, mapping out every tiny bump, storing them in John's wing in his mind palace.
Thank you for the kind feedback on the prev chapter - love you all! x
He quickly changed into his pyjamas and brushed his teeth, his thoughts on James all along. John Watson had made a promise, and he wasn’t going to break it.
Sherlock gazed at him, wordlessly swallowing the hot tears. He couldn’t convince John to stay, that was clear as day. The physical hurt of helplessness was agonising, but there was nothing he could do. Nothing but wait for the day when John would return to him.
He splashed some cold water on his face, hoping it would help him look less like a zombie.
“Exactly. Well, would you ask me again, I–” Sherlock placed his hand on John's tentatively. His deep and slightly hoarse voice was both anxious and hopeful.
Well, my lovelies, here's the chapter everyone has been waiting for, I guess... ;)
The contrast of the damaged skin and smooth torso was vivid; the knotted, healed tissue like a miniature octopus stretched its tentacles on the cream-coloured flesh. Anger rose in Sherlock's guts.
But what felt even more unreal was that—concluding from those hazy little snippets coming back the night before—John had willingly played along and seemingly enjoyed their inebriated trip on the wild side.
John gaped at his friend dumbfounded, his mouth parting slightly.
How can he be so indifferent, the doctor huffed.
Miracles happen on Christmas Eve...
"You are my friend, so you definitely like me. You're also amazed by me according to the frequent use of words 'brilliant', 'fantastic' and 'amazing'." He was circling him while speaking. "As for the physical attraction, you like me wearing that purple shirt, I can tell from the stolen glances that you give me when you think I can't see you. Occasionally, you watch me while I'm lying on the couch with eyes closed, and with your ordinary brain - no offence - I doubt you're reading me there. You haven't had a date for weeks, so unless you wanked in the shower, you haven't had release for a while."
”You can't believe what an honour it is having you here tonight. My saviour and his date. Oh, pure happiness!” Angelo gushed. “And look, it's snowing!” he exclaimed, pointing at the dancing snowflakes on the other side of the window.
And then Sherlock knew.
“Of course, we have to record that,” Sherlock added innocently.
“I used to pretend to have no heart, detached myself from emotions that could have hindered my focus on my work, but...” Sherlock nervously ran a hand through his hair. “Since you came, I am not the person I used to be. Day by day, I had to realize that—when it comes to you—I can't keep ignoring forever the fact that, by default, I'm a human being with feelings. You are changing me. I try to shut out the world of emotions, but when it's about you, I can't anymore. Which is ridiculous, because you are just an ordinary man wasting the capacity of his mind, constantly caring about others' opinions, yet it seems I just can't withdraw myself from your power...”
John gave him a warm, appreciative look. “Don't worry about me, love,” he smiled affectionately, using the endearment for the first time during the time of their relationship. “A soldier here, remember? God save anyone hurting you in any way.”
John gently caressed the detective’s cold cheek. “My pleasure. So, does the Christmas experiment end with success?”
“That's bloody fantastic,” John beamed. “
(See the end of the chapter for
Although they had been given separate rooms, John stayed with Sherlock in the detective’s room; he just couldn't leave the sick man on his own. Once they entered the room, John switched immediately into doctor-mode and gave Sherlock some pills to bring his fever down before filling the tub with lukewarm water and escorting the shivering man into the bathroom. Undressing him carefully—refraining from sneaking glances at Sherlock's intimate bits and staring at the fine, sinewy body—he carefully helped Sherlock into the tub.
John had never been more confused in his life. Part of him wanted to have sex with Sherlock again, and remember it too, but another part hit the breaks, calling for a halt. He couldn’t bear losing Sherlock and his friendship if that arrangement didn’t work.
“Oh yes,” John groaned, his eyes darkening with lust.
With eyes closed, he recalled the fragmented, blurry memories of the night before and the
Turning his head slightly, he found Sherlock's sparkling quicksilver eyes smiling at him. The most mesmerising eyes in the whole world—the different shades of blue, green and grey blending artfully underneath the golden flecks in Sherlock’s irises.
Sherlock hoped that favouring his mouth to the lubricant didn't fall into the category of 'bit not good'.
“When I suggested repeating last night, I didn't mean having you just for intercourse.”
The morning after John returns. Sherlock explains the Beresford case, John makes a declaration and comes up with a suggestion that'd change their daily routine...
“Sherlock…” John called his name quietly.
Thank you for the kudos, comments and bookmarks, my dears!
"John hadn't seen anything more sensual than Sherlock devouring the heavenly dessert from his hand. There was something very sexy about feeding chocolaty stuff to Sherlock Holmes. The man indulging in such an ordinary, dull aspect of life—like enjoying the wonders of food, which was almost always utterly beneath him—mesmerized John. It was such a rare sight that, had he had a mind palace, he surely would have stored the image there. The appreciative sounds leaving the detective's throat also were something to relish and remember."
During the time by the detective's side both as an assistant and friend, they had forged a bond, a strong, unique companionship that went beyond the usual boundaries of friendship. It was a rare, special connection based on mutual trust, respect, acceptance and devotion, something John had never had with anyone before. An exhilarating bond that turned his days warmer, brighter, and made his life worth living again. He had a reason for waking up in the morning and looking forward the to each day, knowing that he mattered to someone. Even if that often meant fetching things or unknowingly being involved in the ridiculous experiments of his infuriating flatmate. Unlike many others, Sherlock didn't see the invalid ex-soldier in him, pitying him, but considered him a valuable man, relying on his opinion and skills. The detective had entered his life when he had needed help the most. Without him, John Watson might have not be alive. Sherlock Holmes saved him from making a grand mistake and gave him a purpose. And John Watson was eternally grateful for all that.
“Not now, please,” John's pleaded in shame, grabbing Sherlock's hand. “Please,” the indigo eyes begged him.
And lastly, I apologise for the delay of this chapter, I couldn't update yesterday due to unforeseen circumstances.
“Don't be alarmed, John,” Sherlock reassured him. “It's just a one-time thing, I rarely use it.”
Sherlock never got tired of hearing his blogger complimenting him. “That's your effect, you make me,” he smiled.
“Ahh, you feel so good,” John panted. “Almost there–”
John had protested.
But that still didn’t explain why had he suddenly found himself unaffected by the beautiful woman, even when she stood stark naked in front of him. That was unlike Three Continents Watson. More disturbing was the fact that he sent lingering glances toward Sherlock at the same time and experienced the unmistakable signs of jealousy of the Woman whenever she had got the detective’s attention. It was plain to see that Sherlock had been intrigued by and drawn to her, and John hated that. He hated how their dynamic had been disturbed by a third party (was it how Sherlock felt about John’s dates too?). He loved the life the two of them shared, and he didn’t want to lose that or change it in any way.
“What benefits?” Sherlock raised a brow, looking uncharacteristically clueless.
Breaking away from John’s lips, his mouth moved over to his neck and breathed a kiss onto the inviting, creamy skin. Licking and nuzzling the soft flesh, Sherlock saved the tiniest pieces of information he observed in his mind palace. Kissing John’s skin was nothing like kissing his lips—not better or worse, it was intriguing and exciting, but in a different way. Sherlock couldn’t choose, he loved both.
John wondered. Sherlock Holmes wasn’t interested in sex. John could never decide though if the detective refused to act on the primal desires only because the act distracted him from focusing on the Work, or because he was asexual by nature. He could hear Sherlock reprimanding him,
Sherlock gazed his lover's eyes for a long moment before speaking. “I love you, John Watson.”
Moaning at the sensation, John's fingers dived into the mop of Sherlock's dark curls, enjoying the feel of the cool, silky hair on his heated skin.
John was going to come back. The story of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson had only just begun.
Picking up his violin eventually, he played some loud, vehement, stray notes, before the sound gradually calmed into an an improvised, sad, slow melody.
Sherlock's mouth curved into a wide, happy smile, something John hadn’t seen before. Sherlock was about to lean in and kiss him, but a moment’s apprehension had John stopping him.
It wasn't enough. Sherlock slid the shirt off of John's shoulders, his admiring eyes taking in the toned torso—every muscle in the right place, not bulky, but visibly trained. His mind’s eye could see the dog tags hanging over the fine chest and the olive waistband of the military trousers hugging the strong body.
"I'm not wrapped in ribbon, but if you want, I can be your Christmas present," Sherlock breathed a small kiss onto John's mouth.
Sherlock drank in the happy glow on John's face, the pure, innocent, childlike enthusiasm for such an ordinary thing like snow warming his insides. An odd, unusual sensation flared up in his chest. His heart overflowed with warmth and genuine delight, some intense, selfless feeling that he had never experienced before John entered his life. Why did he suddenly feel such ease and satisfaction about someone else's joy? He used to experience such contentment only at developments that favoured his interest and things that stimulated him in a positive way, mentally or physically—never for someone else. And now, here he was, amazed by John's silly joy for something as tedious as snow. Why? Was it because he couldn't be arsed to appreciate those tedious things himself? Or was it a side effect of being in love? Whatever the reason was, it felt surprisingly good. He loved seeing John happy, more than being glad himself. The feeling corresponded to the thrill that drugs could elicit. Gazing at the doctor's radiant face, he made a mental note that from now on his priority was going to be ensuring John's happiness.
“You're right, they are boring,” the detective shrugged. “Not very inventive, not even Lestrade...”
John smiled and raised his glass of bubbling champagne.
"Your heart beats faster than normal, which indicates excitement. No case to work on, no thrilling news, so the reason is something else. What could cause such a reaction right now? Obvious." Sherlock grinned. "If you refused the idea of sleeping with me, you'd react completely different. Have seen that before. You haven't snapped with the usual 'I'm not gay' exclamation, which suggests that you're not quite against the idea." His hand started rubbing slow circles on the doctor's chest, and John had to bite his lip to stifle a slight moan.
“I might disappoint you.”
The bastard. That's why he hadn't wanted to talk about it.
“Romantic feelings might not be my area, and I may need time to learn what love is all about, but for you, for us, I want to give it a try.”
“Would I what?” Sherlock blinked, seemingly still clueless about what John was aiming at.
The more time had passed and adventures they had gone through, the more John had felt his affection and attraction deepening toward his friend. He had started longing for physical closeness—more than just fleeting touches or sitting close, but not close enough, to each other. Often when their hands accidentally brushed, John wished to pull Sherlock’s hand back and envelope it into his own, relishing the comforting warmth. Sitting at his laptop with Sherlock leaning over his shoulder to peer at the screen, his warm breath tickling John’s neck, John wanted to grab the long arms and wrap himself in them while Sherlock’s chin would have rested on the top of his head. Whenever they were lounging on the sofa, watching telly, John wanted to close the gap and snuggle against his friend, leaning his head back at Sherlock’s shoulder. Sometimes, after a successfully solved case, high on adrenaline, he felt inclined to press a celebratory kiss onto Sherlock’s pale cheek, showing his pride and admiration in a way that words could not express.
Also, this chapter was another fave to write, hope you'll like it too!
“Occasionally. But he always has to face that there's no point in that. Lady Isabelle is a strong woman.”
Suddenly, Sherlock felt something he had rarely experienced—his hard drive switched off, the constant need of his brain to be fed with information ceased. His entire mind instead focused on John and the activity they were engaged in. All reason and logic went out the window, and all that mattered was the way John felt under his touch, against his lips, how his presence engulfed him, made him feel appreciated, wanted, loved.
In case you might not get the reference for John saying "Just don't go singing", that was a nod to the song "If You Were Gay" from the Avenue Q musical. (It's a funny song, so if you don't know it, google it! It even has Sherlock fan version too!)
“Why?” Sherlock averted his penetrative gaze at John. “Even you should have noticed that—unlike you—I’m unequivocally, one hundred percent gay. And even if I wasn’t, she's not…”
John immediately deepened the kiss, exploring Sherlock's mouth languidly.
For a while, all that could be heard in the room was the loud gasps of the two men. When their breaths finally calmed a bit, John snuggled closer to his lover.
They were just friends, however, the doctor had found his feelings toward his flatmate involuntarily changing recently. Yet, he couldn't pinpoint what to do with the nagging, overwhelming, definitely romantically and sexually driven emotions. He had kept telling himself that it was due to the lack of dates and his hormones were playing with him, but deep in his guts a little voice said that Sherlock had grown upon him and, for some mysterious reason, he, John Watson, ex-army doctor was falling for the eccentric, emotionless young man. He couldn't control the newly awakening feelings. So when Sherlock came up with the question from out of blue, John was more than surprised and utterly embarrassed, yet secretly pleased and excited. He wasn't ready to talk about his feelings yet though, he had to come to terms with them in first place. Anyway, what he needed now was Sherlock to explain the origin of the sudden question.
"I don't need special gifts from you to show me that you care. You're my friend, I know you do. But this... What you offer is beyond friendship."
, the word still sounded so unreal. Sherlock had never thought that anyone could ever want to have such a commitment with him. But this extraordinary ordinary man in his arms did, and this wasn't just his imagination or a sweet dream, but reality.
The forest ahead got thinner, and John soon reached a clearing that was cut by a dirt road. He took another look at his phone. Still nothing. He grunted. Now there was one more reason to love central London.
“You're right, 'was' is the key-word,” John grinned. “What about your trousers?” He winked.
“Sher– Are you aware of what you're doing?” John gasped into the dark curls.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock purred quietly, seemingly loving the affectionate gesture.
"What does this feel like?" He murmured when pulling back.
“But why? You could have just asked me...”
Sherlock’s throat tightened at the pleading, warm expression on John’s face. “If I say it, I won’t be able to let you go,” he choked, the overwhelming emotions straining his chest.
Checking back on them, Angelo's mouth curled into a broad smile, spotting their joint hands on the table. “Can I bring you anything while your meals are being prepared?”
“Are you sure?”
Tentatively, he leaned in, his heart beating wildly in his throat, his breath lingering on John's face. Ever so cautiously, he closed the gap between them, his eager mouth brushing against John's dry lips. He was prepared for John's eyes to snap open and glare at him, but that didn't happen. Instead, after a moment, he kissed him back slowly. Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise, but he didn't pull back.
But what feelings were they? The satisfaction of their comfortable companionship having grown on him, magnified into something more, which could ebb once the magic of novelty was gone? Real love in its romantic meaning or just heightened admiration or deep infatuation with the only man who truly accepted him, who could see his true self and still want to be by his side, caring for him?
“It's an extremely deep meditation process, digging down to the vaults of the mind palace,” Sherlock explained. “Everything is stored there, even events that happened while you were unconscious or in a mentally limited state like drunkenness. Just pictures though, no feelings. There’s always the trouble with feelings,” he scoffed, “they require consciousness.”
Taking a closer look, he confirmed that the recording was real indeed, and, from the surroundings concluded, it must have been taken two days ago when he and Sherlock hadn't got to the detective's bedroom, and consumed each other on the floor of the living room. Knowing the particular fondness of spying on people, the only source of this home video must have been Mycroft Holmes.
Limping back to the room, he settled back into the bed beside his still peacefully sleeping bedmate. The moonlight, filtering through the large window, fell onto the doctor, bathing his face in its magical light. His grey-blond hair was shining like silver and gold, giving him the ethereal look of an angel. Sherlock had never seen him more beautiful. Drinking in the sight, he wondered what would happen if he kissed John now.
John's breath was caught in his throat for a moment. Sherlock practically admitted that he had some feelings for him, however he might not have been aware of it.
Second thank you goes to my betas, Donna and nutmeag83! You're the best!
Sherlock was trapped. “Isn't it obvious?” he uttered quietly, averting his look to the floor.
John smiled. “Yet, I'm sure not everyone shares your admiration toward her. There are always people disagreeing with some decisions. One cannot humour everyone.”
John Watson had never recorded his sexual adventures with anyone before. Not that he would have been bothered about seeing himself during the act. He was pretty sure about being a great lover; all the feedbacks and past experiences referred to that. He wasn't shy about his body either; due to the strict, though military training he was still muscular and fit, so there was nothing he should have been ashamed of. The only region of his otherwise perfectly body was his left shoulder where that bloody bullet had hit him, turning his world up-side-down. The wound healed, but the scar, both on his skin and heart, remained a memorial of a moment that John Watson would rather have liked to forget. The ugly, pink scar was an all time reminder of horror. It was his own, unique tattoo, memento of the darkest side of human nature, the cruelty that human race was capable of. The wound reminded him of what he despised and fought against. He remembered the death of innocents and his own survival. He was alive, which he interpreted as a message that he was to accomplish yet one more mission in this world. Now his uniform and battle-gear was replaced by the mind and leg-work and the single gun he owned, while the battlefield of Afghanistan transformed into the streets of London. On Sherlock's side he fought criminals, not less dangerous enemies than those human monsters in the desert of hell.
Gazing at their joint fingers, Sherlock uttered with a shy smile. "I like your touch. It's so comforting."
John stared with awe at the huge flakes painting the street white.
“How are you feeling?” John looked at Sherlock with a radiant smile.
“Oh, shit,” John wrinkled his nose, apparently sharing Sherlock's irritation about wasting time, and, swiftly grabbing the lapels of the purple shirt, yanked him into a demanding kiss. Before Sherlock could comprehend what happened, John’s hungry mouth sucked on his, hard and bruising, his teeth occasionally joining in, grazing the soft flesh. It sent Sherlock's senses on overdrive.
“No, it doesn't,” Sherlock countered. “We were under the influence of alcohol. The morning after, you called a halt, rejecting every form of physical intimacy. Thus, my inquiry is entirely justified.”
He chewed his lip nervously. “Look, I...don’t think that’s a good idea.” The smile faded off of Sherlock's face. “I'm not sure I could handle a ‘friends with benefits’ situation.”
“There's something you should know.”
Sherlock became his home, providing the familiar comfort, stability, safety and—despite his arrogant, many times arsehole-like behaviour—care.
John's mouth curled into an appreciative smile. “Thank you.”
“But this doesn't mean you can do anything you wish and I forgive you every time you act like a jerk,” the ex-soldier cast him a warning glance.
And presents on the tree
“You're fantastic,” he beamed at him.
John said with a look.
/I stopped using twitter more than a year ago though/
Thank you for the kudos and comments, or just reading without feedback - I appreciate all!
"What do you want me to say?"

Sherlock gave him a small smile.
Sherlock and John investigate in the club, and if John had any concern about the outcome of the evening, it's nothing
Thank you for the feedback as always, I love you all x
The ex-soldier's heart skipped a beat. This was the first time Sherlock said those three little words. With a happy smile on his face, he cupped the detective's cheek with both hands and pulled him into a passionate kiss. Their mouths melted into each other.
“Do you know why I was watching that clip?” Sherlock pulled back and looked at his flatmate.
John couldn't help but laughing. "You're so childishly naive at times."
John inhaled deeply, nervously licking his lips. His heart was beating wildly in his chest. “I think… I think I have feelings for you.”
Thank you for the feedback, I appreciate it!
“What do you mean?” Sherlock jerked his head.
John inhaled sharply. The urge to kiss Sherlock right there, right then was maddening, sod being in public. Tilting his head for the right angle, straining his neck, he inched forward until his mouth found Sherlock's lips in a soft kiss.
Sherlock ignored the comment and drank in the sound of John’s happiness. It was the most beautiful sound in the world.
. John pressed his lips tight, frown lines appearing on his forehead. He couldn’t deny that he found Sherlock attractive right from the start—because, seriously, was there any other person on Earth who had such mesmerising eyes in which one could see the whole universe with its every single galaxy and that pulled you in with such irresistible, magnetic force that made you reel even after only one glance; or such perfectly sculpted cheekbones under the smooth, alabaster skin that could have filled even Michelangelo with utmost envy?
John’s eyes widened. “You... you’ve been thinking about being with me...?” Not-interested-in-sex-Sherlock having been pining for him seemed so surreal.
With the frown lines smoothed out on his face, the pink lips parted a little, the dark eyelashes fluttering once in a while, Sherlock was beautiful, despite being sick. Ironically, the fever-induced rosy shade in the detective’s pale cheeks finally gave him a bit of healthier colour.
, John thought as he  held Sherlock’s feverish gaze for a long moment.
Sherlock had said so himself. Also, he had admitted having been engrossed in something less mundane than his hangover.
What was he feeling for Sherlock, after all?
The magic lasted only for a few moments, but for Sherlock—having yearned this contact for so long—it felt more like hours. But Sherlock knew it was a bit not good to kiss someone without their permission, so he ended the contact with a sigh. John's REM phase apparently ending, he entered another cycle of sleep, snoring quietly. Licking his lips to savour the memory, Sherlock stared at the sleeping form of his boyfriend, storing every little millisecond of the accidental kiss in his mind palace. Sickness and tiredness soon overwhelmed him, and his eyelids dropped happily as sleep took him over.
Once again, thanks a lot to everyone who left kudos, comments along the journey, or just read the story (even if only a  few chapters). You have no idea what your support and feedback means to me.
“I’ll be back in a minute.” He rose, letting go of the detective’s hand. “Fetching you some clothes.”
“I think that's what love is about,” the doctor smiled warmly.
“You are mistaken. It wasn't an experiment.” Sherlock gently laid the violin back in its case.
, his mantra started again.
This chapter was one of my favourites to write, hope you enjoyed it too!
Thank you for the kudos, comments and bookmarks for the first chapter, thank you for giving this story a chance in the myriad of the hundreds of new Johnlock fics, I truly appreciate it.
So, Sherlock was not just a simple friend, and not even the term best friend could cover the bond they had. Maybe that was the reason why people often assumed that they were a couple—they saw the signs of their unique connection and mistook them for something more.
vivid ones from this morning. He vaguely remembered dancing with Sherlock, giggling and unabashedly flirting all the way, then there was a large gap, and the next thing he could faintly recall was Sherlock's alcohol-bathed lips covering his, while long, wiry arms encircled him. The rest of the night was nothing but a cavalcade of faded images and hazy impressions.
John sighed loudly. “Right,” his gaze dropped onto the carpet. “This is not easy for me. I…” he took a deep breath, gathering courage. “I’m not gay—” Rolling his eyes, Sherlock opened his mouth to interject—probably that everyone heard that statement thousand times already—but John held up a hand with a stern look. “Please, let me finish.” Sherlock pouted, but pursed his lips obediently. “So, I’m not gay, that’s what I keep saying, but maybe things aren’t all black and white,” John said thoughtfully.
Sherlock's heart took a jump at the confession. Was this really happening to him?
, the voice huffed.
"So I messed it up," Sherlock sighed.
“It doesn't matter. I'm not a bloody porcelain doll that breaks easily,” Sherlock huffed. “You didn't hurt me, if that's what you're worried about,” he added.
John knitted his brows in horror. “Leaving you? Why?...Oh, my God, you think–” his face turned white, the answer seemingly dawning on him. “No! No way!”
was the reason for John's arousal. Sherlock Holmes, the freak, who was locked up in his mind palace and committed to loneliness in order to protect himself from the cruel world. He had always considered himself a broken, worthless man, whose only treasure was his mind, and whom everyone looked at with pity, contempt and many times fear.
“Would I what?” Sometimes having a conversation with the genius was both hilarious and frustrating. Following the speed of thoughts of that brilliant mind required extra patience and effort.
“We're going out tonight, you'd better know that.” The detective needed food, even if he didn't share the opinion. The only way of forcing the genius to consume anything edible was taking him to a restaurant.
“When two friends add sex to their relationship without romantic feelings, that's what people call 'friends with benefits',” John explained, watching the gears turning in Sherlock’s head, the long eyelashes fluttering in the process.
Finally getting rid of their clothing, John ran his fingers along Sherlock's collarbone, chest, hip and thigh, drinking in the beautiful sight in front of him. “God, Sherlock, I want you so much.”
John smiled reassuringly, caressing Sherlock's hair gently. “I'll guide you along. Just do what your instincts tell you.” Walking over to his armchair, he sat down and beckoned Sherlock over. “Come here.”
Any mistakes left, it's my bad, apologies.
“What's that?” John wondered, perceiving the man’s surprise.
“Are you okay?” John searched his look.
Thank you for the hits, kudos and comments, they brighten my day!
John snapped.
“You want me to say it out loud? Well, okay. You experimented on me last night! That’s all it was, right? Just one of your fucking games.”
“How many times should I state that I'm not gay?!” He burst out. “It's just you, you sodding daft!” He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. “What's the next step? Seeing ourselves in the morning paper?”
“He had it coming,” the weary baritone interrupted his musing.
Sherlock, as ever so often, only shrugged, his face perfectly blank.
Confusion appeared in the detective's eyes. "Not good?"
It was flattering and reassuring to know that John was so protective of him. No one had ever related to him with such vehemence and confidence. Not even his family. He squeezed the hand in his, the sensation of the soft, warm skin promising safety, stability and utmost trust. That sweet touch meant home. As long as John was by his side, Sherlock Holmes was no longer a stray, lost dog, looking for someone that would take him in and, instead of kicking him, give him a few kind words. He had found someone at whose side he could be a man, an appreciated human being. John had saved him and provided him a real purpose to live for.
“You are my partner, John. In every way.” He brushed his lips against the other man's, kissing him softly. “You are all I need. You complete me, without you I can't function. You tolerate my flaws, accept me as I am, and believe in me like no one else. As long as you're with me I manage everything. But without you I fall apart.”
Entering the flat, he found Sherlock sitting at the desk, engrossed in intently watching something on his laptop.
“Please, don't make this harder than it is,” John pleaded.
Hardly had they entered the flat, before their mouths crashed against each other in a desperate kiss.
The image of Sherlock watching him wake this morning popped into his mind, and John couldn't help cracking a tiny, affectionate smile.
The detective kept plucking at his violin, pouting and not intending to breaking his silence.
Thank you for all  form of feedback!
, the glassy, fever-heated eyes countered.
I don't know when will I have the chance to update next as I have an operation tomorrow and will have to stay in hospital for a few days. So apologies in advance if there's a longer gap between ch6 and ch7. Also, I have to postpone replying your comments till then, sorry.
John's fingers fumbling with the button of his trousers, Sherlock inhaled sharply and instinctively thrust his hips against the sturdy hand. John's palm enveloped his bulge and rubbed teasingly. Sherlock whimpered loudly. Grabbing the counter for support, he discarded his trousers and underwear impatiently, accidentally knocking off a large bowl. The glassware landed on the floor with a loud shatter.
John reeled, feeling suddenly lightheaded.
“Thank you for the important information,” Sherlock noted wryly, a half-amused smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
But Sherlock being Sherlock, oblivious to sentiments and the meaning of friendship, surely didn’t harbour similar longings about showing affection, John had reminded himself.
The subconscious memories of that drunken night lacked sensation, so Sherlock had no preconception of how being with someone in that intimate way felt. He was completely at the mercy of his transport's unknown responses. It was frustrating and terrifying.
Sherlock's heart fluttered at the confession, and he never felt more loved and at home like in that very moment. Deepening the kiss, he explored John's mouth passionately, his hand rubbing the nape of the doctor's neck.
As his eyes met John’s, the midnight blue eyes sparkled reassuringly, as if promising that John would catch him.
“Spare the obvious questions,” Sherlock replied without looking up, composed, as if he was just watching some documentary show.
His orgasm was nothing like those limited times he clumsily experimented on himself when he was young. The bliss he felt now was incomparable to the unsatisfying attempts in the past. Blood was singing in his veins, every fibre of his now boneless body tingled, and his constantly whirring mind finally stilled, clouded with the only thing he was aware of—

Sherlock and John start the investigation in Epping, but immediately face some complication that leads to the two spending the night in the forest nearby...
“I'm coming back soon,” John squeezed his boyfriend's arm reassuringly. “Hold on!” He shrugged off his jacket and draped it over the quivering man, hoping it would add a little bit of extra warmth. “I’ll be back as soon as possible,” he whispered. The miserable sight of the usually lively detective saddened John, and he couldn’t help but do what his mother always did when he was sick as a child—he tentatively placed a little, comforting kiss on Sherlock’s forehead. The feverish skin scorched his lips. Alarm filled John’s chest—both as a doctor and a friend. Sherlock needed help soon. His fever in the wake of that terrible downpour was worrisome, especially given that he was still wrapped in soaked clothes and lying on the wet ground in the chilly weather. Not to mention his ankle injury that should also have been treated. He would be lucky, if he hadn't caught pneumonia.
John's hand sneaked under Sherlock's pants and squeezed his bum eagerly. The intimate touch sent a pleasant shiver along Sherlock's spine. “John...”
The usual thank you to my betas and to you my dear readers for the amazing response. Love you!
“All the signs pointed to this plausible outcome,” Sherlock muttered, both disconcerted and relieved that his deductions having been wrong.
he sighed. She was the first to make him wonder about Sherlock and himself.
Did those other things include John?
The usual thank yous here :)
"Sherlock.." John took a deep breath and placed his hand on the top of his friend's. "I truly appreciate what you do, but... I don't want you as a substitute..."
The intense, encouraging, warm gaze reaching his core, Sherlock could only nod, though his heart was bleeding.
“Not more than I want you,” the detective drawled, leaning down, and brushed his thirsty lips against John's. “Let me take the lead this time,” he whispered into the soft kiss.
John shut his eyes so tight it hurt.
God, having such a conversation with Sherlock wasn’t easy. It felt like talking to an eight-year-old child. You could never know how to say things so that he’d understand.
“For you, it might be boring, but it's true. I'd appreciate if you and the world would finally stop trying to convince me otherwise.”
“I'm going with you.”
A strange favour stirs up things and leads to determining consequences.

No summary this time - read and find out what happens!
“Why did you seduce me last night?” John asked firmly, not beating around the bush. Though he was afraid of the answer, he couldn’t procrastinate asking the question.
“Fuck, Sherlock...”
“If you could…” John shifted in unease. “If you could delete them from your mind palace…”
Disclaimer: The show and characters belong to BBC, Moffat and Co., I just borrowed them for fun.
“I love you so much,” John stopped the bruising kiss long enough to murmur.
“As you want,” he agreed obediently.
Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat, and he blinked incredulously. It had to be a dream. “You do?”
“You can't even give me the satisfaction of punching your smug face, can you?” John hissed through his teeth.
Checking his phone, he frowned at the lack of signal still. He should have been close, though. Their suspect had fled in this direction, obviously being familiar with the area. That meant civilisation, which equalled mobile service.
“I can't do this,” he groaned eventually. “Text me when you're finished sulking and are willing to talk.” He grabbed his jacket and stomped out of the flat.
”I haven't.” John replied quickly, biting his bottom lip. “I just want to make sure that you're aware of the depth and meaning of taking that step. I don't want us to mess this thing between us. So if you decide that you’re not ready to–”
“I’d like to have that tea with you,” John agreed with a soft, sincere smile. He appreciated Sherlock’s thinking. He wanted to remember Sherlock’s skin against his, his touches and kisses. No way he’d risk it for either the best whisky in the UK, or all the tea in China.
“But...You’re not interested in this sort of thing and… you didn’t want to talk about it earlier…I thought...”
Sherlock's eyes opened slowly, and his dazed, glassy gaze met John's worry-filled eyes. Along with the consciousness, the pain in his ankle must have returned as well as he reluctantly pulled a bit away with gritted teeth.
Sherlock's eyes replied.
Sherlock's mouth quirk into a smirk of mischief, and, putting on the detective attitude, he smugly said.
So, who hates Jennie? :P I know, John is a gold medallist in stupidity right now.
“You're so beautiful,” John's warm breath tickled his abdomen, before the soft lips nuzzled the dark mess of Sherlock's pubic hair.
"Oh," he uttered, barely audible. "What happened to your marriage with your work?"
Sinking down on his knees, Sherlock wrapped his fingers around the engorged cock, his heart pounding wildly against his chest.
Irene had replied with a knowing smile.
“For that drink, you git!” John burst out in laughter again. This whole scene was getting utterly comical by now.
Thank you for the wonderful feedback about the latest chapter! x
John’s expression eased, relieved that his words were not heard outside his head.
Hardly had he pull the jumper over John's head before John was kissing him again, tugging at his black blazer until the clothing eventually landed on the floor. John's palms slid along the silky material of his purple shirt, exploring the muscles underneath the tight article.
“Oh yeah,” Sherlock licked the sensitive skin, while placing his hands on the doctor's chest and pushing him down onto the bed. “Reading your subconscious reactions is really enjoyable.” His mouth brushed along his lover's neck and collarbone, while his skilled fingers worked on the buttons of the striped shirt.
“We should get you into bed very soon,” John's doctor mode resumed.
Will John and Sherlock find their way back to each other, or is it over indeed?
“Uhm, Sherl-,” being about to bring the fact of watching sex videos in the living room during daytime was not good to Sherlock's attention, John's glance unintentionally flicked at the screen one more time. His eyes immediately grew wide and he almost choked. What he saw was something he hadn't expected the least. The two men in the video were him and Sherlock.
Sherlock held John’s gaze without a flinch, making sure to keep his expression impassive, but open and unchanging.
Sherlock cleaned the room of the unwanted spies in no time. When finished, he dropped down onto the sofa and kept replaying the earlier outburst of John in the private home cinema of his mind palace, analizing his blogger's behaviour. Some things he considered to be evident,  John approached differently. Being a genius and sociopath, Sherlock ignored the elusive web of emotions that instinctively and involuntarily clouded the thinking of normal people when it came to reactions to matters of life. He didn't understand why people had to complicate their issues to be solved by adding another problematic layer. Approaching things with emotions produced two problems the same time - the original issue itself plus the emotional side. If they helped to resolve the fundamental question, Sherlock could  understand the need of going that way, but emotions always seemed to lead to the contrary, making the solution of the initial issue much more difficult. Had it been anyone else applying this method though, Sherlock'd have mocked them all the time, pointing out their failure. Yet, it wasn't anyone else, but John Watson. He was an exception. Maybe the one and only. Not only due to the fact that they had passed the point of being friends, flatmates and colleagues only - which intrigued Sherlock like nothing else -, but also for John was smarter than the majority of ordinary people.
Enjoy this chapter :)
“I'm not having a row with you. I'm your doctor, so you do as I say, like it or not. If I have to, I'll tie you to the bed,” John affirmed strictly.
Sherlock nodded shyly.
Thank you everyone for any form of feedback, I'm grateful for them!
“Don't bloody start. You're sick, we wouldn't get far with you in this state. You're staying here. I'll be back as soon as possible.”
he thought, remembering the woman's remark the day they had arrived. ‘
“Uhm, Sherlock, I get it... No need to-”
John sighed loudly once again, his patience ebbing, and shook his head helplessly.
The moment of silence felt like forever, and Sherlock’s insides trembled at the prospect that he had messed up everything and that this was the end of the story of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
“Partners,” he smiled back.
“Those people around you must have been blind. You’re gorgeous—and this is a man saying so, who had considered himself straight all his life! Mind you, Sherlock, you make me question my sexual orientation!”
Sherlock groaned, but John conveyed a look that said it wasn't up for debate.
“Uhm, are you sure that…that we didn't have...” He stammered in embarrassment.
"You."
Sherlock was gaping at him, completely clueless.
Sherlock didn't want to break the unexpected, ever so comfortable situation—not when all he yearned for was to be physically intimate with John. Even the urge of nature couldn't compete with John Watson. It was just his transport after all, something to which he had never paid much attention, unless it was inevitable. It was all just a matter of mind over body.
“Oh, that so reminds me of someone,” John grinned teasingly.
John hadn't felt so alive and happy for a long time. Life seemed to have taken a good turn, things looked brighter and full of promise. His identity and sexual crisis resolved, a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders and he finally felt free of the demons that wedged themselves between him and Sherlock. After so long alone, he had someone in his heart again, someone filling his days with warmth and colour. Sherlock made him whole, gave his life a reason, and finally, John could embrace his love openly and wholeheartedly. This evening was just the icing on the cake.
“I'm fine,” Sherlock mumbled, shifting back into reality. “I was just thinking.”
"Oh," it was all John could say, being touched and disappointed at the same time. Sherlock's reasoning was heart-warming, but on the other hand, the fact that the offer was some kind of compensation and not the real thing was disheartening.
John's heart was beating faster with every word.
John wished he could have remembered exactly what had transpired between them. Sherlock-married-to-my-work-Holmes having initiated their tryst seemed so unreal and unexpected.
John stretched his numb limbs, a smile lingering in the corner of his mouth, seeing that Sherlock still managed to joke amidst the pain. “How are you feeling?”
But Sherlock didn’t seem to grant him even the chance of some peaceful reading, starting a new piece on the violin, full of high notes. John bit his lip with a frown, feeling like the father of a petulant child. Sherlock was apparently sulking again, and, surely, like always, he ensured that others couldn’t enjoy serenity either.
say these words again—I was wrong.”
He slid his fingers into short blond strands and pulled John up into a needy, sloppy kiss. Tasting himself on John's tongue was an unusual, yet powerful experience. In possession of data on both sides now, he could distinguish the differences in the taste of their semen, concluding that his own was a bit bitter and more salty than John's. Still, apparently, John didn't find the flavour overly revolting and swallowed the whole load.
Grimacing, Sherlock sat up and reached for the button in question. “You're dangerous,” he noted while unzipping the certain clothing.
Slowly, we're getting to the end of the story; honestly, I can't believe it!
John noted mockingly. How he hated it. Probably as much as Sherlock liked saying it. The git.
Craving his partner's closeness, John was holding onto Sherlock until the last tremble of his orgasm subsided.
“No,” Sherlock interjected before John could finish the sentence. “I didn’t sleep with her. She would have been amenable, but… no, I wasn’t interested.”
“I swear.” John reaffirmed his touch on Sherlock’s face, locking eyes with the detective.
Sherlock collapsed on him, his hot, irregular breath tickling the doctor's neck.
observe? Sentiment and sex are not my area, so talking about them—especially if the situation is unclear—is a bit difficult for me.” He bowed his head and added timidly, “You were so distant all morning that I thought you didn't approve of what happened; you keep saying you’re not gay, after all. I wasn't ready to face your pity and rejection.” Glancing at John again, Sherlock could see the flush of shame creeping into his cheeks.
he sneered.
“You mean having intercourse?” Sherlock wondered loudly.
“That was one of my favourite shirts.”
Whatever John intended to say was gone, his instincts and heart took the lead when he muttered eventually. "You're the detective, do your job. Tell me."
Apparently, whoever intended to get rid of her must have been an insider.
“I need you!” Sherlock whirled around, his eyes flashing wildly. How could John not see that? Why did it not matter to him?
“Of?” John turned his full attention back at his partner.
John gaped at him, swallowing hard. “I'm sorry, I–”
What are you waiting for?
is my first time.” Sherlock's eyes bore into John's. “The first that we'll both feel and remember. And that's what matters.”
Couldn't miss out on giving a nod to the show and fandom :)
As always, thank you goes to you, my readers-the hits, kudos and comments always brighten my day!
Sherlock swallowed hard, fighting the rising urge to cry. “Let you go...” His usually confident tone wavered, and fear lit up in his eyes. “What if you don't come back? What if you get hurt again and die... then I can never tell you–”
Hey, hey! I'm back! Sorry for the lack of updates in the past two weeks, but as I said I was on holiday. Missed me? :P
But instead of frowning, John only smiled—the softest, purest smile ever—locking his eyes with Sherlock’s. “That's exactly what I needed to hear to do whatever I can to stay safe and come back... to you,” he breathed, touching the detective’s face. “I love you too, Sherlock.”
“What are you saying?” John jerked his head and searched the quicksilver eyes intently.
“I don't want you to give me what they did. I want what YOU can give me.” He stared into the beautiful blue pools, letting their look communicate.
“You know, stealing stuff from the Inspector is a bit not good,” John laughed.  He remembered the time when he had realised that Sherlock had a thing for pickpocketing the DI.
Some time passed in silence, when John spoke.
Sherlock shifted, but didn't turn around.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered into his ear, and that was when John lost it. Shuddering under the young man, he came with a loud gasp. His whole body was shaking and the sensation was so intense that he could see stars in front of his eyes. For some minutes, he was heavily gasping for air, thinking he'd never be able to breath normally again.
Thank you for reading, commenting, leaving kudos, I truly appreciate it. Hope you'll like this chapter.
Sherlock was both relieved and disappointed. He was excited that John had agreed to give their relationship a try, but he wasn't enthusiastic about going slow. He wanted to feel John's warmth against his body in the morning, to feel safe and content. But it looked like he would still have to wait for that. Then again, a 'maybe' was better than a 'no,' and John was definitely worth it, so he had to accept the ultimatum.
“Penetrative sex?” Sherlock finished his question casually.
“Maybe you don't, but I definitely don't like the idea of my private life being exposed. These are “- he gestured toward the screen with his hand - “utterly intimate moments, which means they are private. Private, should I spell it for you? P-R-I-V-A-T-E! What is under the entry of 'private' in your mental thesaurus? In my interpretation it concerns things that I don't share with anyone, they are for my eyes only. And one's love life is definitely off-limit for public. Note that Sherlock, if you happen to have deleted this fact. “
“Obviously,” Sherlock stated seemingly nonchalantly.
“Sherlock…”
“Tell me what?” John narrowed his eyes.
“This shirt is pure sex,” John muttered huskily, taking in the sight, while undoing the buttons languidly.
Chapter title: Evanescence - Say You Will
While nibbling and sucking on John's lips and skin, Sherlock's hands were roaming all over the ex-soldier's body, rubbing and squeezing the exposed flesh. Some regions earned his multiplied attention, having noticed that those parts were particularly sensitive to his touch. John's breathing took a roller-coaster ride, rising and falling, depending on which area Sherlock's fingers, mouth and tongue were pleasing.
Thank you very much for the amazing feedback for the latest chapter! It made me really happy! *hugs all*
As I said last time, this chapter is a DARK one, read it at your own risk!
Knowing that nothing can hurt from now on
“I like you touching me,” Sherlock purred, melting into the tender touch. His eyelids fluttered shut, relishing the lovely warmth and softness of John's hand.
“They do little else.” John tightened his hold around the leather-gloved hand. “Besides, we’re officially a couple now, aren’t we?”
The early morning light licked the naked crowns of the trees, reflecting on the rain-soaked leaves and undergrowth. The autumn mist wrapped the forest into a big cocoon, spreading the chill on the ground. John stirred, shivering badly. His hair and clothes wet from the night's downpour, he felt like he had been sitting in a pool for hours. As if compensating for the cold, something heavy but warm leaned against his chest, alleviating the bite of chilly air and providing some comfort. Blinking his eyes open, he remembered all that had happened the evening before—the chase, Sherlock's injury, the necessary decision to spend the night in the woods, the mental quarrel with his father. He looked down at the sleeping detective snuggled against his chest, his breathing laboured and body trembling. Moving a hand to the pale face, John realised the reason why Sherlock was radiating that delicious warmth—he surely had fever. His cheeks were burning and teeth were chattering heavily. They needed a roof above their heads and dry clothes as soon as possible.
“I should be, you know.”
John's face softened and a warm light flickered in his eyes.
“Yes, that's fine too...” As if reading his mind, John approved the choice in a bare whisper, his eyes rolling back in pleasure.
“Sherlock,” John called softly, crouching beside the shaking man. Cupping the detective's death-pale cheeks in his hands, the heated skin proved John’s fears right; Sherlock had a high fever.
“Sh'lock...” his hoarse voice stumbled as he tried to speak.
“Ah, God...I'm not sure you are...” John moaned loudly, tilting his head to provide wider access to the exploring mouth.
Certainly, John was observant enough to notice that he had something on his mind.
John gently touched his friend's arm. “Yet, I want to hear you saying it,” he whispered.
Sherlock’s world crashed. This couldn’t be happening. Not when he finally found what he had always been looking for—his other half, the complementing piece of the puzzle, his reason to live. With the current situation in the world, the looming terror attacks everywhere, reports on kidnapped and executed soldiers and civilians, he couldn’t dismiss the fear that John was going to be in danger. He wouldn’t be able to handle it if anything happened to John.
Thank you as always to my betas and most importantly my readers! I know it's not an easy ride at the moment, but I can promise you that it'll get better!
“Hey, young man, are you lost?” A silver-white-bearded, elderly man looked out of the window, tipping his hat as a greeting.
“Okay. In this case, drink is a metaphor for something else...” John looked at Sherlock expectantly, waiting for the penny to drop. But, apparently, it didn't. “If two people had a great time, at the end of their date, they might want to... take things further... physically,” he wiggled an eyebrow suggestively.
Coping with the aftermath of the trauma is not easy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sleep, dear,” he whispered softly, tentatively caressing Sherlock's unruly curls. It was the first time he let himself indulge in such an intimate action with the detective. A little thing, almost nothing, but still John felt like he’d won the grand prize.
Shrugging barely noticeable, Sherlock casually replied. “He does, just interprets in his own way.”
“Are you okay?” John searched his date's eyes.
The lovely scent of pine and mouthwatering smell of scrumptious Italian food in the air, holly-decorated candles flickering on the tables, the restaurant was a perfect setting for a holiday dine-out. Sitting at their usual table, Sherlock gazed at John's firelight-caressed face with a languid, content smile as he listened to his companion's animated storytelling of a treasured Christmas childhood memory.
He needed distraction. He needed something to alleviate the noise and chaos in his mind. The sweet clarity and peace that his seven percent solution offered was ever so tempting. Sherlock could almost feel the blissful heat spreading through his veins and his mind calming, his focus becoming deliciously sharp, his thoughts crystal clear. Despite the strength of his craving for this honed serenity, Sherlock couldn't let himself fetch his secret stash and take that powerful relief. He hated that his promise to John and the thought of disappointing him was still binding him.
Sherlock's mind buzzed with the meaning of the words.
“Sherlock? Is everything okay?” John rolled onto his side after a long silence, facing him.
“Why wouldn't I be?” Sherlock raised a brow.
Sherlock grinned back. “Got it, Captain Watson.” His lips crashed against his lover's one more time, in a hot, sloppy, fierce kiss.
“Tea?”
“I see,” Barnaby nodded, pondering.
“No! I’m not going to leave.” John sat opposite him. “How could you even think…?” he wondered incredulously, rubbing his nape.
New year, new experiences, new discoveries - John has a hard time to wrap his head around a new side of Sherlock, something he hadn't expected.
John was staring at his friend, waiting for a reaction.
“I'm game,” Sherlock smiled, not minding that his face likely lit up with anticipation.
“For?”
Sherlock needed to get his mind off of the nagging thoughts of John's intentions and the tormenting doubts the night had evoked. He hated this feeling. He hated that he had become weak and let himself feel at all—look where it had led! The image of Mycroft's gloating grin haunted him.
Sherlock gave him an offended glance. This was really not what he wanted to hear when asking. John being a romantic, Sherlock expected some sentimental nonsense about what a milestone that evening had been for them.
The autumn breeze felt colder and Sherlock shivered slightly.
Sherlock’s focus snapped back to the room, and he sighed heavily. “John, I…” He tried to speak, but couldn’t get the words out.
“Mmm.” Sherlock's tongue kept caressing his skin.
“Would you mind going home now?” John asked in a hoarse, tentative voice, searching Sherlock's eyes intently.
Finally tearing his gaze away from the screen, Sherlock cast an innocent glance at his blogger as if saying 'Me? Why?'.
“I've never cared for human body beyond being the object of crime scenes; it's just transport of the mind,” Sherlock muttered against his blogger's chest. “I've considered all the extra attention as waste of time and energy. But since we're...,” he looked up at John, looking for the proper word, “involved with each other in this new way, I'm willing to approach the matter from another point of view. Because I want you to be happy. I want to give you everything you used to get from your girlfriends...”
“Watsonland is all mine,” he added in a predatory growl. “Mine.”
he groaned.
This chapter is dedicated to my faithful readers, chahnre and Equilibrium_29! You always make me feel that the efforts and time invested in writing this fic was not in vain. Thank you for your constant support! <3 <3
Sherlock nodded, his universe-coloured eyes bright in anticipation.
“You incredible, silly git,” John's mouth curled into a small, affectionate smile. He reached for the other man's hands and squeezed them tenderly.
John took another picture, beaming into the camera.
“You mean like...?”
“I have to. They need me.”
He was anxiously waiting for the ground to shake and crumble under his feet.
Chapter title: Shanks & Bigfoot - Sweet Like Chocolate
Well, this chapter is a bit longer than the previous ones, hope you don't mind it. :)
Ignoring the discomfort, he focused rather on the delicious feeling of being in the arms of John. The heat of John's body enveloping his already unhealthily warm transport—38.4 C, he reckoned —wasn't the most comfortable thing, but if that was the price of finally having him this close, he was more than willing to pay it. The weight of another body against his own was such an unknown sensation; Sherlock didn't remember when anyone ever—including his own mother—had held him like this. The intimacy this action provided was ever so appealing and comforting. John giving him this little moment of happiness made Sherlock fall a little more.
Panting hard, John looked down at Sherlock in pure awe and gratitude. “You're....amazing... Christ, You. Are. Bloody. Fantastic,” John claimed Sherlock's mouth in a passionate kiss. “I want you so fucking much.” He grabbed the lapels of the purple shirt. “Bedroom!”
“I'm sure, he did,” John noted sarcastically. He wasn’t keen on continuing this exchange. “Now, sleep a bit.” He patted the Sherlock's duvet-covered leg lightly. “You need rest. I’ll check on you in an hour.” He was already about to leave, when he heard the detective murmuring something under his breath. “Hmm?” John turned his head and looked back at Sherlock over his shoulder.
John sighed. “Argh, I don't know which freaks me out more - the mere thought of the possible scenario, or knowing the fact that you mean what you're saying.” He narrowed his eyes. “Does the thought of anyone walking in on us while doing it not alarm you the slightest?”
"God, yes.” John kissed him back, his eyes shining in the dim light. “You're the best and most beautiful gift I have ever received for Christmas." He ran his hand along the curve of Sherlock's body until it rested on the man's buttock. “And this gift is even more precious because this time we're both going to remember every moment.”
“John...” Worry etched Sherlock's face. “I'm sorry,” he muttered and unwrapped his arms of John in an instant. “I...” He bowed his head in remorse. “I shouldn't have done that. You made clear that you aren't comfortable with your scar, yet I ignored it... I didn't want to cause you any pain. You have every right to be mad at me. I'm sorry.” The last words were a bare whisper.
John frowned, not liking that Sherlock’s fever hadn’t diminished. Despite that, he was hesitant to wake the man, who was running on far too little sleep as it was.
“Don't tell me what I have to do!” John snapped, his gaze sharp on Sherlock.
Sherlock sadly gazed at the yellow and red leaves floating on the dark water of the lake, oblivious to the slightly chilly autumn wind tousling his curls and brushing his cheek. Then there was someone beside him—heavy boots crushing the dry leaves on the ground. John.
The apprehension was visible in the detective's ice-blue eyes.
he admonished himself. But what really bothered him was the fact that he couldn't be angry with himself for the way the evening had turned out after all.
“Hmm, not the answer one normally gets after great sex, but from you, 'satisfactory' should do it,” John grinned happily, his eyes drooping shut.
Thank you for the lovely feedback! Love you all!
Sherlock felt something settle in him. Data he understood. He took John in his hand cautiously. God, the sensation was incredible. The heavy weight was hot in his palm, the veins throbbed and muscles twitched under his touch.
So if any of these triggers you, skip this chapter! As some part of the next chapter deals with the aftermath, if you want to be safe, come back for the last chapter.
Again, the memory recollection technique that Sherlock mentions is not real, it's a fiction of my mind.
he grimaced.
“Start with light strokes,” John muttered. Sherlock squeezed him tenderly, recording his partner's tiniest reaction in his mind palace. “That's it… Ah– A bit more pressure...Like that... yeah...” John's head fell back. “A bit faster...God, yes... you're good...”
“You might eventually ask if I intend to delete the memories of last night. I don't.”
They shed their coats and shoes in a frantic rush, not caring where the clothing landed. Sherlock peeled the oatmeal jumper—the one he loved the most from John's knitwear—off John in a frenzy, desperate to get his boyfriend naked as soon as possible.
“We're having a white Christmas!” John blurted out in bewilderment, glancing at Sherlock.
"Not good, alright, got it,"' he sighed resignedly. "However I thought I found the perfect gift for you, now I have to find something else.."
Cautiously scooting closer to his boyfriend, he sneaked his arm around the sturdy, pyjama-clad torso, watching John's features for any sign of stirring. John didn't notice anything; his chest rose and fell peacefully in his sleep. A bit bolder, Sherlock snuggled closer, shortening the distance between their bodies. He could smell John's scent and feel the warmth of the compact body—it was heaven. He couldn't help but stare at John, intently studying the handsome face. He loved watching John, he couldn't get enough of the lovely sight. His gaze fell onto the delicate eyelids with the sandy sweep of eyelashes hiding the beautiful, warm navy blue eyes underneath, the very eyes that could worship or kill him with one look. Watching the rapid movements underneath the eyelids and sensing the change in the man's breathing, Sherlock concluded that John was right in the REM sleep phase, the period of dreams.
Rating goes up in this chapter due to some sexy time, see tags.  Also, there's homophobic language and homophobia caused anxiety / distress in this chapter, so be warned!
John sighed at the sterile tone, “Yes. We both were very drunk, I can't even remember everything. Are you one hundred percent sure?”
“Of you,” Sherlock stared into indigo eyes. “How lucky I am to have you.”
He had never exposed himself to anyone like this. John was the only one Sherlock had ever trusted so deeply to open up and let himself taken by the torrents of emotions. If there was anyone Sherlock was willingly expose himself to danger, pain, even death, it was John Watson. Sherlock felt he owed him since the first day, when—only after barely a day of knowing each other—John shot that cabbie to save him. John could have left him dealing with the situation on his own, but he didn’t. He had probably realised already that Sherlock needed someone to save him from himself.
’re bloody fantastic.”
“Thank you.” These were the first words that had left Sherlock's lips since the forest. His tired, washed-out blue eyes glanced at John, his lips curving into a tiny, barely noticeable smile.
John’s heart skipped a beat at the solemn tone. It felt like a proposal.
Sherlock's body quivered slightly, his heart pounding in his chest at the sweet sensation of John marking him with saliva and the light pressure of lips and sealing his promise with a kiss.
Once Barnaby stopped the car, John jumped out and immediately rushed to his boyfriend's side. He found Sherlock curled up into a ball, leaning halfway against the tree--trying to save as much heat as possible, shivering heavily. John’s heart sank at the sight.
The boys prepare for their first Christmas as a couple.
Thank you again!
What now? When visiting Ella, he hadn’t known that the intensity of remorse and the panic attacks would get worse. The more intimate thoughts he had about Sherlock, the more tortured he felt. How long could it go on?
Sherlock shrugged, casting his eyes down. “Since Irene Adler…”
“How could I have forgotten that?” John laughed. The fairy lights sparkling in the window behind him painted his silver-blond strands in a golden glow. “The most awkward time I have spent in a restaurant.”
Sherlock's gaze fell on him.
John's eyes searched his. Sherlock having uttered those three little words not so long ago, the doctor  expected himself to be the giving end tonight and please the detective as some kind of reward. Now Sherlock suggesting the other way around, his plans went into thin air.
John's cheeks flushed deep red.
John groaned at the sudden stop, not liking the cool room-temperature replacing the hot, wet mouth of his lover.
“Don’t,” he begged, unable to hold back his tears. “Please.”
“I never told Angelo that you were my date,” Sherlock protested.
Sherlock hobbled into the bathroom, wincing every now and then, his injured foot hurting with every step. After finally getting rid of the discomfort caused by his full bladder, he took a glance in the mirror. He looked terrible—unkempt, messy, sweat-stricken hair, dark circles around his weary, faded eyes—so very unlike the image of the great detective.
Labels or no labels, John was sure that he was in love with Sherlock. The last—and actually, the first—time he was in the same bed with the man, John had had no idea how he felt about the detective. Now, things were different, and John was certain of his feelings. How things could change in a few weeks!
From now on updates are due once a week, sorry.
His look fell on the artistically sculptured, pink cupid bow that he couldn’t get enough of.
“I have never said you were gay John. Nevertheless, if you were, I'd be okay with it. ”
Warning: this chapter might trigger emotions by the harsh language and violent undertone.
’ echoed in Sherlock's mind. He recalled the doctor's detached, unusually quiet attitude earlier that morning, which—added to his frustrated, on-edge manner just minutes ago—was enough evidence for him to see that what he was dreading was true. John didn't feel the same about the previous night and had no intention of revisiting the experience. And on the top of that, he was certainly going to leave him after everything that had happened. Was it worth it?
“Should I be interested? Right now?“ he asked unenthusiastically, furrowing a brow. Yet, knowing Sherlock wasn't going to drop the issue until he got an answer, he decided it was better to play along. “I guess you were curious,” he gave in with a sigh.
John Watson took the stairs with a smile in the corner of his mouth. Getting home to Sherlock felt slightly different – and different meant good this time - since they had finally taken the first, tentative steps to change the nature of their relationship a couple of days ago. Friendship turned into dating with occasional sexual encounters. From that day on, every hour had passed with learning something new of how Sherlock&John functioned, what benefit Sherlock&John had that Sherlock and John separately didn't. A new chapter of their story had started, full of novelty, anticipation and passion.
“Why?” Finding how to breath again, John uttered quietly after a moment of silence.
Possible triggers: homophobic language, verbal parental abuse
The first date is on. :)
Spoilers:  1x01 Study in Pink, otherwise you're safe.
John shook his head. Whenever Sherlock intentionally got involved in something out of his area, there always was some hidden motive behind it. Deception, manipulation, experiment.
Once the photo was done, Sherlock tilted his head, so that his cold nose nuzzled John’s cheek. It was so innocently intimate. John felt like travelling back in time to his youth, when the dates were just good fun and fooling around, ignoring conventions and rules. That was the last time he felt such carefree happiness like he did now. Reliving that feeling, John could cry out in joy.
John saw the disappointment and sadness in his friend's eyes, the feeling of uselessness was mirrored in the blue pools. Of course, Sherlock couldn't see that why his offer earned indignation, his brilliant mind wasn't working like any other people's.
“I always knew that I would be lost without my blogger,” he returned the smile and pulled John into a loving kiss.
Once back in the Beresford residence, Lady Isabelle—now acting both as an angel and mother in one—insisted on the two having a bit of rest after the chilly episode, providing them everything they needed. Hot tea and their rooms’ heating turned up were beneficial to them in their exhausted state.
Sherlock's 'your feet not reaching the pedal' comment is a nod to my old fave show "The X-Files"  where Mulder said it to Scully in one episode. Another OTP of mine. Oh, those old times. :)
“God, what the hell is this..?” he stammered, startled.
The only possible explanation seemed to be the excessive amount of alcohol.
2. homophobia, domestic verbal abuse, anxiety issues, mental issues in adults, fear for sanity
The detective's hot breath was caressing John's skin, and the doctor felt like his whole body was on fire. Blood was burning the wall of his veins, every little breath was scorching his nose and lungs, and his mouth felt drier than it had ever done in the desert. And when Sherlock's hot mouth suddenly was on his aching, arching member, the sensation was too much to bear.
Some quiet, blissful time follows, but will it last?
“I have never thought that there could be anything or anyone else beside the Work that would take control over me and be that important,” Sherlock spoke fiercely with bright eyes. “But—and listen carefully, because I
“I can't,” John whispered sadly.
Adjusting the duvet, John got out of the bed as quietly as possible and walked into the bathroom.
“Could say so. My friend had a little accident in the forest—nothing serious, just a sprain, but he can't walk. We had to spend the night there in the storm, and now he has fever... I need help bringing him back to the mansion we're staying at...”
Hearing John's reassuring voice, Sherlock endeavoured to crack his eyes open, but it seemed that even that little motion felt like too much effort. His trembling hand moved and covered John's, seeking comfort in his presence.
“If that's what you still want?”
“You can't what?” John raised a brow, looking intently at him.
For a long while, John had thought that his growing affection toward Sherlock stemmed from this sincere gratitude and admiration, and it was nothing more than deep friendship forged between two men who had gone through both hardship and excitement. Yet, he had slowly begun to realise that there were more to it.
A quiet moan escaped Sherlock's lips when John's hands suddenly slid under his silk shirt. He instinctively arched into the warm touch. John's chest pressing against his, he felt the doctor's heart beating fast. If that hadn't been a telltale sign of John's desire, the prominent bulge poking against Sherlock's thigh gave everything away. Sherlock smirked and ground a leg against John's erection. John gasped loudly and, whimpering in need, moved his trembling fingers to his groin, fumbling with the button and zip impatiently. Noticing the clumsy moves, Sherlock covered John's hand with his, helping him with the stubborn zip, then hooking his fingers into the waistband of the trousers and pants, rolled them down in a swift move. John groaned in relief, his chest heaving in anticipation. Sherlock's fierce look fell on John's now free erection. Sherlock himself couldn't complain about his own measurements, but apparently, John was even more endowed by nature. Beautiful.
"When I said I didn't want you to do that I meant I didn't want you as an object, as some service. I don't want you to be a one-night stand." His eyes locking Sherlock's, John took a deep breath. "What you deduced is true, I'm not against the idea of being with you. Not the slightest," he whispered. "Because I have feelings for you."
“Correct observation, John.” He noted, tilting his head to have a better viewing angle.
“Do you mean that–?” Sherlock searched his companion's eyes intently.
The effect of the fast-acting painkillers had already started to kick in, but the pain behind his eyelids was still too much present to dwell further on the night before.
John groaned and massaged his temple, trying to alleviate the terrible headache. He had been drunk many times in his life, but last night took the cake. He had never been so wasted to have no recollection of what happened during his pissed state. Well, there’s always a first. Honestly, he was rather glad he didn’t remember much; it was less embarrassing this way.
“How does it work?”
“As I said, I understand if you don't want me anymore.”
Pulling back after the heavenly moment, Sherlock rested his forehead against John's. “You gave Christmas a new meaning. Thank you.”
“You always said that emotions are not your area; you’re oblivious to feelings. But even if you might develop any, I’m dubious that I could ever fit into your life like that. The Work is your life, you're married to it, remember? Your words precisely. No one could ever be that important to you. Not even me. So, if I agree to…”
“I’ve always found you attractive, right from the first moment, but…” John rubbed his nape in unease, before letting out a perplexed laugh. “I feel so ridiculous telling my flatmate that he’s sodding gorgeous and I’ve kinda had a crush on him for some time…”
The young man's face became grim, his eyes mirrored utter confusion.
“You'd better get used to it. I need photographic memories of our happy times,” John reasoned and snapped a picture. Checking the image, he snorted. “Come on, you can do better than that!” Sherlock sighed, and, surrendering, pulled a lovely smile. “That's it!” John admired the photo. “Aren't you beautiful?”
“Where's the problem?? Where's the fucking problem? I'm telling you where it is: this was recorded without our consent by your dear brother, who handed it to you as it was yesterday's paper, and now you're watching it as if it was anything but an afternoon soap on the telly. Sherlock, it's our fuckin' fucking, for heaven's sake, not fuckin' Coronation Street!”
There, he thought. It was the time to confide the detective into the secret of his heart.
“Let's drink to that,” John beamed. “To us—the official boyfriends.”
“I'm sorry that you have to deal with an inexperienced partner,” Sherlock turned his head away in shame. “You're not used to that. I understand if you don't want me anymore.”
Who said that coming to terms with your feelings for your friend was easy? After some soul-searching, Sherlock and John finally have a heart-to-heart talk that changes everything...
Sherlock pouted. “No, not exactly,” he replied nonchalantly. “They all know what an intercourse is, don't they? All have done it; some of them,” a tiny, knowing smirk appeared in the corner of his mouth, “still do it regularly, even if having a helping hand. Actually, some have more than one volunteer, occasionally the very same time.”
The last syllable was a mere whisper, turning Sherlock’s breathing noticeably faster.
"Now you ask me if I have feelings for you, and I can't find the right answer, because there are so many ways you affect my life." Taking a deep breath, he continued. "I enjoy your company, I need you being around me to function properly. You complete me and make me feel alive. You're my guiding light, my compass, my home. I don't think I could live without you anymore."
“Yeah,” Sherlock gave him a small smile, pleading guilty. “I asked Mycroft for help.”
Obliging, Sherlock flicked on the lamp on the bedside table.
“That's definitely an option to pursue later,” Sherlock smirked weakly, his voice hoarse. “Lestrade's handcuffs could finally come handy.”
I know, the ending... don't hate me too much :P
Yes, Jennie is finally out of the picture. Are you happy? :)
Sherlock let out a low groan as the warmth enveloped his cold-conquered, still hot body, closing his eyes and letting his head lean back against the enamel surface. The chattering of his teeth subsided slowly, and his cheeks acquired a healthier colour. With his swollen, discoloured foot resting on the edge of the tub, Sherlock gritted his teeth in obvious pain.
“Promise?” he croaked, searching John’s face (God, how beautiful he was in the light of the setting sun), desperately needing a tiny sign of reassurance.
Taken aback by his lover's vehement action, Sherlock pulled back with wide eyes, gasping.
Chapter title: Foreigner - I Want To Know What Love Is
“Sher-lock...” John stammered.
Again, thank you for the hits, kudos and comments! I truly appreciate them.
“No one has called me beautiful before. I was always just the freak.”
“And you didn’t take the chance. Why? She was beautiful, even intriguing for you.”
“I always cared for you, you were always important to me. But now... it's different. I have never felt like this. I didn't know what being in love was like. Until now...”
“Yes, you idiot,” John laughed, cupping Sherlock’s face in both of his hands. “I always have.”
Sherlock must have sensed his inner battle and need of encouragement, because he noted desperately, his pleading gaze burning John’s skin. “I need
The two men stared at each other for a moment in uncomfortable silence, before John let out a relieved sigh. “I'm sorry...” He ran his fingers through his blond hair nervously. “I was confused, and when I suggested we talk about what happened, you refused to do it, so knowing you, the most convenient answer seemed to be the experiment. I shouldn't have said all those horrible things, I'm sorry.”
Some minutes later they both were panting, getting closer to the edge. Their sweat-covered bodies joining, all they could focus on was pleasing each other as never before.
, he sighed exasperatedly.
Normally, John didn't bother who saw him nude, but the current situation was different. He wasn't familiar with the sight of himself during sex, he couldn't particularly imagine what it would look like with someone having the very same anatomy. Not that it would have repelled him, it was just strange.
Sherlock's face didn't even flinch in recognition.
"Not enough data," Sherlock muttered, and leaned in for a longer and deeper kiss. Sneaking his arms around the doctor, he pressed their bodies together, feeling the comforting warmth against his chest. He could feel John's heart beating fast, every thud like a note of a melody.
AN: Unbetaed, so be warned. Also, this is my very first Johnlock (and slash) fic, so be gentle with me. :) Anything else? Enjoy. :)
Before settling down to sleep, he touched Sherlock’s forehead lightly, cautiously checking the man’s temperature.
” It was rather a statement than a question.
“I'm going to kill Mycroft,” he hissed, his eyes searching the room for the possible hiding place of the spying cam. “He doesn't know the word privacy, huh?”
The thin blanket of snow crunched quietly underneath their feet as they were strolling along the Southbank of the Thames, inhaling the crisp, fresh December air. The alcohol they’d consumed lifting their spirits, they were chatting animatedly, laughing and joking.
They gazed at each other, communicating silently for a long moment, before John spoke again. “Just for the record, I'm still most likely not gay.”
“Not until I know why you want to break my nose.”
“Fine, my arse,” John snorted. “You have a fever, in case you hadn't noticed! Not to mention that nasty sprain.”
“You didn't do anything wrong.” John squeezed the hand in his. “You caught me off guard for a moment, but then all I felt was shame and gratitude, because you did something that no one else has ever even thought of doing. My wound always disgusted my partners; they preferred to not even look at it, let alone touch it. And then you, a supposed sociopath, come and do something I've never expected!”
“You're suggesting that we...?” he tried to breath.
John speaks his mind during the Holmes dinner, Sherlock provides proof to the Yarders...
Sherlock’s eyelashes fluttered at the kiss, but he seemed to be too weak to open his eyes properly.
“Come on, it's only me - one of the willing participants - watching it. So where's the problem?”
“Is it?”
He sighed silently. Certainly, John knew where to find him; Sherlock couldn’t hide from him. Though, after John having announced his decision that morning, all Sherlock wanted was being alone, thinking.
“Sherlock! “ John cried out in horror. Lestrade's sex life was the last he was interested in. Well, after Anderson.
“Doesn't matter. I don't want to burden your mind with theatre stuff,” John giggled.
“More than twenty years. I'm kind of an accessory to the estate,” Barnaby laughed. “Know every corner in the house and around. Lady Isabelle appreciated my work enough to keep me even when I couldn't do everything I used to. She’s a good person.”
A visitor from the past causes some serious trouble in paradise...
“I bloody don't care,” the doctor huffed and climbed the stairs to his room. “And just so you know: no more sex until the flat is bug and cam-free.”
Sherlock huffed sulkily, but still didn’t turn around.
John growled, his eyes filling with disdain. His fist was just an inch away from the pale face, when Sherlock's arm blocked the blow. Sometimes martial arts skills proved to be useful.
“Shh, John, I've told you, I'm in control tonight.” His fingers dived into the ex-soldier's body, rubbing the hot walls, occasionally hitting his prostrate.
“Shit, Sherlock, shut up!” John burst out and sat up on the bed. Sherlock could see him desperately trying to put the pieces together and interpret the situation. “But we... oh,  Jesus,” John bit his lip as reality dawned on him. “You were...”
“You don't want to,” John concluded. “Fine. But I do.” He took a breath. “Last night...” Sherlock tensed at the words. “I don't know what to make of it.”
“That's the goal, my dear Watson,” Sherlock smirked, and gave another long squeeze to the throbbing cock of his flatmate. ”Come for me,” he whispered, before capturing John's mouth passionately, sucking the remaining air out of his lungs.
John's eyes widened, his breath caught in his throat. “Jesus...”
, another voice called, but unlike the hateful, terrifying tone of his father, this was soft, caring and encouraging. John’s eyes widened in surprise.
John's body tensed, and Sherlock thought that this was it, he had gone too far.
Sherlock looked at him remorsefully.
“Sherlock...” John reached for Sherlock’s hand, his voice gentle and reassuring. “Look at me.” Sherlock obeyed reluctantly. “You keep saying that you're a sociopath, but believe me, you aren’t.” The tears were shining in John's eyes, an affectionate smile lighting his face.
John cleared his throat and licked his lip uncomfortably. “Have you—?”
John took a loving look at his peacefully sleeping boyfriend, drinking in the sight. He wished to run his fingertip along the masterfully sculpted face, the sharp cheekbones and elegant jaw, tracing the line of the soft, dark eyebrows, delicate nose and that perfect Cupid’s bow. John licked his lips and swallowed hard, fighting the urge to capture those lips in a kiss.
