“Phil hasn’t set up your bank account yet. You must have a chunk of change saved up by now. Next time you’ll be treating me,” said Clint.
He needed to wash the dried seed and slick from him. Tony smiled when he entered the bedroom. Steve had burrowed under the blankets. From the closet, he took a fresh set of bedding, placing it on the bedside table. If Steve wanted to rebuild their nest, he wanted the materials to be available to him. He couldn’t resist pulling back the blankets slightly to place another kiss on Steve’s forehead. He went to the bathroom, needing a showering.  Steam clouded the glass walls of the shower. He tossed off his pants and got in.
“Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places,” said Banner.
Piper flinched at the word ‘sir.' It was something they could address later. For the moment, Steve had his pup back; he had to focus on that. As they walked home, the sky started to clear; Rune must have calmed down. When they got to the front door, Steve put Piper down.
He wasn’t going to push his presence on Steve. Tony kissed Steve before letting him get back to work. When he got into bed he knocked Steve’s box from the bed.
Steve nodded. Peggy always knew of the mutual pinning between Steve and Howard. She had Steve’s heart, but not his lust. She thought of asking Howard once the war was over if he’d be a donor for Steve once they settled down and married. That was a dream from long ago.
"You care about me?" It didn't make sense to him. The reason she cared was that he could offer her something no else could, even though it wasn't much. It was a relationship he'd become used to. And he hadn't at all minded having that with the pup. She was someone truly in need of it.
They'd gathered all the information they could on the Winter Soldier, but the man was a ghost. He'd been popping up S.H.I.E.L.D's radar, off and on, for decades. The one time he left something behind, it was a blood sample too degraded to be tested. The man had no fingerprints. He left no trace.
Tony sat in bed with the Piper cradled in one arm. With the other, he worked. He'd managed to keep her mind off Steve's absence for most of the day. He gazed down at her, her blue eyes verging on closing. She yawned, falling asleep. He doubted tomorrow would be easier than today.
Tony looked up from his work in the living room. Jarvis pulled up the footage from Piper's nursery. She was waking up. He went to her, putting her on the changing table. After the hundredth diaper change, he'd grown immune.
"She may only be three, but she has a right to privacy. Unless there's a danger. And I'm sure Jarvis will alert us if that happens," Steve said finally.
The playboy fact wasn’t surprising. Many would find such a man attractive. Money didn’t attract Steve. It was the person. But he couldn't deny that Tony was very physically appealing.
“Always a way out. You know you may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero,” said Steve.
“He was sent to get dissolve a weapons store and retrieve an agent. An explosive device was triggered. He saved Natasha and the agent before himself,” said Fury.
Piper hopped on the fender. He had a friendly enough relationship with the girl, but he still was stunned by her lack of skittishness. Or she was good at hiding her trauma, something she likely subconsciously picked up from her parents.
“That’s nice.” His alpha was cutely protective over him and jealous of another alpha. Steve turned around bringing Tony into a kiss. It was a brief almost meaningless moment of happiness that was already gone.
"People were suspicious before. And they'll definitely start asking questions now. Everyone can smell him on you," said Rhodes.
Tony was struck by a wave of stale distress. Steve stood in the door of the lab. The man looked exhausted.
Tony nodded. He could easily use an alpha command to get an answer, but Steve was entitled to his privacy. Steve had something he wanted to keep secret, so did he. Everyone was entitled to their secrets. By the time the movie was over, Steve was asleep, using his lap as a pillow.
He used the scentless soap provided. Winter would normally spend as long as possible under the heated spray, but he didn’t want to leave the pup with Lena longer than he had to.
Rumlow ran to the enclosure, picking up the pace when he caught the smell of blood in the air. The glass was heavily cracked and smudged with blood. His eyes widened as Winter ran headfirst into the glass wall. Only to get back up on wobbly feet to try and do it again.
She only cried. He picked her up taking her into the kitchen, taking a bottle from the fridge. While waiting for it to warm he hummed to her. He gave her the bottle as she reached for it
Tony guides himself into the omega. Both gasping when he was fully seated. Steve’s arms wrapped around him hugging him close. Tony dug his fingers into the mattress collecting his control. Steve was frozen underneath him, trying to readjust, moving their hips together when he was ready.
“For the average person of his height and weight at this stage would be experiencing a sense of confusion, dysphoria, with nausea and vomiting, with possible blackouts. But with his tolerance these percentages aren’t always accurate,” said Jarvis.
Tony huffed and put the shorts on. Steve smiled it was amazing how well that worked. He yawned. Tony nudged him toward the bedroom. Steve fell back into the bed. Sleep came quickly. Steve whined when he was woken up. He glared at the alpha.
Steve’d heard weirder stories. “Last time I met you, you were a legal intern. How does that work out with this?”
"I think you know the answer," said Steve. Shame washed over him. He should have been able to stop it, but he was too damn weak at the time. If only he was stronger, it wouldn’t have happened.
The three men fell into comfortable conversation. Steve enjoyed watching the two alphas teased each other. It was clear the two were close. Watching them reminded Steve of him and Bucky. He shook away the thought before it could show in his expression.
Tony groaned Natasha’s call always seemed to ruin the moment. He let the omega go. It noticing the absence of his warmth.
Tony growled. It wasn't over. There was a present threat to his omega. Steve grabbed his hand tightly, whining.
The day wore on. None of their meals were right and it irritated her. Whatever sense of time she had was lost. Piper paced the cell, growing increasingly more stressed.
"Nothing could keep me away." Tony leaned forward kissing Steve on the temple. “Do you need anything?”
Steve pushed Piper into his arms. This wasn't like Steve. Steve darted from the penthouse in his gym clothes. Piper cried looking uncomfortable. Tony put her over his shoulder, burping her, groaning when spit-up soaked his shoulder. She relaxed against him. The pup was clearly upset. He purred, calming her.
He nodded. The pup needed a reminder of them. Maybe it would help with the defeat in her gaze. There was such a swift turn of emotion brought on by something as simple as an airplane.
“We sometimes fight every couple does, but you have to remember that Steve and Tony only fight like that because they love each other so much,” said Pepper.
The pup burst out with laughter. What had he said? He'd only mentioned a skill. She seemed to think his confusion was even funnier. And laughed even harder.
"You don't believe that. A monster like you isn't worthy of being the child of Captain America and Ironman. They want the innocent little girl that was stolen from them not you." She strode out from behind her desk, stopping to kneel in front of the little girl.
Tony would have enjoyed hearing that more if it didn't involve something as important as his family.
Walter Cronkite – was actually a radio reporter in WWII that focused on battles in Europe and North Africa. This served as the foundation of a long career as a reporter.
Natasha went to find Clint. He was watching the fight, cheering with the males, blending in, but as soon as Natasha reappeared he discretely pulled away from the crowd. Together they went to the entrance. Clint helped her into a white fur coat. A gift from one of her many suitors. She kept them for occasions like this. A valet pulled up in a flashy red car, handing her the keys.
Steve watched as Tony did their daughter's hair. Piper sat in front of Tony completely relaxed as he combed her hair. He couldn't believe it the first time he watched them. Tony had a remarkable talent for braiding and styling the little girl's hair. The most Steve could manage was pigtails.
“I see what's behind all that bluster and confidence. The fear, guilt, sadness, and regret. And you’re one of the few has seen it in me,” said Steve. her played nervously with his hands. As soon as he’d returned his decision was made. “And you were right about Bucky. It was my fault."
He held her tightly as panels in the walls opened. A chemically sweet smell flooded the room. Winter’s vision blurred and the room spun. Winter gritted his teeth, fighting the gas effects, but his legs gave out and the pup fell from his arms. He struggled to all fours, snarling when footsteps came near. A club stuck the back of his neck, bringing him down. He lacked the strength to rise again.
He knew how much her parents wanted her. They were desperate to find her. He couldn't tell her. The words were there, but he lacked the capacity to voice them. He doubted her actions would diminish their feelings for the pup. If, by some miracle, her parents discovered her, it was unlikely they'd even come upon the footage of the attack.
“I don’t know how to flip the screen! Don’t talk to me like anymore. You’re not my boss. I don’t trust this guy. He has another guy with him, he’s shifty.”
He relaxed. It must be terrifying to lose something so essential to their person. His wasn't anything special. It was a coiled rat nest of violence, nothingness, and near nothingness. Being erased again would be painful now that emptiness was filled with memories he cherished. He patted her head.
"I have no standing with them. All of you have a reason for her to trust you. I am a stranger. The only way for me to gain ground is to play her game. So far, it seems like she's willing to play by her own rules.” George held up the contract. “Is this something you could set up?"
"Steve." His eyes were red. Steve rested his head against his chest. Tony rubbed the omega’s back. He purred, hoping it would help Steve get through the moment.
“This is different, Tony. You aren’t doing this because you’re obligated. You’re doing this because you want to. You like this, person,” he said.
"She probably didn't have a chance to find out. Someone likely took her without permission. That's why it's important to be careful around strangers. Most people are good, Carl but there are some people who will hurt kids. So, that's why it's important to be mindful of strangers and always tell me or Mommy where you are going,” said Helmut.
Her blazing blue eyes focused on them. Slowly she recognized those staring as Papa and Daddy. She didn’t want them to see her like this. The beta in her grasp wasn’t the root of this turmoil. She moved her foot from Bloom’s throat.
The admission caught him off guard. He wasn’t expecting Tony to admit wrongdoing. Steve didn't blame the alpha for reacting the way he did. It was reasonable. He didn’t know what say, so he nuzzled against Tony neck seeking comfort in his embrace. Tony’s arm wrapped around his shoulders drawing him closer.
“You funded the work the least I could do was send my first pieces. What do you think? Be honest,” said Steve.
“I’m looping the footage from the playground. So, he still thinks we’re there. He doesn’t even know we’re here,” said Piper.
Tony woke late the next morning. In the hazy moments between sleep and awake, his arm stretched, searching for that sweet-smelling being that graced his bed more than a week ago. He groaned. This had become an unwanted habit. His subconscious alpha state refused to let him drop the habit. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Last night was an all-nighter, working out the kinks on his latest iron man suit. Tony yawned, he grabbed his robe and slid it over his tired shoulders. He wasn’t surprised to see Rhodes sitting in his kitchen.
Steve went to the lab. Natasha was sitting on the couch, flipping through a magazine. He peered into the playpen. Piper was peacefully asleep. If he'd ever hurt, he would never forgive himself. He didn't touch, not wanting to risk waking her. Seeing her like was enough.
Papa was already there, making a small blanket nest on the floor. Whenever they had movie nights, he'd make one for her. Still, she always ended up sitting between her parents halfway through whatever they were watching.
“Violence isn’t the answer to that situation. Alphas like her thrive on the reaction. I shouldn’t have given it to her,” said Steve.
“I can see elements of Van Gogh, but more aggressive. You turned the fear and pain of your past into something beautiful,” said Tony. Steve’s arms wrapped around him. His back was pressed against Steve’s firm chest.
She was right, but Steve never wanted a big wedding. Unlike most omegas, he hadn't put much time into dreaming of his wedding day. It was always made him feel bitter. But now he could.
“Aunt Nat!” Piper squealed when the red-haired spy arrived and handed Piper a small package. “Thank you!” Nat picked her up and Piper purred, nosing against her neck.
Piper groaned when a high-pitched buzz forced her to wake. Her eyes snapped open after trying to ignore it. The sound was only growing more intense. It hurt! She screamed, clapping her hands over her ears, desperate to block it out.
"Do you want daddy or I to ride in the back with you and Rune?" asked Steve. He caught the conflict in her eyes. Her expressions were very much like her father's when she was trying to bottle something up.
Piper woke. She rubbed her eyes. Winter was pacing the room. Every now and then, his gaze would dart to the door. The motion had her on edge. Winter didn’t pace. His default setting was still. What was agitating him?
Steve allowed Tony to lead him away from the bedroom. Tony opened the door of the guest bedroom. It had been converted into a studio. It was perfect. His old paintings were neatly shelved and everything was where it should be.
He changed into the heavy winter clothes. They landed on small icy clearance. Steve dug his spiked boots into the icy ground. A French agent was already there waiting. The agent spoke with Natasha.
By the end of the story, she was asleep. There was no moving without waking her. He ran his fingers through her hair, causing her purr. He smiled.
Tony led her back down the stairs. As they worked, Piper's posture relaxed. It would be best to bring up the therapist now.
Lena took Winter’s bag. She felt something plush against her fingertips. It was a stuffed, white unicorn with a crown around its head.
Seconds later, the beast went limp. Steve gently lowered it to the ground by its mother and sibling. Why was this getting to him? Maybe it was his omega nature urging him to nurture.
A cool touch brought Steve crashing back to earth. Tony’s helmet retracted, eyes watering, and Steve’s defenses fell as he collapsed into his mate.
"We've done all we can for it," said Tony. It must be such a shock to Steve. He only knew the young Peggy, while Tony was there to watch the steady decline. Tony gave into his alpha instinct to comfort, hugging Steve. The omega was quick to react, accepting the comfort. They stayed like that for a while. “So what did Aunt Peg tell you?”
Sparks of electricity were shooting off him. Her words weren’t getting through. He was covered in deep-colored bruises. One of his eyes was swollen shut. Dried blood marked his clothing and skin. It was anger fueled purely by fear.
His mate joined him. He nuzzled against the omega’s neck, picking up the scent of another alpha. Tony growled, Steve hardly interacted with anyone outside of their inner circle.
The alpha returned to his seat on the counter. He tried to ignore the intense gaze of the alpha. Steve focused his attention on cooking. He sipped as wine. Steve wished he could get drunk just to calm his nerves. He set dinner on the counter. The lights dimmed.
Steve’s eyes were so intensely focused on it. He didn’t seem disturbed, more curious. Tony jolted when callused hands gently touch the sensitive skin around the reactor. Steve shot to the other end of the couch.
He brought her back into a hug. She cuddled close to him. Listening to his heart, beating. It was so safe within his embrace. How could she have ever doubted its safety?
"Where?" whimpered Piper. Who was out there that would want her now? She’d killed ten people. They weren't good people, but they were still people. Someone might be waiting for them. A family, a pup. She threw up still smelling their blood underneath her fingernails.
Piper wasn't sure how long she stayed there, but, after a while, she heard someone crawling toward her from the left. She was relieved when she caught Rune’s scent.
Maybe in a few heats then their bond will be secure enough. He smiled. After a claim, marriage followed shortly after. Steve’s heart raced at the idea. Would Tony be willing to take that step? He didn’t want to push the subject and scare him off. If their relationship continued there would be bumps, but they’d get there eventually there.
Steve dropped off the bridge they were on, landing on the bus below, tumbling to avoiding enemy attack. He swerved through road at top speed. Making his way to blockade of police cars. He landed on the roof of a car. One the cop aimed his gun at him.
Steve chuckled softly. Piper had a crush on Thor. She failed hopelessly at trying to hide it. What was funnier, however, was how awkwardly Tony reacted to it.
. It took seconds for him put it together. Fuck, Fury wants him to be Captain America’s alpha for a season. Saying no to the request would be impossible.
A rusted part came undone, and she handed it to him. Piper happily screamed when Steve took her off Tony’s shoulders and tossing her into the air.
“That’s a nice thought, but I doubt it will ever come to be. If by some miracle they existed I'd say yes,” she said.
Her stance remained aggressive. The danger of the situation didn’t escape him. She could overpower him without exerting any real effort. But he didn’t back down and slowly approached her, keeping his posture open and unthreatening.
His eyes widened at the little girl sleeping peacefully on his chest. He shot away from her. The pup whined at being jolted awake. She stood up rubbing the sleep from her eyes. A ragged stuffed rabbit was in her hand.
He unbuttoned the cuffs of his shirt, rolling his sleeves up to show circular burn along his forearms and horizontal scars across his wrists. Both the pups leaned closer to get a better look.
“Only in shape. She’s not the same naïve girl we lost." However, accurate the statement was, it did little to calm his mate. Steve wasn't going to let go of what happened. “She’s a lot tougher than she looks,” Tony continued.
“So why didn’t S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him on the Tesseract project? What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?” asked Bruce.
Steve laughed when he caught Tony ogling him.  Even when he carried his baby weight, Tony looked at him lustfully. Intimacy proved difficult when they shared a bed with an infant. Piper had a habit of interrupting them whenever they had gotten close.
A young alpha pup huddled in the corner of his cell, awaiting the appearance of his handler. His brilliant blue eyes kept flicking toward the door.
Winter’s eyes locked on the small being shivering by the door. What was it? His jumbled mind fumbled to put together that she was a pup. The muzzle he wore didn't filter the powerful stench of the pup's distress. Its intensity made him gag. There was no escaping the fumes coming off the pup.
He returned to his room packing the few things he had. Steve hid Howard’s letter. It would be wrong to take it. He locked the door of his apartment.
“Didn’t take you as a gearhead,” said Tony. He was happy to discover this new piece of information. It was a similarity he could build on.
"Fine." He carefully disentangled from Steve, pulling the blankets over him. His omega whined, noticing the separation, even in sleep.
Steve lowered himself to the floor. He turned the plastic block over in his hand. Tony took a seat next to him, putting an arm around his shoulder.
“The stress is exhausting, but I still can’t sleep. Give me a few days, and I'll be good," Steve said.
The alpha’s mind was a haze. A powerful instinct to place his claim mark on the omega was overwhelming, but something stopped him from following through. He deeply inhaled the omega’s intoxicating scent.
Steve enjoyed it for a minute longer, before pulling away. He'd indulged enough. Steve got to his feet, only to stumble forward from dizziness. Tony caught him.
He paused when he saw the massive nest Steve built in the master bedroom. He went to the guest bedroom. The nest there was simple only made a few thin cotton sheets. The omega was spread out, taking up the entire bed.  Even in sleep, he looked uncomfortable. Tony sat on the floor next to the bed.
He followed Tony, keeping at a safe distance. Something was eating away at the alpha. He needed to find out what. They found themselves at the scene of Phil’s death.
“Are they linked to Ten Rings?” asked Steve. It was the same group that had taken his alpha. They would suffer for that. He took a breath, remembering his alpha was safely tuck away in Tokyo.
They were discreetly escorted to the medical wing. In his feral state, Steve refused to even let beta nurses near him.
“And I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I’d like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction,” said Bruce.
Tony took his phone from his pocket. Twenty missed calls from Pepper. Best to avoid calling her back for as long as possible. She was going to kill him when the press got hold of this. He pulled away from his phone. Taking a good few seconds to look over Steve.
“I don’t know,” said Steve. He hadn't paid attention. His sole focus had been making his nest. Instinct had him focusing on the sole task of building the best nest possible for after the birth.
“How did you escape the memories? You need an outlet you can refocus that energy both mentally and physically. You’re busying your mind, but you're failing to consider your body. You’re using all that extra energy to mental, trying a physical activity. It will help you sleep a bit better.”
“PIPER!” Even in this state, there was no forgetting that pain. His chest was heaving. The aggression and distress leaking off Steve was choking Tony.
He glared at the image, wanting it gone. With his metal arm, he scraped the image from the floor before returning to his corner. But the symbol was still trapped in his mind despite its destruction.
Steve finally calmed down enough to come out of the shower. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Steve toweled dried his hair. He smiled when saw his toothbrush next to Tony’s. Why did the simple sight cause him such joy? He went to the closet to look over the clothes Tony got him. There was enough clothing for him to stay for another week if he wanted. He ran his fingers over the fabric. It was softer than anything in his wardrobe. All the underwear was colorful, including one with an American flag print.
“Well, I promise a stress-free environment good pension no surprises,” he said before zapping Bruce.
Tony got what he needed from the kiss. Love was there. It hadn’t given him any answers to why Steve was like this.
Turner picked up on the slight on hesitation, but today wasn't the time to push on the issue. Today was meant for him to get a general feel of where Steve was.
He got in the elevator with Natasha. Steve didn’t want to leave the alpha over the holiday during this time. Tony would be fine.
At one in the morning, Steve came out the haze. His head rested on Tony’s lap. The alpha’s powerful scent surrounded him.
Natasha entered the jet. The boy tensed in Maria's arms. His eyes glowed, and bluish-white sparks of electricity shot around them, wrapping protectively around Maria.
Steve vaguely remembered the alpha leaving at the time he thought it was a dream. "What time is it?" he grumbled.
They fell into easy conversation. It allowed him to relax. He couldn’t believe some of the stories Rhodes told him. Steve started making breakfast.
Winter tensed but didn't push her away. Never had a person without ulterior motives willingly come this close to him. And there was that gentle fluttering sound again. Her little hand reached for his metal hand. He moved it away. It could hurt her. He'd already put her through enough. She whined and tried reaching for it again.
Piper fell flat on her face as an electric current suddenly coursed through her. She screamed weakly into the mattress.
Tony walked into the entrance of the training base. There was little information he could gather from this facility.
“You are perfectly healthy, omega. I don’t see why not. It’s only a matter of time. Steve, this won’t be a normal heat it will be extremely intense. I suggest you find someone to help you through it,” said Edith.
“Furry,” she said innocently, tilting her head to the side like she didn't know what she was doing. She closed the door behind him.
A knock on the door disturbed him from his reading. There was a knock on his door. He opened it. Edith stood outside his doorway with a box filled with popcorn and candy.
“You better leave Stark before he comes to his senses,” said Fury. He smirked when the billionaire rushed out of the room.
“Which one of you smells like honey,” he spat. Steve rocked uncomfortably on his feet.  “Fuck, big guy you’re in heat."
Steve went to the door, checking to see if it was still locked. Surprised to see tiny blue fingerprints on the door's surface. Steve laughed, not caring she’d picked the lock. He decided to leave them there. The mansion needed some positive wear. Steve went to his painting, not surprised to have seen it changed.
Bloom was surprised when Piper’s breathing became short. The panic came through clearly. “Open your eyes,” said Bloom, halting the exercise since it seemed to be uncomfortable for the girl.
Piper bit her lip. Interesting wasn’t good for Winter. Being interesting was what got them here in the first place.
Tony removed the scent soiled bedding from their den area. He checked the perimeter, scanning for any potential threat. Tony searched his home for anything, soft for their nest. He went back and forth between their den and searched until Steve was satisfied. On one journey, an image of his previous omega caught his gaze. He tossed it into the trash. No, need for his omega to feel threatened by her image. He'd made his choice.
Piper glared at the woman. She implied her friend was an idiot. He was much smarter than the few normal children she'd spent time with.
Steve stilled despite the intensifying pain. He whimpered, begging to be released of the command. Steve snarled when Edith neared. Alpha distrusted the woman. If alpha didn't trust her why should he? He was unable to move. Why wouldn't alpha release him? He whined.
He nuzzled closely to his alpha. Steve didn't want to be alone. Jarvis was great company, but he wasn't real.
“But that strength of his is wrapped up in a handsome package. You’re only a pup. What appeal do you hold?”
Tony felt like banging his head against the table. He didn’t want to talk about this. Feelings like these were meant to be kept to himself. Talking about them was too exposing.
“Someone needs to train the pup.” Rumlow sauntered over, taking up more space than it seemed he should, looming unnecessarily.
"So did we. Dr. Banner's theory was correct. Hydra somehow knew that detail of your pregnancy," said Edith.
Pierce went to the computer, pulling up footage from the flight deck. It was easy enough to track the location of the crafts. His eyes widened when he saw the direction of their flight path. They were less than two hours away from Antarctica! The assets had to be moved and quickly.
“Sleep,” he ordered. His command fell instantly on the omega. His hold on Tony’s waist went slack. Tony pulled the blankets over his omega, hiding his beauty from view. He left the guest’s bedroom. Fury followed behind him.
“And I’ll read all about it,” said Bruce. This had been a unique experience but he was more than ready for it to be over. And he'd rather leave before it turned for the worse. Either at his hands or Loki's. The sooner Loki was dealt with the better.
He went to the lab, grabbing an IV bag. Steve placed them in the master bathroom. He went back to Tony. The alpha was barely conscious.
She locked onto Winter’s scent. Something stopped her in her tracks. Another scent. Honey and vanilla.
Where was his alpha?! He wanted his alpha! Steve fought the urge to give in to the alpha’s physical command. He shook off Rumlow’s hold. The alpha pulled a gun. Before he could disarm the alpha a shot went off, hitting him in the leg. It wasn’t the searing pain he expected, but dull grogginess.
Killian laughed. He pulled a muzzle from his jacket pocket. Steve had seen one like it before. His fight doubled. It locked around his face. A vapor filled his sense. His vision grew dark.
Tony put much that together already. Piper started whining, calling both their attentions. Steve soothed her. He kissed Steve on the cheek.
Steve only scowled at her. Best to go with the truth no matter how little he'd want to hear it. Or how bad he'd take it.
Tony caressed his cheek. He leaned into the gentle callus touch of the inventor’s hand. Steve yawned. He leaned forward, placing a soft kiss on the alpha’s forehead. Steve moved from Tony's lap, settling by the alpha's side, using his chest as a pillow. Tony's touch cooled the simmering heat under his skin. Purring as those fingers went through his hair.
The AI unit hadn’t stopped pestering him on this. Every day Jarvis asked him the same question, multiple times.
Rune deeply breathed in the delicious smell filling the room. He licked his lips. "What's smells so good?"
“Still working as a literature Professor at Colombia. She visits me almost every weekend,” said Peggy.
Tony brought him close. His deep rumbling purrs relaxing Steve further. Tony wasn’t doing it for that purpose. The alpha was simply purring because he was happy. Steve began purring. The sounds of their purrs lulled him to sleep.
Tony let the tech take him to the OR. Steve stood there. He couldn’t go any further than this. There was nothing he could do but wait.
The vulnerability in Steve’s voice called upon Tony’s alpha to protect, nurture, and comfort. Something rare for him. The urge was unnatural for him, but it felt right. He rose from his seat, wrapping his arms around Steve.
All six of them were in the park. For some reason only known to Piper, Thor was riding a large dog. Clint was having an archery contest with Legolas. Hulk seemed to be eating a hot dog cart. Natasha was sitting on a bench. He and Steve were simply sitting on the grass together. Piper never used a figure for herself, claiming she was already there why would she need someone to fill in for her. The simple thought inflicted such a harsh sting.
Tony nearly choked on his cookie. He pounded on his chest, managed to get control of his breathing. Not commenting on the idea of a pup with Steve would be the quickest way for her to drop the subject. It proved far too appealing to his inner alpha.
He was purring. When did he last purr like? Only when he was a pup and with his mother. Never while he’s in heat. An unwanted memory came to the forefront of his mind.
“Clear everything. The assets are to be moved to the nearest secured base,” Pierce said. “The Avengers will be there in an hour. Likely less. Any trace of her has to be erased.”
Steve bared his neck. He sighed as Tony’s tongue lapped slowly against his skin. Steve found himself dozing off to the deep purr of the alpha. His eyes closed. Tony’s fingers ran through his hair.
Tony hung up. He groaned, hating how cornily happy he sounded. It wasn’t normal feeling this way. It wouldn’t last. The great fall from this feeling was what he feared. His coping mechanism wouldn’t handle it well. It was only a matter of time before Steve came to the realization he was no good for him.
Maya followed Steve into a living room. He turned on the news. Every news channel was reporting on it. She wanted to talk about Killian, but now clearly wasn't the time. Everyone here was exhausted and stressed. At the moment, she did not want to risk getting on Captain America's bad side. He may be pregnant, but he was a force to reckon with.
Tony held Piper in one arm as tucked Steve into the nest. He was exhausted and his shoulder twinged painfully. Sleep could wait until he was sure Steve was safe. He joined his mate in bed. Piper lay on his chest asleep. He rested his hand on her back. Her eyes opened.
“You are to eliminate all of them. Be quick and efficient. And try not to cause a panic. When you're done, meet me at the flight deck,” he said. His men nodded.
“He’s fainted. This a lot to take in,” she said. They helped the unconscious omega into the backseat of the car. Then returned to the base. Nurses swarmed around them, taking the captain to the medical wing. The two agents took a seat in the waiting room.
He took the bowl away. She huffed at him but settled her back in her chair. He offered her a spoonful of the greenish mush. She opened her mouth to eat, and eventually finished off the entire bowl. He wiped off her face. How she managed to get it all over her face was beyond him. On the second attempt, she accepted the bottle. He hummed to her as she ate. Those innocent blues eyes looked up at him.
Steve relaxed now that he knew is pup was safe. He was pleasantly shocked when Piper hugged him back.
“You should be able to. If you want to have a fertility test performed, I can order it,” said Edith.
“Sweetheart, I can’t reach any further. And you can’t stay there all right you got to let go. You got to let go I’ll catch you I promise!”
She slammed glowing badge into his face, cutting him off. It seared into his face. Her heated hand stabbed into his chest before she tossed him back. A deputy ran to intervene but stopped when she drew her gun. She fired.
“If you aren’t going to talk to me at least to talk to someone else. I’m calling Dr. Turner tomorrow."
His inner made sure to voice his appreciation. He whined, hiding his face in his arms. Tony nuzzled and purred. Steve bit his lip as Tony continued to thrust into, his knot working him perfectly. He forced back a moan when release found him again.
Tony moaned at shear tightness surrounding him. The omega's sweet whines echoed in his ears begging him to move. He moved the omega’s leg to his shoulders. Tony thrust full force into the omega, making sure Steve felt him. His rhythm was brutal; each motion was rewarded by a pleasured moan. Tony’s knot was catching on the omega’s rim.
“We can watch Gone With the Wind if you want tonight. We can watch it in color,” said Tony. Steve threw another bagel at him. “What did I do that time?”
Steve backed up and sat down on the weight bench. He grabbed one of the weighted plates piled near it, turning it in his hands. He tensed when Tony sat next to him.
“And this is for the pup,” he said. Thor took out a small box from his bag. Inside was a silver sphere. He pressed the button at the top ornate sphere. It separated the pieces taking the on the form of a tree with small birds flying slowly around it. As the parts moved a lullaby played.
Steve yawned, stretching out a kink in his neck. He looked back at his painting. The rough image was of Piper sitting on Tony’s shoulders working on the car. A freeze-frame moment of perfection that only lasted a few seconds. He needed to paint more moments like this.
Steve sat next to the toilet. After two days of no morning sickness, his baby was getting revenge. His stomach was empty, but he kept dry heaving.
Killian sprinted toward dodging his every blast. They locked in combat each searching for an edge to put it to an end.
Piper stared up at the florescent lights, but Lena didn’t come back. She closed her eyes and tried to sleep, shifting slightly. Her eyes snapped open when she realized she was in pull-ups. She'd been potty trained since was two. It made her feel ashamed. They were taking away even the smallest things she had under her control. Piper let out a frustrated scream, thrashing her limbs. Her restraints held strong.
“Maybe something with Tony,” said Steve. He didn’t really think on the sentence. It felt natural spending the holiday with him. Tony would probably have some kind of important event to go to. He didn’t want to get in the way of the alpha’s business.
They made to a S.H.I.E.L.D airstrip. A jet was parked. Clint came out. “Cap, you okay with coming along?”
“It’s an electromagnet. You should know you got a box of them right here,” said Tony, rattling the box.
“I’d like to welcome our guests Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. First, I would like to thank you for all that you’ve done to protect us,” said Oprah.
The unessential staff put up more of a fight than he’d expected, wasting precious time. Joseph armed a tranquilizer gun. This had to be handled quickly. He glanced at his watch. Twenty minutes until they arrived. He touched his earpiece.
Uncle Bruce was next to arrive. He wished her a happy birthday and handed her two newspaper wrapped gifts.
"And you made it in an hour?" It was a comfort wearing it. His heats may be unpredictable at points. This would prevent him from being bonded from some random alpha.
“Please, leave me alone until then,” he begged. Steve burrowed into the nest, not wishing to be seen. His shame deepening. From his blanketed shelter, he heard Tony purring. He sunk into the mattress, soothed by the deep rumbling sound. His eyes closed. What an alpha he had found.
“Oh, this is only the stealth mode,” said Steve. He turned the knob on his watch and coloration went to its original pattern.
Tony smirked, seeing a way to hit two birds with one stone. "What if Papa meets with Dr. Barny today?”
“All we did was search for you. That’s all we could do.” She didn't seem to believe him. "Honey, we love you. If Papa could fit in this tube, I am sure he'd say the same thing."
“I’ve got you,” he said, hugging the alpha close. He wasn’t letting go. His eyes watered. "I love you, Tony. I didn't have to chance to say that before you went in."
Lena woke up her with her face plastered to her desk. She groggily raised her head, wiping the drool from her chin. It was six in the morning. Lena smiled she was leaving to see her family today. She turned on the coffee pot, then walked to the one-way window. Her jaw dropped.
He stopped in front of a shop. Its shelves were packed with plushy stuffed unicorns. He touched the fluffy sparkling fabric. Pipes would like something like this. An omega should have soft things. They should be comfortable. All she had was a scratchy wool blanket.
“I’ve known Tony since we were pups. Today, I’m honored to be your best man today on this special day. And I honestly never thought I live to see this day. I could tell you all the stories, but I am not. Congratulations Tony, you couldn’t have married a nicer guy,” he said.
Steve woke up feeling more exhausted than he’d felt before going sleep. If he were lucky, he’d get one or two hours of sleep a day. His nightmares had returned full force. On good nights, if they could even be called that, he woke up screaming in a cold sweat. At his worst, he went into flight or fight mode and it took hours for Tony to calm him down.
“Press down gently on the edge. The reactor will emerge then turn it and it will come out,” said Tony.
“Stark smiles a lot, but it’s rarely genuine. His genius is both a heavy burden and a gift. He's open with you,” she said.
Steve blushed. He liked it a little too much because he was currently fighting the urge to eat it directly from the jar. They finished their early breakfast. Steve packed a bag full of snacks. He had to increase his calorie intake by how much he didn't know exactly, but he was constantly hungry.
He didn't know his name. How was that possible? How could anyone not their own name? What had they done to them?
As their dance was ended Steve was quickly asked by another for the next dance. Everyone wanted to dance with him. He danced with several previous presidents. President Obama wasn’t able to attend, but his wife and daughters were.
“You’re perfect,” said Tony. He was about to reach and touch Steve’s cheek but he resisted the urge.
Rune was leaning against the beta’s side. Piper was tucked in the big omega’s arm with an alpha looking her over. The way they looked at her was unlike anything he'd ever witnessed; like she was the most valuable thing in the world.
Steve tensed. Tony tried to soothe the distress leaking off him. He nosed against Tony’s neck, taking comfort in his scent.
Winter listen to sniffling sounds of the pup crying. He gritted his teeth doing his best to block it out. Eventually, it stopped. He sat up, checking – okay, she’d only fallen asleep. Her cheeks were still wet with tears. She was shivering. Winter dragged the mattress toward her, pausing - not sure how to pick her up. He nudged her onto the mattress, pulling the blanket over her.
“Hey, Phil I was wondering if you could find me a motorcycle for personal use. I wasn’t sure who else to call about this,” he said.
The pup whimpered, shrinking in on herself. He backed off from its source. He’d have to wait it out; eventually, someone would take it away. He was meant to be alone, preferred it. She plastered herself against the wall. Fear was the appropriate reaction. The pup covered her face with her arms, trembling. He glared at the door. Winter wanted her gone, but the thought of killing her caused his instincts to fire against him. He hoped it had all been wiped from him, but those instincts would reappear whenever he least expected. An itch, but it hadn’t proved a big inconvenience … until now.
“I believe it was. His grades were outstanding, but he was constantly getting into trouble. The only thing that kept him from getting expelled was Howard’s donations to the school. But I got to see him during the summer. Jarvis always brought him. Every day with Anthony was an adventure,” said Peggy.
“This isn’t home,” said Piper. But it had two of the people she wanted to make a new one with. She didn’t know how yet but she would somehow.
“Thank you," said Steve. He wanted to ask Tony for his number but wasn’t sure if the alpha wished to keep in touch. Part of the reason he chose Tony was the alpha wouldn’t cling to him. He should have known better than to get attached.
He was supposed to have four days until it hit fully. It should have slowed with the separation. Had talking with Tony been enough to cause him to hit it early? They couldn’t get back to New York soon enough.
Rabid behavior was a frequently occurring trait in alpha super soldiers, not seen their beta counterparts. In the nineties, one of them was put down for that very reason. Despite the issue, the higher up wanted alphas.
Bruce sat in the kitchen with Edith. He’d expected more raised voice from Steve and Tony, but they seemed to have figured it out in a peaceful manner.
“There’s more than enough room for you, the kids, and Pepper when she get there at Howard’s,” said Tony.
Tony looked over the paper. There was no mention of his mate. His mate and unborn pup were safe. He could have gotten them killed.
Steve grabbed the alpha’s hand and led him off the plane. They got into the car. Being in cramped into space with his alpha did nothing to help his self control. He was grateful for Tony’s driving. Steve shot out of the car as soon as they pulled into the garage. Cramping almost brought him to the ground. A steadying hand wrap around his waist. He leaned into the sturdy alpha behind him.
“Howard had a thing for hidden entrances,” explained Tony. “Jarvis, pull up the footage from Antarctica.”
Edith took a step back. She should have known better than to question his virility. It was one of the fastest ways to piss off almost any alpha.
A lavender honey scent touched his senses. It was heavily tainted with distress, but she was there. Her heartbeat was strong.
“And there’s another person you pissed off his name was Phil,” said Tony before sending Loki back with repulsors.
It was the sixteenth of December that gave him a bit more than a month. He makes it through Steve’s heat without incident the omega’s hormones would further bond Steve to him.
Winter sat with his back against the wall, his feet firmly planted against the floor. Usually, he found comfort in small areas. They gave him a full view of his surroundings. But, for the first time, he’d been threatened with something he actually feared. Winter couldn't calm his heart rate. He yanked a screw from the doorframe and carved Piper's initials into his prosthetic arm with the screw.
“Tony, I understand these suits are part of you, but they aren’t part of us. I need you to refocus on our family. I need you more present. We need you more present," said Steve. He went to the stairs.
“You’re the head of a powerful agency, and you came here personally to show a three-year-old photos. You coulda got anyone to do that. Probably would have worked better if you did cause my parents don’t like you all that much right now. So I'm guessing the person you originally wanted to ask didn't find scary and refused, meaning it would have to be one of the Avengers. I say Aunt Nat refused. Or you thought this was just too important a task to let someone else do it. You wouldn’t have shown me that picture if the woman didn’t have some kind of involvement.”
Steve's skin grew hot. He nodded, desperate for release. Tony raised his chin, kissing him. The alpha’s lips were soft and guiding, slowly deepening the union of their mouths. They fell back into the couch with alpha on top of him. Tony weight rested between his legs. Their hips rocked together, creating incredible friction. It all came so fast. His toes curled as his back arched of the couch.
Tony working again didn't bother him. Since the alpha was his own boss he could work whenever for as long as he wanted. Every few hours he would come up and check on him and Piper.
"Zemo has served her purpose. Now we have a sleeper agent in the Stark girl that can be activated at a moment’s notice. You, on the other hand, are failing in the simple task I assigned to you."
Steve looked away. He wasn't deserving of that level of adoration. "I'm sure you would have gotten there without me."
The shield’s pattern took on a silver and blue coloration. Even with what Tony added there was no change in the weight or feel of his shield.
Steve settled for breakfast while Tony made his business call. He hoped he'd be able to spend this upcoming heat clear-headed. He wanted to be truly present when it happened. Tony came back several minutes later. His expression told him it hadn’t gone well.
He sipped his coffee, having finished his assigned task. It was peaceful. He could easily imagine many mornings like this. Tony placed a plate with two large omelets on it.
“Dr. Edith Star, this Happy Hogan. He’ll be your new best friend for the next eight months," he said.
Slowly, she unwound, going limp against him. Her breathing evened out after several minutes. Bruce loosened his hold on her. She stood briefly on her own before falling back into his chest.
The elevator stopped. He pulled off Tony’s shirt, taking a moment to admire. The smell of Tony’s arousal and the natural alpha scent was intoxicating. It engulfed their small confines. Their lips locked in a messy kiss. They slid to the floor. Tony stared at him. Steve squirmed under the intense attention. Tony snarled, causing him to shiver. Steve shed his clothes. He lay naked on a layer of clothes. Steve spread his legs and bared neck to the alpha. Tony removed his clothes slowly. The alpha was teasing him!
“A reminder Sir maintenance is due on the arc reactor."  Letting Steve literally hold his heart would earn him some points. He pushed away the screen. Tony closed his eye and tried getting some sleep.
The flight back was delayed by an hour. By the time the reached the training facility, it was twelve in the morning a new day. He rushed to his room, not even bothering to change out of his tactical gear. Steve grabbed his phone there were no messages or missed calls from Tony. He called him. The phone rang.
“Sure is.” He put down his glass and took the seat beside her. “Alright, where’d you like to start?”
"So we'll have to plan the event of the year in three months. Before you start showing," said Pepper.
Clint always smelled unmated. The alpha flipped up his collar realizing his mistake. He has a mate. Steve tried not to let the shock show in his expression. It didn’t bother him that Clint hadn’t told him with the alpha’s career it was understandable for him to keep those close to him a secret.
“So you do have a possessive side. I knew there was an imperfection in golden boy personality,” said Tony.
Tony gently kissed him, then led him to his lab, helping Steve into his nesting couch. He didn’t bother with saying he wouldn’t be able to sleep. They both knew that. He wished he could escape the buzzing in his mind. All he could think about was his pup. It must be so much worse for Tony.
A gauntlet came crashing through the window, slamming a guard in the back of the head. It wrapped around Tony hand. He shot the other guard, sending them both backward. Tony freed his arm and charged his other captor. A boot wrapped around his leg. He kicked the guard away. Tony took the man’s gun.
Soon, everyone was grabbing pizza and having fun. When they broke open the piñata, it was filled with Piper’s favorite candies: Sour Patch Kids, Twix, Kit Kats, and Peppermint Patties. This inevitably caused a sugar rush, which, thankfully, was short-lived. Then it was time for birthday cake. Steve lit the candles.
Steve was battling the same issue. He wanted his pound of flesh. Control felt impossible in a situation like this. Their daughter had been stolen.
“The doctors will explain. The chief of staff told me you can stay in his office. I’ll have someone show you there.”
“I thought that would be obvious. We all changed after losing you. All of us handled it in different ways. With Howard, it was drinking and women. Eventually, that grew old and threw himself into his work. The fun-loving playful side him faded by the time Anthony was born,” said Peggy.
"My room." That much was clear to her, but she didn't know where her room was. It wasn't any of the ones she'd come to know in New York City or Malibu.
The simple task of a silent stride would be twice as difficult for Piper. She would eventually have to do it in those high-heeled shoes women liked wearing. Winter huffed, hating the idea of her growing up. At least, as a child, they couldn't send her out into the field. She'd be relatively safe here, training.
“Shh, little one, it’s time to sleep,” Tony whispered. She seemed to settle. If only he could follow his own advice.
Piper glared at her. She hated when Lena did that, phrased something like a question when it really wasn’t one. Piper took Lena’s hand. The woman was rather insistent on her holding her hand. Winter let her wander, but Lena forced her to stay close. This only made Piper want to get away from her more. With Winter, she had choices. Something very rare here.
Natasha packed the few things she'd accumulated in her temporary home into a cardboard box. It was five in the morning. She shoved the box into the trunk of her crappy little car. The goal of leaving at this hour was to avoid a long goodbye, but she knew Helmut would be sneaking out for a morning smoke. From the corner of her eye, she spotted the orange glow of his cigarette.
His eyes managed to open. Piper lay across from him, muzzled and bound. If it weren’t for the rise and fall of her chest, he’d think her dead. He wanted to get closer, but mind control fought his instinctual urge, and in the end his body denied him. It was a sign. Winter’s feral state was breaking. He'd regain his senses but lost even a minimal state of free will.
“Steve we can’t. I can’t. I’m not saying this guilt trip you, but my heart can’t take it. That’s not me being romantic. Literally, the strain of not being together through will damage my heart beyond repair.”
When Bruce returned to the lab, Tony was on the couch with Piper asleep on his chest. Even with his beta nose, he could pick up on fading distress in the room.
"Amazing huh? It's nothing compare the man that brought you into the world. He's already done so much for you."
Steve couldn't stay in his room; it was suffocating. He escaped to the gym. Eventually returning to his room at ten. It was still early, yet he was exhausted. From under his bed, he took a shoebox. When he was young, he kept a box of sentimental treasure under his bed. It was a habit that continued through to adulthood. In the box were Howard’s letter and the locket holding Peggy’s image. Steve took the MoMA ticket from his pocket and placed it in the box. He folded the pillowcase and placed it alongside the ticket. Then put it under the bed. Steve went to his desk and disassembled and cleaned his weapon. Once done, he set it in the drawer and washed his hands. Steve stretched and yawned. He needed sleep. He took his blankets from the bed and spread them on the floor. Should he call? He should say least thanks to Tony for taking him to the museum. Steve hadn’t gotten the chance to before he left with Natasha. It was the least he could do. He flipped open his phone. The background made him smile.
"By the time the cure was administered the Extremis had already integrated into her DNA. The bonding likely occurred when Extremis was first introduced to Steve's system. While in utero it adapted to best fit her system. Not only was accepted into her DNA, but perfected likely due to it being coupled with the super-soldier serum," said Bruce.
Phil tried teaching him how to use a cell phone, but he failed miserably. The lesson ended when his frustration got the best of him, and he accidentally crushed the cellular device. It wasn’t Phil’s fault. This phone was heavier in his hand. The buttons were large and had simple choices of yes or no.
The hours ticked by, and eventually, the pup fell asleep. All the fear melted from her expression. She whined softly when he moved her back to the bed. Food arrived a little while later. They'd brought two trays. This was the first time they'd done that. Luckily, she was too unaware to notice. It was even a breakfast menu. The pup needed to get some food in her system. She hadn't eaten in two days. He nudged her awake. Her blue eyes opened. They were dull. Sleep hadn't changed that.
Piper stared as his stomach. She thought he'd be bigger. Lena told her he pregnant. It could have been a lie. Or it could still be in the early stages. Six months was two heats. Every three months, she'd been dropped off with Aunt Pepper and Aunt Maria. It wasn't difficult to put it together. It was merely biology. The idea of Papa and Daddy doing that stuff was yucky. She closed her eyes, processing his scent. But she couldn’t pick up on any changes. Maybe he was wearing scent blockers.
Tony was already walking to the elevator. He groaned. Rhodes found him after his break up with Pepper. It was a fucking mess trying to get him into a stable state. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like with Steve. The two had been together a month maybe, but the way they were around each other made it seem longer. It would be catastrophic. That could drive Tony to do something dramatic to escape it. Only time would tell if what would happen.
Piper groaned. She'd gotten used to speaking freely with Winter. They hadn't bumped into any subjects that he was unable to speak on for a while. Piper had tried to avoid talking about things that could lead to a non-answer from him.
Rune’s eyes widened. He grabbed the beta’s arm and shook his head. "It's okay. I'll stay," she said, sitting back down.
“Jarvis, can you give me some light. Keep it dim." The light came up enough for him to get a clear look at what he was doing. None of the bites were deep enough to warrant stitches. “Tony."
As Tony washed, Steve shaved. He sighed, enjoying being freshly shaven. Steve turned when Tony rose from the tub.
“Steve, if that was true I would have already been exposed. I’m not showing any side effects. I’m only thinking out loud. You should try and sleep,” she said.
Steve found it impossible to relax for the rest of the day. He would love to go outside and clear his head, but there was a swarm of press and fans outside that he didn’t want to go through. He went to his studio, pulling a blank canvas from a shelf.
He wrapped her in it. Tony followed her to the bathroom. She readied the shower, setting it to the perfect temperature for a newborn.
He placed the metal case in front of her. It sprung open. She took out the sample. Happy took a seat on the couch. She started her work. She had a limited amount of time to study. Spending too long studying the sample would get Stark's attention.
“I don’t think you do. If something happens to him, I’m alone.” He ran a hand nervously through his hair. His feet tapped nervously against the ground.
Steve wanted to reach out and cuddle his mate. Steve sighed. He’d done his job. Now it was time to go home.
Once she left Tony got into bed with Steve. The omega nuzzled closely to him, seeking comfort, which he was more than willing to provide. He had to protect them. He'd failed to do that. As soon as he began to relax Natasha and Clint came storming into the room. He snarled not wanting anyone near his injured mate. Clint left not want to get into a fight with Stark. Natasha remained.
“Forty days I can make that,” said Tony. His head fell back into the pillow. That included Christmas. He still needed to get a present for Steve. Going overboard wouldn’t work with Steve.
“Okay, baby girl,” he said. Tony took her hand, helping her out of bed. He walked her to the bathroom, leaving Steve to clean up.
Winter pulled into a parking space and entered the bar. It smelled of fish and chips and stale beer. A crowd of alphas and betas stood around several flat screens, watching a soccer match. Winter took a seat in the corner of the bar, sinking into the darkness. He ordered a beer to help him look less out of place.
Steve showered toweling dry his hair. He stopped in front of the mirror. He ran his fingers over the small bump. It wouldn’t be much longer until they knew the gender. After their honeymoon, Bruce would reveal what he learned from the samples they sent. Tony hugged him from behind. The alpha had been all over him since he started showing. Not that he minded the extra affection. Tony started licking his neck.
“Not weapons,” Piper explained immediately. “I was thinking of fireworks. I'll be a firewoman that makes fireworks.”
He went upstairs in his suit. A stranger was in his den near his pregnant mate. It beckoned his protective instinct. There was little he could do to push it out. Helicopters circled above. A brunette beta woman stood at the entrance to his house. There was some vaguely familiar about her. Jarvis hadn’t picked up anything on her.
“They weren’t always diamond. Sometimes it was sapphire or even ruby. Only the ones that lasted more than a week got one,” said Steve. And those were few and far between.
Maria was unphased. "Hush, it's okay. She not going to hurt you, I promise," whispered Maria. The boy relaxed.
She poured him a glass of water. He stared at the ceiling trying to put things together. Clint would overcome this.
She seemed okay enough. The pup tiredly rubbed her eyes. He picked her up and plopped her on the bed.
Tony nodded. Crane came in. He was a middle-aged beta with thinning blond hair. Crane ran the normal physical exam, testing the range of motion of his shoulder.
Natasha rolled her eyes. Steve was a skilled painter. She'd seen the ones he’d sent to Tony, but the one in his room must be different.
A beta woman came in. The woman scowled at her. There was no sympathy. The people working here never had it, but Piper kept hoping to find kindness. Her muzzle was unstrapped, and a spoon was pressed to her mouth. Piper's hunger outweighed her pride.
Loki tilted his head to the side an extremely common in omegas. That explains the inferiority issue better.
“About fifty-eight tons,” said Phil. He took a seat on one of the bleachers and took a timer from his jacket.
“No one said the high road is easy, but all I ask you to do is try. Even I find it difficult at times and find myself wandering off it,” said Steve.
"Fine, it takes more than that to shake me up. I just don’t like a stranger so close to our den,” said Steve.
“I missed some important milestones. My son’s first steps, Emma’s first heartbreak among other things. I tried making it up to them spending as much time as I could with them."
Where was the child getting this will power to fight back? To openly challenge him without fear, even when she knew of the consequences. He thought that side of her had been squashed.
She began to gasp when pale blue gas emitted from the wall vents. In the distance, she heard Winter calling for her. A small whine passed her lips as she faded into unconsciousness. Joseph was quietly pleased with what he'd seen. She’d taken out armed guards without hesitation. Her movements were fluent. Not a single movement wasted. But there was still more refinement needed. Pierce would be impressed. Of course, a few details would have to be edited out, such as the pup's extreme disobedience of not following direct orders from superior. That would be resolved soon enough.
Winter didn’t release the commanding hold until the pup was forced into sleep. It was for the pup’s own good. The woman smiled, leaning back in her chair; gentle expression fading, replaced by a cool calculating gaze.
Steve flung his shield at gaining the alphas’ attention. This pointless destruction they were allies. They were acting like children. Well, at least he was getting some practice in before the pup was born.
“It won’t always be easy, but I’m comfortable with him. I’m not running into this blind. I’ll be careful,” said Steve.
"I know that!" Piper collected, only to lapse into emotion again. "I'm here safe, yet my brain still thinks I'm at that place. And I don't know why! I don't know how to change that. It's so frustrating!"
Winter didn’t know where to go from this point. He’d interrogated before but was given a list of wanted information. From there he could form a question.
“I can't tell you what Steve sees in you, you'll have to ask him. We don’t choose who we love in love with. It would be simpler if we did,” said Peggy.
His friends left. He sighed. The company was nice. It went better than he thought. Hopefully, one of the two would do for him. If not, he'd been going through his heat alone. Steve cleaned up. He couldn’t resist opening up to Tony’s slide. The alpha was handsome and oozed confidence.
His eyes grew heavy. He didn't want to close them. Every time he fell asleep beside his mate, he'd wake up alone.
Steve settled beside him. Tony was drawn from his work by Steve’s incessant purring. He took the bowl from Steve. The omega’s growl was soothed with a kiss. The taste of mango lingered on his lips. He ran his hands down Steve’s body. They fell back onto the couch.
"If someone snapped a photo of you coming in, the press will be here in a matter of minutes," said Pepper.
They didn't. The alphas seemed to be enjoying themselves; finding sick happiness in hurting someone who couldn't fight back.
Tony sighed."I have the full blueprints for the machine but hardly anything on the serum. The few bits and pieces I have don't have anything to connect it with," said Tony.
"Good, there are no signs of malnutrition. Dr. Star and I were concerned that she may not get proper nutrients from your milk, but your body has adapted to support a growing super soldier pup. You need to increase your calorie take in to support that.”
"Can you take this off?" asked Steve, pointing to the collar. He didn't enjoy feeling like some tagged animal.
“I’ll have something to report you tomorrow maybe the day after that at the latest.” Bruce toasted a bagel before returning the lab. It had been quiet nice living with the Stark family.
She snarled. Winter raised his head at the sound, carefully observing the two. The beta was harmless as long as they were within the cell.
He settled down, bathing in the warm light; only opening his eyes when several sets of footsteps could be heard coming down the hall. Several men dressed in black uniforms were wheeling large wooden crates. It didn’t concern him. Growling when Rumlow disturbed him by tapping on the glass, he straightened his stance only to crumble.
“I know. You’ll find a way to make it up to me,” he said, but that didn’t make it any less disappointing.
Natasha tensed. There was something in his voice that caught her attention. He was trying to hide something. The man was one of the worst lairs she'd met.
She stared blankly at the ground. He shook her shoulders, which only gained him her empty gaze for a moment. Heart and lungs sounded fine. There was no visible damage to her head.
She ran her hands along the metal panels. He seemed more at ease with her touching his prosthesis than actually touching him. There were chips and scratches marking the metal. She held his arm in hers, getting a weight of it. It felt about twelve pounds.
“Angry? No. Steve deserved better than me. I got a chance to live my life. He deserves that as well,” she said.
She’d rather be with him near the science lab. Piper had gotten into some trouble when she hacked into S.H.I.E.L.D's network from the daycare's computer. She hadn't gotten far before she was caught. They'd tried getting a sitter but she acted out scaring them off. The only babysitters she tolerated were friends and family. Steve sighed, then woke her up and gave her breakfast.
Piper sighed giving up the verbal argument, continuing the conversation may hurt Papa. That was the last thing she wanted. It wouldn't stop her from looking into it though. She would have Jarvis download some books on the brain.
It had to be the pregnancy. Alphas were hardwired not harm one in such a condition. Instincts weren't allowed to play a part in his life.
He took shelter behind an ice machine. The dog tags tinged against in microwave before the explosion went off. He slowly got his feet. Scared citizens ran passed him. Hanging on the electrical wire above him was the woman. She didn’t seem to be waking up. There was a groan of metal behind him. The water tower was tilting toward him.
She tried lifting with all her strength. The glass was bulletproof, strong and durable, impossible for the average person to break. She stepped back, slamming her body full speed against the glass. It cracked. On her third attempt, a small panel shattered. She helped the others get outside and down the ledge.
Winter came to the middle of the room, sitting across from her. She shuffled the cards, thinking of the simplest games that Theodore might understand. Her favorite game was twenty-one, but apparently, counting cards was a bad thing. That would probably be too difficult for Theodore. The easiest game she could think of was war. She split the deck in half, giving one half to him.
“I see no reason to waste my time with touchy-feely bullshit. Let’s just see if compatible,” said Tony.
“Thank you, he wasn’t always like that. He was a trickster yes we played pranks when we were young. Such we had laughter,” said Thor.
"RUNE!" Piper screamed at the air as Sir’s jet took off, airborne with Rune asleep inside, his crate still secured to the jet’s floor.
"I made you a promise. It will be here soon. It's a bit of a junker, so we'll have to build it from the ground up."
. The girl had made a challenging opponent the few times they'd played previously. She'd rather be working on the pup's programming, but Rune's actions had made Piper aware something was amiss. Lena knew that the battle between Rune and Piper may have this risk. But it could be corrected easily enough over time.
She’d struggled to build an uneasy feeling of safety in the cell. That was all torn away in a moment by a simple nightmare. Winter brought her back to bed. Instead of returning to his corner, he remained next to her. She closed her eyes.
"Who will teach me?" Piper wondered. Lena’s description sounded ominous and not at all like the school she’d always imagined.
But that admission would be the last step before relinquishing all his vaunted independence. An independence which had cost him his pup, so he couldn’t let go of it now. Steve was always a person with a plan even if the most chaotic of situation. Somehow Tony had managed to find some level of calm. He wanted that. Steve wanted to be that put together.
They went up to the kitchen. The two finished off the leftovers from earlier. Steve started on the apple pie. Tony laughed when Steve growled at him when he tried having some. The omega blushed pushing the pan toward him. Nearly half was gone.
Steve flushed. Tony made him blush with little difficulty. He was sure he wasn't the only person the alpha had that effect on. The plane landed.
Steve nodded. There was a faint clink as Tony locked the bracelet around his wrist. The alpha kissed him goodbye, before going to his lecture. Steve woke up about an hour later. He got dressed and called Happy.
“Tony, you’re growling.” The deep feral sound sent a pleasurable shiver down Steve's back. He shook away the effect. Steve gently squeezed Tony's hand. The growling slowly stopped. “You can trust me to handle myself."
“The public only knows about three, but here’s the thing nobody can id the device. There are no bomb casings.”
Steve smiled. He’d been waiting to call Tony, not wanting to seem too eager. Steve stepped back from his painting. It was a three by four feet canvas. The style was different from the gentle touch of his watercolor pieces. The thick brushstrokes leaked aggressive emotions that he was unable to voice. The image was one of the memories that replayed in his sleep. Its sky was painted with heavy black and grays, with explosions orange and white artillery fire. A silver plane could be seen amongst the fray, near it was a small parachute. The foreground was an agitated mix of black and red. Why he painted it, he didn't fully understand. Barny thought this was a healthy therapeutic way for him to work through his PTSD.
“It is. They are as dangerous, but won’t be as hesitant to hurt you as me. You’re safer not knowing them.”
Matt watched the omega from the kitchen. He was hit by warm orange aura flowing off Steve’s skin. There stretch and pull of fabric as Steve tugged the shirt over his head.
“It was Tony!” Steve pushed away from the comforting embrace and stood, instantly stepping on one of the Legos hidden in the carpet.
Tony went to put on his shirt. Steve grabbed it before he could. “Don’t skin to skin contact helps."
The two were never far from each other rest of the day. Cuddling helped build reassurance. Steve fell asleep earlier than usual. Tony fingers twitched. He went into the bedroom and got into bed. Tony closed his eyes trying to sleep. He tossed and turned in bed, waking up Steve.
Piper's bedtime rolled around. She was already nodding off halfway through Outrageous Acts of Science.
“Thank you,” said Tony. That gesture meant nothing good. “I didn't know. Even if I did, I couldn't stop him. Once he makes up his mind, there's nothing I can do to change it. We needed him out there. The pup is fine," said Tony.
"I know of him. He was big in the late '40s and early '50s. They called him the Russian Bear, one of the founding fighters of the sport. He tore apart every opponent put in front of him," said Paninya.
Steve stepped into the lab. Both alphas were gawking at him. Rhodes was breathing heavily through his mouth.
Tony shook his head. He doubted the kid believed in that, for now, he could along with the story, instead of telling the true reasoning behind the shadows.
Tony eyes opened when he was sure his friend was asleep. He took out his phone and pressed on Steve’s number.
Steve took the position. Tony’s breath caught in his throat. He deeply took in the omega's scent. Tony could almost taste the tart-sweet scent. He ran his fingers over those smooth round cheeks. Tony ran his tongue over the wet leaking slit.
“I’ll bring something.” Tony didn’t have much faith in the new lead. But he hoped he was wrong, that it would lead to something. Piper had to be out there somewhere. He should have put a tracker on her. They went up to the roof where Jarvis had the jet waiting for them.
“How would you know how he’d treat them?” asked Steve. He couldn’t stop the growl in his voice. There was a gagging sound at the other end of the phone.
“You are not the omega I need to take care of. You made it clear that you don’t want that from me,” said Tony. That sent off an entirely new wave of anger.
“I don’t have that answer. If they did Steve they won't only be after the pup but you. To get the best effect they will catch while pregnant introduce the fetus to substances which they believe will strengthen it. I don’t say this to scare, but to warn you of the threat,” said Bruce.
Steve shook his head. Tony helped him out of bed. Steve sat on the bathroom counter. Tony filled the tub and checked the temp. It was perfect. He took off Steve’s medical gown and underwear. Tony took a seat next to Steve on the bathroom floor.
They’d play the same but she’d just have to figure out a new name for it. Seeing that Theodore had something against the word war. He nodded. His posture seemed more relaxed from seconds ago. Theodore settled across from her.
He sped toward them. Dodging attacks and firing back. He wouldn’t be able to handle this alone. The best he could do for the moment was trying to keep them at their source for as longs as possible, too many had already reached the city.
“Coming Daddy.” Piper went down the slide, where Daddy was waiting for her at the end. “Do I have to go?” Piper hit him with puppy dog eyes.
“Even then, I was more than you’ll ever be. You’re only an alpha born with a silver spoon your mouth, leeching off your father’s name. You aren’t even a fraction of the alpha he was. You’re just a spoiled brat unused to not getting what you want!” screamed Steve.
Steve ran his fingers through the alpha’s hair. He could ask Tony the same thing. He was happy they were brought together. They nuzzled each other.
Steve was brought out of the thought when his phone vibrated. He accepted the call, putting it on speaker.
“But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?” he said.
Now that her panic had cleared, she smelled Play-Doh, not the chemical smell that would have come with a substance like C4.
He watched the girls run out of the room. When he turned his attention back the Mandarin was crawling on the floor. This ragged bearded beta wasn't the Mandarin. This guy had to be double. Tony set off a warning shot. He'd wasted his time on this! The beta crawled back to the seat.
Her eyes opened, holding a new shade of glowing blue. Branches of the blue light glimmered underneath her skin. She screamed a wave of glowing blue power echoed through the room.
He stumbled into the hall, following the scent of coffee to the kitchen. Steve poured himself a large mug. He took a few sips before finally starting to wake up.
Steve came out of the shower awhile later, a towel wrapped lowly around his waist. His eyes wandered down the omega's form. Steve lost the baby weight, regaining his muscular form. But there was a slight widening to his hips, which Tony loved. It had been three months, one week, and five days since they last had sex.
Winter woke early. Something was wrong. He went to the door of their enclosure, gently tugging on the handle, locked. It hadn’t been locked for weeks. Something was happening. It couldn’t be good.
“I’ve heard enough. You’re not him, the Mandarin. The real guy. WHERE?!” This had to be some kind of look alike. “WHERE?! WHERE’S THE MANDARIN!”
Tony appeared on the phone. Steve found himself calming. He held back the phone so Tony could get a better look at him. The alpha relaxed. “I was shot."
Before Steve could act the omega tackled the alpha. His moves were swift easily dodging the slow moves of his opponent, striking at his joints.
Once they were packed, they loaded the car, driving in the direction of Peggy's. About ten minutes in, Steve was out like a light. The soldier could sleep better in a car than in their bed. Tony didn't take it personally. He was glad the omega was sleeping.
“Said they give me more. And they gave me things. They give me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.”
She nodded. He carried her to the master bathroom. The bath was ready. He helped Piper out of his clothes and lowered her into the tub.
“No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin, well you’re looking right at him. It was always me, Tony, right from the start. I AM THE MANDARIN!”
A wave of blue energy shot through the room, shattering the glass, sending them crashing backward. Winter's attackers stumbled toward the exit, slamming into the door. But their fate was seal as soon as they'd entered the room. The door was locked.
"He needs to break that feral state willingly. All he needs is a reason and we've provided him with that."
"Steve, if need to go talk to one of your groups. You can," said Tony. Steve always seemed better after attending one. Something about hearing the problems of others took his mind off his own.
Lena smiled down at them, already thinking of the generation after them. Godly strength and genius intellect. What a combination the two would make. It would be at least fifteen years before they could be introduced to such a matter. But such a creation would be better done artificially anyway, rather than through anything that could create too powerful of a union.
She closed her eyes. He wrapped his sleeping bag around Natasha so she would stay warm. Steve quickly zipped the tent closed behind him. He watched the sunrise. The campsite slowly came to life. The work was slow. Fleur seemed to be doing it intentionally to get back at him.
"Who hurt you?" he asked. The mental restraints on his mind loosen to some extent when it concerned the pup.
While his mate slept, he stared at the ceiling. He was so tempted to leave. His hands idly twitched. Sleep something he needed but didn’t want. Those hours could be used better in his lab. Fuck, what kind of husband was he? He used to love the peacefulness of sleeping beside Steve. That joy was stolen. Sleep brought darkness and unknowing.
Steve lazily rolled onto his side. A slim rectangular box rested on the bedside table. It was wrapped in gold paper and tied with a red ribbon. He set the box in his lap. Steve timidly opened the lid only to slam it shut. Blush burned his cheeks. Tony left him a sex toy! It shouldn't be as embarrassing as it was. Actually, it was quite ordinary, for such objects to be bought and used when alpha couldn't attend to their omegas while in heat. His face went red again at thought of Tony buying it for him. He picked up the letter that had been taped to the present. It took him a bit to work through Tony's chicken scratch handwriting.
Suddenly, the punching bag was flung across the room, taking a chunk of the ceiling with it. Papa collapsed, clutching his head; screaming as if he were trying to block out some non-existent sound. She should leave, but her feet were glued in place.
Steve nodded. They sat at a desk and started planning out the project. There were a few disagreements and bickering, but it was nothing serious. They spent the entire day in the lab.
After his appointment, he wandered the halls of S.H.I.E.L.D. There was a tap on his shoulder. His fist slammed into the wall, leaving a large crater in the cement. Widow barely managed to avoid him.
The beta left. Sir moved from behind the desk. He spread a newspaper on the floor, then set a chair on the newspaper. Piper gasped when he yanked her onto the chair by the collar of her straight jacket. She heard the metallic slid of a knife being taken from its sheath.
Steve settled by his side again.  He was never much for cuddling, but he could make an exception for Steve. The touch of their skin was almost electric. The movie started playing. Steve started purring softly.
Tony watched as Steve went straight to the master bedroom. He grabbed their bags from the trunk, taking them into the bedroom. Steve was already working on his nest, paying him no attention.
“My boyfriend,” said Steve. He couldn' say ex. How had Tony even found him? There was a tapped against the window. Tony was floating outside the window. Steve scowled. But was partly thrilled that the alpha had come in search of him.
“With that amount, you get a wing named after you." Another addition to the list of buildings, which held the Stark name it was sure to go to the billionaire's head.
He was out of feral state. This would be easier if he were. He wouldn’t have those blue eyes staring at him nervously.
“You could quit. Stay here as you get your degree. Travel see the big art capitals of the world,” said Tony.
The child tensed. Someone was coming. Piper pressed against his side, and his arm wrapped protectively around her. The door opened. A beta with a tray of food entered their surroundings. Winter moved his arm away, the man wasn't a threat. The beta slid the tray through the slot and left. Winter pulled the tray to him and sat in the center of the room. The child was waiting for him to do something. He tasted the food, making sure it was safe for the child, before pushing it toward her.
Tony understood Steve’s reasoning. He was right in hiding it from him, but it didn’t make it any easier to accept. But was going to stop him. He got down one knee in front of Steve.
Tony fell back in the bed. He was running on a completely different time zone. Steve pulled a blanket over the sleeping alpha. There was a small temptation to join him, but he'd spent enough time in bed. There was a knock on the door. He was quick to answer it, not wanting it to bother Tony who was now sleeping.
Tony smiled when Steve's posture relaxed. He started purring and nuzzling Piper. She gleefully giggled nuzzling against Steve. The omega got into the nesting couch. Tony tried returning his work to give the two some personal time, but he couldn't resist checking on them.
“We’ll be there for her every step of the way,” said Tony. He hoped that was enough to repair the damage inflicted. They were young; they could bounce back.
“Stay in here as long as you’d like, sweetie.” She watched as Daddy struggled to crawl out of the tube.
"The enemy I fought seven decades ago I still fight today. They set things in motion. But we are the ones that created this life. I will not let them take credit for our daughter."
“Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there. But we thought it best to break it to you slowly,” said Fury.
“Tony as much as I want to stay like this we have to get ready." Tony slowly sat up, straddling his waist.
“I’m your government-endorsed babysitter. I’m being paid to be here, but I think it's unneeded. It's clear all you want to do is get back to him."
The alpha was asking him to bare his neck, not forcing him. He would have naturally done it, but the question snapped him from the instinct.
Steve instantly stopped his feet. Instead, he clenched the armrests. In his head, he kept repeating that Tony was okay. He was probably making something over nothing. Steve bit his lip. He should have never gone.
He crumpled the paper in his hand. “I’m going to find a heavy-duty COMPSTAT right now. I need your login."
Tony agreed it was beautiful, but it didn’t have the same meaning to him as it did to Steve. Steve took a seat on the bench across from the painting. He sat next to the omega.
He carefully set her in the playpen. Tony packed a diaper bag. Steve wasn't functioning today. He didn't want to expose Piper to that and Steve wouldn't either. So he would take over parenting today. He grabbed the bottles from the fridge and shoved them into the bag, before picking up Piper. Dum-E and U came racing to him.
Strangers surrounded him on either side. The searing pain in his lower abdomen urged him to run, from this unknown setting. His fist slammed against the glass, causing it to shatter. He broke free, shoving past those who blocked the exit. Every movement hurt but the urge to find safety fueled him through it.
“You don’t have to go out of your way. I don’t want to impose. I can drive myself most places,” said Steve.
The stems cell of super-soldier the possibilities could be endless. To gather such a sample the pregnancy would have to be terminated.
Tony hung up. They'd been dating nearly a month. He hadn’t grown tired of Steve. The two were polar opposites; they should be at each other’s throats.
“I’m with you to end line.” It was once reserved for Bucky, but Tony more than deserved. He would go through hell and back for him.
He watched as his mate soaked. His belly poked out from the water. Those dazzling blue eyes were closed. Steve was at peace for the moment. He was so beautiful. A brief kiss pushed him from his shock. There was a slight blush across the omega's cheeks.
“You aren’t losing me anytime soon. I think that’s why aspects of the serum were transferred to me,” said Tony.
“Then you should be out celebrating. Seeing more of the world. I'm sure Stark would be happy to take you,” said Fury, stalking closer.
"I know." She just missed have something to hide behind; all it took was letting her hair down. "Can I have it back?"
Steve nodded and went to grab the beta. Tony could do this. The alpha disappeared. Steve helped the woman up, heading toward the door. They crashed through the glass door, tumbling onto the ground. The rest of the structure began to collapse.
Neither parent could read what their daughter was thinking. Her expression used to be so open, but it had become a more complicated read.
Steve groaned, clenching down on Tony’s hand. He braced against the alpha. They stood there for a minute as he worked through the pain. Tony cradled his hand as soon as he let go.
“He didn’t know. Killian did for the sole purpose of torturing me," said Tony. The alpha hands were clenched. Tony was locked in a state of tension.
It didn’t provide any defensive or offensive advantages. Maybe it was strategic? Winter looked a question at her, but the pup was already asleep. He took a seat by the bed, watching over her.
Tony leaned back into the nest. He couldn’t deny that it was comfortable. The blanket smelled of Steve. He already found himself calming. The twitching need to work faded. He pushed his nose into Steve’s neck. The omega’s purrs lulled him into a peaceful sleep.
"I wish it just that." Lust, he could get out of his system after a few rolls in the hay. "It would make things easier."
They all sat down too tired to move. Steve huddled close to him. Tony held him tight so afraid he may lose him again.
Steve nodded. They returned to the bunker. There were only three boxes left. The third one had Howard's notes on project rebirth. There were only two notebooks.
"Oh." He fell back into blankets loss in how the alpha's fingers worked him so perfectly. Steve gasped. "No, no, not now."
He settled in bed next to Steve. The omega stayed to one side of the bed, not cuddling close as before. He craved the closeness they shared not long ago. It was something he never wanted before. Previously he felt confined by it.
The playful tone left the alpha, it was replaced protective stern one. Steve enjoyed it sometimes but now wasn’t one of those times. He’d had enough alpha posturing for one day.
“It’s different,” said Bruce. He appreciated the comparison. It was sound reasoning but even close to being the same.  Tony cleared the monitor he was working on, forcing his attention.
Ever so often their lips would meet. Steve was close. There was a boiling coil of pressure building his stomach.
"You can enjoy yourself. Stark doesn't mind having you around. Call when you're on your way back. Enjoy breakfast," she said.
“That guilty look you get when you know you've done something wrong. Last I saw it was when you somehow blew up my garage using only a broken toaster,” said Peggy.
"Why were you scared? You could have told me sooner. I would have been shocked not angry. Steve, I could never leave you."
He offered her his arm again. She searched for a control panel insertion point, moving behind him which caused him to turn to keep an eye on her. He moved, sitting with his back pressed against the wall. She found the insert and pushed her bobby pin into it. The panels lifting away revealing what was inside. She took stock of the work. The basic structure and functions she understood.
The question was answered Lena burst into Piper’s room. Rune instantly hid under his bed. While Piper stood firm glaring at the woman.
Tony pulled away, pressing a line of kisses down the beauty’s neck, sucking and nipping as he went. Biting down slightly harder at his claim, causing Steve's hips to roll against his. He slid his thigh between Steve's. His hand moved down to the curve of his rear, encouraging Steve into the rhythm. Another hand gently cupping the omega’s jaw. He pulls away looking down between, where their hips still rolled against each other. Before traveling his gaze upward to memorize the relaxed expression Steve wore, knowing it may be some time until he ever saw it again.
“You and Steve are going through a hardship, but if you don’t act on your instincts it will further strain your bond,” she said.
Steve woke in the earliest hours of the morning. Tears streamed down his face. As panic swarmed his heart. HIS BABY! Steve’s hands went to his stomach hoping for movement. He screamed.
He went to his friends. The rest of the climb was fine with the exception of Fleur’s flirting. They reached the base. Two large metal black doors had been dug out. Blue tents surrounded it. Scientists were running scans over the doors.
“Tony’s trinket,” he said. Steve touched the necklace, relieved it hadn't broken during the struggle.
Rune groaned. That meant science talk. It all went over his head. Couldn't they do whatever kids usually did? Even though he had no idea what that was.
Rune released her. Something had changed. She seemed more relaxed. Some of the tension was gone, and Rune could only hope that change was permanent.
Tony rolled his eyes. He slowly rose from his bed, glancing at his clock—three hours of sleep a new record for the week. As soon as he stepped into the kitchen, the room activated. The coffee maker started brewing.
“I thought it could help you. Even though whatever we had is over I didn’t want you holding onto to all this,” said Tony.
Winter didn't fight as he was manhandled into a standing position. Pierce grabbed his face, forcing him to look up.
Steve snarled. “I know guys with none of that and worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing that you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play. To lay down on the wire and let the other guy crawl over you,” he said.
“I don’t think you’ll fit into that tube, sweetheart,” said Tony, smiling easily. He crawled into the tube, feeling confined by the thick plastic walls. Glowing patterns were painted on the inside of the tunnel, giving it a comforting feel.
“Sorry, I got to split.” He shot into the sky. He had to get home. Make sure his mate was safe, despite Jarvis’ report. He tugged on the bond, trying to reassure himself as was flying.
That was a new one. He'd built suites capable of diving to incredible depths. It would make for an exciting challenge.
Piper was comfortable with Theodore. He was her only comfort. At first, she found his watching-over-her-so-intensely to be creepy, but she had gotten used to it. It was his way of offering comfort. He didn't seem to know any other way.
He nuzzled against Steve, nosing against his throat. Tony thoroughly scented the omega, checking for anything concerning. Nothing was wrong but he was slow to pull away afraid something may suddenly change. Steve grabbed his arm when he tried leaving the bed. He whined. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“Tony, this is precious."  It was a Christmas ornament. Two penguins in Santa's hats labeled Tony and Steve had an egg between them. The egg was labeled ‘on the way'. He brought Tony into a kiss. “Thank you.”
Tony held his mate against the door, slotting their bodies together. His eyes widen as he inhaled Steve's scent. The faint smell of milk mingled with the omega's honey vanilla scent.
Steve put a thin bandage on each side of his neck. They took on the shade and tone of his skin. It was almost impossible to tell the difference. He uncomfortably moved his head from side to side. He was wearing a lie.
He pulled up the footage on his watch. The fucking Avengers were making their way through the base. It wouldn't be long until they eliminated his men.
Winter jolted was from a peaceful trance when the pup started screaming again. Her hands covered her ears. He placed his hands over hers.
Steve stayed in bed until eight in the morning. He carefully moved the sleeping alpha from his chest, setting his head on a pillow. Steve kissed Tony's temple. He couldn’t take the scent that clung to his clothes. Steve threw them in the hamper. The smell of distress clung to his skin.
"You don't really care what he did to me. You want the bigger fish," said Piper. It pissed her off, but she understood. She wanted the big fish too. But she wanted to be the one to catch it.
"I've heard of her. She's written several hypotheses on the structure of super-soldier genetics," said Tony cautiously. She’d come scarily close to the makeup.
At first glance, some would believe two men opposites, but they shared core elements. There would be issues if the couple proceeded. They were both so god damn stubborn. But so determined. Their fights would only be outmatched by their passion.
Winter was a knight. Was she a knight as well? She didn't think she was a pawn. They wouldn't have gone through all the trouble they did if she were something that disposable.
Tony ran to the garage climbing into the nearest car. Other alphas would be near his omega! He sped to S.H.I.E.L.D, making it there in half the time. He ran into the lobby before he could get anywhere near Steve, Coulson got stopped. His form went rigid.
They worked through each exhibit. Half of them Tony couldn’t understand. He enjoyed Steve holding his hand, leading him from exhibit to exhibit. That smile so frequent as Steve tried to explain the artworks to him. They finally made it to Starry Night. It was a beautiful painting, but after, seeing he was ready to move on. He preferred something he could tactilely interact with. Steve seemed to see so lost in the painting.
Steve watched the scenery change as they drove out of the city. The entire drive Tony barely went over the limit. The pulled into Peggy's driveway. Piper slept the entire drive there. Steve unbuckled Piper from her seat. He carefully tucked into his jacket, protecting her from the cold. Peggy hurried to open the door for them, rushing them inside. Tony helped him out of his jacket.
When he entered the bedroom, he saw Steve was huddled under the blankets. Tony pulled down the covers slightly, placing a gentle kiss on Steve’s forehead, before laying down on top the duvet and wrapping his arms around the omega. Steve had bad days that extend could into a bad week. All he had to do was wait it out. He couldn’t fall back to sleep even with the omega in his arms. Tony carefully carded his fingers through Steve’s hair earning a sleepy purr. An hour later, Steve woke up.
“When we were dancing it made me think of the moment before the crash. Peggy was telling me how’d we go dancing,” said Steve.
Steve regained consciousness. He was jammed into a small cage, next to Pepper. They were somewhere new. He could smell saltwater and oil. She was slowly regaining consciousness. Killian was watching over her. The man had his shield.
Tony flew across Brooklyn in a desperate search for Steve. It shouldn’t be this hard to find a six-foot barefoot super soldier! He’d been searching for hours.
He slowly pulled away from Steve, taking his hand, trying to lead him to bed. Steve's hand slipped from his.
Steve watched as Tony examined each of his paintings. He played with his fingers waiting for a response. If they were bad he wished the alpha would just get it over with and tell him so.
"That brat really you up messed. Decades of being an emotionless hunk of meat and you're finally feeling something. Who thought you could be so easily undone?"
He texted Tony that he was leaving. Happy pulled the car up to the front of the hotel and opened the door for him.
Tony got to the hospital. It hadn’t taken him long for California. He found peace in the sky flying at top speeds. A nurse lead him to Happy’s room. The man was in rough shape but he was breathing on his own.
“We need a science and disposal teams here as soon as possible. Romanian Division won’t be able to handle this alone,” said Natasha.
“Don’t apologize. I don’t want to hear it.” He didn’t it like it when she apologized, especially when it was for no reason. The pup never upset him.
Tony rushed down to the lab. He grabbed a pair of gauntlets. The newly repaired Dum-E came wheeling over to him with a toolbox. He flipped open the lid, seeing if the bot forgot anything. Tony put a few extra things in the box.
“This 1200 cc of Extremis. Less than half of this can kill the average person. It could take hours for it to take effect. I wonder how it will interact with that serum pumping through you? Shall we find out?”
Piper smirked, seeing the shift. It was slight, but it was there. For a brief moment, Bloom was afraid. That was a mistake Lena never made. This beta was nothing compared to one she'd faced for six months. She'd only have push a bit further to make sure she didn't return.
Tony didn’t know if Jarvis’s interface was making him say that, or if the AI had developed the level of emotional intelligence required to miss someone.
Tony sped ahead of the jet. Steve bit his lip.  Please, let him be careful. He took a seat in. This was his only chance to rest before the battle started.
He accepted the offer. Bruce was unused to people who knew what he was being so willing to offer physical connection.
The recent attack on the president and the end of the Mandarin was the main story. It was followed by the arrest of the vice president. The replacement would be Joe Biden. The feed cut off and changed to the cooking channel.
She took Steve's hand and led him into the living room. They sat on the couch. Piper was starting to wake up. Steve took her out of the penguin jacket. She blinked a few times before squirming. Steve knew that look. She was seconds away was from crying.
Scraps of paper fell out. There were about fifty. Steve unfolded one, reading it aloud. “I hate broccoli.”
Piper took his hand, willingly following him to bed. He settled in the cushy blue and white spotted chair in the corner of the room while Piper looked over her bookshelf. She put Horton Hears a Who in his lap, before snuggling up against his side. Steve opened the book.
This was only an awakening phrase. It could be changed easily enough. That was a benefit to working with a child. Their brains were flexible to train. Lena had engrained several phrases and words to trigger different responses from the girl. She'd implanted an erase phrase that would set in place new activations codes only known to her and erase all previous memories as insurance. One could never be too safe while working with Hydra.
“A few days. Who are they from?" she asked. Kate had caught a glimpse of the return address. What was Stark trying to pull? Kate wanted to see how he'd answer.
“Tony, I know what you’re thinking, but we have to help the president. Steve would want that,” said Rhodes.
“I believe this is a case of postpartum depression that has been aggravated by PTSD and survivor's guilt. The issues are entangled, fueling each other. You aren't the worse case I've seen. Relatively speaking, your postpartum depression minor. I believe your episode was so strong because it repressed."
“Olivia and Isabella. The Make A Wish Foundation sent me their wishes. They wanted to be flower girls. I couldn’t say no. This means so much to them. That makes this day all the more special, knowing Tony and I could do this for them and their families,” said Steve.
His mate fell into the fire below. Tony couldn't breathe. He searched for anything that would show his mate was alive. It was as if his heart had been ripped from his chest. His family was gone.  They'd slipped through his fingers. And was his fault! He let shock wash over him.
Even unconscious the omega's hands rested protectively over his stomach. He pried them away. For a moment, he lingered on the omega's swollen stomach. His mask filtered out the heavy panicked scent of the omega, which allowed his focus not to be so easily swayed by something as trivial as scent. He raised the man's shirt and took the serum dose from his bag. He took out the self-injecting syringe locked in place on the omega's stomach. A fleeting whine left the target as the needle pierced his womb.
“What? It wasn’t like he was going to hand over his car keys to a three-year-old willingly,” she said with a shrug.
It took a moment for him to respond. "Sorry, Tony, I don't know where my mind is. What did Bruce say?"
He pressed snow against his face. The stinging cold sensation gave him something focus on until he was brought back to a better state of mind. He threw the snow at Harley.
Tony nodded. Steve offered him a bottle of water. The alpha drank heavily. Steve sighed as the alpha stroked his neck, causing him to purr. His skin grew hot. Despite his growing lust, he recognized how exhausted his alpha was, yet his body shook with need. Tony was already responding to his aroused scent. He was growing more and more desperate for release. Steve thought of taking care of it himself, but it wouldn’t satisfy his heat crazed need. Tony caught him in a kiss. Steve pulled away. Tony was still feral. It wouldn't be fair for them to be together, he'd be taking advantage. Alpha didn’t care. He seemed more than willing to help him even in his exhausted state. Steve reconnected their lips, Tony’s arms wound around him. The kiss was messy and enthusiastic, a display of their need for each other. A feverish heat spread through him. His next wave arrived. Tony kiss grew harder, deepening their kiss. Alpha nipped at his bottom lip. Tony’s tongue pushed into his mouth, where it tangled with his. They pulled apart breathless. A haze clouded Steve's mind. The alpha's scent was growing stronger. He connected their lips again with the same frenzied passion.
The thought stirred his lust. Comfort turned to lust. Soon he was met by an unwanted issue. Slick wet between his legs and tent began to form in his shorts. Tony didn’t react, but the scent of his lust was clear.
Tony looked up from his work. Steve was hidden in his nest. It was helpful having the nesting couch in his lab. He slept better there. It was saturated with the smell of a happy pregnant omega. He went to the small drawer of food he kept and put Steve's favorite snack in the nest so it would have it when he woke up.
“I’m not after your alpha. He’s not my type. I had a cover as his assistant for a while,” said Natasha.
Tony got out of bed and wheeled in the cart. The smell of food woke Steve up. It didn’t take long for him to finish off the order. Once done, he settled down by his mate. After that heavy meal, Steve would be out the rest of the day. He hoped that morning sickness wouldn’t ruin the day. Tony ran his hand over Steve’s stomach. The touch drew purr from the sleeping being.
Piper went to Theodore’s corner. He didn’t seem bothered by her being this close. She moved his arm, huddling against his side, and wrapped his arm around her. This was the safest place here.
He walked across the room, sitting next to the omega. Matt reached out slowly. He ran his fingers over the omega’s soft skin and strong features. Matt dropped his hand, letting the slid down Steve’s arm. Just that touch gave him a great sense of Steve's muscle it felt like iron. What would they be like flexed? Matt returned to his seat. Touching the omega only left him with more questions.
