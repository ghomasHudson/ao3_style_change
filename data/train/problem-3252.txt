Dean walked Castiel to the hotel and told him he would pick him up for a late lunch before the book signing in the afternoon. The author behind the book was a dream. His eyes were not of this world.
“Hello guys, it is bed time” said Meg entering the room “You must be the big little brother, Meg Masters, Castiel´s night nurse” she introduced herself
“If you go there like this, he will suffer. Calm down first, then put on some scent neutralizer for a minute and think about happy times, then enter” she said making him understand. He did as Meg had told him and after 30 minutes he entered the room and sat by his side.
“Oh god… you are so big babe…. Move Dean” Cass asked him, he couldn´t see his mate right now so he couldn´t see how broken Dean was for a moment. For Cass it had been months but for him… it had been years. He composed himself when hearing Cass beg to be fucked and go it with the program, fucking wildly into his mate, the skin with skin slaps were only  in rivalry by the moans and groans of the couple and suddenly, Dean was knotting him and Cass was screaming his orgasm coating the bed with his release. Dean maneuvered him into his sides and kissed his mating mark. He was shaking
They have moved closer without even noticing and now they were full on scenting each other. It was intoxicating.
"I can see four, all healthy, you can hear their heartbeats" the doctor let them hear the four heart beats.
"A girlfriend?...I think you are a little young for that Jack, we have talked about how to do this" Dean said
Cass remembers this phase of pregnancy. Being super horny. The difference now he had a mate to drive crazy.
"What I need if for you to fuck me" said Castiel loudly " I am horny Dean ,all the damm time, horny! And you would please me and it is not enough! You know why???" Said Castiel demanding Dean to look at him
"holier-than-thou" said Dean "but in the end, they are just like us. You are a smart cookie you know?" Dean said "Making people reflect of theology by writing a book about a gay couple in love.
"Only a visit they have some vintage cars to restore but it is just a visit to see what we do I can manage. Rest. Doctors orders" said dean kissing him on the temple "love you".
" he didn't make it sir, he jumped a red light, I saw it all" he said while going back to his phone.
The doctor had asked him to wait outside. It had happened once while he had been there in the last 5 years, a long term patient waking up. He had seen the rush of doctors and nurses, tests and family…. He had wished for it to happen to them so hard… maybe someone had finally listened to all his payers. Dean tried to contain the tears and dialled Sam.
Oliver Winchester was born on April 24th, it came to this world with 4 kilograms and a loud and powerful set of lungs. When Dean held him in his arms he cried and cried for hours. It was a miracle and he was a dad. All his family was there, Sam, Bobby, Charlie, mom…. It was perfect. He kissed Cass a million times and more that day. What a precious baby they had done together.
Dean stood up and prepared two mugs of hot cocoa and stated talking about his feelings, about what Jensen and Misha had, how than made him feel, how he related to their solitude and how he felt like they had found a one in a lifetime type of love... only to be separated by death...  "I would have fallen for him too, no matter the risk"
"I can already scent the baby mingling with your scent" said Dean"even more irresistible that before"
"I looked for you everywhere. Mom and dad refused to tell me what had happened. I looked for you everywhere, asked your friends, finally somebody told me about what happened. I looked him up and lets say  he will never be able to abuse anybody else" Gabriel said
It was the middle of the night when Case woke up to the feeling he was peeing himself but soon realized his water had just broken, he woke Dean up.
“Well he is unmated, when he came back from the war, he was different. He had never recovered from the things he suffered over there. He doesn´t date, I have never seen him even remotely interested in anyone. I think that our announcement was bittersweet. Dean loves pups, he would have been a wonderful dad” Sam said
“Sure Dean, whatever you need” she said “I will walk you  both outside” she said dragging Sam and Jess with her “Leave him be today, He is a strong son of a bitch but from time to time, he cannot hold it any longer, those days I let him stay with him, he holds him all night long and that usually gives him strength to keep fighting” she said
“I am sorry darling, I thought that this would be a nice surprise but maybe I should have eased you into this instead of surprising you with a full blown heat… I wouldn´t have blamed you if you had moved on Dee” said Cass and that got Dean´s attention
He stood up, went to the kitchen, got a clean rag and got it wet, he brushed it all over his mating gland to remove the bloquers and got it wet again for Dean. He followed suit and in a second the room was inundated with their scents.
A month later Cass started to feel out of the weather. Tired but he considered it to be an aftermath of the sex marathon he and his mate had gone through... only thinking about it made him slick a little. He was at work so he needed to keep it cool. No dice cause the second Dean has crossed the door he has smelled it and his eyes had turned red.
Sam and Jess looked at him, Sam remembered that name… in had been written at the back of a picture Dean had send him during the war.
"Yeah, homeless shelters for omegas, under bridges... until my due date approached that I lived on an abandoned building near the hospital. The day my water broke I met Missoury and like an angel she saved me. Saved us" he finished
"Oh babe, I very much want that too. I am sorry I have been so out" Dean said "I just needed to digest the change
"They won't, even if they did, the job would still remain yours" said Dean "trust me?" He asked holding Castiel's hand
“I honestly thought that our mating night was all I was going to have with you… don´t get me wrong, I would have been by your side until my last breath, but lately I was beginning to lose hope to see you again, to talk to you again, to have you like this” Dean managed to say and suddenly Cass understood Dean´s tears.
They redid one of the guest bedrooms into the baby room, they painted it soft yellow and place a little crib and a rocking chair in the room, as well as a little bookcase with some books to read to the baby.
" Mr Novak I am sorry we meet like this but I do love your daughter very much..." Jack started to day but Castiel interrupted him
"Jack and I have been going out together for over two years. I knew you were going to get mad with the dating thing so I kept it on the down low" she said
"Well it is difficult not to like something so beautiful and well preserved" said Castiel and Dean smiled. Damm he was nice!
“I got a job as a beekeeper north from here in Tulcson and I need to get back” he said “I just wanted to stop by and give you both the congratulations” he said “Can I see him? I would really like to see him” he asked
“As always, usually by this time he is saying his goodbyes for the day, but he is having a bad day” she pointed toward the corridor “Last door on the right” They approached the room, the door was ajar and they peeked inside.
“I  …. When the doctors told me that the surgery had complications and that you were not waking up… I was heartbroken. I brought you back here, your brother Gabe is on his way. He paid for the best doctors and the best everything Cass. But nobody gave us any hope” said Dean
“Oh no, we have discussed this plenty, you did what you had to do and I understand why you said yes. Now, you are back here and that is all that matters” Cass said “How about John?” he suggested
What a day. Jack and Claire had became parents. Dean and Cass were now grandpas! Kali had called Gabriel to let her know that she had a lead for the PI.
“Well the Winchesters are my family in more ways than one” said Cass and Michael nodded in understanding
"Of course" Dean let them in and they  were let to a nice living room where Dean had been watching the  game. He turned the TV off. "Ok. what is this all about Jack?" he asked.
"I will never hurt your dad, never on purpose. You have my word" said Dean. Claire hugged and kissed her dad.
“What have you done!” he claimed enraged at the others who run away into the darkness of the basement.  The power of that feeling to save Sam was out of control, he was blinded by rage. Fucking monsters without soul!
“Dean?” Cass moved a little to look at Dean, his face was covered with tears and he was silently crying. “Oh babe, you are crying!, no no no please Dean please talk to me  babe, don´t cry” Cass kissed him and tried to dry his tears but more kept coming “Dean why are you crying babe”
“I am so tired all the time? I wish we could make love…” Cass whines and his scent changed a little sour. Dean caressed his face softly
"Well maybe you should think about what we might be doing wrong that we dont scream that loud...!" Jack said with an evil smile
So Dean´s loyalty and bright soul was not his only strong point. He also fiercely loved and protected his family. Michael had been on the verge of losing control to Dean in that basement but he had recovered on time to flee.  He knew that understanding Dean and what made him tick that strongly was key to remain in control, next time he would be ready for the surge of power. Or so he thought.
"Well that is bullshit you are a great student and I am sure there will be one Univerity that sees over all this Alpha/Omega  discrimination" said Dean and that made Castiel look at him in awe.
His scent of protective alpha filled the car and made Cass smile. He placed his hand over Dean´s leg while driving to give him strength and that calmed him down a little. Their little angels were sleeping soundly in their seats and the drive home from the hospital was peaceful. Once home, the mess started. Cries, naps, feedings, diapers, no sleep ... but they were happy and the first months passed very fast. Their babies were home and they were healthy and they had two! which had been quite a surprise but wow... they were a family of four and even after almost three months, he was still in awe.
"Cass would you consent that I touch you, get you naked and made love to you?" Dean asked and Cass realized that even at that moment Dean was concerned about his limits.
"What? No!" Said Claire. Another scream of pleasure could be clearly heard in the silent house. "Noooo nooo nooo that is my dad? Shit i dont want to hear this! Can't believe they are being so loud!" She said angrily
Dean was sitting in a chair by a bed. He was holding a man´s hand and was speaking softly to him while leaning into his touch “I love you so much sweetheart, I would like to see those electric blue eyes again, your gummy smile and hear your horrible sense of humor... I miss you babe, I miss you every minute of every day. I had a bad moment with Sammy today, he tried to set me up with an omega” Cass´s scent turned sour immediately, Dean smiled feeling that his mate was still there with him “Don´t worry baby, no Omega can hold a candle to you, I told him I didn´t need anybody and I ended up showing him my mating bite. I think I will bring him over soon, so he can meet you. Would you be ok with that?” Dean asked and kissed him softly on the lips “Good night Cass, I will be back first thing tomorrow” Dean stood and got out of the room to find his brother and girlfriend there.
They all agree silently, the front door opened and Benny entered the house in his uniform. " I hope you didn't eat all the food"
Claire birth had been long, but this was different in less that two hours they were pushing. And their daughter was born  healthy and quite big. Rossy cheecks and fluffy hair.
Dean calmed him with his scent but he had to hear his husband cry for hours in his arms until he was dry.
Dean looked at him in disbelief "What? You got my baby pregnant?" he said stepping towards Claire but Castiel stopped him
Dean arrived to the hospital like every day. He left some chocolates for the nurses at the front because they were nice. He went all the way to the end of the corridor and said Hi to the doctors and few regular he crossed with. Stopped in front of door 907 and tried to collect himself. Five years and still each day was as difficult as the first one. He entered the room and was welcomed with the scent of Castiel, the Omega was lying on the bed, asleep... well he was in a coma but he looked like he was sleeping. Dean had cut his scruffy beard yesterday and he looks pretty.
“I love you, the only thing key to my life and my happiness is you babe, I would like pups? Yes, but if we cannot have then, we will adopt. I want us to live a long life together, the rest can be figured it out” Dean hugged Cass for Dear life “I love you” he whispered and let his inner alpha purr with happiness, he had his mate back.
After several hours, castiel had enough control to text Sam to help them with Sammy.  Sex had turned to a one week sex marathon that had taken them by surprise as they were getting a little old for such endeavors. Once their rut and heat were over they were exhausted and in pain. It took the another two days to wake up from bed. Sam and Eileen had the time of their lives teasing them about the whole affair when they had returned a happy Sammy home.
“Hello Cass” said Dean happy to be there “I got to tell you all about my day. You see, yesterday Sammy came to the house, he brought a nice tall and blonde omega, they are true mates!!!” Dean checked everything around, that Cass had enough blankets, that his feet were slightly elevated to avoid clogs, he checked his meds in the chart and that all the machines were on and working. Then he sat on the chair. “I felt very happy for him, Jessica is a lovely Omega and she loves Sam very much” Dean sighted “I felt happy for them but when they left ... I felt sad. They will mate and they will have pups and ...” Dean´s scent was now sour with pain and he realized Cass´s heartbeat was faster, he was feeling his distress “I am sorry Cass, I didn´t want to stink the room” He stood and sprayed a scent neutralizer and tried to rein his inner alpha “I just miss you”.
"Yeah, the doctors told us that his chances were low" Castiel said a little sad " they even told us to say our goodbyes  just in case"
"No dad, I just worry about this. Not so long ago it was just the two of us, not we are mated, babies on the way? ... Dean if your him, my kid will not have a grandpa to play with because I would kill you! Capice?
The many doctors Dean had contacted with along these years had come and go, some gave him hope, some told him to move on ... but Cass was there, he could feel Dean´s presence, when Dean was excite or sad, Cass´s scent changed too, his heartbeat responded but nothing else ever happened. Dean talked to him but he didn´t really know if Cass, his Cass was really there, listening and understanding. Nonetheless, he continued to talk to him.
And in the end, Cass was worried for nothing, his inner Omega knew better that to weaken his body with a heat, at he was almost completely recovered four months later when he felt the fist symptoms of his heat approaching. He was ready for Dean now, oh he was more than ready!
Bringing the babies home was no joke. Dean had to go buy another carseat, install that in the Impala and manage to get two little fragile babies and his husband in the car. He drove home like a granny and he started to realize that this was life from now on, he had in the car alongside him the three most important humans in the world. And that he needed to protect them over everything else.
"I am going to have a baby, there is a baby Claire" said Jack. Claire knelled by him and placed her hand over his belly.
Pain ripped through him when he breached him. Somewhat he was aware that he was being raped but couldn't move anymore. The asshole fucked him without mercy until he finished and then ripped his knot out like an animal ripping Cass appart and afterwards kicked him several times. The pain was all over and....he felt like he would kill him just as he has threatened before.
Dean held Cass´s hand when they told Sam and Jess that they were expecting. Cass held Dean´s hand when they saw the baby for the first time and he was crying. Life was good, Dean had his mate back home with him, healthy and safe and all that hurt that he had gone through for five years was in the past. To love him and care for him was his mission in life, he had lost so much time…
"Honey, you need to remember that I am almost 60 as well, I don´t think i could take a knot anymore" Cass looked at Dean in they eye "Lets just enjoy sex, no rush, only us" said Castiel. "We still have many years ahead and I need my mate, I need to feel you, I need to be intimate with you, I need to know that you still enjoy us being together" He knew Dean had been a little depressed since he had lost his ability to pop a knot, it happened to all alphas with age. Once there the reproductive prime was way over, there was no need for knotting and biology has decided is was high time for them. Most couples have their reproductive prime around 18 to 30. They had 4 pups when they were over 40, that was already a sign that their fertility was way beyond normal parameters, the doctor had said that it might be due to them being true mates. Dead was almost 55 when he started noticing the changes but it had been  6 weeks ago when the doctor had confirmed his fears, his prime as way over. He was a middle age alpha now. Dean had been depressed and insecure about his masculinity. They didn´t have sex since.
Castiel was over the moon with the news and he knew he could take the babies to term, he knew it. He just needed Dean to breath and enjoy the pregnancy.
But still Dean would not  mount him, not even discussing penetration or knotting. He could smell Dean's scent when he masturbated in the shower once they were done....
Once at the door of the hotel, Dean kissed Castiel softly in the lips and whispered "Goodnight angel"
“Yes Dean, they are perfect” Said Cass “Where have you been hiding little Claire? We love you very much
"Because my dad never mated" she said and Dean looked at Castiel who seemed awfully concentrated on his own hands.
When Dean saw the man Jack had said claimed to be Michael he recognized the Archangel´s grace intermediately, in the end they had been one for a long time. “Michael…” said Dean “What do you want?”
When Michael entered the room he found Castiel hiding on a corner, with pleading eyes and terrified. Michel was about to ask about the woman and the baby when he realized he had been all wrong. Castiel was showing a big baby bump and Michael could feel the power of the unborn child soul… as bright as his father grace and Dean´s soul.
“Forgiven” said Dean “Meg, could I stay the night? I cannot go, I can´t …can´t leave him tonight…” Dean looked at Cass with tears in his eyes again and Meg understood that today was one of those days where she looks the other way.
When Meg came around for the morning round he found Dean asleep on his back, Cass Was in his arms, his nose pasted to Dean´s mate gland. She smiled a little sad, She couldn´t understand how the destiny could be so dam cruel to keep these two mates apart like this. “Dean Buddy, wakey wakey” she said and Dean opened his eyes.
Sam and Jess went to the hospital, floor 9 “Long-term care” area. They looked at each other. A nurse approach them “Who are you looking for?” she asked softly
"My leg feels trapped... I can't move it" he complained and Cass had a look at it. The leg was cought withing a bunch of metal and it was indeed trapped. Dean was bleeding profusely .
Less than 20 minutes later, Dean was wheeled on a bed into the room. He looked exhausted and in pain. Cass went to his side.
“Dead, three years ago, bar fight…” Dean Said. “No matter what I am not hiding any longer. We are civils now, you are back, and our relationship won´t be a secret any longer” he said proudly
“It will protect the baby from being summoned by demons and angels against dark magic too” said Michael “It is my apology for taking you for those months when you should have been with your family” he said
Arthur ketch was an ass, he had requested Castiel to be removed from debate class when he had presented Omega. Somehow his mere existence made Ketch angry, he and his asshole friends were always moking him and the other Omegas. But this year Ketch has a focus on him that creeped the hell out of Cass, every time he turned a corner here he was like a lion waiting for the chance to attack.
“I need you Sam,  he is awake, he is awake Sam!!” He said and Sam assured him he was on his way to the hospital. True to his word 15 minutes later he was melting with Dean on a hug.
Claire joined them with her face full of Teas. Dean with Sammy and Bobby in his arms joined them too.
Castiel invited Gabriel over with his wife for Dinner. It was great. After the flashback he had been thinking about the past in a different way. Somehow all that past pain was not vivid anymore, like was healing over the wound more and more as Dean's love made him stronger.
"That is exactly the underlying theme of the books, Angels are warriors without a leader. They had gotten sick with the same sins as humankind" The writes explained
"So what do you do for a living Dean, when you are not tasked with babysitting a weird writer?" asked Castiel who was not sitting in the couch by the fireplace
Jack and Claire with Bobby  and Charlie were coming from Canadà where Jack had opened his dream bookstore and where Claire was chief of surgery at the biggest hospital in Vancouver.
Bobby was a peaceful kid. Claire has immediately gone back to school and Jack had reduced his hours for the next weeks to recover and look for a nanny.  This was their parents gift, they would pay for either a nanny or daycare so they could both graduate. It was great to have help at home too. Although Cass was getting bigger, four adults made things easier.
Jack and Claire has gone for their first  sonogram and the got to see their little baby, hear their heartbeat. They had come come happily hugging their picture and discussing names.
"Oh my god, you two are in so much trouble..." said Castiel "You two are jumping on my car right now, we are taking Jack home and You both are going to face the music" he said
Castiel saw Dean cry when he reached that part of the novel and felt warm love for the mechanic who so freely enjoyed his book. Dean went back to the book after lunch.
"Now mate, I am going to make love to you all night long" said Dean making castiel slick with anticipation.
"Oh they are listing the needed parts right now if you want to come over to the back?" Gabriel followed the man and there it was Dean Winchester with another man, almost as tall and well built as him.
"You are my alpha, i love you. These changes are normal. I am with you 100%" Castiel said kissing his husband nose and making him smile. "Now, do you think you want to unwrap your present" he said turning around to make Dean see his lovely figure with the amazing lingerie.
"Dean.."started Castiel "not that I am not happy that you are taking it all so well, I was afraid you would turn violent and hurt my kid... so I am glad you are not the typical Alpha knothead but I can't just leave the independence that it was so hard for me to obtain and come live with an Alpha" said Castiel
"If I was twenty i would be mounting and knotting you right now" said Dean "But as I am 60 and my dick is not what it used to be... i wish I could knot you babe" said Dean sadly
“I couldn´t let you go, when I was sad or desperate you could sense my trouble and your scent would change either to comfort me or to share the distress… I knew you were still there, I had faith in us” said Dean proudly.
"Yes!" Jack kissed her "I love you Claire and we are going to be parents and this baby need a family, with a mom and a papa"
“No, I wanted to move everything into a storage but Dean insisted that you guys were mated therefore his house was now also your house so he moved everything there.” Said Gabe
“It doesn´t matter, the doc said you are alright and that with patience, food, physical therapy an love you will get back to normal” Said Dean and realized that Cass was looking at Sam.
“Please Michael, please do not do this… my child is innocent” he begged his hands protectively around his belly.
"Love you mate, love you and Claire and this little bug here" Dean placed his hand over his mate's belly "I will protect you all from now on"
"I washed myself and walked home" Cass said "I told mom everything and she lost it. She locked me in my bedroom for weeks, not that I could or wanted to go anywhere. Then  once my face was back to normal she let me out like nothing has happened, she expected me to go back to school. I had a panick attack and I was taken to the hospital where it was discovered that I was pregnant. She went home and let me there like she didn't kne who I was" Cass said "i meant nothing to her"
“There is another baby, there is another baby, you need to push with the next contraction Castiel” said the doctor trying to make him understand
"My duty here as writer is over, so I was wondering if you could be interested in maybe going out for diner with me?" Castiel looked at Dean quite insecure "as... as a date" he finally said
Jared took the ex-angel under his wing, gave him a home and food and company. Two months later, another Angel had come to their door. I was the archangel Gabriel. Telling them that Jensen, who had always deserved to be in heaven he had been punished by the angels and casted down to hell. Misha had cried in despair. But Gabriel was coming to their help.
"My alpha is always touching me from afar, like I am breakable, undesirable, like I am an useless omega... when he is finished with me he goes masturbate to the bathroom!" Concluded Castiel " am i disgusting to you? Is that it? Too fat that I dont fit in those panties you love so much?" Said Castiel and a stupid hormonal tear rolled down his cheek
"I inherited a car from my dad, he was a horrible father full of prejudices towards Omegas... I didn't speak with him the last 15 years of his life. It was surprising he left me his Car, old golden oldsmobile.  I never payed attention to it but I think I would like to repair it and sell it" Gabriel said
“Cass… hello love” said Dean softly he was weak and his eyes were blurry but he extended a hand towards his angel “Is this true? Are we having a baby?” while trying to stand up but failing due to exhaustion. Cass rushed towards him with his big belly and held him in his arms.
" You are right, I am so happy for them. Too young and way unexpectedly but when you see them together..." cass was now back to himself
“A little taller than in the pictures, longer hippie hair but I am quite sure you are Sam” Cass said.
“We mated the night before we were discharged, finally we could stop hiding and I was coming back home with my husband and I was going to confront dad and come out…” Dean said “Then the next morning we were called to discharge early and we were going to celebrate with a date but before that Cass wanted to visit his brother Gabriel, he worked at the embassy and he wanted to say hi before flying back home. The armed militia attacked the consulate, the bomb killed 102 people, injured severely another 100 or so… I was called to emergency evacuation of the other government offices, I wasn´t allowed to check on him for hours, I was recalled to help evacuate those in danger and when I finally arrived to the consulate…they told me” Dean felt tears rushing down his face and Cass`s scent was reacting to his sadness “It is alright Cass, I am sorry I was not there with you darling” he said sitting again and holding his hand lovingly.
"You are bleeding way too much Dean" said Castiel moving closer and using his flannel to  try stop the bleeding "stay with me"
They went to bed together. Both naked except for their boxers they laid in bed in each other´s arms. Joyfully kissing and scenting each other. Dean licked over the mating mark and Cass closed his eyes enjoying the attention. He was home in Dean´s arms and they had built a big family together. Maybe with more babies to come ... who knew.
“Well let´s see, what do we read yesterday?” Dean got Bag of Bones by Stephen King and searcher for the dog-eared page. “I see, we finished a very interesting chapter yesterday, I am thrilled to know what happens next ....” And Dean resumed reading to Castiel like every day for the last five years, come rain or shine, he stays there as many hours as possible waiting for Cass to wake up, to open his eyes, to say something. But for five years, nothing.
“Are you kidding?” Dean looked at him “I don´t want to ever spend a night without you, I don´t want to spend a heat apart from you. I have dreamed for 5 years of this moment. I love you and I don´t want my knot to set you free…” Dean kissed him and he started moving slowly getting his knot to tug on his rim and chasing a second orgasm while kissing and licking at Cass´s pulse point.
Suddenly his eyes felt watery and he had a little memory flash from Dean´s mind. Mary singing to little Dean a soft song while holding him in her arms making him feel loved and safe. He remembered the fire and John Winchester telling him that his mommy was not coming back ever again. He felt Dean´s pain while feeling alone and afraid at night, feeling overwhelmed when little Sammy cried in his crib. He remembered that Dean used to crawl into the crib with Sammy and sing to him that same song his mommy sang to him. The rage took over and Michael screamed “Fucking Monsters!”  His grace incinerating them all in the building. Sam and Mary covered their eyes and when they opened them, the monsters were dead and Michael was gone taking Dean with him.
“I love you alpha, I love you so much” Cass slipped some tears and Dean rushed to comfort him. He jumped into the bed and held his mate until they were both sound asleep. That is how Gabriel found them an hour later, letting them have some rest together he moved outside, there waiting there was a tall handsome man whose face looked familiar.
“Dean… what is going on?” he asked and Dean was crying silently by his side. He softly move close and kissed his lips. Cass smiled  and Dean cried harder.
“Well that was weird, very weird” Dean told Cass “They might want to ask me to be the best man” said Dean. “I wish you could come with me Cass, you would look great on a tux! And talking about that, I need to either go shopping for one or rent it... what do you think? Renting a tux for your brother´s wedding isn´t it a little cheap?” Dean asked Cass
"Dean wake up," he called, he checked his breathing and his pulse. He was still alive. "Dean please open your eyes?" He begged and got a pained groan as an answer . "Hey Dean... look at me?" Dean did  try to focus on Castiel.
"Now why don´t you let Claire back into the crib now that she is asleep and we go to bed" suggested Castiel.
"When you guys were born, Benny was the last one and he was so tiny and fragile. When they took him out they took him away, he was not crying or moving or breathing.... we were very worried." Said Dean placing a had over his mate's shoulder
"Now. There is going to be a lot of yelling but once we are mated, there is nothing they can do to keep us apart" she said
Sex was careful and soft because wanted to dote on his mate and make him feel loved not just desired, he love to hold Cass during their post-coital haze so he could feel his body melting in his arms. Feeling safe and content. Their scents mingling.
Finally, we should be thankful for each other. The friendships that we have made here will last a lifetime. In the same way we have supported each other and helped each other succeed in these years at Peterson, I hope we will continue to provide support and encouragement for each other in future endeavors. Here I found my mate, Claire. There isn't a more wonderful Alpha over the face of the earth, I am grateful for having her by my side.
"Marcus arrived third and was smaller 1.5 kilograms. He cried loud but he was tiny. He went straight into the NICU crib and the nurses attached cables to follow his vitals.
"Hello my name is Kali and I am your nurse. You need to leave the young family be, the need to rest bringing a baby into the world is not an easy affair"
"I was a virgin when I was raped, I never let anybody else ever touch my like that again... I am broken... I dont know if I could ever enjoy sex" Cass was trembling after that powerful confession.  Dean melted with love. Hugged him tight.
"Hello" Dean said looking at the pretty dark-haired omega at his door and he saw Jack behind "Jack is everything alright?"
Early that day the tow truck had dragged an old oldsmobile to the restoration Bay. Cass saw it coming and suddendly he felt like crying. The distress dragged his mate attention.
Michael fell down onto his knees, he felt Dean´s surprise, his need to protect his husband and his baby was like nothing he had ever felt before. Husband? Michael didn´t know that the angel and his host had such a deep connection. Dean let his memories rush into Michael´s mind. Meeting Castiel after rescuing him from hell, all the times they had shared together, how Cass had chosen him over heaven and his siblings time after time. Their first kiss, their first night together, the first night Dean had bottomed for Castiel was an incredibly powerful memory that had let Michael without breath. Then he saw what Dean wanted for the future, a better world, rising his baby with Castiel and his family. Holding his baby in his arms…. He wanted Castiel to feel safe and stop crying… and Michael couldn´t hold Dean Winchester down no more. Dean revoked his consent loud and clear and pushed Michael out. And suddenly a blast of light and energy left Dean´s body and dissolved into thin air.
"If has been five months since you crossed that door and I have been slowly falling in love with you" said Dean making Cass blush
"No! Next week! Of course now you dummy, my water broke" he said looking as his alpha run around the bedroom excitedly
“Sure” said Sam, they moved towards the room and when they opened the door they found Dean and Cass entangled together in the little hospital bed making out like teens.
"Well for one it means that this was meant to happen, that their school wont be able to expell them... it also means that they should not spend time appart, even less with the pregnancy because it can lead to rejection sickness" Dean said
"Oh I want my present alright, you look heavenly" Dean kissed Cass passionately and they fell to bed together.  Twenty minutes later, Castiel was riding Dean, his moans were loud because they were alone and he could enjoy himself as he wanted. Dean loved to see his mate like this, all sexy and free. His life companion still desired him, despite their bodies growing old and his hair starting to turn silver at places. Dean realized that their intimacy was bound to change with time, but it didn´t have to disappear, knotting and even mounting was not all they enjoyed about sex together. He focused on pleasuring his mate and make him cum all over his chest.  Before Dean could cum inside his mate, Cass changed position surprising him and laid down between his legs to take his cock into his mouth and looked at his with a cocky smirk.
"Like I know his thoughts and feelings, like I can feel the baby growing inside of him...?" Claire volunteered
"Trust me , the pleasure is all mine. I was looking forward to meet the man behind the book" Dean said taking Castiel´s luggage and pointing towards the car "this is us" Dean said and put the luggage in the trunk before opening the door for the author
“Did you think about names for the baby?” asked Dean once wondering if in his absence Cass had name their son.
“Only five minutes more, please... I am not done today” begged Dean. Those were the worse days, the days when he felt he couldn´t leave, that he was failing Cass for leaving him alone there ...
"Yes, i did and my mom had changed the lock, my things were on the trash at the back. I packed the basics and left"
"The moment I opened the fist page I was gone, I ready it on a stride and when I finished i felt...." Castiel and Dean looked at each other "i felt broken, so I re-read it that same day"
He had one more lesson to learn and that came with a big surprise. There had been some talk about the Winchester´s having a big secret, a powerful being was coming into this world said the angels. He was quite sure another Nephilim was coming to be, the Winchesters had something to do with it…, and he was decided to prevent it. That meant breaking into the bunker and seeing Dean´s family and friends but he was ready to control Dean through it. He entered the bunker through the main door, and let both Mary and Bobby unconscious with a wave of his hand.  The young woman Charlie awoke some intense feelings in Dean but Michael held him down and rendered her unconscious too. Jack and Sam had entered the war room to face him.
"The fire will be lit for tomorrow, it gets quite cold around here in winter and we like our customers to feel welcomed. Like at home" said Dean "This was my mom´s book store, I used to work here alongside her when I was a teen" Castiel must have noted the sadness in his words
“Am I at the hospital?... there was a bomb….” Cass said his voice sounded dry “Can I get some water”
"It is alright babe" said Dean "but if you ever want to tell me or talk to them, let me know I will be by your side" Dean kissed him
"If you were younger I would be thinking that maybe you are pregnant but you have no synchronization as mates anymore right?" Asked the doctor
Food was ready, they all sat around the house snacks everywhere, Dean offered wine and beverages around.  The local news showed that a huge building was on fire on main street.
“The doctor said my body is reactivating nicely … I wanted to run by you the possibility that my heat may come quite soon too” Cass looked at Dean in the eye while talking to him “I don´t want to take suppressants but I don´t think I am healthy enough to carry a pregnancy to term…” Cass confessed a little disappointed.
"Dr Bradburyzthis is Cass Winchester, I am fine, we are all  fine. Can you tell my husband that having sex will not hurt me or the BAbies!" Asked Castiel
"Dad ... this is Claire Novak, my girlfriend" he said holding her hand again so his nerves were under control.
"Omega instincts, Cass has been helping me get more in touch with my omega side, is nice"Jack said carresing his baby bump.
"Touch me Cass" Dean asked and Castiel's inner aomega took over. He got naked and approached Dean. Their bodies fit perfectly, their smells mingled.
He woke up in the middle of the night, hot and sweaty. He went downstairs to get a glass of water and take an ibuprofen. Two hours later he was still feeling bad, he was overheated and starting to cramp. This fel awfully like the starts of a...heat! Oh god he was going into heat? A gush if slick made it out of his hole and not a minute later Dean entered the room. He eyes were alpha red his nostrils were taking in the smell.
"It belonged to my dad, I learned how to drive in there and when I got my license the first thing I did was to fulfill a promise. I drove my little brother to lake Melton" he said and saw how the other man had tensed and turned to look at the with wide eyes. Older, stronger and very pregnant, after 18 years his little brother Castiel was finally in front of him.
The second time he was surprised was by another feeling, this was an unexpected one. Sam and Mary had interfered into one of his plans and had been captures by his people, He got called by one of his soldiers and once he got to the basement where they were being kept he realized his loyal monster soldiers had beaten them both badly, probably tortured them and they were seriously injured.
Cass was on the stretcher all prepped and sedated from waist down. Dr. Bradbury told them that she was going to get the first one. A tiny crying pup was extracted from Cass's belly.
"Dean got carried away and bit me and that triggered the event that lasted over a week but after so many years I am not fertile any longer right?" Asked Cass
“Yeah, the second worst thing that had happened to me that day, the first was seeing my little brother being rushed into the ER with a piece of metal in his skull. He died in the ambulance and they got him back, the doctors said he flatted twice on the OR table. It was a miracle he survived the surgery but … then he never came back to us” Gabriel was quite shaken by the news.
"Well we hadn't for almost two years but, almost three months ago we had a synchronized heat and rut" Cass said making his doctor pay attention
“Cass??!” he called him but in an instant he was following the alluring smell towards their room “Cass?” He opened the door and oh God! Castiel was naked in bed he was touching himself, his dick hard in his hand, his fingers opening his wet hole. “Oh babe” Dean felt his knees weaken but he moved towards the bed, removed Cass´s hand from his hole and licked him open with enthusiasm while hearing Cass scream with pleasure.
"Yeah, we are finally alright. I am sorry, I didn´t mean to worry you is only that I was thinking where I was a little over a year ago... and it hit me that I finally have all I ever wanted" Cass looked at him with love
Sammy and her mate Sarah, who was now pregnant with their 3rd baby were driving from Minessota from their new home, Sammy was the first tenured omega at the Molecular chemistry department in their University.  Sarah was an artist.
"But the, he grew up and grew up... like his body was tired of being the smallest of you 4 and look at him now. A firefighter " said Dean proud
"He is beautiful guys" Dean said "Hey Bobby  we are your grandpas and we love you very much!" Castiel melted at his mate. They hugged their kids and call Sam and Eileen. Later the nurse interrupted their family meeting.
"Uncle Sam, come meet Samantha Winchester-Novak"  Dean said placing the newborn on the arms of his gigantic little brother
“Sam? Sam Winchester?” he asked, the man looked surprised “Sorry, I am Gabriel Novak, we never met in person, I am Castiel´s brother, Dean showed me pictures of you” He tended his hand towards Sam. Sam shake his hand and pointed out towards the wheelchair.
Jack couldn´t say if it was the mating or the baby that him buzzing on the inside. They were heading to Claire´s home to break the news to her dad and later they would try his home. He should be afraid but Claire was holding his hand, his other hand over his flat belly he felt over the moon. The arrived home, nobody was there, they sat on the couch and barely ten minutes later Castiel Novak, Claire´s dad entered the house from his late shift at the coffee shop.
When the due date approached they were very excited, Cass was huge and looking forward to the baby to be born, they didn´t want to know the sex so that would be a nice surprise.
" yeah... it is only that... is this how it is supposed to be? Jack is happy, healthy, loved... the look forward to their pup"  his eyes blurred  with unshed tears for a moment, Dean held his arm because he suspected this was about the past " All I remember was fear..."
"Oh.. you do know to to treat a man" said Castiel...Dean looked at him, was Castiel flirting with him?
"No, I can write from anywhere so I was hoping that a super sexy mechanic would let me write from his family bookstore while I take a little me time in town..." Castiel said
"Oh Dean, I am loosing my mind" moaned Castiel who turned around and kissed Dean with all he had. They had slowly stripped and laid on Dean's bed. With a swift move Dean had mounted him and he was so wet for him. Dean fucked him while keeping eye contact, his green amazing eyes locked on him making him feel so many things. Like that he felt Dean's knot inflating, his rithm falting, his knot catching and felt Dean's  teeth sinking on his mating gland. Castiel cummed so hard and explosively  that he screamed.
Jack was over the moon with the announcement because not only he was going to have a brother or sister, he also knew that mean his baby will had and uncle or aunt to play with. He was not alone in the journey. Jack hugged Cass with happiness and Dean melted when watching his kid happy for them. Claire remained silent.
Sam drove them home and told Dean about the extensive damage of the Impala, about the drunk man that was driving the red car that jumped the red light rushing through the intersection, he had died on spot cause he had no seatbelt on... soon the arrived home and each one taken to their room to rest.
Life was easy at the Winchester household. The house was nice and spacious and warm. Fridge always full, Dean turned out to be the less stereotypical Alpha ever. Not only he was soft and caring with Jack, Castiel liked the way he treated Claire. He was the most amazing cook and love to feel them all, he didn't  make himself scarce during cleaning. Castiel helped with everything as much as possible except food, he loved Dean's cooking!
“How can there be another baby…. In the sonogram there was only one…” Cass argued but soon a contraction made him clunk his teeth and push. “Fuuuck”
When the kids came back home, they were fused together on the sofa. They smiled at them and Dean kissed Cass who blushed.
Dean held Cass's  hand and looked at his husband with fear but his omega had only eyes for the 4 little blurry embryos whose hearts were beating fast.
Castiel was happy to on a tour for his book. Dean was taking over his brother book shop while he was on his honeymoon with Jess, he was in charge during two weeks and he needed to organize everything for a writer presenting his book.
“Yeah, nobody knows but he feels how I am and his scent changes… he is still in there fighting his way back to the surface, he is fighting back to get home, to me… I know it” Dean said “That is why I am here all the time, I want to be by his side when he wakes up…”
"John is here" announced the doctor "John is 2 kilograms and he is healthy. They placed the babies for a second on the Omega's chest and them placed them on a NICU crib by the bed.
Jensen was a good man living in a small town that had found Misha, that was the angel´s name, walking under the heavy rain by the road. He had stopped to help him. offer him a safe place to stay.
Castiel showed Dean the manuscript of his second novel. And Dean sat down to read. Castiel watched him closely.
"I am a mechanic, I had always been good with cars, so that is what I do. And Castiel, babysitting you is no task at all, I loved your book" said Dean getting closer to the fireplace and lighting the fire
Sam and Jess were confused and felt horrible for what had happened at the cafe.  Sam was sure Dean had shown him a mating bite, he was mated, it was healed and old but Dean had never said anything about a mate... was his mate dead?  He called Dean´s only fiend, Benny Láfite and finally Benny had agreed to tell him something.
Two days later, there was a knock on the bunker´s door. The cameras showed an unknown man. They all got armed and met the man outside the bunker.
"Oh Cass..." said Dean approaching him. He caressed his shoulders and his torso all the way to his ass. "Perfect"
“Silly alpha! I love you so fucking much that I don´t know how to make you understand” Cass said and Dean melted in his arms.
"I already have the second book, it is almost finished, maybe you would like to have a look at it" said Castiel
"Listen Cass I am not sure we will be able to just have sex but we are true mates and I am sure we can start to be intimate together and show you that you can be safe with me, work through the triggers and make love to each other with or without penetration" said Dean
When Dean arrived home the sweetest most wonderful smell in the world hit him like a train. In an instant his Alpha was growling and he was hard… that could only mean Cass was in heat.
John and   Marcus were both driving from University, Stanford had given them a full ride to law school ..
“Only five Dean, you need to rest” she said really concerned. Dean smiled but only on the outside and looked back at Cass “You need to wake up Cass, you need to, please please Cass, I will see you awake in the morning alright?” Cass´s scent changed, he smelled like Happy Omega and Dean held his hand reassuringly. After 5 minutes, Cass was still in a coma and Dean left for the Day. As soon as he left the hospital he allowed himself to feel sad. He knew his scent was not disturbing Cass anymore, he allowed himself to suffer and cry, to get angry and outraged when he was outside that room. By the time he arrived home he was exhausted and empty. He ordered some food and went to bed.
“It does sound good… maybe we can think about it a little bit more, see if we find some others we like more…” said Dean touching his husband´s round belly with adoration.
"Let's check to make sure" said the doctor and asked Castiel to lay down on his stretcher for an sonogram. Cass knew something was wrong when he saw the doctor go pale. He felt afraid, he wanted Dean there.
It had been late morning when Jack felt his waters break. Claire was there in a second having sensed that something was changing with the baby. They called a taxi to get to the hospital and called the Garage, Castiel answered the phone and they rushed to the hospital to meet them. Four hous later, baby Robert was born. When Dean and Cass were allowed into the room with the new family. Jack had cried showing Castiel his baby and mumbling something about being worth it like he had said. Dean squeezed his mate shoulder while peeking over to see chubby Bobby softly asleep.
When Sammy was conceived I felt it that it was different.  Now it is  even  a more powerful feeling, I am united to you  by a very deep and powerful connection, a profound bond that gives me strength. I know with every cell in my body that we 5 are going to be fine. I just need an alpha that supports my stubbornness and give me 4 times more care because this belly is inflating at a crazy rate. Are you with me?" He asked
The first think Jack got once he came down from the stage was an emotional bear hug from Castiel. "I love you Jack"
"Live here and work for you ... this is not a good idea Dean... what if the kids break up?" Asked Cass
"I read the instructions Dean and basically you pee and wait, not much you can mess!"Cass sound annoyed
He got the book from a huge pile at his brother's shop, the title "The angel of thrusday" well ... people were excited about the reading and signing so... how bad can the book be?
Six hours later, Cass was pushing hard to deliver baby Jack, who cried loudly when coming into this world. Crying a little less loud Dean held his baby boy and place him on Cass´s arms but just for a second when the pain made Cass cry out. Dean scared took Jack into his arms while scared look at the doctor fuss.
“I mean knowing that I am pregnant somehow I feel special” Dean´s hands came to his belly protectively “You are a miracle Cass and this baby is going to be so loved!” Dean kissed his bellybutton and made Cass laugh
Fellow graduates, I want you to know what a great gift it is to be as prepared as we are, to face the change that is coming. But change is scary.
Personally, I am inspired by  my papa. Many of you know that I lost my omega mom when I was little and that my alpha dad raised me by himself. Until he met my papa Cass and I did not only win another parent, I won the best example of a strong omega. He faced challenges, he is a fighter and he had not let change scare him.  Often on graduation day we look outside for heroes but I see them right here among us. I have seen during this years that we don't have to look far for inspiration .
Once they got home, Cass showed him how everything was arranged now but quickly told him that this was his home and he could change everything if that made him feel more comfortable. Cass kissed Dean and told him that everything was just perfect as it was.  Dean took well care of him as Cass realized he had been doing all that time at the hospital. Meg had told him most of it, Dean staying with him every day for hours and hours, changing him, bathing him, making sure he was warm and comfortable, that everybody treated him right…. Because well for one, Cass was a freaking war hero and second, he was his mate and the love of his life.
"Well, I was going to drop you at your hotel to give you some time to rest, take a relaxing shower or anything you need, the hotel in a block away from the store. I was thinking you might come down to the store once you are ready, see the place, check the stand and then i can take you to have diner, show you the town, what do you think? asked Dean
"Do you feel ok?" Asked Dean. Castiel rolled his eyes "for the 100th time, I feel fine" he was pissed
"You should both move here then" said Dean. "Listen Castiel, they need to ge together, they are going to try raise a baby by themselves while finishing their studies, they will need our help. The house is big enough for all of us"
“Hi Dean!, wow you are way more handsome that Jess had told me!” Lisa beamed and suddenly Dean realized what was happening here.
We need be thankful for our families. These past few years have presented us with a lot of ups and downs and it is good to know that we had our families in our corner, supporting us along the way. Thanks Dad and Papa. I would not be here today without you. And being Omega still poses more challenges but they always trusted me, supported me and that gives me the fuel to keep driving forward.
“That is between Dean and me, can you call him so we can talk? ” he said. Sam asked Jack to go get Dean.
The book was about a fallen angel, the angel of thrusday. He had made a mistake and he has disappointed his brother and sisters in heaven so he was destined to earth where is is a little lost until he had met Jensen.
Sammy's first day at preschool had her alpha dad very emotional. Castiel being the Omega and the one that people assume to be the soft one found his Alpha's behavior quite endearing.
When he finished reading he gave Cass his bath and combed his unruly bedhair, changed his pajamas and softly tucked him back in his now clean and welcoming bed. Nurses did their part most of the time, but Dean liked to do this for Cass. All he could do was to keep him comfortable. After a little break for lunch Dean went back to the hospital room and sat there a little more, sometimes he watched tv with Cass commenting on everything that was happening on that Doctor Sexy M.D that Cass liked so much. When time came to return home he softly whispered his goodbyes to Cass with promises that he will be back tomorrow. And Dean drags himself back home to his empty house, empty bed and empty life.
They got into the car and drove. Dean felt dizzy inside having Cass so close. He had been crushing hard on the Omega but he knew it was the forbidden fruit.
"Oh Cass.... you want me to cum in your mouth?" he asked and his loved answered licking his glans... "shiiiit" screamed Dean. Carefully Dean stated fucking his mouth. Castiel moaned around his cock and when he came to took it all.
"There was never an Alpha...I was raped at school. My parents threw me on the streets. They thought that being a male omega that I was an abomination that tempted the alpha with my scent ... suddendly I was alone and on the streets. It is a miracle Claire was born healthy. Missouri Moseley  who was a nurse took us in when Claire and I had to leave the hospital. She was a wonderful woman that took care of us until I could take care of myself and raised my baby. She passed over five years ago" Castiel told Dean "I work two jobs, the ones nobody else wants, I live in a shithole neighborhood because it is the only thing we could afford... all I ever wanted is to raise my kid to live better and be happy" he finished.
“I didn´t want to think about this things without you Dean” Cass said turning in bed to face his husband and smiled softly “But now that you are back … should we discuss it?” he said and kissed his husband´s frowned face.
"It should´t be like that, but Pregnant Omegas without a mate are being exposed to all kinds of horrible behaviors, they are disrespected, they get the lower jobs... you will never get into University Jack... it was your dream..." Dean said sadly
“Oh. Alright” said Michael a little deflated. He felt a pang of rejection and turned around leaving towards his car.
Dean wanted to see how it ended, it was important, he was so invested in them getting together but they both seemed quite oblivious of the other affections...it was a little unnerving. Dean reached the final chapter, where Jensen suffered a fatal accident and Misha tries to use his angelic powers to save him. The angels angry for his intervention punish him and take his angelic grace, leaving him human, cold and scared. And that is it. The end.
The power of the orgasm woke him up. He was soaked in sweat and slick. It had been all a dream. Two months living with Dean and he was already lusting over him ... well it was more than lusting, he had a serious crush.
" You have been lucky, it was a big crash and you have a little concussion and some clean cuts" said the doctor
"Eh ... I don´t have a mom. She... she died when I was three. My dad raised me by himself. He thinks i am at a Omega study group" Jack confessed.
“They thought that you would be happy if they tortured us…” said Sam looking at Michael not knowing what to think about his behaviour “Let me hold her please” Sam said showing his tied arms and legs. He looked over Mary´s body lying on the cold floor and somehow it felt wrong so he set Sam free with his grace and saw the hunter moved towards his mom and held her lovingly into his arms, something softened inside him. Michael stayed close and felt a pang of jealousy when Mary Winchester opened her eyes and hugged her son Sam back “I love you mom” “I love you to Sam”
" I am so sorry Cass, can't imagine what you felt while pregnant and alone" dean was holding Cass both arms and turning the Omega attention towards him " But you are very strong Cass, you survived, raised Claire to be a happy, respectful Alpha all by yourself... you did amazing" Cass was looking at him now a blushing a little "Together we will make sure that they have all the chances to finish their studies, raise that baby to be a happy pup that can feel safe no matter what" Dean concluded
That night while Cass was rightfully resting, Dean was seated by the crib where Jack and Claire were sleeping. They were so perfect, both had black hair like Cass and their skin was very pale. He inhaled their scents. Finally he was whole again.
They both left the store and walked side by side to the Roadhouse diner where Dean had said he could find  the best burgers in the whole world. Castiel love burgers so there they went, ordered burgers and stayed until the owner kicked them out. They were so happy together, they fit perfectly. Castiel slipped his hand on Dean´s while walking back to the hotel. And Dean felt like his heart was skipping beats.
"Well I have to go to the garage for a while, I have that important client I told you about coming today Mr. Klein and he apparently will be taking a business partner along, I dont remember the name" said dean kissing cass whose morning sickness was at its finest and was taking some time off
"Castiel please lay down and I will tell you both everything" the doctor said. A little bit fumbling with the machine. Some gel and the machine belt over Cass lower belly and the doctor showed them the screen.
They spent all night making love, and when the sun was coming out, Cass´s head was gone and they both knew that it meant they had conceived.
"Our blokers are wearing out" Cass said worried and he realised that probably the adrenaline from the accident had erased them from their system and he could now smell Dean too. And ohhh Dean smelled like fresh coffee, like the first rain of the fall and the freshness of a little spring in the woods. Heavenly.
Gabriel cried and hugged him tight. He asked a million and one questions. Told Cass all abou the PIs, the search and how he had never forgotten. Cass was very emotional and Dean decided that they needed to call it a day. His very pregnant mate needed physical and emotional rest.
"Whoa whoa, I am not letting my baby daughter here alone... she is coming home with me" said Castiel
"She is right, we should let them rest" said Castiel letting Claire hold the baby "love you Claire, I am very proud of you"
"Trust me, I am the one that knows how important that really is. I am not letting a kid on mine to go through the shit my dad and I are going through all the time" he said
They kissed and kissed their scents mixing. The scent marked each other wich was a fairly serious and intimate thing. They talked for hours about their past experiences, the rape, the death of Dean's wife, raising kids by themselves  with full honesty. Cass felt like just having Dean like this was worth the risk and fear or facing his demons.
“Oh come on Sam, he needs a date for the weeding and maybe something else would spark, I think I know exactly the right Omega for him” Jess beamed with excitement and Sam thought Why not, he would really like to see his brother happy.
“I am ready Dean , please babe please I need you Alpha” Cass begged and Dean couldn´t remember how wonderful this was… they had only had penetrative sex their mating night and that was almost 5 years and a half ago… he opened his trousers and let his hard monstrous alpha dick out and using Cass´s own juices he coated himself and got in.
“Dean, you can come in now” Meg said smiling. Inside Cass was almost sitting on the bed, Meg had changed his pajamas and combed his hair…
"You have a male Omega as mate? And he works here?" Gabriel asked "My little brother is an Omega... if only he had found an Alpha like you ..."
He was so fucked, he was in love with  Cass... more than that could they be true mates? Dean's stood from the bed and rushed back to his room where he felt the longing in his heart for his mate on the other room. Shit
"He bet that you two would get together before the weekend" Claire specified. A click made them pay attention to Jack again who had obviously taken a picture of the and was texting Sam with proof.
“Shut up Sam, you can´t stop me!” said Michael and he pushed both Jack and Sam into the wall and let them fall unconscious on the floor. He entered the room they had been eagerly protecting. He could feel that Castiel was there. He was the last line of de defense for that woman. Feeling Castiel´s damaged grace made Dean stir.
“I don´t feel ok” another male voice said and both Dean and Meg bolted to look at Cass who was now looking at them both with his blue eyes and a confused look.
"Dont worry your mate is fine. He lost some blood they took him to have x-rays of that leg in case something was broken, we will keep you updated" he said. Cass didn't correct them because he knew that if he said the truth they would let him see Dean.
"Because it seems you understand them, you understand what i wanted to write..." Castiel sipped at his cocoa "I like it here"
"My dad is going to kill me, your dad is going to kill me" said Claire passing her hands over her hair and looking at Jack. Jack now was looking at his stomach
The hormones took care of any inhibitions Castiel had so that during the two days the had the house to themselves he had made Dean fuck him against the kitchen counter, he rode him on the sofa no need to be quiet or to remain in the bedroom. He roamed the house naked it was nice. Once the kids were back home with Bobby all sexy times were contrained to their bedroom... well or Dean's office at work where they was fooled around several times.
Two weeks later, after intense physical therapy and a lot of care from his mate Castiel was allowed to go home with Dean, he will continue to attend to daily sessions of physical therapy and weekly doctor check-ups until they were sure things were alright. Dean was so happy, his scent smelled like recently baked pie, fresh cut grass and home. Cass wanted to go home to Dean so badly, he just wanted to start his life with his mate. He had lost 5 years of his life! How unfair!
“Everything is going to be alright, push baby push” Dean encourage him and held his hand while holding jack until baby Claire was born, her cries were soft” The twin girl was smaller but healthy and bundled on a blanket was place on Cass´s arms.
"Well I am not excited about all this happening behind my back, I am sure Castiel thinks the same..." said Dean "but despite the lying, and the surprise pregnancy and the mating ..." Dean took a breath " I need to admit you two are cute together"
"One thousand percent omega, I will take care of everything, just concentrate all your energy to remain healthy.  I love you" Dean kissed his mate.
"Sorry to hear that, our society is fucked somwerimes" said Dean sensing a sad story behind Gabriel's words.
"Your papa refused to say goodbye, he said that it was like not trusting him with the fight, He never gave up on him. We were there with you guys all the time we could,  holding you, changing your diapers,  as is everything was normal. Skin with skin contact from you papa helped you all grow and leave the hospital... with Benny it was different... he had a couple of complications, we feared for his health..." Dean reminded
“please Dean let me hold jack too” Cass was exhausted but wasted to hold his babies. Dean place Jack on his arms as well and them quickly backed up a little to take a picture with his phone to send to Sam and Gabe
The babies were fine, he was fine, all he did all day is rest, eat healthy food and work from home. His was of 5 months now and had a big belly. He was hungry all the time, hungry for food and for sex.
It was a normal day, he had gone to track and then headed to the omega showers. He was showering when a pair of hands had gripped his hair and crushed his head into the wall. The pain and fear blinded him for a moment and then he head him. It was ketch, he was over him now. His words were hurtful
“Honey…” Dean understood  this fuss was because yeah, they had lost 5 years, wonderful years where recently mated couples share the most beautiful bonding experiences, mating, marrying, moving in together, mated heats and ruts, pups… and they have been prevented from doing any of that
“Oh darling you are a miracle … I will be by your side babe, I missed you so dam much” Dean said crying onto Cass´s shoulder “I love you, I love you”
“The body is empty, the man died of a heart attack outside a bar. In here it is just me” he said and Dean looked at him with an intriguing light in his eyes and Michael felt a pang of hope. “I came to give you this” He tended a piece of paper towards Dean. There was a rune written on it. Dean hesitated but Castiel who was behind his husband looked at it “It is a protection sigil in Enochian, it is safe”
"It is normal to feel like this babe, she will love school and we will have some time for ourselves" said Castiel with a flirty thone
“Oh fuck Dean!” said Cass abandoning himself to the pleasure that his pate was giving him hi was hard again and Dean took him in hand controlling his pleasure, there was not an inch of his skin that was not on fire and suddenly bliss overcame him and he closed his eyes feeling his alpha filling him again and again.
Castiel felt like his blood had been drained from his body. He felt like puking. He sat down and said nothing for a whole minute.
"This is a conversation that I would like to have with you as Alpha and Omega, please" Cass couldn't say no to those green eyes looking at him so intently.
"What is happening darling, is the baby alright?" Dean placed his hand on the small baby bump that was still not very noticeable.
"But he pull through and the day they got him home we were all amazed, being so small I would have guessed you all would end up being tall alphas" said Sammy
During the rest of the book, Gabriel and Jared slowly fall in love while the trio try to find a way to get Jensen out of the pit. Just in the last chapter when they find a way and they get Jensen out. Misha hugs him tight but Jensen doesn´t reciprocate. His eyes are black. He is a Demon.
“Its me, Michael” he said. They all looked at him taken aback by his presence. All hunter pointer their weapons towards him.
“They were not bothering me, I just introduced them to Cass and that took me down memory lane. I guess I was not ready” Dean Said and Sam nodded in understanding. He had forced this on Dean. He felt horrible.
“I am good, how is our angel doing? Hello Cass” she said checking on the machines. “Everything is good and about the tux, on Gardenia road there is a second hand shop and they get a loto f wedding stuff, my mate bought a nice tux there, only used once for almost no money, and it was perfect, very elegant” She smiled politely
"You mean you lied to me, for two whole years.... and now you just bring him over and what? you though that I would be ok with this?" Castiel said quite angry and his daughter for such lie
He had insinuated to his alpha, he had tried to put on sexy lingerie remembering that this belly was due to some garther belt, silk panties and transparent bralette. He didn't fit in any of those things anymore... but what is sexier than wearing nothing?
Later at the Garage, Mr Klein all suited and elegant came along with a shot guy, dressing informally and a lollypop on his mouth. He was introduced as Gabriel Milton. He showed them around and showed them the repairs he has donde in his baby after the accident. They were convinced that this was the place.
By morning the heat and rut were gone and in the bed Cass and Dean were sound asleep on wet bedsheets with love bites all over their bodies. Mating bites on their necks a a baby growing inside the Omega.
Dean smiled and told him that he would call for diner to be delivered there, so they could enjoy the fire longer. The pizza arrived 15 minutes later and Castiel seemed delighted with the menu. They talked about the book and their lives for hours until it was so late that it was almost morning.
Castiel knocked on the door and a beautiful man opened the door. He was no doubt and alpha, and a damm powerful one.
degrading... he was going to kill him. Castiel reacted and fought back but ketch punched him to almost unconsciousness. Everything turned black and red. Cass heard all the filthy threats Ketch was making.
When he was finally by himself Dean felt like he could breathe again, Damm he was magnetic, the deep voice his electric eyes... he was like... he was like he had imagined Misha to be.
