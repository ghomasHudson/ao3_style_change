He looks up at you confused. You grab him by the hair and push his head back and ride his cock he moans loud. His cock is so close to coming. You can feel its throbbing and wanting to come in your tight wet pussy.
"I am not mad! I'm just confused how this happened and Like, why wasn't I invited?" You almost cry out. Dean looks at you confused and asks "Are you into this? I don't know how it happened"
Dean does exactly that he wants Cas more than anything right now. Henever knew how much he wanted Cas and seeing him like this, seeing him fuck his girl, seeing his girl get off on fucking him. has done something to him.
Cas is gentle at first he works all the way in working him slowly to get him used to the size of his long cock. Dean's moaning as Cas tip of his cock hits his prostate over and over again. Going nice and slow....
"Would you like that Dean? Do you want to watch my hard cock slide in and out of Y/N nice wet pussy while she moans our names". Dean nods his head in response of Cas words and his cock is so hard! He never knew Cas could do this to him.
Cas is fucking you hard Making You Moan so loud, Dean has moved to the front of the Impala and starts kissing you from the passenger seat and Playing with your nipples. Dean rises to line up his cock with your face and you wrap your lips around his hard cock. You start deepthroating him, he tastes so good. You loved his big cock so much.
Cas slowly starts jerking his cock as he watches Dean lineup to fuck you hard.. so hard Dean plows into you making you moan. Cas is jacking off watching you two fuck; you're so close to coming..
Cas says out loud "Mmm That pussy is so wet for me, so wet for us! Do you want me to fuck you? Or do you want me to fuck Dean?" You let out a gasping for air "Can you fuck me? And then I want you to watch you fuck Dean". Dean's face turns bright red with embarrassment. Cas replies "Hmm Maybe I'll fuck you and Make you cum all over my fat cock instead; Then make Dean watch me Fuck you so hard! I bet he'd like that!
You move to the front seat so you can get in front of Dean and kiss him feeling him moan into your mouth as cas thrusts into him something you've never witnessed before. Cas is slamming harder into Dean now which is getting him closer and closer to cuming for him.
When they arrive at the bunker Cas calls Sam "Hey Sam I ran into Dean and Y/N at the bar can you come and grab Y/N and put her in bed for me" Sam agrees and quickly hangs up. "Wow, sure looks like you guys had a fun time tonight everyone seems a little tipsy! Excluding Cas considering he could drink a whole liquor store and only catch a buzz!". All three of the guys laugh and Sam picks up you and brings you in the room and puts you to sleep like he's your big brother.
go home with her. I couldn’t ask to go home with you.
Charlie shook out her fist from where she’d punched Sam in the shoulder. “Dude, don’t make assumptions.”
a childhood when he asks for one, Dean? On settling down somewhere? I thought the life of a hunter was good enough for a kid!”
For a moment they just stood there, eyes locked. Dean was beyond glad that, even if his vessel looked different right now, Cas’ eyes still looked just the same.
“That- that’s really sweet, kid.”
“I dunno Jack, you picked your own dad, and Cas is pretty awesome. I suppose we can let you into the club on a technicality though,” Dean joked further, and Jack leaned back with a smile.
“Dean.” Cas stepped into the room, as close to Dean as he dared. “Right now your emotional well-being is my priority. Jack will be fine. Rowena has raised no concerns about any kind of time limit on reversing the spell. But the conversation you had with Jack the other night, combined with the way you spoke with Sam today? It can’t have been easy.”
Cas stayed quiet for a moment. Dean stroked his hand down Castiel’s arm, back and forth, and the sensual touch helped to ground him even as the wave of static in his head threatened to break over him. “I want my own body back.”
“You flew? But I thought- I thought none of you could fly anymore! How is that possible?” Dean looked up at Cas, and realized the position they were in, with Cas cradling him in his arms. Noticing Dean’s disorientation, Cas helped Dean stand now that he was lucid enough to support himself.
Forever grateful to Charlie for the accounts she’d set up to bankroll their weird off-the-grid lifestyle, Dean grinned. “Let’s get him a pretty comprehensive basic wardrobe to start; we can afford it today.”
It was almost a skirt really- a couple pieces of fabric held together with a long sash- but she’d said it could be worn in a number of ways, including as a dress, depending on how you wrapped and tied it.
“What do you mean, working on it? I know you’ve just been reading novels over here, so what could you possibly be working on?”
“Oh, I just. I think it might be time to talk about that. And normally saying something like that would freak me out, but right now it just feels right.” Dean rocked back on his heels and stood up. “Alright, even though I’m feeling better than I usually would when talking about something like this, I think this conversation could use something to drink and someplace more comfortable to sit. Jack- wanna get your bear and meet back in my room? We can sit on the memory foam for a while.”
“Okay?”
There were a few stories that Dean started but couldn’t finish. Sam running off to have Thanksgiving with a classmate while he was stuck covering for him. A time he’d run out of the money John had left, and had to find a way to feed Sam. His seventeenth birthday, where John and Sam spent the day together alone while Dean was on his first solo hunt. But the fact that he was able to refer back to these stories at all was progress.
alright?”
Rowena’s lilting voice came up beside them, and Cas gladly stood back to let her take over. He thought she could be much more objective about the situation, and more sympathetic to Sam, than he could at that moment. Personally, he wanted to shake the man for taking for granted the sacrifices Dean had made to ensure that Sam had a childhood. The conversation Cas, Jack, and Dean had shared the other night had been illuminating in both what Dean had said, and what he didn’t say, but all of it pointed to exactly the situation Dean had described just moments ago.
The second thing he noticed was the mess. He must have been carrying a plate when he passed out, because there was food everywhere, mixed in with shards of the dishes they’d found when they’d moved into the bunker, plain but serviceable and matching. It was breakfast, he noted idly.
“I left you alone and unarmed-”
”Yes, I did, I did and I’d touch it, even long after it was gone, it’s all I can think about whenever I touch that spot!”
“Or?”
“No, I’m pretty sure none of the other angels are experiencing this, I think it’s just Cas and myself!” Jack’s excited chatter caught everyone’s attention. “Isn’t it great? I must admit, I didn’t realize this was likely to happen when I made the spell in the first place, but after some of the translation work we did today, it makes perfect sense that this would be one of the results!”
“Alright bitches, let’s go unload the car!”
“I never would have thought… But we’re getting off-topic.”
“Sam,” Eileen said insistently, tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention. Without even signing, their eyes seemed to hold a silent conversation, before Sam slumped slightly.
“That was quite the explosion. Will Dean be alright?”
“I can see how that would be a concern. But we’re a ways out yet from being able to break the spell, and who knows, you might come out the other side better than you were before.” Rowena had her hand on Dean’s shoulder, and it took him a moment to realize that she’d very deliberately placed her hand on the opposite shoulder from the one Cas had grasped when he’d raised Dean from Hell.
“She really seemed to like
“Everything alright, man?”
“Not that I can think of. We should check on everyone else, see if Jack-” before Cas could finish the statement, they heard a wail coming from the library. “Jack!”
“Feeling any better, Cas?”
Not that it would ever matter, of course. But that was okay. Having him here was more than enough.
So Dean hid. Like a coward.
And Cas responds, “I don’t remember why I stopped in that specific diner, but the first time I did, I glanced across the way and saw you. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything any more than I could bring myself to stay away. It only took a few visits before Andrea got suspicious, and I told her... not everything, but enough, that you were ‘the one that got away’ and that I’d known our relationship had an end date but...”
Fifteen minutes into dinner, Castiel admitted to himself that asking Rowena for advice on where to take Dean on a “date” may not have been the most effective strategy- it was obvious that Dean was extremely uncomfortable, and on top of that, he was bored. At the time, he’d tried bringing up his concerns, but she’d waved them off, advising him to ‘step outside of your comfort zone and try something new’, reminding him that she’d had an absolutely exquisite experience herself the last time she’d gone.
Dean sighed with relief. “Can’t tell you how glad I am to hear that, man. So- this is definitely some kind of magical nonsense- anything you’ve run into before?”
“Sam will be fine. This is the most I’ve seen Dean ever talk about this, though.”
“You already take care of me and you do so much and I didn’t want to be a burden-”
“I, uh. Told her. Kinda on accident but she took it well… sweetheart.” Dean took a gamble on the endearment, knowing that Sylvia already thought they were dating, and was rewarded by Cas’ face turning crimson.
And then wrinkled his nose.
“Cas. You’re my best friend. You’re a fucking Seraph, one of the most badass angels I’ve ever met, and you know me better than anyone else but Sammy. Or… no, actually, you might know me even better than he does at this point.” Dean pulled his fingers through his hair and gave Cas a crooked smile. “Please. Having you there will make this easier.” He reached out to where Cas stood, shifting uncertainly from foot to foot.
”And... has that changed? Do you feel the same? Or could you, in time?”
He didn’t know everything about Dean’s childhood yet, but he knew enough.
“Okay.”
Dean stood perfectly still as his phone vibrated again with another text from her.
For a moment, it looked like Jack was going to take the bait, and start asking questions about that period in their lives, but he caught himself. “Still, though. This wouldn’t be happening if I hadn’t cast my spell all wrong.”
be a novel experience- but this was meant to be an opportunity for you to relax, rather than staying cooped up and stressed in your room.”
Cas saw Dean’s face crinkle with a moue of disgust. “I mean I know I’m hot but that’s really weird to hear from my little sister.” Somehow, knowing that Dean didn’t want to pursue even this fleeting and temporary attraction from his other best friend now that they would technically be compatible, gave Cas a sense of relief.
‘What?’ He barked back.
At the end of the day she stood with her friends to one side of the car park, waiting for Dean to show as he had promised.
He almost tripped over a pile of boxes in the hallway. A new neighbour was moving in opposite him. An odd time of day to do it.
‘Thank you Becky. I need to sort some things. I hope you have someone who can help you through this.’ Becky nodded silently as Dean ushered her out.
‘Once everything was up and running again and he had calmed down, he tried my ideas. Didn’t like them. Said I should take the stick out of my ... well you know. We sat down and tried some things out together. The music we wrote that day became Empty.’
Cas nods with a small polite smile.
‘Are you 10?’
Dean’s gaze flicks to Cas. Hell. Of course that’s a sensible idea. Why had he suggested sharing a room. Oh god. He should leave off hard liquor as it makes him an idiot the day after too. He fails to answer Ben.
‘Hello Sam. I bought some wine. I haven’t tried it. I hope it is acceptable.’
‘They’ll likely drag my name through dirt.’ Cas shrugs. He really doesn’t care. He looks up at Dean, then down to his foot. ‘How is your ankle? I’m pleased Amara could take you. I heard her drop you off.’
‘Yes Dean?’
‘Why are you in a hotel this time?’ Cas hadn’t thought about it before. He recalls Dean usually stays with Sam and Eileen.
‘Neither!’ She beams, ‘Sam is going to be a Leahy.’
Claire detaches herself and heads into the waiting embrace, breathing in his smell as she burrows her head into his chest. ‘I had no idea it was going to be like that, Dad.’
Dean breezes in, beautiful as ever. ‘Cas! Have you tried the bed? It’s heaven!’ He’s flung himself, starfish-like, across the middle of his bed. Cas is stood in the doorway watching his friend grin as he bounces on the bed like a child. The smile is catching. Cas can’t help himself grin back. He relaxes. This is what he’s here for. It’s going to be fine.
The bar is empty aside from the two of them. Dean gets up to hit the head before getting going. That thought gives him pause. Where is he going to go? He can crash with Bobby he supposes. But after that...?
‘So, Cas, Eileen tell us a bit about your family.’ Ellen started once they were all slowly digesting their gargantuan pancake stacks.
‘Dean?’ The confusion was evident.
He turned to her with a smile, ‘I’ve enjoyed you being here too.’
Dean hobbled away before Cas could reply.
‘Yes, of course, Dean you’ve always known I love you.’
Sam stares at the drink in his hands for a moment.
He’s never had a friend quite like Cas. They’ve only known each other a short time but he feels like he knows Cas better than any other friend he has.
Dean leaves the group quietly without the others noticing and makes his way back into the bar.
Cas waits for him to look up. Dean feels overwhelmed by the beauty in the blue eyes that seem to peer into his soul.
‘Cas…’ Dean starts.
‘Cool? Go travelling. Be good to get away. Have your own space for a bit.’ God what was he even saying.
Dean feels warm and heavy with satisfaction. He’s here, surrounded by family and friends and
Dean hesitates. Something about the way Castiel asks it makes him feel like… Castiel’s not used to having friends. And as much as Castiel is an awesome guy who deserves friends, Dean would really rather they were the kinda friends that kissed and had sex and cuddled in Dean’s bed upstairs. He’s been wanting to kiss Castiel for some time now.
“Save it,” Crowley interrupts, looking bored. “I can’t have employees trooping in and out of here whenever they please.”
The TV spits white noise at them. From where he’s collapsed against the headboard, Dean says, “This was a huge waste of time and money.”
“Huh?”
“Dean. Where are you going?” Castiel steps up so he’s leaning against the open door and Dean can’t shut it on him. The wild, desperate look in Dean’s eyes frightens him. This close, Dean’s discomfort is obvious. His skin is flushed at the cheeks and along his throat. His temperature is elevated enough that Castiel can feel it emanating off him. And the scent. So strong. Amplified even more so than usual. He smells. Wonderful. Like swelter and musk and something else. Something inalienably identifiable as Dean. Castiel pauses, mouth suddenly watering. His hold on the door slips clumsily as he shifts his feet, trying to decide if he wants to step closer into the magnetic draw of Dean’s heat, or step away to clear his head.
The waitress eyes them nervously as they leave. She doesn’t smile. Dean makes sure to tip her handsomely, and winks on his way out. He calls Bobby and catches him up on the Heaven situation as he drives to the police station. It’s barely two minutes away.
Castiel looks up, finally meeting Dean’s gaze. “Really?”
“Nothing.”
“Far as we know, yeah,” Dean shrugs, hands in his pockets. “Alright, listen up. I was gonna enforce a curfew anyway. No one out of their cabins after sun down. We want to lay low. Lights and noises in the nighttime are only gonna attract attention.”
At the table, Dean ends up sandwiched between Castiel and Sam, and it's really fun to watch Castiel and Charlie get on like a house on fire. Kevin and Sam talk loudly with each other over some issues with their classes, and Jess engages Dean in conversation about the TV shows they both watch. Now that Dean knows Sam was friends with the guy he’d been crushing on for about a year, Dean thinks it’s a little odd that Sam’s never had Castiel over before. When Castiel excuses himself to use the bathroom and doesn’t ask for directions, Dean realizes that Castiel’s been to their home before. Dean just wasn’t around for it. Figures.
‘Yes Dean.’
‘Well, this place just gets more and more astounding. You boys have managed to build yourselves a family between stopping apocalypses. So you knocked this Cas up then?’ He gestures to Jack, ‘Are you going to make an honest woman out of her Dean?’
‘Sam, go and get Mom. She sleeps like the dead.’ The words died on his lips.
It was like a bucket of ice was poured on Dean.
‘You should have thought about this when you said we should move out. It’s too late to be having second thoughts, Cas.’
They spent that evening in the bunker reminiscing about John over pizza and beer. It felt odd to be mourning someone who had been gone from their lives for so long. But for Mary it was so much more fresh.
‘No, but someone who wants to get on his good side, get his power back?’ Sam speaks his thoughts aloud.
Her head snaps up, delight spreading across her face. ‘You’re staying? Until when?’
‘Uh, what? No, uh, not like that …’
‘I didn’t know you were still in regular contact with her.’
‘He’s running riot and wants to destroy this world like he did his own. We need to stop him.’
‘I looked it up. I know there were rumours about a singer who was their support act at the time. That she and Dean were together. I don’t remember much about Amara, but I think maybe she drove a wedge between them? I don’t remember her coming to the house like his old girlfriend Lisa.’
‘Do you know what I’ve come to realise Cas? That I didn’t know what matters in life.’
‘Nah, we’ve lived together before remember. You need a friend to help you back into the swing of things. Get over Meg, if you want to?’
‘How did you guess?’
‘You would make a good dad Cas.’
‘It’s just while your mum’s coming.’
The boys had gone to bed and Cas was brewing an herbal tea for himself. Dean sat down at the island. He poured a glass of whiskey, offering Cas some. Cas declined.
‘Yeah, yeah I know. But I can see you?’ His voice is gruff.
‘What are they fighting over?’ She manages to get out amid a mouthful of cereal. Sam glares at her until she finished chewing.
Cas is following the exchange with ever growing confusion, apparent in his squinted eyes and tilted head. Bobby and Ellen smile, eyes glinting, from the sofa by the fire.
‘If I could I would transport us home in an instant, Claire, but unfortunately I do not possess that power. So we must drive like the mere mortals we are.’ Cas could sense the eye roll behind him.
‘We’ve come a long way. Rather be done with it tonight. Nearly finished anyway.’
In between Dean has to go to the publishing house function. He’s not keen. It’s not his scene. He’s trying to keep a low profile, wants to publish under a pen name anyway, so it’s not like he can really say much when he is there. It’s probably a good thing Cas is coming with him, it will look like Cas was the one invited with Dean just tagging along.
‘Mmm sorry to make you uncomfortable guys.’
You turn around And you grab Dean by the hair And tell him "fuck Cas, I want you to fuck Cas hard, make him pay! make Cas come hard" cas is laughing and sets up And Whispers in your ear "I'm the one in control here; you're just along for the ride, sweetie".
Cas says "stop stop I'm going to come stop" So you slowly slide off. He so is wanting for your pussy to be back on his cock. Dean moans at the sight of Cas dick so hard for you and for him.
You walk in shortly after and eye a good looking guy but no where near as good looking as your sexy hunter. He locks eyes with you and you make small talk and then take a quick glance over towards Dean and you see him staring at you. Probably to make sure he doesn't need to hop up quick to fuck someone up. The guy buys you a drink and then he seems to get scared off by the way Dean is glaring over at you both, so you roll your eyes and make your way over to him. You can see him licking his lip as you walk towards him and it makes you weak in the knees.
Cas is pumping harder into Dean's ass. Seeing Dean come like that was the best thing. He plows into Dean's tight pink asshole until he comes deep inside of him moaning loud! You're gasping for your breath, All of you are.
You wake up to the sound of the Impala's door closing and you jump out of bed and grab Dean's gun to investigate as you're walking out of the door Sam asks "What are you doing Y/N?" you reply "I thought I heard Baby's door open". Sam says "it's probably just Dean and Cas they were out there talking when I brought you in because you passed out". "oh ok, well I'll go check it out anyway". Sam nods and says if you need me you can just whistle for me.
"What what is going on" you whine out.. Dean quickly says "I don't, I don't know what happened.. It just happened and we're here and.. and I'm so sorry don't hate me." Cas just looks at you with apologetic eyes.
Cas looks at dean and says "bend over Now!"
Cas lines up behind Dean slowly inserts the tip of his hard cock the moans and groans but loves that Cas is going to be the first cock he's ever going to take.
You've always known they have had some kind of profound bond and seeing them together has been torture. You've wanted them to kiss for so long with the eyes they give one another. I'm surprised it took this long.
You have both the boys moaning. Which gives you such an empowering feeling? Cas grabs your hair quickly and in one swift move Bends you over the seat in the Impala. Cas lines up behind you and shoves in deep and hard making loud moans and Dean gasped at the sight of his Angel inside of his girl.
You walk out and you see the Impala moving slightly and you start saying "Hello, Who's there? Dean will kill you if you screw with his car!".
You're walking back from the bathroom and see Dean obviously blushing and you're wondering what him and Cas talked about; while you were gone you decide to brush it off and down the shots that were waiting for your return soon realizing maybe you shouldn't have done all three of them at once as you trip and almost fall and Dean grabs you by the waist and quickly responds "I think that's the cue" and throw the keys to Cas so he could drive all of you home. As you walk to the car Dean kisses you passionately and says he had a wonderful time tonight with you. Now you both are getting in the back seat and you cuddle up to Dean and pass out almost immediately. Cas makes eye contact with Dean in the rearview mirror and Dean says "you know you got me good in there" laughing. And Cas just bites his lip and keeps driving towards the bunker.
Dean looks at you up and down and Says "Hey beautiful what's your name?" you quickly respond "Jessica." you grab a pool stick and tell him to rack up. You motion I've the bar tender to bring you 4 shots of fireball you both down them immediately as if it was a challenge. Dean Goes on to say "my name is Michael and I'm currently in college and working as a mechanic" which you find hilarious Dean in college please! you think to yourself laughing. Dean gets closer to you now and pulls you in and you quickly pull away as to make him work for it. "I think I gave you the wrong impression of me Michael" you say with a wink and walk towards the bar to order more shots for you and Dean when you recognize a Trench coat sitting on the barstool. You know exactly who that belongs to; I mean not many people wear trench coats anymore these days. You quickly grab your shots and take a quick look around for Cas. You do a complete turn and Cas is right behind you and says "Y/N what are you doing here?" You quickly inform him that you and Dean are here playing pool together. You point over to Dean who responds with a quick dismissive wave.
At the foot of the stairs Cas held open the door for removal men carrying in a huge sofa. It looked comfortable. Cas’ furniture still needed replacing.
‘Ah, been a bit busy have you?’ Gabriel gives him a wink.
‘She’s not. They know each other.’
Cas looks at Ben and the both simultaneously mouth fajitas. ‘The latter please dad.’ They both grin at one another. Dean makes mean fajitas.
‘I have a friend, Meg, we spend a lot of time together. She’s my oldest friend. She’s fairly honest which I value. Also Gabriel, he’s my cousin. He’s... unusual. But I don’t do much of interest outside of work I’m afraid. I enjoy reading. I would like to have a garden eventually, have a bee hive if possible.’
‘You have my number, so you must be. Elementary my dear Watson.’
‘I think I might call it a night.’ Sam stood up yawning, ‘Want to grab a lift home Dean?’
‘Dean stay still, please stop trying to move.’ He looked around frantically at them.
‘Sam didn’t tell you?’
Both of them grinning from ear to ear.
‘Oh no, I’ve just realised what I’ve signed up for. Dean Winchester taking me to school in a classic, black muscle car that you can hear a mile down the road’.
Dean doesn’t cope well being constrained by his ankle. Surprise surprise. He’s grumpy and surly and bitchy to everyone. But most of all to Cas.
‘Just checking you’re ok. Claire and Cas are heading out, thought you would want to say goodbye?’
‘Does Jack stay often?’
The two Deans don’t break their stare. ‘It’s when mom and dad met.’
In the weeks leading up to Christmas, Dean doesn’t come to see Claire and Cas. He’s on the road busy with shows. He FaceTimes Claire regularly. He also rejects most of the names she suggests, but promises to think about it.
‘Can I tell you a secret?’ She looks a little confused but smiles encouragingly.
‘So, what else is there to know about you, Cas? Friends? What do you do in your spare time?’
With a smile Cas turned back, ‘You make me happy Dean.’
‘Hiding it, ignoring my true feelings has become second nature. I’ve got so good at pretending I wasn’t sure for a long time if I could feel.’
Ben and Jack slump in the sofa talking a mile a minute about the fishing trip. Poor Eileen can’t keep up so Sam is signing the conversation for her.
Dean went home to have the conversation with Cas that night.
‘Hello Dean.’ Jack beams and holds his hand up. Dean nearly choked at the familiarity of the greeting, said in the same intonation, just a different voice to the one he’s used to.
‘Damnit, yeah I’ll be back soon. Ask them to hold on.’
‘Are you sure?’ He turns to his companion. ‘I can’t see anyone about.’
Cas gave him a tight lipped look.
‘Sounds like a plan. You boys staying nearby?’ John stands up and turns to head for the door.
‘Cas, look, I’m sorry, I know it wasn’t the plan...’ Cas stops him again.
‘No.’
‘Never trust a rental. This your truck?’
‘I’ve come straight from the airport, I hope you don’t mind.’
He turns when Cas calls his name, downs the rest of his drink and walks slowly towards the house. As he comes into the light, Cas can see he’s wearing a tux, bow tie undone and dangling around his neck.
‘Love you Dad.’ With a playful punch followed by a quick hug, ‘See you tomorrow. Are you coming to the house? Seems silly to camp out in your hotel room as you’re so close?’ His smile falters as he nods, but he’s beaming as she steps away.
‘Right.’ Right, of course not. ‘Well you’ll be back. We can visit.’
Three years after moving Ben drops out of school before making it to graduation. Dean wasn’t keen and asked Sam to talk him out of it, but Sam talked Dean around to the idea.
‘I really should get to bed Dean. We fly out early tomorrow.’
Dean got up and started ushering Ben upstairs to get him ready for bed. He was surprised when Lisa joined him. She read Ben a bedtime story (Dean didn’t have the heart to tell her that usually it was the other way around now) and kissed her son on the head before saying goodnight. Dean was waiting at the door when he heard Ben mumble, ‘Missed you, thank you for coming to stay.’
‘It’s incredible,’ Cas breathed.
It felt so different to when Cas hugged him. It wasn’t the same. But it was so close. Dean hugged back.
He turned back to Cas. ‘Sorry, you know’, and gestured outside, ‘See you soon, man’. With a slap on Cas’ shoulder he strode out the door.
Cas eyes Lisa over Jack’s head. She’s standing stock still.
‘You two stop dithering, I’ll go.’ Claire strode off after her father.
Cas avoided his eye.
‘Are you moving into a new apartment tonight?’
‘Uh, want a nightcap?’
‘Cas, sorry about Dean, he can be a real dick.’
‘Hey Claire, how was it?’
Cas quickly stands up and walks into the house.
They unloaded their bags and made their way up the steps, which had been gritted against the heavy snowfall forecast. Upon opening the front door a heavenly smell met them.
‘Hello Benny.’ Cas held out his hand.
‘Cas of course I want you. I’ve just saved your life, made you human, all because I was too selfish to consider my life without you.’
‘Yep. A new film series. His friend Meg got him an audition as the lead alongside her. Sounds like it’s made for him.’
He’s not prepared for Cas coming down the stairs in and electric blue suit with matching blue tie. The exact colour of his eyes. It’s incredible. Dean is stunned. Entirely lost for words.
‘Cas.’ Dean doesn’t turn round. Cas can see from the set of his shoulders that he is angry. Perhaps also from the punch. Dean was good at showing anger, but less skilled at demonstrating thue other emotions which were bubbling beneath the surface. But Cas knew him well. He could read the Dean Winchester emotion smorgasbord without the man even having to turn around.
Her friends were flabbergasted. Part of her loved this bit. She wasn’t so worried about people finding out, like she had been in the past. She found it fun now.
The pair slowly make their way towards Dean and Ben. Ben is being interviewed by a reporter and doesn’t notice them until they are stood beside him.
This was the second album without Cas. This time Sam and Dean had done it all themselves. There was something missing. Dean hadn’t wanted to admit it. Somehow coming to see Cas and Claire had made it more obvious.
Sam’s son looks at his father. Dean can see the hesitation. He doesn’t know his namesake after all. Sam nods, ‘You can tell him anything Dean. He’s my brother. He was beside me every step of the way.’
Dean ran his hands through his hair and ripped off his jacket.
Dean rolls his eyes.
The weather is miserable, monsoon season seems to have arrived so Cas lies on the sofa under his duvet and watches films.
Cas looked back at him quizzically, ‘I don’t want to be a star.’
‘Where’s his stuff?’
Cas is more worried when he goes to bed.
Luckily the flight was called soon after and Dean didn’t have to endure Michael too much longer. It was an evening flight so he put an eye mask on, took some sleeping pills and went to sleep. Easiest way to cope with his flight anxiety and avoid talking to Michael during the flight.
The day arrived and finally they were on their way. The group crammed into two cars and headed off late afternoon to grab dinner nearby before heading to the stadium.
Yes he had had the occasional fling or short term relationship, but nothing serious.
Dean didn’t know what to say. Cas was right. He would feel like that normally. But Cas wasn’t, no, isn’t a man. Cas is an angel. And Cas is the person he loves.
‘You tell me something like that, something I didn’t think was possible. Something I never thought I would get because of everything I’ve done. And don’t even hang around for me to say it too?’
‘Sam Campbell?’ He signs.
Sam is hovering on the edge of the group.
Dean is stood very close to Cas now.
‘You?’ Dean stared at him.
‘Not LA. Or New York?’
Cas had known something was up for a while. Dean was snappy and grumpy.
Surprisingly, the night goes smoothly. The rest of the bar patrons generally leave Dean alone. They sample a few more French whites, getting slowly tipsy. Cas feels a warm and fuzzy glow surround him. The group spend most of the night laughing. It’s easy. Dean is, obviously, a born entertainer. But he does it in a warm inclusive way, everyone is drawn into his stories.
Dean smiled down at Cas, still down at the piano.
He senses Cas before he even speaks. Maybe it’s his scent. Perhaps it’s a noise, a rustle of fabric. Or possibly it’s just an extra sense just for Cas. To know when he’s near.
‘You guys go on, grandmas. I’ll stay with Gabe here.’ Dean looked round the table and realised Gabriel was the only one left, but that he had a girl in his lap.
‘Dean, come inside. We can talk about it. I’m sure we can work it out. Is it Benny?’
‘You didn’t try to stop me, to explain Dean. You didn’t speak to me anymore, about anything important, it’s like I didn’t exist.’ He looked up, tears welling in his eyes.
Dean claps his hands, ‘So, you guys hungry? We’ve got the best burgers ever if you want?’
He’s surprised not to see Ellen at the stove, but the back of a man. He didn’t know another family member was visiting.
He’s waiting for the big guns to come and show him his place. He’ll show them. A passing thought occurred to him that he thought Jack would have dealt with them by now. He will have a word tomorrow.
Dean nods, unsure of how to respond. Cas never seemed to relish the idea of a celebrity lifestyle. He is an artist and enjoys performing. He doesn’t want the baggage that comes with it.
It may have taken them half a lifetime, but they made the most of the rest of their lifetime together. They both walked Claire down the aisle at her wedding. Became doting grandfathers to her children and Jack’s adopted son with his partner. They made it to stage where they were only playing the occasional greatest hits gig. Cas sometimes wrote professionally for others, but he and Dean were constantly writing and singing for one another at home.
‘Cas!’ The man doesn’t falter or turn. Perhaps Dean was mistaken, it’s not him. He replays the scene over in his head.
Cas screwed his eyes up. ‘Balthasar, I love Dean because he is my friend, because of who he is inside, because he is Claire’s father and not because of how he looks, what he does for a living or how much is in his bank account.’
‘Of course, I’ll get you gig tickets.’
‘Oh hey Ben.’ Sam turns to Ben as he saunters onto the front step, ‘I just met your mom. She had to run kid, her plane was going to go without her. She said to say bye to you.’ Dean watches Sam explain Lisa’s actions to Ben with ease, Ben isn’t phased at all. Sam is a real pro.
‘It’s complicated.’
‘Cas chose the film.’ Eileen pipes up.
‘Our dad, Cas. He was never supportive of either of us. Really drummed a sense of duty into Dean. He only sees that, not the positives in his life. He’s terrified of being seen as a quitter.’
‘Suggesting you’re my secret boyfriend, I’m putting out a statement.’
Cas wordlessly heads upstairs and grabs a spare toothbrush, towel and pjs for Dean placing them on the spare bed. ‘Thank you Cas, I really needed this.’ Cas smiles before closing the door behind him.
Dean nods, ‘Yes. But you just have gotten used to the press by now.’
‘Yep.’
‘Want to help with homework?’
‘Jack, please can you help Cas. I don’t know what happened but I need to know he’s ok, I can’t lose him again.’
‘Nooo.’ Dean replies hastily.
‘I heard you.’
‘First star to the left and keep on to morning? Just follow your nose Dean. It’s where you’re meant to be.’
‘Can’t do what, Dean?’
Dean nods, swallowing thickly, ‘Sure man. I mean you’re welcome, you always are.’
‘And his mom is just happy for you to take him off for six months to live in Canada?’ Castiel interrogates Dean
When they drop by Sam’s house on the way for Cas to change, Jack has just arrived back early from his trip. There’s an awkward exchange with a short man Dean assumes is Cas’ dad before he leaves.
‘Cas! What are you doing here?’
‘Ok, enough chick flick moments, let’s get this show on the road.’ Dean climbs into the truck and turns the engine. He plugs his phone into the stereo and turns up the volume, blasting AC/DC.
‘Okay...’
Dean turned around and beamed. Then coughed, looking embarrassed, ‘It will do for me, do you like it?’
‘She is not to be trusted.’ He glowers at Dean and marches him to the other side of the room. Dean barely pays attention to the person Cas introduces him to, as charming as she may be. He politely chit chats for a moment before moving on.
‘Oh. That’s good.’
‘And what about what you said at Thanksgiving.’
‘I know Dean. I’ve decided to break the contract. I’m not doing this any longer.’
Some of his usual ‘decor’ (read guns on the wall) remain, but the rest of the room looks, well, cosy. The bed is bigger, there’s a thick quilt and comfy looking pillows. The practical, basic, military style necessities are gone and replaced with luxuries.
‘How?’
Dean didn’t know he was back from filming. They email sometimes but signal is patchy where Cas is and he doesn’t say much when he does send a message. Dean just sends a never ending list of what he and Ben are up to. It’s obvious him that their friendship meant more to Dean than Cas. Of course it did. Dean is a nobody. Cas is a megastar. Dean is surprised he ever replies at all.
‘It was a secret because I was going to give it to you for Christmas. As a gift.’
‘Great! It’s getting the best reaction, we’re thinking about releasing it as a single.’
Dean is lying in his room, earphones on, blasting Metallica to calm himself down. He’d seen the look on John’s face. Knew what it meant. Not that John had anything to worry about. It wasn’t like that. It really wasn’t.
‘So, Cas. Balthasar here tells me he met a friend of yours at the weekend.’
‘Just thought I’d check on how you are. You don’t seem your usual self at the moment.’
‘That’s impossible. You are human. You cannot enter the empty.’
Sam, Dean, Cas and Ben get into Sam’s car and head off, with a wave to Jody who is stood on the front porch.
‘Really?’
Anyone who knew Dean well would recognise the tight lipped look, the slight hunch to his shoulders. ‘Ah, well it pays to try something new once in a while!’
Dean’s face was a picture.
After they had all become familiar with one another, rooms were allocated. Sam and Eileen had the master room. They settled in while Dean shipped Cas and Claire to interconnecting smaller rooms next door. Jack and Dean were sharing the giant twin room in the other side of the house.
‘I want to relax, enjoy my life, not run from project to project, all around the world, never having a home base that feels like home, you know.’
‘So, when’s Benny getting here?’
‘I’m not ok Cas. My car service brought me.’
Dean opens his eyes and looks around. ‘Still here Cas?’ He turns to Sam,
‘What are you going!? You’re going to miss your part.’
Sam raised his eyebrows. ‘No really, he’s nice. But it’s not like that. I just haven’t told him about you guys.’ A blush rose up Cas’ neck.
‘Hello Dean.’ His voice has more gravel than normal. His throat feels scratchy. He spots a glass of water on the table next to him and drinks half.
‘I’ve never been much for possessions. Comes from having to move so often as a child I expect.’
‘Of course Dean. I will always come when you want me to.’
‘Some people, special people, can perceive my true form, my true voice. It seems that you are now one of those people.’ Cas smiled at Dean. ‘But you’ve always been special to me.’
Dean’s smile is miles wide. ‘You’re damn right you have!’
He started thinking about Cas again. He really hoped he would come and visit LA, the city was so soulless he needed some company for the few weeks he was likely to be stuck there. Charlie was away on a business trip of her own. Benny was working all the time and had barely a free five minutes. Everyone else he knew there was an acquaintance at best. Except for Lisa. And Ben. Ben would love Cas. He should definitely introduce them if he came for a visit. Maybe take them to the zoo. They would both love that.
When he was free of the tube and his bed had been raised slightly so he wasn’t laying flat any longer, Dean croaked to Sam, ‘where am I? What happened?’
Claire hesitated. She knew this conversation was coming eventually.
They exchange numbers, suggest another coffee date the following week.
‘You had to Cas. It was our only chance.’ He looked away, ‘maybe it was the Pearl? We got to see dad, and found a way to kill Michael.’
Soon after, Claire sees the rest of the band packing up to head off. She takes it as their cue to go as well. She rounds up her friends. She waves goodbye to the band, promising them not to stay away for so long, gives long hugs to Sam and Jack, checking they’re still ok for brunch tomorrow. She steps in front of Dean. He hunches his shoulders, she knows that look.
Cas stands back watching the interaction. Amara leans in and kisses Dean on the lips. It’s a chaste kiss but Dean feels electricity. It leaves him speechless.
The next day after taking Claire to school, Dean returned to a quiet house. They had used the SUV that morning as even Dean realised that a repeat of the day before was liable to make her explode at him. He wanted at least one member of his family to love him still. Due to his lack of transport he knew Cas couldn’t have gone far, but he wasn’t evident in the house either.
Dean looked stricken. How could he have forgotten and let his father walk into this?
‘Where is everyone else?’
‘More like she found me?’
Not his arm, his shoulder. Goodbye Dean.
‘Like a double date?’
After a few weeks he met Eileen for lunch during his break from the temp work he’d been doing.
‘Oh, so Cas is cooler than me now? Thanks a lot Claire.’
‘I’m sorry Dean, I wasn’t suggesting...’ but Dean has crossed the space between them and starts kissing Cas.
‘Your daughter sure can sing Cas!’ Balthasar yelled over to the sofa where Cas and Rowena were huddled over glasses of wine.
Cas has explained to them both that this isn’t Sam’s fault, that it was his own decision. Neither brother will listen. They are too embroiled in feeling guilty and taking it out on one another. Eileen just rolls her eyes and tells Cas that they’ll get past it.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Cas meet Baby.’ Dean gestures to the gleaming black car. Cas knows little about cars but can see this is a very well, lovingly, preserved old car. Dean opens the garage door, jumps in and starts the engine. ‘Listen to her purr Cas!’
‘I’m sorry Dean. Sam made me, I had no choice.’
‘She seems.. nice’ Sam is being his usual kind self.
Cas brightens. Eileen notices.
He looks around at Dean’s home. It’s quite an old property, full of interesting quirks and character. The kitchen looks straight from the fifties. There’s an amazing library with a well stocked drinks cabinet on one side. He even spots a telescope.
‘Yes many moons ago. She was a real hell raiser. Actually, still is! It was nice to reconnect when I moved over here.’
The opening bars of Profound Bond began to play. Dean came to the microphone.
‘What? Yes Dean, far too late.’
Dean makes an appearance down the stairs at that moment, still wet and wearing nothing but a towel. ‘Cas do you mind… oh hey Ben, how was your trip? You get to see any bears?’
She heard shuffling behind her as Dean walked in rubbing sleep from his eyes. ‘Is there coffee?’ He really was like a bear in the morning sometimes. She pointed at the cup set out ready for him. ‘Life saver!’ She got finger guns. That meant he was nervous.
‘I’m not staying with you guys, I can leave you know?!’
‘I love you Dean.’ He picked up his bag and left. Dean comes after him.
‘Will you never get over that Jack?’ Claire hollered at Jack who turned with a toothy smile.
They passed the day mostly lounging by the pool in the sun. Relaxing with his family was just what Dean needed. Sam and Jack arrived just before lunch. They didn’t stay for long, heading off mid afternoon to run errands.
This time Dean pulls Charlie into a hug.
A date was set when Jody’s parents could watch the two kids, and they went out on the town. After some shots and cocktails the discussion turned to romance.
Cas looked up, ‘Really?’
‘Probably for the best.’ Dean murmurs in agreement as he lets himself be ushered home.
‘What’s next week Dad?’ A glowering Claire comes down the stairs.
‘Ok then, we need to get popcorn on the way though.’
Dean gave his father a hug. ‘Say hello to Mom.’ Sam gives a small nod. Dean heads purposely out of the bar. Sam watches him go.
‘No.’
‘Cas helped.’ Dean’s heart jumped. He was here? How? Where? Why hadn’t he been waiting for him?
‘Hello Dean.’
He wasn’t expecting what he heard. His head whipped round as he saw Cas singing and playing the piano.
Dean sees movement to the side and catches Cas and Eileen having a conversation in ASL, she is trying to smother giggles, Cas looks concerned. Eileen is holding Sam’s keys.
‘Dean, it’s your decision to make.’
By the time they reach Dean’s house Cas thinks he’s passed Benny’s test, whatever it was.
‘I remember the day I met Dean. He didn’t like me. I had come into the studio where he had been writing and practising. Made some suggestions. He got mad at me. Spilled coffee all over the equipment, there were actual sparks flying around and then he killed the power for the whole building.’ Claire gasped, Cas chuckled.
‘An inside source.’
He was late. Typical.
‘I’m flying out tomorrow afternoon. Got some meetings in LA.’ Dean stands up from his spot watching Cas and starts to put everything away, holding up a hand when Cas tries to stop him.
‘I missed this.’ Dean murmurs.
‘You going to tell me anything about him?’
Dean winced. What a stupid decision they had been.
Sam nods, he gets it. He pulls Jack in,  closely followed by Eileen. They sob into Jack’s shoulder, but they are happy tears.  Jack, having learnt his emotional responses from the Winchesters and an angel doesn’t quite know what to do with his arms. Dean helps him.
They walked round to the sitting room area which was to the left of the entrance hall. This room has bifold doors along the back opening onto a huge decking area. The house was set high on the side of the mountain. There was a relatively small grass area, a pool over near the trees, and then a sharp drop which gave way to beautiful views of the snowy mountains. The sunrises and sunsets from the deck would be stunning.
‘Thank you for coming.’ He hugs his sister and soon to be brother in law. They leave with a wave.
‘Cas,’ Dean breathes, ‘it’s so good to see you.’ He wants to grab Cas for a hug. He holds his hands behind his back to stop himself. They stand close to one another, staring, not moving, not touching. Dean loses track of time.
‘You found the Dean cave.’ Dean grins. Then falters, brushing his hand over the back of his neck. ‘Sorry I didn’t come and get you man.’
‘My invitation must have got lost in the post. I came with a friend.’ Her smile is polite but icy. They make small talk for a moment before Amara pulls Dean aside.
Dean spends a lot of time watching Castiel too (when he’s distracted of course). He is shy with the fans who came to ask for his autograph, he appears confident to the casual observer but Dean could see a simmering nervousness. Somehow Dean had forgotten he was with a famous person. Castiel seemed so normal. He would be a good role model for Ben.
He gets a flash of teeth and a spark in the green eyes which he can’t stop staring at.
Dean threw himself down on Cas bed, hands behind his head.
A few weeks after they met Dean was telling Cas about his chat with her that day over coffee. We should invite Charlie over for dinner soon Cas. You’ll love her.’
‘Don’t do this Cas…’ Dean seems to know what’s coming.
‘Goodnight Claire,’ a smile forms on his lips as she leans in to give him a goodnight kiss on his forehead. Just like he used to give her when she was a little girl.
Castiel blinks, frowning back at Dean. It takes him a moment to process, to reply.
‘Dean,’ her voice softens, ‘You don’t see he does exactly the same for you. I just wish …’
He heads home that weekend to prepare.
‘Yeah? Why wouldn’t it be? Benny is a cool guy.’
Cas reached over for his phone and brought up the track listing.
‘Dean, you had passed out. I was concerned about your welfare.’
Dean couldn’t move, couldn’t speak.
They’re meeting at a wine bar downtown. It’s a nice place, high cocktail tables, waitresses taking orders, bar tenders in bow ties, good music to dance if you want to. He’s looking forward to it.
‘It’s Cas’ birthday, we’re going for drinks on Saturday.’
‘I would be lost without you, Dean.’ Cas murmurs.
His shoulders slump. ‘This is going to start a war in my family’.
‘We’ll need a new refrigerator, that one has seen better days. And I can fix that loose step. Maybe paint outside.’
‘Uh, there’s a reason that’s my favourite song’ She rolls her eyes at him. He pulls her in close for another hug. ‘Dad, you know this isn’t very rock and roll, right?’
‘Actually, we’re really close to my apartment now. I can walk from here.’
‘I just, I can’t do it Cas.’
Dean flashes a grin at Cas, ‘I’m a one man army.’ A cheesy line from a film, one of his favourites, but still. Cas rolls his eyes. Sam chokes.
Sam came wandering into the room a short while later. They were still talking about angels. He filled them in in some of the lore that Mary didn’t know, some of their history with angels.
Dean Jr holds up his hand. Dean is expecting to see a scar from an altercation.
A short while later they stop outside a bar. They’re on the edge of a big city, so it’s a nice wine bar. Dean grabs his leather jacket from the back seat and they stroll inside. They are shown to seats at the back of the bar, their waiter gapes when he comes to serve them.
When he does, the ensuing conversation is unexpected.
‘We’ve always coped before when Chuck goes off like this.’
‘Dean.’ Said Sam , simply. ‘You know I fell out with Dad before college. He wanted me to become a roadie, work with him and Dean. I wasn’t interested. But I got into music in college. Started playing with a band. Dean came to watch, saw that I was much better than he expected. Asked me to join him. Not as a roadie, to make a band together.’ Sam smiled at the memory, ‘I was getting close to burn out anyway, thought I would just postpone a semester, have fun with Dean and then come back. But I never went back.’
Dean is preoccupied. He is trying to get into the inner circle of the production team for the new show he’s on. He’s been buddying up with Michael. He hates it. It does seem to be working, but he’s really having to a schmooze, get involved in the industry. Go to all the parties, be seen by all the right people as he’s working the machine.
Home. With Dean. Best friend. Cas could get used to this.
‘But it’s not enough.’
‘Things change Dean.’ Cas snapped back. This was a recurring theme of their conversations. All of a sudden the ease between them evaporated.
He rushes around the house on Saturday morning doing his chores and grabs a cab to downtown to meet Eileen for brunch.
Applause sounded. Dean was beetroot coloured. Gabriel wolf whistled. Castiel beamed. When the clapping quietened Cas leant over and whispered into Dean’s ear, ‘Dean Winchester is my hero. I could not have put it better myself.’ Dean is pleased that the lighting is low so no one can see the purple colour his ears turned.
‘What? How?’
‘Wow, way to say I have a stick up my butt.’ He flips the pancake he’s working on, then adds it to the growing stack.
‘No Cas, why keep it a secret? We’re done with those I thought? Then you jump up behind me on stage too.’
Cas gave her a ‘look’. She just smiled sweetly back at him.’
‘I quit.’
‘You know you don’t get that choice right, Cas?’
‘Oh I shall, after I have him,’ her tendrils start to wrap higher. Dean lurches forward.
As Ben and Jack race of, Sam and Dean chuckle and head outside. Dean grabs some beers from the cooler he keeps out there and they slump into chairs. The house backs onto a river and they watch the boats lazily trundling up and down.
‘Good choice! It’s my brother Dean’s favourite. I like a chocolate fudge sundae myself.’
‘Is it too late to change the single release?’
‘Any and all plans at the moment are made with you.’
‘I’m trying ok.’
‘Right, dinner, fancy place, sounds like a date to me. How did he meet him?’
‘Ok, if we must.’ ‘Come on Dad, don’t be a spoil sport.’
‘Thank you Cas. I’m glad you have faith, because I have none left.’
‘I see.’ Cas peers at him. ‘Would you like to join me at the bar?’
He sat at the table and texted Claire. Then he fidgeted with his napkin. He should just go. The waiter arrived with a menu and some water and his companion for the evening. Too late.
‘I, it’s not like that, it’s, I just, I was done but, Sam he needed to carry on, and I just couldn’t, but ...’ tears sprang to his eyes.
‘Oh, I’m taking these two to see Dead Men Walking. Do you want to come to LA?’
‘Cas...’
They head into the library just in time to see Cas and Rowena descending the stairs.
‘We haven’t done so well with the new album as well. I need to work out how to  fix it.’
‘Hello Dean.’
‘Ok.’ A pause. ‘You’ll tell me if something’s wrong?’
Cas reasons with her, ‘We might let you have alcohol on occasion Claire, but I’m not going to let you join in a drinking game.’ Claire pouts.
It sounded like a good plan. But as these things usually go, it didn’t quite work like that.
Cas can feel the flush creeping up his neck again.
‘There’s a garage at the top of the hill, I know people there I can arrange a tow.’
‘Great buddy.’ He turns to Cas, ‘Where did I put my shoes when we got in last night?’ Cas’ stands mute, he can’t form words. Ben jumps in to save him, grabbing his dad’s shoes and following him back upstairs gabbling about his trip.
‘But I thought you knew?’ The squinty eyes and head tilt are in full force.
He went to the check in desk, ignored by the press and Cas’ supposed friend.
Cas had no choice. Sam couldn’t play. He had to sit down. Sam had no microphone. He had to sing.
He feels a warm gust of wind and looks up to see Cas before him. Dean launches himself to his feet and grabs Cas, pulling him into a bone crushing hug. Cas hugs back, but pulls away quickly. Dean can’t let go of him, but Sam and Eileen are frantically questioning Cas about their son.
Cas stopped the car. ‘We’ve arrived at our destination now. Thank you for joining me.’
‘Yeah? But only coz you offered pizza.’
‘Dean, this is Rowena. We do yoga together on a Tuesday. I imagine, as you have very similar personalities, that you will get along well.’
Claire looked at him suspiciously but didn’t question it. They all started to say goodbye when Jack piped up suddenly. ‘Can I come back with you guys? I’ve still got a few days before I need to head back to work.’
‘So, tell me about your family then Cas.’
He decides to reassess his previous liking for Donna. She’s got a playful glint in her eye. She knows exactly what she’s doing. He deserves it, he supposes.
‘You have nothing to apologise for, I was the one not paying attention.’ He counters.
Dean put down his fork and turned to look properly at Cas, ‘I’m really sorry for your loss.’ Cas held his gaze.
Dean’s stance softened slightly. He’s shoulders drooped.
‘No worries,’ he learnt casually against the island. ‘Just having a snooze outside. Making the most of my holiday.’
Dean speed walked home, he could pick Gabe’s brain tomorrow find out where Cas was, when he would be back. Dean had heard nothing from him.
He didn’t see Dean again until he came home two weeks later.
‘Late for you guys isn’t it?’
The camera zoomed suddenly, taking the focus away from Dean and on some people coming up the steps at the side of the stage. Wait, was that? Oh my god.
‘How do you know about that?’ Eileen queried.
‘Morning sunshine.’
‘Why do you look like this?’
He shorts, slightly disgruntled. But she’s probably right.
Cas stared at him. He has never been on stage. No one had ever heard him sing. He couldn’t do that.
He arrived at the lodge they had rented with Claire for the holiday a little ahead of schedule. One of the others must already be there as he could see smoke coming out of the chimney.
‘Are you looking for love Castiel?’
‘I won’t get a boyfriend Dean.’
‘Sure, man. Uh, I’ve got some meetings with some execs, bunch of marketing stuff for a film I made last year. Meetings about a possible new series they want me to be involved in. Some about a guest role. Boring stuff.’
‘I think Donna is right. You need to do some exercise to counteract the grease.’
‘No. He’s got his own place but he’s rarely there, he’s either on the road or here.’
‘Plus, Gabe is now one of my best friends?’
Nine pairs of eyes looked at her with wonder. Vigorous nodding all round. They worked their way round to a roped off area to the right of the stage, close to the front. They showed their badges and were let through. As promised, there were plenty of soft drinks around, they avoided the bar, but enjoyed people watching.
He starts pacing, Cas shifts awkwardly. There’s silence for a few moments.
‘You do that Castiel. Goodnight.’
He could feel time slipping away from him. He had lived for millions of years, but it had never felt like this before. He knew he couldn’t have what he wanted. He knew if he did that he would everything lose everything he had now.
‘Is he coming as well? It will be nice to meet him.’ He’s never met Sam’s brother, he travels for work a lot and Cas has never been around when he’s visited Sam.
‘Yeah Cas I know.’
Eileen’s eyebrows drew together in confusion, ‘He’s gone. His flight is,’ she checked her watch, ‘in half an hour.’
‘You found it?’
‘Yes, thank you Dean.’
Eventually the evening started to grow dark. Claire went inside to do homework.
‘Of course, would The Macallan M suit you?’ Dean gives a cursory nod, turning his attention back to Castiel.
‘Of course Sam. Anything.’
‘Jody loves me!’ Claire bounced down the stairs, already on her phone calling Patience.
Dean turned abruptly, stomped behind the bar, slammed a glass down, grabbed a bottle of Bourbon and filled it to the brim.
The following Tuesday Dean wakes up feeling invigorated. Things are looking up. He’s got a coffee date with Amara today, he’s moving on.
‘Yes, of course, no problem here. Why would there be.’
Cas doesn’t know how to respond. Marv is strange, the company is odd, but illegal activity?
‘He’s on the couch!’
Dean splutters. He’s so angry. ‘You almost got yourself killed! You didn’t tell me? I’m your best friend!’
‘I mean I know you said it wasn’t, but it really does sound like a breakup. Well, I look forward to meeting him sometime.’
‘What then?’ Cas brain wasn’t working fast enough.
‘Yes Dean.’
Ben, still inquisitive, ‘Do they still talk?’
She grabs Cas by the elbow and drags him to the door. ‘The rumours are true my friends!’ She grabs Cas by the face and pushes him against the wall, planting a blistering kiss on his lips. After a startled instant in which Cas and Meg stare one another, he appears to return the kiss with similar enthusiasm.
Cas drags on sweatpants and a hoody and heads downstairs, drawn by the smell of coffee and clattering pans.
‘I’m sorry I ruined the evening. I will introduce you another time.’
‘Huh, I wasn’t embarrassing at the weekend when I got you and your friends VIP tickets to my concert was I? They thought I was, and I quote, seriously cool.’ He looked over the top of his sunglasses at her wiggling his eyebrows, he got an eye roll in return.
‘You never mentioned a second Dad!’ She kept quiet.
Cas stands up, ‘I had better head home, have a shower,’ he picks at his shirt, ‘change.’
‘Cas? That you. Thought you weren’t back until tomorrow?’
He looked at Sam as he let go.
‘He just lives with them? Like that’s perfectly normal.’ He glances sideways at his wife.
Cas nods, ‘Of course. I won’t hold you up any longer. Have they agreed to publish your manuscript?’
Jack suggests a number of options. Cas declines them all. Claire decides to broach the subject with Dean when she next sees him.
‘It’s too dressy, it’s just casual drinks with friends.’
Dean snorted with laughter.
‘Seriously, Dad? I’m 16. Cas had the talk with me ages ago!’
‘You were great Jack. I didn’t even know you were touring with these guys until I saw the flyer. Why didn’t you tell me? It’s a brilliant idea!’ She smiles warmly at him, before turning to her friend ‘Would you like to meet Beth?’
She pottered around trying to find a book she hadn’t read in Dean’s collection. She felt a vibration in her pocket and pulled out her phone. It was Beth.
Dean calls frantically for Ben, not wanting him to miss his mother’s departure.
He let out a loud groan. He needed to clear his head. He would never sleep like this.
Cas stands up and puts his hand on his shoulder, letting some of his dwindling grace sooth Dean.
‘Oh!’
‘We need to change your deal.’
Dean felt numb.
They get to the door and show their passes to security. Once they are backstage, it’s total chaos. There are people running everywhere. There’s a group of people stood around the instruments, checking them over. Another group stood by yet another bar downing drinks. People frantically running to and fro.
He must have fallen asleep half way through Princess Bride as there’s a pounding on the door just as Wesley et al are about to storm the castle. The last Cas knew Wesley had been in the fire swamp with Buttercup.
Thank god Ben has explained that. Lisa’s expression shifted slightly.
He’s washing his hands when the lights start to flicker. What? There aren’t supposed to be ghosts or demons here. Then the roof starts to shake. Oh. He forgot about angels. What do the dicks want now.
‘I hear you gave Cas a good send off.’
‘Cas, wait!’
And he doesn’t recognise him.
She marched into the room and pulled the blinds on the doors which led outside. ‘Morning sunshine!’
‘Cas, you will not be taking my nephew into a den of iniquity. That’s my job!’
Amara’s warm smile momentarily falters. Cas appears at Dean’s side.
‘What?’
‘Uh, yes, I suppose I have. I was thinking about buying a place up there. But, um, I’m not now.’
Dean’s eyebrows skyrocket as he turns back to Sam, who just shrugs.
Dean looked down, how could he tell his father he died to save him. Sam steps in again.
Cas hums thoughtfully.
‘Has she now.’
Cas looked up smiling. ‘Hello Mary.’
‘Told me what?’
‘Ha, don’t you worry Cas, you’ve never seen anyone eat quite like my brother.’
‘Dean Winchester. The Dean Winchester is at the bar.’ Oh.
‘But you didn’t tell me.’
Cas that stands there. Dean waits for him to respond, when Cas doesn’t, he stinks further into the room and throws himself into a chair.
‘So what, you were going to turn this into some sort of kinky dream? Just great!’ Dean throws his hands up. ‘That’s hardly what I need right now. What are you here for? Why haven’t you come back?’
‘Yes, I’m sure he needs you to help him out.’ Her tone is like ice.
‘He seems nice.’
‘My kind of place Ellen.’ He raises a glass, gets a wink in return. It brings a smile to his face, briefly, until she turns away.
Sam and Dean looked at one another, ‘Chuck?’
Dean blushes.
A false laugh was forced through Dean’s gritted teeth. ‘You know me, a girl in every port.’
Dean stopped short. Cas is staring at him. The goo is up to his chest. He tilts his head to the side, smiles and gives a tiny nod.
‘You knew?’ Cas stares at him, as does Dean.
‘No? But we’ve got a sword of Damocles, just waiting for something to accidentally make you too happy. Like a particularly special hive of bees, or some of those flowers you like so much.’
But I’m still watching over you. And you need to remember what’s happened.
‘I’m very glad I got to meet you, Dean.’
Cas nods, unsure of what best to say.
The evening of the premier he decided to tackle the problem head on. ‘Out with it.’ He demands as he’s fixing Ben’s bow tie.
‘I always reply when you text Dean.’
When she caught up with him he was chopping wood. She stood back due to the flying wood. He was swinging the axe with such force the wood was mostly splitting after one hit. It seemed to be making him angrier.
A path cleared. Their parents slowly made their way through the crowd. John Winchester the young man Dean remembered from all those years ago, before he knew about demons and monsters, happy. He surged forwards and grabbed both boys. ‘I’m so proud of you both, and I’m so sorry.’ Mary joined them and the four of them stood there quietly, savouring being together again.
Cas whirls round. ‘No Dean I had not forgotten. If you want to bring your latest squeeze here that’s fine. I’m sorry I have ruined your plans. I’m well aware that Christmas is about family. I won’t get in the way of you setting up your new one, don’t worry.’
Claire looked up from her homework, ‘Nah, probably just the usual turkey coma in front of the TV.’ Her gauze turned thoughtful, ‘Though you can cook this year, last year we had to order pizza coz Dad nearly set fire to the turkey but the inside still managed to be raw.’ She gave Cas a side eye glare.
He enjoys coffee. She’s somewhat intense. She works in publishing as well. Some kind of management role, she complains about being locked away from the real action of meeting authors regularly. Her eyes seem to draw him in. He’s transfixed.
Dean’s brain is still a little slow.
‘Wow Dad, what have you been making?’
He heads over to Sam and Eileen’s place for dinner that weekend. Eileen needs some company. Sam is working on a big case and is stressed out. She’s hoping a change of scene will calm him down.
‘Do you know what she told me? That you had contacted her about buying that place too. Said to keep it a secret from me. Why?’
‘You telling me you don’t have lots of jet setting friends?’
Eventually Dean steps in, ‘Ben, I reckon these guys might be a bit tired after their trip. How about we hang out on the deck with those cookies we made earlier?’
As usual, Dean was cooking up a storm for the family. On Christmas Eve he spent the whole day commandeering the kitchen for prep work. He banished Cas, Claire, Sam and Eileen from the house. Jack was writing some new music so he was allowed to stay on the proviso that he stay out of Dean’s way.
‘I hope that the right one comes along.’
‘Cas...?’ Dean whispers, the sound falling out of his mouth in disbelief.
‘It’s not that. It’s Amara. My ex, you remember?’ Cas is fairly sure his heart stops beating.
After copious explaining John seems content to relax into the warmth of the bunker.
‘You don’t want to know how he is?’
Well, that’s not quite true. They’ve had a brief text exchange every day, but Dean had got used to chatting to his new friend. As he was sat idle in the airport, trying to distract himself from thinking about the flight ahead, he realised how he’d got used to speaking to Cas every day. Hell it’s more than he speaks to Lisa.
‘What will it be gentlemen?’
Cas looks thoughtful at that. ‘Sometimes someone’s best is just not good enough.’
‘Yes but Dean, what if they cast Bradley Cooper?’ Jody had her serious face on. Bradley Cooper was her top Hollywood crush. She’s made Dean promise to take her as his date to the premier of the film in hopes she might meet him.
‘I’m looking for Sam Winchester.’ Dean’s ears prick up.
‘Yep, that’s it.’
‘Ok, uh yeah, of course. Um, so are you going with anyone?’
Dean almost forgot John was stood there.
‘Oh, well yes, of course. He’s here.’
How could he be so stupid to fall for his best friend. Who happens to be one of the most desired people on the planet. Who apparently likes guys but doesn’t like Dean. For the love of god! Dean punched his door. It barely made a dent in the wood but the pain bloomed in Dean’s knuckles.
She rounded on Cas, ‘You failed to mention that Claire’s dad was an actual rock star.’
Beth grabbed her arm mid story, ‘So your brother Jack who you talk about all the time, the weird nerdy goofball, is that Jack!?!’ She nodded, ‘Wow! So you grew up with Jack as your brother, and your Dad and Uncle... just wow!’
In a small voice Cas murmured - ‘It’s mine. I thought it could be ours.’
‘Cassie, can you please just tell us all the juicy secrets? So we stop putting our foot in it?’ Balthasar moaned. They left Cas behind while they went for drinks, returning half way through the set, already a little worse for wear.
Dean starts dating again around Easter. Doesn’t generally get past the first date. Gives up after a while. A year goes past. The contact with Castiel ever decreasing. The divorce is finalised. Dean feels an incredible lightness, a feeling he hasn’t had in years.
‘Oh hello yes, your friend from Canada, pleasure to meet you.’
‘I think he loves himself too much to face rejection.’
‘Yep pretty much.’
They talk about Sam and his work with Jack, and Eileen and her business (she’s a speech and language therapist and has her own consultancy business so she can work remotely if she wants to follow Sam on any of his trips). They talk about Dean’s son, he shows Castiel pictures, they are all adorable and Ben looks just like him.  Castiel tells him about his son Jack in return.
The next morning Dean heads to Cas room before making his way to the kitchen. He’s out of luck, Cas isn’t there. He’s pondering where he might have snuck off to, without mentioning it to Dean, when he rounds the door to the kitchen and finds Cas and his dad talking over coffee.
‘Hello, working late? It’s Castiel right.’
‘You’ll love it Dean.’
‘Of course you don’t, Dean. Because you want everything your own way, the rest of us be damned. Nothing is ever good enough for you. I’m certainly not.’
A genuine smile showed through, finally. ‘Yes, she’s, well not quite grown up, in high school now. It’s amazing to watch her grow into this incredibly headstrong young woman. I can see so much of myself in her, but it’s also tampered by the much more calming influence of, uh, the person she lives with.’
‘I’m pretty wiped. Want to crash here with me for a bit?’
Dean sighs.
‘You could bring Castiel? I usually bring a friend along. No pressure for a date. Probably a good place to meet some new people too. And I imagine lots of people would love to meet you Cas.’
‘I’m sorry Dad. It’s not because I don’t love you.’
‘Glad you and Eileen had some time to chill man, you both need it.’ He swallows, ‘I hear Cas has a new gig?’
Sam was watching the impending disaster loom ever closer. He caught Cas’ eye. He knew they were both thinking the same thing.
Cas is reeling. This is the last thing he ever expected.
‘Cas.’ It’s almost a breath, barely even a word. Dean starts towards Cas. ‘Hello Dean.’ Cas turns to him, getting the words out, so casually, like they just saw one another, as Dean starts to speak over him.
They took lazy walks along the beach, drank coffee on beachside cafes and caught up on one another’s escapades.
‘Dean, what are you doing with that woman?’
‘Thanks Cas. You already have. I know I can always count on you. You’re my best friend.’
‘It would work well as a duet.’ Rowena commented.
‘Fine. This weekend.’
‘Dean’s right, Cas is family. When we lost him, it was as bad as losing the two of you.’
He steps out of the car and gathers his things, waves once and strides off to the rear of the garage.
, for Christ’s sake. “Oh, you got me. Good one.”
“Hey,” Dean greets, taking the hand Castiel reaches out to him.
She smacks him upside the head. “For such a smart kid, you sure are an idiot. I wasn't gonna force you to do something you didn’t want. I just wanted you out from under that douchebag Crowley’s thumb. Guy’s bad news.”
“How about we skip the whole–” Dean starts, hotly.
It’s an impulsive decision.
Castiel relents. “Okay. Let's get you fed,” he sighs, but then he tugs Dean’s head back a little roughly by his hair, just rough enough to make Dean pant. “Then it’s my turn.” He picks a spot low at the juncture of Dean’s throat and bites and sucks until he draws the blood up in a blossom of a bruise.
Dean shrugs a shoulder. “So you’re human. It took you a while to do the right thing. But hey, you got there before you caused any serious damage. Honestly, Cas, if this is really the worst thing you’ve done, it’s a far cry from horrible. You fucked up. Join the club. What matters is that you tried.”
“Yes.” Castiel takes a breath and it is already lighter.  He hesitates, holding a breath as he watches Dean’s hand slip under the robe. Breathing becomes difficult again. “Is this what humans do?”
“The way this progressed– it makes no sense. It was like the demons were possessing people that every possessed person came in contact with. Like they were spreading some kind of demon cooties. Is that something that’s even possible?”
“Dean… are you jealous of Meg?” Cas asks.
So Dean’s mattress is memory foam, but Castiel has the bigger bed. And no roommates. It’s wonderful to wake up in the morning to an armful of grumpy Castiel, and Dean never thought he’d feel that way about someone he hadn’t had sex with yet.
Dean was such a wonderful kisser.
It’s been a few weeks since they spoke, and Castiel can’t stop feeling badly about the whole thing. At first, Castiel had been tentative–
“You were running away,” Castiel says. With the words, a weight settles in his chest. It sinks its claws into his heart and begins to radiate an ache.
The cut is clean, the bloodshed minimal. Getting to this point was difficult, but now that they’re here, it’s easy. It makes sense. Her eyes are dry when she looks at Castiel, and he knows that it’s goodbye.
“It matters a great deal, Dean,” Castiel says seriously. “Together, we barely stand a chance, but if Lucifer occupies Sam’s body, you know the results will be catastrophic.”
“Hard lemonades would’ve probably gone over better,” Dean jokes.
Dean doesn’t respond. He thumbs through the book in front of Castiel. He frowns. “What is this? This language?”
“Cas, you’re not listening to me.” Dean reaches the short distance the give in the chains allow him to go. Castiel places himself within arm’s reach. Dean shakes his head, and with a helpless look, turns to spread his hands on the table. “You’ll get a shot and you have to take it. You have to do it.”
“Come on! Last night couldn't have been that bad!”
The smooth planes of muscle, like the ones in Dean’s arms– yes. Castiel pushes Dean’s hands up above his head and kisses up the inside of Dean’s elbow, along the smooth underside of a bicep to his shoulder.
Castiel just lets out a surprised laugh, and Dean finds himself smiling back, heart thumping. Their fingers brush when Dean hands him the bags and the receipt. Instead of just murmuring his usual thanks and leaving, Castiel looks at the receipt. Dean flushes.
“Supply run,” Dean says by way of explanation.
A few hours pass and Castiel is finally able to lift himself off the ground.
“Ooh, who’s the twink?”
“Fuck!” Dean jumps.
“What,” Dean grumbles.
Castiel crawls over him, trying to think. He reaches back, taking out the gun he had tucked in the waistband of his jeans. The right leg of his jeans is streaked bright red with wet paint. The devil’s trap. Broken. He hears the footsteps and sees the shadow cast along the wall before a head looks over the edge of the desk. It’s a man. His eyes are black. Castiel shoots him in the face. The Croat goes down with a choked cry of surprise, slumping over the desk, dripping blood over him.
Cas makes his way over to Dean and sits in a chair near the pool table and watches you two play. He gets more and more confused that you two are using different names and talking weird to one another. You say "I'm going to use the bathroom I'll be back in a few minutes please order more shots!" Cas walks up to Dean and says "What the hell is going on here?" Dean starts explaining to him  "Cas, it's called Role play it's just to spice up our relationship for a night, give us an opportunity to be someone we're normally not or do stuff we've never been able to do" Cas nods like he completely understands and takes two steps closer practically pinning Dean's leg against the pool table with his. He whispers into Dean's ear that he wants in on this role play and Dean blushes and shoves him off of him but Cas laughs and says "oh so now were going to play like you're not into it right Michael" Dean laughs and say "Cas you can't handle all of this I promise" and pops his collar and bites his lip.
Cas rocks his hip so Dean can feel his hard cock rub against his. Dean loves the feeling of the pre-cum between their cocks touching one another. You reach back, and touch Dean's cock and you play with the tip and then slowly grab Cas' dick from behind as well with your other hand playing with the tip using the pre come to jack them both off nice and slow.
