It was Tony that suggested that they find a quite place to hangout without having to be bothered by other people. So, during their break they went around looking for one. They checked out a bunch of rooms but all seemed to be occupied.
“Now that you mention it. You’ll probably die after a few weeks without us having to remind you to eat”, Rhodey stated making Tony pout.
“We will forget about this incident but only if you don’t ever come near Tony and you are officially banned from the host club”, Steve added with a serious voice.
“As expected of poor people. They don’t even have manners. I was just talking to myself. Why would you think I’d want to talk to you?”, she replied putting on a smile which was utterly fake. As if laced with malice instead. As to why he thought that, Tony didn’t really know. He doesn’t remember doing anything to her. And this is the first time he’s seen her. Even though she was a girl, Tony felt like hitting her. Besides she was totally meaning him.
Before the next half of the game started Steve walked over to Rhodey whom he used to see hanging around Tony. Figuring he was a decent guy to ask for help. He told him to pass the ball to him if he happens to get it. The guy stared at him baffled but nodded all the same.
“Ahh, I see”, the guy replied gazing up at the birds that were singing on the nearby tree branch, with a warm smile.
“It’s fine, Pres. I’m fine. Stop mother-henning me”, Tony replied brushing off the concerned blonde. He worries too much.
“Don’t like that I have to go for your heats. Was it really bad?” He knew his Dad had a tough time with his heats.
Tony felt sick. His own baby thought he didn’t want him around. Thought he preferred Harley over him. Thought he ignored him because he wasn’t as big as Harley. Tony sat at the kitchen table with Harley silently. Both of them had listened to Peter quietly telling Steve that he was okay with Harley and Tony ignoring him. Heard him not wanting to eat because he might have to see them. That tore Tony apart more than anything else. His own child, not wanting to see him. They also heard Peter’s muffled crying. How could this go so wrong? Tony always thought it was cute how clingy Peter would get. Never saw it as something to be worried about something to look deeper into. Apparently he was wrong though because Peter’s clinginess was him thinking Tony didn’t want him around and wanted to assure himself he hadn’t lost one of his parents.
“Nooo, Dada.” He pushed as far back as he could go trying to get away but it was no use. The bib as secured way too easily for Peter’s liking.
“I have something even better for you.” Peter looked around Mama as he strapped him back in. What was better than pancakes?
Hey! This chapter was actually quite difficult to write, I'm not sure why but it was. I'm not entirely happy with it as it reads weird to me. Please tell me what you think of this chapter! Comments and Kudos are as always appreciated :)
Peter scowled at his Dad. He wanted to stay with uncle Bucky, not go with Papa. Before he could argue his case though, Bucky was standing up and placing an arm under his butt so that he was in his arms. He let out a yelp and clung to Bucky’s neck, afraid of falling.
Peter found himself nodding along with his Mama. He didn’t really care where they were going once he stayed with him. He cuddled into his Mama’s neck and made himself comfortable, sneaking a look at how different the tower was now that everything seemed to have changed. It screamed money, just like the other tower did but this one was more discreet and less flashy. Where the old tower was ultra-modern with tasteful paintings from the most famous artists around the world, marble counters and floors along with furniture that looked too expensive to sit on. This tower looked to be the complete opposite of what Peter once knew. The walls were still lined with paintings but some of them appeared to be done by children and blown up to be put into a frame. Peter spied his name on one of them and couldn’t help the blush that overtook his face. He quickly looked away and focussed on the other differences around the tower. The floors no longer boasted a black marble design with large expensive rugs artfully placed around the room, instead, there was a very rich cream carpet lining the floors, Peter thought it looked extremely soft. Another thing he noticed was that everyone walked around in their socks or slippers in the tower. The only people, other than himself that seemed to have shoes on was Bucky and Clint. He also noticed that the countertops, while still marble, all had protectors around them so that there were no pointed edges in the kitchen any more. It took the look completely off the countertops and Peter had to admit that he was confused over why they would do that. He lifted his head off of his Mama’s neck and pulled back a bit so he could look at him. Mama smiled his real smile that in the other world he only showed to Peter and Pepper when he was really happy.
Steve wanted to cringe even thinking about the amount of sugar Peter would consume. “I’m sure you will.”
“You can clean that up,” Sam said, in between bites before going back to his conversation with Natasha.
“Bucky,” Tony warned. He knew how Bucky and Peter could get when they were together. Bucky had a tendency to rile him up more than anything.
“Papa I missed you!” He squeezed him happily, giving a yelp when he felt his Papa’s hand come down on his vulnerable bottom, twice.
“Well if that doesn’t say sorry I don’t know what does,” Bucky said blandly, walking in with a tray full of crackers, tortilla chips and dip along with numerous bottles of water.
Peter threw a beaming smile over to Harley, even more delighted he was here. He picked up the pace and rushed the two of them back to the car, not even protesting when he had to get into his seat even though Harley got to sit up the front. He did blush at Harley’s comment on it though.
Tony beamed up at him as Steve carried him into the kitchen where the rest of the team were having lunch. “Thank you, Alpha.” Steve really was the best.
“Ah yes, for James Stark-Rogers?” She asked looking up. “Is he here, or?” She wasn’t sure who the test was for. She knew that all four of the people in front of her had a classification just by looking at them.
“No. You can do it the old fashioned way and get the followers before you get that little blue tick. And I think Papa will mind but I’m after putting as much protection as I can into it so it won’t be too bad.”
“No uncle Clint, Mama got me these as a joke but they’re really cosy so I like wearing them for my after school sleep. My costume is so much better.”
Tony threw his head back and laughed, he couldn’t wait to tell Steve this. Their sweet innocent Peter was already getting the best of the paps. It was a proud moment for him.
“C’n I call you Jamie, like James but a nickname?” He could see Bucky was thinking about it and really hoped he’d say yes. He loved the name Bucky but he wanted to use his real name as well, or a version of it.
Tony hung up the phone with a huff, that kid would be the death of him. Steve looked over his newspaper and grinned at his husband.
Steve hummed and continued to play with Tony, even as he watched Clint look more and more uncomfortable.
“He’s gonna make you ignore me. Please don’t forget about me.” Peter whimpered. He finally had a Dad, he didn’t want to lose him.
“Peter, how many times have I told you? No playing with your food. You could choke on it!” Tony scolded the boy.
Tony opened his eyes and saw Bucky giving him a level him. He growled slightly, not liking another Alpha in his room during his heat. The sound came out more like a whine than anything else but it did break Bucky’s cold stare and made him grin at Tony. Steve’s laugh from behind him sent little shocks of pleasure through Tony making him moan.
“Hey, I’m Peter’s Dad. I’m here to take Peter out early, he’ll be back Monday.” Tony grinned at the stunned teacher and handed him the note that he was sure needed to go to the office and not to the poor history teacher.
Peter’s eyes widened and he nodded eagerly. He loved secrets. “I think Bucky might be younger than you. We couldn’t approach him about his classification until his other memories came in case he brought the winter soldier with him. It was too risky. It doesn’t look like he did though which is a huge relief. Now we can get him tested and he can finally be himself without trying to hide. The only time I’ve seen him going little is when he’s with you and you coax him into napping with you or playing a game.”
Tony tapped his nose. “You’re forgiven.” Peter smiled and put his head back into his Mama’s neck, not ready to let go yet. Mama didn’t make him either, he just rubbed up and down his back and continued talking to Papa.
“Steve. I-“ Tony couldn’t finish the sentence without choking up. Peter thought that while Tony loved him, he didn’t like him as much as Harley.
The whole wearing a diaper thing was something else he needed to be able to control. He should know when he needed to pee or even poop. That’s not something his mind should forget how to do. He wondered if he would be able to hold it? He hadn’t pooped at all today so he may just wait until he got the urge and hold it until he got to a toilet. If Mama and Dada wouldn’t bring him, he’d sneak away from them and use it. Surely it wouldn’t be too difficult. They’d be super busy with Jamie being so little.
“What?!” Tony demanded, trying to look at the phone while driving but gave up quickly. “What’s it saying?!”
Steve slid out of Tony and saw himself back on the chair, Pulling Tony so that he was sitting on top of him, and slipped his cock back in. “Tony, Bruce needs help with a question.”
“Steve, can you clean Jamie up while I get cleaned up. This isn’t something I can just wait for. Fri, start the bath please.” Tony said, as he was walking out of the room, Jamie let out a wail of displeasure at seeing Mama walk away. Peter felt himself getting a bit teary as well as he watched Mama leave.
Steve and Tony sat together in silence for a minute before Steve’s hand snaked down and wrapped around Tony’s cock.
“Yes, boss. I’m sorry for scaring you, Peter.” Friday sounded sincere enough that she swayed Peter it seemed when he brought his head up from Tony’s neck and smiled up at one of Friday’s sensors.
Tony pretended to think about it. “Hmm, I guess I did. Let’s get back to the car and I’ll see what I can do about that situation. I think Harley might have something for you.”
“Okay. You can have twitter.” He said, putting a hand up when Peter jumped up and let out a whoop. “Under a few conditions though.” Peter promptly sat down, eager to listen to what the conditions might be, hoping for the best but expecting the worst. This was his Dad tough, who was way too overprotective.
Steve, looked up from Tony when the dishwasher beeped, locking eyes with Bucky and nodding. Bucky could take over, Steve’s know would go down eventually and he was half afraid of what Tony would do if he was acting in any way like Clint’s Alpha. Their bond was still new and Omega’s were extremely protective over their Alpha’s for the first few weeks. Steve dreaded to think how Tony would get back at him if he even tried to be an Alpha to Clint. This was best left to Bucky instead.
Steve rolled his eyes at him, “You know what I mean. We can do both of those things without everyone looking at him. He’s exposed this way.”
“It’s nothing. Just that kid flash again, teasing me about being an orphan.” He said dismissively, looking out the window. As much as he disliked the booster seat it did help him watch the scenery, which he loved.
Peter shook as he stared up at Steve, he felt very small compared to Steve’s Alpha size and he couldn’t help but be afraid.
“You ready for this part? You’re going to have an unhappy boy on your hands after it.” Cho said to Tony who simply moved the diaper to the side so she could get it over it.
“Well, it’s just that everyone in my class has it and I never know what they’re talking about with all the jokes going on and then they tease me because I don’t and Ned tries to explain it but keeps saying that unless I see it I won’t get it. I’m not on Facebook, or Instagram or Tumblr or even snapchat and I get why.” He hastened to say when he saw his Dad open his mouth to argue. “I do get it, Mama. I couldn’t have one cause of the whole keeping me secret thing but now after the whole field trip thing, you said that it was time to make the world aware of who I am. Wouldn’t this way be easier than a press conference? They could get used to me on twitter first and then when you think they’re ready you can organise a conference.” Peter looked down at his hands while he asked, afraid to look his Dad in the eyes in case it was a hard no. After what felt like an eternity he heard his Dad sigh.
Steve smiled as Jamie played with his fingers, seemingly to be content in the wrap that was around his chest that Mary had helped him with, while they waited for Tony. She assured him that the wrap wouldn't start bothering his back until after they got a stroller, but this would better. Steve wasn't complaining. He got to watch Jamie up close, watch her peer around in curiosity while she held onto his shirt, and reach out for something when he got too close.
“He’s currently in a meeting,” he told her. He wasn’t sure if Tony had told Pepper exactly where he was going yet. “He should be almost done. What’s wrong?”
“Did you think that perhaps it’s what they wanted?” Howard growled back, lowering his voice. “That maybe they were just too damn stubborn to come out when I tried? That when they knew that Steve went missing they were going to stay there until he came back?”
"Through all of that, how did your suit not wrinkle?" Steve asked as they walked out into the hallway. "You were holding onto a less than still Peter, rolling around on the bed, then in the chair. How do you still look this good?" Steve willed himself not to blush at his choice of words.
“There’s uh, there’s a dirty joke in, in there.” Tony’s words were a little jumbled as he closed his eyes, letting Steve do most of the leading. “M’head.”
"After Fury's meeting we can run it," Bruce continued, seeing the fatigue set in on Tony. It was obvious that the man hadn't slept since he woke up for the day of the Expo. "How's Peter?" He asked quietly. Tony gave him a sad smile and Bruce nodded.
"Only about ten minutes," Steve told him, kissing his cheek. "She's very quiet," he said with a look down to Jamie. "Jarvis actually had to wake me up, because she just didn't cry."
Steve crouched down, bending his knees, so that he was eye level with Peter, and put out his hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Peter." Steve smiled at the boy, and he got a little smile back, Peter sticking his hand out without hesitation, and shaking Steve's hand, waving it up and down with exaggeration.Steve chuckled, and that caused Peter to giggle, knowing that his action was silly.
“No, I’m sorry, love,” Peggy murmured. “He’s not with us anymore.” The small pokemon seemed to deflate a little, and turned around to slowly walk back over to Tony.
"Right, well, I've got to go check on our resident emo god downstairs." Steve frowned at Tony's words, and Tony realized that Steve didn't know what had happened last night. "I'll fill you in when I'm done, and you can go work out, take a run, make a crap load of breakfast food, whatever it is that super soldiers do." Tony gave a two fingered salute and headed for the door quickly.
The elevator ride was a little longer than usual, and when the doors opened Peter had taken Steve's hand again and pulled him down a hallway. It was a little chillier down here, and Steve thought that maybe they had gone down to one of the basement levels. Tony was standing at the end of the hallway in front of plain wooden door. There was a keypad, and a hand scanner, as a lock though.
His hands were chained in front of him, and his chest and legs were bound, not that tightly he noticed, to the chair he had been propped up in. There was a hiss as part of the glass swung out, and someone was walking in. A familiar face as of recent for Tony.
Tony closed his eyes tightly, willing back all those dark thoughts that usually followed. Peter was a happy boy, he was well-behaved. What if Peter suddenly became rebellious? Locking up the sadness and anger that his Mama wasn't around? He'd take it out on Tony, and Tony wouldn't know how to properly deal with that situation, and Peter would end up hating him. Tony couldn't take that if that happened. It would be worse than dying if Peter ended up hating him.
Peter was the first to activate his, and as the sound effects started, blue light shot out, and Steve’s and Peter’s eyes were widening almost comically. Tony was grinning like a kid at Christmas. Steve pressed his button and he felt the small force of motion as green light shot out of his. As he took a close look though, he saw that the light was held captive in a thin clear cylinder. “Those are custom, and as close to a real light saber as we’re going to get. For now. Until I actually put effort into inventing one,” Tony said watching them. Peter started to gently wave his back and forth in the air, and it even made the sound of a light saber moving, the gentle hum and swish. “They’re not dangerous, but can be used in light saber battles. The fabricated plastic that contains the light it about as durable as my Iron Man suit, and it drops back down like a net when deactivated, and it shot up with a shot of compressed air from inside.”
"We're back!" Tony called out, but it was Peter that greeted him first, running into the kitchen and throwing his arms around Steve's waist in a hug. Steve chuckled and picked him to plant little kisses on his cheeks.
"Hey, baby," she smiled, kissing the top of his head as she walked over. As Steve's front door swung shut, he saw a red headed woman walking by, towards the exit of the apartment. "How's your drawing?"
"Were the changes made to the Expo?" Steve glanced back up at Tony when he heard his voice again. Tony hummed, nodding a little. "Good, make sure there are buses there to make sure people are safe. Let the hospitals know that the jets are available for fast travel if they need medication or anything." Tony turned, and Steve could see his profile, saw the little frown that marred Tony's face. "I have no intention of leaving this house for the rest of today, or tomorrow. And I'll tell you the same thing I told Bruce and Cap this morning; I don't want a party or any kind of celebration. I'll be having pancakes with my son, and then that's that."
"That means I don't have to visit two different floors now," Peter worked out, stopping Tony's speech. "That's gonna be a lot easier, Daddy." Tony let out a little snort, trying to bite back the bubbling laugh. "Yeah, I think it's cool that Mr Steve move in with you." Peter grinned and Tony kissed his head.
Tony took a seat across from Coulson, watching until Peter and William were out of sight. "Did Steve call you?"
"Of course he will baby," Mary said as she pushed some hair off his face. "He always knows where you are." Peter let out a breath of relief and nodded, and went back to playing with the ornament. "But, you'll need to go to sleep soon, cause you know he won't come if you're still awake." As if on que, Peter yawned, leaning his head against Tony's shoulder. Tony smiled, taking the ornament back and putting it back on the tree.
Tony heard the others starting to talk and took a breath. The sooner this was over, the better. He could get a new element made, Jarvis could direct Bruce to set it in the new arc reactor casing, and run tests while Tony found Peter.
Tony had powered on his tablet about twenty minutes into Peter's story time, hearing him start to talk about what happened on the Hellicarrier, and how he had met the real Captain America. Tony wasn't exactly waiting for a reminder of the past day’s events, and he knew he could get some work done as well. He knew the Press had to be chomping at the bits for information, or blood.
"Still working on it." His sensors registered movement behind him, and figured that it was just Cap and Widow. He changed his mind when a bullet slammed against his back. Tony dodged out of the way as he turned around and saw four people filing out of the next building, dressed in black, pistols in their hands, but Tony could identify semi-automatics on their backs. "We've got company! Armed, obviously protecting the device."
Little 6 year old Tony pulled a chair over to the tall case, his own skeleton key in his pocket, and he picked the lock. The top was a little heavy for him to open, but he was able to push it up, then prop it open. Inside he saw lots of papers and books. A lot of them looked like the comics that he already had up in his room. There were some brown leather books, and file folders that looked official; like those that his Dad used when he was dealing with the military. He pushed those aside, not interested in that. Was this box really this boring?
"What did you do to me?" He ground out, moving his eyes to look at the dark haired girl. Her own eyes were wide, the red fading. Then it turned into a sickening grin.
Steve lifted his eyes to glance at Tony, then back down to the tablet. Tony wasn't going to push, he was too tired to figure it out if Steve wasn't going to-
"Well, now that you're staying here, I'm sure we can find something for you to do," Tony said. Maybe there would be the added benefit of Steve staying around the Tower. Tony grabbed two mugs and started to pour the sweet treat for them. "If you haven't eaten, there's left overs in the fridge-"
"So before you go thinking that I just got you a regular, future looking, pen, let me explain it." Tony stepped forward, motioning for Steve to pick up the pen. He noticed on the side was a piece of plastic, or glass, almost like the screen of his Starkphone. "This is something I've been working on for a bit, and I feel like I've got it to the point where other people can try it. I know that you and Peter like to draw, so may I introduce to you the most advanced drawing tool in your arsenal." Steve looked up at Tony with a raised eyebrow.
"Hey." Tony's voice caught his attention back to the present. Mary was holding onto Peter now, trying to tickle him. "So, I was thinking maybe you could, maybe, bring some stuff up here? Like, a couple sets of clothes, a toothbrush?" Steve felt Tony shuffle his foot a little on the ground.
"Let her in, for the love of science!" Tony exclaimed, trying to push all the batter from the counter into the bowl.
"Steve! You crazy bastard! Oh my gods!" She shrilled out, and even Tony winced a little, unmuting his line.
The highway that Meg was on was coming into view and he was searching for the car. The smoke was probably a dead giveaway to their location. Curving down and to the right, Tony made his body like a missile to get there as quickly as possible. Jarvis zoomed in to show two people pulling Meg out of the car, kicking and flailing and generally making it hard for them.
“Tony!” The door slammed over and Steve was running in, Peter in his arms. “Tony, are you alright??” Peter jumped from Steve’s arms and wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck, hugging him tightly. Tony’s eyes widened marginally as he looked at Steve, looking frazzled, and then at Bucky as he ran in, then saw Meg.
“So next time, we bring someone else?” Steve asked, and Tony could hear that he was following behind him. “False pretenses of enjoying some time off, then we foist the kids on them?”
Strange almost looked apologetic. “I’ll do what I can.” Steve’s shoulders deflated a little. “Head down the hall, I’ll lead you back to your Tower at least. I’ll take you vehicles in as well.” Steve nodded a little and turned. He briefly leaned down, using one hand to grab his shield, and let it slide onto his back before gripping onto Tony again.
"Because I'm right?" Tony ventured with a smile. He could practically feel Bruce's eyes rolling from his seat. Peter had exchanged the notebook and the empty plate on Tony's legs, the plate now balancing on Tony's thighs. He was too comfy to move from being blanketed by Tony's legs, and Tony wasn't about to give up his position with his son.
"I think we're lucky to have made it that far," Steve said as he balanced the plate on his hand, and slid the small dish of beignets on his forearm, and the individual portion of the clafouti next to that. He knew that Tony wouldn't grab his own plate of the small doughnuts, but he smiled when Tony grabbed his own dish of the clafouti. The man really did have a weakness for blueberries.
“There had better air conditioning in this outfit,” Steve grumped out eventually. He heard a squawk of delight and Tony side stepped to show Jamie on the bed. She had on a kind of orange poncho, with fur on its head, and two round ears. “You turned her into an Ewok.”
“Papa?” Peter asked, and Steve looked over to see his big eyes. “Something’s wrong.” Steve nodded a little, and he unlocked the doors, climbing in the driver’s.
“I made some friends out there, and I found a groove,” Steve continued like Tony hadn’t said anything. But suddenly Tony was smirking.
"A little ostentatious, don't you think?" All gold? Really? The all silver had been pushing it, but it was just the testing model.
"Hey, Mary, can I ask you a question?" Steve grabbed the punching bag to stop it from swinging, looking at Mary who was next to him. The SHIELD training room was generously supplied, and they had put up some special equipment just for Steve, stuff that he couldn't break as easily. Or at least very often.
Tony reached up underneath his shirt, twisting the palladium reactor until it clicked. He let out a light gasp, closing his eyes a little, then pulled it out. He set it down on the counter, then reached the new one under and slipped it into place. He could feel a different resonance with this reactor. Tony turned it, hearing a low click, but not the one he needed. Tony frowned, brought his hand back out, then punched his chest with the heel of his hand. Bruce jumped a little until he saw the glow of the reactor.
“I’m happy staying like this for a while,” Steve told him, glancing over Tony’s shoulder to see Peter and Jamie, faces relaxed in the sleep. “At least Peter’s mouth isn’t open yet.”
Jarvis may have played the sounds of crickets. Tony frowned and made a motion towards Jarvis’s cameras in the ceiling. “Hang on.” He lifted his arm, seeming to bite it and Steve was taking a step towards him. “No, no, I got this.” He slammed his palm against his arm, hearing a couple of clicks and a buzz. “There we go, that should work.” He tried it one more time, and everyone was watching Tony.
"Sir?" Jarvis' voice was a bit quieter, but Peter just turned into his chest, still asleep. "Miss Rosenfeld has been discharged and is currently enroute to the Tower."
Steve gave him an unimpressed frown, hand trying to cover Jamie’s ear. “We got back about fifteen minutes ago,” he told him, then paused a little. “And the clothes helped. We just pretty much didn’t wear any-“ Bucky made a face, clearly screaming ‘TMI’, “-then took a few long baths.”
“Ah, yes, well,” Tony nodded a little. “Peter asked if he could call Steve Papa, like Jamie is going to grow up doing. It was all very sweet, and Steve cried a little.” Pepper raised an amused eyebrow at him, smile quirking at her lips. “Okay, fine, I cried a little, too, but only because he was. It was all Peter’s idea, really. And Steve swears that he heard Peter agreeing that Jamie is his sister.” Pepper’s brows went up. “I know! I don’t know what happened, but I’m not about to argue with it, for once.”
"I'm working on that, actually," Tony said. It wasn't just the earth that the arc reactor was dangerous for. "There was the large one back in Malibu, and that generated power, and it was safe enough to be near. And if I can make this in a cave, who's to say that I can't make another one that can generate enough energy to power a building, and eventually a city block in New York, or even an entire city?"
"I think you are, buddy," Tony said, shifting Peter in his arms so he was laying on Tony's chest. Peter nodded a little, closing his eyes, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck, head still pillowed on Tony's shoulder.
“I think you’re a little late,” she said with a breathless chuckle, leaning back a little to cup his cheek with her hand. “Still as handsome as ever.” She smiled when Evelyn pushed her head in between them. “Yes, I see you as well, Evelyn. Decided to leave Anthony at home today, then?” Peggy raised an eyebrow when she felt Steve tense a little, and Evelyn cooed lowly. “I sense a story….”
He heard the piano playing as he came up the stairs, and knew that Obie had been there for a little while. Tony almost froze when he saw one of Peter's stuffed animals underneath the couch, but it was hidden, mostly; nothing was peeking out.
Taking a deep breath through his nose, Tony nodded and went into his room. He put Peter down on the middle of the bed, and quickly changing his clothes. Tony moved the blankets, pulling Peter over to him, running his fingers through Peter's hair a little, Peter's hand instinctively resting on his arc reactor. "Merry Christmas, kiddo," he said softly. "I'm glad you're here." Tony bit back a yawn and closed his eyes.
"I've got Peter," Tony said, looking back over at his little boy. His excited, smiling little boy, who had just a private art room, all to himself. His little boy that he was going to have to tell that his Mama wasn't going to be coming back for a little while, that she was sleeping, and it was going to be hard to wake her up. Tony never wanted any of these horrible things to happen to his son.
"We'll see you soon." Steve nodded at him, and Tony made himself walk away first, heading back over to Bruce and the car.
"No, no no, no," she cut him off. "I don't have any more room in my house, and I think that Tony is going to start to notice when you and Mary keep spending so much money."
Steve had looked through all the clothes he had brought, kicking himself that he didn't bring anything that he thought would be nice enough for a press conference. Not that that was anything he ever thought he have to prepare for, but he didn't want to go in jeans, or khakis, but he wasn't seeing much of another choice.
"He's using a Starkphone, and I'm collecting data on it," Tony said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "He just accessed the music player,... Hang on, if he insists on listening to this stuff...." Tony trailed off, opening his own music files and slipping a few songs into Steve's playlist, letting the song from his sons current favorite movie play first. "I will get him to listen to good music, even if I have to slowly replace every song."
Tony was already stepping inside of the elevator. "I'll be down in the workshop, Jarvis can keep an eye on me down there." The doors were closed before Mary could get to him. She let out a sigh, resting her hands on top of her head.
"No need to sneak that in, it's true and you know it." Tony kissed her knuckles a little. The red head looked unimpressed, but didn't pull her hand away. "You're also the best chance we have at pulling Barton away from Agent's room. He'll try to hide away in there."
“I, uh, I’m not very creative with names,” Tony mumbled a little. “Jolteon will be Citrine, Flareon will be Ruby, and Vaporeon will be Aquamarine….”
A familiar black and white opening started and Steve couldn't help but grin, a little giggle bubbling out. He looked over at Tony and saw him also smirking, but watching the screen. "I'm sure this has nothing on the original on the big screen, Cap, but try to humor us and enjoy it." Steve leaned back, putting his feet up on the coffee table, making a better surface for Tony's legs, and smiled as they watched The Wizard of Oz. And Steve and Tony choked back their snorts at the first time the flying monkeys showed up.
“I could have told you that,” Tony said with a snort. He had started to assemble the sandwiches, cutting crusts off for Peter and Wade. “It told me as much, that it was trying to help.” Loki and Strange watched him intently, waiting for all the information that he had. “It was trying to hide me from the Big Bad. And then when you showed up, it tried to stop you, but that’s because it didn’t know that you were trying to help. I think it was because He was there at the same time.”
“You think this has something to do with Wilson?” Steve nodded grimly at Tony’s question. “Be careful, take a comm unit.” Steve leaned down to kiss him quickly, then kissed the top of Peter’s head. “Pops is gonna find Wade.”
"Like a cat to milk." Tony turned to face her. "But you're not here to talk about Steve." She shook her head and they headed back down the hall. "I can tell you that you're not going to get much out of me, not if you want to ask me what happened."
"Money can buy good music." Steve snorted softly, shaking his head with a smile. "But since they're getting married so quickly, I'll have to work quickly to make a good music list for them."
"Peanut butter comes off with soap, right?" Tony asked as he walked over to the sink, touching his wrist to the faucet to start the water.
Phil caught Tony in the elevator on his way down to Bruce's lab the next morning. They nodded to each other. "We gathered a protection detail around the city, and we have vetted agents searching for any hints on where Hydra, or Strucker, might be now."
"Yeah, probably don't feel very happy with a group of bad guys, huh?" Steve said to her, wrinkling his nose happily when she put two of his fingers in her mouth. "My hands probably don't taste very good, and you just ate half an hour ago." Steve shivered a little he felt something warm press against the back of his neck.
As soon as he walked in, he could see that Mary and Meg were trying to put as much space between them and the boys as possible. Bucky looked like he was ready to put a window and a few hundred feet between him and Steve.
"Hey, you can pull yourself up now!" Tony smiled. "I know you were working on that last time, good job!" Tony didn't see Mary peek her head out of the kitchen. "I mean, I don't mean to brag, but I was already doing that before I turned one, too. Chip off the ol' block." Tony smiled as Pete turned towards him, letting go of the table, putting his hands out towards Tony. "Are you trying to show off for me now? Alright, come on, show me what you've learned," Tony said, putting his hands out, palms up, for Peter.
"Yeah, I know, I heard all about it." Tony had donated to the clean up, and subsequently kept military eyes off of Bruce long enough for him to make his escape. Brice didn't need to know that though. "I can get you in without anyone seeing, and I've got a place for you to stay where no one will even suspect you to be."
"Before," Tony told him, looking up at him. "I don't want to risk sleeping in, and not getting up before Peter." He didn't mention that if he tried to sleep, the nightmares would come, and at least after he woke up, he could decompress downstairs. "You should get some sleep, too. It's late."
"Just a little shaken, wants to see his Daddy." Tony nodded to Mary's words as she stepped aside to let Tony go through the door. Peter was sitting on the little couch, and nearly flew off of it when Tony walked in.
"I think Wade has a crush on Peter," Steve declared. Tony's nose wiggled a little, and one eye twitched. "You already know that Peter has a crush on him."
Bucky looked back at Tony at that. "They're getting ready to move her from the hospital, staff is clean." He went to slide out of the booth and Tony quickly raised his leg to stop his progress. Bucky glared at Tony.
Tony started to wash all the dishes, something he could easily do without needing to take off his sunglasses. Maybe he would make a custom pair of sunglasses that he could wear that acted like the Iron Man HUD. He would be able to watch Steve without actually looking at him, he wouldn't have to try and do stuff looking through darker lenses just because Steve had decided to intrude.
"Uh," Tony glanced around, wincing when he moved his shoulder. "I was working on the suit, but I messed up the calibrations on the assembly unit. Just wanted to run some tests." He glanced down at his arm, saw the angry red of the wire burn. "Put it into manual mode and hopped in."
“I did!” Steve exclaimed with mischievous grin. “You get the cherry, I get the first taste of cream.” Steve stuck his finger in his mouth, keeping eye contact with Tony, slowly sucking the whip cream from his finger. Tony let out a little growl, leaning forward on the table as he slipped the cherry in his mouth, stem included. He then pulled the stem out, knotted.
"Yeah, well, the sacrifices we all have to make sometimes," Tony muttered. "If I wasn't so sure that they wanted to make an army of my suits, I would have done this sooner.. I just want to see my son, again." Rhodey wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders now. "Phone calls just aren't cutting it, anymore. And I keep running into The Neighbor whenever I go stalk the playground."
"The arrow had no fletching, thin and made of metal," Steve told him, his voice soft. "It went right through your shoulder. Bruce says you didn't lose much blood, though." Tony slid his eyes to the side to look at Steve. He looked a mess, he looked tired, and so damned sad.
"Oh, all the blame, on you," Tony said with a nod. "Your genes running through her. Literally, just yours. She'll probably have a penchant for throwing round things, too." Steve snorted, rolling his eyes. "Ouch, I felt that Sass."
"That's exactly what we don't need right now," Tony groaned and Mary nodded. "Did you ever meet Julie's ex-husband?" Mary shook her head no. "Welp, that's good."
No amount of apologies can begin to express how sorry I am to have made all of you wait. I got a new job, and I was putting in 45+ hours a week. Apple Farms are Fun, but busy. Then I was house/pet sitting for some friends, and at that time my laptop decided that the internal keyboard, and usb keyboard don't want to work completely for me. I've still got some keys that don't work, so I have to use three keyboards to type. >.
When Tony made his way back to Steve and Peter he saw that Bruce had found them as well, sitting in a chair, Peter in his lap this time. The boy was looking even more tired and Tony knew that it was time to go home. Tony could deal with the rest at home, when Peter was asleep, tucked away safely in blankets where Tony could see him.
"Well, like, that assassin from almost two weeks ago now," Tony prompted. "Haven't seen hide nor hair of him since then. If he really was tasked to kill me, then why stop?" Steve hummed in thought, nodding his head a little bit. "There have been plenty of other times to get me, and he's obviously did his homework if he figured out a way to get inside and shut down Jarvis, even if it was for a couple of minutes." Tony's fingers started to play with the bottom of his jeans. "And that group, with the disruptor, something just seems off about that whole thing." And whatever Loki's scepter did to me, he thought to himself. "I don't like when things don't make sense."
"You saved her," Steve told him, pulling back a bit to look in his eyes. "You could have run, left her there." Tony gave him an offended frown. "Doesn't change the fact that you saved her. You didn't do what they were forcing you to do."
"She won't wake until after I leave," Loki interrupted, and Steve found himself wrapping an arm around Tony's waist to keep him from launching at Loki. "It's the nature of the spell, and I cannot change it."
"Where's the best spot for fireworks this year, Tony?" Mary asked as she finished off the last of her water before the glass was taken to be washed.
"You're not allowed to judge me, Spangles," Tony called out to him. The other kids had left him alone, hearing the whistle, and wanting to get some last bounces in the bouncy house before having to go home. Tony didn't feel bad at all for loading them up with sugary cake, getting them hyper, then sending them home with their parents. Not one bit.
No! He wouldn't go back to the cave! Tony coughed when his head was shoved down into the cold water, his lungs burning for needed air. He had escaped! He had destroyed that place!
The receptionist typed something in the computer, and Tony knew what was coming. "I'm sorry, Sir, but I don't see-"
“We’ll help him,” Steve said as they stepped out onto the MedBay floor. “Whatever he needs.” Tony leaned his head in slightly to kiss his arm, nodding.
“Yeah.” Tony went over and sat next to Jamie, gently so as not to wake her yet. “How long has Little Miss been asleep?”
“If you hadn’t of turned that last one into something about yourself, I would have been worried,” Mary said. “Would have thought that you hit your head or something in Disneyland.”
"Good girl, I'm proud of you." Was he really doing this right now? "I'd be prouder still if you were dancing." Apparently he was doing this. Mary really should have expected it, especially after calling him George for two weeks after they watched '
"You're going to stay with me," Tony told him. "You know how my house is really big?" Peter nodded. "Well, I'm gonna have Mama stay there until she wakes up. That way you, Jarvis, and I can watch over her. It's family that knows best, isn't it? We know what Mama needs."
Iiiii may have been mistaken, I did not make it through the rest of Iron Man 1 in this chapter. Next chapter for sure, but Peter was demanding a lot of attention this chapter, and well, how can you say no to him? I'm having fun with this story, and apparently so is everyone else!
"Well," Julie cut him off with a smile, "to say I misjudged you would be an understatement. Bonus point when you didn't come over with a Non-Disclosure Agreement for us to sign."
“Not discounting the romantic getaway that he took you on,” Bucky mumbled loudly, setting up a puzzle table for the twins.
"That's cheating," Tony pointed at him, making his way around to the driver’s seat. "It's cheating and you know it."
"There are so many things wrong with that last sentence," Rhodey said, hanging his head, causing Tony to grin. "And one day, you'll have to call him by his real name."
"I don't see much room for you," Tony said under his breath and came out, closing the door. He peeked out the window to see the man she had been talking too walking down the sidewalk. "Does your neighbor drop off food with only one usable arm?"
Steve smiled at him. "Jamie Antonia Rogers." Tony's eyes widened a little. "Well, she wouldn't be here if it weren't for her Daddy." He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, pressing his forehead against Steve's.
“Shit,” Tony whispered. “Okay, Steve, it’s okay. Jarvis, get the bath going, give us some hot water.” His eyes widened when he saw frost start to appear in his hair. “Steve?” Steve’s head drooped down, his body slumping even further towards the floor, dragging Tony with him. “Steve! Come on baby, say something.” He watched as Steve’s eyelids closed, his breathing getting slower as his body started to freeze. “No, no, no, Steve.” Tony moved his hands up to cup Steve’s cheeks.
"Can't wait," he said, and finding he really meant it. "I'll talk to Pierre and Marcello, and we'll all have a big family dinner."
“No, actually I looked online.” Tony’s brow wrinkled. “PR called me, since we were monitoring anyway for backlash to-“
Neither of them talked for a bit, letting Tony play a little louder, his shoulders, then his body starting to move with the song. Steve could see years of lessons, probably decades of playing, deeply ingrained his technique. “What are you playing?”
"Let me go Rogers- Pepper?" He blinked, hand reaching up to grab the phone before it fell from his ear. Steve turned him around, setting him back on his feet and Tony started walking down the hall, talking to Pepper. Steve let out a little breath, before turning to look back at the woman by the bedroom door.
Jamie cooed in his arms and he took off her hat, tucking it into his back pocket, no longer under the rays of the sun. “She likes it, too,” Peter said, looking up at them. “I told you she was getting smarter.”
"Okay," Steve said, letting his punches become a little harder, seeing that Tony could take it without being pushed backwards by the force. "I talked to Bruce, about his past research, with your Dad, er, Howard."
"I'd like to say yes," he started, drawing her eyes over to his face. "But, I guess I'm still digesting it myself. I mean, I've been Iron Man for several years now, but that doesn't mean that I can just accept everything that happens. None of it's normal, even in my eccentric life. The most I had to worry about at once point was hoping that my baby son wouldn't throw up on me."
Tony had stood up, and he walked over to shake Mary's parents hands, her mother still giving him the evil eyes as he did. "Pleasure to see you both again."
The drink had Tony's desired effect; lulling Steve to sleep. He hadn't known that the blonde would fall asleep with his head practically in Tony's lap though. Tony almost drifted to sleep as he ran his fingers through Steve's hair, keeping him asleep until the sun came up in the morning. When Jarvis turned off the TV, Tony gently moved the super soldier's head from his thigh back onto the couch, making sure the blanket he threw over him didn't fall off, and got to work getting breakfast, (cereal), ready for Peter.
“He doesn’t want you to think that he’s replacing you though. Told him he needs to talk to you about it.” Vee trotted behind them as Pepper dragged Tony’s drunk ass up to his master bathroom. “What do you think, Evelyn?” Vee liked it that Pepper always used her proper name, much like Peggy Carter had. Vee was something just for Tony and Steve to call her. “Well, I suppose it’s something to think about. Maybe soon the work load won’t be as full, he’ll be able to spend more time here with you.”
"This may seem weird, or forward, but can I interest you in having lunch with me?" Steve asked, trying to sound confident, but pretty sure that he came off as awkward. "I mean, then we could continue talking about music? Maybe you could add to my playlist, give some suggestions."
"You just saw me last week," Peter giggled, grinning up at him. "Daddy, if Mama says it's okay, can we stay at my place?"
"I've got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute." Tony shot up, getting underneath the missile. He hated nukes. "And I know just where to put it." Tony knew what was coming, of course he did, but it didn't make it any easier.
"No one catch your eye? No one's asked you out for today? Because I know a few dozen people who'd want to take you out on Valentine's Day." Tony wouldn't mention that he might have been one of them. You know, if he wasn't taking care of his son when Tony was still capable. Not. Jealous.
His eyes widened and lifted his arms before trying to swim back up to the surface. Just because he didn’t swim anymore, didn’t mean he didn’t know how too. Tony felt more in control then the last time he found himself in water, and started kicking his feet. His body continued falling in a downward motion though, and the waves were fading away, the light of the moon growing dimmer. But, he could still see the pinpricks of the stars in the sky.
Peter looked at the drawing, his eyes widening. "That's us!" Tony grinned, holding onto his son as they looked at the picture frame. The other had gotten up to come look at it, and Tony wanted to preen like a bird for Steve's sake. Steve had deemed him and Peter important enough to draw, and with so much detail. "That looks just like us Daddy!"
“Toooony gave you permission.” She smiled at him, and Steve felt the blush creeping up his neck again. “Oh, that, that right there is totally a thing. Is there a story? I want a story, Steven. Last I was aware, you had been avoiding Tony, and now you have a place to stay right here in his Tower.” Mary gave him a knowing look. “I want to know how that happens. I heard what you two said to each other on the Hellicarrier.” Steve looked away, and Mary could practically see the shame crawling all over him.
Maybe he was relaxing a bit too much when he had the sensation of floating, leaving the chair. His head lolled back and he took a deep breath through his nose. Then lights flashed through his eyelids and he opened them then. He bit back a gasp when he saw the darkness of space, specks of lights of the stars, staring back at him. He had literally started floating, out in space.
"They're trying to recreate a Serum," Tony bit out, back to looking at the equations. Equations that were turning into formulas. Bruce had included the samples taken from the animals several months ago, and compared them to the sample. Tony could practically feel Steve's dark look, and was glad it wasn't actually being directed at him. "They're trying to make an army, and the fastest way to do that, is through cloning."
“Hmmmm,” Steve rumbled a little. “I need a break, and so do you. I’ve already cleared it with Mary and Phil, and even Bucky’s gonna pitch in. Of course Rachel and William will be more than happy to spoil the kids while we’re gone.”
Tony heard the soothing voice in his ear, felt the pain in his chest, his lungs, but it had receded to a burning pain, no longer crippling. He was in New York. Not the cave. Not the cold darkness of space. "-party. Peter is in his bedroom with Wade, they're both safe." Tony almost let out a choked sob of relief at the sentence. "You're safe, Tony." He dragged in uneasy breaths, feeling his chest constricting, pain, finding it hard to pull in a breath, but there was air coming in this time, instead of water. Tony was pretty sure, by the way that his throat burned, that he had coughed up as much water as he could.
"I've already tried to tell him that it's a bad plan," Steve said. "I said that he should just call up the Zoo, and try to get a private day for his birthday."
“From what he told me, it was both their ideas, so I don’t think there was much ‘roping in’ involved,” Bucky defended, himself mostly.
"I've got to go get my son, soon," Mary said and Steve turned to face her now. "I want you to have all the time you need to process-"
"You know I wouldn't do that," Steve said evenly. "But, would you forgive yourself is something happened while he was around?" Tony clenched his jaw, drawing in deeper breaths. "Soon enough, everything is going to be too much for you to keep hiding. Your walls are going to break, and you'll hate yourself."
He pointed a finger at her. "You're getting good." She smiled innocently at him. "You're trying to get me to talk."
“Ah, Jamie!” Steve sat up and took her hands gently. “No, no, baby, we have to keep that on.” She looked at him with big blue eyes. “Nope, that’s the rule, we all have to wear underwear.” Tony coughed into his hand and he looked away. Steve raised an amused eyebrow at him. “Everyone under twenty has to wear underwear, at all times.”
"What? Pander to Tony Stark?" Rhodey grinned as he grabbed some other ingredients. "Should probably make a little snack, too, for when Peter wakes up."
“You’d think he was excited about something!” Steve laughed with him, the two men following him. “What did Pepper want? Media backlash we didn’t expect?”
Tony squeezed his hand and looked back over at him. "Come on, we should try and figure it out where Peter put us. Dinner is definitely going to be interesting."
"When can you put a blanket or pillow in?" Steve asked as he walked over to the crib that must have been brought in while he was taking a shower.
Tony was able to ignore the horrible thought in the back of his head since the first time that he saw Captain America, in the flesh. At least until the battle was over, and Loki was in custody.
The envelope had Steve's named printed on it, and the back was lightly sealed. It looked like Tony had held onto it for a bit, the corners looking a little worn. Steve opened it and pulled out a thick piece of card stock, a couple of lines of words and numbers printed on it. He raised his eyebrows a little and looked at Tony, who had started to wring his hands a little.
As soon as Tony had popped the reactor back into place he was moving over to the hologram. He raised it up and looked at it. "The Unisphere, here," he pointed to the giant globe in the middle, "it's the nucleus." Tony pointed and the center lit up. "Lose the footpaths, the shrubbery, landscaping, all that, parking lots, entrances and exits." Tony flicked his fingers, things disappearing from the model.
"Nonsense, this is my job, and I'm happy to do it." She gave him a smile, and Steve felt his lips turn up a little at the corner. "If you feel like it, you're welcome to come over after I pick up Peter. I'm sure that his father has promised him some type of desert after dinner, and I'll have to deliver on it. I haven't eaten, and I know you haven't either, so you can come and eat." She wanted to take it easy, didn't want to overwhelm him, and Steve felt comfortable with her, and he wanted to begin to trust her. "I know it might be a lot, and that my son will be there-"
"He's with Coulson," Steve told him. He had seen them sitting in the cafeteria. Tony looked at him, eyes manic. Tony wouldn't be reassured until he saw his son, he knew that, and he couldn't blame him. "Come on." He grabbed Tony's arm and pulled him out in the hall. Steve needed to grab his shield, and he could grab them some com ear pieces.
"I don't need it, though. I have a roof over my head with working heat and running water, I'm good."
Vee hopped onto Peggy’s bed, and Peggy gave a little delighted hum, scratching her ear with her nails. “Espy. Espeon.” She looked over as the lovely purple Espeon walked into the room as well, Steve right behind her.
"But, that would have stayed dormant inside a normal person," Tony leaned in. He knew Bruce had thought of this as well. "What would have happened if you added that to someone that already had an active Serum in their bloodstream." Like Steve, or a clone of his.
He spit the mouthwash into the sink. "Mary's entertaining her today, and Coulson will be with our meeting."
"Upset that your AI is starting to take after you?" Tony looked over as Rhodey walked down the hall, over to his friend. "Consider this a warning, for what Peter might be like."
Tony looked at Steve, and wrinkled his nose as he smiled. Steve smiled back then leaned in to kiss him over Peter. “Ewwwww.” Steve laughed when Tony groaned as Peter made a face at them kissing so close to him.
“I don’t want your money, Tony,” she told him, looking him in the eye. “I didn’t come to try and stronghold you into anything.”
"What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?" Tony tried his hardest to get an easy flow to his voice, to not have pure hatred drip from his tone. It would have all been directed at Loki, but Tony felt a little bit of animosity towards the good Captain himself as well.
“Loki is behind you,” she growled in retaliation, her and Barton repositioning their weapons, pointed towards his face too close for comfort.
“Peter, let me get some plates and forks!” Steve cried out in the kitchen and Pepper shot a look at Tony, who was trying not to giggle.
Tony had sent Steve a text, along with a new phone for him, saying that a driver would be taking him and Jamie to where Tony would meet them, outside of Manhattan where there would be less of a chance to be seen by the cameras and the tabloids. They probably wouldn't be able to escape the fan on the streets, but that was something they could deal with.
"This is finally the perfect specimen we have been able to create,” Strucker crowed, grinning as he looked at the baby. Tony thought that she couldn't have been older than six months. All he knew was that this couldn't happen, he couldn't do this. "It was a pity that we couldn't have collected a sample of your DNA earlier when you didn't join the fight against the animals, but, this was so much better." His body jerked as he fought against the control, but Strucker didn't notice. Wanda did. "Captain Rogers truly has a gift, and hopefully it wasn't lost with this clone. Don't kill it with the Serum, Stark."
Tony finally nodded and they both slipped out of the car. He pushed his glasses further up his nose, tapping the button on the side to turn them into sunglasses, and let out a little calming breath when he felt Steve take his hand again. He shifted his hand a little, locking their fingers together, and took the first step towards the office building. Tony liked that it was a bigger building, where he could hop in the elevator, and no one would know right away that he was headed to a psychologists office. He looked at all of the names on the plaque just inside the main lobby, and noted that most of the name had PhD’s attached at the end. Maybe he should have taken a better look at the building itself.
"I did too, Mr Stark." Tony could smell coffee coming from under the desk. "Front desk called me with a no show, so I came down until we could get a replacement." Tony glanced at his watch and Todd grimaced. "No replacement either."
"Tony?" The female voice sounded very hesitant, quiet, and possibly a little shaken. Something was wrong.
"I'm thinking powerful weapons that we don't want to see out there." Tony flew out and zipped over to the other side, looking at the people who were still at their cars. "Everyone needs to back their vehicles up, get out of here!" Some of the people murmured as they looked at him, then back to the fighting on the other side. "It's not safe here, time to get a move on!" He waved his arms and the people started to move, getting back in their cars.
The song that Tony was singing. Just, uh, imagine it slower, and like it was done acoustically. Romantic like.... :D
"Okay." This was going to stop now. He aimed his repulsors and shot from both hands. The machine needed to be-
"I'm not actually sure," Steve said uneasily. "I haven't had a chance to ask him that. Like I said, I don't know much, but I know that he wasn't under any orders to attack you." Tony's expression screamed 'Is that supposed to make me feel better?' "He was trying to make sure that AIM, and Hydra, didn't finish their Serum or other experiments."
"You're in there, though, I know it." Steve walked closer to him, stopping just before his touched the couch. "If you were the weapon that Hydra was using you to be, you wouldn't be here right now. You wouldn't being protecting those three," he motioned back towards the bedroom.
Steve took a few extras turns, trying to lose any tails they might have gotten, before he hit the bridge to Manhattan and took a straight shot for the garage in the Tower. Jarvis had opened the garage doors just enough for Steve to slip in, before they were closing and locking again. He stopped the bike and was bringing Wade close to his chest again and slipping off, sliding to his knees to hold onto the boy.
Once inside Steve moved immediately to Jamie, unable to resist picking her up. She woke up gently, sleepy eyes looking up at him. She cooed softly, turning in his arms and closing her eyes again. Steve let out a breath, feeling his body relax with her now in his arms.
"That must have been interesting, to hear what Howard had to say," Steve commented. He had probably meant for it to be an innocent sentence. Tony had been avoiding this very topic since he found out that this was Captain America, and he himself had inadvertently brought them directly there. Tony made a decision.
“I take offense to that.” Meg looked at him in silence. “I didn’t disagree with you,” he grumbled. She walked away with a small smirk.
Tony wrinkled his nose and nodded a little. "I'll look this over, read the notes. But, I need to be with my son right now. I was attacked earlier, if you hadn't noticed." Deflect, Tony, that's how Starks do it. Absorb and deflect, don't let them know what you're really feeling inside, they can use it against you.
"I think I'm rotting from the inside out with all the sweetness," Tony said to them. Steve looked at him with an open face of raw happiness, and Jamie took that moment to press her face to his neck, burring her lips as hard as she could. Steve's eyes widened and he yelped in laughter, trying to tuck his head down. "You have the same tickle spot!"
"Always a way out," Steve let out a little chuckle. "You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be someone else's hero."
"No, but usually couples talk about a long-term mission," Coulson threw in, looking down at his phone. Natasha frowned at him.
Tony glanced over when he saw Mary move from her chair, an ugly phone pressed to her ear, looking around. He thought he heard Steve talking at the table next to them. "Has God heard your little prayer? Will Cinderella dance again?" Tony looked over, watching Steve in his chair, smiling, looking over at Mary. Why did those lines sound familiar?
"When did you get here?" Peter asked his grandparents. Steve saw Tony looking at the breakfast plate like it had the answers to the universe on it.
“Yeah we do,” Peter said with a big nod. “School’s gonna start soon, so we have do as much as possible!”
“Stop!” A voice wavered through the pain, as gold and blue lights, energy, clashed around him. Someone else was crying. He knew the voices, the sounds. Tony wanted to reach out, to tell that it would be alright, even though he knew that it wouldn’t. He was being ripped in half, and those that wanted to use him didn’t care what happened to him, not really. “You’re hurting him!”
"Yes in fact, I demand it," Tony said with a grin as he pulled out a long sleeve shirt and some jeans. "I have to regularly feed my ego. It's really for the safety of everyone."
The man looked between Tony and Peter, his gaze lingering on the boy. His arm lowered a little, the gun pointing down now. "Peter, get back," Tony said quietly. "Get back to the stairs."
Hi guys! Long time no see! Sorry!! Unexpected, horrendous, shoulder pain put me out of commission for nearly a week. (I still have twinges) I couldn't type, could barely move, so I'm sorry guys. (I'm behind in my school work too, since, online college and I can't even sit up to actually work at a computer.) I'm good enough to be working for a bit again, and I'm coming back with updates that I missed! The next couple chapters (which will be coming before Tuesday), are going to be good, I hope. Big plans, big plans!
“I am apt to agree with Captain Rogers,” Jarvis piped up and Tony had a look of betrayal on his face. Steve kissed his forehead, turning him around to start walking back to the elevator. “Your working-to-sleep ratio is vastly underperformance, Sir. I would recommend that you get sleep for a minimum of eight hours.”
“Didn’t do anything new, not really.” He shrugged one shoulder once, and Steve was almost wishing that he had gotten there just a few minutes earlier, so he could have been the one to end Wilson. “Kept asking me questions, getting louder and louder. Wanted to know about why we moved, and what Mr Tony was doing.” Steve glanced at his boyfriend, but he kept staring at Wade, keeping his emotions behind a mask. “Wanted to know how to get into the Tower, and stuff like that. The way he was asking though, I think he was planning to hurt everyone.” He sniffled again. “Then, he was pulling out one of his guns. Said that if I didn’t tell what he wanted, he’d hurt you, Mom. He take you, and then he’d hurt you, and I wouldn’t be able to help!”
They hadn’t discovered that it had been Barnes that had killed him until after he was already working with AIM, and breaking away from his conditioning. It seemed that Hilda had her suspicions though. Tony suspected that she wouldn’t be in Italy anymore, and he was fairly certain that she had entered the US again, but she had very nearly disappeared.
"I don't know, that face, and your whining, tells me differently." He propped the tablet up on the dresser as he pulled his shirt off. He did it just to see the little leer on Steve's face. "I have to say that I'm pretty proud of how quickly you've grasped onto the finer points of video chat."
"My family is dead." The admission froze Tony's insides. "I'm going to see them now, Stark." He must have seen the look on Tony's face. "It's okay. I want this," Yinsen nodded a little. "I want this."
“That’s when he found out about Sandy, and Katy?” Steve asked quietly and Peggy nodded. SHIELD had made him believe that an adult Tony had been responsible for it all, not a young child.
Tony flushed the toilet and pushed himself up, carefully, and waiting for his feet to be able to hold him up with having to think about it. Jarvis opened every door that he could along the way, So Tony could keep pulling himself along the wall, pausing when he felt that he might be getting too dizzy, or that his stomach might try to rebel again.
"Yeah," Steve said with a nod. "But I don't really know much about blueprints, and specially the ones that Tony uses. You have your own floor?"
He moved past the boys, not wanting to disturb them, and saw Jamie asleep in her bassinet just inside the living room, where Steve currently was, a sketchbook open on the coffee table. Tony walked over, leaning over the back of the couch to kiss the back of Steve’s neck, but frowned a little when his lips met cold skin. That’s when he noticed that Steve’s body was shaking ever so slightly. “Steve?” He moved to the front of the couch.
Steve looked at the sketchpad, his pencil dragging easy lines across the paper, then he smiled when he looked back up. He was sitting at the end of the bed, Tony laying across the bed, face relaxed in sleep, on his side with one arm under his head, the other splayed out on the bed. Steve’s eyes went back down to the paper, sketching Tony, focusing on the peaceful look on his face.
Someone tried to grab his hands and he pushed back at them. No, he couldn't let this happen, he needed to keep Peter safe! He couldn't protect Mary, he needed to protect Peter!
“I did a lot of soul searching while I was out there in the wild blue yonder.” Steve made a big sweeping arm motion towards the big windows.
"No!" Both Steve and Mary turned to look at him. "No spiders, because that be creepy as hell, Tony," Mary pointed at him, warning him.
"There's a distinct difference in alcoholic drinks," Tony told him. He knew Steve was distracting him, but it was kind of working, so who was he to complain about it. "Beer, champagne, even some wines, much lower alcoholic content. They're overrun with other ingredients, going more for taste. That's what a lot of people appreciate about them, the taste, make you forget that you're drinking something that the kiddos can't have. Just enough to get the dopamine in your head rolling around, make the party just a little bit more fun." He looked back at the amber liquid in front of him. "But this, this is made in a very particular way. Almost like an art form. And there are those out there who drink and appreciate that art, the taste, the way it's made, and aren't alcoholics. Fair game to them."
"Oh, puh-lease, Stark!" She rolled her eyes at him. "They've had a crush on each other since second grade."
"Just, need your help," Tony said, taking her hand, trying to pull himself up. Mary quickly adjusted her position and helped him up, a hand staying on his shoulder when he wobbled a little. "Over on my desk, there's a wooden box." Mary helped him over, sliding him into the chair and pulling over the wooden box. She opened it as Tony reached underneath his t-shirt, with unsteady hands, and slowly unlocked the arc reactor from its casing.
“I’m sorry that I don’t look as grey as some of my other colleagues.” She never lost her pleasant smile, or looked away from Tony. “Would you feel more comfortable with an older gentleman?”
Tony let out a soft breath, giving her a smile. She did a little spin, and the knee length, lace covered, dress flowed out a bit. "Agent is a lucky man, that's for sure."
"Hydra was sending people to watch anyone you had contact with." Steve looked over when Bucky started talking again. "I," Bucky paused for a second. "I remembered her.
Steve frowned a little, sitting in a bit of suspense when Bruce got up to check on his tea, adding a bit of honey to it, and coming back to his seat with the cup cradled in his hands. "I think Howard had been giving up on finding you, it had been a long time, and there was Tony, trying to show off and get his father's attention. He was sure that the Board was going to deny his request to send another team out to search for you, and so he started to come up with a back up plan."
"Good, she's going to need a ride out of there. Hey, Megs!" Tony shouted, hoping to get her attention.
“There’s an outside pool, and an inside pool,” Peter said to Steve as the older man stared out the window. “And Daddy has a path that goes right down to the water, to a secret beach.” Peter was looking over Steve’s shoulder as they came up to the front, the large statue sitting in the round-a-bout.
Tony was wrapping a few things on his computer when he heard Pepper's heels coming down the stairs. He had to go and get Peter from Mary's parents soon, and he really did not want to be late. Mary said that she had a late appointment and Peter wanted to spend the night again, and how could Tony say no when his son wanted to spend time with him.
“There is nothing normal about Tony,” it was William who answered him though. “But, if it makes Peter happy, I’m okay with it.”
"I am sorry for the destruction that was wrought to your Tower, and to this city," Thor said solemnly.
“I’m going to give you three second to head back for the door,” Tony hissed out as soon as Ruby was gone. “You can walk out that door, and we’ll forget this conversation happened.” Steve looked ready to say something else, but Tony let out a soft growl. “I’m not taking the hit of your anger, that’s on SHIELD for not telling you sooner, and it’s not my fault. Now get out.” Tony didn’t wait for him to leave before he turned and stormed out of the room himself.
“The impact is minimal,” Jarvis assured him, bringing up readings. The glass was barely taking a scratch. “The new coating seems to be working according to specifications, Sir.”
Tony stepped out of the door of the Stark Tower. He really should just make it official and name it Avengers Tower, seeing as he left the singular A up at the top. He saw the black town car pulling up to the curb, and smiled. Then everything froze. The others cars in the streets, the walkers on the sidewalk, even the sounds seemed to freeze. He frowned and turned around, still heading for the car. Something wasn't right.
The thing about sunglasses in the 21st century, Steve had come to find out while on an information gathering mission with Mary, is that there are either too many of the same pair, or custom ones for various celebrities, those of importance. This statement could be true for just about anything, but this particular mission, (to get Steve's feet wet with SHIELD), it was easier for them to track the targets purchases, and that included what Steve thought was too many sunglasses. He had seen hundreds of them that day, and now Steve recognized the logo on the side of the sunglasses that Stark was wearing in the picture.
Tony hummed. "Kissing you outside of the gym wasn't enough? Now you want me to actually use your name? Next you're going to tell me that you want to go out on a
"He is," Mary affirmed. "His attention span to things is longer than most toddlers, but he still loves it." She rolled onto her back in her bed now, phone laying on the pillow by her hear, refusing to move from her blankets.
"They're already here." Tony held his breath. "Stark, Loki took Peter." Tony dropped to his knees, all the breath leaving his body. There were hands on him, but he couldn't feel anything, couldn't hear anything else. Peter was gone, taken, and Tony wasn't there. He had promised him, promised that Tony would come back.
"You should know better than to tempt me like that, Rogers." Tony walked towards his bedroom, schematics of Steve's apartment. "I could easily shift the washers downstairs to make room for a gym. It wouldn't exactly be amazing, but it would have a treadmill."
“A vacation without the kids. And not somewhere huge and public, private, just us.” Tony’s hand moved up and down Steve’s chest. “Just think about it. Maybe after the boys start school. I’m sure Granma and Granpa Fitzgerald will be more than happy share babysitting duties with the Buckster.”
"Yeah, I did," he nodded, not wanting to look a Coulson. He knew he would be proven wrong if he looked over, he just knew it. "They won't come around anymore." He kissed the top of Peter's head. "Do you wanna see the room that I built just for you, though? Hmm?" Tony froze a little when he felt little fingers tracing over the black lines of the palladium poisoning on his neck.
"A nuclear deterrent," Tony said breathlessly. He had heard the same argument for years. He had been one of the many people who tried to come up with that solution. "'Cause that always calms everything right down."
"Yeah, there's actually a group put together for coming up with a better name," she admitted. "Tony, why are dancing?"
As far as birthday parties with a dozen kids in attendance went, this one hadn't created as much damage as Tony had thought. Wade was of course glued to Peter's side throughout the party, and then their friends from school were laughing and screaming as they played in the bouncy house and the pool. Tony had hired two professional lifeguards for the pool room, and all the parents who came, (and were invited to stay as well), were delighted to see that. Mary had mentioned that some of the parents had been reluctant to let their children come, knowing that Tony had a penchant for trouble, and that the Avengers would be there. Some parents hadn't let their kids come, but there were at least kind enough to come up with a reason why that wouldn't hurt Peter's feelings.
Clint and Natasha were up front, and Bruce was secluded to the side, his headphones on, trying to unwind from a Code Green. Steve and Tony were on their own with the unhappy baby. Tony glanced at his sight-for-sore-eyes boyfriend and made a decision. "Let me try something."
Tony pulled a couple things from the bag on the floor of the backseat of the car, Peter watching with interest. They were sitting in the parking garage by the Smithsonian Museum, getting ready to go inside. Mary had went to DC early, Coulson had wanted to meet with her quickly, and Tony said they would meet up her after he got his time with Peter, like he told her before she moved.
"There you go," Tony said, walking out of the elevator on his floor. "I'm super bored, and Bruce isn't going to emerge for at least three more days-"
“You know you can ask me anything,” Tony told him as he sat up on the couch fully. “No holds bar. Is it something serious?” Peter wobbled his head side to side, not really nodding, or shaking his head no. “Alright, is it something that your mom would get upset about?” Peter shook his head no this time, and internally Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
"Well, I won't give up on us," Steve picked back up in the song, a small smile on his face. "God knows I'm tough enough." He started to sway with Tony in the hallway. "We've got a lot to learn." His hand slid down to Tony's waist.
"You know, Tony, we've been discussing some things," William started to say, causing Tony's eyebrow to raise. "Does the offer still stand?"
Tony reached up and started to run his hand through Steve's hair slowly. "Me, too," he breathed out. They sat there, just leaning on each other, taking comfort in being able to feel each other, until the tablet screen between them lit up. Jamie's soft cries could be heard, and Steve was already moving to get up.
"I don't like bring back data about bad music choices to the R&D labs," Tony said with a little smirk. Steve huffed through his nose. "I'll get a new phone up to you this week."
Tony grit his teeth and raised his arm, firing off a shot at Vanko's head, but the helmet covered up again just in time to deflect the repulsor shot. Tony tried to fire his boots to get away and one of the whips wrapped around his ankle, throwing Tony back to the ground. The second whip was wrapping around his neck, and charging up, making Tony's HUD crackle again. He gasped when the power suddenly surged through the suit again.
Tony remembered the first time he had encountered a real life Pokeball. Jarvis and Ana were out grocery shopping, his dad was away on business, over in Europe with his Aunt Peggy, and his mom was working her next gala event. Now would be the perfect time to sneak down into his dad’s workshop, and finally go to the case that he knew held all of the Captain America stuff. The stuff that was better than the poster that Jarvis and Ana had gotten for him for his 5
“Normally no, but I don’t know how else to explain this.” He took a seat in the smaller room they entered. Tony started to rub the bridge of his nose. “It’s starting to scare me.” He looked up when he saw Strange pulling a chair up across from him.
"You helped my Daddy, and Uncle Bruce, and Mr Steve," Peter continued, not moving his hand away, waiting patiently. Hulk let out a snort of air through his nose, looking a little anxious, before he took a couple steps forwards. Tony tried not to tense up, watching him. Hulk put out his hand and Peter grabbed one large finger with his hand, and shook it up and down like he was shaking someone's hand. "Thank you."
Tony nodded, “Yes they do and they all know that I am your parent. That’s for your protection Pete. You need changes during the day, bottles, naps, all that stuff. You can still go to college after if you want, and then you can work for Stark Industries. You’re already down as an employee because you like to help out so much in the lab. None of this has been taken away from you, it’s just changed the priorities in your life. I know it doesn’t look ideal right now but this is for the best. “ Tony was silent while he tipped Peter’s head back and washed the shampoo out, Peter contemplating everything he told him.
“Okay, Mama. Peter sits in the car seat this time.” He made sure to emphasise the ‘this’ just so his Daddie’s wouldn’t get any ideas in the future. He was rewarded with a kiss to his forehead before he was expertly strapped into the seat and the door was shut on his side. Peter looked down, pulling at the harness to see if it would come off.
“That’s not really how it works honey but once his goes through the test we’ll know where we stand okay?” He said, as if it was the most normal thing in the world and Bucky wasn’t about to have a meltdown.
“Dada, I’m big, remember?” Peter said sweetly. Steve might have believed him if Peter wasn’t sucking so contently on a pacifier.
He gave his pacifier a sharp suck to work up the courage before telling him no, and yes. He knew that sucking on a pacifier probably will not help his case but there definitely has to be some magic to these things. It was the only thing that was keeping his nerves of waking up in a completely different world from imploding. Hmm, that put an idea in his head. He was in Mama’s arms. That gave him the leverage he needed to pull off his plan. Giving the pacifier one last suck he took it from his mouth and placed it into his Mama’s. It helped that his Mama’s mouth was open in laughter at Daddy fighting with the baby over the car seat. That should help calm him down while Peter pleaded his case. All Mama had to do was suck on it a few times and he’d say yes. Peter just knew it.
Tony growled again but this time at Steve. “Not happy with you either. Stupid Alpha’s.” He muttered, glaring at Bucky because he couldn’t see Steve from the position he was in. He missed Steve’s look of confusion over his head.
Steve watched them all go and waited until he, Clint and, Tony were alone. Time to push a little more.
His heart lifted in hope when he saw Steve nodding his head. “You’re right, I did forget.” The smile he sent Tony filled his stomach full of butterflies, somehow he didn’t think he was going to get actual clothes. His suspicions were confirmed when Steve didn’t go over to the closet as he expected but went to his bedside locker and pulled something small out that he hid behind his back.
“What’s up Steve?” asked Bucky, taking a seat beside Clint. Clint tensed up when he sat beside him, aware of what was coming and dreading it. Bruce just looked quizzically at Steve, wondering why he’d need him and Bucky, unless?
“Today was awesome. I got so many sweets, I’d say I’ll have a tummy ache for the next month solid. I love Halloween Papa. Do you think Mama will let me eat all of them without making me have some fruit to go with it? Cause Ned said that it’s not half as good when you have to eat healthy stuff with it and as a scientist, I feel that we need to be aware of the negative effects that fruit has on sweets. Don’t you agree Papa?”
Steve turned so that he could sit down to wait out his knot. It had an effect on Tony as the change in position and he found himself spraying his stomach with come as his ass worked the knot.
Steve rolled his eyes. “All I was trying to do was give him a bit of applesauce before dinner because he said he was hungry. I didn’t know he had such an issue with it. He loved it yesterday.”
Peter made a token protest every time but if it made him feel better that Peter sat in this seat, then he would do it.
“Yes! Trick or treating!” He jumped out of the bed and took off down the hallway. “Mama c’mon!” He called as he ran, making Tony chuckle. For some reason Peter went between calling him Dad and Mama. He’d say it was a fifty, fifty divide on it but Tony found himself not caring too much about it. He had asked Peter about it once and the boy blushed a bright shade of red and shrugged.
“So good sweetheart. We’ll wait out this knot then we’ll have some food. You can come as much as you want. I know how much you need it.” He murmured into Tony’s hair, kissing his temple before bending down and lightly biting his mating mark, sending Tony instantly into orgasm. Tony wailed with the force of it, sensitive after coming three times in such a short period of time.
“Sorry little Omega, you can come on my cock alone. No touching yourself without my permission is your first rule. We’ll sort the rest out once your clear headed so this is all you need to remember, for now, let’s work on getting you some relief.”
“Did he wake up early from his nap?” Peter wasn’t sure who said that but it sounded like Captain America maybe?
“Of course, boss.” Friday began the film and Peter was instantly hooked, letting Steve move him which every way he needed to scent him, letting out little purrs of contentment as he was bathed in Steve’s scent.
At seeing his Dad sitting on the couch he ran and cuddled right into him, letting out little purrs of contentment. He ignored the way he was dressed in only a shirt in favour of getting the much-needed cuddles.
Peter struggled to think back, sorting through all the clashing memories he had of Aunt May and finally seeing a memory of her here. “She’s still my Aunt.”
This was the issue with them getting their memories back, it was making the now all confusing for them and making them forget everything they knew about this world while their brains sorted out what was now and what was the past.
Peter couldn’t say he was too upset over it though, he didn’t like camera’s going off in his face all the time.
“It’s even better when we’re in rut, isn’t it? Omega’s feel great then. When they’re begging for it and want nothing more than to please us. There’s nothing better than that feeling.” Steve continued, playing with Tony’s pebbled nipples, seeing Clint unconsciously bringing his hand up to his own chest.
“Clint, I want you to keep your eyes open and look at Tony and Steve. This is part of both of your training so you need to get used to it okay?” Bucky felt Clint nod and looked for Steve to go ahead.
“Who was it? I’ll have them killed for touching you. Jarvis, who went near Steve?” Tony asked, glaring at Steve while Steve glared at Clint.
Tony got a cup and started pouring water over Peters's hair, getting it wet. May as well wash his hair since he was here.
Tony had a less stressful time getting Peter out, simply plucking him from the car seat and putting into the buggy, while Peter slept soundly on.
“Mama you know that I’m old enough to sit without one of these?” He asked, slightly embarrassed over the who car seat situation.
“Just want to see what she’s planning on doing. If she wants to work in a diner, awesome. If she wants to work somewhere else, awesome as well.”
Tony rolled his eyes, becoming more clear-headed as he spoke. Looks like a knot helped a lot with thinking. “Maybe because you came in and just decided it was time to mate, without so much as a how do you do!” Tony watched at Bucky stiffened and directed a deadly glare towards Steve.
“Prostate is healthy. It’s quite engorged at the moment for obvious reasons and it’s a good size. In the normal range for a submissive Omega.” Bruce withdrew his fingers, causing Clint to whine. He needed them back. He needed relief. Bucky hushed him and sat him back up so that he was back in position in his lap.
Bucky was still pouting as he was moved from his Daddy to his Mama. It was cute watching his face transform from pout to smiling when he was moved. He then spoke his first words since he crashed.
“I’m pretty sure they won’t be but you never know. I’m hoping that because we're rushing to go meet him off the plane that there won’t be enough time for them to get here. Doesn’t mean normal people won’t have their camera’s out though. If it annoys you, you can hide your face.”
“Okay, look, we’re leaving. You’re coming with me, baby. We’re going to see how Daddy and Bucky are doing okay?”
“You’re a great helper honey. Let’s get Mama to sit down so I can get a proper look, okay?” Peter knew that while it was directed it at him it was said to his new Mama, who apparently was Mr Stark. His eyes followed Captain America to the seating area even as Mr Stark moved them to one of the open seats. Peter let himself be manoeuvred so that he was sitting with his back to Mr Starks chest. Mr Starks arms came around him and were lying on his tummy, anchoring Peter to him. Peter clutched his plushie to him as a form of protection to his front as he dared look around for the first time. There weren’t as many people as he was fearing there. Only Black Widow, Hawkeye, Winter Soldier, Mr Coulson, Mr Loki, Mr Thor and Mr Rhodes. It was still a lot more than he wanted and he nearly hid back in his new Mama’s neck but Captain America was in front of him again, cupping a hand to his cheek and guiding his face so he was looking at him.
Thankfully Peter accepted it easily, looking over at Tony, who looked a tiny bit more in control. “Can we watch Star Wars now?” He asked pleadingly.
“You can put his diaper back on so none of us gets an accidental shower.” Tony chuckled, picking up Bucky’s ankles and placing a clean diaper on him. He made a funny face at him, earning a small giggle in return.
Unbuttoning his vest was easy, all he had to do was yank at it and the buttons flew open. He couldn’t find any underwear around so instead, he tore off the wet diaper, letting it fall with a thunk and leaving it where it was. No way was he touching a wet diaper, Yuk!
Dr Cho ushered them into the room, “ That’s right young man. I usually don’t do these types of tests but thought Bucky would feel more comfortable with a doctor he’s used to seeing.” She explained gesturing to the two chairs in front of her desk, Steve and Tony settled themselves and the boys on the chairs while Cho read through the questionnaire that Tony had filled out around Bucky’s clinging form.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Tony said quietly to the boy, not caring that a room of people was watching them. “Excited for this evening?” He felt Peter squeeze him a bit harder and nod. Tony gave him one last squeeze back and kissed his forehead before letting go. Peter then looked around the room, eyes lighting up when they land on Bucky.
The final bell rang and Peter jumped from his seat, and packing up his bag as quick as he could to get out. He heard the professor sigh at his antics but he just shot him a grin. All of his professors loved him and let him get away with a lot more than he should have. He’d been warned way more than the three times his parents said to before he got the final warning. Gathering up his things he called out a quick goodbye to Ned and took off as quickly as he could down the hall. He didn’t want to run in case he was stopped by a teacher on the way out. Just as he opened the front doors Flash had to make his inevitable appearance.
“We’ll be down tomorrow I’d say. I’d kill anyone who came near me right now that isn’t you Bucky. Let them know that Tony is safe though. I have a feeling I’ll be grovelling quite a bit once he’s over his proper heat so expect a lot of cuddles from a pissed off Omega.”
Steve, though, instead of scaring Peter more just pushed his head so that it was against Steve’s scent gland. At Peter’s first, inhale of the Alpha his body relaxed of its own accord. He could smell Steve and his Alpha scent but he could also pick up traces of his Dad in there which helped calm him down. The alpha scent was a relaxer for Omega’s, especially if the Alpha was mated to an Omegan parent of the child. Peter’s fear was coming from his brain but his biology already recognised Steve as his second parent now that he got his scent.
“Hey Petey, Daddy being mean to you, huh?” Tony cooed at the boy who hugged him back and nodded pitifully in response.
He put a point in the pro column for the little spider-man that he could see sewn into the headrest. It looked like he was mid swing, one small hand holding onto some web.
Steve’s brow furrowed, “Sweetheart, I’m a traditional Alpha, we both know what that means. The team will be seeing us knotted a lot. They know what us being mated means and are aware of the respect they need to show you.” He’d made sure of that the moment he realised that Tony was going to become his. “There’s also the training that you’ll be doing. It’s nothing major, just on how to please me and such. We can’t kick the team out of the tower because of that.”
Steve cleared his throat to get Tony’s attention, indicating that he was going to pick Peter up when Tony looked at him.
Peter grinned, “Awesome! Thank you so much for letting me have twitter! Can I put a picture of the two of you?”
Tony took off his uniform and went to take a bath. The warm water really loosened his tense muscles. He got out from the bathtub and put on clean clothes. He flopped on the bed with Steve’s blazer at the end of it. He looked at it for a while contemplating whether he should washed it or simply return it.
Tony groaned in his seat, feeling quite sleepy with the after effect of his late night projects finally kicking in again. And to top it off, he was feeling quite full right now. He felt as if he could sleep for a week with the tiredness he was feeling. He almost dozed off from time to time, barely able to keep his eyes open through the lesson. He must have actually dozed off at some point when he vaguely heard someone calling out his name.
“….It’s f-fine. I didn’t …mind it but it’d be great if you gave me a heads up next time”, he managed to speak out, cheeks adorned in a red blush, looking away. For some reason Steve felt like Tony was really cute.
Tony turned to look at the girls gazing out the windows and it hit him, “Oh, I see. It’s Monday today, isn’t it?”, he asked.
“Just because you happen to do well in your studies doesn’t mean you have any right to ignore my lecture like you don’t care about it”, the teacher retorted, glaring at him. Well he really actually don’t care for it.
“Since we are all going to be in the same club. Why don’t we introduce ourselves? “, Steve suggested.
“Don’t play coy, Loki. It happened a month ago, back when you attack New York with those beasts you summoned”
“That’s what I like about you, Steve. Come over to my place during the weekend. Let’s have a party of two”
Tony dragged his ass to class. He undeniably did not want to see any members of the host club until club activity time.
He was able to make out words like he’s so cool, handsome and even cute. Why did they say cute though? I’m more of a manly type.
“When you are working on your machines and latest projects, Tony, you look beautiful, handsome. Those eyes that became alive as you work with all your attention. Even though I know exactly what kind of person you are deep inside. I still catch myself thinking that”
“ ‘I couldn’t fall in love with you. Let’s break up’ “, Pepper repeated the famous last words of Steve Rogers to his girlfriends.
Steve was snoring lightly. His body moving slightly with every breath he took. Tony stood in his place near the bedroom door and stares at the sleeping figure in front of him like he was deep in thought. Finally he excused himself and went under the covers with Steve.
“I got it. Bye”, Tony replied, waving at him and got ready to knock on the door when he heard Steve call out  to him again, startling him.
“I deeply apologize, Steven. I was enjoying showing our new comrades around the school. How can I be of service?”, Thor said looking a bit dejected.
Steve was bombarded with his teammates and the girls who were coming onto the playing field. Congratulating him and some even trying to kiss him which he sincerely declined.
Ahh, watching him sleep so soundly like this makes me want to doze off too. He thought as he also leaned his head on top of Tony’s.
“Let me think. Does that stupid person’s name happen to be a Clint Barton?”, he asked , seeing her nod he continue,” He went that way. A few minutes ago”
Steve hurriedly got down as well looking through the crowd of people to find Tony, calling out for him as he does. Finally he found him and reached out to grab his shoulder, turning him around to face him. He has to confirm this.
“Not cool, Thor. I told you I don’t wanna go in. I have issues with a huge amount of water like over here for example”, he said pointing at the pool.
He reached out for it and brought it to his face. It was still a bit warm, Steve’s scent lingering on it. Tony felt himself being wrapped up in his warmth. It felt really good. He felt safe, protected from anything that would hurt him. Tony didn’t remember but he had drifted off to sleep clutching Steve’s blazer tightly to his chest.
“Are you alright?”, Steve asked, snapping out of the thought and Tony knew he was talking about last night. He nodded and thanked him again. “Oh, I forgot to give you your blazer back. I’m sorry I didn’t have enough time to wash it though”, he said taking out the cloth and handing it to Steve.
Peter rolled his eyes. Flash said this at least twice a week to him and it was getting old. His Papa and Dad agreed that school would be easier for him if they didn’t know he was their son. Peter could see where they were coming from of course, because if it was open knowledge within the school then it wouldn’t be long before the press got a hold of it, and if they knew that he was their son then he would be hounded all the time, which didn’t sound one bit fun. It was because of that, that the school knew who he was and his proper name but they used his aunt’s last name for everyone else. He also just went with the story that he lived with his aunt and his parents died when he was young, which was true but when his mom and stepdad died in the plane crash he was actually with his Dad and not his aunt. It was a handy story to tell but at the same time, it led to situations like this where Flash liked to taunt him for being an orphan which just wasn’t true. Today though, he didn’t have time to give a snarky response. One was, he could see his Papa watching from across the road and two, he really, really wanted sweets.
Steve took it and tucked it around Peter as he snoozed, cuddling into the warmth of the blanket, his purring not stopping for a second. Steve had heard that pup’s when content, purred as well. He had never seen Peter do it but it might just be the cutest thing he’d ever seen.
“To what do we owe the pleasure, ‘Tasha?” Tony asked, too tired to give in to his usual quips. What he really needed was a solid eight hours in bed and not another cup of coffee.
Tony came to with the fire ripping through him once more. He’d come another four times before he finally passed out, not able to hold himself up anymore. His brow furrowed and he felt an emptiness inside. He must have slid off the dildo in his sleep, he tried to pick himself up and slide back onto it but a hand stopped him. He settled back down with a sigh before shooting back up. A hand shouldn’t be touching him! He was by himself when he passed out and he most certainly didn’t have a third hand.
Steve and Tony were setting up to watch Star wars with Peter in the living room. Before they sat down to enjoy it Steve knew he’d have to scent mark Peter so that everyone would know he was under Alpha protection from now on.
Then he felt a sharp sting on his left ass cheek before seconds later the same was repeated on his right one. “Clint.” The voice said forcefully, effectively forcing Clint out of his little bubble of bliss.
“Hey!” Tony said indignantly, “You should be grateful to listen to me speak I have you know! Isn’t that right Petey?”
“Eh Papa? I just told someone I’m 14. Is that okay?” He asked, staring between his parents who were still sitting on the couch in front of him.
“What’re you going to write up?” Tony asked when he saw Peter grinning at his phone. Peter just shook his head. “Just wait. I’ll tag you.”
“What will I mind and what did you put protection on?” Steve asked as he walked in, rolling the sleeves of his shirt up as he came in. Peter lit up when he saw his Papa and jumped up running to him for a hug.
“Uh-huh.” Peter liked that he had a little brother; someone that looked up to him. Bucky did look up to him as well, which was awesome!”
Every time he was overly cautious Bucky would startle awake and glared at him but when Steve just hoisted him up as if he were awake he would stay sound asleep.
He gave his Omega cock another pump and let go, bringing his hand back to hold just before his knot. He didn’t want Peter to come back to them tied. He was sure it would happen in the future but for day one he wasn’t going to traumatise his new son. He could feel himself coming and thrust harder, Tony was whining with every thrust and Steve felt for him. He had positioned them so that the side of the couch rubbed against his cock. He pushed into him on last time, giving his ass an appreciative smack as he came into Tony’s hole. He pulled out when his cum started to taper off and pushed Tony’s shirt up further. Letting the last drops, hit his back.
Steve kissed his forehead and placed him so that the dildo was suctioned firmly to the seat below him. “Off you go sweetheart.” He said, sitting down beside him. Tony needed no more encouragement and began to ride the dildo hard, ignoring the rest of the team around him as he did.
“Oh, baby.” He heard Mama say but he couldn’t respond. Now they’d never think he was a big boy. This was all ruined! Peter fell onto his bottom in defeat, crying his heart out. He would never be a big boy now. It wasn’t fair!
Steve decided to take pity on him and instead of playing with just the tip and took hold of his cock fully, his hand nearly being the full length of it. It only took two twists of Steve’s hand and Tony was spilling all over his hand, his ass milking Steve’s knot as the orgasm overcame him. Steve pumped up into him again, grinding against his ass and drawing out Tony’s orgasm. Steve didn’t stop stroking his cock, drawing whimpers out of Tony as his now sensitive member was toyed with.
“Hey Peter! You’re going to be too big for me to do this soon!” Harley laughed while Peter clung to him.
“So- it’s cause you love me that you give out to me? Do you not love Harley?” Peter was devastated to think that Harley wasn’t as loved.
Tony pouted the whole way out to the common area, studiously ignoring Steve. When they got to the common room Tony made a beeline straight for Bucky who was sitting on the sofa watching Clint and Natasha play some game.
“Thanks, Buck. Tony will be starving I’m sure.” He commented flexing his hips to set him off again. Tony whined but pushed back at the same time, willing to take more, causing Steve to grin. Training such a responsive Omega was going to be a lot of fun.
Tony nodded, taking the stopper out of the bath, “Afraid so baby. While you’re my big boy you still can’t tell if you need to go and we don’t want any more accidents, do we?”
“It was but you still could have got confirmation off of me for it,” Tony said petulantly, not happy that he just took.
“What’s wrong baby? Why are you so sad?” Sure, it seemed like a stupid question but if there was one thing Tony knew about his kid was that Peter liked to vocalise what was wrong with him, he just needed prompting sometimes.
The little diner they went to was just off the testing centre and was clearly used for people that were either celebrating or mourning their results. Tony was pretty sure he owned it but had to shoot Pepper a quick text to find out. If he did, it was about due an upgrade.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Peter’s whining. “Well, I’ll be having a word with Papa over that. I want you safe when we’re driving and this is the best way to do that. So hop in.”
Tony hopped out of the car as soon as it stopped, opening the boot to get out the double buggy they had put there when boys were distracted earlier.
He pulled brown skinny jeans on and caught the brown long sleeved top that had a lighter brown circle in the middle, his Papa threw him and tugged it on, only needing the slightest bit of help when his hair got caught.
Peter watched as Bucky rubbed his face against the blankey he was handed, his breathing still a bit ragged. They were just coming up to the front doors which were a good thing, Bucky was looking at Mama like he wanted him more than Daddy and was going to start crying again if he didn’t get him. Peter got that. His memories were still extremely muddled but one thing was clear. His Mama’s comfort was the best, Daddy made a close second but Mama just had that special touch. Peter did spare a thought to how his Mama would be able to lift Bucky but it was quickly dismissed. This worlds Tony Stark was a lot buffer than the other one, and weirdly enough Bucky was a lot slimmer, kind of like how Peter looked. He wondered if that was a little thing or it just so happened that they both looked similar.
“It’s going to be a long week if you give out about everything I want you to do, now bend over. I want to keep you open at all times for me.”
Between the excitement of the day, the comfort of the car seat and the motion of the car, Peter was asleep within seconds. Tony waited until Peter’s small snores filled the car. “Do you think we baby him too much?” He asked.
This chapter is dedicated to themysteryassassin as a thank you for letting me know about the plagiarism of These Little Days. Thanks again!
Mama just hummed though, “How about this then? Why don’t we put a diaper on but when you need to go wee-wee’s you let me know and I’ll bring you.”
Steve glared at him, “There was literally no way I would have been able to keep him settled. I even gave him two swats for being careless and it didn’t stop his enthusiasm one bit. Getting him down for a nap is going to be torture.” Steve was well aware that Peter should be considered too old for a nap but they had learned that hard way that if Peter didn’t have his after-school rest they were all going to be in for a rough evening. It didn’t stop Peter from trying everything to get out of it regardless.
“I know a few people. They invited me out with them tomorrow and I haven’t seen them in a while so since I’m here I may as well.”
Steve got nearly a full bowl of pasta and a good bit of water into Tony before Tony copped he could have the knot. With a grunt he let himself fall completely onto the chair, the knot making him widen his legs so that they were to the side and not in front of him. He rocked back and forth feeling it pull against his rim groaning in pleasure. Nothing beat Steve’s knot. Leaning both arms on the table he lifted himself off the knot and nearly completely off the dildo before slamming himself back onto it. This time the knot smoothly going past his rim so it was snuggly inside his ass. He came again at the feel of it against his prostate, his come hitting his stomach, his eyes nearly rolling back in his head with the orgasm.
“I’m going to check on Bucky. He probably slept through it but you never know.” Bucky was notorious for being a deep sleeper. Peter had woken up early from the nap, Tony wouldn’t be surprised if he fell back asleep. They’d have to change him though. He put his sweatpants on backwards and had two t-shirts on. He also had the flaps of his vest hanging over the sweatpants. It was extremely cute to look at and he made Friday get some photos of Peter but it wouldn’t do after that.
This question was a tough one to answer. Usually, he slept alone but today Mama and Dada said he wasn’t going to be any more so he’d sleep somewhere else? He looked back at Mama to help again.
“Whoa, what’s wrong their little man? Do you not want to stay with your aunts and uncles? Not even uncle Rhodey?” Peter shook his head. No way. He was not leaving his Mama’s arms and that was final. He began to tremble when he thought that his Mama was going to put him down, and clutched onto him tighter. He couldn’t do this, not when his mind was all over the place and the only real thing he knew was that he loved his new Mama. He didn’t relax until he felt his Mama walking away from the noise of the common room.
“What? A Twitter account? What- Wh- Tony! Why are you letting our child go onto that horrible site!” Steve demanded, pulling Peter closer to him when he tried to make his way back to Tony.
“Oh god, Alpha, I’m-I’m.” That was all Tony could get out before he came explosively against Steve. Steve tried to hold back but Tony clenching down on him trigged his knot and before he knew it they were tied together again.
“I feel like I’ve missed something.” He said when it looked like Tony or Peter weren’t going to answer him.
Bucky just waved his free hand in response. “Relax mother hen. He’ll be settled by the time you’re done. I have Stevie watchin’ over me anyway so I won’t be able to get away with anything.”
Steve took the other side of Peter and taking out his own phone to log into his newly created Twitter.
Finally, Natasha smirked, “Good staredown kid. The cute factor does it for you. Here I got this for you when I was visiting Ireland a few weeks ago.” She threw four different types of chocolate bars into his bucket and Peter gasped when he saw what they were. Dairy milk had to be the best chocolate in the world and she got him four! The plain chocolate, mint crisp, golden crisp and Turkish delight.
He could finally get back to his lab and pick up where he left off. He made a move to go but quickly noticed the second thing, he was still tied to Steve. Steve who was now his Alpha. Steve who was now his Traditional Alpha. Damn. He just knew there was no chance that Steve was going to let him go down to the lab so newly mated. He couldn’t even try to sneak off either since Steve’s knot was keeping them firmly connected. He huffed a breath out. How was he going to get out of this one? He glanced behind him. Steve was dead to the world, arms wrapped around Tony, one hand firmly on his cock, which of course was hard. The traitor. Tony sighed again, this time louder, and nudged Steve hard so he would wake up. When that didn’t work he began to poke at his head and calling his name again and again.
Peter tried his hardest to get past the chastity and spanking. How was he supposed to go to a traditional household? Peter felt dread in his stomach. This was going to be a tough adjustment period if the look on his Dad’s face was any indication. Instead of responding Peter just turned back into Steve, at least he felt safe with him. That was a start.
He waited patiently until his Dad came over with the face paint and did his nose before placing the ears on his head. After he finished he stood back to judge his work, squinting his eyes at him.
Peter yelled out in fear when he was taken away from his Dad’s neck. Fighting to get back without any success, just ending up on Steve’s lap.
“That’s because Mama wants to show him everything the both of you are working on and doesn’t want you to be bored while he does. You know Mama can’t keep an eye on you while he’s showing Harley things.”
“Clint?” Steve called from where he and Tony were in the living room, he could feel his knot finally going down and they really needed to eat but Tony looked ready to go again. Luckily Steve thought ahead and had something that should keep him going until after lunch.
“Well, being in a traditional household you’ll be going into chastity. It’s something all young Omegas should be in and will help you when you have your own Alpha. You will have a curfew and bedtime to abide by that your Dad and I will be speaking about that today. You’ll have dinner with us every evening so no skipping out on meals. You will be getting spanked if you disobey. Then there are your usual rules that your Dad already has in place for you. Your Dad has said that you tend to crawl into his bed at night. That doesn’t have to stop, you can always come into the bedroom whenever you want. Just be sure to know that we might be naked. It shouldn’t bother you though because it’s all-natural. We won’t be doing anything traumatising with you in the room.”
Peter pulled away from his Papa and ran back over to Tony, nearly jumping on top of him in his eagerness to set up his account. He fished his phone out of his pocket and handed it to his Dad.
“Do you want to help me find Dada and Jamie?” Peter nodded absently, more distracted with how cosy he felt. He supposed it couldn’t be that bad if he felt this comfortable?
“As I said a while ago. This week is all about fucking.” Steve said.” I know we just spent the last week fucking but this is different.” He added when it looked like Tony was about to protest.
“What no! We had agreed that we would mate before this! We did, didn’t we?” He directed the last part to Tony a waiver of uncertainty in his voice. Tony took pity on his Alpha.
“Okay. If you’re sure Papa.” He said, yawning. He was too tired for this conversation at the moment. He was glad when Bucky started reading his favourite Harry Potter book. He fell asleep just as Harry and his friends saw the dark mark in the sky at the tri-wizard tournament.
A waitress rushed over to them, tripping over her words as she showed them to their seats. He had to give them points when two highchairs just arrived at their table. Peter whined when he saw it, clutching onto Steve tighter. Bucky narrowed his eyes and then copied him. Tony bit back a grin. He could see how that was going to be a problem. Bucky was going to copy everything Peter did which would inevitably lead to a disaster.
Steve took hold of Tony’s sensitive member, running his hand slowly up and down making Tony cry out and Clint’s jaw to clench. “He’s really sensitive after coming. I love playing with his Omega cock right after he does because it means he squirms more and milks my knot even harder. You know what that’s like right? Playing with an Omega right after they’ve come right? Nothing better?”
Hey! A new chapter is up! It's been ages and that's nor right but life etc. Let me know what you think of this chapter! It's only a short one I know but if I didn't post it today it would be another week before I was able to get back to it.
The only noise in the room was Tony’s low moans while they waited on Bucky and Bruce to arrive. They didn’t have to wait long thankfully, Bucky strolling in with Bruce right behind him. Bucky was in workout gear and had a sheen of sweat coating his skin while Bruce came in rubbing his eyes as if he’d just woken from a nap. That was typical Bruce though, always looking half asleep unless he was with Tony and in a science fuelled fever.
The elevator door opened and Peter gasped. He could hear his Dad’s voice! That meant he was already here! He let go of his Papa’s hand and took off into the living room where he could hear his Dad. He could hear his Papa telling him not to run but
“No I’m not,” He argued, “You’ll keep getting bigger as well and we’ll just continue this forever until we’re both old men.”
“S’okay Fri! Wasn’t that scary.” Well, that was a big fat lie. Tony wasn’t going to call him out on it though. That was the great thing about little kids, they tended to get over their upset fairly quick.
“Clint?” He demanded when he stayed quiet, his voice going down an octave and slipping into his Alpha voice. It made Tony whimper at the sound of it. His heat was making him crazy, he needed Steve locked to him, not this artificial cock that didn’t stop the burning need. Now Steve was using his Alpha voice and Tony wasn’t sure what he did wrong?
“Can someone watch Peter for a few minutes?” Tony asked. What?! No way was he leaving the safety of his Mama’s arms.
Tony huffed out a breath, “It makes me feel objectified. People are just going to stare at it and then go to the claiming bite.” He said, more clearly this time. Not willing to look up, he knew Steve wouldn’t be too happy with his reasoning but he couldn’t help how he felt about it. Steve pulling him back into a hug and pressing him into his neck so he could scent him was not what Tony was expecting when he told him, yet here they were, with Steve rubbing his muscled hand up and down Tony’s bareback.
“Back in two.” He heard his Mama say and Peter watched him leave the room, but not before he ran a gentle hand through Mr Winter Soldier’s hair. Peter watched discreetly as Mr Winter Soldier’s eyes widened at the contact and he watched Mama leave. That was something to think about later, he decided as he felt his eyes drooping once more. Right now it was sleep time.
The second the doors opened Peter let go of Tony’s hand and walked away without looking at either of them, leaving the two of them staring at him.
Tony stood up suddenly. “I’m going to talk to him. Now. No way am I letting him go any further thinking I don’t like him.”
Bucky laughed again, “I’ll let them know. It’s about time someone didn’t let you away with anything. The Captain America title will get you nowhere with Tony. You give him hell doll, it’s the least he deserves.”
“Want my help?” Bucky nodded, watching his Mama move his hands to separate the colours. When he was done he looked up and Dr Cho.
“That’s all I need.” Tony whipped out his phone while Steve busied himself getting a bib on a whining Peter.
big! Peter was crying into Dada’s neck as he watched Mama walking up and down the street with Bucky who was still sobbing. They’d finally left the testing centre and were going for food somewhere. Peter just wanted to go home and sort out his wild emotions in peace.
Steve sighed again, pulling Harley into a hug. “Harls, Peter loves you. He just thinks that you and Tony don’t like him back. He likes you being here and loves to spend time with you. He just doesn’t see why you ignore him all the time,” Steve held up a hand when Harley went to open his mouth to protest, “I know what you did wasn’t intentional but to Peter it was devastating. Let Tony talk to him and after we know Peter knows that both of you love spending time with him then talk to him.”
“Lucky for us we’re only a half-hour away from the airport. Papa made you a snack and told me that we’re not to get any airport junk while we wait for Harley. I think we can hide some chocolate from him though, what do you think?”
He caught Flash’s smirk from across the room and barely withheld rolling his eyes. “Yes sir.” He said meekly, making an effort to relax his body. No point in letting Flash rile him when he was on his last warning. It was a bit embarrassing that the professors in school were giving him a last warning for spankings but as both his Dad and Papa had pointed out, they weren’t aware of that. All they knew was Peter got three warnings per class and on the third warning he’d be told about the phone call. If the phone call was made, then Peter knew he’d be in a lot of trouble. Surprisingly though, it was worse if they rang Papa rather than Dad and Peter always prayed it was his Dad they got.
He could see Bucky still fast asleep, right beside him which made him jump the obvious conclusion that he was in some sort of buggy.
Finally, Bucky nodded his head and Peter gave a happy wiggle. He was so happy. He now had a baby brother called Jamie. He didn’t care if everyone else called him Bucky, Peter felt that using actual names were important.
“’ Kay Mama, let’s get move on.” Tony had to bite back a smile, gosh his eldest was just the cutest when he parroted one of the adults.
The internet collectively went crazy at the latest picture while Peter cackled to himself. Twitter was fun.
Sitting like that gave Peter time to think a bit more on his situation here. He was still baffled as to why he was reacting this way. It was like when he got his spider powers and all his senses were dialled to 11. Now it seemed that his emotions were constantly out of control and there was no way to stop them. He didn’t even have it in him to not take the comfort that was offered to him. Realistically he should be able to control his emotions the more he was here but it was getting worse, not better. He shouldn’t be crying at raised voices. Even though he always hated when Tony was angry with him, it never reduced him to tears like this did. He wondered if he would be able to learn some discipline with it. Going by Bucky he wouldn’t though. The minute Mama and Papa challenged him on being a little Bucky broke down. Peter had seen him cry more in one day here than he ever did in his own world.
Steve nodded, “I know, I just hate seeing him upset. That pacifier did work a treat though. Don’t think I didn’t see what Peter tried to pull with you either.” He grinned over at his now blushing husband.
“Good boy, keeping yourself hard for me. Are you wet for me?” He asked, letting go of his cock to focus on the plug he had put there before Peter came home, teasing him by tapping it hard enough to vibrate against Tony’s prostate. Tony whined high in his throat, “Alpha..” His words trailed off when Steve removed his plug full and took hold of his hips and picked him up. He put Tony sitting on his lap, making quick work of his zip and button, pulling his own cock out. He wasted no time in sheathing himself inside Tony.
Steve shook his head. “You both messed up big time. Enough that Peter can’t bear to face the two of you. What are you going to do about it?”
Bucky nodded, placing one on top of the other. He was only able to get four stacked up before he brought another block down to smash them all, giggling at the crashing noise it made.
Tony bit back a laugh. His kid was just too much sometimes. He was sure Peter would try to beat Steve up if he did it without his consent.
“Hello, welcome to upper east classification clinic. How may I help you, Mr Stark?” The lady behind the desk drew Peter’s attention and he tore his eyes away to look at her. When she caught him staring she smiled at him, causing him to give a shy smile from behind his soother before he hid his face in Mama’s neck.
“I like it when you go all Papa bear. It’s cute. Now do you want to come over and help me with Peter’s profile or do you want to stand there and glare?”
Fuelled with that information behind him he decided to let his Mama know that there was no way he was sitting in that.
The waitress nodded, “Anything for this little guy?” She asked smiling at Bucky, who just blinked sleepily back at her.
Natasha made her way deftly to where Steve was humming a tune and getting lunch ready for Tony. He glanced up when Natasha came in.
“Room- Peter- What?!” Tony exclaimed, he couldn’t keep track of their conversation. No way was his little Peter seeing him like this. He was the purest and most innocent omega he has ever seen. Way too innocent for seeing his Dad in ways no kids want to see them.
“You can say hello to your aunt and uncles in a few minutes honey, first I need to check your head, okay?” Peter looked wide-eyed at his new Daddy, not saying anything, instead, he gave his thingy another suck. It must have been enough because he smiled before pressing gentle fingers around where he hit his head. He pressed directly on the bump and it made Peter flinch and whine, throwing his body back so it was against his new Mama and away from those mean fingers. He heard his new Mama give a grunt when he threw himself back but he didn’t care, that
“It’s okay if I post this?” He showed them the picture and got the go-ahead off the two of them. They already knew that they would be featured a lot in Peter’s feed, something they were going to support wholeheartedly.
Peter bit his lip, he didn’t Harley to go out. He barely saw him and he was going again? He tried his best not to let the hurt show but he obviously didn’t do a good enough job because his Dad picked up on it straight away.
Tony didn’t mention that he found it kind of cute how put out Steve got when the kids wouldn’t do something for him. It was a bit crazy that Bucky slotted in so seamlessly.
Tony finished his little speech, looking at the now crying child before him and his fingers itched to pull him close. He waited until Peter responded though.
“Bucky, we couldn’t approach you until you got your memory back because you thought you were hiding it well beforehand and we didn’t have the heart to tell you otherwise but we know you’re a little as well and we need you to take the official test to see where you fall.” Bucky paled at Steve’s words. No. No way. This was not happening. He’d just been called out in front of everyone and he couldn’t handle it. The emotions were welling up too quickly and he wasn’t able to stop them. He bit his lip to try to stop the floodgates and thought he was doing a pretty good job until Peter shattered it.
Peter was more quietly clingy. He used his powers to his advantage and clutched onto Tony. There was no reasoning with him to let Tony go. Because of that, Tony had to bring him with him when he was using the bathroom or showering. Peter didn’t seem to mind at all and would just continue to cling to him.
“I know we’re treating Bucky like he’s little until we get to the centre but is that really the right call?” Tony gazed at his husband with sympathy, fighting with Bucky over the car seat was rough on him, especially Bucky’s cries.
Peter’s eyes widened as he looked around wildly. “Where is it? Papa? Where is it?” He cried, looking around.
“Sorry squirt, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that getting your past memories are confusing you right now but no matter if you’re little or big at any given time a car seat still needs to be used. It’s required by law. If we’re caught it’s a pretty big fine.”
“Mama, why are you driving?” He asked it wasn’t that he minded him driving but when Uncle Happy drove his Dad would normally sit in the back with him.
“Yes! Finally someone speaking a bit of sense!” Tony cuddled back into Bucky, closing his eyes, feeling the heat creeping back up.
He still had so many questions, like, what school was he in? How did it work? Was he little in school as well? They could all wait though because he had a more pressing issue. With one last sniffled he took his head out of his Mama’s neck and looked at his Daddy.
Clint watched on, dreading the coming hour but unable to look away from Tony or to interrupt to get it over with. Damn Steve and his sharp eye. Clint had made sure that he didn’t take note of Tony during his heat no matter how difficult it was when Steve was riding him in the common room earlier. He played it completely cool and thought he’d gotten away with it. Natasha didn’t even notice there was anything amiss. So how was Steve able to see through it? One thing was for sure. He wasn’t about to ask him. He had a feeling that he was in enough trouble as it was.
“Bad Dada!” Jamie shouted, pushing at his Dada to get away from him. He was not going to take his Dada abusing his big brother.
Peter shook his head while Mama wrapped him in a big fluffy towel and carrying him into his nursery.
Only took me half a year to update but here you go! Let me know what you think! Comments and kudos are much appreciated!
Steve raised a questioning eyebrow over Peter’s head, “Want to go through these rules with me- Why did you just take a picture?” Steve couldn’t keep up with his husband sometimes. Here he was freaking out about his son going on twitter and Tony was taking a picture of him hugging Peter and glaring at him.
“Yep. It never stopped being a thing.” Peter looked between the two of them, still cuddling into Tony’s side.
Peter nodded into his neck before gathering a shaky breath and pulling back to look at his Mama. “Sorry for throwing Ironman.”
“Peter, it’s nothing I haven’t done a load of times before. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about okay?” Peter nodded, still blushing. Tony just laughed and dressed him, towel drying his hair. They found that worked best with Peter’s hair, otherwise, his curls went out of control.
“Okay baby, back into the car seat with you. I think Daddy finally has Bucky settled down so we can get a move on.”
Tony reared back, unsure of why Bucky wasn’t siding with him, it was made worse when Steve interrupted his completely believable story.
Tony rolled his eyes, “It’s all about uniformity. We’re supposed to be the three bears and if we didn’t look all the same then how would people know?”
Peter nodded his thanks before he closed the door quietly behind him. Steve was sure Peter was going to cry in the shower. He looked a hair breath away from it. Steve nearly went back into the bathroom to comfort him when he heard the first small sob but let Peter have his privacy. He laid out his favourite pyjamas and a fresh pair of underpants and socks on his bed before he made his way back down the hall to where he knew Tony had been listening to his and Peter’s conversation.
“Mama, all the news are talking about it! They all want to know who I am! Look at the people are saying!”
Steve could smell him. It was all over the tower and it took everything in him not rush up to Tony straight away. Tony thought he didn’t know his cycle but Steve was keeping track of it for the past year. He needed to know his Omega was regular and Jarvis was more than helpful in letting Steve know when he began his heat. This time though, something was different. He wasn’t sure why he could smell Tony so much when normally it was muted at best. He was going to leave it maybe another half an hour before he made his way up to his Omega. He had planned to claim him today anyway, making sure the rest were out of the tower for today so he could properly claim his shy mate. Steve grinned thinking about the blush on Tony’s face when he mentioned that he was a traditional Alpha and he wanted Tony naked. He wasn’t sure why he was so embarrassed, Tony had an amazing body that would look beautiful with just the jewellery Steve gave him. He was sure though after his heat with Steve he’d be a lot more open to Steve’s more traditional ways. There would also be training but he could get that after his heat. Right now he needed to knot and cuddle his Omega. Grinning Steve looked at the time and realised in making his plans he’d let over two hours pass. Bucky and Sam would be back soon and Steve had planned to have Tony well mated by then. Making his way to the elevator he told Jarvis to bring him to Tony’s floor. He had an Omega to mate.
