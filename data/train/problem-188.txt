He opened his eyes just in time to see John scrunch up his face and falter in his movements as he added more splashes to Sherlock’s torso and melted together existing ones.
Still, Sherlock had been determined to come down here. He currently stood looking around, his eyes narrowed, apparently tuning in to the environment in that way he did.
Or should he just get up and leave early? John didn’t think he was going to continue coming here, anyway, after all. Politeness, however (and plain inertia, perhaps?), made him stay where he was.
Painful as it was, John noticed that ever since Sherlock had told him, he had become withdrawn, avoiding eye contact and shutting himself off in that way that John had grown accustomed to in their early days together, but which he had not seen in a while (or missed, for that matter). But John couldn’t blame him, what with that memory having suddenly been brought to the surface, undoubtedly bringing a shitload of unwanted emotions with it. It was only natural that he wanted a bit of space, John figured, just like he himself felt he needed some time to let the tornado in his head settle down. Because it raged inside him with an intensity that showed no signs of dwindling just yet.
Molly went to sit on the back step of the vehicle, slightly hunched over, clasping her hands in her lap.
He had wandered back towards John while talking, who then spoke quietly. “I think you slightly gave away the ending.”
A few minutes ago, a member of the medical team had removed John's breathing tube, because she estimated he could now breathe on his own. Which he indeed seemed to be doing fine.
It seemed Rosie was entering some sort of new phase, which included getting new teeth, and she was intent on letting the world know about how unfair everything was – especially Hannah, and preferably around three o’clock in the morning. Which accounted for Hannah’s weariness.
Sherlock let his hands slide down towards John’s surprisingly bright red pants, then deftly hooked his thumbs in the waistband and tentatively pulled them down.
The paint was still drying – Sherlock having only just washed the stains off his hands – when John approached him in the kitchen with a funny look in his eyes and the hint of a nervous sort of smile tugging at his lips. Chloe was sitting on John’s arm, flapping her arms wildly in excitement, clutching a tiny, purple, heart-shaped paper box in one of her little hands.
with Sherlock. Because he knew he had to keep his distance from him, right now; for his own wellbeing. Which was exactly what he was going to do. So he just kept it vague. “Yeah, look, okay. Maybe, if I get a chance.”
She’d have known what to do with those two if they’d come knocking at her previous job. Deep down, such men were invariably insecure little babies. Quite laughable. No longer able to compensate once they were naked. If only the reasonable people in the world were able to make such parasites feel naked all the time.
(John was eternally grateful that he’d managed to condition his sphincter so well in such short time and that he didn’t need fingering anymore beforehand, which saved a lot of hassle.)
“Will you look at that!” he said to Rosie, putting on the glasses and holding the moustache under his nose. “Daddy gets to dress up to visit your Great-aunt Viv. Shall we go and see when Aunt Molly has time to look after you for a couple of hours, then?”
Sherlock looked back up at John. There was a shy smile on his face, as he raised his eyebrows further, as if encouraging Sherlock to take the dog from him.
still recovering, and not just physically,” Sherlock said. “If the prospect of going back to work fills you with so much dread, then maybe you should consider whether you really want to do that at all.”
That night, after a day full of traveling around, to the detention facility, the solicitor, and the funeral director, when he lay staring at the ceiling of their bedroom, the main emotion John experienced was
They walked from the little station in Epping to the tea garden in companionable silence, enjoying the peace and quiet, and the sound of leaves rustling in the summer breeze.
An extra dimension to anal sex was revealed to John only later that month. One morning, John was pleasantly surprised to wake up being the little spoon for a change. He felt Sherlock’s erection pressing against his bottom, even though his lover was still fast asleep. Within minutes, John felt his own cock strain against his pants, and he reached down one hand to press it over his bulge. He also involuntarily pushed his bottom back against Sherlock, revelling in the feeling of Sherlock’s cock perfectly slotting in between his arse cheeks. He was still amazed at how wonderfully sensitive that area had turned out to be, once he’d allowed himself to be touched there. He subtly slid back and forth as he crudely stroked himself through his pants.
Sherlock tried not to smile like a fool at this, then abandoned the attempt and raised his hand to summon the waiter.
Btw sorry for posting this chapter quite a bit later than usual. To be completely honest, I had a bad case of the writer’s blues. :( Although I am grateful for every single one of you who have left kudos and lovely comments, I had hoped to attract more readers than this. It’s just hard to keep investing around two hours a day, every day, over the course of an entire year (next to my day job), just so that a few dozen people can enjoy this story. There are some other WIPs being written right now that tons of people on tumblr keep going on about, and for the first time in my entire life, I felt jealous. Which is a crippling emotion. But in the end, I’ve decided to abandon all dignity and just promote myself more on tumblr, and in the meanwhile, to just keep writing. :) For my faithful fans. Especially mama-orion, who has become a dear fandom friend and who cheered me up when I needed it most. <3
“It’s not a pleasant thought, John,” Sherlock said, eventually, “but I have this terrible feeling, from time to time, that we might all just be human.”
His hips pushed forward again and again and again, chasing the familiar bliss that presented itself in such an unfamiliar setting.
Sherlock briefly opened his eyes to see John had crawled back towards him and was now tentatively touching himself as he lay on his side next to Sherlock.
In the vicinity, they hung up the fourth one. They could already see the old warehouse a little further down the road.
Eurus never knew that Sherlock had been right. Not that she would have cared in the least, of course.
But it was only a ten-second blowjob. John wanted something else. He hastily untied Sherlock’s shoe laces so Sherlock could kick off his bespoke Italian shoes, which he did, and then practically
Then he talked and talked, revelling once more in all the wonderful details of each unique case as he recounted them to the barely conscious detective.
Looking down, he realised his left fist was clenching so hard around the handle of the pram that his knuckles had turned white. He stopped walking and deliberately relaxed his hand, stretched his fingers and took several deep breaths. He then focused on the innocent little creature that was staring up at the sky with her large, beautiful eyes. Whenever he started to feel too sorry for himself, he only needed to look at her, and his own worries faded away. Yes, he had trusted the wrong people in the past, but the main thing was that he should make sure that he would never breach Rosie’s trust as his had been betrayed. He knew what it was to be disrespected and he vowed not to let Rosie ever feel that way.
development, you know. Have to keep on the bottom of things.” Sherlock briefly closed his eyes. “On top. In order to be able to get to the bottom of things, I mean.” And on the same breath, “You know we should probably have dinner because it’s getting cold.”
He managed to largely neutralise his stress, nevertheless, by slipping his hand into Sherlock’s and holding it for a good deal of the flight. If – as John feared deep down – there happened to be any dangerous lunatics in this same piece of flying metal with them, he and Sherlock would handle them together, he told himself, in an attempt to stay calm.
.” He shrugged sheepishly. “But other than that, I’m fine, you know. Quite well, actually.” The smile that gradually took over his now flushing cheeks spoke volumes. “How about you? What brought you over here, anyway?”
It was only then that Sherlock remembered his Plan B. He hadn’t done all that research for nothing. But the stupid tar made it impossible to remember stuff properly. (He should really quit soon. That’s right,
--I know. Don’t worry, it’s on me. :) I thought it would be fun to have a proper fancy date for once. x
“Come in.” His voice sounded funny, but he didn’t care. He stood up and walked over to where John was appearing from behind the door, and without any hesitation Sherlock fell straight into his arms before the man was even properly inside the flat. “John,” he breathed.
The doorbell rang again. John looked towards the sound, then heaved in a frustrated breath, before scowling down at Sherlock.
he briefly wonders, smiling inwardly. Which is a ridiculous thing to think about, as he is about to give another man a blowjob, that will change
Taking a deep breath, he turned away, grabbing his phone to check his e-mail and unwind a bit before trying to go to sleep.
Sherlock’s eyes shifted to meet John’s. John returned the look. Together they would set right whatever wrong was happening here. Finally, they were working together again on a case that wasn’t about Mary – and hence about John. This was just the two of them against the rest of the world, bringing justice where it was desperately needed.
“No idea. Yet.” He drew in a breath. Oxygen and nitrogen molecules colliding. “But I don’t work for free.”
In the videos with these two, there had been smiles and a tenderness that had actually surprised Sherlock. Even though they were actors, a lot of it had seemed genuine and spontaneous to a certain extent. There had been no trace of discomfort in the lanky boy’s body language, and Sherlock had enjoyed watching the pair more than he’d thought he would.
He wasn’t sure what to expect this afternoon, though, once the guests arrived. He’d never really used to enjoy parties in any form or shape, until quite recently, at least. But being with John had changed his feelings about a lot of things. He found that, although he was slightly nervous about the prospect of their flat full of excited, cheery people, he was also sort of looking forward to it. A little.
“And if you wanna hide a murder,” Smith continued, somewhere far away, “or wanna hide lots and lots of murders, just find a...”
But moreover, ever since their teenage years, she felt that he’d never really accepted her being gay. There had been endless discussions about why it was really necessary that she was actively volunteering with the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. She thought it was important to press for law reforms and try to influence the provision of medical, psychiatric and social services, back in the early nineties. Her brother John, however, had seemed to think it was all just a load of nonsense and that she should stop wasting her time and start doing something that mattered. Like study medicine.
“Hello, Alice? It’s William Sherlock Scott Holmes again,” he said to her, forcing his tired brain to sound calm and friendly. “Sorry, my battery died. I just wanted to let you know that I’ve arranged for police officers to be waiting for you at the airport where you’ll land, to take you back to your mummy, alright? Everything is going to be fine.”
Mycroft raised his head and looked down his nose at John, but then turned his gaze towards the door, as Mrs Hudson barged into the room. “Where is Sherlock? How is he?” she asked, clearly as concerned as they were.
John felt miserable. Unsafe. Not in control. He needed to protect himself. Set boundaries. “No, no, no.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, visualising one of those memes where an object, labelled ‘you’, flies past a dot, labelled ‘the point’.
Sherlock let out a half-giggle in spite of himself and rested his forehead against John’s. “Please, forgive me, John, for being the biggest idiot in the entire hemisphere.”
Once he’d satisfied himself that he had enough to go on for the moment, he opened his eyes and stood up.
Then, silence. (In which Bill uttered some phrases that hardly made sense. Probably because he wasn’t real, anyway.)
Obviously, it wasn’t a surprise party, exactly – but they did both sort of pretend that it was, which was quite a lot of fun in itself.
Bizarre as this all was, though, he should really let it go. It was time to set Plan A into action. He had almost all the steps figured out. Basically he just had to stop pretending he was alright and add a little flavour on top.
There was a mattress on the floor, a tiny table in the centre and some magazines lying scattered around. Next to a wash basin, there were some tins of food and a camping stove. A box in the corner held some clothes. Among which, one pair of trousers containing the tracker.
“My mind is going round in loops like a record stuck in a groove,” Sherlock hissed through gritted teeth, “going over the same ridiculous and useless theories that make no sense whatsoever, but are the only ones that keep popping back into my head; like whether he could be very unsuccessfully trying to create an opportunity to pickpocket her, so that he has her debit and credit cards that he can exhaust once the inheritance is in her bank account.
At this realisation, there on the streets of Gloucester, he felt another surge of love for the man who had so successfully tried to make most people believe he was nothing but a calculating egotist. But John decided he’d better save any sort of expression of his affection for later, as they had just arrived at their lunch venue.
Sherlock had been so incautious as to take off his cap and glasses in the restroom at the Hall, since he wanted to throw some water over his face to cool off, when she entered with her cleaning equipment. Or more precisely, with the cleaning lady’s cleaning equipment, as the cleaning lady herself had apparently fallen victim to the same summer flu that the man Sherlock was replacing suffered from.
all the while as well. This Eurus woman, mainly, and Mary of course; making me question everything I knew. And the cherry on top of all this is, I’ve been having all these totally bizarre, really intense dreams here in the hospital.” He put a hand over his eyes, suddenly feeling overwhelmed with despair. “What I’m trying to say is, I just don’t know what’s real anymore. Whether I can trust my own memories.” He looked helplessly at Sherlock.
“Okay,” Sherlock’s voice said. “I’ll go in first, you follow three minutes later. I want you to walk up there before me though, and look at the shop window for a while, so that you can hear what he tells me from the beginning; the door is open, thanks to the warm weather. It might come in handy. I suggest your back-up story is that you are looking for an engagement ring. He’s got plenty of those in the shop window.”
“I told you, we have no idea where she went, exactly,” said Greg, exasperated. “Except that she was probably at one point in Morocco, around two weeks later, by early May. At least that’s where her pal AJ turned up when my Moroccan colleagues came across him.”
John quickly pulled Sherlock’s trousers and pants down. He liked Sherlock naked, even though both knew that John wasn’t going to bother taking off his own clothes.
Earlier this evening, he’d followed the blond student with his sporty, compact build to a pub a few blocks from the campus and had chosen a moment when John was tipsy enough to take a flirtatious, young stranger back to his room with him.
John wrapped his arms a little more tightly around his lover, who was already fast asleep, before drifting off himself as well.
Suddenly, a roar made his throat hurt, as he pushed all his energy into the heavy, wooden table, toppling it over and erasing the feeling of tears burning on his cheeks.
The next time he visited, it was with John and Rosie. It was only the second time John had come to Wantage. And Rosie’s first.
He could have known that the git would still tweet, even though it was no longer necessary for his cover.
As soon as their eyes met, Sherlock dashed off to the kitchen, mumbling something about getting more wine.
Sherlock pulled up a chair, seeing as he had no other plans anyway. As Mrs Hudson filled the kettle and put a tea bag in a flowery mug, she chattered about the cake she was baking and how she hoped it turned out better than the last recipe she’d gotten from Mrs Turner. “I’ve decided to replace the sugar with honey though. You see, I was at this country fair with my sister two weeks ago, in Barnet, and they had the loveliest flower stalls there that you’ve ever seen, and beautiful crafts of all sorts of things made from straw – the shiny, golden type, you know – but they also had a stand where they were selling honey, you see. And the ladies that were selling the honey told me all about its antibacterial properties. And antifungal too. It works against lots of things! It’s very healthy, really. So now at least we can feel a bit less guilty when we eat the cake.” She chuckled.
“I’m so sorry, John,” he whispered into John’s hair. And again, “I’m so sorry.” Once for John’s loss and once for Sherlock not knowing.
Rosie let out a delighted yelp when she spotted Molly among the mummies and daddies coming to pick up their children at the nursery.
“Well,” Sherlock said, grunting a little, as just then, with some effort, he pulled out a large, loose stone from the wall. After setting it down onto the ground, he squinted into the gap it had left. Then he reached one hand inside. “Let’s see what we have here, first.”
Firstly, there is the short film The Adventure of the Furtive Festivity, where Sherlock and John are in an established relationship and celebrate Sherlock’s birthday, which you can view
Next, Sherlock let the sex toy slide all the way out, only to push it back in again. Slowly, but impressively deep.
John’s mouth hangs open as he processes what Sherlock just said. “So… you sabotaged all my dates to be sure that I would become sufficiently sexually frustrated, so you could offer me a blowjob?”
Sherlock, meanwhile, remains completely serious. “I could give you one, if you promise never to complain about the state of the kitchen table ever again, in which case, I will give you a blowjob, right here, right now.”
Sherlock smiled at Bob without replying. Then, as he started to turn away, he said, “I will leave you two to enjoy the rest of your evening now. Order what you like, by the way; it’s on the house. Good-bye.”
Sometimes, John asked Sherlock whether a certain memory was real or just part of his coma dream, and Sherlock would tell John everything he knew about the matter until John was comforted. Several times, Sherlock found John staring at him with eyes full of apprehension and bewilderment, refusing to say what was wrong. Then Sherlock would tell John he loved him, after which John always sighed in relief, and admitted to Sherlock he’d been afraid that had not been real.
Sherlock mirrored him, and they just stroked one another for some time, occasionally planting lazy kisses on the other’s neck or shoulder.
They spoke little during the journey, instead watching the towns, meadows, forests and fields slide by.
John was taken aback by the name for a second, for Sherlock never used his real name, as far as John was aware. “Well, actually, this is his partner speaking,” he said.
John was breathing shallowly, unmistakably nervous now, as he started pulling down Sherlock’s pants as well.
Her smile had still been magic. Her beaming eyes had awoken butterflies in Eurus’ stomach, despite her anger and disappointment.
Once Sherlock felt the ice was broken a little, and the nurse had brought tea and disappeared again, he took a deep breath and turned to a new page. He looked at his brother, a little nervous, and sensed an anticipation that Sherrinford seemed to feel as well.
, if she got in touch out of the blue like that. I never knew when his birthday was, but that’s how I deduced it.” As he said it, John realised he still didn’t know. He would ask him this evening, as soon as he got home.
With thanks to camillo1978 for providing the inspiration for an important plot twist in this chapter!
She swallowed as she watched Sherlock bury his face in John’s neck, kissing him there, probably. He’d done that to her too, and it had felt good, even though it had all been an act on his part (which, in a way, she’d always sensed). But it was definitely no act with John.
Sherlock then carefully took out an old photograph from his inside pocket, which he’d shown to John on the train: of the three Holmes brothers as kids, sitting together on a park bench, each clutching an ice cream. Taken a year before the tragedy, with no hints of the trouble that was to come – at all. They were smiling and seemed completely comfortable in each other’s presence. (Which had just been a snap of the moment, according to Sherlock.)
Once he arrived at the train station, Sherlock walked the by now familiar road to Holdernesse Hall. On the premises, he instantly spotted the contractor and made for his direction. He stood talking to the earl, who was with his back towards Sherlock.
Sherlock asked for the bill. When it arrived, Mycroft tried to offer his card, but Sherlock made a point out of paying this time. Mycroft raised his eyebrows, but said nothing.
He stared blankly but contentedly ahead for a while, satisfied at having found this new clue, then jumped up with new energy and walked into the kitchen – only to find the fridge empty. He decided to drink an entire carton of tomato juice he found in a cupboard instead. The new trains of thought hurtling through his mind provided their own fuel.
Having finished half of her burger, she put the other half back into the bag, for breakfast, and stretched out onto the mattress lying in a corner. She hardly noticed how filthy it was, and if she did, it didn’t matter anyway.
Once they and their luggage were all inside, though, the atmosphere suddenly changed to business-like.
Just then, he becomes aware of the fact that Sherlock’s cock is becoming flaccid and the condom is about to slip off. John rests a hand on Sherlock’s hip so as not to startle him, before whispering, “I’m just going to take this off for you, alright?” After carefully, though somewhat clumsily, removing the condom with his other hand (not wanting to move the one on Sherlock’s hip), he sloppily throws the thing in the sink behind him.
was interesting. Sherlock made a mental note of bringing in Saheed as a witness when the moment arrived.
“Got Molly to handle the post mortem,” Greg said. “She will let me see the draft report before making it final.” He nervously ran a hand through his hair. “I told her… not to include
They were going to go in there and choose the rings that would designate them as a couple till death did them part.
“Nope. Your health is more important than some Christian tradition that was stolen from the pagans anyway. Also, they got the date wrong. The return of the light was actually the day before yesterday, when we had the thing with the peas, which was lovely. Now, off to bed with you.”
Afterwards, in his anger and frustration, Sherlock had occasionally fantasised about doing the same thing back at him: to have Middlehurst helpless and at his mercy while he furiously pounded into him, seeking revenge and relief at the same time.
Just then, Sherlock started pretending to gradually come to and he blinked around in feigned surprise.
“Uneventful,” Sherlock said with a tentative smile, briefly carding his fingers through John’s soft hair. He loved it when John asked about his day, even if nothing at all interesting had happened. “I missed you,” he said, tugging at the hem of John’s coat to persuade him to sit down next to him.
“We have all the time in the world,” Sherlock said, his voice soft. “We can sit here as long as we like.”
He fervidly put all his energy and focus into making neat piles on his desk with things to keep, things to work on and things to throw away. It felt good. Especially because the latter pile was growing steadily.
So I actually finished writing the first draft of this chapter during last August’s Fic Writers’ Retreat in Canada. Such fond memories!
Many, many thanks once more to Ariane DeVere for her indispensable transcripts of the show, to Jonathan for Brit-picking the entire thing from beginning to end, to my meticulous grammar and language beta mydogwatson for improving both this fic and my knowledge of the English language, and to my plot betas mamaorion, 88thparallel, camillo1978 and thelanding for beta’ing different parts of the story and helping me make it flow so much more smoothly.
“Alright,” John said. He swallowed. He and Harry had a difficult relationship, and he wasn’t really bursting with enthusiasm to ask her over, but he himself had suggested they get to know each other’s family, after all.
John thought for a bit. Just then, for the first time in three days, he could feel his stomach rumble. He put his phone down and decided to reply later. Right now, he really needed to eat something. That, he could arrange himself.
Sherlock nodded eagerly as he tried to kiss John at the same time, almost bumping their chins and noses and making them laugh through the tension.
Janine nodded, realising full well he probably wasn’t talking about physical rest. “Yeah, besides the recovery from your coma, I imagine that, um…” She hesitated. “I imagine that Mary’s deceit is also something you’ll need a long time to get over,” she ventured. “I understand. Still not over it myself. She managed to get
(All in the context of assuming that TFP is just John's coma dream, of course, and that Eurus lied to John about being Sherlock's sibling, just before shooting him at the end of TLD.)
In response, Sherlock teasingly licked the ridge of his auricle, before whispering, “Tell me what it is you want, John.”
ask how many cases he’d solved in the past six months, and how many he hadn’t, but not what sort of cases they had been or whether he enjoyed his work. How he was. It would never occur to her to ask such questions. The ones that mattered.
He remembered their little adventure with the Trepoff murder and the seven clocks that he’d never posted about. Could be interesting, after all.
Mycroft’s jaw dropped and his eyebrows moved closer together – as if seeking comfort in each other. When he finally closed his mouth again, he swallowed hard and looked away.
Sherlock laughed. “That must be it!” Then, fondly grinning, he reached his hand towards John’s across the table and John took it, gently rubbing his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles.
James jerked his head around and widened his eyes at the sight of what Sherlock was holding out to him. As he snatched it from Sherlock’s hand, Sherlock asked jokingly, in a low voice, “So, have you nicked any other nice souvenirs from the house, eh?”
No pattern to be seen. Except lots of deaths in his hospital. No surprise there. Who would ever notice an occasional extra death? Brilliant, really.
Sherlock kissed him back just as frantically. Then he rolled over on top of John, pushing him into the mattress with his full weight as he continued to lick needily into John’s mouth. After a while, when they were quite out of breath, Sherlock sat up and straddled John, trapping John’s prick between his arse cheeks. He then began to teasingly undulate his hips.
-- It’s me. (New number, just in case.) The man with the sock index, in case you wanted evidence. (You haven’t told anybody about that, have you??) S
As the meaning of Sherlock’s reaction dawned on John, there suddenly seemed to be oxygen in the room again, which he only then realised had appeared to have gone missing for a while.
It was just a matter of waiting till the storm had passed. Until he wasn’t expected to mourn his wife so much anymore, and his guilt over shooting her (and having allowed his aunt to take the blame) had faded a little and didn’t come crashing down over him in such unexpectedly big waves any longer – and then he could pick up his life from there.
This was a momentous proposal; it meant that John wanted them to be a real family. Under the law. And of course John was sure, or he would not have asked. With a hilariously appropriate ring, even.
“Sherlock? Why are you wearing ladies’ underwear?” John didn’t sound half as excited as Sherlock had expected him to be.
John closed his eyes, trying to think of what ulterior motive Sherlock might have to be so interested and helpful right now.
He could easily say he hadn’t read the memory stick, as there had just been some student assignments on it, which he definitely hadn’t read.
But especially Rosie’s reaction gave them a lump in their throats. When Hannah eventually turned to walk towards the car waiting for her with the last of her bags, Rosie stretched her little arms out to her and angrily yelled, “No! No!”
He was sitting in the front section, facing the aisle, while she was sitting a little more towards the back. Once she’d caught his eye, she smiled at him shyly, then looked away and bit her lower lip.
turning out to be a fake as well! God, I can’t imagine the trauma. And her shooting you on top of that, it’s more than any sane person would be able to handle, John. You deserve a break. A proper break.”
“Yeah, that was indeed, incredibly moronic of him,” John acknowledged. He nodded and remained silent for a bit.
“Your room there will be smaller. Have you decided yet which paintings you will take with you? And what to do with others?”
No one to lessen the feeling of guilt that had unmistakably surfaced on the second day and intermittently took hold of him, after some of the initial shock had worn off.
John lowered the door handle and pushed forward, but the door didn’t open. He rattled the handle a couple of times, then frantically looked along the corridor.
John nodded, contemplating cracking a joke about being sure to make note of it if he saw an especially nice one. Instead, he decided to do that with a look, which did not escape Sherlock’s notice and elicited a half-heartedly hidden smile that sent wonderful shivers down John’s spine.
This was it. They were about to go to his bedroom and do it, Sherlock knew. He felt a strange calmness descend over him and he gently took hold of John’s hand. “Come on,” he whispered.
Disconcertingly, John didn’t actually know whether Harry had read or heard somehow that their own aunt had been convicted for killing John’s wife. Their last contact had been a condolence card she’d sent him from Russia, four months ago. He could only hope that if she did know, she wouldn’t be inclined to talk about this too elaborately when she came over.
Writing this fix-it has been really therapeutic for me, and I hope that reading it has had a similar effect on you as a reader.
Sherlock tried hard not to roll his eyes, or to yell. “His latest painting hardly matters,” he said, tensely. “I hadn’t seen him
of him. But how could he ever touch Sherlock like that now that he knew that that same act had once been traumatic to him? How could he ever do the very thing to him again that that monster of a teacher had done?
The sun was standing low and cast its slowly dwindling light through the branches of the trees, which were starting to lose their first leaves.
Sherlock had actually dozed off, and had to try hard to activate his brain. But while picking up, he did groggily realise that his battery was dying and that he might get cut off any moment. Bugger.
He tried to focus on his breathing to keep calm, which worked to some extent. Until another incoming text pulled his attention back to his phone.
Unsure of what to do, John sat back down and opened his blog, deciding almost immediately to close it again. After all, what could he write on there? After having been occupied with two subsequent secret missions for months, eliminating first Mary (Rosamund bloody Moran) and then Eurus (Moran’s sodding ex-lover), he and Sherlock were now busy settling into a normal, domestic life, taking care of a baby and learning sign language.
In a flash of clarity, he stayed in exactly the same position and continued to talk into the phone, pretending to not see the book his gaze was fixed upon, and hoping that thereby the owner wouldn’t notice it lying opened on the desk either. “Yes, thank you so much. Sorry again.”
A melancholic expression passed over his brother’s face. “Same as always, I suppose. Hard to tell.” He pursed his lips. “Why don’t you visit him yourself?”
As they walked to the tube station, shoulder to shoulder, John asked, “What shall we have engraved in them, then? Just the usual – date, names – or something… less boring?”
(John had managed to convince Mary he’d better let his flu run its course at Baker Street, so as not to pass on his bugs to her while she was heavily pregnant. The real reason was that his nerves had worn so thin that he’d needed continuous visual proof that Sherlock was really back; that it wasn’t just a dream.)
Sherlock walked over to the kitchen and stood next to where John was sitting. He took the items out of the bag, placing them in front of John on the table: scones from John’s favourite bakery across town, with his preferred brands of clotted cream and strawberry jam from Sainsbury’s to go with them. “For you.”
“Sir, I don’t think we allow non-patients to ever occupy any beds. You can arrange for a guard at the door, if we receive such a request through the appropriate channels.”
They took turns carrying Rosie strapped to their back. Around every two hours, they took a break for coffee, lunch or cinnamon buns, enjoying Norwegian hospitality. Also, Rosie still needed her regular daytime naps, of course, for which John took her back to the hotel and sat in the room with her, plotting his book as she slept, while Sherlock continued searching alone. When she woke, John and Rosie joined him again, until eventually dusk set in once more.
John hugged him a bit tighter, letting out a long breath. “Then we have more in common than we thought.”
After a short silence, John added softly, sounding almost as if there was the beginning of a lump in his throat, “Sherlock, in a relationship you should never do anything you’re uncomfortable with, you know; that’s not how it works.”
Closing the door, John lifted the phone to his ear and headed back down the hall. “When did Sherlock give you this address?” he asked Smith.
“Wednesday morning I booked today’s session. Now, today is Friday. So two weeks ago – two weeks before you were abducted and brought here against your will...”
of the whole thing. Apparently, his tweet had not gone unnoticed, by far. The level of organisation it must have taken to build an ad campaign based on the accusation, though, and turning it on its head like this, especially
Now that they had, it had definitely added a new layer to their relationship. John felt sure he wouldn’t see Sherlock the same way after tonight and his feelings for him had impossibly intensified because of it.
This was not just about the thrill of solving puzzles, John knew. He wasn’t sure whether it was a matter of really
“Yeah, which then increasingly turned into personal banter, from where one thing led to another. She was suddenly just… very open, it seemed. No longer as ridiculously shy as she always used to be.”
At least he and Sherlock had already proven they could live together. John had had all the surprises there were to have – from heads in the fridge to indoor shooting exercises – although the thing with Sherlock was, of course, that he kept astonishing you in new ways all the time. But perhaps that was why John had fallen in love with him in the first place.
He quickly shook those thoughts away. He had long promised himself he’d make sure John would never feel like that again. What was more, he now had the new privilege of actively making John
someone that nasty and devious was a Moriarty. How could he ever have believed she was a Holmes? And Mary’s lover, for Christ’s sake. Flip-flopping between genders. “I’m going to have even stranger dreams now, you know,” he remarked drily.
“John had forgotten that we had a training scheduled for this afternoon,” he went on, smirking. “That’s why he called you.”
“Marvellous!” his mother exclaimed. “I’m so glad you’ve figured out a way to use that strange invention. And to teach
. This was something he wouldn’t wish for his worst enemy, and knowing that someone had done that to Sherlock, to
There was only one way. He needed to do research, and then practice. Since he’d managed to get to grips with a rather elaborate variety of skills in his life, he was confident he should be able to master this one.
“Ah.” There was a silence. “Do we have to do this? I know that it undoubtedly occupies your thoughts, but is this really necessary? He couldn’t help himself back then, Sherlock. There’s no point in dwelling on the consequences of other people’s intractable, extreme emotions, brother mine. You should focus on keeping your own in check.” He sounded tired. “Solve the case you’re working on. Your biggest and most important case to date.”
The inspiration for Sherlock's relationship with his parents is based on my own experience. My parents both have autism (Asperger's), and I only realised they did after I had myself tested for autism and was told, to my great surprise and confusion, that I didn't have it. Then how come I had all these typically autistic traits, making my life difficult?? Ah.
And shortly afterwards, only a week into his recovery of his bullet wound to the chest, he’d moved heaven and earth to show John who his wife really was and encouraged them to
slept, he’d had this godawful dream where he was the one carrying a gun in the Aquarium instead of John, and in his attempt to shoot Moran, he accidentally killed John instead. The bullet, meanwhile, also broke the glass of one of the tanks, and the next moment, Sherlock was drowning in the water that kept flooding in, with John floating underwater in a cloud of blood just out of reach, and sharks hovering around the both of them, flashing their toothy grins as they drew nearer.
I then spent several weeks trying to think of a scenario in which it made sense for Sherlock and Mycroft to have referred to ‘The East Wind’ from early youth (as was stated in His Last Vow), without them having had a secret superpower sister.
The second time Sherlock sucked John off, he had lasted a bit longer and Sherlock had been able to at least practice this new skill a little.
They were both grinning like a couple of teenagers when Sherlock stepped towards the edge of the pavement to hail a cab.
None of this would of course have been necessary if Sherlock had actually had any damned proof that it had been Mary who’d shot him, in the first place. But to his utmost frustration, he didn’t. (Obviously, his own statement would not have been worth a penny, after he'd suffered severe internal bleeding, almost died on the operating table and spent several hours unconscious and under the influence of heavy painkillers and other medication. There was no chance in hell that a judge would have taken him at his word if he'd said that he remembered it was Mary who shot him. Besides, for the court of law, a mere statement was never enough anyway. However, as was to be expected, the idiots of Scotland Yard naturally had found
Sherlock had had no idea that this was what it would feel like. John’s mouth was soft and warm, and with it he was doing things to him that he hadn’t known were possible; alternately licking, kissing and sucking different parts (and all of them) of his prick.
He pictured John’s naked torso as he’d seen it during their summers as flatmates, on the occasions when John hadn’t bothered to put on a bathrobe coming out of the shower. Sherlock then pictured them both naked, embracing, John running his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and down his body, lower and lower. He arched his back on the sofa and pressed a hand over his groin. But as soon as he imagined himself bending over a table with John behind him, all of a sudden he was fourteen again and back in the geography store room at St. James’s, tears of pain rolling down his cheeks.
single parents managed to do the job, when parenting with just the two of them was already so much more of a challenge than it had been with three.
“Well, this most definitely isn’t just an experiment to me,” John reassured. He stroked Sherlock’s back, secretly pleased that he was worried about this. Thankfully, they were on the same page. “And we’ve known each other for quite a while, so I’m pretty sure neither of us has any surprise secrets in store that could change anything.”
, as promising to do so afterwards would only be counterproductive, I fear.” He was barely managing to keep a straight face himself by this point. “So will you
The room started to fade a bit and the skin in his face was tingling unpleasantly. Sherlock tried to focus on breathing normally, but didn’t even seem to manage this simplest of tasks.
While he had the most wonderful memories of their first night together, he did frequently think back in bewilderment about Sherlock’s initial suggestion to actually shag, and John was still rather puzzled as to why Sherlock had insisted when he was so obviously uncomfortable about it. But in the end they’d had amazing sex anyway without penetration, and ever since, John felt as if he was floating a foot above the ground.
, the question mark had no meaning to his brother. He then pointed his pencil at the empty space left and right of the dog, and looked at Sherrinford expectantly.
want to... get inside you, believe me. God, I can’t image a single thing that’s hotter,” he said, his voice slightly shaky. Then he exhaled slowly, steadying his breath. “But at the same time, if you didn’t want to do it, that would be
It was quite clear that neither Sherlock nor John was ever going to get any useful information out of the bastard, while at the same time the man was a walking time bomb full of explosive material, which he was evidently only ever going to use to make the world a worse place. So, after adding up all those things, Sherlock had decided to quite literally give his life for John, by taking Magnussen’s life and thereby ensuring that Mary’s enemies wouldn’t ever be able to harm John.
“Well, I’m quite sure he does. And remember, I’ve learnt a few tricks in observation from Mr Consulting Detective here.” He smiled at her and she smiled back, still shy.
Sherlock’s body. He still couldn’t believe that Sherlock was letting him do this. John was very well aware that it could potentially be extremely painful if Sherlock wasn’t completely relaxed.
For twenty years, Sherlock Holmes had been nothing but a story, a myth, and Jim had become steadily more and more busy running his empire from the centre of his clever web.
John gaped at him. “I wrote that on my blog,” he then said, astounded. “Well, not literally. But back in June, I made up that story about Mary recording a DVD and sending it to you after her death, telling you to
The tension of being about to find out whether the tape ball actually contained an invaluable missing pearl made everything seem unreal.
Sherlock had always been convinced it was because they’d wanted to rule out his brother harming him again. Apparently not.
“I understand.” John cleared his throat. “Listen. Why don’t you go and spend some more time with him, then? We could go today, if you like.”
He didn’t know which had been the most unexpected. What Eurus had done had, in fact, been no surprise whatsoever. It was exactly the reason why Irene lived with them. And she’d handled the situation brilliantly.
Once they had relocated to the centre, John bent down to softly kiss Sherlock’s chest, then moved up to his neck, by the end of which he finally ended up stretched out on top of Sherlock.
Watson, trusted Sherlock unconditionally. He was going to marry this man and give him the rest of his life, and that thought didn’t scare him half as much as it probably should. If Sherlock would fuck him right now, he would be okay with it.
Having John on top of him, the weight of his sturdy frame wonderfully pressing down on Sherlock, making him feel revered and safe, Sherlock needed… he wanted… he desperately wanted
At Hopkins’s raised eyebrows, he clarified, “That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there’s hair growing in his ears. So it’s a superficial job, then. But he got his eyes fixed. His hands were steady. He pulled the trigger. He killed Evans.”
Luckily, whenever John was at 221B nowadays, Sherlock would continuously keep John’s mind occupied with either elaborate narratives about his latest case, new scientific theories, or ravings about the stupidity of humanity – or one particular specimen thereof. John’s memory of the endless Sundays in their era as flatmates, during which they would just laze around the flat for hours, seemed like a lifetime ago – including the occasional infuriatingly long silences that John had pretended did not drive him up the walls.
Suddenly, everything felt simple again. John was here and hugging him back. Soon, their mouths found each other and a minute later, they were passionately kissing, snogging properly for the first time and pressing their bodies together without restraint.
Initially, it had felt surprisingly purgative to cry together uninhibitedly; to finally give in and show his tears to someone – and especially to see
In one corner of that empty void in his heart, he distinctly felt a strong paternal affection for Rosie, but otherwise, nothing. Not even guilt.
He went into the back – again ignoring the attempts of the owner to point out there was also a phone on the counter – then quickly grabbed the handset from the desk to hold between his chin and shoulder in case the man unexpectedly came in again, and dove straight at the book of purchase. Meanwhile, he conducted a fake conversation aloud to cancel the ambulance.
The girl thought hard at this, then remembered. “Yes, actually. Once he got into a conversation that sounded like an argument, with another guy on the street. I quickly walked on, glad to have lost him.”
Then it was as if a giant cogwheel in his head turned ninety degrees and he was suddenly able to see from a new angle. From there, he could almost literally hear things click into place, as he deduced what was going on.
Sherlock looked up when Lestrade came back into his office and rummaged through his papers – cursing when he spilled some coffee over them. As the DI hastily dabbed at the brown stains with a paper napkin, Sherlock’s mind wandered to the close and virtually flawless cooperation he’d had with John over the past months. He’d had to learn how to communicate properly, as John had demanded he shared every bit of information he had at all times – or John would simply stop everything they’d been doing, sit Sherlock down and stare him straight in the eye, saying only, “You promised.”
John watched Sherlock as he sat completely motionless, lost in thought, the light of the flames dancing over his face. John’s eyes lingered on the soft shadow under the curve of Sherlock’s jaw, below his ear, where marble skin subsided into the shaded smoothness of skin pulled taut over the tendon of his slender neck.
Obviously he’d never done anything like this with another man before either. Maybe he was worried that it wasn’t going to be as good as with a woman. Sherlock could only hope his preparations would prove to be enough in order for him not to disappoint John.
John helped him up, focussing hard on making believe he didn’t know this man, which would have been quite a challenge even before anything had happened between them.
“Hi, I’m er… I’m on a plane,” the girl told him, “and, er, I’m in the loo right now so no one can hear me.” She sounded upset. On the verge of panic.
John pressed his lips together, trying hard not to overly display his arousal. This could be him. This could be him, sliding in and out of Sherlock.
John very slowly pushed in a bit more, then stopped again, until Sherlock nodded that it was okay to go deeper. Once he was past the first sphincter, he slid in so easily it made him blink.
John shifted forward in his seat. “No, you’ve met Sherlock exactly once. In this room. He was off his head.”
Sherlock sat at the kitchen table and texted John to let him know he’d safely arrived at his parents’ house.
They both kept smiling all the way back to Baker Street, where Sherrinford was staying another night.
John was strictly speaking only there to observe and to provide backup if things should escalate, but this was too good an opportunity to ignore. “Oh! Yes, I heard! He… she died, right? A member of your club?” John said sympathetically. “Awful business, just awful.”
“Next stop Trondheim, right?” John said. “Is that it, then? Should we book a flight back to London for the day after tomorrow?”
He fell head-first into the big black hole of supreme ecstasy as his movements started to falter and his vocal chords randomly activated themselves of their own accord entirely.
Just a few types of alien molecules added to his organism, disrupting the natural balance between thousands of endogenous biochemical compounds in his nervous system and beyond; turning him into an unreliable loose projectile. Just like John’s dad and sister, when they were on booze.
John had taken the trouble of refreshing his memory on this about every two hours, with a cheeky grin and sometimes even a sodding
“Exactly what the abductor wants you to think. This is a planted clue. The box is not wet enough to have been here since Monday night and also, it smells of litter. Who would ever keep carrying around empty medicine boxes anyway?” He smiled. The hound had finally found a trail.
Extraordinary, how his brother lived in a world of images, with a complete lack of context or additional information. Presumably, he saw things on television or in books, but did he know that the desert was hot? That the panda he’d painted earlier was on the verge of extinction?
John disbelievingly shook his head and looked at him, suddenly feeling immensely grateful and proud. “I’m so glad you did.”
Sherlock needed surprisingly few strokes before his semen spurted against John’s chest. John had seen him come quite a number of times by now, but nothing like this before. The intensity with which he knitted his brows together, wrinkling his forehead and grunting out John’s name, sent a beautiful chill down John’s spine. (Making John awkwardly slip out of him in the process.)
He waited as long as he could before waking him up, until the moment he genuinely feared for the cartilage connecting his ribs. “Sherlock, love,” he then said softly.
And of course it took a bloody genius like Sherlock to learn how to give the most amazing frigging blowjobs John had ever had, within
“Long stay'd he so. At last, a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down, he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being: that done, he lets me go.”
“Her English isn’t entirely flawless, I’m afraid.” Lestrade shrugged. “But still better than my Italian, anyway.”
It took several seconds before anything happened, during which an increasingly enthusiastic director fed her the dialogue lines of Polonius, and she replied with verve.
When he arrived back in 221B, John found Sherlock in exactly the same position as when he’d left, only now he was sitting in his chair next to the fireplace. Against expectation, he opened his eyes as soon as John came in, a faint smile flickering over his face by way of greeting. John walked over to him and briefly pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, at which Sherlock cupped John’s face with both hands, unwilling to let go. They gazed into each other’s eyes for a bit with their noses touching and their smiles increasing, before Sherlock settled on a last peck and let him go. John plonked down across from him.
“Well, it seems fairly obvious that, at least initially, once one of them had discovered that their boss’s lovely young niece in the UK was going to inherit his fortune in the not so distant future, the plan arose to try and marry her for the money. Perhaps they were both in on it, perhaps not. If it was single-handedly Bob’s idea, it would make sense that he’d start dating her, but not that he lost interest while at the same time still following her around. If it was Jack’s idea, the coming on to her makes sense, as does Bob’s following her assuming that he wants to shield her from him once he’s found out what his mate is up to. But in that case, he could also just tell her. And since he is the one who made contact with her in the first place, he can’t be that innocent. Another option is that they are in this together, thereby increasing the chance that one of them will succeed in winning her heart. They might have agreed to split the profit if it works.”
If it weren’t for Sherlock’s withdrawal symptoms still wreaking havoc in his body and, to a lesser extent, in his mind, everything would be perfect.
“No,” Sherlock said wistfully, pretending once more to be upset by her passing (which he actually was, but for a very different reason), “none at all.”
They didn’t talk much, and it took John some time to notice that Sherlock was being decidedly more distant than he had been at the restaurant. He seemed lost in thought and kept looking away, a permanent frown on his face. Could his mind still be on the case? John thought it was pretty much solved and finished now, but there was no telling what else Sherlock had in mind.
John kept asking, very concernedly, and clearly overwhelmed, if it was still okay, as he slowly, wonderfully slid into him.
Once there were plates, forks and knives laid out, Sherlock looked around, slightly bewildered. “Have we got everything?”
“I think,” Mycroft intervened, his brows knitted together in an alarmed frown, “for the purpose of clarity, he didn’t mean ‘talking’ altogether, just talking about your specific view of their personal situation.”
He’d looked at the map a hundred times in the past couple of weeks. Could his eyes have fallen on the curious name of this village before, just without registering it consciously? Could his brain then have provided the link with Mary’s sense of humour in his dreams?
He looked at the fishing boats on the horizon, pointing them out to Chloe, as Sherlock valiantly plucked on, softly cursing every so often.
“It has always been you,” John continued, barely keeping his voice from breaking, “even since before I was fully aware of it, and always will be. So I’m going to kiss you now. And if you like it, just copy what I do, alright?”
John turned out to be the only one there. He asked how the interrogation had gone and Sherlock replied reassuringly.
Also, the ICU was a busier place than he’d expected, bustling with nurses’ activity and noise throughout the night.
Quick as lightning, Sherlock tried to think of plausible ways to talk himself out of this. But he was severely distracted by the fact that her personality seemed completely opposite to what he’d seen of her before. She was at ease and smiling.
“STOP LAUGHING AT ME!” And then, Sherlock surged forward towards Smith with the scalpel aimed at him.
But if Harry had not bothered to keep in contact, it wasn’t exactly his responsibility to tell her, was it?
He snorted out a laugh at his reflection and started scavenging Hannah’s make-up bag for some dark brown eyeshadow and a brush. Thankfully, after finding some, he soon managed to restore something of a semblance of his usual broad, low eyebrows. They would grow back in a couple of weeks, he told himself.
, especially one who’d been terrorising the household since before I was born.” He scoffed. “Initially, they even used to make up pretexts when they went to see him. It didn’t take me long, however, before I realised that ’poor old aunty Jane’ didn’t actually exist.”
“Alright, I'll be right on it, in a minute. Listen, this is some crazy case. We might need some of your help later on.”
“Sod this,” he cursed, as he switched apps and used his browser history to tune in to the live audio connection again.
During the nights, they snuggled together in bed, politely ignoring each other's occasional erections, knowing that their time would come. Whenever things did tend to get a little more heated and their kisses would deepen, John would instantly get the most ghastly of headaches, so they quickly learned not to do that. Although John was rather frustrated about not being well enough to do much just yet, Sherlock’s lack of experience was another good reason to take it slow anyway, John thought.
John was still looking a bit startled at what he’d just blurted out, apparently not knowing where to look, and flopped down next to him on the bed, avoiding Sherlock’s gaze.
He walked over to the little corner with the electric kettle and a small stack of tea cups, and boiled some water.
John firmly wrapped one arm around Smith’s neck from behind and quickly bundled him away from the bed, shouting, “
Sherlock swallowed. “Alright,” he agreed. “I’ll tell you what.” He squinted at the trees in the distance. “Let’s go home, take off these ridiculous disguises and then we can sit down and I will tell you everything.”
“And while we’re there,” Sherlock went on, “I need you to help me find out on which days the guy gets his gold supplies from our South African duo.”
Now that they were more open and intimate with each other, John kept discovering more layers to Sherlock that had been hidden previously. Like his fascination with bees, his love of dancing, and his rather impressive artistic ability.
“Anyway, this old pal, Ajay, was after her and wanted revenge, because he thought she’d been the one to betray their mission,” Sherlock went on. “He was looking for the pen drive so he could trace her. I told her this, upon which she fled to Morocco. We followed her, but unfortunately Ajay followed
This chapter was initially part of the previous one, but my new plot beta Amanda very wisely advised me to split that outrageously long original chapter in two. That’s why this new chapter was finished so quickly after the last one. :)
Positioning himself between James and his only way out, Sherlock deduced, “You got attached to this house very quickly, Mr Wilder. Although I’m sure you would like to be addressed as Beverly.” At James’ furious expression, Sherlock said, “Oh, had you already sent your ransom letter? Don’t worry, nobody told me. The situation was quite clear from the coat of arms on your old handkerchief, which you keep with you at all times. When, by coincidence, you came to work here, you recognised the same image above the entrance and realised you were working for your own father. You heard of the other son and couldn’t stand the idea that he would inherit all this and you would get nothing. So you abducted him, by sending him a letter that you pretended was from his mum, to lure him out of his dorm in the dead of night. Once you realised that the letter had been found and had put the police on Edith Beverly’s track, together with the fortunate coincidence of the shawl, which the boy kept in much the same fashion as you did your handkerchief, you probably decided this was an ideal distraction for you to be able to quietly send the ransom letter. You planted another clue, fishing a medicine box out of the garbage bins on the estate. I imagine you thought it would suit Edith well getting the blame, as she got what your own mother never had.”
That was nice, Vivian thought. And she closed her eyes. At this point in her life, it was just nice to be…
John put the knife down to take the present from him and sat back down on his chair to unwrap it, under six pairs of watchful eyes.
Sherlock decided not to mention the other parts that were coming back to him then, like the bit where he made John believe he didn’t know how to switch off the bomb they’d found in the tube carriage, when they had been preventing the attack on the Palace of Westminster two years ago.
In the following seconds, which appeared to stretch into eternity, he could still feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, and John’s eyes couldn’t seem to stop flicking back and forth between him and unfocused random points around the room. Even though it was just a sideways glance, John felt glued to the back of his seat, pinned down by the intensity of the one grey eye fixed on him. Jesus Christ, why was it so hard to push away the mental images that were flooding his mind? Sherlock hovering over him, really close, while John was on his back and Sherlock’s hips were pressing- - No,
John had been bound to find out Sherlock had another brother sooner or later. He really should have just told John. Just like he should have told John he loved him, ages ago. Surely John hadn’t started feeling like that just last week.
Good news: I’m now no longer as hellishly busy at work as I have been the past six months, so I really hope to be able to go back to my initial posting schedule of 2 updates a month. :D
After he’d heard the short version of the story that was now the official account, Lestrade called in his team. There had been a murder, after all.
It didn’t take him long to see the pattern. If he was being completely honest, all these tweets of his were, well, rather smug.
was interested?” Sherlock scoffed. “I was, you know,” he said softly. “The whole time.” His voice reduced to a whisper. “But I never allowed myself to even
“Just keep doing what you’re doing already and you’re good,” John said, with a clear lump in his throat as well.
to love you. And believe me, I’ve tried. Too many times.” There was a sadness behind his eyes that made John need to look away. Forcing his gaze back after a moment, he whispered hoarsely, “Same here.” He squeezed Sherlock’s hand, that was still in his. “Shall we promise to each other that we will never again try not to love the other, ever? Whatever ridiculous situation we might end up in?”
Once they were sat down and provided with tea and a serving stand filled with all sorts of delicious snacks, John leaned back in his chair, pursing his lips before speaking. “So you had made this reservation for us then. Not for a case.”
“I decided to quit, actually,” John stated, to Janine’s surprise. “I might eventually start subbing again occasionally, you know, as replacement for colleagues who are ill or on leave. I don’t know. But my aunt left me some money, and I realised I need rest, for the time being.”
“Remarkably cute.” John blushed, not caring that he did. He looked Sherlock in the eye, but Sherlock only held his gaze for a second, before he focused shyly on his scone again.
“Not at all, Your Lordship,” Sherlock said, moving closer. “With the police so diligently running after her all around France, I thought I’d focus on alternative theories, closer to home. When the box turned up, it was instantly clear to me that it was a planted clue to try and have me start running after the same shadow.” He glared at the phone. “Did the police not tell you that the box could not possibly have been dropped there by Edith herself? It was not moistened by dew, even though it had supposedly been there for two nights, and it smelled of garbage. It has to have been fished out of your rubbish bins yesterday at the earliest. Which is why I would very much like to visit Holdernesse Hall again first thing tomorrow, if convenient.”
about personal matters now and then – rather than just sticking solely to factual topics of conversation and winging the rest by trying to be clever and merely making deductions all the time (and occasionally getting very important stuff spectacularly wrong).
The taxi ride to Hounslow was about as embarrassing as John had imagined it would be. The driver kept throwing amused glances at them in the rear view mirror, while Sherlock was busy on his phone as if nothing was out of the ordinary.
For over a week, he had withheld all forms of physical affection not only because he felt confused and guilty over the way he had touched Sherlock previously, or because he felt blinding anger rise inside of him whenever he was reminded of what that bastard had done to his Sherlock, but also – if he was completely honest – because he was afraid of getting an erection and ending up in a sexual situation, which was simply an absolute no-go for him at the moment. So he tossed himself off in the shower, thinking about nothing except his own prick and his need to climax in the most abstract way imaginable. Afterwards, he felt empty and possibly even more guilty than he already had.
“Hello, Mr Putting-The-Baker-In-Baker-Street,” Sherlock teased, as he wrapped his arms around John from behind and smelled his hair. His favourite kind of John-hug.
The nurse interrupted them with her check-ups, but John didn’t mind. He and Sherlock kept looking at each other while she was busy, stealing furtive glances and smiles.
, and that fact alone was amazing and overwhelming. Being this close together, as one, was worth more than a little physical discomfort. Also, John was desperate to feel something,
Sherlock absently chewed his biscuit as he allowed the scene to roll out in his mind once more. This case was almost as important as the Moriarty one, after all, even though it might not be as urgent. He figured he might as well allow his mind to wander a little, especially seeing as he wasn’t getting anywhere with the other one at the moment anyway.
with autism – a subject on which there were more books than there were underground stations in London – but a possibly equal number of people have
about Sherlock and me now,” he then said, still a little shyly, clearly not yet used to talking about it openly. “We were keeping it secret from one nasty individual in particular, but it has turned out she knows already anyway.” He shrugged.
Thankfully, though, no one listened to him, and Carl’s missing shoes, containing the poison that killed him, were never discovered.
They only made John’s admiration for the man grow. Besides which, John loved the way all those things brought a dazzling sparkle to Sherlock’s eye, once he no longer felt the need to hide such interests.
The GPS trail showed that Mary (Rosamund) had first flown to Oslo, then Ørsta-Volda Airport, Hovden, after which she’d travelled up north via Norddal, towards the Trondheim area.
Having it be rather lovely to have Harry over, however, was probably the most unforeseen event of the day. They hadn’t bickered or disagreed on anything. She hadn’t been annoyed by him, or by Sherlock or Rosie, for that matter. And hearing her talk about her work had been rather inspiring.
He’d once offered her one when she was having trouble sleeping and he’d been annoyed by her insomnia (during the charade that was their “relationship”), and it had worked like a charm. She knew exactly which drawer they were in and how to get to it, even in the dark. Surely it wouldn’t hurt to quietly sneak in and take one? They were bound to be fast asleep by now anyway.
is not an advantage.” And, “The East Wind will be coming to get you, again and again; it seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the earth.”
Very slowly, a sense of normality was creeping back into their lives, and it made John feel like he could breathe again.
He took a step back from the worktop. “Obviously, I am,” he added, his eyes fluttering all over the kitchen cupboards as he spoke, as if he were merely saying he couldn’t remember where he’d put the salt.
His landlady was in the process of baking a cake as he entered her kitchen. She was just pouring some honey onto a table spoon above the bowl with batter. “Oh
Although… were those last two things really facts? Nobody had actually seen it happen, had they? The nanny had seen part of it, but only from a distance.
being out of touch with you, John,” Mycroft said sternly. “Please don’t ever try it again. Unless you mean it.”
Sherlock, who had stopped translating, turned to Sherrinford and signed, “Never mind her; she’s just talking nonsense. Count yourself lucky you can’t hear her rambling.”
Sherlock sat up rather stiffly, while apparently making an effort to sound breezy – without much success.
Of course, this wasn’t really any wonder at all. The deceit the man had suffered from as many as three different women whom he’d allowed into his closest personal sphere – and who had turned out to be only two different, but very dangerous individuals in reality – was more than anyone would be able to bear. And while the first instance of deceit was already reason enough for him to go back into therapy, his cursed fake therapist shooting him had obviously depleted any remaining mental resilience he might have had left.
Sherlock just stared at him in the dim light. A high frown had formed on his forehead. “I think the same is true the other way round,” he said eventually, his voice soft.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John for a moment and bit his lip in a radiant smile, before dropping his head back on the pillow with a thud.
Sherlock’s brain went into overdrive, like a swarm of bees on the first warm day of spring. John was safely at his therapist’s now, Sherlock knew that much, but he needed to warn him. The session would end any minute and then he would walk out onto the street, unprotected.
The pitiful bandit mumbled something unintelligibly. Maybe it was Norwegian. Either way, he was clearly high as a kite.
That was exactly the moment his last shred of love for her had vanished, quite precisely. The first very, very large crack in their bond having appeared the minute he realised it was
Sherlock had already tossed himself off once, as soon as he had gotten undressed, and now, as he lay awake, considered doing it again, but decided against it. He was too distracted by his own thoughts.
He desperately needed to come up with a plan to defeat her. Although who knew, maybe The Yard or Mycroft’s agents would finally, for once, do a proper job and get her behind bars without his help.
Sherlock held two fingers to John’s carotid artery to check his pulse, which was regular. The only blood Sherlock could see were some tiny, microscopic droplets coming out of a small, red spot on his forehead, where his skin was slightly damaged.
But at least, since Eurus’s arrest, they were no longer obliged to lock themselves inside the house at all times, like before. Hannah regularly went out to visit her own family, though only when Daniel could come up to replace her; on Mycroft’s orders. But there was no one to stop Sherlock going out to the supermarket, the dry-cleaner’s, or the hairdresser. To Sherlock’s initial surprise, it felt wonderful to suddenly be able to do such daily chores again which he’d previously always found mundane and boring, because of the immense relief of no longer having to look over his shoulder throughout.
Sherlock was in one of his meditative poses on the sofa but noticed John already before he’d even closed the door behind him.
However, the mere thought of that possibility almost instantly sent him over the edge, spilling his release into Sherlock’s hand before he’d managed to say anything.
Sherlock was scribbling down everything Mycroft said in his notebook on the kitchen table as fast as he could. “Where was I when Sherrinford was swinging an axe at Redbeard? What was I doing?” he asked.
Sherlock cleared his throat, schooling his face into a solemn look. “John, will you go out on a date with me?”
Like an eagle, he looked at every detail, memorising anything that might turn out to be suspicious later on.
thing about each other’s family, and that just feels… wrong. We can’t be close, and intimate, and not know any of that kind of stuff.”
John looked bitter. “Don’t you think he has fixed things for us in this case one too many times already?”
“God, Sherlock, you’re perfect, just perfect…”John muttered as he collapsed half-beside, half on top of him, one arm over his stomach.
He was playing some high-stakes game – that much was clear – without informing John of the purpose or the rules. Sherlock had promised last year never to do that again. And he hadn’t, until now. So the fact that he wasn’t sticking to his promise now, was either because John not knowing was somehow essential to his plan, or – and John shuddered to think of it – Sherlock had lost it to such degree that he did not really have a plan at all.
Sherlock had turned into a nervous wreck the minute he’d seen police cars outside the flat upon his returning from Wantage, and his anxiety hadn’t exactly faded when they told him what had happened.
In the following minutes, shirts were slowly unbuttoned and clothing randomly slung over various pieces of furniture as Sherlock and John gradually undressed each other while continuing to kiss. It was Sherlock who steered them little by little towards the bedroom in the process.
him at his side, either standing by to back him up with a gun during hazardous pursuits of criminals or just emanating his calm presence while sipping tea in his old chair in 221B. John had become as essential to Sherlock as oxygen, and infinitely more dear.
For a few months, last autumn, her wish had been fulfilled. When John Watson had wanted nothing to do with Rose anymore, as she had been so stupid as to shoot his friend, Eurus and Rose had actually started seeing each other again.
“You’ve been hiding things from me. Important things. Don’t deny it. She was dangerous and you never told me. You were the last person I still trusted. How can I
“Er, yes, as a matter of fact, he asked for a transfer back yesterday afternoon.” Bob was now eying Sherlock suspiciously. “Did you
the way he looked now.  John closed his eyes for a second, trying to rid himself of these ridiculous thoughts. Sherlock flashed a small smile at him as he held open one of the swing doors into the theatre room.  “You look lovely too, John,” he whispered with a wink, and pursed his lips into an imaginary kiss. John smiled and pursed his lips back at him, before quickly focusing on the room they were entering.
(Mary had never even seemed to mind, merely making snarky comments about it, which John knew to be a source of pleasure in itself to her, rather than a sign of actual discontent – seeing also as she openly admitted to being only too happy not having to endure the baby’s crying for a while when John took her to Baker Street.)
John was apparently having similar thoughts, as he suddenly said, “So what was it that prevented us from telling each other how we felt?”
Another wave of renewed anger at what Middlehurst had done to him threatened to pull him deeper into his Mind Palace, where he’d not-quite-buried the most vicious of his primordial emotions, where everything was pitch-black hate and bitterness. But he quickly resisted the angry vortex pulling him down and opened his eyes. He stared at the white bathroom tiles. He was now a better person than this, above the treacherous lure to resort to pointless hate, which could only drown him.
