“So I know which camera to flip off!”

“Yes, John.  Your deduction based on my recent actions that I am amenable to your proposal is correct.”
“No, stay here. I’m not going to confront the scammer tonight;  I just need some items for tomorrow.”
“Have a nice evening, dear?”
One of the main points that John hadn’t been able to resolve was where to produce a fake client from.  Sherlock remembered everyone; who did John possibly know who Sherlock didn’t?  Well, Mike’s people-matching skills to the rescue again--Mike’s son was now studying theatre and had dreams of the West End; he could always use a little freelance gig.  Even better, he had a roommate who was almost exactly the same height and build as Wiggins (so that anything Wiggins did in the alley would at least be at the right eye level), who was willing to let them use his picture and description as the missing person.

“Dear brother...I know very well you haven’t left the flat in three days.  The Greek ambassador…”
John didn’t finish the sentence as the phone call ended abruptly.
Just before eleven, the doorbell rang, and Mrs Hudson ushered up a distraught young man.
“Naturally.  I would much prefer if you would alert the team of your location
since he’d seen John propose before.  Somehow, it was absolutely necessary to make this proposal somehow bigger or better than the one before, just to prove a point.  John needed him to know that he was more excited about the prospect of proposing to Sherlock than he ever had been with Mary.
No. And he managed to only roll his eyes once!
“I’ll keep the details to myself then,” John smirked. “And Marc, I have no idea.  They both look green to me.  Maybe listen to your wife.”

without hearing me say goodbye.
“Stay here, but be ready when I give the signal.”  Sherlock, thankfully, didn’t comment on John’s slight blush and slipped out into the room.  He took up a water pitcher and made his way through the crowd, stopping to fill glasses whenever he was close enough to overhear a bit of the conversation of the other colourfully-spandexed servers.
“Well, that was quite a nice meal.  I don’t think I’ve ever had parsnips fixed that way.”
“I suppose the Fitzgeralds are rather ordinary.  But I think they were quite impressed with our boys.”  Siger smiled.  Their boys, who had so much of their mother in them.  Violet had had to make a concerted effort to curtail how often she used the word “dull” once Sherlock had started talking.  The damage was already done, though.  Siger could still hear the petulant voice of his tiny son declaring porridge, shoe shopping, green beans, hair brushing, staying in bed until after 5:30 am, visiting Great Aunt Millicent, wearing weather-appropriate clothing, and the biscuits without chocolate bits, “Dull!  Dull, dull, dull!”  He supposed he was becoming maudlin in his old age, as he thought of old memories fondly (well, fondly now thirty-something years later; it hadn’t seemed quite so adorable at the time.)
“Jooooohn,” he moaned piteously, “the lid fell on my foot.  I think I broke a toe!”
John managed to escape Angelo’s insistence that he have a little something to eat while he was there; if he went inside, he was afraid that somehow, even hours later, Sherlock would smell it on him.  Better to be safe, and besides, he had a schedule to stick to.  He stopped for a sandwich at Pret a Manger and took it into the park to eat on a bench.
There was a titter from the audience.  John glanced at the stage. The Tarts were flexing their biceps, which in turn pulled their tunics up to show rather impressive bulges in their tights.  John suspected some of them had done some padding.
“Yes, yes, you were very helpful
very dramatic, John hoped Sherlock wouldn’t notice.

“Sherlock.”  John gave him a shaky smile as he blinked down at him. “I...I am sure you have realized by now that the case isn’t real.  I just wanted to have some fun getting you here tonight.”
to listen to every detail of the centrepieces Desmond’s sister is putting together.”
Late in the afternoon on the first of December, John glanced up at the clock.  An hour left in his shift, and god, he was ready to get home and relax in his comfy red chair.  He was only just barely over his own sinus infection, and he was still feeling the effects of several nights of poor sleep due to mouth breathing.
much pain, but the distraction was working.
A weekend away?  In the park? On a holiday? Nah, Sherlock would roll his eyes at that.  Too predictable. Sherlock didn’t like being emotional in front of a crowd, so most of the ideas John found online were right out (renting out a movie theatre and filling it with family and friends, at the top of the Eiffel Tower, on the scoreboard at a sporting event).
Only three benches down from the one where his life changed forever when Mike Stamford said, “You’re the second person to say that to me today.”
“Will do!” John mustered up a smile for the old man.  That smile faded a bit as his tired brain registered what the man was doing—shaking the snow out of his hat and scarf.
The bus stop on the next street brought even more joy to his evening—according to the ticker, the next bus wasn’t due for eleven minutes, but passengers were advised to ‘expect delays due to inclement weather.’  The bus stand was angled perfectly for the snow to be blowing directly in his face if he waited under the awning.  When he tried to step around behind the bus stand to get out of the wind, a large glob of snow slid off the roof and fell right onto the back of his neck.  The bits that managed to get under his scarf felt like needles prickling him.
Charles and Laurina were listening wide-eyed.  “How terrible…” Charles felt he had to say something at this point.”
“...Ho ho, the mistletoe, well hung as you can see…”
“Enthusiastic??  And it wouldn’t have been
“Not bloody likely.”
“Yeah, that’s some good luck there.  Mine’s in Manchester, at least.  Still not far enough.”  Owen was obviously still quite bitter.
“Yeah, he does!  Crazy stuff, sounds like stuff off of Hawaii Five-O! Or Lethal Weapon!”  Tony, apparently, was a fan.  “I was really excited when he came back from the dead; I’m glad you’re writing again!”
“He finally was able to return once the danger had passed, and resumed his life in London.  By the time he returned, dear John was engaged to be married to someone else.  Of course, that was to be expected at the time; Sherlock and John had been best friends before Sherlock left but had never declared their attraction to each other.  John, poor boy, had been devastated by his friend’s violent death.”
he was hiding!  Don’t worry, he’s not hurt, and
“Oh. Right.”  John blushed and dropped the sock into the water and slammed the washer door shut.
I’ll be in London for work for a couple of weeks starting next week, and I’ve got a weekend in the middle there free!  If anyone’s around, let’s meet up for a beer!  I googled and The Rope and Rabbit pub is near my hotel, but if any of you locals have a recommendation, I’m all for it.  As long as they serve Guinness, ha ha!  Let’s do Saturday, April 8, around 7 at whatever pub the locals decide on?  I’ll be free all afternoon if anyone wants to meet for dinner before that, too!
“Hey...Molly.”
“Oh, fuck…” John pressed those lovely hands harder against his jeans.  “I’ll show you what you can do with those hands…”
“Good day, John.”

John snorted.
“So I know which camera to flip off!”
Aaaaand....
“Prick.”
“Absolutely not. I refuse. This case is barely a two. And besides, John’s already got plans tomorrow night, and I am
“Anyhow, if Sherlock were here, he’d be rolling his eyes at me going on about his looks…’It’s all transport’, he always says...please pass the potatoes?”
The story was passed back to Siger. “We had to do a bit of acting as it was.  We don’t have many close relatives, and those we do have are either elderly or live away, so none of them were around to notice we weren't at the funeral.  And we hadn’t been introduced at that point to Sherlock’s friends in London--this was while he and John were still just flatmates--so they just assumed what they would.  If asked, Mycroft put it about that we were too elderly to travel.”
John’s mind jerked back to the present.  Right.  The laundry room was a Sherlock-free area, not a landlady-free area.
Sherlock snorted, but Teddy was not deterred.
John just snorted. Mike rolled his eyes good-naturedly and turned to the third person in the room.
John glanced around a bit frantically.  No way to take the call privately without making three people get up and move to let him out.  Besides, Mycroft’s calls were usually short and to the point.  He thought about just not answering, but there was always that niggling fear:
thought of Angelo’s (although there was a takeaway container with a crumpled receipt from Angelo’s under the skip, just to make sure)?  What if he had suddenly seen a suspicious bit of dirt and insisted on haring off to someplace John hadn’t set up?  What if he had declared the case boring and refused to peel himself off the sofa in the first place?
.  To be
And there it was.  He and Sherlock had been together as more-than-friends for a year now; he’d already had several goes at “coming out,” but there’d been rumours that they were shagging for years at both the Yard and at Bart's, so the announcement was generally met with rolled eyes and a mutter of “Finally…”.  Well, Sgt. Carothers made a snarky remark, but a busted lip made him think twice about repeating it.  And Harry’s squealing might have permanently damaged his hearing.
“Yes...yes...yes…”  Sherlock punctuated each yes with a kiss.
John paused in the doorway.

Mycroft had not yet given up. “Oh, good afternoon, Dr. Watson.”

“It’s almost like a food fight, but there’s no void where the sauce was hitting someone,” John pointed out.
“Haha, no, that won’t be necessary, Jimmy, I’m actually…”  John was cut off before he could finish that thought.
Siger beamed with pride at the photo, and then at their hosts.  He chuckled, “Never believed the “minor position” line myself, either.  For one thing, he’s always been too ambitious to be satisfied with “minor.” Saying that just avoids having to say “it’s classified” too many times in a day. And for another thing...the queen herself invited Mycroft and Greg to tea a few weeks before they got married...she said she never thought she’d see Mycroft marry--which we had thought ourselves for years--and wanted to meet the man who had changed his mind.  She was invited to the wedding, but was unfortunately unable to attend as it was the same weekend as the little prince’s birthday.  She sent a lovely note that was read at the reception, though.”
The party did sound tedious, full of overdressed ambassadors and attaches focused on networking rather than actual enjoyment, so John backed this up immediately. “Yes, bit of a reunion with my old army mates.  Haven’t seen some of them, actually all of them but Bill, since...for several years...”
“Okay…”  John was a bit confused until Sherlock unbuttoned his jeans and pulled down the zip.  “Oh. OH.”
“Oh, um, good afternoon.  I have an order for Watson to pick up.”
“What?”  Sherlock craned his neck, too, but the imaginary bird was long gone.  “What did it look like?”
“Don’t even start about the Greek ambassador.”
It wasn’t often, though, that he had to
Teddy took a shaky breath and ran his hands through his hair.  Sherlock pursed his lips but kept them shut.
John watched attentively.  He wasn’t sure what “the signal” was supposed to be, but it was usually when someone either attempted to strangle Sherlock or ran.  He found himself watching Sherlock’s legs as he moved around the room.  The muscles in his thighs moved fluidly under the smooth fabric.
John nodded as he wandered back into the kitchen for a refill.  “Bye, Mycroft.”  Mycroft collected his umbrella and left with a final glare at the back of his brother’s head.
“I knew you’d probably recognize the pattern once you made the connection to Angelo’s.  But today...today I wanted to remember those first days we spent together.  I will never forget walking into this lab and you asking me ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’  You amazed me right from the start, and I felt alive again running after you.”
The rest of the meal was passed pleasantly enough discussing their careers, trips they had taken, and a bit more on the topic of gardening.
Even football didn’t distract from the curious looks.  John flushed slightly and looked around. To his surprise, they weren’t looking at him like he was a weirdo.  They were looks of shock, yes, but mixed with awe, not derision.
“Mmm.” He poured himself a glass of water.

Despite all of his protests of “not gay,” John had known for many years that he

you can sniff out Angelo’s by their tomato sauce.  Brilliant as always.”  John just smiled fondly.
“...It was a few months after he was invalided home that he and Sherlock met.  They were both looking for a flatmate, and were introduced by a mutual friend.  John’s injuries--he was shot in the shoulder--made it difficult for him to work as a surgeon.  From what he’s said about that time, he took his forced retirement hard and struggled to decide what to do next; he’d always assumed that once he got out of the army he’d continue working as a surgeon.  He went into general practice at a clinic part-time as soon as he was able, and Sherlock started dragging him off to crime scenes as soon as he moved in.”
And someone was carrying a large bag of some particularly…fragrant would be the polite word, but John wasn’t much in the mood for polite at this point, so fucking nasty it was…foodstuff.  He had time to pick out both something fermented and something fried in old oil and still dripping with it, the kinds of smells that clung to your nose hairs.

He sent a quick text to Mycroft.
“Of course.  Thirty minutes.”

“Yeah, I know.  I was there.”  John smiled wanly and tried to step around Sherlock, who didn’t seem inclined to move, even if it meant the two men brushing past each other at an extremely close distance that most polite British men would take pains to avoid.
“I have no intention of ruining your surprise.  Are you quite sure you will not accept a job as a torturer?  You seem to possess the proper mindset.”
“Fate…” Violet rolled her eyes, as Siger had known she would, but she seemed a bit more cheerful.
John was too shocked to complain about Sherlock being sarcastic at a time like this.
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow; he had assumed John was not aware of his own tells and would take some convincing.

“Yeah?  Well, c’mere then.”  John moved his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him in.  There was a delicious moment of noses rubbing and breath mingling before Sherlock’s mouth found his.  The first touch was a bit tentative, but they quickly found their rhythm.  When their tongues finally touched, Sherlock let out a moan and melted against John.
“So you have two daughters as well?”

“Yeah, yeah, man.  I believe you.  I was just taking the piss, no need for a therapy session,” Lee rolled his eyes, but followed it with his trademark slightly deranged grin to show he meant no harm.
And then there’s the likelihood of it becoming somewhat of a pissing contest of whose post-army life was most successful; good-natured though it was likely to be, it was only human nature to want to impress old mates.  And while his life was incredible, it didn’t always translate well into a quick introductory blurb.  Part-time locum work at a clinic, after having been a trauma surgeon; blogger; assistant to a detective.  It just didn’t express how brilliant it all really was.
Siger managed the reassuring smile better.  “Yes, we’re so relieved to see the happiness they’ve found now.  Sherlock’s still “a handful” as you called it earlier; dashing around taking cases, running experiments in the kitchen, never getting enough sleep...sometimes we wonder whether John helps or not,” he said with a chuckle.

He frequently took a shift at the clinic on Fridays, so when he appeared in the kitchen in his work clothes, Sherlock only lifted his head from the microscope for a quick kiss.
Teddy looked startled and then grateful.
He swore with each step and he stomped upstairs to their flat.
Fortunately, John had another few seconds to think in a safe cocoon of wool as he pulled on the new jumper.

John nodded.  “But do you think…”
to be married?  It wouldn’t really change anything about their day to day lives.  They already lived together, had joint friends/bills/beds/dislike of coconut, and could out-bicker any couple who had been together for fifty years.  There was, of course, some tax benefit, and fewer calls to Mycroft when dealing with hospital visitation rules and such, but would Sherlock just scoff and go on about the meaningless piece of paper, and insist he didn’t need the government’s approval of his living situation?
“John.”  Sherlock tossed the remote back onto the chair and stalked across the room straight for him.  John dropped his gaze from the intense eye contact.  Looking down did not help.
That he thought you wouldn’t want to.
“I do sincerely wish you the best... John.”
NOT THAT HE DIDN’T WANT TO.
Sherlock gave him a rather warmer look than he expected, then started to look over him more carefully.
it.  I’ll talk about my wedding and see how he reacts.”
“Oh, John.  Oh, the two of you! It would make me so happy to see…oh, I’m going to cry!”
“The scammer is the one with the purple top and green tights.” Sherlock murmured.  “I’ll try to steer him this way, so be ready.”
John opened the door anyhow and stared at the container for a moment before opening the lid to sniff.  Did it smell off?  A bit?  Hard to tell for sure if he was smelling dodgy chicken or if it was the lingering smell of fresh guts on the table.
“Not just that, taking them out to dinner,” John laughed. A light blush crossed over his cheeks and he was thankful for the food as it came.
After a few hours of sitting around the restaurant and eating a few things here and there John decided it was time for a change of venue. He left the place with Sherlock by his side. He slipped into his seat and waited for Sherlock to get it. “Where are we going then, Mr. Watson?” he asked.
John slowly pulled away, opening his eyes with a smile on his face. “Wow,” he whispered, looking over at him. “That was….wow.”
John looked at Sherlock as they drove off, taking his hand and squeezing it. "Home," he whispered, looking out the window.
When they both were done they made their way to the car and sat inside it for a moment before Sherlock turned on the car. “I really like that restaurant,” Sherlock smiled, turning the key.
Sherlock never wanted to see John cry again.
John sat down on the sofa and stretched his legs out. “So, what do you want to do now?” he asked, looking over at Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded, leaving the auditorium, he would clean everything later. He didn’t want John to get in trouble either.
“That’s good,” Sherlock sighed softly. “Would you like me to take you home?”
John squeezed his eyes shut and wound his arms around Sherlock. “I’m okay,” he murmured against his chest. “I promise. I’m okay.”
Sherlock laughed and went to sit next to him, sliding further up on the car so he was leaning back against the windshield. “Sounds good,” he said with a small smile.
Sherlock smiled as he watched him go. He turned back to the work and happily painted until it he thought he had done enough for the day.
It's late. I know. Like...really late. But it's here and I like it. I hope you guys do too.
Sherlock shook his head, slowly sliding his hand over top of John’s unable to stop himself. He was enjoying the night so much, he didn’t want it to stop. “Thanks for letting me give you such a great night,” he smiled.
“Sir, it’s all he has,” Sherlock said. “Give him a lesser punishment. I’ll take him on, give him detention. Have him help out around the school. Just let him play out his last three games here.”
Sherlock drove to the school on a Saturday. A day he wasn’t even supposed to go near the school. All for a student that’s wormed his way under Sherlock’s skin, all in a good way though. He found a spot far away from the field, not wanting it to get destroyed by crowds that may or may not show up after the match.
It was the night before John was supposed to leave. He had twenty hours left with Sherlock. Twenty hours left and he wasn’t ready.
John tried not to frown as he stood up. “Come on, let’s go to the library,” Mike said.
John followed close behind him as they made their way to the car. “My birthday is this Friday,” he told him.
Sherlock’s mind nearly shut down as he was kissed. After a moment his mind rebooted and he kissed back, moving his other hand to the back of John’s neck, keeping him there. He knew he should stop but he couldn’t.
“I was going to do it but I had practice then I had to make dinner and clean up around the house and by the time I was done I was so tired I passed out right when I got to my room and…I’m sorry sir,” John said quickly.
They rushed out to the parking lot to Sherlock’s car and Sherlock unlocked it just as they reached it He pulled open the door and slipped in. “Where do you live?” he asked.
Sherlock nodded and bit his lip. He glanced to the house then back to John. He was going to get himself fired. “Would you like to do something with me?”
"I am," Hugo assured him with a grin.
Sherlock’s heart sunk a bit. John was going to say yes. He was going to tell him their plans were cancelled. John shook his head though. “I got plans already,” he told him. “An old friend is taking me out to dinner. Maybe after the match tomorrow.”
Sherlock waved his hand. “Just things that are supposed to be fun,” he shrugged. “Nothing important. Sadly it will be the only thing you guys remember in ten years.”
“John.” It was much sterner this time.
Sherlock nodded, putting a hand on his shoulder. "It will be okay," he assured him. "Come on, lets go home. I have a surprise."
“42 Hanson Road,” John told him as he buckled up. He sent a quick text to his dad telling him he was on his way. “It seems like another early morning tomorrow.”
Sherlock laughed and started the car, putting the heat on full blast. “We’ll be warm in no time.”
The teen cleared his throat and he looked down. “Thank you for taking me here,” he said. “I really don’t think I would have made it to the kitchen if I went home.”
John nodded quickly. “Please sir,” he said. “That would be so much help.”
John looked at him, his eyes full of sadness. It hurt to know what he was leaving behind but he had made the commitment. It wasn’t like he wasn’t going to come back. “I know you don’t,” he whispered quietly. He leaned towards him and kissed him again, holding it for a moment. It wasn’t going to be the last time but it almost felt like it was. Something in his chest tightened and he pressed harder into the kiss.
John hummed in agreement. “Are we going to be learning much in the next two weeks?” he asked.
John nodded. “Of course sir,” he said. He went right back to reading.
Sherlock tightened his arms around him, peppering light kisses where he could reach. “I know you don’t but…you’ll be back before you know it and I’ll write you every day. I’ll write you twice a day if you need it. When you graduate, I’ll be there standing proudly with everyone else. When you’re released into the free world again, I will shag you senseless and then we’ll spend whatever time we have left in bed or doing whatever you want before you’re sent off to school. Even then I will be able to see you more.”
John fell asleep on the way home, exhausted from the week he had. He was shaken awake and he opened his eyes too look over at Sherlock. “What?” he asked rubbing his eyes.
John shrugged. “I don’t mind. School isn’t that bad really.”
Eventually Sherlock sighed, his shoulders slumping. "John," he whispered softly.
that quiz,” he said, “for just finishing the reading earlier this morning.”
John let out a small chuckle, heart thumping in his chest. When he saw Sherlock’s eyes dart down he couldn’t stop himself. He leaned forward and kissed him, keeping it simple and chaste. He squeezed his hand, his eyes closing.
In class John paid more attention to the lecture. He wanted the best scores out of the class and it shouldn’t be that hard. He kept catching Sherlock’s eye and laughed a few times as he noticed blue flakes still in the man’s hair.
"Of course I was going to show up, you're my son and I thought it would be best if I were here;" he told him. "Why wouldn't I be here?"
John gave him a sheepish smile. “Not to do it,” he mumbled. “It’s a bad habit of mine. I’ll try to stop.”
Sherlock frowned and ran his hands through his hair. He let out a small groan as he saw the paint chips come out. “I thought I got it all,” he mumbled. “I guess not. Thank you for telling me now Mr. Watson.” He tried to look mad as he turned and went back to his seat.
Sherlock shook his head, wiping the paint from his hair. “I’ll have to buy a new can of blue now,” he mumbled. He looked over at John and started laughing again.
John grinned and started to wipe the water from his body, shaking heavily. “I’m going to be soaked still but oh well,” he murmured as he handed the blanket over and pulled on his clothes. “Warm.”
Sherlock laughed more. He saw a man peek out the window. “I think your father sees you,” he said. “Better get inside.”
John smiled and shut his eyes. “Sounds like a good plan Mr. Holmes,” he yawned.
John shook his head. “I don’t really hang around them much with them outside of school,” he said with a shrug. “I have a lot of things to do.”
“I don’t think I’ll ever be settled there,” John murmured as he looked up at him. He squeezed his hand tightly before leaning up to give him a kiss.
“Oh, is it?” Sherlock asked as he slipped into the car. He buckled up and waited for John to get ready. “That’s good.”
“It’s fine Mr. Watson,” Sherlock said. “I understand you were having your fun with it.” He smiled at John and ruffled his own hair. “It’s fine, really.”
John rolled his eyes, letting Sherlock lead the way out. “I’m joining the army. I won’t have time to worry about what I would be doing without you,” he told him.
John nodded; he was in no shape to argue. Last time he was able to sleep some in the alley but he was in too much pain now.
Why? Why doesn’t he want him to help? What was the other thinking? There were so many questions that were hanging in the air. Sherlock hated that.
John smiled, looking over at him. “Thanks for agreeing to spend another night with your student,” he hummed softly.
Sherlock laughed quietly and shook his head. “You never will,” he said. “Now you better get inside and take that shower, you smell.”
Sherlock wound his arm around his waist and helped him to his feet. “We should get going before everyone tries to leave,” he said. “You did great by the way, before you were tackled.”
John got the ball, feet hitting the ground as hard as they could as he ran towards the end goal. Evading tacklers was getting harder and he couldn’t see anyone to pass too. Someone dove in front of him and he jumped over him only to be caught by a tackler.
“Then I’ll make you,” John laughed as he lifted him up. “Hold your breath.” He fell back with him and brought him under.
Sherlock shook his head. “Don’t worry about it, you’re finishing it now,” he said. “Just hurry up. The quiz is starting right when class starts.”
The rest of the day John’s mind was seesawing between two different things. Mr. Holmes and Sarah.
“I think I can do something about that,” Sherlock said. “How about we go out to eat for some Chinese?”
Sherlock stormed off to the principal’s office and slammed his hands on the dark wood. “He can barely stand,” he growled. “John Watson can barely stand because you let that beast back into school. You need to do something more than just suspend someone. John didn’t even want to fight back because he didn’t want to get in trouble. You need to get a better system.” He was fuming and he was sure his boss could tell that someone was going to pay for the mess John was in.
“How long do I have detention?” John asked as he took off his school sweater. He set it off to the side and started looking over the set pieces.
Sherlock moved away from him and looked to the nurse. “He was beaten,” he told him. “He has three bruised ribs, something wrong with his leg, probably bruised as well maybe sprained, a black eye, and a cut lip.”
When Sherlock was done with his work he checked the time. It was earlier than usual, like he told John he would. He grabbed his jacket and pulled it on before grabbing his bag. Glancing out the window he saw the rain. He groaned and ran his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock had their legs locked at the ankle under the table and he was holding his hand tightly. He was watching John as the young man looked over the menu. He could tell that the gears were turning in his head. Way more than they should be.
John took a step back but he was met with a solid objet.
They were quiet while they finished their ice cream. Sherlock glancing over at John quietly as he ate his ice cream, smiling a bit. The older man finished before his student, it was only a given. John’s was much larger than his. He had time to look him over, enjoying the way he looked in the nights of the lights. He was so handsome. Sherlock knew he should stop the thoughts but he couldn’t. He wanted to reach out and kiss him.
They walked out of the school together, though they were careful not to be seen getting in the same care. John was just happy to have a place he actually wanted to go home to now.
Sherlock shook John awake, trying to be as gentle as he could. John sat up and rubbed his eyes as he looked around. “Oh, we’re here,” he murmured. He looked to Sherlock. “Thanks for the ride Mr. Holmes, and thank you for letting me sleep.”
John laughed dryly and shook his head. “I don’t care if he did,” he muttered, looking out the window.
“I’ll catch up with you,” John told him. He watched Mike leave before going to Sherlock’s desk. “Mr. Holmes, are you alright?”
He would even be able to get home in time to finish all his chores and have dinner ready for his dad by five. He could pick Sarah up and take her to the diner. He would be back in time to finish his homework by ten and be in bed by eleven. A perfect plan.
“Your friends need you?” Sherlock asked as he stood up.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes I am," he grinned. He looked at John with a smirk before looking back to her. "I get to relax and spend time with my loved ones."
“Sorry sir,” John mumbled, looking back down to his book.
“What happened?” the nurse asked as she came in.
“Say something like that again and I’ll kick you out,” Sherlock grinned as he drove away from the house.
There was a substitute there and Sherlock relieved her of her duties. He took his seat behind his desk as he got his things ready for the class. The students started talking once again and Sherlock clenched his hands into fists. “Quiet, all of you,” he yelled. “I don’t want to hear a single peep from you lot or I’ll give you all detention.”
The thoughts that were running through his head made his cheeks go red. He quickly pulled away from his teacher’s personal space and looked to the door. “Hey Mike,” he said, quickly getting his wits back to him.
“No, I just bring mediocre students to dinner because I want to,” Sherlock said sarcastically.
He knocked his knuckles on the dark wood of the desk. He laughed when Sherlock nearly jumped right out of his chair. ”You know, for someone who is so observant you’re easy to scare,” he giggled.
Sherlock clenched his jaw shut and he looked back down, a stone settling in his stomach. “Go,” he said, his voice flat.
John grinned even more as they sat down at a table. “Well you’re my favorite teacher, Mr. Holmes,” he said.
John nodded again, opening his door and stepping out. “Have a good night, Mr. Holmes,” he said.
“Perfectly understandable,” she smiled. “Well, you can wake him up and take him if you need to.”
“I know, I heard,” Mike laughed. He clapped his hand on his shoulder. “I’m just so happy for you John. You’ve been single forever.”
Sherlock took in a calming breath, doing his best not to get frustrated with the situation. He felt John’s hand slip away from his and suddenly he felt lost himself. He looked him over, seeing the struggle the young man was going through.
“Yes sir,” John said. He put his bag on a desk and rolled up his sleeves. As he started straightening out the desks he decided to speak up. “I’m sorry for skipping out on you yesterday, Mr. Holmes,” he mumbled.
Mr. Jamison was quiet for a moment, biting his lip as he thought. “Fine,” he sighed. “He can play out the last three games but he has detention with you for the rest of this week.”
John sat up and held his head. “Yeah,” he said. “I might need a bit of help though.”
The night after graduation was thrilling in so many ways. John spent two hours out with his friends and came home to a romantic dinner and a graduation gift. No, it wasn’t their first time, but Sherlock made it as special as he could.
“I don’t want to go under,” Sherlock said, fighting against his grip.
Sherlock nodded. “You need to call his father,” he told him.
Sherlock followed their path until they disappeared inside the locker rooms. He ran around until he found the door and pushed it open. John was found easily, lying on the bed in the sports exam room.
It was a half hour later when John emerged from the bathroom. His eyes were red and puffy. It, broke Sherlock’s heart to see him like that.
They remained silent for the rest of the ride. When they pulled up to the restaurant John decided to speak. “Should we get more of those noodles then?” he asked, glancing at his teacher.
John reached over, taking his hand and started to play with his fingers. "But I don't want to leave you," he said quietly. "I will finish my training and if you still want me I will come back to you. We can live together. Be a proper couple."
“No,” John said rather quickly. “I was just thinking. Sorry.”
Sherlock grabbed his foot and yanked him back. “Not yet Mr. Watson,” he said. He dragged him under and started to run as fast as he could in water back to the warm shore.
John frowned and looked down into his lap. “I didn’t like her as much as I thought I did,” he said. “I mean, she’s nice, pretty, and smart but not someone I really want to date.”
“It’s quite a walk,” John said. “My bus pass was stolen so I can’t take the bus back.”
“And when you’re done with your schooling, you’ll move in with me again and the only way I’ll let you leave again is if you have to,” Sherlock whispered, smoothing back his hair. “How does that sound?”
“Sleep,” Sherlock said. “I’ll wake you when we get there. Don’t worry.”
All of them piled into the principal’s office.  The principal, Mr. Jamison, stared at them all. “Alright, start explaining why you’re all in my office,” he said.
He sat in his seat and tapped his pen as he read over his book. Mike sat next to him before the bell rang. “So, a date with Sarah?” he asked. “You are a lady’s man, John.”
John nodded and pulled his arm away as he got up. He went to the car and slipped inside easily. He kept his head down and waited for his teacher to come in.
John thought for a moment before pushing away from the counter and leaving the shop. Sherlock raised an eyebrow but followed anyway.
John shook his head. “I’m hungry and well, I don’t want to cook,” he mumbled.
Sherlock squeezed his shoulder gently. “You better be,” he said. He gave him a smile and nodded toward the house. “You better get going. You’re tired and need to relax some.”
“You’re the one that likes spending time with me,” Sherlock reminded him. He pulled up to the restaurant, shutting off the car and climbing out. “Not that I mind really.”
Soon both of them were back at the car, shivering and wet. John had his arms wrapped tightly around his chest trying to preserve his warmth. “Who’s idea was that?” he asked, laughing quietly.
John grinned and headed inside. He found the table they usually sat at and pulled out Sherlock’s chair. “After you, sir,” he said with a grin.
He was so happy to have a date. The last day he had he was eleven and his mother was alive to help him with the tie. He also really liked Sarah. Had for weeks and almost everyone known it.
John nodded. “Yes, I will promise to try to take it easy,” he said.
John pushed himself up as well, sitting next to him. He closed his eyes and started licking his ice cream again.
John opened his quickly before everything came into focus and he glared at his teacher. “You’re an evil man,” he said as he slowly sat up. “Are we leaving?”
Sherlock smirked, leading him to his car. He unlocked the doors and put his bag in the back before getting in himself. He waited for John to buckle up before he started towards the restaurant. “Your dad didn’t want to spend the night with you?” he asked after a while.
John opened his eyes as he hissed and looked over at Sherlock. “That hurt Mr. Holmes,” he whispered, smiling a bit.
John sent a glare over at him before he motioned for him to come over. "Yes, I need my Sherlock," he mumbled. "And I want to get out and do something."
“I didn’t fight back, I promise,” John said, feeling like he was going to throw up. He looked up at Sherlock with tears in his eyes. “I just let him beat me up. I don’t want to get in trouble.”
Shaking his head he pushed open the door to the classroom heading straight for the back hoping that the infamous Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t notice him. His teacher had quick eyes and could see almost anything that was going on. That’s why John wasn’t surprised to be stopped by Mr. Holmes just as he reached his seat.
Sherlock frowned but he was going to let John do as he pleased. He was an adult after all. He motioned for John to lead the way. When he walked ahead a bit Sherlock turned to talk with Hugo. "I am sure he will come around and you two will be able to reconcile. I wish you the best of luck, Mr. Watson," he told him before he left.
It turns out that no one had even bothered trying.
Sherlock nodded slowly and moved to grab his jacket. If John wanted to go, he would take him.
The rest of the day went the same way; Sherlock made every one of his students stay silent with a threat of detention. With the stern look from the teacher no one let a single word slip all class.
John nodded.  Tackle the tart, right.
“Oh, did you want to share a taxi?” he asked.
“Don’t worry!  I’ve been gushing about my wedding to anyone who’ll listen for months.  It’s about time he had a turn.  Besides, after what he said about my skirt with the daisies, he
The Fitzgeralds looked both rather shocked and intrigued by this point; bugged sitting rooms and death threats were so far removed from their experience.  The most criminal thing that they’d ever had anything to do with had been when their middle daughter’s car had been broken into in Birmingham, and they had talked about that in what-is-the-world-coming-to tones for years.
Sherlock scoffed and continued looking at the footprints in the muck by the skip.  “If our client’s fiancé
John raised a hand and rested two fingers on Sherlock’s lips.
Oh, sorry, Toby fell off the bed and I had to coax
Sherlock was looking at his hands in surprise at where they’d gotten off to without his input, but seemed content to leave them there.
“You’re attracted to me.  And I am attracted to you.”
“Ah! But I almost forgot!”
“She’s just trying to wind you up.  Next time tell her you’ve snagged a supermodel.”
“Pesto.”
“Ah, John.  You’re late.” Sherlock glanced up from doing something revolting to some entrails that John really hoped weren’t human.  Hard to tell by the smell.

calculus.”  Violet rather shared her son Sherlock’s suspicious nature towards “friends,” having learned quite early in life that her fascination with numbers and beating all the boys in every math exam at a time when that was a rather unfeminine thing to do made her an odd duck among the other girls.  Siger had worn her sharp edges down over the years with his obvious adoration and steady optimism, but even now that she could start to fairly be referred to as elderly, social engagements still made her a bit apprehensive, especially if the probability of the other parties being boring was high.
*****
The conversation from the pub did not come up again that evening.
“Don’t let yourself get too worked up, dear.  It’s all over and done now.”  Siger squeezed her hand more tightly.  “There’s no need to go into everything that happened.  Suffice it to say, John’s wife turned out to have lied about her past, and had met him only because she had been hired by the criminal network Sherlock was fighting against to keep an eye on John for any signs that Sherlock was still alive.  Once our Sherlock returned, she decided to go ahead with marrying John to stay in the picture, but in the end her past caught up with her and her association with the criminal network came to light.  She ended up being killed; something about a job she hadn’t finished in the past.  The boys really didn’t want to talk to much about the details.”
“Ah, here!” Angelo produced a small black backpack from the coat rack behind the desk.  “This one; left it right in the booth, and hasn’t even called to ask about it!”

“No.  Nope.  I don’t even want to know, Sherlock.  I just want to eat my food and not die.”

After buying the rings, it took John three weeks, a pub night with Mike Stamford and several good shags to think up a scenario that sounded plausible enough that Sherlock would bother getting off the couch for it, but not so interesting that he’d be disappointed when it turned out to be made up.
As it turned out, John probably could have walked back into the morgue wearing a tutu and doing the Macarena without being noticed.
“Mmm…” he hummed politely.
“Damn.”
“John!”  Sherlock finally removed his injured finger from his mouth long enough to moan.  “This experiment could have
Slowly, Sherlock turned to face him.  As he did, John took his hand.  His eyes were bright, and his bottom lip trembled as if it couldn't decide whether to break into a smile or purse into a kiss.  His hand trembled slightly as well, and John gave it a squeeze.
“You should see this.”
were to propose, well.”
Mike had already scheduled office hours on Saturday afternoon, so he agreed to keep the flowers and a few other items John had brought along and set them out in the lab before he left.
“Thanks, Helen.”  He put the cap back on his pen from the file he’d been annotating for his last patient and stood up.
YES, with the acronym.  So, I pretended to
“Alright, let me just find my shoes, and…”  John stood up and rebuttoned his jeans.  Damn Lestrade’s timing.
Once around the corner, he stopped and pulled his list out of his bag.  Where to start?
Sherlock was entertaining himself now by gradually drifting his hand higher and higher on John’s thigh, to see what point he could reach before John elbowed him.

“...John?”  Sherlock called down from the sitting room. “Mrs Hudson won’t be happy if you let all the cold air in.”
one on the blog.”
“Git?  Please go back to the part where you were telling me I’m amazing.  I liked that bit.”
Well, he didn’t want to sleep at his desk, and there was that Indian food waiting, and it wasn’t likely to get any better.  Not like he’d never dealt with snow before, anyhow.
By the time John brought out three cups of tea, both parties seemed to be tiring.
“Morning, love.”  John gave him a quick peck on the cheek.  “Think I’m going to do a proper fry-up today.  Will you eat?”  Hopefully, by lunchtime they would be embroiled in the case, so they might as well fill up now.
“My dog caught one back in ’87.  It was a wee thing, with a wisp of purple hair.  My brother said that that dog wasn’t quite right, but I always thought…”
In short order he had a pouting Sherlock installed on the couch, with a bag of frozen peas draped over the bruised foot and an ice lolly held to the blistered finger. Turning back to the kitchen, he quickly toweled up the spilled water, chased down and binned several eyeballs, and righted the tilting pot.  Though thankful the injuries weren’t serious, he loved being able to take care of Sherlock.  He aimed a rather soppy smile at his stroppy detective boyfriend on the couch.  He loved to feel needed, and when Sherlock gave him that grateful, adoring look…
John swallowed and tried to get his face back in order.
.  No.  No, stop even
“I’ll take just a bit more...just there...thank you.”
“Oh, no. No, he wouldn’t ever…”  Teddy took a ragged breath. John made a point of sending Sherlock the same behave-yourself glare he usually used when Sherlock was being overly blunt.
“John.  Your jacket,”  Sherlock tossed it across the room as he plucked his own off the hook.  Only John’s quick reflexes saved him from being hit in the face.
“Well, if you recall, a few months ago, I discovered that running both the microwave and my current converter from the same outlet consistently trips the breaker for the kitchen?”
questions…
“Well, of course you wouldn’t, you wanker.  You faffed off to Philadelphia for five years.”
because that’s what you do after you’ve been together
Sherlock turned with a flap of his coattails.
“Why, has he said something?” If anyone were to get Sherlock Holmes to confess to his true feelings on a subject, it would be Mrs Hudson.
“Meh, didn’t help.”  Lestrade took another gulp.  “Ran into my ex this morning.”
“Yes, and then I’m to say that I remember ‘im because of the bag he left behind, which I’m still holding in the office in case anyone comes to call for it.”
So TODAY, I was chatting about
“What the…”  John didn’t have to work too hard to feign surprise.  “Is that a...what
“That I can still do, sure.”  John waved over the waitress.  Everyone was soon armed with a fresh pint.
“Friend...well, she was my roommate for two years; it made life much easier to be on good terms.  Don’t know that she would have taken much notice of me otherwise. I’m not sure she quite trusted someone who
John hung back in the doorway, as the tiny office was cramped even without both Angelo and Sherlock in it.  One more connection to make...he just needed to get Sherlock to Bart’s.  Had Sherlock figured out the case was staged yet?  He was still playing along if he had, and that wasn’t like him, really, or at least not without copious eye-rolling...John could almost believe he had truly managed to fool the great detective, but he’d felt Sherlock sneaking little glances at him as they’d spoken to Angelo.

“We’ve arrived, John.”  Sherlock quirked an eyebrow but didn’t mention the staring. Well, at least he wasn’t insisting on making a scene right here in the cab.
the British Government, that’s who was on the phone.  I still do locum work at a clinic to keep my hand in as a doctor, though, between cases, since I can’t work as a surgeon since getting shot in Afghanistan…” John realised he was rambling.
“And what does his husband do?”
“Eh, I guess?  But really, I know it looks like it what with the timing and all, but my feelings for him really aren’t just a reaction to her.  I’d always been attracted to him, but I just couldn’t accept that being with him in that way was possible, mostly because I’d never dated a man before, and didn’t think he’d be interested.  It was just once she was gone there was finally nothing to hide behind, nothing in the way…”  John was rambling again, but he wanted it to be understood that Sherlock was the love of his life, not a consolation prize or a rebound.
Thanks, Molly.  Sent 18:30
John tried to remember to be discreet, as he realised that the conversation around him had lulled, and seven people were pretending not to be listening.  This caution was forgotten in a fit of temper after whatever Mycroft said next.
“Stressful day at the office, eh?” John joked.  They’d just come from wrapping up a murder-to-cover-up-embezzlement case down in the financial district and had spent the day surrounded by nervous secretaries, angry executive officers, and incriminating evidence on the copier.
John Watson was bent over the desk in the sitting room with his pants shoved down around his knees when he had the most brilliant thought he’d ever had.
“Meh, she’d know I was making that up, and I’d look even more pathetic.”
They ignored it for a few seconds, but as soon as the call went to voicemail, the buzzing started again.   John pulled back and nodded.
Fortunately, John’s face was still hidden by a thick layer of wool while the expressions accompanying those thoughts crossed his face.  How had the jumper gotten caught on the sleeve button?
“God, Mycroft!  I would say that this time the odds are significantly better.  If he’ll have me, that is.  Well, maybe not by the end of the week; I'm still working on a plan. But by the end of the month, unless a major case comes up to keep us busy. ”
“Because Laurina was your friend in school, and you haven’t seen her in forty years,” her husband responded with a patient smile.

“Now, sod off and leave me alone.  Go sort out the ambassador’s indiscretions yourself if you need something to meddle with.

John pleaded mentally as Sherlock pawed through the contents of the bag.
“Hmm…tetchy today.” Sherlock gave a bit of a nod and then turned his attention back to prodding the entrails.  John desperately tried not to notice that they were twitching a bit as he stomped up the stairs to his room to change clothes.
“And it has not occurred to you that perhaps his odd behaviour was that he was planning to leave you, and has now done so?”

“Last night, I may have been so absorbed in the logistics of my experiment that I may…” Sherlock pasted a sheepish look on his face and pushed on. “I

Before he had any more time to make it any worse in his head, John plodded up the stairs.
John was
“Oh, no, dear, but thank you.  I did mine this afternoon, but I was missing something when I went to put it all away and came to see if I dropped it here.  Is everything quite all right?”
The pale blue tights were just that...tight.  They perfectly showed every muscle of Sherlock’s long legs. The v-neck shimmery silver top was of flowy fabric but still somehow tight across the chest, and so sheer that John was pretty sure Sherlock’s nipples would show clearly if he got the slightest bit cold.  A belt of blue and silver cord emphasized his slim waist, and below the belt, the shirt was just long enough to cover his arse and...ahem.  John stopped thinking completely for a couple of seconds.  Well, long enough if Sherlock stayed quite still and didn’t bend
“Yeah, well, before we start a therapy session here at the table, did anybody watch the Arsenal vs Chelsea game last week?”
In the cab, Sherlock sprawled on his seat, the unbuttoned Belstaff falling open as he stared out of the window.
“FU…” John clamped his mouth shut before the word made it completely out and gave a rather strained nod and wave to the elderly lady, who had glanced up at him.
)...a package of toe tags, same brand that Molly uses…a set of 18 gauge needles...notes about aneurysms, on a pad of paper with the St. Bartholomew logo...blood sample tube. Hmm.” Sherlock held the tube of blood up to the light before placing it back in the bag.  (The blood was actually Molly’s; John had asked her to draw his, just to add a touch of the macabre, but she had pointed out that Sherlock might notice a needle mark on him.  When John protested, she’d laughed and pointed out it was hardly the weirdest thing she’d ever done for Sherlock Holmes.)
He almost turned and dashed; surely Sherlock would want some space from the person who had just been ogling him?
“Is Sherlock giving you trouble again?”
After Teddy had sent several photos of himself and the supposedly abducted fiancé to Sherlock’s phone, he was abandoned on the doorstep as Sherlock crowded John into a taxi.  He wandered slowly down the street, dialling his phone to continue checking in with friends, or at least until the taxi turned the corner.
“Coming, John?”  Sherlock looked back over his shoulder and paused to wait for John to catch up.
“John, dear?”
“Mycroft.” John nodded his greeting as he shrugged off his coat and hung it up by the door.  “I don’t suppose you’ve made tea, since we have a guest?” he chided Sherlock, knowing full well that the Holmeses had probably started sniping at each other straight away before taking the time for any such considerations of comfort.  This question was deemed rhetorical and answered only by a snort.
evening catching up with friends in a pub without interference from a Holmes?  This had better be important.”
It was somehow worse than if the food had been definitely, completely destroyed.  Now he had to agonize over whether to risk a bit of food poisoning.  He might be binning perfectly good and much-desired food, or he might be spending the night in the loo…
Teddy started breathing a bit faster.

“Yeah, that’s what I was thinking.  Just, um, see if he says anything.  Really, more about marriage in general than just weddings; I’d be fine with something small if it’s the big party he objects to.”
“Yes, I’m fine.  Do you have the bottle of wine?”  He held it up.
“Thank you, Mycroft.  And if you in any way tip him off, I will tell your mother that you are dating someone but don’t want to take them home to meet your parents.”

As she stirred the sugar into her drink, Molly was humming that love song by the ginger bloke--Eli? Evan? Ed? John couldn’t tell all these young singers apart--that the nurses at the clinic had played on repeat a couple of years back.  Her diamond ring glinted in the fluorescent lighting.

And that was early days, before I was known to everybody at the Yard…”
Gently taking her hand under the table, Siger took up the story. “Mycroft is nothing if not organized.  I had a bad feeling as soon as I opened the door to him; it’s so unlike him to arrive without it being a planned holiday gathering or at the very least without calling ahead.

“Well, she was hinting about what she wanted.  He doesn’t do that.  But is it because he doesn’t

John and Teddy had been emailing back and forth for a week, planning out what Teddy would need to know to play the part of a distressed boyfriend appealing for Sherlock’s help in locating his missing lover, and now they worked out the final touches.
After a moment of silence in which seven people stared at him and no one jumped in with a comment, John went on, “I mean...we were always closer than most mates; best friends, but still...after everything we’ve been through together, and saved each other so many times in so many ways...I just couldn’t pretend anymore. It took me a while to adjust to the idea of being in a relationship with a bloke; I still really don’t think of myself as gay, bisexual, I guess, I mean, it’s really just him... I love him, and we’re very happy together, so...yeah.”

A cheerful young man jumped up from the sofa where he’d been rolling his eyes at their silly conversation.
“Hey, if you want to try again on the wife thing, my sister’s still single.”
Sherlock gestured that he’d be there in a minute.  He was examining the creatively splattered tomato sauce on the side of the building, twisting and turning to imagine how the person doing the splattering must have been positioned.
“John, please.”
“Come on, don’t leave us hanging now.  If you don’t have any more stories to share, I can tell you all about the nursing homes we’ve been looking into for my mother-in-law…”
When he returned to poke at the tomato-covered wall (which was now drawing ants), John ventured a hint.

“Yes.  So much of it we didn’t know was happening until after it was over, so at least we were spared the worry at the time, but it made the shock that much worse when we did find out just what our dear boys had been through.  But enough of the hard times...they’re in the past now and we’re so happy with how our boys are doing now.”  Violet attempted a reassuring smile that really came across as more of a grimace.
“Sherlock?”  His voice was low and soft, but it did not break.
As Sherlock resumed his previously scheduled moaning and wincing and flailing, John took in the two pots on the stove, the closest of which was now knocked on its side, still dripping boiling water (please let it just be water and not some floor-destroying acid...). The lid and a steaming tray were on the floor, and rolling merrily away in every direction from the hastily dropped steaming tray were...eyeballs.

worn anything green, had only deduced cousins that Molly didn’t like very much anyhow, had kept his phone behind the centrepiece while checking his email during the speeches and had so enjoyed dancing with John that he had not begged to leave early.  He had even looked just slightly wistful watching Molly and Desmond’s first dance together; John hoped it meant he was wishing for such a moment for himself, and not just that he was impatient to start dancing himself.  John was still nervous but was confident enough that Sherlock would appreciate the gesture of proposing that he decided to move ahead.

Oh, fuck.  The suspect was running.  Why couldn’t Sherlock tell him there was something wrong with the thermostat and have him come take a look, so they could take him quietly?  Oh, no, he had to accuse him right out in the middle of the room.
Sherlock spent several minutes poking through the carrier bags in the otherwise empty skip, tucking away a few odd bits of tubing into one of the small plastic evidence bags he kept in a coat pocket. He found the bag from Angelo’s, and made John nervous by paying entirely to much attention to the toothbrush, which had been an addition by Wiggins that John had no explanation for.

“That-old-car!  It was an Aston Martin!”
“Sherlock, why must you…”  The argument continued as he escaped to the kitchen and put on the kettle.  He came back out to the kitchen door and leaned on the doorframe, settling in to watch the verbal volleys as if he were watching a tennis match.  The discussion of whether Sherlock would deign to involve himself in the case Mycroft had requested his efforts on was interlarded with comments about weight (Mycroft’s), boredom (Sherlock’s), and idiocy (the Greek ambassador’s, for getting himself in the embarrassing situation in the first place).
“John.” And with that, Sherlock yanked his trousers and pants down to his hips and had one of John’s balls in his mouth before John had quite caught up with what was happening.
“Certainly...here we are...does anyone need a refill on wine?”
Perfect.  Long-stemmed roses in a deep purple hue, gathered with a black satin ribbon.  That colour always made him think of Sherlock.  He supposed it started with that shirt Sherlock used to wear so often, that perfectly complemented his pale skin.  Hmm, there’s a Christmas gift idea, another shirt in that shade.  And in his extensive meanderings through the offerings of Google, he’d found that purple roses symbolize love at first sight.  It hadn’t been quite
John ignored Marc completely this time. “Just. Snogging.  Well, it turns out it was only dark in that corner because the street lamp had blinked out.  And Sherlock suddenly realised he’d dropped a cuff link.  And that’s why he was on his knees.”  Snorts of disbelief all around. “
.  If he has any idea that I’m even thinking about it, he’ll deduce it all and I’ll never get to do it right.”
, but it’s great, really.”
Sherlock hummed his agreement before stepping closer and taking a deep sniff.
, John thought.
Later that evening, John choked on his tea when his brain finally cleared and he remembered his mid-coital thought.
John was pleased with how the case was progressing so far.  He had worried the whole time he had been planning it--Sherlock was so unpredictable in what would attract his attention at a crime scene.  What if he
He tried to keep the grimace off his face and nodded, if not politely, then not
Just as the affectionate snogging began to restore his previous good humour, he became aware of a strange smell permeating the flat, and it suddenly occurred to him that there had been

“Has...has Sherlock said anything about weddings to you?”
“Case.”
Of course he’s worried about
Siger snorted.  “Yes, dear…”
Owen snorted, but didn’t say anything.
Sherlock was back to the lip trembling.  John rubbed the back of the hand he was holding with his thumb. He unfurled his other hand to reveal the ring he’d been clutching.

“I’m whinging a lot tonight, and yeah, my marriage ended badly, but looking back I know we both made a lot of mistakes.  Neither of us really made each other a priority, and we were crap at communicating.  I dunno if I’ll ever get married again, but I’m not totally against the idea.  At least I’d know what mistakes not to make again.  Besides, just look at my parents, who were together for forty-nine years before Dad died…”  One thing that John really appreciated about Lestrade was that he was always fair, even if he’d been hurt himself.
“Are we all just pretending we didn’t hear ‘
By the time he got back to his laptop and read the e-mail from Paul inviting any of his old teammates to meet up for a Saturday night at the pub, he was quite ready for an evening out of the house and a nice pint.

“He had gone out to dinner with his sister; some Italian place on Wiltshire Street.  He called me from the bus on the way home--he has a bedsit near Roland-Kerr College, where he’s a student--and we were talking about normal stuff.  But once he’d got off the bus, he got quiet.  Said he thought someone was following him.  They’d followed him from the restaurant, but it was a pretty busy street so he didn’t think it odd that someone else would be getting on the same bus.  But once he got off, the person was still following…I told him to go into a shop or something, but he said he wasn’t

“That’s actually how Mycroft and Greg met,” Siger added. “Sherlock...had some...difficult times as a young man.  Greg recognized his talents and gave him work to do, giving him motivation to get better.  We’ll always be grateful for how good a friend Greg was to Sherlock, giving him a chance even though Sherlock wasn’t an easy person to be around back then. Mycroft, of course, was also trying to watch out for his brother--they’re seven years apart, so Mycroft has always been rather protective of him--and wanted to meet this person who his baby brother was working with.”
And she was off.  John was left sputtering a bit and deciding that once he put this load in the dryer that it would be quite alright until morning.  He was
John glanced back at the stage.
“John, that may have been the most needlessly complex sentence I’ve ever heard you speak.”  Sherlock acted as if he were trying to sort it out in his head.
Only an hour before John.
think we should move it up to tonight.  Sherlock’s tracked his movements and he won’t be alone until 3 am at least, and probably not until tomorrow.  And tomorrow night’s our best shot of catching him with as few people around as possible.”
He could have brushed Mike off.
John only grunted and burped up the ghost of cinnamon sprinkles.

“Yeah, I remember all the news about that, Sherlock Holmes, the detective. Come on guys, surely you remember all that a few years back?”
Sherlock’s eyes brightened.
But he was leaving now.  Finally.

“A blog.  I always thought it a rather funny, inelegant word.”
He looked up to seven impressed faces, all gaping at him curiously.
“Your partner...Sherlock Holmes?  I read your blog!”  Tony broke in.
John realized the implications when he put his hand on the refrigerator door. His face fell.
Violet rolled her eyes but grinned at him. “Yes, yes.  No need to overdo it.”
Hmm.  A bigger splash, actually; that would give him the excuse to change right away once he got home; best to give Sherlock as little time to observe as possible.
“I...I wasn’t thinking and sat down in my chair a bit...roughly.”  John put on his best slightly-embarrassed-but-amused-at-a-dirty-joke act.
