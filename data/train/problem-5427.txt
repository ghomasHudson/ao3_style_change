He's here today to destroy his best friend's life.
Claws come down on Dean's nose, raking his skin open and stealing his breath.
Castiel hangs up the phone and looks at his mom. "Michael, Uriel, and Anna are heading this way."
Dean leaned over and bussed a kiss on Ellen's cheek. "Thanks, Aunt Ellen."
"Damn, sorry." He untangles his fingers and scratches under the collar. "Guess it's itchy there, huh? You don't usually let me get around the collar."
"Nope!"
Dean’s still hanging on to Zuzu like he’s going to disappear. Zuzu crawls into Dean’s lap and plasters himself to his former handler. “What—how—I don’t understand?”
Dean eases the bedroom door open and can't help the soft smile that spreads across his face at what he sees. Cosmos is laying in the middle of his bed in a sunbeam, curled up into a small ball on top of his red and white flannel shirt. Her ear twitches as he opens the door wider, and she lifts her head to look at him.
Dean sighs and goes back into the house, grabbing a bottle of over the counter allergy meds and taking the recommended dose before going into his study, putting away the Colt, and grabbing his journal. He heads out to the porch.
“Not really, no,” Dean snarks back.
"We weren't the only ones, Dean. She poisoned the whole senior body against you, in one way or another."
Dean sighs and looks at that cat. "Dude, I feel like an old man yelling at people to get off his lawn with this. I hope you're happy."
Fury ambles to the end of the bed, where Dean's got his basket of clothes set up as a makeshift staircase and rolls down the pile of clothes to the floor. He runs over to the bedroom door and scratches at it.
Charlie's eyes light up. "That is so
Dean asks if she needs anything before he sits down, settling next to her on the couch. She raises an eyebrow at him again at the space separating them.
"Yeah, I can see ‘em now!" Charlie whoops. "That's no moon! It's a space station!"
“Ah. Christmas dinner, actually.”
“Then why are your feathers puffing up like this?” Dean asks as he runs his hand over the feathers closest to his back. Castiel’s body shudders as pleasure courses through him.
Charlie runs over and starts discussing the fastest route to get to Wakita, and Dean runs over to Lisa. "Lis, honey, I gotta go."
Brother? Does that mean-
Dean does as he promised Sam; he thinks seriously about staying in River’s Crossing. The thing with Cas aside, it’s a cool place, somewhere he can see himself settling down. He’s already starting to make friends, Anna and Charlie specifically, and when you throw in the job offer and Cas, it all makes a pretty damn attractive package. With the added bonus that if he does end up staying here, he could even qualify to adopt Uurzua if he ever becomes available.
Dean’s already pushing into the passenger seat and reaching for the radio. “Just step on it, Benny.” He calls into dispatch to inform them they are en route, then hangs the mic back on its cradle.
“I bet. I’m so glad he’s not a bed hog, by the way. I didn't realize that first night that he’s a bed-sleeper and was having flashbacks to when Sammy and I were kids.” The dog in question trots into the kitchen and shoves his head under Dean’s hand. “Gabe reminds me of how Zuzu would sleep on my cot with me.”
Gabriel leans over, pouring something on top of her steak and eggs. "Gotta have the gravy, honey. Missouri's gravy is
“Yeah. Gabe was out on the front porch. She answered the door, yelled for Cas. He apologized for her. That was it.”
"THIS IS INSANE!" she screams. "THIS IS INSANE! I DON'T LIKE THIS! THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!"
Dean's head slipped from its perch when Castiel whipped around to face him. "What?!"
Sam shakes his head and grabs the mic. "Cas, it's over. The thing was stable, and now it—now it's gone."
Cas can see Lisa and Gabe sitting under the enormous pink beach umbrella in a pair of folding chairs. Gabe has his big floppy hat and a pair of gaudy sunglasses on, and Lisa’s holding a drink in her hand, a little blue umbrella sticking out of it. She’s staring at Gabe, rapt.
"OK, Dean, stop. Take a deep breath."
"Oh, God." Dean keys the mic again. "Edgar! Edgar, I know you can hear me! She's coming right for you. Turn around! GET OUT OF THERE NOW!"
“Not gonna lie, it caught me off guard. But until you tell me otherwise, I’m stickin’ around.”
"Murph?"
Dean huffs, and they fall silent again.
She knew Dean had a low opinion of himself, but she'd never guessed it was as low as he'd shown her today.
Castiel's heart melts at his words. She's missed him too, and she resolves to herself that even if he doesn't want to see human her that she will make it a point to come see him as Cosmos. She purrs and lays down on his chest, tucking her nose under her tail until they both fall asleep.
Dean shrugged. "I told you it was a small town."
"Well, I guess we can call this one a winner then." Dean rips the label off the can before he rinses it out and tosses it in the recycle bin. He sits down at the table while Cosmos eats, listening to her happy purrs and smiling. He tentatively reaches out to her, but when his fingers make contact with her fur, she looks up at him, freezing him in place.
Cosmos chirps.
Cas hums and props her chin in her hand. "Are you going to keep him?"
Gabe jumps up and starts barking when he sees Dean through the window.
, he thinks to himself.
“So, what do we do until the fire department gets here?” Sam asks.
"What do you want," he asked, looking back to Missouri.
"Hey, I have an idea," Ash says suddenly and darts down the hallway. He comes back, flapping some shirts at them. "Got some of Dean and Zanna's dirty shirts. That way, even though they aren't here..." he trails off, and his face falls.
Dean jerked back from the window, cheeks flaming. "Don't know what yr talkin' about."
It’s a military apartment building, most of the time. Sometimes it’s an open room that’s full of bunk beds, but usually only in Basic Training.
“For real, Sam.”
Meg cries as she swipes at the brown wolf, again and again, forcing him back to the tree line.
"Dean, I'm not going to bite. Get over here so I can cuddle the shit out of you while we talk."
Cas sighs, muttering about backseat drivers, but takes the turn.
Dean looked up to the sky, asking for strength. Of course Ben was her son. He stabbed the call button.
"Dean, stop trying to make me feel guilty about this. All I'm guilty of is falling in love."
"Then will you?"
Joy nodded. "Mhm. Joanna Beth Harvelle teaches one of the classes for fifth grade. Emma's been assigned to her class."
"Oh! You finished!"
Dean sips his lemonade and shrugs again. "Plus it's not like her being here gives me any advantages ya'll don't have. She doesn't come near me and runs off before I get close to her anyway." He waves his sandwich a Marv. "You might want to let the others know that my yard is off-limits, cause after today there will be warding up, and if you try to cross it, I promise it
“Shut up, Gabe,” the brothers say in unison.
Jo looked over at Cas. "How much has he had?" Cas showed her the bottle of Jack in response. She groaned. "Can you drive?"
Sam nods. "Yeah, if you can swing it, at least until he's better and can get adopted. I know you aren't much into cats but-"
“Hey, Chief?”
Dean wakes with a start, the phantom pain fading from his mind as his brain catches up with his body. He sits up with a groan and runs his good hand across his face. It's Saturday, so why the hell is he awake before the sun is even up?
Dean blinks a few times, processing this information. “Wow. OK, so you
“Bobby said he prefers to get the car in the morning if that’s OK with you?”
BIG ASS PLANE.
Cas hums as he drains the rest of his coffee. “Do you have anything to eat here? I find I’m starting this morning.”
“Thank you, sir. She was my dad’s before me. Best thing he ever did for me, leaving her to me.” He sniffs and looks back up at Bobby. “So, what’s the damage?”
Dean opened his mouth to make a retort but snapped it shut again. "OK, good point." He drew in a deep breath. "Is that Texas pine?"
"Pretty truck," he says conversationally to Dean.
Emma shook her head.
"This is the one, I just know it," Claire says over the radio, and they all hope it is.
An air hose comes loose, flying around and smacking into people's backs. Garth grabs for it.
"Pleasure." She stepped back and allowed them to step into the office before she followed and shut the door. "My name is Naomi Tapping. I'm the principal here." She smoothed her hands on the legs of her pantsuit before she sat down behind her desk and folded her hands on the top. "I understand you've just moved back to town?"
"Ready?" Dean calls.
She blinks again.
Dean squirmed. "High school."
"You got it, Dean. I'll see you in a few hours, OK?"
Cas scrubbed a hand down his face. "I know, but did you see his face? Worth it."
"BUTT naked," Charlie squeaks.
Cas' eyes widen as the tornado barrels through a barn, ripping it apart. "Fuck. It's turning."
Ben snorted. Dean flicked his glare to him again and he paled, looking down at his hands.
"I thought Mom still loved me. She said she did in her letter." Emma's eyes were filling with tears and her voice wobbled.
"Get an ambulance over here!" Dean yells from behind Gabe and Missouri.
After the lights are up (which takes all damn day), there are decorations to hang. That eats up the rest of the day. By the time they’re done with the lights, Dean’s head is throbbing, and he’s ready to take a nap right there in a snowbank.
Dean pulled the phone away from his ear to check the time. Nine am- he missed seeing Emma off to school again. He sighed and put the phone back to his ear. "Give me an hour?"
Castiel pecks one more kiss on Dean’s lips before he diverts to the coffee cup with his name on it. His eyes close in bliss as he takes his first sip. “Thank you, Dean. And I apologize for the rude greeting Meg gave you.”
After catching their breath, Cas looks at Dean. "You OK?"
"Yup. If you wanna help, cover that plate with the tinfoil so I can put them back on it when they are done." Dean eyed his boyfriend (and boy wasn't
"Duh," Dean tells him where to find the freshest one in his workroom and Sam runs off to get it.
Dean grunts and pushes himself into a sitting position. He makes grabby hands at Castiel once he's steady. Castiel passes over the cup, halfway full, into his hands and watches as Dean carefully sips until it's gone. They trade out the cup for the Gatoraid until Dean's eyes are drooping. "Where's Zanna?"
Cas growls and slaps a twenty-dollar bill down on the counter. “We’re together,” he says to the server, then stalks out of the diner.
Castiel smiles at that. "Zanna's a good cub. I can see why you are smitten with her."
Emma shrugged. "Not all that great, really. Everyone just sat and stared at me in class."
"No problem, dude. Catch you later."
he really should tell someone about… it, but talking has never been his thing. He'll just stow his shit and fake it until it goes away, just like he's always done.
She hummed before disconnecting the call and Dean shook his head. His Mama, always keeping him on his toes. His phone buzzed with a message.
Missouri sat down on the bed next to Dean. "It's alright. I expected more of it, to be honest with you. You two boys have never been good dealin’ with 'feelings' and it usually bunched all up and came out as anger." She smoothed a hand down Dean's back, and he found himself leaning into her. "Just remember us little folks have feelings too, alright?"
Dean strokes the kitten's head. "Yeah, he and Cosmos were out here earlier playing."
"Seriously, Dean, you look half dead. Go home. We got this," she says as she crosses her arms over her chest and glares at him. "Don't make me call Sam."
"Sam?"
“It’s just, sheriffs don’t talk out their asses, Dean. If Jody says she wants it for the town or even the surrounding areas, I will bet you any amount of donuts that she already has the plans to do it; she’s just been waiting for a handler to enact them.”
tell me you are just about done with Her Highness’ car.”
Jess's laugh rings through the kitchen. "Oh man, you'll never be able to use that on me again Winchester! Cause now I'll just assume you're thinkin’ about Cas!"
She points to the forest, and Castiel snorts a laugh.
"Shh," Cas says. "Did you hear that?"
So to speak.
“Fuck. Come on. If we hurry, we can catch up with them!”
Sam waves him off, so Dean ducks into the bay. It’s not lit, so he flips on the overhead lights. Some very familiar barking accompanies the fluorescent lights.
"Hey Dean-o, can I talk to you a minute?"
"Oh good choice," Cas says as she flops down next to him. She reaches for the pizza and settles back with a hum before taking a bite. "Alright Winchester, spill. What did you do to Marv?"
She grins. “I think that can be arranged.”
"Dean? Cas? You still with us?" Gabe asks as a small house rolls onto the road.
Dean clears the stairs to his porch in two bounds and sprints to his bedroom. He pulls out clean jeans and boxers, tossing them on the bed. He ducks in the bathroom and turns on the shower, letting it warm up before he dashes back out to his closet and rummages around for a clean over-shirt and throws it on the bed.
"Guys," Charlie breaks in, "It's about three miles southeast."
He throws back the shot and drains half the beer before Ellen comes back out of the kitchen. She raises an eyebrow at him, and he shrugs sheepishly.
He follows his girlfriend as she trots across the living room to the back door, and he opens that too. He stands on the back porch and watches as Cas plays with the snowflakes falling from the sky. After a few minutes, Fury joins her, and the two cats tumble around as the snow piles up around them.
Dean takes a sip of his coffee before he replies. "Full moon. Should give us a few days to let the townsfolk know too, so if anyone who wants to come with, can. If they do, we can share. Make an event out of it. Hell, we can even invite some of the pack friends and let the humans mingle out here and get away for a while. It's been entirely too long since we got just to
Missouri laughed. "Dean, honey, you don't have to hide from me." Dean quirked an eyebrow and tilted his head at his mother, causing her to laugh more. "Sweetheart, I've known you was bi since you and Sam moved in with me."
“Oh, fuck,” he moans, letting his head fall back on the headrest. He hisses from the pain and blinks the blurriness out of his vision. Might as well get out and inspect the damage.
She's pulled away from Michael and wrapped in a dark cover of some kind, shocking her into stillness. She sniffs, and the scent of yeast and baked bread rushes into her lungs and she goes limp against Dean's chest. She's jostled around as Dean gets his hands under her rump and tucked securely to his chest but starts to relax as she feels the rumble of his chest as he speaks to Michael. Dean turns and starts moving quickly - likely taking them into his house to get her away from Michael, the same as he did when she went after Marv for being an ass - and she feels Dean's arms tighten around her to keep her from bouncing as he runs across the yard. He sets her down on the bed again and she hears the door shut before she wrestles her way out of the flannel that he'd wrapped her in.
The brothers make their way to the kitchen, greeted by the sounds of good-natured ribbing of the pack. Castiel makes a beeline for the coffee before anyone can stop him, not that they would. They know him well enough by now to not attempt conversation until he has his coffee in hand, at the very least.
“Better than what you sniff,” Charlie mutters.
Cas laughed. "I never thought I'd hear you say that about something other than Baby."
Dean’s just taking the cupcakes out of the ovens when Cas comes in. She grins when she sees the truly massive amount of cupcakes sitting around. Cas pecks him on the cheek before tossing her coat in the office, washing her hands, and putting a hairnet on her head.
She rubs along his shins and purrs, head butting his hand when he reaches down to pet her. She arches her head down, and his fingers get tangled in her collar.
"Dean?"
Castiel’s eyes twinkle. “I’m glad you approve, then.”
Cas nodded. "Mind if I call Charlie? She needs to know what happened here, anyway, and you can kill two birds with one stone."
Cas looks at the pen, then up at Dean, both eyebrows raised. “We? She’s here?”
"But you never touched her, right?"
"And Jess was so awesome," the muffled explanation came from Dean's chest. Emma lifted her head and grinned at Jess. "She knocked Mom out when she wouldn't leave."
“You know,” Bobby says as Dean sets out the tools he wants, “I’ve never seen that idjit dog follow anyone around like he does you.”
"Cause Dean
Dean sighed and drew Emma out of his shirt so they could look each other in the eye. "Emma, sweetheart, what's this about? You never used to hide things from me before."
Everything dropped away.
Dean seethes as he drives down the road with Cas in the shotgun seat and Lisa in the back of the King cab. TOTO 2 has been loaded into the back of his brand new fuckin' Dodge, and they are heading to the next likely spot for a tornado, mud covering the front seat.
“Wow. New truck, new job. New wife.” Cas laughs, and it’s an ugly, bitter sound. “It’s like a whole new you!” he says sarcastically, throwing his arms out.
"And two omegas," Charlie grumbles.
In the motel, Lisa sits on the bed, twisting her engagement ring and watching the same weather report. She bites her lip, thinking back to the conversation they all overheard between Cas and Dean. Cas had never turned the mic back off, so they heard the entire thing—including Dean telling Cas that he's still in love with him. Lisa looks down at her hands, tears gathering as the diamond catches the light.
Once the paramedics have Missouri loaded in the back of the ambulance and gotten her as fixed up as they can, Cas climbs up into the back. He looks her over, taking in the bandage wrapped around her head, the splint on her right arm, and the bloodstain on her nightgown, right over her sternum.
"Son of a bitch. Someone shot her with an arrow."
“Alright, what’s wrong, Dean? You look like someone kicked your puppy.”
Cas mutters as Sam comes back. "I see it, Dean. This is some of the best motion I've ever seen, holy shit. She's a fatty and looks to be about a half-mile wide."
Dean chuckled. "Mama, I eat just as many vegetables as Emma does nowadays. Had to set a good example." He winked at Emma, who grinned back.
Missouri hummed under her breath. "Oh, well, yeah. Yeah, l know what you mean," she said, nodding. "Relatives are trouble. I couldn't agree more. I ever tell you about Walter, my cousin?"
Castiel laughs, the sound ringing through the forest. The red-furred wolf inches closer on her belly, drawn in by the camaraderie and the sound of the man's laugh. The wind shifts in her direction, and her nostrils flare.
"And his eye?" Dean asks softly, scratching the kitten under his chin.
"That's clear to see, Dean," Ellen said as she slid up next to them. Dean grinned wider and caught her up in a hug. As he drew back, he caught sight of Jo behind her and grabbed her up next.
“Come on, man, he’s not worth it,” Gabe says.
She nodded and focused on her computer. "OK. I'm going to ask you some questions, see if we can match you up with something that's available right now. We don't have any construction going on right now, so I'm afraid that's out." She scrolled for a few seconds, then flicked her gaze over to Dean. "Can you type?"
"You knew too? So Cas isn't the only one hiding shit from me?" Dean asks, throwing his arms out.
Dean snorts softly. "Yeah? How do you figure, Red? We've got a strange alpha that's gonna take over the pack, half of the pack is still
Dean looks up, his cheeks coloring. “I
"Dean you are-"
The dog tugs on his sleeve then drops it and trots off a few steps. It looks over its shoulder as if to say,
Dean's in a foul mood at work, and his employees pick up on it rather quickly. Kevin, smart kid that he is, stays well out of Dean's way while Krissy, being the smart-ass kid that she is, takes Dean's mood head-on.
He pulls her over to his office and sits her down in his chair. "Hang out here for a sec, OK? I'm going to get you a glass of water and make sure there’s someone to watch the front."
"Lydia was at the house when we got there," Sam said as he set Jack down next to Missouri.
Castiel stands up and dusts himself off. "Well, Zanna here came out of the forest, and then Dean was defending her against me, then this Gordon fellow attacked Dean."
"I mean, yeah, Cas has been keeping stuff from me. But at the same time, it's not stuff that really matters all that much, right?"
Dean mutters and drops his head to the pillow. Cas sighs and tickles him until he shoots up again.
Dean nods. “OK, that makes sense. So I think the easiest way for us to do this would be with you face-down on the bed, and your wings spread out to the side.”
They watch as the caravan gets turned, and Cas bounces by in the Jeep, honking and waving at Dean and Lisa.
"Oh, just wanted to know if we were going to chase this tornado or not. We can always catch the next one."
“Well, I’m going to go get some the stretcher and some brain bleach,” Dean says as he heads out of the room and back down the hallway. “You two don’t move!”
They end up going by Domino's and getting the pizza as carry out instead since they were already in town and head to Dean's place after he finished up with the baking he needed to do for the day.
Sam smiles softly at him. "She's OK. The arrow didn't hit anything vital, so we got it out, and the bleeding stopped." Sam turns back to the kitchen and Dean follows. "We had to shave her leg a little on both sides so we could sew her up. By the way, that spell you threw on her did a damn good job of keeping her asleep. Otherwise, we would have had to take her to the clinic before trying anything."
Tran points to Zuzu and makes a
. They burst into laughter as the back door slammed shut.
Zanna nods in agreement. "But now we have Alpha, and we are going home. I mean, it's gotta be better than it was before, right?"
"Alright puss, it's time for me to head inside for the night. Looks like the coast is clear, so you should be safe enough to head on home to Cas." The cat turns its head to look at him, and for the first time, Dean notices that the cat’s eyes are blue, just like it’s owner's. It chirps at him and stands up on the railing. She stretches, digging wicked-looking claws into the wood, before she hops down and into the bush and streaking over into Cas' yard, fading into the night. Dean grins and shakes his head as he heads inside. He flips the porch light on in case Cas wanders over as he shuts the door and makes a beeline into the kitchen.
"So," Mary starts as they sit down to eat.
Cosmos chirps in response.
Lisa cleared her throat. "I can only apologize. I guess my animosity toward you shaped his feelings toward your family. I had no idea he's been bullying your children." She looked guiltily at Missouri and Dean.
Castiel's chest heaves as she runs through the woods, darting between the trees and other fallen debris on the forest floor. If she were human, her eyes would be overflowing with tears.
"Oh don't worry Mama, I still have an unhealthy appetite for pie and burgers." He straightened up. "Mama, you'll let me in the kitchen to cook, right?"
“Hey, I have an idea,” Dean starts. He sounds hesitant.
“Oh. Uh, do you, I dunno, want some help?”
“Come on. The committee finished up for the day. Let’s go home and warm up.” And yeah, that sounds really appealing, so he stumbles along beside Cas to his place. Gabe, in a red sweater with The Grinch on it, greets them at the door, and Cas firmly pushes Dean down on the couch.”Stay there. I’ll make some dinner and coffee. Rest.”
A hand on Dean’s shoulder stops him from submerging his hands in the soapy water. “It’s not OK, Dean. Will you look at me?” He turns to see Castiel’s earnest eyes on him. “I had every intention of being here, but my visit with my mother got a little… waylaid.”
"Look, I know this isn't the best time-"
"You try having Gabriel as a son and not pick up some of his habits," Joshua says, patting Dean on the shoulder. "Sit with me?" It's phrased as a question, but Dean can hear the thread of Omega behind it, so he obeys. "Dean, all jokes aside, how long are you going to make your alpha, let alone your wolf, be without his mate? Is there something I can do to help put you at ease?"
Unfortunately, Dean’s not paying attention. Gabe hits him head-on in the bad one, and Dean goes down with a shout, ears ringing. He shakes his head to dispel the sound and pats Gabe on the head to console him before pushing the worried pup away.
“You do look outstanding in it,” Cas drawls. Dean winks at him and starts her up, her engine roaring.
Benny?”
Dean hands over a ten and waves away the change. “Probably should get something for the fleabag, too,” he adds.
"Ruenage," Garth agrees.
She rolls her eyes at him. “So, now what are you gonna do? I remember you were trying to decide what the future held in store for you not too long ago. Now you know what you can have, so what next?”
"Hey, buddy," Dean says quietly. "Been a hell of a morning."
The paw smacks down on Dean's nose again, and then jaws are closing around his neck. The last thing he hears is Zanna's screams before he knows no more.
Dean’s shoulders slump, and he rubs the back of his neck. “Cas-”
“Thank you, Dean. Let’s stop and get something to eat first; that way, I don't have to go back to my own house until in the morning.”
The rest of that afternoon is spent with Dean setting the kitten up in his guest room where he can be kept away from Cosmos. As much as he enjoys hanging out with her, he's never seen her around other animals, so Dean knows (thanks to Sam) that they need to be kept separated until they get used to each other.
"It's gotta be coming right at us," Dean says.
It's going to be a long night.
“What do you think?”
"Sam! Lydia's here!" Jess screeched and pointed at the woman in question standing on the porch, her hand wrapped around Emma's arm.
"Can I just let it be poofy for a while? No stretchy bands?"
Castiel's heart breaks for the omega at that moment. He can’t imagine what it feels like to lose a parent the way Dean did. He makes a mental note to call his mom before he goes to bed, just so he can hear her voice.
They stood up and crossed the room, Dean with his hand outstretched for a handshake and Emma clutching her backpack to her chest. "That'd be us."
Zanna smacks Dean's nose again. "Dean."
tired last night. How’d that go, anyway?”
Castiel shakes his head. "Not yet. Dean's not the most talkative person at the best of times, especially about feelings. I suspect he's going to try to bottle it all up and try to forget about it."
"Maybe I should go down to the shelter and get myself a dog or something."
The man shakes himself and steps forward. “Forgive me, where are my manners? Come in. My name is Castiel Novak.”
Cas pauses for a second, parsing her words before looking at the server. “Check, please.”
“Hey! Welcome back, Dean!” Kevin yells.
Sam slams the doors of the van carrying two of the TOTO units. “TOTO 2 and 3, ready!”
Dean looks down at the hand not holding the phone with a grimace. "Yeah, just a few cuts. I've got salve at the house that'll fix me right up."
"Well, that makes me glad I took your advice to hire Gabe to get all our stuff out, then."
Dean deflates. “Yeah.”
Dean shook his head. "No sweetheart, I don't think she does. In those papers Miss Charlie is holding," he pointed to her and the woman in question raised a hand and gave a sad smile, "your mother is signing full parental rights and custody to me."
Cas flips on the Doppler, and for a second, it looks like it’s going to work, then sparks start flying. “God damn it, Sam!” he swears as he yanks his hand back, shaking it.
Sam knelt down and waved the kids over as the two women argued. Emma's face was tear-streaked and Jack was still muttering into the phone as they flew down the steps and into the safety of Sam's arms.
Dean twists around in time to see Castiel smile and nod. “I am, for today. Plus, my reindeer is getting antsy to go outside, I think.” And sure enough, Gabe is prancing and dancing at Cas’ feet.
"Well," Cas said. "I sure hope you washed your hands after you took him back outside." He grinned and winked at Dean. "I hear frogs can give you warts."
"I'm goin'," he says, looking at Gabe. "I'm going." He turns and starts to run for the Dodge.
Dean sips at his coffee for a few moments until he decides the awkwardness has become too much. “Well, I’ll get outta y’all’s hair. Want me to take Gabe with me?”
Yup, the little (big) shit’s in his bedroom. Dean hears Sam’s panicked voice raise in volume, along with someone else’s voice, right as he opens the door-
Dean’s heart drops, and he looks down at his coffee. “Ah.”
Dean sat back on his heels, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He tipped his head back and smiled at Missouri when she came out to the porch and handed him a glass of lavender lemonade as she sat down next to him on the steps. "Thanks, Mama."
Castiel strips and throws his clothes on Bobby's head, earning him a chuckle from Jo and Ash before he shifts and crawls into the middle of the pile, shirts in his mouth. They all shuffle around so that each of them is touching as many others as physically possible.
The pack settles into a new normal with their missing members still missing and getting used to their two new members still learning how to fit in with the rest of them.
“It would give people time to get to safety,” Cas says quietly. He knows that Dean worked so hard on this design because of his history. Hell, it’s the reason the two of them teamed up in the first place. Dean losing his parents to that twister when he was a child shaped him into the man he is today, but it left deep scars on him. Losing one’s family will do that to a person. Cas would know; it’s the reason he’s been obsessed with getting this machine and her sisters built.
Her eyes twinkle as she signs
Dean's heat hits a week after the majority of the Novak pack left. And as much as Dean's wolf wants Castiel to be its mate,
she says as they break free from the tree line. They start crossing the field at the back of the house as she continues.
. “I’m glad. She’s a good girl.” His face turns worried. “She wasn't too abrasive, was she?”
Missouri hummed and finished scrambling the eggs. "You know you don't have to thank me, but since you did, you are more than welcome, honey. Now help Emma before she falls off and cracks her head open."
Dean sits back and picks up his coffee cup. “Oof, that’s some heavy stuff to get into this early in the morning.” She winces and opens her mouth to retort, but he waves her off. “That wasn’t anything against you. I'm not sure I believe in God, not after all the crap I’ve seen while I was in the Marines, but I do believe something is out there.” He pauses, searching for the words he wants, and she comes out from behind the counter. He waves at the open seat and continues as she sits down.
Castiel squints at the omega. "Somehow, I think you're not telling me the whole story." He sweeps his arm out. "This house is half empty, and it's not the only one on the property." Dean swallows, and his fingers clench in his lap, turning the nail beds white from the force of his grip. Castiel reaches out and covers Dean's hands with one of his own. "Dean. Please talk to me."
Castiel hums. "I think we should plan to do so on the next full moon, then. It might do us some good to shed our humanity for a night. We could combine it with a pack run, perhaps."
Meg blinks. "Kinky, but fair point. I mean, in all honesty, I go out alone 'cause I don't
“Are you sure?” she asks softly, looping her arms around his waist.
“Come in.”
Dean watches for a few seconds, disbelieving. He thought- well. It doesn’t matter what he thought anymore. He sees the proof of Castiel’s decision right in front of him, and he needs to get out of here. Now.
They talk a little about Sam’s impending case until Dean’s call waiting beeps. “Hey, I gotta go. I’ll call you back later.”
Cas tosses another one to him, and this one holds. They duck into the loop of the leather and grab onto the pipe as the roof is ripped from above their heads. The roar is deafening. The walls shake and fly apart, lifting away into the debris cloud surrounding them. Dean
than approves of Cas after last night's showing.
“This is Cas’ version, so don’t go adding anything to it,” she says as she gets back onto her stool. “Although, I bet a shot of peppermint schnapps would taste good with it if you
"We're going!" Gabe yells, and the chasers steel themselves, rushing to vehicles and getting them ready to go. Dean runs over to Cas.
"Gabe, you set up?" Cas asks.
Castiel watches as Eileen makes her way out of the Bunker. Sam’s shoulders fall when the door closes, and he turns away, leaving the younger Winchester to grieve in his own way.
“We put her up into the tornado.” Cas elbows Dean so he’ll move back, then hits the button to open the top. TOTO opens with a hiss. “She’ll open up, and these little guys,” he fishes one of the sensors out and shows it to Lisa, “will be picked up by the tornado and be dispersed through the funnel cloud. They will take measurements of all of the parts of the tornado simultaneously.”
Meg nods. "I can get them fakes, for now, assuming the pack will let me have their personal information. I can get Frank to do it for me."
. His depression has made the keep-cold charm plunge into dangerous temperatures. His teeth are chattering, and his nose feels numb as he banishes the charm and feels the room start to warm up slowly. Dean becomes aware of the cat in his lap again, who is looking at him sternly.
"So," Charlie says, mouth full of a turkey and cheddar sandwich. "What's the deal with the nest?"
“Sorry, sorry.” She lets go of Castiel, transferring her grip to the fence, forcing Dean to drop behind them. “God, it’s been forever since I was out on the ice.”
"Look at the updraft, Cas. It's gonna shift its tracks."
son. And none of my children are failures." She pulled him into a hug and Dean soaked in the comfort of his mother for a while before he pulled away. He distracted himself by showing Missouri what he'd done to the swing (a temporary measure until he can build her a new one, he told himself) and what he wanted to do for the front porch.
"Yeah, but it's scary too." Dean looked away, a frown settling over his features. "What if no one wants to buy anything? What if it's no good, or -"
"Hey, sweetheart, hey, it's OK," she hears as the blankets on top of her are removed. Her ears flatten tightly to her head when the last blanket is removed, and she cowers away from the body looming over her. Large hands wrap around her body and she's lifted into the air and tucked into a broad chest and she heaves in a breath, Dean's scent flooding her lungs. Castiel goes limp in his hold.
Dean hums. “I’m glad. She’s a smart cookie.”
"Nah. Jody found him on the side of the road, and since he's not mine, I don't want to name him, you know?" He blows a raspberry. "Plus, what do I know about naming animals."
They set the plan in motion the next day.
Dean's world imploded on a Wednesday.
The jerk starts, surprised, and Dean gets a good look at his face for the first time. It is, in fact, the same man who'd gone into Bobby's store for the traps, and anger rips through him. He swiftly advances on Luc with clenched fists and swings with a right hook, connecting with the man's jaw. Luc snarls at Dean as he stumbles back, but recovers swiftly, throwing up his left arm to block Dean's next punch.
“Sure,” the tech, Dale, according to his name tag, says. He sticks his rag in his back pocket and motions for Dean to follow him. He points Dean to where he can leave it.
“I have no idea either way, but we know you don’t drink, so we can fix it,” Charlie says, scribbling something in a notebook. It looks like a list of stores they have to go to, and Dean’s eyes widen.
He flips over when Dean asks him to, and he smiles lazily at the ceiling. Dean’s hands are gentle as he makes his way through the sensitive underside of his right wing. He hums his pleasure as Dean continues to pluck out the feathers that need to go and straighten the ones that are OK to stay.
Dean pulled her into his lap. "I know so. Now, you and me need to talk, cause I want to know all about Friday at school and what you and Jack and Missouri got up to last night after you left the barn dance."
Cosmos goes back to washing her face.
. Dean himself isn't faring much better than his wolf. His skin is hot and tight and feels two sizes too small. The only time he's felt this bad in his life was when he had the flu.
“Well, damn. Hope she doesn't stick around for long. Wonder what she drove all the way from Chicago for? They broke up ages ago when she decided to go to work for the university.” She squints in the direction of Cas’ house. “I sure the hell hope she isn't trying to get him to move up there with her, again.”
Cas smirks. He schools his face and turns back to Dean. “Sorry, what?”
thinks she just up and left me." He breaks off and wipes his hand down his face. "Son, trust me," he says quietly, "I know. Now let your damn alpha and pup in so you can at least get some damn sleep." Bobby's shoulders slump, and he storms off to the main house, dejection pouring off him and leaving the three of them alone.
Kevin shudders. "He's a Witch. Not a bad one, but he also doesn't really care about anyone else, if you get my drift."
Cas shrugged, making the boat list a little. "Would you have listened?"
"Shit," Jody swears softly. "Inbounds and outbounds have doubled."
"Is she awake?"
Dean chuckles. “Sorry squirt, but you know as well as I do if you don't eat, Ellen will skin me alive."
"Jesus," Gabe mutters under his breath. "Sam!" he yells, motioning him over. "Listen to this, look at this."
“About a twenty-minute walk from the welcome sign.”
“Uh-huh.” They continue through the little pop-up market, looking at the items already set out and helping others with heavy set-up when needed. The edge of a lake is the only thing that halts the vendors’ spread.
Cas sighs. “I’m sorry you had to see that, Dean. If it makes you feel any better, it was
They are, however, a bane to Cas’ existence when it comes to her decorations for Christmas. They are corvids, after all, and they love shiny objects.
The wolves nod and apply themselves back to their food. Garth and Charlie finish first, and they start putting everything away as the rest of the pack finishes.
He steadily works his way through mixing dough and assembling the assorted pies for the week - strawberry, blackberry, and a few blueberry for the seasonal and the classics otherwise - and by the time he realizes he's heard
Dean looks up, eyebrows furrowed. He doesn’t think he has that many socks, and he says so. Castiel raises an eyebrow and lifts a pair of his fuzzy slippers to illustrate her point.
Dean looks at them, a soft smile on his face. “Yeah, I get you. Leaving Uuruza behind when I left the Marines is one of the hardest things I’ve had to do in a long time. And I only knew him for a short time.” He clears his throat and looks back at Cas. “So, what are you going to do?”
"Alright, now that's all taken care of," he murmurs, "and you've settled down." He rubs his cheek on hers. "I'm glad to see you. Missed you."
The car was quiet, so Dean fiddled with the radio dial until he landed on 93.7 and the notes of “Ramblin' Man” flow through Baby's speakers.
Castiel, who was now sitting on a pillow in front of the couch, leans his head back and watches Dean as he crosses the room. “He normally isn't like that with anyone other than me. I adopted him from the shelter in Jackson when he was just a year old.”
“Yes.” Sammy is an interesting shade of red now, Dean notes.
Dean shakes his head. "Turn right up here."
Castiel flushes to the tips of his ears and grumbles at her. "Yes, well. Thank you, Ellen."
"Dude," Charlie says as she flops down on the couch next to Dean, "I have no idea what your cat had against Michael, but she tore his ass
could be a K9 unit cop if he wanted. He’s got all the training already, and he’s more than willing to work with a new dog to get them trained up the right way; he’s done it often enough. Dean continues to mull this over until Gabe decides he’s done playing in the now obliterated snowbank and makes a run for Dean’s knees.
“I uh, know that grooming is normally only for uh, family and stuff, but uh, I mean, you are family and-”
They don’t see Eileen’s face light up with glee or Sam blanch at the display in front of him. They also don’t see Eileen smack Sam on the shoulder and point up.
"'Llo?"
Missouri swatted him as she passed on her way to the hallway. "Not
Dean raised an eyebrow at Garth. "How?" he asked, flatly.
"He won't be cheap," Castiel muses.
The kitchen gets hotter and hotter as the sun comes up, and Dean stays lost in the rhythms of his work and music. He can feel his other employees moving around him and taking the freshly baked goods out to their display cases. He smiles to himself at the thought of each of the good fortune runes making it to people who need them.
"Right now, if you want to. She's asleep right now."
Dean lets out a breath and chuckles. “Thank God. I’m shaky enough without having to deal with all of that, too.”
"Oh! The one who's missing an eye!"
Out-processing: The process of either leaving a base or the service. It’s a pain in the ass, means a lot of paperwork and running around the base.
, we'll be fine. Shoo, go talk to Cas."
Dean chuckles and dangles the Kong-on-a-rope in front of him, letting Uurzua yank him around to his heart’s content.
“Seriously, though, what’s up, Dean?”
“They work?”
The three of them roll to their feet and start back to the homestead while Charlie regales them with stories about the former Alpha.
Gabe scrambles behind Dean, peeking out from behind Dean’s legs.
Emma snuggled into his side. "Hey, Daddy. Mama sent me up to see if you were awake and you looked like you needed cuddles so." She shrugged. "We cuddled."
“Dude, what?”
"It really was a good idea." Cas hums.
I can do is three weeks, ‘cause right now he’s on vacation for a week, and then after that, there’s no telling how long it would take to get it shipped on account of the weather.”
"Well aren't you two a fine lookin' pair," he said. "Where's Mama?"
"Yeah. Yeah, we did. TOTO flew."
Dean doesn't want to leave the night as it is, so he asks Cas if he wants to watch a movie. They snuggle up on the couch, Gabe sacked out on the floor at their feet, and watch the silliest movie Dean can find on Netflix.
He nods and signs a
“Hey! What are you doing? That’s my brother’s dog!” Her hands are on her hips, but the chattering of her teeth slightly ruins the image she’s trying to give.
“Flying tin cans of death, man.” Dean shudders. “I’d rather drive than fly, thanks. If humans were supposed to fly, we’d have wings.”
Dean shrugs a shoulder and shoots him a grin from behind his mug. “It’s nothin’ much, really.” He raises his mug in a toast. “Merry Christmas, you two.”
“You get dressed, I’m going to go start on breakfast.”
Dean stretches and sits up, flexing his knee to test for soreness.
"Thank your daughter, actually," she said. "If the ambulance hadn't gotten to your mother when it did and gotten her here, it could have been much worse." She laid a hand on his shoulder. "I'm not going to tell you it's going to be easy, though. She's had a massive stroke. We won't know what the lasting effects are going to be until she wakes up and we start an assessment, but for the most part, she'll be fine."
"Yeah. You'll meet them all later; we need to have a pack meeting and get both sides caught up. But yeah, this is the rest of us."
bed, the flower and veggie beds, honey. Now come on, come say hi to your old friend."
Cas tilts her head in confusion. "Fury?"
"Tough. Spill, Winchester."
Cas grins. “Gabe is at home. He and Zuzu get along just fine, but I wanted this to be about you and Uurzua, and we both know how Gabe gets.”
"Alright, Dean. I'm getting in the car now, be there in five."
"Dinner with me an' Ellen, and $8.50."
"You aren't scared of Castiel; you are scared of his reaction to something that was done to you in those caves."
Dean waves her off. “Nah, they’ll be fine without me.”
Castiel snorts bitterly. "No. I failed to keep my pack safe on our very first run."
Missouri hummed. "Well good. Glad something got you eatin' better than you used to."
Cas grunts as he adds the sugar and cream, stirring them in. He holds up a finger at Dean in the universal signal of “wait,” points at his cup, then proceeds to drain half the mug. Only then does he look at Dean again. “Good morning, Dean.”
what she's getting into-"
A kiss to his cheek and a squeeze of the arms around his waist drew a grunt from Dean. He extracted himself from Cas' embrace and sighed. "You ready to help me get Mama home?"
"Mama, those front steps need to be replaced sooner rather than later. One's starting to sag and I'm guessing its rotted."
As he took his last bite, a gravel voice floated from over his shoulder. "Bold choice, eating by yourself."
"Sweet!" He turns and dashes to his bus, and Lisa turns to Missouri.
“Captain? What did Zuzu find?” the muffled voice of Benny Lafitte asks.
"Oh!" Dean stood up and held up Emma's lunch box. "I was wondering if you could-" He saw Emma look over her shoulder at him. "Emma! Emma, sweetheart!"
Dean's trying to take cool his mouth down when Cas comes out of the kitchen and hands him his beer. "I'm going to run upstairs and change and when I get back, you are going to tell me why Marv avoids my shop like the Plague. Claire is eaten up with curiosity."
"Can't a mother come and visit her daughter?" Lydia asked as she looked around the house. "Mm, looks like you aren't the only thing that hasn't changed."
Sam growls under his breath. "Dean, you have to calm down. If you are freaking out, Cosmos is going to freak out. She trusts you, right? So, get your shit together and help her. I'm turning onto your road now; I'll see you in a sec." The line clicks and goes dead.
She shakes her head, and he sees her eyes dart to the forest again. He doesn't know if this girl is lost or what, but he wracks his brain to come up with a way to keep her here so he can find out.
"All we know of for sure is the four who took over," Bobby says. "Abbadon is the pack leader, obviously, but she's also got Gordon, her Beta, Christian, and Ruby.
And that's a wrap for this year's SPN MBB! You can come find me on
"I appreciate you lookin' at em," Dean said as he filled a glass of water. "I think I'm going to turn in, and Jess looks like she's about ready to do the same. See you tomorrow?"
He raises his hands in surrender. “Alright, you win. I’ll keep Gabe entertained.” Gabe perks up at his name and lays his head down on Dean’s knee. Castiel gives him a short nod and heads into the kitchen.
, but- He looks up as he sees the metallic flash in the rear-view mirror, and terror rips into his gut.
when had the boy he'd grown up with turned into a man?
She waved her hand at him. "Just take a look around, make sure everything's in tip-top shape."
The movie this is based on caught my eye, even though I’ve never seen it (and probably won’t, to be honest) because there is a working dog in it. I felt that it is appropriate for me to do this as my inaugural Destiel LifeMark Bang story for… a lot of reasons.
"Gimme your number and I'll let you know. Ellen'll have my hide if I try to make a decision without her. And bring Emma."
“He said he did.”
Dean stops growling and cocks his head to the side.
All Dean could do was chew on his lip and worry.
"Yeah?"
, avoids Joshua like the plague; since that man knows much more than he's letting on, Dean just knows it, and everything is fine.
He rolls his shoulders as he makes his way down the hallway to his room. Room 15. He sighs as he pushes the door open, stepping in the bare room and shutting the door behind him. He shrugs off his trench coat, laying it over the chair next to the desk, and his suit jacket follows. He takes a deep breath and reaches into the other plane and brings forth his central pair of wings so he can finally survey the damage to them.
see ‘em, so yeah. As for how I can help, I mean, you tell me. What were you gonna do before I came in?”
"Appreciate that, Cas," Dean said as he grabbed the monkey wrapped around his legs and lifted him over his head, making Jack squeal in delight. Both men broke out into grins when Emma started hopping around Dean making hooting noises.
“So, I take it you want the papers?” Cas says as he hooks the cable he’d thrown to Dean to the laptop.
" Cas dug his head back into the pillow and the sight of Cas lost to his pleasure, the feeling of warmth spreading under him as he came, threw Dean headlong into his own orgasm. He grunted as his body locked up and buried his face in the crook of Cas' shoulder, biting down to muffle the noise being ripped from his lungs.
Ash wanders out of his office just as they are putting away the last of the dishes. "So, good news from the money front. Two years of not touching anything has left us in pretty good shape, even without money coming in. We won't go broke getting ourselves back up and running."
"Good." Cas twisted around and signaled to Ash to come over to the table. When he got there, Cas asked for a bottle of Jack and two shot glasses.
, hands clasped under her chin and eyes as wide as she can get them.
Gavin? Castiel forces herself to focus on the young man kneeling beside her, and yes, that is Gavin MacLeod. Which means the man who shot her must be Crowley.
"So…" Dean parrots back.
Dean keeps trying, talking to her, and offering the food and water. He's wiggling as far into the bushes as he can, but Cosmos won't let him touch her, hissing at him when he tries to reach for her.
They laid in bed for a few more minutes and dozed until the smell of bacon wafted up the steps and into the room. Emma's nose twitched and Dean's stomach grumbled. They untangled themselves from the bedding and trooped down the steps, stumbling into the kitchen.
Cas raises an eyebrow, not looking away from the words on the page. “Can I read it first?”
“I see,” Castiel places a bandage on the cut and professes, “Good as new. Now, where is your car at?”
He grabs a mug and swaps the carafe out until the mug is three-quarters full then shoves the carafe back in to let the only thing that makes mornings bearable finish filling the pot. He closes his eyes and breathes in the steam wafting off the dark nectar of life in his cup and feels his brain start booting up. He sticks a hand to the ice dispenser and gets a few cubes to plop in his mug and waits a few seconds before he takes his first long sip. He cracks his eyes open to take in the time on the stove, seeing that its three am, and grumbles to himself again.
Cas laughs as she drops her arms and leans back in the chair. "I agree with you."
The line of black Windstars starts passing them, and Claire says, "Hey, look, it’s the Leviathan crew!"
"Bess!" He lunges forward, gathering his wife in his arms, uncaring of the fact that she dwarfs him in her wolf form. He drops to his knees, letting his pups, Gertie and Jim, clamber into his lap as Bess covers his face with wolf kisses.
"That's right Jack. He said it's cause you are a big city girl and he thinks they are all afraid to talk to you."
"Mhm," Castiel hums as Dean sits down. "Seems your Cajun has a crush on Meg."
The shoppers start clearing out, and they see Anna, Claire, Cain, and Colette—who wave with big smiles on their faces. After Naomi passes them, squinting, they laugh and lean in closer to each other. After the vendors leave, Dean sighs.
She sniffles and pulls back, wiping her face. She then smacks Dean a few times. “Now that I’ve got that out of my system, Bobby wants you to look the car over.” She shoves Dean toward the bay. “Get in there.”
"Well, I know this is a small town, but that's just funny. Well, I guess I know where I need to go to meet up with you now, Mr. Winchester. Missouri and I are great friends." Dean hears rustling in the background. "Does two pm tomorrow sound good to you?"
They poked their heads out from under the blanket, and two pairs of eyes blinked owlishly at him. "Is she gone?" Emma asked.
Naked.
Dick steps to the side, letting a leaving patron pass, landing him next to Cas. “Dean’s crazy. Wacko, even.” He chuckles. “You should keep a leash on him.”
Dean parked Baby and turned to take in the decorated barn as he got out of the car. Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead's anniversary was tonight and the entire town had turned out for the event. He looked around and noted all of the people who were laughing as they made their way inside, the strings of lights above them casting a warm glow over everything. He grinned at the sight of children running through the adults and inside.
shared everything with her, but what if she didn't really want to know? What if she just let him ramble on and tell her things that Charlie doesn't even know just to placate him? What if-
Castiel shakes out of his shock at the funnel cloud bearing down on them. He turns to the concession and smacks his hand on the glass. "Get underground! Take cover right now!" He turns and runs to the hanger.
Missouri chuckled as they walked into the kitchen. Dean smiled down into his coffee cup as he listened to his daughter chatter to Missouri. A clatter made him look up.
"I'm not gonna ask him to share my head, Charlie. I'll just have to suck it up and deal with it."
Dean laughed harder. "I'm going to have to explain to him later, but yeah, it was pretty worth it." They chucked a for a few more minutes before they sobered. They sat silently until Dean's phone went off.
Blood. And it's saturating the air here.
“Well, yeah. But his ex showed up a few days ago, and word around town is that she’s trying to get him to move to Chicago with her.”
“At least we get a fireworks show on Christmas,” Cas points out.
“Yeah, night Cas.”
The next morning, Dean pulled into the hiring agency's lone parking spot for visitors and put Baby into park. He sat for a few seconds, listening to her engine tick as it cooled down. He squeezed the steering wheel, grounding himself, before blowing out a breath and nodding to himself. He managed to get out of the car without falling on his face and did one last pat-down before he walked into the agency.
Dean blinks at Castiel a few times, then shrugs. "Yeah, man, that would be fine. Just my stuff and Zan's since she tends to stick with me." He turns away, leading the other wolf back toward his little cave. As they walk, Zanna stirs.
Castiel gasps and arches into Dean’s chest. “Dean, but- you don’t-”
"But… why? Everyone in this town tries to look down their nose at you."
Cole smiled awkwardly. "Yeah. Look-"
thing."
"OK! One—two—three!"
The screen door opened with a creak and a petite red-head emerged with a tray of lemonade and three glasses with ice. "Oh, three glasses makes sense now," she said as she sat the tray down. "Charlie Bradbury," she said with a grin, sticking her hand out to Dean.
"Not great, but I'll get there." Dean sat up and let the blanket pool around on his lap. "Mama and I talked last night and it helped some but… It hurts, you know?"
But Meg steps out of the general store, waving Castiel down and pulling him to the side. Dean watches as they talk, Castiel’s face turning serious. But then, his heart drops into his stomach when Meg pulls Cas’ face down to hers and smashes them together in a kiss.
"Hey Cassie," he whispers. "Mom and me just got in. Want to show us to a room we can put our stuff in?"
Castiel pushes up on his elbow and looks over his shoulder at the hunter. “No, Dean, neither of those things. It’s just- I had no idea that someone touching my wings would feel this… good.”
Dean gives her a lopsided grin. "You got it." He relocates the pizza and beers to the living room and flips the TV on to Netflix, queuing up Princess Bride before he flops down onto the couch and stuffs another bite (thankfully cooler this time) into his mouth.
Charlie nods. "Yeah, like Mary did. Alpha. A good one."
"A few years ago, Mom and Dad left. They decided they didn't like it down here where it was hot as hell and the mosquitoes were big enough to carry them off. So they left the house to me, with one condition. I had to update it."
"I want one, but-" he cuts his eyes at Castiel. "Not sure I can stand for that long on my own."
"Oh dear God, don't ever let me get like that," Ruby snickered as they passed her little group on the way to the door. Dean jerked his head up and glared at her, but Jo patted his cheek.
Flashes of their first trip to Purgatory flash through his mind until he heard Dean’s prayer pick back up.
"Sure is," Meg agrees as she unpacks her camera and starts framing shots. "I'm so glad you brought me with you, Cas."
Dean slips into the house and down to his room, shifting and throwing on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He runs down the hall to Sam and Jess's room and grabs some stuff for them too, praying it still fits.
"It's OK, Dean. We tried, but there wasn't anything we could do."
“OK, both of you shut up,” he snaps, letting his training take over.
Eileen’s eyes are twinkling as she grabs Sam’s shoulder and pulls him down for a kiss.
Zanna says.
Dean furrows his eyebrows. “Then why does he put up with her crap?”
Inside the bus, Gabe swears, scared. "Fuck, it's coming," he whispers. He jumps out and runs to the door of the hanger and hones in on Cas and Dean. "IT'S COMING!" Gabe doesn't give a flying fuck that fear is coloring his voice. "IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US!"
“Okay,” Dean says slowly. Orders like that aren’t exactly out of the norm, especially this time of year. “So why do you look so hesitant to tell me the rest?”
Dean licked his lips. "Yeah. I've never worked a steady job. She didn't want me to."
Cas picks up the first shot glass and takes a small sip. “Hmm.” He rolls the drink around in his mouth. “This one seems to be a little too bland.”
“I did. I’m not going anywhere, Dean. I’m so sorry that I made you think otherwise.”
“Well yeah.” Dean can hear the annoyance in his voice. “I did drive all the way out here for the damn things.”
Emma rolled her eyes but threw her arms around Dean and squeezed him as tightly as she could. Dean caught a flicker of a smile on her face as she turned to the classroom door and pushed it open. She turned back to him and waved before ducking inside, leaving Dean to wander through the hallways. He took in the pictures and trophies lining the walls. He noticed the section they had set aside for the last time the Tigers won a championship and was surprised to find that his junior year was the last time they'd gone all the way to State.
"All right, it's just up here."
Around four, Anna finally kicks him out. “You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here,” she says, so Dean heads back to Cas’ place. He decides that it’s high time to get himself a pair of gloves and a scarf, so he stops in the general store on the way and picks up both. He gets to meet Cain, his host’s uncle, who grills him on what Dean’s plans are for Christmas until Dean can escape back out into the cold.
“Huh. Gabe’s never done that before. He usually stays at the house when Castiel’s at work. Not too fond of strangers.” Bobby levels a thoughtful gaze at Dean.
"We'll explore that later," he promised before he dipped his hand into Dean's borrowed boxers. His hand wrapped around Dean's cock, and he groaned at the warmth. Cas shuffled behind him and eventually got an arm under Dean's head, hand gripping his hair and a leg thrown over Dean's. His dick was a hot line nestled along the seam of Dean's ass cheeks.
Missouri drew back and smacked him in the shoulder. "Don't you 'hi Mama' me boy. It's been too long and you know it." She turned around and crouched down, arms wide. "Come here sweet girl and give Mama Missouri a hug."
Garth grins and throws his arms around Dean, gear and all. “Damn, Cap, it’s good to see you!”
They all stand up and Joy waves at Emma. "I'll show you to Miss Harvelle's room."
Cas didn’t come by that night, but he did, at least, send Dean a text apologizing for Meg’s behavior.
Cas’s eyes lit up. "Dean, that's wonderful!"
"Well if it isn't Dean Winchester."
“It’s about TOTO.”
Dean hobbles over to the living room, then decides he kind of wants a fire. So he drags a few logs over and gets everything settled, lighting some newspaper in the fireplace and getting it going. Once it’s started, he plops himself on the couch with a sigh. He’s just starting to consider going and looking for Cas when the man walks in with a tray, Gabe trotting beside him with a bag of ice in his mouth.
Dick's jaw flexes. "If I wanted your opinion, I would give it to you. Keep your trap shut, put your foot on the gas, and stay on this heading."
Or, at least he thought he did.
Dean gestures at Gabe to follow him and leads him back into the kitchen. "Hey Kevin, I've got this all sorted out. You're safe to go back out front." The young man nods tightly at him and scuttles back out to the counter as the bell dings, signaling a new customer. Dean points Gabe to his office and closes the door behind them.
"What was that, an F3?" Garth asks.
“Hello, Dean.”
The next two weeks involve more paperwork than he ever wants to look at again (seriously, there’s more paperwork to be discharged from the Marines than there was to
"Cas, man. You're going around Smithville just doing yard work and you can do this?" Dean looked around. "Man, you could be making a killing."
Dread washes over Dean. "Uh-huh."
"Yes, but not in my human skin," he answers finally. "I think that'll be the only way I can help him right now, just be near like when you were sleeping with us."
"Don't even, man. My yard is off-limits to anyone chasing that cat."
"You just seem more like the city-wolf type. Didn't peg you for someone who'd enjoy the outdoors."
"Just wanted to check in," Dean says from the door.
Jo and Anna cross over to them, and Anna keeps watch as Jo helps Castiel pack and shrug back into his bag. She picks up Zanna, and Castiel gathers Dean to his chest as gently as possible after clipping the flashlight to his pack strap. Anna leads them back through the tunnels and into the sunlight.
He watched his mother bustle out of his room and decided that he truly did not feel up to being human yet, so he stumbled over to the window, tugged the curtains closed, then flopped back onto his bed. He buried himself under the blankets and dozed off to the sounds of Missouri moving around the house. He drifted in and out of sleep until just after one when someone started what sounded like a chainsaw under his window.
Castiel nods and picks up the first ornament and scrutinizes the tree, looking for the best place to put it. Dean claps his shoulder and moves off to the War Room to start hanging garland on the stairs leading up to the front door. Castiel makes his way through the boxes until he feels that there isn’t enough room for any more ornaments and closes the box up. He goes in search of Dean, finding him in the kitchen talking with Sam.
Dean does his business and opens the door as he’s brushing his teeth to see Cas standing there, hand raised to knock.
“Still, though. It’s pretty cool to see it.” And it warms his heart to know that this town pulls together for kids who may not have a Christmas otherwise.
"She's still scary as fuck. Actually, I think she's scarier now than she was when we were kids."
Charlie got up, gathering the papers and her notebook. She made a 'call me' gesture at Dean, and he nodded at her before she made her way down the front steps to the Gremlin and drove off. Dean and Missouri cuddled the kids until Emma had cried herself out, falling asleep in Dean's lap. They made their way into the house, Dean taking Emma upstairs and tucking her into bed and Missouri taking Jack to the kitchen to make dinner for the three of them. They decided on something that could be reheated easily if Emma woke up later.
Castiel nods before he remembers that Dean's eyes are covered, too. "Yes," he croaks. "It's over for her."
She grins and shrugs, lifting her hands so that she can sign along with speaking. “Got tired of you moping around, so I did something about it.” She smacks him in the chest with the back of her hand. “Just be glad it was me. Sam wanted to
Cas starts when he hears Gabriel yell. "We've got one! F3 a mile outside of Parlaine!"
"I can't answer that for you, sugar, but sit on this instead. The tiles in here are always cold." Missouri sat a folded towel next to him and Dean wiggled until he could pull it under his knees. "Now, what are we going to do about you, huh?"
"OK," Dean rummages through the cabinets and pulls out a can of tuna, tossing it on the counter and gets a small bowl down and puts about an inch of water in it at Sam's instruction.
She stops cleaning herself and looks back at him, tongue still sticking out of her mouth. He can
"Oh yeah," Sam throws in. "This was before Dean and I joined up with this crew officially. Cas starts yellin' at him to get out of the way, and this idiot stumbles out of the Impala. He's got a half-empty bottle of Jack in his hand. And he's
“But why is it hidden in the garland?”
He cocks his head to the side and snaps at a fly buzzing around his ear.
Cas just hums and keeps running. After a few minutes, he veers off to the right, and they break out into an open grove of trees.
"It's good to see you. Not the way I wanted it to happen, but I'm glad even so."
Lisa walks over to Dean, drinks in hand. “Hey, I got you a coke-”
"Tasty cow, Auntie."
Charlie waves at him before giving him a bright smile and the Vulcan salute, which he returns, to her delight, then ducks out of the shop. Gabe is all over him instantly, so he scratches the dog’s ears as he pulls out his phone. He fires off a text to Sam, letting him know what’s what and asking him to call after he gets home. That done, he tucks his phone away and looks down at the dog.
"She's going to be hurting pretty bad, so here are some pain meds for her. Did you get ahold of Cas?"
He scuttles back into the bathroom and grabs his favorite soap - rosemary and pine - and jumps in. He does a quick wash and scrubs his hair to get the embedded dirt out of it and dries off as he goes back to his bedroom. He throws on his boxers and jeans, a black shirt, and the green flannel over-shirt and rushes out the door, throwing a locking spell on the door as he goes.
Dean nods. "Alright, I'll get out there. What caused this reaction, though?"
She nods, and he dashes out front, grabbing one of the coffee mugs and filling it with ice. He sees Krissy cleaning the tables.
"Yeah it is, ain't it? Been too long." He sat down on the bed next to her. "Arms in or out?"
The pack settles back in over the next few days, everyone calming down and adjusting to being back in civilization. Most of the pack is just happy to finally be home, but Ellen is very obviously in her element being back in the kitchen and feeding everyone again.
Cosmos' eyes have started drooping at this point, and Dean's anxiety is spiking again.
The pack nods since this is what they expected. Abbadon's never played well with others, so they hadn't expected the others to stick around. Castiel spares a thought to wonder where the other wolves came from before his mother breaks into his thoughts.
Jody laughed. "Well, considering you two stopped an attempted kidnapping, it's the least that woman deserves. OK, I'm hanging up I'll be there in a sec."
But, par for the course for Dean, Meg shows up not five minutes later. Dean wonders if he’s been cursed. Or if she has a tracker on him.
“Just my car, sir. She’s all I need right now, anyway, after I clear out my barracks room.”
. Dean thinks for half a second, pondering his response, then decides to go for it. He hopes he hasn’t been reading Cas wrong this whole time. “Want a shoulder massage?”
Lisa shakes her head. “He’s never told me about any of this.”
Dean squirms then sighs. "Yes. She's very nice, Cas. No, she doesn't work at the station. She owns a yoga studio."
Dean sighs. “Yeah, I figured that would be the case. It’s worth it for the old girl, though.” He cocks his head to the side, thinking. “Is there anywhere I can stay while I’m here?”
, like
"Sorta. Ben tried to start a fight that Emma finished." Dean squinted at his line; had his bobber moved? "Then the little cretin followed her and Jack back to the house and I cornered him and called her to come and get him. It came out when we confronted her about Ben being a little ass to Jack and Emma."
Dean drops to the ground with a whimper, and Zanna rushes over. "Dean!"
Dean's chest tightened. "Probably not, punkin’. Mom and I, well. We need some time apart."
Dean's not stupid. He
“It’s an instrument pack for studying tornadoes,” Dean says.
Naomi shakes her head. "Not if you want the pack to survive." She holds her hand up to stall his protests. "I'm not saying you can't, but you have two alphas who can fight and a handful of betas."
He sets it to the side and puts the other cans away in the pantry and washes the bowls. Cosmos sits and waits patiently on the table, watching the whole time. When Dean brings the dish back to the table and pops the tab on the can she chirps and stands up, practically dancing in place. He starts to dump the food in the bowl and Cosmos apparently has decided she's been patient long enough and sticks her head in and starts licking at the gravy before it’s all out of the can.
Dean grins. “I wouldn’t have offered, otherwise. Go get settled in front of the couch. I’m going to go get something I normally use for my knee, be right back.” He throws on his coat and steps into his boots, then heads over to the guest house.
Cas sighs.
Castiel looks down at the pair in her lap—blue with green polka dots—and contemplates them for a few moments before she folds them up and tosses them into the basket. Dean’s not quite sure what just happened but decides not to say anything else and just roll with it.
Castiel lays on the ground for a few moments, panting heavily and trying to regain some of her strength. She needs to get home, she needs help-
Dean flinched as he stood up and crossed over to her, hand out for her to shake. She flicked her gaze down to it before turning away and leading him into her office.
They set off quickly, and Dean takes the lead. He leads them through the underbrush, and as soon as they break out into the forest proper, he throws his head back and howls.
Inside the diner, one old enough to possibly outdate even Dean, Cas stands next to the door. He’s got his hands on his hips, looking around at the kitschy chicken décor and deciding if it’s worth it to order something to eat now. He already knows it’s going to be a long day, but-
Dean rolls his eyes and shifts over on the cot before patting his chest. “OK, get up here, you goofball.” The dog squirms his way onto the cot, over Dean’s legs (missing his nuts, thank God), and stretches out along Dean’s left side with a sigh. Zuzu plops his head down on Dean’s chest again and blinks at him sleepily.
The houses are in surprisingly good shape for laying dormant for the last two years.
"Missouri!" He runs up to her and picks her up, hugging her to his chest and twirling her around. He sets her down and smacks a kiss on her cheek. "How are you?"
how horrible that feeling is, trust me! But it was a long time ago.
Cas quirks an eyebrow at him. "Looks like you are already inside."
tense situations, Sammy! Whoooo!"
"It was good of them to distract you today." He glances at his mom out of the corner of his eye and sees a small smile playing on her lips. "The rest of the pack will be here tomorrow afternoon. We'll figure out what we need to stock up on first, then get to planning." She looks at him then, catching his gaze. "You will not be a part of the planning, Cassie. Your only role in this will be to hold your pack together, let them take care of you. And when we go,
“Charlie, can I please have the recipe for the eggnog?” He’s been trying to get it out of her for years, but so far, she’s yet to break.
Dean scoffs. "Of course, I am."
"Sooo… What are you gonna do?" Charlie asks as Dean shuffles around the kitchen, gathering up snack stuff and drinks for him to keep handy.
"Go on home, Cas. I can wrap my hand up and get the rest of this taken care of." He sees her hesitate and thinks for half a second that she's going to talk to him, but then her shoulders drop, and she turns away. He watches silently as the person he thought was his best friend walks out of his house, shutting the door gently.
“Uh, sure?” It’s phrased as a question, but Colette doesn’t catch it.
She wanders through the neighborhood aimlessly and decides that even if Dean doesn't want to see her - human her - he'd probably want to see Cosmos. Decision made; she turns toward home. As she starts to cross the street, her skin prickles. She stops on the sidewalk and lifts her face to the wind and catches a scent on the breeze she had hoped to never smell again.
"I'm sure she does, sweetheart, but…" He sighed and ran a hand down his face. "She doesn't - she - urg." He closed his eyes and tried to center himself so he could explain what was going on to his daughter without hurting her. When he opened his eyes, she was looking at him with tears streaking down her face.
She shrugs. "People,
"It's alright honey. She can't do it anymore. You're here with us now, and we won't be lettin' it happen again."
"Oh my god, it was one time, Dean," Sam said as he came into Emma's room. "Don't listen to him, that burrito was lava pretending to be beans." He leaned over and kissed Emma on the forehead. "I'll see you tomorrow, OK squirt?"
The team streams through the town and turns onto Myers. Just outside of town, Charlie keys her mic up. "OK, about a mile up the road, there's a little detour—we're gonna take a little walk in the woods!"
"Alright, I need to get down to the store. Shift starts in thirty, and I gotta make the money so that maybe one day I can move out of my mama's house." Dean leaned down and kissed Cas softly. "I'll see you later, sunshine."
“Well, of course not, Dean. So who are they?”
"Ugh, why did I let you talk me into this again?" she asks as she slips on a patch of moss. "I hate camping."
"Mama, what's wrong?"
Senior year had sucked in a lot of ways. Alliances had formed that year that wreaked havoc on the cheer and football teams and on the student body in general. Dean still didn't know what caused it, but shortly after he and Lydia had started dating at Homecoming, everything went to shit. A winning season took a sharp turn, Dean's friends started pulling away, and even Sammy had avoided him like the plague. By the time graduation had come around, Dean was more than happy to follow Lydia wherever she wanted to go if only to get away from everything that was going on.
A manic grin spreads across Gabe’s face as he looks up. He nods. “Greenage.”
A few hours later has the main house clean as a whistle and the kitchen producing smells that have everyone's mouth watering. The pack converges in the dining room, everyone helping to get the food out of the kitchen and table set before devouring everything and dispersing again.
Benny shakes his head. "Abbadon must've had spies in tow. We weren't shy about sharing what the plan for tonight was. Never needed to, before."
. If this is in any way serious, you should really consider this, you know? You deserve to be happy.”
Castiel blinks slowly at the sight of Dean's wolf peeking through his eyes, and a rumble low in his chest soothes the other wolf. "Good. That's good, omega. You've done a good job protecting Dean and the pack."
Castiel laughs and shakes his head. “In all fairness, it wasn’t Gabe’s fault.”
Daddy leaned down in front of Dean. “Son, you stay right here and keep Sammy safe, OK? That’s your job right now; keep Sammy safe.” He kissed Dean’s forehead and threw himself up the stairs, grabbing the handle of the door and Mommy, trying to hold them both down.
Cas looks up at the sky and zeros in on the clouds. He reaches over and slams the tailgate up. “Let’s go, people. We’ve got work to do!”
Gabe nods. "I guess I deserve that. Our folks were never anything worth a damn, but..." he trails off, seemingly lost in thought. He shakes himself back to the present and refocuses on Dean. "So, now that you know I'm not some creepy-ass stalker, how is she?"
"Damn it," he sighs, kicking at one of the sensors on the ground. "It's toast."
Cas nods and steps away as Lisa runs up to them.
Dean chuckles along with the older omega. "I was walking along a hallway, completely lost, and then all of a sudden, this little boy was standing there. He couldn't have been more than five, but he was already so
The rest of the Leviathan crew slows down, but the lead vehicle, where Dick and Edgar are, barrels on. The tornado shifts track further, heading directly for the van. Cas and Dean watch in horror as the lead vehicle is picked up and tossed through the air in the debris cloud. A radio tower comes into view and slams through the windshield on the driver's side. And then, much like a toddler who's decided they are done playing with a toy, the twister tosses the van out of the funnel. They see the explosion from the vehicle hitting the ground.
's title sequence plays. He's woken up to a knock on the door.
Cas looks at him, curiosity written on his face. “You can do that?”
She hums. “So, what did’ja do in the Marines?”
"Well, then I suppose he needs a name, don't you think?"
“I have an idea,” she says, a wicked grin spreading across her face.
running down the hallway.
Gabriel bursts out laughing, and Dean can hear Sam’s groan of pain at the door of his house.
His phone pings around three. He fishes it out, and it's a text from Claire informing him that she’s at the fair and asking him where he is. He tells her before tucking it safely away again and throwing another snowball for Gabe.
“What did that muffin do to you, old man?”
Dean hesitates. "But what about you?"
Sam shakes his head. "I've never seen anything like this. This is insane."
Dean's wolf, however, won't leave him alone. The more he gets to know the Alpha, the more convinced his wolf (and the rest of the damn pack, it seems) is that Cas is his mate. Which, yeah, Dean's not
Dean shrugs. “Eh, might as well. Not like I can go anywhere else.” He follows the dog down what looks to be the main drag, taking in the different stores and such.
“Hot cocoa. I figured after Gabe knocked you into the snow and then drenched us both, we deserved it. He looks over at Gabe. “And no, you don't get any.”
Dean looks over at Castiel. “You don't have to feed me every time you see me, you know.” And he winces at himself; that came out a little harsher than intended.
“You’re a jerk. You know that?”
“Well, you couldn’t have picked a better place to spend Christmas than River’s Crossing. We tend to go all out for the holiday.” Charlie snorts, and Bobby points at her, scowling. He then cocks his head to the side and looks back at Dean. “Didn’t you stay with Castiel last night?”
is just around the corner. He heads inside, a bell signaling his arrival.
After his little talk with Cas, Dean seems to settle back into his skin a little. The pack heaves a sigh of relief.
"You know it." Sam hugged Dean again. "It really is good to have you back here," he murmured into his shoulder.
"I don't know how," he whispers, tears dripping off his nose and soaking into her nightgown.
Castiel tilts his head in thought. “I think if we can get it back into alignment, I’ll be fine. My Grace is already trying to shift it back, which is probably why it hurts so badly.”
“Oh?”
"Dean. Rain bands."
Dean rolls his eyes and sighs. "No you asshole. I don't want you fuckers tearing up my garden and yard tearing after her. If you can't manage to catch her when she's out and about, then it's your own damn fault." Dean shrugs and bites into his sandwich. "Plus I figure it's only fair for her to have a safe space that she can go to avoid all you douche bags. No one likes being hunted like a criminal, and the gods know you lot won't give her any peace."
Castiel nods and stands up, offering Dean his hand. He takes it gratefully, happy for the assistance with Zan's sleeping form plastered to his body. He shifts her to one side as he stands and nods to Castiel.
Dean takes the seat in front of Henriksen’s desk, trying not to fidget and feeling like he’s been called to the principal’s office in high school all over again.
“It’s an option, yeah. I actually already have a job offer here, as a dog handler.”
Ellen hums but doesn't stop washing (likely already clean) dishes.
Dean grins, shaking his head. When he turns around, he sees Cas and Zuzu standing next to the Impala. “Man, that’s a pretty sight. It’s missing something, though.”
He takes a deep breath and pushes out of the car, slamming the door shut. He strides across the yard separating their houses and up the stairs to Cas' small porch. When he tries the door, it's already unlocked, so he knocks once and pushes inside.
E rating is also earned at the beginning of this chapter. *eyebrow waggle*
Cheek to cheek they swayed together to the old Garth Brooks song, and Dean felt himself melt into Cas' embrace. He felt the weight of a crappy retail job, his shitty reality of being cheated on and soon to be divorced, his daughter being the focus of a town bully all float away with the twangs of the guitar. The notes of the piano floated through his head and he sighed into Cas' shoulder.
She hums as he continues to explain what they've set in motion so far, and as he finishes, his mother sighs.
She chirps and kneads his shirt.
A growl starts low in Cosmos' throat. Dean swallows and pushes on.
Dean raises an eyebrow and asks over his shoulder, "How do you know, kiddo?"
Dean's days go back to normal after that. Mostly.
"Half-naked," Dean mutters.
“Why would you do this for me? Especially after choosing Meg?” Dean whispers, hugging Zuzu closer.
"Stay the hell out of my relationship!"
"Castiel? It's late, son. What's wrong?" The concern in Naomi's voice is unmistakable.
Dean takes Cas in out of the corner of his eye as he stirs the sauce, and starts humming an old Sammy Kershaw song under his breath. Castiel Novak is six feet of tough beauty even without her heels on. As a red-blooded male, he can see why she gets hit on and catcalled when she's walking down the street, but he still hates when it happens. It never fails to make her shut down and withdraw from everyone, even from him.
Mary furrows her brow in confusion. "Are you avoiding her?"
Dick scoffs. “Your design? This design is from the best scientists at Lev-”
"Mr. Winchester?"
Dean thought seriously about his question. Would he have listened? "I don't know, man. I would like to think I would have? I just… I found out this week you weren't the only one she went after when we were kids, you know?"
“So, what can I get you?”
Dean laughs. "Impatient much? Don't worry, I got stuff to go in those bowls. Just gimme a sec." He pulls the cans out and lines them up for her to inspect, and when she noses at one of them, he picks it up. "Chunky Beef in Savory Gravy, huh? That actually sounds kinda good."
Cas dropped his head back down to his pillows. "Dear god you are going to be the death of me."
Castiel hums and shrugs. “If you want it to be.”
“Good morning, Ol’hoath,” Cas rumbles. Dean feels the angel nose into his hair. “Did you sleep well?”
Dean leaned down and scooped Jack up, tossing him in the air a little before hugging the six-year-old to his chest. "Hey there Jack. How ya doin’?"
"M-hm," Dean says, squinting. "Bet those suckers are spiking at forty-thousand."
“Hey babe,” he says as he hops off the back of the truck and sweeps his husband into his arms. He smacks a kiss to Cas’ deliciously stubbled cheek.
Dean points out the different boxes to him and tells him to go nuts with the decorations. “Just don’t put so many on the tree that we can’t see the actual tree, OK?”
"Char, this is a field!" Dean yells as the stalks of wheat slap at the sides of the truck.
it wrong. And when she came to complain, she did so after we were already closed. I offered to take the items from her and replace them the next morning, even offered to drive them out to her place myself, and she refused. Said she wanted the swap to be done right then and there, which yes, I did refuse since we had already locked up and were standing outside. It was well after our posted hours of operation."
She looks over at him, key catching the sunlight as she pauses in her wash.
They head inside, and Castiel goes directly to his room, veering off into the bathroom and slamming the door shut. He lowers Dean into the tub so he can look the omega over properly.
“Oh. Those aren’t socks. They’re slippers.”
Dean chewed his lip. "Do you think it's necessary?"
Castiel huffs a laugh.
"Let's do it, then," Bobby growls.
Sure enough, just as the episode is ending, Sam pulls up. He runs in, changes, and throws together his own weekend bag in less than five minutes. They’re on the road soon after that.
Bobby could be scary when he wanted to be.
He splutters and falls backward onto the floor. He dropped his damn weapon, though, so he pokes his head over the side of the bed to see if he can find it and arm himself again.
Dean just sighs.
“Well,” Dean says, looking away. “If we knew how a tornado actually worked, we could design an advance warning system, for instance.”
"Cas!" Zanna drops the spoon into the bowl and scrambles out of the chair. She rounds the table and launches herself at his knees, clinging to him. He rumbles low in his chest; a noise meant to soothe. "Hey there, little cub. What's that face you were giving Ellen for?"
Dean's scanning the area ahead, looking for a better path to the field, but he's not seeing one. "Just gimme a second."
Dean has to take a breath to steel himself at the sight of Castiel in his clothes. That’s a whole lot hotter than he’d expected it to be.
“I wanted you to be here for her first time out,” Cas says quietly. “It wouldn’t be right if you weren’t here. You’re the only reason she exists.”
Dean breaks off, looking at Castiel fully for the first time in years.
Missouri grinned as she sat down on the bed. "Yeah? How tight?"
Dean grabs the mic. "What," he snaps at his brother.
. Help me!
When Dean gets home, he half expects to see those traps set up or for Cosmos to be waiting for him, but neither end up being the case. He blows out a breath and rakes his hands through his hair. Might as well get started on the border marking anyway, just in case.
“I sent them to my house. I figured that would be the best place to try to sit and talk, for everyone.”
. The pack shifts except for Naomi, who will handle the controls and pile up in the same pile as last night. Castiel gets jostled into the middle again, with Benny and Ash using him as a pillow. He drifts off before Vizzini starts rambling about the poisoned cups of wine.
He jolts and looks over at Cas. “Yeah?”
“Thanks,” Dean says, dusting his hands on the seat of his jeans. “How long do you think it’ll take?”
Lisa still isn't sure about this little man but nods in agreement. "Yes."
He just needs to see if Cas is on the same page before he goes making any real decisions.
Dean nods. Well, he doesn’t have any reason to say anything about his own offer right now, then. He’ll just have to wait it out and see what happens. “Well, you can talk to me anytime you need to. I know all about having to make decisions based on going to new places, having to pick new duty stations, and all that.”
They climb out of the ditch, mud clinging to everything and making the grass slick. As the two men scramble over the side of the berm, they see the Jeep, sitting upside down in the middle of the road; the Dodge is stopped just past it.
“Hilarious, Dean.”
She looks up from the stewpot she's stirring. "Should. You gonna go sit with Dean?"
“What types of dogs did you work with, Dean?” Jody asks.
it becomes a full-on chase through the whole building of four grown people—Krissy got in on it too after Kevin swiped her with some frosting—chasing each other around the bakery, trying to get as much frosting on each other as possible.
"It's old, but still sits good," Missouri murmured as she sat down on the swing next to Dean.
"So," a gulp, "did you actually throw any punches last night at the bar?"
Dean squinted at her. "Yeah, but what's that got to do with anything?"
A few days after he found the key in his bed (it wasn't on the nightstand when he woke up the next morning, and he's starting to think he's going crazy), Cosmos hops into his lap and deposits the key on his chest.
"I'll be mad later; right now I'm trying to keep us from getting killed!"
Meg's jaw goes slack. "Come again?"
"You got it, baby bro." He scoots off the bed and scuttles out the door.
As it turns out, Castiel and Meg don't live that far from the Park at all. Well, Meg doesn't live in the area at all since she lives in Nashville, but Castiel lives and works in Sevierville. When the rest of the pack wandered off to gather their things, ready to be able to finally go home, Castiel hung back with Dean and Zanna.
They worked the rest of the afternoon tilling the areas that needed it, trading off on the machine and digging up rocks. Dean convinced Cas to put the rocks bigger than a clenched fist to the side to build a spiral herb garden as a surprise to Missouri, and Dean was pretty sure he hadn’t enjoyed an afternoon like that in a long time.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I should have told you.”
Cas huffs. “I know that, Dean. I meant what is the sprig of green hidden inside of it?”
When they part, Cas rests his forehead on Dean’s. “I honestly thought my shot with you, for us, had been blown this morning,” he says softly.
Castiel comes out of his daze. “Yes, Dean?”
Lisa looks at Dean, a funny look on her face.
Dean makes a noise of assent in the back of his throat and holds his hands above the alula. “May I?”
Donna grins, sugar lining her lips. “It sure does look like it.”
Cas looked over his shoulder. "Where? Where is she and I'll give her a piece of my mind."
"Cas I know where you live."
Castiel stops at the border of Dean's yard and grabs a mouthful of Dean's shirt, careful to avoid skin, and pulls him back toward the line. Dean falls sideways but catches himself before he can land on the grass, a look of shock on his face. He scrambles up and runs over to the plants at the corner, snatching a handful of rosemary and muttering a spell under his breath.
"Oh, my gods. Dean, you are such an idiot."
Cas smacks Charlie on the ass. "You know where Dick is?"
Dean sighs. "Come on in, I'll tell you as I get myself cleaned up." She stomps up the stairs behind him and pushes past when they make it to the kitchen. She shoves him at one of the stools and silently tells him to sit before whirling away and stomping down the hallway to his bathroom where the first aid supplies are.
Dean looks at her retreating back, confused. He shakes it off and looks down at the "baby bread" and hopes that he hasn't ruined it and sets it to the side to split and put it into pans so that it can rise again before he bakes it. He braces his hands on the counter and lets his head hang, blowing out a breath. He looks up and sees Kevin flit out of the kitchen and sighs again and brushes the flour off his hands. He goes to the door separating the kitchen from the front and leans on the door frame until all the customers are taken care of. He clears his throat, gaining both kid's attention.
Cas starts waving his hands as he talks. "I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system. We need a bigger lab! You've got to do an analysis of that data-"
Cosmos leaves after that, with Mary following behind not long after. As Dean gives her a hug at her car, Mary lays a hand on Dean's cheek.
“Gabe, what the hell are you doing?” Dean asks, face in hand. His ears are turning red from embarrassment.
She whirls and crashes into the fire pit, snatching the rabbit he had snared and spitted to cook before destroying the pit, throwing the stones and coals everywhere. She turns and faces them again and leaps out of the coals. She swipes at him, ripping through the tunic and digging her claws into his abdomen.
“Is that who’s collar I saw on the bedside table?”
Cas shook his head. "Is that your daughter?"
Jack shrugged. "It was OK."
At first, Luc's able to give as good as he gets, busting Dean's nose and splitting his left eyebrow. But he's obviously not an experienced fighter and eventually Dean's able to wrestle him down to the ground. He sits on Luc's back and hogties him before pulling his cell phone out of his back pocket, dialing the Sheriff's office.
"Uh-huh," Charlie says, rolling her eyes. "Dude, you can't
There is snow falling again when he opens the door, and he’s glad for the beanie and scarf he grabbed that morning. As he walks, he plans out the rest of his day. After he greets Cas with coffee, he should check in with Sam again, and he'd like to get over to Bobby’s to see if there’s any work he can do on the Impala’s bumper. Maybe he could do an oil change while he’s there? He’s so distracted that he overlooks the little Kia in Cas’ drive. He only notices something is off when he goes to knock on Cas’ door and sees Gabe is already outside.
Benny's cheeks turn red, and he coughs. "Ah, good. That's good. I'm uh- I've got somethin'-" he points over his shoulder and bolts out of his seat and out of the house, just barely missing running Dean over as he walks in the door.
"You know, I know that you don't trust me and are perfectly happy if I never get close to you, but I'm going to have to touch you to get you attuned to the spell."
“All of them,” Charlie says distractedly. “Each version is different, and if we are going to figure out the best taste for Cas’ buds, this is the only way to do it without having to make it from scratch.” She finishes writing and tosses her notebook to the table. “Alright, Operation Eggnog for Cas is a go!”
She walked over to him and sat in the chair next to him. "Your mom is OK."
Castiel sits quietly, conserving his strength, and hopes that Dean will find him before the rift closes. His mind wanders until he hears footsteps. He peeks around the tree and sees Dean.
"How fast?"
Dean beamed. "That's awesome. Can I tell you a secret?"
The pack files into the cave.
"I have no idea," Cas pants.
With all this in mind, he decides to make dinner, shooting Cas a text to invite him over whenever he gets back from whatever it is he’s doing.
Castiel chuckles. "
cover up. I’m sure you don’t want to end up flashing everyone in the ER.”
"Sure did. Just finished putting down grass seed too. Ah! Stop!" He crosses over to her side of the yard and stops her by grabbing her shoulders before she can actually step over the barrier and casts the attunement spell on her before letting her go. As he looks at her face, he thinks her eyes glow faintly before she blinks and the illusion is gone. "Alright,
Cas just shrugged and gave him a shit-eating grin.
"For everything. Takin' me and Sammy in when we were kids, puttin' up with my bullshit. Callin' me when shit went down with Cole and telling me to haul my ass home. All of it." He took a deep breath. "I'm not sure what I'd do if I didn't have you in my corner."
"Sounds easy enough." Dean took the vest that Crowley handed him and slipped it on over his shirt and ran a hand down the front self-consciously. Crowley slapped a hand on his shoulder and pointed him to the cash register, leaving him in the care of a goofy-looking' fellow by the name of Garth. Garth, as Dean found out, was the manager of the store, will be showing Dean the ropes, and likes to hug.
Dean looks down at his hands. Castiel can see now that the man is picking at his cuticles, likely from nerves. Dean shakes his head. "'M fine Cas. Good to be home."
"Cut across the field, Dean!" Cas points to the shoulder of the road.
Dean sped through a shower and shave before jumping into clean clothes. He ran downstairs, had a breakfast sandwich stuffed in his face and cheek kissed by Missouri, and was out the door in twenty minutes. He finished his sandwich as he walked into the agency and threw a wave at Becky before ducking into Lisa's office.
Dean clapped Ash on the shoulder, shooting him a smile. "Thanks, man."
“Well, hey there,” Dean says to his brother, who motions for Eileen to turn around. Dean waves at her. “Do y’all want breakfast?”
Rocket Propelled Grenade.
"Dean?" A distracted hum lets Castiel know he has Dean's attention, so he continues. "Would you like to run with me tonight?"
“Shut up Gabe, this is so not the time. Dean, please, we really need to get to the hospital-”
The door doesn’t open, so Sam hops up and opens the door a bit. Eileen’s face brightens when she sees him.
"Did she call you?" Dean asks Gabriel as he settles down on the stool next to him.
"People like to get rid of the old ones before they get a new one." She links her fingers together in front of her and rolls her shoulders before letting her head hang down. "Keeps them from having too many books."
A small body bumps into his left thigh, and he peeks out to see Fury looking up at him. He raises his elbow and the kitten clambers into his lap.
He wanders downstream, watching the fish in the water leap and play. He sits down on a boulder and cradles his chin in his hand, letting his mind wander. A crashing behind him almost topples him into the water, and he whips around and crouches down into a fighting stance, teeth bared.
"Are you kidding?" Cas says. "We're just getting started!"
Dean snorted a laugh. "So not sorry." He swung a leg over so he wasn't pinning Cas down anymore and kissed his forehead. "Go shower again, and I'll go start the coffee and breakfast."
Dean snorted. "You talking about me or Cole? Cause it seems like you fall in love pretty easily these days. Just as easily as you discarded your husband and daughter."
Dean wrinkles his nose, but Bobby chuckles. “That's fine, Charlie. I want her out of here, too.” Dean looks up, surprised.
He raises an eyebrow at her. “Everything ok there, Blondie?”
). When he’s not dealing with paperwork, he’s running around base returning shit and making entirely too many trips to the store for boxes and tape. The Marines are going to ship the majority of his shit to Sam’s for him, thank fuck, but he still wants to pack it so he can make sure nothing goes missing.
"Dude, she never had a chance. Between Jack and Jess here there was no way she was going to get Emma off the porch, let alone out of the town."
Monday started as a brand new, not-so-exciting day. Dean got himself up with the kids, made breakfast (cereal) and saw them off at the same time he headed for the store. Garth was (again) relentless in his cheerfulness, to the point where Dean started to suspect drugs. He did a good job of showing Dean the ropes throughout the day, however, so Dean did his best to keep his eye rolls to himself.
Dean thinks for a few seconds, chewing his lip. “I’ll check to see what we have, but failing that, is scrambled eggs and bacon OK?”
Gabe jumps up and prances over to him, tail wagging so hard the rest of his sweater-clad body—today in a blue-grey—goes with it. Dean doesn't have a hand free, but Gabe doesn’t care and just presses up against Dean’s thigh.
Dean looks over at him. "This is it; this is the last one."
They stand in silence, just staring off into space. Dean’s not sure what his husband is thinking about, but he personally is trying to forget tonight ever happened. “Babe?”
"Nah. Just a close call."
Krissy rolls her eyes. "Yes,
Lisa groans. “He didn’t. Of course not.”
Dean crowds up into Cas’ space, looking for a hint of untruthfulness. He finds none. “Show me,” he demands.
"Yeah, she pushed me and then stomped off when I wouldn't budge from my decision."
She runs her hand down his snout, petting the fine hairs there. "I'm not going to keep you long. It's still early, and we've got a few hours yet before the rest of the pack gets here. Sleep. I'll watch over you."
The next morning, Missouri and Emma walked down the stairs into the kitchen and Missouri smiled at her son, sitting at the table. "I'm gonna get some tea. You want some?"
"I can't either," Cas responds.
, not fuzzy slippers.
Cas keys up, "I know Gabe, we got it."
Dean shrugs. “Not much. Met your sister, who thought I was trying to steal Gabe.”
Cas takes a deep breath and nods his head. "Let's do this."
Dean mutters through the foam, waving Cas to the sink and the brand new toothbrush sitting there. Cas smiles at him, and they end up brushing their teeth side-by-side.
Castiel nudges Dean's nose until he lifts his head so he can look at him. “Do you regret it?”
"Well," Missouri hums. "It sounds like you two had a very interesting morning." She looked up at Dean. "What happened before all that?"
his work on days like this.”
Someone who signed a blank check to the US government, gave everything to the military, and somehow, made it home. Hoorah, brothers and sisters.
"Good. I need you to get every pack member fed and into their fur. Ask the humans to stand guard until I get there. Give this Missouri your phone; I'll call her when I leave the airport. Now, once you are all fed, you all need to curl up as a pack in a space where you can all fit and try to get some sleep. Do you understand?"
Dean shrugs. "Does it matter?" Hell, he wasn't even sure at this point what his supposed infraction was. The Alpha had stopped giving him real reasons a long time ago.
Marv waves him off. "I shouldn't have said what I did, about either of you. She just made sure to let me know of her displeasure." He grunts as he rolls over and sits up. Dean gets to his feet and offers him a hand up, which Marv takes.
"Alright, let's get you wired up," he says and reaches over, putting the headset on and clipping the receiver to the back of his pants. Cas soaks up the contact while he can. "Alright, you're all set," he says, sitting back.
“Let’s get you laid down, let them rest.” He starts tugging on Castiel, urging him to turn around and lay face down on the bed. Castiel grumbles but eventually lets Dean manhandle him into a position that, admittedly, does feel better, and he lets his wings go lax against the bed.
"Mmhmm. Alright, you take it easy, I'll get everything started first thing in the morning, alright?"
Castiel blinks at the hostility rolling off the other man. "Castiel."
and can we just- I just need-”
Lisa’s startled by the vehemence in Dean’s voice. “Who is that, Dean?”
She grumbles at him and scratches at the door. He grins at her and gets up, gathering his notebook, and lets her in. The little black kitten, now cleared by Sam to roam the house and interact with Cosmos, tumbles over to her and rubs his head along her side. She stops and cleans his ears, and Dean steps over them, going into the kitchen. He opens a can of food for them to share and portions it out into bowls before setting them down on the ground. They follow him into the kitchen and bury their noses in their respective dishes, tails in the air.
"Oh hush you. Just feelin' out of sorts today, felt like listening to music while I worked." Dean shrugs. "I guess it wasn't a bad thing since I'm pretty sure all we'll have to do is actually bake a lot of the stuff I put together today for the week."
Until a third tornado joins in.
Dean backs out of his room slowly until he can't see Castiel anymore and whirls around, running into the living room. He looks around, panicked, and grabs his phone off the couch where he'd left it and snatches up his keys, bolting for the front door and the Impala. He throws his baby into reverse and backs out of the driveway as quickly as he can and points her to the town limits. He has to pull over when the white noise that's filled his head takes over, and he can't see or breathe. He fumbles his phone out of his pocket and it slides across the seat. Dean growls under his breath and grabs it.
Dean swallows. “Do you think he’ll go? With her?”
Cas climbs into the cab—in the driver's seat—and Dean rolls his eyes and dashes around to the passenger side. Cas revs the engine and grabs the radio. "Alright, Charlie, time to impress me."
Dean strides up to Cas, who has his keys in his teeth. "Thank you, I'll drive." Cas rolls his eyes and dashes around to the truck's passenger side, jumping in as Dean starts it up. Music starts up from the bus as Dean drives by, and he sees Gabe drinking something from the straws attached to the roof of the cab where he keeps a gallon of tooth-rotting sweet tea.
He watches Kate and Matthew with their shenanigans mindlessly for about a half an hour, working his way through the ice cream. His mental state spirals as he watches, mental voice obsessing over Cas' seeming lack of desire to share things about herself with him. He truly doesn't understand her reasoning for keeping something like
Dean nods back. "Alright, let's do this." He turns into the cornfield next to them.
The bird bobs its head up and down a few times, then it hops over to Dean’s shoulder. It preens the hair sticking out from under his hat and then flies away. After work, he does some research and after dismissing the ideas that will scare them off entirely, he decides to do two things: put up some netting and feed them away from the porch. After a few days, the two seem to get it, Cas is happy, and things stop being taken.
