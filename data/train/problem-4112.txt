Fiddling with the paper in his hands, Dean struggled with his thoughts. He didn’t know how to explain to his brother, who loved theatre so much, that his own love had turned so sour. How watching their parents crash and burn was just the prologue to his own failed relationships. There’d only been four of them, even though he was 26, and none of them lasted more than a few months. But it was more than that Dean wasn’t good enough or that he’d been holding them back. It was the
It was actually less than a dream, at first. It was a memory. The night Dean had first fallen for Aaron Bass. The guy was a grad student, a couple years older than Sammy but still younger than Dean, and he had invited Dean over to his tiny-ass apartment to help him run lines. He had so little time to learn the show it just made sense, right? They’d sat on the small couch together, Dean reading Joe’s lines off a script and Aaron, who’d already memorized all seven hours of the role, tossing Louis’s lines back without ever taking his gaze from Dean’s face. When he sighed and stretched, revealing a sliver of his stomach, Dean zeroed in on it in the dream just as he had in real life; and when Aaron offered him some weed, he said yes.
From outside, the music was too muffled to tell exactly what Hannah and Castiel were dancing to, but the style was all ballet. The siblings were utilizing the entire space, looking comfortable in their skintight dance gear that left nothing to the imagination, and absolutely no doubt about the perfection of the lines their bodies created. They were stunning together, passionate without being romantic, musical in their motion and utterly full of grace. With effort of will Dean forced his gaze away to scan of the rest of the cast; to a one they were caught up in the artistry and the silent story the siblings were telling with every step. The sole exception was Crowley, the only other person in the studio with the Novaks. His sharp eyes held no awe, only schemes.
“Good.” Joshua smiled, and unlike Crowley’s, his was kindly. “You’re both great young talents, and I’d hate to see it go to waste. Might I suggest talking, before you restart rehearsal?” He gave them each a significant look, though signifying what Dean had no clue, then ambled out of the room.
“You’ll get cast,” said Dean. “You’ve been singing that show since you were in diapers and your voice fits the style. Want me to help prepare you for the audition?” Dean couldn’t imagine that Sam would really want his help, as he himself hadn’t auditioned in years and his brother probably had a plethora of peers and professors to choose from at school, but he couldn’t help but ask. He loved working with Sam.
“To Castiel. He and his sister are actually pretty nice, but you guys seemed kind of grumpy toward each other today.”
“Other than he’s an alien that can’t communicate like a normal human being but still thinks he’s superior? Nope. What you wanna work on?”
The musical director sat down in the middle chair of the folding table they’d brought in and folded her hands atop her notes. “We’ll start with half of you,” she said. “‘The Old Gumbie Cat,’ I think, Kevin.”
, I’m going to bring you home. Lay you out on my bed. Carve out an entire day just to discover you.”
At first the rehearsal was fine. Dean was nervous, yes, to have the full attention of Crowley, Joshua, and Castiel, but he knew his character well enough now to disappear into him, and as long as he hit his marks, he got fewer snarky comments from Crowley and wasn’t drawn forcefully back into himself and his less than stellar dancing figure.
After making sure all the shop lights were off, he pulled the door closed behind him and locked it. Sam waited for him in the single pool of lamplight behind the building, a breeze lifting his shoulder-length hair. His little brother was looking so clearly anxious and hopeful that Dean felt he might as well put him out of his misery. “What the hell,” he said. “I’ll do it.”
And again, and again, they ran through the few measures, and Dean forgot about Joshua, patiently waiting his turn, forgot about Sam, and putting on a good face for the sake of his future, forgot about Crowley as anything other than a disembodied voice that controlled the rules of the game they were playing; he saw nothing more than how they were both heaving against their sticky, sweat-soaked tanks, the way they kept one-upping each other, pushing harder and harder every time their eyes met, galvanizing them, reaching and stretching farther, higher, faster—
Dean laughed for real, glad the emotional moment was over. He wiggled his eyebrows. “Was it as good for you as it was for me?”
“No—” began Sam, and Dean steeled himself so the disappointment didn’t show, “I mean yes, obviously, but…”
Auditions were in a week and Dean was too irritated to be nervous. Sam’s graduation had been last weekend, Class of 2005, and Dean couldn’t be more proud. Seeing his little brother in the cap and gown had been the best moment of his entire damn life, but could either of their parents have been bothered to show? Apparently not. Sam and John were on another of their silent treatment jags and both had been too stubborn to give it up, even for this. And according to Sam, the last time he’d spoken to Mary she hadn’t even realized it was already his senior year, and he decided not to correct her.
“Yes!” she yelled, and he could practically see her fist pump. “That’s my boy! You always were my little rock star. Remember when all you wanted for your eighth birthday was AC/DC’s greatest hits?”
Dean blinked and drew back. Cas smiled and left the room, presumably for cleaning supplies. Dean tore his eyes away from the lean muscles of Cas’s back and the empty doorway he’d disappeared through, glanced toward the mess they’d made, and turned heel to open the windows on the other side of the room. He tried to leave his feelings behind with the evidence of their sex so that they’d wipe clean, too; tried to shrug them off as he undid the latches on the windows; bit back a bitter laugh as the cool lake air sighed through the screens and prickled at the sweat drying on his skin. He thought he’d been safe, but he’d been wrong.
As Castiel spoke, Dean’s face flushed, at first with a shocked sort of embarrassment, and then with growing anger. Who the fuck did this guy think he was? How could he fucking sit there and say Dean hadn’t put any work in when he’d had his own role handed to him on a platter?
Sam slung it over his shoulder. “It’ll be just like the old days if we get cast, you know? We used to sing these songs all the time.”
So Dean looked, too, because it was better than thinking. And a realization hit like lightning. He’d seen the lake countless times, seen the other Great Lakes and lesser ones all around the country; he’d seen numberless sunrises and sunsets, getting up early for work and getting home late, endless city blocks and infinite open roads turned molten by the dawn or dusk; Dad tapping his hands along to “Moby Dick” on the steering wheel of the Impala and Sammy sleeping in the backseat, or Mary in the kitchen, singing voice weaving with the morning calls of the birds as she baked him a birthday pie, in that mythical time when they were still a family. But never had he ever watched the horizon grow rich in blues and purples with someone’s arms embracing him, their heartbeat steady and their muscles solid, secure and
No, Dean hadn’t known that. He wanted to look away, but Sam’s eyes were so wide and earnest that he couldn’t.
Dean was terrified at the thought of working with another pro company. His first and only experience had been with
Dean sighed, tapping his pencil on the paper he had laid out over the trunk of the car. Sourcing an actual ’48 Ford De Luxe Convertible – the community theatre wanted to nod to the movie version of the musical in that respect – would have been far beyond budget. So Dean needed to build upon the curves of the car to mimic the correct shape before he painted her white and made her shine. He remembered when he’d first painted an old car white for
a couple years ago. It’d been perfect timing; Sam was well entrenched in college and Dean was free to strike out more on his own. He already had a decent length of community and regional work under his belt, but with Sam’s prompting he’d auditioned for pro—and been cast. As a lead, no less. He may never have been ill like Roger but Dean found it easy to understand his character anyway: his love of rock, his struggles to make ends meet, the darkness of his thoughts, the way he fell head over heels for a girl who suddenly appeared in his life. Ellie was almost as wild as her character Mimi. Even though they clicked right away, at first he turned down all her invitations to go out and party. He was so used to needing to be home and being responsible for his brother. But while Sam still lived in their tiny apartment, he was off doing his own thing. Finally, tentatively, he accepted one of her invitations and then—Dean discovered he was still young.
“You like me, don’t you? But you’re not sure about making a move?” Dean’s reaction was completely artless, turning his head away in denial before he could stop himself, and Aaron laughed. Amused, but not mean. Dean felt more than saw him scoot closer, the heat from his body intense in the minimal space where they weren’t quite touching. “Tell me something.”
had a lot of Elvis, so the swinging pelvis is implied. In the movie version (which Dean has, maybe, stolen from Sam’s room to watch once…or twice…) John Partridge plays Rum Tum Tugger throughout the show with a deceptively laidback quality, oozing the suave veneer and latent intent of a
“Well if he said that, then he is. But you should let it go, Dean. There’s no way he could think that after today’s rehearsal.”
And yet, Dean felt loose and limber after slipping into a tank and some comfy pants (all black), and fell easily into the habit of swinging his limbs around, getting his blood flowing. The dressing room (bulb-lined mirrors and all) was full of some other guys who, like Sam, were bursting with energy born from both nervousness and excitement. He trailed behind them as they left the room together in a flurry of activity and genuine – and not so genuine – wishes of luck. Dean let the noise wash over him; no need to learn names when you have no future in the business. He’d never really been the stereotypical loud and obnoxious theatre kid anyway. They reached the stage to find the ladies already waiting, buzzing with the same energy as the men.
Aaron passed Dean the joint and Dean let their fingers brush, but couldn’t quite look back at him as he sucked in the smoke himself. He coughed some on the exhale – it had been a while – and when he finally met his eyes, Aaron was smiling. Not laughing at Dean’s decidedly uncool reaction, but happy, and more than a little knowing. Like Dean was cute and he suspected the feeling was mutual. Maybe Dean didn’t blush in the bedroom, but on a couch a few inches away from someone he liked, really liked, there was no stopping its warmth from spreading over his face. Not even in the dream.
Over the next few days, rehearsals continued apace. It turned out that Chuck had a very hands-off directing method, which was odd. Most directors were control freaks of one kind or another, but Chuck was only rarely seen when Sam and Dean were working with Naomi or Crowley, and never when they went to visit members of the crew. He didn’t announce his presence either; Dean would just look up to check his form in the studio mirror, say, and notice a figure sitting in the corner, scribbling feverishly in a notebook. Though if those who’d worked with him before were to be believed, “He likes to spout this ‘free will creativity’ crap, but he’s always watching, trust me.” Ellen’s words.
Slowly, Castiel knelt and grabbed his boxers and the plastic wrapper. He looked up at Dean, and Dean looked down at him, and when their respective positions registered a tiny, traitorous voice in his head said
Neither Dean nor Castiel moved as Joshua slowly rose from his chair and gathered his things. Instead of heading straight for the door, however, he took a detour to where they were still standing side by side, panting and sweaty.
“I want to work with you, but not just for me.” Sam ran a hand through his hair and his eyes darted to the floor and back. “You’d have it in the bag too, you know. When I was singing in diapers you were singing right along with me.”
“That said,” Michael continued, still in his measured, resonant sermon voice, “our company at Paradise Theatre is pleased to welcome everyone, newcomers and veterans alike, and may our journey together be fruitful, and elevate this art we call The Theatre.”
As soon as Crowley dismissed them with a wave of his hand, Dean felt all his dancing energy, all the good it generated, souring into defensiveness and anger. Not even bothering to leave the room, he ripped his sweaty shirt over his head and slipped off his shoes.
“Yeah. And I insulted you, how?” All he could remember from that conversation was the accusation that he didn’t take the show seriously. And then it dawned on him. “You mean when I said— Dude, you can’t tell me no one’s ever pointed out how deep your speaking voice is. You sound like you should be a basso fucking profondo or something.” Castiel just stood there, a completely unfair puppy look on his face, scarily similar to how Sam’s would get whenever John insulted him, like someone he cared about had a negative opinion and now he was self-conscious and ashamed. But Dean couldn’t possibly hold that power over Castiel, could he? “That wasn’t— It’s nothing bad, Cas, it’s just surprising, is all. It’s kind of impressive, actually. You must have a pretty wide range, right?” Castiel shrugged, and while the edges of embarrassment still traced his face, most of the sadness had gone. Dean sucked in a breath; Cas had just bared a lot of his thoughts about Dean to him, and while normally he wouldn’t be worried about reciprocating, there was something so jarring about seeing the normally stoic man so vulnerable.
By the time he was done savoring what he’d seen, Sam was already effusing how great it was, and clapping Castiel on the back. It would be weird for Dean to say anything now, right? So he just smiled at Bela as she left to get a smoke, flashed a thumbs up at Gabe, and let Castiel and Sam talk about…whatever they were talking about; Dean didn’t care.
Suddenly very tired, Dean didn’t bother biting it back any longer. “I wasn’t glaring at you, that first dance day. I mean, I guess I don’t know what sort of look I had on my face, but it wasn’t directed at you.” He crossed his arms, hunched in on himself. “You’re right, you know. I don’t have much training. I have kind of a shitty history with dance. Bad legs for it.”
And maybe, Dean thought, as Castiel kept dancing, jumping into his solo with abandon while Dean watched in awe from the sidelines, soaring higher and higher with every leap, Dean’s stomach swooping as if Cas cradled his soul in his chest and he was flying through the air with him...maybe their date was going to go well. Maybe they’d eat and drink to bursting, and Dean would sing along with his favorite rock songs just to make Cas smile. Maybe they’d go back to Cas’s place, and if neither of them have rehearsal tomorrow maybe they’ll sleep in late. Or maybe they’ll rise with dawn and Cas will throw all his windows open and make good on his
She and Bartholomew immediately set about writing some notes. Dean grabbed his music from Kevin, making sure to thank him – that kid had interpreted the music exactly the way Dean had needed of him – and walked out the door. While the other two paid him no more mind, Dean thought he felt Michael’s eyes on him as he left, but chose not to turn around to find out.
“Don’t worry about it, sonny, I’m here for business, not a guilt trip,” she said. “You two have time for measurements?” When they nodded she gave them a real smile before turning to march out the door. “Come on, then, you know the way.”
Both brothers let the conversation rest for a while. Dean made short work of the last half of the room, and when he was just about finished, Sam straightened off the car and grabbed a brush and dustpan. He bent his tall frame to the task of sweeping up the pile Dean had made and dumping it into the large garbage can in the corner, tapping the pan on the edge. They finished up the closing chores together, falling in sync like the old days even though Sam didn’t do them often anymore, with college demanding so much of his time.
Dean didn’t know if he could take several days of this waiting. But to his surprise he didn’t have to: he was just about to ask Sam what he wanted for dinner when his brother’s phone rang, paralyzing them both. Then Sam fumbled it out of his pocket, and looked back at Dean with wide eyes. “It’s Pam,” he said.
Despite Sam’s eagerness, Dean was able to drag his feet just enough so that the brothers were among the last few cast members to arrive at Paradise for their first rehearsal. The doors to the house were open wide and the lights were up bright. Actors and crew mingled among the blue cushioned seats, mostly concentrated around a table still set up between the front seats and the lip of the stage. Sam bounded toward it and Dean ambled behind.
oh my god), he’d actually given him a look of mild surprise, despite Dean’s halting, ineloquent explanations, gracing him with a “Not bad, Winchester. Let’s put those bowlegs to work.”
If Dean were to take his cues from real rock stars – which he damn well was, thank you very much – there were a lot of dudes to choose from. So many of them knew just how to mix their salty with their sweet. At least Dean could narrow his choices down right away, thanks to Ezra: glam rock was an absolute no-go. The original costume for Tugger was pretty reminiscent of “rockers” like Ladyheart and Twisted Sister (spiked collar but no spiked codpiece, thankfully). Dean’s Tugger wasn’t going to need such an excess of makeup and costuming to keep people’s interest. Most glam was all style and no substance, and shitty style at that. Dean wanted style that accentuated his substance. The character of Rum Tum Tugger was based on good old Mick, so Dean just had to put a little Jagger in his swagger. Can’t go wrong there. The
He didn’t even realize until he stripped down for bed that night that in his haste he’d left his boxers at the theatre. Oh well, whatever. At least there was no reason for Castiel to have noticed that, either.
Shit. “You, uh, saw that did you?” He swallowed down the spike of anxiety that flashed through his chest.
The tail end of Sam’s triumphant laughter was drowned out when Dean turned the car on and the engine grumbled into life.
And at last, Midas again, a coda at the end of the show. Tea lights floated around the pool casting a dim light on the man so changed from when he last was onstage. Suit rumpled, tie backwards, trench coat dirty and torn, he’d traveled to the ends of the earth to find a cure and finally, finally his daughter moved, and hugged him as soon as she woke, a true miracle, and not a single person in that theatre wasn’t crying the same tears of joy as Midas cried, as Castiel cried, and it was the most moved by theatre Dean had ever been that he could remember, and he didn’t want that moment ruined for him.
Dean shook his head and turned his back on Sam, standing in front of him at the barre and effectively ending the conversation. He kept his head facing forward, proud as a soldier, willing the music to start already so he could just forget the past several minutes and think of nothing more than relaxing his body and warming up before the real work began. But after a moment he felt a thin prickling along his skin, like someone, or everyone, was watching him, and years of hanging with rougher crowds in school and tougher neighborhoods in Chicago and dragging his dad out of skeevy biker bars in Bumfuck, America meant he could only ignore it for so long before instinct compelled him to look for the source. When he caved and scanned the rest of the room, his eyes locked,
. Magic, then, is as inherent to a cat as any other part of its nature…so even though Mr. Mistoffelees is the actual magical cat (Castiel on the other side of the studio, leaping so high he was practically levitating how the hell did he do that?! That’s not easy for a man of his size at all), Tugger had to have his own way about it. Maybe not magic, per se…magic acts were just another kind of performance, and he was the Curious Cat, after all, and curious had more than one meaning. Ah, and as it said in his own song,
He thought that was that, until the lobby door opened and Bobby stuck his head back in. “It’s Pam,” he said. He waited until Dean reluctantly set down his brush, and kept watching as Dean made his way over. The old coot knew he was far too likely to slip out the backdoor and hide.
They twisted together, curving their necks around so they could kiss again. Dean thrust his ass back into Cas’s hips in turn, Cas kept one of his hands wrapped around Dean’s chest, rubbing at his left nipple – point of weakness exploited for all its worth – while the other snuck down to the waist of his pants, pulled the lace, and peeled his pants and underwear down just enough for his cock to spring free.
“I love you, Dean. It was good talking to you. But I wish we were in the same place because more than anything right now I want to hug you.”
It couldn’t be denied, though, that their work was fantastic. The last production he’d seen there was the premiere of a
There were only a few beats between the end of the refrain and Mistoffelees taking up his own narrative for a few lines. But it was just enough for their characters to share a moment. And when their eyes did meet, there Novak was, with that supercilious look on his face, like his aloof character but worse, looking down his nose at Dean, and his character, and Dean couldn’t quite mold his face into a genuine, surprised, happy-to-see-you smile.
; there isn’t a high school in all America that doesn’t perform the musical, but damn if it hadn’t felt special at the time, getting cast as Danny his senior year. The actors always helped with tech to get the full theatre experience – not that Dean hadn’t already had plenty of experience by then – but he’d no reason to complain when he was given the task of painting the car with Cassie, the talented and gorgeous girl who’d been cast as Sandy. He remembered catching her eyes and blushing, how she couldn’t seem to stop smiling. He remembered the flash of bravery he’d felt, deciding hey, they were wearing old clothes anyway, right? And flicking some paint on Cassie’s arms. How she’d shrieked in mock outrage and retaliated. How they’d laughed and laughed. How they danced together (he loved watching her curls bounce) and sang together (her voice so clear and sweet) and fell for each other just like their characters did. They experienced the bloom and blush of first love together, lost their virginities together; they made vows and oaths with sights set on forever.
” with all the force afforded to him from his giant lungs, Dean smiled, smug. Sam had this in the bag.
Like she’d flipped some kind of switch, tears welled up in his eyes. He ran his hand down his face and stared at the ceiling, willing them to go away. “I don’t think I can do this, mom.”
“Good, I want you to try on what I mocked up for you.” She put her notebook down on the sewing table and lifted what had looked just like a scrap of black fabric, but turned out to be a unitard. “You’ll need a dance belt.”
Singer’s Theatre and Prop Shop, a small converted warehouse tucked unassumingly in the middle of the sprawl of Chicago, was the closest thing Dean Winchester had left to a home. This was partly because it belonged to Bobby, who’d known him and his little brother Sam since the Winchesters had moved to the city as kids. He’d been the technical director for Paradise Theatre Company at the time. Now he kept himself busy in his retirement by building commissioned pieces in his own shop, puttering around at leisure in his uniform of worn flannel and a ball cap. But it felt like home even when Bobby wasn’t around; having an actor for a mother meant that Dean had grown up exploring the nooks and crannies of theatres, all of which had their own souls but were nevertheless the same: dark stages flanked by shadowy wings, cramped dressing rooms with bulb-lined mirrors, workshops full of tools where sets sat half-built, like creatures waiting to be born. Nothing was more familiar to him than the smell of sawdust and the weight of a drill in his hand.
The next morning was the first dance rehearsal, and the entire cast was called. Dean didn’t bother dragging his feet today, making them more than fifteen minutes early, so they were surprised to find most of the cast already standing outside the studio clogging the hallway. “Are we late?” Sam fretted.
So Dean tried it. He swirled and sneered around the studio, put a little Axl Rose “Sweet Child O’ Mine” sway into his hips, but it still didn’t fit quite right. The spotlight felt right, that was for sure, but when he thought of the original choreography, the lady cats squealing and pawing at him while he laughed and pushed them away—that’s what felt wrong. Dean’s Tugger did not feel like that kind of showboat. Plenty of rockers were probably assholes, true, but that’s not what Dean admired about them. Rock was also poetry, like Led Zeppelin; next-level artistry like The Jimi Hendrix Experience; the motherfucking jukebox heroes of Foreigner. So Dean’s Tugger could be a little like Robert Plant, able to seduce, but still be like Jimi Hendrix, who exuded sex appeal without ever bothering to try. Yeah, Tugger was definitely hot-blooded. Oh—not magic, Dean realized. Rum Tum Tugger had to be
“Oh, well,” Dean paused, momentarily derailed by this unexpected pronouncement, “thanks, I guess? But I only ever tried out because Sam wanted me to audition with him. I never expected to get cast, so believe me, I’m just as surprised as you are that I’m here.”
, too, reasoning that getting burned by three costars was more than enough for a lifetime, but who could have expected Aaron, with his lopsided smile and soft hands and—)
But all the work he’d been putting in was paying off in spades, and Sam was with him every step of the way, and Dean Winchester never backed down from a fight, even against himself. So he drew his rock star swagger around himself like a cloak, and settled in for the ride. It wasn’t difficult, he was happy to find. It was easy to smirk and wink at all the actors, girls and guys, who were all so pretty and talented. And though he’d been dancing almost every day these last couple weeks, he was startled to realize he was
It was an adventure, sometimes, but the precarious balance their parents had reached came crashing down when John returned from one of his jaunts, and admitted to having an affair with a painter living in Minnesota, and that that woman was now pregnant.
Sam and Dean both floated through the morning of auditions, feeling a little strange. While never a part of the company, the building of Paradise Theatre itself was known to them, though their habit had been to sneak in through the back. Dean sometimes forgot how grand it was from the front, even in daylight when the blue and white lights of the marquee were dark. It had a façade that allowed it to fit in the affluent area near the Magnificent Mile; it was several stories tall with neo-Renaissance influence and some old Chicago style. Enormous windows towered a few floors high in graceful arches, with smaller windows neatly stacked on top like extra layers of cake. Presiding over the grand white building were two statues of angels poised in action, wings spread high over their shoulders, spears pointed toward the ground far below as if they were ready to smite at a moment’s notice. There were three large sets of doors that stood propped open on warm performance nights, letting in the cool air that blew into the city off Lake Michigan. They were closed now, but unlocked, and the brothers trailed behind a few other hopefuls as they stepped inside.
There was a noise out in the hallway, and thinking it was footsteps Dean stopped playing. Was Sam here? He cocked his head to listen: nothing. The theatre, though nicely remodeled, was old, and so something in the walls was probably settling, Dean figured. Shaken out of his mood, though, when he went back to playing – his hands drifted to the keys almost of their own accord – he started out softly with a little “
“You’d be wasting your breath.” When she didn’t say anything else, just waited him out, Dean sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. He knew exactly what she was getting at but he didn’t want the mind games. “Sam’s got it in his head that I’m trying to bomb the audition, but I’m not.”
is just a group of people trained to act a certain way in life and only feel when they’re directed to do so. And for some reason when I heard you laughing, you sounded so happy…”
Cas hummed, sounding content, and Dean felt the deep vibrations roll through his skin and into his bones. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m in this place all the time and I never look out at the view. I can almost understand why they called it Paradise.”
They slipped into the wings and backstage. The workshop, as wide as the stage and twice as deep, directly abutted the backstage area so sets could be rolled out directly when needed. Upstairs was Ellen Harvelle’s space, where she kept her stable of lighting instruments and gels of every color. Below in the basement, next to where the orchestra practiced and settled into their pit, or actors waited to be sent up through the stage floor, Ezra Moore had her seemingly endless catalog of costumes. Sam and Dean walked past these old haunts of theirs, past the dozens of ropes and pulleys that made up the flies, past the stairs to the catwalks, past the dressing rooms, and into the labyrinthine hallways that made up the rest of the building.
So it was that Dean found himself cast as the lead in his first play, feeding his brother every night, and falling head over heels for Robin, the Juliet to his Romeo. His first relationship born out of the destruction of another. She couldn’t understand the dark turn his life had taken, and he couldn’t let her see the hurt and the horror he held inside. She broke up with him, in the end, and thus his curse began. Dean was doomed to live love only through art, like his mother, and doomed to love only the artists in his life, like his father. And just like his parents, his love will never be requited in just the way he needs, because whether the romance in a show is realistic and complex, or sweeping and melodramatic, he gets suckered in by it every damn time.
Crowley wanted to work with the main players before bringing in the whole cast, tailoring the choreography to what magic happens during rehearsal. So today it would just be Dean, Castiel, and Joshua, their Old Deuteronomy.
They were all baritones, Dean figured, given that he and Sam had been called at the same time, and his old costar Victor Henrikson was chatting with someone just outside the doorway. He glanced up at the new arrivals and did a double-take before his face broke out into a surprised smile. “Dean Winchester, as I live and breathe,” he said, pulling him in by the hand and slapping him on the back.
“All you have to do is show up and sing a little with your brother,” she said, more gently. “You’ll be fine. I wouldn’t have let you audition if I didn’t know you could handle it.”
“Seriously, Dean, what’s your hang up?” he asked, getting a little hot under the collar. “Mom? Dad? I know it’s not Bobby, he’d cut your hours down in a heartbeat if it meant you were in a show again.”
Sam had been even less sympathetic, wearing an “I told you so” smirk on his face all evening and into the next morning. Chicago was loud and awake for rush hour, but once they slipped into one of the side doors of Paradise, a hush drew over them. There were far fewer people in the building, so noise traveled. The brothers would have found their way easily to the room where callbacks were being held even if they hadn’t already known the layout, from all the voices alone. Men were talking and warming up, some still out in the hallway for a few more deep breaths before the plunge.
“You…got you here,” Dean retorted, but he’d let it go. Didn’t even bring it up when he’d seen Sam scanning the crowd anyway. Not even when he started getting pissy after the endorphins of graduating had worn off, slamming doors and not wanting to talk about anything but working toward auditions. Dean didn’t blame him, he really didn’t, but when the kid started getting too pushy he pushed back. They fought and accusations were thrown and honestly, Bobby’s shop was the safest place to be right now.
Dean paused with the door to his baby (the ’67 Chevy Impala their dad had left them when he’d moved to Minnesota) half-open. “What?”
They went straight to the studio with the idea of beginning warmups, but found it already occupied. Since the door was open they stepped inside to see what was going on and found only four people: Crowley, Gabe, Bela, and Castiel. “Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer” without a doubt, and Gabe and Bela were fascinating to watch. With dance shoes on they were just about the same height, mirroring each other’s movements but in their own styles; Gabriel’s being cheeky and hers suave, they managed to meet somewhere in the middle at sly, self-satisfied criminal, and their antics had Dean smiling almost immediately.
And yet…he couldn’t deny he missed it. He missed the freedom that acting provided, the camaraderie of a cast, and the catharsis of performance. Most of all, though, Dean missed Sam. He missed singing with him and practicing with him and seeing him for more than the 20 minutes it took him to eat breakfast and run out the door for class. If this was going to be his last chance to spend quality time with his little brother, if this was really what would make him happy?
“I believe what he meant to say, boys, is that the story was lost amid your differences,” he said. “The cats aren’t here to squabble. After almost an entire musical in which each cat’s individuality is celebrated, two of the most disparate characters join together to unite under a common cause. The…antagonistic contest you’ve turned the dance into isn’t keeping in spirit with the music. Do you understand?”
Dean was so relaxed after his little bit of catharsis, and so confident of Sam’s success, the part he thought he’d struggle with the most didn’t bother him at all: the dance audition. He didn’t really dance anymore, unless you could count shimmying around the kitchen as he cooked. Sure, he did what he had to to stay fit and flexible, but stretching and simple exercise were hardly art.
Besides, he could begrudgingly admit, if only to himself, that he understood her a little better now. He’d been so close to leaving it all behind after Ellie said she didn’t feel the same, that her plan had always been to go home and she thought they were just both having fun…Learning that someone you love isn’t as committed to your relationship as you are does something to you, and he can only imagine how compounded that feeling of betrayal would have been after all the years Mary had spent with John.
Cas reeled him back in. “No one to go with me. Can you imagine any of my cousins there, or even my sister?”
And he did. He stayed put when Cas’s hands moved back along his arms, over his shoulders, back down to his torso stroking, pinching, teasing every inch of Dean’s bare skin. When he thumbed his nipple Dean gasped, and Cas gave him a wicked smile in the mirror as he brought his hands up to pinch them both at once. Castiel was merciless: his hands in constant motion, his eyes fixed on every little action he could eke from him. Dean couldn’t hide the stuttering of his breath anymore, his muscles jumping on full display in the mirror no matter how hard he tried to be still and pretend this wasn’t affecting him as much as it was.
And yet, if he was going to interpret the song in this way, there were things that Dean had never really associated with Tugger that he had to embody, too.
“H- hey everybody!” he said. There was a stark difference between him and the two Miltons next to him: short where they were tall, bearded where they were clean-shaven, and in baggy, regular clothes where they wore professional and fitted outfits. “I may be the director, but you can just call me Chuck.” He gave them an awkward little wave.
“Flirt,” she retorted, but her eyes were twinkling. “Mostly it made me want to put you in an actual suit. With your lines, you’d look divine in a three-piece.”
The lobby of Singer’s Theatre and Prop Shop was pretty small, as most of the building was taken up by the shop itself. It had the same concrete floor as the rest of the shop and the walls were painted all white. The spartan feel was softened by a few large, dark-cushioned chairs and the many pictures Bobby had hung of his crowning technical achievements. Pam was not out of place in the relaxed atmosphere, wearing a nice leather jacket and jeans. When she saw Dean walk into the room she pushed her sunglasses up onto the top of her head. “Hello, grumpy,” she drawled.
He stopped sweeping. From the far corner, a DJ and his co-host filled the airwaves with muted laughter. Dean squeezed the broom handle, watching his knuckles turn white. He hesitantly started up again and swallowed the lump in his throat. “Well I’m not the bitch who decided taking on both parts one and two of Angels in America on top of a full course load was a good idea.”
So why not pick “Why Should I Wake Up?” Why not express himself through the words of Clifford Bradshaw, caught in his whirlwind romance with cabaret star Sally, ensnared in the drug-laden doomsday society of Weimar Berlin with disaster breathing down their necks? The words of someone who let himself go even though he knew it was wrong, just because it felt so good in the now?
His thoughts were so heavy and distracting, Dean started when Castiel circled his arms around his waist. A parody of their position earlier. “You’re pretty tense for what we just did, unless—” he stiffened. “You don’t want…?” He started drawing back, and before Dean even came to a decision in his brain his hands acted of their own accord and grabbed Cas’s wrists, keeping him close. Dean’s throat closed up and he couldn’t get a word out, wouldn’t know what to say anyway, but the gesture seemed to be enough for Cas. He relaxed against Dean’s back, wrapped his arms more securely around his waist, and rested his chin on Dean’s shoulder, but not before giving him a little kiss on the soft spot behind his ear. That…that didn’t
Rowena’s reputation was so fierce the news didn’t settle Dean at all. He’d heard she was the worst sort of diva in an age when a lot fewer people had tolerance for that kind of bullshit, but he had to admit he’d never seen a more convincing Lady Macbeth.
A deep voice, rough, but not from smoke. A form coalesced in the haze: human, masculine, but not quite right. Ah, wings. The man-like figure had large, white wings, and as Dean’s vision cleared he saw the strength of his bare legs, the breadth of his shoulders, and knew it was Castiel, dressed as Eros. The wings were real, though, and they flapped and shivered, brushing away the remnants of the smoke. There was no white cloth around his head to blindfold him, and Dean wondered why he didn’t turn to look, thought maybe he couldn’t or shouldn’t, and Dean wasn’t sure he wanted him to besides. But he’d been so alone, and so frightened, and he’d welcome anyone’s face now, even his. “Cas?” he asked, no more than a whisper.
Bobby snorted. “What, is that supposed to surprise me?” he said, turning back to the designs he was fiddling with on the table. “Idjit.”
begins, it shows he’s the leader of the cats; and since the line brings to mind the softness and vulnerability of kittens, it’s a clue that he is the one who knows and protects all the others.
He didn’t know if it was the vastness of the lake making him feel small, the steady warmth seeping into his back, or if he was just plain tired, but something gave him the courage to ask – somehow he had no fucks left to give – “Did you mean it?” The barest whisper.
“I just don’t want to, jesus.” Dean kept his eyes trained on the long thin pile of sawdust accumulating along the front edge of the bristles.
A particularly cat thing to say, Dean figured, a warning veiled as silly wordplay. An outright insult to dogs, too. It’s clever, taking an old saying and turning it on its head. These two dichotomies – dogs vs. cats and expected vs. unexpected – were as indicative of Tugger’s character as anything else. His song was full of “if not this, then that” situations (
Now that was the question, wasn’t it. All Dean had ever wanted was for people to stay, was for someone to care enough to ask him to stay, and he knew Cas didn’t mean it that way but hearing the word plucked all his nerves like strings and he had to bite back a moan when he answered, “I’ll stay, Cas.”
A moment of silence as they both warred with their anger. Then Dean shook his head sharply. This was never going to work. Maybe he should just burn his bridges now and save the company the trouble of doing it later. “Whatever,” he snapped, moving to walk past Castiel and out of the studio.
He sighed, mostly for show. “Yeah, yeah.” He decided he didn’t need to put on his pants to go look; there was no one around to see him wandering in boxers but Sam, and he saw that every morning so he’d just have to deal.
“I don’t believe you,” was the immediate reply. “I know you like working with Bobby but you love performing, Dean. When Brady completely flaked on me for my directing practicum last semester, you think I don’t know why you agreed to step into his role instead?”
Sam tossed his backpack onto the blond wooden bench that lined the north wall and stepped up to the passenger side of the car. “The shop is closer than home. Thought I’d catch a ride back with you.”
These failed relationships, from his parents to now, colored how he saw theatre, no matter what angle he looked at it from. So when it came time to think very seriously about how he wanted to represent himself at his audition, it wasn’t about reaching for a future in performance—how could he, when he was stuck in the past? Wallowing in how, despite already having sons, his father so heavily favored his new one. How, despite her love for her family, his mother couldn’t ignore it when opportunity came knocking from far away. How the women – and man – whom he’d fallen for had all left him too, in the end, because of shitty circumstances and the lack of depth in the feelings they had for him, his own inability to inspire real love in others, and his total madness in stepping into the same trap again and again and
Since today they were more concerned about learning the nuances of the new musical arrangement rather than really acting, Dean was able to maintain his veneer of pleasantness without saying a word except to acknowledge Naomi’s notes and mark them in his music. All the while he was seething
At least all that extra time spent with the car meant he’d gotten the curves shaped perfectly. Dean was in the middle of painting the frame white and carefully covering the seams of his additions when a loud buzz zipped through the shop. Dean and Bobby glanced at each other across room, playing a silent game of chicken to see who got to go to the lobby and be the public face of the shop. Dean won when he gestured toward himself, splattered here and there with wet paint. Bobby sighed, lifted his baseball cap to run a hand through his hair, and settled it back on his head. He muttered “idjit” just loud enough that Dean could hear it.
Bobby glanced back over and gave him a shrewd look from beneath the brim of his hat. “Then it’s the right song, Dean. Forget the rest.”
“Because my cousin Samandriel was starring in it. You probably knew him by his nickname. He prefers to go by Alfie.”
As strange as the little guy was, Dean found Chuck’s presence more palatable than Michael’s or Raphael’s. Both the SM and AD were formal to the point of stiffness, even to their cousins and siblings. Michael stared very coldly in between jotting down staging notes, and Raphael exuded an aloof, holier-than-thou aura, like the actors were bugs he could squish and it’d be all the same to him. That attitude Luc Milton definitely shared, always striding around like he personally owned the place; Gabe was less on the “holier-than-thou” side than the “bugs it’d be fun to squish,” but at least he was a bit funnier about it, Dean begrudgingly had to admit. The staring seemed to run in the immediate family, though, because Mike’s little siblings Hannah and Castiel were in a permanent state of eyes wide and watching whenever they weren’t – and sometimes when they were – in character. The fact that their big blues were trained on Dean at least half the time was just something he had to learn to live with (“No I am not imagining it, Sammy, shut up!”).
This is where people came to work, so nothing was so rich as the lobby and the house, and much had been remodeled with a modern touch. Many of the corridors had sensible tile flooring and plain white walls lined with posters, neatly framed and proclaiming the names of shows performed there in centuries past. Farther into the innards of the theatre, there were the offices of the administrators and designers, dance studios large and small, and music rooms, too. It had been a while since they’d roamed the halls, but Dean was surprised to find himself comfortable. The brothers climbed a back stairway and turned a corner to see a hallway lined with plastic chairs, a few of which were filled with other actors. A couple others were pacing up and down, going through vocal exercises, their “mi-me-ma” and “puh-tuh-kuh-tuh” echoing off the walls.
extolling the virtues of cats. There was no slacking off there: the song began by weaving solo phrases together from each cat beginning, of course, with Munkustrap (Dean couldn’t help but swell with pride at the idea of Sam kicking off the show every night). Then the cats came together to sing like a traditional choir, blending and harmonizing and holding notes out at the top of their respective ranges. It was a grueling first rehearsal, Naomi’s ear catching every hint of imperfection, where there was nothing but the music, the rests, and the deep breaths they took to power their voices. When Naomi dismissed them it broke their intense concentration, so they were all surprised to find they had gained themselves an audience of one in the meantime.
Castiel seemed to realize it the same time, and immediately let go and stepped back. Almost warily his eyes flicked down to where his hands at been, and then widened when he noticed Dean’s state of dress.
That’s not all a rock star is, though, because no one partied like a rocker, either. Rum Tum Tugger is in no way a villain. He might not be a leader like his brother Munkustrap, or share his responsibilities, but he doesn’t hesitate to point out how to rescue Old Deuteronomy
He slouched further into his seat and stewed, and stopped paying attention halfway through Chuck’s telling a story about a cat that belonged to his ex-girlfriend Becky. Dean only snapped back into it when Ellen, lighting designer and longtime friend of Bobby’s, stepped onstage and unerringly set her sharp eyes on them, in that scary mom way she had about her. She always did have some freaky sixth sense for when Sam or Dean was about to get themselves into trouble. Other major members of the crew were introduced: aside from Naomi and Crowley there was the set designer Balthazar Milton, costume designer Ezra Moore, and of course Bobby’s replacement as TD, a laidback, skinny little dude with the incongruously pompous name of Garth Fitzgerald IV. More than half of these people would go down in history as some of the best to ever grace the business. This was the real opportunity Sam had somehow dropped into and Dean had to help him make the most of it. So he tried to forget Castiel and the stiff set of his shoulders, because who cared about him or anyone else.
Cas’s frown grew thunderous. “You’re saying that just because the characters are animals, that we don’t have to take this seriously? That T.S. Eliot has nothing deeper to say? Or is it just that you’re one of those people who dismiss Andrew Lloyd Webber’s music due to its popularity? What
Then the banging would stop. Maybe dinner was in the oven, or maybe Mary had worn out her ire with vigorous mashing or mixing, but eventually Dean would see her lingering in the doorway, watching her sons and eyeing her husband with a complex expression Dean couldn’t, and still really didn’t, understand. After a bit she would lean over the back of the old couch, lightly pull the TV remote from John’s hand, and hit the mute button. Then
Then Eros, another lover, Love itself. Blindfolded, bewinged, little more than a cloth wrapped around his hips, his immortality should have made him invulnerable, but even he could not escape his own arrows. He fell for a mortal woman, Psyche, though they were married under the condition that she could never look upon her husband in the light, both of them blind to each other in order to be equal in trust and love. But poisonous lies were whispered in her ears, and she began to doubt him, and believed him a monster, and when wax dripped onto his chest from her illicit candle, oh how he cried out from its burn…
Sam smiled, so bright and happy Dean thought he’d lift off the couch and hover. “Holy shit, holy shit, Dean!”
Dean imagined Castiel, alone in another of the theatre’s practice rooms, squinting at his music and nibbling on his pencil, hair stuck up every which way like a hedgehog and making that displeased little huff that Dean was all too familiar with—it was fucking adorable, is what it was, and Dean didn’t like it. It didn’t jibe with what Castiel was like in reality. Sure, the dude might be taking the show seriously, but he didn’t have to worry about it making or breaking his career. Nepotism would get him everywhere, while Sam had the entire production sitting on his shoulders, and a bright future that could be snuffed out like a candle with a single negative word whispered by the wrong person.
He leaned over the scant space between them, let the hand still on his face lead him, pressed their lips together. Opened his mouth and let Aaron breathe the smoke into him, and he didn’t cough this time, trading thick air and tongues and Dean wondered at his amazing lips, which you might mistake for a woman’s, and his soft beard, which you never would, and he loved it, forgot about his father, forgot about bullies, forgot about any reason at all he’d ever had not to sleep with men because Aaron was funny and talented and seemed to like Dean too, and Dean wanted this kiss to last forever, so he kissed and kissed and kissed in the dream, long after they’d had to come up for fresh air in real life, and as soon as Dean realized it he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t breathe, the smoke thick and cloying in his throat, hot and scratchy and surrounding him and Aaron was gone, had left him, left him behind just like everyone else, he was alone and he couldn’t see he couldn’t
Dean drove home to their apartment afterward, since neither of them had anything pressing to do. They didn’t speak; Dean grabbed them a couple beers from the fridge and they plopped down on the couch. After a minute Sam turned on the TV, but what was airing Dean was hard pressed to follow. He felt his phone burning in his pocket, certain every other minute that he’d felt it vibrate, dreading a call from Pam. Because that last song had felt
really had been that perfect: In the show, each of the ten actors had to play multiple characters in wildly different interpretations of Greek myths. Castiel had outshone them all, effortlessly switching from one to the next. First he’d appeared as Midas, a businessman in a nice suit with his hair neatly combed, schmoozing the audience like some ad exec or salesman, ignoring his young daughter even as she played beside him. He never realized her true worth until, caught up in his newfound gift, he accidentally turned her to gold and she was lost to him…
Dean took the bait, the old one-upmanship they’d shared when working together flaring back up. “Oh, you think you’re competition, do you?”
To make matters worse, the day he had singing rehearsal for the song with no one but Castiel, Dean put some morning hours in at Bobby’s shop. He’d gotten so into sanding down some columns to make them look weathered that he was just about riding the line of being late. He was still in his shop clothes, a dirty shirt and pants covered in paint splatter, and he was sure a cloud of sawdust hung heavily about him. When he finally got to the music room where Naomi, Kevin, and Castiel were already waiting, he was out of breath and out of sorts.
“Look,” said Sam. “Maybe it’s been years for you and I’ve never auditioned for a professional company before, but we can do it together. Now’s the time. You and me.” He nudged Dean with his elbow. “There is no other road, no other way. No day but today.”
. This contrary attitude epitomized Rum Tum Tugger. The threat and danger of his very first line was something Dean had to embrace, because Tugger was not one to back down from a conflict. That was incredibly rock’n’roll. No one accepts and explores the violence, darkness, and combativeness of human nature better than a rocker.
. And at least he’d had the excuse of a new baby, once their half-brother was born, but all Mary’d had was Mary Campbell’s career, and Sam and Dean had been left with nothing but each other. Dean was sure she could’ve taken as much comfort in her sons as they’d have taken in their mother. But what was done was done.
“And skinny, too. Now look.” She curled the tape around Sam’s upper arm and jotted down another measurement in her notebook. “You’ve got some muscle.” Sam whined in embarrassment. Ezra winked at Dean from behind Sam’s back, but she let off her teasing to finish her work, getting all the waist, torso, and leg numbers she needed. “Alright, get your clothes back on. Come here, Dean.” The brothers switched places.
Dean shrugged, and neither of them pushed. Left to his own thoughts, he let his eyes wander along the walls; he rarely looked at the pictures anymore, since he’d seen them a million times and usually used the backdoor anyway. He lingered on the one directly across from him, the biggest frame in the lobby and hard to miss. It pictured one of Bobby’s most impressive builds at Paradise, an unusually complex set for
“Sorry, the Gossip-in-Chief wasn’t in for long.” Bobby always claimed to be out of the game, but often knew what was going on in Chicago’s theatre community before the community itself did.
Holy crap, Dean had not been expecting that, one shock after another, Castiel’s real voice was the ocean rough tone of Poseidon
and the like wasn’t false modesty at all. Maybe Dean could play those lines straight and matter-of-fact, saying “This is who I am, you never have to doubt it, and there’s no doing anything about it.” Fun? Yes. Devilish? Hell yeah. Polarizing? Comes with the territory. But always, always honest. Rum Tum Tugger is showing up to the Jellicle Ball and he’s here to have a good time, and screw the rest. Everyone was welcome to join his rebellion or not at their pleasure, but
with all the pride he felt for him in this, the beginning of his ascent. Sam’s eyes brightened when he saw him, heard him, a smile creeping up his own face so that when he took back the narrative, singing
There was no accompaniment; just the voice, singing something that sounded a bit like church music. And not the fun gospel stuff, but the old epic baroque shit, in Latin, Dean thought. The style was secondary to the voice itself, which was singular and clear, a baritone though with an impressive range on either end of the scale, and expertly controlled as it moved up and down the staff. It held the notes pure, with no excess in vibrato or unused air, flying up into the catwalks as if on an expressway to heaven. Seriously, this dude had the voice of an angel, and not the cutesy kind, either, chubby babies staring dreamily out from the edges of old paintings. He had the voice of a real one, like the statues in the lobby of Paradise come to life; it carried the full on terrifying beauty of an Old Testament angel, as likely to destroy as bring tidings of joy. Maybe a little of both.
“You still love it, don’t you?” Sam persisted. “You said it yourself, Mom and Dad don’t get an opinion on this. What is it that you want?”
Then Castiel’s fingers flexed, and Dean knew they did because when they’d bumped into each other he’d caught him round the waist and for a split second Castiel’s hands were exerting pressure on Dean’s bare skin
. And when it feels that good, it’s something you can’t hide, and even though he kept telling himself they got singled out just because of Sam, they could have paired him with anyone in that room.
“Are you like Joe?” Aaron asked. His hand not holding the joint reached up and slowly caressed his jaw, brought his thumb up to trace his bottom lip. His eyes followed the movement, then he lifted them to Dean’s, rich and brown and intent. “Never been with a man before?”
“I, uh. I maybe already told Pam to get an audition slot for both of us?” Sam’s smile grew sheepish and he hunched his shoulders in an effort to look smaller, his whole body screaming,
Hm, primarily a dancing role. He wondered whether she was the woman who’d led their dance auditions.
Instead of answering Dean’s questioning look, Cas tucked his fingers under the hem of his white tank and traced the tips lightly along Dean’s sides, raising his eyebrows. Dean nodded up once and lifted his arms, took the brief moment when fabric was covering his head to gulp. It’d been almost a year since he’d last had sex, never having the energy to gear himself up for a lackluster one night stand after Aaron had left him. And now that his anger for Castiel had been subsumed by lust, all that adrenaline was making every touch, every movement sharp and crystal clear. Cas tugged his black tank off one handed, and Dean groaned as their bare chests met. Goosebumps rippled across his skin, whether from his sweat in the cool air, or the way Cas was now running his hands down his back, or both—Dean didn’t know, but it didn’t matter, because now that they were flush again, Dean could feel that Cas was already as hard as Dean (christ but they’d gotten worked up quickly). Their kissing turned messy as their hips couldn’t help but join the action.
He stood stock still as Ezra put in a couple more pins, and moved only when she helped him carefully step out of the unitard so that he didn’t disturb any of them.  “All done, sweetheart. Don’t be a stranger, now.”
They’d barely sat down when the cast grew quiet. Raphael wandered a bit stage right while Michael took the lead down center. He solemnly opened his arms and looked down on his audience with a smile that even from his distance Dean saw was patronizing. “Welcome, everyone, to
“And pick the right size, you kook,” Ezra warned him as he walked out the door. “I’ll know if it doesn’t fit!”
They kicked their shirts away from the center of the floor and found their marks, gazes snagging each other in their characters’ poses, and waited. And waited. They burst out laughing. Cas ran over to the stereo to start the song in the right place and Dean hurried to turn on the lights. And this time, when Cas appeared to the imaginary audience, he tossed a sly look in his direction like Dean was finally in on the joke, like maybe he’d been in on it all along. Maybe Rum Tum Tugger had been in on the joke all along, too. Maybe Mistoffelees calling him a bore was another joke, a misdirect before he slunk off to find Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, his kittens-in-crime. Maybe Mistoffelees reveals himself when he does not just because the cats all needed him but also because it was Tugger who called him. Maybe Dean really was perfectly matched to Castiel across from him on the stage his family had built but that they were going to make their own.
had me fooled, I mean.” Another pause. “I think if I’d really believed you had left performance behind you I wouldn’t have convinced my professors to let you in. But I did, and
before moving onto the next measurement. She knew everything that happened in her domain, of course. “You pulled it off. Might need to let out the shoulders a bit these days.” He huffed a small laugh, glad she wasn’t making a big deal out of it. Not that seeing a man in a dress – or a teenager, as the case had been – would faze much of anyone involved in theatre, but he could still imagine what his dad might have said if he’d known that’s what was happening when he left them behind on his road trips. What he might say even now.
“Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer” took place directly after “The Rum Tum Tugger” in the musical, so Gabe and Bela weren’t going to be included in Dean’s fast paced number, instead getting a brief rest before their showstopper. Castiel, however, was included, so when Sam went to talk to Crowley, he came over to get his water bottle which, to Dean’s chagrin, was situated not too far from where he was standing. Dean decided to ignore him, until he saw that even as Castiel was gulping down his water, his eyes were flicked to the side, staring him down.
Dean snapped his phone closed in a daze and looked at Bobby, who was waiting to hear what it was all about with his eyebrows raised high. “I, uh, I made callbacks.”
In the old days learning ballet had been de rigueur for stage actors even aside from musical-specific dance classes, and Mary Campbell had been no exception. Dean (and later Sam) had followed in her footsteps for a while, and he’d enjoyed it at first. Then puberty had come, and words like
Of course, just because there wasn’t any dense language to get into didn’t mean that their whip cracking the day before hadn’t gotten Dean’s gears turning. Having to sing the prologue over and over again really drove home the lyrics, since every line was a cat listing what, exactly, it means to be a cat. What was interesting about the song, Dean decided, was how each lyric applied to all cats but was especially true of whoever sang it. This was particularly obvious in Sam’s opening line,
That wasn’t a no. “Please, none of that Vince Vincente crap. My Rum Tum Tugger is a real rocker, okay?”
And maybe when the show’s had its run and they’re no longer costars they’ll kiss some more, and it won’t be a goodbye. Because maybe, just maybe, Dean had found someone who felt just as deeply as him.
Thankfully Crowley had decided he needed a little chitchat with the Novaks, and the rest of the cast was so buzzed that Dean’s weirdness went unnoticed. He hustled to take up a spot next to Sam, whose eyes were shining like he’d witnessed some kind of miracle. “Wow, they’re good enough they probably could dance professionally, don’t you think? They’re really something.” He shook out his ridiculous – though very much straight – sasquatch legs.
“They’re saying Chuck wants to revamp the whole thing,” Sam said, voice carrying easily across the room. Chuck, part of the Shurley branch of Milton empire, was the current head of the company and directed all their shows. He was notoriously reclusive and rumored to be hip-deep in the sauce, but in The Family’s eye he could do no wrong. “It’s not going to be a revival of the original production, though,” he continued. “It’s going to be a complete new show from the ground up. New choreography, new characterizations, everything. People at school are already saying it’s going to become the new standard. And I’d hardly call the fourth longest running show on Broadway a
was a favorite of Mary’s, being a rock opera that fulfilled both the hard and soft sides of her musical taste. It happened to be one of the few musicals that John enjoyed as well, probably for the same reason. And because of that, Dean couldn’t listen to it without thinking of the two of them in their little home in Kansas, where John was an auto mechanic and Mary took care of her young sons, but still dreamed of the big time. They loved each other but fought so much, both of them the strong and stubborn type (at least Sam and Dean came by it honestly). At first it was just little storms that brewed between them. Mary would stomp off into the kitchen and start banging pots and pans around, while John grumpily plopped onto the ugly, burnt orange couch and turned on the TV. Dean would often be sitting on the brown carpet in front of him, trying to teach baby Sammy how to roll a ball back and forth upon the floor.
But then the music was on, and there was neither Crowley nor Joshua, nor even the mirror where they should have been checking their form; there were only Cas’s judging eyes and perfect poise, and Dean’s determination to prove him wrong. Dean mouthed along with the soundtrack:
“Problem?” said Dean. Castiel said nothing, just looked. Under his regard, Dean suddenly remembered his dream, and a blush rose up so powerful he could feel it pouring down the back of his neck. “Well?”
“Here’s how we’ll begin,” said Crowley, and Dean stepped cautiously back onto the floor. This was Cas and Dean, mano a mano, but there was no music yet, just Crowley walking them through the steps, clapping the beat as they ran through a couple different sequences, the choreographer limiting himself to only terse comments in-between.
“Yeah, I thought so,” said Sam a bit shyly. “I’ll have my degree by the time rehearsal would start. I mean, if I get cast. A big if.”
, but he hadn’t done any of the more classical stuff since he’d been a kid taking lessons. Those hadn’t worked out well, and still stung him some.
In the meantime, Dean was feeling more relaxed and decided to wander around the building like the old days. Unsurprisingly he found his feet had pointed him toward the shop, though the days of Bobby’s reign were long gone. Garth was pretty cool, though. The guy was the definition quirky and had a demeanor so happy he’d driven Dean nuts as a teen, but he grew on you, and really knew his shit besides. Dean figured he wouldn’t mind a visit.
“I was, what, eleven? Twelve? And you were in that high school Romeo and Juliet. Your first leading role.”
He stood, almost on autopilot. Sam grabbed his arm. “You’ve got this, Dean.” He nodded and squared his shoulders, walking through the gauntlet of heavy stares from all the people he was competing against. As much as he wasn’t expecting anything to come of this, he could still feel that desire rise up in him again, to perform, to do better, be the best.
“Dean, I want to see you, Dean, Dean,” Cas groaned. Neither of them were able to look away from each other’s faces in the mirror, both of them flushed and sweaty, mouths bruised from kissing. Dean couldn’t believe how full Cas’s mouth was, christ, all fruit-ripe and spilling filthy things like he couldn’t stop himself. “I want you Dean, god, you’re so beautiful—” And despite the embarrassment that surged through him at the praise, it was the final spark before Dean exploded outward, gave a shout that fell into a moan as Cas worked him through it. “Yes, so good, Dean, so good, so good…”
Sam, Dean, and Victor were all in the half of the group shunted toward the wall, while the other six men stood in a line and waited as Kevin’s piano imitated the horn introduction. When they began to sing, Dean understood the genius of Naomi’s method: with six men it was easy to hear when one of them went off pitch, who was good at sight reading for those who weren’t familiar with the music, and for those who were familiar, there were some markings on the music that changed the notes, slightly, to see who was paying attention.
“‘Why Should I Wake Up?’ from Cabaret.” He took another slug of his beer and bit the inside of his cheek, waiting for Bobby to chew that over.
The biggest dance studio in Paradise was on the top floor. It was big enough to comfortably contain a full dance corps without being in danger of kicking each other. There was a decently springy marley floor and barres ran the full length of each wall, two of which were floor to ceiling mirrors. The side of the room along the outside of the building had windows from barre height up, looking out onto Lake Michigan. The wall adjacent to the hallway had observation windows, and today the curtains were drawn wide open.
“Because how could I know skill or talent? I don’t take my work seriously, right? Because I never had to claw and scratch my way up to this level. I should’ve just been born with a silver spoon up my ass into a family that practically owns the business. Should’ve just tapdanced out the womb like you, huh?”
Dean felt the rage crest in him like a wave. “I knew it,” he spat, twisting his shirt in his hands. He needed to get out of here. He stalked off to the changing room. “You coming?”
.” The assembly clapped, a few people whistled, and a couple wiseasses actually cat-called. Dean just thought it was absurd that he was announcing the show with such gravity, like he was about to start mass or something. A glance at his brother confirmed he felt the same and they quickly had to face back front before they started laughing. “In your folder you will find the schedules for rehearsals: dance rehearsals, voice rehearsals, group rehearsals, and individual as well. You will find timelines for being off book. I tell you now that tardiness will not be tolerated. Attending rehearsal unprepared will not be tolerated. Anything less than your best will not be tolerated. Is that understood?” The mood dropped so quickly you could practically feel the horror of a couple dozen people imagining their career die at a single bad word from a Milton, any Milton. The theatre got so quiet you could hear the buzzing of the stage lights.
They both groaned when they figured out how to slot together perfectly, their thin dance pants not hiding a thing, though adding friction enough to keep things interesting. But after a while it just wasn’t enough, became more frustrating than anything else. Cas was the first to snap, growling and pulling away from Dean only to again grasp his hips and jerk him around until he was facing the mirror. Dean reflexively put his hands up to stop the momentum, slapping the mirror with fingers splayed.  It shook under the force. “What the—”
. Maybe they’ll fuck, or maybe they’ll make love, or maybe they’ll get their fill of both. Maybe when they’re done they’ll kiss and it will mean: see you back at the theatre, I can’t wait, I can’t wait.
He didn’t catch more than a glance, though, because Cas jerked their hips together and nipped at Dean’s bottom lip, and Dean surrendered to his kiss. Maybe he was making a mistake but it felt so, so good, especially when their ferocity fell off into curiosity. The avid, quick learning they displayed when working, their careful study they turned onto each other, mapping out lips, teeth, and tongues, the softness and sweetness of each other’s mouths. It was so good Dean didn’t protest when Cas used his hips to maneuver him into taking steps backward, and he didn’t break off their kisses until he felt the barre press into his ass.
At those words they swung their feet into the chorus, circling each other, trading moves like a challenge, never breaking eye contact, and—
The next few minutes saw everyone else arrive, and after they were warmed up and stretched, and Sammy’s too-long hair was tied neatly into a tiny ponytail, Crowley began walking them through “Rum Tum Tugger.” Rehearsal was always a different beast from performing, a different kind of work than the thrill of being onstage. Dean was dancing in the spotlight for the first time in years, in the glaring fluorescent lights of the studio where Crowley would sometimes sneer at the slight bend of his legs, mirrors laying bare his form from several angles—yeah, rehearsal was different.
“No, Dean, listen to what I’m saying.” Cas turned away, running a hand through his thick hair, before starting again. “You’re different from all the people I’ve been surrounded by my whole life. And your talent…I couldn’t believe how few credits you had to your name when I saw you perform last fall.”
, it’s just that Aaron was the only one he’d ever taken the leap for—and that was probably only because he’d been high at the time—and Dean had liked it, just as much as with women though totally different—but Aaron had been a few inches shorter than Dean, his hands smaller than his, not really calloused at all, but Castiel’s hands—
Dean peeled Cas’s arms away from his body, and using the element of surprise he took his own turn to manhandle, swinging him around to press him to a clean part of the barre and tugging down his leggings before Cas could take a breath. Dean dropped to his knees and took his cock in hand. He gave it a slow, firm stroke from root to tip, examined it as he did. It looked fucking delicious, cut and with precome pearling at the tip. He licked the head, tasted it from the source. Cas gasped. Dean started running his lips down the length of him, leaving slopping kisses in his wake until he could bury himself in the coarse hair at its base. Between the sweat of their workout and their sex the scent was strong, but Dean breathed it in, nuzzling his balls, reaching with his other hand to cup them so he could suck them in his mouth one by one. Cas was groaning, nearly whimpering. One of his hands scrambled for sweaty purchase on the barre while the other wrapped round the back of Dean’s head, not pushing, but rhythmically squeezing along with his uneven breath. His hips twitched in little abortive thrusts. “Dean,” he moaned, somewhere between an order and a plea.
Dean breezed past the rest of the cast, beelining to his locker. He changed quickly as he could, shrugging on a new shirt and lacing up his boots in swift strokes. Sam moved a lot slower, chatting with their castmates and Dean sighed impatiently until he took the hint. When they were finally, finally ready to leave, Castiel walked in just as they were trying to walk out. Novak – inevitably – settled his big, judgy eyes on him, but Dean was ready and met them with a glare of his own. Castiel frowned, his face quickly darkening.
It was enough. Cas glowed even brighter, pressed the shadows to the edges of the room with his happiness, shared it with Dean in another quick kiss. It tasted spicy sweet. “Come on,” he said, stepping back though his hands trailed down Dean’s arms, reluctant to let him go. “Let’s practice so we can get out of here. And so we can go on our date.”
were Joe…When you played him, Dean…you made me change my mind. At that moment, all the subtle physical work you’d been doing throughout the previous hours of the show came to a head. Joe claims to find happiness wherever he can but he’s denied himself so many physical and emotional things. His temple garments are the armor he puts on to protect his sensitive soul, a shield against all the world. When your Joe stripped those garments away and stood naked in front of Louis it wasn’t the loud, brash gesture, but the quiet and vulnerable one. Taking off the symbol of his hollow faith and leaving nothing but the hope of raw humanity in its wake. A man standing before another that made him question himself down to his very foundations.” Castiel’s eyes bore into him, unblinking. “I’d never empathized with Joe before. You made an already brilliantly written role shine even brighter. A true actor.”
Once they were thoroughly stretched, Crowley was true to his word. They spent the next couple of hours going through prompts and exercises to discover the physicality of their characters. There was always some difficulty in taking iconic roles and making them your own, especially so when audiences come in with their own preconceived notions. The chorus members had it a little easier, if they could separate themselves from any productions they’d seen and their vocals from what they were used to hearing on their recording of choice. Movement was a good way to do it; asking yourself simple questions such as
Castiel squinted. Then, voice rich and unwavering as if pronouncing something from on high, he said, “I don’t understand you, Dean Winchester.”
Very much despite himself, Dean was intrigued. Sam and Dean both had a tangential history with the company, Paradise having not only been Bobby’s former employer, but their mother Mary had performed there a few times as well. It was the oldest and most respected theatre company in a city that thrived on the craft; it had been founded by the Milton family and was still their official base.
When he didn’t bring them along, the brothers learned to be quiet, so so quiet, while their mother was at rehearsal or working. She couldn’t have them in the rehearsal space, and Missouri in the apartment next door couldn’t always babysit, so she got clever. She’d time her entrance so she could sneak them into buildings without anyone noticing, and they learned to hide, and watch. They made friends of the catwalks and dusty corners and haunted hallways and all the parts of theatres superstitious actors and crew willfully ignored to protect themselves from ghosts and curses. But once she started working at Paradise Bobby caught them, eventually, and once he’d figured out what was going on, let them stay in the shop where he could keep an eye on them. That’s when they began their real theatre education, though they hadn’t known it; they learned to build, and design, and sew.
“Well, absence does make the heart grow fonder, doesn’t it?” The reproach was honest, but there was a hint of a smile about her red lips. She never was the type to hold grudges. Too practical. It didn’t stop Dean from feeling guilty, though.
But Dean couldn’t help but be drawn back to the dance itself, as idiotic and misguided as the proverbial moth to the flame. The brother and sister, both dark-haired, were so alike in appearance as well as in movement, and the effect they had together was beyond compare; they gave the illusion of floating, flying, all effortless— though Dean knew exactly how much work and sweat went into it from hard experience.
When Dean got to the dance studio, he found he was the last to arrive. At least he was dressed more appropriately today, in a white tank and black dance pants. He gave Castiel a stiff nod in greeting, which was duly returned, and shook hands with Joshua, who was already settled in on a chair, content to watch until his character’s reentrance at the end of the piece. “How are you this evening, sir?” Dean asked. Joshua got the honorific because the veteran actor actually deserved his respect.
Dean was torn so quickly out of the zone he nearly stumbled. Castiel looked just as dazed, blinking rapidly. Crowley straightened his jacket and picked up his notes, gathering them and tossing them into his briefcase before snapping it shut. “Now that you have the template I’ve created memorized,” he said, “you can make up for wasting my time, and Mr. Gardner’s.” With wide eyes Dean and Cas both turned to look at Joshua, still sitting on the other side of the room, a neutrally pleasant expression carefully arranged on his face. When they looked back at Crowley he gave them a cold smile. “I don’t know what macho, aggressive beef there is between you two, but you’d better resolve this little catfight or the dance is never going to work. So, if you do care about keeping your roles, you both can stay here and rehearse until you figure it out and DO YOUR JOBS.” The protest on Dean’s lips died at the outburst. Crowley was red in the face. “Are we clear? Good. I’ll be back after a leisurely dinner. I’m sorry you came out for no reason, Mr. Gardner. There’s no planning for incompetence.” And with one last glare at Dean and Cas, he stalked out of the studio.
Dean and Castiel exchanged no more words, even after Naomi dismissed them. Dean simply nodded his goodbye to the room at large, tossed his stuff into his bag, slung it over his shoulder, and strode out the door. Yeah, Dean would be able to get through this, no problem. He’d just have to ignore Mr. Pissed-offelees and he’d be fine.
Dean looked up into his deep frown, brows drawn down over his eyes, so clearly disgusted with Dean and his disappointing comportment, and his shitty, untrained singing and dancing but he had no choice, Dean snatched the pencil out of his hand and smiled.
“Sam’s Munkustrap and he’s gonna kill it, mom, I’m telling you. You should hear the pipes he has on him these days.”
“Shut up!” Sam hissed, elbowing him twice for good measure. Dean slapped him back, both of them fighting the giggles. A dude with a messy thatch of dark hair sitting a couple rows in front of them twitched at the noise.
“Ugh, shut your face, Sam. Rent? Really?” Pulling his keys out of his pocket, Dean opened the door and shoved Sam outside into the night ahead of him. He tried pushing thoughts of Ellie, inextricably linked with the show in Dean’s head, out along with him.
After Chuck said his piece, the crew dispersed to work and the cast trailed after Naomi to one of the music rooms. It reminded Dean a bit of high school choir, with risers in increasingly taller rows and panels along the walls and ceiling to better the sound. No chairs, though; Naomi clearly expected her singers to stand. She didn’t give the company any reason to need them anyway. As soon as everyone had arrived and arranged themselves on the risers – Sam and Dean drifting naturally to the back, used to being among the tallest in any given room – Naomi gave Kevin a signal, and warmups began. After this they jumped right into the prologue of the show, a five minute
He hummed the lyrics at first, then sang them under his breath. Habit won out though and he began to sing in earnest, putting the pauses and inflections where he remembered his mother doing so. He knew this song backwards and forwards, and even though his hands fumbled through things these days, on this song they never dropped a note. And while Dean was no Paul McCartney, his voice wrapped around the words like an old friend. It was comforting like that. Easy. No matter how many times he sang the song he always lost himself in it, so he was grateful to be alone; it made him too vulnerable to let anyone else see or hear him like this, though Sammy had heard it often enough it was okay if he walked in—which was exactly what he did, during the fourth iteration of the
. After Dean knew the record backwards and forwards, after he and Sam had tried out all the harmonies, before Sam had decided he wanted a dog for a pet instead, before dancing in unitards and cat makeup seemed stupid and childish. Still, though. He’d never quite been able to shake his fondness for it. It was Andrew Lloyd Webber after all, and maybe Dean had a weakness for his unabashedly dramatic music. Maybe. He grabbed his jacket off its hook and shrugged it on.
“So,” said Dean, trying to piece things together, “You don’t like me because I sound happy and you…aren’t?”
Before he could formulate a fittingly scathing response, a voice resonated from the darkness pressing in on the ghost light. “Castiel.” Steps sounded on the stairs leading from the floor up onto the stage, and Michael faded into the light. “May I speak with you before your rehearsal?”
When warmups were done everyone spread out in the middle of the room to stretch properly. Crowley flicked off the music and went to stand in front of one of the mirrored walls. He was dressed in a black suit (bespoke, if Dean’s years in Ezra’s shop had taught him anything) with a black-on-black embroidered waistcoat and a bloodred tie. “Listen up, minions.” He looked down his nose at them where they were sitting on the floor. “This isn’t going to be your classic Cats choreography. There will still be the contrast between modern and classic styles, yes, but you are not actually imitating cats. You will need to be aloof and predatory, cute or adorable at turns, but no scratching paws, or” – he sniffed – “personal grooming. You are not people trying to be animals, but animals discovering their humanity. I know some of you empty vessels don’t know what it’s like to be human, but let’s try, shall we?” Everyone nodded, as if anyone wouldn’t. “Today we’ll be working on movement as a group, but soon every single one of you will be doing individual character work. Which means,” and here Crowley paused, making sure he was getting paid all due attention, “that some choreography may change. Sometimes to fit what your character has become, and sometimes because I said so. Are we clear?” More nodding, though Gabe rolled his eyes so hard his head moved and Rowena made a big show of yawning. Crowley glared at her. “Good chat. You’ve got ten more minutes.”
“First of all, Dean Winchester,” Mary said, “Chuck Shurley would not let you within a mile of that stage if he didn’t think you were more than capable. And Sam’s career will be based on his own work, so don’t you worry about him. And Dean, are you listening?”
. Instead of going biblical, the production was designed to resemble medieval and renaissance Christian aesthetics, so familiar to the Western eye. The set gave the illusion of the audience being in the pews of a giant cathedral, so that when Jesus was dying on the cross it seemed as if he were in place above the altar, just like a crucifix in a real church. There were columns lining either side with chapels between them; any given moment an actor could stand in a spot and look like a saintly statue one might pray to, or pageant fools acting out the stations of the cross. He’d had to build facsimiles of stained glass windows and paint wood to look like marble and make it seem so grand not even the Pope could turn his nose up at it. Even before the lighting it had been gorgeous. Dean remembered it so well because it had been Mary’s first production at Paradise. She’d played Mary Magdalene, of course.
They let the back and forth carry them into the room. Kevin was by the piano with the assistant that had checked them in the first day, sorting through music. Bartholomew, Michael, and Naomi were all there, standing in a circle and talking with a short man in a well-tailored dark suit who, judging by his voice, could only be Crowley. No Chuck, then. Of the actors there were about a dozen all told. But with his brother and his friend on either side of him, Dean’s apprehension felt far away and something in his shoulders loosened. It wouldn’t be hard playing along and putting on a good face to reflect well on Sam (he wasn’t naïve enough to think that as brothers, sometimes how people perceived one of them colored how they saw the other). That’s what he was really here for.
Crowley pressed a button on the stereo. The song’s intro filtered through the speakers, a slight circus vibe to it, and Gabe and Bela crept and pranced across the floor while Castiel looked on, aware of their presence, but aloof—Dean thought he hardly had to act. As soon as the lyrics started (the singing was on the recording, so Castiel mouthed along), the two criminal cats noticed the third in their midst, but only smiled, as if all three of them were in on some great joke and they had no fear of his judgment. And though they remained separate from him, Castiel twined himself between them, almost in greeting, and as the story continued and
“Thanks, Ezra. I won’t.” He didn’t give her more than a fleeting smile, though. Castiel’s presence filled the room like the weight of judgment and he wanted nothing more than to put his clothes back on, find Sam, and get out of there. Though his clothes were on the couch, of course they were, and Dean tried to avert his eyes from where Castiel was bending over to put on his own costume. He edged around him, turned away as he slipped on his pants and his shirt, then grabbed his shoes without bothering to put them on. Before he left the room he couldn’t help but take one last look over his shoulder, and…realized he shouldn’t have been worried. Castiel had his back to Dean, now, adjusting the neckline of his unitard and already talking about it with Ezra. What made him think that Castiel cared about his presence at all? Dean didn’t matter, in the scheme of things, and a Milton legacy had more important business to occupy himself with. Once he’d known Dean wasn’t trespassing – like, what, a creepy flasher in the basement? – he’d ceased caring, and hadn’t even bothered looking at Dean in the meantime.
It figured. He might not swan around the place being obnoxious like his cousins, but all Family members ever looked for was
Dean had tried to be professional. For two weeks he kept performing but he was hurt, and confused about whether or not to follow her, and every night loving and watching Mimi self-destruct tore him apart. So he took a leaf out of Roger’s book and ran away, breaking his own contract. His mom had kept acting all through her divorce but he just couldn’t understand how she’d done it, how she still did it. He’d hopped into Baby, leaving Sam to the tender mercies of the El, and halfheartedly searched for Ellie. But she’d never told him how to find her, and mostly he slept in the crappy motels of his youth and drank at the same sorts of bars his dad used to favor. Only guilt over Sam and a terse voicemail from Bobby, telling him he was retired and opening his own place and he’d better see Dean there bright and early Monday morning brought him back to the city, tail between his legs.
Until, that is, they reached the second verse. Not all the cats were supposed to be having fun; Tugger’s contradictory nature still had a bit of a polarizing effect. And of course, one of the few cats that were immune to his charm was Mr. Mistoffelees himself. There’s a brief rest before the verse begins, and Dean and Castiel ended up posed next to each other. Dean leaned an elbow on one of the boxes, still set up from the previous rehearsal, and Castiel pressed his back on another stack, standing all insouciant-like. In the beat of silence their eyes met, and Dean felt himself falter. Castiel wasn’t just wearing an unimpressed look, no, it was downright derisive, boring into him hard enough to burn. And as the recorded voice filtered in,
. It’d been a year since Dean had seen the show, but he knew exactly what he was looking at: Eros, blindfolded, kneeling with his white wings arching high above his back, reflected in the glittering water of the pool that had taken up the bulk of the stage. Dean remembered the actor, too, had made it a point to know his name because his performance had moved him so much. Castiel Novak, another scion of The Family. Too bad he was likely as much of a prick as the rest of them.
were insults that were dropped a hell of a lot in middle school, where everyone was trying everyone else on for size. His parents’ marriage deteriorated more and more, and John was finding less and less reason to accept Mary’s explanations of how they would grow up strong and tall and self-assured. He wondered, loudly and often, why he should let his sons grow up sissies. And the instructors, well. They weren’t as nice to you once you were no longer a cute little kid just learning how to tondue. As Dean stared at Hannah, and particularly Castiel, and his long, straight, well-muscled legs, he could almost hear the little sighs Ms. Visyak made when trying to adjust Dean’s form, could just about feel the self-disgust he felt each and every time her eyes raked down one of his bowlegs, saying “Turn your leg” or “Straighten up” all the while knowing nothing would change, and not bothering to hide it from him.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean said, tucking his pencil behind his ear and rolling up his draft. It was clear he’d be getting no more work done tonight. “Not that I’m not happy to see you, but why are you here?”
