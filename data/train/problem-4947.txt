Castiel muttered in Enochian as he withdrew his hand. He vaguely heard Sam give out a small snort, but he was already angrily walking away.
but, “Uh… Cas,” Majestic black wings flapped into existence, and yeah, both his eyes were definitely wide open now. ‘
“We should probably tell him…” Cas said doubtfully. Dean could’ve snorted. Looks like he finally wasn’t the only one who knew how bad Sam was at actually acting out on his crushes.
Dean swallowed again, feeling ashamed – no, bashful, he wouldn’t be ashamed, but he could be – he could be embarrassed, his own flesh was making a fool of himself – but he wasn’t a fool, a-a clown, or anything else he hadn’t heard directed at his face, but he knew was said, when they thought he couldn’t hear, when they felt he wouldn’t retaliate because Dean may have looked
Dean smiled. “You’re not limited to just seeing,you know.”
“You look… exquisite, Dean. Whether or not my hand was of any help.”
strong — just something to get my boyfriend geared up, if you know what I mean.”
There was a hesitant knock on his door.
“Stay still, please,” it was an order, Cas commanding as gently as a battle hardened warrior could do, before he began applying the eyeliner, and Dean only just reminded himself to freeze – who was he kidding, there was no conscious thought to freezing, his body taking over and closing his eyes but also emanating
Inviting himself inside, Castiel sat cross-legged on the right side of Dean’s bed, facing him. When the mattress dipped and was jostled under Castiel as he climbed onto it, he thought Dean would wake up. But hours seemed to go by, Castiel tracing the contours of Dean’s face with his eyes and losing track of time as he took in the tired slump of Dean’s features even when in a fitful sleep, the flush of his fever leaving his cheeks a bright pink, sweat beading at Dean’s forehead. So entranced with making patterns of the constellations of the freckles on Dean’s face, he didn’t notice when Dean opened his left eye to peek at Castiel. “I thought you were over the sleep creepin’ thing. You been there all night?”
He pulled the door open.
Didn’t have to, when Misha closed the scant distance between them, pressing their lips together in a soft kiss. Closing his eyes again, Jensen gave himself over to the feel and sensation of the kiss, of Misha holding him, the warmth of his lover’s body against his. They’d barely broken apart before Jensen was swooping back in to capture Misha’s lips again, unwilling to let them part so soon. The memories of Cas’s words, hitting so close, so true about someone Jensen genuinely considered a part of himself… it was all still far too fresh, and he knew it would continue to do so for days to come, at least.
At some points, the tears he’d supposed to keep from falling had let loose. Thinking of the reason why he’d been forced to shed them in the first place took all of his control to prevent another fresh wave from cascading down his cheeks.
“I can hear your teeth chattering from down the hall.” See? Definitely just the fever. Flu. Who the hell cared at this point? “It is
“I have my own private island.” Cas said, so matter-of-factly, as if he hadn’t just dropped a life-changing revelation on Dean. “I can have it thoroughly sanitized by the time we arrive, if it’ll help appease your concerns.”
“Dean, are you really sure you wanna–”
Swallowing, he twisted open the bottle and meticulously began applying the contents on his nails. Soon, he was pleased to discover that it wasn’t as hard as he thought it would be. Around two decades since he’d gotten to do this, and he thought he’d have gotten rusty…
And with that, Castiel left.
Sam stood, absently noticing the coffee Cas had brought but hadn’t had a single sip from was no longer steaming.
Slowly, a small smile crept onto Cas’s lips. “Yes, I think so.”
Thoughts of the club in Florida kept his mind entertained until the polish dried, and then he was soon afterwards dismayed to realize that he had, in fact, gotten rusty, but more upsetting was the fact that this was at something he used to consider himself a pro at, once upon a time.
with his nose tucked between Dean’s shoulder blades, and – oh, yeah – wings securely around Dean. With the abrupt realization practically slamming into him, Dean gasped.
“Yes, Dean. Him.”
“Don’t worry.” Cas sounded far more calmer in comparison. He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder before receding, drawing his wings back “Your fever has broken.” Cas got up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. His voice cracked with uncertainty as he went on. “I…I apologize for the intrusion.” When Dean, unsettled, peeked over his shoulder, he saw Cas looking down, his shoulders slumped as his wings faded from view. Dean blinked, wide-eyed, trying to process the sight of Cas’s wings completely disappearing, except for a few stray feathers pulled free and was now slowly drifting down. With his wings gone, Cas began to put his shirt back on.
“Yes,” Dean let out a drawn out whine as Cas slowly but surely pushed into him. His hands were back onto his hips, holding on as he thrust in. There were bound to be bruises later, and Dean relished in the thought of it.
Sam couldn’t help but think.
Eyebrows drawn, Cas nodded. “You were hit by a car my f–”
“Obviously,” Sam said, almost smirking. It wouldn’t be Dean if he wasn’t difficult, and
“He was always tipsy at the least. We – my siblings and I – we knew, sooner or later something would go wrong.”
jerk.”
Pushing himself up to his knees, Dean hunched over Cas’s back. “Cas, wait,” he hooked his chin over Cas’s shoulder and placed his hand on Cas’s other shoulder, his right hand holding Dean up on the bed. “I, uh…” he began hesitantly, before forcing himself to push on. Even as he kept his eyes closed, way too flustered to look at Cas for this, he was still smiling. “Y’know, actually I think I’m still cold.” One last feather lingered in the air as Cas’s muscles relaxed under Dean. He brought his hand up to grab onto Dean’s wrist over his shoulder, not pulling, but just holding. Cas smiled back as he peered at Dean.
“And you accepted that?” That came from Sam, who sounded as bewildered as Cas looked.
“No, Sam. I’m secretly having an affair and refer to my booty call with endearments on a regular basis.” Cas tossed him a look of equal parts amusement and exasperation as he disappeared around a corner, presumably to the bathroom to wash up. He better have been heading to the bathroom. Dean was pretty sure his boyfriend missed a spot of blood on his forearm.
“Dean, I can
Dean stared blankly. “You’re joking.” At Cas’s continued staring, turning more unimpressed by the second, he backtracked. “You’re… not joking?” He let out a disbelieving laugh when Cas only continued to stare evenly. “Jesus,” shaking his head, he rubbed a hand over his face. “Fuck it. You know what? Fine. I’m gonna go stir crazy if I have to stay cooped up any longer anyway.”
– was definitely getting to his head because his brain was glitching, and Dean was at a complete loss for words, only able to cowardly pull the blankets up to his chin.
Sam would have a reason to be really worried.
He looked up in time to see Cas’s face breaking out into a blindening grin.
Trust the one phrase he’d thought to himself decades ago to do the trick.
Dean let the phone drop again. “Yeah, that guy.”
Sam could easily see that for himself. His brother was beginning to flush from what was most likely a fever. And still, Dean slurred out a protest. “M’not sick. M’ just tired.”
, and he was still being selfish.” Cas suddenly slumped in his chair, dragging a hand over his tired face. “I– I am
Cas’ mouth worked wordlessly for a few seconds before he finally got his voice to work again. “Setting aside the impossibility of that statement for now, that’s still six years of your life wasted,” Cas retorted. "And as grateful as I am to have been able to see you, that doesn't negate the causes behind the situation when I should've been able to see you as much as anyone else – alive and breathing. Like you are now."
“Hey!” He protested, but then had to bite back another moan as Cas brought his hand down again before plastering himself to Dean’s back.
“Two days,” Sam said. And yeah, that sounded about right, matching with the bags under their eyes and the general weariness they seemed to radiate. Dean got to sleep even though he’d been dead and then revived, but when was the last time these actual, alive human beings got some sleep?
“Cas?” He questioned, wondering what the angel was doing outside, even as he cursed himself for forgetting–
“The hell are you doing, Cas? I told you I–” Cas pulled off his shirt, revealing well defined abs and, oh, yeah, Cas had a friggin’
on my brother. Dean feels responsible for me; for you…”
him, for heaven’s sake. It really shouldn’t have come as a surprise when Dean surfaced enough to protest rather vehemently for having only seconds prior puked majority of the contents of his stomach out.
“This is my father you’re talking about, Dean,” Cas stated tiredly. “Honestly, half the time I wasn’t even sure he was sane of mind. As much as the average person is, anyway. Our relationship,” he went on, before Dean could say anything. “Was dysfunctional at best.”
“Dammit,” he hissed, wiping away the smudges of the eyeliner. Tears clouded his vision with frustration when he realized that he’d have to redo the eyeshadow again, and he let the eyeliner clatter to the sink as he dropped it, clutching porcelain edges as he fought to control himself. After hours of silence, his muttered curse and the plastic bottle still rolling around in the basin had shattered the silence, continuing to stubbornly echo loudly in his room.
To Cas’s credit, he didn’t flinch, or outwardly react in any negative way otherwise. What he did do was pause, and tilt his head, squinting as he regarded Dean’s face. “Your lines are uneven,” he finally announced.
Over the commotion of people coming over and stubbornly remaining happy to congratulate Misha on his final scene, Misha looked up and caught Jensen’s eyes over them all.
“Uh, yeah, about that. I’m not actually sure I know what happened on your side, but all
Dean was pretty sure he was malfunctioning. The flu – fever,
His brother had yelled, and though it was meant to be light-hearted, Dean had felt sufficiently guilt-tripped into being more attentive of his little brother.
Dean snorted. Talking about his brother’s secretary who had a crush on him – entirely unrequited, except for when they were blowing off steam. Honestly, Dean wasn’t sure how it worked, except apparently, Sam “
“Hey,” Misha’s voice was soft, cautious but open, and Jensen raised his head from where he’d let it drop, peering at Misha through foggy eyes.
His mind was, (not?) for the first time tonight, choosing to be unhelpful by fixating on the one thing he was trying hard not to think about; with the stilettos on, he was several inches taller, even more taller than Cas, and the way Cas had to tilt his head back to meet Dean’s eyes made him think of other circumstances where Cas would have to look up at him, one where they’d be closer instead, Dean’s arms around Cas’s neck as he straddled–
“Gladly.” Cas descended into a flurry of movements as he rapidly stripped them, almost leaving Dean dizzy with how fast he moved. All too soon, he found himself naked and trying to find balance on the slippery floor. Before he could, he was being whirled around, Cas’s grip on his hips tight and possessive as he made Dean face the wall. Easily getting with the program, Dean placed his hands on the tiled wall, unconsciously pushing his ass out. He heard Cas let out an almost pained groan, and he grinned, right before a bare hand came down on his ass cheek,
“Hell, probably even for the baristas at the fancy coffee shop he thinks we don’t know he goes to.” He swiftly changed.
“What was that?” Cas asked, sounding unfairly smug and not as affected as Dean.
“...Better?” Cas asked. Gone was the deep, gravelly commands, replaced by a softness that only threatened to lull Dean further into sleep.
“Damn, really? I thought he was all, ‘gung-ho, ain’t no stupid ass virus acting like it’s the damn apocalypse stopping me from doing my work?’”
When Cas strode back into his room, there was a sort of purposeful determination in his stance, and the sleeves he’d long since pushed up only emphasized the unwavering way he was walking towards Dean now. Confused, Dean warily eyed Cas as he loosened his tie and began to unbutton his shirt, and holy hell what was he doing? His thoughts were only further derailed when Cas’s eyes began to glow blue with grace. The powerful sight wasn’t enough to get Dean to open both his eyes, though, not when he felt like
From the other end, Sam let out a long-suffering sigh. “Jesus, okay. Fine. Tell Cas thanks.”
“I could help you with that?” Cas offered. “As an angel, my hands don’t shake unnecessarily…” he trailed off, as if it only just occurred to him that straight lines weren’t exactly straight when they were on someone’s eyelids, but apart from raising his eyebrows, Dean mentally shrugged, and held the bottle of eyeliner to Cas.
All too aware he was distracting himself with his internal rambling, Dean studiously kept it up as he took the packaged items out of the bag.
Jensen swallowed, trying to shake the remnants of a character bleed away before it could truly sink its talons in him. Still, feeling unsteady, he rose to his feet.
Dean was twenty years past denying the little things, and every year he’d learned to accept increasingly bigger things. This year, he was looking at the biggest of all wins, and after everything, how was he still expected to say no?
Cas only smirked before biting at his ear. “
“Uhuh,” sure he did. “Point is, in his infuriatingly backwards way, Dean’s probably being a dick because he cares. He’d rather suffer a bit if it means you’ll be better off.” He explained.
“And…
“…Shuddup.”
He forced himself to focus on Cas’s words. “What’re you talking about?”
know is that one moment I’m talking with another ghost, the next second, that ghost was in me? And then I think I blacked out… had a recap of my entire life’s events, car crash included, and then I’m waking up in your room. Which I would like an explanation for, by the way.” Dean stretched out his arms, staring at them with the awe he’d been mostly suppressing until now. “I mean, dude. I have my body back! Is my grave empty now, or have I been rehymenated?”
Dean paused from where he’d been about to deliver a well-aimed swat at Cas’s ass. Heh. Cas’s ass.
Dean blinked. “Uh, Cas, buddy? The whole world’s dealing with the coronavirus. Ain’t like there’s any place we could go without being able to worry about it.”
“C-Cas, please,” he begged.
A hand clamped onto his shoulder. “Goodbye, Dean.” The final words rang like an executioner’s bell in his head, before he was being forcefully pushed to the side. With a grunt, he rolled over, horrified as he righted himself enough to look–
“He was drunk as a sailor when he did?” Sam asked, eyebrows raised. Castiel shrugged, staring at the table as he traced unseen patterns onto it.
Just… not yet.
” with how he was acting.
“Your father was the other driver.”
“That was the end,” Jensen whispered, eyes fluttering closed as Misha brought his hands up to cup Jensen’s face. “The damned end, Mish. All these years, and I get it, I do… but they–you deserved to have stuck with us to the end, man.”
“Toxic.”
Either way, the close proximity was a familiar warmth, one he’d eagerly sucked in even as he tried to ignore how he wouldn’t get this again, not like he’d gotten to–
“Let’s go on a vacation.”
“C-Cas?” He felt his cheeks heating up, but something told him it wasn’t because of whatever sickness ailed him the night before.
Dean groaned, pulling Cas by the back of his hair to let their lips connect again. “Try.” He dared, and it was enough for Cas to hoist Dean up to wrap his legs around Cas’s waist, and holding on tight, Cas led them further into the apartment.
And, oh, come on. Cas had to know that Dean would fight as hard as he could if only to jibe back at Cas, it was a game they played on purpose after all. And Dean wasn’t that far enough yet, to have been completely rendered speechless, or brainless. But hell if he had no complaints with Cas getting him there. “I don’t know, buddy. You see me trembling?” He managed to get out. “Personally, I think I’ve got you wrapped around my finger, Mr. Scary Mob Boss–
“I’m sorry, did you say
“Oh, fuck him – How the hell are you supposed to manage that?”
Jensen’s breath caught in his throat, at the words. “I know. God, Mish, I know.” Swallowing, his fingers flexed.
Misha tilted Jensen’s head up, making him meet Misha’s eyes. “It’s okay,” he repeated. “We knew this was coming, didn’t we?” He didn’t let Jensen look away again, no matter how much he wanted to. “It was a long time coming. Cas and Dean – they deserved this. Cas telling how he felt, Dean hearing it…” he gently frowned. “But we’re still here, Jensen. This may be the end of one story, a legacy… but we still have each other.”
“I didn’t care enough about the other driver,” Sam cut in, looking grim. “I thought if he was dead, or worse, than he had it coming. And if not, I didn’t wanna know that whoever killed my brother was out there walking, free and unharmed. So I didn’t care to find out.”
Dean’s mind was his own when he thought of how else Cas’s hand could be of actual help, but his body went one step ahead without permission and turned around.
“We tried looking for you,” Cas said, voice quiet. “In the hospital, at the office. Finally, we each went home, and then Sam was calling me–”
“You should go,” he said, keeping his voice low. “You just need to finish the one scene, and then we can leave.” Slowly, he pulled back, disentangling himself from Jensen. Hating them both for it, Jensen let him go, mournfully watching Misha take a step back, and then another. Misha smiled at him anyway, even as he stepped back one last time, giving Jensen enough space to leave, too much space away from Misha.
Cas stared. And stared some more. And then broke the awkward silence that had descended upon them by letting out a sharp bark of laughter. It sounded unnaturally harsh in the otherwise silence. “You’re joking.” He said. “My father never apologizes, not when it actually matters.”
Dean immediately grimaced. “Ugh, please,” he winked at her. “Just call me Dean.” He took that moment to place his empty cocktail glass on the wooden bartop. “And could I get another one of this? And also something stronger – but not
Cas rolls his eyes, “As if that has stopped you before.”
Sam doesn’t catch up before Dean slams the door, trying to keep whatever is on the other side out, but Sam sees the face of Lucifer before it closes completely.
Dean doesn't talk about his feelings.
“Where’s Cas?”
Without a plan, they head back to the bunker. Sam watches with worry as Dean grabs a bottle of rum and takes a long swig from it before falling into his worn chair at the table.
Dean can feel his face heating up, but Cas is never cruel, so he just quietly shuts the door and crawls into bed with Dean.
"Sammy, if you want me to help you, I'm gonna need you to not do this." Dean raises a hand in front of himself as if to ward him off. Sam notices it’s shaking. Dean’s tone brokers no argument, but if there’s one thing Sam’s good at, it’s arguing.
Sam hurriedly pulls sandwiches together and turns to Dean and Cas, who may as well be sitting in each other’s laps with how close they are.
When Cas finally finds Dean at the end of a long day, he nods that it’s finally time to go home. Dean instantly reaches for Cas’s hand, and after a flash of light they’re in the Bunker’s map room.
Dean puts his head in his hands and begins to sob. His body is shaking, and Dean let’s the anguish he’s feeling rise to the surface. It feels as though he’d just gotten Cas back, and even though things were rocky, they could have fixed it. Dean could have fixed it.
His heart shatters once more, his breath freezes in his chest.
Dean rushes towards the end of the hall and pushes a door open, he ignores the stares of what must be hundreds of angels, not particularly caring that there used to be only three. He’s too busy searching for a pair of blue eyes and dark hair.
“What are we talking about?” He finally asks.
Cas still has a claim on his soul, Dean thinks absently, pulling himself to his feet and trying not to immediately fall down again at the unbearable weight of loss that he feels. Dean could die and come back a hundred times and Cas would still have a claim on his soul. There is no one else who has ever come close to understanding Dean the way Cas does. Did.
He gripped the phone tighter, going through his options. But she’d asked for honesty only a few hours ago, and he owed her that much at least. “Yeah…” he breathed. “Yeah, something did.”
Dean flushed when he realized that Cas was trying to get away—snatching his hand back like it had been burned. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
Cas considered stopping there, but Dean didn’t say anything. In fact, the actor continued not saying anything for several minutes, and, in that pause, the author realized just how much more he had to add—how many points his restless brain had come up with during the last week of tossing and turning.
Want to talk to someone about SPN?
Bobby snorts, shifting his weapon to rest against his other shoulder but doesn’t answer.
Of course, it was busy outside too—with groups of people getting in and out of their cars and some smokers lingering by the entrance.
Cas made sure to keep his face as neutral as possible, even as he felt his heart speed up pleasantly. “Well, I
And Cas wouldn’t have it—Dean—any other way.
“Yeah, I got that part. Why’d you do it?”
Sam’s face twitches briefly. “Anyway, The Bunker is home base—slash a rehabilitation center. Some people just live there, but others—they want to get back into the world; they just don’t know how. We can forge new documents, perform tattoo removal for those with Facility markings. We hope it’s enough to keep them off the government’s radar.”
“Whatever you sent me basically.”
He begins pacing, winding up to something big, and I let him, sending off a quick prayer to Cas to not—I repeat,
“They’re in 14 and 15. Plus, I gave them the basic tour.”
him…!”
“That
Dean capped the pot with a lid, looking over at Castiel with one eyebrow raised, clearly waiting for him to continue. The author rolled his eyes. “Long story short, I realized that I wasn’t nearly the genius I thought I was. My grades started slipping—and the more I messed up, the more I felt I had to prove, which only resulted in me stressing myself out enough I screwed up more.
“I—” Dean takes a deep breath and puts on a pseudo-confident grin. “—was gonna do a Star Wars movie marathon and I wondered if you wanted to join me?”
By the time that they had bullied him into agreeing, Charlie had already halfway changed the topic to ComicCon, where Dean was a regular guest and, therefore, had seen some crazy shit go down. Of course, Lisa, Sam, Charlie, and Dorothy all had their own anecdotes that they threw in until the whole table was laughing.
“The package delivery was paid for using Castiel Novak’s credit card and picked up from the drop-off location at his martial arts studio,” Charlie declares, which doesn’t sound like good news but…
Before I can even blink, the angel has closed the distance between them. His posture is relaxed and loose—a dangerous sign for anyone who knows Cas. But it’s clear this guy has no real idea who he’s messing with. “The blonde woman you drove yesterday. What was her name?”
With that, he ends the call, smile fading as he turns pointedly to Meg.
So, he cleaned. He did Sudoku. He tried reading and immediately put the book back down again because it reminded him too much that he should be writing. He looked up adoptable kittens on the internet. And, in spite of his better judgment—in spite of it being the
“Oh my God—er—uh—I didn’t mean to—sorry. It’s an honor, really, I—I’ve heard a lot about you,” Sam babbles, stepping forward and holding out his hand to shake. Castiel looks at the hand, then back at Sam’s face—curiosity appearing again, but a more subdued color this time—until he eventually realizes what he is being asked to do and moves his arm up and down mechanically.
Dean.” His voice wavers. “It was really hard trying to figure out which version of me was real.”
“Here’s all I got on Tyson Brady,” the computer tech says from the other end of the line. “Originally born Tyson Zazael, his mother went back to her maiden name when he was two and changed his at the same time. There’s not really much information from when he was a minor, but he presumably got good grades because he got into Stanford where…oh….”
“I appreciate the offer,” Castiel told the producer. “But today’s been very—eventful—for me and I think I’d rather just go home now.”
“Come on, Charlie, we’re not that bad—” Dean protested. Although, he’d have an easier time believing himself if the laptop wasn’t still flashing a slideshow of their pictures—Dean holding a door of the Impala open for Cas; them eating sandwiches on her hood; standing on either side of Baby, talking, while Dean pumped gas….

Sam unrolled his shoulders. “So… we’ll find a way to stop him.”
usually how things—” he made a vague gesture between the two of them “…work. Unless… you’re having second thoughts or something?”
The obvious question would be to ask him what he did, but wouldn’t that be rude considering how Castiel had just evaded the same question? Mick apparently didn’t think so because he continued without prompting. “I work for a hotel chain in the EU that’s expanding its operations overseas. I’m scouting out potential locations, vendors, staff... It’s all terribly exciting stuff,” he said, with a light chuckle.
? Shouldn’t Dean have felt—a connection or something? Shouldn’t his wrist—or his heart—or hell, even his dick—have felt all tingly? Really—What. The.
“What the hell are people saying about me?” Meg demands and Castiel instantly regrets bringing it up.
“Uh, no?” Dean responds.
From his perspective, probably—but she only manages a smile when he laughs. He wouldn’t believe her if she told him what was really out there. After all, she hadn’t.
There’s a flash of grace in his eyes, a swirl of mist inside the crystal, and suddenly, we are not in Kansas anymore.
“I—It must be difficult for you,” the author finally responded, “—to sever such a long-term relationship.”
For a minute, they just listened to the voice of dozens of insects.
doing that.”
“I don’t want to interfere…” Castiel tried again, but Sam just waved him off.

get laid instead.
“How ‘bout Little Sammy?” Dean suggested, around an open-mouthed bite of sausage. “Since you’re not letting him be a player in anything else.”
Apparently, Dean couldn’t take the teasing anymore either. He reached out to help haul Cas forward that much quicker. And then, they were kissing again—deep and hungry—Cas digging fingers into Dean’s hair to help the actor keep his head upright, while simultaneously helping control the angle of his mouth—Dean snaking a hand between them to keep their cocks slotted together—and—

"The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling shined on his familiar freckles." - Ben's room had glow-in-the-dark stars as seen in "Exile on Main St." (6x1) (I think. I'm pretty sure, but I don't feel like searching through the episode to double-check).
“Hey, Cas,” he’d greeted, walking over to the sink to refill his water bottle, and proceeded to chug down the contents a little too quickly. Some of the water missed his mouth, trickling down to his already sweat-soaked tank top. Flushing with slight embarrassment, he was surprised to find the angel idly following the trail of a few of the droplets as they traveled over his collar bone to the neck of his shirt.
“Seems he was questioned in the death of a fellow college student by the name of Jessica Moore. Just as a witness but--”
I'm sorry. I know I sort of disappeared off the face of the Earth for a while there. Nothing's wrong. I've just been really busy and then when I don't write for a bit, I convince myself I suck at it, which further impedes the writing process. Hope you like this installment anyway.
“Oh,” Castiel stated, a sudden restlessness running through him. He abruptly turned around and headed back to his bedroom. “You didn’t need to do that.”
“I was just about to pick up an order for pizza,” Sam announces. When he sees Dean open his mouth, he cuts him off, “Yes, I got you a meat lovers. And cheese knots. And wings.”
Dean doesn’t want that either—and once again, the thought refuses to stay in his head, but comes naturally to his lips. “I—need a breather, yes—but I promise I’m not bailing. Just give me a few minutes of human time, OK?” Dean requests.
in the most literal way possible. And just the thought of that makes me so queasy I want to take my offer back. But I can’t send Other Dean back to 2008 resenting Cas the way he did today.
“Is this really what you two nerds talk about when I’m gone?” Dean scoffs, sliding back into his seat—and if his stool winds up a few inches closer to Cas’s then it was before, it’s not worth mentioning.
“Actually, that wasn’t what I wanted to talk to you about…” Sam looks…nervous? Like he’s suddenly reverted back into a twelve-year-old inside his 6’ 4’’ body.
“M’fine,” Dean muttered back, straightening.
Dean shifts slightly in his seat. “Quit that,” he eventually snaps. Castiel doesn’t think he’s talking about the staring.
Dean’s jaw tightens slightly with the need to defend the stranger—but Benny isn’t Jo—he doesn’t know the kind of trigger-hair temper he has when it comes to anything involving this particular psychopath. And, frankly, he doesn’t deserve to find out.

The look she gave him seemed to pat him on the head. “I’m sorry, Cas, but… I’ve been warned.”
leave after all. He just stalked my backyard like a creep.
Sam paces every word carefully. “
Cas smiled back, but it looked far too distracted for him to have been on the same wavelength as Dean was. “Anything else?” He pointedly prodded, and, oh. Right.
“Jeez, Cas, I’m not a baby bird,” he said, uncomfortable and marginally annoyed as Cas continued to make himself at home, but then he did, and, oh, that… actually felt good. Without being aware of it, Dean went slack as Cas’s wing settled comfortably around Dean, wrapping him up in a warm cocoon. “...Oh, damn that’s warm…” His eyes closed, a peaceful feeling in his chest curling the corners of his lips up without him noticing. He felt Cas gently brush away his hair from his forehead.
” What Dean (kinda) cared about was how Cas’s voice could possible go lower, until he was practically growling, and hang on a second now–
“Well, shit, feathers. Ain’t exactly like I can help it.” He said indignantly. “Now, what the fu–”
So he did the only thing he could do, even though really, he was as uncertain about the future as Cas was, and how even Sam was. His overgrown brother was undoubtedly agonizing over what was going on and what was going to happen as much as Cas was.
“So, yeah, it’s supposed to involve a lot of video calls, but personally, I have a feeling the prosecutor is gonna use that against the case. Hell, I probably will too.”
his battles, no matter how his body portrayed itself.
“How much longer do you think it’ll take your brother to realize Eileen can’t hear him?” Cas asked, voice pitched low and tone concerned.
“Uh,” Dean didn’t know where to look, those eyes, that was already concentrating, those plush lips, parted slightly and exhaling tiny puffs of air against Dean (he was an angel, did he really even need to breathe?), or those hands, raising to bring the eyeliner to Dean’s face?
“Actually, I do.” He lashed out. “You ain’t mojo-ing me and that’s that. Now you gonna let me sleep or what?” He snapped. They stared, Castiel feeling like they were rather at a stand off. He hated it, but he hated pushing Dean’s consent further, so he let his hand fall limp in Dean’s grasp.
“I neglect to say anything that might compromise your brother, Dean.”
Unfortunately, the distant sound of a bell reminded Jensen that he wasn’t done filming his scenes yet, and Misha was just as well aware of it.
“Uh,” Dean craned his head as he yelled out. “Hey, Cas, did you murder a guy and dump his corpse on Fourth Ave?”
“Dean?” Cautious and hesitant, the voice was quiet, as if unwilling to disturb the rest of the bunker’s occupants, while still being loud enough to pierce through the wooden door and reach through to Dean inside.
Mind at war, he quickly chose and cast away various arguments. The winners for both sides were shame, primarily, but it was still being defeated by the fact that this was Cas, and above everything, after everything, Dean knew Cas wouldn’t care.
Dean stared at the bag in his hand. It had been far too long, and he’d really only bought it on a whim. Neither meant he actually had to go through with his plan. Clearly, he’d just been thinking in the heat of the moment, passing by the shop on the street when he was alone, no one around to judge… Swallowing, he looked around himself, as if his surroundings might’ve changed in the past half hour he stood, scrutinizing the nondescript bag in his hands. But nope, still in his room in the bunker, the door was still comfortably closed and locked, and since everyone that needed to sleep had long since gone to bed, Dean was fairly certain that no disrupting moose would demand his presence anytime soon.
“Dean, just shut up and stay still.” They were in bed, Cas over him, and then out of the blue he found himself bodily manhandled until he was on his side, facing Cas, and – feathers flew around as they began to drape over Dean.
Sam winced, looking vaguely disgusted, but it was the sharp inhale from Cas that had him turning.
Still, he wasn’t going to cuddle Sammy to sleep, not with a very real body, no thanks.
was dry in comparison to
Sam snorted over the line. Whatever he said in response went unheard over the sound of the front door opening, and Dean pulled the phone away and pressed it to his shoulder. “Hey, babe!” He called out before Cas even came into view.
Dean smirked as he put the phone back to his ear, vaguely aware of the tap being turned back on. “He says no.”
“No shit, Sherlock,” Dean grumbled, but like he’d uttered some sort of secret password, Dean opened the door wider, allowing Cas in. “I thought I’d still have the hang of it, but apparently, my hands don’t remember how to make two straight lines anymore,” he grouched, going back to the sink to pluck the eyeliner again.
Dean gasped, hips bucking as his hole was stretched a little too quickly. Cas let his other hand fall free from Dean’s hip, and reached out. The shower starting up and cascading warm water on them was a jolt to Dean’s system, and he yelped, only to cut off in a high pitched keen that felt like it came from his chest as Cas focused on his prostate.
Cas raised an eyebrow, and Dean had to suppress the urge to shiver. “I’m gonna take a shower.” He said, and then tilted his head. “Are you gonna join me?” He said, mimicking Dean’s drawl.
have a higher risk for STDs with how bad you are at cleaning yourself up.”
“Unbelievable,” his voice was low, as if he was talking to himself. He let out a dark chuckle, shaking his head. “He – facing the man he
The process barely took longer than a handful of minutes. Dean was far too disappointed when Cas stepped back when he was done, taking his warmth away with him. The sound of the eyeliner being closed brought him to his senses enough for him to blink, eyes feeling wet, and he turned around, regarding himself in the mirror.
His mind brought up the abandoned stream of thought, as if it had never broken into disruption in the first place.
Cas’s eyes slid to the side as he mused over Sam’s words. “That seems unhealthy.”
“You don’t get to decide that.” Dean looked up, but then his posture turned defensive as he grabbed at Castiel’s hand.
And Cas took, with explicit consent offered alongside Dean on a silver platter.
“Tell me about it,” Sam huffed out a dry, humorless laugh.
talks to her.” Dean answered, hiding his smirk by taking a sip. Of the two of them, though, Dean was sooner to approach the girl – if only to secretly ask her to keep the drinks coming on. Normally, Cas wouldn’t approve of Dean getting drunk. However, Dean was feeling like a happy drunk this time – and a happy Dean only equated to a thoroughly satisfied Cas, so he had a feeling it would all workout anyway.
For some profound reason that escaped Castiel, he yet again found himself outside Dean’s bedroom. Laying on the left side of a bed in a worn shirt that Castiel knew was Dean’s favorite by the 3.14 on the top left corner and subsequently well worn, he might as well have been holding up a poster announcing, “
And Jesus, Dean thought as he gently put the bag on his bed. Had it really been decades since he’d gotten to do something like this?
Dean raised his eyebrows, entertained. “Whatever for, Sammy?” He said with faux innocence.
“Scoot,” he said shortly, not even waiting for Cas to budge an inch before he was crawling on top of the man, covering most of Cas with his limbs in an awkward embrace as he tried to make himself as comfortable as he could without falling off. “I’m right here. I’m fine and dandy. I’m breathing and alive. So go the fuck to sleep, will you? I’ll be right here when you wake up. I promise.”
“It’s mine, as well,” his companion states. They both linger for a moment more. Then, nodding as if he has made a decision—or maybe as a form of goodbye—the other man bypasses Dean to slip inside.
Dean’s eyes swung around, startled.
Instead, Dean tugs Cas forward by his belt loops, swallowing the sound of Cas’s surprise. Two seconds later, Cas is melting into him—and this is
It’s so unexpected a laugh bursts out of me—stomach muscles clenching in the process—and I wonder when was the last time I was caught off guard by something that wasn’t trying to kill or torture me. “You’re a weird dude, you know that?”
Castiel felt himself snorting at the tiny bubbles that appeared, then disappeared as Dean obviously struggled to figure out what to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabe’s suddenly nervous expression managed to kick Cas’s heart rate up a notch again. “Well, about that.... Uh. Crowley’s date was—sort of… your mother.”
“It’s just a part of understanding him. People are—jumbled up messes, to be honest. So, like if he’s sad about something or… or frustrated… there’s a good chance that there’s a little mad mixed in too.”
No music played in the silence between them, but the author hardly noticed—too many thoughts vying for attention in his head all at once. “Can I ask what you’re most angry with me about? Is it the mark or that I kept it from you?”
“Dean?” Lisa questioned from behind him.
And yet, in spite of the illusion that the bird changed position from one moment to the next, when comparing his picture to the one on his computer screen, the two images mirrored each other exactly.
“Dean!” A voice rumbles over me, full of concern. And that’s when I realize for the first time that my head is in my doppelganger’s lap. I sit up, woozily, so that Castiel can get to my older self but, to my surprise, his hands follow me, gently assessing my bleeding forehead.
Given how naturally he had made the same audience laugh a few moments ago, though, here Lee only got a few light chuckles. Castiel frowned down at the words in his hands—already wondering what could be rearranged to get a larger response.
“This should only delay us three days, maybe four,” Sam promises over the sound of passing cars on the highway. “We’re about two hours outside of Hayward, and, from what we can tell, it’s just a lone werewolf. But we can always put someone else on this if you--”
With a spike of guilt, Castiel relaxed his body language. Gabriel was right to be hurt. He had, after all, been keeping a pretty substantial secret from his cousin—the
“Make fun of me all you want, Jerk,” Sam huffs, rolling his eyes. “You know I’m right.”
Naomi pursed her lips but did let herself be led towards the same room he and Cas were in earlier, glancing distastefully at the grey concrete walls and stacks of boxes everywhere. Dean would kinda pay big money to see a spider fall on her head right about now.
“What the fuck do you mean ‘lost’? Did you put it in the washer and it never came out?”
I would know that voice anywhere.

a problem. It’s just… a cumulation of things that’s getting to me this morning.”
“According to my online sniffers, 68% of the first wave of comments seem pro-Destiel. Then we got 22% anti, followed by 7% who are criticizing Dean but don’t seem to have an opinion on Cas. The rest is all over the place. Some people saying it’s stupid to care about the private lives of celebrities in general. Others reminding people that you guys could be platonic soulmates—that sort of thing.”
In the distance, a bird chirped because they were assholes like that.
“That was…pretty intense,” Dean declares, finally, rubbing the palms of his hands against his jeans.
“Charlie, Sam, and I will deal with Crowley,” he promised, before taking a step back. And Dean didn’t stop him. - Cas telling Dean "I left, but you didn't stop me" while they were in Purgatory together in "The Trap" (15x09)
“So… self-checkout?” Dean suggested, even though they definitely had too many items for it.
Castiel fit the phone into the hollow of his neck so that he could better steer his cart around a corner. “That’s not how it works,” he told his boyfriend.
“The other Dean’s scar…my handprint on his shoulder. It’s…gone.”
“No,” the other man says, simply—and damn, Dean’s pretty sure he’s never been turned down that quickly—or that politely. He’s also acutely aware of how much he wanted Cas to say ‘yes.’
Castiel looked back at his laptop screen—at the judgmental blinking of the cursor only one sentence into his fifth chapter. “I don’t have time for this.”
“That’s—” the other man started.
—than regular guy friends who meet up at a bar once a week to discuss football.”
“Look. In my experience, you don’t have to believe a rumor to still be hurt by it. I’m not saying this to bum you out. I just… want you to be prepared. If it wasn’t so weird, I’d suggest you talk to Lisa. She’s definitely gone through the rounds a few times and I think she could offer you a better perspective than Dean or I can.”
“Bossy. Have you always been this bossy?”
For several minutes now, Dean’s mind had been floating between postcard-like images of beaches and Claymation-style Christmas cartoons, but suddenly, the other pieces of what Gabriel was saying fell into place. “Are you seriously giving me the ‘you hurt him, I’ll hurt you’ speech?” he asked, incredulously. “What? Am I picking Cas up for prom?”
He turns towards me and our shoulders inadvertently brush in the process. “I’ve done a lot of things I regret, Cas…but…more than that…” He closes his eyes. “God, this is gonna sound like a fuckin’ cliché, but there’s a lot of stuff I
“Guess someone’s home,” Lisa announced, turning to put both of their now-empty plates in the sink—and despite everything Castiel had just been thinking and worrying about, he couldn’t help but feel the warmth and the excitement of that purr in his gut.
I'm so, so sorry. I know I'm super behind and I've felt terrible about it. But I moved about three weeks ago and that's taken up a lot of my time. Hoping to update more regularly again.
There was a
sounds kind of weird. “Wait for me,” Dean says instead, which is hardly better. Cas nods and turns, and Dean catches a glimpse of Jimmy Novak’s back muscles through the thin material of Cas’s dress shirt.
Dean sighs, rolling over so that his back is to the angel, feeling Cas tense behind him. He scoots a few paces forward to make room. “Are you just gonna stand there or are you going to join me like a normal person?”
. Most people fidgeted. He stayed so resolutely still that he could make himself practically invisible to people only a few feet away—so that even a slight movement on his part would cause them to jump in surprise. “We need to get you a bell,” Gabriel had snarked, but Castiel found this ability of his useful for people watching.
the influenza virus festering in your cells.” He began to beseech. “Just let me–”
“Sleep, Cas,” he mumbled, voice muffled against the side of Cas’s head.
“That Cas?” Sam’s voice came through as he pulled the phone back to his ear, and Dean huffed.
Misha inhaled, a small, content smile playing on his lips even as he closed his eyes, despite a tear having slipped free and making its way down his cheek. Hands to the sidc, he braced himself, standing proud and holding the position for the few seconds they’d needed to later add the special effects to onscreen.
The smile he offered Cas next was a little more genuine, if sympathetic. “I’ve had almost four decades of experience with his particular brand of ‘Ass-fection.’ He’s also a
“So, if you don’t mind keeping my brother company? I’m you could show him all around the island and keep him entertained enough to not barge in on yours truly’s lovefest. What do you say, help a poor, hopeless romantic out, who also happens to be an unbelievably considerate brother?” He tried, crossing his fingers behind his back.
“Yeah, heh. Figured that out when I was having a nice little conversation with dear old pops. Put two and two together and, if I was a kindergartner and this didn’t make sense, I’d say I got four, even if I’m not entirely sure it’s right but, hey, it sounds plausible!”
He was having a hard time telling himself that, needless to say. Fifteen years on the show, twelve with Misha, and every day, he was saying goodbye to one character or the other, just like he would have to tomorrow and the day after, but this one…
“It’s okay,” he repeated, not for the first time, and probably wouldn’t be the last. He’d keep it up, Jensen knew, for as long as it took for Jensen to actually believe Misha. “I won’t be going anywhere – I’ll be waiting for you.”
chose to express yourself, how you are right now… it is truly an honor to be allowed to see you like this.”
“Vaseline.” Cas answered simply, and then they both stopped talking as Cas pushed a finger in. Dean’s muscles threatened to go lax, slumping against Cas’s readily waiting body, strong and firm behind him. He let out a moan as Cas aimed directly for his prostate, barely stroking more than twice before pulling out, only to return with two fingers.
“Okay, Cas is sorry, Dean, you’re being cautiously optimistic, and Cas' dad made a weird link between you two that let Castiel be a special snowflake. That’s great and all, but can we talk about the elephant in the room?” Sam exclaimed, bringing their attention back onto him. “How the hell are you even alive?” He asked, voicing what was on all of their minds.
Granted, it didn’t take much effort, but it was a matter of spirit. And Cas’ finally allowed him to give in with those words, falling asleep within seconds.
“Gimme a sec,” he murmured to Cas. Apart from his boyfriend ignoring his words in favor of eyeing him – he knew going bare chested with only shorts would be a good idea, the sun did wonders at giving him a fast tan –  Cas didn’t say anything, so he swiftly made his way to Eileen.
Cas cocked his head at Dean’s words, but the look in his eyes told Dean he knew what exactly was going through Dean’s head. “Tell Sam not to bother mentioning it. Really.”
sorry, Dean.” He looked up, face so passionate and beseeching, it stole Dean’s breath when he was met with the full intensity of those eyes. “On my father’s behalf, I apologize. That’s why I brought you to the hospital – to explain, what I knew, anyway. And to express my remorse, because it was my father’s fault that your life was stolen from you, and there is nothing I can actually say or do that will make up for that.”
“And at worst?”
By now, his eyes were open, and with some constant blinking, kept the water away from his eyes enough to see Cas clearly enough when he looked affronted. “I managed just fine before I met you.” He reminded stiffly.
“I don’t see how I need to persuade you any further.” Cas murmured.
could drive?” Sam stared bewilderedly from the keys in his palm to his brother.
“Trump? Yeah, dude, you should see the videos they’re making, I swear, every time the guy does something stupid, I’d think, alright. That’s gotta be the height of it. And then he goes and does something bigger.”
“You were Sleeping Beauty in my bedroom. I freaked.” Sam said, looking rather unapologetic. “We’ve been here since we found you. You wouldn’t wake up, but you had a pulse, and we didn’t know what else to do.”
“I would never use my grace without his consent,” Cas needlessly explained. “But… he won’t let me help. At all.”
And that’s what it was all about, he knew. Because Cas just looked at him, broken and fearful. Dean’s heart gave a painful pang, reminding Dean of his own, sudden and weird, mortality.
His boyfriend appeared, adorably ruffled and looking no less weary. His coat was slung over a shoulder, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and tie loosened. Dean realized he might need to cut his call with his brother short.
With a shout that had him stiffening like a board, clambering for proper grip in the slippery shower stall, Dean came untouched, his come spurting against the tiles in front of him. As his muscles clenched around Cas’s cock, Cas let out a primal yell, and shoved him against the wall, making his come smear against his belly and softening cock, and came inside Dean, spilling hot come in him.
Cas hummed, hooking his chin over Dean’s other shoulder, nuzzling at Dean’s jaw. “Nuh-uh,” he said, albeit with some difficulty, revealed in the strain in his voice. “Wash your hands first.” He reminded, though not without an eye roll of his own.
Castiel gave Dean a flat stare. “Yes. Only because you’re being insufferably stubborn… I didn’t pull you out of hell to watch you suffer needlessly.” Dean became more so red-faced, Castiel doubted that increase was due to the fever, and looked down and away, absently scratching at his unkempt stubble.
“You dare test me?” Cas growled. He slammed him against the shower wall, all the breath being punched out of Dean’s lungs. He had no idea how the hell they got in here so quickly without him noticing, but then Cas was biting down on his collarbone, and apart from melting into a puddle of useless goo, Dean wasn’t sure what he was supposed to be doing. “My name causes lowlives on the streets to leaders trembling in fear, and you think you can order me around?”
“I heard noises,” Cas’s voice was still low, unsure but a comforting rumble that vibrated through Dean’s chest as he went on. “I thought everyone was asleep but… I just wanted to check, is everything alright?”
Still, he couldn’t help but automatically jibe back. “Yeah, you’re a big cuddly badass, I get it.”
Oh, lord, Cas was only getting closer, what the
Dean sighed happily, letting Cas mindlessly pound away, milking himself through his orgasm. When his pace finally slowed, he tried to turn his head as best as he could, letting his fingers card through wet hair before gently cradling the side of Cas’s face to draw him into a kiss.
Lounging on a beach with a fruity drink that was surprisingly good, sand under his toes and the warm sun shining from above, Dean couldn’t think of a better way to announce a big, “fuck you” to the world. Free hand under his head, he watched his brother making a fool of himself in the waves, feeling content underneath all the levels of amusement and entertainment washing over him as gently as the tides lapping at the shore.
“Looks good,” Dean commended, eyes taking himself in further, even though he didn’t need to. Behind him, Cas was silent for only a second.
“Don’t call me that,” Sam said. “And for ‘not murdering’ the druglord responsible for all those teens that kept overdosing lately.”
Staring back at the keys in his hand, he looked through the back window, Cas’s rigid form a visible contrast from his brother slouching in the seat, listing to the side. His eyebrows furrowing, Sam nonetheless made his way to the driver seat. Getting in, he cast a look at his brother through the rearview mirror, before starting up the car. Things were silent in the backseat until they reached the freeway, Sam unable to help casting intermittent glances at his brother. At one point, Cas shrugged off his trenchcoat and draped it over Dean. Apart from his eyebrows climbing to his hairline, Sam kept his mouth shut. Probably a good thing he was too worried about his brother to try riling Dean up, because when Cas spoke up, his low, gravelly voice was almost swallowed up by the sound of Baby’s wheels eating up the driveway. His ears unconsciously strained to hear Cas’s words.
, but his muscles and calloused knuckles still spelled
“I know, Cas. I do.” Sam hastened to elaborate. “But this is
Or he could man up and… Dean snorted at himself with the choice of words. A bunch of other phrases flitted through his head, from ‘no time like the present,’ to ‘an opportunity as rare as this…’
Sam shot him a bitchface. “That's... not a word. And,” he paused, looking hesitant. “I don’t… actually know? You disappeared from the hospital, and Cas and I–”
“At least you have a case to keep yourself busy with. Bobby sent us all home.”
Sam shot him a dubious look, and although it wasn’t intended as a warning, Dean realized he should probably be pacing himself. God, he’d been dead for years, who knew what state his tolerance and organs were? It wasn’t like he could check with a doctor for the latter, but some self-experimenting would probably do perfectly fine for the former.
Flushed and fighting to steady his breathing, Dean turned around, leaning against the sink.
“Hey,” he said, feeling a little awkward now that he was with her. When Eileen only smiled at him professionally and didn’t look too confused, he hesitantly went on. “So, I was thinking. You see those two studs I came with?” He pointed a thumb over his shoulder without bothering to look, too focused on Eileen’s eyes darting over to the men instead, and lingering on one person in particular. He wasn’t too worried about her eyeing up the wrong man – the first half hour they spent at the beach was making out filthily until Sam threw a bucket of sand on them.
“Please,” he pleaded. “Fuck me,
Cas pecked Dean’s lips. “You do have me wrapped around you.”
but his head was hung back, a thermometer in his mouth. If Castiel couldn’t tell Dean was sick from the fact that he was willingly holding a book that could potentially count as research, then he’d have to have been senseless to not notice the germs practically radiating from Dean. Unbidden, Castiel’s pointer finger came up to Dean’s forehead, remembering himself only an inch away before his fingertip could come in contact.
Dean scoffed, even as he shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “Hey, now you’re just being a Debbie Downer. You know, wasting breath on the what-ifs and what-could've.”
Seated in a circle around Sam’s small kitchen table, Dean waited for Sam to finish pouring them all a shot of whiskey. His brother had barely sat down before Dean was untangling a hand from Cas’s grip to down his drink, biting back a wince at the burn as he impatiently gestured at his brother to pour him another.
Only, later, the sound of retching drew Castiel to the bunker’s bathroom, and when he found Dean hunched over a toilet, resting his head on crossed arms and mirroring the same pose from back in the kitchen except now over a toilet, Castiel almost held back, annoyed and exasperated. But then Dean retched painfully, and Castiel was inevitably tugged forward as if by an invisible line, unrelenting until he found himself kneeling behind Dean, rubbing a soothing hand over Dean’s back. “Dean, please.” It hurt to see him like this, when Castiel knew for a fact he could do something about it, if only Dean would
“Then why don’t you do something about it?” Dean said breathlessly.
“Yeah. Okay,” he sighed. “Better.”
clearly not getting it. “I mean you, Cas.” Sam said bluntly, childishly enjoying watching Cas flush and lean back.
Dean smirked, a plan forming in his head. Two birds and all…
Dean stared at Cas. “And you didn’t bother to, I don’t know, stage an intervention or something?”
Dean, who had a shovel still over his shoulder, other hand on the Impala trunk, tiredly pausing and replying without even looking at Sam. “Keep your panties on, Samantha.” He sighed, shoulders slumping further. “Tough hunt, is all.” Tossing the shovel into the trunk, he slammed it close, wearily making his way to Baby’s backseat. Sam tossed a worried look at Castiel, who only mirrored it before getting in with Dean.
The last time wasn’t easy to remember because Dean didn’t know then that it would be the last time – until now. Each moment was just as likely to be the last, so he’d savored every moment as much as he could, but the time when he felt truly alone was when he’d gone all out.
he still hadn’t wiped the tears away from his face. He knew, technically, they’d be calling him back after they’d reset the markers and everything, for them to shoot the final scene of the episode, where he’d be seated where he fell, ignoring Sam’s phone call and sobbing, mourning Cas’s death.
Redirecting his thoughts, he continued the stream of almost nonsensical dialogue in his head.
“Good.”
They hung up without further fanfare, and no longer at the risk of traumatizing his brother, Dean was free to give Cas his full attention. He eyes his boyfriend up and down with exaggeratedly slow movements. “You just gonna stand there?” He drawled.
Cas looked at Sam with furrowed eyebrows, confused. “But that wasn’t–”
Sam, by that point, had reached them, and flopped on his beach towel with a barely hidden sigh.
“This other car came out of leftfield,” Dean interrupted, voice soft. “Hit mine straight into the driver’s side, where I was. I, uh. I died on impact,” he repeated the words with a shaky grin. “I – Sam never knew anything about the other driver. We – my family, we were only told that the other driver was in the hospital, but. Sam–”
“So… do you remember what happened?” Cas’ voice was as shaky as his body, a fine tremor in his hands concealed by holding onto Dean’s. Their fingers interlaced, Dean held back just as tight. The disbelief he felt was mirrored on his brother and – boyfriend? – Cas’s face.
At the moment, his tongue was still fighting a war of its own, deciding whether to side with his mind or body.
Jensen blinked, feeling shaken. Misha immediately dropped his battle ready stance, except rather than preparing to fight, he’d been ready to give himself to the Empty’s clutches, sacrificing himself for the world… for Dean.
“Nope.”
Dean nodded. “And I, being tied to Sammy, only knew things from his perspective, so we were both pretty much in the dark. Until…”
“No way, Cas. You’re still runnin’ low.” Sam sighed. His stupid, self-sacrificing brother. He may have had a point, though, with Cas having used up most of his grace for the hunt.
When Cas hit his prostate, Dean felt like a bolt of lightning went through him. He dared to pull a hand away from the wall, grabbing onto Cas’s head, guiding him back down to his neck. Taking the hint for what it was, Cas laved Dean’s skin with attention, sucking and nibbling. Dean impatiently mewled, and Cas let out a dark chuckle before he actually bit down.
“Tell me about it.”
“He’s being…
“Hey, Jensen. Look at me.” He wasn’t aware he’d ever looked away, but he looked back, now, staring into those cerulean blues… Unbidden, his hands rose without conscious thought, clutching onto the lapels of that damn trench coat, bringing Misha ever closer, until their toes of their shoes were bumping into each other. Resting his forehead against Misha’s, for a second, Jensen just let himself feel the warm puffs of air Misha gently let out with each exhale, soft against his own damp face.
Richard had come over to them, clapping Misha on the shoulder, congratulating him, and the rest of the crew were following, but Jensen hung back, a gaping hole in his chest leaving him to feel…
Sam sighed, closing his book to give Cas his full attention. For reasons he knew but wasn’t gonna address aloud, Cas was being far more bothered about this whole thing, and Sam would’ve had to have been soulless to not throw the poor guy a bone. “Look, Cas. Atlas has
Jensen tried to smile. It felt stilted. “Still. ‘S gonna feel weird, man.”
“Nah. I’m kinda betting on Eileen to make the first move here.” They both looked at Eileen. She’d been blissfully ignorant of Sam doing… whatever awkward mating ritual dance it was Sam was doing in the water so far. But now, his brother was dejectedly coming out of the water, and the girl’s eyes were pinned on his brother’s undeniably well toned body. If anyone needed any informing on blatantly obvious subjects, it was Eileen – the poor girl had been at the blender for several minutes already, and Dean didn’t need supervision to see that the drink was very well blended.
“Castiel,” Naomi Novak’s voice was as crisp as an ironed suit. “How are you? How’s your internship progressing?”
And why, of all couples, did it seem so interested in the two of them? Some people didn’t ever meet their soulmate—or, as in his mother’s case, they met them too late. But its hand seemed heavy here. Shouldn’t he walk away just out of principle?
He’s got to admit though, that, based on looks alone, the dude is not what he would have expected. He seems… pretty normal for someone who named himself like an emo garage band. Admittedly, he’s a bit hungover, but his blonde hair is kept in short spikes that are obviously the work of product and his brown overcoat matches his professional-looking loafers.
“Dean, we’ve only made it through…” Sam pauses to count, “Ten questions!”
think you’re lying.”
” I sputter.
“Yes,” he admitted.
A lot of times I played to my strengths—the shooter games, the racers—but for a while there, I got obsessed with pinball. For one thing, you could often play for an hour on a single quarter without having another kid breathe on your neck waiting for their turn.
He was passing by the common area later, having shed his coat and loosened his tie. It may have smelled like Dean, but it was the very same person who’d always nagged at him about making himself at home… plus, it seemed far more comfortable to have the trenchcoat out of the way for once as he tried to deal with Dean. He wasn’t exactly looking for him… but Castiel may have intentionally walked into the common room because he could sense the brothers’ presence there. And sure enough, they were both seated in adjacent armchairs, Sam looking very unimpressed even as he read through a book titled
“Cas’s asking if the body happens to be blond, weird eyed, and matches Azazel on your system?” Dean dutifully repeated. There was a pause before he could hear a flurry of noises, presumably Sam pulling himself to his computer and furiously typing away.
but the book’s attempt at humor still entertained Sam. So he was a little disgruntled but not at all surprised when Cas huddled over with a cup of coffee, entire countenance writing defeat all over the angel.
Cas continued to stare with wide-eyes,
Can gaped. “How—”
“Anytime, buddy.” He tapped the angel’s shoulder as he passed by him. “Good luck.”
“I could just–”
“Well. I think he feels responsible for the curse that messed up your grace.”
…” His head bobbed back down as he let out a rather toxic smelling burp, but he resolutely came back up to, “No!” This time, Castiel let out a long-suffering sigh.
But anyway, back to the matter on hand – Eileen was one of the girls who’d been personally underseen by Cas’s scrutinizing tests, no doubt, so if Sam had the hots for this girl, he would happily cheer his little brother on. In the best, most embarrassing way an older brother could possibly do.
Sam made a noise of disgust. “Okay, first off, don’t ever say ‘booty call’ again. Second off, please tell me he wasn’t behind the body that just showed up on Fourth Avenue.”
He wasn’t making any sense, barely even to himself, but Misha understood, of course, he understood what Jensen was getting at. “It’s okay. There’s only two more episodes, Jensen. The boys… they need this fight. And not to sound prideful, but I think Cas was done justice, getting his ending in his own episode.”
Eyes closed and not bothering to open them, not with the water still hitting them directly in the face anyway, Dean raised his eyebrows. “Oh, yeah?”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know what to tell you. He said he was sorry for driving into me that day – that he never should’ve went out. And that if he could change things, he would’ve. But,” he frowned. “Ultimately, what happened, happened. So he just hoped we could find a way to move on.”
“...Tried talking to Dean?” Sam offered with a kind but knowing smile. He had a feeling he knew exactly how the encounter carried out without needing to be there.
“So insolent,” he muttered. Dean hummed, letting his head fall back onto Cas’s shoulder.
“What… what about my father do you–” Cas cut himself off, looking conflicted, but Dean understood what he couldn’t say, what was weighing on his – and no doubt Sam’s – mind.
until the ‘higher-ups’ forced him to shut down for his own worker’s safety.”
Sweeping the now empty packaging off his bed, he brought out one of the smaller bottles from the bag. This, like shaving, would take some time, but unlike shaving himself, would need more focus, more care. Hands steady with guns were not the same with makeup, so he made sure he was as comfortable as he could be, lounging on his bed without allowing himself to get distracted by the stockings straining around his legs, the corset tightening momentarily before he settled, the way he’d reclined showcasing the beautiful arch of his soles and the muscles that stayed tense in his calves with the long stilettos adorning his feet…
Dean is hit with another overwhelming wave of relief, surprised at how happy he is that Jack wants to come with him. “Of course. We’ll figure out what we’re doing in the morning.”
He can't do this without his brother, but he also knows that Dean can't do it without Cas.
Dean stumbles into the kitchen, finding some Advil for his headache and washing it down with a bottle of beer. At this point, who cares if he gets into an accident while going to find Sam? If he somehow makes it to Heaven, maybe Cas will be in his memories.
“Cas and I.” Dean clears his throat, his hand absently twisting in Cas’s sleeve, “We’re leaving the bunker and quitting hunting.”
When they get back to the bunker, Sam heads towards the kitchen. Dean and Cas trail behind him, and he can hear Cas murmur something to Dean which causes Dean to laugh once, short and loud.
So, when Sam sees Dean get out of the Impala after Chuck makes everything disappear, his face looking like hell and his eyes empty, appearing listless even from a distance, Sam knows something horrible has happened to Cas.
Dean barely seems to register. He’s looking at his phone, and Sam sees that it’s Cas’s name lighting up the screen.
That morning, Sam can see it in the slope of Dean’s shoulders. Dean is ready to die. There isn’t a bottle in his brother’s hands, and his eyes are clear for the first time in weeks.
Jack’s voice hits him before he’s ready. A punch to an already open and bleeding wound. How the hell is he supposed to tell this kid that his father is dead?
* * *
He’s only focused on Cas, whose hands are twisted in Dean’s shirt holding him there but not pushing for more. Cas’s knuckles are white from the strength of which he’s holding onto Dean.
Ruffling Jack’s hair, or laughing too long at one of the kid’s bad jokes, is an indication that Dean’s feeling guilty for how he treated him before.
It’s a pathetic way to cover up the fact that Dean wants Cas to stay, that he’s not sure he’d be able to fall asleep the first night back on earth if the angel isn’t beside him.
Dean staggers through the door, leaving his phone, not wanting to see anything on it. Knowing there are texts from Cas on there that he never answered out of anger and spite. Knowing there are calls from Sam that he simply can’t handle in this moment.
When he pulls into the town Sam said he was in, he has no trouble finding Sam and Jack. They’re the only ones there. Dean wishes he could find it in himself to care even a little bit. He thinks probably, somewhere beneath the grief, there’s a voice begging for him to not give up.
He’s also the only person alive who understands what Dean is feeling right now.
Dean doesn’t like to talk about his feelings. He’s not the main character in a chick flick so why should he?
Dean stares at Cas until Cas meets his eyes and shrugs, taking a sip from his coffee. Dean nods, seemingly bracing himself for something.
“Not my fault you’re comfy.”
Tired of waiting for a response, Dean starts leaning in, his eyes darting to Cas’s lips. Cas’s hand comes up to cup Dean’s face and Dean closes his eyes.
* * *
Sam registers that this must be what Dean looks like when he’s worshipping.
Sam nods, “Well we have to find a way, I’ll help you.”
“He’s alive?” Dean breathes. When Jack nods, Dean grabs his arm again, “Take me to him?”
Left him, when Dean had finally asked him to stay.
But by the time they get into the Impala, Sam, heart sinking, notices that the glassy far away look has returned to Dean’s eyes.
“Cas.” Dean says in answer to the look, “Where is he?”
Jack stays with them when he can. He brings back books from all over the world. He said he was going to take a hands off approach with humanity, but Sam knows he’s breaking his own rule to save Dean.
Eventually, Sam clears his throat and makes a pointed look at Dean, “Nice of you to call and say where you were.”
Cas doesn’t let him out of it.
Jack tilts his head, and Sam sees Dean close his eyes against the familiar movement. Jack takes a moment to think.
* * *
Dean watches with his heart aching as Sam reunites with Eileen, and he hugs Charlie absently. Hours later, when Jack is finally walking away, Dean rushes after him leaving Bobby, Jody and Donna mid conversation.
“I love you too.” Dean replies.
Dean is barely aware of what’s going on, focusing too hard on the kid he’s trying to comfort, when Sam claps him on the back.
Nowadays, he always breaks under Cas’s stare. Honest for a moment before distracting the angel with a kiss, or dirty joke, successfully hiding his feelings away from prying eyes.
Jack looks on with sympathy, and Michael’s face is unreadable. Sam is fed up though. He storms after his brother, but pauses when he reaches Dean’s door, hearing him speaking.
A pause and then, “You left before I could say it back.”
“It’s a good episode.” Dean mumbles, snuggling in closer to Cas’s side.
“He’s in heaven, Dean.” Jack responds, looking up, “I brought him back right away, but he said he needed to do something first.”
Dean nods and leaves the room, heading to his bedroom hoping to be able to clean up a bit before Cas comes to stay with him. He realizes that he’s been assuming that Cas will be joining him for bed, and he resolutely ignores the swooping feeling in his stomach.
Sam expects shouting, but instead in a forced calm voice, Dean says, “Everyone is gone. Charlie, Bobby, Jody, Donna.”
Across the room his phone chimes once. Dean pretends not to hear. The sun is rising now. It’s been hours. Hours since Cas told him he loved him and was taken seconds later. Hours since Cas last placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder, leaving a mark so similar to the first mark he left on Dean- the mark that claimed his soul.
Sam had thought Dean had reached the absolute depths of unknowable emotions. But before, Sam could at least understand some things, catch a few tells and emotions amidst the blankness, now it might as well not even be Dean walking around.
He missed her so much. He hadn’t allowed himself to dwell on it, but it feels as though his heart is being sewn back together, his limbs reattached, air gushing back into his empty lungs.
Sam feels as though they’re all underwater. One night as he lies in bed staring at the ceiling, he wonders how long Dean will be able to hold his breath before he drowns in it.
Relief flashes across Dean’s face at whatever he understands from Cas, and Cas gives a small slow smile.
“They’d split apart,” Castiel pointed out. “And likely result in one or both of us getting severely injured.”
you fried chicken salesman,” Balthazar hollered back, causing Castiel’s shoulders to square.
“That wasn’t his fault, exactly,” I wince, knowing how this would sound to a younger version of myself. “Cas’s got a human form now, but he didn’t know he needed one right after he yanked our ass out of the basement. Didn’t really know how to talk to people either—you know, the screeching. He
“Got one with two Queens?”
“Since I just admitted I won’t be becoming a doctor, no offense taken.” Castiel tilted his head, thoughtfully. “Though I will say I agree with your brother. You’re much less likely to need surgery or other forms of involved treatment—where the risk of accidents is substantially higher—if you seek out preventative care.”
And yet, what drew Cas’s attention the most were photos supposedly taken in front of the courthouse by passersby just yesterday.
“I’m going to establish boundaries. No trying to talk me out of my career… or you. I’m pretty sure she still doesn’t like you.”
It had become somewhat of a monthly tradition for the eight of them to gather and watch Jeopardy together—a game that Castiel won quite often, though at the moment he was trailing Anna by several hundred points. He pulls his attention from his score chart back to the screen.
By the time Cas has caught Dean up on all the behind-the-scenes action between him and Rafael and him and Crowley, a half an hour or more had passed—and somehow, Dean can feel it getting darker outside, even stuck in a place without windows.
For the next several minutes, Crowley talked to the audience about
Castiel’s soulmate gave a one-armed, awkward shrug. “I guess… yeah.”
“Dean?” Cas asked, attempting to hand it back to him.
One is of him and his mom back when he’s a little kid—just the hint of John’s thumb hovering in the corner of the shot. The next is one Claire took. He and Sam are on opposite sides of the Impala, in the middle of laughing at some joke he can’t remember. Meanwhile, Cas stands behind Dean’s shoulder, only his eyes hinting at his own amusement.
/////
“I… What?” Cas asked, deeply confused.
Cas figured that the question was rhetorical, so he didn’t bother answering it. Instead, he switched topics. “Crowley implied he wouldn’t give this photo out as long as I didn’t provoke him. But I find it difficult to trust his word at the moment.”
go, the actor reached into his pocket, looking for change. What he pulled out was a pile of coins, several balls of lint, mint wrappers, and a fortune cookie message that read, “Ignore previous cookie,” but at last, he separated out just the quarters. “Here,” he gestured and Castiel obediently opened up his palm.
“Maybe I should split the difference. Wear the pajama pants but add the suit jacket.”
“I guess I… miss Dean. Before, when we were just friends, it seemed easier to spend time with him. The movie wasn’t actively shooting, for one—but we also… It’s
He sets it on the desk. “We can finish questions tomorrow,” he declares, standing up and loosening his tie so that it falls more like it used to.
Dean looked between Cas’s face and his hand, wryly—but there was amusement coming back into his expression. “Such a dork,” he murmured at last, but he reached out anyway. Only when their hands came in contact—Dean’s fingers touching Cas’s wrist and vice versa—Cas tried to make it so that they were holding hands instead.
“If you’re up for it.” He took one last bite of food before migrating back toward the couch.
All in all, he did better than Sam had on
“I don’t usually encounter people as confusing as you,” Cas retorted, turning to face him again—his expression looking war-torn.
—It was apparently effective.
surprise him. “The next question is, ‘Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it.’
Her body language turned concerned in an instant. “Why? Did something happen?”
“Course I am,” he insists. “…Buddy.”
The same truth that everyone else had been telling him for days now—weeks—but which he’d fought not to see. Because, deep down, he knew how much it would blow up his life.
, I didn’t mean for this to happen. When you said—all that stuff about me—and Cas—I didn’t—I really didn’t know it was true.”
“Trust me, I’m not trying to put you on the spot or anything. I just… assumed you were straight.” Another quick look-over. “But if your cousin is yanking your chain about spending time with me, I’m guessing it’s ‘cause you’re not.”
Mo finished whispering to the person next to him. “Reset the room!” he yelled, whipping his index finger around in a circle as Dean bent over to retrieve his shirt. “We’re going again.”
what was that?” Other Me punches my bicep the minute she’s gone.
“The bunker’s only a half hour away. We should go there first—see if we can get her to talk.”
“Oh, she knows,” Dean promised. “She called me out on having a thing for you
“He’s that aware of his grace? I thought it was like blood or your soul—you don’t really notice it until it’s missing,” Sam interrupts, eagerly.
Now, Dean has never been the kind of person to believe in that ‘if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it all’ bullshit, but he does manage to spare Kevin the number of creative curse words going through his mind at the moment.
And with that, he finds just a little more bravery. Enough courage to roll onto his back, holding Cas’s arm in place on his shoulder so that the angel is forced to get up out of his chair to follow his movement. Enough courage to look up at Cas—half-standing, half-crouching over his bed—and, when he is sure Cas won’t move away, to lift the hand that had been trapping the angel and raise it to Cas’s own shoulder, so that their positions mirror each other.
“I think that maybe… she’s been really lonely,” Castiel explained, guilt inflating like a balloon inside of him. “My father left. Bartholomew didn’t work out. And she’s too abrasive to have many friends. Perhaps, with me gone off to a different state, she just wanted companionship… and now that’s ruined too.”
it to me so that you can see my reaction and stop worrying?” Castiel proposed, in part to soothe Dean and part because he could feel his own curiosity brimming.
—who are you choosing every time?”
“Hello, Charlie.”
“I’m serious,” he says, palms spread to show us he’s not holding a weapon. “I’ve done it a few times now, so it’s less of a shock to me. But time travel is definitely real and you are definitely from 2008.”
He flicks his eyes sideways.

he decided on at last. “He feels things so
“Could you have

just compare
The actor rolled his head in Cas’s direction. “You still up for this?” he echoed his question from an hour ago, motioning between the two of them. The car key was still in his hand rather than in the ignition.
“Sam,
the actor had time for jokes at the ungodly hour that he woke up.
He held the permanent marker suspended in mid-air. He’d only gotten as far as the “s,” which he could finagle into an “a,” so he did, followed by an “n.”
“I know. I just don’t think you’re funny. Now go make up with Cas,” Sam urged, with what sounded like a light shove to the shoulder. “I’m 22 and I feel like I only now discovered what it’s like to see Mom and Dad fight.”
“Hey,” Dean says, smacking me in the knee until I open one eye to look at him. “I’m not trying to be an asshole. If you want to sit on the bench a while longer, it’s not like I’m gonna tell you to play ball.”
“And I presume that means you two are also not sleeping together?”
“Anything else?”
I'm sorry this took so long! I actually wrote a large chunk of a Sam POV chapter--but I got to this one part in it and couldn't make myself write it anymore--and I think it was because I knew that what I was having 2016 Dean do in that version of things wasn't in character. After I've tried so hard to slowly grow him in a realistic way, it just wasn't settling right. So I started over and am much more satisfied with the results--hopefully, you are too.
“I…I thought that we weren’t using my powers for a while.”

“And then it turns out you’re my
“When I was younger, I was… gifted,” Castiel continued as if he hadn’t heard the interruption. “It was easy for me to win the school writing contest and the science fair, that sort of thing. I didn’t have to study for tests, didn’t have to practice between taekwondo lessons. I believe I was even considered fairly sociable until I was about nine.
you’re my brother and I love you—no matter who you are or what you like.”
“OK, now to do something about your hair.”
“Because it’s a dude who didn’t want to shoot their shot before,” Dean finished for her, trying not to remember what it was like to be sixteen—to first see the phoenix on his chest—and hope to God that some random guy didn’t show up on his dad’s doorstep to blow all his plans out of the water before he had enough to properly support Sammy.
Chapter 25: "Automatically, Castiel started patting his own pockets. “Ah, ah, ah,” Crowley admonished, snatching the device away from him with deft fingers just as he’d unlocked the home screen. “Not the time for distractions. I’ll be taking this until after you’re finished.”
Cas nods, but Dean can see the tension in every line of his body.
When Dean speaks next, his words are quieter to hide any warbling-weirdness that might be going on in his throat. “With most people, it’s easy to tell they’re into me physically because that’s
Castiel grit his teeth. He knew from experience that if he just stayed quiet, she would leave the topic alone, content with having gotten her digs in, but that didn’t mean the temptation to argue wasn’t still there.
“She’s like the little sister you never wanted. Also, she’s so far from swinging your way, she’s facing away from the field.”
The Dean and Bobby in front of me begin opening fire. I feel the bullets like I felt the insults of high school bullies—barely noticing of them, knowing that they have no idea who they’re really messing with. Half a second later, I’ve forgotten about the bullets altogether.
“…I assume it’s because seven is a prime number, and prime numbers can be intimidating.”
indulge in some more covetous looks and thoughts than I would with anyone else.” Cas frowns at him. “Let me be clearer. Yes, I can be aroused by you. Yes, I
The author did his best to hide a grimace. “I already have plans for lunch.”
Castiel gave a small smile, “The irony.”
Ben’s nose wrinkled automatically. “
“Dean, don’t look like that, it’s--”
“If you needed someone else to drive Baby for you, who would you rather it be—Lisa or Cas?”
“And you? How are you?” Castiel wondered, his eyes catching on the calendar he’d pinned to the wall and never moved past August.
“I do talk to your brother, you know.”
Dean goes still almost immediately.
Sam immediately rummages around in his pocket, pulling out a cellphone that’s a lot smaller and less shiny than the kind Castiel is used to seeing the lab techs use. “Hey Jody, what’s—” he starts, only for his words to get cut off by the piercing sounds of screams.
As he discovered either Sunday or Monday when the peace of the morning was broken by, of all things,
Hannah sat with perfect posture in the seat beside him, eyes still on her tablet, and Castiel felt himself relax slightly now that he was no longer under anyone’s direct scrutiny.
“Ow! What was that for, Bitch?”
I tell him, honestly, seeing his consciousness swirl with embarrassment.
“Maybe I should go shower before breakfast,” Cas offered, seeming uncomfortable. “I fear I’m—very sweaty.”
The bookstore had a large pit in the center, with stairs rising up in a circular design, sort of like stadium seats. “Hey, I should probably let you—you know,” Dean said, when the three of them were a few feet from the main body of the crowd. There were eyes on them, of course—whispers growing louder—but now that the moment was almost upon him, Castiel felt oblivious to that. For one, their attention seemed to mostly be on Dean—and for another, that’s just how he was built. Often restless in the face of something looming, he found calm in being—in doing.
He hadn’t gotten far in the attempt when he felt a finger jab his side. “Wha—”
So, she kisses him, and curls into his back, and only after his breaths even out with sleep does she sneak her laptop off the bedside table. If only she had the privilege others did—of checking up on their exes by typing “Dean Winchester” into a search bar on Facebook. Instead, she has to search local news stories from across the country, looking for what doesn’t fit—for brief mentions of federal agents with names that came off worn-out cassette tapes.
Past Dean still has John's voice in his head, that’s pretty clear. It’s what makes him frown at his older self for walking around in a robe and slippers, like owning anything
finish that sentence.”
That was the thing. He didn’t have a clue. He recognized that words like ‘I’m sorry’ and ‘I never wanted to hurt you’ belonged in there somewhere, but his throat was tight like he was wearing a boa constrictor for a necklace, his breath coming out in short stutters, and what he ended up saying was. “I
I open my mouth to say something, anything, so that this young version of me never has to know what it was like to find her body. And that’s when the car hits us.
Ben was seated on the black leather couch that Dean—and Cas—were prone to taking naps on, his tongue stuck out in concentration as he played a video game on the TV.
“My apologies,” Castiel said before they moved into gameplay.
“Yes,” Cas agrees, blunt as ever—didn’t even need a truth spell for that one. “But I also know you’re mad at yourself and that helps me let it go most of the time.”
“Is he for real?” I sputter, thinking that of all the scenarios I had in mind for who Castiel was, this is the last I would expect. He’s wearing business shoes, for God’s sake.
“Hello, Dean,” his soulmate responds.
“Yeah, next time you want to memory wipe your old girlfriend, you might want to think about the fact that she’d already introduced you to her entire family, has a phone with hundreds of pictures of you in it, and--” she grins to see him squirm. “Would probably be curious about all the weird symbols underneath her rugs when it came time to vacuum.”
Misha sighed. “Believe me, I can understand the sentiment.” He quietly regarded Jensen for a moment, letting silence reign for several seconds before saying anything. “But life must go on, doesn’t it,” he said. Rhetorical or not, Jensen didn’t say anything.
The girl in question was working their drinks and among the staff tending to the island – the only other people Cas allowed on his island to be employees hired after some strict screening. Not just for the virus.
“Nope,” Dean stood, shaking his head and crossing his arms. “Frankly speaking, I’m hungry. But I wouldn’t trust either of you to stand in front of the stove right now without setting this place on fire. I’m pretty sure I’d be a better bet. So–”
Cas casually shrugged, but Dean could see right through it. “Bobby’s given you the time off… indefinitely. And you keep complaining about my hygiene – more so than usual, lately. So let’s go somewhere. You’ve always wanted to go to a beach, if I recall correctly, and we could keep each other properly occupied.” He winked salaciously.
, demure he could do, he remembered how to do that, and Cas must’ve picked it up, must’ve picked something up, because he suddenly stepped back into Dean’s space, looking a little more confident even as his eyes squinted, requesting explicit consent – or an explicit denial.
Sam choked out a laugh. “Didn’t work when you were a ghost with corporeal limbs, ain’t gonna work now either.”
Dean grinned. “Sam says thanks!” He called out, just as Cas came back into view. He promptly lost his train of thought, because the fucker was now unbuttoning his shirt, coat and tie gone. He was still wearing an undershirt, but he might as well haven’t been because it was absolutely drenched in sweat that it was transparent, and Dean could see right through it. He gulped.
Probably two days ago.
This thoughts warred with each other again, trying to make Dean focus on something he didn’t want to; there was one prominent way this would end up, and instead of Cas’s hands around his waist, pulling Dean in by the corset, it would be delicately balancing the eyeliner instead…
