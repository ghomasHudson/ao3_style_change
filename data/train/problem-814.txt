“Deeper?” he whispered, pulsing his finger gently at Sherlock’s opening. “Want me to find it?”
“Have you seen Miss Argyle today, Mr. Brodie?” Murdy asked at once.
Sherlock.]
“It wasn’t up to me, really.” Violet said, setting the bottle down on the desk. She half-smiled and turned to the fireplace, kneeling to touch a match to the kindling and logs. “Your grandmother had the place scrubbed and fumigated, obviously; but she never did see the point of redecorating for the hell of it. I never spent long enough here to get around to changing anything, somehow.”
John watched with horror as the man made his way to the top of the stairs; hoping against hope that the clearly dog-tired Duncan was going to go to bed or take a shower. His journey up the stairs was achingly slow, and by the time he reached the top John’s heart was hammering in his chest. Sherlock’s hand was still pressed over his mouth; no longer to silence him but because neither man dared move. They were ill-concealed in the doorway, but moving any further away from the study was not an option.
“You’re
“And I reckon you’ve drawn your own conclusions about the kind of schooldays someone like Sherlock had.” Violet said drily. “I’m not sure they’re anything he’d fancy dwelling on.”
Immediately, the onslaught at the door ceased, and footsteps were heard pounding away down the alley. It seemed like one of the men tripped over a dustbin as he went, given the tumultuous clattering that accompanied the sound of their feet. Sherlock dived back behind the shed and they waited breathlessly for thirty long seconds.
“Oh, I didn’t realise that Violet had a housekeeper; she didn’t say. It’s nice to meet you.” John’s winning smile was obviously not going to get him anywhere, and he let it fade before his face started aching. Margaret nodded and turned back to her plants.
Mycroft didn’t even break eye contact with Patrick; John doubted that he had even noticed that they had vacated their end of the table. Patrick, however, glanced up at him as he passed and nodded at him. John was glad and a little ashamed that Patrick had evidently decided not to hold their earlier conversation in the upstairs corridor against him.
“John, think!” Sherlock ordered impatiently, and John turned reluctantly to watch him wading into the water. His face was tense and he grimaced at the shock of the icy temperature. “There’s every chance at least one of them will need medical attention once they’re clear of the river. You can’t do that if you’re hypothermic too!”
“Mm. It only seemed appropriate to dress like a real Scotsman.” Sherlock informed him, with a slightly feral glint in his eye. “Problem?”
“Um...” John scrambled to think clearly, which was becoming more and more difficult. His blood was roaring in his veins.
She swallowed hard when they came face to face, shifting nervously from one foot to another.
After a terse conversation with emergency services, he dropped the receiver down with a clatter. John had expected the man on the floor to struggle or plead at the sound of Sherlock’s report of an attempted murder at the vicarage. Reverend Duncan merely continued to lie on the floor, his face contorted as he silently wept.
Murdy nodded and headed outside, turning the dark fur collar of her coat up against the cold. Within seconds she disappeared, vanishing into the snow that had begun to fall steadily outside.
He could feel a pair of hands on his shoulders. He didn’t know or care whose they were. Someone was speaking to him urgently. More than one voice now. The sound was blurry; it wasn’t breaking through the horror that was freezing his mind. His eyes were tight shut. He couldn’t risk seeing anything more.
“That is true, how observant of you. None of them to my knowledge are in the WI, though.” Violet smiled sweetly.
“So what brought you to Hilderbogie?” John asked curiously.
“Hiding a habit from his wife?” John asked, peering up at the dusty glass globes of the light overhead. He glanced at Sherlock. “Not that we know anyone who does that sort of thing, obviously. How do you know there are cigarettes up there? Can you see an outline?”
She scrabbled for a pencil in the pocket of her kingfisher blue dress and motioned for Patrick to pass her an abandoned shopping list from the end of the table.
“John”
John was trying to think of something constructive to say but his mind had gone blank, a knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. “Hello, its Molly” said Molly, peeking her head through the door.  Sherlock’s head snapped round to face where Molly’s voice came from.
“My attention” Sherlock drawled, beginning to breathe deeper for a different reason this time. He raised his head and met Johns mouth with his, licking at his lips in an open mouth kiss.
When Sherlock finally stopped coughing his head was down, he raised it slowly, his eyes closed. John said softly “Sherlock, are you okay?” Sherlock’s eyes opened, facing toward John but with no recognition and his face set in a blank expression. “John” he said hoarsely “I can’t see.”
Sherlock did a half smile and disappeared into the kitchen. He emerged carrying a bottle and two cut glass tumblers which he set down on the side table. John had not moved, still stood in the centre of the room, watching Sherlock’s movements.
John allowed the paramedics to shepherd him into the back of the ambulance next to Sherlock on the stretcher, they had assessed he hadn’t broken anything, god knows how, but he was still unconscious. John watched the medics with a sense of detachment as they buzzed around Sherlock and the ambulance sped off. He knew what they were doing but it seemed so odd to see them doing it to Sherlock.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock queried with an air of disinterest. John placed both hands on the back of Sherlock’s chair, causing him to frown, but it wasn’t enough to make him stop his work.
Down the corridor, his pace quickened, left then right turns, to the A&E assessment rooms. On arriving at the admissions desk he saw another familiar face “Molly?” his brow furrowed in confusion. “One of the ambulance team recognised Sherlock” she replied quickly. “John, he’ll be ok, they are assessing him now.” He looked into her eyes but the reassurance didn’t match the strain in them. He fixed her gaze “Where is he?” Molly took a deep breath “John just wait, you know how this works, you can’t be in there, you know you can’t”. John felt pressure building up inside him, the events of the last hour caught up with him in that moment and he felt his legs go from underneath him.
“Do you give up?” John offered. Sherlock could hardly breathe let alone talk so John ceased his attack momentarily.
John was in a place he’d never been. He was aware he didn’t mind where he was. It was peaceful. Sherlock was there.  He was near. John knew, in reality, it was only minutes since the bullet pierced him, sheared its way through his flesh and bone. Come to rest in his chest, close to his heart. In this place there was no concept of time, only love. His love was close but so far, the same as always, and now would be forever.
What would his mind do to itself without the ability to observe and deduce that which others could not? John thought “We’ve seen what he’s like when he doesn’t have a case, how will he cope with the knowledge there might never be another?” For everything that had gone on, Sherlock dying, Sherlock not being dead, John marrying Mary, Mary shooting Sherlock, there were issues between them that had made their relationship strained but John still knew that without Sherlock he might never have made it out of his small, plain, dark flat and back into the real world. He felt a very strong sense of duty that he owed it to Sherlock to return the favour.
The luminous lights in Sherlock’s hospital room meant that is was still bright even when John closed his eyes, John was dog tired. He had been sat by Sherlock for about ten hours now. He had vowed he wouldn’t sleep. The doctors had said there was no apparent damage to Sherlock from the assessments they performed but that they would need him to wake up to confirm that. A blow to the front of the head was still a serious injury.
John took a deep breath in, exhaled slowly, folded his paper and stood up. He took a moment to observe Sherlock, this had gone on too long, he was obsessing over nothing, he needed to relax.
Sherlock dropped his keys and removed his gloves, placing them gently to his side. In the dim room John watched, the light from the lamp highlighted this mans profile, the high cheekbones, his eyelashes and his lips, oh god, those lips! Johns fingers brushed his own lips with the memory of just a short while ago, those lips against his.
going to need help. However long this lasts you are going to need some help adjusting to this, taking things easy. I can take some time off work; I’ll come and stay at Baker Street.” Sherlock’s head dropped “I suppose you’re right” he said sulkily. “Sherlock” John said sternly, and then he stopped. This wasn’t like him; there was no fight in him. “I know this is hard” John went on a little more softly “I’m just asking you not to make this more difficult than it has to be. I don’t mind helping, when you get home in more familiar surroundings you might feel better, you’ll see.” John immediately regretted the end of his sentence and his face would have given him away if Sherlock could have seen it.
Physically Sherlock looked much better. The bandage round his head had been replaced with a large plaster and he had more colour in his cheeks, well, as much as he ever did, thought John, it was his eyes that made John sad. Sherlock’s eyes usually so busy, darting about, noticing everything, were lifeless. There was usually an alertness in them, alluding to the monstrous intelligence in the brain behind but the fire was gone, replaced by a still, sea blue tranquillity of nothing.
“Absolutely not, I’m doing it again” Sherlock snapped back and began emptying all the bottles.
The weight of Sherlock pressing down on John was a heavenly sensation, John felt simultaneously small and dominated, yet secure and trusting of Sherlock, that he knew what he was doing, for the first time in a long time he felt safe enough to completely let go. He closed his eyes as and felt a jolt of pleasure as Sherlock tugged this way and that to remove his belt, he was completely hard now and craving touch which Sherlock did not immediately provide as he removed Johns jeans. Sat back on his heels on the floor, Sherlock leaned in, placing his hand on Johns knee, he softly stroked Johns inner thigh, placing kisses behind, as it slowly worked its way up.
John was shot, that’s all he knew. He’d been here before, shot that is. The disconnection was was familiar, the feeling of intense pain mixed with a sensation of not actually being present for it, not acknowledging his blood as it flowed from him but feeling the warmth flood out too. There was nothing, no future, no life. Just black.
John had known this was coming, yet it didn’t make it any easier, he couldn’t say anything that would make this better. He did understand, despite what Sherlock thought, he sat forward and placed his hand on Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock looked up at John and he could see that Sherlock’s eyes were wet with tears.
“Will you be needing that second room?”
John changed his focus for a moment  from the sleeping Sherlock to his own self, His legs, his body, his hands, all still, quiet, calm. The panic bloomed, first in his stomach, but with each realisation it shot further up his spine, until he had one sensation filling his entire being. It burned. Johns eyes darted round the room then fixed back on Sherlock, his heart stopped. Sherlock was sat up and looking back at him. The room went black, John was lost,
John stopped rubbing his face and slowly slid his hands down his face and peered at Sherlock. “Go on”
As he entered a civilian life, in that small, plain, dark flat the strong structure of routine and purpose had melted away. His mind had numbed, inside a voice told him his purpose no longer existed, he had no use and adrenaline became a long distant memory replaced with a black space, a never-ending stillness. The most frightening part was that John knew where that had taken him, to the very edge of life.
“John”
“Of course in that case, the patient never recovered fully…” Molly’s voice petered out as John walked in.
“Sherlock” his voice was firm.
“Here we go” John interrupted before Sherlock could reply. Molly stared at the floor.
“John”
The shock of the cold leather making contact with Johns back caused him to arch and gasp, Sherlock used the gap to reach around Johns back, his hand grazing over the dappled and uneven scar on Johns shoulder before grasping his strong back. They moved together, chests becoming moist, tongues licked, mouths sucking, desperately trying to get even closer. The weight of Sherlock and the friction moving over his jeans caused Johns prick to stiffen and his head to swim.
“It’s a thought, its, its, arrrgh, its black”
“Can you ignore me if I’m here?” John said with a low voice, holding back the volume but not the frustration. He knew Sherlock couldn’t see him but he would be able to hear his breath he was so close. John swallowed, “Talk to me”
“Help how? Can you see for me, are you going to be my guide dog John? One bark for yes, two for no,” Sherlock mocked, “it’s my life John, its who I am”
“Drink?” Sherlock queried
“No” John replied. They paused still panting, Johns mind raced with thoughts but one fought through, the one that was put out that he wasn’t kissing Sherlock anymore, the one that missed the electric heat of excitement in his belly. He realised this was what he’d wanted, since yesterday, since the chase after the taxi.
John smiled at Molly and she turned to go down the stairs. That hadn’t gone too badly, Sherlock had behaved himself, even seemed to brighten up a bit from earlier. John breathed in brusquely through his nose and went back into the flat. Any sense of relief he felt though was short lived. As he entered the living room Sherlock was slumped back in his chair again, eyes closed and fingers pressed against his temples. Anger pricked the top of John’s chest, but he went about tidying the tea up.
When they arrived at the hospital they were greeted by Lestrade, approaching John with a concerned expression. “John” said Lestrade, “Huh” replied John, it was good to see a familiar face but he was concentrating on where Sherlock was being wheeled, he didn’t slow down. “John, what were you two doing? John felt his concentration slipping, his mind started to work out what to say. “What, uh, Sherlock, he… Mycroft” his words tumbled out. Lestrade held up his hands, “All right, all right calm down John” John noticed Sherlock go around a corner. “I have to…I need…” Involuntarily, he turned and followed the direction Sherlock had gone, he heard Lestrade shouting after him but his feet moved him away.
They lay in the chair as their breathing slowed, Sherlock gently stroking Johns chest as the light began to filter through the slightly parted curtains. Sherlock, after some time, slowly drew a breath and sat up, looking John full in the eye
“Right, okay” Sherlock didn’t follow on so John thought about it for a second, he had a million questions but he knew if he pushed Sherlock too hard he would shut down again, “Why, all this time, what are you doing?”
“There’s nothing to talk about John. Nothing at all”
“I’ve been…… in my mind palace,” he said eventually
“Look, we have only just met, we don’t...” Sherlock started, looking down, John interrupted,
Sherlock sat next to John in the stairwell. His face close to Johns ear, not thinking of anything but John. Holding him close, wanting nothing but to see his dark blue eyes open once more.  The realisation though, so fresh in his mind, of love, so strong and fading almost as soon as it had been born.
“Don’t worry John, I don’t mind helping. If you need a break anytime just let me know.”
John felt fuzzy, he’d been trying to sleep in a visitor’s chair for about an hour, the wood from the armrests was digging into his side and he had a vicious burn down the left side of his neck where he was leaning over, cheek resting on his knuckles on his right hand.
As John gave up trying to sleep and re-adjusted himself in his chair he noticed you could actually see tiny blue veins all over Sherlock’s chest, like a map they joined into each other like roads. As he stared his eyes blurred in and out of focus. John allowed his gaze to travel up Sherlock’s chest, it was a rare sight a still Sherlock and he became intrigued. His chest was smooth, and although Sherlock was slight, he was defined, sinewy muscle lain over delicate bone.
When he went back in Sherlock was stood in his coat, waiting by the bed “Ah, finished talking about me then, come on John we haven’t got all day” and he put his hand out expectantly. John took a deep breath; this was definitely going to be a challenge.
“John, please”
“There we go then!” As Mrs Hudson poured out the tea her voice was far too high pitched. “Oh, I’ve got some biscuits downstairs, I’ll go and fetch them” and she hurried out the room. “She might not make it back upstairs,” Sherlock remarked from his chair, his voice low, without expression.  John’s lack of reply signalled confusion so Sherlock went on “with that level of pitch she’ll be short of air” he said flatly. “She’s just worried about you Sherlock” “I know, that’s the problem, you all reek of it.” He added a flick of his hand to illustrate his point. John pursed his lips and let that one go.
“Tea Molly?”
“John!”
John busied himself in the kitchen boiling the kettle, he kept an eye on how it was going, he had asked Molly to come, she had popped in a couple of times while Sherlock was in hospital and even though she had a terrible habit of saying the wrong thing sometimes, John had to admit he was struggling, he didn’t know how to help Sherlock, he wanted to see how someone else did. He carried the tea back through on a tray.
“It’s not any of them John” John rolled his eyes and picked up his paper again,
John backed away and dropped onto his chair behind him, he rubbed his face and leaned back
“I brought grapes, ah, I don’t know why?”
Closer but almost a whisper now.
It was dark when the ambulance arrived, no sign of the gang member’s, they must have continued their escape. John waited with Sherlock in the dark till he heard the sirens and went out to alert them to where they were. As they arrived John went into shut down, it was too similar to the scene on the floor outside Bart’s. To see Sherlock so still, people crowded round him, he knew he wasn’t dead this time but he so wished he would come round so the heaviness in the pit of his stomach would subside.
They sat inches apart, bare chested and breathing heavily. Sherlock pressed his head gently against Johns forehead.
Molly shuffled into the room and placed the grapes on Johns side table. She glanced at John and shook her hand in an up or down motion, mouthing how is he at the same time.
When Sherlock visited the first hotel room, John could see his mood change in an instant, he knew Sherlock, not in the same way Sherlock could read people, read him, but he sensed him. Sherlock hadn’t actually banked on this case being dangerous. He had deduced the involvement of a security company, extortion of some kind,  best passed on to Scotland Yard, anything to keep Mycroft off his back, he couldn’t focus lately.
“My thoughts exactly” a half smile danced across his lips, "I never thought you'd agree"
That noise.
“John, John.....no....argh!!!” Sherlock said in between bouts of giggling, John had him down on the floor now, straddling him. He pinned both Sherlock’s hands down with one of his, still managing to torment him with the other.
A gentle short kiss, enough to take his breath before it was gone. A second, seeming an age passed, another kiss, this one stayed, it moved, John responded, his frozen body becoming warm and pliable in Sherlock’s hands. All hesitation floated away as John allowed himself to be present, not thinking but feeling, the hand at his side, a gentle pressure moving around his back, the upturned thumb stroking.
“Cataloguing, filing, storing, sorting, I can’t afford to lose anything, I have a bank of information to preserve.” This all came out rapidly, Sherlock, breathing deeply afterwards.
“Yes, and thank you Molly, it’s been nice to see a different face.”
At Johns words Sherlock turned his head to face him, John turned his face upwards, quite unconsciously licking his lips, and a steely determination in his eyes.
“John”
“John”
Sherlock smiled,
Sherlocks eyes were pleading. This was the first time he had made eye contact with John since the shooting, Johns eyes had been closed, hiding him from Sherlock, and now there he was again, his John. The noise of the gunshot had been a starting pistol for the new thoughts flooding Sherlock’s brain. It had brought into sharp focus things that had been floating around, undiscovered but he had been aware of their presence.
“Thank you kindly, Inspector. I must say, this evening has provided us with a bountiful supply of unexpected guests. I do hope we’re not keeping you from anything - this
“The question is, though-“ John wondered aloud, “-should the other poisoning victims expect a similar incident?”
“Sherlock... she didn’t do it, did she?”
bad headache locked up in there. I’ll bet she’s just
They paused next to the fancy wrought iron gate, and took in the pink chintz curtains at the windows and the small ceramic squirrels on the doorstep. Although the tiny front garden was thickly blanketed in snow like all the others, it gave off the impression of excruciating tidiness. A dainty wooden bird table stood at the precise centre of the lawn, surrounded by garden gnomes that were so carefully arranged they looked almost like a battalion. Rather incongruously, there was a thick band of barbed wire wrapped around the base of the bird table, wound so thickly it looked almost like a wreath.
!” as John’s teeth gently grazed his sharp collarbone, there wasn’t just a surge in arousal; there was also the realisation that Sherlock felt safe in John’s arms. That the ways in which John touched him only brought pleasure, and didn’t make Sherlock revisit fear.
Most people tended to recoil slightly when Sherlock loomed over them or sat next to them. Admittedly, a lot of the time his goal was to unsettle or intimidate them. But John had seen even Lestrade take a hasty step back when Sherlock brushed against his arm.
“I’ve had it a little while now.” Mackie said vaguely, taking a deep swig of his tea. “Maybe around a month? What’s all this about, anyhow?”
It wasn’t that he was scared of Mycroft. It was more that he didn’t trust himself not to punch the man in the face if he started making snide comments about whatever it was that was happening between Sherlock and himself.
“I’m not even wearing a jumper today!”
He froze suddenly, as he caught sight of a blurry smear in the snow a few feet away. The flakes were continuing to fall, creating another layer of perfect white in all directions. But the darkness wasn’t yet obscured; it was only gradually fading out of sight. John leapt towards it, digging into the snow with his gloved hands. There was a shallow impression in the snow, outlined by a reddish halo. A footprint, stained with blood. Another, a few feet away.
“So sorry, Agnes; I swear we’re nearly finished. It’s his eighth attempt; he’ll have to get the hang of it soon…”
To John’s great relief, both Violet and Patrick decided to go to bed almost immediately after they had waved goodbye to Mr. Brodie on the steps. While Violet looked genuinely tired from all the dancing, Patrick seemed eager to be alone and he politely refused her yawning offer of a nightcap in the drawing room. He disappeared swiftly in the direction of his bedroom, his footsteps quietly echoing on the stone floor.
Bit not good.
“When do you think that you can open up again?” John asked, looking around.
(The important thing to do right now was to avoid saying things like: ‘Calm down, Sherlock’, or ‘Cheer up, Sherlock’. ‘What are you thinking, Sherlock?’ Christ. Avoid that one at all costs.)
He felt Sherlock nodding against the top of his head and he smiled; his stomach tightening in anticipation and his cock twitching in the hot crevice between Sherlock’s thighs.
To his great relief, John noticed that George was still breathing. Violet had struck him squarely on the crown of his head and while John was sure (and very pleased) that the blow must have hurt like hell he doubted that George would be seriously affected by it. He lay propped against the doors of the Aga, dribbling gently down his front. He looked awful, with the combination of the residual bruising across his nose and eye, and the split skin on his cheek where John had punched him. Within minutes he would start developing an impressive swelling on the top of his head.
“Mm. Yes. The fabric was pulled taut from the backrest of the bench and across the seat, designed to drape around her as she lay down. She always complained about the pose; said the twist to her torso hurt her back. Hilary usually nudged her into position, held her shoulders down as Sandra got her legs into the right position. The fact that the fabric was pulled across the bench must have hidden the knife perfectly.” Violet glared at the photographs and rubbed her face fretfully. “Christ, everything’s such a bloody mess. Maybe Phyllis knows about the cut. I’ll ask her later. Do you think it’s important?”
“I don’t do cooking,” Mrs. Hudson was saying firmly. “I’m going to look up my old friends and I’m going to be busy with my own life. No cleaning, either. I’m going to be a landlady, not a housekeeper. I suppose I might drop up a scone or two, now and again. If you’re good.”
John’s only surprised that Sherlock’s taken so long to start dissecting this part of him.
, sort of thing…”
Sherlock stared at him and blinked rapidly. “Hm. No, shouldn’t think so. Not beyond the realm of possibility, because that woman could have been the next Mussolini if she set her mind to it. No, there’s something else worrying me. Something else altogether.”
“I don’t mean to stare at him, John.” Patrick said quietly. “I’m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable; I can tell that it does.”
It was nearly half past six by the time John, Sherlock and Murdy rounded the bend in the path and caught sight of the lit windows of Hilderbogie House. Murdy’s ill-concealed grin and light step caused John to smile in turn; the girl laughed out loud when Sherlock tripped over a snow-covered tree root. The sound was startlingly loud, clear as a bell and John couldn’t help staring when it erupted from her slight frame.
“Sherlock, what is it? Tell me, right now.” John hissed. Sherlock shook his head rapidly and beckoned frantically.
Sherlock had been listening to this exchange with interest, a faint curve to the corner of his mouth as he watched John become increasingly embarrassed. He cleared his throat quietly and leant in.
“Goodness, touchy chap aren’t you? Off you pop and pay your
“Target practice, Miss Boorman?” Sherlock inquired, approaching her to inspect her gun with interest. John followed at his heels, keeping a sharp eye on the double-barrelled gun.
“It doesn’t matter. I was wrong about him. Should have known better, really.” Sherlock shrugged one bony shoulder and flicked some ash a little too forcefully over the side of the boat. “You’d think that I would know better by now.”
“Oh, we’re all family here,
“I’m not!” John protested, manfully struggling to stop grinning. “It’s… um… idle curiosity. I’ll just go and er, I’ll just go and have a quick wash.”
(More like Sherlock’s accent. Or indeed even have too many people
“The brand is nothing special.” Sherlock said, ignoring John. He grabbed the dark wooden desk chair and pulled it into the centre of the room.  He donned his leather gloves before leaping up on the seat. “Lambert and Butler, if I’m not mistaken.”
“You can’t come in.” he said hoarsely. “You… no. No. I will give you ten bloody minutes of my time and then you need to leave. Wait here, I need to get dressed.”
“Don’t worry.” Griz said quietly, nudging him back towards the horses head. “He’s just saying hello.”
“Ah.” Menzies said in a small voice. “I see.”
“But… it wasn’t my
” Sherlock’s voice was soft, seductive but with the faintest hint of unease.
of the man.
“That’s alright. Here, have this.” John unearthed a thankfully clean handkerchief from his pocket, realising after he had given it to her that it was one of Sherlock’s.
“Do you have a warrant?” Murdy asked suddenly, from behind John. She dug the toe of her boot mulishly into the snow. Everyone turned to look at her, but she didn’t raise her eyes from the snow. “I mean, they need a warrant don’t they? It’s in Miss Vernet’s house.”
went down well.”
, though. In more ways than one. Isn’t it?” George asked loudly.
“Perspicacious git.” Violet said fondly, taking his arm and leading them through the arch she had appeared from. “They’re not quite done yet, though. I had an unexpected visitor and we got chatting.” John followed them down the vaulted stone corridor towards what must have been the old servants’ wing. Pushing open a green baize door, Violet led the way down a short spiral staircase and into a cavernous kitchen that couldn’t have changed much since Victorian times. Gleaming copper pans hung from a high rack over the massive scarred wooden kitchen table, and complicated ironwork surrounded the wide fireplace.
trying to steal my blogger.” Sherlock muttered darkly, curling up against John’s bare shins.
injured. She said that she was only being honest, that she had just been concerned for Phyllis. Basil, of course, said that Phyllis and Katy had simply misunderstood Hilary’s good intentions. I’d had enough at this point, and left. Patrick came with me into the library.”
“Yes, here I am.” John affirmed, drily. “I seem to be the only one in this house who seems to think that sleeping past half eight during the holidays isn’t a great crime.”
“She’ll be up in her rooms, I reckon. Third floor. Tell her I’ll do the dinner again tonight if she’s not up to it.”
around me and I began to perspire very badly.” She looked a little embarrassed at this, and hastily continued. “My mouth was dreadfully dry, so I tried to get up to get a glass of water but my silly legs didn’t seem to move properly. I suppose I fell on the floor at that point, but I really can’t remember what happened next. I don’t remember anything at all, really, until the next day when I woke up here in hospital.”
“He’s been spying on the grocery?” he wondered aloud. “Oh, no. Hang on. Oh! Oh, ugh.”
“You don’t… mind?” Sherlock frowned a little, looking down at him.
“Mr. Jameson? My name is Sherlock Holmes; may we speak with you?”
“So it’s not just Phyllis?” John asked.
“Blimey!” Violet remarked, taking John’s arm and joining him in his study of Murdy. “That was bloody
Her tone was almost conversational, but something in her eyes frightened John in a way that he would have been unable to put into words. Violet was intent, bending over Mary and looking into her watering eyes unblinkingly. He had always been aware that Violet had dark corners. Her breezy, cheerful, occasionally scatty personality was something that had always charmed him. But on occasion, he had wondered just how much of it was truly
“Revolting worms!” a familiar voice cried, and Violet barrelled from a stone arch in the corner of the room, a delighted smile setting her freckled face alight.
“Right.” Violet’s business-like tone finally cut through his thoughts. He looked up to see her carefully pulling several pages from the book of maps, the sound of tearing paper startlingly loud. Even Mycroft looked faintly horrified at the sight, but Violet merely shrugged grimly and held out a few sheets of paper to him. “Needs must. It weighs a ton and I’ll mend it later. John, you and Mycroft are going to head west – there’s a river and waterfall in that direction. He’ll need water by now so there’s a good chance he’ll have headed that way. Anthea and I are going to head towards the pass that leads to Invergordon. It’s also possible he’ll have tried to strike ahead and get to the nearest village on the other side of the valley.”
Patrick was also watching Sherlock with more interest than should really have been necessary, John thought. Admittedly, it was still a strange thing to watch him eat with such greedy enthusiasm. But that was because John knew that prior to their arrival Sherlock had eaten approximately four meals over the space of a week. Ok, maybe five if he counted the cheese and pickle sandwich he had shoved in Sherlock’s coat pocket when he was on his way out the door on Tuesday morning. (John had accompanied the sandwich with a warning glare, but for all he knew a passing duck or a member of the homeless network had eaten it.)
He turned, and stared blearily into Violet’s face. “I would have done it. I wanted to.”
Violet shook her head sharply. “John, it’s not the collections. I very much doubt I’d be convicted of anything. And even if I was, it would be a case of paying a fairly large fine; but nothing too terrible.” She sighed. “I mean, fair enough. I can’t really afford the scandal. If it becomes known that I’m involved in any kind of theft of artefact, that’s the end of me. Professionally, I mean – no archival institution would come near me. But that’s not the worst of it, not by a mile. Mycroft – he knows things about me. I don’t know how he knows all of it, but he does….” She trailed off and swallowed, blinking hard. “John, there are people out there who would dearly love to know where I am. And Mycroft knows who they are, and how to get in touch with them. He informed me of this years ago, after the accident. Being the idiot I am, I thought that surely - I mean after nearly twenty years! - it wouldn’t do any harm to get back in touch with Sherlock. But I got
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at Mr. Antonelli, who sighed and took off his glasses to polish them on the corner of the blanket around his shoulders.
As John’s mind began spiralling he heard Sherlock cry out.
“There’s nothing to talk about” Sherlock said quietly “Because there’s nothing John.”
“Molly’s coming to see us.” John chirped to Sherlock. Sherlock was sat, well slumped, in his chair with his eyes shut. John didn’t know whether he was asleep or simply being ignorant, he had taken to doing this a lot lately, he could sit completely still for hours, eyes gently closed, John thought perhaps if he sat with his eyes closed he could pretend it was his choice that he couldn’t see anything. It was early days yet, John had tried a couple of times asking if he wanted to go out but Sherlock hadn’t replied.
“Please sit down Molly” Sherlock gestured her to sit in Johns chair; John allowed himself a little smile.
John started towards Sherlock; in front of him in three strides he placed his hands on the arms of his chair. Sherlock, sensing the sudden proximity, opened his eyes.
Sherlock had been in hospital for three days, now he was being discharged but there was little joy to be had. A flurry of tests and long periods of waiting had given no answers as to why Sherlock couldn’t see. John knew that a blow to the head could cause swelling of the brain, resulting in blindness; he had seen it in Afghanistan. He also knew the effects can vary in severity and length, these are the sterile sentences he had delivered to soldiers relatives himself, not ever really giving thought to the anguish that ambiguity also gave.
John gathered together the leaflets the discharge nurse had given them, Sherlock had barely been listening it seemed when she was there. John caught her outside and asked her advice on the best way to support Sherlock; she said many people go through a range of stages when dealing with sight loss, denial, grief and anger being common. However this was Sherlock, this was a different breed altogether. John didn’t mention this to her, and thanked her for the advice.
Sherlock softly closed the door to 221b with a click, it was late now, in the early hours. John stood in the middle of the room, his eyes fixed on Sherlocks back; his long coat sweeping down. John realised his whole body was tense and, as Sherlock turned to face him, his breath hitched when Sherlock met his eye.
He knew he had been distracted lately, he couldn’t have told you why he felt the need to pursue the hotel case, Mycrofts case was at least an eight, but something had told him not to help, not to comply – not  that this was unheard of, anything to annoy his brother. The reason for his hesitation was now forefront in his mind, the real reason he hadn’t wanted to take Mycrofts case, he would have had to go abroad, go away to another place, away from John.
“Sherlock, take it easy, you are in a hospital” John kept his voice low and calm so as not to startle Sherlock. “Sherlock” John coaxed, willing him into consciousness. Sherlock finally opened his eyes and John saw his pale blue iris move slowly from side to side, then quicker. Sherlock began to try to sit up, panic stricken across his face, then a cough caught in his throat, John realised his throat must be dry and hurriedly poured a cup of water and brought it to his mouth.
Nothing else with John went as planned; why should this?
trying to chat you up, even though I denied it right afterwards."
"Good. I think so too."
John is wide-eyed and already reaching for the notecards, but at the last moment his hands merely overlap Sherlock's fingers a bit, not taking away or taking over.
("Because I love you. Because I'm
"Because you were a shock," Mycroft murmurs.
boyfriend.”
And stared at him some more.
The king to whom all these outrageous obeisances are being paid lounges poolside with a humble IPA in his hand, looking more relaxed than Greg's ever seen him. There's even a sleepy sort of smile on the man's face that takes years off of him and almost tempts Greg to take a surreptitious photo.
Sherlock it's me.
Other requests are a bit too complicated to be left to time and serendipity.
John hums and nuzzles in closer.
Here he stops, and sets down the pen. He rubs his hand, surprised to find that he's gone on somewhat of a sentimental spree toward the end, spending less time carefully composing and instead, letting the ink put form to the message as it welled up and out of his heart.
Finally…a single nod, and then Sherlock’s face remained dropped low. Another tear pinged softly off the glass.
A hiccup and cautious nod. John breathed in, breathed out, and then sucked in another breath.
, John. He knows it'll only take me a few hours at the most to disable the security measures. Once I have access to the internet and a means to communicate with whomever I wish, what would be the point of continuing to restrict me to the upper floors? Tyranny! Petty, fatuous tyranny!"
John’s an utter arsehole of a boss. Inhumane. Inhuman. A monster. The devil himself. He knows it, and has heard it confirmed behind his back many a time. It’s not surprising, really. A miserable childhood of neglect and abuse battling to see which could do the most damage had been followed by a decade of high-pressure schooling and a soul-crushing introduction to corporate life. The only interruption to this ladder-climbing had been a short stint in the military where the last lingering bits of his idealism had been obliterated. By the time he’d clawed his way to the very pinnacle of his industry he’d had literal blood on his hands, a trail of metaphorical bodies behind him, and the only thing keeping him from stepping out one of the windows of his entire-top-floor office had been the sickening thought that his father would sneer at him from the pits of hell for giving up.
He heard the door close quietly and a second later the sound of Sherlock’s feet on the stairs.
“What’s this?” John asked, perplexed. He sat down on the edge of the unmade bed and ran his fingers across the neatly wrapped rectangular object.
“Well is the stammer real, at least?” John asked, rolling his eyes.
John opened his mouth to utter the usual vague contradictions, then closed it again. Because Sherlock did have him. He was always going to come looking for the daft git, because that was what they did. And he knew that Sherlock would always come and find him, no matter what.
She led the way towards the taxi rank, still holding Sherlock’s unresisting hand. They certainly made a striking pair, and more than one person on the platform did a double take. John wondered if dramatic coats were a Holmes family trait that Violet had adopted when she had married Sherrinford, before he picked up his bag and followed them through the crowds.
Sherlock looked down at him curiously, a faint smile on the corners of his mouth. “Well, I must say that the delivery times for coffee in this establishment are
“Of course not, old thing.” Violet said, getting to her feet. “Come along; I’ll show you where you’re sleeping. It’s on the second floor; quite a nice room really as long as you don’t look too closely at the bloodcurdling hunting prints or the rather grisly portrait of the Duke of Buccleuch in the lav. Back in a mo, fiends.”
“Well I suspect that you can’t get out either.” he forced himself to reply, after taking a deep breath. “I very much doubt that you would choose to stay in the wreckage of a car that is clearly going to catch fire shortly.”
“I suppose not. I imagine quite a lot of your revenue comes from off-license sales, doesn’t it?” Sherlock asked, rather too innocently John thought.
“Damned if I know. Nice choice of seat, incidentally.” Mary smiled grimly. “Are you over there because you’re going to sit back and let someone else do your dirty work? Or are you trying to resist joining in?”
He pointed at the rapidly disappearing tracks; the trails of blood in the snow. Her hand tightened on his arm as she took in the scene.
Sherlock cautiously prodded the parcel with his outstretched finger. It slipped innocuously along the stair where it sat. He pushed it back along to the other side again, with a little more confidence.
of who I was before I came to Scotland, Mycroft. But I was desperate and scared a lot of the time. When I came to the UK, I was trying to make a fresh start. Meeting your brother was the best thing that had happened to me in years. Possibly ever. I know you think I was a bad influence on him, and you know, maybe I was. A bit. But I didn’t mean to be.”
“Yes, John?” That was it. Probably nobody else would pick up on it, but John knew that face. That face was
Sherlock shook his head sorrowfully at this gross display of naiveté.
“But revenge on
John slowly inched a little deeper into the cooling water, and slipped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, resting his chin on Sherlock’s shoulder. He laid a hand on Sherlock’s chest, and could feel the mans heart beating far too quickly beneath his palm.
“The risk was
“Don’t come.” Patrick said again, a little more insistently. “I’ll… be fine. Find him. Then… please. Come and find me.”
That night brought even more snow, and when John opened the curtains of Sherlock’s old room the next morning, the landscape outside was thickly blanketed in white. The sky was deep grey over the misty hills across the river, filled with the heavy promise of more to come.
“Get the milk, Sherlock – it’s in the fridge in the larder,” Violet ordered lazily. Sherlock looked mildly affronted, until she added “Get the cake tin from in there, too. I made a Victoria sandwich yesterday.”
“Sherlock, I really think its about time you saw someone about this, someone who can help with what your feeling, its okay, its normal........ please” Sherlock looked up,
John instinctively reached his arms around Sherlock’s waist, travelling hands up his back, his flat palm and outstretched fingers caressing the tight muscle over Sherlock’s shirt. Sherlock broke the kiss with a gasp, surprise at Johns eager response perhaps but the pause was not long as John kissed the exposed skin at the top of Sherlock’s shirt, his short kisses becoming more needy as they trailed up, reaching his chin Sherlock turned his head back down to meet Johns hungry mouth.
John broke his mouth away with a low moan, Sherlock took the opportunity to sit up on Johns stretched out body, knees straddling him he sat up high, looking down on John who’s blissed out expression told Sherlock all he needed to know. Sherlock placed both palms on Johns chest and began stroking, slowly, John looked up, Sherlock held his gaze. John could tell Sherlock was moving down, teasing a fiery trail towards his belt. When his fingertips reached the boundary of Johns waist he danced across it, his head was cocked to one side and he had a playful expression on his face. He bit the side of his lip just as his first finger dipped below Johns belt line, it felt like an explosion in Johns mind which kept firing each time a new sweep was taken.
“What do I do John? I’m driving myself insane, my mind palace is shrinking, I can’t stay there, it’s getting harder.”
John got it straight away, of course, Sherlock prized his knowledge highly, his power of observation allowed him to compile his mind palace, he would want to preserve as much of it as he could………because there wouldn’t be any more… John looked at his friend; he looked into his eyes, and again was struck by the lack of expression, of recognition. “Sherlock, I get it….”
This kiss was deep, mouths open, tongues meeting. Sherlock’s coat dropped to the floor under Johns instruction, hands free to explore the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck. As they kissed Sherlock’s clever fingers began unbuttoning, slowly downwards, till he reached Johns belt. John felt the gentle tug of his shirt being pulled out of his trousers before the searing heat of Sherlock’s hands made contact with his bare skin.
He couldn’t see Sherlock but he knew he was there. The warmth in his chest returned and he was calm again.
“Biscuits!!” a sonic level Mrs Hudson appeared, when she scanned the room and found no Sherlock she looked towards John with concern. John nodded his head toward his room. She studied his face for a moment “Oh,” she paused, he must have looked strung out. “We’ll get him right John” Mrs Hudson placed her hand on Johns forearm and gave a gentle squeeze. He looked into her eyes and found some comfort there.
“Doesn't look like it”
“I need drugs John, it’s the only way.”
The thing was he had had a lot of time to consider what might be going on in Sherlock’s head, and without having any input from Sherlock, Johns mind was filling in the blanks. He had been in a similar situation himself, when he came back wounded from Afghanistan. His life was the army; he had immersed himself in it so much he ate, breathed and slept its routines and systems. His mind was finely attuned to the tasks at hand, he didn’t have to think about anything outside of the army, he had deep trust in his unit and close companionships with his fellow soldiers. When he was in hospital he didn’t really consider what it would be like to be outside of that, he expected that the doctors were going to tell him he could be reinstated after his recovery, the recovery that never came.
Sherlock sat up suddenly, leaning forward, seeming all at once agitated,
“No” Sherlock shouted “No, you don’t John, I…I” Sherlock dropped his head and began massaging his temples; his finger ends wrinkling the skin as he pushed hard.
After a moments thought, John strolled over to the frantic Sherlock, who was preoccupied refilling tiny vials with some liquid. He stood still, waiting, while Sherlock continued.
John leaned over to look closer, his tiredness numbing the sensation that this was possibly an invasion of Sherlock’s personal space. As he watched Sherlock’s pulse thrum at his neck he noticed Sherlock’s eyelid flicker. “Sherlock?” John watched intently, scared to move in case he scared it away. “Sherlock” John gently encouraged him and as he said his name Sherlock’s eyes moved underneath the still closed lids and he began to draw a breath through his nostrils. Sherlock’s eyebrows knitted together as John imagined the pain in his head filtering through.
Sherlock stared deep into Johns eyes for the longest time before he felt a warmth at his side, looking down Sherlock’s hand rested gently on his middle, the soft part, thumb raised, pointing up. John closed his eyes and drew breath sharply through his nose. He felt Sherlock’s other hand cup his face and the proximity of him, close, warm breath, every vein inside of him singing with anticipation. Gently his face was tipped upwards and again a kiss landed on his mouth.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
“It doesn’t matter” he whispered and closed his eyes, tilting his head sidewards to meet Sherlock’s lips, John slowly scraped his bottom lip over Sherlock’s, as if begging to be let in. Sherlock hesitated briefly before consenting, opening his mouth just a little, allowing John to push further with his tongue, over the teeth and in before pushing back, encouraging John to lay back in the chair.
“Dinner?”  “What?”
“Dinner, what shall we have? Sherlock didn’t answer. “Beans then? I’ll go when Mrs Hudson gets back. Would you like me to run you a bath?” Sherlock stood up and headed for the kitchen. His leg caught the edge of Johns chair and he stumbled but did not fall. “Sherlock.” He put his arm out to feel for the wall and began to make his way along the kitchen side. John started to follow him but thought better of it, he hadn’t found the right time to talk properly to Sherlock about how he was feeling in all this. Sherlock made it to his bedroom, entered and the door closed slowly behind him. John took this as a clear signal that he wished to be left alone.
“Stop this Sherlock” John hesitated, still not wanting to push Sherlock, and then found his resolve.
He was relieved of his shirt, tossed aside by Sherlock, before being gently walked backwards till he reached the dark green leather chair, his knees bent and he sat down, Sherlock dropped to his knees, pulled his shirt over his head in one swift move and leaned in towards John, placing himself between Johns open thighs.
“Sherlock??”
They were in East London, Docklands area, somewhere near the airport; John was running across an open wasteland. The light was fading as the sense of panic was rising in the back of Johns mind. They were running after a group of Eastern European criminals which they barged in on trading political information with a suspected double agent of Mycroft’s. The gang scarpered on discovery but Sherlock had given chase and that’s where they were now, running, god knows where, it could be straight into their set up, with weapons and who knows what…
John leant into Sherlock, who was staring at the gathering in fascination and some level of private amusement. “Sherlock, if you know what the hell is going on, feel free to tell me at any point.”
“Of course.” Sherlock somehow sensed that John needed some help manoeuvring himself out of his chair and was on his feet in a trice, gripping his arm.
Greg added, rather unnecessarily John thought.
John gave a small laugh, and skidded on a patch of ice between two looming headstones. He grabbed hold of one of them with his free hand and paused, and taking in their surroundings. The churchyard was now almost entirely silent, becoming even more thickly blanketed in snow. The stained glass windows of the hall had dimmed, leaving the enclosure lit mainly by the dying light of the candle lanterns dotted here and there in the snow.
“Are you alright, John? Sherlock didn’t go into details, but I gathered that Freddie... that it wasn’t...” she closed her eyes and swallowed hard. “It wasn’t good.”
“Mm. It was really bloody good, too.” Violet sighed, wriggling her stockinged toes in front of the flames. “I mean, Hilary may be a complete and utter bint most of the time, but she has rather superb lines. The curve of her spine... Well, there’s no point in mooning about it now. I did a quick sketch of Hilary while she was drawing during class; probably one of the few times I’ve caught her unaware of being watched. The sketches took me less than ten minutes, and she agreed to pose for me again, so that the colouring was right. She wasn’t bad as a model, really. She’s never had much time for conversation with other women, so at least she didn’t chatter on.”
[You bought me these pajamas!]
going to have a full blown panic attack, no matter what Sherlock said. John had been sitting on the floor of his bedroom, leaning against the bed. He could feel his heart racing and stuttering, and his chest hurt from the struggle to breathe evenly.
[No, come back.]
She hadn’t seen Sherlock for two months after her marriage to Sherrinford. His family had departed the morning after the wedding, and they had had to say an awkward goodbye in front of his parents and brother. They were obviously not a family who went in for demonstrations of affection, and she had kissed Eugenia and Siger gingerly as they stood next to their car on the gravel driveway.
“Far fewer than that.” Sherlock sighed despairingly. “If we can narrow the list down to the number of customers who visited the shop since the contaminated tonic was delivered on the 20th of December, that leaves us with a much smaller pool of suspects.”
somewhere where he won't be so in the way is equally outside the realm of possibility. Sherlock wonders at himself for ever treating his friend and his partner and his blogger and his doctor and his very own Captain John Hamish Watson, MD so contemptuously.
“Hey, you awake?”
112. Maybe also try it on our sides? Would insufficient leverage be an issue?
open this door?”
"Are you hungry right now?"
That's what Mycroft meant.
“Well...fuck.”
He suggests whatever the latest Bond film is, much to John's surprise and delight, so they watch "Skyfall" while holding bowls full of linguine and slivers of summer vegetables, toppped with shredded chicken that gives Sherlock's jaw a workout. Mycroft may be stocking the pantry but John Watson, MD is still doing the cooking, and he tends to leave chicken (clostridium perfringens, campylobacter, enterococcus faecium) and pork (salmonella, enterococcus faecalis, and occasionally trichinella spiralis) a little too long on the hob.
Small things at first; clothes, shoes, books, toys. One day Mycroft's minions crowd into the flat to set up new furnishings in the upstairs bedroom. John doesn't comment; just silently packs up the collapsible cot.
fallen asleep, though he hadn't technically "gone to bed". He's a bit impressed, and more than a bit on edge now.)
, of course it's good; it's wonderful and perfect and a miracle but like all miracles it's more than mere mortal frame was designed to handle. Sherlock's next breath escapes as a strangled sob and John - healer, protector,
J: That's worse. Oh my God that's so much worse.
Sometimes Sherlock glances at them, clenches his jaw and wants to get it over with. Mostly he looks anywhere but, and is grateful for the reprieve. Today has been exhausting and wonderful and he doesn't dare hope for any additional miracles. Having dinner together, watching a movie while sitting companionably close on the old couch, and then curling up in bed to hope for a dreamless sleep is the height of his ambitions for the remainder of the evening.
Well. Sherlock knows exactly how to nip this literally in the bud.
“You…yeah, of course you are. Of
“You do it all the time!” Sherlock shouted, sounding exasperated now, as if John’s slowness was just one burden too many for the detective to bear. “You appointed yourself my blogger but you’re so eager to hit ‘post’ and start chatting with people in the comments that you pretend that things like composition and style don’t exist, and you also serve as my email triage unit but you spend much more time and care in pecking out so-called poetry to your girlfriends.”
Curiosity lures Sherlock further out of his blanket nest. He doesn’t remember being nursed, and in fact the last thing he can recall clearly is attempting to escape a nagging headache with a quick kip on the couch. The sight of John smiling fondly down at him derails Sherlock into whinging for sympathy, however, instead of asking for more details of his illness.
Though he’d seemed a bit taken aback to be confronted in his own room, Sherlock sprang back into triumphant offense at this.
? Focus, man!
John storms out.
, Sherlock! You'd go see a doctor if you broke your leg; why shouldn't you see a therapist for your PTSD?"
119. ...can I try topping? Do you do that? Can we do that?
"Oh. Er...well, ta for that." The frown lines melted away into pleased surprise. With a much softened tone and a rueful smile, John repeated his request for assistance. "Help me with this bloody-minded bow tie?"
John's voice, grown increasingly wobbly, breaks entirely here. Sherlock is reaching for him - trembling, breathless, on the verge of weeping himself - before he even realizes that he's moved, but is waved off with the last notecard.
“I don’t…what?” the blond asked plaintively, too worn down or worked up to put in the effort to translate Holmes into English.
Sherlock  stood stock still for a bit, shifted slightly, cleared his throat. And  then he wriggled one arm behind John’s back to grab a handful of jumper  and turned slightly to drop a kiss to John’s hair.
Hesitation interrupted the flow, and now he gnaws on his lower lip, staring anxiously at the next blank line. He has one part of John's note to address still, and here his mind is failing him. He doesn't have any experience on which to base deductions, their current situation is unprecented and unexpected and completely out of the realm of abductive reasoning, and he doesn't have enough data with which to do any inducing. The reasonable fall-back plan is to 'follow his heart' and 'trust his gut', but ironically that's what he'd relied on John to provide during that too-brief golden period before Moriarty's mad games. On his own, Sherlock is woefully unequipped, inexperienced, and afraid.
cards - have moved from the coffee table to the couch, misaligned edges just visible beyond the curve of John's hip.
"That may be the best idea you've ever had," he says, nodding solemnly.

was the aggrieved party.
That first night, after only giving a brief summary and the opening paragraph, John ends up falling asleep first, still wrapped up in and around Sherlock and hardly loosening his grip even as he slumbers. The next morning it's obvious that he's uncertain how to continue, but that the subject is never far from his mind. It's in the quick, cautious glances that turn into hesitant smiles or distracting kisses, and the flutter and clench of his left hand.
109. Would it be possible - and comfortable enough - to engage in face-to-face coitus whilst embracing? Not just a loose clasp; I mean pressed close together, burying my face in your neck, limbs entwined.
“Sherlock  you’re worrying me. Not that you don’t deserve to get yours back but  please just let me know you’re all right in there? I’ll take whatever  else you want to dish out; I deserve a good tongue-lashing and you’re  more than capable of delivering, God knows.”
Decades of near-constant isolation, both externally enforced and self-imposed, and then he finally meets someone who jolts him awake and makes him feel alive enough to want
- couldn't take hearing how I wasn't interesting enough or smart enough for you to--"
"I make my living by coddling soulless capitalists," she says, tapping away at her computer with utter unconcern. "If you're serious about wanting to scrape away the layers of sociopathy and narcissism you've accumulated over the decades to see if you've still got a heart under there somewhere that you can give to Sherlock, you'll have to go to Dr. Hughes."
"All right?" John rumbles, and Sherlock jumps a bit in his embrace. "You were doing your thinky thing but then you suddenly went all stiff."
“Mm-hm.”
"Your face was doing some very strange things," John observes, and Sherlock snaps his head up, a guilty blush already pricking at his cheeks. But while John is looming in the doorway with his arms crossed, his posture is loose and easy, and his expression is on the edge of laughter.
” John tries again, caught between laughing and crying now, hiccuping into his flatmate’s shoulder. “I love you
Sherlock wraps his scarf tighter, flips his collar higher, and keeps John busy following and fetching and running two deductions behind. And he checks behind his ears and under his fringe and along his nape not just at night, now, but morning and noon and every time he's alone in the loo. It's not just a cursory check either, but a painstaking parting of curls with an extra mirror mounted on the wall to ensure that he doesn't miss a single spot.
Happily, neither does John.
"Again?" John queries, hopeful tone making clear which way his inclinations lie.
[Yeah, alright. What sort of things, then?]
It was true that John hadn’t thought it would all be plain sailing, heading towards some kind of relationship. He knew in his bones that there were things in Sherlock’s past that affected the way he interacted with people; things that had hardened and distanced him from the rest of humanity. Part of John was tremendously curious about Sherlock’s previous relationships, if that’s what they had been. He was always fascinated by the occasional glimpses into Sherlock’s past he was granted from time to time; it all added to the great puzzle of what had happened to Sherlock. Why he was the way he was.
“Not your fault. Pain in the arse, though.” John sighed. “Maybe Mycroft will have picked something up on CCTV from across the street or something. Kind of regretting flushing the last lot of surveillance equipment down the loo now.”
His first instinct had been to tell Mycroft just how unlikely it was that he would leave Sherlock, now that things were… different. Well no, his first instinct had been to tell him to do something anatomically improbable with his umbrella. But regardless of all that… surely it was about bloody time he took a step back and started to respect the fact that Sherlock was a grown man (alright, a capricious, easily bored and dangerously curious grown man) who could make his own decisions.
John stared at him, nonplussed. “She knew, then?”
John felt the familiar combination of frustration and amazement, and was on the verge of demanding more of an explanation when Sherlock stopped dead. He was staring at the remains of Rosie’s dinner that still lay on the kitchen table.
“These are an odd mixture; there’s a few by everyone in here.” she muttered, deftly flipping through them. “Mostly the ones nobody was happy with. Christ, look at this one! George seems to have thought painting a still life entirely in puce and viridian was a jolly good idea, the twit.” she stood back to let John and Sherlock see the offending work. “Quite vile. Oh, and this one: poor Basil. He’s got some kind of mental block when it comes to painting knees; he’s made Sandra look like some kind of pony hybrid here. Now, where’s mine? Um... oh. Yes, here it is.” She had reached the back of the pile and hefted a large canvas one-handed with surprising ease.
“Think about it for a while. No rush.” John slid his left hand down from Sherlock’s knee and gently ran his fingers as far up the underside of his thigh as he could reach, feeling the muscles quiver slightly. His right hand strayed inexorably towards his own rapidly hardening cock. “I honestly don’t mind if you never want to. But, um. I’m looking forward to you… fucking. Me.”
“Dinner’s nearly ready if you disgusting worms are hungry. Well, there’s soup and sandwiches – strangely enough, reviving hypothermia victims and idiotic cousins took precedence over culinary endeavour this evening.”
I feel really bad that I haven’t been replying to all your lovely comments and messages, but life has really gotten in the way of late! I read and treasure every single comment though - they mean an awful lot to me and thank you all so much for taking the time to leave them.
The light filtering through the branches of the tall trees, dappling the heavy snow that coated the uneven ground. The harsh call of some crows in a distant bush. He forced himself to keep his eyes open, trying desperately to ground himself in his surroundings. He ached for Sherlock, for the steady pressure of his hands and the reassurance of his voice.
John sighed a little at this. He liked Menzies less and less since their meeting of the morning before. Violet nodded, reading his thoughts. “I know. The blighter obviously just wants you to do his job for him; he can take all the credit and it’ll be sunshine, tea and buns for him.”
John stared at him blankly. He opened his mouth, and then closed it again. Sherlock looked slightly ill.
“I once dreamt I was able to get inside your brain,” Sherlock continues, his seaglass eyes drifting over to Billy’s grinning face and empty sockets. “I wandered your entorhinal cortex for days, perhaps years...”
