Tony stalled for a moment then quietly said, “I started working on it, eight months ago. I’ve been trying to make it smaller, you know? It’s clean energy, sustainable over generations, and I got it down to about the size of a car battery. Good, not great, so—”
They pushed away the furniture and got situated on the floor. Between the boxes of food and drinks, Tony created little stacks pairing lecture notes with assignments. He had gone through the trouble of drafting summaries for each stack that highlighted the main concepts covered, the relevant formulas and charts, and the question types Sima favored in the assigned work.
The first finger had been easy; two fingers was a tight fit. Though, the way Tony desperately cried for release, he didn’t seem to mind. Steve continued his direct assault now with two fingers, pumping into him and curling his fingers to begin the stretch before he dared to scissor his fingers inside Tony’s body. There was a whimper and a twitch of hesitation in Tony’s eager hips when Steve spread his two fingers wide at his hole, forcing the tight ring of muscle to accommodate the stretch.
There was a brief moment of silent shock around them, but it was almost as easily shattered by laughter, wolf whistles, and thunderous applause.
“Steve, you have to count on Hawley kicking you out tonight. There’s a good chance she’ll take this personally, and I wouldn’t blame her. It’s unusual to take on first-year students, and this… this is not the press what she expected.”
The world around him suddenly stopped as Steve felt Tony kneeling at his feet like an offering. Unhurried and reverent in his touch, Tony lifted Steve’s soft cock in one hand and brushed his lips over the tip. Steve expected a playful kiss or maybe Tony would even try to stroke him off until he realized Steve wasn’t getting hard again, but Tony did neither. Instead, he parted his lips and took Steve’s soft cock into his mouth, swallowing him down until he nuzzled into Steve’s groin.
Tony frowned at the predictable lack of action, and dropped into his seat without any regard for decorum. “I find this tedious lack of stimulus dull,” he muttered mutinously, drumming his fingers over his desk. “Do you know what I did this week-end, Jane Foster?”
“You wish. It would have been a pleasure to win that game,” Bucky promised, though ironically, his answer only seemed to satisfy Tony.
“...fair enough,” Tony conceded, though he still looked a little taken aback when he turned back to Steve. He held up a file Steve didn’t recognize and asked, “Got a minute?”
Steve leaned in with a quick, chaste kiss, a last touch while they were still in private, before he opened the door and stepped out ahead of Tony. The coast was clear, not a soul in sight.
Steve and his partner could disagree until they were blue in the face, but the facts were clear. The three victims had been murdered within days of each other. Steve’s detectives in Manhattan were following up on Jones, while detectives from the 62nd were on Nyugen’s case. Maybe they’d be able to help with the letters during lulls in their investigations, but they couldn’t count on it. Steve and Bucky were alone to tease any leverage out of decades worth of Stark’s fan letters. They needed help. In the end, Bucky reluctantly thanked Tony for his volunteered time and offered to talk to the captain while Steve showed Tony to the conference room they had commandeered for their task.
Before Steve recognized what he had done, Tony groaned in complaint and pushed against his chest to be let go. Steve eased him back onto the mattress, and he followed him closely to brush his lips over Tony’s forehead, lingering intentionally, then to be sure, he pressed his cheek against Tony’s clammy skin.
Without preamble, Steve got into position, lined himself up, and pushed his hard cock into the stretched hole left by the toy. The excessive lube he had fucked into Tony’s ass was enough to ease the way, but he hadn’t slicked himself up or used a lubricated condom, and the friction left Tony hissing through his teeth with mild discomfort. The pain took some of the edge off, and every shallow thrust helped spread the lube over the full length of Steve’s cock until his every movement left Tony moaning with satisfaction.
Steve, however, could barely contain his frustration. “Listen, money doesn’t mean shit to Rumlow. He’s not trying to start a goddamn business, he’s here to ruin your fucking lives and burn this city to the ground. All he needs is firepower.”
“How about joining me for a late lunch? Or early dinner,” Steve asked after a beat of uncomfortable silence. “If I’m going to eat alone, I might as well eat at home.”
“Yeah! Two different women, two different times,” Bruce added, to be clear. “But then I was the bad guy for ending things, because ‘giving someone your number isn’t cheating.’”
,” Tony insisted, his voice breaking on the word. Steve’s heart ached at the sound, and he cast around desperately for a private space in all this chaos. There were no buildings, no walls, no place where they could speak unheard.
One could never trust a Woman. There was only one purpose they had for his kind, and to that end no man was better or worse than any other. He had no reason to believe he would ever be safe again if they knew where he lived.
“Christ—Steve, thank god,” Tony croaked out into Steve’s happy-tingling shoulder, and when he lifted his head again Steve could see the tears wet on his cheeks.
It wasn’t what Tatum had said as much as the look the camera caught him giving Tony when he said it.
“You don’t have to rub it in,” Tony grumbled quietly, and Rhodey thumbed his nose before his smirk turned into a laugh. “Would, would you just call her and figure it out?”
“On Tuesday, I only told the kids about flatworms. All flatworms are hermaphrodites, all perfectly viable as both male and female. But they all want to be the male, because the female role includes staying with the offspring, which means the flatworm that acts as the male can move on and produce more offspring. So, they duel for that privilege using their penises as swords, and the one that loses its penis takes the female role.”
Steve leapt to his feet and threw himself at his friend who had collapsed in his seat in tears. Bucky spun around in his seat as soon as Steve’s arms were around him and hugged him back like a drowning man who’d finally been thrown a lifeline. He’d been so close to losing his family, and Steve couldn’t begin to imagine how overwhelming that kind of fear might be. So he did what little he could: held on tight, and offered quiet reassurances when he could that this was real - nobody would ever try to take his children away from him again.
“You did it,” Tony assured him, and Steve purred when he felt the unmistakable touch of Tony’s lips on his forehead. “I love you back, Steve. I’ll be right here so rest now, and then you come home with me.”
“Tony,” he said quietly, hoping not to wake him if Tony had already fallen asleep. Tony hummed under his breath, encouraging him to continue. “Are you moving back to LA after Bucky’s case is over?”
“Steve, we’re going somewhere you won’t tell me about, for reasons you won’t explain, after weeks of excuses Lois Lane wouldn’t even believe—”
Tony dug in and scraped his blunt nails over Steve’s meaty ass, and between that and the warm, wet suction on his ear, Steve buried himself deep in Tony and came hard. Tony moaned softly in hoarse triumph as he squeezed his thighs around Steve’s body, not letting him pull away as Steve’s hips worked haplessly, fucking Tony through the last throes of his orgasm.
“I love Tim Burton’s Batman,” Tony said as they sat down, and he didn’t seem to worry about talking while chewing his popcorn. Steve did his best to maintain eye contact without grimacing. “And Michael Keaton as Bruce is the best, isn’t he?”
They got their beers, a sandwich to share, and tempura sweet potato fries, then made their way to their seats with about fifteen minutes to spare. The pre-show game was on the jumbo screen and classic rock music played in the background to pump up the crowd. The players were already out on the ice warming up.
This time when Steve added a third finger, Tony took to the stretch more readily. Steve twisted his three fingers as one, pumping slowly; occasionally, he reached farther and treated Tony to a tender and teasing massage of his prostate, but now his focus was on stretching him for the job. The next time he pulled his fingers out, he did so with his fingers spread wide, until Tony whimpered again at the pain of his three fingers held still at the rim of his hole, spreading him wide open.
“Shh, hey,” Steve said gently, leaning back enough to meet Tony’s eyes. “How about we go to bed? It’s been a long day, I’m ready to be put it behind me.”
“We’re not afraid of you, Sorceress!” he shouted anyway, lying through his big, blunt teeth. “I am not under your spell, your prey will not come easily today: I will fight you!”
“What do you—what’s James saying? Buck!” Steve was on his feet and grabbing for Bucky’s phone faster than Bucky had expected, but when he shouted into the phone to get answers out of Rhodey, he’d already hung up.
Tony groaned his pleasure, so deep and so satisfied, and with slurred, happy words, he moaned, “My hero.”
. “I’ve kept Mr. Right away from you vultures for five years, why should today be any different? He makes me a better man, a happier man, and that’s all you’re getting out of me tonight.”
“Sorry, almost there,” the man promised in a firm tone, and Tony stilled without needing to be told twice. Instead, he held on to Marple where she curled around his head. His worried girl trembled under his hands, but she wasn’t leaving him, and through the staggering pain from his ankle, Tony had the wherewithal to wonder how he’d ever gotten so lucky.
For a second, Steve’s gaze drifted to Tony’s ass where he was still trussed up on the counter, thighs on lewd display and Tony’s heart rate picked up with the exciting thought of Steve plugging him back up so Tony would spend the rest of the evening full of Steve’s come.
“Let me have a look at you,” Steve murmured, unfastening the robe from the small of his back and down to his ankles, exposing his ass and spread thighs to the view of the waiting hall.
That, finally, distracted Tony from Clint’s enormous, blunt teeth. “You’re—you’re a fugitive?” he stammered.
“Jane would look at me like that,” Thor said with a sigh, looking down into his refreshed pint. “I miss her, Bruce.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but he kept his mouth shut. He was doing fine until he got bored enough to forget Tony’s earlier request and again started poking around at the underwear displays they passed.
The man’s smile pulled down into a frown the more Steve said. “Just like that? After you went through all that trouble?”
“He’s humble, he’s generous, and he’s kind,” Tony said after some thought. “He tries. That deserves a second date, doesn’t it?”
“Darling, I’d love to show you, but I’m hardly in my prime,” Tony conceded, and his grin faded. “I’m out of practice—”
It was one of the earliest success stories of the unification, and Tony listened to Agneta talk about how she had seen the city’s spirits and sense of community lifting through her children. To theoretically understand the importance of nature and recycling is one thing, but to see first hand the magic of seasons, of little seeds that grow into strong, nutritious wheat, or kid goats who so freely play on sheets of ice, those were few of the many lessons Friedstadt had never known before unification.
Steve’s first official appearance at an international event was the UN General Assembly in New York. He and Tony had celebrated their one year anniversary on the same day that their kingdom celebrated its first year as a united people. One month later he was sent on his first assignment. Everything changed so quickly, and how he had ever gotten up in front of representatives from all around the world still rattled him hours after he’d stepped away from the podium to humbling applause.
The spark of an idea lit behind Steve’s eyes. Bucky frowned in his confusion, but something in Steve had come back to life.
If it was possible to choke on nothing, Steve did it. He stopped dead in his tracks in the middle of the hallway, and through his delighted snickering, Tony patted Steve on the back to help him catch his breath.
Steve poured more lube onto his fingers and his fingers into Tony with an infuriating patience. Had it been any other man, Tony would have smacked him with a pillow and turned formation, but the longer Steve took to prepare him, the rougher he tended to be, so Tony gritted his teeth, held his tongue, and did his best to relax as Steve pumped his fingers slowly into Tony, thoroughly spreading the warmed lube as deep inside Tony’s body as his long fingers could reach.
Still, Tony wouldn’t look up at him. Steve pressed a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s neck, letting his lips linger over Tony’s skin. “I care about
Steve had intercepted the master criminals at the first pub on English soil. While they drank like fish and congratulated themselves on a job well done, Steve broke into the van to see what had been so special about the dozen ceramic clocks they had gone all the way to Delft to steal.
“Yes, ha ha. Laugh at my misery,” Steve tried to mutter irritably, but he couldn’t help but smile or stop the rumble of amusement that Tony could feel under his body.
“We got this room ‘til five!” Sam called without looking up, while Steve automatically turned to march on the door with every intention of slamming it shut on someone’s toes, until he realized who that someone was.
“That’s what I asked Chief Director Nicholas Fury!” Jane cried, but then she quickly lowered her voice before anyone outside Tony’s office doors heard her. In a more cautious tone of voice, she explained. “Chief Director Nicholas Fury said there was no need to create widespread panic. It is only a matter of tick-tocks before the perpetrator is codetraced.”
“For you and for the Rubens, I will give it my best effort,” Steve promised with a warm laugh. “I thought I’d take a dip and keep you company, unless you want privacy…?”
predictable,” Steve huffed, even though they both knew it was a lie. “Anyone would find Tony attractive. He’s objectively handsome, and he’s kind, he’s intelligent, he’s thoughtful—”
take it off,” Steve countered with a petulant pout, but as Tony leaned in closer and hummed in question, that petulant frown quivered and so clearly threatened to wither into an overtired giggling fit.
Tony snorted quietly at the dumb joke and smacked Steve on the arm, though he was still too comfortable and comforted in Steve’s arms to move away. “Jokes like that will be the reason why I’ll be asleep when you get back tonight.”
“Sure,” Steve said as he pulled his jacket on, a little distracted. “And you’ll let us know the minute you find anything?”
Miriam turned her attention to Channing and, without shame or apology, said, “Darling, I’m 72… I don’t know about dancing and songs, but I am sure you are highly admired.”
“Wow. It’s a wonder you’re still single, Stark,” Steve sighed half-heartedly, but he left the door open when he turned and shuffled back to his couch.
“They have twice as many people in New York City than we have in our entire country,” Steve pointed out. “Of course it’s dirty. I don’t know how they drink that water.”
“That is the smell of Christmas!” Steve said with a big grin, stirring the pot until it came together in a hot syrup. “Honey and lemon. We’ll fry the balls once you’re done with them and then we give them a turn in this.”
The third victim was as far from a runaway as you could get, and after some digging through the backlog of closed unsolved cases of dead runaways, Steve and Natasha identified the first two victims as part of the pattern. It wasn’t as simple as a killer who left a calling card, or an easily identifiable method. The victims were all killed with a single cut across the throat, then undressed and scrubbed clean for some unsuspecting dog walker to find.
I popped back to Texas for the holiday, and was reminded that in my past Texas life, I left a copy of
Tony decided on white for himself, but that Steve had to wear the one in blue, because matching was tacky.
With the loud, startling clap of lightning, Clint, Natasha, and Tony appeared in the empty space behind the Elder.
“...no,” Tony said after a beat of silence where his blood was too busy rushing to turn his face red to form any words. “Uh, what are the odds you, you know, that you’d believe that I don’t get my kicks from letting my dog chew on butt plugs and then let her parade them in public for all of Brooklyn to see?”
With that promise, Tony hung up and left Steve to stare at his phone in an uncomfortable silence. Tony had sought help. He’d recognized his problem, sought help, and recovered. Some might call his journey a heroic one, a victory over an addiction that otherwise consumed so many.
“Do you need another ice pack, Orfeo?” he asked, gently but firmly so that the young man might feel compelled to answer honestly. After all, most would not otherwise want to ask their monarch for favors.
Tony had been guessing all week what this surprise was, but his closest guess was that Steve would be wearing his dress uniform to their date. Steve had told him he wasn’t wrong, but that it was a private surprise. So instead of a romantic, Thursday night Valentine’s Day dinner, they planned on a Friday night dinner and a Thursday together in what they had come to call their suite.
Besides capitalizing on their luck abroad and Steve’s frequent calls about confounding and often contradictory social rules (what cosmic math resulted in two kiss greetings in Italy but four in France?), they relied on the most contrived reasons to make official visits to each other’s countries whenever their schedules allowed. Steve invited Tony to the first winter solstice of his rule, where side by side they watched the young students of Fiorera’s primary school perform the beautiful music celebrating the warm, guiding light of their faith through the darkest hours of the year. Machtberg had secularized aggressively after the First World War, but Tony was still nearly moved to tears watching the shared joy and passion those children exuded with every prayer and song.
Steve opened and closed his mouth when he heard the price, but before he could croak out a protest, Tony was speaking again.
“Tony Stark is the first ever openly gay actor nominated in the Best Actor in a Motion Picture category, and the third ever Latino actor nominated.”
was the final straw. Steve clapped a hand over his chest and fell back into the couch, laughing so hard he was near tears.
He never felt as safe as he did in Steve’s arms. Steve kissed him like every touch of their lips was a miracle, and he held Tony to his chest with what was only a fraction of his strength. The raw power in his body comforted Tony in a way no armed guard could, as if Steve inherently understood what support Tony craved.
“This should be easy,” Sharon was the first to say. “Per the prenuptial agreement she is entitled to the majority of all assets in the event that he cheats or returns to alcoholism. He’s done both.”
Tony was going to die. His defense was in less than 48 hours. He had worked on his charts, his graphs - his simulations, his videos,
“I don’t know what you have against this dinner, Tony,” he said as casually as he could. “I think it’s great.”
“You know the cast and crew would have wanted to be the first to congratulate you, right?” Bucky added more quietly, and his less absurd point made Steve pay attention. “Let people know you’re planning to be open about it so we can speak up. Nobody wants to throw you under the bus if they think you’re trying to stay private.”
The clock was in overtime. Any pass, any slapshot could have been the game winning goal, and Steve could barely breathe from the tension. Tony kept glancing at him, captivated by the genuine excitement in Steve’s entire body, from the way he would curl his fists when the Red Wings moved too close to Lundqvist’s net, or the way he would lean in and almost brace his weight on the balls of his feet anytime the Rangers moved the game back to put the pressure on the visiting team.
Tony watched as Jane processed the metaphor with the same care as when she came across a new finding in astrophysics.
“Sounds like I’ll need my phone either way, babe,” Tony decided, and he turned to nuzzle at Steve’s outstretched arm to get his attention. “Where’s the coat room?”
There were a lot of things that Steve couldn’t remember from Thursday night. He couldn’t remember the drive from Boston to Quincy; Google told him it was a twenty to thirty minute drive, but Steve would have sworn on his ma’s life that it was no more than five minutes. They’d gotten into Tony’s car and started talking about anything and everything - from their most memorable travel mishaps to their favorite literary villains. When Tony told him they were going to visit a chapel built in a former lighthouse, Steve couldn’t help but tell Tony that he’d never been to a lighthouse, and how one of his bucket-list holidays was to one year spend September driving up the Eastern seaboard from Georgia to Prince Edward Island, where he’d heard the fall foliage was something out of a storybook.
Even with the lights, the tunnel was so deep that there was no end in sight. Tony’s stomach churned with fear.
Bucky didn’t stick around to see if Steve meant it. He pushed Tony aside and made a run for the elevator with Steve hot on his heels.
“…Steve, you know I can’t,” Tony whispered when he finally caught up with Steve. “This is too much. I didn’t—I mean, yeah, some money for groceries and bills would be great, but I didn’t do it because I needed rent money—”
“No, it’s like, totally, a smart people thing,” Jasper said in a mocking imitation of a valley girl. A blonde valley girl. “And like Sharon said: we’re full.”
“Well,” Bucky said quietly after a beat, “it’s. I mean, it’s for a surprise birthday present, you know? I didn’t know which one she’d like, just that she likes Tom Ford, so I had no choice, Steve. I bought them all.”
But most of all, Steve had an irrational fear that if he acknowledge it publicly, he’d wake up and find out it was all a dream.
“Yeah,” Tony said with a quiet, thoughtful expression. “Not sure I could do this without you, Steve. Not sure I’d want to.”
“We might not even want to do anything, let alone something we’ve never done before. And if you want to bottom, I think it should be on a day when we have all day to ourselves. For the wedding night, we’ll be tired, it will be late ...don’t look at me like that, Tony,” he said after a beat, grinning to himself. “I’m not trying to spare you or martyr myself. Honestly, the closer we get to the wedding the less I can focus on anything else. It’s been a very long time for me.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony mumbled quietly, dropping the issue before he lost his last ally. “I’ll go wait for him outside. He’s punctual, we shouldn’t be long.”
The palm reader wasn’t glass, or crystal, or the strange plastic cover of the touch screens Steve had started to get used to the last time around. This was a cool, blue gel that pooled around his fingers until his hand was fully submerged to the wrist. The mechanisms behind the door gave a series of quiet beeps, then all at once, the gel emptied from the reader to allow Steve to remove his hand, clean and dry to the touch.
Tony steadily towed Steve towards the bar where Rhodey would presumably be, but Steve was so busy taking in the scene that he had trouble keeping up. And, cliche as it was, that mechanical bull was particularly intriguing.
“Hang on,” Steve said after a beat, and as he turned to the crowd around them he took off his cap, his one disguise. Murmurs rose around them and a few heads turned their way as a fraction of the people standing around them on the train started to notice whom they were standing beside.
“God, this is so weird. You smell… like home,” he murmured, breathing Steve’s new scent in deeply. Steve hummed quietly, from the lack of anything to say.
Apparently, the most common risk was the lack of reliable research on the species involved in the harvest. But Steve had spent years with humans, and months with Tony. He knew his pet. Already, Tony had produced an impressive stock of raw, unprocessed hormones ready to be sold to the highest bidder.
“Oh, really? That wasn’t you?” Steve asked in blatant disbelief, because he wasn’t born yesterday. “That’s a shame. I was so touched, I came all the way out here hoping to ask you to dinner to thank—”
The audience and Steve both laughed easily, but as it naturally quieted down, Jimmy turned to Steve with a more intent, curious look. “But two days ago, on December 9th, they announced the nominations for this year’s Golden Globes…”
“Ducks,” Tony stage-whispered, and while most kids were invested in snacktime and chasing each other around the playground in Peter and MJ’s care, Tony’s own group tip-toed a little closer around him to hear. “Did you know that most birds don’t actually have penises? Ducks are an exception. And the Lake Duck in Argentina, in South America, has one of the longest penises in the world.”
Bruce followed him faithfully out into the bullpen, where natural sunlight spilled from the expansive sunroof overhead to warm the friendly faces who filled the room with buoyant chatter.
Steve snorted at the question, shaking his head at a thought. “You don’t know the half of it. I was going to buy you a ring, at first,” Steve said with a wistful smile. His attention briefly fell to Tony’s left hand, and he turned it gently so he could sweep the pad of his thumb over Tony’s naked ring finger. “I love your hands,” he couldn’t help but say before continuing to tell Tony what happened.
Steve didn’t even try to catch his come in his palm, stroking Tony off through the very last spasms of his orgasm with his cock pointed right at the book spines facing them.
“What—who? What was that?” he whispered almost rhetorically—after all, just because he had seen it with his own two eyes didn’t mean he necessarily believed what had happened.
“We had a good time finding Iron Man,” Steve sang the same tune to another journalist—Carl this time, maybe?—and he did it with his typical Steve Rogers smile. He had said the same words to six other journalists before Carl already, but Tony had noticed that when he said anything with that USO smile, people gladly gobbled up anything.
“Legend says there is a Last Chief,“ Clint told him, mashing the boiled turnip into oozing paste between his teeth. Tony frowned down at his own food and carefully put his fork down. There went his appetite. “She was foretold to unite all men and Women with compassion, but the Great Chief of Old turned her away into the wild as a child to prevent the prophecy from being completed.”
“Don’t make me call James, Tony,” she hissed at him under her breath, already levelling a long-suffering look at him that made it clear she meant it.
Tony continued without so much as acknowledging him. “I got into Preston’s university email and found his personal account,” he said, referring to the third victim, then finally opened the laptop to reveal what was clearly a dating site profile page.
If Steve wasn’t excited already, he was outright gleeful when Rhodey took him around to the operating stand. It looked a little like how Fisher Price would reimagine an airplane console for toddlers, but Steve wasn’t going to let that stop him.
, Steve,” Tony reminded him, his tone as playful as he was serious. “We made it to fifty days; I think we can make fifty weeks.”
Compared to the internet and smartphones of the 21st century, Taco Bell should not have been that confusing. Still, between the uncomfortable misappropriation of an ethnic identity that never belonged to Taco Bell in the first place, and the horror on their menu, Steve was ready to bolt by the time it was their turn to order.
For the first time that morning, shame washed over Steve’s back like ice-cold rain. In a voice smaller than he’d ever felt, he whispered, “What?”
“Tony, I didn’t think you’d make it,” Steve said as Tony came to stand beside him. “It’s good to see you again.”
All at once, Steve’s distracted, unsure attitude was forgotten. The shift from defense to offense was as clear as night to day: he sat up straight with his shoulders pulled back, and instead of his surprised or unsure look from earlier, Steve could look at him again with his characteristic confidence.
as his body accepted the full girth of intrusion. As Tony’s body finally relaxed around his fingers and tried to draw him deeper into his body with every thrust, Steve occasionally curled his fingers to tease Tony’s prostate with a light touch that left Tony gasping for air and cursing Steve with increasingly senseless expletives.
But tonight, it was about being there for Tony. It was about comfort, unwavering support, and a flight of tequila.
“Tony, you don’t understand,” Steve interrupted him in a whisper, and Tony quieted instinctively to hear the quiet words Steve struggled to speak. “When Bucky told me what happened, I…”
Besides the fact that the four victims were all young, attractive men interested in other men, there was little else that connected them. One was a part-time service attendant at a car wash who lived a closeted life at home with his parents, until he’d disappeared eight months ago. The next victim was an extroverted bartender at a grungy gay club in Harlem, until he, too, disappeared without a trace. Their remains had been found recently in the city, and written off as the inevitable end for queer runaway kids.
Rhodey was a ride or die friend, and Tony couldn’t begrudge him this one time he forgot the bro code. Mostly because Steve was there, and while the rest of Carol’s friends played pool, Steve and Tony sat back and talked for hours. Even after the numerous rematches, when most of the ROTC crew had waved goodbye and left, Steve and Tony effortlessly found more to talk about, more to laugh about, until the bar keep closing up had to kick them out. The T had stopped running hours ago, and Tony had insisted on driving Steve to campus. Steve had allowed it, only if the drive came with a good night kiss.
Tony hummed happily into the kiss, but before he forgot what he was saying again, he reluctantly pulled back. “Let’s think of this as… warm-up,” he said, still a little breathless from the kisses that hadn’t remained chaste for very long. “Tonight, it’s only about you and what you like. We know you like kissing,” he added with a grin, cupping Steve’s face in one hand and fondly brushing his thumb over Steve’s spit-slick lips. “And darling, you’re damn good at it.”
Tony may have mumbled something like, ‘looks can be deceiving’ in reply, but Carol couldn’t tell because down below, the track suits started to come off. The soft string of curses that spilled out of him next were unintelligible but universally understood, and Carol pursed her lips to keep from grinning.
“Aw, shucks. That’s tough for me. You see, I only have time for first dates on Friday,” Tony lamented with a big, mournful pout that fooled Steve for one whole second. That second was just enough time for Tony to slip out of the kitchen.
Steve took a towel and pressed it over Tony’s wound to stall the bleeding. Somewhere between wondering how Steve was so calm and why dying wasn’t scarier, Tony came to a haunting realization.
If he thought long enough, maybe Steve could have thought of a plausible excuse. When he was honest with himself, he knew he wasn’t ready to be friends with Tony yet. One look at him, and Steve would be right back to that summer day he stood on his stoop in New York, listening to Tony say they were done. He’d beg for Tony to explain, to reconsider. What problem could they not overcome together?
Months before the wedding, Tony started to feel his nerves rise into the fore. Not his nerves about the wedding or the unification; those questions were either long settled or in the process of being resolved, and he accepted his limited role in how they came to pass. As part of the plans related to the wedding, however, Pepper had raised the question of their honeymoon, and where they wished to go. Her recommendation was to stay local, where press could be contained and monitored. She reminded him of an alpine castle that was the highest royal residence in Machtberg, they would have nearly complete privacy in a place so remote and wild. There was even an old baronial estate in the northernmost mountains of Terrini she felt was suitable with its stunning views, privacy, and comfortable amenities.
, everyone knows that,” he pointed out, in case Clint thought he could guilt Tony into sacrificing his own safety somehow. “And running from a Chief? What were you thinking? Chiefs have magic, she’ll find you one way or another. They’ll never stop hunting you.”
“He’s got a point,” Bruce seconded before Tony could disagree. “But rich people read our magazine, too. We write about Elon Musk all the time; Tesla owners have relationships, too.”
“When do you leave?” he asked in a whisper. All at once, the thought of Steve leaving left Tony quite reluctant to push away and let him sit up again. He wasn’t ready to let Steve leave so soon.
Except Wayne’s office was an exercise in modern architecture, and the whole space was designed as an open plan with big windows that left no shadows where secrets could hide. Not to mention Tony’s thumb drive was still running its software; if he pulled out now they’d get nothing for all this trouble.
“Then you can do whatever you want with the tickets,” Steve said without so much as asking about their cost. “Make it happen, Carter. In the meantime, I’ll be… asking Tony Stark out on a date.”
He could turn Clint in, Tony thought to himself later that night. Early the next morning, he would tell the donkey he was going fishing, but he would travel to the Eastlands to find this tribe of Women that Clint had disgraced and tell them where they could find him. They would take what they wanted from him, and then serve him his punishment, and Tony would be at peace again.
He opened his eyes, and there was Tony - and Tony was smiling at him! His was such a beautiful smile - he looked so happy! - that Steve thought he could maybe share his cotton candy with him.
“I live around the corner,” Steve explained, holding the door open even as he paused to point out his building. It was an elegant modern building with generous windows and a lush rooftop. “When I work from home, I grab lunch here.”
“Alright gentlemen. You can do it your way for now,” Hammer conceded irritably. “But if your blunder slows down my investigation, I’m coming for your badges. Am I clear?”
“So, you do? You think I’m an airhead,” Tony repeated in a breathless voice. “I spilled water on you, and so you, what? Your shirt was so expensive you’re taking it out of my body?”
Her words were benign, even inspiring. But there was something about the way she looked at him that made Steve sick to his stomach. Hawley didn’t seem concerned or interested in Steve’s career; she looked at him like he was a piece of meat, the same way most people looked at him after realizing the body modeling this year’s Calvin Klein catalogue belonged to him.
In a vain attempt to dig up clothes he could arguably sleep in, Steve dug through his drawers for clothes Tony might plausibly believe Steve wore to bed. Steve, who ran so hot he kept a stash of clean boxers next to his pillow in the dorm so he could sleep naked and pull on a new pair before getting up.
Tony was silent on the other end of the call. Steve had started to think Tony’d actually hung up on him when he finally asked, “Why?”
“You lasted longer than I did,” Steve told Tony before he took his palpable embarrassment out on his soon-to-be-ex-friend. “I couldn’t help it, I told my friends about our date an hour ago. I had a really great time with you, Tony.”
True to his word, Steve allowed Tony to feed from him as long as he needed. He laid back and stroked Tony’s hair as he leisurely bobbed on Steve’s long cock and drank down every gush of come that rolled through him in small, soothing waves. In a rare show of trust, Steve fell asleep first that night, and when he woke up the next morning, he found Tony in the same position between his thighs. He was dead asleep, but even so he still curled his fingers loosely around Steve’s cock and angled Steve’s soft cock so the head would not slip out from between his lips while Tony slept.
Tony blinked up at Steve at first, blindsided by his question. It took him the space of two heartbeats to understand, but when he did, all he could do was smile. Smile, warm and adoring, to show him Steve how happy he made Tony.
“Welcome back, thank you for being here!” Stephen smiled at him, both professional and encouraging in his expression.
“But, don’t you have a dream wedding?” Tony asked, trying to keep his voice calm. “Something not this?”
Tony fell forward, but braced himself on his hands in the last moment, struggling to keep from dumping his weight on Steve. Steve briefly thought he wouldn’t have minded, might even have welcomed Tony’s weight heavy against his back, but Tony was already pulling away, pulling out, and climbing off the bed.
“Over,” Jan said without hesitation. “Skinny jeans don’t suit you, Steve. Don’t go there. But, remember to give these time. Feel them out: break them in before extended use.”
Tony couldn’t make out what they were saying and (tragically) he couldn’t read lips, but it didn’t escape him that Steve never frowned or shook his head no. He was smiling and laughing with Jane, and at one point even pulled out his phone as if to confirm the time.
The invitation to have sex had fogged Steve’s mind up with near-delirious interest, and with that one-track mind if his, Steve had been crass and selfish in how he treated Tony’s opinions. And now, when Steve could see the evidence of what would happen when the tables were turned, when Tony was given a chance to either belittle or respectfully accommodate Steve’s differences, Steve found himself staggering under the realization of how much time and effort and money Tony must have dedicated to him in the middle of a stressful day to meet Steve’s every need.
It took Clint more courage than he knew he possessed to dare look away from the dragon’s savage teeth and claws long enough to spot the beautiful, blonde woman riding on the back of the black dragon. She smiled at them, as if unbothered by the abominable beast she so casually rode.
Sharon snorted at the suggestion. “That’s very possible, he is a man,” she conceded. “But sometimes… I don’t know. Doesn’t have to be that weird. I wore Sam’s flight suit and special occasion-underwear for his birthday this year,” she added casually, and Steve looked up with his eyebrows somewhere in the zipcode of his hairline. Sharon didn’t have to look at him to smirk knowingly at his expression. “Let’s just say, it was a hit.”
“We call him the Captain, after Captain America,” Tony told him when he realized Steve was staring at the dumb-dumbs climbing up on the mechanical bull, only to inevitably be thrown from its back. “Rhodey—no, that’s—
Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s shoulder and closed his eyes. He concentrated on the soothing sound of Steve’s voice, the gentle, absent touch of Steve’s hands, and the warm water all around them, and slowly, he started to let the day fade away.
“Oh, I’m not asking for forgiveness,” Tony answered with a soft giggle in his voice, “but do you really think you can fit under the couch with those pecs?”
“A lot of them groom their sugar babies for lucrative careers,” Tony told the group as the rest of them got to their feet and started to pack up for the night. “Ask about internships or jobs that sound too good to be true.”
“A John Legend?” Tony repeated in case she’d misheard, but when she didn’t look any less confused, he cast around for a way to explain. “Impressive in every way, but never threatening.”
Tony sniffed quietly, but said nothing. Instead, he turned on his heel and marched to the kitchen. Steve watched him go with a thoughtful smile, but when he turned to excuse himself from Clint, Clint only waved him off.
Steve made it through the rest of the day listening to information sessions about campus programs, amenities, and clubs, until they were finally released to return to their dorms. He had two days before classes commenced, and as the door to his suite closed behind him, Steve reminded himself that two days was plenty of time for Brock to arrive and for Steve to find him.
Was he proposing already? Was that how Tony was going to be delivered from an extended case of blue balls? But he couldn’t say yes just for sex, Steve deserved better. Tony could do better.
“Right, thank you,” Steve said as he recovered. The second year was too busy checking Steve’s name off on a list to acknowledge him further, so Steve cleared his throat and asked, “Has Brock Rumlow checked in yet?”
He turned the phone face down on his desk and resumed the video. GDP made sense when Professor Sima had explained it in class, so why the hell did it feel like interpreting Greek when Steve tried to do it himself?
“I’m not saying she is a suspect,” Bucky muttered, but before he got any further, he was interrupted by a conspicuous clearing of the throat. Both Steve and Bucky looked up to see a uniformed officer and Tony Stark waiting for their attention.
They quickly learned that the letter writers ranged from mildly irritated to wildly unstable. Some were only irritated by the ‘gay agenda’ or the erasure of women in a Western novel, while a handful of people were outraged by explicit sexual relations between humans and androids. But the nastiest letters were from those personally offended that Tony did not return their affection and interest. Many such letters detailed precisely how they would be the perfect partner for Tony, and what sins they would gladly perform for their favorite erotic novelist.
“We are,” Sharon told him coolly, and her two friends turned to look at him with equally sour expressions. “But it’s a costume party, you probably wouldn’t want to come.”
“Wonder about this, you son of a bitch,” Steve snarled while the morality box whirred back to life. “You can’t control a man like Rumlow. Give up the fucking game, or he’ll finish you himself.”
Tony made a strangled sound, like he wanted to laugh but couldn’t believe what he had heard at the same time. “Sorry, MLK is
“Sort of—I have the devices attached to them,” he started to explain when Tony’s breath caught. “What?”
“Got medicine,” Steve whispered, nuzzling into a pillow. It wasn’t the silken designer sheets he had in his own bed, but it was well-loved jersey cotton. Tony wasn’t exactly sure when he’d last washed them, but at least they were soft.
The look of horrified incredulity on Steve’s face was what did it. Tony lost it, face-planting against Steve’s chest to hide his face and to muffle his spluttering, wheezing giggles. It took Steve a moment longer to realize he’d been had, but as soon as he did, he squeezed Tony in his arms until Tony whimpered in surrender.
came out, but in this business, you try not to let flattery and talk get to your head. And like you said, it’s practically unheard of: Tony was eight months old when Raul Julia was nominated in 1985. Then, of course, we have the whole Evil Eye thing to consider - that’s never been a part of my life before—and if I’m honest, I’m not quite sure I get it yet? But that meant that in our house, we had to treat it like a normal Sunday night, a normal Monday,” Steve told Jimmy and the audience. Then, with a tone of incredulity, he added, “It was my dad who broke the news.”
Tony peeled the boxing wraps off his hands impatiently at future!Tony’s expense and tossed them over a chair to dry. He kicked off his sneakers on his way to his bathroom, leaving his keys, sneakers, and sweater strewn haphazardly across the floor as he went.
Dejected and frustrated, Steve found a group of three and sat down to join them. With the help of another burned out second-year, Steve was introduced to four of his first-year peers, but again it was nothing like his experience at NYU. The introductions were brief and dull, and no-one seemed interested in conversations unless it provided an opportunity to one-up each other.
Tony eyed him thoughtfully. He couldn’t decide if he could bear not knowing how many hours Sam and Bucky had spent brainstorming the name, or if he really was that much of a masochist.
“What?” Steve mumbled, but his immediate follow-up was to grab the phone out of Sam’s hands to cancel his call. “This is
Without thinking, he pressed back for more. Steve’s hand was still warm on his hip, but this time he didn’t stop Tony’s physical pleas for attention, and instead Tony heard him speak in an encouraging tone to the student currently exploring Tony’s rear.
“Tony, you know I would be the first one to sign,” he said with a smile. “Hell, I’d be the first person in line to see it in theaters.”
Sam and Erin echoed their support for Paulette’s wisdom. Steve slouched further into his hair chair wondering how his life could be so good and so rotten at the same time. He had kind, dependable friends, he was doing well in his program, and he’d met a really great guy, but he’d also married a one-night stand and broken his ma’s heart.
” Steve growled and stalked away to pace in agitation like a caged predator. Violence would solve nothing now, but oh, how he wished it would. And still his body ached; he had been up for too long, given himself too little time to recover, and he couldn’t remember the last square meal he’d had.
“Steve, you’re scaring me,” Tony admitted quietly. He took a seat on one of the beautiful velvet wingback chairs in Steve’s sitting room. “I’ll be right here for as long as you need me to be here, okay? Don’t rush. The last thing you need is to hurt—”
All that was missing was Tony beside him - Tony to thank for this unnecessarily lavish but deeply appreciated pampering, Tony to talk to until the therapist rejoined him, Tony and his soft, content sighs to listen to from across the room.
true, and why would Tony doubt him, but then Tony looked him in the eyes again and derailed Steve’s defensive rant in one breath.
Tony lived in a sleek, glass-encased high-rise overlooking Seaport Blvd. But then again, Tony’s poor taste was none of Steve’s business. He turned into the convenient underground parking garage, dropped his car off with the valet without a second thought, and jogged the whole way to the elevators.
“This is unbelievable,” Tony muttered under his breath, unable to even meet Dr. Odinson’s eyes. The room fell into silence for some time as Tony thought, Steve waited, and Dr. Odinson watched them squirm.
“I thought you were pulling away,” Tony said instead, because at the end of the day it wasn’t about her, it was about
“Guess that means I’m down to only two reasonable explanations now,” Tony confessed, laughter still bright in his eyes.
With a frown and a last glance at the security footage, Tony realized he needed a place to hide. Somewhere nobody would think to look for him.
Tony looked up at Steve with a small frown of confusion, not familiar with the reference until Steve treated him to a masterful rendition of the classic
“Innovation, revolution, and progress. All of these steps have been taken despite the risk of failure,” she said, giving every word its due gravity. She paused then and met Steve’s eyes. “Without recognizing the fear of failure and shame, one rejects the vulnerability necessary to press onwards.”
Steve raced out of the apartment after Tony, and by the grace of whoever was watching over him, he caught up to Tony before the elevator doors closed.
, Rogers! We’ve been sitting on the plane for hours, let’s get out, stretch our legs. See London! What’s with the pjs?” Tony suddenly accused with pursed lips, as if caught between a pout and a grin. “Double time, baby, come on, or the next time someone asks about how you prepared for transitioning Cap into the 90s, I’ll answer with an interpretive dance.”
They were late for breakfast the next morning, but Steve really couldn’t have cared less. He followed Tony through the house easily, trying to distract himself from his private but enthusiastic countdown to their return flight tomorrow afternoon. They were on their way to the kitchen when Tony made an abrupt stop and rushed out to the front door.
The world was a perfect place, holding and being held by the man he loved. It was so easy to ignore the world, even if that included his intimidating agent. Steve mumbled something half-heartedly and nuzzled closer - only pulling back when Tony jerked under him with a gasp and a shudder from the scrape of Steve’s stubble.
Tony nodded in reply and tossed him a cold bottle of water. Steve caught the bottle easily and dropped into the couch, grateful to get his feet off the floor and away from what could have been a careful system of organization.
“I think this is the Strand. This is how far the Thames used to reach,” Tony said even as he turned where he stood to confirm his guess. “This—then, that should be Trafalgar Square,” he told Steve while gesturing to their left. “Wanna go see?”
“Thanks, Stark,” Natasha said and got up from the couch, clearly done with her visit. “You’re always worth the price of imported beer.”
“You know I still have a job to do, don’t you?” Sharon pointedly reminded him while Steve was quietly musing to himself. “Your job, in fact, on top of my own.”
He’d been so distracted by his friend’s unexpected appearance that he’d almost forgotten he was raising his hand. The class tittered with gossip as Steve faltered, but he did his best to shake it off and make his point.
Only twenty hours separated Tony from his long-awaited race. Twenty hours before he pretended he could watch Steve hurtle (frankly alarming) weights in the hammer throw without getting hot under the collar. Twenty hours before Steve excitedly gorged himself on half a dozen pies alongside a handful of their nuttiest citizens. The first year Steve volunteered for the pie eating contest, Tony had wanted to cry. A monarch gorging himself
“Rhodey!” he called across the bar, waving his hat in the air to grab his friend’s attention. “One more, for luck!”
Steve glared at his masked attacker over their joined hands. It would have been so easy to break this person’s wrist; just a snap of his hand, and their bones would splinter like dry kindling.
on his computer, but to hell with his taxes and his medical shit; he’d curated that Superman photo collection close to two decades! Many of those pictures weren’t even available anymore.
“Snore snore snore,” Hammer drawled sarcastically. “So the guy had a penchant for male nurses, big deal. They roleplayed a little, took each other’s temperature, spiced up the week. It’s not a crime, detective. It’s a little weird, but it’s not suspicious.”
“How’d you sleep, Tony?” Steve asked, watching Tony with curious interest. The way he clung and cuddled, the soft little sounds he made, it all painted a picture of childlike innocence that Steve couldn’t quite believe.
Tony instinctively placed the shirt back on the bed and put his hands behind his back. If only he’d kept his hands to himself at the fitting.
Tony was just beginning to question his own priorities in life for leaving Steve’s skin perfectly unblemished when a quick flash from the TV screen reflected in the gold ring dangling on a chain around Steve’s neck.
Bruce held up the tablet in his hand and opened his mouth to speak when a polite voice sounded from Tony's phone. “Mellow greetings, Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark. How may I be of service this morning?”
Steve sat up, strong enough to sit up even with Tony leaning over him. He gathered Tony up in his arms then turned him so Tony faced away from him on his hands and knees. With one hand planted between Tony’s shoulder blades to push his face down into the mattress, Steve pinned him in place so he could take his time taking stock of Tony’s ass. He sucked on his thumb until it came away wet with his spit, and with no other lubrication, Steve pressed his thumb into Tony, going slowly and with care.
But it was one thing to tempt himself with the memory of Tony’s keening moans and gasping demands, of his strong thighs and his sinful lips. It was another thing entirely to do so with a video featuring Tony’s best friend and half a dozen helpful grandmas. Steve left the remainder of the video unwatched and husseled himself into a cold shower before bed.
“Steve, sweetheart,” Tony said in a slow, quiet tone, the same voice he used to put anxious horses at ease. “There are five hunting dogs and four hunters in this house. No person or animal is dumb enough to try.”
“Steve?” Tony asked then, taking Steve by the shoulders. Steve’s gaze snapped up from where it had caught on Tony’s strong, lean thighs, and he blushed full force at the first realization of what he’d been doing. Had Tony noticed? Was that what he was worried about?
“Easy, Steve—what’s; you’ll choke, babe,” Tony said in gentle, soothing words that Steve wanted to hug to his face and dance with forever. Tony’s voice was so beautiful and it was the best sound in the world.
So, in the relative privacy of Sharon at least pretending not to look, he clicked his way to the lace garter tights. It wasn’t even real lace or real garters, it was
Tony blinked in surprise at the question. That was such a basic fact, and yet he wasn’t sure of the answer. Without thinking, he looked at Steve, and two important thoughts occurred to him. One, for all intents and purposes, Steve was the last person to save him on this one. Two, did he always look at Steve when he didn’t have the answer to something?
“I never meant for it to be this way,” Tony promised, even pulling his hands back to firmly plant them on his knees before he made a grab for him. “I swear, it was—it was meant to be quick, two dates, maybe three; it wasn’t supposed to be—”
Steve was sure his heart had stopped beating and dropped to somewhere in the vicinity of the asthenosphere, and unable to think of anything to say, he helplessly watched Tony and Bucky lock into the staring contest of the century.
Tony’s words gave Steve pause. He wasn’t frustrated or impatient; he wasn’t even offended. Tony sounded
“Not through the walls,” Steve admitted with a little shrug of his broad shoulders. “But you’d been on the same half sheet of paperwork for forty minutes, and my birthday is on Thursday. Stealth never was your strong suit, Stark.”
“We’ll teach you everything you’ll ever need to know, darling,” Tony’s mom promised, rubbing a comforting hand up and down Steve’s arm. “You can call me Maria.”
The euphoric chemical cocktail of Tony’s orgasm shot through the sleeve and directly into Steve’s bloodstream, pumping his body with the addictive rush of norepinephrine, serotonin, and oxytocin. The release of his own orgasm was only secondary to the high of Tony’s chemistry, and Steve groaned through his teeth in his overwhelming pleasure. He rocked and rolled his hips against Tony’s for every drop, neither pulling out or changing their position. The longer Tony lay under him with his ass turned up, the more of Steve’s come could be absorbed into Tony’s bloodstream.
If Steve had a sentimental heart, it would have melted. “You mean you’re not sick of me?” he half-joked, earning himself a smack on the knee.
“Thank you for telling me, Steve. For your trust in me,” he whispered, brushing his lips over Steve’s in a soft, adoring kiss. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you. I’m grateful you were strong enough. Grateful you survived, to have you in my life.”
It wasn’t a threat Steve would ever follow through with, but Tony heard him all the same. Taking a bath together had been his idea, after all, and the least he could do was to not make Steve’s puzzle any tougher than it already was. He reached for Steve’s left hand and brought it to his lips for a grateful, adoring kiss.
The next morning, Tony found Steve dressed in his uniform and sitting on his couch, stress knitting. Eight or nine thick, woolen socks of varying colors already littered the coffee table, and it looked like he was working on to a checkered blanket when Tony found him.
“I work for the government,” Steve said, casting around for answers that Tony might swallow. “It’s classified, but mostly my job is… dealing with international negotiations that other people don’t want to deal with. It’s tedious, but I get great miles.”
The truck came to an immediate, screeching stop. Steve’s heart had stopped beating the moment he’d seen Dummy stumble forward, and he almost broke the car door in his hurry to climb out.
“Then earlier tonight,” Steve said with reluctant finality as he laid out a photograph of the third murder. Another young woman who couldn’t have been more than 30, so full of life for someone so pale. “Page 34 of Sweeping Tide.”
His acceptance came so easily Steve didn’t see it coming. He ducked his head before Tony caught him looking like spellbound schoolboy on his first date and focused on stabbing his lukewarm broccoli instead.
“Right,” Tony agreed, counting off on his fingers, “his clenching jaw, kissing without consent as a sign of jealousy, being territorial. It’s everyday stuff that people ignore, but they’re important warning signs.”
“This is stunning, Steve Rogers,” he whispered, turning it over in his hands. “The attention to detail, the craftsmanship—you truly are a gifted man.”
“You showed me a part of how you celebrate Christmas, Tony,” Steve said to his very willing captive. “Before we sleep, I want to show you one way that my family celebrated, before the war. It won’t take long—”
Clint nickered quietly as he considered Tony’s question. He glanced at the closed door of the quiet little cottage, then looked at him with something akin to a smile. “Well. You opened the door to a stranger in the storm, didn’t you?”
Two days later, Tony and Clint were released back in Tony’s swamp in advance of Stephanie’s ceremony with Chief Talia.
Numb and speechless, Tony stared as Steve reached behind his neck and unclasped the gold chain himself. He turned Tony’s hand over and placed the ring into Tony’s open palm. Tony had never seen Steve take it off before, so it took him some time before he mustered enough sense to actually look at the gold band in his hand.
Tony’s smile faded and he blinked at him in confusion, and it wasn’t until Steve noticed the clear look of hurt in Tony’s expression that he realized his mistake.
“Alright, let’s do it,” she agreed with a ready competitiveness. “Tony: do you know what Steve’s first role in a movie was? Any movie.”
“Oh, thank god,” Steve sighed with a breath of grateful relief, only to immediately catch himself. “Oh, no. No, Steven, not good,” he mumbled to himself, but by the time he tried to stop Bucky, Bucky was nowhere to be seen.
He blindly walked around his office to grab his computer bag when the door gently closed behind him.
“Go turn on the lights and come back to me,” Tony told him, giving him a gentle shove in his shoulder. “Fuck me with your uniform on, soldier.”
The weekend passed in a blur. Steve moved back into the old two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn that he and his mom moved into after his father left. Everything important in his childhood had happened under that roof. He came out to his mom in his childhood room; she kept him and Bucky company every day at the kitchen table while they did their homework.  He’d walked in through the door with his head held high and gold medals around his neck from state and national competitions, and sat and sobbed against the same door the first time he thought he had a boyfriend, but was told wasn’t a good enough kisser.
“Uh, okay. Alright,” he sighed eventually. “I’m from Oklahoma, outside Tulsa. I moved up for college, been here ever since. Eight years now.”
“My feelings for you haven’t changed, sweetheart. I would never break my promise to you if it was not out of concern for your safety.”
“Now that’s not fair! That’s—there’s a lot of positions to learn in yoga,” Tony said in Colin’s defense, “you’re asking a lot of a man, Graham. You ask an average guy to do Chaturanga Dandasana, dollars to donuts, he won’t have a clue what you mean. But Colin knows.”
“I think what Thor is trying to say is that there’s something wrong with this man,” Bruce said from his comfortable spot at Tony’s desk. “Maybe it’s time to cut our losses?”
He looked away and took a deep breath to steady himself. “Formal decisions. Communicating with the court when I wanted to join an internship intended for older students. My social workers. They didn’t treat me like I’m different.”
“Not an option, partner. Where you go, I go. Come on,” he said as he grabbed Steve’s offered hand and helped haul Steve to his feet.
Tony would try to back up, try to find the words to say no, except he knew from the beginning that he wouldn't have been able to deny Steve anything again after leaving him in the hospital after their first win. He couldn’t bring himself to say no, but he would physically try to put space between them, backing away from the center of the ring with Steve in cautious pursuit, backing away until he had nowhere to go.  And once he inevitably caught up, Steve would gently take Tony's face in his sweaty, wrapped up hands, and brush his lips chastely over Tony's, asking for permission. The moment Tony gave any indication of responding to the little tentative kiss positively, Steve would immediately shifts gears, giving it his all to show Tony how he feels with his kiss, his hands, his whole body. He'd make quick work of turning Tony around, pushing him up against the ropes and jerking Tony's pants own over his perky ass, barely even down his thighs. Kick his feet farther apart while he's pouring out a palm-full of the body oil they'd been using hours ago for the cameras to make Steve’s body shiny and attractive for photos and video, using it now in excess to slick his hands and fingers. Tony's pants and briefs would quickly become a mess from all that spilled off Steve's hand, but greased up as his hand was, Steve’d work his fingers into Tony in such a rush in what he had assumed would be perfunctory prep. Except, contrary to what Steve assumed, Tony hadn’t been in a relationship with anyone, Rhodey or otherwise, and he needed more time than Steve first thought. And while it could just be that Tony was tight - he was fit after all, he kept active at work, it wouldn't be impossible - but driven by his lust Steve would draw the conclusion that he prefers, that Tony wasn’t being fucked regularly, so he could not be in a relationship with Rhodey. The possessive side of him just hungered  to take him hard, making Tony hurt, making sure Tony couldn’t think of anyone else once Steve was done with him. Make sure Tony would remember Steve every time he moved tomorrow, and the day after that. He’d shove Tony away from the center and spread obscenely over the ropes, with one knee braced against a middle rope to keep his body open for Steve. A slick hand would come around to jerk him off, Steve's hand wet enough with the oil that it would just drip down his cock, down his balls, smear across his abs, with Steve purposefully working to undo Tony over and over again without letting him come, squeezing the base of his cock so tight that Tony wouldn't find any release  But Steve would come several times, using Tony for his own pleasure, taking his cue from their only other time together when Tony had sucked his cock and jerked Steve off across his face; a man like that would be turned on from being used and filthy with come.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, in honor of your arrival, and your protection of the sanctity of human life, namely my own, I wish for you to join me for dinner tonight. The both of you,” he added with a pointed look at Tony that practically left Steve’s steward swooning. “I insist. You must accompany me to Taco Bell this evening.”
“Don’t brush it off, Tony. I think there is a need, your questions are important. I’ve been thinking about it, too, actually,” Steve admitted, and in his curiosity, Tony perked up enough to meet Steve’s steady gaze.
The self-important asshole hadn’t felt a meeting time was necessary, but told Tony he’d send him an email once he was free to meet with him. He didn’t want to give the guy an excuse to say Tony hadn’t done his job well, so he couldn’t make any plans to see Steve or his friends at MIT.
“I meant what I said,” he said quietly, and Steve turned in his seat so he was facing Tony, reaching out for him to urge him closer. Tony obliged easily, standing between Steve’s knees. The fifteen pounds of muscle he’d put on already had mostly concentrated in his legs and he barely fit there anymore, but Steve adjusted easily by sliding closer to the edge of the chair and spreading his knees to accommodate Tony’s bigger size.
“I’m here, too, you know,” Steve groused to himself under his breath, making a point to step on a particularly crunch leaf on the pavement. The walk to the subway station wasn’t even that long, but being left out of the conversation sure had a way of making five blocks feel like an eternity.
One after another he served the students as they practiced fingering him open and fucking him to fill their canisters. The suction cup over his cock helped distract Tony through the worst of them and kept the cushions he rested on fairly clean, but thankfully most of the students were simply forgettable. The majority were even unable to get through it without Steve’s intervention and guidance. The most successful student had the power to inflate its joints, and Tony had keened like a wounded animal as he was fucked with three long fingers, each shaped like thick, beaded dildos. Steve had been so impressed with that harvester’s potential that he had rolled Tony over and briefly removed the suction cup to allow the student to practice using the canister as a cock sleeve and jerk off a male Terran for his ejaculate. That was the only student who filled 100 percent of their canister, and Tony almost teared up to see them walk away.
“You do,” Steve said eventually, speaking so quietly that Tony almost missed it. He moaned quietly in protest, and he wanted to tell Steve to speak up, but his lips were so heavy, and he was so comfortable. He’d just close his eyes first, only for a minute.
Steve straightened and spun to face Natasha with well practiced charm. He found her standing close enough that the scent of her perfume filled his senses, a spicy, intoxicating spell he could find himself falling under given half a chance.
“You’re not wrong, you know,” Steve murmured after a long silence. “I’ve wanted you in my bed since you spent five minutes solving a problem that would have stumped my IT department for days. I’ve wanted to devote hours to kissing you since you chose a farmer’s market over designer pastries. But… since you took me in, I don’t know what I want anymore.”
“Except he’s one of the smartest people I know so it’s not easy to throw him off when he’s got a lead. We were digging through everything ever published or released about Bruce for ten hours today. Do you know how hard it is to hide evidence when your partner’s right next to you? He’s going to figure out who Bruce is any day now… I think the only reason he hasn’t put it together yet is because it’s such a big leap to go from Bruce to Batman.”
“Don’t. Don’t argue about the food,” Tony told him, setting the pizzas down on Patrick’s cleared desk. He kept looking around the room in his curiosity while still gravitating towards Steve, until he could weasel his way into Steve’s arms without looking away from all the scattered mementos and clues into Steve’s life that he otherwise rarely witnessed.
“Hey, why don’t I help you with that?” Clint told Steve as he walked around the dining table in the kitchen, pulling out a big serving plate and grabbing a second pan off the rack to take over half of Steve’s work. “How’re you doing them? Scrambled?”
“Trust me and enjoy the scenery for twenty more minutes, Tony. Please? We can fight in thirty minutes, but we’ll be there in twenty.”
Steve gentled his grip and eased Tony back onto the mattress to lean over him, braced on his hands and knees to press a soft kiss to Tony’s forearm. “Babe?” he whispered softly in his concern. “Is it, um. You okay?”
“Registration,” Steve explained simply, and draped an arm around Tony’s waist in an effort to make him feel safe. “Anyone might try to take a prize like you away from me, Tony, and I can’t have that.”
Steve went willingly as Tony reeled him in, melting into him with a gentle, tentative kiss. A delirious smile overtook Tony but he didn’t let it stop him from opening to Steve’s kiss, moaning softly in encouragement. He eased back into the couch until the full weight of Steve’s body pressed him into the firm cushions and Tony could bend his legs around Steve’s body to cradle him between his thighs. Steve’s hips jerked up instinctively under the familiar squeeze of Tony’s legs, grinding his growing erection against Tony’s until he caught it just right and Tony choked on a breath, moaning into the kiss, ever so eager for more.
“The whole state isn’t Malibu,” Steve drawled, then in a firmer tone, he said, “and unless you want a clean shave, Tony, stop moving.”
Steve turned towards Tony and nodded in acknowledgement. He finished the fight he was caught in by snatching the two villains by their throats and clobbering their heads into the wall. Around them, the Scraps were winning the fight, and Steve stepped over dead and unconscious bodies alike to reach Tony.
A small smile tugged at the corner of Steve’s lips when his mom mentioned his dad. He could almost imagine the kitchen the way it looked when he was a child, when his mom would be on the phone with her friends for hours, and his dad would sit next to her at the kitchen table reading the paper, looking for all the world like he hadn’t heard a peep until he chimed in to fill in a forgotten name or detail in Sarah’s stories.
His thoughts got no further before shame washed over him in a cold sweat. Hell, if he’d be honest, he’d rather just take the sheet cake and fork for himself and eat his sorrows away.
Except watching it live, that look wasn’t the tawdry, lascivious glance the picture made it out to be. Even with that wailing voice of jealousy crying for dominance in his heart, Steve easily recognized the bid for support in Channing’s eyes when he glanced across at Tony, and the reassurance offered by Tony when he smiled back.
“No more than a prop,” Steve murmured to her as she stepped around to hold Sitwell’s door open for him.
Rhodes turned his attention to Steve, who was cold and shivering and broken, and no more cooperative than his best friend.
“Doesn’t mean you don’t have a type. Like, look at that guy,” he said, elbowing Steve harder than necessary to point out a guy across the street. “You should be all over him. Dark hair, tight jeans, ass like—”
“It’s been years,” Steve said under his breath, keeping his eyes turned down as he spoke. It was easier to find the words if he looked at Tony’s chest rather than meeting his eyes. “I never liked… never, I guess, really had anyone I thought—I mean,” he cleared his throat and tried again. “I know it can be good, and I think it could, with you. I want to try it, bottoming,” he finally managed to say, even if in a whisper. “For you. I trust you.”
“Nick Giordani. Amy Nguyen. Tara Jones,” Steve said their names slowly as he laid out blown up copies of their drivers license photos, giving each of them the firm emphasis they deserved. “Do any of them ring a bell?”
Steve didn’t stop to answer him. The figures were moving quickly, and like some gastronomic horror film, there was no quick exit from Taco Bell.
“I lift?” Steve tried at first, but then shrugged it off. This was one lie he didn’t want to say. “I don’t always eat like that, Tony. It’s been… it’s been a week. The week’s been hell, I have Wayne on my mind all the time, and then you and, and the kiss. And we haven’t talked about it. It’s… I want to talk about it. It’s important to me, Tony,” he added more adamantly. “You’re important to me.”
“I’m afraid I was held up and fell out of an airplane without a parachute,” Steve murmured softly, “Sharon, you know I’ll never stray. And how beautiful you are today, a feast for my eyes.”
“Could we look at the juvenile menu?” Tony asked before Steve had a chance to answer, and the young woman quickly complied.
Steve had been about to bite into his burger when Tony raised a toast, and scrambled to drop the burger and scoop up his glass to raise his glass and second Tony’s words.
, gonna leave you gaping, leaking my come, and aching so good, sweetheart, aching for me to fill you. Think they’ll notice?” Steve whispered then with a covetous drawl. “The way you walk… how you sit? Everyone will see then, Tony, everyone will know—”
“No, we concluded the day early,” Tony said with a smile and scooted his armchair closer. “In the spirit of ‘my husband deserves to stop studying and start celebrating Christmas.’”
Steve kept his mouth shut the rest of the way to the Ranger’s team store, where Tony finally peeled himself off of Steve and instead tugged him into the store in his excitement.
Tony, on the other hand, was too shaken to deal with people. He needed silence, and he needed time to think. So he hoisted his work for the day onto Pepper, rescheduled everything that he couldn’t give to her, then made himself comfortable on the couch with a couple of blankets, a bottle of wine, and a stack of research journals he’d been meaning to read.
“I never thought I’d meet a guy like you, Tony,” Steve murmured softly, only loud enough for Tony’s ears to register his words, but not so loud that the young man startled awake. “But I always wanted it to be like this.”
“You get huffy and short-tempered when you’re sleep deprived, check,” Steve said with a teasing lilt in his voice. Tony could just feel the pleasant amusement radiating off of him even from the polite distance Steve kept, and if he didn’t know any better, he’d be convinced Steve’s charm was feeding off of his stamina like some predatory energy vacuum.
Tony blinked a few times in his confusion, but he considered the question carefully before answering. “There is no precedent for it or against it. Would that make you more comfortable, Steve Rogers?”
Without another word, Bruce and Tony fall into step behind the Chief Director. A van waited for them outside the station to take them directly to the Cryo-Prison, lights flashing the whole way to avoid all traffic.
“Stop it, go on,” Steve preened with false modesty; Tony cracked up and almost lost his train of thought.
“You’re—you’re breaking up with me because you don’t think you can be a gay politician?” Steve echoed in disgust. No sooner had reality sunk in than Steve’s tears overwhelmed him, streaming down his face. “And you’ve known this the whole time we’ve been together? All the time you told me you loved me, you were ‘dicking around’? That’s all I’ve been to you, something fun to play with until you wanted a serious life?”
While Tony had learned that many pets were given their own space to live and rest, Steve had never taken that step. Tony was kept in Steve’s nest, and whether they were both tired or not, they would always rest together. It had taken Tony’s circadian rhythm some time to adapt to a world with two suns, and by the second week, they both transition to a life lived in blocks of roughly six Earth-hours at a time: six hours awake, six hours asleep, and repeat.
“No, not at all,” Steve grinned, and taking Tony’s hand in his own again after the security check, he led the way to the escalators with a newfound eagerness. “It’s only going to make my surprise better.”
“They were short conversations, sure, but you left everybody smiling. Every day you were on set was brighter because of you.”
“Yes,” Steve answered on a soft breath before Tony even had to ask. Permission given, Tony closed the space between them and claimed Steve’s lips with a hungry kiss, with eager teeth and needful moans that formed Steve’s name. He pushed at Steve’s knees with his elbows until he relaxed his legs from his comfortable seated position, and made it easier for Tony to get his jeans undone.
“Don’t you dare pretend she isn’t hot,” Tony narrowed his eyes in anger, and if Tony wasn’t so stressed, Steve would have argued the point just for fun. Instead, he held up his hands in a show of surrender and gestured for Tony to continue.
Steve had felt larger than life somehow, an unbridled spirit unlike anything Tony had experienced. Sure, he was a far cry from Mr. Right, but Tony would have loved to have known Steve better as a friend. He refused to accept that Steve’s was one of the nineteen lives claimed in the attack.
“Do you understand how difficult it is to live with someone who won’t eat?” she asked rhetorically, a smile clear in her voice.
“I’m your housewife,” Steve murmured, his wet lips brushing over Tony’s bare skin as he spoke, though comparing himself to a housewife didn’t seem to bother him much.
When Tony only shook his head and tried to brush it off, Steve pushed back a little and gently asked, “What’ve you got to lose?”
His friend was nowhere to be seen when he turned around to find her, and it wasn’t until he was out in the hallway that he turned around and caught her handing Professor Hawley a file and accepting Steve’s resume in return for a curious sniff.
He took another look around the room, and found himself corrected. There wasn’t a body in every chair.
“Here I am complaining about my license to conceive when you—I mean,” he suddenly stuttered to backtrack, desperate to avoid saying the words out loud. “And you were in such a warm mood when I first arrived! What was on your mind on this pleasant Monday morning, Tony Stark?”
“You know, he made the most amazing cinnamon rolls the first night I stayed at his place,” Tony told his brother immediately. “Maple coffee glaze—it was out of this world.”
Heads turned in his wake and people who noticed him coming stopped to stare as Steve passed. The armor never failed to impress, and the satisfaction kept Steve smiling and relatively warm the whole way to the party.
“With all due respect, fuck you and your bullshit,” Steve told Fury without so much as a second’s thought. “You are going to be stop excluding people from the peace and dignity, and let people live, while you,” he said, addressing Bucky, “will work with Natasha to help your people adapt. They have some great ideas, Buck, they really do. But people won’t trust New Yorseylvanian’s without your leadership. You’ll meet somewhere in the middle, and you’ll figure it out.”
“Sorry,” Jane giggled, snorting softly with every inhale. “But Tony, come on. Who are you trying to convince? I don’t know what’s more depressing: Sylvia Plath or your love-life. You don’t leave your workshop, you don’t let friends set you up, and when we do manage to trick you into it, you always fixate on some stupid problem so you don’t have to see them again. You didn’t like the last guy because his palms were sweaty, remember?”
When a kiss wasn’t forthcoming, Tony took a further step back. “Are you hungry? I’m about to have dinner, there’s enough for two,” he explained as he led the way to his kitchen. “Baked chicken, mac and cheese, some greens.”
Tony opened and closed his mouth, pursing his lips a little as he thought. Then, with a curious kind of hope, he tried, “Sparky?”
“Then let’s make one up. I trust you, Tony. I have from the start,” Steve reminded him with a meaningful look. “You already have your willing sacrifice, isn’t that half the battle?”
“Buck?” he grunted softly as he pushed himself upright in bed. Something was off, and Steve was alert at once. If only he remembered where he’d scattered his clothes the night before. “What’s going on?”
Panting for air and still fucking Steve’s mouth chasing those last, delirious seconds of euphoria, Tony could have sworn he saw stars. The strength in his grip bled away, releasing Steve’s hair and giving him the freedom to pull off his softening cock at any time, but Steve barely budged, dutifully swallowing down every last gush of come. Tony barely had the presence of mind to open his eyes and take in the erotic masterpiece that was Steve’s spit-slick, swollen lips after a blowjob.
Steve jogged across the road, then came to an awkward stop in front of him. He tried to smile, but Tony only nodded in greeting.
“I should go,” Tony whispered. He could barely meet Steve’s gaze anymore, and the sudden shift from the confident, motivated Tony Stark to this bashful, anxious man left Steve wishing he could do more.
“Tony,” Steve tried, scrambling for something meaningful to say. You couldn’t tell Tony what to do, he’d only get more stubborn. Clint looked worried, and so did their mother, though she seemed better about concealing it with her anger.
“What am I doing here?” Steve repeated, pausing only long enough to remind himself that Tony was under a lot of stress and he had not come to the lab to add to Tony’s stress.  “Sweetheart, I haven’t heard from you in two days. You’re not answering my texts, that’s not like you. I was worried.”
Steve couldn’t take his eyes off of Tony if he tried. Mesmerized, Steve watched Tony writhe and moan through his extended orgasm, his body slumping forward as if all his strength had suddenly abandoned him. Steve continued milking Tony’s cock and fucking him through his climax with two fingers, curling his fingers to massage his prostate through to the end.
“You, uh,” Tony started to say, only realizing in the moment that maybe he should have prepared a thoughtful way of explaining what had happened since Steve was put in Cryo. “Captain—”
“Water, please,” Tony called after him, and he toed his shoes off and made himself comfortable in the corner section of the couch by the time Steve came back with two water bottles and sat down beside him.
Beautiful as it had looked in jeans only hours earlier, something wasn’t quite the same. Tony’s ass felt firm and round to the touch, but the soft, ample cushion Steve had so often indulged in spanking or biting wasn’t as prominent anymore as the strong muscles Tony had no doubt developed from physical work.
“Don't talk yourself out of it,” Steve recited reluctantly. “They are meeting with you for a reason, you don’t know what that reason is. Bring your best to the table, and let them decide.”
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, you are fined five credits for a violation of verbal morality statute 1-1-3.”
The video ended with David smiling and waving at the camera to encourage his daughter to do the same. Clutching Mr. Fang to her chest, Harper smiled bashfully at the camera and waved good-bye.
“I don’t,” Tony tried to explain as he panted for breath. “I don’t like so, so many kisses in the morning.”
“No teaching experience, only a year out of grad school…” Tony continued, half-aware of his own words. His focus was mesmerizing, and Steve almost felt the need to evacuate the whole cafe just so he could study Tony’s handsome profile and the allure of his slightly parted lips in private.
In reality, Tony hadn’t spent that long in the blistering Boston cold. Between the blanket and Steve’s help, he quickly warmed up, but that didn’t mean Steve had to know. After three weeks apart, Tony would risk overheating if it meant having Steve’s hands on him again.
The Scraps and both Steve and Tony turned to stare at the man bleeding all over himself from his broken nose.
Tony had just pulled his sweats on when Steve knocked on his door and let himself in. He had two laptop bags slung over his shoulders.
Tony peered up at him still, cupping Steve’s face and studying it with concern. Eventually, he must have been convinced that Steve wasn’t ill or dying, or both, and he stepped back to give Steve some space and to glance at his phone. Rather than relief, Steve had to stifle a quiet sigh of regret at the renewed distance.
Steve shrugged as he typed out his reply. “Who knows? It’s Tony. All he needs is some drone and he can watch us remotely.”
It turned out that Maria kept her promises. Gossip surrounding first-year law students at Harvard weren’t usually this juicy and unproblematic: people were either caught in terrible acts of entitlement, or they were making headlines for remarkable contributions to public policy. Controversial romance between two men on opposite sides of a case was just enough low-stakes excitement that nobody thought twice about having an opinion.
The truck was barreling down a country road at speeds Steve didn’t dare to look at. He was grabbing on to his seat and door handle like his life depended on it, because he was genuinely afraid it would. Still,  he forced himself to a smile at her.
“Let us look at it for two minutes,” one of them dared to tell him, as if they hadn’t already spent twenty minutes poking at the four devices Steve had brought in for testing. “This is a simple problem—”
“‘s Bost’n,” he mumbled as he twisted onto his side with a sigh and a sleepy yawn. He looked tired, but determined not to give in to the seductive promises of sleep.
, which neither of them had ever heard of before in their lives, but now clearly couldn’t live without.
,” Tony snarled. “‘All men’ couldn’t care less about me. All I care about is me and my swamp. My life is good in my swamp, it’s peaceful; quiet. Or it was, until
Sweat broke out across Tony’s forehead. He watched as Steve Rogers scanned the people sitting at the bar over Jane’s shoulder until Tony caught his eye.
“Say hi to Violet,” Georgie said with a big smile. “She is a Great Dane and Greyhound mix, but she’s just an oversized cuddlebug, and we’re told there’s nothing she likes more than a nap.”
He promised they only required six months of him. He would come back to New York then, one way or another. He promised he’d come back for Steve.
By the time he was back to his room and climbing the stairs to his fifth floor suite, it was late enough that people were flitting through the hallway, chattering and saying their goodbyes before bed.
Steve was no better. He hadn’t moved in all this time, and only in the unnatural stalemate did Tony notice he’d been gaping at him through the whole fight.
It hurt to see the determination in Steve’s kind, loving eyes and know there was nothing either of them could do.
“Don’t you dare, Tony,” Steve said immediately. His husband frowned then pouted in reply. “I’m scheduled to work seventy days this year, you work over three hundred days. I can stand to work more. Please don’t argue,” Steve finished more quietly, “It is important to me that I do this well.”
“I have more money than I know what to do with! Spending it with you makes me happy, you said you understood—”
“Doesn’t give me hives,” Steve interrupted him to say. Tony clicked his mouth shut, and he even held his breath to give Steve absolute silence to encourage him to continue sharing. Color rose in Steve’s cheeks and up the back of his neck, until finally he glanced away and mumbled, “And maybe… maybe it’s alright.”
Steve looked genuinely confused this time, and he sat up to grab his wristwatch off the bedside table. “They’re up at 5am?” he wondered, dubious.
Silence answered him from the closet. Steve took one step out and stared across his dorm room at him, stone faced. “What.”
Tony stared back at him like a fish out of water. How uncivilized had the 21st been to not use the three seashells?
Tony grinned up at Steve’s regretful tone and brought Steve’s hand up to brush a quick kiss across his cold fingers. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Steve. I did everything I wanted: four days with the hadron collider at CERN, and four nights with the hardon collider at—”
- until he got to a short stack of four letters that felt unusually malicious. “These… made me uncomfortable. Top one especially.”
“This is the most quiet she’s been, but since your excursion Harper absolutely delights in telling all of us about your trip to the zoo,” Victoria said, from behind the camera this time. “Thank you again, you saved the day!”
“I love this job and I can afford to rent an apartment - a flat - in South Kensington,” Tony drawled. “It’s a studio, but it’s mine. Unless you voted for Trump, I don’t care if you work for the Devil himself.”
“Can’t it be both?” Steve wondered innocently. His words caught Tony off guard, and his moan fizzled out with a sudden laugh. Above him, Tony could feel Steve laughing softly with him, and he reached for him blindly, dragging him down for a kiss.
Steve clapped a hand over Tony’s mouth and stopped dead in his tracks. The uninvited touch of a stranger - and a stranger who had just slid down a grimy ladder into the sewers, no less - was enough to make Tony want to scream, but he choked down his reactionary alarm and tried to focus.
The question caught Steve by surprise, and he straightened enough to put distance between their lips. It was almost enough for Tony to regret his question.
Icey chills washed over Bruce’s neck when he heard Fury’s reply from only a few feet away. “Your presence is deemed necessary, Lieutenant, in the event that this 21st century animal is incapable of civilized speech. For once, Lieutenant Tony Stark’s vulgar pursuits of leisure may stand to our advantage.”
“Damn. I knew the man was big, but I didn’t think… damn,” Tony said a little breathlessly. “Did you try to bench him?”
“Stop—stop that, Steve! Steve, lie down!” Tony told him through the laughter, pushing Steve back into his sweet, fluffy nest and tucking him back into his cocoon. “Cotton candy is magical, yes, but you need to rest, okay?”
“No, sugar, I’ve been looking forward to this all day,” Tony said with as much conviction as he could muster. “I’ve been looking forward to
“Tony, what is going on?” Rhodey wondered, and he held up his phone to add, “Your messages sounded serious, and now your, you’re, you…”
Tony pressed his lips together in a clear effort not to laugh, and as Bucky started through the crowd to lead the way, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist and pressed in close to his side. Steve lifted his arm to hug Tony close and bring him in closer.
