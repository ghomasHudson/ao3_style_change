Janine smirks. “He’s my foster brother. He gave me the necklace. It was right under your nose and you didn’t realise, mister.”
Her stammering makes John smile. Later, after remembering how good it feels to stretch his legs, Molly surprises him a second time by retrieving a book from her bag. The author, M. R. James, isn’t familiar, and when Molly explains it is Victorian gothic fiction, a ghost story, John knows the reason for that.
Mycroft’s features soften into something worse – pity. “Regret is such a nasty sentiment. Poisons one’s every waking thought. Correct me if I’m wrong, Doctor Watson, but last I checked it takes two willing participants for a wedding.”
Mycroft’s voice brings him back to harsh reality. “Mrs Watson is en route to a secure holding facility near London. The baby is perfectly fine, yet I’m afraid the extension of visitation rights will have to wait.”
“Oh, I see. Your mother’s tendency to –” Sherlock had begun, but a clipped “Don’t,” from John cut off any deductions being said out loud. It’s annoying enough that Sherlock knows all about John’s parents without being told; no need for him to dwell on it.
“You don’t need to read it now.” Molly hesitates. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. He says… Jo-John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help …”
He never deleted the building’s layout, so it’s barely any challenge to plan a route that won’t leave them too vulnerable to surprise attacks as well as take them to the rooms most likely to be used for hostages first. John follows his lead without hesitation or question, causing something warm to unfurl inside Sherlock’s chest.
“Perhaps. Captain John Watson,” he introduces himself. “I’m here with Detective Sherlock Holmes. Were you here last night?”
The older Holmes gives the faintest smirk. “You of all people must have realised, John, that Moriarty’s preoccupation with my brother escapes the confines of logic. If someone were to kill my brother right now, I assure you Moriarty’s revenge would make the earth quiver.”
“Is everything okay?” he asks loud enough for the absolutely inconspicuous group of ‘relatives’ at the table next to his to overhear.
It’s not until the older Holmes is almost at the front door that John’s body remembers what it’s supposed to do.
The first bullet rips into the person’s – the woman’s hand, making her drop the gun, the second hits their right knee. Surprise coupled with pain brings her down with a grunt of agony. John is on her a heartbeat later, pushing her right shoulder towards the ground with one hand and pressing down with his entire body weight. Her evasive manoeuvres speak of expert training but what John lacks in technique he makes up in for in pure anger.
The screen remains black but someone is whimpering – female, late teens. An abrupt cut shows Moriarty from the chest up, wearing charcoal Westwood and a smirk.
The light is bright but his reaction appears satisfactory. Sherlock makes to remove the needle of the IV but John’s hand on his bare forearm stops him. Sherlock barely hears the reason why John wants to keep it in – his attention has narrowed to the places of contact.
“You seem to be operating under the illusion that you wield any kind of power over my person, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft sneers. “I do not, in fact, answer to you.”
John’s reply has to be non-verbal for Sherlock doesn’t even hear a murmur. His own tongue is in knots; his throat tight.
“How did you find us?” John asks, not looking at Sherlock because he doesn’t trust his facial muscles just yet.
John retrieves the disc from his laptop, labelled with the specified code in his scrawl. The Secret Service requires a written report after every single one of John’s visits since Mary’s stipulation forbids them from recording their meetings. Said report is then fed into the vast intelligence machine his country is operating while the physical disc becomes a meal for the shredder.
John says nothing. Rage is boiling right underneath the surface of his skin, one spark away from erupting. It is a sight to behold.
“But you’re powerless,” John says, clarity dawning on him. “That’s the ‘truth of the matter’, right? How long’s this been going on?”
John jerks back at the sound of Moriarty’s voice, an auditory proof for the man’s thus far theoretical survival. Sherlock’s reaction remains internal, ‘MISS ME’s swirling in front of his mind’s eyes.
There is no time for conscious thought, just instinct. John slams into Sherlock’s back, tackling him onto the ground and shielding his body with his own.
There is an appreciative gleam in Sherlock’s eyes that makes John’s chest swell a bit. “Hypotheses number one and two.”
“Listen, Anthea, or whatever the hell your name is,” John snaps. “My best friend’s just been shot – your employer's brother – and what I need is to go to hospital.”
He watches the squirrels in St James’s Park until the sun has risen fully, then passes through Hyde Park and watches people instead. Ordinary people, going about their ordinary lives. To think, once upon a time, John thought nothing ever happened to him.
It’s pointless to argue with Sherlock when he’s in full detective mode, so John just slumps back in his seat and pays the exorbitant cab fare they raked up, coming back all the way from Ealing. Fortunately, the increased case load since Sherlock’s return from hospital means their account is flush with cash for the time being.
The other Watson’s voice echoes in his head. “He didn’t want a drink… he needed one. He’s not embarrassed; he’s afraid.”
Mycroft looks like he bit into a particularly sour lemon. “There is a charity event at the Ritz he will attend.”
“If that’s toff speak for pissed, then yeah.” John steps back into the hall to let the man enter. “I’d offer you some, but I finished it all.”
The thought of Mary cooing over ultrasound readouts, pretending they’re living in a bubble of marital bliss… John can’t suppress the shudder that image evokes.
Sherlock blinks. Watches Molly go back into the house. He doesn’t remember the way from the door to the cab. Once tucked into the back seat, he produces the note, unfolding it carefully.
“Enter,” James says after a beat. John turns away from the door to hide his face until he has schooled his features again.
“I made a vow, John,” Sherlock whispers, “and I stand by it. We will find her before anyone can take revenge. I promise.”
The implications of Magnussen’s words register, but it’s like looking through tainted glass – he gets only an impression. John stares at whom he thought is the person he will spend the rest of his life with, and what he sees doesn’t make sense.
The doctor on call arrives before John has a chance to look up. For all of Sherlock’s mental prowess, he is unable to deduce just what he would have seen in John’s eyes.
right now,” John barks, much to Mrs Hudson’s dismay. Sherlock doesn’t seem to hear him, which only adds another layer of urgency to the situation. “His brother’s been… I’m not sure, given something, and I need supplies at Baker Street right this very second.”
The young man, Neel Jones, says he helped out in the kitchen during the celebration and went to bed right after. His alibi is weak but John can’t find a motif.
“You weren’t slow to learn Serbian,” Sherlock continues, unblinking through his rapid deductions. “You were afraid.”
Sherlock succumbs to curiosity, but the sight of a damp John in his ugly dressing gown quickly becomes white noise in contrast to the horrified expression on the man’s face.
Sholto’s soft laughter echoes through the crack of the door until it trickles off into a pensive pause. “How are you, John?”
John doesn’t need to think before shaking his head. Being alone with his thoughts wouldn’t end well.
Sherlock knows Molly is going to send him away the second he lays eyes on her. Even Rosie, propped up on her hip, isn’t looking at him.
John feels his nostrils flare. Thankfully, Janine pulls him towards the exit before he can translate his violent impulses into bloody reality.
“A moving company is scheduled for the day after tomorrow. They will remove everything you wish to rid yourself of.”
Mycroft must have deduced his thoughts from the downturn of his lips, for he says, “My brother has endured much worse in his life – some of it self-inflicted, admittedly – yet he has always emerged unscathed on the other end. There is no reason to assume this time will break the pattern.”
The sight of Mary turning on the floor, clad in what looks like black Velcro, ripping off her beanie and gazing up at him with pleading eyes, is the most surreal thing that has ever happened to him. There are several minutes left before the ambulance will arrive at the Tower. Time for answers.
The internal struggle matches Sherlock’s expectations: John considers the option, thinks of buying an additional bottle of whiskey to prevent such incidents, is turning towards the coat stand to grab his jacket… when a memory, presumably of Harry, makes him stop.
“Cut it out, lads,” Greg interrupts. His tone is harsh and John reminds himself that they still have several tasks ahead of them before they can get to Cherise. “We found another set of instructions, so shoo.”
Patronising him was exactly the wrong thing to do, however. “You can toss off, Holmes.” The DI gets right in Mycroft’s face, gesturing insistently. “John’s my friend and something’s obviously going on. I’m staying.”
“The host agreed to the talking points we specified; there will be no untoward questions. I brought the script, in case you wish to take a look.”
“So you’re saying he’s targeting Sherlock, but he’s not done playing yet?” John feels the need to clarify. Damn Mycroft’s love for ambiguity.
Applying pressure to the mangled hand and knee make her choke out a cry but John’s attention shifts to Sherlock’s still form on the floor next to him. No blood – no exit wound. Good.
James offers the box to him, though Q hesitates. He doubts he will be able to place Zed’s body inside without shedding any tears and as much as he and James have fallen into this… this thing, he doesn’t need 007 to see him cry over a pet.
Sherlock fits right into the splendour of the entrance hall. John tugs at the hem of his three-year-old shirt and pulls his hands behind his back to hide the threadbare cuffs of his jacket.
“Then what am I supposed to tell the Prime Minister?” M snaps, beginning to lose his usually so unshakable temper.
Magnussen's voice fills the otherwise silent room. John’s heart beats a steady rhythm against his ribs despite his racing thoughts.
“Are you sure, Mr Holmes?” Moran butts in. “I admit you might be correct in your first set of assumptions, but why would Neel steal a necklace that only has sentimental value?”
John follows the winding path up the hill, gravel crunching underneath their wheels. Sherlock sits up with a start.
That’s why it comes as somewhat of a shock when John emerges from the kitchen to find none other than Janine standing there.
“John, please do close your mouth,” Sherlock says without turning towards him, “it’s getting rather embarrassing.”
“And my front door’s on the other side of the house, you daft git. You know that, you helped us choose it. And you know the Six Thatchers, too. We solved it already.”
“We should start thinking about names, John. It’d be easier if we knew the gender,” she adds pointedly. “But I always liked Rosamund. What do you think?”
Mycroft lets out a soft breath, barely audible even in the silent room. “If you decide, there is an SIS officer stationed outside your room. Simply inform him and it shall be arranged.”
There is no landing, just the sensation of rough sheets – low thread count, standard-issue hospital supplies, Mycroft didn’t even spring for an upgrade – against his back. The steady beat of monitoring equipment, the smell of antiseptic and… something else.
“Then bloody tell me what you know!” he shouts, slamming one hand on the table while stepping towards the other man, who jerks back.
“Three previous victims, all of different ethnic and social backgrounds, no uniform cause of death, but all missing their hearts,” Sherlock says, pacing through the living room where Gleeson’s cleaning lady found the body. “Eight theories –” he stops abruptly, turning away from the book shelf. “No, seven. I’ll need to see the other victims.”
A door on the other side of the sitting room opens after a rapid knock and an “Enter,” from Sholto, but Sherlock barely registers what the servant says. He should have paid more attention, or he would have had a few minutes to deduce how and why his brother Mycroft is here.
“How’re you still here?” John finishes. “They pumped your chest. Dislodged the bullet and the blood could flow out again.” He runs a hand over his mouth with a sigh Sherlock cannot begin to decode. “They were about to call it, Sherlock. They resuscitated you for thirty-two minutes. Had already stepped away. And yet…”
“Jesus,” John coughs. He does not shield his eyes. Not for the first time, Sherlock wonders what horrors he has seen during his deployments.
He delivers his deduction the moment the line is open, then waits in tense silence along with the forty-seven or so onlookers he blocked out until now.
Sherlock’s eyes are drawn to where they are always drawn: John. Who, at the moment, is slumped in a chair right next to the hospital bed.
“I had to handle one hostile,” Mycroft continues. The barest hint of trembling is seeping into his voice. “One. I had a clear shot and…”
A faint voice whispers inside his head that he’s being manipulated – but he also knows miscarriage statistics. He removes his left hand from where he was pressing both her wrists into her back at a taunt angle and shifts his legs to take the pressure off the damaged knee.
A memory flashes across Sherlock’s mind, making him shudder. He grits his teeth. It’s neither Christmas nor is there a wronged secretary on the loose.
“That’s why you only brought two agents here,” Sherlock hisses. “That’s why you left Anthea behind.”
He can’t look at anyone. He doesn’t need their sympathy right now. After a few moments of tense silence, however, a pair of feet appear in his field of vision.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Moriarty quips. “I watched you, Sherlock. Got my eyes on you. You’re ready now.”
“Something’s going on,” John states. Suspicion coils around his spine even as he sees the line of Mycroft’s shoulders tense. “Something you’re not telling me. Your brother’s gone selectively mute for days and you don’t show up like the overbearing arse that you are? Almost like you’re actively keep–”
“The final problem,” Sherlock provides, ignoring the confusion radiating off John next to him in favour of watching Mary, whose stance has shifted ever so slightly.
“Your brother knows more than he’s letting on, that pillock. He’s not sharing. Not now. I’m sure he knows where Mary is, what she’s doing, why…” John laughs, but it’s humourless. “Moriarty. James fucking Moriarty.”
“They,” John gasps between laughs, “they faked suicides at each other? That’s what you’re telling me? Jesus…”
As expected, Mycroft is not amused. That John is chuckling at his own joke in the middle of the man’s sitting room might not be helping matters.
“Right,” Sherlock says on an exhale, excitement taking over his features. “She wanted to give up her old life but habits are hard to break, especially ones that secure one’s survival.” He starts pacing again, yet this time he seems to be looking for something. “She would have planned for every contingency, including one that left us as her only allies. She’ll have come up with a safe haven, a place to meet. There’ll be a clue… NOBODY MOVE!”
“I’ll leave the script,” she says, placing the folder on the pile of fan mail on the cluttered coffee table. “Read it. You can always change your mind.”
“The Met got bumped from the case, right off the bat. Dimmock was griping about it when I got your text, said the Box had taken over. Could have made his career, case like that. So no clue? No idea who shot him?”
Wow, thank you all for the kudos, comments and bookmarks! It's great to see this so well received, it's an immense motivational boost :)
He gives an encouraging hum and listens as the other man relates some encounters that paint their host in a much more favourable light than John’s impressions do.
He grabs some aspirin for himself to battle the headache that has been building throughout the past hour and leaves his sister to sleep it off. When he returns to a still empty 221B, John breathes a sigh of relief. If Sherlock never meets Harry, it will have been too soon.
The second video feed cuts out and becomes nothing but static. Sherlock sinks to the damp ground of the flooded cellar, burying his head in his hands as John tries to come to terms with the fact that the entire country was watching them fail. Moriarty somehow gained access to every telly screen in the UK and broadcast the big final act.
He finds her, along with Janine and Moran, in the manager’s office. All have dressed to impress: Janine chose a bold green dress, Moran opted for just shirt and waistcoat hugging his muscular frame, and Harry donned a pair of trousers that might as well have been painted on. They would have driven their father mental.
?” It’s more of a snarl than anything, but Mary doesn’t so much as flinch. Then, in a voice so eerily calm it both thrills and shocks Sherlock, John concludes, “You never left his service.”
Looking at his sister now, off her tits on expensive liquor after she’d been doing so well for a while, John can’t emphasise that enough.
“A minor position,” Mycroft repeats, now clearly annoyed. “I’m not privy to each and every thread in the global web of criminal masterminds.”
Their entourage consists of eleven of New Scotland Yard’s finest – and Donovan, for reasons that currently elude Sherlock – as well as five of Mycroft’s Suits With Guns. The closer they get to the fence warding off the modest garden in front of Catalyst Hall, the more Sherlock’s skin tingles. The
“I shan’t ask you how you are feeling, John,” Mycroft says, “since it would be an exercise in futility. I am here to tell you that Sherlock has been banned from your room as you requested last night.”
Moran’s grin gains a vicious edge. “We’re celebrating, Captain Watson. You know, that thing you do when you succeed? You should remember that. From what I heard, Sherlock knows how to have a good time.”
Moriarty fakes a pensive hum. “Is it, though? You think you’re so clever, Gabby. Clever little spy, much too good for all the disgusting wet jobs and low pay. But you’re dull. Boooooring,” he sing-songs. “You think daddy cares about you, don’t you? Sorry to disappoint. Say hello to some old friends, Gabby.”
Someone is saying his name, softly, as if they are talking to a scared animal. Maybe he is. Was Zed scared? Did they slit her throat first? Or start with the eyes?
The snapshots he gets about his sister’s life aren’t enough to piece together a coherent picture, but when he arrives at the station, coherence is not what he finds anyway.
“You know, John, for a while I thought you were stood apart from the hoi polloi, but apparently you are nothing but an ordinary goldfish after all.”
“My necklace. A gift from my foster brother.” Her fond smiles falters. “Someone stole it while I was sleeping tonight. It was on the boudoir in the other room and when I went to get it before travelling back home, it was gone.”
John can’t really answer the question. Not Mary. He’s seen all of Mary for a lifetime. He isn’t so sure about Beth, though, if he wants that. Remember her like that. He can say goodbye in other ways. He didn’t get to say goodbye to most of the men he lost in Afghanistan.
Sherlock flicks his eyes towards the other man. There are too many emotions etched into his features for him to decipher, but the tired smile is the only one that counts at the moment.
All Sherlock does is hum. John bites his tongue. He doesn’t need to state the obvious. The Sherlock Holmes of a few years ago wouldn’t have been so fast about deducing emotions.
“She needed to go undercover to retrieve certain files from the IRA. I’d just been promoted. They sent me into the field with her. Everything went according to plan until our retreat when an unscheduled patrol passed us by. Eurus excelled at hand-to-hand. You take after her in that regard, brother mine.”
Removing the object of Moriarty’s obsession from the battlefield is the obvious solution, but why isn’t Sherlock already –
Janine’s grin widens. “Sussex Downs. It’s gorgeous. There’s bee hives, but I’m getting rid of those.”
Sherlock stares. Mycroft smirks. John’s face remains blank until it becomes clear that Sherlock is at a loss for words.
In macabre fashion, the twenty-three-year-old man has been put on display in a nook near the ticket barrier, limbs pulled taut and dreadlocks fanned out on the cold tiles. Scrapes on the floor speak of a partition that was used to hide the preparation.
Apparently Mrs Hudson has been making tea for the journalists camped out in front of 221B since yesterday, so John reluctantly goes back to the suburbs where every item reminds him of Mary. He opens a bottle of whiskey that Mike sent along for the wedding and drinks it in the dark hallway until he reckons he might give sleep a try and win.
“Oh, your face, Sherlock!” Jim sniggers, glee evident in everything from his posture to his tone. “Bet you didn’t see that coming, did you? Too happy to have a friend... save the damsel in distress…”
“Is Moriarty staging all this? Or just capitalising on some deranged sod?” he wonders on the cab ride back.
“If I’d delivered them on a stage in front of cameras with you whispering in my ear?” John snorts. “Sorry, mate. Not doing that again. You should’ve known better, Mycroft. I thought you were the smart one.”
Two steps and Sherlock is at John’s side at the desk where John is already typing. The website is pitch-black and empty save for a single video, captioned “What a comeback!”
“Ta. I’m almost at her flat.” John can’t suppress a chuckle at the irony of the situation. “Never thought I’d be hoping to find her passed out in her own vomit.”
John gives him a dark look, then returns his attention to Sherlock. The heart monitor is beeping steadily, a soothing rhythm that assures John there is still hope.
It doesn’t hit John until they are on puzzle number nine. In his defence, he is going on the thirty-forth hour without sleep. At this point, the only things holding him up are adrenaline and loyalty.
“None of you know the flat like I do – Mary was clever, very clever, and she’ll have put it out of sight but somewhere I’d look for it… Tada!”
“They’re at Catalyst Hall,” he concludes, “a shelter in Twickenham. Defunct now after severe arson in 2013.”
He whirls around. Mycroft is standing two metres away from him, half in shadow. They are on a bus. There is no one in the driver’s seat.
Sherlock grabs the note from him – indeed, it looks like Moriarty has numbered the puzzles he is giving him.
“The detective said you wouldn’t go on your own,” she admits, eyes darting back and forth between him and Sherlock.
One of Magnussen’s papers boasts a three page spread on the shooting, identifying John as the hero who saved Magnussen’s life. The mob of photographers has now taken up residence near John’s home in the suburbs, so he goes back to Baker Street where he helps Mrs Hudson with her Sudoku in a desperate attempt to distract the woman.
, a voice in his head murmurs, but he ignores the renewed flare of worry. Maybe Mrs Hudson will get through to Sherlock today.
“How about a sandwich?” Greg asks, bringing him back to the present. “You’ve got to be running on empty.”
.” Moriarty’s eyes are crinkling at the edges. “You can spread them like a virus… Don’t you think, Sherlock?”
John told Sherlock all about his past year, how he had never intended to fake his death, how he really had planned to die for the detective. He also told him of Moriarty’s network and running into Irene Adler. He didn’t mention that it was because he had been tortured for eight days and he also didn’t mention the new gunshot wound he had, close to his belly button. But everything else, he told Sherlock. And Sherlock remained quiet until the very end.
John stood there in shock for a few seconds and then realized he had to do something. Sherlock couldn’t die and neither could Greg or Mrs. Hudson. Those were practically all of his friends and he couldn’t live in a world without them.
John just held him, unable to comment on Sherlock's apparent suicidal tendencies. He couldn't guarantee that his reaction to Sherlock's death wouldn't be similar.
Mycroft nodded and then John was in a cab, returning to Baker Street. Before entering 221 Baker Street, he ran a hand through his greying hair and scratched at his beard. There was nothing he could do to fix his rough apperance right now. All he could do in the current moment was walk up the seventeen stairs to 221B and knock on the door, which is exactly what he did.
“But will Sherlock be okay if he thinks I’m dead?” John asked hesitantly. He wished he was surprised by how Mycroft responded.
“Why the hell would I want to make any sort of deal with you?” John growled, approaching the man. He pulled out his sig and pointed it against Jim’s head. “Give me one reason not to shoot you in the head right now, after all you’ve done to Sherlock, after all you’ve done to me.”
John remained in captivity for eight days, which were filled with whippings, burns and even the loss of one of his kidneys after he was stabbed. After managing to escape, he found the one contact he knew in Syria and dialed the number. Thankfully, it hadn’t changed in years.
Finally, six months to the day John had died, Sherlock told Mrs. Hudson that yes, he would accompany her to the graveyard. It would be heart-breaking but it needed to be done. The band-aid needed to be ripped off.
John could feel the desperation in Sherlock’s kiss and, to be honest, he felt just as desperate. The thought of possibly kissing Sherlock again was what had gotten him through the torture and the year or isolation. And now, here he was, kissing the detective with more enthusiasm than he had ever displayed before.
“John, darling. When I received your call, I was rather surprised. Thought you were dead,” she said, casually, filing her nails.
“John Watson was a doctor and a soldier,” he started and then realized it was too impersonal. John deserved better.
Sherlock did so and watched as John unbuttoned his shirt, painfully slowly. Nothing could’ve prepared the detective for the damage he saw. Aside from the original bullet wound to the left shoulder, there was another bullet wound above John’s belly button. In terms of burn marks, they were scattered across his chest and back, but those definitely weren’t the worst parts. Even the scar across where John’s left kidney should’ve been wasn’t the worse. It was the whip marks across John’s upper and lower back.
Sherlock managed to track Lestrade’s phone to a crime scene and, when Greg saw him, he visibly paled.
Sherlock leaned forward and touched the headstone. “I don’t believe in miracles, John Watson, but you were exactly what I needed at exactly the time I needed it, all those years ago. So I’m asking for a favour, John, just this once. Don’t be dead, okay? It’s not logical, it doesn’t make sense, but I need you to be alive because I can’t live in a world where you’re not alive.”
Sherlock’s finger grazed one of the longer markings and John had to suppress a shiver. Aside from Irene’s doctor and Irene herself, no one had seen these scars or touched them.
So John did just that, his new job. For three months, he continued taking out numerous members of Moriarty’s network and his next pause only came when he was captured.
After a year, John finally completes his mission is dismantling Moriarty's network and he's able to return home to Sherlock. However, the Sherlock he meets may not be exactly who he left 12 months ago.
“That’s my line,” John said, his eyes twinkling with a smile. “I’d like to explain some more, if you’ll let me.”
When Mycroft finally received the text from John, he had been ready to consider him dead and the sense of relief he got from the man being alive was immense. It was hard enough lying to Sherlock about his best friend being alive, but he wouldn’t be able to disguise his own guilt if John Watson actually died for his brother.
“No, no, no, no,” Sherlock mumbled, pushing harder on John’s chest. He wanted to start chest compressions but that could cause more bleeding and there was already so much blood.
A younger John, a more timid one, would’ve blushed at the question, but this war-hardened, darker John just answered honestly. He said, “it was exactly for the reason I said. I didn’t want to die without knowing what your lips felt like against my own. I had been thinking about kissing you since the day we met and I didn’t want to continue wondering in whatever afterlife existed. I know it wasn’t fair to ask you of that, but I’m not sorry I did. If that had truly been my last moment, I would’ve been okay with that.”
As Sherlock continues dealing with the aftermath of John's death, John faces his own reality and the price he has to pay to keep his friends safe. After all, John Watson doesn't want to live in a world without the brilliancy of his best friend.
John nodded and he stood up as well. Softly, he placed a phone number on Sherlock’s desk. “This is my new number. When you’re ready to see me again, or just ready to tell me to sod off forever, let me know. Either way, I’ll understand your decision.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and began deducing things about the body in front of him. He knew he had solved the crime perfectly in less than five minutes, that wasn’t what put him off. What put him off was the silence that followed his deductions.
Greg did this for a few minutes until Sherlock seemed to be relatively calmed down and then he rested his hands on the younger man’s shoulders.
Sherlock took John’s pulse just as nurses and doctors streamed onto the roof and he felt nothing, not even the smallest flutter.
“Anytime you want to get high, I want you to call me or call Mrs. Hudson. John was our friend and so are you and we want to help you.”
He had tried seeing Ella, John’s therapist, but he couldn’t discuss anything besides his frustration. Why had Moriarty killed John over himself? Why did John want Sherlock to kiss him before he died? Why was he still unable to visit the grave of his best friend? Ella couldn’t give him a definitive answer to any of his questions and so Sherlock left. He never tried therapy again; he just buried himself in the work.
Mycroft draws himself up to his full height then, attempting to look intimidating. John almost laughs in his face – hasn’t he read his military record? – but then notes how knackered the man looks under his put-upon show of strength. The sort of exhaustion that settles deep in your bones and makes every movement a colossal task.
John growls, grip on his Sig tightening. He seems to be sharing Sherlock's sentiment, along with the confusion.
Moriarty’s manic laughter bounces off the factory walls and takes up residence deep inside Sherlock’s bones, like a virus corroding him from within.
John feels his jaw clench. Three words have never hurt this much. He glances down to check the faint rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest is still there.
There is the smallest tremor in Sherlock’s hands as he opens it, carefully rather than fuelled by curiosity. Blue eyes widen as they take in the family portrait. He must have seen this before.
Then he skips out of the room, no crutches, no external assistance. The enthusiasm is infectious, John finds.
Sherlock looks no different. The world is the same, and still… maybe it’s John who changed. He pulls the visitor chair closer to the bed. If he reached out, he could touch Sherlock’s leg underneath the bedding. John’s fingers twitch, but he keeps them in his lap.
“Janine and Moriarty shared a foster family in Ireland, John. My sister’s final mission brought her into contact with the IRA. I’m unclear on the exact timeline of Jim’s criminal activity or when he began dealing with terrorists after his move to Britain, yet the evidence suggests the files Eurus and Mycroft retrieved derailed whatever scheme he had concocted.”
“You can’t stay here, John. Not yet,” Sherlock said, standing up and walking back towards the window. “I know you’ve had a terrible year but I have too and I’m not ready to see you every waking moment when I’ve done so much cocaine trying to block out your image.”
“Of course I’ll leave, if he wants me to. If he had faked his death for a year and made me mourn, I would be furious. All I can do is let him know I’m alive and my reasons for being gone. If he totally and completely rejects me, I’ll understand,” John said, interrupting Mycroft.
“I want you to tell me what you left out the other day,” Sherlock said, firmly. “You were injured by Moriarty’s men. How?”
You made it to Chapter 2!! Thanks for continuing to read and I hope you enjoy this chapter. As always, I'm open to commentary on the chapter and any comment is pretty much guaranteed to make my day :)
“John, my dear, thanks so much for making it. Now I have a deal to make with you,” Jim said, smiling.
Thanks for continuing to read! Here's chapter 3. Feel free to leave me some comments and some kudos if you're so inclined :)
“Dr. Watson, the man you’ll meet today, he’s not the Sherlock Holmes you left a year ago. All that matters to him now is the work and I don’t know how well he’ll handle your return. If he asks you to leave-”
Sherlock pressed his fingers against John’s shoulder wound, the one he had gotten years before in Afghanistan, and he confirmed, just by the texture of the scar, that this really was John’s body. His doctor was dead.
Sherlock didn’t know how long he was kneeling on that roof but Greg eventually showed up and rested a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock took his hand off of the cold granite and went back to Mrs. Hudson without looking back. If he had looked back, he would’ve seen John, lurking in the shadows. He had purposely arranged a layover as he flew from the United States to Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, he would find one of the last five groups of Moriarty’s men. After that, he would complete missions in Mongolia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Bulgaria and then he would be done. He could go home. After seeing Sherlock alive and hearing that speech, John had just the motivation he needed to eliminate the rest of the network.
That was what ended up getting Sherlock to the funeral. He put on black slacks, a black shirt and a black jacket and he followed her out to catch a cab. He didn’t bother with his Belstaf; it felt incomplete without the scarf and the scarf was stained with John’s blood.
“Come in,” Sherlock called, impatiently. He hadn’t had a client all day and Lestrade was out of cases that were of any interest.
“A few days ago, I lost the best and only friend I’ve ever had, but everyone else lost so much more. We didn’t deserve John Watson, not one of us. But he meant something to each of us and I suppose we should count ourselves lucky that we met him. He was a doctor, a soldier, but he was also the bravest man I’ll ever know.”
Throughout the funeral, Sherlock couldn’t stop staring at the casket. He couldn’t bring himself to look inside and see the lifeless body of his friend. He only looked away from the casket when Mrs. Hudson nudged him. Apparently, as John’s flatmate and best friend, he should be the one to say a few words about the doctor.
Sherlock pressed forward and kissed John. He didn’t even think about the possible rejection he could face or how their last kiss had ended. He just wanted John here, alive and safe forever. He wanted to drown in John's scent and his taste. He wanted nothing else but this moment, in John's arms.
John was rushing to be at Mrs. Hudson’s side when his phone rang. He didn’t check the caller ID before answering and he completely stopped in his tracks when he heard the voice of Jim Moriarty.
“Eight days. But I was shot at a different time. That was a few months later, in Bulgaria. Luckily the bullet didn’t hit anything important.”
“No, not him too,” Greg exclaimed, rushing over to Sherlock’s body. Luckily, he found a steady, if not fast, pulse under his fingertips. He was about to call for an ambulance when Mycroft stopped him.
Sherlock nodded, hardly even hearing the words, only thinking of the cocaine solution back at his flat. The work didn’t matter, his few remaining friends didn’t matter, only the drugs did. John Watson was gone and so was any light left in Sherlock’s life.
“You did so much to save me, endured so much, and all I did was try to kill myself with cocaine,” Sherlock noted, quietly.
Greg approached Sherlock slowly and said, “are you sure you’re ready to be here, Sherlock? It’s only been a week.”
Sherlock couldn’t help but to pull John against him, his chest pressed against the doctor’s back and his arms wrapped around John’s shoulders. He squeezed him, probably a bit too tightly, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that John was safe and alive in his arms.
The day of the funeral, he left Sherlock in Mrs. Hudson’s care and she wasn’t taking no for an answer.
Greg crouched down too, right in front of Sherlock, and said, “just breathe, Sherlock. I’m going to count to three and you’re going to take a deep breath in and hold it. Then I’m going to count to three and you’re going to release it. Okay?”
“Oh, my dear doctor, we both know you wouldn’t risk it. You think Sherlock is some sort of hero, the protagonist in this story, and you don’t want to live in a world without him. Honestly, I don’t care if you die or if Sherlock does. Either way Sherlock suffers and I win.” And then he pulled out his own weapon and shot himself in the head.
“That’s not the point, Sherlock. He was your best friend and you need to do this. You need to know that no matter how much cocaine you do, he’s not coming back and he wouldn’t want you to live like this.”
So Sherlock nodded and gestured towards the client chair, since John’s chair had been removed months before.
“Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said as John struggled against his binds. “I know you’re confused right now, but I’ll explain. I had Mr. Moriarty’s phone bugged and I heard your entire conversation with him. I instructed the doctors who treated your bullet wound to inject you with a drug that would considerably slow your heart-rate and breathing. Although they called your time of death at 4:53, you never died. Once Sherlock confirmed that you were truly dead, he left and I had my men retrieve your body.”
Sherlock only managed to go two days without texting John and telling him to come over. Within the hour, John was back at Baker Street, sitting in his chair, which was back in the sitting room.
He continued, “but he was so much more. He was clever, more clever than he knew, and he was my best friend. He had told me this in the past, that I was his best friend, but I never believed him. It made no sense. Who would want to be my friend, let alone my best friend?”
John took a deep breath and pressed his gun to his chest, just an inch away from his heart. Maybe he would survive the shot and convince the gunmen or maybe he would die. Either way, Sherlock would be saved and that was enough of a reason for John, so he pulled the trigger and fell to the ground.
Martha sat on the end of the couch and stroked Sherlock’s hair until he fell asleep. It was all she could think to do to help the poor detective.
“Oh, Johnny, she’s fine. But Sherlock won’t be unless you meet me on the roof of St. Bart’s immediately.” And then Jim hung up.
Jim grinned and pressed his forehead against the barrel of the gun. “If you shoot me, Sherlock dies. The only way your dear detective lives is if you take that gun and kill yourself. I have men trained on Sherlock, your land lady and your detective inspector friend. If you shoot yourself, they won’t die. My men will only shoot if they don’t hear a gunshot and if they don’t see your body drop to the ground. And no tricks, Johnny. If Sherlock doesn’t grieve for you, he dies. It’s very simple.”
Sherlock yelled and he couldn’t get to the roof fast enough. When he threw open the door to the roof, the first thing he noticed was Moriarty, dead from a head wound. And then he heard a gasp and he turned towards John, who was covered in blood. There was a bullet wound to his chest.
When Sherlock pulled away with a gasp, he said to John, “this is what I want, forever. I want to kiss you and all of your scars and I want you to share my bed and my life. Please don't leave Baker Street, not again, not without me.”
The days following John’s funeral were a complete haze to Sherlock. He injected solution after solution until even his dealers wouldn’t sell to him anymore. He suspected Mycroft was responsible for this and so he went to Mycroft’s work and freaked out.
Sherlock continued sitting in the pew until his brother grasped his shoulder and said, “it’s time, Sherlock. They need to bury him.”
Sherlock just continued shaking his head and pressing harder on the gunshot wound. “John, you’re not allowed to die, okay? Someone is coming, I told the nurses on my way up. You’re going to be alright.”
Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes again. He didn’t open them until he heard John leave the flat. And then he swung around and input John’s new number into his iPhone. After doing that, he texted Mycroft.
Sherlock stood up and grasped his bloody scarf in his hands. Without another word, he went down to the surgical area and he found John’s body. He looked peaceful.
“I know that you can’t hear me, that you’re just a body in the ground,” Sherlock mumbled, refusing to stare at the slab of granite. “And I know that, if you were here, you’d be disappointed in me. I tried to die, after you left me. I injected so much cocaine that I didn’t even feel the sting of the needle anymore. You would’ve hated that and I think that’s why I did it. Because, if you were alive, you would’ve come back and strangled me for doing it. But you didn’t come back then and you still haven’t.”
“So I’m afraid it’s hard to keep emotions out of it. Over the past year, I’ve been in over a dozen countries and killed more men than I care to remember. All to save this one man.”
“What time?” Sherlock said, staring down at the blood on his hands. He could still feel John’s lips on his own. Why would John want to kiss him before dying? That made no sense. They were friends. John was straight.
John looked at the blurry picture of Sherlock and he could immediately notice how much weight the detective had lost. He wasn’t dressed in one of his impeccable suits either; he was dressed in sweatpants and a hoodie, with his Belstaf nowhere in sight. He really was mourning John then and not in a healthy way.
“You’re right about one thing, Mrs. Hudson. I don’t want to live in a world without John. And I can’t go out there and pretend to be alive because I’m dead inside. When John died, I died with him. Nothing matters without him.”
“I need you to do better than that, Dr. Watson. I need you to disassemble Moriarty’s network from the inside. Until that is done, my brother and your friends won’t be safe.”
Sherlock left the room and went back to Baker Street. Even as Mrs. Hudson questioned him for John’s whereabouts, he just continued upstairs to his secret stash of a 7% solution of cocaine. He was barely seated when he pushed the needle into his arm and escaped the reality of his best and only friend being dead.
As Sherlock escaped reality, John was gasping awake. He wasn’t on the roof anymore, he was in the back of an ambulance, strapped down. And Mycroft was sitting beside him.
For the next few days, Mycroft only left Sherlock’s side to confirm John’s next move and to get Anthea to set up a flight for him. A duplicate body was to be placed in the coffin for John’s funeral but Mycroft still wasn’t sure he could get his little brother in a well enough state to attend the service.
and he couldn't bring himself to identify that cold tombstone with the loss of his friend. The tombstone didn’t do the doctor any justice and failed to describe the amazing and courageous person known as John Watson. He was so much more to Sherlock than those four words described.
Sherlock turned around, confused. He was ready for John to tell him that he was brilliant or that he had done something that was a bit not good, but he heard nothing. Just silence. And then he realized why and he hurried off of the crime scene, with Greg on his heels.
Sherlock just climbed into the cab without a word and went back to Baker Street. He collasped on the couch the minute he unlocked the door and he began sobbing so loudly that Mrs. Hudson came upstairs. She was still wearing black and her heart broke even more when she heard the sounds coming out of Sherlock.
Sherlock took a moment and he stared out at all of the people in the church. He didn’t recognize 80% of the crowd. He wanted to scream at them, tell them that they hadn’t seen John in two years and why the hell were they here, but he didn’t have the energy. So he just returned to his seat by Mrs. Hudson, tired.
Seeing Mycroft smile – not grimace – in response is a strange turn of events. It becomes ever stranger when his features morph into something that is not his usual inscrutable mask, but rather a sombre expression.
He’s afraid he’s bolloxing this up, but Mary buys into his sudden preoccupation with gender neutral childcare. Whatever pills they prescribe for her here to keep her docile must be miracle drugs.
Mycroft’s men intervened the very second the Waters gang stormed the factory. John managed to flip the table Mary had been perched on when they entered and manhandled Sherlock behind the cover it provided, pressing him down with a strong hand on his shoulder.
“Mary Morstan is one of many aliases that have been matched to Gabrielle Ashdown, a former CIA operative who went rogue five years ago. She has been connected with seven assassinations, four terrorist attacks and several smaller heists. The reasons for her presence in your life are as of yet unclear.”
“All those wet jobs for the CIA. Never fell for one of her marks then… but that was before she went freelance.” Magnussen pauses theatrically, looking away from John and onto Mary. “He promised to set you free after, I assume.”
Meaning Sherlock already knows. Homeless network, most likely. John gets dressed mechanically and finds his flatmate pacing. The kettle is already boiling, two cups waiting to be filled.
Not even James Bond seems to be able to think of anything to say to that. They fall silent, James’ hand never pulling away from around his shoulders.
Mary may be the mother of his child, Sherlock concludes, but she will no longer be the woman John Watson has pledged his life to.
“I’m more worried Mr Moran’s gonna put me in the stocks at midday if I mislabel one more item in his household.”
Sherlock apparently does. There is a twinkle in his eye and a smile tugging at his lips. “Then so it shall be.”
“You should call it a night, Harry.” John makes sure to keep any reproachful inflection from his tone. “Or don’t you have to work tomorrow?”
Mycroft looks down his nose at him. “An international crime syndicate has several branches, John. Do keep up.”
John’s bladder is what forces him to get up. When he returns to the room, the sight of Sherlock’s pale, too-thin body hits John like a punch in the gut. He steps closer despite how much it hurts. The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor is proof that the person who saved his life is still there.
“Prick,” John says but there is no heat behind it. The grin isn’t helping either. “You know what I mean.”
Sherlock doesn’t react, at least not visibly. He’s in sleeping trousers and one of his older cotton T-shirts as well as a camel-coloured dressing gown. The threadbare fabric of his tee has visible sweat stains on it and the usually lush curls are sticking to Sherlock’s skin. His posture is defensive – almost as if he’s hiding from something.
She could have let the desk sergeant deal with Harry, could have let something slip to the papers – what a wonderful scandal that would have been, the blogger’s drunk sister sleeping it off in a cell – or exchanged it for a favour of some kind, but for some reason, Donovan chose to do the nice thing.
Moriarty has reached John by then, whose body is coiled tight, like a predator waiting for his chance to strike. For now, however, he can only stand there as Jim puts an arm around his shoulder, pulling him close. Sherlock envies his composure, how he remains unflinching at the touch.
Anger, denial, longing and a cacophony of other emotions colour John’s tone. Sherlock can’t even begin to make sense of the situation over the blood rushing in his ears despite the implications being abundantly clear.
“Yeah, thought this might come in handy,” John quips in reply, but his heart isn’t really in it. He waits until Sherlock has checked the weapon and started barging forward until he mutters a curse. “Janine? And that wanker Moran? Jesus.”
Sherlock’s reality tilts on its axis. His mind supplies the visual, extrapolates the actions taken by the parties in involved.
Q’s chest and throat tighten as he approaches, gun raised half-heartedly, his knees shaking and making it difficult to keep his balance.
“I should…” Q stops, unable to complete the sentence. He glances over to where Zed is still lying and thankfully James understands.
“Magnussen is impeding a federal investigation. If he continues, we will have grounds for a warrant. We can seize the Appledore vaults.”
“She’s become famous on YouTube with her sisters, then they split to go off to university but Cherise just released a new video last month – she’s going solo,” John fills him in without prompting. “Who’s Lukas?”
By the time they are back in the flat, the kettle has finished but John can’t spare a single thought for tea right now.
“I’m not going to go on some damn talk show!” John tells her. He might be more imposing standing across from her if she weren’t taller than him.
Mycroft’s lips twist into a sneer. “Seven meetings with the Prime Minister in the past year, but Doctor Watson believes this man can be forced to dance to anyone’s tune but his own.”
Sherlock is the first to move, reaching into his breast pocket and breaking the tension. He places the picture on the table, then lifts his head to look at his brother.
“Sentiment rarely does.” Sherlock’s tone is uncharacteristically soft and remains gentle when he turns to Neel. “You were jealous. Everyone would see that you are Moran’s lover if they just looked at your body language when placed in the same room as him, but there seems to have been a misunderstanding as to the nature of your relationship.”
“I’m fine!” Sherlock calls from the stretcher, batting away the hand of the poor sod tasked with making sure.
“Mr Magnussen was rather smug about it. He even is allowed to call him ‘Jim’, if one believes his tales.”
He quickly kicks the other gun across the floor, silencer and speckles of blood included, before gesturing at Magnussen to let John take over pressing Sherlock’s scarf against the entry wound.
Donovan hums. “You’re letting her suck you in again,” she points out. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
Sherlock flashes a smile, replaces his Browning in his hip holster, and fulfils Janine’s wish. The ensuing hug comes as a surprise.
Mycroft sends them a disgruntled look. “She was never here. The shooter will remain unidentified until tomorrow and be captured the following day. Mr Magnussen will commend you on your bravery that saved his life, but you are not to mention any of this on your blog.”
John doesn’t need to go on for Sherlock’s mind to fill in what happened after that: the blood pushed the pericardium beyond its capacity and started pressing on the heart, which stopped. Cardiac tamponade. No pulse.
“Motive?” Dimmock stammers like the blundering idiot Sherlock has been telling Lestrade he is. “Of a psychopathic serial killer?”
“Good thing you’re coming with us then, dear brother,” Sherlock says with one of his less creepy grins. “Well, an untraceable armoured car large enough to hold six passengers would have been showing off otherwise. Care to divulge our destination?”
John practically flies through the front door to 221 and up the stairs, almost colliding with Mrs Hudson who shouts something after him about another attempt at tea.
John barely dares to breathe, let alone look at Sherlock to see if the man has picked up on the wording.
“The final problem,” Mary says from the floor. A blink of an eye later, she’s standing next to him, tilting her head.
Anthea acknowledges his decision with a brief nod before taking the second folder underneath her tablet and holding it out to John. He accepts it with a weary frown. It contains a little over thirty pages in packs of three, neatly stapled together. Property listings, background on the respective neighbourhoods, OFSTED reports about suitable nurseries, evaluations.
Harry’s lock screen background shows some ad campaign – probably one she helped design – and her password… is not her birthday. John tries her wedding day, and once that fails the day of the divorce.
Mary’s soft tone is at odds with her appearance: exhaustion is etched into her features, her hair matted; her dark clothes have seen better days. Sherlock can retrace her steps five days into the past and what he sees does not bode well.
“I’m disappointed, Sherlock.” Moriarty sighs in exaggerated desolation. “You were so slow. But you can still grow… Rise to the occasion… That was only task one. Tell my fans I said hi,” he adds in a happier tone, before hanging up.
Mycroft inclines his head and gets up, gathering his umbrella as he does so from where it was leaning against the chair. He doesn’t say anything else before he leaves the room, but then again, Mycroft was never one for excess platitudes.
It’s only when John gives his name to the security guard manning the gate that Sherlock perks up, his vision clearing.
John forces his hands to relax. He’s had to overcome a lot in his lifetime. If he could do it then, he’ll do it now, too. He’s going to be fine.
John exhales sharply. Sherlock doesn’t want to look up and see the pain that comes with the reminder of the two years he left the man to his grief.
Everyone’s attention shifts to Sherlock, even John’s. His best friend’s face is blank – the sight sends a chill down his spine.
“Eleven, technically, seeing as we are already on the second,” Sherlock corrects. “We need to get to Reading Gaol. I already texted Lestrade, he will arrest your serial killer before she strikes again.”
Janine even drops by for a visit, a tin of homemade biscuits in her hands, though her presence has no effect whatsoever. John could say he doesn’t feel viciously satisfied about it, but that would be a lie.
Bile rises in his throat and he dry heaves, sinking to his knees with his back against the side of the sofa. His eyes remain glued to Zed, her fur almost shiny in the moonlight while his mind tries to make sense of the sight. It does not compute. Cats have nine lives. Zed has survived infections, and Q being kidnapped and gone for three days. Zed cannot be…
He rings Mrs Hudson to make sure someone pesters Sherlock about tea and breakfast before he gets his own. He is wiping crumbs off his hands when the call comes. Janine sounds haggard.
Mycroft purses his lips but complies with his request. “The snipers were not in place to kill Sherlock – they were there to add incentive to whatever puzzle Moriarty intended to lay out.”
Sherlock falls silent as the siblings seem to laps into nonverbal communication that goes completely over John’s head.
He slips around the alcove and forces the door open with his bare hands since he was unable to snatch a gun from anyone on his covert escape route. He makes sure the helicopter is out of sight before sprinting across the patch of dried-out grass and into the woods that begin just off the property.
“Save any pent-up sarcasm until later, Mycroft,” Sherlock begins, “because I have uncovered the darkest secret we shall ever come across and I will need your undivided attention to guide you through the web of interconnecting deductions necessary to –”
“Then you better file the appropriate forms,” Sherlock tells him with that eerie smile of his that will fuel sociopath comments for weeks to come, John is certain.
The man kneels at Sherlock’s side and follows John’s instructions. It’s easier to focus on simple first aid, on his best friend maybe dying from internal injuries, than it is to think about why his wife is currently struggling against his hold.
Bond emerges from his work area with a battered looking cardboard box, the material frayed where Zed already attacked it with her claws. She couldn’t climb into that one because until a few minutes ago it held spare computer parts for Q’s tinkering pleasures – not that she didn’t try. Q blinks the tears away stubbornly.
“We can discuss that during your debrief.” Mycroft’s expression sobers when all John does is glare. “I promise to have you delivered to the hospital long before my brother is out of surgery.”
For now, he has to fill in the blanks for two of their closest friends. Admitting to shooting Mary is difficult, but Sherlock’s very much living presence in the room behind him helps.
John watches him dash across the room and up the staircase to the second level of Magnussen’s office.
He can’t find a garage or anything of the like, so John parks the battered Volvo just off the roundel in front of the main doors. The building consists of a vast three-floor baroque monstrosity with extensions from later periods to the side. It would fit John’s childhood home fifteen times… at least. Ignoring the pang of anger, John climbs the stairs with Sherlock right behind him. He can’t make out a bell or a knocker in the dark, though he needn’t have worried: with a creak that has him tense, the doors swing open.
“I’ve got all night,” John whispers darkly after a while. As stubborn as the Holmes brothers are, John can out-stubborn them both. Today is no exception.
Great, it’s their target. And she’s holding a knife to a younger man. If asked, however, John couldn’t pinpoint who looks more scared by the turn of events.
James finally rises to his feet and Q tries the same, but his knees are still wobbly and it takes longer than it should to manoeuvre himself upright. His bones feel heavy, his body numb.
Sherlock shakes his head and forces the memories aside. Inspecting the animal’s body with his usual clinical detachment proves futile.
Mycroft doesn’t let himself be goaded into revealing more, not that John is surprised. On his return to Baker Street, Sherlock acknowledges the new information with an absent-minded hum while his eyes remain glued to the wall. They are solving four cases at once, since tackling one thing at a time and waiting for reports or test results has been deemed “a tedious waste of time”. Tracking down Mary remains a perpetual fifth case – the trail has long since gone cold. Only fresh evidence will help them now.
Sherlock already has his hands raised and eyes closed, clearly trying to solve it in his mind. John’s lips twitch when he sees Mycroft’s smirk, even though he should probably snap at the older Holmes that now isn’t the time to hold some childish competition.
The walls have cracks, running deep and destructive along the halls of his mind palace. Redbeard barks and whines at every creak that echoes overhead.
John doesn’t ask where Mycroft’s spooks got the corpse, or if breaking the story that morning is part of a deal Mycroft struck with Magnussen in exchange for information.
Days like this, when John barely manages to keep up with Sherlock’s rapid-fire deductions and their clients leave a tearful but happy mess, he almost forgets all the awful things that have happened.
“You know, there’s always the option to change that,” John suggests, keeping his tone light even though his shoulders have yet to relax.
Unfortunately, conclusions are sparse. Too little data, too much reliance on conjecture and staggering leaps of reasoning that leave more open questions than Sherlock encountered in the first place.
Watching Dimmock’s mind process this situation would be amusing if it weren’t so vexing. Eventually, the man spits out a “Fine!” and organises them a police car to take them to Reading, sirens blaring.
Every room they check, leading off the dust-covered hallway, sits empty. The second storey holds nothing but mice and vermin, the third a bird’s nest.
Mycroft’s tone is tender, probably as close to pleading as the man is capable of. John’s mouth is dry, his heart beating in his throat.
John nods. “We’re low on ammunition and supplies. Could do with some food. And probably a shower, too,” he adds with a snort after glancing at the specks of blood decorating the collar of Sherlock’s shirt and the skin of his neck.
