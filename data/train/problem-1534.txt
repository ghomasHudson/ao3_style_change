Inside the dark interior, I saw train parts scattered everywhere. Massive engine ports and brake replacements, steam funnels and spare wheels, and sheets of metal plating longer and wider than I was.
“I’ve got a mountain of work to do at the surgery, Holmes,” I said unhappily, stepping out into the shadowy London evening. The night was chilly and wet after a short downpour, and the cobblestone streets were lined with glittering, puddled streaks of reflected gaslight. “I won’t be home until quite late. If you’re asleep by then, I suppose I’ll see you in the morning.”
“...I am glad to hear it,” he said softly. His face so close to mine, I was enchanted by its perfect, chiseled symmetry. Lips flushed pink, his aristocratic features marred only by the brilliant red cut on his high brow, I thought him a sculpture given life. A Roman creation of marble made flesh, sent into battle, and emergent victorious. He was noble, brave, and the most brilliant man I had ever known.
The concession cooled the embers of my annoyance, and I dropped my arms. “I know, Holmes. I merely wish for you to get the rest you need.”
“An unexpected resource. Shall we begin our own reconnaissance?”
Holmes’s eyes trail down my body and even though I no longer need to hide it, I withhold a shiver under their attention.
But more than anything, I wanted none of it to have happened at all. I wanted it all to be a dream. That, perhaps, was why I couldn’t bear to go to sleep. There was no deeper despair than going to bed and waking in the morning to a nightmare that had not ended. That would never end.
Hopkins carefully set down his tea, looking somewhat uncertain. “I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which will give you a general idea of the position of the Professor’s study and the various points of the case.” He unfolded a rough chart pulled from his jacket pocket, and laid it with some awkwardness across Holmes’s knee. I slowly stood and moved behind Holmes’s study to witness it myself as my friend smoothed it across the surface of his lower thigh. It was a rudimentary drawing, sketching the estate from a bird’s eye view to give an image of the manor, its path to the road, the walled perimeter around the property, and the modest servant’s cottage. Near the rear of the rectangle labeled ‘manor’, there was a hinge representing a door, and on the west-facing side of the house was a small x, labelled ‘Smith window’.
"Yes," I said coldly. "There were none such as yourself in sight. I did what was necessary to protect my friend."
“Watch him, my dear?” Coram asked, and with the hand not pointing a pistol at my chest, he gently lifted his wife into the car beside me.
“It’s very rough, of course, and only deals with the essential points. The rest, I’m certain, you will see later for yourself. Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the house, how did they come in? Undoubtedly by the garden path from the front gate, of course, but either way, they had to, somehow, enter either the front or the back door—both of which were locked. The back door is the likelier candidate, from which there is direct access to the study where the murderer might have gotten the murder weapon, and the victim’s adjoining bedroom. Any other way would have been exceedingly complicated and unlikely. As for the trail itself, the escape through the window should have left an easy enough path to detect, correct? It had been raining that night, and the ground was saturated and certainly would have shown footmarks.” Hopkins pressed his lips together, his brow knitted together in seriousness. “But my examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal. No distinct footmarks were to be found on any path, coming or going.”
“So you would like to determine if could prefer more intimate touch, from me. And you would like to touch me to your satisfaction in return.”
"I will ask about him," Ms. Tarlton said generously. "He was not feeling well after the inspector spoke to him and complained of pain, but perhaps a doctor as experienced as yourself could offer some him solace, now that the rain has stopped."
I glared daggers at him, self-preservation restraining my growing outrage. I climbed stiffly into the carriage, pained to leave the constable where he lay.
Holmes sighed heavily. “I shall make no promises, sir. But with your continued cooperation, perhaps I can...summon some lenience.” Eyes flickering to mine, he subtly tilted his head towards the door, and at that, we left the miserable man where he sat, quietly moving into the empty meeting hall.
Holmes peered inwards through the bars, mouth pressed in a line. “I see no master,” he observed. “Negligent, perhaps?”
“We shall call it
“Protective of the young Mr. Ables, are we?” Holmes observed.
Holmes's mouth twitches. “The case is well in the hands of the Yard,” he says primly. A beat, and he looks up at me through his eyelashes. “But however illogical it may be, I am always concerned about your welfare, Watson.”
“The time for a soft hand has passed, I believe,” Holmes said, somewhat amused, and tilted his head meaningfully.
I rolled my eyes once more at Thomas’s unabashed phraseology. “I have been busy, Thomas,” I said defensively. “I never intended to be away for so long, but I have been longing for a night out for some time.”
"I would have seen it," Holmes murmured. He looked at me like he had never truly seen me before. "I would have..."
to allow us to bring my trunk, Watson, we must return to our rooms so that I can consult a few maps.”
“An understatement,” I said, not unfondly. “He’s a good friend, and right, too. He has been a club member for some time, he’d know who to ask and the right way to ask it.”
I gaped at him. Gone was the mask and his composure. Now, Holmes looked desperate. “Holmes—”
“Do not worry yourself, young man,” said Holmes swiftly. “I only have a few questions. Station Master Everett, from Evesham, told us you reported a problem with some passengers last night? Which, I perceive, led to the ejection of most of them from the train?”
Signed,
“I don’t suppose it was French wine?” Holmes asked, voice sleek and insinuating. “
“And you say there was only a minute or so between the cry and the breaking of the window?”
“What time is it? How long have I been asleep?”
“A plan, then!" I said, too pleased. “But today?”
I could not deny the truth. I had deceived him for long enough. But the fear was old and powerful beneath my skin, anxiety making my palms sweat and my lungs ache. I was at once hideously grateful that I had kept my practice after Holmes returned. I had kept it for the supplementary income in the event our caseloads ever ran dry, as they occasionally did, and it could—it
"You made a mistake, Holmes. Recall I misunderstood you, too. I thought you had learned of my feelings, that you were casting me out for them. Many men would react poorly to learning they were loved by another."
sir. When did these workers perform this maintenance, and what precisely did they do?”
I was unmoved by his sentiment. "You cannot be serious," I said. I set my glass down upon the tea table with enough force that the wood creaked in protest. "I know you, Holmes. Possibly better than anyone else in this world. A single case and a personal revelation from me cannot rewrite a person's very nature. And certainly not a man of such an unyielding and stubborn nature as yours."
wine on the job, but Quincey shook his whiskered head.
I blinked, took a drink, and closed my eyes. “...You cannot be serious, Holmes.”
it seems, I want from you what men who love other men create with one another.”
We left the station, and my arm had already lifted to summon a cab when Holmes grabbed me by the sleeve and carefully drew it down.
, Holmes?"
And with that, I left Baker Street for Ratcliffe, my heart hollow with dread and my pistol burning a hole in my coat.
“Suppose I walked right into that one. Mr. Holmes, have you seen anything of the Yoxley case in the latest edition?”
"Or more likely, the train stub sticking out of your jacket pocket, Inspector."
“It appears our schedule may be booked,” Holmes observed, lip a subtle curl over his teacup, and the two of us turned to face the apartment door as someone joined Mrs. Hudson up the stairs.
Mrs. Coram lay closer to the bridge, unmoving on her stomach and half swept into the creek. I saw her thin breathing and the blood pouring from the crown of her head, and cared little.
"Pretextual," Holmes huffed, and I chuckled.
“Not yet, Johann.”
“The cigarettes?’ I echoed. “How on earth—”
I thought, and schooled my expression back to attention
“We cannot go to the Yard. Peter will almost certainly be killed if word escapes that they are attempting to move smuggled goods through the Circle, and it would bring risk to the Johann, the Circle, and all its members—yourself included. No, we must locate Peter on our own.”
The front hall was already well-populated with regulars, despite the early hour, and I recognized a few faces: not only from having seen them before but from newspapers as well. Judges, secretaries, and government men were a common sight here, and Holmes would no doubt recognize them immediately.
“Sherlock!” John snapped, getting his attention. His face changed for a split second at the sound of John calling his name. For a brief moment John saw an expression of eagerness flit across Sherlock’s features before he locked eyes with John and seemed to see the stern look there. “Apologize,” John ordered, and Sherlock’s mild glower returned.
“No phone either,” Dimmock replied.
“John’s fine, John Watson,” John replied, propping his cane against his hip in order to take the offered hand.
“I was going to say we should rest tonight, but a nap sounds just fine as well.” John saw the little frown that accompanied a slight put-upon sigh and an eyeroll to complete the package. “Come to think of it I never see you sleep.”
“Dear god, do you think he was here while we were-”John’s mind jumped to the horrifying thought of Sherlock’s brother listening to them go at it.
“Oh,” John replied. As unimposing as Jim seemed, he appeared to have a tough, more ‘teacherly’ side somewhere inside with a comment like that. So far John hadn’t met a rider that imposed that sort of rule on the nestlings, they only seemed to call the Masters by their title out of habit and genuine respect, not so much a forced imposition. Sherlock wasn’t Mr Holmes, and John wasn’t Dr Watson, though a couple still called him that anyway out of sheer unfamiliarity.
The massive glowing spot suddenly emerged from the clouds and was revealed to be a gigantic Nordic Blue dragon. Only this one wasn’t the standard navy coloration. It was white, its huge wings cupped the air in a glide and were lit up a pale translucent icy blue by the light of the field below. It was decked out in a rather spectacular array of fairy lights, eschewing the fluorescent paint and reflective strips of smaller dragons. The giant wore christmas lights in festive patterns: red and white candy canes, green trees, a number of white stars scattered along its neck, more stripes of white trailed down its tail, and there on the single horn that decorated the center of every Nordic’s forehead like a white dagger was a huge, red, glowing bauble. It was truly a spectacle to behold flying, the white scales and pale wings of the dragon only amplified the brightness of the lights that covered it head to toe.
“Not to mention the time it will all take to heal, as it is now it’ll take about a month minimum before I’d be comfortable with him doing anything more than basic stretching exercises,” she added. Lestrade sighed at the news, raking a hand across his hair.
“Sherlock, what the hell is wrong with you?” Lestrade shouted, cutting him off, “You can’t just do shit like that and not expect to get in trouble for it.”
“And there would be?” Lestrade asked impatiently, grabbing Sherlock’s shoulder as he passed.
“Why am I here then?” John asked, keeping calm even as he tried to think of a way out if he needed it.
“What am I doing?! They’re the ones who decided to raid my flat while I was out!” Sherlock rounded on John, only just barely keeping from spitting on him with the vehemence in his voice. Sherlock’s usually aloof mask was gone, a wildness in his eyes as he watched Dimmock and Sally rummage through the biohazard that was their kitchen. John grabbed Sherlock and made the rider lean down and look at him.
Sherlock sat up next to him very slowly, holding his head as if he were afraid it was about to fall off his shoulders. He blinked at John sleepily, very slightly shook his head and blinked some more, groaning at the motion. He finally looked over to where the watch had been thrown. “That was my watch,” he slurred quietly, as though the sound of his own deep baritone were too loud for his own ears.
“We were always human John,” Sherlock corrected, pressing a kiss into John’s hair.
“We should probably help them,” John said, once the giggling had died down, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“We were attacked, you got chloroformed and passed out, I knocked the pair on their arses, Mycroft cleaned up the mess and just left.” John gave him the short version, getting the food so they could eat it while it was still warm. John knew Mycroft had ordered the extra food for Sherlock to eat, caring in his own way.
Sherlock seemed perfectly fine with ignoring the woman’s admonishment, but John couldn’t ignore it. “We’re sorry ma’am, we didn’t know this area was occupied. Sherlock and I had no intention to disturb, er, her.” John told her tactfully. He gave Sherlock a pointed look and nod in the woman’s direction, hoping to prompt him to apologize as well.
“You know I can’t do that,” John replied, “Something went wrong, I understand that much, but punishing yourself over it isn’t going to help.” John told him, still petting his hair.
“What?”
“You have a website?” John looked up from typing in the number to stare at Sherlock.
“What was that?” John ground out.
That feeling of sparks in his head grew within John as they walked; it was becoming less like sparks and more like smouldering flame. Hyperion couldn’t be too far away. John’s pace increased to keep up with the burly man ahead. The closer he stayed to this man the sooner he got to see his dragon.
Sherlock’s head nodded to the side. “From the men’s restroom upstairs,” he murmured, working his way down to nibble at a collarbone, then further still to John’s left nipple.
Sherlock’s belly jumped as John skimmed a hand down, barely hesitating at the elastic of his pyjamas before closing around Sherlock’s hard cock. They both gasped, lips so close together they shared the breath. Sherlock surged up into John’s fist with a lovely low whine, all John had to do for a long moment was hold his hand still as Sherlock fucked into his solid grip.
“She’s not the one up here though,” John said as Sherlock gave him a look that read confusion at John’s laughter, “you are the one that set this all up, she didn’t tell you to come up here specifically or what food to prepare did she?”
Then the deep cut across her face lit up like a lightening bolt, obscuring her face momentarily as the glow reached a blinding level. That was the one moment John looked away. When the flash of light died down and he looked again, there was only a jagged pale scar left on Sebbie’s face. The terrifying morphed features slowly started disappearing again, blond hair returned, nose shrank, teeth returned to pointed human rather than a maw of needle sharp death, and markings faded back to more normal human skin tones. And in moments the whole process was done, the book was closed and there sat Sebbie, a new silvery scar spanning the width of her face but otherwise good as new.
“Just don’t want to see you fall is all,” John said, finally standing quickly as she sat back down on the ring and hung upside down with her knees, like a kid hanging from the monkey bars on a playground instead of from a dragon’s teeth more than just a couple feet off the ground.
“Er, I’ll be back tomorrow,” Lestrade said lamely. The noise seemed to startle John who quickly put a little space between him and Sherlock. “Got some paperwork that needs filling out,” he added.
“You kissed me on the head a few weeks ago.”
“Er, thank you,” John offered up at her, "seems like she wants you to share something,” John said to Sherlock nodding at Bellamy. Sherlock glared up at her for a moment before sighing and repositioning himself against her thumb facing John.
John leaned against the edged of the fountain, breathing hard, and scrubbed a hand over his face only to rub bloody gunk down his forehead, nose, and chin, as if he wasn’t grimy enough. He sighed, looking at that hand, and realized that the sudden swell of anger he felt was being washed away by the bond. Hyperion sent strong waves of concern across tinged with comfort and his own restrained smidge of sadness at the confession that his rider didn’t want to fly with him. “This whole bond thing… I, god, I just love him… but flying…” John was struggling with it now, the conflict of interests, he’d been putting it off and skirting around the topic; whenever it came up in his thoughts he’d veered away from it. John spun and quickly dunked his hand in the cool fountain, splashing the water on his face, trying to clean the muck off, sputtering and gasping as the coolness grounded his whirling thoughts while he rested an elbow of the fountain rim.
“No, no.” Sherlock said quickly. “Where was I? Oh yes, the pollen residue on the brother’s coat sleeve…” And on he went, retelling the story of a serial killer gardener who killed his victims and then buried parts of them in his clients’ gardens. Apparently during the case Sherlock had uncovered another unrelated murder because a man had buried his girlfriend in a similar manner to that of the killer, but hadn’t followed the same pattern.
“You, at some point, decided to bury your face in my clothes,” John said, rapidly losing his battle and letting the smile grow on his face.
“Caring is a good thing. So’s love, really,” John finished, as Sherlock finally sat back up.
The image built John a sort of mental picture of a taller man who, while loving to his dragon, stayed distant and cold as far as skin to skin contact went; a person who definitely, even at a young age, did not just take his clothes off and skinny dip in a pool in front of other people, or at least in front of a creature like Hyperion.
“What is this?” John said, coming closer to the blanket. He looked up at the radar spinning slowly, quietly above them, then down at the thin snow crunching under his feet, then back to Sherlock and the empty cushion next to him.
John distantly heard, “Papercuts?” rumbled by a gruff voice that his mind perceived like gravel being ground into a raw wound. Another voice replied with laughter that was no where close to friendly and echoed across John’s mind like the sinister sound of an executioner readying their blade, a repetitious scraping noise.
“You’re laughing again,” Sherlock accused
Sherlock’s skin prickled as well, tiny raised spines rippling across his tensed surface in a mirror of John’s. John’s own spikes only grew at the echoed visual cue. “Fine!” He shouted, “I thought you might actually be growing as a person for a moment there. Apparently I was wrong.”
The rest of the night continued as usual. Sherlock rifling around on the computer for a while after dinner until he decided he’d had enough and slumped into John, falling asleep on him after a bit of mumbled conversation and an absent minded peck on the cheek as he drifted off. John couldn’t help a small smile growing off and on through the night at the innocent kiss from Sherlock.
the panicky side of John’s brain supplied.
John’s heart melted a tiny bit. That was coming up soon, only the rest of November and just on the other side of December. He’d have to get Sherlock something for it. Considering what he knew about Sherlock’s past he was willing to bet that Sherlock didn’t really get too many gifts beyond maybe something from his parents.
“Don’t be dramatic John, hysterics don’t suit you,” Sherlock said. “Besides, the post is checked for explosives, if there were anything it’d leave a divot in the airfield, not our foyer.”
Mrs. Jennings nodded. “My family would certainly have broken all ties with me,” she said, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief. “My mother has always suspected that there is something unusual in my attractions. She made it very clear to me how relieved she was that I had taken a husband, even one so far beneath me in station. I tried to make the best of it; I thought that through marriage, Christopher and I could both obtain something that we needed. But he became tyrannical: dropping hints of all he knew to my disadvantage, extorting ever increasing sums of money, and finally forbidding me to visit my dear Joanna. It was she who persuaded me to consult you, risk though it was, in the hope that we might gain some leverage to counter his.”
“I am aware of it,” I remarked, stiffly. “But I would not expect to encounter the affliction in a respectable woman.”
Mrs. Jennings made an indeterminate sound, halfway between a laugh and a sob, and buried her face in her hands. It took several moments for her to regain her composure; when she looked up, however, her colour had returned, and there was the trace of a smile about her lips. “I see that I can conceal nothing,” she said. “Forgive me for not confiding in you from the beginning: you will surely understand my reasons. This is a matter about which I have only ever dared to speak to one other soul, before you. Yes, I love a woman. Your acceptance of the fact is a most wonderful relief.”
“Do you often resort to such tricks in order to attract women?” he asked companionably, as though unaware of my discomfort. “I had not observed you to behave in such a manner before.”
This time, we were not tentative at all. I dragged him close, slid my hands into his hair and my tongue between his lips, and he met each advance with increasing fervour. I had wondered if it would feel strange to make love to a man, but the only difference that mattered now was that this man was Sherlock Holmes: his brilliant mind focused on me, his lithe body firm against mine, his skillful fingers already working the buttons of my waistcoat. My whole being quickened in response to him; my blood pounded waywardly to my cheeks and to my groin.
One morning John had been on his laptop with his feet up on the sofa and Sherlock had appeared, lifted John’s ankles, and plopped himself down on the sofa where they had been. John had let off a huff when disturbed, which caused Sherlock to cast a quick glance at him. Had he finally crossed a line? But when John just went back to his emails, Sherlock settled in. And with that small moment began the common event of sharing the sofa.
They both fell quiet as they finished their meals. Sherlock left a fairly large portion behind. At least he packed it back up, pulling the bag closer to him and putting the resealed box away to be eaten later.
John noticed the direction of her gaze and set down the bag, unpacking its contents and showing the plastic and foil packages to her. “It’s just food, it’s okay. Angelo sent it, I don’t know if you’ve met him, he’s good, he doesn’t want to hurt Sherlock either,” John told her calmly as she craned her neck closer, nostrils flaring and tongue flicking out to inspect the offering.
“Do you mind if I pass that on to Hyperion?” John finally asked, feeling like a little bit of an arse the moment he said it, considering the myriad of other conversational branches he could have taken. “Just the mate bit, not the other… bits,” he clarified. He had no intention of telling Hyperion the somewhat ugly side of his previous rider if the dragon didn’t already know; let Hyperion’s memories of his beloved rider stay happy.
“I’ve heard you were a military man before getting hitched to Hyperion,” Sholto continued as he sat back.
“Yeah, a lot more intense.” John felt thankful that she wasn’t having him committed. The fact that she had known what he was feeling implied that she definitely knew more about what was going on and that was a welcome comfort. If it was something that needed fixing maybe she knew how to fix it.
“You don’t need to apologize,” Sherlock said.
John ignored the pain in his back as he vaulted down stairs and burst through the doors back into the aquarium proper. He could hear Sebbie behind him. She didn’t shout after him or make any threats, all he could hear were her footsteps following him, and that was even more terrifying than if she had been yelling. And then he heard a bang in the silence. He skidded around the corner of a hallway and turned wide eyed to see a crumbling bullet hole in the concrete wall where he’d just been.
“Her mind likes to roam in a palace now and then.”
“You’re one of the first people I’ve heard say that,” John said, actually a little surprised that one of the cafeteria cooks of all people thought so highly of Sherlock.
“Probably should,” Sherlock mumbled.
From what John could see through the thick glass she wasn’t very tall, with long black hair, very pale skin, dark eyes, and she wore a suit. She just stood there watching the fish - no phone out taking pictures, no drawing pad sketching, no texting, no graduate school students taking notes for their ichthyological studies - just those creepily dark eyes staring and flicking between John and Sherlock in a tank full of other more interesting fish. When John came close to look at her, her eyes went to him and she studied him as he drifted by. Her gaze made him wish he had eyelids to blink with.
John didn’t see Sherlock again until a couple hours later. John had brought down his laptop and was fiddling with the new cable when a question for Sherlock occurred to him. Just then he heard a cabinet rattle.
“But you said you were his enemy,”
“You mean he does this all the time?” John asked.
Surfacing that night, John was met with a pair of lips on his forehead before he could even wipe the gel from his eyes and ears. Sherlock, as always, beat him out of the water and when John finally emerged he was ready for him with the towels regularly left for them.
and complex emotional swirls of happiness mixed with urges of
John felt the harsh sting of the needle as Billy hit the plunger hard and fast, pushing more of the drug back into John’s system. The nightmarish feeling of melting returned with a vengeance almost immediately, leaving him at their mercy again.
He dug out the laptop he’d buried in his things, figuring he’d never get it to work again without the cables. The first thing he did was type out an email to Harry, apologizing for upsetting her. His next act was to look up Sherlock’s website.
“I need you, need you now,” John ground out thrusting with the three fingers in Sherlock’s hole until the motion was a smooth slide again. Sherlock was still gasping, his brain now projecting a continuous stream of large fingers breaching him, and pain, a massive cock, and agony and a hand on his neck pinning him down. John pulled out, and there was a momentary loss of contact as Sherlock distantly heard the tear of a condom wrapper and the pop of the lube cap. Then there was a blunt pressure at his anus, a hand stroking up and down the line of his back. Sherlock tried to breathe properly, tried to shake his head clear of the invasive memories that refused to back down.
“The man is dead; we found him in one of the rooms Bellamy wrecked. Somebody shot him. Couldn’t have been Sherlock; Bellamy wouldn’t have freaked out like she did if Sherlock had been the one to fire the gun.”
“Bored, something new,” Sherlock mumbled. When his eyes finally met John’s again they quickly veered away. “I didn’t steal anything,” he said a bit louder.
They both drifted there, resting in the afterglow, until the small fish in the tank presented a problem. Well not a problem per say, they were just cleaning, pecking lightly at John’s belly and swarming around the area where he’d ejaculated. It was when a handful of them came for Sherlock’s softened penis still in its condom that they took offense to the cleaning and decided to move. Sherlock pulled the condom off and took it with them to the surface to discard.
“You are staying with Hyperion tonight, aren’t you? It’s certainly the best course of action considering the high amount of stress he’s endured today. There should be blankets there already but they’ve not been laundered recently.”
“Ah,” John smiled, “and you are part of the absolutely massive gossip vine living in this place?” He chuckled, munching on a crisp.
Sherlock’s mind began to wander, not focusing on much of anything, other than the feeling of the rope on his wrists, the blindfold’s fabric against his cheeks, and the bed sheets against his still hard cock. He rutted his hips gently against the bed, trying not to move as much as possible, but wanting that little bit of increased stimulation. He didn’t realize John had moved, so focused on the small pings of pleasure he was getting, until there was suddenly breathing next to his ear again and John’s voice, gravelly with arousal.
“How-” John started.
“Who’s Dr Hooper?” John asked
“Yes.” He noted a very faint grim note to that yes, as if this being a permanent thing could be anything but good. His eyebrows scrunched.
Considering that information it sounded hellish for Sally. Every breeding season she had to deal with encountering her ex again and again even though she had been faithful to Molly and Irene for years. And there was Sherlock just throwing it in her face, reminding her that it’d be happening again soon. Probably using the increased number of bruises to indicate that she was seeking more and more time with her lovers than normal, with the impending relationship ugliness looming ahead.
John could feel that he’d struck a nerve mentioning Victor as he watched Sherlock sort of crumple in on himself. What once had been balanced and moving with perfect posture now sat on the floor, no more lotus poses and relaxation, just a look scrawled across his face of wanting to forget Victor even existed.
“We want him… and you,” the man said thickly, with a voice that sounded like he had a mouth full of gravel. The man’s face was pale and featured a broad pointed nose; when he spoke John noticed nearly all his teeth looked sharpened. Neither man wore masks or any kind of gear; they were both dressed simply in jeans and jackets with a burgundy scarf around the unconscious one’s neck, and a red tartan one on the one currently holding Sherlock hostage.
Hyperion yawned a massive, jaw-cracking gape, the giant barrel of his chest expanding behind John as the rest of Hyperion’s body lengthened out once his mouth snapped closed. His long neck flexed outward, his back arching and limbs and wings stiffening out away from his body momentarily as he stretched away the sleep, transferring the feeling of a good full body stretch over to John as he relaxed again with a large sigh.
“It’s you,” John said glancing at Sherlock.
When the dragon lifted the crate off the ground Hyperion was unfazed by the slight jostling of the box. John, however, felt his pulse skyrocket and he felt a little dizzy. he heard a little static come from handset on the wall.
“Precisely, I had Bellamy helping with lines. It was a rather impromptu decision on my part. He’d been honing his stabbing techniques on a homeless man of roughly the same build as his would-be lover near the theater. The victim had died after the first few strikes, had been moved, and then stabbed a number of times post mortem, apparently they got a taste for the feeling of a knife going through something. Personally I would have suggested a pig carcass to vent frustrations on, but unhinged people of that caliber are rarely open to suggestion.” Sherlock was just talking now, John standing as a comfortable thing to hold, he assumed. He wouldn’t complain, he liked the feeling of Sherlock’s chin on his head and the feeling of his voice sinking through his back. Sherlock was just barely rocking the both of them side to side as he spoke, it was a little hypnotic, something John felt he could definitely get used to if Sherlock wanted to do more of whatever this was they were sharing.
John took the box while sending gratitude through the bond and settled in to eat. The warm food did improve his mood, and as if the kitchen had read his mind from afar they had sent a thermos full of tea. The hot familiar taste of the tea helped immensely. John downed both drink and food quickly. Hyperion nudged at John’s feet when he was finished, concern twining with hopefulness over the bond ‘you’re okay?’ John smiled for him.
“No, oh, no, just unexpected that’s all,” John said, chuckling a little to lighten the mood and show Sherlock that he honestly didn’t mind the contact, only that he’d just been caught off guard by the ambush kissing.
“The flat? Sherlock, we’re not done here?” John said incredulously, surely he wasn’t trying to act like it all hadn’t happened. A raised eyebrow asked him to continue, a silent ‘I’m listening’.
“Not really, no,” John admitted, wondering why Dimmock of all people would know the man.
John couldn’t help but smile a bit at Sherlock. He enjoyed listening to that voice rattling off facts about dragons; about as much as it seemed Sherlock liked showing off that knowledge. John poked at Hyperion’s drowsy end of the bond to ask if Hyperion would like to have some new plants from Bellamy’s pit. Hyperion replied with a happy feeling yes, but followed quickly with a strange negative feeling that made John’s nose crinkle accompanied by a memory of a young Hyperion’s tail crushing a small Lavender plant,
He hadn’t expected it to feel so damn good, why had he been afraid of it all his life, why had he thrown up and passed out over the thought of flying?The positive deluge of emotions coming from Hyperion made him question everything. His heart was racing again, this time in a good way, adrenaline and ecstasy from the other end of the bond mixed in John’s brain and actually brought a laugh to John’s lips.
Having slept through the night, John was more awake during the beginning of the day. He watched the people outside, ignoring the occasional reverberating bangs from particularly over enthusiastic children, circuiting between the window levels. That day they were visited by a couple of school groups, the groups of little yellow safety jackets making them easy to spot through the thick glass. John could vaguely hear joyful cries at the sharks drifting past; they didn’t seem to really care much about him or Sherlock other than pointing and saying how big they were.
“I’m just as displeased by our current situation as you are,” he heard Sherlock say, the man already descending the stairs towards the pile of clothes set on a shelf.
“Sherlock. Sherlock! Get back here.” Lestrade called, rounding the table to head Sherlock off before he could reach the door "What the hell is all this about! You’re not going anywhere until I get some answers.” Lestrade commanded, brooking no argument and looking like he was ready to physically body block the door to keep Sherlock from leaving.
“Come with me,” she said, indicating the open door of the car at the kerb. He looked at the car then back at her. The abrupt, no-nonsense text and the woman in a black car sent off small red flags of suspicion in his mind but he carefully tamped them down in an attempt to not worry Hyperion, who remained resting on the other end of the bond.
John thought holding the suited man’s gaze.
Sally said her farewells and retreated down the stairs, leaving John in the messy flat with Hyperion worrying away in his head and Mrs Hudson puttering around in the kitchen with the tea.
“The eggs, the marks on the woman’s hands and arms indicate she is an egg caretaker. Most dragon eggs need to be kept at higher temperatures in order to hatch. They also need to be turned and moved, meaning a caretaker will eventually bear the marks of prolonged working in such an environment: tougher hands, old burn marks; judging by her age she’s been at her post for years.”
Hyperion suddenly grunted and closed his eyes, all the muscles in his face scrunching into what John could tell was a grimace. John arched an eyebrow as he slid off the muzzle looking at the now stiff dragon, mildly confused until he looked back and saw that Molly had taken the opportunity to slip the needle between Hyperion’s scales and stick him, depressing the plunger easily. Hyperion’s muzzle remained wrinkled even after she removed the dreaded needle.
, John thought. The foyer was dimly lit only by the light shining through the sheer curtains, but further in at the other end of the hallway a brighter light was visible. John followed it.
“She’s the one who rescued me. I saw her this morning at breakfast.”
“Home, then?”
“It was Bellamy’s idea,” Sherlock mumbled.
“I swear she’s a good woman, just her and Sherlock rub each other the wrong way, have since they were first starting out,” he sighed, rubbing his hair back. Sherlock-- the name sounded odd in John’s mind. It had an eccentric ring to it, and from Sally’s ominous warning maybe there was a reason the name sent a tiny thrill up his spine.
John grinned inwardly. “I still love you Sherlock. I’ll be here when you want to come out,” he said and John got one last sheepish feeling before the tendril pulled back under the doorframe.
“Actually I would like to see the flat,” John agreed, following Sherlock to stand. While Sherlock’s yawn had been fake, it inspired a real one from him and made John realize just how tired he was after their long night of insanity. The wounds he’d sustained may have been healed in the final transformation but their effects were still felt, lumped in with the sheer exhaustion of staying up all night and well into the morning.
“I can inconvenience them without being able to fly Bellamy,” Sherlock grumbled, reaching out for an offered glass.
“You’ve also got a little cubby here with some food you can eat during the flight; and if you feel like you are going to be sick, there are vomit bags in here too, but we hope you won’t have to use them,” he said cheerily, pulling the items out of the small cubby hole for him to see: a few packs of snacks and water as well as the paper sick bags.
“Blood?” John guessed, looking to Sherlock with raised brows. Sherlock was already reaching for equipment, trying to get a sample of the old mark. Silence followed for long moments after as Sherlock ran his tests.
The world fell silent for John for a while and he was happy with that. It wasn’t entirely quiet for him with Hyperion in his mind, but the world around him was still. The only sounds were the comforting bodily huffs and gurgles of Hyperion’s innards working, heart thudding away at rest, and the very distant sounds of movement in the Aerie, a far off dragon’s roar being the most that penetrated the privacy of Hyperion’s room. John eventually laid down with his back still against his dragon, keeping that contact. Hyperion’s resting mind continued to wash over John’s, calmly learning more about each other. The stronger the bond grew the more John could read the curiosities and the concerns; John would think of something and Hyperion would react with a feeling that John could translate as ‘what is that? Where is that? Who is that?’ and so on. John was beginning to feel the same from Hyperion, thoughts, flickers of images, and he would barely break the silence to whisper questions about what he received from Hyperion.
“Oh Jesus bloody… Hyperion,” John called, scrabbling in the sand and only making the tangle worse. A single claw descended and hooked the blankets, lifting John off the ground just enough for the mass to loosen and John to come rolling out, phone plopping out along with him nearby as Hyperion gently shook it loose. John dove on it, finally silencing the thing and seeing the message he’d left for himself of ‘go get breakfast.’
The new watch’s alarm wasn’t nearly as bad the next morning. It was still obnoxious with its staccato beeping but at least it wasn’t blaring through a few layers of hangover headache. They woke together, John kissing Sherlock before untangling himself from his arms. They continued with their normal routine of getting undressed and into the water, both grimacing as they peeled away their soiled underthings gone a bit crusty and disgusting in the night.
Sherlock was chuckling in his ear afterwards when they leveled out and it only made John’s experience even better, hearing that gorgeous laugh right at his shoulder.
“Who said that was the killer’s number?” Sherlock asked pausing and looking at John.
“John, John, John,” Sherlock’s mind chanted absolutely drunk on his mate. John left his mind open to him and Sherlock’s dove into that loving and eroticized place like one starved, as though just a couple nights before he had not fallen asleep to the loving caresses of his John.
"Bullet holes, hmm?"
"No!" Holmes now looked near frazzled with dismay, eyes wide, his careful composure disheveled. "
“Holmes?”
My mouth fell open. “Holmes,” I began, appalled.
“Listen to me, Holmes,” I said, and allowed myself to finally breach the distance between us by stepping forward. He watched me wearily, but not in any way to make me believe he feared my closeness. And against better wisdom, the urge to finally approach him and take the liberty I’d never been offered, to wrap him in my arms, was incredibly powerful.
it to,” I said, shaking my head. “Some may prefer…“frippery”, as you called it, but it's hardly a requirement. I have been a part of relationships with both men and women, and their definitions came from
I thought, with swelling conviction, and with the tap of my stick I executed an about-face and advanced in Holmes’s direction, intent on catching up to him with speed.
“Curious,” Holmes said, eyes alight. “The entire building has been disassembled.”
beneath creek water until I could fight no longer?”
I smile at him. “And you say you’ve no talent at this.”
my dear fellow,” Holmes said, with simmering triumph in his eyes. “
There were men out there who could be responsible, in some way, for Holmes’s demise. Blackguards who would have happily shoved him off the precipice under Moriarty’s orders themselves. The idea was so unacceptable that my entire body seemed paralyzed with it, with horror and injustice and a rage so monstrous and painful that I could scarcely see. My hands spasmed with sudden violence, fingers twitching for the handle of my service pistol. If one of them stood in front of me now—
“Ms. Tarlton was too young and too earnest to have known the truth. And she cared too much for the young Smith. Besides, while in her room, I checked her boudoir.” He ignored my noise of disapproval. “Mrs. Marker, as she said, had been attached to the manor since before Nicholas Coram purchased it. She would have known, at least, that another room existed, or at least that renovation had occurred to obscure the presence of one. Thus, I surmised she had a role to play, and that we might find evidence in her apartment. If the murderess was on the premises, she would have been soaked to the bone making her false trail to the gate and back again. She would have been pressed to dispose of her wet gown somewhere out of sight. Mrs. Marker had her own cottage, and space in which to hide the frock.”
“You got it, Mr. ‘Olmes,” Wiggins said, saluting. “C’mon, Fred!”
“He suffered a gunshot to the left shoulder. Through and through, with no arteries struck in the process. He will be fine. Hopkins sent for a doctor to aid him as well, after you were attended to.”
A moment of silence as I absorbed this information, and I shook my head in disbelief. Such a secret, in so unassuming a country manor. I was beginning to truly understand Holmes’s weariness of the foggy lands outside London’s borders. “So you determined that Coram was a Russian nihilist by his art and his cigarettes?”
“The bar is just—”
“You have successfully engaged my interest and my services, Mr. Ables,” Holmes said. The boy practically spasmed with joy on our couch, straightening like a ruler.
“I take it this chair was not
The inspector and I followed Holmes's brisk foray up the stairs, trailing behind the maid. The second floor mirrored the first, a long hallway on either side of the staircase with rooms lining north and south. Holmes halted as we stepped into the east hallway, canting his head left and right down the hallway.
“I am…better than I was last night,” she offered timidly. She dropped her chin, thin hands wrapped round herself. “It was quite a shock, to find Mr. Smith in such a state, and to watch him…” Her voice went thin, like paper submerged in water, but she recovered herself admirably, looking back up to me. “Thank you for your concern.” She held my eyes for a moment, saying nothing more, and I blinked when Holmes suddenly cleared his throat.
“I’m quite alright, it’s merely a flesh wound—”
“I see,” Holmes said, as I furiously took notes. A missing Chilean director’s board and a unique electrical prototype. Things were beginning to take shape, I thought, but I could see nothing the clearer for it.
“I will be
I closed my eyes, fingers curling around the pipe with trembling care. My heart yawned and swelled, seizing between my lungs. The world tilted around me, pressing in too close and unsteadying my knees, and I threw out an arm to catch myself on the mantelpiece, fingernails carving into the wood as my leg gave out. I clutched the pipe to my chest with my free hand, face twisting in pain.
“I am comfortable with that arrangement,” I said, perfectly soppy, and the intensity of his gaze waned.
and when we met eyes, the sentiment I found there made my heart go still. There, burning, was a determination and willpower that took hold of me, forging a covenant at my core made by the strongest faith I’d ever known.
The case continues to unfurl.
"Your business?" I echoed, shocked. "Johann—
"You are the farthest thing from
Dr. Watson.” Her eyes, brown as chocolate, met mine. “You have a wonderful way with words, Doctor. The two of us found your writing to be terribly thrilling.”
“The...the news has turned for the worse. I did not want to risk exposure...or bring the police to our door. And I did not expect I could go often without you suspecting something.”
“Perhaps they feared getting caught fleeing back through the hallway,” Hopkins reasoned.
That voice, that dark twin of my own, rose up again in my mind like a shadow. Its words shook me, rattling me to my marrow.
“It seems I must rectify this error,” Holmes continued, barreling through my protest like a steam engine. The frustration in his voice had dissolved into something less heated, but equally determined. “I am not angry. Disappointed, perhaps, in myself for being so incredibly unobservant about a man with which I have shared lodgings, who I believed to know to the very habit—” Again, I winced, “—but that lack of attention is my deficit, not yours.”
I thought, with a vehemence that seized me like a clenched fist.
“But already I am concerned, Mr. Larssen.” Ink-black eyes moved to me, narrowed into slits. “We instructed you to come alone. For all of your sakes, I pray your man is not a member of the Yard.”
I stared at him, at his anguish and hesitation, and believed he was the most beautiful man I had ever seen. How could I not? How could I look at him and want anyone else? How could I deny him anything, let alone my heart, when he already possessed it?
“This is an absolute scandal! It’s always the same with these rail companies, no respect for the customer!”
Feeling rather adrift without Holmes at my elbow, and irritated with myself because of it, I gestured for Johann to pour me another glass of cab. I did my best not to interpret the knowing look on Johann’s face as I moodily slid my fingers around the stem. For several minutes I sat and sipped, and soon applause went up and the singer June went into a bow; even my mood was not immune to their talent, and I clapped my hands together with the crowd too. As the noise died down and the band cued up for another set, a sudden voice echoed at my shoulder.
Holmes’s eyes flickered, smoke transfiguring into iron, and I could not help the faint, smug smile that broke across my face.
“Yes, sir. The best. I don’t know where he’s gone or what’s happened but I’ve
a medical doctor, Holmes."
“No? If not in that, perhaps they share blame in the disaster of yesterday,” Holmes said, voice cutting across me like a thin blade. “After all, how was it that Coram knew to relieve you of your service pistol? It was not
“Tools?” The man blinked rapidly before flushing a disconcerting magenta. “Oh! The tools, yes! I’d almost forgotten about them, I need to clean those off and put them back in the work shed.” He shook his head like an old spaniel. “Might be easier just to leave ‘em outside. Smells like rain, it does.” Almost on cue, the distant crackle of thunder met my ears, rumbling lowly over our heads.
His voice was muted enough that I had unknowingly drawn closer to hear it. I stared hazily at him, my heart pounding. He was near enough that I could smell rosewater once more, that singular perfumed scent Holmes’s keen senses preferred above all others, and it intoxicated me. For a frozen moment, I thought I caught a glance of Holmes’s eyes sliding from mine to my mouth, just as I was drawn to consider the soft, inviting pink of his.
“Okay,” John replied with a smile in his voice, the admission that Sherlock liked John’s singing was enough to make his already romance flooded heart do a little flip. A little niggling thought made him almost laugh, wondering if Sherlock had secretly listened to the times when he’d indulged in his silly side singing in the shower.
Sherlock had been staring hard at the phone the entire time. “What do you mean?” He asked quietly, barely blinking as his gaze bored into the non-descript black smartphone reading ‘unknown’ across the caller ID.
I said I would finish this fic and I mean it, its not abandoned I just had a lot going on over the last couple years. Thank you any readers still here for reading this fic even though its a WIP, I hope to have the next chapter done much much sooner than two more years from now.
“So what does Mycroft do then? Other than sit in a taller chair.” John asked, raising an eyebrow at the GrandMaster, who puffed up in indignation.
The cafeteria was actually fairly empty once he got there and from the looks of it dinner was in the process of being cleaned up. A few people sat around talking, a pair of riders still in their gear and looking rather windswept were finishing their food, and a whole round table was taken by a group of nestlings in their distinctive uniforms, books and papers scattered all over the table and murmuring amongst themselves. The bar was open, a few people sitting at it nursing their drinks.
John dove on him, throwing him from the bench to the floor and attempting to pin him. When he tried to grab the guy’s wrists to twist them behind his back, however, they slid out of his hands as though greased. Using this to his advantage, the very tall stranger pushed and bucked John off, turning over and taking a swing at him with a large fist. They grappled together on the floor for a moment, John catching his wrists individually and trying to pin the larger man and gain control by sitting on his bare stomach. The man suddenly turned his hands in John’s grip and pulled, leaning up quickly to headbut John hard. Dazed, John was flung off and the man scrambled to get up, squirming away as John clutched his face. John reached blindly and grabbed a slick ankle, getting enough purchase on the large foot to bring the man crashing face first back to the concrete with a wet slap. John hastily straddled the guy’s back again and pinned both wrists to the floor.
John watched the little fin go up and down as Sherlock started folding and unfolding it furiously near him, he was beginning to think his friend had finally lost his mind when he started to see a pattern to the flicks. A dash a pause a couple more dashes here and another pause there.
“Might be time for us to head home,” John finally said, saying what he’d meant to before Sherlock had cracked and confessed his affection. John started to shift to get up, rising to his knees with a twinge to tell him that yes he’d been sitting on a hard cold surface for a little too long.
Sherlock paused in his pushing John to don the new clothes, “No, I said Hyperion might want to get indoors, I said nothing about the weather.”
John thought, biting his lip as he felt his eyes start to burn with tears. He wasn’t going to cry; he wasn’t, after the shit of the last week, to cry over a tiny picture while sitting on his nice, clean, hospital bed at that moment just didn’t seem right. The time for tears should have been over a week before, when he had been told that the conflict he’d been carried away from had been a complete slaughter. John put the picture back into the bag and continued to stuff his things in on top of it much quicker than he meant to, biting his lip as his eyebrows furrowed, his nose began to run, and a lump formed in his throat, his body preparing to cry even as he tried willing it not to. In the end John shoved the duffel to the end of the bed, clumsily packed, while the unwelcome tears started to run down his face. He clenched his fist against his fatigues sniffing hard in a last attempt to stop the tears.
“I,” Sherlock began, then paused when John rubbed over his chin and up his ears. “I find that I am rather… fond of you, John,” he said a smidge awkwardly.
“He wasn’t flying battle formations, even when he was out,” Sholto sniped.
“I eat, but the stomach slows the brain down digesting. Thus, less eating around cases.”
As they reached the dragon hall they began to encounter other workers starting to go about their days, all of them avoiding Sherlock as he swept past.
Sherlock’s face remained a mask of upset for a little while longer before his chest rose in a massive sigh. “I guess you’re right John,” he said, looking to John tiredly.
“And an hour’s practice will not suffice.”
“Then how does it ‘work’?”
At least half of any kudos I get for this story are dedicated to my beta, Emma Ockham, for all her helpful comments and suggestions: thank you!
“I take your point, dear boy, but what other options do I have? Practical instruction is hard to come by. I suppose that I could recruit a streetwalker for the purpose.”
“Oh, all right.” John sighs. “Yes. He was… very good at his job. A good person, too. And…”
“Pretty or not, I am not in the least attracted to her, and she is becoming aware of it.”
, as you put it. For instance: someone who has previously been uninterested in sex but would consider attempting it with you.”
He dropped the act at last, his shoulders sagging with weariness. The spell broken, I released his arm and stepped away. Our eyes met and held, and heat flooded my cheeks as I realised fully what intimate nonsense we had been talking. I half expected him to retreat to his room, but instead he poured a generous glass of brandy and pressed it into my hand, before taking an equal measure for himself. I sipped the drink gratefully, relishing its burn against the sudden ache in my chest.
A moment later our client’s husband, Mr. Christopher Jennings, emerged from the house. He was a little shorter than Holmes, but must have doubled him in weight; the ample coat that he wore was tight about his midriff. Like his wife, he was fashionably dressed and almost excessively well groomed, the curl of his moustache clearly the product of intensive labour. Passing onto the street, he glanced about him, straightened his cuffs, then set off in the direction of Oxford Street.
The magnitude of that error was only now becoming clear to me; the defiance in his voice and defeat in his posture sent the realisation twisting through me like a knife. I had believed him indifferent; I had thought that my marriage posed no greater threat to our friendship than a change of lodgings and an additional claim upon my time. But he had rightly seen it as the reckless abandonment of all that we shared.
Just as the coach was stopping for the gates to open, John saw Sherlock leaning against the wall looking forlorn.  He gave him a smile and a wave and did the phone gesture to him as the coach pulled off.  Sherlock raised his hand and gave a wan smile, just before John passed out of sight, and then he moped back up to the school.  He hoped that John’s journey would be as quick as possible so that he could get to his phone and start texting him.  He didn’t know how he was going survive ten days at this rate, when John had only been gone ten minutes and he was already suffering.  The journey home didn’t bode well for Mycroft, but as far as Sherlock was concerned, that was his problem.
“Sorry, John.  Go ahead.”
“As you wish.  I will be home later this evening if I might persuade you to dine with me.”
“Oh, silly.”  John started giggling again.  He tried to put his hands down the neck of the gown trying to push the sleeves away from him.  “It won’ move.”
"Sherlock, stop teasing.  I need you now."
John smiled fondly at him.  “Have a look in my kit bag; in the side pouch in a padded bag.”
On the stage Mollie, played by Jasmine, and Detective Inspector Trotter, played by Matthew, were having their discussion as to why he had turned up at the hotel.  The detective was shaking off his jacket and handing it over to Mollie to hang on the coat stand by the door, when there was a loud, creaking sound.  Everyone looked round, wondering where the noise had come from.  Jasmine looked at the doors, thinking that one had come off the latch and was opening, but they all seemed to be shut so it couldn’t be that.  The next thing she knew, she was flat on the floor with Matthew lying on top of her, gasping haltingly, as everyone else was shouting and running on to the stage.
Sherlock carefully pulled John to his feet and walked him over to the bathroom.
“Fuck me.”
I can call you that, can’t I?  You are mine and no-one else’s.
“I admit you are sometimes a little lacking in the tact department,” John winked at him, “but I don’t understand how people don’t think what you can do is amazing.  The way you can observe all the little things that no-one else even notices and put it all together in an instant to solve the most complex puzzles; it’s astounding.”
“Sounds good, let’s go.”
“Well, possibly; I’ll have to think about that one, but for now, is there anything you would like to declare as being off limits?”
John yelled and his eyes shot open.  He stared at Sherlock above him for a moment before he nearly knocked him out because he sat up so quickly that their heads only just missed each other.  John leapt off the bed and backed away until he hit the wall, his hands outstretched, fingers convulsively opening and closing rapidly.  Sherlock wasn’t sure if John was reaching to grab him closer or push him away like an apparition so he sat on the edge of the bed to be as close as possible without being too intimidating.
“Food is boring.”
"Oh yes, me too.  Touch yourself for me.  Let me see you come.  Please, Sherlock."
“Better, but not quite what I had in mind.”
Keep safe my love.
“I hardly ever slept over with them, you know that.  In fact I very rarely even spent a whole evening with them without interruptions so I wouldn’t know.  Anyway that point isn’t really relevant any more so it doesn’t matter.”
“It was the party, wasn’t it?  I remember eating and drinking and Jasmine being vaguely pleasant to me, which was a surprise.  Did we dance?  I sort of remember holding you and waltzing, but not a lot else, I don’t think.  No, wait, Greg was there, wasn’t he?  Something about legs, what does that mean?”
John grinned at the challenge and rolled Sherlock over, but instead of holding him down he moved his leg out of the way and rolled him back again before sitting on the backs of his thighs, keeping him in place whilst he trailed his tongue down Sherlock's spine, leaving a mark on each vertebra as he went.  John massaged Sherlock's buttocks as he made his way down the spine, edging his hips lower down Sherlock's legs as he went and when he got to the base he smacked Sherlock's arse cheek hard, then bent down to kiss it better.  Sherlock groaned under him so he did it again on the other side.  He bit down on the red mark he had made, not hard enough to break the skin but enough so that Sherlock felt it.
Was that an eye movement?  Did the lash flicker?  Sherlock bent forward to look even more closely at John’s face.  His nose was practically touching John’s when all of a sudden John’s eyes shot open and he saw Sherlock right up in his face.  John yelped in shock and tried to jerk his head back though all it did was push into the pillow as he had nowhere else to go.  Sherlock pulled back at the yell but recovered quickly and leaned in, hugging John as tightly as he could.
Sherlock knew John was very gregarious and had lots of friends and he had never wanted to stop him from seeing them – well, not much anyway.  He knew that would make John unhappy, which was the last thing he wanted to do.  He was not interested in other people himself, however, and John was all he had in the way of friends and that was the way he liked it.
“That last boy nearly caught me.”
“You’ll love it – although asking for the truth part is probably unnecessary for you as you know everything already,” John laughed.
The second night had been just as good, with even more parents at that performance as the end of term drew ever nearer.  The entire team had been jubilant, as they had also performed a matinee earlier in the day for the rest of the school, and had received enthusiastic cheers from their school mates on a show well done.
“No, no, it’s nice to have you here…, I mean, it’s nice to have someone here.”
“It’s not a joke, John.  These are very real.”  With that he brought his arm up to his mouth and sank his fangs into his arm and then pulled it free to show John the puncture wounds; two thin trails of blood dripping down his arm.
The rest of the rehearsals had all run smoothly up until now.  When they had had the first dress rehearsal the previous week, it had looked amazing to see everyone in full costume, and it had really brought it to life for them all.  A couple of days before the first performance, they had been allowed to set up on the main stage and leave everything in place.  It was nearing the Easter holidays and the drama classes had all had their end of term assessments so the room wouldn’t be needed.  Luckily the rugby team had not had a match that day so the whole cast had been free to move in all their furniture, scenery flats, doors and props.  They got it all arranged ready for a full rehearsal on the Sunday afternoon.  Seeing the stage fully set was exciting for all of them.  They stood at the back of the room to proudly take in all their hard work for a moment, before they got set up for a run-through with everything in place.
“It was extraordinary.  Quite extraordinary.”
"Oh you did.  We're moving on to the next portion of the evening.  Now for every correctly answered question one item of clothing will be removed.  You can choose if it's from me or you but I'll choose which item it is."
Sherlock reared back on to his heels.  What?!  Did John know what he was saying?  He clearly didn’t realise he was still talking to Sherlock if this was his secret.  What exactly had he been given – was it some sort of truth serum?  Is that really what John thought – did he love him?  Maybe he just meant as a friend – but then, why would he consider that a secret?  John seemed quite happily accepting of his own feelings so it surely wouldn’t be out of embarrassment.  What could he mean then?
“That sounds like fun, can I do that, too?”
"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you then."
“Still, it could have been worse.”
“Of course, I would, but still no.  No-one else has ever been as accommodating as you with regards to my deductions.  You’re welcome to strut your stuff up there, but I’d rather not.  I’m willing to help you learn your lines though.”
It was only two o’clock so he probably had a couple of hours before John got back.  He lay back on the bed, deciding to make himself comfy whilst he waited.  He put the jumper over his chest so the edge of it was covering his lower face and he just relaxed, going to his mind palace whilst he tried to imagine how the rest of the day was going to play out.
You have been found.  You are safe – well, you will be soon.  Mycroft found you.  I’ll never hate him again.
“If you had any doubts over your own feelings in the matter, however, then just think about your last remark.”
“He said that your father would never allow his son to be forever linked with a lowly gardener’s son.  I knew my father’s job didn’t bother you, but I never wanted you to feel slighted by your peers or disappointed with your choice.  I vowed that I would make something of myself and come back to you as a successful surgeon with a high powered job, a place to live in London and the ability to keep you in the manner to which I knew you were accustomed.  Then it all went to hell and I got shot and now everything is lost.  No job, no house, no money; nothing.”
"I thought you wanted it all, John."
“He was at his funeral? Well, of course, he bloody was – bet he loved that, didn’t he; everyone there just for him; seeing me making a complete arse of myself.”
“Me, too.  All I could think was that it was too late.  I’d missed my chance and I’d have done anything to have gone back and done it differently.  Are you really telling me that you want that, too?”
John grinned down at Sherlock as he climbed off.  He helped Sherlock to roll over, easing his arms into a comfortable position and placing a pillow under his shoulders to provide some support.  He moved him up the bed slightly so that he could bend his arms out to the side and his shoulders weren’t left in a strained position.  He also put a pillow under Sherlock’s hips so that he wasn’t putting too much pressure on his very erect cock.  Once Sherlock was comfy John climbed back on, settling himself on Sherlock’s nicely rounded arse.
As the questions needed more complex answers so Sherlock gave John more and deeper kisses.  After a few more on the lips he gave the next one on the neck.  He dragged his teeth across the skin from the curve of the neck all the way up to John's ear and nibbled on it.  John groaned and tilted his head further over to allow Sherlock more access and Sherlock took full advantage.
“It’s not obvious to me.”
John looked across at Sherlock, his mouth dropped open.  He loved Sherlock’s voice at the best of times but hearing those dulcet tones perfectly pronounce such vulgar words with special emphasis on the final syllables just left him in awe.  Sherlock took in the dilated pupils and the held breath and moved towards John, holding his mouth close to John’s ear and dropping his voice even deeper.
"I'm told the initial puncture is similar to that of a needle injection, but as soon as the endorphins are released it causes sheer delight."
What Matthew had spotted, luckily just in time, was that the creaking noise was coming from the chandelier.  He had managed to push Jasmine out of the way just as it crashed down where she had been standing.  Matthew was holding his leg, and when the others gently rolled him away from Jasmine, they could see that he had a rip in his trouser leg with blood seeping through.
Sherlock cut the ropes holding John’s arms and legs tight against the chair and carefully rubbed some circulation back into them, trying to avoid the raw skin where John had pulled against his restraints.  He lifted John’s head gently, taking in all the injuries, piecing together exactly what strikes John had received from their placement and silently wishing he had taken longer to bring down John’s tormentor to have got in far more retaliation of his own.
“You can’t tell someone something like that and not expect them to freak out.  You just sank your fangs into your own arm, for fucks sake.”
“Yes, but then as soon as we’re both properly awake you pull away and leave me there so I must be doing something wrong.”
John straightened his shoulders and stood up in front of Simon.  He had a perfectly polite smile on his face, as far as anyone watching them would observe, but underneath he was seething at the way Sherlock was being treated.  It was only made worse by the fact that it was so commonplace to Sherlock that he was just accepting it and not fighting back.
Mycroft’s people had, indeed, been very busy – he would have expected nothing less.  They had a man in place who worked in the embassy in the old town and he had been sent round to Sherlock’s most recent address from where he had last made contact.  Unfortunately, when he’d got there the partially furnished flat had been trashed.  Sherlock didn’t have many personal possessions with him as he travelled with only one rucksack so it was easier to move around, but what he did have were scattered across the room.  The mattress and chairs had all been ripped open and everything else was overturned, cupboards emptied and the contents strewn across the floor.  Somebody had obviously been looking for something.
Sherlock got into the four by four and was soon motoring back towards the base where he was speedily transferred to a jet for the last leg to take him back to London.
“Well that can be easily rectified.”  John grinned at him.  “Get yourself on the bed and I’ll be right with you.”
“What’s brilliant is that I won’t have to spend the holidays with my brother.  I can’t wait to show you off to my cousins.”
"She actually arrived earlier today and we met them for lunch.  She said she would be happy for him to come after Easter Monday, if it was convenient with you."
John smiled at Sherlock and kissed his nose.  “You’re actually just a big softie, aren’t you?”
“You bet your arse I am.  Would you like to prove it?”  John smiled at him, challengingly.
“I wrote to you for the first year, Sherlock, but when I didn’t hear anything back I gave up.”
"Oh, it's no imposition at all.  As I said, it was lovely to have him, and he kept Sherlock out of mischief."
“You’d do it so easily; you’d know your lines after the first read through.”
Now, finally, the day had arrived and he hugged his mum and sister goodbye at Peterborough Station, as they were continuing their journey on to Kings Cross, whilst he was changing lines and heading towards Norwich, where Sherlock would be waiting to meet him and take him onwards to his home.  Once the train his mum and sister were taking had left, John went over to the platform to wait for his own, as it wasn’t due in for another twenty minutes.
How did I do?  Are you tearing this letter up as we speak, never to darken my letter box with another comment?  I will wait and see if I receive a reply.  If I don’t I will know your opinion and you don’t need to worry about me bothering you again.
“John, what is it?”
20th August
“Sherlock.  John.  Great to see you.  You’re looking well.  How are you feeling now?”
He and Sherlock had been working together for almost a year now and it had been the most fun he had had for years.  They had hit it off from the moment of Sherlock’s very first deduction and John hadn’t stopped marvelling since.  If those feelings of amazement had morphed into a serious case of attraction, then that was nobody’s business but his own.
“No, of course not.  Thanks, Nurse Clarke, you’re the best.”
“You stupid, smug git!  You won’t be laughing soon; you’ll be singing like a canary.”
“Hi John.  Whatever you’re having is fine, thanks.”
This last week whilst you have been with me, finally receiving proper treatment for your injuries, has been perfect.  Not seeing the pain you have been in, of course, but just getting to spend all my time with you again has, at last, started making it sink in that you are back with me.
"I don't suppose there's any chance we could go for a ride, is there?"
Sherlock grinned.  “It did look real, didn’t it?  I modelled it on that frog we dissected when I was ten, do you remember?”
John was miserable, not so much about Trudy; he had been disappointed but he had more or less got over that; what was worse was being away from Sherlock.  They spent practically every day together in the usual order of things and he was feeling lonely without him.  They’d been apart for odd weekends when John had gone home to see his mum; and last summer holidays Sherlock had gone with his family to visit his grandmother in France, but John had been at his mum’s at the time so it hadn’t seemed quite as bad with them both being away at the same time.
“Ah, now that would be telling, wouldn’t it?  I’m sure you wouldn’t want me to spoil the surprise.”
I know it’s selfish of me but I like that this relationship thing is all new to you.  It means that you are all mine and I get to enjoy everything about you all to myself.  I relish the thought of being able to show you so many new experiences, just as you show me so many fascinating things about the world around us that I have never noticed before.  You are quite right in saying I see but do not observe most of the time and I love that you are willing to share everything with me.
“Oh get away with you, Mr Watson; you can’t charm me like that.  What seems to be the problem?”
John settled on the bed and Sherlock sat in the chair in front of him, biology text book in his hand.
John was a bit reluctant but the boy seemed genuinely interested.  He got his guitar out, which he had left behind the chimney, and set himself up comfortably.  He fingered through the first couple of notes but wasn’t happy with it so he stopped, cleared his throat and started again.
John found himself always thinking of Sherlock in other ways too.  He tried to make him eat and sleep, wanting to keep him at the peak of health, but regardless of how little food Sherlock partook of he never ran out of energy; and as tired and restless as Sherlock appeared during the day he seemed to come to life even more at night, never flagging as John did himself.  It didn’t stop John caring though, he was a doctor, that was what he did and he had sometimes caught Sherlock giving him an indulgent, endearing look when he didn’t think John was looking.
“You’re lying.  I can’t have died.  I’d know if I was dead.  I wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you like normal if something like that had happened.”
“Quite.”
“You are a wicked man, John Watson.”
“I never stopped thinking of you when I was over there and I had a little piece of you that helped me through a lot of tough times.”
“Maybe it’s just a nationality thing?  I knew exactly what you meant, John; it was very funny.”
“How?  How are you here?  You’re dead?  I saw you die?”
“You know how rarely I sleep so I don’t see that it will be an issue.  Even if I do, we have shared a room before when we’ve been on cases and you never complained then.  Would it be a problem?”
“Save John… must save John… won’t say ‘nythin’.”
“Please.”
"We will, of course, have to be very quiet.  Do you think that's possible?"
He walked up the stairs with the bottles rattling in his bag to encounter Sherlock in the doorway of the kitchen.
“How could you tell something was wrong, though?” Greg asked.
"Thank you," he said again, quietly, deep sincerity in his eyes.  John smiled at him.  That was what a proper John smile should look like.  Sherlock was happier than he could say, that he seemed to be entitled to stand with this man by his side.  He'd never been more proud.
“So, Sherlock, John says you could tell everything about him just from looking at him and his room.   Can you do that with everyone?”
John threw his head back, laughing, as he took in Sherlock's straightforward delivery and acceptance.
“John.  I know that this will be hard for you to believe but… I’m a vampire.”
"Well, I had a thought about that.  You have that big, empty, private shower stall just waiting for someone to step inside.  We need to be very quick getting ready, so we'd be saving time and money and be environmentally friendly, if we were to share said shower, wouldn't we."
John looked at Sherlock again and nodded his head once.   Even after all this time he could still tell when Sherlock was faking it and there were no signs of that now.  John leant forward and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s own.  They both took a moment to relish the closeness to the other; realising that what they had both been wishing for could actually come true.
"Is that going to be a 'thing', now?"
“Let’s just take it one step at a time.  Maybe if we release a bit of dopamine for you, it might allow your brain to relax a bit and you can take your time and enjoy all these new sensations.  I don’t want to overload you.”
“This will not always be an easy stratagem for you to use to manipulate me, Mycroft.  I deign to accept because I wish to and for no other reason.”
"Oh, I'd love to see them some time, if you didn't mind.  I'm interested in science myself."
“You might as well help yourself.  I know you rushed out too quickly to have stopped for anything to eat before you left this morning.”
“Thanks, that’d be right nice of you.  Mrs Johnson does like a good drama.  It’ll be nice to see you boys in action.  I’ll look forward to it.”
The man backhanded him again and John thought he felt a crack as his nose was possibly broken.  The man left him to wallow in his pain and went over to join his associate who had just been sitting quietly in the corner, watching all that was going on but not taking part in the beating being inflicted upon John.
“I have.”
“What if we were kidnapped and blindfolded and I had to find you in a line of people hanging with their arms above their heads?  You should always be prepared for every eventuality.  You should know that with your medical training, John.”
They passed the rest of the day quietly with Sherlock making John tea and bringing him a sandwich at lunch time, all of his own accord without being asked and John was delighted and thanked Sherlock sincerely every time he did something for him.  Sherlock also helped him get up when he needed to relieve himself and he walked John over to the bathroom with his hand resting comfortably on John’s lower back, accepting the smile he received.
“Oh Sherlock, I meant to say I can’t come over tonight, sorry.  Mary’s parents have invited me round to the embassy for tea so I can’t refuse something like that.  Sorry, it’s such short notice, but we weren’t doing anything important, were we?  See you tomorrow anyway.”
“Is that all you can say?”
“Oh, God, yes.”
"Hey, don't look like that.  I'm not ashamed to be seen with you, Sherlock.  I... I just want to have this as our thing for a little while.  Is that okay?"
“That’s rubbish.  You love it when I praise your observational skills.”
They had gone out for their usual evening stroll and Sherlock made sure to wend their way towards Regent’s Park, one of their favourite spots, as he could sense John’s nervous energy and wondered if he would finally work up the courage to ask his question tonight.  Sherlock had sensed it was in the offing and done all he could to give off positive signals to all of John’s overtures.  He was finding it almost entertaining to be pursued in this way as usually he was the one doing the chasing – well it wasn’t even chasing, the thralls just fell into his lap with no effort expended at all.  This time he was happy to let John take the lead.  John was the sort who liked to be in control and Sherlock hoped that when his secret did come out John wouldn’t feel so much as if he had been tricked if the whole thing was his own idea.
“Watson,” he said, and I looked up with a guilty start to find that his all-seeing gaze was fixed upon me. “You have had two hours of sleep at the very most.”
, it is the happiest ending that can be achieved.”
In the light of this explanation, I could not help but revert to my initial concern, and ventured to suggest to my friend that a perusal of ‘
My hands were on his belt buckle before I recollected his inexperience. “Should I…. I’m sorry. Is this too much?”
cease to consider.”
“It wasn’t just about what I did,” Sherlock says, quietly. “It was about you, and the way you responded to me. I’d never imagined it would be so intense.” He stares into the middle distance for a moment, biting his lip. “If you’re willing to reciprocate…”
I shook my head in affectionate exasperation. “I am
I had always been aware that Holmes cut a fine figure. Given our situation as fellow lodgers, however, and his professed distaste for sentiment of any kind, I had taken pains to suppress the excess of my admiration, for I had no wish to torment myself, or to risk our friendship, by nursing an attraction that I knew he would disdain. This approach had worked well enough thus far; obliged now, however, to evaluate the effect of his appearance upon a potential conquest, my eyes lingered on those features that the adjustments to his costume now accentuated: his pale throat, his elegant wrists, and the muscular curve of his hips. Heat prickled beneath my collar, and I cleared my throat.
Surprised, Sherlock reaches over and passes him the bottles from the bedside table. John warms the lube in his hands then spreads it generously over both of them. His cock is already tingling again, just at the thought of what he’s about to do.
He raised an eyebrow, and leaned back in his chair. “Very well,” he replied, after a moment’s consideration. “In that case, it is an offer that I cannot refuse. We shall begin this evening, when you return from your rounds.”
In answer, he stepped forward abruptly, and crushed our lips together.
John gapes at him. “No, I didn’t! We only…” He breaks off, narrowing his eyes. “Oh. You utter prick! You just said that so I’d contradict you.”
“The truth is, madam, that my friend is an arrogant fellow,” I remarked in a cheerful tone. “He is accustomed to seeing ladies, and indeed gentlemen, fall at his feet if he so much as bats an eyelid in their direction. Your immunity to his charms was a perplexing mystery and a blow to his ego. When he observed your very natural response to the beautiful young lady who called upon us a few minutes later, I am sure it was a tremendous relief to him in every respect.”
“That was wrong of me. It was not a matter to which I had previously given much constructive thought.”
Holmes was in the grip of one of his black moods, and had spent much of the week either prostrate upon the sofa or pacing the room with restless energy, sharpening his tongue upon such well-worn topics as the failings of the justice system and the futility of human emotion. I, by contrast, had been courting a former client of ours, the charming Miss Mary Morstan, and had reached that delightful stage in our relations when I was reasonably certain of her affection and was contemplating an offer of marriage. I was therefore far from agreeing with my friend’s assessment of love affairs in general. I humoured him, however, and asked why he believed that our client-to-be wished to consult with us on a matter of the heart.
He stared at me, lips parted, a flush creeping over his face. I took his hand and caressed it with shaking fingers, unable to help myself, unsure of what else to do, since he remained silent. The momentum of my declaration dissipated fast, leaving me exposed and overwhelmed. I watched his face, shuttered now as his eyes dropped to our hands. I steeled myself for his rejection; I felt, to my wonder, his fingers intertwine with mine.
He stopped, and turned to face me with a look of determination. “Watson… John, I am quite certain now that I do
Here, everything was heightened: his warmth, his scent, his pulse beneath my lips, as the most intimate part of him strained towards my touch. His fingers flexed against my scalp as I pressed hot kisses to his shaft before taking the head into my mouth. He shuddered as I swirled my tongue in a half-forgotten motion, his incoherent imprecations deteriorating into a moan. My saliva pooled at the bitter, salty taste of him; with the slick I stroked and massaged the flesh that my mouth did not cover. After only a few minutes he was thrusting helplessly against me. I placed a steadying hand on his hip, and an instant later he cried out and spent himself into my mouth.
There is something in his tone that unsettles John. In fact, Sherlock has deliberately steered the whole conversation into awkward territory. Not for the first time, John wishes he had the foggiest what the man is driving at. “I… don’t have a problem with people being gay, Sherlock,” he says, cautiously.
for all of three weeks.”
“Were many guests present?”
“I think our experiment was worthwhile,” John remarks, sounding as warm and relaxed as he can. “Don’t you agree?”
“They indicate that my husband has a most unhealthy obsession with my affairs!”
Then, one wild, stormy evening, Holmes returned home dishevelled and breathless, his eyes alight with excitement. He ran his fingers through my hair in greeting, peeled off Escott’s goatee beard, then dropped into the armchair opposite me with a hearty laugh.
I cast my mind back over our interview, but could recall nothing worthy of remark. “She seemed extremely composed, despite her initial hesitation,” I ventured at last.
“What’s age got to do with it?”
The room temperature seems to have risen several degrees. John feels distinctly hot under the collar. He suddenly becomes aware of how close together they are sitting: when he looks up, Sherlock’s face is only inches away. He looks quickly back down at Sherlock’s injured hand, which he is cradling in his, and the heat creeps into his cheeks.
“She does not care for music.” He loosened his bow with meticulous care.
“About two hundred.”
“From the moment we met, I have wanted more from you,” he said hesitantly, after a pause. “I cannot understand it; you are an anomaly in my life. I have wanted you to be more than a fellow lodger, more than a colleague and, now, more than a friend. And I want to be more to
“I’m glad to hear it. You have much left to teach me.”
Unfortunately, Sherlock’s bedroom turns out to be as untidy as John has ever seen it. A small bonfire’s worth of books and papers are strewn across the bed, and Sherlock darts forward with a muttered apology to clear some space, transferring his work into seemingly random piles on the floor. Aware from long experience that touching Sherlock’s clutter is counterproductive, John makes no offer to help, but simply watches him from the doorway, torn between exasperation and amusement. “I thought you’d planned this whole thing?”
“In this case, it does,” I countered, my throat constricting with the import of my words. “Holmes, I would never presume upon our friendship. If you do not wish for this, consider the subject closed between us. Yet… if you could ever…”
For reasons that I could not quite explain, the heat rushed into my cheeks at this question. I then flushed still harder at the thought of how my reaction must appear to Holmes. For several minutes I was quite unable to meet his eye; when I finally did so, his gaze was intent and speculative.
“So I suggest,” Sherlock continues, undeterred, “that to start with you have sex with a man you know and like. Preferably someone who’s interested in conducting his own experiment in parallel to yours, so there’s no question of anyone being
The sight was so incongruous that I burst out laughing. He looked up, startled, but did not appear in the least embarrassed by his occupation.
Then I went to Baker Street.
“I confess that, since you did not explain it at the time, it made no lasting impression upon my mind.”
“Our very own love affair,” he remarked, with a wry smile. “Complete with hesitations, false beginnings, blushing disavowals, and even delicate euphemisms, if I recall correctly.”
We had embraced before, notably on the day of my ill-fated marriage, but we had never done so alone in the intimacy of our apartment, with no other claim upon our attention than the patter of rain against the window panes, and the soft chime of the mantel clock. Pulling him closer, and feeling him relax against me, soothed tensions that had plagued me for longer than I could remember. It was like stepping in from the winter cold to a warm fire and a glass of mulled wine.
“Rhetorically. Right.” John fights the urge to giggle. “Sorry to steal your thunder.”
“No, wait!” John exclaims. “Let’s get this straight. Um… unintended irony, there.” He takes a few deep breaths. “We’ve only been sleeping together for what, half an hour?”
“Oh. Yes!” Sherlock exclaims, more loudly than he probably intended. “Okay. Good.”
marry you.”
“Wait!” Sherlock gasps at last. “I hadn’t finished…”
He exhaled sharply and closed his eyes. An instant later, however, all traces of reluctance vanished from his face. He squared his shoulders, sank his hands into his pockets and assumed an air of jaunty confidence. A few paces away from me he stooped, as if to pick something up from the ground. When he straightened, a small pearl bracelet was dangling from his fingers.
“God, yes!” John exclaims with a thrill of triumph, and stands up quickly, pulling Sherlock with him.
“Jennings has other victims!” I exclaimed.
I could not help but smile at so convoluted an evasion of my question.
“I am perfectly well,” I sighed.
With these words, he handed her the brown folder that we had retrieved from Jennings’ office the night before. She bit her lip as she perused its contents, but displayed no other sign of emotion as she passed it back to him. “I do not understand your meaning.”
oooOOOooo
… Yes…”
I stated in the official record that Holmes seized my hand as we crept through Milverton’s conservatory. Battle-hardened, I could see in the dark as well as he, but the thrill of breaking one law was immeasurably heightened by simultaneously defying another. I did watch him with a ‘glow of admiration’ as he opened the safe: admiration not only at his criminal skill, but also at the manner in which he knelt upon the carpet in his tightly-pressed dress clothes, his forearms bare, his cheek pressed almost tenderly to the metal as he manipulated the brass knobs with dexterous fingers. Those fingers found mine, once more, as we stood in quivering suspense behind the curtain, watching Milverton converse with his murderous visitor. Throughout it all, our position could not have been more perilous, yet with Holmes at my side I exulted in the danger. After destroying the contents of the safe, we ran for our lives out onto the vast expanse of Hampstead Heath, where we stood laughing in breathless triumph as the icy wind whipped around us.
“How very tedious,” I agreed, straight-faced.
“There’s a definite pattern here,” Sherlock murmurs, more to himself than to John, and then suddenly he becomes purposeful, narrowing his focus to a few sweet spots he’s identified. Now every touch is exactly as John needs it, attuned to his responses, sensual and unrelentingly precise. The effect is electric. As the pleasure escalates he can concentrate on nothing but Sherlock’s fingers and lips, and soon his whole body is straining towards Sherlock’s, so that a firm caress or an open-mouthed kiss which he enjoyed before now make him writhe and gasp. When Sherlock finally,
“Excellent!” Holmes rubbed his hands. “Thus, my dear lady, your husband has no further hold over you at present. And at this point, objectively, my advice to you would be never to give him further cause for suspicion. Should you choose to ignore this advice, however, I have a further offer to make.
Sherlock thinks that every square inch of my skin is more important than the solar system.
(See the end of the chapter for
Holmes had likewise turned towards me, and the warmth of his expression stole my breath. “My very dear friend has, as ever, found just the right words for the occasion,” he said, his eyes lingering on mine before he returned his attention to our client. “I confirm that my discovery of your inclinations was truly of no consequence to me, except insofar as it answered a question that I had posed myself, and furthered my interest in your case.
