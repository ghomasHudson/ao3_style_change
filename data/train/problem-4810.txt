Dean’s just starting to work up a steady rhythm when the door behind him clicks, and the handle turns. Dean freezes in place, hand still on his shaft, as he turns his head in horror to see Cas walking in. He’s looking down at his phone as he closes the door behind him, but then he looks up, taking in the scene, and his mouth falls open, his eyes widening behind his thick-rimmed glasses.
“Are they real plants?” Dean says, peering through the gap just as Castiel had done a moment ago.
“Well, yes, he’s down there every other day to fetch bread and pastries.”
As he stood waiting for Dean to fuss over a large bowl of what looked like foamy water, he wondered whether Crowley had cast some other spell to ease his way. Perhaps he’d drawn Dean to Castiel? No, he’d said he wouldn’t be able to intervene.
Dean grimaces at that. He doesn’t need the old man’s approval, but the idea that he won’t have to face his disappointment is kinda welcome. Before he turns to leave, he leans in to murmur to Missouri, “Hey, what’s the deal with this ‘council?’ I’ve never heard them called that before.” Adler was one of the directors of the Grove, the company that produced enchanted batteries for the magic-using population across Kansas and beyond.
“Who are these new arrivals, to hold the room in such a thrall?” Lady Antonia asked him as they walked forward.
"Tonight?" Winchester asked, sounding as surprised as Castiel was. When Castiel glanced at him, he was met with a deep scowl.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It wasn’t an epic,” Castiel complained indignantly, but his eyes were soft, so soft that Dean tumbled into them and had trouble climbing back out again. There must be quicksand beneath the stormy blue waters, Dean thought. He’d simply have to stay. “Though if you want to write one in return, I wouldn’t complain. Poetry, perhaps, or a sonnet…” Castiel teased gently.
Benny is standing next to Castiel—tall and sturdy, clad in a blue sweater that’s probably gonna make his eyes more beautiful than the freaking ocean. Castiel and Benny both have their backs to him, thank god, so maybe he’ll get away unseen. But when the hell did Cas get here? Who invited him up to Dean’s apartment while he’s literally naked in the shower?
Before he can leave the room, though, Cas calls out, "Wait, Dean?" When Dean turns back to them, Cas adds, “Actually I could really use a bathroom break. Could you hold her for a few minutes?”
Ahead, the ship's wheel was spinning freely back and forth with the swell. Dean realized Garth must have been hit in the head by something, as he saw the guy sprawled against the trunk they kept weapons locked in, unconscious. He was damn lucky he hadn’t been thrown overboard, that was for sure. Benny grabbed the ship's wheel on the left side and Dean did the same on the right, and they wrenched it around until it was more or less steady. Lightning flashed right overhead, and thunder boomed only a second later.
He starts to cast the ritual the way Missouri taught them over the last few months, before his father’s words echo in his mind from years ago, “
Castiel can’t help but wrinkle his nose at the stink that’s coming off both of them—they’ve obviously been out in the desert a few days at least, and the dust from the High Sierra has painted them both with grime. Dean tries to sit back down beside his brother, but Castiel nudges him out of the way. “Let me. Why don’t you go get cleaned up? You smell like a Croat’s armpit.”
Dean’s pink blush has spread to his neck and cheeks now. “That’s, uh…that’s kinda morbid, but…probably true.”
Castiel inclined his head. “That is true. Mister Singer”—his use of the title felt pointed, but Dean let him finish before rising to the bait—“was kind enough to give me at least a brief run-down of matters, but everything has been a bit of a whirlwind, I will admit.”
Castiel spared a glance back to where the unfortunate mermaid was cowering, sobbing against the sand, then swam after Amelia. “Wait, Amelia. Who was that? Who are these people?”
But here, at the Mana Bar in the heart of Palo Alto, magic is plentiful enough to allow him to use it, at least temporarily. He pulls the water up from his glass, carefully shaping petals around the pen “stem”, then blowing on the finished product to tinge it pink. The watery flower glitters in the overhead lights, not looking exactly like a rose, but close enough. Castiel looks up to see surprise and delight on both Charlie and Dean’s faces.
Gabriel let out a hum as he looked around the space, swimming over to inspect a large box filled with shiny bits and pieces. “This is…” He trailed off again, shaking his head.
The Captain steps forward, smiling at Layla as she takes her hands. "You're looking better," she says, echoing Castiel's own thoughts.
“Shame,” the boss says conversationally. “I've heard your young daughter has just started there this year, actually. It would be a pity if something were to happen while she was off-campus…”
He and Dean followed the dance, stepping forward and back, then switching places with one gloved hand raised and palms pressed together. Dean shared a secret smile with Castiel as they came together again.
“Nah, that’s okay, buddy. You just sit tight. I’ll go…go tell ‘im."
Castiel stretched again, under instruction, and Dean drew his cloth back swiftly, gulping.
No, what is he doing? Having fantasies about a guest in his house? One who’ll be gone in a few days, never to be seen again? The idea horrifies Castiel, yet at the same time, entices him.
Dean closes his eyes, enjoying the feel of Cas’ palms on his jaw, on his cheek. Soft lips press against his once more—he opens up to let Cas taste him.
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, shutting the door before he has more surprise visitors. He hits his forehead against the wood, willing his erection to go down. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
He gasps as Cas' dry fingers brush under his balls. "Cas? Cas, I'm gonna—"
“I’m not one to gamble,” Castiel said thinly—though he looked, at least, somewhat less stiff than he usually did when disapproving of Dean’s hobbies. Perhaps there was hope yet for removing whatever stick was lodged up his otherwise gorgeous—
As Dean moves his hands to either side of Cas, his warm palms against the back of Cas’ hands, Cas has to close his eyes. The rush and euphoria of Dean’s magic enveloping him makes his head spin for a few moments, until he brings it under control and draws the magic he needs to begin casting.
Castiel loses it, thrusting forward suddenly, then over and over into his fist like he’s fucking Dean’s face. He squeezes to make it tighter, letting out a rough moan as he feels his climax approaching.
“Yeah, well, what’s it to you?” he grumbles, feigning annoyance as he wraps both hands around his sandwich.
What was happening back in Atlantica? Had anyone noticed he hadn’t returned to the home cavern last night? With Gabriel gone as well, it might not be until his next fishing rotation before the alarm was raised.
Dean squinted, feeling some kind of slight he had no idea how to address. “Well, perhaps,” he agreed, vaguely. “You were saying?”
“I have not,” Castiel replied quietly, his eyes flickering across to Dean’s chest somewhat reluctantly, Dean felt.
Castiel stares at Anna in surprise. He’s so tired he doesn’t think he could heal so much as a scratch at the moment, not without eating something at least. Anna must be retaining some of the energy Castiel poured into her from the Well.
Dean starts with a "But—"
Rosco shrugs. “Ruby brought in a Winchester a week or two back. Sam?” The kid hadn’t actually introduced himself with his full name, but Rosco had done a little digging before bringing him into any other secrets.
Balthazar boomed at close range. “Let me introduce you to some pretty
Cas looks him carefully in the eye and asks, "Is that alright with you, Dean?"
“Glad to hear it.” Gabriel squeezed Castiel’s shoulder. “You had me worried for a while there. Come on, Dad wanted me to look out for you.”
Did anyone notice that in this chapter, we finally wrote in the gorgeous art posted way back in chapter one? If you don't remember, go check it out after dropping a comment below!! Supernatastic really captured the spirit of our story with that amazing piece of art. <3
“Yes, Dean, so close, just talk to me,” Castiel says, tone needy and urgent.
a boy who’s a friend who he occasionally sucks face with?
The wind ruffles Sam’s hair, and as he speeds down the lane between the wrecked cars, he feels just for a moment like he’s flying. He lets out a whoop, and hears Dean’s laugh…from a distance.
When he steps through the translocation barrier and finds himself back in California, the sun is dropping low and the air is about ten degrees warmer. He heads towards the apartment block where many of the staff live, nodding to the security guard as he approaches the door.
He needed to get up—Bobby would be expecting him at the shop today. By the time he roused himself enough to scrub at his face in the bathroom, the house seemed deserted. John often wasn’t seen before midday, but Dean wondered where Sam had got to.
Amelia smiled, and somehow it was not at all reassuring. “Are you sure? The Sea Witch’s magic is very powerful. You’d be able to see your human again…” She reached down to pick up the pieces of the two dancers, slotting them back together with their hands joined once more.
Castiel pulls the encyclopedia out, the smooth hardcover in immaculate condition. It was only published in the late 1990s, but as far as Castiel could tell when he’d looked into it at Oxford, it had immediately been restricted, with only vague reasons recorded.
Castiel catches a glimpse of the uninfected man now, as he steps clear of the group of Croats for barely a few seconds before moving back into his cover. He’s of an average height and build, but Castiel’s already-racing heart leaps into his throat as he sees the man’s face, and his yellow eyes.
Castiel and Dean disentangle their hands clumsily, faces burning and eyes cast down.
The bramble patch within the walls is much smaller now, but the gap in the wall on the other side of the garden is still thick with them. That doesn’t seem to stop the Croats, though—the first one pushes through the tangle, Dean staring with horror as the thorns tear streaks into the man’s hands and face. He crashes through, crushing the stems underfoot, and Dean notices that he only wears one boot. The other bare foot is caught under some thorny shoots and the man crashes to the ground, shaking Dean out of his frozen state. He pulls the shotgun up to his shoulder, firing at close range to blast the guy’s head apart.
"He's a good friend, isn't he?" When Claire nods, Dean adds, "You sure his dad will be okay with him eating cookies at school? He's not allergic to egg or something, is he?"
“Can’t say I disagree,” Castiel says carefully, “but what’s in it for you?” He doesn’t want to outright suggest that Crowley isn’t gifted, but he’s finding it difficult to believe that the guy would just do this for some philanthropic reason.
The giggly little blonde who dangled from Dean’s elbow as he cleared the table of pennies was a nice enough girl, he supposed, but it did seem that every time he was forced to step out beyond the comforts of the Roadhouse Inn and into finer society, the women got younger and younger and the men older and more bitter. It was his age, he supposed. Women of his birth year were edging toward the upper-end of marriageable at a frightening pace, but as a man he was lucky and could do as he wished.
Wait,
“Sure, after you moved to England?” Dean replies, running his fingers down Castiel’s arm gently, the movement soothing.
Dean nods, and they both dash inside, only stopping a couple of times for Dean to push Cas against a door frame to grind their hips together, or Cas to pause on the stairs to lean down and kiss Dean deeply, his hands framing Dean’s face.
The murderous look on his face had probably chased the raindrops away.
Sam huffed in frustration, a wild kind of look in his eye that sent a chill down Dean's spine. “Nothing! I'm just telling it like it is. You'll never be the son dad wants you to be. Just give it up, Dean.”
"Three?" the barkeep asks, looking Dean up and down like he might be considering how best to eat him.
Prisoners being dragged away, or shot in the streets. All the people, the innocents, he couldn't save.
He slips his phone into his messenger bag and sits back down. He considers asking the librarian for help, but she’s looking stern and unfriendly as she casts between the shelves, books flying haphazardly around her head. He opts out of that option purely for self-preservation.
“After talking things over with Doctor Moseley, I can’t get into many details about the space around the Well. But there’s a powerful ward around the perimeter with these weird runes and symbols—” Dean pauses, a woman clearing her throat loudly at the table in the front, “—and that’s also not something I can say here. Got it, Professor.”
Before Dean can lean in and kiss him again, there's a shift in the magic within their circle of trees. The air feels less tight suddenly, as though they can finally breathe again.
His efforts at communicating his own thoughts and feelings with Castiel were rewarded with a wide, soft grin that crinkled the sleepy corners of Castiel’s slightly hooded eyes and thoroughly destroyed any intentions Dean may have been harboring to get them out of bed and to the dining hall for breakfast.
“Now, Cas,” he hisses, and floods Cas with magic.
Sam huffs, sounding unsure. “What, when he used to call us ‘idjits?’”
But how did Crowley have a copy? He looks over at Crowley, peering at him as he stares out the glass windows over the lights of the city, one ankle resting on the opposite knee.
. Fuck, there’s a big ol’ ball of guilt and shame, someone he’s pushed out of his mind over the last few months. He’s pretty sure he still owes her an apology, the first of which being that he couldn’t get it up even when she was kissing his neck and rubbing against his cock. Yet he can get hard, just standing in the same freaking room as Cas…
“How does this work, exactly?” Dean whispers, trying not to focus on how closely they’re forced to huddle.
“C’m’here,” Dean whispers, reaching his hands out and cupping Cas’ face. He kisses him, just a chaste brush of lips. The warmth of the kiss fills them, the power of the bond renewing their strength, and Castiel kisses him more insistently afterwards, the tear tracks on their cheeks smudging against each other. Finally, Dean feels like he has some clarity, some peace of mind. There is another option that they haven’t tried yet, even if it’s not a great one, and he thinks in Cas’ direction…
“Honestly, thank you, Dean.” Cas smiles as he turns towards him.
Dean laughs, and it’s so joyful that Castiel’s eyes snap back to him in wonder. The fairy lights glimmer and shine in Dean’s eyes as he gazes into Castiel’s, and Castiel has to remind himself all over again that this is really happening, he’s definitely here and not in one of his dreams.
A half-hour later, the two men strolled down the Strand, top hats and tailcoats back in place. Castiel had always liked St. James’ Park on his previous visits to London, and he’d taken his morning constitutional this way many mornings since his return. At this time of the evening, though, it was much more busy.
, of course.”
“Hurry up, boy,” Bobby rumbled as he held the door open. “Don’t let the morning air in from that drafty hall.”
“Must be, if you’re still hanging with me,” Dean says, giving him a fond look.
“What the use of having a cat if it won’t let you touch it?” he asks, giving the cat the side eye. "You'd better not have fleas."
Dean’s voice is strained when he asks, “Who else have you two…?”
Castiel turns back to the security camera footage—the Croats and their uninfected follower are gone from this view, but he quickly scrolls through to the next camera, by the gate. He’d better get moving, they’ll be there in just a few minutes.
“Awesome. I'll get started tomorrow. Least I can do.” He beams, and Castiel's heart does a funny little flip in his chest. “Speaking of,” Dean continues, grabbing the empty bowls and getting to his feet, “I’m getting those berries.”
Castiel moves his palms together until they are touching, then says, “I just need you to amplify, please. Would you put your hands around mine?” He feels awkward asking for this, but he’s rather not burn through his energy from lay magic while inside the illusion. It’s risky this close to the well with all this raw magic zinging around, but he thinks it’s worth a try.
Dean speaks up, “Two El Sols, please.”
Dr. MacLeod narrows her eyes at him, then continues. “Right. Well, the original casters got something wrong with their design—and within a short time it became clear that the Well contained too much energy and had started to become unstable. So, the university created a team to repair it, or design some spell to shore it up. The Seal was never originally meant to restrict access—only to keep the Well from disintegrating. One of the team was your great grandfather, Henry Winchester.”
The back wall is nondescript and blank off-white, with several desks set up along the back of the stacks. But in the center of the wall, looking oddly out of place, is a large wooden door, peeling red paint and rusty hinges giving it an ancient appearance. Castiel was told on his first-day tour of the university that behind this door lies the Seal—the means by which access to the Elemental Well is restricted. The area is out of bounds for both students and teachers, except under the strictest of extraordinary conditions, and attempted breaches are met with firm repercussions.
Sam had been just as busy as they, taking the only clue they had about the demons themselves—that they seemed to be repelled by certain holy things—and writing out for them every Catholic chant, exorcism, or prayer that he thought might assist.
He does notice the silhouettes of two security mages standing just in the shadows beside the porch, though. The third disappearance earlier in the week has rattled the college community again, after they’d let their guard down in the months since the others. Castiel isn’t sure how they’re going to get anyone to replace Professor Moore, if the wards aren’t enough to keep the faculty safe.
“We haven’t visited her grave in a while,” Sam continues, the corners of his eyes watery, “and we should do that soon. But you know Mom would’ve loved Cas. And she wouldn’t want you to ruin your relationship just because you’re afraid.”
The bartender fills three glass tankards with ale, placing them on the bar in front of Dean one by one. When he's done, he looked expectantly at Dean. When Dean just stares back into his eyes, his brain unhelpfully flatlining, the guy says, “Your name?”
Bobby appears in the doorway. “Grub’s up,” the old man says. "Ash, Pam, come to the table, wouldja?”
He hears Sam huff out a laugh, then he pauses before adding, “Oh, you’re serious? Jesus, Dean, you didn’t sleep with him, did you?”
Sam was in the kitchen when Dean dragged himself down there to find something to eat.
The professor does a complicated series of hand motions, as precise yet familiar as something out of an advance spellcasting textbook. Watching Cas perform such traditional magic makes Dean realize how often his friend incorporates his own flair, how natural and well-honed his thaumatech skills are. His abilities have always been impressive, regardless of the magic he’s doing or the source he’s drawing from, but Dean likes it best when Cas gets creative. As a mage, he’s like a figure skater or an orchestra conductor—smooth and elegant.
“It's an awesome set-up,” Dean says.
“It was powerful,” Cas agrees. “I think it drained some of our energy, depleted our magic…”
Castiel leans into him, resting his head against Dean’s for a moment. “What would you like to do?”
"Yeah, gonna meet Benny at the Anchor. Rest of the crew too, probably."
“Sorry, Claire Bear, he’s just woken up from a nap so he’s a bit spaced. You having a good holiday, there?”
He loves every fucking minute of it.
“Okay,” Castiel smiles as they share a heated look, then he turns back to the book, as Dean starts typing.
A snatch of whispered conversation, “Just forget about him, Castiel. He does not deserve such devotion when it is entirely unrequited!”
After what feels like hours but may have only been a few seconds, Cas hears a scuffle behind his couch, and he opens his eyes to find that the electricity has gone. There’s still something powerful racing along his veins, but he’s not on fire, so that’s a start.
“He’ll likely be fine then,” Dean comforted—himself as much as Alfie—as he straightened his morning coat and nodded to the door. “Nonetheless, do you mind if I…?”
Castiel followed him, taking in the shadowy bulk of the church, surrounded by its churchyard crowded with gravestones. Further along the road, a two-story building housed a public house, lights still burning brightly despite the hour. Castiel could just see a sign swinging in the breeze, reading “The Adam and Eve” in the dim glow from the gas lamp above it.
"Like what you see?" Pam asks with a smirk.
A wet splatter pulled him out of his daydream as Cas wrung the water out of his shirt, scattering cold drops all over Dean in the process. He replaced the shirt, muttering under his breath, while Dean sat there and shivered slightly. They needed to get inside and changed, quickly.
“Dean? You up, brother?”
After some time passes—it could be three minutes or fifteen—Dean lifts his head, searching Castiel’s eyes.
“My topic, though,” Sam pointed out, “was a valid one, I’m sure.”
Dinner was a raucous affair. Lady Donn was no wilting maid, and with Balthazar Roche at her side near the head of the table, the plates piled high with venison and goose, and the cups filled frequently with good Madeira wine, it wasn’t surprising that many guests were bawdy by the time the ladies departed.
“What are we doing, Cas?” Dean asked eventually, his voice barely a whisper.
Dean doesn’t look convinced, but turns back to the spellwork, his eyes following the glowing lines of the manifestation. “I think so, though it keeps moving—it’s gonna be impossible to hit it.”
He blinks, looking up at Dean's horrified expression. "It's okay, Dean. Just reversing the exhaustion component. Like a…a double-shot energy hit."
Crowley disappears after Dean and Charlie, and Rosco stands by the door, checking his phone and blocking the entrance. Castiel wonders how he can sneak past, whether it’s worth trying to find another unlocked door, when a car drives around the corner of the building and comes to a stop out the front of the library. He watches as Rosco opens the side door to drag someone out of the car—someone tall, with a long mop of hair and hands bound behind their back.
“Dude, stop...we’ve gotta go,” he says, missing the contact of Cas’ mouth on his skin the moment he pulls away.
"I know, baby," Dean murmurs. "So good. So good..." He begins to rock back and forward, gentle, but sending shockwaves through Castiel with every movement. As Castiel clutches Dean's hips as he moves them faster and harder, Dean leans forward and kisses Castiel deeply, desperately, his hands back in Castiel's hair.
“Well…” He clears his throat, eyes reaching up to the ceiling, trying to figure out how to get the notion floating around in his head translated into coherent words. “I, uh…I guess to me, magic is like a car, and the mechanics of a spell are like an engine. Identifying what’s wrong with a spell means knowing what a spell
Annoyance makes Castiel snap, “Well, pardon me for stepping in and stopping my student from getting hurt.” He regrets his tone immediately, especially when hurt passes across Dean's face, followed by disappointment.
Cas lifted his eyes to Dean’s briefly, and Dean smirked at him with all the heat he could muster before he turned his back, resting his arms against the edge of the empty tub now in front of him. He felt fingers run across his back, lightly across the skin above where the corset was fastened with thick-knotted laces, then more heavily around where the linen stretched around his side.
“Hello, Castiel. Can I interest you in a beer?”
Castiel shrugs. “I don’t know about ‘bring down,’ but I think we all agree that we’re interested in making magic more available to lay magicians, right? Perhaps there doesn’t have to be some big revolution for that to happen.”
Castiel tries to wipe the water out of his eyes with his sleeve but it’s no use, the rain is still hammering down. He startles as a body looms out of the corner of his eye, but it’s Dean. Dean, alive, and in mostly one piece. Castiel swallows the tight feeling in his throat and drops the grenade launcher to the ground, as Dean slams into him, hugging him tightly.
Castiel gazed down at the amulet in wonder, then lifted the cord to hang it around his neck. The stone glowed faintly where it rested against his chest. “Thank you,” he murmured again.
Sam crunched his way through his apple slices as he listened, both men slouching on the bench and relaxing with each other in a way they could not in other company.
“Hey,” Dean protests, cheeks flushing red. He had hoped his crush on Cas hadn’t been that obvious, but apparently he was wrong. It seems a little silly to be embarrassed now that their friendship has developed into something pointedly
Now he gets his first good look at Castiel’s lean body, his skin smooth and as human-looking as any other person Dean’s been with. In fact if it wasn’t for his eyes—those glossy, black eyes staring down at him—anyone would mistake him for a human. A human with a gigantic, rock-hard cock, Dean mentally adds, sure he must be gaping as he takes in what else has now been revealed by the demon’s flasher coat.
Cas stares at him in disbelief. “No, no. I am not taking part in some fake relationship. This…” he waves a finger between their faces. “We could never make this look real. Definitely not.” He stops talking, realizing how close they’re standing, the way their faces are only a few inches apart. It’s…distracting.
They order pizzas from the local delivery place, and as they’re eating Dean says, “Next time, Claire and I, we’re gonna make you our signature pizza. Way better than this stuff,” he says, mouth half-full and waving his piece in the air.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs as they get closer, “are you sure this is a good—”
“Jesus, Dean,” he pants, the adrenaline rushing through him as he watches one of the Croats stumble. It’s not a headshot though—the unfortunate man shuffles back upright, staying in place. Why are they just waiting there like that?
“Any time,” Castiel answered warmly as he got to his feet. “If you’ll excuse me…” He turned and headed across the lawn to the screened area set up for male guests to relieve themselves behind.
keep their relationship secret from their family and friends. Would Cas mind him telling Charlie?
Cas’ words send a thrill through Dean’s chest. He’s wanted this too, but his thoughts are short-circuited when Cas moves experimentally, just a shallow thrust in and out. A gasp escapes him, and Cas stills again, but Dean suddenly doesn’t want him to stop. “Come on, Cas. Give it to me,” he says, aware that his voice is broken and desperate, but not caring as Cas lets out a rumbling groan and starts up a rhythm, pulling out and thrusting in, hard. The slapping noise of skin against skin is obscene, and Dean fucking loves it, leaning back into each thrust and letting out a shout when Cas gets the angle just right for fireworks to explode in his vision and down his spine.
There’s a lot of honest ways to answer that question, but zero that don’t make Dean sound like a neurotic weirdo. Still, he doesn’t want to start their relationship by hiding things—he’s already kept this thing with the Captain secret, since broaching a subject that serious could impact things between them. So, in the name of truthfulness, he opts to admit, “
Dean nodded firmly. “Yes. Let’s go, then.”
“Oh,” Castiel says mildly, with some recognition, “the friend who’s starting a restaurant?”
“All you can eat, Sammy.”
“Hell, yes,” he chokes out, then, realizing what he's said, adds, “wait, I mean, no!” He slides out of the demon’s grip to one side, taking a step back as he tries to get his bearings through the haze in his vision. The demon’s scent is intoxicating—like a cool breeze after a storm. Is he
Castiel knew he was not a conversationalist. His skills in that department were undeniably rusty—his studies at Oxford had kept him so busy he’d had little time for the social scene in the university town, and apart from one or two close friends he missed dearly, he wasn’t well-connected. What Balthazar had seen in him as his successor, Castiel had little idea. But he knew that if he was to make something of this place, he needed to attempt to be welcoming, to retain an amiable air, which was not something that came naturally to him, especially when his mounting anxiety was making him want to shut the doors right away.
look Dean had ever seen.
Castiel feels like every nerve is sparking, like he could fly, given the chance. He lifts his hand and moves Dean's hand from his face to place it on Benny's chest. With Dean's help he has a lot more control, giving Benny just enough of their energy for the big man to gasp in a bigger breath and open his eyes. Castiel draws back and takes a deep breath himself, trying to calm his racing heart.
Naomi sighed, then spoke a little softer. “It's his birthday, Castiel. Just go and make yourself seen.”
Castiel had Dean’s heart, even if he didn’t know it.
“It is that hard. There’s simply too much of it,” the nurse says, eyes traveling from Bobby to Ellen to Dorthy to Dean. “To borrow your metaphor, imagine the tire has too much air in it. Eventually it’ll just…”
Gabriel hurried to keep up, his fins flared in surprise. “Oh wow, we
A cool breeze is blowing up the valley, making the hair on the back of Dean's neck stand on end. There are clouds on the horizon—dark, heavy clouds, the first he's seen for weeks that haven't been tiny wisps. A flash of lightning catches his eye. He can't tell if the storm is coming towards them—even if the breeze is blowing this way, that doesn't mean the clouds are.
“Tell me!” Winchester growled, allowing the knife to touch the man’s throat again.
He stands up, pulling Castiel to his feet, and leads him away towards the bathroom.
“Freaking finally!”
Not a dream, then.
There was a skitter of claws as Riot bounded over from his water bowl, jumping up at Sam’s legs with excitement.
"Goodnight, Gandalf!" Charlie calls with a wide smile, then they turn to trudge down the snowy path to the other cabin.
“He’s responsive!” someone shouts, and he groans, feeling stiff and achy in all the worst places. And, he realizes with some embarrassment, he has a very obvious erection too.
The news anchor appears. "Meanwhile, renowned Thaumaturgical expert and Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson has released a statement on what may have happened to the Well.”
“I—yes, yes, it is,” Castiel answered. He looked a little flushed, Dean noted; it must be very hot in the kitchen, baking at this time of year. “Thanks to you both, and your book club friends.”
Castiel shrugs a little, a smile reflecting the warmth in his chest. “It’s nothing.”
The water rushed back out again, the ocean gathering herself for the next wave. Castiel stumbled forward, losing his footing as the sand shifted under him. He cursed his legs loudly—why had he ever dreamed of being a human? Giving up on them entirely, he dove forward into the next breaking wave, trying once again to call out to his father under the surface.
But before he could put the pants away again, Cas turned, taking them from Dean and putting them on the bed. He pulled the skirt down over his hips before Dean caught on and hightailed out of there, leaving him to it.
As Charlie rapid-fires her questions and Cas tries to deny everything, he notices Dean get up and saunter out of the room, tail high.
As they entered the office, they saw Bobby standing behind his desk, watching their exchange with a dry look on his face, one eyebrow raised. He cleared his throat, shuffling papers in his hands on the top of his desk. “Milton, Winchester,” he said gruffly. “Sit down, would you? I don’t have all day.” He rang a bell on the wall behind his desk, and when one of the footmen appeared at the door, Bobby said, “Bring tea, please.”
Castiel stomped upstairs to his apartment, recently his late brother's. They'd all been shocked by his death at only thirty-eight—Castiel called back from the Peninsula with no notice, thrust into this lordly position with no training.
“Well, that’s bullshit in my book,” he says, the passion in his words making his voice quiver. “I got a buddy just like you, and he’s one of the best casters I know. I’m proud as hell to be his friend.”
And poor Anna! Having one of her own party guests murdered had rather put a stop to the rest of the gathering, and they’d all hurried to call their carriages after consoling one another with extra glasses of punch, while Castiel hurried out to join Dean in their carriage.
Castiel exchanged a small bow with the taller Mr Winchester, who had a polite smile on his face and stood slightly hunched, in the way very tall people tended to.
come back—they both had—and if they hadn't there was a good chance Cas wouldn’t still be here now.
a student anymore. Well, except in one glaring, super exasperating, frustrating way.
Sam 7:10 PM <<
Cas catches Dean giving him a side-eye. He clears his throat and says, "He doesn't seem to agree with that."
He slumps onto the couch, head in his hands. What has he done?
Dean pauses as they reach the door to the bathrooms, turning to Cas with a scowl. "Out here?"
Managing a weak, wobbly smile, Dean nodded. “I know, I know…” he murmured, watching the seas in Castiel’s eyes spill over and flood his cheeks.
That makes Castiel’s gaze snap up, a question in his eyes. “Really?”
“He’s just over there, talking to Missouri,” Dean says, nodding in Bobby’s direction. “But you shouldn’t be talking shop tonight, Cas. Can’t it wait till next week?”
The gloves and machete had been easy enough to find in Cas’ huge shed. He’d tried to play down his curiosity about the rows of jars on a shelf or the many boxes that were stacked up in here—they didn’t seem like farm goods, but he didn’t want to pry into Cas’ life, as much as he might be crushing on the guy.
Dean grinned, then was surprised at Ketch’s exclamation, “Castiel! Come here, lad.” He pulled Castiel in from where he stood a few steps behind Dean. “Are you acquainted with Lord Winchester, here? One of our youngest lords, but arguably the best company, eh, Dean?” Ketch said with an exaggerated wink.
“Cas, god,
He raises one eyebrow, and Dean ducks his head, looking intently back at his screen, but his foot still rests alongside Castiel’s.
“There's not just fish at the new place, y'know,” Benny said to Andrea as he put his beer down.
“And you were in this part of the house, because…?” Meg asked, stalking closer to him, her neckline perilously low.
Dean grabs Cas’ face and kisses him more frantically, as what feels like fire races along his skin. He pulls Cas’ t-shirt up and runs his hands along the warm skin underneath, loving the way Cas arches his back as Dean runs his fingers around his sides. Dean can definitely feel Cas hard in his jeans now, and the thought that he can make this strong, gorgeous man react in this way ignites him in a way nothing has for months—years, even.
“Anna,” Castiel says, swallowing dryly. “What are you doing here?”
“Super. Would you excuse us? I just need to speak with Castiel, here.” Gabriel grabbed his arm, pulling him aside.
with us! Uncle Sam’s in Ca-fornia so it’ll be all quiet, right, Dad?”
“Sam and Dean are the key to all this—let me take them and I can make everything better. Trust me,” Azazel says, the smile on his face looking oddly friendly considering the death surrounding him. “It’s a nice farm you’ve got here. Wouldn’t want to see anything happen to it.”
Castiel’s heart gave a painful lurch. He said nothing.
Ellen’s sympathetic gaze didn’t help his mood. He didn’t want people’s pity—that only made everything worse. She shook her head lightly, saying, “Don’t you pay him mind, d'you hear? You’ll be right as rain and back out there in no time, you’ll see.”
Dean nods unhappily. It seems that any control he might have been feeling over his life is still slipping through his fingers like smoke. He has no choice but to follow the path laid out before him—to follow in his father’s footsteps—the very path he’s been trying to avoid for the last few years.
One last boost onto a large, flat rock affords them a sweeping view above the level of the scraggly treetops. Dean pushes himself up to standing, as Sam slumps on the rock, trying to regain his breath.
Could he really do that? Let his little brother go off alone into the unknown? Stay here in this paradise with a man he had only met a few days ago but who has stolen his heart?
“Get outta here,” he finally says nonchalantly, holding his palm up as the chalk floats into his hand. “Have a good weekend, make good choices, blah blah…”
Strong arms grab him from behind, and he gasps as a large elbow hooks around his throat.
Dean gets antsy and walks back into the kitchen, Castiel raising an eyebrow at his apparent nerves. He tries to block all the sounds out, not to feel super exposed in this moment, but it’s embarrassing as hell to hear himself be this vulnerable. There’s a reason reality TV stars sound so stupid, he thinks, officially feeling cranky.
Sam shrugs one of his huge moose-shoulders. “We could’ve used his help setting up this warding.”
“Nothing, I swear!” Dean says, not daring to drag his eyes away to even glance at Sam. “We're just passing through. Looked like the place was abandoned.”
The boat had nets trailing behind—it must be a fishing boat. The merfolk used grass-woven nets now and then in certain schooling seasons, but he wondered how the concept would work from above the surface.
Nothing he’s dreamed so far could prepare him for the actual real sensation of having Dean suck his cock. He somehow manages to get just the right pressure on his head, while pumping the base with his hand. Castiel already feels the heat pooling in his core as he gasps out Dean’s name again.
A dream with achingly perfect outcomes, and intimate relationships, and lifelong friendships—the details of which are evaporating quickly into Dean’s subconscious. He wants to hold on to all the specifics, wants to clutch them to his chest, but a wiser part of him knows it’s not good to know these things ahead of time.
Dean walks home in a daze, head swimming, analyzing everything that’s transpired today—getting past the Seal, kissing Cas and enjoying it way more than he should, realizing the cameras had caught the whole damn thing… What the hell are they gonna do now? Can they alter the footage without anyone noticing?
Anna exhales, turning on her heels. Evidently she wasted her energy casting this spell, then stood in the rain for ten minutes, for absolutely nothing. She hasn’t worked this hard and lived a life this dangerous to let men talk down to her.
Dean knew that Benny was teasing him, but he knew what he'd seen. That merman was out there, and he’d keep heading out to the far fishery until he caught another glimpse. The sight had been replaying itself in his head all day.
But Dean’s eyes fell to the stem of gardenias atop the ugly coverlet. He wasn’t
"Wait, don't you want to try the spell?" he asks, gasping.
"Yes sir," Dean squeaks. "I'm with the queen.”
Dean checks his watch as he and Castiel help each other to their feet. A combination of exhaustion and a little too much alcohol makes Castiel's head spin slightly, but he totters over to the window in time to see a bright blue explosion burst over the lake, the pattern reflected in the still surface.
Dean nods, smiling at them, and Cas wipes Claire's face with a tissue before transferring the warm, sleepy bundle into Dean's arms. Cas murmurs his thanks as he leaves the room, and as Dean starts to walk across the small room, admiring the star patterns shining on the ceiling from a night light on the dresser, Claire coughs a few more times before she snuggles in to get comfortable.
“What? Hell, no. Being a cat is awesome, man! I got into fights, met a bunch of ladies, plenty of people are willing to feed stray cats. I was fine.” Dean's flippancy is still annoying, but Cas has a feeling those five years may have been long and lonely.
When he spotted him, Castiel was sitting on a stone bench at one end of the rose garden, backed into an arched nook with slightly overgrown foliage. He leaned forward, his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees, and he didn’t look up as Dean approached.
It seems the ritual has worked after all, and the levels of magic are balancing out. That son of a bitch did it.
Then a sickening crunch.
“The, imagining-how-you’re-going-to-seal-the-deal-with-this-latest-conquest look.” Dean just squints his eyes—his brother had been talking too damn fast for any of that to make a shred of sense—and Sam rolls his eyes. “I’m saying you have a crush.”
Cas lifted his head, pushing his dripping bangs out of his vision, and looked at Dean.
“Heeey bitch! You haven’t been in yet? Are they running late?” his friend demands. Must be her turn soon since she’s so amped up—Dean can feel the magic zipping anxiously around her, snapping between them where she’s clutching at his shoulder.
“Sure,” he mutters, hands fidgeting in front of him. “I gotta head out soon, though…”
“Thank god,” the Captain sighs, a hand on her chest. Anael is perched on her knees, a hand on Dean’s forehead.
“Wait,” Meg interrupted, looking towards the laundry door. “We need to go. Dean, stay until the end of the ball. You can have your heart to heart then, yes?” She held out Cas’ tailcoat, and he scrambled to his feet, still holding Dean’s hand as he gazed down for another moment before he shrugged into the coat.
The girl snarls as her companion falls, and she steps over him and lunges towards Dean, knife extended. Gritting his teeth, he fires, stopping her in her tracks with a bullet between her eyes.
“Seriously, I had my teacher face on and everything! Didn’t matter. Those assholes kept on pulling water out of the air to throw at each other.”
He knows he’s pushing his luck, that Sammy is basically a grown man and can dive into the party scene with Ruby if that’s what he really wants. But he’s been taking care of his little brother since he was fifteen, when their dad had essentially drunk himself into an early grave. Even after Bobby took them in as an unofficial uncle, Sam had always been Dean’s responsibility as far as he’s concerned. That’s not gonna change just ‘cause some brunette bats her eyelashes and binge-drinks on the weekends. Still, a beat of awkward silence passes between them, but eventually they approach safer topics, like whether or not Dr. Barnes is the hottest person in the room whenever she puts on low-rise jeans (the answer—yes). Thanks to that distraction, they manage to postpone their imminent argument about Sam’s new “friendship” with Ruby. At least for another day.
“I can buy you a little time to get started,” she’d said, smiling in a way that did absolutely nothing to ease Dean’s mind.
Dean glanced over at Cas again. Jack had also been taking the isolation hard. It had only been a couple of weeks after he’d got his soul back, and Jack had been raring to get back out in the world to experience it again, only to have everything shut down, and to be ordered to stay inside. He also had wanted to get out to help people, and Dean had been trying to remind him that they could spread the virus around just by touching infected things, which had freaked the poor kid out a little. Plus, he still wasn’t allowed to use his grace.
“I’ll ask Crowley,” Castiel says. He’s not sure if Crowley will be interested in letting Sam near his library, but it’s worth a try.
As he reaches the parking lot, he stops in front of his pride and joy to run a hand over her hood. “I fucked up, baby,” he whispers, then turns to look back towards the school building. Castiel is standing close behind him once again, watching him expectantly.
There’s a gasp from behind them, and when Castiel turns back to look at Anna, she, Anael, and Crowley are looking at their hands, flexing their fingers. Anna’s face is a mask of surprise and wonder, and Castiel smiles to see her finally come into the elemental power she should have had all along. She deserves this, more than any of them.
Dean gives a wry chuckle, rubbing circles gently into Castiel’s back. “Never mind, I’ll tell you about it later. Let’s get you home.”
“Stop, stop,” Dean gasps out. “Are you sure you want this?”
“Dean needed to collect some spell reagents for his uncle, so we went to the beach.” Castiel grins as she squeals again.
“No chance. I’m staying,” Dean says, and the sentiment is echoed from around the group.
"Like I said, that’s your business, no one else’s. But listen, that’s not the only thing I’ve had hunches about. Something dark is coming, Castiel. Dark dealings, a betrayal—perhaps more than one. Make sure you watch your back."
They reach a junction, and Dean scratches an arrow in the dirt again to indicate continuing straight ahead.
But he resolved to put the note from his mind now. Replacing the folded notepaper into the pocket inside his coat, he walked down the gravel drive towards the house.
As Dean comes back to himself, he feels Cas slip out with an uncomfortable sensation, then he slumps over onto Cas’ bed, boneless. A few moments later Cas lies down against Dean’s back, stroking a hand down Dean’s side. He plants a kiss on Dean’s ear, and Dean turns to look at him. “That was, uh…unexpected,” he says.
Castiel smiles. He can talk about Oxford all day—he misses life there now and then, although this time of year was usually the most stressful. He thinks back to his first impressions of the place. "It's a city in Oxfordshire. Beautiful old buildings. Big university. Students everywhere.”
At first, he’d assumed the ritual hadn’t worked, that they’d pulled too much energy and Cas had either been blasted back to his own realm, or into nothingness. Dean had been devastated to realize that he would probably never know.
Castiel 3:25 PM <<
Dean began, his small, neat handwriting slanting slightly uphill as he braced the letter against his thigh.
“I think we have all we need here, then,” Castiel said, heading towards the door. He turned back to see Winchester and his brother having some kind of glared conversation behind him. “Is that not the way forward, Winchester?”
If all went well tomorrow, if they made it through midsummer unscathed, he decided, then he'd make his declarations to Dean and they'd find a way to be together, propriety be damned.
Reluctantly they begin the spell, succinct and in unison, a little bit weaker than they were last time. The spell is manifested in front of them and glowing evanescently. Dean hates the sensation of someone else’s magic funneling itself through his body, especially someone as messed up as Crowley. He can’t pinpoint the emotions there, not like he can with Cas, but there’s a general feeling of disconcertment and uneasiness deep within his skin. He wonders if this sensation is what lay magic addicts feel when they’re going through withdrawals—like they could literally rip their own veins out and be better off for it.
It’s Christmas and he’s in love.
He knows there are extensive collections of other texts in the vaults under the library as well, many of which are hundreds of years old. But the main level holds all of the currently studied magical texts, and it's towards these that he now heads, wondering what on earth is making that awful noise. There’s a buzzing in the air, too—an almost greasy feeling that’s caused by a major expenditure of elemental magic in an enclosed space, and it’s getting thicker the closer he gets to the back of the library. His curiosity climbs to new heights as he rounds the final stack and takes in the scene before him.
, and had left Castiel wondering once again who this mysterious correspondent could be. They certainly knew more about the book than he did—he would have to study it again before formulating his next missive.
Dean 5:20 PM <<
Castiel walks off before they've moved, his irritation prickling all over his skin. Why is everyone getting some action around here except for him? It’s incredibly frustrating.
“All four of my classes this semester have ‘101’ or ‘introduction to’ in the title. The only reason I was given a third-year thesis candidate to advise is because, I’m told, you waited too late to fill out the paperwork with the registrar's office.” Castiel lifts an eyebrow in Dean’s direction, contempt evident on his face. “Is that a habit of yours, Dean? Being late?”
As they fold the ends together, Castiel asks, "Where's the pie?"
Dean follows, unsure what to expect outside. The sun is only just up over the hill, but the sky is bright and blue. In front of the door lies the mud-pit that was once the vegetable garden, a deep hole partially filled with water. The rest of the battlefield is covered here and there with bodies, or pieces of bodies. The rain has washed away most of the blood, and there doesn’t seem to be a smell to it, at least, not yet. But Cas and Dean only stare around in horror for a few moments before Cas turns back around away from the carnage, a hand over his mouth.
"Why didn't you say so before, ya idjit!"
Dean cleared his throat cautiously, wincing as he did so. “The demon referred to a ‘she’. That cuts our suspects down significantly, does it not?”
The two men are chatting indistinctly, peering together in concentration, and Dean overhears how they don’t know how to set the timer on his oven. Good—hopefully that’ll distract them long enough for him to grab some clothes and make his escape. But when he takes a single step, his creaky hardwood floors give him away, and both men spin around curiously.
Castiel nods. “The gifted students, yes. They take an aptitude test when they’re eleven, and gifted students are put into extracurricular classes, you know, AV clubs and music groups—but they’re really fronts for secret magical training.” He fake-whispers the last sentence dramatically, and Dean laughs.
Castiel sighed as his eyes fell to the paper on the table. The letter to the editor took up half a column. It may have been sent anonymously, but Castiel was almost certain who the sender, or
Cas’ hair is still slightly damp from the rain, the outside of his trench coat wet, but when Dean slips a hand and grabs him by the back of his belt, he’s surprised by how cool and dry the leather is. Then—without breaking the hold he currently has on Cas’ bottom lip, sucking and nipping in a tantalizing way that he’s fairly certainly is turning Cas on—he snakes a hand inside Cas’ pants, intending to untuck his button-up shirt and feel
“Yes, of course, always do when I think about you,” Castiel gushes, as if him jerking off while thinking about Dean should be common knowledge by now. Jesus. That, coupled with the sheer
He nods his head and grunts, not dignifying Crowley with a response, and they follow him out the nearest exit. Charlie is biting her lip and sending Dean worried glances, but he tries to send her back a reassuring smile—he’ll get her out of this. He’ll find Sam. Cas'll come and back him up. Anna and her coven will help them take control of the situation. Everything will be fine.
Dean shushed him, guiding him across to the other side of the street with sooty hands, sitting them both down on one of the road’s horse mounting blocks to wait for the physician. They were both covered in streaks of black, a little singed around the edges, but they were safe.
Dean huffs, then looks back at his phone. "Going out with A tomorrow afternoon. You in?"
“Missouri was taking all this home to her husband? Lucky him!”
Castiel stood still, unsure what Dean wanted him to do. He’d put some sweet-smelling stuff into the water as it was filling up, making the foam that was now floating on the surface. The bath was large enough to fit a person in it, and as Dean pointed to him and then mimed jumping into the bath, he realized that this must be the human version of the merfolk’s remora beds—a way to clean their bodies. Castiel’s hands went to the edges of his coat to remove it, but Dean’s eyes widened and he jumped forwards, holding out his hands to stop him, just shy of actually touching him. He grimaced, muttering something, then he almost ran out of the room, closing a wooden door behind him.
"Here he is," Dean says, unbuckling his seatbelt. "He's way further in than usual."
Bobby snorted. “I’ve got more than enough flighty girls to handle looking after the women’s division of the Letters,” he said. “And a few of the men, too, for that matter.”
Campbell took a sip of tea, then replaced his cup on its saucer and took a biscuit from the plate before he spoke again. “Novak, I really do not care what you do with this place. With the books, the tea, any of it.” He looked up, and Castiel tried to keep his face carefully neutral. This was not the way he had expected this conversation to go.
Anael stops beside a familiar dumpster, and it occurs to Dean way too slowly that they’re standing in front of an entrance. One he’s seen before.
“Your palms should be hovering near each other’s, but not touching,” Dean reminds them. “Go to third position, then fourth, then first.”
“Thanks Cassie, you’re the best.”
He’d found the whole fictional library concept fascinating himself, when his uncle had explained it. Sometimes the notes were coded messages between secret lovers, sometimes a journal of their day, or secret, anonymous confessions of deeds best left in the dark.
“Looking for you,” Dean snaps, and goes back to staring out the window.
Castiel took a step toward Dean, but then seemed to catch himself, stopping short. “They all look the same?” he asked, his voice tight.
“Yes. Although I don't know if it will work. It's never been cast before, but in theory everything is correct…”
Dean hummed in agreement. “It’d be an improvement from dodging them at the Assembly Rooms, at least, if I can step away and hide in my own house.”
Dean flinches away. “No! No, it’s okay. Healing magic is...tricky. It’s real easy to take a body apart, but putting one back together? You need to learn how to do it.”
Finally, the guests began to leave, and Dean joined Sam and Eileen as they lined up to bid the couple of honor their farewell. They all bowed as Sam, Eileen and Dean reached the front of the line, Sam thanking Cas for a pleasant evening.
Dean stood on the beach at the water’s edge, the fond smile on his face more sunny than a summer’s day.
Castiel begins walking along the path beside the pond, along the top edge of the vegetable garden, Dean following along behind. “There’s not much to know. I grow vegetables most of the year. The fruit from the orchard won’t ripen for a month or so, but when it does I’ll have rotten apples everywhere.”
The taste of that gooey, sweet pie, as Dean had named it, had been like a flavor explosion on his tongue—nothing in any feast held in Atlantica tasted anything like that.
Castiel gazes up at him, entirely distracted once again by the freckles dusting Dean’s cheeks. "Well, what?"
Dean couldn’t help but hope, even if doing so meant ignoring the wife-shaped specter in the corner.
In the misty, yellowed light of the gas lantern that swung overhead, Dean found himself struggling not to let his eyes rest on the lord entirely too long, particularly as they were currently in public. Castiel, it seemed, felt the cold more acutely than Dean did—likely a holdover from the warmth of Spain, Dean assumed. When they were called out like this, to rotting bodies found dotted all over London, Castiel wrapped up well, and Dean found it damnably distracting. With a chunky, navy blue scarf wrapped around his throat more times than Dean could count, Castiel spent every moment that he wasn’t freeing his mouth to speak with his shoulders hunched up, bunching the scarf up around his ears until it almost touched the brim of his hat. Only his startlingly blue eyes and a little of his flushed, ruddy cheeks poked out above the woolen loops, and Dean would admit—to himself—that he found the sight strangely enchanting.
He wondered why it was that Michael had been content with lodging here, rather than renting his own house in London. The Men of Letters' apartments were comfortable enough, but with only one footman shared between several people, it was hardly befitting his rank. Admittedly, Castiel rarely wore fashionable enough clothes to require aid with dressing. At least until now.
“Morning, Mrs Harvelle,” Dean called as he slipped into the warm room, shutting the door behind him. “I assume you’re hiding Sam somewhere in here.”
We'd love you to leave a comment and tell us your thoughts, and don't forget to subscribe for next week's update.
Cas just smiles fondly, and pulls Dean’s hand to follow Sam out of the bunker.
“Study? Was she not doing so in Paris?” Dean turned to pick up his drink once more, sipping at it as Castiel continued.
Dean fights back a wince. Fuck, is that really how he worded it?
“Wow, looks like I’m way behind,” Sam mumbles. “Between punching my roommate and hooking up with Doctor Novak, how do you even have time to write your thesis?”
“In a way,” Castiel says noncommittally, and Dean picks up on the vibe that he doesn’t want to discuss it further, so they just stare into the dark water of the basin in companionable silence.
Cas tilts his head, putting his coffee cup down on its saucer. “What do you mean? Where would you go?”
“Uh, wow…” Dean’s voice is hoarse, his lips still wet where Cas last kissed him. He feels something inside his heart begin to warm, the walls he’s built around his emotions crumbling. “Cas, you cheater. That was like, six compliments in one!”
Dean blinked at him, then chuckled. “Keep your voice down, man. This is his club, after all!”
If his looks were unexpected, his voice was astounding. Dean cleared his throat, shaking away some genuinely ungentleman-like thoughts, and reminding himself who this spoiled little rich boy actually was. “Milton,” he responded, not deigning to shake the hand that was offered, or use the title that he should. “I’m afraid you’re going to have to get your hands dirty. I do hope that’s not too upsetting for you, m’lord. You could always go back to bed, if this is a little much.”
Dean turns to look at him and is lost again in the blue of his eyes, strikingly bright in the sunshine. "'M Dean" is all he can manage.
Castiel glared at his brother. “Are you going to tell Dad?”
Yep, they still won’t admit it, but they’re in love.
Another broken cry fell from Castiel's lips as he leaned forward, dipping his own fingers in the oil to slick himself up, before he grabbed Dean's hip firmly and lined himself up with his other hand. Pushing forward as slowly as he could, he gasped again at Dean's tight heat as he engulfed him. Dean suddenly pushed backwards, pulling a gasp out of both of them, before Castiel growled, grabbing both of Dean's hips firmly. He pulled out, then pushed back in in one fluid movement, and Dean exhaled sharply.
“Oh, you betcha,” she nodded firmly. “And when we left him a few minutes ago, he was the most lively any of ‘em have been.”
“Tell me if this is too much," Dean says, moving on to the button of Castiel’s jeans.
Castiel just stares at him, head tilted slightly up and beaming, as if Dean just said his eyes had won the Nobel Peace Prize. Fuck, that stare… Just like that, Dean can barely breathe, lost in that incredible gaze. It feels like every moment between them lately—even ones that begin fun or flirty—delve into romantic territory way more quickly than Dean expects. He can’t risk blurting out how insanely into Cas he is, not without scaring his brand-new boyfriend away on their very first day of dating. So chuckles uncomfortably, trying to diffuse the moment. “Weirdo. Don’t look at me like that.”
Dean nods. “Uh huh.”
Castiel's eyes widened. “You intend to avoid the match.”
“One? ’M just on m’way home.”
Castiel feels himself flushing scarlet, and wonders if it’s possible to die of embarrassment. “Missouri, I’m sorry, it—”
“What?” They’ve talked about this before, after he’d first admitted his attraction to Dean after the phone sex incident. Meg had been nothing but supportive ever since, and Castiel is grateful for it. “No, I told you, that doesn’t matter.” It isn’t strictly true—he’s nervous as hell. But it isn’t the guy thing he’s worried about. It’s the chance that he’s imagining the whole thing, and their friendship could be destroyed, maybe even their affinity. Dean’s thesis project could be at risk, and he doesn’t want to be responsible for that.
Bobby’s gaze turns to Cas, his eyes hard. “Come eat. You’ll need your strength. I made a pot roast." He leaves again, following the others down the hall before Cas can reply.
Under his own shirt, Dean’s corset had been only hastily re-tied, so he deposited that easily with his other clothes, glad that he'd thought to wipe himself off thoroughly and his skin wasn't a crusted mess. When they were both down to their trousers, Dean chuckled.
Castiel is taken aback for a moment. The people who have ever said they read his work…well, he can count them on one hand. He gives what he hopes looks like a pleased smile to Crowley, and replies, “Thank you. I'll admit, I've also followed quite a few of your cases. I found the one—maybe your most recent one?—where the lay magician was fighting for her inheritance? It was fascinating.”
But the Sea Witch didn’t answer. The ocean water remained powerful, but no magic came to transform him back.
The flames would be out soon, though. Balthazar and his rag-tag defenders were still halfway across the ballroom, waving their torches at the remaining demons. Castiel wouldn’t be able to secure more holy oil in time.
Anna stands up, her expression carefully concealed. She has no clue who this is and what connection he might have to Crowley and the Seal, but she refuses to admit this aloud. “I wouldn’t tell you if it did.”
Beside her, Rachel nodded her agreement with a look that Castiel might call adorably fierce if he hadn't already felt her biting comments.
Castiel nods. “I think we’ve got the advantage here. Crowley may have the
Was he really offering…? Dean smiled, thanking all the gods for Bobby and his uncanny ability to know just what he needed. “Thanks, Bobby. I appreciate it.”
. He doesn’t have a crush anymore. He’s over Castiel. Yep.
Balthazar’s voice dulled into the background as Dean turned their conversation over in his mind. Yes, the dancing would be wonderful—but Becky Rosen. She had insisted that this was the place to be, at midsummer specifically?
out, fools. All of us!”
He grabs leftover pizza from the fridge and heads back to the living room, settling in front of the TV and opening his laptop to do a little work.
"Hello? Castiel?" he calls, walking across the room and stopping for a moment to sink his toes into a plush rug lying on the floor in front of the couch. The interior of the house is completely silent, save for a ticking sound Dean identifies as a large clock, hanging on the wall above the fireplace. Does Castiel live here all alone after all? The living area looks as tidy as a magazine, everything in its place.
“Dean,” Sam says gratefully, “Cas…”
He shakes his head. His memories are dim of that time, but what came after is still painfully fresh. Thank God Uncle Bobby stepped in when he did, got John to rehab. “He was a mess for a long time, but he’s kind of better now. Sam and I have put ourselves through school—he’s at a big university in California, now. But Dad’s still always wanted me to work for the Grove.”
Dean knows he means taking him on as an eleventh-hour thesis student, so really, it’s sorta an insult…but he’s a pervert, and he can’t help but think that Castiel is
he thinks but doesn’t say. He knows it would be a rash decision, but fuck it, he’s never fit into the academic mold to begin with. This whole mess with Dr. Novak all but confirms it.
He tips the bones into the bowl with a melodic clatter, and adds some dried thyme. The rest will have to wait until it's time to cast, so he gets to his feet and steps back out of the sigil to where Cas stands.
recorded on the DVR, and I tend to get testy when my schedule is disrupted.” The man’s accent is thick, British or maybe Scottish, and Dean narrows his eyes at him.
“Samuel,” Dean chastised. “We’re right here, no need to deafen us.”
But he had to. He had no choice—the memory of those who had fallen foul of Crowley’s deals surfaced, those unfortunate souls trapped forever on the sea floor. He had to go through with the deal.
They share the slices out, each one a different flavor. Castiel tries his hardest not to look at Dean licking caramel off his fingers, and keeps his knees up to hide any bulge between his legs. Who knew eating anything could be so erotic?
His brother…? Castiel looks back at the young man—Sam. “Very well,” he says to Charlie, then walks over to where Sam still stands, hunched at an awkward angle. As a professor, even an adjunct, he’s been given the clearance to unbind this warding. He hasn’t imagined ever having to actually use the privilege, but there’s starting to be a lot about doing this job he hasn’t expected to ever actually do.
“Uh, anyways…” Dean takes a cautious sip from his mug, smacking his lips together. He turns back to Castiel, ignoring the daggers Charlie is shooting him. “How was the rest of your weekend?”
Cas sits on his bottom, ankles crossed comfortably, and Dean folds into the same position. He scoots over some, so he’s beside Cas instead of across from him, and their kneecaps touch. Dean can feel Cas’ proximity like an extension of his own body, and when Castiel reaches over with his uncut hand, Dean opens his palm willingly. Their hands cup each other and Dean can feel the undercurrent of their magic entwining, flowing between each other like a two-lane highway. Castiel begins to chant and Dean closes his eyes, focusing on the husky sound of Cas’ voice, the feeling of their hands clasped together. At some point their fingers end up threaded, and Dean isn’t sure if he initiates it or Cas does, but they’re holding hands properly now. Dean strokes his thumb over Cas’ skin in an intimate gesture and the professor seems to lean into the touch, their shoulders brushing. Dean’s heart is racing again, an occurrence that seems typical when Cas is nearby. He’s not sure he’s ever felt this connected to anyone. It’s pure power, pure joy, an exuberance that feels like flying.
Castiel tilts his head, curious. “You weren’t?”
Hands grip Castiel’s shoulders from behind and he’s pulled back, away from Dean. "No—" he begins, horrified. He can’t let them separate him and Dean now—not after everything they’ve just been through—not now that he knows what’s in Dean’s hopes, his dreams. He struggles against the hold, but when he tries to draw the elements to him, they’re distant, faint even. What have they done?
“Oh, don’t worry about Sam,” Crowley says, with a casual wave of his hand.
“Church can wait. Let’s get you upstairs to bed,” Dean said firmly, and Castiel was glad he sounded a little less upset with him this time.
Castiel glares at him with open lust before turning slowly, walking stiffly back into the living room. Dean smiles smugly to himself as he continues to put away the leftovers.
“I told you, I was recruited by Rosco. I had never met Crowley until three days ago,” Sam insists, hands moving animatedly as he speaks. “Listen, if you and Cas can keep a secret like this from each other—and still be attached at the hip—then isn’t it possible that Crowley and Rosco kept us apart that whole time, too?”
Dean shifted, groaning, then coughed when he found his throat was full of salt. He was lying on his back on a soft surface, but he shivered as cold water washed over his legs and around him. Cracking open an eye hurt like hell, but the early morning sky stretched overhead, clear and cornflower blue.
Dean finished tying the laces at the neckline of his shirt, then turned back to Cas, surveying his expression in the rapidly lightening room. “What is it?” he asked, sitting back down on the bed and resting his hand on the other side of Castiel’s legs.
Dean tried not to let horror show on his face. This wasn't Sam—his brother would never say such things.
, Dean silently assures him, which makes Castiel smile. He’s grateful Dean is here with him, even as he wishes he was far away and safe.
He could not be wrong about this, could he? The looks they exchanged, the way Dean flushed up the back of his neck when he spoke to Castiel sometimes...Dean was feeling it, too—he had to be. Dean’s smile emboldened him. He had to know whether his regard was returned.
Dean tried to bite back the smirk that he could feel tugging at his lips, but he wasn’t sure how good a job he did of it. What a funny man Novak was, sometimes. Charmingly so, unfortunately for Dean.
hundreds, perhaps more. All circling the building, looking for any way in, pressing against the glass.
Dean and Cas don’t say much as they eat. Dean enjoys the way the sweetness of the crunchy oats offsetting the tart blackberries. It might be a long time before he gets to eat such good food again. A weight that he didn’t know had been lifted from him from the last few days settles back into place on his shoulders. They’ll never be rid of Azazel. They’ll have to keep running forever.
“I’m on my way.”
“C’mon girl. Let’s get you some real exercise,” Dean cooed eagerly, guiding her off the packed dirt and putting grass beneath her feet. He gathered Baby’s reins slightly and pursed his lips, making a
It couldn’t be. Could it?
He's had meeting after meeting today, and even when he'd managed to avoid the stupid dress-up lunch for Halloween that Charlie had been so excited about, he hadn't been able to get much work done because both of his monitors had been on the fritz, randomly turning off and fuzzing out now and then.
Dean nodded, a warm look in his eyes where they carried the reflection of the fireflies surrounding them.
“I did,” said Castiel. “I was unaware of it all myself, until this week.”
She looks up at him, smiling. "You sure you don't want to come along? I have it on good authority that there'll be lots of eligible guys there?"
He’d slipped into an uneasy doze when a door opened nearby, spilling warm light over the ground near where Castiel sat. A person came out and set something heavy down outside the door, then gasped as they saw him sitting there.
This is it. Pass or fail, he’s got to make his choice.
The breath hitched in Cas’ throat. “Dean, I—” he began, but Dean leaned in before he second-guessed himself, and planted a kiss right on Cas’ surprised mouth.
“What have we here, my lord?” Meg breathed.
Inheritance and titles were a very big deal back during the Regency, and in almost all circumstances there was no way for a man to "marry into" a title, or a woman to retain much independence at all. When she married, she was owned by her husband, and he took possession of everything she had. If you're interested in more information on the methods of inheritance that Dean's title hunting makes use of, here's a PDF of a presentation on the topic from the Beau Monde Conference in '99:
Castiel and Miss Masters were forced to wait to escape to the fresh air, since the crowd immediately milled around the Queen as she took her place on a comfortable chair at the head of the room. She presided over the party, wishing the dancing to continue, so with a flurry of couples lining up, the dancing did exactly that.
“Please, come in, Dean.”
“It’s from their ship—the one that sank.” At Castiel’s incredulous look, he added, “What, you didn’t think you were the only one who could go sneaking off to the graveyard, did you?”
“I’m sorry, but that’s the best we can offer right now!” Ms. Holmes says, obviously rattled by Cas’ speech. “Thank you for bringing it to our attention, but please leave it with us, and go in peace.” She turns away, and Cas steps back again, his hands clenched into fists at his sides.
He lurches forward, trying to pull Dean forward so he can taste those gorgeous lips again, but instead Dean grabs his into an awkward hug. He speaks over Cas' head. "How long was he out for?"
Crowley throws back his drink, slamming the glass down on the bar for Inias to refill. "Now," he continues, "we've got a few stragglers from our group, but most of them have already been briefed. When the others arrive, just let me do the talking, all right? Our aim here is simple—find out what they know, and if the Coven will lend us their power. Everything else after that will be negotiating, and that's my area of expertise."
“No, of course not.” Cas says, indignant. “But...yes, I have been drawing as much as I can. It’s...it’s insurance, Dean.”
What if maybe, possibly, that’s already happening?
“And no qualms about clipping your ear, either,” Bobby pointed out, “no matter how monstrously tall you plan to grow.”
“Thank god you’re okay,” he mutters, squeezing Cas tighter.
“I can see that. He warmed you up, huh?” Charlie grins, voice heavy with suggestion, and Dean kicks her shin under the table until she mumbles a small “ouch!”
Dean.
Remorse rushes through Cas, and he steps forward to join Dean in the floodlight once again. It’s been a rough week for both of them. He puts his hand to Dean’s arm. “I’m sorry. At least we saved that guy, right?”
Dean's gaze flicks around the space, taking in Ruby, the door, finally lingering on Castiel. He turns a frustrated look back to Sam. "Really, Sam? Because from here it doesn't look like it."
True or not, Dean is uneasy and nervous, and he promptly went back to sleep after Cas left. By lunchtime Dean’s empty stomach demands attention, so he heats up a bowl of soup—the spelled variety that’s supposed to eliminate spring allergies. Dean spent the entire month of April sneezing, eyes rimmed red, but now that it’s May his congestion is finally clearing up. Which is lucky, really, because it would suck to sound all stuffed-up for his thesis defense.
He trailed off as they entered the cavern, far smaller than the home cavern of Atlantica, but roughly cylindrical and open to the water far above. Bright light filtered down from above, gently shining on each of Castiel’s collected treasures. This wasn’t the first time Gabriel had been here—when they were both sprats, they’d started this collection together, bringing the strange human objects they found and keeping them here so they could try to work out each item's purpose.
“It appears so, yes,” Castiel croaks, his voice husky. They’re sitting shoulder to shoulder in Dean’s bed, Cas’ eyes wide as he watches Dean closely. Dean’s cock is hard as a fucking rock, uncomfortable as hell considering he had gotten off in the dream but not in real life. Then again, he reasons, maybe the dream
“What?” Castiel asks, quirking one eyebrow. They’re standing so close that he can feel the heat radiating from Dean’s body, sense his magic simmering under his skin. His own magic calls out, but their spell is complete for now.
“I appreciate that you’re doing so, sir,” Castiel responded. His voice was deeper and Dean struggled to make out his rumbles. “But the amount is so much higher. Even with a week, to earn the extra will be—”
“Like ‘em?” Gabriel asks, smacking Dean hard enough on the shoulder for him to take a stumbling step forward.
—to find himself at Alchemy once again.
“Leaving.” He says it as if it’s the simplest thing in the world, and Dean’s gotta laugh at how ridiculous this whole thing’s become.
Dean looks at him, unamused. “
Cas leans back away from the screen and digs the heels of his hands into his eyes before scrutinizing the photo again. There’s no way--he’s just tired, he’s nervous, he’s going cross-eyed from editing photos,
Cas takes the package and walks over to Dean, who’s being congratulated by Anna. She notices him and takes a few steps back, tapping Dean on the shoulder.
Balthazar studies him for a few seconds, then waggles his eyebrows seductively, and Castiel’s eyes widen slightly as he follows Balthazar’s train of thought before averting his gaze.
Dean pauses. “You’re looking at that picture again, aren’t you?”
He rolls onto his stomach and presses his face into his pillow with a groan. It’s going to be a
to the fucking car?”
After giving up on his attempt at eating breakfast, Cas heads back to his tent, Lucifer’s words still ringing in his ears. He slides stiffly under his blanket and stares at the ceiling, trying to force himself to fall asleep for even just an hour or two, but his mind is running a mile a minute. He groans frustratedly and digs the heels of his hands into his eyes before letting his arms drop to his sides, pleading his mind to just leave him alone. He’s already the laughingstock of the entire goddamn station; the last thing he needs is sympathy for a fucking hostage, especially one as mouthy and dangerous and attrac--
“You think this would’ve happened if I could
“And?”
Dean makes introductions—his brother, Sam, and his girlfriend, Eileen; Ellen and Bobby’s daughter, Jo; a handful of friends who all already seem to be four drinks deep.
“Wallet,” he says, gesturing toward Cas’ pockets with his gun. “Now.”
A few others are scattered around the tent when Cas arrives, and he scans for any familiar faces before making a beeline toward Gabe, Raphael, and Balthazar. They’re not exactly friends to Cas, more like acquaintances if anything, but they all went through basic training together, and they’re part of the select few in the Station who aren’t constantly haranguing him about being more assertive and working on his shooting skills.
“Could you draw her?” Cas asks hesitantly, and by the way Dean shakes his head defeatedly, Cas can tell he’s tried.
Without waiting for a decision to be made, Dean hauls up what he can of their chains and looks expectantly at the two of them. “You thinkin’ what I’m thinkin’?”
“Thank you, Miss Moore. I’ve heard enough. In the case of the State of Kansas versus Winchesters and Novak, I find in favor of the defendants. Case closed. Winchesters, Novak—” Judge Turner says with a nod, “—you’re free to go.”
“Easy for you to say,” Alastair growls, “with that stupid rose on your stupid [bleeping] shirt already.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Oh, come on!”
Castiel whirls around to see a recycling bin overturned and Dean sprawled out across the street on his stomach, trash littered around him.
“Boy trouble.”
“I know,” Gabe says pleasantly, and starts walking.
The guy starts for a second, thrown off by Dean’s pose, but recovers quickly when Dean pivots back into the next set of steps. The guy takes his place in front of him and they roll their shoulders in opposite directions, turning their heads to maintain eye contact as they do so.
The text is a screenshot of another text message, this one from someone Dean has programmed into his phone as “Bitch.” It’s short, sweet, and makes Cas’ heart jump up to his throat.
Cas clears his throat. “I’d like to make it up to you,” he says. “Make up for lost time.”
“What's going on?”
,” Billie interrupts, and Hannah nods vigorously. “But two,” she continues, waving his concerns off, “we’ll fade to black, just for you, Novak.”
Cas just turns up the radio in response.
It’s early evening by the time they finally find a spot Sam deems good enough for them to set up camp at, and despite the fact that he’d spent the past six hours wishing he could just fucking
Cas keeps his hand on Dean’s until he needs to use it to wipe away more tears during “It’s Quiet Uptown.”
“Dean’s just annoyed he can’t convince anyone else to switch to his choice of pomade,” Sam pipes up with a smirk.
Cas shakes his head, tilting his head back to give Dean better access. “I could get one.”
There’s a chorus of shouts from outside the tent, and suddenly Michael and Lucifer burst inside, a struggling man between the two of them. They’re each gripping one of his arms tightly, and all the thrashing he’s doing reminds Cas of a wild horse. The man’s wrists are bound behind his back, and Cas can hear him yelling incoherently, tossing his head back and forth to try and shake loose the hood that had been thrown over his head. Station 1237’s lieutenant, Alistair, strides in behind them, and Cas automatically feels his back straighten at the sight of the lieutenant. He keeps his eyes averted, not wanting to call attention to himself, but Alistair is preoccupied by their new captive. He glares at the man who is still fighting against Michael and Lucifer, and delivers a quick punch to his stomach that makes Cas wince and the man cry out in pain.
“Lifesaver, baby,” he says, more to himself than anyone else as he turns the keys, hitting the dash this time when the engine roars to life. “Goddamn lifesaver!”
Dean spins on his heel and jabs a finger into Sam’s chest. “Where’s Cas?”
His brother’s good people. Always has been, always will be. Dean’s proud of him.

below industry standards, or the fact that he was working 60-hour weeks without overtime.
Dean wants to punch himself.
—kinky—something Dean normally wouldn’t be able to switch off fast enough.

that voice, the exact person (and voice, if he’s being totally honest) who’s been on his mind since not only the fucking trainwreck that was last night, but his first day here. He presses his lips together into a thin line before tapping the eraser on the board in subtle defeat and slowly turning around.
Cas nods. "For a fellow
see it, you’ll be able to get your very own one of these. Except I bet yours will be way cooler than mine. Yours’ll have a color and everything, and you’ll be the only one who’ll be able to use it.”
They’re both sitting on that stupid fake marble bench that’s too small for two grown men to share, and Cas is taking special care not to let his body touch Dean’s. Dean’s got other ideas, though, knocking their knees together with casual ease. He’s talking about something, but Cas can’t register anything other than the fact that Dean’s
Cas is lying on his back, holding his kitten Oliver’s small front paws in his hands. He makes his paws move around in uncoordinated little dance moves, and the kitten stares at him blankly, bored.
, exactly, but sure as hell not comfortable, either, as if he’s nervous to bother Dean, has him scrambling to do damage control and reassure Cas before he’s even said a word. “‘Course, man.”
“Have fun with your ridiculous stomach cramps, then,” Cas says simply. He finishes putting away the vegetables and straightens, glancing over his shoulder and seeing Dean’s face go pale at the mention of cramps. He’s sure it’s because Dean is thinking back to last week, when, despite Cas’ protests, he thought it’d be a good idea to have a few slices of meat lover’s pizza before one of their ten-mile runs, and Cas smirks at the memory. He closes the fridge door, and then notices one of the few photos secured to it.
Cas spends a few more minutes looking through the items in the folder: a financial aid form, housing papers, a list of important dates and deadlines, when he hears a soft knock on his door.
“Well, yeah, you just told me I was gonna get goddamn stomach cramps if I ate one of my favorite foods, so of course I’m gonna--”
Lin finishes the performance, wishes them all luck, and ducks back into the theatre, leaving the crew to begin the lottery. A tense silence washes over the crowd as they wait to hear the first name. Dean worries his lower lip and shoves his hands into his jacket pockets, trying--and probably failing--to stay casual.
Dean interrupts him with an awkward clap that Cas assumes is supposed to have landed on his shoulder, but ends up cuffing him in the back of the head instead. “Just take the compliment, dude.”
Some are stupid, some are concerned, and all are more than Cas wants to discuss, but no question is more unsettling than, “What's Alistair gonna do to him?” and the inevitable follow-up of, “D’you think I can help?”
“It helped you deal with your emotions?”
Dean rolls his eyes as they pull into one of the last empty spots in the lot. “Maybe next time.” Throwing the Impala in park, he scoops up his book, brushing his lips against Cas’ jaw in a quick kiss along the way. “Gotta hurry before all the good reading spots are gone, nerd.”
Suddenly, Dean’s words are interchangeable with his father’s, Cas finds himself staring into his father’s cold blue eyes while looking at Dean, and before he can think any more about it, Castiel snaps. He grips a fistful of Dean’s hair and jerks his head upright, staring into his wide green eyes.
“Gimme that,” Sam says instead, and before Dean can do anything about it, Sam’s fucking bear hands swoop in out of nowhere and grab the phone. Dean blinks, then waves him away dismissively.
Eventually, Cas perfects the art of sneaking down to the crew quarters. He figures out the best times to dodge as many people as possible in the hall, commits Dean’s—and Benny’s, can’t be too careful—schedule to memory, and finally starts to get comfortable carrying his fake ID with him.
Although it’s currently milling with people, Cas is able to zero in on several different places where he could picture himself relaxing later, small nooks in the campus where he can hide away for a bit and do nothing but read, listen to music, or just people-watch. No matter how much he tries to tamp it down, no matter how many as-needed anti-anxiety meds he popped beforehand, Cas can still feel his anxiety creeping up his throat at the idea of meeting a horde of new people. He loves this game, though, and if continuing to play means he has to risk being ridiculed by fifteen new teammates, then so be it. Samwell had just been a fluke--a really fucking awful fluke, sure--but he got through it.
Cas is going to be sick.
And there he is. Looking flustered and a little panicked, the dude’s rushing toward his table (yes, he’s sure it’s his; he even glances behind him to make sure). Dean must be seeing things, though, because the second the two of them lock eyes, the guy’s anxiety just seems to...go away.
He tops the whole thing off with a wink, and instead of handing him his axe, Heyerdahl pulls it back, considering Dean for a second, before moving fast and driving the butt of the thing hard into Dean’s gut in one fluid motion. Dean doubles over with a gasp, immediately chastising himself for that stupid fucking idea as his arms curl protectively around his middle. He ignores the way Sam startles at the violence—makes sense; Dean’d spent most of both their childhoods shielding Sam from seeing and experiencing shit like this as much as possible—and Novak, god love him, takes what Dean has decided is a concerned step closer.
“That’s Jack,” Sam says. “Dean’s dog.”
He doesn't realize they're coming up fast on some slower runners until they're practically on top of each other.
“You gotta calm down,” he says once they’re out of earshot of Cas.
“What about a selfie?”
Suddenly the Winchesters' home—the cleanliness and order that seemed so out of place before—makes complete sense to him. “I was wondering why your house was so clean,” Cas says, and Dean gasps.
A hooded, masked figure sneaks up behind the man with the gun in Cas’ face and without warning, slams his fist hard into his temple. The man cries out in surprise and whirls around as his gun goes clattering to the pavement, and Cas stands frozen in place, staring at the scene unfolding before him.
good.”
That relief dissipates real quick when Cas chooses to take a seat next to him upon his return.
“Cheers,” Dean says, clinking their glasses together before closing his eyes and taking a drink. “To, uh, literature. Or whatever.”
“I'm guessing you can't tell me whether you've already driven Michael out here, huh?” he asks. It's common knowledge in the
Winchester’s eyes are the first thing Cas sees, and he notices the subtle way they widen when he finally enters. Cas finds himself intrigued by the way they’re still bright and defiant, even after last night; if he were in Winchester’s position, he’d be on the verge of tears right about now.
Dean has his arm slung across Cas’ shoulders, and Cas is looking at him like he hung the moon. At least they somehow missed their makeout session, but there’s no real room for interpretation as to the nature of their relationship, and Cas grips the magazine tighter.
something Dean hadn’t been prepared for.
"Who's your roommate?"
Charlie shakes her head. “Nah,” she says. “I bet you’re right, Cas. I bet he met someone, and he doesn’t want to screw it up. But whoever it is, maybe he doesn’t think he has a chance with them, and that’s why he picked the photo he did.”
“Aiden, don--”
Cas looks up at her, his hands full of medical supplies.
sticks up their asses say.”
Cas can’t help but laugh at that, and a warmth grows in his gut at Dean’s smile in response. It’s almost immediately extinguished, though, when Dean’s eyes go dark again. You should’ve told me once you figured it out, Cas.”
Castiel nods, and the man beams, looking like he’s restraining himself from pulling Castiel into a hug right there on the porch. “I’m guessing I have the right house, then?”
Alistair tuts disapprovingly, like someone might do to a misbehaving child. “Now, is that any way to talk to your hosts, boy?”
“Well, if I knew that, I never would’ve signed up,” Dean jokes weakly.
