“Can’t do that. You sat on my set of tables. You can’t change servers now. Sheriff Jerkwad over there will have my head. Can you guys at least order we need to move this along you know.” Tony half smiled at Bruce then huffed at the rest.
"Tony, please Pops will kill me if he sees you naked and dirty". Bucky pleaded while trying to reach Tony. “I’ll give you coffee?" Bucky bargained, coffee always was a win with his little brother
“You telling me? I bagged blondie with blue eyes.” Tony smiled at Steve brightly.
“Too close, control your man, Nat. Blue eyes is spoken for”. Tony warned and then moved closer to greet Natasha and give Bucky the stink eye.
Clint got out of his castle and made his way down to his lab while Uncle Steve was talking to Jarvis. He sneaked out of uncle's sight and then waited at the lab's door. Tony normally didn't get up to get someone at the door but this time he was the one who opened the door to Clint.
"I never! You little... we have a question for you. If you were about to dump someone will you be more likely to paint your nails or less likely?". Tony asked as he looked at the screen with Bucky who looked a bit too eager to hear the answer.
"Busy? ...yeah...ok, ask him what he wants for dinner. We are ordering out. I don't want to cook". Steve said then looked around the living room. He was sure that Clint's legs were visible from his castle just a few minutes ago.
"We played Tarzan! But he didn't know I was Tarzan and he was Jane!” Tony said he excited. "Is that why you were naked?” Steve wondered. “Uh huh! I was a good Tarzan too!" “Yeah, you are". Steve kissed Tony's cheek
"Thank you, Tony" Clint said in a small voice.
"Do look like a monkey's uncle to you?” Tony answered then waited for Clint.
"That's gotta hurt. Sit still, kid." Steve walked to the table, helped Bucky from under the table, and carefully inspected his head. When Steve found that his kid was bruise-free, he asked Bucky “ok, so, do I wanna know why you're under the table".
“But I really wanted to go out today uncle. I really hoped we could celebrate our anniversary with you.” Natasha said while pouting at Tony.
"That's the dosage; you need to have a less one. Name's Tony Stark by the way. Name's on the building you see, and that ungrateful hair do is my son, Pete. Or should I say Dr. Peter Parker. He dropped my name, took after his mother's. Not like I care, I mean, I only gave him a life, a roof over his head; and paid for his degree". Tony rambled on but kept looking at the prescription at hand and making notes on it for better dosages and other brands.
"No!"<
“I spent a whole summer! A whole summer helping him and that Parker kid with math. and do you know how they repay me? With an - A and a lousy B”. Tony huffed and then moved his legs around the chair. “And Ducky is paying for all the candy, that kid just stole” Tony pointed at Steve’s chest.
Tony just looked at Bucky and then shrugged. " Your Pops actually likes me in lingerie, he buys them for me, and I look fabulous in them," he said with a snap of his finger. " also not the point, I'm trying to help you out. Jarvis what is Nat up to?". Tony patted Bucky's side.
"Fuck man... you can't just leave things, alone can you? Did I or did I not tell you to not touch my stuff. Just stop it ok?" Bucky yelled at Tony but didn't move from his spot when Tony tugged him closer and gave him a hug. " I really thought we were doing great me and her". Bucky said after a while of Tony just hugging him.
Bucky turned a bright shade of red and then cleared his throat and fiddled with his ear with his metallic arm. "Um... we were... saying things... not so PG things."
“Bucky! You’re back. And Natasha, oh dear me ,you look lovely in that dress”. Steve greeted cheerfully and went over to give Bucky a hug.
“Since when I’d pick a stranger over my baby?” Steve held on to Tony and gently rubbed at his side. “And I’ll have this over you now; I can do whatever I want”. Steve said and had a big smile on his face while Tony chuckled. Steve held on to Tony, then went to the back room to get Tony something to help lower his blood pressure.
"Never. Annoying teenagers is what I'm put on earth to do. Show me what's wrong with the phone. I'll fix it for you, and you can go brag about it to your girlfriend as you normally do". Tony said as he dunked his fourth spoon of ice cream into his coffee and leaned his body across the table to reach Bucky's phone.
Meanwhile as Steve walked on to the floor. He called his kids and found no answer. "Jarvis? Where are the kids?”
“No they’re not. I’ll just have to clear it with mommy and you mister, I don’t hear any grief from you about being a push over. You caved in under five minutes,” Steve said then pointed at Tony.
On day 11, Clint dropped his final defense against his headspace and actually dropped to a very young age. He took to keeping a binky in his mouth and signing instead of talking, if they ask him many questions.
“Day shod ad Bucky and me god him in da arm” (they shot Bucky and me, got him in the arm) Tony they quickly relayed.
“TOLD YOU HE EVEN WEARS A COWBOY HAT” Clint hysterically started laughing, then tabbed at the table.
“Stop looking at me like that. I can’t follow you with a mop and bucket all day as well as mop the floor”. Steve looked at Tony and then winked.
"But why?" Bucky whined at Tony.
The brightly lit room was closing in on Tony, The wide space was getting smaller and smaller, the smell went from lemon zest to a foul stench. "I don'd wand do be here." ( I don’t want to be here)  Tony squeaked through his hands, which were currently covering his nose.
“Howdy y'all. I will be your…oh shit” Tony said as he noticed who was sitting on the table he was serving.
As Steve was away, the store’s bell dinged again. Tony sighed and then looked over as a couple walked in. “Your kid stole again”. Tony pointed at the man with his cane.
Tony turned a shade of red and then cleared his throat " People do that to various degrees of success. But like what did you do? Did she walk in on trying out a gold and titanium alloy suit?" Tony asked his face slightly going back to its normal colour.
“No Tony, its lunch time. You need to eat food first” Steve said and then looked at Tony’s face
Steve who was confused looked between the two, but then turned to talk to the old man. "I..when they first gave me the heart pills , it made my skin all blotchy for a while , I just thought that's what it was supposed to do". Steve looked at him for a while.
“Huh?" Tony said fighting another yawn. "Daddy said, no more battles till Sunday. He said we get this weekend off." Tony's face had a frown.
"You're done for the day, Anthony. When I get back, I expect to see a clean man with clean clothes holding a piece of fruit in his hand. Understood?". Pepper ordered and then waited for the answer.
“Clint is high as kite just like Tony is, Fucking Tony get off her bother you’ll kill him.” Steve said as he attempted to pull tony with the aid of Pepper.
"You're a denier. You do look on the young side. What to give to look as sexy as you". The old man said as the pharmacist said. "Stop harassing my costumer. He does not want you to hit on him. Sorry Mister Rogers, but it seems like some of these pills have been prescribed to you for the first time. Do you know if you have any allergies?"
“God damn it. You always do that to me. Which flavor and no weird scinecy sex. Mommy is coming and I have to look presentable,” Steve said as he kept rubbing his forehead.
“Whoa whoa whoa whoa… my wife and two kids are here for the Pioneer experience. Where is the old timey talk? ” Bucky said then pointed At Natasha, Clint, and Bruce.
"Buck... we need to talk. Meet me at our place ". Tony read out the text Nat sent and then stopped pushing down Bucky. "Ouch... she needs to talk... buddy sorry. " Tony said as Bucky tugged his phone out of Tony's hands.
“I believe Master Stark is under the kitchen table". Jarvis promptly answered
This was outrageous, Steve thought to himself , how did that old man just cut line like that and why was no one objecting to this behavior. He'll get up and talk to him.
"I was trying to help," Tony muttered under his breath and just looked over at Bucky waiting to hear the answer.
“Just water will be fine, thank you”. Bruce said in a small voice.
“He’s not my kid. He’s the miss’s baby brother”. The man nuzzled at the lady’s neck.
"And he is correct! But dear Anthony! Hear my bid! I heard of a wondrous closet. It contains every sugary treat known to man. And it's hidden here in our midst". Thor tried to convince Tony. Bruce was starting to dose off again when Tony nudged him.
“Um.  Yeah.  Thanks,” Tony mumbled and set his fork back down on the edge of his plate.  “It’s good.”
“Dinner first? Classy,” Brock said, huffing out a laugh and downing the rest of his drink.  “Shit,” he added, biting at his lip.  “Can you believe this?” he asked, spreading his arms wide, a grin forming.  “I mean, we’re gonna be rich, Steve.
“Garden club.  Best tomatoes,” Tony replied, twisting his mouth around the words.  “She was very proud.”
“You’re really okay with all of this?” Tony asked in a wet, thick voice into the curve of Steve’s neck.
“Yeah, but that’s what you’re here for,” Cam replied with an air of pragmatism that Steve envied sometimes.  “You’re his concubine.  You’re supposed to pleasure him.  The other stuff, though.  It would be kind of sad if he had to tell you to like him, because then he would know you didn’t, really.  So, you should find out what he likes and do that, and then he’ll like you more.”
“I just…I guess I figured you would rather me handle that for you. That’s why I’m asking.  So I would know how you wanted to vote,” Steve explained, giving Tony a somewhat baffled look.
Steve should've probably met the person who said that. He should've been shouted at by said person until that wisdom was ingrained in his being.
“Mr. Rhodes, Boss is asking if you are done with the briefing?” he heard Friday asked making him look up. Tony’s here. “Yes, tell him I’ll be up in a minute,” he answered before standing up. “Vision will show you where you will be staying,” he said before heading towards the door. “Colonel,” Steve said making Rhodes stopped but he didn’t look, “Will we be able to see Tony?” he asked. “That’s for Tony to decide, Rogers,” he said before leaving.
When opened it, again, Tony saw the way Steve was looking at him. He was giving Tony a look which speaks to his every being. It was hopeful, determined, and passionate. It was the unwavering look of Steve Rogers — the exact look he fall for.
Tony and Steve were lounging on the couch watching How I Met Your Mother (it’s a good show that makes Tony’s heart flutter even if sometimes the episodes make him cringe) and a few hours after he put Morgan to bed when Peter came home soaking wet (the dork in him rose to the occasion when that rhymed). The couple watched as Pete headed upstairs, probably to go to his room before sharing a look with each other. “Something’s wrong,” Steve whispered in Tony’s ear. “He always greets us before going to his room,” he continued. Tony cocked his head to the side before giving his husband a soft kiss on the lips, “Prep the hot cocoa for me, please?” Steve only smiled back.
“Want to tell me what’s wrong?” Tony asked to which Peter answered by shaking his head – no. “You sure, underoos?” He asked again. “I’m fine, Mr. Stark,” he replied before wiping his nose. “Really? Back to that again? Honestly, kid, do I need to have a casual meeting with death again so you’d call me Tony?” When he heard the sharp intake of breath, he knew he shouldn’t have joked about it. “Too –” “
It looks like he wanted to give up. He had bags under his eyes; it seems as if a permanent frown had taken residence on his forehead. He looked older, much older than he was the last time they had seen each other.
He removed his helmet before kneeling in front of him, pressing his forehead against Tony’s, as he cradled his face with both of his hands. He wanted to close his eyes and savor this moment but he won’t because this will be the last time he will see those beautiful warm brown eyes. Tony was smiling at him.
He got out and was a different man.
The only thing running through her head is she’s going to lose a lot of people in the span of 24 hours and she doesn’t know how she’ll cope with that.
They all looked at him. Natasha’s lips curled up to a barely noticeable smile. Clint bit his lip to prevent from doing so. Bruce was looking at him, gratefully. Thor shook his head before lightly patting his back and offering a small smile. And Steve gave him a hopeful look. He looked at Tony as if he was grateful that he’s alive. As if Tony held the secrets of the world which Steve was trying to discover.
Before they left Wakanda, they said goodbye to everyone they had gotten closed with. Sam said goodbye to M’Baku, Nat to the Okoye and the Dora Milaje, Wanda to the princess and the queen, and Steve to T’Challa.
“Oh for fuck sake. Your stupid floors are always filthy”. Tony said grumpily.
“How many of those blue pills, do you still have?” Tony gave him a wicked smile.
Because of course he had.  He’d known that weeks ago.  He kept running things over and over again in his head.  He should’ve just told Tony about the situation early on.  Put an end to this whole charade of a client relationship with Tony and let him know how he felt.  Deep down, he’d known how Tony would react.  He knew the man well enough at this point to realize that he would manage to take the information and turn it around in his head so that it was somehow something sordid that Tony could have just controlled, if only he’d been a better person.  For all his outward bravado, Tony rarely missed a chance to blame himself, if it was at all humanly possible.  Steve couldn’t understand why Tony did that to himself, when Tony was the most brilliant, wonderful, generous person he’d met, but he knew enough about Tony to know that Tony didn’t see himself that way, couldn’t see it that way.  Only saw how he’d failed, the things he’d missed, never what he’d actually accomplished.
“Stabbed me in the neck,” Tony repeated, emphasizing each word, “Got my bodyguard signed up to be a Goonie, and left. Now, you and Spy Barbie are what?  Painting each others’ nails and braiding your hair?  Was there at least a pillow fight?  There is in my head now, just so you know,” Tony said, tapping a finger against his forehead and scrunching up his face.
Steve had spent a lot of time not thinking about that article, not thinking about how he had always known, not thinking about how some part of him still held a thread of hope that kept slowly unspooling with time and distance until he was afraid if he looked at it too long or too hard, he would get to the end and there would be nothing left.
The irony was, Tony thought, that those poor boys were probably going to get such a long talk about taking responsibility for their actions, they’d be offering up body parts before it was over.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, wincing as his palm caught on the bump.
But hospitals were a whole other issue.  Hospitals smelled of death and disinfectant, sickly sweet to hide what was underneath.  He hated that smell, always had.  Too many visits when he was sick, then watching his mom go back time and time again, never seeming to get better, wondering if this was the last time as she shuffled down the hall to wait her turn behind a curtain with a quietly murmured lie, “Wait here, Stevie, I’ll be fine.” He found himself shivering against cold that wasn’t there.
Steve turned and let out a long breath. The walk to Room Six seemed to stretch out for miles, but the next thing he knew, he was at the door and turning the knob. His throat was dry. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest. For a second, he didn’t want to open the door, not because he didn’t want to go into the room, but because a part of him was afraid it wouldn’t be the same. That it wouldn’t help the way it had before. But, when he stepped inside and closed the door shut, the worry almost instantly faded.
Steve…he had just been busy.  No time.  That was it.
He smiled again then and stretched up to capture Tony’s mouth in a searing kiss, his tongue pushing past the seam of Tony’s lips and delving deep before he pulled back and looked down at where Tony lay beneath him.  He sat back and regarded Tony for a long moment, then reached his hands behind his neck and undid the necklace that hung there.  Tony had noticed it last night.  Steve seemed to wear it all the time, even when he wore nothing else.  A pair of sharp teeth—cave lion, Tony’s mind supplied—carved with some kind of rudimentary sigil dangled from the simple, leather thong.
“Okay,” Tony said after a long moment of silence, during which Steve could swear he could hear both their hearts pounding.
“Huh?  No, no, it’s fine.  I’m fine.  I’m—it’s good.  Really.  I’m just—last time, you know.  Forget it.  It’s stupid.  I want to.  Let’s go,” Tony urged in a rushed voice, blinking back the sudden sting at the corner of his eyes.
“Depends on whether that’s an epi-pen in your pocket or you’re just happy to see me,” Steve quipped in dry deadpanned voice, then grinned widely as Tony spluttered into a laugh.
“I’ll give you a million dollars if you do it,” Tony offered.
“You’re so wet for me, Tony,” Steve murmured, drawing a long, low moan from Tony as his eyes squeezed shut again.  Too much.  God, it was too much.  Too much, but he wanted more, God, please,
“You were just so much, you know?  Larger than life,” Steve said, frowning at the memory.  “I mean, God, it was hot as Hades out there, and there you were in this perfect suit, looking like you stepped out of some magazine or something, going around glad-handing everyone, talking all fast and smooth, posing for selfies, and I—I bought it.  The image you try to project,” Steve continued as Tony glanced away.  “You make it easy, Tony, you really do.  You’re good at it.
“Just passing through,” the man replied.
“It makes him feel better about leaving the isolation room, I think,” Steve offered.
“By what?” Steve asked, looking around again as if the answer would materialize.
Or, the time when Tony couldn’t tell if he was shaking from Steve’s thrusts or because he was laughing so hard because the God-damned cuckoo clock they’d gotten in Germany kept cuckooing each time the bed rocked, like it was cheering them on in bizarre, German gameshow fashion.  Which was how there ended up being a clock-shaped hole in their wall that was now covered by one of Steve’s drawings, but Tony could still make Steve turn red just by making a cuckoo noise, and he honestly thought that was a gift.
“That’s…an incredible level of commitment, Sourpatch, and we both know that you have just such a repertoire, which I am definitely not judging, but I don’t think it’ll be necess—“ Tony started, cutting off when Rhodey grabbed him by the shoulders and spun him around on his stool, then started wheeling him towards the workshop door.  “Hey!  Hey!  Pepper, help, I’m being kidnapped!”
“No, I mean, yes, thanks, please delete it, but is he okay? Did I do something wrong, I—” Steve started, then flattened his mouth at the woman’s sharp look.
“Highly unlikely,” Tony replied.
wanted?  Steve thought he wasn’t what Alphas would want?  Wasn’t what Tony wanted?  Had he fallen into some weird alternate universe?  That wasn’t actually out of the question. Fucking Reed.  Tony shook his head to try to clear the alcohol haze he’d worked up.  He struggled to a stand and walked over to where Steve stood a few steps  inside the door, looking up at him, perfect, beautiful, wonderful Steve who wanted to leave him because he thought Tony didn’t want an Omega who also happened to be Captain America and could break Tony in two if he wanted.
“Yeah?” Fury demanded in a clipped tone.
It didn’t seem like he needed to explain any further than that, because the alien waved the gel away from Tony’s cock and took it in his hand, stroking the length once, twice, and that was all it took. Pleasure sparked hot and hard down Tony’s cock.  He stiffened, mouth falling open, then threw his head back as he came hard just as the alien’s cock buried itself within him again. He could feel the warm strands of come coating his stomach and thighs, and when he looked down, it trailed over the alien’s hand and arm as he worked the rest of Tony’s orgasm out of him.  Tony’s breath caught in his throat, because, dear God, that was erotic as hell, and something like agreement and happiness and just...
“You got your degree in Middle Eastern Studies, right?” Tony said, pulling the words from a brain that rather uncooperatively wanted to send blood elsewhere, making him shift in his chair and thank the waitstaff for not being overly-efficient enough to have taken the napkins from their laps just  yet.  “Must’ve been tough doing that while you were enlisted,” Tony continued at Steve’s nod.
Christmas, 1980.
“I was thinking sofa,” Rogers responded with a laugh.  “But, I’ll put it on the list,” Steve promised, and damn if he didn’t pull out a small spiral notebook and write it down.  “So, ah, Coulson.  I’ll take care of getting the cabin stocked, and we’ll have your things packed up and sent over.  Anything else you need, just let him know.  He’ll take care of it.”
“Tony, you know you didn’t pack any clothes, right?” Steve said, wrapping his arms around Tony’s middle and peering over Tony’s shoulder.
“Tony,” Steve said again, quieter, gentler, and pulling Tony’s gaze back to him of its own volition.
“Cap’s gonna beat it, though,” Tony said confidently, dropping his arm to his chest, and making something in Steve’s chest constrict, to see him so small and vulnerable and clutching a image of Steve to his chest where the reactor would one day sit.
Shaking his head at the stray thoughts, Steve looked back down at his phone screen where the MIT Beaver logo underlined bright photos of the campus. He could probably arrange a tour or something like that, Steve thought.  Would Tony like something like that? A surprise trip? That...was a thing Omegas liked. He remembered from one of his searches.  Number six: Romantic Weekend Getaway.  He wasn’t sure if engineering professors and robots were romantic. Maybe they were to Tony, though, Steve thought with a small smile.  The Jetsons, he remembered.  The Jetsons and their robot maid.  Maybe they could be romantic for them.
“Good,” Steve admitted, somewhat reluctantly.  Not because he wasn’t sure that it was true, but because it was embarrassing to acknowledge, even as the word left a trail of warmth curling in his chest. “But,
“Rest, Tony,” Steve said, voice rough, but surprisingly gentle.
“This is the stuff of nightmares, you know that, right?” Tony shot back, snorting out a huff of annoyance, arms crossing across his chest, a look of admonition and...confusion on his face.
Steve shot him an annoyed look, but clamped his jaw shut and didn’t say anything else as he followed closely behind Tony. They made the cargo elevator without encountering anyone else. “I think we’re clear,” Tony said just as the alarm claxons began sounding.
Tony turned around from his position at the limo and opened his mouth to say something, but his words were cut off by a loud shout from across the parking garage.
“Speaking of change, I hear you’re trying to move Stark Industries away from the weapons business,” Steve said, making it a question.  “You could always tell the Stark tech from the other gear, though we grunts didn’t exactly get to play with the really fun stuff.”
“Here’s the deal, I’ll give you twenty thousand a month for your apartment, but I need you to leave, like, right now,” Tony told him.  “Out. Vamoose. Gone.  You and…whatever bottles you can carry.”
“I told you last night,” Steve began, bracing his arms on the counter and dropping his head down for a moment before lifting his gaze to Tony.  “You don’t have anything to apologize for about last night.  I’m glad you called me.  I’m glad I got there—” he broke off and cleared his throat.  Tony could see the Adam’s apple bobbing there as Steve struggled with his words.  He wanted to go wrap his arms around Steve, if for no other reason than it was strangely nice to actually see how upset Steve was on Tony’s behalf. “When I did,” he said finally, then went back to viciously scrubbing the counter with one of the dishtowels.
Not that Ty wasn’t careful, just that, well, he didn’t really have the same issue as Steve, despite what he seemed to think, Tony thought with a huffing snort of laughter.  Besides, Ty had been sorry he’d gotten carried away again and promised to make it up to Tony later.  Tony knew how sweet Ty could be when he put his mind to it.  Like the thing with Tony’s birthday.  Sure, it hadn’t actually been Tony’s birthday that particular day, but it was the thought that counted, right? Okay, sometimes, Ty got busy and forgot things, but that was totally understandable with everything he was doing.  Ty was super busy. Busier even than Tony.  And under so much pressure all the time, Tony told himself.  Tony definitely knew how that felt.  It could drown out everything else. So, sure, Tony could remind Ty, of course, but he didn’t want to sound too needy.  Ty
The King’s mind was incredible, Steve had realized at some point during what turned into a lecture on the benefits of hinged counterweights on trebuchets as opposed to fixed.  Not just well-read or highly educated, the way all the upper class would be, but brilliant and intuitive in a way that Steve had never encountered.  The King seemed to move from topic to topic in some kind of mental flow that only made sense to him, and it took all Steve could do to keep up.  A part of Steve was exhausted and wanted nothing more than to close his eyes, and, yet, exhilaration was firing under his skin, too, the kind he hadn’t felt since…well, since the first time he lifted the shield and threw it, arm outstretched, waiting, knowing it would find his hand again.
“No,” Steve sighed.
“Why do I feel like that about sums up our relationship?”  Steve teased, mouth twisting into a grimace as his eyes flashed sharp and bright at Tony.   “Fine,” he conceded with an exaggerated sigh at Tony’s pleased huff of laughter.  “If this is what you really want…”
“Like what you see?” Tony asked with an amused quirk of his lips.
“Outreach.  Nice,” Rhodey observed mildly.
“It’s not hieroglyphics!  It’s finally people who speak English!” Tony snorted.
“Tony,” Steve said, standing up and walking a few steps towards where Tony stood between the bathroom door and the studio’s small kitchenette.  “I—I just…I guess, thanks?  For…well.  It—it was—I did have good time. Tonight.  With you.  Just, you know.  Thanks.”
“I need to work on some of this paperwork, Tony,” Ms. Potts announced.  “For the recent transaction,” she added through her teeth, then gave Steve a bright smile.  “Press conference Saturday, so tomorrow, you two have the night off for rehearsal.  I don’t want any surprises, and Matt will be here to go over the legal phrasing we want you to use, just basic stuff, don’t worry.  Mr. Barnes, I know you have an appointment tomorrow morning, and particularly since Mr. Stark is going with you, it’s very important to remember—”
If Steve would let him, Tony would make it unbreakable.
“They were just standing there!” Tony protested loudly, pushing himself off the wall where he had been leaning. “And I wasn’t going to just leave him when he can’t so much as raise a pinky to defend himself.  Oh, whatever,” Tony continued, waving a hand in the air at her dubious look.  “Look, point is,” he began, then quieted at the sharp glares from passing hospital personnel.  “Point is, they don’t know what they’re dealing with here—
“Because it’s better to try to get some--some
“Sounds about right,” was all Steve replied, but Tony counted it as a win, since the outright animosity at Tony’s presence seemed to have dissipated on the ride down to the garage.  Tony drove, which meant Steve spent the ride to the soup kitchen clutching the dash and digging his foot into the floorboard in a vain attempt to assist Tony with braking.  How the man could throw himself out of buildings and land on the equivalent of a large dinner plate without blinking but get his knickers in a twist over a few minor traffic infractions was beyond Tony.
Tony followed Coulson’s gaze.  Stared for a long moment.  Then looked back up at Steve.  Really looked this time.  Beyond the wires and the tubes.  Beyond the blood and the way his skin looked marble-pale under the bright lights.
Steve reached out and took Tony’s balls in his hands, lifting and separating the soft flesh, then leaned over and dipped his head down, breathing in deeply of Tony’s scent. It was musk and sex and the slightly sweet odor of Steve’s own slick, and it went straight to his cock. He could feel the spurt of pre-cum leak out between his legs onto the mattress where his own cock still thrust against his stomach.
“Steve!” the woman, Nasha, said, shaking her head in amazement, then running forward to throw herself into Steve’s arms. “It’s really you! I can’t believe it!”
“Because Stane was running your East Coast operations then, right?”  Steve continued.
Steve lifted his hips and caught some of the fluid as it leaked between the cleft of his ass.  He rubbed it around the rim of his hole, pushing a finger in with a moan he tried to muffle by throwing an arm over his face.  He closed his eyes. His breath was coming in heaving pants now. A fine sheen of sweat beaded across his skin, pooling beneath his back.  He felt sticky. Open. Exposed. And Tony...Tony wasn’t even looking. Tony didn’t even know. Didn’t care. No one was watching. No one would know. He thrust his finger in deeper, then added a second. It hurt, he was too dry, but he didn’t mind. It was a good kind of hurt.  A deep, emptying ache. He could like it or not like it. Do it or not. It didn’t matter. Maybe it was strange. Wrong. He didn’t know. No one knew. Not even Tony.
“You don’t have to apolo-“ Steve started.
“I’m not sure what it says about my life that I find that incredibly romantic,” Tony grumbled into the cocoon of Steve’s chest. He felt Steve vibrate with a low laugh at that.
“I’d have told you it was the friction.  Between the temperature in general and the friction from the roadway, the casing heated up enough to blow, even without the primer.  Highly unusual, but not impossible,” Tony said, keeping his tone carefully neutral.
“Okay.  Ah, bye,” Tony called out to Coulson and tossed a quick wave over his shoulder as he hurried to catch up to Steve.
“Ah, Steve, come on, don’t be like that,” Brock said, throwing a hand up and letting it fall ineffectually to his side.  “Where're you going?  For fuck’s sake, Steve, don’t be a drama queen about this!  You know how Mitch is.  He didn’t mean anything by it, right Mitch?”
“There’s literally an unconscious psychopath hog-tied on the floor next to them,” Rhodey said, nodding towards Obie.
“Not as such,” Zola replied.  “I merely wanted to be sure we understood each other.”
He wanted to see it, though, Tony realized. Pain. Regret. Something. He needed at least that. Give me that, he thought, feeling it knot inside his chest and lodge there, the anger, the hurt, the fucking grief that he had to carry with him. Let Steve carry some of it.
“Can’t say I’m sorry to hear that,” Steve replied.
—this hand, man…” he trailed off, picking up the edge of his cards and peeking under.  “Man! I got a winner. Drinks on me!”
“In fact, my sources tell me that your commanders wanted to put you up for the Medal of Honor, but you declined, is that correct?” Everhart asked, making Steve start with surprise.  Well, that was one that wasn’t off the notecards, Steve thought with a grimace.
Tony’s train of thought derailed as he stared, open-mouthed, at the underwear model who opened the door. Well, technically, that occupation was a guess, but if the Calvin Klein fit, then put him on a billboard in Times Square, Tony figured, because holy hell, the guy was gorgeous. Evening was looking up.

“Take off your robe and lie on the bed for me,” Tony ordered, making a shiver run down Steve’s spine and coil, hot and liquid, in his gut.  There was always something in Tony’s voice when he spoke to Steve like this. Some cadence, almost like a certain note vibrating that went straight to some deep, dark part of Steve’s mind.  It sounded, if he had to put a name to it, like a softer version of the noise that erupted from Tony’s hammer when he was at the forge back at the Castle. A quaking, hard, metallic sound that echoed into Steve’s bones and shaped him into something transformed, as surely as Tony’s strong, clever hands worked the metal that he reformed.
Steve nodded, holding Tony’s gaze as steadily as he could. His throat bobbed as he worked at swallowing. He concentrated on breathing. It felt as if he might forget if he didn’t. Tony’s dark eyes moved over him. Steve couldn’t find any anger there, not now, at least. Just the familiar steely-hard certainty that enveloped Tony whenever he needed to punish Steve, and a deep, abiding hunger that lurked underneath it all.
As always, thank you so much for reading, commenting and supporting this story and 'verse.  You are all so wonderful.  I'm really thrilled so many people seemed to have enjoyed this fic.

That was what Zola had said.  Steve had not looked past the words when he first heard them, but now…
. You?  You see something wrong, and you call it by its name, and I’ll be damned if we don’t need some of that around here. I’ll not lie to you,” he continued, voice going lower and carrying a note of warning in it.  “That a concubine holds such sway over a King is a dangerous thing. For a king, there are always vultures circling, hoping to find a weakness.  He knows this, and I think you are smart enough to see this, as well.  But, behind his doors? You could do good here, Steve.
“He wants to book you again. Tonight,” she said, a question in her voice.  “The fee I quoted him was insane, and he didn’t so much as blink.  This is a good opportunity for you, Steve.  If you are agreeable, he’ll send a car for you.  Dress is casual.  You’d just be going to his place.”
we can.  I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up.  I don’t want a body count to be our legacy.”
“I’ll just—“ Tony started, when the door opened and hit him in the ass, sending him stumbling forward.
“Whoo-boy,” Rhodey whistled lowly when the elevator opened, pulling back and giving Tony an appraising look as Tony stepped out into the hotel’s lobby.  “You okay, or do you need to stop and stamp your foot a few times there, Thumper?”
Hey, so, we're down to the last part of Family. I'm sorry it took so long. I had to finish my final exams and deal with other school requirements. Anyways, the good news is I FINALLY GRADUATED and may or not have already had vacation hence the late upload.
He says he’s a futurist but he’s looking back into the past and continuously thinks of how different things could have ended up if he just stopped and breathe.

– “Code accepted, welcome, Captain Rogers, you have one message from boss,” he heard Friday say, “
” she laughed at that. “It seems like an insult but he I knew it wasn’t because I heard him say it before – I can still remember how I felt after hearing it. Now, it just, it sounded fond.” Steve turned to look at Natasha and saw her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
“I think if we were under different circumstances, a different decision would have been made...” there was a pregnant pause, Tony seemed to be thinking if he should speak more. “The others and I... we believed in different things. Maybe the timing wasn’t right – we couldn’t agree with each other, we failed to act as a team and that’s on us,” he added.
The room was filled with Tony's family. The family he gained by being a good man. He saw how loved he was, how he got to live a happy life despite its abrupt end. Maybe this was it for Tony. Maybe he thought he already peaked. Maybe this was what he considered to be his happy ending – his family, together and complete.
“At this point, I’m really not sure, Greg,” Tony said, addressing the reporter. He, then, removed his glasses. Steve took a sharp breath.

And if, sometimes, within the four walls of his bedroom he thinks it wasn’t, no one will ever know.
The first time Steve hears the song, he was on his way to the kitchen to warm some milk for himself. He couldn’t sleep because, well,
“It doesn’t change the fact that you still died,” the depth of Peter’s words truly hit him when he saw the kid’s eyes – it was red and puffy.
“Anyways, I know that it’s very insensitive of me to do this to you but I need you to do me a favor. I’m not going to ask if that’s okay because honestly… I don’t know, really. I just won’t ask anymore because I’m gone and won’t hear your thoughts about this,” Steve vaguely hears Tony say
But the Ten Rings weren’t stupid. They knew something was up. They tried to hurt Yinsen. I need him, great assistant. He was so scared but Stark men are made of iron. They don’t break. The Ten Rings said that if he won’t be able to deliver the next day, both of them will be dead.
“What I’m sorry about is our lost chance,” he continued and a tear slipped down Steve’s cheeks. “We could have had everything we ever wanted if we just stopped being stubborn but what’s done is done. No matter how much I’m – we’re sorry about what could have been for us. We already have different lives, now,” Tony said. “Well, you do, I’m dead so,” Steve flinched upon hearing that. He hasn’t said it yet but to hear it coming from Tony himself, man, that sucks. “Too soon?” he heard the hologram Tony asked making Steve snort, “You think?” he replied even though Tony won’t be able to give a retort.
Rhodey doesn’t, no, couldn’t react. After a month of uncertainty, thinking if his best friend will ever wake up... he just doesn’t know what to do. “Nothing?” Tony asks, looking very amused as he did. “You’re an asshole,” hearing Tony laugh made him smile. Yeah, he’s going to be okay. It will take some time to recover physically, mentally, and emotionally but he’s going to make it. Rhodey vows that he’ll make sure of it.
is alive and well sink in. “This is nice,” Peter commented making Tony smile.
Tony always thinks about how to right the wrongs, always have been ever since his eyes were opened to the realities of the world.
He doesn’t know how many times he woke up with pain consuming his entire body. He doesn’t know how many times he fainted from said pain. And when he was finally conscious, finally okay compared to the last few days he had, he saw that a car battery was attached to his body — his chest.
From the corner of Steve’s eyes he saw Fury staring out the window overlooking the lake. A mystery that Steve couldn’t solve before was Fury’s feelings about Tony. Back in 2012, when Fury talked to him and Tony after Phil died, Fury said that Tony knows about the Avengers Initiative, he was the first one he approached. He also remembers Fury directly telling Tony about the nuke, the other times he went to Tony or approached Tony first before the other avengers.
He was kneeling as he held his hand up. Tony didn’t know why he did it, maybe because he was being his usual paranoid self who couldn’t stand not having a backup plan, but he made sure that his suit gauntlet will be able to hold the stones. He felt immense pain as the power of the stones surged through him. Suddenly, his whole body felt heavy and he was starting to pant but he doesn’t care. He made sure he’s looking straight at Thanos.
Steve has probably heard Tony sing this song a thousand times but nothing beats the first time...
Natasha’s probably looking down at him and smirking wherever the hell she was. Probably thinking how much of a chicken shit he is for taking this long to make a move on Tony (not like it’s a move, it’s just... it seems like it).
“I know that this is just an excuse and that no amount of it could undo the damage we have caused, and for that we are

Isn’t it ironic that thing keeping him alive is also the thing killing him?
Natasha was still with the KGB when she first met Clint. He was supposed to kill her but he decided not to, instead he took her in and became her friend. Since then Natasha worked for SHIELD and did everything she can to atone for what she has done.
“You’re safe, Steve. I’m here.”
One of the things that Steve learned as he grew older is that being selfish is okay. There’s nothing wrong with thinking about yourself first, putting your interest first before anyone else’s.
It was the shittiest joke he has ever heard in his life.
He felt a hand rest on his left shoulder making him sit up straight. “What, no rest for the wicked?” the soft voice immediately made him relax. “Scoot over,” he heard Tony whisper making him move.  A mug was suddenly on his line of sight making his lips tug upward. “Thanks for the coffee,” he whispered before taking a sip and immediately frowning. “I added a shot of whiskey,” Tony explained. “This is the kind of thing that makes me want alcohol even though I vowed, ever since Morgan was born, that I would only take shots of chocolate milk drink,” the humor wasn’t lost on Steve.
“STAR SPANGLED BROOKLYN-07041918,” Steve thinks to himself that

“Oh yeah, it’s so obvious. Every time he hears the song, he always smiles,” Sam said. “Although, I’ve never heard him sing it,” he adds. Tony gave Steve an incredulous look. “How can you not have sang this song if it’s your favorite?” Steve shrugged as if saying
Displays compulsive behavior, prone to self-destructive tendencies, and textbook narcissism – that was what she wrote.
Tony stood up from where he was sitting. “Guess it’s my turn, huh?” He held up the flower for everyone to see. “She grew these things in the tower; I always wondered what’s with peonies that made her plant them so much so I asked her.” Tony smiled at the flower, “God, I thought she was going to kill me because she’s Natasha, you know, she’s scary,” he fondly said. It was one of the many things that made Tony love her so much. She was scary as hell on the outside but a soft human being on the inside. “Then she told me... she told me she plants it because of what it symbolizes,” he shook his head because damn it, she’s supposed to be here. She
It was like Obadiah all over again. The betrayal from someone close stings more so than any physical pain they could ever make Tony feel.

a huge smile. “If you sleep now, you can start your day early,” Tony paused, gently pushing Morgan so she’s completely lying down before tucking the blankets under her chin. “And spend your day longer with Peter,” he finished. “Okay...” she murmured. “Lullaby, please?” She requested while giving her father her best impression of a puppy. “Do you know you look like your Pops when you do that?” Tony asked before shaking his head and starting to sing.
He still doesn’t understand. Rogers could have just told him. He would have reacted, sure, but at least, he would hear it from a friend. Sure, Tony was mad about what happened to his parents because he never got to say goodbye. The regrets of not being able to still haunts him. He knows this. He told him this. But he chose to hide it from him. Maybe that’s what did it for him.
Like Tony said, it may not be the funeral that she deserves but they’re trying.
He took a peek and saw the engineer swaying his hips to the soft lull while waiting for his coffee to be ready. Steve couldn’t help the small smile that made its way to his lips. This is Tony’s sleep deprived state.
Part 3 is Tony's funeral. It will probably be Steve-centric (probably because I said part 2 is Tony-centric but we all know it's not). Hopefully, I'll be able to upload the last part next week before my finals. Wish me luck!
, as Tony dubbed, isn’t the challenge, anymore. The reality that Morgan’s going to have to find a way to grow up in is the fact that her dad wouldn’t be with her every step of the way like he did until now. The world that she’s going to have to live in is a world where everyone will expect great things from her because she’s the daughter of Tony Stark – genius, billionaire, philanthropist, and hero. It’ll be harder to her than it was for Tony when he lived behind Howard’s shadow. Steve just hopes for her to make her own path, to be her own person despite those who will push for her to follow Tony’s footsteps. Steve hopes the same for Harley and Peter because he’s sure the world’s going to want a new Iron Man.
could ever sound so miserable.
. He knew that was what Natasha was saying. He also knew that they should’ve sorted this out before it got way out of hand. Tony’s right, maybe if it were under different circumstances, a different decision would have been made – a better one.
All of them looked at Clint who was biting his lip as he stared at a coin. He made eye contact with everyone before looking back at it. “A token... from Budapest,” he whispered as a smile formed his lips. “Will we ever know what happened there?” Bruce asked with a small smile on his lips. Clint’s eyes started to water but he held it in, took a sharp breath before putting the coin inside the urn. “We promised we’ll take it to our graves,” he whispered before taking the lid decorated with ruby forming the symbol of her widow bites and closing the urn.
He was dying.
They spoke the same way they did every time one of them was going to do something stupid. And here they thought this was like Budapest. Clint leaned his forehead against Natasha’s. They stayed that way for a few seconds, savoring the feeling of each other because it will be the last time. When they pulled back from each other, well, they fought. A whole sequence ensued which ended with both of them almost falling off.
Vision was the one who welcomed them upon their arrival in the compound before they were transferred into a meeting room where Rhodey –

was what he said.
And then there’s Harley. Steve remembers Tony talking about a kid from Tennessee. He said he met him during the Mandarin attacks and bonded when the said kid gave him a place to stay, a sandwich, and a limited edition Dora the explorer watch. Steve remembers feeling confused and lost by everything Tony just said because he did so while making a potato gun named Mark 45 (which, by the way, Steve is sure can seriously injure people). Looking at him, Steve can’t help but see Tony’s hard facade. It reminded him of the phrase Tony used to say:
He caught Peter in an embrace. The kid was looking at him — eyes wild with fear and hope that somehow, Tony will be able to save him. Peter hugged him. You’re okay, kid. I got you. But Tony doesn’t know what’s happening. He was having a hard time breathing.
“I didn’t know you sang,” Steve said startling Tony. “Oh hey, Cap, didn't see you there,” Steve raised his left eyebrow as the smaller man tried to hide his blushing cheeks. He didn’t point it out, though. He likes seeing Tony’s cheeks stained pink (it’s as rare as Thor getting angry or Clint not being his cheery self).
And even if it will never be able to compensate for what all of them lost, even if they know they should do more than this, Tony hopes it's enough to make Natasha smile wherever she may be.
They fell into an easy conversation. Clint joined them afterwards and whined about how Tony got to eat her delicious cooking while he got none. Bruce entered with Thor, both holding bags of groceries, “Bruce introduced me to this delicious treat Midgard has!” he said before pulling out 10 boxes of Poptarts, each flavor different from another. Soon enough, Steve entered the kitchen looking for food after his gym binge. “Ugh! You smell, Steve, get out of my kitchen,” Tony said good-heartedly making Steve laugh. “It’s the communal kitchen, Tony, you get out,” Natasha smiled when a look of pure (pretend) horror crossed his face.
He remembers the after; the hot cocoa, touches that reminds him he’s not alone, watching documentaries of either space or nature with the volume turned down, sitting on the couch at god-knows-fucking-what o’clock.
But what they will fail to understand is
Tony tried to hold on. He tried to get a hold of Peter but he already turned to ash. As Tony looked at the remnants of Peter, as the feeling of dust pass by his arm… he looked at it. He waited and waited but his body remained in tact.
. “Hey, oh my god, you would not believe what’s going on,” Peter said. “Do you remember when we were on space –” as if he could forget “and I got all dusty and I must have passed out because I woke up and you were gone but Dr. Strange was there and he was like
Steve didn’t agree with him. They fought against each other harder than it was ever before. Steve had his own team, he also did. In the end, he stopped. In the end, he came as a person who cared – the person who loves Steve.
Sometimes, it was the ice, other times it was Bucky falling off the train but most of the times it was Tony. It was Tony flying a nuke to space, Tony yelling at Steve, asking how he could betray him, Tony crying... those things he could handle. What gives him panic attacks was him killing Tony, watching as the light leave his warm brown eyes. In these moments of panic, he holds the phone to his chest, wishing for it to ring because he doesn’t have it in him to hurt Tony anymore than he already had.
Whoever said that the after is more impactful than the during is probably winning in life.
And damn if that didn’t hurt. He knew that it will be from St —

“I do trust you, Tony,” he said, “but it wasn’t about that.” Steve moved closer to Tony before looking at him in the eye. “I wasn’t sure, at first, and then as Sam and I got closer to the truth... I was going to tell you but every time I was about to, it seemed like it was the wrong time,” he explained, “and every day I kept it a secret, it gets harder for me to tell you.” Tony was just looking at him, giving him time to talk. “I was scared that if I tell you, you’ll make me choose,” he whispered, “and I didn’t want to. I wanted to be selfish, just this once, because I wanted my best friend back...” he took Tony’s hand and squeezed, “and I wanted you, too,” he finished.
Everyone’s starting to turn to dust.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, again, before leaning his forehead against Tony’s, “Me, too,” he replied before wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and burying his face at its crook. “Are we going to be okay?” Steve heard Tony asked, voice muffled, lips moving against Steve’s neck as he spoke. Steve placed a kiss at the top of Tony’s head before saying, “Yeah, we will be.”
He remembers working hard to earn back Tony’s trust. He remembers the first time he called him Steve instead of Rogers. He remembers the way his eyes shine when he sees something amazing. He remembers how Tony’s laugh makes his heart flutter, how his happiness brings him happiness. He remembers being a mess and crying himself to sleep while Tony held him and whispered I forgive you against his ear over and over again until it sank in. Yes, he forgives me. He remembers waking up and seeing Tony’s groggy smile, I love you, he said.
After sending the arc reactor into the lake, Steve approached Fury who was standing on the terrace of the house. “Nick,” Steve greeted. “Ask away, Rogers, you’ve never been subtle,” the man replied as he started into the lake. “You always believed that Tony will save the world, why’s that?” For a second, Steve thought he saw a ghost of smile on Fury’s lips. “I knew Howard;” he started to explain “I visit from time to time, mostly after Tony’s bed time. Maria, his mother, talked about him a lot. I saw the things he invented and how he grew up through his mother’s eyes.” Steve couldn’t help but flinch at the name of Tony’s mother. “I always knew he was going to be brilliant but good? I wasn’t sure… until I met him,” he said. “I placed the weight of the world on his shoulders whenever I called for him, it’s the one thing I regret but had to be done,” Fury turned to look at Steve, “he was the hero the world needed and the hero we weren’t ready to give.”
Anyways, here's part 2! I hope you enjoy. :)
No one heard from Tony until after 2 years when the Steve’s phone suddenly rang. She looked at Steve and saw him breathing hard. She couldn’t help but hope, maybe, they will finally fix their relationship. Steve looked at her, he looked scared. She always saw him staring at the phone, contemplating if he should call, typing and re-typing because he couldn’t find it in himself to send a text. She offered an encouraging smile and nodded.
“You’re sulking,” she turned to look at Steve and smiled. He then talked about some whales or whatever which made Natasha laugh. “Are you telling me to look at the bright side?” She poked the inside of her cheek, shaking her head, and then smiled at Steve. “Keep saying that and I won’t give you half my peanut butter sandwich,”  Steve took the empty seat in front of her. “I keep telling people that they should move on – that things will get better, eventually... that they should move forward but not us, never us,” he said which made her smile. “You know, I never had a family, never really expected to find one...” she whispered. “Back before Tony asked us to move into the tower with him, I just hoped for a team,” she nodded her head while saying that, “Never really expected to get this.”
“Move, Steven,” he heard Thor say beside him. He opened his mouth, not a single word coming out. “This may be your last chance,” he added. Steve swallowed the lump in his throat as he forced himself to walk towards Tony. Pepper was there, she was already assuring him. “Hey,” he heard her say. “Pep," Tony murmured making Pepper smile. “FRIDAY,” Pepper said, asking the AI about how long Tony has. He assumes it’s short, based on her reply. “Tony, look at me,” she said with a small smile on her face. “We’re going to be okay,” she added. “You can rest now,” she finished before letting go of Tony’s hand and looking at Steve.
Tony shook his head, teeth clenched as he looked at Strange. Why would you do that? Why do you have to save me? Before shit went down the drain, he said that he will never give up the time stone to save Tony’s life but he did and Thanos won.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve knew it was wrong. Whatever he’s doing, now, he knows that he shouldn’t because Tony has Pepper and Morgan. He already accepted the fact that he couldn’t have him, not after everything they’ve been through; after all the lies, hurt, and betrayal, they’re finally rebuilding their relationship and slowly getting to where it was before (what the media dubbed as) their civil war.
to heart but that doesn't mean he's not kid. He'll whine but be patient with my eldest, 'kay? And Morgan, my Maguna..." there was a pause. Tony looked like he wasn't sure what to say. "She's too young to experience all of this. I wish I could stay, Steve, believe me," a deep breath. "Make sure she knows I love her, all of them and that I did it so they could have a future worth living."
He knew, then, that the chances of Yinsen surviving was even slimmer. But he had to be strong. He needed to be so he believed that his new friend will be safe. When the loading bar turned to a hundred, he schooled his face for the fight ahead and attacked.
Steve frowned. Tony was holding a press conference in the Avengers compound. He was wearing a full suit with a silk red tie partnered with sunglasses. He was flashing his press smile – the smile that means he’s ready to battle the vultures in front of him.
Steve also remembered how a part of him, the darkest parts of him that he refused to acknowledge, whispered that he still wants those but if it isn’t with Tony then what’s the point? He was naive. He thought he had all the time in the world to figure things out but he never was good when it came to time. Look at him asking anyone, any god or deity to give him more. He just wants more time with Tony. He should’ve expected it, really. He always fucks it up.
I don't think that this is a tear-jerker but I fucking cried while writing this fanfic because I was re-watching endgame -- the part where Tony saves the universe and I just, I thought I was over it but apparently not.
Just as well as he knew that the fact that he lied hurt Tony more.
Steve doesn’t wake up screaming – he never does. His eyes just opens and breathes hard. After that he stands up and walks around the room until he’s sweating. If that’s not enough, he goes to the gym, if that doesn’t do trick he goes for a run wearing the thickest sweater he owns even if it’s summer. It’s always been like that when he dreams about the ice. He needs to feel the heat for his brain to understand that it’s okay, he’s safe. He’s alive.
He closed his eyes after realizing the gravity of what he asked. It’s been years since they saw each other. They haven’t talked about Siberia or the Accords… basically, everything they disagreed about. That’s why, Tony thinks, it’s okay for Steve to say no. There’s still an unfinished business between them.
(It’s funny how all the things you love about someone can also be the reason why you hate them)
A battle sequence ensued, each side having their own army. A lot of things were happening at once. Tony was off fighting aliens when he saw Pepper wearing the suit he made for her before disappearing somewhere else to help the other avengers. He was about to be squashed by an alien when it was suddenly held off and behind it, he saw Peter.
“Snotty?” Rhodey repeated, then burst out laughing.
Right.  Because Steve didn’t want this, didn’t want Tony or any of this. SHIELD wanted this.  The U.S. Army wanted this.  The government needed Steve, and that was apparently high priority enough to set up the Department of Homeland Dating and find Steve a ball-and-chain that they thought would drag him back when good, old-fashioned survival instincts weren’t quite enough, and you had to add things like guilt and responsibility to the checklist.
“Army doesn't do financials until someone needs a security clearance or maybe is up for promotion, that kind of thing. Want to be sure G.I. Joe isn't going to be tempted to pay off his credit card debt with a little under the table, see,” Rhodey explained. “Anyway, I got a copy of Rogers' records, and, at some point, they ran one. Basic, nothing too in-depth, but...and this is a couple of years after the whole thing with you ended, but...there's nothing there. Guy's clean. And, okay, say he blows through all that cash like a nineteen year old might... could happen. But, there'd be some trace of it, Tones. Where'd it go? No Ferrari he ended up having to sell off, no big debts, little credit history at all, really. That just doesn't happen, not with that kind of money.”
Stop, Steve told himself sharply, closing his eyes with a shaky sigh.  This isn’t helping.
“You like splotchy,” Steve reminded him with a grin. “Which I do not get, by the way.  Look, I’ll sign whatever you need me to sign, Tony. I don’t want your money,” Steve told him, frowning a bit until he realized that his forehead was probably doing that thing that Tony had pointed out, and he forced himself to stop.
“I’m trying,” Tony said with a small grimace.
By the time he got to his suite, he had almost convinced himself that hadn’t gone as badly as it probably had.  He shut the door behind him and toed off his shoes.  He’d left his jacket downstairs and actual Jacket Police could not make him go retrieve it now.  He unbuttoned the dress shirt and slung it over the back of a chair, his eyes catching on the rolled up sleeves as he did.  The thing was, he started…the thing was, up until he’d blown it by trying to turn the evening into something it wasn’t, it had been, well, nice.  Very nice.  Steve was easy to talk to, smart, funny and there was that whole super-secret boy band thing they shared.  Hard to find someone who accepted that, let alone understood it, not that he didn’t respect Pepper’s reasoning, what with getting turned into a fire-breathing mutant.  To be fair, not your usual dating hazard.
“You were on the road,” Steve rushed out.  “That night.  When I was--when I--you were there. You...it was you. Wasn’t it?
He stopped when he got to the button at the top of his dress pants.  The music had slowed to just a horn with long, low notes that seemed to dance over the orchestra.  Steve could feel a flush of heat on the back of his neck and down to the small of his back. His heart was pounding in his chest.  He could feel his breath cooling in his chest.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Maria rushed out.  “There’s nothing—this hasn’t happened before, of course not!  What are you suggesting?  Jarvis.  Jarvis, you tell her.”
“Oh.  Right,” Steve said as they passed the guard desk and headed for the bank of elevators.  “Yeah.” Steve looked up, as he always did, and scanned the painting of Peggy that hung in the lobby as they passed by.  It was Peggy a little older than he remembered her, though still as fiercely beautiful.
Finally, when he felt Tony’s body loosening enough, he pressed a third finger in, this one sliding in more easily and began to thrust a bit, scissoring them on each thrust and felt the moment Tony’s mind gave up to his body, as he went rigid, then boneless, knees splaying, head thrown back and eyes locked on Steve.  Steve moved into position and slowly pressed his cock in, watching as Tony’s body engulfed the head and God, he was so warm and tight and it was so good, so very good and then Steve was pushing in, burying himself to the hilt, feeling his balls tap against Tony’s ass as he did.  Tony’s whole body bowed as he did, legs falling open even wider, and he reached up to grab Steve’s head to bring him down for a long kiss, followed by a quick peck as Tony collapsed back onto the bed and ground his hips downward, and
“That’s certainly how we do it where I am from,” Steve said with a completely straight face, watching Tony’s head pivot around and his eyes go wide for a heartbeat before he burst out laughing.
“I always rather enjoyed the classic movies, myself, Captain,” Jarvis said smoothly.  “Hitchcock’s works, of course.  The Postman Always Rings Twice.  Rope.  The Letter.  All those old noirs, you know? Arsenic and Old Lace was a particular favorite,” Jarvis added, glancing at Tony, who found himself choking on a bite of Waldorf salad and reaching for his mug of lemonade as he remembered his conversation with Jarvis before his meeting with Steve.
The table started to lower and widen.  The movement made Tony jump a bit in surprise, though he was too confined by the not-gel to do much of anything other than feel it ripple around him.  The bubble-gum, not-gel hood that hung over the table grew and expanded as the table did, covering nearly the whole table, leaving just the end where the alien stood open.
“Is that why you’re here?  That’s…I mean, that’s Steve,” Tony said quickly, swiping a hand through his hair.
Steve wondered if Tony would have him suck his cock.  His eyes dipped to the bulge in Tony’s breeches, and his mouth watered at the sight.  He liked doing that for Tony almost more than he liked it when Tony did it to him.  He liked the feeling of Tony’s hand wound in his hair, the weight of Tony’s cock on his tongue, the musky, sweaty scent, the feel of the velvety skin over the hardness of his shaft, the rough scrape of it on his throat when he took Tony all the way down, the soft noises Tony would make, the taste of his seed spilling into Steve’s mouth, he liked it all, but if he didn’t get relief soon, he wasn’t sure he could manage to do much of anything other than just let Tony take his mouth.  His cock twitched again at the thought, small beads of fluid appearing at the head.  When he finally dragged his gaze up, Tony had a small smirk playing on his lips. He knew. Of course, he did. He always seemed to know what Steve was thinking when they were like this. The thought was soft, suffusing his mind with a sort of lightness that seeped into his limbs and muscles, like he was slowly going weightless.
He cried out without meaning to, surprised by the mix of pain spilling over into pleasure.  His mind went blank for a moment, then filled with a tumbling roil of need and ache.  He tried to grab onto it, but it was swept away, pulled out by some implacable tide.  Oh, God, he thought, burying his head against the bed, teeth forming a rictus of pain, blindly groping for some kind of purchase.  He understood, now, the purpose of the metal cock in his ass and the cage on his cock.  Tony had thought about this. Planned this.
want. Tony’s hands came up to his chest, laying over his pecs as Tony let out a sigh and very, very slowly trailed them down Steve’s chest.  Tony’s gaze dipped down, following his hands as they slowly moved lower, towards the waist of Steve’s swim trunks.  He tilted his head, as if considering things.  “What if I just gave you the million anyway, hmmm? What if I said, just take it and go? What then?” His fingers grazed across Steve’s nipples and over the sensitive areolas, as his hands slowly worked their way lower.
“I’m not eating it, Tony, I’m testing its freshness,” Bruce grumbled as he took the leaf off his tongue and shoved it, and a few more like it, into his bag.
The garage was much the same as Tony remembered it, though the workstation had been upgraded several times in the past decade, tools replaced, and a new fabrication console added.   There were other changes, of course, accumulated over the decade.  Two bikes hung from a rack on the wall, mementos from their brief foray into mountain biking that ended when a tree nearly got the best of Tony.  On the other hand, they did get a good three year’s worth of firewood out of that thing by the time Steve was done, so there was that.  A nearly pristine set of golf clubs sat in a black bag in one corner.  Golf had seemed like a good enough idea, until Steve shot an eighteen on his first round while Tony dripped sweat in the California sun.  Stacked bags of shelled nuts lined the far wall.  Storing up for winter, Tony thought with a small smile. A dull silver ladder stood behind the bags, partially obscuring a framed Back to the Future poster.  A dry erase board hung on the wall by his workstation with a reminder to call Agent Paz accompanied by a doodle of Tony asleep in his chair with big Z’s floating above him.  He was pretty sure that message was at least two years old.
“Louisiand and Wash—LIGO.  LIGO’s there,” Tony stuttered, his mind grinding to a halt.  This wasn’t looking at the pretty stars, drawing the constellations over them on one of those souvenir map things.  This was real.  This was real, honest-to-God research.
“How do you feel?” Tony asked after some time had passed, though Steve had no idea how long.  There was a blanket over both of them now, Steve noted, though he had no memory of Tony moving to get it.
“Indeed.  As they are to see you, or so I am told,” Tony said with a small, somewhat rueful smile.  “And you, you will see to him, yes?” he said with a nod to Cam.
“How am I supposed to feel, Jarvis?” Tony demanded, slamming a hand on the table hard enough to make some of the coffee slosh over the edge of the cup and dribble down the side.  “He wants me to go.  I get to go to MIT, which is great, and I’m happy.  I am.  I’m—why can’t I be happy? Just be happy?”  His eyes burned, and he could feel his mouth scrunch up.  Ugly crying. That’s what they call it, he thought, sucking in a deep, bracing breath.  His mother said it made his face look blotchy.  She was probably right, he thought with a hitching laugh that rattled around in his chest until it didn’t sound like a laugh anymore.  “He doesn’t want me.  Jarvis, he—he doesn’t want me, and I’m trying to be happy, because MIT—I mean, MIT!  But all I can think about is why doesn’t—why not me? Why not me?  Just once?  Why not me?” Tony pleaded. The words sounded wet, like you could twist them up and wring them out in puddles on the floor.

“Death comes for us all,” Tony said, his eyes dark in the firelight.  A particularly loud fit of thunder rumbled outside, and Steve turned towards the windows where the shutters rattled against the wind.   “But, hopefully, as an old friend, at the end of a life well lived.  As it should be. You’ve been happy, haven’t you?” Tony asked, searching Steve’s face with a focused intensity, as if looking for some kind of confirmation.  “You and your family.  It has been a good life, I think. Maybe not the life you would have had, but for...circumstances, but a good life. I know what it does to a man to lose the chance to have the life he would choose.  It is not something you can ever get back.  I wanted that for you.  What I didn’t have. What was taken from me.”
“What?” Steve balked, looking between the bag and Tony in bewildered confusion.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied softly.
Panic clawed its way up Steve’s throat. It tasted like seawater, he thought, though that thought was quickly pushed to the side.  Washed away, he thought with a tide of hysteria behind it.  They couldn’t come here, they couldn’t find him like this, he had to leave, he had to leave, escape, it had to be him, he had to be the one to leave, not them, not them coming here and seeing him like this and, knowing, knowing what he was, knowing what he wanted,
“At you?” Steve asked, head snapping back in startle.  “Of course not.”
Tony emerged from the bathroom a few minutes later, dressed, hair in some semblance of order and a smile on his face that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Yeah, you’re just repeating what I said,” Tony pointed out.  “How about we go into a little detail before we, ah. Whatever this is. I mean, I’ve heard of some pretty far out there cures, but this is a little outside the FDA approval process, so, I’d just like to--”
“Hush now, these walls have too many ears,” Tony said, turning towards them as he doffed his robe and tossed it aside. “Though, I dare say I echo the general sentiment.”
“So,” Tony repeated, sipping his espresso.
“To what do I owe the incredible lack of pleasure?” Tony asked.
“This isn’t your fault, Tony. This is greed and power and not caring who gets hurt as long as he gets what he wants,” Steve said.  “He’s a bully.  In a fancy suit, with a big title and a long reach.  But, still just a bully.  Trust me.  That’s one thing I know how to recognize.”
“It’s fine,” Steve replied. “I get it. I’ve been known to snap a picture when I see something I might want to draw later, even if we’re in the middle of a conversation. Drives Br--ah, some people crazy.”
“Do you want this?” Tony heard himself say in a shaky, breathy tone that grated like nails on a blackboard.  “Me.  To be your Omega, I mean.”
He could figure this out, Steve told himself.  They weren’t…doing anything at the moment.  Just lying there, holding Tony.  It wasn’t like that would be especially difficult.  He could just…join them.  Join them and hold Tony and…and somehow convince him none of this was real.  Sure.  Yeah.
“In pain,” Steve corrected, gently, but firmly, waiting for Tony to look at him.  “Tony…what’s this really about?” Steve asked.
He carefully slid out from under Tony’s prone form and made his way to the bathroom. After he relieved himself, he carefully washed only his hands, then studied his reflection in the mirror. He was naked, of course, and wouldn’t dress for some time yet. He was still sticky with the mess of last night, and smelled of sex and come, sweat and musk. It was…pleasing. Tony will like it, he thought, and felt himself flush warm at that. Tony will wake and look at him, would smell and see the evidence of what they’d done and know that Steve belonged to him, and that thought sent a thrum of pleasure through his body, tightening loose muscles like a bowstring.
“Right around, ‘Put on the suit,’ I think,” Tony admitted, eyes narrowing a bit as his lips quirked up. “I should’ve just dropped trou right there, made Fury regret his good eye. Think of what we could’ve avoided,” he said, then cleared his throat. “Um, not to step on the moment, but speaking of avoiding, there’s a party upstairs that we aren’t going to be able to avoid for much longer, much as I would like to stay right here.”
He was surprised at how steady his voice sounded, when it felt like his whole body was on the verge of fraying into pieces, but the thing that was following so closely on his heels wanted him to move, and that was really all he could do.  Something with claws was squeezing his heart like it was one of those stress relief balls, the bright yellow kind with a happy face on it that distorted into a bloated rictus with each pump.
“You do?” Tony asked, voice pitched high, still eyeing him like he might bolt if Tony made any kind of sudden move.
Steve stumbled, his legs collapsing under him and sending him skidding into the hard-trampled dirt of the road beneath him. He panted, clutching his fist to his chest as if he could somehow slow the pounding of his heart.  He tried to suck in a breath, but it was wet and coppery with the blood that poured down his throat from his nose, making him choke and spit a wad of bloody saliva onto the dirt in front of him.
“At this time, we don’t feel we have enough to get a warrant that would require Mr. Stark to turn over proprietary technology,” Navy-Suited investigator explained, though he didn’t sound happy about it.
“U would probably spray your creepy robot stalker.  Or not, depending on the day,” Tony replied, tapping a finger at his lip.  “Dum-E could, you know, drop things.  Make him trip or something.   Like Home Alone, if Kevin MacAllister had all the strategic savvy of monkeys flinging poo.  Anyway, if you want scary automatons, we could just watch the Kardashians.  I could weaponize them.  The ‘bots, not the Kardashians. Though, come to think…”
Okay, I know it isn't a real update, but look!  Stripper!Steve!  No wonder Tony wanted to fake marry him.  Find more art and commission info at sgtjimbarnes.tumblr.com.  In the meantime, enjoy the beauty that is a mostly naked Steve Rogers.  Tony sure is.
“I’m not—I dropped out last year,” Dominic said.
“Well.  I was rather insistent,” Charles said with a light laugh.  “They were so very worried, you see. All the Alphas gone off to fight the Germans, and a whole generation of Omegas left without anyone.  What will we possibly do with Charles?  How they fretted.   Then, there’s this loud, brash American sending me letters and little gifts, asking to court me while I was mooning in my room and saving my pin money for a ticket to New York.  I think they were just trying to stay a tiny step ahead of me,” Charles admitted with a small quirk of his lips.
“Stane’s up to something.  Or he knows something,” Steve said.  His voice sounded raw, even to his own ears.
“Ambulance is family only, Mr. Stark, so your friends will have to meet you at the hospital,” one of the medics said as he shouldered his bag.
“Well, we—“ Tony started, then clamped his mouth shut.  Actually, they didn’t really do this.  Had they done this?  They’d eaten together at the Tower, sure.  Group meals when Tony could manage, or sometimes, Steve brought food down to the lab on the extremely rare—don’t listen to Steve on this---the extremely rare occasion when Tony forgot that lightheadedness wasn’t a natural state.  But they didn’t really do this kind of thing.  Whatever this kind of thing was.
And, of course, that same lovely, plump ass protruding obscenely out of a carefully-cut hole in the wall cushioned by the same black padding. The hole was spread wide around the same red plug from before, just like Steve had left him, and God, wasn’t that a beautiful sight? Like nothing outside of this room mattered. Maybe it didn’t. It was beautiful and comforting and insanely hot at the same time.
Tony trailed off, looking around for back-up, apparently, and finding the suite empty.  The elevator sounded again and the doors tried to slide shut, though stopped as they brushed against Tony’s outstretched arm.
“I haven’t blown anything up,” Tony said in greeting.  “Well, today.”
Drops of red in the snow, Steve thought, out of nowhere, though the blood didn’t look anything like that, not anymore.  Sighing, Steve tucked the rag away. He would likely need it later. It wasn’t as if the cough was getting better.  He picked up his tea and tipped it at the sketch in salute.
more than that, he qualified to himself. He wanted to talk to Tony about his robots, and Einstein-Rosen bridges, too, and be teased, and watch movies, and sit next to him on a droopy sofa that smelled vaguely like mothballs.  He wanted it all, but that seemed like asking way too much of the universe, so he would have to settle for what he could get.  He thought, even if he just got a little of Tony, that might be more than he would have ever thought possible.  Certainly, more than he deserved.
“How did you think I came to be there?” Steve asked.
“He’ll be good,” Howard said.  “Alexander’s a good man.  Don’t give me that look, now.  Nick trusts him.  As much as Nick trusts anyone,” Howard finished with a shrug.
“Everyone, please stop helping me,” Tony replied loudly.
“You wanted to be more than what everyone saw when they looked at you,” Stark said quietly, then brightened, as if a switch had been flicked.  “Let me guess, just a pretty face?  I get that.  You got the whole big, blond, perfect…everything going.  Probably could hear the hearts breaking in Brooklyn the day you signed up.”
“You keep your nose out of those books,” Steve warned, frowning.
“Apparently, I’m very insecure,” Tony said jovially, because he was pretty okay with that, considering the fix.
They went fishing.
The alien chanted lowly in his strange whalesong-dolphin-techno-birdsong language, but it sounded breathy now. Fluttery and light, like he, too, was deeply affected.  Tony’s body rocked with the hard pump of the alien’s hips. His hard, tight balls slapped against Tony’s ass, and Tony could only think that had to hurt, though the alien showed no sign of it as he drove into Tony’s hole with singular purpose.
It must have seemed like a godsend, a way out, and Tony knew, he knew, that Steve had dreams, too. Used to go to those stupid free lectures the college offered to the unwashed masses, even if he had no idea what they were about and hung out in the back, face half hidden under a baseball cap, as if he was worried someone would recognize him and tell him he didn't belong. Tony could have assured him that literally no one had even noticed their janitor, but the idea that someone like Steve was so devoid of interest for the student population at MIT was entirely too depressing to contemplate, so he'd kept quiet. How easy was it for Tony to sit in condemnation of a choice Steve made when Steve had spent most of his life not having much of a choice on anything?
doing breaking into my father’s study—well, my study now, seeing as how he managed to drive himself into a tree on a deserted road with zero traffic.  Can’t
Well, here goes nothing.
“Still mean it?” Tony asked, though he clearly knew the answer.  He liked hearing it, though, and Steve was happy to oblige.
.  It was what he did.
He looked down at the helmet in his hands, then raised his gaze up to the alien.  “So, I can go, huh?” Tony nodded to himself. “I can go, or I can stay, and you can give me this gift that you think will fix me. That’s the deal.”
Steve cleared his throat, figuring he might as well finish this now, one way or the other. “Yes, Tony.  I. Like. You.  I have for awhile, but you, well.  You never seemed interested in anything other than just friends, which is fine, really, I mean, I was ok with that, and you always seemed to have someone, so…but then, this morning.  You seemed…”  he wanted to say jealous, but couldn’t quite bring himself to make that assumption, not when Tony was still staring at him dumbly, mouth moving, but no sound coming out.
“Ah, yes, here,” Tony said, reaching around to the small table he had set near him and returning with a large goblet brimming with a dark, red liquid that smelled like the absolute most intoxicating mixture in the world.  “It’s pig, but it’s fresh.  You get used to it. Best to start out with it or you’ll just miss what you can’t have very often.”
“Soon, my beautiful one,” Tony promised. “One more.  Can you take one more for me?”
“Hi, Steve,” Ms. Potts said, pulling out her tablet and tapping at a few things before dropping it back into her bag.
“An ex-soldier and current starving artist who reads peer-reviewed journal articles for fun.  As one does,” Tony acknowledged with a teasing dip of his head. “Okay, sure, why not? And yes, text mining, social media analysis, all of that. Though, that’s really just the beginning.”
“You gotta go talk to him,” Rhodey said.
“I’ve given this a lot of thought—“ Steve started.
“Suppose I would,” Obie acknowledged after a staring contest that didn’t go his way.  He settled for another puff on his cigar and swig of Scotch as manly ways of blinking, Tony noticed, but it was what it was.  “Me—Howard, we’ve been over and over this.  We’re not saying…no. It’s Tony after all, and we all know he’s a bright kid.  Just trying to look out for the company here.  Not trying to tell you how to live your life,” Obie continued in a placating tone, drawing up his eyebrows and pulling an expression Tony recognized as the one that came before someone was about to tell someone else what to do in the most patronizing way possible.  Tony rolled his eyes and looked up at the Immovable Object standing next to him.  Well.  Good fucking luck with that, Obie.
“Jerry Lewis?” Steve repeated with a baffled frown.
“Hey, is my bot still back on the side of the road?” Tony asked.
He hadn’t, of course. Tony hadn’t said much of anything, though, looking back, the doctors were always the best, weren’t they?  The caretakers she hadn’t called nurses for a long time, who had long strings of letters by their names that Steve never really thought about, not then, anyway, when she greeted him warmly and pretended to know who he was.
, he texted back instead.
“I see,” Jarvis said.
All of a sudden, he was coming in long, white streams that coated Steve’s face and neck and spattered his chest.  Steve’s eyes snapped shut, and his body jolted in surprise.  It was dripping down his face.  Across his lips.  He could taste it.  Smell the salty bitterness of it.  When he blinked his eyes open, flecks of Tony’s seed sprayed off.  A rivulet of it ran down his neck, under his collar.  Another thick clump of it clung to his cheek.
“I need you, too, Tony. Every day.  Every minute.  I need you,” Steve husked out.  “See?  Not so opposite.”
Steve had a piece of the rippled pasta in his hand, trying to find his mouth with it, but ending up rubbing it against his nose, like it was a game of pin-the-pasta on the baby, when Clint walked in with plastic bags brimming with baby things.   Steve, apparently giving up on getting the pasta into his own mouth, tried to shove the piece into Tony’s ear instead.
“You’ve done so well for me, Steve,” Tony’s voice sounded somewhere from the other side of the rain. His tone was soft, thick with some emotion Steve couldn’t quite name, but it flowed over his skin like warm water.  “So good, my beautiful one. Look at you,” he said, his voice hitching as he took one of Steve’s hands in his own, stilling Steve’s motions. “That’s so good, Steve. You’re beautiful. Amazing. You did so good. You were absolutely wonderful for me, my dear one.  I never doubted you would be good for me, and the whole time, you were. You were
“The King summoned him?  When?” Steve asked, frowning.  He hadn’t slept through Zola’s visit, had he?  No, surely, he would have woken at that, but Tony had been dressed and long awake by the time Steve finally woke, and must have some sort of office or other, more formal meeting chamber than his private rooms.
Steve could feel the beat of Tony’s heart against the back of his hand as it slowly steadied into sleep. He opened his eyes and stared into the dark for a long time as Tony’s breaths evened and the sounds from camp slowly faded. He reached up and fiddled with his collar, rubbing his fingers over the metal until it warmed from his skin, feeling the sculpted ridges of the jewel that named him Tony’s. The wheel is turning, he thought, and it was a long time before he slept. If he dreamed, he didn’t remember it in the morning.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve replied.  “It will be good to catch up with James.  Always good to have an Air Force pilot around.  Hey, you know how you know there’s a pilot at a party?” Steve asked, tossing Tony a smirk before turning back to watch the approaching bus.   “He’ll tell you.”
“I—I want you to be happy here, Tony. I'm sorry,” Steve said again. “I should've been more clear. I'm—I'm told I have issues with communicating my feelings,” Steve continued with a grimace, obviously echoing someone's words. “You're—you're my Omega. I couldn't... I won't hurt you. I would never hurt you. Ever. I—I--This is your home, as much as its mine. You should be comfortable here. Happy,” Steve said. There's that word again, Tony thought. I don't think it means what you think it means, Tony mentally chided Steve.
“What do you want me to do?”
“These past few weeks, you---you’ve not been yourself.  Your mind is full of distress, I can see it as if you wore a mask,” Tony said.  His voice was warm and soft, not accusing, but troubled. Steve could hear the pain of worry underneath Tony’s words as clearly as Tony claimed to be able to see Steve’s own unease.  “Something troubles you, and you won’t let it go.  It eats away at you.  I’ve watched it happening before my eyes, and each day closer to our trip, it consumes more and more of you.  The truth is, you are so wound up with whatever preys on your mind, something was bound to happen, I only wondered what form it would finally take.”
God, he needed Steve to be home.  This whole plan had seemed like good fun an hour ago.  A bit of a tease for Steve.  Surprise, dear! Guess who made safe search his bitch?  So, yeah, fun.  Have a bit of a laugh.  Now, though…he wasn’t laughing.  He just wanted Steve.  Steve would take care of him.
“I can shower,” Tony protested.
“Noooooo,” Tony whined. Rhodey shot him a look, fingers hovering over the phone, sighed and set it down.
“Wait,” Tony husked out, sending Steve’s mind to a stuttering halt. He blinked down at him in confusion.  “Clint!” Tony called out, cocking his head and getting only silence in response.  “Just checking,” he said, a grin splitting his features.
“I’m sure he’ll come around, Tony,” Steve assured.  “After all, you convinced me it’s not at all creepy for you to buy the building I live in and the company I work for, so I’m sure you can convince him of most anything,” Steve said with a smile.
“—we gave them water and food, of course, but you should’ve seen them, arms in the air, kneeling down, just take me!  Anywhere but back to Iraq!” General Mini-Quiche laughed.  “I don’t think I’ve seen our boys as welcomed since a USO show.”
“Tony.  Wait,” Steve said quickly as Tony moved to get out of the bath, sending water sloshing over the side as he did.  He reached out and grabbed Tony’s arm, holding him there, though his touch was light.  Finally, Tony turned back to look at him, something like trepidation lining his face with a worry that shouldn’t be there.
“Oh, really?” Bucky replied, raising his eyebrows almost comically.
.  Obie, on his knees, pleading for his life.  Rumlow and Rollins dead before they could register what was happening. The rest of them, terrified and ready to run, save for the spears and swords of Steve’s people, forcing them to stay and face whatever hand the gods dealt them that day.
“Tell me what you need. Anything, Steve,” Tony urged. He was gripping Steve too tightly, fingers digging in, eyes almost manic. “Ask me. Let me.”
on it.  He’d tell Steve, without being asked.  He thought Steve would like this.  That this might please Steve, and the idea of that, pleasing Steve, sent an involuntary jolt of warmth low in his belly, making it tighten with heat.
It did feel odd.  Not bad-odd, just strange.  A burning pressure accompanied it that seemed to emanate from deep inside Steve, though that made no sense.   He felt Tony’s knuckles brush against the rim of his hole and realized that Tony has his whole finger inside of him.  A moment later, the pressure was gone and he was empty.  Oh.  Steve frowned.  He opened his mouth to say something, but then Tony was sliding his finger back in, harder this time, making Steve grunt and twist his hands into the blanket.
“I know,” Rhodey said.  “I know, Tony.  It really, really does.  I’m sorry.”
“Well, it isn’t as if no one will believe I got drunk and married a stripper, Pep,” Tony replied cheekily.
“You know I can do better.  Dad.  Come on.  You know I can,” Tony added. It was almost a plea.  As close to it as he could let himself get, touching his toe right to the line of setting himself up for disappointment without actually crossing it. Almost a plea, but the last one he would make.  He didn’t have to.  Not anymore.  He squeezed Steve’s hand back.
“You’re not, and it really isn’t,” Tony said under his breath.
To the side, Jarvis crawled out of the water, but stood there, half-in, half-out, clinging to the wooden rails of the ladder as if for support.  He was hunched over, shoulders shaking and head bowed all the way down to his chest.
He should've gotten a plant. Or flowers. Flowers would've been right. Flowers were things that Omegas did, right? Made arrangements that meant things. Red for love. Yellow for friendship. White for sympathy.
“It's just...I thought I was done having feelings about that,” Tony responded on a shaky breath that he couldn’t quite catch.  He closed his eyes for a moment and covered his face with his hands, then shook his head clear and dropped his arms to his sides.  “Jesus. Fuck.  You're Captain America.  The--the ice, and--and God, seventy years, Steve, fuck.  And now, you're telling me Howard didn't manage to slam them into tree all on his own, and
“Is that what you’re doing?” Fury asked, eyeing Steve with his disconcertingly constant gaze.  “What you did before?”
Steve turned to see Tony standing behind him, a small phone held in his hand where he’d obviously been tapping out a message, now forgotten.  Steve felt his throat go dry as his gaze raked over Tony.  He hadn’t realized how much he had just missed seeing him.  Of course, Tony looked amazing.  He always did, but the tuxedo Tony was wearing made Steve think of the night they’d met and images came to his mind unbidden.  He heard a car door slam loudly behind him and turned briefly to see Happy ensconced in the driver’s seat.
“Sorry,” Steve said, looking down at where his hands wrapped around his backpack.  “I’m—I know you’re trying, Tony.  I do.  I appreciate it.  I think,” Steve amended with a frown.  “I’m just not sure what to do with it.”
“That sounds fairly illegal,” Steve pointed out, raising his eyebrows skeptically.
“Like, Captain Kirk.  From Star Trek,” Steve said.
“Oh, good, there you are.  I thought I’d have to separate you two after the way you were making eyes at each other over breakfast,” Pepper said as she exited the suite’s elevator.
“Does he…know it’s for me?” Barnes asked, then let out a nervous laugh, gaze flicking to Steve.
“Hello,” Tony replied.  A part of him wanted to step behind Steve and bury his face in Steve’s back until all this was over.  A bigger part of him wanted to get inside that laboratory Kool-Aid Man-style.  So, there was that.
“For what’s left of my dignity’s sake—which, yes, I know we’re talking needing an electron microscope to see at this point--I’d like to hang my hat on like for the moment,” Tony replied.
“Howard!” Maria cut in sharply, her brows drawn together in clear disapproval.
“I thought you’d like it,” Steve said, glancing up at Tony long enough to catch his eye before letting his gaze dip to the floor again.
In his head, Tony could see the lines and lines of numbers.  The raw detection data the LIGO observatory spit out, waiting to be plotted and analyzed.
“The pizza one,” Tony added.
“Thank you,” Tony said softly.  “For the…you know.” He gave Steve a one-sided smile.
“What?” Steve barked, sitting up abruptly.
“Thank you,” Tony said, looking down at the piece of paper.  His voice was quiet, barely a whisper, but it was enough to stop Steve’s rambling, for which he sent a small prayer heavenward.  “Believe it or not,” Tony continued, clearing his throat and looking up at Steve, “this is the first time someone’s brought me flowers for a date.”
“You swore. You swore,” Steve ground out, voice raw with strain. “You won’t let me go.”
“I—yeah, of course.  I was the one who—I wanted to come here,” Tony stammered.  He had wanted to come here.  He wanted to be here.  He did.  It was just…why had he wanted to come here so badly?  That thread of thought, that need, floated at the end of a kite string he couldn’t quite catch.  When he tried to look at it, all he saw was bright, scorching his eyes until he had to look away.
He couldn’t let this matter.
A grand adventure.
“The Germans thought they were collaborators,” Steve said, closing his eyes as he remembered the scene.  One thing about a perfect memory.  The ghosts never fade.  “They’d given us a chicken a few days before.  One of their last.  And a loaf of bread.  A chicken and bread.  They hanged them all.  Even the little girl.  Gerda.  That was her name.  She was four.”
“Unseemly?” Steve said.
Distraction, he supposed.  If he couldn’t have everything he needed just now, he could have something he very much wanted.  Tony scrolled through his messages, deleting most of them that were not from Pepper, then did a quick internet search for their oh-so-cooperative judge, who obviously needed to be punished.
“I don’t know if I can lead the team, Tony,” Steve confessed, blinking and looking away for a moment before his gaze found Tony’s again.
“You’re not an idiot, Steve,” Bucky insisted in a quiet, firm voice.  “You’re a good person--best I’ve ever known, to tell you the truth.  You think the best of people, give them second and third chances.  Hell, we probably wouldn’t be friends if you didn’t.  But, you’re human, like the rest of us, and… Steve, this guy, he’s really, really good at getting in your head, okay?  He lies, he manipulates, he uses people until he doesn’t need them anymore.  It’s his M-O.  It was back in the Army, and he just kept right on at it when we got out.”
“Shhhh,” Tony soothed again from behind him, his warm hand splayed wide on Steve’s back. “I’m right here.”
Above him, the not-gel glowed and...he wanted to say breathed or pulsed, maybe, but that wasn’t quite right, either. But it had a look of something that had movement to it.  Some kind of--of nanotech, maybe? But far more advanced than even he had managed thus far. Which wasn’t exactly comforting, all things considered, he thought with a pained grimace.  But, the idea that it might be some version of nanotech was surprisingly comforting. Machines, technology...
“So, um,” Steve said after the silence started to lengthen into something that was approaching awkward.  “If someone leaves a bowl of Skittles out, as in, they are group Skittles, and then someone else decides to eat all the red and purple ones, which, I think we can all agree are the best, is it an appropriate punishment to remove all the marshmallows from said Skittle-thief’s Lucky Charms and just leave the cereal parts that no one likes or is that a toe over the line?”
“How…how did he make the shield then?” Cam questioned, eyes wide, hand hovering in front of his mouth where it held a forgotten piece of bread.
Okay then.  So, okay.  This was done, then.  He just had to accept that.  Whatever Tony was about with the money, it didn’t mean anything.  Probably just Tony’s sense of politeness or something.
“That’s your asshole dad talking, and you said I was supposed to throw something at your head when you did that,” Rhodey reminded him.  “Don’t make me have to chuck this plant at you.”
“Just...last night was kind of terrible,” Tony began rather begrudgingly.
“I like you like this, my treasure,” Tony said with a warm laugh in his voice. He placed a light, lingering kiss on Steve’s head.  “Let me get you cleaned up.  You need a bath, but we will save that for tomorrow.  Tonight, this will have to do.  You will not make it through a bath, and I cannot carry you back to bed.”
“I like you just fine,” Steve admitted carefully.  Tony was suspiciously quiet at that, though it was probably the narcotic finally kicking in.  “Now get some sleep.”
“Love you,” Steve said, leaning his head down to nuzzle at Tony’s neck.
It was the waiting that was going to do him in, he finally decided when exactly two minutes had ticked off the doomsday clock. He was too jittery with nerves to sit still for long, but moving around had the ridiculous sensation of somehow speeding time up along with him, and he couldn't bring himself to do that.
He was giving Tony a way out, one with those neon, arrow-shaped signs like Tony was a cartoon rabbit with an attitude, and normally, Tony would’ve taken it, but he was one foot into Wonderland, and there was a bottle labeled Drink Me sitting right there.  He had a garage with robots and the beginnings of a missile, pizza and theoretical astrophysics for dinner, and an Alpha who was…whatever Steve was.  Kind, his mind supplied, though he shied away from the label, which came with far too many expectations for the few days they’d spent together.  Just because he wanted something, didn’t mean that was the way things really were, and he knew from too many life lessons that he didn’t usually get what he wanted. He didn’t even want a kind Alpha.  He didn’t want an Alpha, period, not that anyone asked him.
Steve honestly wasn’t sure what to think.  He looked back at Happy, waiting nonchalantly by the car.  Bucky and Clint shrugged.
“Yeah, I’m getting that,” Tony replied.
“Yeah, I was---wait...maybe I'd stay longer?” Tony said, pulling back to look up at Steve in question. “Steve...why do you think we got divorced?” Tony asked, pulling at the words with a disjointed sense of unreality. Steve's whole face shut down, going carefully blank again, before he disentangled himself from Tony and pushed off the loveseat.
“Yes.  Please.  Please, I need to, please,” Steve gutted out, somehow finding the words, though it was as if they floated in some haze in his mind and he had to grab them before they disappeared.  His mind was a bright, blank space, like snow blanketing the fields back home where they met the mountains and all you could see was white.
“Fine,” Steve said, rolling his eyes.  He walked over and hooked his finger into Bucky’s.  “Promise. Happy?”
“Well, I take it you weren’t expecting company,” Tony observed mildly.
They had dined under a tent, lounging on huge, feather-filled pillows and a carpet woven of white lilies, with the fountain burbling in the background, as they traded a cup of wine and stories of their childhoods, so seemingly different and yet, each able to pick up the thread whenever the other’s story unwound.  All the while surrounded by great birds with long, sweeping tails of blues and greens that Steve could barely even comprehend, striped horses who grazed on the lawn and drank from the fountains, golden-crested monkeys that shouted at them from the treetops, and soft-coated deer with eyes like black orbs that took pieces of carrot from his hand.  All manner of creatures for the King’s amusement, Steve recalled with a bitter twist of his stomach, all safe and cared for behind the King’s walls.
Another knock at the door announced the arrival of a tray of food and pitcher of freshly-squeezed fruit juice.  Cam brought Steve a robe and slippers, and kept up a chatter of conversation--mostly about horses--while Steve ate and Tony dressed.  When he emerged, resplendent in his dark brown longcoat, red and gold sash studded with ornate, jeweled pins, breeches and crown, Steve found he couldn’t quite look away.
“Fine,” Steve replied tightly.  “I take it this isn’t a social call.  What do you want, Tony?”
“That’s by design,” Steve replied.
For musicalluna, who wanted Tony's POV from Chapter 7 after he realizes what happened with Steve.
His best chance of escape came with getting out of the city on Tony’s caravan to the desert, where a path to the sea and ships that sail it ran through the Red Mountains they would pass and a legion of guards didn’t stand between Steve and whatever it was that freedom meant.  He knew that.  And that meant he needed to stay by Tony’s side and in his good graces, but he could not deny that a part of him, perhaps a very large part, wanted to be with Tony for reasons he couldn’t quite name, but had little resemblance to strategy.  Nor could he deny that the reason he had resisted seeking Tony out sooner was more his own fear of why he was doing it than any true fear of what might come to pass if he did.
Steve looked down at him, his chest heaving, a line of blood dripping down his chest where Tyber’s spear had nicked him.  “I told you to get behind me.”
At the moment, Steve wasn’t even sure what he wanted from Tony.  Tony couldn’t fix him, even a Tony who...cared for him couldn’t fix him.  But, for the first time since he got out of the ice, the idea that he might be fixable, that there could be some way out of this (a way, away), had taken hold in the back of his mind like an anchor, keeping him steady, keeping him from foundering, when there were so many times he felt like he might.
“Promises, promises,” Steve warned lightly.  He walked back over to his sofa and picked up his sketchbook and charcoals, flipping to an unfinished drawing of Tony sitting at a cafe, sipping coffee, a memory from their trip to Paris. He started shading in the contours with the side of his pencil, then paused and looked up at Tony again, a soft smile forming.
“The city would have been overrun with Pierce’s troops before General May arrived with her cavalry were it not for Tony,” Steve heard himself say, then caught the teasing look leave Captain Rhodes face. They were joking, of course they were.  That was what soldiers did when thinking about the actual battle was enough to overwhelm.  They took the things that scared them and turned them into a jest.  He knew that.  He did.  But in his mind, Steve could see the bright flash of red and gold behind the line of Stark soldiers, and remembered the shock of disbelief and then the pit of dread that had welled up in his chest when he realized what he was seeing across the battlefield.  It hadn’t seemed real at the time, and yet, had been the most real thing he had ever seen.  He could almost feel it now, the terror mixed with a heady sort of hope, the way the battle had been pulled towards Tony, like he was some kind of beacon, and Steve supposed he was, at that.
He looked back  up. Tony was still watching him, though his face was softer now. Curious and open, almost like he was on the verge of saying something else before his expression shifted, and instead, it was, “You asked why I was doing this, and I never gave you an answer.”
“You can’t talk to him,” Tony said suddenly, pointing across the table.
Tony stared at Steve with the slowly forming horror of understanding.  In his head, he saw swirls of dark blues and greens that looked like nightmares.  Water, he thought.  Cold, dark water.  Ice.  Six months. God, Steve, Tony’s chest clenched.
“I—” Steve started, but Tony cut him off, his voice low, almost whispering to himself, in a way, as if trying to talk through a riddle he could not quite solve. “For as long as I remember, I just wanted to do what was right.  That’s all.  It’s—you make it sound more than it is, Tony.”
Beneath him, Tony felt the gel reform and lift his hips slightly.  It pumped harder at his cock, distracting him into a groan, and then the alien’s hand was back on Tony’s hole again, tugging slightly at the stretched rim in a way that burned with a pleasing sort of almost-pain.  Tony bit his lip, then felt a rush of calmness liquify his insides, and he relaxed. The alien wouldn’t hurt him. He knew that. He
“Whatever you call it, it blew our operation out of the water, but with Steve here, we at least had an excuse to keep tabs,” Clint said. “Plus, Nat put a bug in Steve’s shaving kit when she brought your stuff over, so we’ve been able to figure out what you knew and what you didn't know.  And make sure you stayed away from anything truly dangerous.  Er.  Well. Until today."
They made it off Clan land by nightfall.  Steve had no idea, of course, but Anto knew—Tony, he mentally corrected.  He was Tony now. A man of the Others. He tugged at Steve’s hand to stop for a moment, and Steve did, giving him a questioning look, but not demanding an answer.  Tony looked back for a long time. His entire life had been spent there, and he would never go back. Even if he did, they would not see him. Not even Jhrvis. He looked over at Steve, and reached out to take his hand.  He was Steve’s now, and Steve was his, linked somehow, in a way he only barely understood. Maybe a Mog-Ur could tell him, or maybe Jhrvis already had.
“Sure it is,” Steve said confidently.  “Have a little faith.  He can do it.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, voice shaking as he looked out over the valley below.  “I thought he wanted—with someone else, I mean.  But, he didn’t.  Or, he hasn’t.  He could, I guess, but—he didn’t.  It was just a long mission.  Because of hostages or something.  Not the, uh. Thing I thought,” Tony said with a wan, flat grimace.  “Yay for hostages?  God, I’m a terrible person, aren’t I?”
“What?  Don’t tell me you never did anything dangerously stupid in your misspent youth.  Besides the dangerously stupid thing we’re doing now, I mean,” Tony clarified with a huff of a laugh.
“You’re not the only one who learned he was a disappointment, Tony,” she said cryptically.  She left him there then, and took the bag of donated blood over to Bruce, who hooked it on the IV stand for later.  Tony tried to sit up, but a wave of dizziness and nausea hit, and he closed his eyes against the darkness creeping into the periphery of his vision.
“You saw my work?” Steve finally settled on, since that was the part of Stark’s spiel that jumped out.
“Coke or Pepsi?” Tony asked.
“Thanks,” Steve said drolly. “They took my shield. I want it back,” Steve mumbled, sounding adorably petulant about the whole thing. Tony clucked sympathetically.
“Ignore him,” Michael urged.  “He does it on purpose.  Kinky bastard likes it, don’t you?”
“He’s busy.  And I’m not that sick, I told you,” Tony said, then sneezed again and made a soft grunting sound as he tried to breath in through his stuffed-up nose.  “It’s just a cold.  Everyone gets colds.  He’ll go to Def Con 3 over it.”
“I mean, there’s no hurry.  I could…make coffee or…some sandwiches, if you’re hungry,” Steve offered, his chest tightening in something that he would’ve called panic in any other situation.
. “He did? He--he did?”
“Are those videos even real or something you put together to make this whole story stick?” the woman from CNN asked.
“He doesn’t really seem like the type of guy to scare easily,” Rhodey pointed out.  “Look, I’m not saying lay it all on the line over the dessert course, but, you know, feel him out.  Not that way.  I can hear the words forming in your head.  I mean, drop some hints.  ‘Hey, Steve, ever think about moving to California and being a kept man?’  That kind of thing.”
“Sometimes,” Steve said.  He realized he was still holding Tony’s wrist, making a circle over the skin on the underside with the pad of his thumb and let go, sliding his arm back across the table and busying himself with adjusting the cloth napkin in his lap.  The wine came, then, and the sommelier made a show of opening the bottle and pouring a taste for Tony, who drank it down without any of the usual aplomb and signaled for more.
“St—Steve,” Tony stammered, mindless, overcome.  It was too strange, too good, too much, and not nearly enough.  Steve pulled his mouth off, and smiled up at Tony. His hand came up from Tony’s hip and rolled the other nipple between his fingers, then flicked at it.  Tony jumped, then moaned as Steve’s mouth closed over the stinging peak. He suckled at it, sending shooting, throbbing bursts of bright, hot need down the length of Tony’s cock.  Tony’s flesh pebbled and burned. He was on fire. He was drowning. He didn’t know. This was Pleasures, surely. It must be what Steve meant.
“His lawyers are still saber-rattling, but it’s going nowhere,” Tony answered, looking down at his phone for no reason other than it provided a distraction.   “Showing up at a strip club is practically a rite of passage for a congressman, sure, but hanging out at one that caters to a gay crowd?  We’ve come a long way, baby, but not that far.  He’ll let the punch slide.”
“Frank’s a good guy, Tony, and what happened to his family is exactly why we’re doing this,” Steve replied.
Tony’s finger traced the circle of Steve’s rim, finding it still wet from his tongue.  The snick of the lube being opened cut through Steve’s thoughts. He forced himself not to tense up, but all he felt was the slow rub of Tony’s finger around his rim, now slick with lube.
“Evening, Mr. Stank,” Stan said, greeting him with a jaunty wave of Busty Beauties magazine.
“Bus. Pass,” Tony replied, slowly enunciating each word.
“’Cause you’d know all about that,” Steve replied, giving Tony a long look.
The familiar sounds of the city filtered in.  A distant train rumbling down its tracks.  Sirens.  A car horn blaring.  Someone’s radio thumping as they drove by with the windows down.  New York City was made of a strange, beautiful symphony of sounds unlike anyplace else in the world.  It was home.  Always had been.
,” Steve stammered, shaking his head from side to side.  He needed
“That’s not a no,” Tony pointed out.
“What’re ya doin’ oin d’bus?” the elderly man next to her asked, though it took Tony a second to decipher the mush of words.  It sounded like the man chewed them up and spat them out as he spoke.
He used Rhodes’ momentum, rolled into it instead of with it, and threw the smaller man off-balance, blocking the intended blow, then striking fast.  Rhodes grunted and went down, looking up at Steve from a crouch in surprise.  Steve backed off, waiting for Rhodes to stand again.  He did, this time with his jaw set and eyes blazing.  This time, there was no sluggishness easing into the attack.  Rhodes came fast and hard, managing to land a hard blow to Steve’s hip, but that was the only one he got.  Steve moved, fast, trusting his body to remember, and then Rhodes was on the ground, wheezing and holding a hand up.
“Yep,” Stark replied, all clipped tone and tight expression.
“This wasn’t your fault, Tony,” Steve said.  “You will not blame yourself for this.”
For most of his life, he’d wanted to be left alone, but alone had meant away from Howard and the laundry list of never-met expectations, away from the crawling feeling that started in his stomach and worked its way up his back whenever Obie visited, away from the constant need to get things right, all the damn time, which somehow felt worse than any consequence for failure could be.  Alone meant freedom. Safety.  Happiness.
“We won’t keep him,” Rhodey said quickly.  “Just need the paperwork.”
“What about SI?” Steve asked.
“Okay,” Steve said.  Somewhat tentatively, since he wasn’t exactly sure what Tony liked or even, really, what he was was supposed to be doing with his hands, he reached out and let his hands skate across Tony’s back and arms.  That was nice.  Tony seemed to agree.  He arched into the touch, like a cat, seeking more.  Taking that for permission, Steve let his hands roam where they wanted. Through Tony’s hair because he liked the feel of it, strangely intimate to be able to touch him there, and over his back and hips, then carefully lower to the supple curve of his ass again.
“What did you see?” Tony asked after a long moment. “I know it was something, and it sure as hell wasn’t what I saw, so say it. What did the stones show you?”
“Though, in retrospect, aren’t you thinking that it probably should have?” Tony asked with a grin, adjusting his red robe as he walked over to stand in front of Steve.  Tony reached up and adjusted Steve’s dog tags, slowly letting the metal chain slide through where his fingers hovered just above Steve’s skin, close enough to feel the heat, until the tags lay in Tony’s palm over the center of Steve’s chest.  Tony stared at his hand for a long moment, catching the way Steve’s throat bobbed like he was trying to swallow and having a hard time of it, fluttering beat of Steve’s pulse keeping up a staccato rhythm under the corded muscle of his neck.   Under his knuckles, he could feel Steve’s quick intake of breath, and watched in fascination as the skin dappled pink around his hand.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed out.  “Yeah, I think so.”
to come.  He was able, now, to be honest with himself about that.   He wanted to stay here, like this, with Tony for the rest of his life.  He wanted to wake up and make Tony smile. He wanted to feel the way Tony made him feel, like he was the most cherished person in the world.  He wanted to make Tony happy, to give him whatever it was that he wanted from Steve. He wanted all of that. But, not like this, Steve thought, swallowing thickly and dropping his eyes to Tony’s chest, though he could still feel the weight of Tony’s gaze on his skin.  He reached up and touched at his collar, watching Tony catch the motion. Not like this, he thought.
“I did?” Steve asked, surprise making his voice rise, though still sluggish and thick-tongued.  He frowned. “I don’t remember. I’m sorry if I disturbed your sleep.”
Leaning forward, he propped his elbows on his knees, let his head fall into his hands and rubbed at his temples.  There was a hollow, aching emptiness in the vicinity of the reactor that he was trying to ignore. It wasn’t that he hadn’t expected this, he’d just thought, maybe.  Hoped, he supposed. Hoped that the price he already paid for his sins was enough. Apparently not. Apparently, he got to keep hitting the You Fucked Up Meter for the rest of his life.  Ding, ding, we have a winner. Loser, he laughed, a bitter, acrid sound.
“JARVIS?” Steve called.
“You could have stopped it before Gulmira ever happened,” Steve said.
Now that they were past the awkward apology portion of the evening’s competition, he was insanely conscious of his words, the way he moved, the way he fucking breathed.  It was annoying as hell, but trying to make himself stop just made it worse.  Where was anxiety overriding everything else and sending you into a blind panic when you needed it?
"By handling it, you mean..." Rhodey asked, trading a look with Matt.
“Yeah, but...I mean, you said--very dramatically, by the way--that you went into cryosleep to ‘stave off the inevitable,’ right? If you were at death’s door, so to speak, when you went into cryo, why would you...did you plan to, ah, ‘share’ I guess we’re call it, was that the deal?” Tony asked, more curious than anything.
Steve smiled behind his veil, enjoying their easy banter.  He liked Bruce. Bruce was smart and, more importantly, he was kind, Steve thought.  Tony liked him, too, Steve could readily tell. Tony was...unguarded with Bruce the way he couldn’t seem to let himself be with a lot of people.   Steve didn’t know all of their shared history, not yet, but he knew they had known each other for years, and Tony had once helped Bruce when he ran afoul of some minor Lord in some kind of disturbance that apparently arose after General Ross forbade his daughter from accepting Bruce’s proposal. It was, Steve thought to himself as he looked up through the thick boughs of trees above to the pale, blue sky that peeked through, almost like Tony became someone else when he could manage to avoid the need to be who he was, as if a mask slipped off and the real Tony could be suddenly revealed.
“They were turning the whole thing into one of those wonderfully modern condominiums with plumbing that worked and cable TV you didn’t have to steal from the pub down the block.  Gentrification is a bitch,” Tony muttered.  “I couldn’t let that happen.”
“Like Captain Rogers said,” Coulson continued, ignore Tony’s jibe.  “You can pick which bedroom you’d prefer, since he hasn’t actually been up here other than to buy it.  I’ve had a number of necessities delivered.  You’ll find most of everything you need in the kitchen, I believe.”
Tony pulled the comforter up to cover Steve’s hips, then curled up next to him, winding one hand across his chest and burrowing into the crook of Steve’s arm that came up to wrap under Tony’s head.
“Don’t make me regret this,” Tony slurred, his eyes fluttering shut for a moment as relaxation washed over him.
“He wanted to talk.  When he got back from the mission.  About the MIT thing, I suppose, but…I could.  Then.  I guess,” Tony said with about as much enthusiasm for the idea as the condemned being fitted for a noose.
Steve studied him in the dark silence of the bedroom, then pulled him close, cupping Tony’s face in his hands.  Tony brought his hands up to circle Steve’s wrists, rubbing gently over the skin at his wrist as he did.  “Tony, however we have a family, that will be the perfect way,” Steve said quietly.  “Because it will be our way.”
“It was different, I told you,” Steve ground out.
“It was never about not trusting you, Steve.  I didn’t mean—look, when I said that—fuck.  You—you see the world how it should be, how it could be, if we’d all just—be better at it.  At this.  And we need that.
--not much there--
Also, maybe because of this, Tony thought with a small, wicked smile as his Alpha’s mouth found Tony’s entrance and his beard scraped over Tony’s sensitive rim. Sharing Pleasures meant a lot of things, Tony had learned, but he thought he might like this part the best, if only because Steve seemed to love it so much, worshiping Tony’s body with his mouth and tongue. The first time, Tony had been horrified, Tony remembered. At least at first. This had to be wrong. Had to be. No Alpha of the Clan would ever do this. Would ever think of doing this. But, Steve assured him it was something the Mother wanted them to do, since She would not make an act feel so wonderful and then deny it to her Children. Tony though the logic was sound enough, and the next time Steve used the Clan signal, when Tony dropped and presented, he was well rewarded.
“We,” Jarvis insisted firmly.  “Your mother included.  I know how you feel about her, but, she does care.  In her own way.”
“Rhodey,” Tony said in a low voice of warning.
“Technically, that’s probably what a deserter would say,” the King remarked idly.  Steve clamped his jaw together so hard he thought he could feel his teeth grind together and shot a glare at the King before he realized what he was doing.  The King grinned, wide and full, looking for all the world like he was delighted.  “God, you make it so easy to get a rise out of you.  And such a pleasure, too.  To get a
“That’s your CFO, Tony,” Pepper reminded him.
“He means that he showed up at Steve’s work with the chef from the Brindle Room and two sous chefs pushing carts of food, and nearly got Steve fired until they realized who Tony was and tried to get him to invest,” Barnes explained.
I cherish your comments and find them so motivating and inspiring.
“How fares the fair Jane?” Tony asked Thor.
“Do what?” Steve asked in confusion.
The creature regarded him, then smiled, a soft, almost wistful smile.  It could be so damn expressive at times. So human-like. And Steve knew well enough that it was smart.  Smarter than him, perhaps. Sam would probably agree with that assessment, Steve thought with a snort that turned into a laugh.   It cocked its head at him, then made a noise that Steve took for curiosity.
“Isn’t it still pouring out there? I swear I saw animals going two-by-two on my way in,” Tony remarked, realizing that he was agreeing when he’d meant to tell Michelangelo here he was leaving, painting or no. Apparently, he was quite that desperate, he thought as he stood up from the futon and walked over to the small window, easing carefully around the easel. Rivulets of water were running down the pane, though it didn’t look like quite the deluge it had been when he’d dashed from where he left the car on the side of the building. He didn’t want to leave, not yet, though he couldn’t quite grasp the why of that. It was just there, ridiculous as the situation was. Maybe it was the surreality of the whole thing that was keeping him, like he’d fallen into a story that he needed to finish.
“Sand fortification,” Steve corrected.
“Car’s out front, Boss,” Happy informed them.  “Sorry about all that.  I tried to talk to that woman about her security, but…” he shrugged with a ‘what can you do?’ expression.
Tony pushed himself off the sofa and stood, turning towards the hallway.  “Um.  There’s two more. After this.  Two more movies. I mean, technically, there are--basically two more. We could maybe watch those next,” Tony offered.
In retrospect, Tony felt he really should’ve been more specific with the universe.  Steve wasn’t going to die, but no one seemed ready to say if he was going to live yet.  Seven days of no response of any kind, not spontaneously, not to pain, not to anything.  Seven days of waiting and hoping and being disappointed over and over again until Tony honestly couldn’t say if he even felt anything other than numb to it at this point, like he’d slammed his hand in the car door over and over again until he wasn’t sure if he felt pain on the next slam or just the memory of it.
“You don’t know me,” Kirk replied, though his voice was strained and thin and he looked away, gazing towards the window that led to the fire escape for a long moment before dragging his eyes back to Steve. “You don’t know anything about me.”
“Yeah, it’s ok.  Sore.  It’ll be healed up by morning, most likely,” Steve said, shrugging, then remembering he really ought not do that when a sharp pain spiked through his shoulder.  “Itches a bit.”
“I laid out some things for tonight.  Special things,” Cam told him, bouncing along next to Steve as they walked back into the living area.  “He will be so pleased, and will not want to go anywhere without you.  You will see,” he repeated, sagely this time, with the absolute certainty of youth.
“Every day of the week and twice on Sundays,” Tony retorted.
“Too soon,” Tony muttered, but pressed Steve’s chest to the cool, soft bedsheet and nudged his knees apart. Steve obliged quickly, bending his knees and spreading them wide to give Tony access, maybe an invitation, he wasn’t entirely sure, just knew he wanted more of Tony’s touch, needed more of Tony, not the wild, insistent way of last night, but a deeper ache that started in his chest and moved down to the head of his cock and told him he wanted more. His body, at least, was responding just fine, he noted as a fresh rush of slick leaked out of his loosening hole. He could feel his body start to stretch, the muscles slacken as it readied him.
He woke, again, to light.  Familiar light, this time. The soft, pinkish glow filled the room. He sucked in a sharp breath that felt oddly deep and good as a tide of memories hit him.  He blinked, then immediately shoved some kind of weird blanket that had been placed on top of him off and grasped at his belly and looked down in shock. It was flat again, thank God. He must have...absorded the...whatever they were.  He wasn't sure if it was relief he felt, but he'd take it. His hands and eyes trailed up his chest, and he felt an instant of panic, drawing in another, harsh breath with a cry of alarm in it, his mouth dropping open in a gasp.
“You don’t need to hide,” Steve said with a flat, conciliatory sigh.  “It’s alright.”
“Maybe.  Maybe, one day.  Who knows?  If I—if
He wasn’t sure how much time passed while he lay there and let Tony hold him.  Dimly, he was aware that Tony was rocking him, just barely, but enough that he should feel silly, though he didn’t. The feeling was…different. Cherished. He curled into it without thinking about what he was doing and heard a pleasant, buzzing hum fill his ears and wash over his skin.  Finally, he felt Tony disentangle himself and  nudge Steve over enough to pull the blanket with its drying wet spots out from under him, before getting up.  There were noises.  A splash.  A soft, patting sound.  The padding of feet across the thick rug.  Tony returned with a basin of water in his lap and a soft cloth.  He lifted Steve’s head up enough to undo the clasp of the veil and pull it away, then dipped the cloth in the water and used it to wipe the mess away, first from Steve’s mouth and chin, then down his chest and over his stomach and groin.  He leaned over and reached up to run the back of his fingers down Steve’s cheek, along his jaw and down the column of his throat to settle on the collar that marked Steve as his.
Tony’s mouth fell open.  Steve’s thumb slid in, just the tip, just past Tony’s teeth to the point of his tongue.  The hand on the back of Tony’s neck tightened almost imperceptibly, but Tony felt it, deep and low inside and down to the head of his cock like it was connected by a puppet’s string to Steve’s hand.
Great.   DUM-E would probably lock down the garage now.  He and Steve were going to end up at the bottom of a well while U insisted it puts the oil cloth in the basket.
“He watches YouTube videos on how to dance.  I’m…having a hard time not finding that completely adorable,” Tony replied.  “Okay, anyway, Romotive is this start-up doing some kind of robotics research, mostly to do with applications that can integrate the robot with smartphones.  Kind of a cute, kitschy end user thing, but whatever. DUM-E’s code is probably more sophisticated, with the adaptive interface and—”
Hot, pulsing pressure was building low in Steve’s belly, thrumming with the pulling ache from his nipples and tight, pulsing heat filling his cock. The longer Tony regarded him, the more Steve was aware of it, all the earlier nervousness fading away under Tony’s gaze until he could do little more than just feel, everything and all of it at once, until it was almost too much.
“Okay,” Steve said after a long beat of silence.
“Sam sounds like a bright guy.  Believe it or not, I do understand.  Ask Rhodey.  Not the same as you, I know, but…going through the motions.  Isn’t that what they call it?  I don’t know what that means, but that seems right. Going through the motions,” Tony said, looking over at Steve.  “I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t think you do, either.  It’s harder for you, I know.  A lot harder.  I’m going to help.  We’ll get help, whatever help you need.  Therapy, surgery, a tiny Chinese woman to walk on your back, I don’t care, we’ll do it.”
“They think I’m involved in SI’s R&D division,” Tony said.
“Yeah, you should come with us,” Tony said slowly, enunciating every word carefully and tilting his head to the side, as Natasha’s narrowed gaze caught his.
“Of course.  You know I’ll take care of it, Tony,” Pepper promised.  “But what is…wait.  This is…this is the one who signed the restraining order?  And sealed your divorce records, right?”
He said he would tell her and no one else, because what choice was there?   It took nearly two days to get through her questions, but she had finally believed him.  She’d let him go back to the lab, the one where he’d appeared, but the pieces of Howard’s machine made no more sense to him than they had decades from then, or months ago, depending on how you looked at it.  Oh, he remembered what the final machine was supposed to look like. He had gotten them that far, but the intricacies of it, the delicate connections of this wire here, that part there, he was as clueless as the rest of the SHIELD techs who kept looking from Steve’s drawing to the carefully laid out pieces, as if a spark of inspiration would come along if they stared at it long enough.
, with Grand Central and the tunnels...like history meeting the future. Even the SI weaponry, there's an aesthetic there,” Steve countered, words almost tumbling over each other in a way that told Tony that Steve had given this thought before, considered it, Tony's things and their beauty, and that was...he didn't know that that was.
“I thought you might like to show our new friends a good time,” Ty suggested.  “I know how much you love that.  They’d really like that.  I’d like that, too. What do you say?  A little private celebration?  Just us.  You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Ty said, running his hand down Tony’s cheek and cupping his chin, tilting Tony’s head up to look at him.  “You’d like to do that for me, wouldn’t you, Tony?”
“Okay,” Tony replied and went back to making his action figure walk in large, lurching, plastic-legged steps across the floor in front of him.  “When my Dad finds him, you can give it back to him and tell him I fixed it.”
“Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so,” Bucky repeated, then groaned.  “He’s crazy about you, you know that, right?”
Steve winced.  It was always so hard for him to relax and let go, which made it hard on a partner, he knew, since it took forever to get him ready, and who wanted to spend half a night doing that? He hated that.  He hated that even with Tony, he couldn’t just...just fucking
“Yeah, but coming home on my guy’s birthday empty-handed, you thinking I
“Next time you ride with
It felt so good to touch him.  He hadn’t before, and now, he couldn’t imagine not. The feel of Tony in his hand was intoxicating.  Steve repeated the motion.  Then again, flicking his wrist around the head the way Tony had done to him, watching the King’s eyes widen and darken and feeling his cock twitch in Steve’s hand.
“You’re screwing with me,” Tony said sullenly.
“Guess you have job security for the other eight, then,” Tony said, wiping his mouth with the napkin.
“And, hey,” Mitchell said, raising his beer bottle and pointing it towards Steve before downing a long drink and leaning back in his chair.  “If it does, you can just see if Stark’ll give you a few thousand for a blowie or something.  Am I right?” he asked, slapping a hand at Griff’s hip as he edged back into his chair from his trip to the bathroom.
“This is just some stupid formality, Steve, keep your panties on, would you? They’re gonna say no, same as everyone else, and nothing in your little file there is going to change it,” Barnes ground out.
Tony’s tongue flicked over his mouth again, soft and sure, lips pressing lightly against his own, not a kiss, but not letting Steve go as he rocked through the last of his orgasm.  Tony murmured something into his mouth that was lost to the ringing in Steve’s ears, but he felt the cool air against his skin as Tony stood and went to a metal cabinet that stood against one wall.  Steve was still kneeling on the mat, covered in his own come and staring dazedly at the mess of a mirror when Tony returned.  Steve looked up at where Tony stood, cock still laying across the tails of his shirt, staining it with dark, wet streaks.   Steve opened his mouth to say something, maybe offer, though he wasn’t even sure what exactly. His mind had gone comfortably blank.
“Butter and egg man?” Tony repeated, giving Steve a baffled look.
“Perhaps I will be a friend to Peter?” Cam suggested. “I think I will, when he is older. I can teach him his letters, as I have learned. The King will want to see him well taught, I think.”
Steve sat down on the cot, keeping his expression carefully neutral.  He pushed the tattered blanket down and looked again at the wound he’d only gotten a quick look at earlier before deciding that wrapping it tightly would have to do until he found them some shelter.  Steve could see Tony’s eyes tracking his movements as he got the small pot of boiled snow and what passed for the cleanest strips of the lining of his uniform that he could find.  Steve dipped one of the strips into the warm water and tested it against the back of his wrist, then dabbed gently at Tony’s wound.  Tony let out a hiss of air, though he didn’t pull away again or otherwise object.
“I wish I could,” Steve replied.
“We could order a pizza,” Steve offered in a rush.  “Maybe try a movie.  I haven’t seen a lot of the new releases, so whatever you want,” he shrugged, frowning a bit as Tony’s face tightened.
“I was in the Army for four years after high school.  Got out last year.  Well, Reserves now, technically.  Two days a month while I’m in school,” Steve told him.  “My mom was sick.  She was at Brigham and Women’s, so I moved here. Started school.  Got a job waiting tables.  That’s about it.  Pretty boring.”
“Incredibly hot.  Don’t forget that. Did I mention that?” Nat cut in with a small smile.
“That’s the single stupidest thing I’ve ever heard in my life, and that includes every word Justin Hammer has ever spoken,” Tony said, dumbfounded.
“Just…do what he says, okay, son?  It’ll be easier if you just go along with it.  Don’t—don’t make this harder on yourself than it needs to be,” Howard admonished, though he wouldn’t look at Tony.  There was something lacing his voice that on anyone else, Tony would have called sorrow, but there was too much belligerent hope there, too.
“You weren’t wrong,” Steve replied softly after a beat of silence.  “What you said.  I didn’t much like how you said it, but…you had a point.”
“Don’t ask it of me,” Tony said.  He was staring at the wall, hands held still in the middle of tying the corded belt at his waist.  “Please.  Don’t ask it. I can’t.  They talked before, the Court, of course they did.  My past---I spent far too much time trying to be a ruin in my father’s eyes than I should have. It was forgotten, or forgiven, but now…now, they all seem to suddenly remember it. Already, the Court chatters about how much sway a concubine holds that he could bring down the Lord Chancellor.  That I rule with my—well, not my head, let’s say.   It would weaken me far too much, Steve, you must see that.  Power is not laws or wealth or armies or weapons, my soldier.  Those are its levers, true, but power…it is a matter of belief.
“Don’t be going daft now, you git, you only have a little bit left to go,” Steve told himself, shaking off his shirt and drying his hands on the cloth he used for the dishes.
Steve caught Tony’s eyes just at the edge of his gaze. Held it. Watched as his eyes darkened in the lamplight to little more than obsidian orbs. His own vision clouded. His jaw ached. The pain in his nipple was agonizing, but he willingly offered it to Tony. Pressure built in his cock, riding on endless waves that battered against the head, demanding a release that wasn’t his to allow.
“I—I just don’t want to mess up, Jarvis,” Tony said, rubbing a hand at the back of his head as he looked back towards the cabin.
“You’ll never see it coming,” Rhodey told him ominously.  The phone went dark and silent as Rhodey ended the call.  Tony shook his head to clear it, the smile fading away as he stared at the black screen.
“Plenty of better ways to raise the heartrate,” Tony retorted, then looked back over at Steve in the seat next to him. “So.  That went a little off-script back there.”
“He was, well, Rhodey and him, really, they were both sort of having a go at each other, but, you know, I—I thought it was nice. That you did that,” Tony stammered, hurrying to catch up to where Steve waited by the pole with a partially smashed plastic box displaying the bus routes.
Steve rolled his lips together to try to stave off the smile.  Didn’t work.
“Well, you’re blind, not deaf, dear,” Charles pointed out, making Tony cough to swallow a bark of laughter.   “Tony, I was thinking of taking a break. Would you like to accompany me?”
“Yeah.  Yeah,” Rhodes said after a long pause.  “I’m saying…nothing can prepare you for that.  It was something I’ll never be able to put behind me, not really.  I’ll carry it with me the rest of my days, those men, how they died, what I could have done differently, what was lost. But, it is what a soldier
They were all quiet for a while as they walked, each lost in a sea of their own thoughts.  Suddenly, Bruce made an excited sound as his hand darted for a vine-like plant that was clinging to the husk of a dead tree.
“Drink,” Tony told him, handing him a goblet of water.  Steve drank. It was good. He hadn’t realized how parched his throat was.  “You are so easy when you are like this,” Tony observed mildly. “Eat,” he insisted.  Steve opened his mouth. He saw Tony smile a bit at that, then he dutifully placed a piece of cheese into Steve’s mouth.  Steve chewed. That was good, too. Everything was good. He ate a bit more and drank the rest of the water.
Steve cuddled closer, the room silent, except for the hiss of the monitor.
After all, it wasn’t as if very much interesting ever happened to Steve.  At least, not so far. He hoped maybe one day it would, though, that seemed less and less likely all the time. There was the one time the barn cat over at Bucky’s place had kittens, and once, a travelling group of players came to town with a little monkey all dressed up in real clothes that did tricks if you gave it coins, but this man was far more interesting than even the monkey had been. Besides, just because he wasn’t as big as the other boys didn’t mean he was some scared weakling, and this was just a man, not a bear or a boar or some wild beast.  It was just a man, and they were just talking, and he could run anytime, if he had to.  Maybe waiting a bit would be good, anyway.  He needed to catch his breath, after all, which was still pulling a stitch into his side every other breath or so.
Dishsoap.  The thought floated through Tony’s head.  For the grease on my hands.
Steve shrugged off his robes, tossing them over the back of the chair where he had been sketching and toed off his shoes.  He stood for a moment with his back to Tony, bare, save for his golden collar gleaming at this throat and Tony’s signet ring on his finger. His skin was warm, his breaths coming slow and deep, the world seeming to shrink in on him, until it was just this room, just him, just Tony, yet still full and vibrantly wondrous.  The carpet under his feet was soft and plush. The air in the room warm, and he could smell the faint hint of the fresh flowers the servants spread about the room. The crackle of the fire sounded with a low, pleasant buzzing in his ears. He could feel the hairs on his skin rise, then settle. Everything seemed strangely clear, almost astoundingly so, and fuzzy at the edges at the same time. He had no explanation for the sensation, but reached for it like a drowning man searched for air.
“Apparently, there’s a video on here,” Steve said, picking up one of the iPads that sat by their plates while Tony frowned at it disdainfully.  “Supposed to walk us through the meal. Even has a live-feed of the kitchen.”  Tony supposed that had been part of the introduction he’d missed while trying not to curl into the fetal position.  Steve held the tablet up, then set it back down, apparently as uninterested in a narrated meal as Tony was.  “More a steak and potatoes kind of guy, to be honest,” Steve admitted with a slight frown.  “To new experiences, I guess,” Steve proposed, clinking his glass of water against where Tony’s sat on the table.
Brock was staring at the door as it slowly closed, probably still so shocked that he hadn’t even heard Steve.  “Brock?” Steve said.  “Hey.”
“Believe it or not, we actually considered that one,” Tony replied in a forced, light voice.  “I’m just going to…” he motioned for the door, walking somewhat gingerly around her. Whatever Everhart wanted, it probably wasn’t good, all things considered, he figured.
“Tony, what…tell me,” Steve implored. He reached out and tugged at Tony’s arm until he felt Tony’s body go slack and fall back onto the bed next to him.
“So, the next time, you didn’t wait for the cops,” Tony guessed.
“It doesn't have to be,” Tony heard himself say, the words coming out seemingly of their own volition. His mind was a couple of steps behind his mouth. Admittedly, not the first time for that.
“Well, I mean, it’s just theory, right, so.  That kind of thing, it’s probably hundreds of years off, if that,” Tony pointed out.  “We’re nowhere close.  Though—it is, of course, possible that if something like that did exist, we wouldn’t be the ones who created it.  Given the size of the universe, it isn’t just possible that intelligent life has arisen elsewhere, it’s likely.  Also, given the scale of distances and the energy involved in trying to traverse them, any advanced alien race that needed or wanted to expand beyond their local galaxy would need to create things like Einstein-Rosen bridges to get around, unless there is some law of physics we haven’t come across yet that would let them routinely not just break lightspeed, but wildly surpass it.  Getting around the universe is a bit like crossing Africa, the Pacific and Atlantic if you’re an ant.  Really going to need a better mode of transportation.”
That’s what this feeling was, Tony realized. Pride.  Self-worth.  Gratification.  He turned it over and over in his head as he slid into the back seat of the car next to Steve.  That felt…correct, but it was hard to wrap his head around it feeling right.
Anto opened his pack and took out the ptarmigan one of the hunters had caught in a spring-trap and held it up by its feet.  He had already plucked the feathers, since he wasn’t sure if the man would know how. “Gud,” Anto told him, holding out the bird for Steve to take.
Tony knew the answer he was supposed to give.  He tried to get it out of his throat, where it seemed to be hopelessly lodged, probably because his heart was stuck there, presently not letting air or anything else useful get through.
“Relationships are about compromise, Steve,” Tony reminded him astutely.
"Have to admit, I'll kind of miss it in a weird way," Tony replied with a slight shrug, his mouth twisting a bit ruefully as he glanced over at the strange being he was actually considering sharing a spaceship with.
Tony lifted his gaze and caught Steve’s. Held it.  Tony’s eyes were shining, dark, almost watery.  The fire, Steve told himself.   A trick of the light.  A strange tightness flickered across Tony’s face, then was gone.
“We’re...on our way to the Grand Canyon in your helicopter and you want to talk about how the military’s intelligence gathering is hampered by the digital divide?” Steve asked.
“Do I?  Is that what I know, Tony?  This wouldn’t even be an issue if you’d think about someone other than yourself for change.  We have thousands of employees.  Investors. Stockholders.  And you, off playing mechanic at SHIELD because your Alpha thinks it’s cute or something,” Howard scoffed.  “No, no, I’m sorry Captain, but it’s the truth.  SI would be the laughingstock of the industry if we let this be anything other than a vanity project for the newly Bonded.  Board won’t like it, but they’ll understand. They’ve all had new Omegas to break in.  It happens,” Howard finished with a commiserating shrug.
“Good Tony,” Tony mumbled, twisting his head to the side and closing his eyes against the onslaught of sensation.
“Sounds fun,” Steve said, trying to keep his face from pulling into a frown.
“Of course.  Many concubines travel with their households,” Tony said easily, seeming to relax at Steve’s obvious amazement.  “In fact, in a few months or so, I hope to make a journey to pay a visit on our army encampment to the East.  General Ross has been slow to embrace some of my newest inventions, and I think a demonstration is in order.  You will join me.  It will be good for you to get out of this place, see the countryside.  The Red Mountains are remarkably beautiful in their own way.  There are ancient figures carved into the stone around the base by some long-lost civilization.  Winged lions, warriors, a giant tortoise, even.  You will enjoy the diversion, I believe.”
“You didn’t say I was wrong, though,” Tony pointed out, then sneezed a succession of giant, body-wracking sneezes that nearly doubled him over.
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve smiled up at her.  He walked towards the punching bag, a feeling of warm giddiness still suffusing him, making him a bit lightheaded and tingly.  Tony had done something, something that carried with it an unspoken intention--if not exactly a
“I’m trying,” Tony replied with a sigh.
That had been easy enough, Steve thought.  Maybe there was some way to talk Tony out of this.  Just say nice things or whatever he could come up with that didn’t involve pointing out that different versions of himself had just fucked Tony every way possible.  Yeah.  Sure, easy enough.  How hard was it to dole out a few compliments? He’d seen Tony’s body before, anyway. Just flashes of skin, of course, nothing like this, but still, it was just a body. Same parts as Steve’s. No big deal. This wasn’t so different, really. Changing on the jet, in medical, when Tony didn’t want to stay and complained until they called Steve, that time they got whatever the inside of the alien bug thing was on them and had to strip down in quarantine and be hosed off.  So, really, this was just like any other mission.  Basically.  He could just…think of it like that.  A mission, like any other. Just one where Tony was sprawled out, all lithe, wiry muscle and beautiful tan planes of skin, clearly quite enjoying getting used in every way possible by his own mental variety of Steves.
"Now you may talk to me. Make it quick. I have things to do". Tony said then snapped his fingers at Clint.
“I have a lot of things to do today. Pepper will hang me if I left the place now, princess.” Tony said in an apologetic tone.
Steve who was sound asleep but woke up quickly when he heard the anger in his boyfriend’s voice. “I… What? huh?”.
"Good , don't have any , huh? Oh, we have priority you see, we experienced men" The old man winked at Steve.
“I’m coming over and breaking those fingers for you”. Tony got up from his spot with his cane.
"The inhaler, it….it makes me dizzy sometimes; it gets ok later, but first and always the dizziness". Steve said and rubbed at his head.
"Make it quick, I don't have all night,” Tony said as he let Clint in and then rubbed his head. “you need a shower. You stink". Tony said as he followed Clint in to the couch.
"Uh-huh, never got that rule. If you're giving a guy coffee, just give him coffee no need to have him counting the cups. And how come you aren't being you're annoying teen self on the phone? Is it Sam? Did he win the meme war? Because if you lost to Sam, then you're a disgrace on the Stark family name and you need to be put up for adoption." Tony said with a sly smile and a very graceful body move avoiding Bucky's arm and saving his coffee from spilling.
"Your kid is impossible! He's stubborn and he never does as told and and ahhhhhh" Bucky let out a hell of frustration.
“That was a mix up with pills that young doc gave me. Brucie came over and put them all in small separate containers, he even put the days on them.” Tony said then the bell to the store dingged and he turned his attention to the first customer of the day. It was always Bill the fella that buys minty gum. He sells houses or so he claims.
“What do you mean Bucky got shot!” Natasha yelled at Clint that was now being chocked by Tony. Pepper moved to Tony’s other side and tried to pull him off Clint.
Bucky let out a deep sigh. "You can suck all the air in the room. I will still not let you go in my Audi" Tony said ,as he tested the circuit he just created.
“Jay? Make sure he gets upstairs ok, and fix him with the screen that has the dots on it anytime he asks for it." Tony ordered and then looked at the dots on the screen and then back at his works station. "What's Daddy up to?"
"He says he'll consider it". Jarvis answered back then Added "but he is making his way towards the whisky".
"Then cut the heart meds, who needs them. Give me those damn pills". The old man yelled again.
"Something tells me that you're giving me your previous experiences. But no. She didn't catch me trying out the iron man suit. That's the thing, I did nothing we were texting, and everything was dandy and then this " he points at his phone.
"She's probably going to talk to you about that. And Bucky as soon as your Pa gets home. Me, you and him will have a long conversation about what you're allowed and not allowed to do with your phone and body. Don't think I don't know what you get up to at night alone in your room." Pepper said to Bucky when a loud "Ha" came from the corner.
"It... it is? Really? “Tony said as he moved to better fit Nat on his lap and then started to blink at her.
"I asked for a day of peace. You couldn't give me one day of peace. You had to pick a fight". Natasha reprimanded as she stood next to Clint and looked at his eye then swatted at his arm when she made sure the eye was ok. “This was supposed to be my wedding day and what did you do on my wedding day? You go and pick up a fight with the rival gang. Over what? What was so important that you had to fight on my wedding day?” Natasha fumed after hitting Clint some more.
Steve started talking again, noticing how upset Tony looked. “You know, he really needs to talk to that girl”.
“Brucie, Brucie needs to talk to that lovely girl. What was her name… something with a B..um.. Betty? Becky?” Steve said as he kept his mopping then stopped to scratch his head. “That was a kind girl, she sent us blue berry muffins remember those? Wednesday before last? Where did you keep them?” Steve frowned at Tony, then dropped his mop into his bucket, then place his hands on his hips.
“How much did he take this time?” The nice red head lady asked.
"Who's dumping who? Bucky? What's wrong honey?". Pepper looked concerned and then moved from the hallway she was standing in into her office. "Tell ma dear. What's going on".
"Please, come out of there".
“it belonged to Angelo, So he got upset ,and sent over some people with a bit of a temper on them,” Steve said while trying to avoid Pepper’s steely gaze.
“Did I miss it? Did he do the birthday song yet?” Thor started panting.
Clint was in his blue onesie and barrowing into Steve's side. It has been day 20 of Natasha's mission. Normally, Clint would have been Natasha’s right hand man. But the group already made him so his cover was blown. So She took Bucky for this mission.
"Huh; Well, the Name's Steve Rogers. I do not have a kid or a building to my name. But I do think that a kid dropping the last name is a bit too much of a rebellion streak" Steve said then looked at the papers the old man was altering.
Steve looked at the old man and was a bit upset. He was older but not old. "I'd rather wait".
"Yeah, wherever, tell anyone and I'll eat you and your pet bear". Tony said then made a face at Clint and started growling. Clint squealed and ran out of the lab.
"Master Tony is currently busy, Captain. Is this important?” Jarvis answered.
"And this is the part of the plan I need your aid in. We shall seek the closet under the pretense of us enjoying the...the....the game in which we hide and deduce our whereabouts by searching” Thor asked with a frown forgetting the name of the game he was using for the plan didn’t exactly sell the plan to his cousins.
"But Ma... Tony is lying" said Bucky as squirmed in his spot.
Steve moved Clint behind him and held up his arm out. “Tony! You can’t hit other people’s kids. Clint grab your candy and go out from the side door”. Clint did as told, while Steve started laughing as Tony’s leg was tangled on his chair.
"Uh huh, she says I can know because she might forget where she put things later. So I can help her remember, I help because I'm a big boy!” Bruce said cheerfully.
“Maybe we should get a different server. I mean.. No offence but you seem stressed.” Bruce pipped up after a while looking at Tony face and giving him a small encouraging smile.
As old man, Stark took his place at the cashier, Old man Rogers took his mop and started to clean the floors. “Stop mopping the floor. The damn dog will slip on it again” old man Stark grumbled.
"May I.. um..maybe?" Clint stuttered.
"This is painfully slow, Come down to the lab, we’ll talk. Chop chop". Tony said then hung up the phone.
“Please Daddy? Please? “Tony begged Steve, and then put on his puppy dog face.
“Huh! One minute and 30 seconds. You are the king of pushovers Steve. Come down here with my ice cream I have something I want to try out on you” Tony said and pointed at Steve.
"Ew , no , no blue pills , they'll mess with your heart medication" the pharmacist said to the old man.
