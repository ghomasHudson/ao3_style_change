"Why would there only be three?" Kali asked. "Obviously, there are four of you."
The rest of dinner was filled with fun conversation and getting to know their brother now that he seemed to be back in their lives. The room had been filled with more love than it had for a while. Afterward, they went back to the living room, watching another movie with the pups, entranced by their giggles as the baby dragons flew across the screen.
"But we have work to do here." Dean shrugged her off.
When she took on this case, she was told that it would be an easy slam dunk. Not only that, her clients would be insanely wealthy and could afford anything required of her. She thought it would be easy. Nothing she couldn't handle. If only they worked like the local police that she had to deal with. There was always something she could use to tear a story apart. It was not apparent here. They were also trained in what and how to say things in front of the court. They let nothing go, nothing she could use against them.
The two detectives suddenly stopped. They heard screaming coming from farther down the hall. It sounded child-like. They immediately pulled their guns out of their holsters as they continued down the hall. A woman came out of her apartment, surely going to tell someone to calm their children, when she saw Dean and Benny coming down the hall. Her eyes opened up wide in shock.
"And those documents were what convinced you that my clients were involved?"
"No, I am okay with it. I would love to spend time with them. It would also be easier if..." Cas stopped, a blush covering his face.
"I'm going to kill them," Amara muttered, walking past and into Singer's office.
"You sure about that?"
The group of five returned to the Impala and got into the same configuration as before. The ride back to the motel was quiet with light interrupting the darkness every so often. Back at the motel, the five got out and separated at their respective rooms and turning in for the night.
"I'm sorry. I had really planned on coming home, but we fell asleep."
"After that, he took us to the apartment," Christie told him. "He carried us in. We screamed, but no one came out to help us. He took us into the room and pushed us in, telling us to put the clothes on the bed. We did so to get out for our nightclothes. He closed the door and left us there."
"That didn't sound like he was fine."
The two handed over their IDs and watched as she scrutinized them while tapping into the computer every so often before handing them back.
"You don't have to say anything. Given the amount of crap you boys have been through, you deserve it. The house was foreclosed on anyways so that bank was selling it for pennies practically. You just have to keep up the payments, which should be easy with your cleared identities."
"Stop telling these lies, woman."
At this point, Emily had wandered her way in and heard the majority of the conversation. She stared at the child before nodding her head in determination. "I'm guessing that the child of an angel means lots of power to people. You know, if you wanted me to be a lot more cooperative, you could have just told me?"
"I guess. I thought they would have just given up. That's what I was expecting."
"No one wants to hear about it," Kali said, pulling Gabe's hands away from his ears. "No one cares about candy as much as you do. Accept it, and the truth will set free."
Cas continued, ignoring his brother's antics. "Well, their current case involves our parents."
Cas heard shuffling on the other end phone, with some back and forth conversation he couldn't understand before Gabe was back on the phone.
"I said bright ideas, not a stupid one."
Naomi and Zachariah continued walking down the hallway, but Castiel knew what was expected of him. He walked into a large room filled with many chairs facing a stage. He sat in a chair in the back corner, staying silent. He knew he was not to make a noise. He knew that the only reason he could leave was to go to the toilet. He was told that soiling himself would show Naomi and Zachariah in a bad light, which was not tolerated. He could still feel the pain in his bottom from the last transgression against the two: speaking out of turn in front of clients.
"I have a bad feeling about something."
"Excuse me?" Lucifer asked, not really believing what he heard.
In fact, there were no signs of a job. No demons, vampires, or any signs of the dead mysteriously coming to life. Absolutely nothing. After Cas took control of heaven and all the angels, there seem to be no major signs of the supernatural. There were small cases of restless spirits here and there, but nothing big. Either monsters were going into hiding or the police were not reporting the weird.
"There's no such thing as angels," John stated.
Castiel looked back in forth between his parents. He would believe they were staying these things to him. He didn't want an alpha. He wanted to go to school. He wanted to go outside and play in the garden. Of course, his parents didn't listen to him, no matter how much he begged and tried to run away. It just made them angrier.
"Yes, my true mate."
Celine placed the kettle in the middle of the counter before going to some cabinets behind her. She took out a jar of sugar and a container and put them on the surface before going back to grab a large selection of mugs. She opened the container and said, "Have at it." Feeling John's wariness for what she was offering, she turned toward him with a fake smile. "Don't worry. I bought these from the store. They're individually packaged and everything."
"What?" Sam worriedly asked.
"Where does he live? I would love to meet him as soon as possible."
"Why don't you just talk to her?" Dean asked.
"Thank you so much, officer, for getting my girl home. There's no telling what could have happened."
"That's kind of scary thought," Mary noted. "She's going to be very tricky."
"Let me see if I got this right? Demons want your baby, so they're going to try and find someone like Emily to get this child."
The alpha was about to say something else when he must have seen something in her eyes that told him not to continue messing with her before tucking his tail between his legs and running out of the area.
"What?" Lucifer demanded. "When?"
"That's a long story..." Dean started.
"I'm guessing this little missy, is the reason why we're here," Celine announced herself. The two men pacing slightly jumped, not noticing that she had walked in. "Although I must admit, I don't understand how a small baby has the forces of hell after her."
"I know; she tells me that all the time."
"It was cold," Cas simply said as he walked farther in with a confused look on his face, pointedly asking Dean what was going on.
"As long as Amara can handle him, I think we'll be fine."
"And if you didn't know it."
"Why do you suddenly care?" Cas asked.
"Yes. I am with my kindergarten class. Maddie and I were coming back from a trip to the bathroom when they grabbed us."
"Thanks, Bobby," Sam said not long before Bobby hung up. Tp Dean, he said, "well, this just got more difficult."
"You carry a jar of salt with you?" Dean asked in disbelief.
"And then you walked in," Cas said with a shy smile. "I was terrified, and then your smell didn't make it any better. I felt drawn to you, but I was scared if you were like those alphas I had met when I was younger."
"Yeah, apparently they've talked to everyone involved in the murders. Now, it's just going to be the final nail on the coffin as far as she's concerned."
"Anyone need anything because they sure aren't going to bring it," Michael asked.
"We might need to set that up," Dean said, giving a slight smile.
"How does someone tamper with medication anyway? Aren't heat suppressants solid?"
"That is strange, especially because of the dose that you're taking. Your prescription was last filled two months ago. Maybe they filled your prescription wrong?"
"The Novaks are known as a very philanthropic couple who have donated their money to several causes and political campaigns throughout the years. Many of those politicians have made no comments thus far about their involvement with the family. Still, they have sent word through their publicist that they will be kept abreast of the situation as more details become apparent. Lawyers for the Novaks have also stated that this is a severe overreach of power. They are trying to do their best to get their clients out of federal custody by any means possible.
"If you don't mind," Ms. Bellum said meekly. "I've been on the road all night trying to get back into town. I was on a business trip a couple of states over, and I didn't want to fly. I'm terrified of planes."
"You sure? You looked really deep in thought."
Amara
"What do you mean by 'different takes?'" John asked.
They pulled up to the run-down apartment complex. They walked up to the front desk, looking at the bored-looking landlord. Running up to him, they flashed their badges and asked, "What apartment does Donald Dunham live in?"
"I know, that's why I was asking around. Give me a dead body, and I know what to do. I have no clue how to handle this."
Zachariah looked on, fear clearly cemented on his face now, as he quickly shook his head no before looking down, unable to look the man in the eye.
Celine, sighed, as she turned the vehicle back on. "Deal."
"Nothing good. Are there cameras in this school?"
"Why aren't you more worried about this? You have a baby on the way. It's only a matter of time before he figures it out. What if Mom finds out and tells him. It'll be a lot worse than if you tell him yourself.
"Who's asking?"
This bill has upset many omegaist around the country. It has been the brunt of many campaigns to make Senator Worthington resign from office for his sexist views on omegas. Utah, a very conservative state, has many supporters of the bill across the state and from many socio-economic backgrounds. Time will tell if this bill goes through this time. The opposition has promised to go to the Supreme Court with their case if the bill goes through. This will be very telling in where the stance is on omega rights nationwide.
"Mr. Novak gave us homework to do," Sam informed the alphas as if Benny would know who that was. "He said that we would go over some of it in class tomorrow and finish over the weekend."
"Even if you meet the rest of my family? To them, I am the cursed one of the family, being an omega."
Cas pulled into the driveway when his phone incessantly when off. It had done so many times on the drive, but Cas refused to take his eyes off the road. Turning the engine off, Cas picked up the phone before getting out of the car and making sure Sam got out as well.
"You didn't have to come to find me; I'm an adult. I would have made my way back home eventually."
"I know. I wish my parents were still around."
"Okay, give me one second."
Sam and Dean had finished collecting the last of the pages and walked over toward them. We'll be getting out of your way now," Sam told Celine. "Sorry for taking over your shop."
"Yes, you have met one and seen some of the extent of her power."
"Let's just do this slowly. You can lean against the wall while we get out of here."
Dean looked around, looking to see how far away the children were. "He's Sam's teacher." At the smirk Amara gave him, he asked, "What?"
"You will never touch a single hair on these girl's heads," Emily said. Her voice came out emotionless.
"Can I help you?" a voice sounded from behind Dean.
Castiel and Mary walked toward her. The shop was empty except for the three of them. When they got close enough that she could see them out of her peripheral, she turned to face them. Good afternoon," she said with a large smile on her face. Her dark brown hair was tied up in an intricate braid keeping the majority of her hair out of her face and letting them see her shining green eyes, "Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. I should really get a bell for the door. Is there anything I can help you with?
At the point, Emily had come back with the gloves and knife Mary asked for and handed them to her. Looking up toward Celine, Mary asked: "Do you mind?"
"I know that you've been under a lot of stress with our parents," Lucifer tried to appease, "but there's no way our parents could have had anything to do with this."
This kept coming up. In all of the TV shows that Sam watched and books that he read, most of the characters who were his age were already able to shift. Dean tried to tell him that the actors were often older than they portrayed and that not everyone shifted at the same time. Sam never believed him, of course. What did he know?
Once at the doctor's office, she quickly shut off the engine before grabbing Castiel once again and running to the entrance, dragging the younger omega along with her. At the front desk, the receptionist gave her a weird look as she stepped out of breath.
John just shrugged it off and continued to eat. Cas was staring out into the distance until Dean shook his shoulder.
"What else could it possibly mean?"
"Nope, washed away with the rain the other night," Dean responded.
"How... did... you... know?"
"Hey, you," Dean called him over.
The woman looked down at the container in her hands, before looking back at him with an awkward smile. "Yes..."
The waiter looked toward John, seeing if this was what he wanted. He smiled and nodded toward the man. When the waiter left, Mary's face became more serious.
"I guess I have to go downstairs," Cas muttered as he tried to get off the bed. "Not like it is supposed to be a party for me. Let's make sure everyone's allowed to eat cake. That's all anyone here for anyways."
"We've known each other for a while. I'm sure there's nothing you could tell me that I don't already know."
"You said that I would make it out of here!"
"I was not asleep. I was... meditating."
"That's all I'm asking."
This time Sam did groan out loud. "Cas can explain it better," he states before slightly increasing his speed, wanting that conversation over and done with.
Charlie looked at them with shock clearly printed on her face. "Where did you get that info? I didn't see anything that would suggest that."
After a mutual agreement, the woman took their orders. Sam, of course, got the healthiest on the menu while everyone else got burgers with various toppings and fries along with cokes around the table.
"License and registration," the officer barked.
Mary ended up being the first one to talk.
"It's someone outside," Dean explained. "I'm going down now."
Cas breathed in the calming omega scent that was being released into the air. "I thought you wore blockers?" he softly asked.
"What's the plan?" Bobby asked.
Zachariah hopped into the driver's seat and started the car. He and Naomi carried on a conversation about their plans for the day. Castiel didn't pay attention. It was better that he didn't understand. He gazed out the car window, watching the trees pass by, wishing he was out there instead of the prison where he was stuck in. There hadn't been a sign for miles, but that was for the best. No one to come around snooping into business they didn't need to concern themselves with.
"But," she started, calming down once again, "demon deals give you ten years and the loss of your soul."
Dean soon leaned into his ear, worry tinting his voice. "Are you okay?"
The omega slowly made his way off back into the library. The alpha made sure to get his library card out for when the pup finished checking himself out. The two bagged their books up in the bags provided and made their way out, figuring out what they would do for the rest of the day, all the while Dean was floating on cloud nine.
Amara stood alone, the outside group, ensuring that the house was completely secured and all the lights were out before jumping onto the couch and wrapping herself into a bundle. She watched over the entire group and didn't sleep until everyone else as gone into a deep sleep. She thought about the many past lives she had lived, the number of different omegas she had been, how this is always what they worked for before going to sleep herself.
"I'll call Jody," Bobby announced. "Let her know that's she is going to have to put something in action soon. We'll all stay here; safety in numbers, especially if they get here earlier than expected. Workup the warding inside the house tonight, and if we have time, touch up the warding on the property."
Cas was quick to pull his arm away and turned toward the man. The man was about his height with an arrogant smirk on his face.
"I know," Gabe said. "It's great, isn't it!"
"If we leave now, we'll be able to search all night," she said. She started to rock on the balls of her feet, showing a bit of excitement.
"What do you mean, Alpha?"
"Whatcha' thinking about, babe?" Dean asks him.
Agreeing, Dean started the car. He turned around and told the two pups to buckle themselves in. The two quickly followed his instruction, and he put the car in reverse, quickly leaving the parking lot.
Sebastian just gave her a smirk. "Loyalty. It's hard to find that nowadays."
"It summoning spell," Castiel informed her, as a sheet of paper was passed over to her. "The ingredients are common; it is the instructions that must be followed exactly for it to work."
"Not tell me it's because of that woman. I'll have you know that I can probably take better care of you than her."
Emily moved passed them continuing on her way, Mary stood there, staring into space.
"Great, you two wouldn't know anyone willing to babysit Friday?"
"Alright," Dean answered in between sips.
"I would have been happy never speaking to them ever, but Amara was adamant that I help."
Cas looked around, noticing the gazes he was getting from the rest of the waiting room. "Amara," he whispered, "can you calm down? You're making a scene."
"How long has it been?" she asked him.
"Probably upset over the fact they've been teaching me to take over for them for the last couple of months," Michael shrugged with a slight smirk on his face."
Sam tried to keep his sigh to himself at his brother's antics.
"We are not naming the pup Amara," Dean called over his shoulder as he set Castiel on the couch by the other omegas.
Ms. Harvelle stood up, straighten her blazer before moving to face the jury. "Thank you, your honor. Throughout this trial, we will prove to you the Novaks' involvement in human trafficking through testimony from several FBI agents working this case and the many connected cases such as several murders. We will also present the physical and digital evidence that links this couple to all of those crimes. We will prove that they are connected and in charge of many of the crimes carried out while paying others to get the job done. When we are done, we hope that you would find them guilty of all their crimes so that they can finally be put to justice after all these years of committing horrific crimes. Thank you."
Emily turned around, hoping to see someone else in the large room. "Are you talking to me?" she asked, trying to see something in the darkness of the room.
"No clue about what?" Lucifer asked her.
"Honestly, I have no clue. I've been waiting for him for months, and he's giving me a shot."
"It was the demon. He was dying, Mary. I couldn't let him die, so I made a deal. My life, for Dean's."
"That's quite fine, Mr. Winchester. You indicated that you would need after-school care. We would prefer if you could be here at the latest of 5:30. If you cannot make sure of it, be sure to call ahead."
"A disruption was felt in Heaven. None of my brothers or sisters know what happened. I must go help figure it out."
"Your honor, how can we really be sure of Agent Bellum's capabilities since she, as the court can see, is an omega that pretends to be an alpha and is clearly not an effective omega. May I remind this court that in the state of Utah, omegas past the age of thirty-five who have not been mated, nor in a long-term serious relationship, can not be seen as capable of something of this magnitude? I'm sure that you remember Markus v. Franks, in which Franks was found unable to carry on his duties due to his omega status."
"It is a shortened version of my name," Cas responded. "My name is Castiel."
"You know I'll keep you safe, right?" Dean asked warily.
"And you didn't tell me this before?" Lucifer yelled.
"As the agent in charge, your honor, I was wondering her thoughts on Agent Haschum, who in her own words took over the homicide component on this case. Since this witness will only testify on the human trafficking component, it is necessary to establish her trust of the future evidence that will be brought to light."
Watching Castiel complete blanch, Mary answered for him, feeling protective of him already.
"Our next steps were to bring in different agents into separate undercover operations to infiltrate different aspects of the operation. It was somewhat successful."
Dean slightly finished making dinner. He wished he could spend more time with his little brother, but he was stressed by work, moving into the house. Things that would take his mind from blue eyes. To himself, he promised that he and Sam would have a fantastic weekend together since he wasn't going to be on call.
"How did you know?" he asked. It still surprised her how deep his voice is.
"No. They haven't even spoken since we got them."
Unfortunately for him, Mary wasn't most people and wasn't buying it. She let him know that with a raised eyebrow. Instead of questioning him further, she walked over the men's section, knowing the John would follow her. She didn't ask him what he wanted; she just went with what she knew was typical hunter wear. After seeing what both of her sons and Bobby were wearing, she knew that the uniform had not changed in the thirty-odd years since her last hunt.
"Okay..." Dean stretched out.
"I'm sure they still are. I hope at least I taught them right."
"Do you want to try and run that by me again?" John asked while stepping closer to Sam.
"I am sorry for your loss," Cas said, turning around.
"Feel better, babe," Dean said, pecking Cas on his forehead before leaving.
"Sure thing, kiddo. Just let me finish dinner."
"This is going to be a long, drawn-out trial, and everyone should be prepared for the emotional fallout from it all."
"There are only three officially published arcs. Two more came out online. Some chick whose screen name was... Becky Winchester some-number uploaded them, saying she was dating the author and found the rest of the series on his computer and uploaded them when he disappeared. The writing style was completely the same, so the entire community accepted them as the lost arcs."
"Hold up, Charlie...," Lucifer interrupted. "Did you say Uriel?"
"Maybe?" John practically yelled.
The pup looked up and found his brother's eyes. He put the book into his bookbag and ran over to his brother, colliding with his legs.
"Or else what?"
"Hi, I'm Dean. Did he hurt you at all?"
"Nope," Cas answered, putting the phone in Dean's pocket as they went to get in the elevator.
Gabe had walked up behind them, shock still on his face, trying to absorb all of the information.
"Well, I told you that Sam might have been taken out of my class if we did so, so we decided that it might be best not to do so."
It was much later after the pups went to bed that Dean got around to telling Cas the story he heard earlier that day. The omega was contemplative about what he heard. It couldn't be possible.
Sam stood to the side and allowed the two in. Closing the door, Sam led them to the living room where Dean was now pacing with Emma in his arms.
"We figured we let you have the spotlight," Kali informed them. "At least until we can plan your baby shower, and don't think you're going to get out of it. You're getting a baby shower whether you like it or not. We are going to celebrate, and you're going to like it."
"I am an adult," Cas grumbled, "and can make my own decisions."
"John looked farther in front of him to see Sam and Dean standing up. It seemed whatever pushed him back had pushed them all. Looking back, he saw Mary also standing.
"I know, but they have a family. Don't you want them to go to them?"
"We accidentally fell asleep while we were talking," Dean shrugged off.
"Also, I'm going to need all the photos from your belly. Those are my demands, or I'm showing up."
"Yeah, but he's my baby brother. I would do anything for the pup."
"Hey, my parents used to say that," Emily said with fake cheer.
"Hey, man," Dean told the other alpha.
"Not necessarily. Not that we would be able to tell. But someone would."
"What are you doing here?" Dean asked.
"I was just wondering, who's your favorite character?"
"I... do not... know."
"Now that Cassie's smell has permeated the house, the wolf feels more comfortable. You haven't officially become a unit, but the pup knows what's going on, at least internally."
"If we wanted to know," Cas replied, "I could easily find out."
"Cas, they don't know what you are," Dean said. At that, Cas turned around, almost looking offended, which clarified with, "We didn't know they were really them or not."
"Are you ready?" Amara asked excitedly.
She had been dead. There should have been memories of her raising her children and being y her husband's side. Where there should have been memories, there was a blur, as if it was all a dream. She had been in heaven, she suspected, except it wasn't filled with angels with white wings and halos and fluffy clouds. Heaven was those precious moments with her family.
"Amara!" Dean and Castiel exclaimed in exasperation.
"So," she started, "when are we heading out?"
Pam brought her hand closer to her nose and took a couple of sniffs. "Smells like cough syrup. The seal was wrong. It's supposed to be smooth at the line instead of having a bigger end and a smaller one. These pills have been tampered with. We'll need to call people about how this happened."
"You're an omega?" Dean asked her with surprise.
"How are you doing, buddy?" Dean asked him.
It was a lost cause. Cas was sure the boy wasn't listening, and if he was, he surely didn't believe him as he was stacking all the books he had from his beanbag area and started putting them in his bag. Cas let out a soft sigh before shaking his head and looking at the two alphas.
Soon enough, but not soon enough in Sam's opinion, they arrived at the store. There was a closed sign on the door, but after pushing on the door, they realized that it was unlocked. They all walked in the store the door and up to the counter. Emily was at the counter, reading a book with supplies in front of her. When she saw then approach from the corner of her eye, she greeted them.
"Not now. I wanna see Cassie first."
Before John was able to retort, Mary asked "Why do you think it's not a nest of vampires or djinns? I thought that the victims were found without blood?"
"You're also starting to show, by the way."
The fight fell out of Sam. "No.....," he muttered under his breath with a pitiful look on his face.
"If you think that I'm not going to go with you, you've sadly been mistaken," the young mother said.
Dan sighed. "I knew my life would become complicated the moment I met you."
"Not on their own. We continued looking into the corporations they had set up and even sent more agents in to investigate those corporations. Some even got jobs so that we could completely understand the structure of such entities. We didn't take the documents solely at face value. I assure you, we thoroughly investigated every single piece of evidence we received."
"Hello, little one. My name is Mr. Novak. What's your name?"
"I can have a couple of agents show up within the next couple of days. We know this started in Utah, but it has spread so much farther. At times, we're still not sure," Amara said. "Other than my partner on this case, I know the most. Give me a couple of days to get things together, and then I'll be there."
"I'm to assume that you're here to ask Cassie some questions."
"So you had no clue what you were signing. You would just give whoever it was approved to do whatever it was. Who would be the person you would sign off on doing everything?"
"Gross."
Daemon was doing all she could to dismantle each testimony. Still, with the overwhelming amount of evidence, it was much harder. If anything, she tried to put the entire crime onto someone else, which Dean noted as interesting. Before then, Michael had barely been a footnote in the course of the trial but had suddenly gotten a front-page feature. Daemon continuously asked about Micheal's ongoings during all of these interactions. They did nothing but confirm that he was there for some of it. Beside him, he could see Cas slide down in his seat, hiding from view, while Lucifer clenched his fist in anger. If Dean looked behind him, he would have seen the devastating look covering Gabe's face and the calming hand Kali laid on his shoulder.
"Why do you need a babysitter?" a voice came from behind the two. Turning around, they saw Charlie standing there while files in her hands.
Dean and Celine instantly took this as a good sign. They immediately caught up with the girl, with everyone else quickly following. She still had a blank expression on her face but kept moving as if they weren't there.
"Just wait."
Cas was still standing there, thinking about why she would wink at him when he hears exclamations of "Surprise!" coming out of the hallway. Apparently, there were no trouble makers to pick up. That must have been it.
"And you will. I just need you to let the woman go."
"We believe that a partner was unknowingly helping until they figured out what was going on," Mary clued them in. "They sent the book here hoping to find help."
The omega gave him a stern look. "That's not very healthy. Especially with your job."
"Dean. He said we could do anything today, and I chose to come here. I'm glad I did. I like listening to you read."
"Fine," he mumbled under his breath at a volume everyone could hear.
"What about you and Mom?" Dean asked.
Before Dean could explain that the precious cargo was their baby, Sam started to loudly snicker and Bobby shook his head with a smirk on his face. Dean decided to let Cas have this one. There would be plenty of time to correct him.
"Why am I alive? Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it, but I'm confused."
"Johnny?" Dean asked.
"In my experience, that's not true. Guess the world changed when I wasn't paying attention, too focused on revenge. Really did make me blind."
It was almost as if a bomb went off.
By this point, Sam had already found Dean by the gym doors. He saw him and Mr. Novak talking. It seemed like an important conversation to him. Dean looked sad at first, but then he looked really happy. In fact, Mr. Novak was also smiling. Sam noticed that he was smelling a bit weird today. When he asked, Mr. Novak said it was adult things that he wouldn't understand. He hated when adults did that. He's really smart for his age. Seeing that the two men were happy now, Sam ran over to his brother and crashed into his legs.
"We need to meet and come up with another plan."
They quickly nodded. Dean then remembered the uncuffed perp in the other room. "Wait here for a second," he told them.
It was bright and early when they crossed the state border. Dean pulled into a rest top space, and Bobby did the same in a space over. Everyone got out of their respective vehicles, the humans stretching out their locked up joints from being in the car for so long.
"Cassie, shush," Gabe urged his brother. "Everything about candy sparks joy and happiness."
Sam took the pages out of the table and looked at them. "I don't understand what the observations mean. It seems more like a coded message."
Dean gave a playful glare but all he got was a gummy smile. He gently removed Emma's hand from his mouth as she gently grabbed his ear and giggled excitedly.
"Amara came over. Took me to the doctor. They told me..."
"Probably not. Plausible deniability and all that. Don't worry yourself about it."
"Yes, anything."
"Yes, her ability of foresight has been both a blessing and a curse."
They all stood around the dining room table, listening to Sam, Christie, and Steve watching some movie that Lucifer had set up for them on the television. They were introduced by the movie colors and were given snacks to keep them occupied for a while.
"Detective Winchester," Ms. Baud spoke up. "May I talk to you outside?
"You could have called or something, so I knew you were okay."
Sam looked up at the sound of his name before continuing his trek to the front door.
Dean looked between the two of them for another moment before continuing. "It's probably best if we got going then." He awkwardly stood up and made his way over to behind Cas.
Soon after, the people in the area were dispersing. Beside him, Dean felt Sam move from beside him. Looking up, he saw the pup running toward his teacher.
"I don't understand what was so important about the weather," Cas told Gabe.
He immediately turned around and walked toward the stairs. Everyone could hear when he got to the creaky floorboard in front of the stairs before he made no sounds.
"Let everyone go?"
Emily hopped out of her seat. She went to the back and brought out a couple of books, clothes, herbs, and measuring supplies. It took her three goes before she had everything she felt she needed. She spread the supplies out and stacked the books on top of each other. She opened up the top book up to a page and went to work.
"They were," Sam said. "There were no teeth marks or excessive tearing to hide teeth marks. Also, there were track marks down the arm. This could mean that it could have been a djinn, but they usually prefer clean blood. I think the coroner was going to do more a more in-depth tox-screen to see if there would have been drugs in their system."
Castiel looked at his phone, making sure he typed in the correct number before putting it back to his ear. "Really, Gabriel?"
Dean looked back at the old T-shirts that he lent them. They were a bit small for him, but they swallowed the children.
"Hello, Sam. How are you today?" Mr. Novak responded.
Cas just looked at him with a tiny smirk.
"Which you won't do, right?
Cas looked back and forth across the courtroom. It felt that it was packed with people: the jury, journalists, lawyers, and the variety of supporters his parents had seemed to have, no matter how awful things seemed to be going. Even though they were in the packed room, they had an air of snobbery, as if being here was beneath them, and they had better things to do. He was just happy that there was a daycare run by the building, so the children would not have to hear what would be said. Christie and Steve were quick to welcome Sam when they dropped him off, but he could not find Amara anywhere in the room.
"Didn't want to risk my eyes," she explained before skipping out of the kitchen.
Bobby nodded in agreement. "Pack a bag. We leave in ten minutes."
"Now?" he heard Mary question behind him before her footsteps were following him.
"We just talked," Dean was quick to say. Amara gave him a stern look with a raised eyebrow before he continued. "Okay, we smelled each other, but I promise I had him home before curfew."
"Thanks for your help...," Dean tightly said.
The girl was slightly surprised that the five people in front of her weren't seething in anger at her. Well, one looked especially angry, but he didn't say anything.
"It looks like a lot of fun. Why are there a bunch of restaurants?"
"I may or may not have activated tracking spell that targets a token that I gave each one of the girls in case this happened."
"I would say people love and hate your parents. It's pretty equal on both sides."
"Are you free Friday?"
"Children are said to be more perceptive," Bobby said.
"It's been two weeks," Cas sighed.
Dean could tell that John was about to go off the rails, so he halts what he was going to be a long, unwanted conversation later.
The next workday, Dean was still on cloud nine. He practically floated into the precinct that Monday morning. He said "hello" to Samandriel as he walked by his desk. He jogged his way up the stairs to his floor and skirted to his desk. He was logging into his computer when Benny was walking to his station.
"I would like to submit evidence A.3 to the court," Harvelle paused her questioning. "Are these the bank statements you were talking about?"
There was a couple of seconds before the sound of a door slamming open, and Chief Singer walked out, grumbling under his breath. "This is a place of work. Why are you yelling?"
"Honestly, I don't know. The two weren't really on the best of terms after you were born. Mom died then, but Dad... Dad probably went on to remember the good times they had. Honestly, anything could happen, and I would prepare for anything."
"For the next month or so, we will be continuing to work with other agencies to finalize all of the charges and make sure that each of the defendants' constitutional rights is ahead. I imagine this will be a long and strenuous process. Still, we ask for everyone's patience while our justice system does its work.
"Riley?" Celine asked. The child looked up at her mother before continuing. "How did you get down here?"
John hesitantly made his way back to the basement, closely followed by Bobby as Sam, Dean, and Cas made their way upstairs. Sam entered his room first after saying goodnight to the couple.
"To me, it looks like you do not think I can do my job properly just because I'm an omega. I can assure you that is not the case."
"You guys were looking for me?" Dean asked Sam as the pup pressed his face into his brother's shoulders. While the pup wasn't paying attention, Dean made sure to lower the screen so no one could see what was on it.
"We're just about to leave, Bobby," Sam said as both he and Dean stood up and walked away.
"What the fuck...?" John started. He couldn't place what he was gonna say.
"Totally understand. I still would be if I could."
"Are you sure that you can know, ma'am? I mean, you are testifying, right."
"I mean, we can't stay in town for long. What if someone notices me? I'm sure you also haven't been in town for a while and people are going to ask how you still look young. And I really would like to see our children... if they are still around."
"What do you want, idjits?"
"Stuff to cover all of the furniture with something," Gabe muttered. "Already to added to this list."
"I don't want to," a croaky voice responded.
Matthew had started shaking nearly uncontrollably. Looking between the doorway, Dean, and a window that was to the right of him. He slowly started to put the gun down when something outside the window caught his eye.
"I didn't want her to worry about it."
The next morning, Dean was woken up by his little brother shaking him awake.
"So, Amara, what brings you here to our humble abode?" Dean asked.
The demon took a step forward the get into her face again when Celine's hand open, and he flinched back in pain as salt flew into his face. "You'll pay for that, bitch."
Mary gave them a soft smile. "We'll get out. I hear a bed calling my name as well. Call us later when you wake up." Mary gave her sons kisses on the cheeks and cooed over her granddaughter before heading out.
"I was just asking him about that. Apparently angels like the combination with different taste buds and everything."
I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. You're the only one I know who can help.
"But, there's something else there. Did anything else happen last night?"
Cas took a while to start. "As I said before, my parents are quite religious. They were also very traditional in their ways. They were both alphas, and when I finally presented at eleven, let's just say they were displeased.
Dean sided stepped toward the person closest to him in the room. Matthew closely watched the detective, keeping the woman in between them. Dean stood in front of the man who was sitting and ushered him toward the door. Glancing between the detective and the man with the gun, he slowly stood up and ran out of the room, heading straight to Benny, who was still standing outside. Matthew's eyes never left Dean's as he made his way getting everyone else out so that there were only three of them in the room.
"Oohhh. Yeah, she doesn't like for people to know her name," Emily shrugged off. "Got to respect her wishes."
"Cas," Sam interrupted. "Can't you fly us all there?"
"Oh, don't be like that. I'm sure we would be more comfortable speaking inside."
"Children, children, calm down," Michael said, getting in between them.
Castiel kept sitting staring into the void. Dean sat directly on his side, waiting for him to say anything. "I should call Luci. He'll want to know. Do you think he'll be willing to pick up the kids tonight?" Dean headbutted him in the arm before he continued. "I want to go home."
Steve thought about it for a moment and hopped out. Christie followed soon after. As soon as he closed the door behind them, the pups quickly grabbed his hands. 'At least they aren't hanging off of my legs,' Dean thought to himself. He escorted them into the school and down the halls on the path he had used so often. Getting to the gymnasium doors, he took a deep breath and opened the doors.
"Flying?" Bobby asked.
"Now, tell me where those girls are and which one I want."
"You cried over a door?" Bobby asked incredulously.
"It's something that came up while I was undercover. I think we all should know about it."
"What if it doesn't?"
Lucifer nodded before lowering his voice more. "Benny and Dean finally got dumb and dumber to talk a little while ago. Finally got all the info they needed. To get the murder charges dropped, they gave the address of the place they were supposed to take you. Turns out they were hired to do the crap job they did."
"Yeah, there's someone here for him."
Pressing the record button, Dean started the interview.
Sam gave her one of his patented bitch-faces before doing an about-face and going to shower. The sound of high pitched giggling followed after him.
Instead of answering the question, the officer closed her eyes and when they opened again, they were pitch black. "Now, I want information about the angel."
"Coffee, I ran out. You're such a good neighbor."
"What do you mean?" Cas asked this time.
"What did Ms. Harvelle tell you?"
"I'm thinking less vampire and more djinn," Sean stated while covering them back up. Before he could even blink, Sam had his phone out and was calling Bobby. As soon as the older man had picked up, Sam put the phone on speaker.
Looking back over the dead spots, Dean realized that they weren't random, as if something was half-hazardly thrown around. The clear, distinct shape of a wolf's paw was etched into the ground.
"Okay, I'll be here for a while."
Mary reached out to grab the bottom of the box, resting it on her arms. It wasn't heavy but there was some weight to it.
"It's not nice to break into someone's house," Christie spoke next.
"Who...?"
"How about we get you guys out of here?" he asked them, trying to change the subject.
"Crying. We have to figure out a way out of here," Emily frantically said as she tried to find a weakness in the door she could exploit.
"I'm sure it's not that bad," Dean replied, while on the inside, his heart was breaking.
"If you're really that worried, I'll take Castiel with me."
After a couple of minutes of Sam deciding where to put his painting, Sam went back to his backpack and pulled a big book out.
"Seriously, Castiel, this quite unbecoming of someone of our stature."
"I don't want to," Dean replied. "Not unless you give me no other choice."
"Oh, stop complaining. It'll come right up," Amara retorted. "See... it's already coming up."
"At least there's that. I think Riley knows what's going on. She refused to go to sleep until really early in the morning. I think she couldn't keep herself up any longer."
"That was very rude of them," Mary said.
Cas took a moment to think about it before saying wonderingly. "The new moon did just happen."
He expected to hear the harsh screaming of his parents and a slap across his face. Instead, he felt himself being shaken.
"Host was taking too long to get here," Lucifer said, voice slightly muffled by the mouthful of cake. "Should have come down earlier. We waited long enough."
"Are you ladies going to continue arguing about this or are you going to find a job?" Bobby said, interrupting the conversation.
"What do you mean by that?"
"What happened to school?" Benny asked Dean.
"They... they... Don't let them take me!" he screamed into Dean's chest.
Walking back into the room, Sam noticed Mary still staring at Dean and Cas. She had a soft smile on her face and a light practically shining in her eye.
"You're doing laundry," Abbadon scoffed. "Don't you have your own bitch to do that for you? Already falling from grace."
"He's a detective," Cas piped up.
"Getting arrested," he sniffed. "Drunk driving, they said."
Cas wrapped his finger around the pup's, giving a little shake, before letting him get back to eating. The two sat in a comfortable silence for a while when the doorbell rang.
"What do you mean 'I liven twenty-three years without you'?"
"Now, now, Castiel, you've caused us quite enough trouble," Zachariah, disappointed, said.
"We found out that Castiel's medication was tampered with," Amara said with a professional tone. "Thus, rendering his heat suppressants completely useless. This would have been two months ago when he last got his medication filled. Once you stop taking heat suppressants, it takes about a month for your body to reregulate your cycle. Two days before Cas went heat, there was the attempted kidnapping attempt. For this reason, I only have reason to believe that the Novaks were somehow connected in the tampering."
"We? Who's we?"
"How?" Mary asked her. "It sounds like you have a plan."
"What's the plan?" John asked.
"I'm starving," a voice called from the inside. "I don't know about you, but my stomach has been growling for a while."
"What if everyone else makes fun of me? I can't shift yet," Sam said dejectedly.
The demon looked back and forth between the group of hunters and the girl in front of him. Seeing his only option currently was to leave, John's body stiffened and fell as a cloud of black smoke came out of his mouth. Instead of immediately going, it stayed. The group of hunters had never seen this happen before. It was almost as if it was trapped where it was.
"Emily," she meekly said.
"So, you really don't understand what's going on," John questioned Dan.
"Except for when you make a deal with a demon to get it," Dean muttered under his breath, but loud enough for everyone to hear it.
"I hate you," he simply replied, returning her fist bump.
"No, but I will be."
"Where's Johnny?" the young boy asked.
Well, it was a peaceful morning until the sound of the doorbell rang. Dean stayed in bed, hoping that whoever it was would realize it was way too early for a Saturday to be going to people's doors. It was silent for a bit before whoever it was started to incessantly ring the bell.
Emily was looking at the top of the cage. The openings looked just about wide enough that she could squeeze through when a heavy metal door opened behind her. Turning around, she was a tall man who looked much stronger than her giving her a smile.
"You never know when you need it," she said teasingly.
"We did. I was miked, and the warehouse where we were scheduled to meet was wired and had cameras filling the room. Everything was in working order leading up to the meet, but it all went haywire as soon as our contact arrived. I was notified afterward that those listening in the vans could not see or hear anything that occurred in the warehouse. The information we left with as all we had."
Mary was about to continue searching when a familiar voice was heard behind her.
"I know," Dean softly cooed, looking over to where Sam was intently reading a book and not noticing his brother had walked in. "But it has been a couple of months. Do you think he should know? He's a lot more settled than he was before."
John grabbed the fake license that he made and the registration that came with the vehicle and gave it to the officer.
"What about the book?" Charlie asked. "I think we need to find the book."
"You little brat! After everything we've done for you!"
"Is anyone else injured?" the cop who seemed to be in charge asked everyone else.
"Nothing per-say. I just don't know how you'll react," Cas said, turning toward the alpha.
Mary held the feather up to her oldest son and recognition filled her eyes.
"We took you in! We didn't even have to!"
"No," he replied, giving her a smile that usually disarmed witnesses. "Just got lost in thought."
"Seems like it," Sam said. "These bullets haven't failed us with other witches."
Ever since Castiel took over Heaven after Team Free Will, as they called themselves, defeated Raphael, the world seemed to be a quieter place. There were fewer and fewer signs of demonic activity as time went on. Bobby didn't know if it was due to new management upstairs or if Crowley had better command of his demons. Either way, he wasn't going to complain about it. What he was going to complain about were the intruders setting up camp in his house.
"Well, this spell is contradicting itself," Celine starts. "Three different phases of the moon are brought up in the instructions, yet the spell can only occur during the new moon. Several flowers are brought up, which have vastly different meanings, yet at the same time, you can take things out, and the functionality of the final spell doesn't change.
"It's the best idea we have so far," Sam told the group.
"Okay? Why does Dean look sick?"
"This is no one's business outside of this room. No one's business but us."
The group followed the girl when she got to the door to the stairs. She then seemed to tilt her head at it before it flew off the henges with a massive bang. They continued as she made her way down the stairs and did the same to the second level door. She continued down the hallway while the hunters, angel, and witch looked at her.
The drive to the precinct was long and quiet. The only thing breaking the silence was the occasional sniffle. The drive wouldn't be long or short enough.
Mary felt her stomach drop again. Here she is, getting information from an unbiased source, yet her suspicions were confirmed.
"If you're sure," he worriedly said.
"Are you talking about this alpha you've decided to live with? Probably thankful he doesn't have to deal with the child by himself," Naomi chuckled under her breath. "I don't know what I would have done without our staff."
"Is that all? I have to finish the laundry."
Soon, the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs filled the room, and Lucifer turned to see Dean walking into the room.
"What are you talking about?" Dean asked her completely confused.
"Cas, where the hell are you?" he spoke into the phone.
"You remember my brother, who I was telling you about?"
"Yes, I was one of the many agents that had an undercover role in this operation."
"And Auntie Amara?" Steve continued.
Judge Morris stared at her for a minute before realizing she was done. "Alright then. The jury will now be sequestered while there determine the findings on each charge. We will reconvene when that is decided. Baliff, please escort the jury out."
"Why were you yelling?" the pup asked as he came further into the room.
Cas looked at his mate with a blank look on his face. He didn't know what to do with this information.
"Before I pup feels comfortable shifting, they feel they needed to be very close to family," Lucifer calmly responded. "Usually, that would include your parents, but... Anyway, for Sam's wolf, he knew that his family wasn't here. He acted out, trying to get the full attention that he needed.
"Sounds like a best-selling teen adventure novel," Emily replied. "Let me guess, she discovers that her true family was the friends she made along the way."
"But I want her here... with us."
"I was talking to random people online one day, and they were descriving something weird that happened in their two that sounded really similar to what I read. Sure enough, I looked it up, saw the suspects were to men named Sam and Dean Winchester. I just put it down as someone basing a book series on real events, but then I looked at the publishing date. The book was published long before the real-life events. I looked more into it, and the same thing kept happening when I would look into the events."
"As I said earlier, we tracked everything to do with the money coming in and out of the accounts. Again, we had no clue who would be found on the other end as we continuously dug deeper into the information we gather. I handed the information over to the techs as they dug deeper into the information. Over and over again, they would get back to me with documents that had the Novaks' name on it."
After a few minutes of looking it over, Celine seemed to wince. "Are you sure this is the only one?"
It was a smooth way home with hardly any traffic on the roads. The sun was starting to set as they pulled into the driveway. Sam was quick to leave both his seat and the car to get to the front door. He was bouncing in front of it as Dean was locking the Impala. As soon as he made it to unlock the door, Sam bolted into the kitchen. Dean unset the alarm and followed after his brother, wondering what he was so excited for. He found the pup with his bookbag on the table, digging through it. He found a folder before taking out a single piece of paper. Holding it toward him, Dean saw that it was the painting the pup did earlier in the day. Although it wasn't too clear, you could tell that it was a wooded area.
Celine sighed, letting it go for now.
"Now, you may proceed with your questioning. I will be in the room the entire time. I have determined that the two of them should stay together. If I feel like a question would be too traumatic for the children, I will ask that you move onto another question. I will not have these children be put through more than they already have. Do I make myself clear?
"No, you're not," Cas sleepily uttered. "I can smell you." Emphasizing the statement with a deep inhale.
"Got it," Dean called out before shutting the door behind him.
"It doesn't really matter," Dean interrupted. "We'll know in a bit."
"You're right," Kali agreed with Sam. "I thought I trained him better, but it seems that I still have work to do. Do you mind us coming in?"
Picking up the phone, the woman sad: If you gentlemen would wait a moment, I'll ring him right up."
The woman looked between them somewhat skeptically. "I don't know if I should."
"They haven't even gotten to any of the supposed evidence against us. There's nothing to really say yet."
After thinking about it for a few seconds, Dean responded: "Absolutely none."
"It's really mean to wake people up on the weekend," Sam spoke up.
"I showed you my ID. How can you not believe me?" Amara said.
"Now, now, son," the man talked next. "We have much to discuss."
The sound of a grumbling stomach erupted from the center of the room. Cas looked down to his stomach, still utterly surprised by his need to eat. Ever since he had conceived, he had become overwhelmed with human desires. It also felt strange for his grace to be slowly taken by another source but not have his grace try to reject the intrusion.
"I would say so since there is probably only one person who has access to it. From my end, I really can't do anything more."
"Why?"
"Nothing as big as this."
"I'm going to be the only one that's working here. We're still pretty spread out because of all the places this could go. I'll be the main point of contact for everyone else. Amara will do the best she can, but she shouldn't be seen most of the time. She already has a cover in the operation, and we don't want to blow it. She said that she would be here in a bit after taking care of a couple of things. Said she needed to get like a week's worth of stuff for some reason.
Turning toward Castiel, "You with your trench coat and suit that doesn't really fit. I thought nothing of it last night, but you're wearing the exact same thing. You didn't even change the tie, which my way, is seriously messed up. Then there was your absurdly deep voice. It sounds like you garbled glass. And then there was the way you knew all those languages. Sure, someone could be able to read one or two, but not as many as you were able to identify."
"Cassie, is there something you need to tell me?"
"So, that's flying?" Mary asked. "I hate it."
"Me neither. We were always told we were adopted as babies."
If one dared to look at Daemon during the testimony, one would see the look of disdain seeping deep into her face. As she looked at her watch, she noted the day was going by quickly. It would probably be another day before she would get a chance to tear this testimony apart. It was already a bust trying to tear the stupid omega's story apart. How anyone would have trusted anything the bitch said was beyond her. The beta was more annoying. The jury liked her. Destroying her testimony would be nearly impossible. She, thinking about it, squeezed the bridge nose in anger.
Amara looked up with a smirk. "It's always nice to meet a fan. Never realized that the old stories were continued on. Honestly, thought it died out.
"I think I just threw up a little," Celine mentioned. "Why would she need a partner though?"
Everyone left the room, while she got to work, working on the case she heard them get earlier, she assumed. She was nearly done when the angel, Castiel she remembered, came back it, heading directly for the fridge. She watched him pull out a carton of ice cream and a jar of pickles. He was already grabbed a spoon and was digging into both before he noticed her standing there. Instead of continuing, he stood there staring at her with ice cream smudges on his cheeks.
John looked between all of them before looking back at Castiel. "Don't think this is over." He turned on his heel and went back to the house.
It was getting late, and there was no way anyone would be able to sleep knowing that "John" and "Mary" were walking around the home.
"Steve's been asking questions about their mom. I don't know what to tell him. Christie also leaves the room when he asks questions."
Over the last couple of weeks, the omega had been getting more comfortable in his presence. He still wasn't letting the alpha into reaching distance, but it was enough at this point.
"Hey," he non-committedly said.
"Fuck off, pig," was the response.
"What do you mean?" Sam asked.
"Gabe, I don't need..."
"I thought we agreed that it was a witch?" Mary mentioned.
"Alright, we'll go and get food now." The three cheered, and Dean chuckled at them. "See you tomorrow, Cas," he said to the teacher with a wave.
"You're a mechanic and we live at a scrapyard. I'm pretty sure that you can figure it out," Mary said, patting his cheek as she stood up.
"Yep," Sam and Dean said together.
"They're more like shadows than anything feasible," Celine answered. "She is still trying to figure out was is on this plane and what isn't. I would have been so confused, had I met a supernatural creature when I was that young."
"Just got paperwork for you to sign and a couple of things to give you," the woman said, tossing a set of keys toward Dean.
"I have no clue who I'm looking for. I mean, do you have a picture or something?"
"Ms. Harvelle?" Morris inquired.
"Yes, I did, and I refuse to acknowledge it."
"Apparently fans of the books like to get them tattooed on themselves," Dean spoke up. "Makes our jobs easier."
"Don't be like that, babe. You know they're doing this for you. Just think about all the free stuff we're going to get."
"Are you thinking witch?" Dean said, already shuddering at having to deal with those sons of bitches.
"Based on their reactions, I would assume that you are talking about the Winchester Gospel. They did not like it when they found out."
Jody sighed. "Any chance people have died?" she asked, already with a grimace on her face, fearing she already knew that answer.
Dean contemplated for a while before saying, "like the first day of spring after the first storm." Had Dean been looking down, he would have noticed the large blush spreading across the omega's face. "Also, there's crayon, but I'm guessing that's from all the time you spend with children. What do I smell like to you?"
"If I didn't know any better, I would think you're stalking me."
"What makes you think that?"
"Just think of your favorite memories. It helps some times."
Behind him, he heard footsteps come up to him and stand beside him. He didn't turn, knowing who it was.
"You say that, but you have to realize that no one believes that except for you."
"I don't know. Getting coffee like you did yesterday," John retorted.
"I told you, little dude, I'm showing you two of my favorite guys," Charlie said as she set the box down. "I think we'll start with Mario. It's a fast game for a novice to pick up."
"And you? What have you been doing?"
"Hey!" Sam yelled. "Why don't you pick on someone your own size?"
"Right," Amara said, looking at the clock before tilting her head in thought. "Well, I would say it's too early to really prepare a big breakfast anyways. He might just want some fruit. Do you still have some?"
The ride to the school was quiet other than the soft melody coming from the speakers. It was relatively late, so they didn't have to drive through rush hour traffic. Soon after, they reached the school and pulled into a parking space near the front. Dean quickly turned the engine and got out. He opened the back door and ushered for the pups to come out.
"How is this possible?" she thought. "I was just spending time with my husband and sons."
The sky was pitch black by the time they had arrived. The only light was from the full moon shining from above. The breeze was slowly starting to pick up. People were milling around that area, but none that stood around for too long.
"Crowley?" Mary asked, raking her brain for where she heard that name before. "He's the king of hell, right? Never thought I'd hear something like that before."
"I don't have time for this," Lucifer said, brushing past her. "I'm here for my brother." At the end of the statement, Lucifer was filling in the doorway with his bitter smell coming out in waves.
"Yes," Dean awkwardly said after a bit.
"You didn't come back to bed, Dean," Cas bluntly stated.
"Emma is too sweet to do anything," Sam retorted.
"It might not be pharmaceuticals itself. It could use be someone, maybe those two idiots, who know a person. I don't know how many degrees of freedom we might be dealing with. Ask and see if they'll flip. If they do, that's one degree closer to closing this case. For all we know, they were hired, and no nothing, but it's something."
Castiel quickly opened his eyes to the weight that he felt curled into his side. He turned his head and saw Dean still sleeping off the terrible night he had. Recalling what happened caused him to become extremely distressed, and nothing but his calming mate's scent would calm him down. Eventually, they fell asleep like that, curled into each other, occupying the love seat.
"Everything's fine," Mary bit back, still not looking anywhere near John. "Just differing options and all that. We'll be good soon."
"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? You should really wash your mouth out with soap. Now, where's the girl."
"Can we try?"
"Mr. Novak says that asking lots of questions is a sign of intelligence."
"I suppose you can come inside. But Cassie is still asleep."
"Do you think that the two of them will get along?"
"What are we waiting for?" Mary said, already moving back toward the truck. Bobby quickly followed after her.
Mary peeked back into the living room. "I know that. But I can see them when they come out."
"I got custody of my brother after my parents... I decided it would be best to move into my parent's old place instead of uprooting his life even more. He stayed with me there for a while, but he wasn't happy. I wasn't really expecting him to be, but he was getting worse. I thought it wouldn't hurt moving to a place that he knew.
Cas tilted his head and thought about it for a bit. "I'll ask around, see what I can do to keep Sam in my class. Since it has been a while and we are getting close to letting school out for the summer, it might be fine. As I do not really give grades, hopefully, it would not matter too much considering our relationship."
Benny knocked on the door. "Mr. Dunham? Would you open up?"
The three looked over at him completely confused while Mary had a slight sparkle in her eye. Maybe one of her sons found someone. That would make her immensely happy.
"Everything we've found is already being put in front of the grand jury. Rumors are the Novaks will use their constitutional rights for a speedy trial, hoping we don't have as much information as we do. It's probably still going to be at least a week-long trial with everything we've been trying. Ms. Haravelle says she'll want testimony from all the FBI agents working the case and the officers here to connect the murders to this entire nonsense.
"Are you really asking me that?" Dean asked, shocking at the questioning.
"Have a calm facade in front of everyone, and I mean everyone. There's no telling who they might send after you for information. People become vultures at times like these.
"Anyway," Benny continued, "this omega, for intents and purposes, was in charge of the pack. He would make plans and set up everything. Now, this is when alphas were going around and getting big heads and deeming themselves better than other designations, especially omegas. And an omega running a pack, definitely not. But everything they tried resulted in failure until one day, black clouds covered the tribe. No one knew what had happened, but you couldn't even see inside. They still tried attacking and had better success each time until they finally got through all of the defenses.
"What do you mean by that?"
"After you died," Dean started. "Dad became hellbent on revenge, and trained us to do the same as soon as he could."
"Great," Sam said, exasperated. "I'm going out."
"Gabe tried to inform you about the new development, but he forgot to hit the send button."
"No. She shouldn't have to deal with any of this," Cas said, giving his brother a slightly dirty look.
"You're going into heat, babe."
"Let's get out of here," Benny sighed.
"I do, but enough about me. I'm calling about you. How are you feeling right now?"
"5:30 is the latest they want the kids picked up."
Abbadon gave him a placating smile before continuing. "No, I mean the group from ancient mythologies. I'm sure you've heard of them before."
"Sure thing. And Dean?"
"We'll figure something out and get them out of our lives."
"I... suspect what's going on. That's the only reason we're here. If that turns out not to be true, we leave. No ifs, ands, or buts. I promise you."
"I'm queen. Now shoo. Get the bastard."
"Well, yeah," Lucifer stated with confusion in his voice. "Cassie and I look nothing alike. You had to have seen that."
"So you can fly?" John interrupted. "Doesn't that mean that you have wings and everything?"
The two stood in silence for a while until the silence was broken by a ringing phone. Reaching into his trench coat pocket, he pulled out his phone and answered it.
It seemed like every year, each group of kids became rowdier. He missed his last group, but then again, it was probably because they had learned the classroom rules. It would take time, but soon the new group would know the rules, hopefully before he broke his back trying to pick up all of the toys left lying around.
Cas stared at her blankly. He knew exactly what she was talking about.
Lucifer handed his brother a brown paper bag. Opening it up, Cas pulled out a jar of pickles and peanut butter. "What is with everyone making sure that I eat?"
Hey, Cas," Dean said the Castiel while pulling the angel up so they were eye to eye, their bare chests toughing.
"Without hunting, what do you think you'd do?"
"First, a bunch of evidence came from some of the cases that I suspected connected to our murder case and thus the trafficking ring. Lucifer has been coordinating with a bunch of crime labs, trying to see if there are any consistencies. Other than the obvious increasing anger as the killing spree continues, a couple of pieces of physical evidence are consistent. There is carpeting that is consistent with car carpeting. We can't 'get a lockdown on it, but it's the same on every single victim, and no, it doesn't match that van our would-be kidnappers had. So far, all it's giving us is a minimum age of the vehicle. Also, bullets are consistent with a 0.9mm but have been used in cases that have nothing to do with our case. Possible that it's a gun that is used for several operations. It's a mess, honestly.
"You had chicken nuggets last night."
Sam and Bobby looked at each other seeing as they were the only ones having the conversation. Dean was visibly holding himself back from the woman that seemed to be his mother, as impossible as it was. Seeming as if he had been paying attention the entire time, he nodded as he back out of the room. He needed Cas. Cas would be sure to know what was going on.
"That's probably not the best idea," Sam said urgently.
Quietly, he said, "Hi."
Once Emily was done passing drinks around, she asked the group, "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
"Hey, sweetheart," came an oily voice.
She watched as he left the room to walk upstairs. She started to walk toward him before a hand grasped her arm. Turning around, she saw it was Sam.
The man gave the woman a sheepish look. "Oops."
"So something burned, but not really," Charlie muttered to herself.
"I was hoping you had an idea," Dean stated honestly.
She walked over to the long couch that was nestled in the room before sitting down and patting the space that was right beside her. Sam eagerly walked over to sit with her as they caught up as if they were good friends. Mary started by telling him what John had told her; Sam was more than happy to fill in the holes. He noted how she didn't mention Adam as John probably hadn't told her.
Although it was hours until the moon would be fully in the sky, no one moved from their places. The girls were awake and were having a nearly silent conversation with each other. Other than notifying the adults that they were hungry, they only talked to one another. Taking the prompting, Mary got up and made dinner for everyone, needing something to do with her hands, a task that didn't take enough time.
"Why don't I just do away with you?" Sebastian growled.
"Well," Cas started before a deep blush covered his cheeks, "I created a nest for Sam and me when he got really restless. I know that only families are supposed to do that initially. I didn't mean to intrude."
"But we have a lot to say to you. At the very least, just here the offer we have for you."
"Cas," Dean yelled, trying to get his attention. "Baby, you need to tell us what's wrong."
Sam and Dean looked at each other, considering the comment.
"Really?" Lucifer asked, turning to look at his older brother with a lost look on his face.
"I always thought he looked like one of your parents. You looked like the other."
"She definitely gives off the vibes that she would kill you and then pick her teeth with your bones. Seems super expensive."
"Let me go, you bitch."
John was finally drifting off to sleep when there was knocking against the metal bars. "What do you want?" John demanded.
On the way out, Sam made sure to grab his wallet. Instead of taking the Impala with them, the two decided to walk to the nearest coffee shop. It wasn't too far and had yet to get too got.
"Noooo. I drove up, knocked on the door, and asked. I'm not stupid, Deano."
"I finished because that's just how amazing I am. Plus, nothing has really been going on since Monday. I decided to leave my throne for a while, see what was going on with my knights."
"Our girls," Celine answered this time. "I performed a tracking spell with all three. The most accurate point was Colorado. Once we're closer, the spell should become more exact."
"What is it?" John asked her.
All of the men looked at her with varying looks of confusion, except Castiel who was looking at her with interest. She looked around the room with an innocent look on her face.
Surveying the surroundings, she saw that she was in a cage. The bars were made with a think metal that was too close for her to slip through. Outside, the room was dark. Emily could see that there were windows, but they were covered with tarp. She pushed against the cage door, hoping it was unlocked. It wasn't.
"Uh-huh, hand me the phone."
"It came with the cable, and it took effort trying to talk to the cable company trying to get rid of it. Been there, done that. Wished I could get a T-shirt, but that's not going to happen because it's the cable company. Kali's just resorted to unplugging the things. It took a bit before they died. Now it's been peaceful until they realized they weren't coming through and just started coming to the shop. But jokes on them, they have to buy something if they don't want to be kicked out. Jokes on them, I don't talk to them and make money off their stupidity. I win."
"I'm sure that you say that now," Naomi said, pulling a slip of paper out of her pocket and handing it to him. "Maybe this will change your mind?"
Moving over to Dean, "I really must thank you for this opportunity that you gave me. Funnily enough, we all thought it would be your brother that set us free. But then I guess you are the one who has to start things off."
Mary stopped dead in her tracks. She couldn't get her thoughts straight. They were racing through her head with no stop. Castiel stopped walking slightly in front of her and turned in her direction. Mary opened and closed her mouth to ask more questions, but they staying on the tip of her tongue.
"So, our best option would be to find the spell and get rid of it?" Sam asked.
"I never stopped taking my heat suppressants, though."
"Anything you suggest we do?" Kali asked nervously.
"My mommy calls me Maddie."
"I'm sorry, Cassie, I thought you said that our parents were involved in a murder investigation, but I know I had to mishear you."
"I'm going."
"Jerk."
"Now, we all need to talk."
"Are you trying to tell me to cheer up?" Emily asked. At the answering nod, Emily continued. "I'll try, but I'm scared." The resulting pat was harsher. "Hey, I'm trying here. No need to hurt me."
"Objection overruled," Morris stated. "Continue."
Cas wrapped his arms around the pup as he went to lay back down. "Hold me," he said softly.
"Turn it off," Cas mumbled, bundling himself further into the covers.
Dean made his way back to the kitchen. He went to the coffee maker, put in a new filter and beans, and started the machine. As he was watching the coffee drip, he heard the doorbell ring. He looked toward the door, but it was too dark to see outside. He walked his way toward it and quickly opened the door. Standing outside the door was Cas.
"I know. I got held up, Ms. Braeden. I'll be leaving now," he said before turning toward his parents. "I'm sure you can see yourself out," he managed not to stutter before quickly leaving the room.
"You sure, Chief? Think two alphas can handle themselves," the alpha said jovially.
The two continued on their way into the small restaurant. They quickly sat down and had an enjoyable dinner filled with smiles and laughter. They left soon after and found a park to walk around a bit. It was a comfortable silence before Dean wanted to get an answer to something that was bugging him.
"No..."
"Ms. Daemon, I hope you have a good reason for this line of questioning because you are trying this court's patience."
"Then, no. We'll handle this. Oh, what about a theme?"
She walked out of the room, past John, who was awkwardly standing, looking as if he was fighting himself over saying anything. She walked down the long hallway that was traversed before, continuing to hear John's footsteps. They continued to walk in silence until the hunter got the nerve to say something.
Mary quickly opened her eyes when she heard banging on the door. She sat up from her position trying to get her bearings. Sam was engrossed in whatever he was looking at, while Dean moved away from Cas to answer the door.
Cas glared back at him and quickly disappeared. Dean rushed out of the room, suddenly remembering who exactly was here. Grasping at the railing as he ran downstairs, he heard the normal hustle and bustle that went along with a kitchen. Walking into the kitchen, he saw Bobby standing over a large pot of food and Cas sitting at the table waiting for food to be served.
"They have not finished healing yet."
"Well, I'm guessing that a thousand-year-old hag would get too many strange looks," Dean mentioned, "so there has to be an anti-aging component to the spell.
They walked into the building, using the access ramp for ease. Once inside the building, Samandrial saw them walk by him.
They spent more time perusing the store, finding absolutely nothing.
"Hey there, squirt," Dean said, looking down at the grinning up. "You ready to go?"
Dean chuckled. "I don't know how I feel about my five-year-old brother being my wingman."
"A bit," Amara said as she walked back into the room with another steaming cup of coffee. "I was out of town, and the bastard wasn't supposed to be there. Actually, he was supposed to be going for a job interview. Guess he noticed how close he was to my sister's place and decided to make a pitstop.
"Their scent. The only way to know for sure right now."
"How are you feeling?"
"Didn't know that this existed here," he mentioned to Benny.
"She's quite playful," Sam remarked.
John paced around the basement of the panic room. It had been a couple of days since finishing the case in South Carolina, he had barely scraped together a plan for getting rid of the thing that had infiltrated his family. None of the books that Bobby had lying around the living room were of any help, that is when he could read through them. He wasn't one to read lore when it had nothing to do with a case, so he knew the other man in the house would suspect something. If only he could have gotten Sam or Dean to let something slip.
"I know you will. Bye, Gabe."
"But first, we must convince them they're not monsters," Dean pouted.
Sam nodded in understanding. He didn't want to admit it, but it was a pretty good idea. "We're planning on going to eat. We figured that you two would be hungry too."
"Wouldn't it work if we split up the same way as yesterday?" Mary asked the group. "It worked pretty well. I don't see why it wouldn't tonight."
"What do you mean?" Dean asked.
"She was asked by John before, and she did not say anything before."
"CIA?" Jody asked.
"Yes, bees are very important. So I understand the need to discuss them," Cas responded.
"Yeah, I'm fairly certain that the cupid's stopped working when I died."
"Friday?"
"Is everything alright?" Dean asked her, noting that she was calmer than before.
"They said that... they found... who would find it... fun to..." Cas trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.
"Never!" Amara responded.
Dean gave Cas a quick kiss before brushing Sam's hair back and went to work. Maybe some paperwork would calm him down enough before tonight.
"You'll have to tell me this story... later. We have little ones to feed."
"The really overprotective one?"
Jody gently shook her head before turning towards the woman on the couch and held her hand out. "I don't believe we've met before. I'm Jody Mills, sheriff of the town."
Unsetting the alarm and opening the door, Dean set a stern expression on his face before talking to the man before him. "Do you have any idea how early it is?"
Gabe shook it off, dumping a mountain of sugar in his cup. Kali continued to stare at them, looking for any untoward interaction between the alpha and omega. She liked Castiel and would willingly kill the two if they were doing something behind his back. The younger omega had been through enough.
"This has to be it," Sam said.
"It's either publically accessible information or information the FBI has collected over time that didn't necessarily connect to anything. If we want those bastards to rot in prison, this needs to be well above board. I'm not going to risk a single thing."
A few seconds later, Cas walked in, looking intently at Dean's laptop.
Castiel felt tears running down his face as he whimpered. Why were his parents trying to sell him? Wasn't he good? Only when he felt someone touch his cheek did he scream out. "Don't touch me! Leave me alone!"
"Who would need to hide what they were writing behind so many languages thought?" Emily asked toward the group. "Would it make more sense to stick with one language?"
"You can try and trick my brain with your numbers, but I know the truth."
"Ready to go, Sam?" Amara cut in.
Turning around, stark blue hair was found with a smirk. She was carrying a heavy box of supplies against her side.
Across the small aisle, he heard Benny rolling his chair next to him. Looking up, he saw that the other alpha has a lookup confused concern.
"Are you okay? You sound..."
"Hey, Cas," Dean got his attention. "What did Celine give you?"
Sebastian just chuckled. "I was told that you like to make jokes."
As soon as the door was slightly open, John pushed his way into the room. "I thought I would find you all in here," he said smoothly while surveying the room, letting his eyes linger on Castiel a bit.
"What do you think they want?" Dean asked.
At this statement, Mary wrenched her hand out of John's and put space between them. This had always been an issue in their marriage. While Mary was whar she would call "forward-thinking," he always knew it was wrong. Everything about the situation was wrong.
"Then it's not a warning for you."
"You're brother talks about you all the time."
"I'm sure it was a little bit more than that," Bobby suggested, knowing that anything John said could set Sam off, even if they were on friendly terms.
"Well, I did pretty well at my old department before having to move here."
"But?"
"You're awake," Amara studied him while taking a sip of her drink. "Tell me more."
"Really, dude," Sam growled quietly.
Amara stood in the darkened room of the security office, listening to the last bits of conversation they were privy to without their lawyer being present in the room. "So they think that Michael is going to come and save them? Interesting."
"Just ash."
"Which means that Cas probably didn't smell them either," Dean grunted. "Which means they can sneak up on him whenever."
"I am not your 'sweetheart,'" Castiel stated.
"I think you should look at this," he said, handing the frame to them.
"I do," Cas stiffly answered.
"People have been talking about it for hours. I've wanted to call you all day, but Kali took my phone. Said you were working, like what I should have been doing. She's so mean to me."
"It's a mess, but we have a murder board and yarn connecting everything," Charlie mentioned. "Looks like a TV set, if we're honest."
Dean watched as he trailed behind Sam through the precinct. He would give the pup instructions every now and again, but he led the way all by himself. He was looking around with wide eyes, looking around the rooms he had never been to before.
"Let me guess, they're going to question Dean last."
"You should be exhausted."
"We don't even know if they...," Sam started.
Lucifer turned and got into Amara's face. "How about you stay out of this? I'm here for my brother."
"What's that?" Sam asked while walking toward his brother.
"Hey, guys. I found some more protective charms, so I'm making some just in case. Celine is in the back boiling water, so she'll be back soon."
"I did ask them about it," Michael broke in. "Wasn't anything I thought others should know."
On reflex, Cas responded with, "But you love her anyway."
"I suppose," he moved to the side, allowing his brother through.
"What did you find, Red?" Benny asked.
Dean chuckled while Cas's face blushed a deep red. "I don't know about that, buddy. That's up to him? What do you say, Cas?"
After getting settled in his seat, John spoke up.
"I feel really hot. I do not know why."
"I know but... It's a baby," Mary said, explaining everything.
Sam used his height to his advantage and looked over the line. The prices were decent, and there wasn't too many "frilly" option as Dean would say. He was engrossed in looking at the menu, that he almost jumped when Mary uttered a question.
"Let's get going then," Mary told the group. "The sooner we get there, the sooner we get the girls back."
"I have a special laptop where I do all of my work. This way, if someone hacks into my system, they see that I'm just some alpha living in the middle of nowhere, but I do have a lot of cash. Unfortunately, FBI standard description would be way too suspicious. I have to have info leak in order for me to be a reliable consultant and shipper of goods."
"Yep. According to TV, having a positive test is one of the best parts, so I let you have this. Now, get dressed so we can go. I'll grab you heat suppressants so you can ask to doctor about it. Make sure it's not hurting the pup."
Amara shrugged her shoulders. "Probably not. I mean, he's still asleep."
"Thanks for the input."
"It supposedly protects you from demonic possession. It's from the best book series ever."
"Right. Thank you so much for taking care of my niece and nephew until I could get back."
"What should we do now?" Dean casually asked Cas.
"What was that?" Celine chose to ask instead.
Mary immediately put the gloves on and knelt next to the box. She started by cutting the tape off the sides. She pulled the flaps up and off to the side. Reaching inside, she pulled out a single bound book. It was dark and wrinkled all over. Opening the cover, she saw a handwritten note.
