Sam laughed thinking of the class he had, Dean was going to be bored listening to this lecture. “Literary theory and criticism.”
Dean left the building with what he was sure was the biggest smile he had ever known on his face. He was so glad that the night had been a success and he couldn't wait to see Castiel again. Meanwhile inside his dorm room, Castiel couldn’t wipe the smile off his face, and he was eternally grateful that his roommate wasn’t home yet otherwise he was sure he would be facing a thousand questions about his night.
For their fourth date, Dean had decided that he wanted to cook for Castiel, so he had invited him over to his apartment. Dean had offered to pick Castiel up, but he had said that he would be okay to get their on his own. As much as Dean loved picking Castiel up for their dates, it was a good thing, as it meant he didn’t have to worry so much about having the time to both pick Castiel up and finish making their meal. Dean was a pretty good cook when he wanted to be, he just usually couldn’t be bothered and therefore didn’t cook very often, but he had been having such a great time with Castiel and growing to really like him so he wanted to bust out his skills for the night. Right on time at 7:00 he heard a knock on his door and wiped his hands before he went to answer it. Standing there, looking sexy as hell in a pair of black jeans that were so tight Dean swore he could see the muscles in his thighs, and a deep blue shirt that somehow made his eyes stand out even more than they already did, was Castiel.
Laughing harder Sam moved aside so that Dean could carry Castiel into the house. “Didn’t think you would be out this late.” Sam observed while Dean put Castiel down. He was strong, but even he could only hold a full-grown man for so long.
“Right, of course. Definitely using this then.” Dean placed a hand on the back of Castiel’s neck and guided him down till there lips met, licking his way into the younger man’s mouth. Moving his hand away from Castiel’s neck, unnoticed by Castiel who was moaning into Dean’s mouth just from the kiss, Dean managed to find the lube and get some on his fingers, doing his best to warm it up a bit before wiggling his hand between the two of them and his legs. Castiel leaned back curiously as he felt Dean’s hand moving, watching as Dean pushed one then almost instantly two fingers into himself, practically sighing at the feeling, as though it was exactly what he had needed.
“Yes.” Castiel replied, cocking his head almost like a puppy, as though confused by Dean’s question.
“There are two items on the menu tonight, rich chocolate cake with fresh cream and strawberries or me.” Dean was going all out now, not bothering to hide what he wanted from Castiel.
Castiel talked about his family, how he had two brothers, one was his twin and the other was older. His twin Gabriel was at the same college as Castiel, studying art, whereas his older brother Michael owns his own business, and Castiel himself was studying English literature with the hopes of working for a publisher after graduation, maybe even writing a book of his own. Even though he was close to his brothers, he was much closer to his cousin Anna. Dean talked about his family to, glossing over Sam as Castiel already knew him, talking about how his parents had passed away when he was in high school in a car accident, how he had then lived with his uncle Bobby, and Aunt Ellen who had gotten married when he was eight, and how Ellen’s Daughter and Bobby’s stepdaughter Jo was one of his favorite people in the world. He talked about how he had never gone to college after high school but had gotten a full-time job at his uncle’s garage where he had already been working part time since he was about 15. Castiel told Dean all about his job as a TA and his current classes, somehow finding a way to make it all sound more interesting to Dean, and Dean in turn described some of his daily life as a mechanic which Castiel seemed very interested in. They even discussed what to do after dinner and agreed on a movie to watch. By the time they had finished their dinner and paid the bill, something they fought over for about five minutes before Castiel gave in and allowed Dean to pay it on the promise that he would be the one to pay for the movie, they both appeared to be having a great time, no awkwardness present at all. Until they arrived at the movie theatre that is.
The nurse nodded and headed to the door. “I’ll leave you three alone for a few minutes.” And then she left the room.
Jo suggested and hung up as soon as she was done. Dean sighed and put his phone down before walking into his room to grab his laptop and boot it up. As soon as he had it turned on he got a notification asking him to join a a skype call so he accepted and his cousin’s face popped up on the screen, looking like she was sitting at her desk in her dorm room.
They all stayed that night for dinner, after taking the truck back to the rental place, Dean cooking dinner for everyone and then chilling in front of the tv with beer, water for Castiel. It was quite a pleasant evening in the end. Castiel and Dean drove Sam and Gabriel home, each with their respective brother, thanking them for all their help. Dean arrived back before Castiel and quickly cleaned up the kitchen and living room from their evening so that they could go straight to bed when Castiel got back. Of course Dean completely forgot that he hadn’t given Castiel his own key yet, so he was confused when he heard a knock on the door, wondering who it could possibly be.
“Just listen okay?” Once Dean nodded he continued. “There was a smell that made me sick at the deli, which felt familiar and made me realise something. So I stopped at the store before coming home and had only been back a few minutes before you got here.” He started to fiddle with his hands in his lap, nervous to say the next part and in the end grabbed what he had shoved in his pocket before leaving the bathroom and gave it to Dean.
“Congratulations, you have a little boy.” She said as Castiel cuddled the baby tight against his chest, a small proud smile on his face.
One final hard thrust and Dean biting into the skin of Castiel’s neck was all it took and with a scream Castiel came, clenching so tightly around Dean that he came with an equally loud scream of his own. Rolling off of Castiel, Dean allowed himself a moment to gain his breath back before softly padding into their bathroom and grabbing a cloth to clean them up with, simply throwing it into the washing basket before curling up in bed at Castiel’s side, pulling Castiel into him and them both promptly falling asleep.
“We should see if we can get a picture.” Dean said, still staring at the screen and holding Castiel’s hand tightly. He hadn’t let go since Castiel had laid down.
“Dada, I ike!” Jack said enthusiastically, clapping his hands and turning to run through the definitely too long grass. Dean laughed and kept an eye on Jack to make sure he didn’t hurt himself, all while walking over to Castiel and wrapping an arm around his waist.
“Dinner, then I guess we shall see what happens later. I’m thinking about a movie, but I don’t know what Castiel will want to do.”
“Do you need any help?” Castiel asked politely, startling Dean a little as he was now standing just behind Dean, one hand on his upper left arm. “Sorry.”
“Is he okay?” Castiel asked in a panic, appearing at Dean’s side and picking Jack up to check he was alright.
Dean leant back in straight away claiming Castiel’s lips again, adding his tongue into the mix and moaning as he tasted the inside of Castiel’s mouth. It was a unique flavour, entirely Castiel, and Dean couldn’t get enough. Dean groaned in annoyance when Castiel pulled away, a groan on his lips that turned into a moan when Castiel suddenly latched onto Dean’s neck and started to kiss and suck on the sensitive skin there. Dean was so distracted by the feelings that Castiel was igniting inside of him that he didn’t notice that Castiel had been slowly pushing him backwards until he felt his bed hit him behind his knees.
Castiel let go of his hand and walked up the steps, pulling his phone out of his pocket as he went and scrolling through his music until he found the song he was looking for. Pressing play he turned the volume as loud as possible and placed his phone on the railing before turning back towards Dean again.
“Sometimes even I can’t believe it.” He admitted, looking slightly less cheerful than he had a second ago.
The two men just stared at the screen for a little bit longer, not wanting to turn their gaze away, when a nurse knocked on the door to see if they were okay. They made an appointment for a months’ time on the way out and asked if they could possibly get a picture of the baby. The receptionist put a mark on Castiel’s file and promised that they would be able to collect the photo the following day. On the way home Castiel got a sudden urge to be sick, so Dean pulled over and let Castiel get out. After a minute his stomach had settled though, so he got back in the car and they continued back to his apartment, once they had entered however Castiel sprinted to the bathroom, Dean followed behind him. When Dean entered the bathroom Castiel was already bent over the toilet, emptying his stomach of his breakfast, so Dean knelt beside him and rubbed his back soothingly as Castiel continued to retch even after there was nothing left to come up. When he was certain he wasn’t going to throw up anymore Castiel got up from the floor and brushed his teeth to get rid of the taste, then together he and Dean curled up on the couch and watched movies all day, talking quietly and starting to make some plans.
Jack is now about 1 ½ years old with brown hair like Dean and blue eyes like Castiel, and Castiel had returned to work after his maternity leave a few months ago. He hated leaving his son at day care every day, but he loved his job and had missed working a lot over the year he had off and was excited to be back. At least he was, until one particular Monday where he had to call in sick at around 8 in the morning after having been throwing up on and off for the past hour. Dean had offered to stay home with him, but he had told him to go to work, he would fine on his own, so Dean left for work, taking Jack with him to drop at day care in the way. Castiel had tried to insist that he would be okay to take care of Jack, but Dean said he should rest instead, so when he had finished throwing up and had a shower to clean himself up, he sat on the couch to rest and watch some tv. After ten minutes though he was bored. There was nothing on TV and he was already feeling better, so he went and grabbed his laptop and his phone, calling work to see if there was anything he could do from home. He got a list of correspondence, appointments and other minor tasks to do and set to work on doing them. Unfortunately without the distractions of other workers in the office, and regular memos from his boss for other things he needed to do for him, Castiel got through his list by lunchtime, and decided to order something to eat instead of making something, getting changed into something more presentable than sweats and an oversized shirt (Which was only oversized because it was from when he had been heavily pregnant with Jack), grabbing his wallet, phone and keys and heading out for some fresh air and food. It wasn’t until Castiel had entered his favorite little deli just down the street from their apartment that he got an idea about what might be wrong with him. He was standing in line waiting to order, when the door to the kitchen opened and the smell of some freshly baked items drifted out. Suddenly Castiel’s stomach lurched horribly, and he left the line to move as quickly as he could without running towards the bathroom. Surprised there was anything left in his stomach after his morning curled over the toilet, Castiel threw up again. After he was done he washed his mouth out as best he could, and ordered some lunch while he was still there, but once he left instead of going home as he had originally planned, he headed a little further down the street to the corner store instead. Making his way to a particular isle he stared at the range the store offered on what he needed, picking a brand that was on sale. Once he had paid he basically ran back to the apartment, wanting to get this done as soon as possible, and also before Dean got home from work.
“So, they are essentially a second teacher for the class?” Dean was trying to make sure he understood exactly what Sam was telling him.
“Cas?” Dean called as he entered the bathroom, although he could clearly see where he was. There were only two stalls, and his feet were sticking out from the far stall. “Are you okay?” Dean asked.
“Now he does, but what about when he finds out? We never talked about this since the last time and he may not want it.” Cas explained.
“Dada!” Castiel heard, turning to see Jack next to his bed and jumping as though he was trying to get up but wasn’t quite big enough to manage it. Dean settled him for a second and helped Castiel sit up, arranging the pillows to allow him to lean against them, before picking Jack up and putting him on the bed where he quickly hugged his dad. “Baby!!” He screamed, still so excited.
“Of course, I am happy to read it and provide some feedback. I’m actually pretty sure you are the only student who has even started it yet.” Castiel smiled at Sam as he said that. And of course Dean had to laugh quietly at his nerd of a little brother. Unfortunately he didn’t laugh quietly enough, and Castiel turned his eyes to Dean. “I don’t think I have seen you in this class before. Are you new?” He asked.
Dean smiled and laughed lightly. “I’m actually a pretty good cook. I honestly just can’t be bothered most of the time. I am glad that you like it though.”
“Your beer.” She said, placing the bottle down in front of him with a glass. “And the water.” Placing it where Castiel had been sitting a minute ago. “Are you ready to order or would you like some more time.”
“I’ve been saving money since I started working in high school in a separate bank account, and since you moved in and we started splitting all living costs, I have been able to put a little more away each week than I was before. I have quite a lot in that account and it’s enough for a large deposit. I have been looking at some houses recently and was going to say something in a few weeks, but I guess now is as good a time as any.”
Castiel could feel the smile that spread across Dean’s face when he mentioned a girl. “Why is that?”
Castiel couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face. “Good. Cause I was going to find out even if you didn’t.”
“Congratulations Dean!” Sam said, pulling his brother into a hug and making Dean feel tiny because of his size, then releasing him and giving Castiel just as big a hug.
Dean signaled Ruby back over and she took their dessert order, before asking if they wanted anymore drinks. Dean thought about ordering another beer, he had only had two, but he didn’t want to drink too much.
“But what about work and space Dean? I’ve only been back a few months and now I’m going to have to tell my boss about this and start organizing the maternity leave again. And this place is only big enough for the three of us, we can’t fit another kid in here.” Castiel explained.
The next morning Dean when about his usual morning routine for a Saturday morning. He made breakfast when he had finally dragged himself out of bed, which was basically just a protein shake, and headed to the gym. Sam would always tease him about getting fat because of the way he ate, but as much as Dean was definitely quite a bad eater at times, he did still take care of his body through supplements and working out. After about a three-hour gym session Dean headed home for a shower and to pick out what he was going to wear for the night. That was where Dean got stuck. He hadn’t been out on a proper date in years and had absolutely no idea what he was supposed to wear. In the in he gave up and decided to call his cousin Jo for help. She answered almost immediately.
It was something that Castiel always liked when he wasn’t feeling well. Whenever he had had a cold or the flu throughout there relationship so far he always liked Dean to read to him, so it made sense to the older man that he would want that now when he was in the most pain he had ever experienced in his life to date. Dean rummaged in the bag they had and found a book that Castiel had packed, then nudged him forward a bit on the bed and got up on it behind him, fitting Castiel comfortably into the V of his legs. He wound his arms around Castiel so that he could see the book as well and hooked his chin over Castiel’s shoulder starting to read to him. The reading itself was slow going as Dean stopped every time Castiel had a new contraction and helped him through it, Castiel sometimes grabbing one of Dean’s hands causing him to drop the book, sometimes gripping his leg where he could reach it. Every half an hour the doctor came back as promised and checked Castiel again to see how his labor was progressing. Around 7 am Castiel was exhausted having been awake for about 24 hours, his contractions now coming a lot closer together, so Dean had put the book down, not bothering to continue reading. When Castiel felt like the contractions weren’t stopping for breaks he asked Dean to press the call button, the doctor arriving a few minutes after. He checked Castiel again and announced that he was ready to start delivering the baby. Dean got off the bed and moved beside it, still close enough to Castiel for him to squeeze his hand when he needed. The doctor called a nurse in to assist him, and they started to guide Castiel through the final part of his labor, instructing him to push whenever he got the urge. Each contraction was a lot more painful now, and Castiel screamed through most of them. It physically hurt Dean to see his boyfriend in so much pain, he wanted nothing more than to take it away, or to trade places with him and be the one on the bed giving birth instead. After about half an hour of pushing they got what sounded like the best news possible at that moment from the doctor.
“Cassie!!!” Castiel didn’t even turn around at first, just groaned as though he was in pain and closed his eyes, until a second yell was made, then he turned around.
“I could never get sick of you.” Castiel said, sliding his hand across the table to grab Dean’s. Castiel was all ready to blurt out his little secret whilst looking into Dean’s deep green eyes, when their waitress arrived at the table. Once upon a time Dean would have pulled his hand away but now he just squeezed a little tighter before shifting his gaze to look at the waitress.
“I’m gonna spoil that kid so much, it had better have a sweet tooth just like it’s uncle.” Gabriel said.
“What’s the matter Cuz, don’t like hearing about Cas and I getting intimate.” Dean teased, creeping up behind Jo and saying the final word right in her ear.
“DOWN IN A MINUTE SAM.” Dean yelled back, he was currently standing in front of the bathroom mirror adjusting his tie, trying his best to get it to sit straight. He heard a chuckle and turned around to see Castiel leaning against the door frame watching him, a small smile on his face and his piercing blue eyes sparkling.
Pushing the door open softly, Dean peered around it and was shocked at the sight he saw. Castiel was on the floor next to the toilet, with arms wrapped around his legs that were pulled up to his chest, his head buried as deep towards his chest as he could get it. When Castiel looked up Dean could see that his eyes were red and swollen from crying, fresh tears still running down his cheeks, his nose red as well, presumably from the tissues that were pilled up next to him. “Cas? Are you okay?”
Instead of an answer, Castiel leant forward and kissed Dean again with all the passion that he had left, it was hard to add much more than what he had been using in the kitchen, but somehow Castiel managed it. Dean kissed Castiel back with just as much passion, hands roaming slightly, mapping out each other’s upper bodies as best they could through their clothing. After a couple of minutes Castiel pulled away and Dean chased his lips, not wanting to stop kissing Castiel. Castiel laughed lightly at the way Dean chased him.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Jody Mills, estate agent.” She said, shaking Castiel’s hand as well. “I have three houses for you today and hopefully we can find your future home. If you like we can head out now and I can show you houses.”
Dean felt his cheeks colour slightly as he realized who he had run into. “Castiel right?” He said, knowing exactly who he was, but wanting to pretend otherwise.
“Oh hey Dean, Cas. You look good tonight, nice to see you out of the overalls Dean.” Sam teased his big brother.
Dean chuckled and stopped teasing, pushing his finger inside Castiel instead, smirking as Castiel gasped and threw his head as Dean crooked his finger at just the right spot. Castiel rolled off Dean as he laid down and spread his legs, inviting Dean back in. Dena moved so he was in a better position between Castiel’s legs, leaning down he captured Castiel’s lips in a bruising kiss as he gently pushed his finger back in. Castiel arched up against Dean and moaned, a deep and guttural sound that Dean could feel through his own body.
“Is it okay if have a look inside the tree house?” Dean asked Jody, smiling when she assured him it was fine and moving across the yard to help Jack up to the top.
Dean did laugh a little, hoping it would put a wider smile on Castiel’s face. “I think it’s a bit late for a shotgun wedding.” He was relieved when Castiel did smile wider, even managed a small chuckle. Thinking quickly, Dean reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a hankie to wipe Castiel’s face of his tears. This made Castiel actually laugh.
They walked to the car and chatted a little about what they had both been up to recently as they made there way to the lecture hall where Sam’s class was supposed to take place. As they walked into the hall Dean looked at the layout and considered where they should sit.
“It was okay, pretty boring really. I’ll tell you about it in the morning. Get some sleep.” Castiel said as he walked out of the room to the bathroom, showering quickly. When he got back he was expecting to find Dean asleep, but he was instead laying on his back staring at the door. “You’re not asleep yet?”
“Dean, he’s perfect.” Ellen said, tears in her eyes as she looked at her new little nephew. “I should tell Bobby and Jo.”
As soon as the bedroom door was shut Castiel grabbed Dean and pushed him up against it, pressing his whole body as tightly against Dean’s as possible, and grinding against him. As he moved his hips Castiel pressed his lips against Dean’s neck, sucking and biting gently in a way he knew drove Dean crazy. As though his point was being proved, Dean threw his head back against the door with a loud bang, groaning loudly.
“Uhh yeah, umm in the top draw.” Dean was finding it hard to concentrate on words, he was busy staring at Castiel now that there was nothing in the way of his view. His main focus was on Castiel’s groin. He was a lot bigger than Dean would have guessed, but he had no problem with that. He was pretty certain he was going to be sore the next day, but he also knew it would be worth it. Castiel moved off Dean once again and leaned out to reach the draw, grabbing the lube and condom’s that Dean kept in there. Castiel hesitated for a moment when he looked at the condom. “Are you clean?” Dean asked quickly, hoping Castiel wouldn’t think it was too personal a question.
“Let me call my receptionist and see.” Jody made the call and filled them in after a few minutes. “We do have the details for this house as well as the keys. There is no one currently occupying it so we can look as soon as I return from the office with the keys if you want.”
It had been about five weeks since Dean first visited Sam at college and attended his class. They had decided to make Friday night dinners together a regular thing, Dean meeting Sam at the lecture hall after his last class, them going out to eat, and finding something else to do afterwards, before Dean dropped Sam off at his dorm around midnight. Sam greatly appreciated his brother going to the effort to spend time with him, but he couldn’t help noticing the way that Dean would scan the crowd of people leaving the hall every week, as though he was looking for someone in particular. Sam wasn’t stupid, he knew exactly who Dean was looking for, but he never said anything. This particular Friday Dean arrived at Sam’s lecture hall building about ten minutes before his class was due to end. Just as he was walking towards an empty seat outside the room Sam’s class was in, he saw a familiar dark haired figure hurry from the room, almost running in the opposite direction. Dean wanted to say something to him, after all he had been hoping to see him again since they first met, but he was clearly in such a hurry that Dean figured maybe he could catch him another time. Instead he sat in the seat he was originally walking towards and waited for Sam to be finished. Ten minutes later Sam emerged from the hall, and they were walking out of the building towards the Impala.
Castiel simply nodded as another contraction hit him and he felt he couldn’t speak. The doctor waited till it was over to speak again himself. “I can see your partner paid a lot of attention in birth class, you’re doing a great job there Mr. ….” He quickly checked the file again to find Dean’s name. “Winchester. I just need to do a quick examination now to see how far dilated you are Mr. Novak. I do apologise beforehand, a lot of patients find this to be quite invasive, but it is a necessity so that I know where you are at in your labor. Is that okay?”
“So, we’re keeping it?” Castiel asked, he was still so sure that they weren’t ready, but if they both wanted the baby they would find a way to make it work.
“Okay.” Dean drove towards the park, his arm wrapped around Castiel and Castiel’s head leaning on his shoulder. When the park came into sight Dean pulled into the parking lot and they got out. Castiel grabbed Dean’s hand and started leading him down the path, past the playground where they regularly bought the boys to play, towards a gazebo that was always lit up with fairy lights. When they reached the gazebo Castiel turned towards Dean.
“Come on, lets go to bed.” Castiel pulled Dean up off the couch and grinned as his boyfriend stumbled slightly. “Okay, just tired or had a few too many?” He joked, knowing Dean hadn’t had anything to drink. He never did if he was the only one with Jack.
Suddenly the last bit of control Dean had maintained snapped, and he came all over his stomach with a shout of Castiel’s name that could probably be heard from the lobby of his building, his hole clenching tightly around Castiel. The extra pressure that Castiel could feel on his cock tipped him over the edge too, and he buried his face in Dean’s neck to muffle his own scream of Dean’s name.  As they both came down from their high, they disentangled themselves from each other and laid down, Castiel placing his head on Dean’s chest, while Dean placed his arm around Castiel. After lying there a while, they had both regained control of their breathing enough to talk.
“Yes!” Castiel said a little louder this time so Dean could actually hear him. “Yes, I will marry you.”
“Hi Jack!.” Jody said excitedly. “You as well, hopefully we find your forever home today. Are you ready to go?”
“That would depend on what dessert is.” Castiel threw back, his voice dripping with the same sexy tones that Dean was using.
“That’s okay.” Dean said understanding completely. “I am the same way with Sam, I get where he is coming from.”
Dean tried to relax as he felt the head of Castiel’s cock press against his hole, just as the head started to breach his muscle he clenched down again. Castiel’s cock was a lot thicker than his fingers and it did hurt a little bit. Castiel looked like he was about to pull back, so Dean reached out and grabbed hold of his arse to pull him forward a bit further. Even though it hurt a little more than the first push, it also sent a spike of pleasure through him, and he couldn’t help but moan at the feeling. “Please keep going Cas.”
“Yeah, he leaves about 15 minutes early every week. He was a little late leaving today, probably why he was hurrying.” Sam explained.
Believing the words Dean spoke, Castiel took a deep breath and said what he had to. “I’m pregnant Dean.” Although he had gotten the words out he couldn’t look at Dean, scared of what he would see if he did.
“It smells amazing in here, what are we having?” Castiel asked as he followed Dean into the kitchen, sitting at the island bench, watching Dean move around the kitchen checking on things and looking around the apartment as though he was figuring out another piece of the puzzle that was Dean Winchester.
“Okay, can I ask why you decided to?” Gabriel probed further. As much as he liked Dean and was glad that his brother was happy, he couldn’t help feeling that maybe they were only doing it because of the baby, not because they actually wanted to.
“Well there are three on Saturday, and two on Sunday. We just have to meet the agent at her office and then she will drive us to the houses.”
“So it’s settled. We’ll find a good night in the next week?” Castiel asked, wanting to tell them all sooner rather than later, especially since it seemed he would be showing very soon and wanted them to find out before then.
On Friday Dean had his usual plans with Sam, and despite hoping he would find a way to run into Castiel again, even if only for a minute, he didn’t see him. They mostly managed to avoid the topic of Dean’s date, especially when Dean asked Sam about Jessica and it then became quite difficult to shut Sam up. Apparently he had asked Jessica out in their study session the previous Sunday and she had said yes, so Sam was taking her out the next night. Luckily Dean found out he wasn’t planning on taking her to the same place he was taking Castiel. He didn’t want their first date to be awkward, well even more awkward, than it was already going to be by his brother being in the same place. For the first time since they had started their Friday night tradition, the brother cut this night short, Dean leaving Sam’s dorm at around 9 to head home. Sam had a lot of work to get through that weekend for his classes and needed all the spare time he can manage to get it all done. When Dean got back to his apartment he sat watching TV for a bit, then checked on what movies were currently playing in town in case Castiel did want to go to a movie after dinner, he wanted to at least be somewhat prepared, before heading to bed.
“Well do you remember when my grandfather passed away when I was still in college, he left me a inheritance. It’s enough for me to cover the extra money for the house and still have some left over. We can get the house Dean.” Castiel smiled, and saw Dean answer with his own smile, leaning in to kiss Castiel lightly.
That evening the spent time with their family, everyone fawning over the new baby, fighting over who was next to get to cuddle him. Sam ordered a stack of pizzas for dinner and Gabriel cleaned everything up after dinner, no one letting Dean or Castiel lift a finger. Later that night when everyone was gone, Dean and Castiel went to check on Kevin and Jack before going to bed themselves and were surprised to find that Jack had somehow climbed into Kevin’s crib and was sleeping next to him, one hand on his brother as though he was trying to make sure he was still there. Castiel leaned into Dean’s chest, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder as they watched there two boys sleep for a bit. Eventually though Dean stepped forward and picked Jack up gently, so as not to wake him, and carried him back to his own room for bed, whilst Castiel made sure that Kevin didn’t need anything else for a few hours.
By the fifth month of Castiel’s pregnancy Dean was spending practically every night at his boyfriend’s apartment. With his hormones all different to normal he was emotional and horny most of the time, sometimes needing to have sex multiple times a day. Dean was getting exhausted, almost like he was the one carrying their child. Between work, helping Castiel pack up his apartment for the move, and trying to keep up with Castiel’s increased sex drive he felt like he barely had a moment to himself these days. But he wasn’t going to complain, he was much too excited about becoming a father. They had been having regular ultrasound appointments to check on the baby’s progress and were delighted to hear each time that the baby was perfectly healthy. At their last appointment they had been asked if they wanted to know the gender of the baby, but they had both previously decided they would rather be surprised when it was born.
“That’s okay.” She said. “There is plenty of time. For now we can just put baby Novak on the tag, and you just let us know when you have a name.” The nurse was about to leave when Castiel said something that stopped her. “I’m sorry, what was that?” She asked politely.
Dean groaned, but also looked at his watch. “That sounds so boring, but we better go if you don’t wanna be late. Do we need to walk or drive to the building?” They started walking out of the building as Sam now looked at his watch to see the time.
By the sixth month mark not much had changed, except that Castiel was slightly less emotional, and he and Dean had started shopping for items for the nursery. When purchasing the bigger items such as the crib and change table they got them delivered to Dean’s apartment, as they were fairly sure they wouldn’t fit them in the impala, and it was better than sending them to Castiel’s as they would just have to move them to Dean’s place eventually anyway. The smaller items such as clothes, toys and blankets were easily placed in the trunk and bought home with them.
“Yes I’m fine. I just need to call Dean. The baby’s coming.” Castiel said, taking a sharp breath when another contraction rocked through his body.
“Stop whining you idjit. I’m giving you time off, take it.” At Dean’s silence Bobby looked up to see him looking like he was thinking really hard, potentially trying to solve a really hard equation. “It’s not rocket science boy, why don’t you go visit Sam? Have a night out with him.”
The doctor’s appointment was at 11am, so Dean let Castiel sleep in, choosing to make him some breakfast when he got up around 9. “Sleep well?” Dean asked when he heard Castiel enter the room.
“I think I do Cas, but it’s not really up to me. It’s your body, and therefore your decision. I would never tell you what to do with your own body.”
“Alright, no need to get angry Cassie, I’ll leave you two alone. Have a nice night, ohh and Dean, don’t hurt my brother or you’ll have me to deal with.” Gabriel warned.
As Castiel’s pregnancy progressed the couple started preparing the nursery for the new baby, watching as Jack grew more and more excited as the due date got closer. He was so excited to meet his new baby brother or sister that he was even helping to pick things for the nursery when they went shopping for stuff. Jack was the one who picked a particular stuffed toy for the baby, proudly proclaiming that it would be the baby’s favorite toy. Castiel’s hormones were demanding sex as regularly as they had when he was carrying Jack, and Dean was happy to help him as often as needed. Maternity leave had been sorted out with Castiel’s boss, and it would start one week before his due date. A lot of people in Castiel’s life, including his boss wanted him to start a little earlier than that as he had done the last time, but as his job required him to sit at a desk 90% of the day, he wasn’t worried about working. As he hit his third trimester he noticed that his and Dean’s brothers would drop by more often and spend longer at the house, playing with Jack and giving Castiel a chance to rest a bit. He didn’t say anything as he didn’t want them to know he knew, but he knew that they were just worried about him exerting too much energy with his son, and no one wanted anything to go wrong with the pregnancy. Everything else with the pregnancy went just as smoothly as the first time, except the day that Castiel went into labor. It was his last day at the office before his maternity leave was to start, and he was sitting at his desk checking that all his boss’s important appointments for the next week had been scheduled and checking over his list to make sure he wasn’t going to leave anything unfinished when his labor started.
“Sorry guys, he can’t help it. Hormones and shit.” Dean reasoned as Castiel went back to his food looking very embarrassed. The rest of lunch was mostly silent as three out of the four of them were embarrassed about the little groping incident, only Dean was unaffected, but then it was time to head to the apartment so they could finish moving all Castiel’s stuff. It was a much quicker unpack this time than the storage unit though as they simply decided to just pile all the boxes up in the living room and sort them out later. While he still had some help though, Dean asked Sam and Gabriel to stick around a little longer and help him set up the baby furniture they had purchased about a month ago but had just been sitting in the nursery since then in the boxes it had all come in. Unfortunately for them, the instructions were all in pictures, no words, so it took longer than any of them would like to admit to put it all together with quite a few arguments on what they were supposed to put where, and lots of swearing when things didn’t fit right. Castiel had offered to help, but once again was told no so he went into the main bedroom and started putting some of his cloths away instead. He didn’t have too much to put away cloths wise though as half of what he owned appeared too already be there from all the time he had spent at Dean’s apartment. Most of all he had left to put away were his newer clothes, all the maternity items that were all he could currently fit into.
“Yeah Cas, we do. I’m so proud of you.” He said, tears starting to well up in his own eyes as he looked down upon their little miracle and was met with wide eyes that were the exact same shade of blue as Castiel’s, and he placed a gentle kiss to Castiel’s lips. Unfortunately their little moment was interrupted when the nurse came back with some paperwork that she had already filled out most of.
“I know Dean, it’s not my first time looking after them. We’ll be fine. Go have some fun.” Sam gently nudged Dean towards Castiel, smiling at the way the two men almost unconsciously leaned into each other and clasped hands as though they were still a new couple.
“There you go.” Castiel said happily as he turned Dean to face him so he could properly look at his handy work. “Much better.”
“Of course. You didn’t really think I was going to ask you to get rid of our baby did you?” Dean asked.
Dean smiled in a way that he couldn’t remember having done in a long time and drew Castiel forward into a kiss. Licking into his mouth and tasting the remains of their breakfast, pancakes and syrup.
“Well not everyone is like you Gabriel.” Castiel said, shotting his brother a look that clearly told him to get lost.
Castiel couldn’t help but laugh, crawling into bed next to Dean in just his boxers and settling into the comfortable mattress, his muscles relaxing. Dean wriggled one arm under Castiel’s body and pulled the younger man into his side, his other arm moving to rest with his hand on Castiel’s abdomen. “Was the bed really too empty, or did you just want to touch me?” Castiel questioned, unable to hide the smile on his face.
“How do you feel?” Castiel asked him. The line of questioning made him feel like it was his first-time having sex this way, but he had gotten to know Castiel pretty well the last few weeks and he was simply kind and caring by nature.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, but do you have a name yet?” She asked kindly, watching them with a small smile that showed she clearly loved her job and seeing the families together after a new life was bought into the world.
When they finished Castiel once again insisted on helping Dean, clearing the table, and rinsing dishes before handing them to Dean to stick in the dish washer. After Dean had placed the last dish in and started the wash cycle, Castiel mustered some courage he didn’t know he had and spun Dean around, pushing him back against the counter and crowding him in with his hands on either side of Dean’s waist on the counter, not touching him. “Do I get my dessert now?” Castiel asked, using what Dean was certain was the sexiest voice to ever exist.
All in all the night had gone a lot better than either Dean or Castiel had expected, but as they crawled into bed in Castiel’s apartment, they were very glad that it had gone so well. Dean had a feeling that this pregnancy was going to be a lot easier for Castiel now that he knew he had so many people on his side.
“You too Jody. Please just call me Dean. This is my partner Cas.” He said, gesturing to the man standing beside him.
“Ten minutes. Is that a good thing?” Crowley wasn’t really sure what to do apart from trying to keep Castiel comfortable until his partner arrived.
“Hey Jack.” Sam said, smiling largely at the boy in his arms before turning to his brother and Castiel. “He can almost say Uncle Sam.”
“Everything.” Castiel whispered in reply, understanding exactly what Dean wanted from what he had said.
“I have no problem with it Cas, in fact I love it. But are you sure you want it that way around?” Dean asked.
“Fuck Cas!” Dean moaned, his hips thrusting up without his permission. Castiel moaned in response, sending vibrations through Dean. Moving quickly so that Dean wouldn’t have a chance to move himself, Castiel put the condom on Dean, crawled up his body until he was sitting over his groin, grabbed his cock and sat down on it quite quickly. Castiel gasped as he felt himself being filled, and Dean outright screamed at the feeling of being so unexpectedly encased in a tight heat. Castiel didn’t wait around to get used to the feeling either, as soon as he was fully seated he raised himself back up and slammed back down again. After about three thrusts this way, Dean started to thrust up to meet Castiel. It didn’t last long, Dean had already been close from Castiel sucking his cock, and Castiel hadn’t felt this full in so long that he was on the edge almost as soon as they began. They both screamed in pleasure as they reached their climaxes, Dean first, then Castiel only a few thrusts after. Castiel fell forward, his face falling into Dean’s neck.
“I’m okay.” Dean breathed deeply again for a minute, before locking his eyes on the beautiful blue eyes he loved so much. “Cas, we’ve been together 10 years, and I know those years haven’t always been easy. We weren’t prepared for Jack when we had him, but we managed, and Kevin was another surprise. But despite everything we have struggled through I have never been happier than I’ve been since the day I met you.” Dean paused for a moment to slip the ring box out of his pocket, and then slipped out of his chair so that he was on one knee next to Castiel. “So, Castiel Novak.” He held out the box and opened it so the ring was showing. Castiel was now staring as though in shock, a single tear falling down one cheek. “Will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?”
Castiel squinted in analysis. “So then, when one is engaged in acts of hygiene, elimination, and sexual activities, it is inappropriate to be in the same room… or vehicle… unless specifically invited. Is that correct?”
Dean shouldn’t have had that burrito. Sam warned him, and, goddammit, he was right. He had been locked in the bathroom, clenching his cramped guts for at least 20 minutes. Clearly, the stomach of steel was starting to show its age. Resting his head in his hands, he sighed. He suspected he wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Sam would have to follow up on the lead from the historical society alone tonight. His thoughts were interrupted by a loud knock on the tile wall in front of him.
Castiel breaks eye contact, looking down demurely. “Do you remember that time you tied me up last month?” he inquires.
The thin wire rack teeters in slow motion. Castiel’s arms flail as he scrambles to catch it. He manages, but half the impulse buy items scatter all over the floor. He looks up in alarm at the shock in Dean’s face. Furiously blushing, Castiel rushes to sort out the pile of magnets, postcards, and bookmarks that jumbled all together. “I am so, so, so sorry!” He holds up a hand to signal that he doesn’t need help. “Um, don’t worry… I’ve… I’ve got this.” It’s bad enough that he’s a complete klutz; he doesn’t want to make Dean’s morning more stressful on top of it.
Castiel is clearly still mortified and NOT amused. "Look," Gabe tries to de-escalate, "It just didn't sound natural! It was like some twisted abomination produced by an illicit affair between a romance novel and a cover letter." He flaps his hands around in confusing pantomime to illustrate his point.
Castiel shifts his awareness towards Dean’s soft stomach, swirling grace across the taut skin. Plunging low, he teasingly brushes it against the curled golden hair at his groin. Dean bites back a moan and his breath quickens. He strains against his bindings with every dip, but they hold fast. Cas’s eyes are riveted on the way Dean’s chest heaves with effort. “Hey,” Dean protests as he trails his grace up and away, raking it against Dean’s sides. Sharpening his essence into a point he drags it in between his ribs, admiring the smooth curve of his lats. Dean squirms and blushes slightly, “Umm, that kinda tickles.”
“Hello Dean,” Castiel rumbles warmly as he approaches the counter. “I didn’t expect to find you back here.”
Dean comes out from behind the counter anyway to squat down beside him. He puts a calming hand on Castiel’s arm and murmurs,“Hey Cas, man, it’s okay. It’s okay.” His eyes shine soft and sincere when he catches his gaze. Castiel frowns self-deprecatingly and looks down at his gentle grip.
Throwing the cheap polyester blanket over his lap, he fell back on the bed and covered his face in shame. What could he even say? Everything was over.
Castiel unbuttons his pants as he watches Dean struggle, stepping out of them with a quiet sigh of relief. Slipping his tented boxers down, he firmly grips his cock and strokes it slowly, teasing himself as he teases Dean. “I love it when you get so… wanton, so full of need.” He crouches down besides the headboard and whispers in Dean’s ear. “Tell me what you need, Dean. Use your words.”
“Great! So, when do you get out of your last lecture? I could swing by and pick you up from campus or home… I guess home would make more sense, right? That would give you time to change or whatever and…” Dean rambles animatedly until his eyes catch on the paper in Castiel’s hand.
With a pinched face and a stridently nasal voice, Gabe recites loudly, "'Dear Dean Winchester..." Castiel sighs and covers his face with his hand, wishing for a quick death. He's always considered this impression the most grating part of his brother's comedy routine. Doubly so at the moment. Cas is still convinced Gabe specifically does it to mock him, despite Gabe’s every assurance to the contrary.
Gabe takes the opportunity to slip the letter out from under Cas's arm for a closer examination. His little brother's head shoots up in alarm as he exclaims, "Well let's see what's gonna win over Mr. Tall, Freckled, and Charming here." Castiel winces as Gabe clears his throat and pulls out his hoity-toity professor impression.
His commanding tone makes Dean’s hips rock more feverishly, lifting him off the mattress. He could have come right then and there at the sound of it. Dean pants as he tries to create more friction, more pressure, more something. “Castiel,” he begs, “please, fuck… please…”
Dean feels himself stiffen at the memory of Castiel writhing and begging for more. “Uh, with the blindfold and the ice?” he replies, voice rough with arousal. He had kept the under the bed restraints tucked in between the mattress and sideboards, hoping to revisit them sooner rather than later. Well, Sam likely wouldn’t make it back for at least another six hours… He chuckles as he saunters over to Castiel’s side. “I don’t think I could ever forget the sounds you made.”
Castiel had heard him before he saw him that first day. A deep, melodious laugh rang out from the stockroom, so unselfconscious that just hearing it put Cas at ease. When the double doors swung open, however, he was stunned. He never thought it was actually possible for the sight of someone to literally take one’s breath away. But there he was…. breathless. Who could imagine a jaw so sharp paired with lips so full? Stubble softened the angles of the man’s face in ways that begged to be touched and the casual smile he gave a passing customer was absolutely radiant. Even from a distance, his eyes revealed an enthusiasm and intensity Castiel knew he had to explore. His gaze caught the glimpse of collarbone that peeked out from the man’s partially buttoned grey henley and trailed its way down. His build was firm, but not bulky. Broad shoulders tensed and forearm muscles rippled as he carried out a box of hardcovers. This was the kind of body that was borne from hard work and active pastimes, not hours at the gym. An honest body to match an honest laugh.
Rendered breathless, his pupils blown, Dean can barely nod his consent. His soft flannel is lost before they even make it to the bedroom door. They refuse to break apart, stumbling into the doorjam as they grope each other. Grabbing his black t-shirt from the back, Dean’s shoulders flex as he pulls it smoothly over his head and drops it to the floor. Reaching out to unbutton Castiel’s crisp white dress shirt, he’s confused when Castiel grabs his wrist with a firm shake of the head.
“Then I truly must apologize, Dean. I have behaved very inappropriately this past week, accident or not. I am truly sorry.”
“Heh, yeah… So anyway, you obviously need to get back to work. I’ll just leave this with you and, um, I guess see you tomorrow maybe?” He nods to himself and practically shoves the book at Dean’s chest. “I think you’ll find the Nökken particularly interesting. Malicious spirits that drown people in bodies of water are relatively universal, but the Nordic interpretations are more complex, incorporating elements of shapeshifter lore as well. It’s right up your alley.”
Dean closes the book with a frustrated thump and adds it to the growing heap to his left. An entire Men of Letters library and not a single scrap of information that seems to be relevant to this damn case. Hopefully that medieval studies professor Sammy was visiting would have some insights, because he had passed his wit’s end hours ago.  Raising his arms over his head, Dean stretches back in the chair and rests his feet up on the polished maple table. He pretends he doesn’t notice Castiel’s gaze linger on his broad chest, but he secretly swells with pride.
It suddenly clicked and Dean’s anger deflated into exhaustion. “No, Cas… you’ve got it all wrong.” He raised his hands to pacify the responding glower. “I wasn’t clear enough. I’m sorry. When I said that you needed to learn to knock, I didn’t mean that literally, man. I meant that you needed to learn the boundaries of privacy. That sometimes people don’t want someone else just burst in or popping in or whatever. If someone is in the bathroom in any way and they haven’t specifically invited you in, you wait outside. Knock to let them know you’re there. If someone’s about to or in the process of getting laid, you don’t just drop by. Well,” he winked, “unless you are explicitly invited to be part of the fun.” Dean rubbed a tired hand across his face. How many things would he still have to explain? How many more times will it be such a mess?
“My apologies,” Cas intones as he smooths his grace out into rippling waves, rolling down his sides. Penetrating past the skin, they reverberate deep into Dean’s muscles and he groans with pleasure. The energy feels warm and full, loosening his remaining stress while building upon a very different kind of tension.
The door slams shut a little louder than is really necessary and something heavy thumps onto the hallway floor. “Ughhhhh, why is the laundromat so far away?” Gabe whines  as he shuffles into the kitchen, flopping his arms about with exaggerated pathos. From the way he behaves, Castiel muses, you’d never guess that he’s the older of the two. Gabe prefers to be on the road, but when he doesn’t have any stand-up gigs booked, he generally graces Cas’s futon and eats all his cereal. In a way, it’s kind of nice… not that Castiel would ever admit that to his brother. Gabe was always his favorite sibling and things were lonely here in Cambridge when he wasn’t around. Between graduate classes and teaching, Castiel never really found the time to make friends in his new town. Gabe, at least, is a crass constant, an annoying anchor of affection.
Dean’s breath catches as Castiel peels them off with exaggerated slowness. “Yeah?” He huffs, “Well, uh, you certainly could have fooled me.”
The hazel eyes staring up at him kept morphing into an all too familiar piercing blue and the soft curves turned into hard planes. This wasn’t the first time Castiel had crept into his thoughts like this, although it had been a while… basically since that last embarrassing incident. He had dreams: feverish, tangled dreams filled with strong hands and hot mouths. Fiery passionate clawing at each other dominated these fantasies, years of burning need seeking release. The harder he fought it, the more insistent the images. Eventually, he began giving in. Just because he wanted it didn’t mean anything had to change. No one needed to know. So he quietly stroked himself in the middle of the night while Sammy snored or in the shower during his brother’s morning run. It relieved the tension a bit. Cas had done so much already, he could never burden him with this.
This time was bad. It all started in a cheap motel room with peeling wallpaper on a Monday night. Dean relaxed under the hot spray of the shower, thanking whatever powers that be for decent water pressure. Getting knocked around by that damn wendigo earlier left him exhaustingly sore all over. What he needed tonight was a long shower, a shot of whiskey, and at least two bucks pumped into the Magic Fingers. Closing his eyes, he massaged shampoo into his scalp and sighed. He nearly slipped and broke his ass when, out of nowhere, a deep voice called through the moldy, translucent curtain.
“No, Cas. No,” he shook his head in frustration. “You’re going to go out into the room, you’re going to fill Sammy in, and I’m going to rinse off and come out in a minute when I’m not naked and don’t have soap dripping into my goddamn eyes.”
Jerking his head up in surprise, Dean saw Castiel sitting calmly in the front passenger seat, hand behind the bench-seat so he could turn around to greet him. If he had any reaction to the half-naked pair in the back, he kept it to himself. He blinked and waited patiently for a response like this was a completely normal situation. The woman shrieked and slapped Dean hard in the chest, scrambling out from under him. He was frozen, red-faced and stunned.
“Oh?” Dean’s confusion is replaced with curiosity as a dozen scenarios flash through his mind. His pulse quickens as he imagines Cas on his back, legs splayed, whining as he thrusts his perfect cock into the air in frustration.
“I’m so sorry,” Castiel blurts and quickly packs his laptop away. “I forgot that I have an appointment! Just email me your concerns and I promise I will get back to you by the end of the evening.” He’s going to write Dean a LETTER and it is going to be just as clever and direct as he inevitably fails to be in person. And if it doesn’t work, well, perhaps it isn’t in his fortunes... but by god, he’s going to give it his best.
“Me? I would never!” Charlie replies in mock outrage as she glides past him, back out onto the main floor. She flashes him a hidden thumbs up and mouths, “Good luck!”
Studying him appraisingly, Castiel grips Dean’s shoulder. “I am interested in using the restraints again, but a little differently this time,” he clarifies.
His brother's lips curl into a smirk. "It’s what I do." He blows a bubble and lets it pop loudly for emphasis. "It's a hobby of mine." Gabe hands the letter back and hop up onto the table, swinging his legs. “You know,” he muses, “it’s really not ALL bad. I like that ‘undone, unraveled’ part… it sounds kinda sexy in that way too literary way he’d probably dig.”
Ears tinged with pink, Dean tries his best to look unaffected. “What are you talking about, Charlie?” he mutters. Of course she knew pretty much from the start. She’s been teasing him about waiting for “Professor Boyfriend” and drilling him for details on a daily basis.
Dean chuckles fondly. “Trust me, I won’t. But if it would make you feel any better, then it can be on me. Come on... let me indulge that sweet tooth of yours,” he teases with a wink. He deliberately locks eyes with Castiel and slowly licks his lower lip. Right on cue, the professor loses all his composure. Stammering wordlessly, he simply stares after Dean as he goes about making the drink.
Castiel exhales wistfully. "No," he grumbles, his gravelly voice conveying every ounce of frustration. "I made a complete ass of myself again. So I thought... I thought maybe it would be easier if I just wrote something. Remove some variables from the equation.” He winces and looks down at the peeling linoleum. “Actual face-to-face contact seems to be a particularly finicky one."
“Yeah, look… I bet if we put our heads together, we can make this baby shine. You’re just too nervous. If this doesn’t work, I promise you can punch me.”
Charlie beams. “I’m not saying, I’m just saying,” she chimes as she refills the syrup pumps. “Hey, heads up.” Dean looks up to see Dorothy pointing Castiel in his direction. He’s running his fingers through his permanent sex hair, trying to flatten it down, before walking over with a crooked smile. Dean’s breath picks up.
A warm chuckle and a firm hand gripping his left shoulder is all the reassurance he needed. “Do you like it?” Whatever that tingling is, it lazily traces circles along the crest of Dean’s hips, making him shiver.
Castiel zones out, hesitantly fondling the creased letter in his pocket. If he’s going to do this, the time is now. He’ll find a way to rationalize scrapping the idea if he lets himself sit on it for too long. Steeling himself, he slips the folded paper out, chanting encouragements in his head. He’s startled out of his internal monologue by a loud clearing of the throat. Cas is surprised to see Dean nervously rubbing the back of his neck and looking down. If he didn’t know any better, Castiel would swear that he looked shy all of a sudden.
Growling harshly, Castiel arcs his grace through Dean, from that sweet spot up through to the tip of his cock. It courses thick and forceful, full of relentless intent. One final thrust and he shatters, Dean’s name on his lips as he comes. Without restraint, the shockwaves from his orgasm flow through his grace, charging it with unbearable intensity. Pleasure on the cusp of pain floods out over Dean’s entire body, drowning him in a rush of pressure and electricity. Every inch of him spasms as he calls out wordlessly, climaxing all over his stomach.
“Castiel,” the angel corrects firmly. “If I indulge you with the powers of Heaven, I expect to be addressed as an angel of the Lord when you call out my name.”
Thursday brought another city, another case. When chatting up locals at the bar didn’t catch Dean the lead he had hoped for, he decided to call it a recreational night. Sam had already headed back to the motel, wanting to do some online research on local ghost lore and there was a particularly curvy brunette a few stools down clearly interested in what Dean had to offer. A couple of drinks and some meaningless flirtation later, he was pressing her against the hood of the Impala, her legs wrapped around his back.
The tension drops to a simmer as they work out the logistics of the restraints. Dean marvels at how differently this feels from the rough bite of utility rope and purposefully tight knots he’s used to experiencing. The nylon webbing feels deceptively delicate as Castiel attentively binds him. Dean playfully pulls back his wrist just as Cas is about to secure it. Weaving his arm out of the angel’s grasp again and again, Dean laughs until Cas pounces on it with an amused snarl. “Okay, okay you win. I surrender,” he jokes as Cas finishes securing him.
Dean shrugged and let himself collapse on one of the twin beds. “It’s cool, man. I think I need to sleep this off, Cas, but if you wanted to hang around, Sammy could really use some help taking care of a salt-and-burn tonight. He’s getting supplies at the Quickmart right now.”
The blindfold sharpens Dean’s other senses as Castiel eases himself off the bed, off of Dean. He hears soft steps as Cas crosses the room and the appreciative sigh that follows. From the foot of the bed, Dean looks perfect. His muscular arms and thighs are spread wide, exposed, tan flesh completely accessible. A slight sheen of sweat shimmers on his forehead and the anti-possession tattoo stands out boldly against his freckled skin. Castiel aches to lean over and lick the crease where Dean’s thigh met his pelvis, but that isn’t the plan tonight.
But today is going to be different. He nods to himself and sets his shoulders back as he grabs his laptop bag and steps out into the late fall chill. What is it that his brother Gabe always says when he attempts to be encouraging? “Look and act confident and you’ll start to feel confident.” It works most days. Castiel has only been teaching recitation classes for Dr. Shurley a few weeks now and he already exudes the gentle authority that students remember years later. They clearly find him engaging; some actually laugh at his terrible mythology puns. One or two in each class even come to his office hours to confide in him about academic and personal struggles. He’s surprisingly comfortable at the front of the lecture hall, thirty sets of eyes on him for hours. But that bookseller’s sparkling green eyes absolutely destroy him.
