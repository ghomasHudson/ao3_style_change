Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bucky move. He looked up just in time to see Bucky swipe his phone screen… and frown thoughtfully… and then
of counterpoints, suddenly delirious that this might be their chance to shine – that he might finally have a reason to correct all of that.
Steve standing there, with a comically exaggerated bemusement, his arms opened just slightly in a subconscious,
“No, it’s okay,” Steve sighed, opening his door to punctuate the point. “It’s going to take some time, but it’s probably not a good idea for me to sit all alone in my room. Thank you, though.”
“I’ve missed you too,” he whispered, gazing at Tony like he’d been dreaming of him all his life. He was
Tony didn’t feel especially unsafe, even now. He only shook his head because he recognised the response he was
And Tony didn’t even know which part had taken control of his faculties, which part had recognised the seriousness of the situation and which part was able to respond to it-
The elevator came to a soft stop beneath their feet and the doors slid open. Bucky strode out, confidently… and Steve hesitated for maybe half a second. Just enough time to tell himself he was being ridiculous.
At last he opened his eyes, looking up at Tony with a confused, feral panic. Tony felt a plunge of relief - and, again, he wasn’t sure whether it was because this guy wasn’t dead, or just because
. That maybe this sudden vulnerability and anxiety and tearfulness wasn’t the absence of whatever had been affecting him, but another stage of it-
,” Tony replied cheerfully, stepping forward to snatch the keys from Rhodey’s hand. That seemed to snap Rhodey back to his senses.
“So, what’re the jars?” Steve asked, jerking his head towards the little display next to the sink. And, okay, it wasn’t the smoothest transition – but the question did seem to genuinely catch Tony’s attention, and draw them away from that moment, and screw it, that would do.
Steve leapt forward instantly, reaching for where he knew Adams hand was. There was a sharp, disorienting jolt as he crashed into him – Adam swearing viciously under his breath as his phone was thrown out of his grip and sent scattering into the dark.
And, later, Steve would wish he’d been able to put more thought into that. What Tony was really saying, what it would
And he lamented that he had to take his hands off of Steve to demonstrate, but he was having serious problems finding his words. So, he held out his left hand, somewhere down near their waists,
“It does sound less chaotic than trying to break into an unknown tower,” Steve muttered, his gaze fixed on Tony. Tony narrowed his eyes.
“I have one, Rhodey has one, and Pepper has one. In paper form, on the strict instruction that they lock it in an attic…” Tony’s voice slowed as he spoke, trailing off into a heavy pause. Steve could just sort of feel that there was something else.
“Zanipher-Lo.” It was so strange, to hear her speak in an accent he didn’t recognise. A voice that was undeniably foreign, and unlike any on Earth. “People call me Zan.”
“...I don’t know, seems like they’re bothering with a lot of the boring stuff I hate about organising parties,” Pepper mused. “I’m just saying, I hate proofing and printing the itineraries. Nothing ever stays in the centre… and there is no way on Earth I’d bother doing that, if I was going to kill everyone anyway. I’d just… tell them there was going to be an orientation event, or something…”
he’d adopted a completely different persona to make this offer - why he was making this offer at all, seeing as he hadn’t in the first timeline.
He hadn’t expected the chance to relive this memory, and he would never have expected it to go as well as it had - for it to feel exactly as he’d always hoped it would.
on you, or anything,” Tony told him, his tone a little warmer now. Almost teasing. Steve felt his cheeks warm, simply because Tony had guessed what he was thinking – and carried on dressing at the same pace.
And for… however long, he didn’t know, Tony got to just lie there in Steve’s arms, sharing those lazy, messy kisses and smiling at him stupidly and carelessly touching his skin…
“And Nick just said something like, yeah, it’s an aggregate score.” Steve remembered, almost laughing “And I thought, what, is that like a different type of IQ? And he just said that, when you get to
So, still smiling at his own foolishness, Tony reached up to dim the lights, and whispered, out loud,
He felt Tony grind into him, a fierce growl echoing from low in his chest, another searing thrill running up along Steve’s spine. Steve choked out a startled sob, as a sharp heat twisted low in his gut, his cock stinging as he carried on coming, soaking the sheets. And then Tony buried himself inside Steve, he legs still rocking against him as he came.
“You don’t get to pick and choose which things you do on your own, Steve,” Tony replied, coldly. Steve felt it like a kick to his chest. For a second, he was too breathless to answer.
Steve heard himself whimper pitifully, as that heat rolled through him, the sensation pulsing through every fluid inch of him.
thinks it’s one of the other things?” Bucky suggested, at a slightly higher volume. “You don’t think there’s a
This wasn’t the ordinary, human guilt of looking over a disaster he could’ve avoided, or a tragedy he helped to make happen.
The pulse of aftershocks running through him, the sense of calm and relief and happiness that was swelling up in their aftermath
Instinctively, Tony stepped back into the suite as quickly as possible, slamming the door behind him before he looked down at the little package in his hands. That had all happened so quickly, it felt like he’d imagined it…
Steve might’ve lost his footing there, if he weren’t being so careful. He hadn’t seen Tony’s handwriting in so long. Tony almost never wrote with an actual pen – the only times he didn’t rely on holograms and tablet computers were when they were deep undercover, and he didn’t trust the WiFi… or, back in The Tower, if he’d wanted to leave a note in the breakroom. Steve hadn’t seen that erratic, sloping script since
sorry that you don’t feel that way, that you feel this bad for snapping and saying it once – I’m sorry if I ever made you think it would have been better if you’d never woken up, I’m just sorry-”
And the actions of his father had changed him, of course they had. The presence of the worlds media, from the moment he was born. The pressure and responsibility and expectation put on him from such a young age. The traumas that came at the hands of people he’d trusted. All of it had shaped those qualities, and worn parts of him down, and forced him to find ways to dodge and deflect and hide-
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Tony asked, very quietly. And Steve took a deep, steadying breath, pulling himself back up into his shoulders before he answered,
staring at the side of Steve’s head. Steve kept his eyes firmly forward until he heard Janine leave the room.
… But, immediately, Steve liked the idea of Tony taking an interest in his romantic life. He liked the fact that Tony seemed
In a similar warning as I gave before chapters 10 and 11 - it's not that Tony (and Steve) don't say some real things here, that they genuinely mean... but please keep in mind that both parties are high, and that Tony's wording and emotional state are affected by that, and that he's focusing on very specific aspects when he has this breakdown. Much like Steve's earlier (drug assisted) apology, really... Its not that they don't mean any of this, its just that they might not otherwise have put it this way, and it isn't intended as a full and balanced view of things...
“Hey,” Tony smiled back, his eyes warm and happy and strikingly beautiful. His skin was still glowing, and Steve briefly thought to wonder whether,
All smiling with teeth just a bit too sharp. Their reflections are absent in the mirrors around the bar, probably edited out with some sort of technological marvel that Steve will never understand. He laughs when he realizes that Tony has dressed his staff as vampires.
Tony uses his pinky to scroll down, quickly reading the profile JARVIS has forwarded until he reaches the end. Gregory Michaels, 34 years old, rather boring all things said and done—until seven years ago when he was in a traffic accident. After that, he claimed he’d met God, who told him ‘go forth and bring His children to Him’. There were a few arrests for harassment, and then he had fallen off the official radar. JARVIS has compiled surveillance hints of Michaels meeting with a local cult leader.
Steve takes a second to just breathe, his chest tight with worry as he pulls Tony closer. "Okay. But stay behind me and duck if something comes flying at you. No heroics, no jumping in front of people, and no fucking dying. Promise me, Tony."
“It’s a gay bar on 12th and Atwood with an average of 3.5 stars on Yelp,” JARVIS speaks up. “Recently it has been appearing in both police reports and the media in connection to five missing persons cases.”
Claustrophobia is starting to sink into his skin by the time he makes it close enough to see the entrance, where Carol is standing. It only withdraws its claws when she catches his eye and waves. Steve waves back, his breath escaping in a relieved rush as he pushes forward with renewed vigour. Carol glances over at the man she is talking to, then makes her way towards him, parting the crowd in a way Steve can never quite manage.
Steve freezes and tries to put him down, but Tony keeps him in a vice-like grip. There’s no way Tony is letting him run away that easily when he’s this close to getting what promises to be the best night of his life.
“She was going to attack you, and Steve is shit at keeping you away from danger.” The last is said with lethal heat, and Steve shrinks back from her.
“Where’s your mask?” Steve asks Carol, and laughs when she gently smacks his shoulder. Rhodey laughs too, reaching up to touch the edge of his in a way that made Steve suspect that he was not used to it wearing it yet.
Dodging the third call in a row from Pepper, Tony pokes around in his closet until he finds some old jeans with minimal motor oil stains and starts looking for a shirt. The hangers click together with growing intensity as shirt after shirt is rejected. “Do I own nothing but blacks and greys? Why do I have nothing but black and grey… and a cat shirt. Okay, the cat shirt can stay, but where are all the colours? JARVIS, who buys my wardrobe, this is ridiculous.”
“Oh, fuck you,” Tony blurts out while Clint reaches around him to Steve for a fistbump. “I build you a state-of-the-art training room and you think
. That they’re really going back to the tower, where he can actually get Steve over him, or under him, maybe even just against him as they fuck against the wall.
Natasha laughs and heads to put her coffee mug in the sink, while Steve just shakes his head and grins. Tony glares at both of them, snatching the file from Steve’s loose grip. “No respect in this house. Tell him I’m busy, J. I’ve got meetings today, right? Lots of meetings, I’m completely booked all day. I’m even booked this evening, got a hot date at a gay bar.”
Tony stares at her with narrowed eyes. “My body is not for open source consumption. JARVIS, delete any evidence of this off of her phone. Otherwise, I want the royalties.”
He’s assuming here; he has enough evidence to support Steve being focused, thorough, and possessing enough stamina that it makes Tony want to cry. Or beg. He wouldn’t be opposed to either in the right circumstances.
“That's what she said,” Tony crows, jabbing at Steve’s side with his finger. Steve doesn't even flinch, just swats at him while Tony laughs at his disdainful expression.
A knock at the door breaks him from his thoughts; he taps the arc reactor gently before going to the door and flinging it open dramatically. The look on Pepper’s face as she stares at him is gratifying enough that he poses in the doorway until she gathers herself.
. He’s already grinning wildly when he sees the moment it clicks in Steve’s mind that he said something wrong.
Brunnhilde is smirking at him and it makes him realize that his comm is still on. She’s hearing everything.
Tony is not expecting the backhanded swat Steve gives his flank, nor the shirt that plops down on his shoulder.
“That’s rude,” he informs her, and continues before it gets obvious that she still doesn’t have enough manners to apologize for sassing him. “I’ve been working on the schematics for a mesh that will change your facial features into whatever you want, but it’s all theoretical until I can order the material and get into the lab. There wasn't enough time today.” After a few moments he admits, “This is a backup plan.”
“He’s…” Rhodey takes out his phone and taps a few times. “... over in the library with Brunnhilde. Want to go save him before she gets Odin to renegotiate the contract?”
“We need to work on your lying,” Tony informs him, before going back to his coffee. Beautiful, loving, kind coffee that doesn't sass him for no reason.
Steve quickly looks over at Rhodey, uncomfortable, wanting to give Tony privacy while also trying to smother a misplaced sense of betrayal. Rhodey is looking back at him, obviously exasperated.
He pushes forward, shifting his magic to absorb and deflect rather than take the hits at full force. After a few feet, when there's a break in the onslaught, he drops his shield altogether and whispers, "Ventus glacies,” pouring all of his will and magic into the words.
Something catches his attention. It's wrong, something's wrong. There's no thought involved. He pours his magic out into a shield over his back and pulls Tony in against him. It's not a second too soon: a spell crashes into it, almost causing it to shatter.
Pepper must notice the fidgeting, and she draws back to stare at him for a second. “Take this and keep your head still,” she says as she hands him a StarkTab from the side table.
“Just get dressed, Tony.” Steve sits down beside him and grabs a shot, his shirt straining around his biceps. “Your reaction time is slow, maybe you should go back to that gym for a bit.”
“Nope, no take-backs. It’s mine now. Bring on the shots,” he demands regally, then promptly chokes on whatever it is that Natasha sets down in front of him. “I swear, Draino would go down easier than this.”
“Thanks, Pep!” Tony butts in quickly, tosses the tablet onto the couch, and slips away from their conversation. Pepper smiles and waves before she’s back to planning a girls’ night with Natasha, or at least that’s what Tony suspects. Calendars are involved.
She shrugs and gets up to follow them. "There's been a few twinges from the Runes but nothing that's registered as serious."
There’s heat in Steve’s eyes when Tony draws back. A fire that jumps from Steve and straight to the pit of Tony’s stomach. It’s everything he wants, everything he thought he couldn’t have, and it’s being promised in the air that moves between them.
They're both laughing by the time the song ends, but Steve manages to get the basic box step down for both leading and following. They'd even advanced to actually traveling a few feet, but only with Tony leading. The turns were put on hold after Steve had tripped—not just stepped on but actually tripped—over Tony's foot.
It takes a few seconds for Tony to realize something is off, for some primal nagging feeling to make him open his eyes and look around. It’s probably because Steve has stopped creeping his hand upwards towards Tony’s chest, but Steve isn’t allowed to take all of the credit.
Tony shivers, not even caring that Steve has set about giving him hickies high on his neck where he’s not going to be able to hide them tomorrow.
“We’re almost done,” Natasha assures him, this time keeping him still so that he doesn’t turn directly into the path of some sort of pencil. Having so many pointy things near his eyes is nerve wracking, and his heel starts tapping against the floor again.
Tony glances back at him, first with the fires of wrath burning in his eyes, and then it cools into reluctant amusement. “Brunnhilde scares you, doesn’t she.” Tony says. It’s phrased like a question but there’s really no room for argument.
Tony looks like he's thinking about it before he's nodding. "I would never want to cross Carol. Alright, we're going, we're going. Brunnhilde, you're good?"
"It's not dramatics when you're being crushed by over two hundred pounds of muscle." And, okay, Tony does have a point.
Having Steve pressed up against him is heady in a way Tony can’t put into words. He can only lean back with his eyes closed and his fingertips catching on the outside seam of Steve’s jeans. His other hand trails down Steve’s arm until it finds the hand that’s not driving Tony to distraction, and guides it until he can sneak it under his shirt and against his stomach. He presses it there, letting Steve feel his abs work with each circle of their hips.
“Well," Steve starts, but all three of them are distracted by the sound of a fake camera shutter going off.
After some hair bleach and a quick shave that leaves his face disconcertingly bare, Tony is left staring at himself in the bathroom mirror. There’s a feeling of disconnect seeping into his veins, a feeling that he takes with pride. Natasha is going to have to eat her words when she sees him; he’s got this undercover thing down.
“2 o’clock. Man in the back corner by the door. He’s here for something other than a good time, if you catch my drift.”
“I need you to look down... Good, now look up.” he’s told while Natasha tilts his face towards her with cold fingers. It’s a fight not to flinch away, and he mostly succeeds, but after a while his leg gets jittery. Then his fingers start to tap against the couch as he tries to distract himself with planning upgrades—which doesn’t work very well because he needs to write everything down, goddamnit.
He’s been planning a checklist inspired by his Captain America posters ever since he hit puberty, and his sporadic additions over the years have multiplied exponentially since he met and moved in with the real deal. Who knew that super-strength could be so inspirational?
Natasha laughs while Clint groans at the four perfectly lined-up Blow Jobs that he’s made, because if he has to work around the image of sucking Steve’s dick, so does everyone else, goddamnit.
Tony stares at Pepper as she packs up, completely baffled. “What was the point of handing me the tablet?”
Tony swipes over the countertop to shut everything down. “Must be for you guys, to go over your super secret missions.”
Turns out sketchy corner guy is a bust: Jacob Smith, a first timer here who has been admitted to the hospital for a few overdoses and arrested multiple times for drug-dealing. Two hospital visits and one of the arrests coincide with the disappearances, giving him an airtight alibi. Tony leaves him alone for now and starts running through the IDs of current guests while getting JARVIS to cross-reference with past guests as well.
Brunnhilde slowly moves forward towards something on the ground by Sunset’s knee, and kicks it back towards Steve. Sunset tries to lunge for it, finally managing to free herself from the pain and shock she must have been feeling, only to be held back by Brunnhilde.
Steve deflects another sledgehammer of a spell that blasts out a portion of the wall a few metres away. Whoever is doing this has serious firepower, and skill, if they're taking on a Valkyrie while directing attacks at Tony.
“You can feel that with your hands but not in your mouth?” Steve asks, looking momentarily sidetracked.
The mask in Tony's hand glitters in the light as he puts it on. It does match Steve's, with the delicate wires and the makeshift gears, but it's flashier with the gold and hints of red that compliment Tony's suit exactly. Up close now, he can see that the gold threads in the jacket are also intertwining to form gears.
“You’re not exactly subtle, Tony,” Steve says. “Hell, your face is plastered on every second store window. There’s no way you’re going to last even ten minutes undercover.”
“Well shit, that's a science sandwich I want to be part of,” Tony says, and has scramble to avoid a sharp elbow to the ribs. “Hey! Just because you can’t appreciate big brains doesn’t mean no one else does.”
Tony coughs, ignores Steve’s unimpressed look, and taps a sequence into the countertop to start up the built-in computer system. A few more seconds and he’s in SHIELD’s files and making a few ‘minor’ alterations. Steve and Natasha both ignore him, so used to his random bursts of inspiration that they talk over him as he types away.
“Stop calling me that!” she yells, curling her body in over her knees. “You have no right to call me that.”
That Steve lets this happen, and in fact sinks into the touch instead of pulling away, is a major win in Tony’s book—and in his pants, but he’s going to have to take care of that later.
"If I tell you then you drag me to your lab and make me poke at things with magic. That's not in my contract, Tony. You don't pay me enough to put up with that shit."
Steve yanks Tony down by the front of his shirt, wraps one arm around his shoulders, and quickly brings up the other one to reinforce the shield. Magic is all about belief, wherein the actions of the body can strengthen the convictions of the mind.
“In a word? Cold. It was two weeks of cold, wind, and snow, but it really helped me put a few things into perspective,” Steve replies, hooking his thumbs over his belt buckle and relaxing into what Tony fondly calls The Patriotic Power Stance. It kind of reminds him of old Western gunslingers, and isn’t that a thought for him to revisit later.
Natasha starts poking his leg gently with her toes, which he tries to ignore as she talks to Steve. “Welcome back, by the way. How was your vacation?”
"I believe so, Sir. There's slight camera interference when Captain Rogers walks by, but I'm running diagnostics to determine if it's a hardware or software issue."
“Not the most conventional of bar attire, but you can make it work. Actually, I like it. Keep it commando and—”
Tony shudders again and Steve holds him tighter, nuzzling into Tony’s hair along the edges of the mask.
"Here's the man of the hour! I was beginning to worry you were going to stand me up." Tony is grinning brightly until he looks back at the woman. He reaches out to gently touch her knee, eyes soft. "I'm sorry, Sunny. We'll finish talking tomorrow, okay?"
Tony snaps out of his gleeful imaginings of Steve in a mesh top with those abs on display to glare at her in disapproval. This is just the kind of dirty, underhanded trick Natasha uses to con unsuspecting innocents into making fools of themselves. But two can play this game, so he sniffs, “It’s like you don’t even know me. Unlike the Chuck Norris wannabe over there, I can grow this back in a day or two.”
Steve felt the tension ease out of his ribs, his shoulders lowering slowly as one second became two… and then three…
He put them all aside very carefully before, gleefully, he pulled the Photostatic Veil away from his face. Having worn the damn thing to work every day for months, Steve had still never completely gotten used to it, and had spent most of his shifts fighting a temptation to claw at his cheeks. He was very pleased to think that, whatever happened, he would never have to wear that face again.
It was partly that strange compulsion, which had only grown since he first laid eyes on Tony. That hyper awareness, that physical fixation - the first of the eerie, inhuman reactions, and the foundation of Steve’s fear of them.
I want to kick you in your perfect teeth…. I don’t. And it wasn’t fun, even when I was doing it, and it’s been horrible to think about ever since. And, just so you know, I’m sorry for it. I’ll… tell you that properly, when we get home…”
It was such a huge choice to make when he wasn’t in his right mind. When he couldn’t be sure what he was thinking or what he wanted or how he would feel in the morning…
Tony grabbing fistfuls of his hair, whispering that he loved him over and over again, as Steve fucked him right there where anyone could’ve walked in and seen them-
He did acknowledge that he’d not agonised over her death the way he had Tony’s - he even felt guilty for it. He knew that she deserved more than that. Steve would have hated for her to know that he’d simply not had enough despair left over for her, after everything they’d been through.
was an ass, not that you’d think I thought you were,” Steve explained… and Tony had to repeat it twice in his head before he could be confident that there was actually some strange logic in that sentence…
“You know this is exactly what I’m talking about, right?” Steve smiled, softly. And Tony closed his eyes, and pinched his lips, like he wasn’t sure whether he was biting back a smile or a sob. And Steve leant in just slightly, and put his hand to the side of Tony’s face – and Tony’s eyes flitted up to meet his for just longer than a second, like he’d really tried to hold Steve’s gaze, but it just burned too much. And Steve smiled, and shuffled forward, and gently guided Tony’s head to lie on his shoulder-
And Tony knew better than to push it. As much as he still thought Steve should talk about this, he knew better than to try and force him when he was drunk.
Oh, God, it couldn’t go on. He was just going to snap under the weight of this, his heart was going to give out, he was going to suffocate, he-
And then felt his chest begin to tighten again, as he realised how silly and over the top his reaction had been…
. I went off at you, for not tipping me off that there was something more going on, when really, I should have at least considered that for myself, I could’ve
“Yeah…” Tony nodded, as his mind raced ahead to a thousand other questions and possibilities and hypotheses…
And then Tony dropped his head to press a slow, tender kiss to the small of Steve’s back, as he stroked his palms over the curve of Steve’s ass-
“Oh, we’re good” Tony leapt in to answer for Steve – still not able to turn and look at him. “We’re excited, really. It’s just, you know, first time doing… anything like this...” He felt an inch of relief when he saw her nod reassuringly, her lips melting into an understanding smile.
“One day, soon, when you can come home, I’m going to show you so many wonderful things,” Tony promised, his eyes locked on Steve, just watching him listen. “I’m going to take you to beautiful places, and you’re going to experience every pleasure, every happiness…”
Then Tony pointed to Maribelle… no, just in front of that, to the blonde guy standing on the other side of the bar from her… The guy with the Cherry Bakewell shots...
Leaning his weight back against the kitchen counter, Tony closed his eyes and tried to picture a future with Pepper where they could both be happy-
There was a smattering of applause that felt strangely… distant. Like he was hearing it from inside a bubble. It felt slower. Everything felt slower.
it was a bad thing, for Fury to have found something so unknown or so overwhelming that it warranted summoning the Avengers…
“It’s okay,” Steve breathed a shy laugh. “I drank the water in the end. I remember that bit. The, uh,
And the spike of shame that went with it, and the mantra that automatically rolled through his head after it-
“Shall we?” Tony suggested, too enthusiastically, trying to get the guide’s attention again. Thankfully, she seemed to accept Steve’s reaction as simple human shyness. She turned to smile at Tony instead, before leading them back into the corridor.
Even beyond the obvious reason that they were actually run by a bunch of Nazis set on world domination-
“So… You want me to go to Germany to look for a plane?” Steve squinted at him, trying to ignore the prickling discomfort in his gut.
to take Bucky with you on that mission. You didn’t have to take a poorly prepped team of people, some of whom your didn’t know, with no more guidance than
actually have been thrown by that for a moment - just by how moved he was at that level of consideration… Except that Tony moved to straddle his hips, pinning him to the bed between his knees, deliberately grinding down against Steve’s cock as he reached for the restraints-
He could look for interviews and accounts by the first SHIELD agents, see if any of them mentioned Peggy…
And then Steve’s hand was on the small of his back, strong and safe and still somehow tender, pulling Tony close. Tony tilted his head up and let Steve kiss him, soft and slow, gently teasing Tony’s mouth open as Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist-
And, of course, Captain America would say that there was no way they could leave the people of Anni-Vara to suffer any longer. That it would be worth capture, torture, even death, to try and make this right. There was no way Captain America would let a personal crisis, or even the risk of a horrible personal tragedy, stand in the way of doing what was right – which was going to Maribelle’s party. They’d discussed it. The best way they had of learning what they needed to know, and not putting any additional lives at risk, was for Steve to go out tonight. Whatever the risk. Whatever the personal cost.
He felt Tony jerk against him, his body twitching, tightening around Steve’s cock, suddenly just pushing against him, pushing him deeper,
“I mean, unless Operation Rebirth was much more interesting than my dad said it was…” he joked - with the slightest hint of a question in there somewhere. Like he was trying to prompt Steve to speak.
to me – and, yeah, okay, maybe that’s not your fault, and maybe that’s my issue, but fuck it, it’s my fantasy and I’m saying it anyway. Do you know what Steve? I
The rest of his ‘class’ had all been shipped out to various SHIELD departments, and were now furtively leaning against walls in research labs and managers’ offices across the world. Not detention facilities and weapons stores - those were guarded by a higher class of security guard, who probably went on a longer orientation and maybe took the ‘no leaning’ thing more seriously. The people that Steve worked with seemed to recognise where they fell on the paygrade, treating it like any other job, never considering that anything interesting might happen in the departments they begrudgingly patrolled.
now. Like he could take in all those perspectives at the same time, like maybe he could finally lay it all out and weigh it all up, fairly…
because Rhodey had put the idea into his head – that didn’t necessarily reflect anything deeper. It wasn’t a
Tony growled low in his chest, as he slid his hand under Steve’s waistband and curled it around his cock. Steve moaned again at the shock of contact, that immediate pleasure awakening a whole new level of need-
Whatever the reason, it had been days - maybe weeks - since Steve found himself halted by the memory of him…
Tony quietly picking his way through the debris of the night before, tidying away the half empty water glasses and balled up tissues before Steve woke up…
.” And Tony gestured vaguely to where Adam was lying prone, just beside them. “That was incredible. The fact that you
An immediate, physical satisfaction rolled through Tony’s senses. That emptiness in him eased, soothed by a warm feeling of comfort as he sucked slowly against Steve’s cock. The taste of him tingled over Tony’s tongue; it
known his value – and had no power at all. A time when he was not only weak, but poor, and sickly, and unknown…
So, things get fairly heated at the end of this chapter, but we don't *quite* get to the smut yet. Which, on the plus side, means you can probably read this update on the bus. On the downside, yes, I'm a terrible tease
He let go of a long, slow breath as quietly as he could, keeping his gaze focused on the table in front of him while he tried to relax his shoulders. Then he glanced up at the government official at the front of the room, deliberately looking at the wall directly behind her. He’d stopped trying to listen over an hour ago. He’d made a valiant effort up until then, but it was simply no good – his thoughts were determined to go to one specific topic, and it was talking all of Steve’s concentration to stop that from happening.
“That’s for you” She told Steve eventually, with an endearingly proud affect. Tony could see Steve biting back a smile, so that he could answer entirely seriously,
“Well, I guess that depends on what we find when we get there,” Tony panted. “Whatever we have to do to get inside, I suppose.”
“We could just take them with us.” Steve suggested. “Wait and see if we think we need… or if we think that’d be better than whatever we find…”
“Well, yeah, of course I’d love that,” he breathed, as the revelation continued to unfold. “But it’s not just that, it’s… I’ve always been on my own with this, before now… I’ve never even had anyone I could talk to about it, never mind having someone who wanted to help…”
Steve snatched Tony’s wrist, stopping him – he knew he’d come far too quickly, if he let Tony carry on like that.
And then Tony saw Steve’s eye catch on something on the other side of the room, a little smile of a different kind flickering on his lips. Faintly amused, or good humoured, or something.
Steve didn’t even know why he’d snapped, in the end. He honestly couldn’t remember thinking anything, when he finally rose to his feet and marched out of his room without so much as a backward glance. It was more like a chemical reaction finally coming to fruition; the objective moment that everything reached critical mass-
And then, like he was trying to prove that very point, Steve physically lifted Tony onto the countertop in one impatient thrust, his mouth still devouring Tony’s as he pushed himself closer, forcing Tony’s legs apart.
He glanced at his ‘finished’ pile of stacked boxes, and again wondered how many other clues were still hiding in between the accounting records, overlooked while he was daydreaming about Steve…
He had spent the last nine hours trying to take his feelings out of it. That’s all it was. Nine hours of ‘organising his thoughts’ and ‘setting his priorities’ and ‘planning for possible outcomes’…
The kid who knows they’ll get bitched at all evening if their dad’s in a bad mood, so they make sure everything’s perfect when they get in. The guy who thinks it’s his job to sit there and absorb all his boyfriends negative emotions and find a way to fix everything for them. The guy the world blames for not being able to save someone they never put in danger, who they really
“You’re supposed to block,” Steve countered, but it sounded like something else in his mouth. “Get your hands up, come on. See if you can stop me.”
It’s deeply disorienting. He doesn’t like it at all. But it’s better than what he feels when he tries to stand still while Tony walks away from him.
“I did really think we were going to play a few games first,” Tony laughed quietly. Rogers’ eyes opened in shock, something like embarrassment overtaking him, but Tony leaned in and kissed him before he could answer.
Steve waits, still smiling. He watches the way the passing headlights shimmer over Tony’s hair, lighting up the curls in a ripple wave. It almost looks like silk, and Steve desperately wants to ruffle it, but he knows how vain Tony can be about such things.
Tony sighed, brushing the backs of his fingers over Rogers’ forehead to check his temperature. He was much warmer than he’d been before, some of the colour returning to his cheeks, so that was alright then. He looked miles better than he had when they’d first come in.
“I’ve done harder things,” Tony says fiercely, and Bruce tilts his head to meet his gaze. His eyes are sad behind the thick lenses of his glasses.
“My best guess? I’m a woman,” Natasha says. Her mouth quirks slightly. “Also, I don’t process sexual attraction the way most people do.”
“I doubt aeroplane disasters, combat scenes, and a lost love are what you require right now, in your more fragile recovering state.”
Pepper startles when Loki disappears, thankfully without the flashy golden light this time. She glances around the room, as though expecting him to reappear again.
“Bullshit,” Tony says flatly. Pepper is so startled by his outburst that she stops crying. “You killed Obie. You took down Killian. You are Stark Industries, now. Where is this coming from? Do you want a suit? I can make you a suit-”
“Happens that I was invited to Jarvis’ place for a good Christmas Eve dinner, too!” Rogers crowed, as if Tony hadn’t spoken. His voice dipped a little, low enough that they couldn’t be heard over the whistling of the winter wind. The streets were mostly empty, houses lit from within as they traversed the snowy streets, but it was never a bad idea to be careful. “I’m a little hurt, I must say. Do you really think I’d leave you in jail on Christmas Eve? I should like to think you know me better than to think me so cruel.”
“My, uh. You probably noticed my… My heat’s coming up.” Tony clears his throat. “This week, probably.” Or in the next 72 hours. Whatever.
"He's over a thousand years old. I don't take it too personally." He pauses. "Then again, Thor's supposed to be the big bad brother. I can see why Loki would get fussy about playing second fiddle, there. God, imagine Thor as president."
“Dandan noodles,” Tony said, already digging in. “They’re really spicy.” He grinned, licking his lips. “I love Sichuan so much. Most of the food in the city is Cantonese, because that’s where the majority of the immigrant population comes from. What most Americans think of as Chinese food is incredibly limited. It’s like if everyone thought apple pies, fried curds, and corn dogs were the epitome of American cuisine because all the restaurants were State Fair theme. Well, that’s not fair. Cantonese food is actually pretty healthy, and definitely better than corn dogs. Sichuan is the spicy, oily stuff. But damn is it good.”
Loki glances between him and Steve for a moment, expression unreadable. Then he dips his head, disappearing in a blinding flash of gold. Interesting. Tony files that away for later, then turns to Steve.
Steve puts his hands on his hips and looks out at the water, letting his breath his out in a long, low whistle. The sunrise has mostly finished showing off, but there’s the barest bit of golden glow everywhere that makes the whole scene look somewhat surreal. It’s as good a time to say it out loud for the first time as any. “I finally took Natasha’s advice.”
Tony’s mouth closes. A terrifying, twisting pain is snarling up in his throat. He does his best to clamp down on the sob that wants to break out of his chest.
“Don’t shut me out,” Steve says, softer now. Tony swallows, glances away. “If I’m not saying the right things, explain it to me.” Tony’s mouth twists, and Steve cuts whatever cruelty is building there off at the knees. “I’m sorry I hit you, I should have never without the suit. It’s not an excuse, but Amora really rattled me up. It won’t happen again, and if it does I will gladly let Pepper kick me out.” Tony snorts. “Nobody can get me worked up like you can, Tony. Those things that you said…they hit something in me, from when I was a kid.”
He’d never been addicted to anything. Between growing up with an alcoholic father, living in poverty, and his own sickliness, addiction had never really been in the cards for him. After the serum, it was near impossible for most drugs to even work on him, without complex calculations that really only Tony, Bruce, and a handful of SHIELD personnel knew the ins and outs of. But despite all that, this was what he imagined addiction felt like. He knew that spending time with Tony was torturous, but still he couldn’t help initiating it. He felt like one of Iron Man’s sobbing fans, begging for any scrap of attention that he could get, or worse, one of the omegas that panted after Tony at parties like they had any chance with the man.
“Don’t sass me,” Tony says drumming his fingers on the edge of the table. “Jesus, am I that much of a mess?”
When bonded pairs were planning to be separated for any significant length of time, the medically sound decision was to take suppressants for the length of the separation. When Steve was young, in the early days of the war, the military preferred to take unbonded alphas. Historically, unbonded alphas had always been prized for battle. They were considered the most brutal and aggressive soldiers, and natural leaders. The theory was that they fought harder because they still had something to prove, unlike bonded alphas who had already secured a mate. Such thinking was antiquated, but it was only when things began to get dire that the U.S. government had decided they would take just about anyone. Omegas staffed the factories. Betas were allowed to lead units on the front lines. Some omegas were even allowed to serve as nurses out in the trenches, if they were bonded to someone in the service. Looking back, Steve was sure that many omegas had done what he did at the behest of the military; taken suppressants, found access to some illicit alpha or beta pheromones, and gone out to the front lines to fight. There were even a few documented cases, soldiers who had come out after the war during the height of the omega rights movement in the 70’s. Steve’s favourite accounting was a famous story of an unbonded omega, Nieves Fernandez, who had gone into heat without access to her suppressants while being held in a Japanese war camp, sending the entire camp into a frenzy. In the ensuing chaos, fifty prisoners were able to escape and make it to safety, including the solider who’d gone into heat. She’d been captured after leading the guerrilla resistance against the Japanese in her native Philippines for the better part of four years. Fernandez finally received some kind of medal for it in the 70’s, years after her dishonourable discharge. She was grinning fiercely in the photos, her arms wrapped around President Jimmy Carter’s shoulders in a hug. The alpha’s expression in the photo where they were shaking hands was tender and full of joy.
“You could leave, at any time. You’re not what he made, not really, not anymore. You’re your own person now.” He smiles a little, melancholy. “That’s what Tony loves about you, most. And also about himself, I think. That he made something so extraordinary. But you choose to stay, to take care of us, even though you could do anything you wanted. Really, anything.”
“Now murder is of course a cardinal sin, so even if it’s part of your job as a soldier, I think we’ll set you to a corporal work of mercy for every life you’ve taken since your last confession. At least one hour.”
“I was a soldier before I was a superhero, Miss,” Steve said evenly. He pulled the cowl back over his face. “You hear that, Avengers?”
“Yes,” Tony says. He presses a kiss to Steve’s jaw, his collarbone, the smooth skin above his heart. “Steve.”
Tony is elbow deep in machine oil and grease when the tower alert for a bifrost deposit starts up. His last suit had gotten trashed in an AIM scuffle, more for numbers than any sort of skill on their part, but it still meant the same amount of repairs. Honestly, Tony was tempted to tell SHIELD they all needed a break and not to bother them with stupid shit, but he knows that Hulk and Cap both get restless with nothing to do. With Loki seemingly out of the fun and nuisance racket, they had to settle for the more boring calls.
Steve grips Tony’s wrist with punishing force. He presses his face to his palm hard, rolls his head back and forth against Tony’s dry, calloused skin. He takes his free hand and presses his palm over Tony’s heart, and taps the only thing he can think to say into his skin.
“That line was old when I was young,” Steve says, rolling his eyes. Tony grins like he knows exactly what Steve said. Maybe he does. It makes the kiss awkward, filled with too many teeth, but Steve revels in it anyway. He presses close, rumbles a low groan when Tony gets a hand up into his hair. He pulls Tony flush up against his body.
“In case you forgot, this is my actual fucking day job, and it’s what funds our little jaunts out into the world to spar with alien sorcerers in ridiculous costumes. I know you’ve never really experienced money on the scale I operate at, but I promise you what I do is actually very important and my time, since you seem to think that I owe you
The truth is, Tony never fell in love with Steve Rogers. Tony Stark has always been in love with Steve Rogers. He doesn’t remember a time when Captain America didn’t loom over him, cornflower eyes and hair like wheat, like he was birthed from the rolling open fields of the country’s farmland. Steve Rogers was the hero crush of a boy who was so alone it ached, lonely seeping into his bones like winter cold and staying there, low pain and numbness.
It’s the wrong thing to say, because it changes the set of Steve’s jaw from placating to stubborn. That’s alright; Tony’s been ready for a fight. He kind of wants it, in fact.
“Miss Potts did not predict longevity being the end result of a monogamous relationship with Sir. Wisely, I think,” JARVIS says, when Steve has been silent long enough. “Does that answer your question?”
,” Tony hissed, one hand slipping around Steve’s waist. His grip felt sure and strong as an iron bar, trapping him there, and Steve could feel his stomach tense under Tony's grasping fingers. “Jesus, you’re…wow. Okay.”
“Oh God,” Rhodey mutters under his breath. Tony can appreciate the sentiment; he badly wants a drink.
Loki raises his eyebrows and laughs, dry and mocking. It cuts Tony like a seashell, warm sand soft under bare feet until suddenly, the flash of danger. He’s acutely aware of his fine Martin Greenfield suit, of the leather shoes and lack of metal to protect his vulnerable heart. The metal cuffs to call the armour are skin warm against his wrists.
When he opens his eyes, his hands are holding Tony tighter than he meant to. The vicious satisfaction on his face almost pushes Steve over again, but he can see the tremble of pain underneath it. He looses his grip, takes a breath. Then another.
“I’ll never forget leaving you when you needed me the most. You in that stupid, dirty room, so far from where you belonged. I was too weak-”
“No,” Strange is sneering at Spidey, “what Tony needs is a psychological professional. I cannot believe you are entertaining this behaviour-”
“You planned that pretty well, then,” Tony laughed, and his eyes were shining, bright bottle-glass in the spotlights. A few people whooped their agreement. “I don’t think anyone in their right mind is gonna fight Captain America for me.”
“So,” Sam pants up at him when he slows to a final stop, “what’s your game plan? Not that I don’t like getting my ass whooped, keeps me humble.”
“Give him time,” Strange says, quiet. “We just got Steve back, and then…” He sighs. “It’s no wonder that he’s…struggling. He’s been through a lot.”
“Yes, please,” Thor says, turning back to Tony. His face is grim. “I would say this news only once.”
“Tony,” Steve panted, and then his tongue was there, and Steve’s cock was pressed between his stomach and the sheets, and Steve came again.
Steve touches him like he’s something precious and breakable. Tony should be used to this, but he never quite manages it. Instead it just reduces him to this: misty eyed and trembling like a new-born fawn in the warm circle of Steve’s arms.
to be lost. I should have tried harder. I could have talked to Coulson, or gone and tried to talk to the NIA-”
Loki’s eyes flash, then, bright gold and dangerous. The portal snaps shut, fast enough to send a shockwave rippling outwards, the wash of energy making all the hairs on Steve’s arms stand on end. It sends an unpleasant ripple through him, just enough of a distraction for Loki to take two dangerous steps into Tony’s space. The height difference between them looms large, and Steve presses an instinctive hand to Tony’s shoulder even as Thor moves forward, his own hands hovering near Loki’s arms.
As soon as he’d held the ring in his hands, gold titanium alloy inset with a single round ruby, any doubts Steve had held before fled like shadows from the midday sun. His anxieties about Tony’s SI date had lessened as well. The band was smooth, the stone set back so that nothing stuck out to catch on the armour or get in the way of Tony working. He knew that Tony would probably have to take it off with regularity; all of the factory workers Steve had known had kept their rings on a chain. So Steve had bought a sturdy chain, too, coiled up in the bottom of the box under the little ring pedastal.
Tony tilts his head to look at her over his sunglasses. "It was just the minions. What kind of superhero would I be if I couldn't take out minions with minimal damage?"
“Don’t like Stark Raving Hazelnuts,” Steve said, pouting, and Tony laughed at him. “We agreed. Double Dark Chocolate.”
“Tell us where,” Natasha said, taking Steve gently by the elbow for the barest breath before pulling back again. None of them said anything about what Tony’d likely been through for the better part of three weeks. It didn’t really need to be said.
“It makes me uncomfortable that I didn’t notice you getting into bed, but that’s me being mad at myself,” Tony says, too close to sleep for anything but brutal honesty. He pads to the bathroom and turns on the tap, washes his face of sleep sand and the accumulated oil that somehow always appears on his skin after too long sedentary. Eventually, Loki pads into the bathroom, swathed in Tony’s Egyptian cotton, hair a tangled mess.
“Tony,” Steve barks, pushing himself to his feet. Then he thinks better of it, turning around, because Tony’s bent over to put on his briefs.
“I don’t think Cap is upset at Loki for the reasons you’re expecting,” Tash says, smirking at him, and Steve ducks his head. He can feel the thin skin of his ears pinkening.
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. He takes a slow, deep breath. “I don’t want to be a burden to you while you’re working, Tony. If my being there would help you, I’ll come. But if I’ll just be in the way, then I don’t have to. I can’t tell what you want; you have to tell me.”
Steve smiles and ducks his head a little bashfully, feeling like a chastised schoolboy. It’s not inappropriate in these circumstances. “I understand what you’re saying, really,” he says, glancing up at Xavier nervously. “But if it’s all the same to you, Professor, I’d like for you to do whatever you need to do to make sure Amora doesn’t still have a hold on me. We can do it your way from there, but that’s really why I’m here.”
Tony grins, and grinds his hips forward, rocking into Steve until he’s groaning loud, his whole body one long line of gasping pleasure. Tony fits his fingers over Steve’s obliques, his abdominal muscles, the pebbled skin of his nipples. Every inch of him is gorgeous, and he’s Tony’s, now. Or maybe he’s always been.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick. All the times he’d begged for Tony, told him how much he loved his cock…
Bruce blinked at him. “What makes you say that?” There was no offence in his tone—just pure, scientific curiosity.
“I like them,” Tony had told him, but Steve had just shook his head, pressing tender kisses to Tony’s thighs, his hip.
“I’ve been out since 1987,” Tony tells him, rolling his eyes. “I’m a mess. You know it. Everyone knows it. I’m an alcoholic. I’m a whore.”
“Hush,” Tony says. He kisses Steve’s chest, right over where his heart should be. “I called Stephen because I wanted you to not have to feel like this. Nothing happened.”
"Most of us have done terrible things," Nat says mildly. She's looking at Steve, and Tony knows he's thinking of a certain soldier buddy of theirs. Steve stares back at her for a long moment before he exhales, nodding. He trains that infamous piercing gaze on Tony.
Steve just moaned in response, the sound garbled in his throat. He couldn’t breathe, and his head was spinning with it, and it was so, so good.
, does that flush Tony all the way up to his ears. He knows it doesn’t show, but his face feels like he could light a candle off it.
The truth was, Steve's heart was a lightweight. It made him do stupid things. Things like thinking about walking up to Loki in Tony's ridiculous, gorgeous library and asking him, "Are you serious about Tony?" and expecting a straight answer.
with no repercussions. Not even an official inquiry. It was covered up by the U.S.A.F.. I could find you wherever you are, no matter where you go. In this
He settles into the armour with a relieved sigh, the cool metal much gentler against his slick skin than the rubble-scattered ground. He gets his tentacles aligned into the legs, four each, then lets the armour close up around him.
“Hungry, baby?” he tries, smiling helplessly when Loki snuffles and buries his face further into Tony’s chest. “What do you want to eat?”
Steve studies him, his brow wrinkled in the same way it does when he’s considering new intel. He drops his eyes to Tony’s tentacles, then slides his hand down one, a single fingertip tracing one thin ribbon of gold as it undulates across Tony’s skin. The noise that escapes Tony’s throat is indecent, and he bites his lip hard to stifle it. He pulls his tentacles away from Steve’s body, curling them back around the legs of the chair.
“Where is Thor?” the woman snarls. Thick, blonde hair falls to her waist in soft waves, framing a beautiful, angular face and high cheekbones. She’s draped in lush greens and golds, a horned headdress framing her face, and Tony taps a metal finger on his chin. Behind him, he can hear footsteps, and he relaxes a bit knowing he’s no longer alone on the roof with a magic wielder. Again.
“Shh,” Tony murmured, and his knot was releasing. Steve could feel it, the wetness dripping down his skin. “I have you.”
“Well,” he says, “depends on what he was sore about.” He doesn’t even know Tony’s dynamic, but in almost any circumstance, he can see how that could be a bad thing.
“And I loved every minute of it,” Steve said, letting his eyes drop to trace over Tony’s body, lingering on his cock until it twitched under his gaze. He licked his lips, and Tony laughed outright.
Walking around in the future is like being a horse with blinders on. He is only able to get the faintest top-notes from most people’s scents, and he suspects that’s only because of the serum. Everyone wears blockers now, not just people close to their heat or rut. It’s like one of his senses had been completely excised from him as he slept. He has no idea what anyone wants from him. Steve is no good with words, unless he’s giving a speech. He’s floundering blind in a new world with no anchor, no pack, and a soulmate that can only barely stand to be in a room with him without shying away like a skittish horse.
So they’d ended up fucking, because apparently Captain America always being prepared meant carrying lube when you were going to confront the man you were in love with about why he was being so shifty recently.
“Salt,” Tony blurts out, and Steve blinks. “Fancy organic sea salt. We have plenty in the kitchen. JARVIS, calculate how much we need and help our dear captain out, would you?”
“Hush,” Rogers said, but he was laughing now as he pulled Tony out into the cold street. The shock of it was enough to sober him up a little, and he blinked bemusedly out into the darkness.
“Thank you, sir,” JARVIS says warmly. Tony clears his throat, reaching for the towel. “You should leave in twenty minutes to get to your meeting on time.”
“Sorry,” Tony says, waving a hand. “I digress. My point is, Steve probably didn’t even know he was flirting.”
“I like my pies a little past the brim. Make a mound,” Clint says, and Tony shrugs. He can get behind that. “Look, forget about the team or what Steve might feel or not feel or whatever the hell else anyone is telling you. What do you, Tony Stark, want? Really want? That’s the question you gotta answer, man.”
“We’ve gotta get better at this,” Steve says. He blinks once, twice, and his eyes glitter a little too wet now that Tony’s looking. “I don’t… I don’t want to ruin this. And it wouldn’t be just us, Tony. The team-”
. It was still so awful when you laid it out like that. “They have, unfortunate as it is, never truly had a chance at a civilian life. You, on the other hand, attended art school, graduated, and began a career in illustration before you joined the military. You had a mother who loved you, and something like a brother who you fought alongside in the war. You just may be the only one of the Avengers who understands how unusual the life you now lead is, simply by having a point of comparison.”
, congratulating himself when Steve steps back a little. “You’re nothing but a burnt out shell, lashing out at anyone who gets close to you. It’s no wonder Loki’s taken a shine to you. You’re both feral animals, biting at the hand that feeds.”
Tony goes into the bathroom to perform his nightly ablutions, and Steve crawls into bed, smiling a little at how decadent the sheets are. He’s never slept here before, and this wasn’t exactly the scenario he’d imagined when he thought about being here for the first time.
Shuri stares at him for a moment, before laughing quietly and going back to her display. “You’re lovers,” she says, casually, as if that isn’t the
Go out there and act like Captain America. Ignore the churning guilt, avoid talking about anything personal, focus on getting the job done.
But, before he could get too carried away with that line of thought, Pepper appeared in the hallway in a flurry of arms and agitated noises.

Steve’s head snapped upright. Still lightheaded and confused, it took him a second or two to pick the shape of a man out of the shadows at the back of the room-
just hoping to take these medicines elsewhere, or replicate their effect with substances of their own… but, when they grew frustrated with that, they turned their attention to researching how else they could be adapted
He opened the final cabinet, his eyes immediately drawn to the flash of bright yellow in the corner. Focused on it and only it, until he had

just a few happy memories, a handful of moments that made him smile… a few reminders of why he liked human beings, a chance to see it for himself.
“So where are we going?” Steve questioned, as he tried to bring the details of that particular project to mind.
And then he saw the way Tony’s face changed. The way it softened slightly, his lips parting and his eyes widening…
...Even from this distance, he knew that he didn’t recognise any of the vehicles moving along the busy streets… he didn’t recognise the
“I surprised you?” Rhodey repeated, narrowing his eyes. When Tony just shrugged at him, he was forced to guess, “you been up all night?”
of banishment to a mystical realm. Schmitt’s story was from the world of ancient Greek myths and Roman Gods, his experience was outside the limits of human understanding. Different in a way that Steve as a mere mortal couldn’t even describe.
“No one is going to know who killed Captain America,” Stape said, his voice moving higher in his chest, the gun trembling more obviously in his hand.
Because, on a deeper level, he’d always been scared to commit to certain thoughts and feelings and personal traits… in case he needed to deny or ignore them, later.
, Steve’s passionate outburst had been about something else entirely. Maybe Steve had developed a crush on the idea of Tony, out of his own loneliness. Maybe he’d mistaken a sense of gratitude and relief over Bucky with a genuine affection. Maybe he was just attracted to Tony, or
And then a low curl of white hot pleasure ground through his hips, briefly overwhelming all that tension, washing the resistance out of him as it rolled up along his spine. Steve fell weak against it, as Tony pressed the tip of his tongue harder against his rim, pushing deeper into him, sending more and more of those little eclectic shivers up through his softened muscles…
It was a freedom that just continued to dawn on him, as they made their way to the bedroom. As he remembered more of the fears that didn’t apply anymore, more of the things he

that he made Steve happy like this, more right than anything he’d ever done before… It was something ancient and fundamental and...
…” Tony answered, pointedly, “that it might be worth checking out that massive tower at the edge of the city. And I was thinking it would be easier to slip away, if we went to something that was in that general area…”
He tossed the pen aside and watched it roll under one of the shelving units, knowing that no one would think anything of a stray pen even if they were to find it, frostbitten and useless, in a few years time.
God, that had seemed such a good idea a few hours ago. Now it made Tony’s whole being seize in terror, like some primal part of him was warning him,
So, eventually he simply let himself trail off into silence, and waited – not sure anymore whether he was hoping to get out of this conversation or dearly hoping that Tony would carry on.
Selvig raised his eyebrows in a harmless, teasing gesture, having recognised the suggestive the tone in Steve’s voice.
“But yeah, I wouldn’t have said it quite like that, if I’d known – and I should’ve known, that…” Tony sighed, and tried to order this in his head. “Well, for a start, I want to apologise for how… unfairly done, all that was, and… for the fact that I only did it that way because I assumed you didn’t care about any of it, which is kinda what I’m trying to apologise for in general”
Tony slapped the work desk in frustration, hard enough to make his palm sting. God, it was like having a bad High School Forensics team in his head, squabbling over philosophical concepts that had no place in the real world-
“…I’m making you a cup of tea,” she decided – and Tony’s whole body weakened in sulky resistance, like a petulant teenager.
That heat grew, spreading through the small of his back. His cock throbbed hard, as all of his fantasies of the last few days came back to him.
Clint?” Tony repeated in a sing-song voice. Steve felt his hands ball into fists of their own accord, the blood boiling in his ears. God, if he could’ve hit him-
“And?” Tony asked. Steve hesitated, a questioning frown creasing his brow. “What did you find out, when you looked it up?” Tony clarified. Steve’s shoulders slumped again.
An idea that seemed far too perfect in the first instance… That seemed to grow more satisfying the more he considered it…
Tony began to realise that he was straying into a topic too deep for the moment. That this was in fact the root of a whole host of things he had to say to Steve – things that he should put some serious thought into first. Because Steve deserved that too. This was something he would have to say properly, another time… But, right now, he really wanted Steve to know,
b) Whether this DOES end up as balanced in the end, or if perhaps it DOES still merit a 'TeamTony' tag, or a 'Steve Friendly' tag or whatever... As I say, I've attempted balance here, but I know I have my own biases and, for various reasons, there are elements that don't even get discussed here (Team Steve aren't *there* to answer any of the points Tony makes about them, for example, and they rather dance around The Accords...) So, I'd really appreciate input on this. More than anything I'd like to ensure it's accurately labelled, so that people can choose whether its something they want to read.
or anything - well, except for when I’m making a ridiculous effort to… to… well, at the time it feels like I’m trying to help. Maybe I’m just trying to make myself important to him…” And then he gave his head another shake, more irritably this time, like he was losing patience with himself. “I’m just saying - it’s not his fault if I can’t be the one to help him. And it’s not his fault that I want to, or that it hurts me that I can’t. And it’s not his fault that everything I try to say to him either makes him nervous or angry, even now… And it’s not his fault if he thought about telling me, and didn’t
Eventually that feeling overwhelmed him, and, in a moment of reckless exhilaration, Steve decided to just throw his arms around him. As Tony was still talking, Steve stepped behind him and wrapped his arms over his stomach, letting his head rest in his hair…
“Who’re you?” One of the guards demanded – which told Tony that they weren’t the type to shoot first and ask questions later. Either they were scared to do something so drastic, or felt a simple human reluctance to take a life…
His head had been mostly quiet, for however long they’d been lying here. Occasionally, a lazy thought would stroll through the void, and sometimes Tony would consider it, and sometimes he would simply let it float by…. And sometimes he’d say it out loud, just because he could.
clinging to the hope that he could side step this, “and I thought I saw it in your notes, and I… Overreacted, and I don’t even know what over, and I’m sorry…”
“Not if you use it right.” She answered, almost dismissively “I just mean – you have to promise me, you won’t leave him
And then Steve gasped, his eyes flashing briefly with something like anxiety, his forehead still pressed to Tony’s and trying to mouth a silent question…
Tony immediately slumped against the closest wall, letting his eyes fall shut as Steve shouted a surprised little ‘
And then he made himself look at Steve again. His eyes soft, and full of some hard-to-place emotion that was somehow reassuring.
Steve outright screamed, throwing himself forward in a desperate attempt to get to him. And then he heard Bucky gasp and stopped on instinct, turning just in time to see him drive his fist into the top of the examination table – breaking clear through the surface in a screech of tortured metal. Steve’s professional instincts kicked in and he immediately moved to contain the situation, running to get behind Bucky and pin both of his arms behind his back.
“And, if they hate us, why wouldn’t they have just killed us?” Bucky added, “Or, I don’t know, pushed us into a hole full of bees or whatever - it’s not like any of us have been putting up a fight.”
He really didn’t want to have to think about this, right now. He couldn’t bear to think that this might delay him getting home.
he didn’t want to talk to Pepper, or what that said about their relationship, or any other deep and unrelated questions.
“A black-market drug company, or possibly chemical weapons manufacturer, have kidnapped Steve and Bucky,” he replied, eerily calm and level, like he was reading a prepared statement. “And either some of these people used to be Hydra, or they’re working from Hydra’s notes, but either way, I’m getting him out of there.”
it was never going to work. And when a second troop came, and we had to subdue them too – and by now my D
He pushed himself up on his arms – as much as he could, into the little space Steve had left between them – doing his best to shrug his way free of his clothes. Eagerly. Desperately. Steve was pushing the shirt back over Tony’s arms before he’d even torn the last button off, caressing his hands over Tony’s shoulders, digging his fingertips into his muscles. Kissing the side of Tony’s face, messy and desperate and uncontrolled, and then his neck, and then the newly exposed skin of his collarbone and shoulder blade. Tony panting and swallowing and trying to decide between grabbing at Steve and getting his shirt off.
been inside for twenty years?” Sam blurted, to no one in particular. But Tony didn’t waste time asking himself whether it was a real question or not – his head was already a minute ahead of his body, and still stuck in that dismissive, auto-respond mode.
And, as ever, apologies to anyone whose comment I've not had a chance to reply to - please know I read and cherish every one of them, and will be responding to all of them next week, when I'm off work (woohoo!)
Steve frowned, and repeated the sentence in his head… but just when he was about to tell Tony that he didn’t get it, he felt Tony shift beneath him. It took him a moment to realise that Tony was making an awkward grab for the gym bag, still sitting at the side of the bed, and by the time he’d worked it out Tony had already pulled a large white envelope from the side pocket.
And, actually, as they ran up the stairs Tony started to think they were going to get away with it. The feeling on his skin didn’t grow as they reached the landing, the way it had the night they’d been invited to the third floor. He didn’t find it hard to concentrate, while he worked on breaking the security code on the next set of doors. There wasn’t a sudden surge of euphoria or panic when they slid open, no strong smell, no physical reaction… Just a normal swell of relief, thinking that maybe the patches did work up here too, that maybe they’d just be able to get in and out after all.
But Belle arriving had woken Steve up. And, when Steve realised she was talking to them, he sat up… leaving a cold feeling on Tony’s legs and all through his stomach…
to keep the world safe from this threat. That the reckless, shortsighted opportunism of his own side had rendered all of his sacrifices meaningless, and it was perfectly reasonable that he should resent that. That Nick should be embarrassed to ask him to fix this…
He felt Tony pull out of him, but Steve couldn’t open his eyes, or couldn’t focus his vision… he couldn’t tell which.
Zan had told them to be at the party by nine – although, from what they could tell from her activity on the computers, she probably wouldn’t be able to slip away until at least ten.
files make reference to chemical warfare against the local population.” He pointed vaguely in the direction of the file reader, which he’d thrown on the couch. “And, if the third floor is actually their ‘lab conditions’ then it would only make sense for the staff to be able to upload their data direct from there, or look up technical details while they were in the lab, right?”
like he understood how everything worked… But if that wouldn’t stop him calling Steve, nothing would. It was all he could do.
“Everything I said, before…” Steve clarified, increasingly anxious. “And… I don’t know, what you want to happen now…”
“No, stop, I’m going to die,” Tony panted helplessly, laughing without sound now, one hand pressed tenderly to his rib.
He had no reason what-so-ever to think that the ‘consort effect’ was anything like that. He didn’t actually know what a consort
“What guy you’re in love with?” Rhodey demanded, clearly getting carried away. “What, Steve?” And then he saw Tony flinch, and caught himself.
, since you arrived – which is, of course, entirely normal. But still. Nice to think you may be settling in.”
would get killed, if you didn’t. I did the same thing that you did for Bucky, when you went in to get him yourself in Bucharest, rather than let the army do it. That’s what they pilloried me for. And if you want to say, that’s them, not me – go on then,
Steve felt his mouth just dry up. His heart started pounding in his ears, so hard it was difficult to hear her over the top of it.
“You are feeling sleepy, very sleepy…” Tony joked, mindlessly, after he finally injected the anaesthetic. Mocking the stereotypical hypnotists from every Bugs Bunny cartoon. Bucky snorted a laugh, but already it sounded heavy and distracted, as he fell softly into sleep. Tony let his eyes rest on Bucky for a few moments more than necessary. Gearing himself up for what had to happen. Practicing his dialogue one last time.
“Well, yes,” Tony conceded, in a slightly softer tone. Closer to the voice Steve remembered. “Although, as an aside, we
He lost a moment, in a flurry of light and noise and dismembered voices – he could hear Steve yelling, but not the words. He could feel Steve moving him… He could feel hands against his back…
And, in fairness to him, the last three weeks had proven him right. Not only was Tony happier now than he’d been when he was panicking over the relationship, Tony was literally happier right now than he’d ever been in his life. It had been so easy to
“And, for what it’s worth…” He went on, eventually “You’re not the only one who let emotion and drugs and a few… previous misconceptions… twist what might otherwise have been a good point. When I had you chained to a bed,
“Sorry, I didn’t – I don’t know why I said all of that. I’m sorry.” Steve babbled, dropping his eyes. “Don’t we have a… an, alien…planet card, or whatever it was? Could we just ignore that please?”
“Good boy,” Tony smiled, throwing the bottle aside before he brushed a fingertip over Steve’s jaw. Steve lifted his chin obligingly, letting his head fall back as Tony pressed an ice pack over the bruise on his throat. Even the shock of that felt muted, wrapped in the warm blanket of sleepy contentment…
“Hm? Oh, nothing really,” Rhodey shrugged. “I was just wondering if you wanted to go grab some lunch, now that you’re back in the country?”
“I apologise, sir. But you were quite clear that I should inform you of any changes to Sergeant Barnes’ condition” JARVIS reminded him, diplomatically. “Specifically, you asked to be informed when the general anaesthetic wore off.”
But he absolutely knew, on that desk, in amongst all the meaningless clutter, there was a tube of silicone oil-
planning to stay here, and what the hell he was going to do with that time. He expected there to be an onslaught of images, an impossible number of beloved memories that he wanted to revisit.
“Why, who's following you?” He demanded protectively, stepping forward to put a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony’s fraught expression softened briefly, the hint of a smile threatening to break through… And then he gave his head a little shake, and deliberately straightened his back.
He might not get the outcome he wanted. It might mean any number of things to factor into his plans. It might end up being something he regretted, or something that forever hurt him, or something he saw completely differently one day…
kind of way. It wasn’t any of the… uh, the normal kinds of creepy. It wasn’t being smug or vindicated or excited… It felt
Tony bit his lip, a different sort of discomfort fizzing up in his skull. Without realising it, he’d slipped from a shapeless emotional spiral into an irritating internal debate with himself-
Tony considered him for a moment, while he lined up all his data. He could tell that Wesley was both unnerved and offended that Tony had looked into his past - and clearly too much of the former to fully express the latter…
their interactions – even the good ones. Tony couldn’t help but recognise that this was definitely a goal for Steve, that he’d successfully disarmed one of Tony’s potential arguments against him… That he was still counting points.
So, instead, he had selected one of the more mundane ideas that had occurred to him, deliberately choosing somewhere that
Tony gave his head a shake, and drew in another long, shuddering breath. He was still too keyed up to unpack deep thoughts like that… But, still, he recognised the warmth that pooled inside him, as he let those supposedly unrelated memories slip through his head.
Steve huffed angrily at himself as he bent to retrieve the ball. He was trying very hard to pretend that his professional pride hadn’t been hurt by this. That,
And then Steve threw one arm up so that he could grab a fistful of Tony’s hair, pulling Tony’s head up as he moved to suck a dark, purple mark to the side of his throat-
From Bucky’s perspective, the time between the wars had been vague and movable, a constant progress of the years at too fast a pace, seen through eyes that weren’t his own and remembered in his own nightmares… To Bucky, the first snap was just over a week ago.
But Steve didn’t dare look away from the trolley – the row of syringes, glinting ominously under the strip lighting.
Thinking about it, maybe this was more hurt than anger. Either way, it made Tony want to hit something.
And then Tony slowed his pace just a little, moving to stroke both of his hands over Steve’s hips more deliberately, shifting his weight before he buried himself into Steve again. He hit Steve’s prostate, rolling his pelvis into him before he pulled back, more slowly. Steve let out a howling moan as the shock of it jolted through him, his balls drawing tight and cock throbbing sharply. A sudden burst of almost painful intensity that burned out into a needy physical hunger.
“So, I don’t know,” Steve sighed, sadly. “It might be a whole lot easier to find one, now that you’re helping… I mean, I know that Stucker and his team relocated to a place in Sokovia,
He poured himself a glass of water while he waited for his coffee to brew, and was pleasantly surprised by how instantly soothing it was. For a few moments, he found he really
Instead, he’d detailed the Battle of New York and the discovery that SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra and the events of Sokovia… And then simply said that he’d made a horrible mistake, and that he and Tony had fallen out, and that he would explain all of that once he was done telling the wider story, he promised… before picking up with what happened in Wakanda the first time Thanos came to earth, and the five years after…
He resented Steve, for making these efforts instead of accepting the hurt he’d actually caused, for managing Tony’s reactions rather than dealing with them – for putting it on Tony’s shoulders, for making Tony the asshole for not going along with it.
“Which is very Steve Rogers of you, and I appreciate it – but I think this is one of those things where you really
"Once again, that's not in my contract," Brunnhilde deadpans. She's running her fingertips over a Rune on the wall to promote happiness and comradery, removing any bite her words might have.
"He's also gotten a hardware boost. I think I'm getting closer to magic-proofing this place." Tony grins happily at him, somehow managing to look both smug and charming at the same time. "Brunnhilde hasn't made anything explode in over a week now."
Tony reaches up and ruffles his hair while cooing, “Don’t worry, I’ll keep you safe from the big scary battle lady.”
You think he came alone?” Steve asks, looking straight into his eyes, and that’s when Tony decides that he’s looking into the face of a cheater. A dirty rotten cheater who should not expect a coherent reply when he’s got his thumb under Tony’s shirt pressed against the bare skin above Tony’s waistband. Tony has to fight down the urge to call it quits, to pack up and leave when his mouth turns desert dry and his heart stutters in his chest.
“Tony-speak for ‘my health depends on me not knowing’. Just tell me how much damage control I’m going to be doing tomorrow.”
“JARVIS is monitoring all activity right now, but the magic from the Runes has been causing the occasional glitch. It’s been making Tony act like a kid in a candy store that doesn’t stock his favourite chocolate bar.”
Sunset laughs and waves her hand breezily through the air while Tony squints at him. Or maybe he's glaring because of the 'Mr. Stark' thing, Steve can't really tell.
She shrugs and goes to sit across from Rhodey with a handful of pretzels. Steve hadn't even noticed that there was any food by the makeshift bar. It's very tempting to go investigate while Tony and Brunnhilde bicker over destroying company property.
Carefully hidden beneath all of this are Runes. Most are the normal security ones Steve had suggested, but there are a few that shimmer with magic that has the distinct feeling of Other: Tony’s Valkyrie, Steve realizes after a few seconds.
Natasha sets down a fresh pot of coffee and sits beside him, plucking the file from his hands to curiously flip through it. “Don’t think so. Clint and I are heading out for some recon tomorrow. There’s some stirrings in Latveria that Fury wants us to check out, and this looks local.”
He's too late. Tony has been watching over his shoulder the entire time and probably recognized who it was before Steve did.
"Rhodey's right," Steve says quietly, then louder. "People will be wondering where their host is. We don't want rumours of your demise."
“We doing this, Cap?” he breathes into Steve’s ear just over the music, stretching up so that more of their bodies are flush. A small jolt of pain comes in reply, traveling down his spine from where Steve’s fingers have tightened in his hair, and Tony groans.
Pepper takes a shot herself, shudders, then steers Tony over towards the couch and pushes on his shoulder until he sits down. This is all done with a facial expression he doesn’t think he warrants. There’s too much skepticism in it.
“Some of it gets to me,” Steve forces himself to admit, but can't find the words to explain why. Or maybe it's that he doesn't want Rhodey to realize how much he wants Tony to see him for more than his looks and magic, because he has a pathetic crush.
Rhodey winces, not looking surprised. “The press can be… overzealous when it comes to Tony and the people in his life. You’re a bit of an oddity.”
The side eye Steve is giving him does nothing to calm the laughter in his chest or dim the smile that he can’t fight back.
Steve gets a few looks with his ill-fitted suit and personalized mask, but no one calls him out. Probably because Tony is turning to him with his hand raised in offering.
It’s fair advice. Tony yanks the shirt over his head and tugs it down. It’s a bit big, completely stretched out across the chest, shoulders, and in the sleeves, but just bordering on tight around the hips.
“She used it to hide so that she could kill,” Brunnhilde finishes, sounding completely disgusted. “No wonder she always felt so… empty.”
It doesn’t, however, stop him from worrying that Steve is awkwardly pretending that he’s clueless as a way to let Tony down easy.
Steve glances around quickly, and yes, people are watching them. But Tony is looking at him like he's the only person in the room and Brunnhilde is watching for danger from a balcony. There's no reason for him to say no, and quite frankly he doesn't want to.
“An incredible pain in my ass,” Steve says, his voice sounding whiny even to him. “Most of the phone calls I’ve been getting recently have been about the novelty of talking to—and I quote—‘Tony Stark’s pet wizard’, or reporters trying to score an interview with him.”
Although Steve’s attention and focus is on Natasha, Tony catches a quick glance in his direction that immediately sets him on edge. He takes a sip of his coffee and squints between the two of them as they have their silent conversation. Annoyance is simmering in the back of his mind, and—to make matters even worse—Natasha is now wearing that secret smile of hers that drives him nuts. The one that tells him yes, they're definitely talking about him, and no, they don't plan on sharing.
“I know I said you were recognizable, but if you go like that then no one will even bother looking at your face,” Steve says, and Tony quickly wheels around to find him approaching with a mischievous grin. “I brought you a shirt just in case you get cold, Mr. Playboy.”
The bar has very few people inside when Tony and Steve get there, but Tony is way too happy about having his choice of booth to complain. He gets to shove physical money and a fake ID at the staff, something he hasn't done since getting his first doctorate. It’s like being a teenager all over again, except with more stable hormones and the fact that he came with the person he wants to sleep with. Many times. In many positions.
Steve groans and lowers his head against Tony’s shoulder, curving his body around him when Tony leans back into the embrace. He doesn’t bother to look up when Rhodey comes in, carrying Runed stone handcuffs that they put around Sunset’s wrists.
“No,” she spits out. “I did it because you took everything from me, and then did it all over again when I tried to rebuild.”
“The privacy controls you installed prevent me from telling you her activity, Sir,” JARVIS says, and Tony slumps forward and sighs dramatically to showcase his suffering. Betrayed by his own creation.
Steve just holds him, letting them both sink down to the floor before he starts to gently rock. It's not as helpful as it could be because he's too tense, watching Sunset for any sign that she's gearing back up to fight.
Turning back, he startles at the sheer amount of annoyance—maybe even jealousy?—Tony is radiating. It vanishes in a heartbeat and Tony is back to smiling pleasantly, but Steve quickly glances at the other two people in the room for answers.
“I feel like I’m walking in on the wrong part of this conversation,” Bruce says, maneuvering artfully around everyone to get to the tea kettle.
Instead, Tony opens his mouth and gets ready to completely traumatize Clint—but once again Natasha ruins his fun: “Get some glasses, hunch a bit, and dress down. This isn’t one of those places where everyone wears mesh tops and leather pants, so it’s best to leave them in your closet.”
Tony gasps in mock outrage. “Lies and slander,” he tells Steve with a sniff, pointedly ignoring Natasha. “She has no idea what she’s talking about.”
wear that," Tony says slowly, moving closer and amiably taking the mask from him. The cheap fabric slides against his skin, body-warm and sensual in a way Steve never thought a dollar store item could be. "You definitely could wear that, or you could wear one of mine that will hook you up with JARVIS."
"Where did that come from?" Tony asks, trying to get out from under him and scan the room. Steve grits his teeth and pours more magic into his shield.
“And here I thought I was finally going to get some use out of them,” Steve deadpans, hip-checking the fridge door closed and setting himself up at the counter with a carton of eggs and various other obscenely healthy-looking things.
Rhodey has taken over the chair Sunset left while Brunnhilde is checking out the whiskey decanters. Neither of them offers up answers as to why he's suddenly feeling like he's in the dog house.
“You brought me Captain America merch?” he asks in disbelief, pulling at the shirt so that he can see it better. It’s gently worn out and slightly wrinkled, carrying Steve’s clean scent instead of laundry detergent. “You brought me Captain America merch that you’ve been
"Smart-ass," Tony drawls, his eyes darting down to where Steve's hand is now hanging awkwardly at his side. Steve clenches it on instinct and Tony's eyes dart back up and away.
He bypasses it at first, with sleep still weighing down his eyes and the scent of coffee the only reason he’s putting one foot in front of the other. It takes some fumbling and a close call with an open cupboard door before he’s taking the first heavenly sip of his own brew. Dark and rich, with enough bite that Pepper once claimed it could take the paint off of the walls. Which is a ridiculous claim, even if Clint is the only one is willing to drink any of the coffee Tony makes.
“Captain Cranky Pants over there proves otherwise,” Tony says, pointing to Steve before a stalk of celery comes flying from Steve’s direction, hits him in the shoulder, and falls onto his lap. The last time he had eaten celery was with a Bloody Mary and he’d hated it, but that doesn’t stop him from biting into it aggressively.
Tony opens his mouth to say something, then closes it again when his brain refuses to compute. Steve is looking at him like innocence incarnate, and Tony can’t handle this right now. He gets up to put distance between them before he does something regrettable, like asking if Steve is making an offer.
Tony blinks at it, looks at Steve's face, then back to the mask. The silence is becoming awkward and Steve's frantic brain refuses to come up with any combination of words that would make things better.
Steve seems to ponder this before he’s nodding and grinning in a way that immediately sets Tony on high alert. It’s Steve’s ‘I’m about to fuck things up’ grin. The grin that preludes dangerous ideas and follows in the footsteps of explosions. It’s the grin Tony lives for and dreads in equal measure.
Having to push through the thickening crowd starts to make him rethink his decision to take the bus. Not regret, but rethink. People glance over their shoulders at him, some getting that spark of recognition while most just stick with dirty looks. They do grudgingly move out of the way at his muttered apologies.
At first, the buzzing in his pocket blends in with the vibration of the bass speakers and sharp sting of arousal dancing right under his skin. Then it starts to grow more insistent in a way that reminds Tony distinctly of a very annoyed JARVIS. It continues on until Tony realizes that it
She’s taken away by Carol and Misty on a stretcher and under the control of a sleep spell, the jewelry she’d stored her extra power in either confiscated or destroyed in the battle. One of the rings is confirmed by Brunnhilde to be what Sunset had been storing magic in in order kill her victims in her signature way.
Succinct and to the point as always, which is one of the reasons Tony loves her. “No damage control if all goes well,” he says, making grabby hands at her bag until she rolls her eyes and hands it over. Tony wastes no time before digging in. “Steve and I are going undercover, so I need to be less—” He pauses and squints at a bottle of concealer. “—less me.”
That would explain it, Tony decides. He opts to leave the shirt for now and is changing into jeans when the idea comes to him. It appeals to a primal part of his brain, the part that relishes in subtle claims and issuing challenges.
“A t-shirt and track pants,” Steve’s voice says from over where he’s rummaging around in the fridge. Natasha has set out some mugs and is busy putting out tea while the electric kettle  bubbles on the counter.
Steve finally bites the bullet and asks the question that’s been plaguing him since he got here: “Where is Tony?” He tries to make it sound casual—like he’s asking out of professional curiosity. Rhodey doesn’t look like he’s buying it. It shouldn’t surprise him; Tony is a smart guy, he’s going to surround himself with smart people.
“Director Fury has asked that you check your email sometime in-between the many meetings you suddenly have. I have taken the initiative to review what he sent, and it appears to be a digital copy of SHIELD’s ‘Sexual Misconduct’ and ‘Workplace Harassment’ handbooks.”
"Listen to Rhodey," Tony advises and wiggles the box in a way Steve suspects is supposed to be enticing.
"Steve here has agreed to help with security," Tony tells her cheerfully, holding out his hand for her mask and helping her put it on.
To distract himself, he logs into the StarkPad to bring up a few designs from R&D, only to hear the blessed words:
"The guy behind the technology is pretty incredible too," Rhodey says, just as quietly. He's looking at Steve like he knows what he was thinking, and maybe he does. Bucky’s constantly telling him that he wears his heart on his sleeve.
“Dibs!” Tony cuts in, before quickly cupping his hand under his chin to catch the coffee that spills from his mouth. “Wait, ouch, fuck, that’s hot.”
The second thing that hits him is the realization that they’re actually doing this, that Steve is practically herding him towards the beat-up rental car they’d taken here. Tony would be lying if he said he hadn’t imagined him and Steve in the backseat of a car once or twice. Maybe a few times, usually while he’s working on the Mercedes-Benz with a sight-line to the interior.
Brunnhilde glances over at Steve and he meets her eyes very briefly as their magic brushes together in greeting. Hers thrums with immortal energy and sparks against his skin like static, leaving him with the distinct feeling of Other. Steve almost misses Sunset letting go of Tony and grabbing her mask, too caught up in his battle with fight-or-flight that being around Fae always inspires. He might never have noticed if Brunnhilde hadn't turned away first.
“Halloween is his favourite excuse to have a party,” Rhodey says, his voice fond but also a bit worried. “I think he likes it because it’s easy to sneak out of.” Steve glances over in surprise, and Rhodey shrugs. “You should know by now that he’s not always like what you see in the media.”
“Not all of us get to play dress-up at work,” Carol teases. “Rhodey's going to take you in and show you around. He knows the security details as well as I do.”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, Sunset,” Tony tries again. “The quickest but most legal way to help your start-up was to buy it. That way you’d have all the financial backing you needed, and—”
Natasha is watching them with interest and comes over to observe Pepper setting things up. “You’d be be amazed at what a bit of contouring and eyeliner can do. Want some help?”
tired. He literally couldn’t remember the last time he slept, and he felt like his head had run a million miles since yesterday, and he’d given two and a half litres of blood this morning.
And then his eyes snapped up to meet Steve’s, wide and dark and flecked with the reflected silver of the workshop lights. Steve’s body tensed inward, his breath catching in his chest… his chin tilting up, just slightly, without him having to think about it.
“You must be very proud.” Tony replied, softly, ignoring a low churning in his gut. The little voice that whispered,
of knowing that the world is going to be attacked by aliens in a few months’ time, so now I have to ask myself if it’s a good time to totally screw over the whole of global security. Not to mention that a lot of those SHIELD scientists really did think they were working on a cure for cancer, or a new type of prosthetic limb, or whatever, and a lot of people are going to suffer if I just delete every project SHIELD ever worked on, out of spite.”
So he waited, hidden away at the bottom of those ominous alien mountains, far away from Natashas final moments. He stayed there until long after that sinister boom had rocked the sky.
. Maybe he could just… Do neither, for a moment. Not be responsible for the situation. Not discount his own feelings entirely, simply because he didn’t want to let them rule him completely.
inflict a great deal of pain on someone without causing them any real harm – without crossing the line that anyone else would’ve set themselves, in a situation like this.
Winding back all those nightmare scenarios. Rushing to remind himself that it wasn’t real, no one was going to take his blood, Bucky wasn’t hurt, Tony wouldn’t hate him.
“So, I have a question, and I don’t know if it’s going to be an offensive question, but I kind of think I have to ask,” Tony mused, his eyes still fixed on the ceiling.
It meant going through all the issues that had been there before, and asking himself if they really had worked through them now
“Well, I can’t stay long, anyway,” she informed him, amiably. “I’m off to DC tonight, for the product meeting that I’m sure you’ve no idea about,”
is really sorry - I know it killed him more than anyone…” He trailed into a pause when Tony let go of another sigh.
Right now, it was really very tempting to lean into that. To allow himself the sense of injustice and self-pity, to be consumed by his own pain and be entitled to it…
. Remember the rules, remember the things you have to be, if you don’t want to be bad. Act like the Good American acts in every movie ever made, say the things you are supposed to – do your damn job.
He’d imagine all the ways he could make Steve good, all the ways he could soothe him and support him and comfort him… Tony could just get lost in that.
get sent back home again, and lose all chance of the thing I thought I wanted most at the time, and that’s how I made that choice. And I know that there couldn’t
“And I’ll try to put as much time aside for this as I can, without tipping anyone off,” he hurried on, before Steve could say anything personal. And then he remembered, “oh, and speaking of tipping people off - Agent
“I’m sorry I sent you away, I’m sorry for the things I said,” Tony answered in a rush. “I didn’t mean any of that-”
Steve was overwhelming by now, coiling tighter with every breath, almost to the point of pain - but Tony just wanted to
And, oh, that had always been the ultimate fantasy. The one he wanted every part of, the thing he thought could only ever be a dream. He’d never wanted to
files on the master project, or the main project, or the priority project – and if nothing matches that, load all research files and reports.” Tony winced that last part, like he wasn’t sure if he was pushing his luck “Right side of the left wall”

was when he figured out what he wanted, and exactly what he should have done - and wasn’t that typical of him?
And at no point had it led anywhere near the subject of this being the start of something, or a permanent relationship, or this being exclusive…
But Steve was setting the pace now. He ran a slow, strong hand through Tony’s hair, tilting his head so that he could kiss him deeper. Tony moaned a soft surrender, melting into Steve’s embrace, calming to meet his rhythm.
And Steve had assured himself that if, in spite of all this analysis, he found himself disliking Stark again, he would ignore it. He would act as if that impulse wasn’t there, because it shouldn’t be.
assumed that Steve was ‘going along with it’… Steve might’ve felt a lot of things, if he could’ve gotten past that. But there was no getting past that – not unless he fixed it.
to control everything… It’s just that you’ve always felt responsible for everything. It’s different,” Tony sighed. “I think… Some people just know that they’re going to be judged by their intentions - and those don’t even have to be good. As long as they don’t mean to be bad, they’re off the hook. And those people always have
“…I just… Didn’t want to sound like I was rewriting history, or making excuses, and… it just all sounds so ridiculous, and it’s not like I think that makes it better or like I shouldn’t have to say sorry so I just thought… why try to-”
And then it was like he’d missed a second, and he found himself panting and lightheaded and weak, his limbs hanging as heavy, barely tethered parts, his weight resting gracelessly against Bucky’s chest. Bucky still had one arm across Steve’s stomach, saving him from falling forward… holding still, now. Waiting for Steve to catch his breath.
“And I’d already decided to be very polite if for any reason it wasn’t,” and he paused so Steve could giggle at that. “But, yeah – I actually
“A few things.” Tony sighed, walking into the room and flopping out on the couch, just as Steve had done a few hours earlier. Steve braced for a joke, a challenge, a dig… and was far sadder that it didn’t come “We’re
Now, want crawled up from his groin like a creeping vine, sinking painful tendrils into every inch of his body. His desire had become something so intense it hurt, a sharp spike driving through the core of him at the barest thought of Tony’s touch. He knew exactly why Tony and Bruce wanted him well-rested and well-nourished. He suspected that once Tony was let out, he and his alpha would not be leaving their heat room for a long few days.
What follows is a Really Long Meta and you can skip it if you don’t care! No worries either way, I just wanted to address some comments.
“That’s why I’m asking,” Steve says easily. “You’ll tell me what you think is best for Tony, right?”
Tony’s face softened, his hands cupping Steve’s cheeks. “Shh, sweetheart, no. It’s okay, it’s not your fault. I just want to get outside for a bit. Even if it’s just the balcony. Can we try the penthouse, first, and see how you feel?”
“I’m fucking losing it,” he says, letting the cold seep into his skin. “I fucking hate Asgard. I hate magic, and gods, and my fucking insane life.”
He drums his fingers on the worktop, staring sightlessly down at the drawing. Steve’s trying his best. Tony knows he is. It’s not Steve’s fault he can’t stand Tony. Tony’s hard to get along with. He’s a lot. He’s always known this. He’d just…hoped Steve would be different. But it didn’t matter. He’s always known the soulmates thing was bullshit. Now he has proof: no matter how compatible their pheromones are, they just can;t get along. And that's fine. That was normal, even. People do that all the time. Hell, his parents had done that. Maria and Howard had absolutely nothing in common. They’d married for status, and money, and the promise of healthy children. So what if Tony doesn’t want any of those things? Steve’s polite. He’s stunningly handsome. The sex will probably be…perfunctory, and missionary, but Tony can probably deal. Steve’s not hard to look at. It’ll be fine. Fairness is for kindergarten and fairy tales. Tony's a big boy. He can step up.
“Gonna paint me with your come?” Tony murmured, dark eyes wicked, and that was it for Steve. He fell forward with the force of his orgasm, bracing one hand on the ground next to Tony’s head as he felt like his entire body was turned inside out through his cock, long white stripes stringing over Tony’s stomach, his pectorals, the cool blue light of the reactor. It was that last that made Steve shudder, eyes closing briefly because it was just too much. The reactor was Tony’s life, his heart, metaphorical and physical, and to have it marked like that…
“You asked for it,” Tony reminds him. He hums when his fingers close around a familiar smooth rectangle. “Gotcha.”
“What if we run into him in the compound?” Natasha asked, but Bruce was already pulling a duffel bag out of the back of the Humvee. He knelt down and opened it, pulling out a series of heavy-duty respirators and handing them out.
“None taken,” Steve said, amused despite himself. “Yeah, I’m an omega. The serum changed a few things, but.” He shrugged.
Cap backs him into the suit, the automatic defence systems confused by Cap’s questionable threat status and his designation as ally. The metal pushes into the gash in his back, and Tony opens his mouth in a wordless cry just as a mouth closes over his, chapped lips and sour sleep taste flooding his awareness as Tony freezes, eyes wide as he takes stock of the situation.
Steve laughed, rolling over onto his back and dropping a hand over his eyes. “Okay. Then I’ll just lie here alone, and you can go get cleaned up.”
“Oh, we know,” Tony answered, perfectly cheerfully “It’s just, if anyone looks back to the security footage of this in the next few minutes, we want it to look as though we were just chatting to you about something else when you passed out.”
At first, it was simply shock - because, obviously, that was the last thing Tony was expecting anyone to say. But then the mental image caught up with him...
Tony pulled back just enough to let Steve come in his mouth, sucking the head of Steve’s cock as he swallowed, dragging his orgasm out as long as he could.
And then a thicker, hotter wave of pleasure washed over his face, as Tony slid two fingers inside him.
“Well, we don’t want to overwhelm you with too many of the details all at once, obviously,” the first Rousseau began, giddily.
“Steve,” he whispered, his hand subconsciously reaching up to him, even though his body was still too heavy to move. And then he saw Steve’s eyes flash with such naked, vulnerable hunger, and there was an almost painful twinge as Tony’s cock made a valiant attempt to respond – far too soon.
He watched Steve take a knife to his own wrist, his eyes fixed on Tony as he pressed the blade to his skin and sliced, lengthwise, opening a rapid stream of crimson red…
Steve ducked his head, and Tony couldn’t tell if he was trying really hard not to laugh, or just cringing very hard.
want to stay at home and raise his kids. It was positively unheard of, for anyone to question the immorality of a man having sex with another man… And yet Steve had thought all of that, at one point. He’d never questioned his right to think about it, he’d never let the popular opinion sway him. And the
“You know, Nat still agreed with me, on the principle, when she helped you. She literally said ‘Yeah, actually,
“Beautiful, and strong, and brave…” Tony purred, rocking into him. Steve felt Tony’s cock pressed hard against the small of his back, and a little tug low in his gut – different to the spike of desire that would usually be there. An affectionate, sentimental urge, something warm and safe and without sharp edges.
Feeling anxious that he’d let his guard down so completely, that he’d let himself be imperfect and vulnerable and maybe even selfish… Remembering all the people who’d told him to ‘tough it out’, all the times he’d told
he still had all this painful energy, Steve simply fell back into stance and started throwing punches again.
sure that Steve didn’t really like him, that Steve’s feelings and actions and reactions had to be about more than him – and that proving that fact would change everything.
There were no inconvenient observations or emotional responses, right now. Tony hadn’t even bothered to note that he was
such things as vampires, hundreds of years ago. And the serum I took was made using samples of their blood, and a bit of human science… So, I don’t know if I’m exactly
This time, Steve kissed him roughly, grabbing at Tony’s hair, forcing his lips further apart as he pulled him hard against his chest. Tony fell into it – into the kiss, into Steve, into this intoxicating feeling of total freedom. He slid his hands up along Steve’s sides, possessive and desperate, gathering the fabric of his T-shirt under his nails as he went. Revelling in the strength of Steve’s body and the softness of his lips… and nothing else. No underlying anxiety, no aftertaste of guilt…
For a second, Steve was lost for words. With nowhere else to put the sudden swell of emotion, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, and let his head fall into the crook of his neck…
And then Tony kissed his throat again, setting every nerve in Steve’s body alight. His eyes watered at the intensity of it, his lip trembling as that moment shifted and stretched around him.
“Alas, there is no such drug” Adam shrugged. “The concept of reasonableness is not something you can quantify… its’s a question outside of the sphere of this project. But, what you
. He’d even made some small attempt to put her off, thinking that Steve would have no interest in going to Anni-Vara in a purely social capacity…
It hit Tony even harder now than it had the last time he’d seen him. Perhaps it was that hopeful flash of defiance in his eyes, or that courageous fragility in the way he held himself… or the fact that he did look especially pretty, in the moment…
Eventually the heat of his own breath against the sheets became claustrophobic. Steve pulled his head free with a petulant groan, curling the duvet into his fists. He clenched the frustration deeper into his muscles, the way he might’ve jabbed at a toothache… Until at last it burned out into an insolent sort of sadness, and then he indulged in that.
to spiral, because by then Hydra were already chasing him. And, when he’d found out that his best friend had been tortured and brainwashed, and forced to murder the parents of the man Steve loved – oh, and a close personal friend of both of them, going back seventy years, by the way – Hydra were
“Here,” Rhodey pushed a coffee mug into his hands, and flopped down onto the other end of the couch. “Tell you what, why don’t you just start at the beginning?”
Because no matter how many times he reminded himself what he should be feeling, Steve still just felt like this. He’d tried to force a more sensible set of priorities into his head, but his mind just defaulted right back to Tony the moment his concentration slipped. And, failing all that, he’d even tried
If he should try to tell Tony how much it really meant, to have a safe haven out there somewhere - to have someone who cared about keeping him safe.
“So, my letter annoyed you,” Tony muttered bitterly, pointedly ignoring the racing of his heart. He could see the blush running up Steve’s neck, even in the dark.
think about it that way then… I didn’t even know that I wasn’t. I was so sure that I had to be sure, and so sure that everything had to fit with everything else, and… I do that a lot. Try to
He kept his frame locked and his shoulders held firm as he ducked his head to kiss Steve’s neck again, slower and deeper than before, sucking gently against his skin. Steve gave a low, keening moan, one hand grabbing roughly at the back of Tony’s hair, his head falling back against the pillows in a desperate attempt to offer himself up – but still, Tony kept to that same steady pace. He carried on sucking faint little bruises along Steve’s throat, his hands stroking up along Steve’s chest, seemingly unaffected by Steve’s increasingly frantic clawing-
Then it could’ve been more awful than it was – that was the ‘right’ answer, right? That’s what Captain America would think about this, that’s what he
– is that I can handle anything that might happen. But what I won’t be able to handle is if this…breaks you. If this is beyond your line, and we let it happen anyway, and then afterwards you… can’t deal, with this. So. I need you to be honest with me Steve. It doesn’t matter what my line is. I need to know what
"Aren't I?" Tony gestures around the room. "I kept you talking in here long enough to get a new suit after your little stunt on the helicarrier smashed the one I was wearing to sparks and scrap." He turns back to face Loki, his mouth set in a broad smile. "You picked me because you think I'm clever, didn't you?"
Bruce shrugs. “Let’s go to California. You’ve got multiple bedrooms in your mansion, I assume? Or is it all one giant glass loft?”
“Loki said she can shoot through steel,” Rhodey says, shrugging as he fights with the gun rigging with a little muscle from Dummy. “Seriously, can we talk-”
“Yeah…” Tony prevaricates, shrugging. “I don’t know about that. But that’s my problem, not yours.” He offers Stephen a wobbly grin. “Thanks for the help.”
Tony nods, tapping his nails on the steel back of the chair. “JARVIS, can you corroborate any of this?”
Tony stops, then turns to stare at him. Loki’s face is placid, expression patient, but there’s something lurking behind his eyes that Tony can’t quite puzzle out. When he blinks, it’s been replaced by exasperation.
"Exactly that. He wants to negotiate the terms of his surrender. Probably trading information on baddies and helping out in fights in exchange for probation and community service sort of deal."
“Cap, if Hasegawa makes contact, Tony dies, do you hear me?” War Machine says, cutting him off. Tony snarls a low layer of curses in Italian.
“Not anymore?” Bruce pressed, and Steve glanced over at him. Bruce looked a little worried, sympathetic, and Steve relaxed under his gaze.
Natasha glances over her shoulder. “There’s a bed. There’s a sink for water. There’s a toilet. I ate already.” She shrugs. “Better than camping.”
What is this going to accomplish, anyway? Does he want Rogers’ apology in person? Does he want to talk it out?
"We both know I am, who am I kidding?" He puts the car in drive and pulls away from the jet, heading towards the road. He carefully doesn't look at her. "Loki wants to come in, and he's picked me as negotiator. He keeps popping up, but he's playing nice, so I thought you should know in case, you know. He pops up. Don't shoot him unless he gives you a reason, etcetera."
“Yeah?” He pulls his glasses off his head, cleaning them in his shirt before replacing them. Tony quirks a smile at him.
“Uh,” Tony says, sipping at his cup. It’s fine china, probably actually from China, knowing the Sanctorum. He wrinkles his nose a little at the taste. “Break the curse…?”
“How do I look?” he asks her. His smile is crooked, a little broken. Steve wants so badly to hug him.
“I’ve haven’t been beholden to anyone since 1991,” Tony says, “and I don’t think I like it very much now. You definitely don’t.”
“Tony,” he burrs, and the deep timbre of his voice injects warmth straight into Tony’s spine, sure as a drug. “God.”
“No, but, how did that even happen?” Tony asked, staring up at the screen. “That- that doesn’t make any
“Wait, first,” Tony says, holding up a hand. “I’d be a bad queer if I didn’t say that there are some folks who’ve got issues with the film. Personally, I have always been a fan, but just so you know.”
When Tony gets into the darkened workshop, he’s visibly exhausted. The armour peels off of him like a selkie shedding its skin, until there he is: dark, tousled hair, and the bags under his eyes, a little thin and almost swaying with how tired he is.
Steve sucks in a sharp breath, his fingers tightening on the chair. “Jesus,” he breathes. He closes his eyes, trying to will away the image of a tiny Tony’s small hands fluttering over a deadly weapon. “Tony never talks about his childhood.”
By the time he gets back to the penthouse in the afternoon he’s yawning: a wide, jaw-cracking thing that makes him want to curl up on the sofa and take a long nap.
Bruce’s expression darkens. Tony inhales, takes a bite of toast, chews forcefully as he waits for Bruce to look less terrifying. When this doesn’t happen, he swallows with an audible click. Bruce mutters something in Punjabi. Tony eats his toast. Then he licks his fingers, for good measure.
“It baffles me how one as clever as you could yet be so small minded and set in your ways.” Thor grins, eyes dancing brightly. “Perhaps you should ask my brother, when next you see him.”
Steve’s fingers tighten painfully in his skin for a half-second before he remembers himself. He pulls them apart enough to stare into Tony’s eyes, his gaze sharp and pained. “I wouldn’t,” he insists.
Heyyyy, here's where things get a little steamy. You know what that means! Specific spoilery warnings. Skip if you don't need, stay safe if you do.
“What is with you two?” Spidey throws up his hands. “No one is talking about necromancy, or necrophilia, or whatever other terrible thing I am going to be accused of before this nightmare of a day is over. I just want you to scan for ghosts, or whatever it is you do.” He wriggles his fingers in the air meaningfully. “Scry for ghosts? Go dowsing for ghosts. Just do a check!”
Some warnings! All sex is very consensual, however, there is mild choking, BDSM elements, some somnophilia, etc. This gets pretty hardcore/explicit. Just a heads up.
The first thing Tony does after Steve’s funeral is take himself off the active roster. He puts Carol in charge of the Avengers. Then he settles down in his workshop, and he dives into the next stage of grief: trying to find whatever or whoever killed Steve Rogers.
Natasha continued as if she hadn’t heard them. It was a tried and true tactic of hers, and one that Steve was presently grateful for. “I’m not going to ask, either.”
Kitty dodges a last, desperate attack from Ghost. She slips into the floor to avoid his sharp clawed hands, then comes up behind him and gets him in a headlock. She does something with the glove, pressing it against his neck until a strange, almost hissing sound emanates from it. Ghost slumps, falling to his knees in the small room.
“He woke up, and Loki had bounced.” Tony begins to laugh, quiet and somewhat hysterical. “Oh my god, that bastard.”
Over and over again, like a lovesick fool. He wanted to reach into the screen and touch the crinkles at the corner of Tony’s eyes when he laughed, smooth his dark brow with his thumbs.
“Not gonna let me take care of you?” Tony spoke against his mouth, lips catching tantalisingly against Steve’s. His short nails dragged down Steve’s scalp, the nape of his neck, and he shivered in Tony’s arms.
“I think that what I have to say might change your feelings on that,” Tony says, and Steve takes a breath, lets it out. “Maybe I’m wrong? I’d like to be wrong. I’m so rarely wrong, though, Steve.”
Steve shakes his head, frowning at himself. Why was he even thinking like that? He and Tony are fine.
Steve’s looking down at his hands. “We’ll take a break. I can talk to a shrink about the anxiety attacks I’ve been mostly avoiding thinking about. Get a bottle of Xanax or something. You should probably talk to a shrink about the PTSD you pretend you don’t have, but your body, whatever. Like I said, this isn’t your fault, okay? You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re…you’re amazing, Steve. You’re treacle sweet. You’re unbelievably gorgeous. But I think we can both agree that what we’ve been doing so far isn’t working. Can’t we?”
didn’t want to screw this up. Just how very happy this could make him, potentially, if everything went right… That was a little bit nerve wracking.
Steve bucked up into him, tightening around Tony’s cock as he drew closer to that limit - pushing Tony closer to that perfect, promised breakpoint.
“No, it isn’t,” Tony interrupted, his voice sincere and slightly tearful. Steve glanced up, and their eyes met.
And then Tony led him into the living room, and the smile melted into a more general look of amazement as Steve took in the scene in front of him…
Now that he was past the immediate task of controlling the situation for Steve, Tony was fast losing interest in it - instead being pulled into the things that Steve needed
too hard to control everything. I’ve always done it. I did it to him, the first time around - that’s why I didn’t tell him about his parents, and why I sent him a letter that didn’t say anything… and why I was never vulnerable in front of him like that. I did it to Bucky. I spent two years looking for him while he was actively hiding from me, when he didn’t
These details were entirely without context, and probably useless in and of themselves - but, little by little, without him really knowing it, the simple act of counting them began to calm him down. The heat left his face. Some of the tension left his chest.
Instead of which, all of that could be lavished on Steve – which meant that Tony could indulge in it himself.
And if Steve had been capable of rational thought, he’d have been able to put that last one into context. He’d have remembered the reasons Tony had for saying that, the things they’d said to one another since then – all the reasons Tony was so very different to those other people.
There was something wonderful about this giddy desperation. It had a place in this amazing story, it gave yet another layer of meaning to all the moments that came before and after.
that urge this morning as a powerful, physical thing. He remembered it being unlike anything else he’d ever felt in his life…
sorry for that, and when all this over I’ll tell you that properly, and I’ll be nicer about it. And then things will just be better than they were, and that’s as good as things are ever going to be, and that’s the reality.”
Tony to be certain. To be kind, and reassuring – not to need reassurances of his own. Not right now. Tony
“And what exactly is this evening?” Tony asked – because he was still trying to remember what questions he’d prepared, before his little meltdown. What it was okay for him to be curious about, and what he was supposed to know already, and that uncomfortably broad category of topics where he couldn’t be sure either way. “The woman who told us about it called it an assembly.” Dev laughed, good naturedly, at that.
“Oh, God, Tony, you have no idea – Jesus-” Steve stammered, his hands stroking roughly under Tony’s robe as he rutted against him.
happen. He’d made this up out of nothing, based purely on what he wanted, without a shred of actual evidence – with plenty of evidence that it was impossible, as a matter of fact.
of his mental energy onto that.  As a result, he’d had the most creative and prolific week of his life. The workshop was still strewn with models he’d mocked up, his server was full of notes and experiment results and theory – some of which might represent significant breakthroughs for medical science as a whole.
The feeling of Steve’s chest pressed up against him, the dizzying safety and surrender of being held in that embrace.
The searing burn as Steve pulled his hair, and dug his fingertips into Tony’s hips, and sucked at his skin hard enough to bruise…
Once he woke up in a ‘recovery room in New York City’, assumed to be the same man who fell into the ice 70 years earlier, already completely briefed in the details of the era… Then he already was that person. He had established his identity and the foundation for his future plans. The only thing left on his official list was ‘leave SHIELD and go to Tony’-
It occurred to Tony that he hadn’t taken a good look at Bulsara since they arrived - or, if he had, his observations had since been lost in a drunken haze…
However he ended up making peace with this thing, he was always going to care if Steve was lost somewhere, wasted, in the wilderness - so, he might as well go from there.
But what they found immediately drew them closer. A basic instinct, like rubber necking at an accident. The wall at the back of the room was actually made up of hundreds of cells, which extended all four floors down or maybe even further, like this whole wing had been built onto the outside of The Facility. The drop below the railing overlooked a network of walkways, connecting the floors of cells to various landings, where computer screens and lab equipment were set up. Most of the cells looked to be empty… But, when Steve scanned from top to bottom, he caught the shape of a few people either lying on the mattresses within, or sitting on the floor, unmoving, their eyes fixed on the middle distance –
He knew that most people wouldn’t understand the relationship he had with Bucky. That they’d want to know,
Steve had been so careful not to acknowledge that comparison, so careful not to wonder why Tony had never been this understanding or forgiving or helpful when
Steve’s shoulders sagged in relief. He didn’t really know what he’d been scared of seeing - but, whatever it was, it was the opposite of a page of neatly ordered test results...
Ah. There was the anxiety he might’ve expected earlier. A sudden realisation of how huge this all was – how ridiculous it was that he’d just been sitting here in a haze for hours, oblivious to the whole world burning.
And another, and another, a horrible cascade of images all falling into place, making sense of something he hadn’t known he knew…
In the last few months, Steve had finally had a chance to mourn that man. He had allowed himself to feel that pain and loss. He’d recognised that - as amazing as this opportunity was - it could only be a chance to find love again, and be a better person, and carry on living. It could never change the love he lost, or the person he was in the past, or the life he’d already lived. He’d made his peace with it, knowing that the chance he
He let go of a heavy sigh. This wasn’t the point right now. The more pressing concern was whether he’d just blown the plan to take SHIELD down - or fallen into another trap altogether, or missed the chance to gain an advantage…
noticing Tony… “I mean… Obviously someone here knows more than they’re saying, so maybe trying to break one of them, or… follow them, or something…” he petered off into a mumble.
And then Tony sank his teeth into the tender skin just above Steve’s hipbone, a low growl escaping his chest as be bit down,
Even though Tony had taken two steps forward now, even when the sunlight fell over his face… still, there was just that tingle of excitement…
. So, yeah, we’re probably about to get a heavy dose of all of that, all at once… along with the drugs we were just gassed with… which are, um, woozy making…” Tony managed. And Steve heard all the words… and he tried to process that information – and in the end he just filed it away for later. Because, right now, he had to say-
blindsided him, he admitted it. It’d thrown his whole plan so far out of whack that he forgot what it even was. All those carefully considered priorities just fell by the wayside, as Tony was overwhelmed by a basic,
I said some of it, and I regret the fact that I said some of it to you, and not the people I’m really mad at for those things – which I
Steve could still hate every spiteful ideologue who had inadvertently put him on this course. He could still imagine an ideal world, in which he could have met Tony without
. Which is to say, it has been specially blended by the people here, for thousands of years, to be taken by couples – and it actually comes as two separate substances, designed to be taken together.”
He heard Bucky grumble as he came to the same conclusion, and shrugged his way out of his shirt. So, Tony huffed, and did the same.
Steve let go of a tight breath, dragging his gaze away from Tony so that he could look down at the thin red line trickling over his hand.
There really were a few moments when Tony just… was. He wasn’t play acting, he wasn’t making it happen, he wasn’t even taking the time to appreciate it.
At some point between the hall and Tony’s bedroom, they’d stepped into a different space entirely. Or a higher space, maybe. Because all those other reactions and priorities were all still there – how much Steve loved Tony, and how much he wanted Tony, and how happy Steve was, were all still a part of this moment. But now it was like Steve could see
“Right, I should probably focus on uninjuring people, before I injure any more people,” he babbled, turning his attention back to Bucky.
