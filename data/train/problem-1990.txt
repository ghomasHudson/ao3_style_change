"Father..." His voice doesn't come out any louder than a whisper. No one can hear him; there's too much other noise. Something tells him not to shout and draw attention to himself, though.
Sherlock waved a hand dismissively. "I've already taken care of it. I'll be on the next train back to London." He didn't make a move to get up, though, and something about the way he said it made Sarah take pity on him. He was probably missing John, even though they'd only been apart for a day and a half. It was kind of cute, actually.
But Emily seems to be satisfied by his answer, as it coincides with her own hopes and weights the evidence against her own secret fears.
By the time they pull into the underground garage at Uncle Mycroft's house, he is mopping his brow. He exchanges a pointed look with his driver as he instructs him to return all the controls to their usual settings, then leads Tristram and Emily toward the lift, swinging his ubiquitous umbrella.
John was self-conscious, Sherlock too careful. They barely touched, their fingers hovering lightly on their points of contact: Sherlock's shoulder, John's back, their palms. A chasm between them. John's shoulders were rigid, his legs wooden. Sherlock himself felt the tension in his neck, the stricture on him not to invade John's space. They'd danced like this before, of course, preparing for John's wedding. (John and Mary's.) That had been safe. Mostly. No witnesses. Covered by the veneer of John's engagement, of his commitment to someone else. This was like stepping out onto an unsecured scaffold. One false step, an inadvertent bump, even a slight breeze, would send one or the other of them skittering back to safety. Or plummeting to the ground
John tries to follow the line of his arm. "Which, the one to the right of the pointy roof?"
"Oh God..."
It ends up with Tristram's father walking out, muttering something about needing to think, and Doctor Watson making Emily and Tristram help him bring the remains of the tea things down to the kitchen. Mrs Bowen is there, making dinner, but even her offer to let Emily and Tristram help with the baking doesn't weaken Emily's resolve, and Doctor Watson ends up playing card games with Tristram and Emily upstairs until it's time to eat. That makes it even harder for Tristram to hold onto his grudge against Doctor Watson, but he manages. Mostly.
Sherlock nods against the side of John's head. "Yes," he agrees.
"You're not my employer," she returns archly.
Sherlock shimmied out of his pants, John helping him to pull them down and off his long legs. Sherlock's erection had flagged when he went downstairs, but John gathered his loose testicles in one hand and weighed them, rolling them gently and caressing the base of Sherlock's penis with his thumb, and it wasn't long before he thickened and swelled again.
Emily settles back, but her hand sneaks out from under her blanket and seeks out Tristram's. He squeezes it and smiles at her, then looks out the window and watches the buzz of the city give way to the monotony of the motorway. After a while, he closes his eyes, still holding Emily's hand.
It's quite an adventure just getting there. They have to take a bus and then a cable car, which Emily's nervous about but Tristram isn't until they actually get inside. He didn't expect it would swing around quite so much. They are packed in with lots of other people and their backpacks and snowshoes and sledges and even a dog, but Doctor Watson makes sure that Tristram and Emily get spots by the window so they can see the view. Tristram's stomach drops a bit as they pick up speed and the ground recedes below them. The town quickly turns into toy houses, and the valley with the train track and road running down the middle turn into a model railway. Tristram's hardly had a chance to take it in before a fog comes down over them, enveloping the cable car and obscuring the view. Only it's not fog, Father says: it's clouds. They are actually going up into the clouds!
"No," Sherlock spoke over him, "I meant, you need to feel useful. You want to feel useful. That... job at the school. That wasn't you. These." Sherlock gestured at the phone. "These are you."
Doctor Watson raises his eyebrows and lets out a long breath. He looks round at Father, who doesn't give him any help, then back at Emily and Tristram. "Okay, well, I didn't mean to put quite that much of a damper on things. If everyone hates the idea so much-"
"Why not?" It seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do, in Tristram's opinion.
"Are you able to continue? Do you need me to release you?"
"No, and neither are your accusations against John. Look, I had my eye on him today, don't worry. He was good with the kids, and they obviously like him. I think he balances you out well. The two of you could make a good team. Now give him his cane back and don't come back until you have your programme for the Nativity ready to print." He turned back to his computer. Sherlock didn't fail to notice the smug look on his face.
"We'll know shortly." His father finishes his text and sends it, then stands and walks to the door, buttoning his shirt as he goes. "Come and show me, Tristram," he says.
That's a reasonable question. Father does a lot of his investigations through the computer and his phone, but when it really comes down to it, he's best tracking down leads in person. But Father isn't the only one working on it this time.
Thank you to my brilliant beta readers, ruth0007 and dioscureantwins, who gave me the confidence to post this and made it even better.
Miraculously, John wasn't back yet when Sarah returned to their room. It had been almost half an hour. She hoped he hadn't run into any trouble. She went into the bathroom and started the shower. She probably smelled like Sherlock's aftershave, and she wouldn't put it past John to notice.
The last child gone, John and Molly stood at the edge of the square under a low-emission street light, too far away for Sherlock to hear them. John had his hands in his pockets and his head down. Molly was speaking to him (trying to catch his eye, hand on his lower arm to keep him from leaving: something he doesn't want to hear).
She looked down at John, disheveled and with a look of studied concentration on his face as he focused on increasing her level of stimulation. They'd never bought into the supposed romance of waiting for each other and trying to climax together. Sometimes she was faster or randier, and sometimes he was; it didn't really matter. It generally worked out to their mutual satisfaction. Tonight it seemed to be her turn; maybe because she was keyed up over Sherlock.
Sherlock was about to stash his phone back in his pocket when it buzzed again.
It develops that they are not going to Grandmother's at all. They are going to Switzerland. Switzerland! Tristram's only reference point is a chocolate advert that ran a couple of years ago. It showed a lot of cows and mountains and grass. Tristram also knows that Switzerland is famous for making pocket-knives. Father has two, with lots of hidden attachments. That is the sum total of Tristram's knowledge on Switzerland. He's not even sure what language they speak there, although he knows it's not English. Possibly French. Grandmother has lamented on occasion that Father and Mycroft never taught Tristram French. Not that she ever did, either. (It was her first language, apparently, but she gave it up along with Edith).
"And by 'nice', you mean..."
Sherlock put his finger in his mouth and brought it away with a trail of spit. John spread his legs further and shifted his hips up. "Oh fuck yes, Sherlock, two, give me two," he said, his arousal now urgent, demanding fulfillment and rising even further at the sight of Sherlock returning his hand to his mouth, his lips stretched and plump around his first two fingers. He pumped them in and out a few times before releasing them, dripping, to bring them down between John's legs.
Emily wrinkles up her nose. "What's that?"
"What in the world are you eating?" Doctor Watson asks when he returns a short while later with two plastic bags full of shopping. He sets the bags down on the counter in the kitchen and peers at the goop on Tristram and Emily's plates.
"I like lasagne!" Tristram says back.
Victor sighed as he replaced the picture on the desk. "I always did feel that there was something unfinished between us when you never responded to my attempts to contact you after we parted ways. Will-"
Sherlock drew back out of John's space completely. "They don't need to understand it, they just need to sing it."
"It doesn't matter." Molly's voice cut into Sherlock's thoughts, uncharacteristically no-nonsense. "What matters is what we're going to do about it now."
"The hell it is," John says fiercely. "No, now stop it. You do not get to do this. Not anymore. You do not get to decide for me what I'm meant to feel, and who I'm meant to feel it for." John grabs Sherlock's hand and holds it hard. "You and me. This. This is what we have. This is it. I don't care if you don't want-" He hesitates, but throws caution to the wind and forges on. "-sex, or the picket fence, or even to be a part of raising my child. You can go on being married to your work, and I'll be your bit on the side. But you are not going to crawl back into your shell and try to tell me or anyone else, least of all yourself, that this isn't important to you. It is, and it is to me, and we're in it together."
"It's okay with me," Tristram says, his voice preturnaturally loud in the enclosed space. "You and Doctor Watson," he clarifies. "If you want to... I don't mind." Tristram's heart is pounding furiously. He clenches his hands on the seat next to him.
"He does generally sleep next to me," Sherlock told him.
Sherlock swallows, the sound loud in the sudden silence. "Me too. John Watson."
It took John a few seconds to catch up. "Oh, you mean..." Baby pictures. Not embarrassing to Sherlock, but to... "Oh. No, it's okay. I wouldn't have made the connection, I don't think. Course, now I have." John tried for a chuckle in an attempt to keep things lighthearted. Didn't quite succeed.
"I don't like it. We're too exposed," John says tightly. "We're leaving as soon as it gets light."
Tristram also picks up a packet of playing cards with funny, old-fashioned characters on them because he thinks Mrs Hudson might like them. He can pay John back when they get home. Or if John only lets him take one thing, he'll put back the knife. Father always lets him use his, when he doesn't need it.
"Are you going to wait for Sherlock?" Emily asks.
Sherlock and John tumble into the bathroom, breathless and laughing. Sherlock's nose has bled gloriously and the pinky finger on John's left hand is swollen and stiff. Maybe fractured but more likely sprained, he says. No need for x-rays, he'll just tape it up.
"Then we're coming to get him now," John declares. "He's already been so traumatised, I can only imagine-"
The poem quoted is
"The bloody bastard," John breathed out. "Letting us think he wasn't going to come. Did you-" He frowned suspiciously at Sherlock. "You didn't know about this, did you?"
He was wrong.
"A good question," John said briskly. "Here's an even better answer." John leaned over and whispered to the children, "One, two, three, four..."
"The bullet went through his hand. I didn't get much of a look, honestly, I was just trying to control the bleeding, but I think surgery is likely. The other problem is the fact that he has a back full of glass. His mobility's good, as far as I could see, but they'll know more when they can get a good look at him at the hospital. And don't forget to tell them about the poisoning. They'll need to do a full workup anyway, especially if he needs surgery on his hand."
Sherlock smiles sardonically. "Mycroft's too clever for that. He knew she was going to leave even without his name greasing her way. She should have bargained harder over the abortion."
Their kisses were blatantly open-mouthed now, Sherlock's hand smoothing down John's back, John's sliding over Sherlock's arse, tugging him closer, snugging their hips together. John was hard, and he felt Sherlock's echo against his hip.
"Sorry, what? Christmas? Harry?"
"Not... the baser responses," I struggled to explain. "I mean the restraints and the more... gentle methods. But even then..." I tried to imagine applying the thorns to Holmes' fair skin, pressing hard enough to puncture the surface and draw his life's blood out of his body. I had done surgery countless times, cut into bodies both living and dead, removed arms and legs, eyes and spleens, been splattered from head to foot with blood, bile, and feces, and rarely shied away from the task. Yet the thought of harming Holmes in even a minor way without a healing purpose, was utterly revolting and repugnant to me. I would do it, of course, if he insisted, but it would be at the cost of great inner struggle.
"It was clearly for the best that you stopped it when you did." Holmes' hand lingered on my side, warm and solid. He let his thumb caress the edge of the bandage, a wholly unnecessary gesture but one that I welcomed more than was good for either of us.
He checks over his shoulder to make sure that Grandmother and Doctor Watson aren't listening, but they are involved in their own conversation. Still, he moves a little closer to Emily and keeps his voice low. "Do you want to... I don't know, talk about it?" he asks tentatively. He more than half hopes she'll say no because he has no idea how to 'talk about' topics that cause emotional discomfort.
"Oh, that," Sherlock said. "Not really, no." That was, at least, the honest-to-God truth.
"Hm?" John's voice is low and sated, his fingers tracing the lines of Sherlock's bones.
"Maybe I was interrupted," Sherlock suggested.
The man grimaces and stubs his cigarette out on the floor, then tucks the butt away in his pocket. "Damn habit, hard to break."
Doctor Watson pushes his chair back. "Thank you for dinner," he says to Grandmother as he stands. "I appreciate your hospitality, especially given all the-" He waves his hand vaguely toward the French windows, which Tristram finds puzzling; does he mean the weather? "- and I know this is all a very big imposition. But your son is the most incredible, most interesting person I've ever met, and if not even his opinions count, then I'm afraid the rest of us haven't a chance."
The lights are off, the curtains drawn tight. When they came back after dinner, the curtains were open, which threw everyone into a tizzy until Father decided all it meant was that the housekeeping staff had been in. They hadn't been able to clean that morning because Father was in the room. But the curtains are closed now, and John said he'd leave instructions with the front desk to leave them that way.
"Come on," Emily says, already halfway up the stairs. "Now I can finally show you the time machine box."
Alcohol was clearly part of the equation, however. In fact, Sherlock thought it likely that the times it hadn't worked, John simply hadn't had enough alcohol intus. He'd considered including alcohol in the formula and dosing John when he was sober - which would certainly be much more scientifically accurate - but John was frustratingly alert to any attempts on Sherlock's part to slip him things, and there was no way he'd miss the taste of alcohol in his tea, water, sports drink, what-have-you.
But now they had Rosie. They'd agreed after a bit of awkwardness that he was to be Pop and Vi was Gran. Mr and Mrs Holmes would have been oddly formal, and their first names somehow unsatisfactorily casual. Sherlock was still Sherlock, to Rosie and to John. No Daddy or husband. It had been strange at first anyway. Having to confront head on the fact that his son was gay. Oh, Sherlock had told them when he was fifteen, but it had been rather theoretical and remained so, despite hints of a boyfriend of some sort when he'd been at uni. They'd never met the boy -- young man, Bill supposed -- nor had his name ever been explicitly mentioned.
The grass was still thick with dew on my way back to the cottage. I was discovering a new fascination in observing the natural cycles out here in the countryside: the seasons, the tides, the heavens. The decision to depart from the city had been an easy one, in the end. My techniques appeared, to small minds, old-fashioned and oblique beside the modern science of fingerprinting, which could be -- and often was -- carried out by any fool, given the proper equipment. To that, I had to admit I was no longer as fleet of foot or as certain of the superiority of my fists as I once had been in the face of young brawn.
Yeah. Feels damn good.
Here is a sample of Schwyzerdütsch (the Lord's Prayer):
Sherlock's mouth narrowed into a tight line. "If you don't like it-" he started to say stiffly and reached for it.
While Tristram is pleased by the praise, he thinks he would probably be a little more circumspect the next time. Both in judging whether a situation really warrants alarming Father, and in avoiding walking in on something like that again. Which he really hopes will never be repeated, either in or out of his presence.
No, Sherlock was fairly certain he'd done that himself. He moved forward through the parting crowd, barely registering John following close behind him. When he got to the front, the mayor shook his hand (golfer, cigar aficionado, two cats, homophobe) and indicated that Sherlock should stand next to him. John took a position in the front row of spectators, his arms crossed over his chest.
I blushed, thinking he was drawing attention to my unacted-upon impulses of moments ago and the resultant wash of alpha elixir coursing through my veins. Then his words penetrated even that red-hot layer of shame, and it dawned on me what he was proposing.
"But I was told Whitehall weren't able to make it."
"We'll just make a long weekend of it," her father says. Tristram can tell he's trying to make it sound jolly, but his voice is strained. "Your teacher won't mind if you miss one day of school."
"Not really, no," he agreed smugly.
Emily notices the signs too. "What's abflug?" she asks.
"No, no," he said quickly. "No need. Plenty of time, I've hardly anything to do anyway. Nothing, really. Forget about weddings and all that rubbish. We can..."
Sherlock didn't just dig used tissues out of the bedroom bin either. He sometimes went in there when John was at work and Watson was napping, and lay in the bed. Just lay there. Pretended it was the old days and John was upstairs. Or worse, the new days and John was lying next to him. He didn't touch himself. He never knew when Watson would announce herself and he'd need to go fetch her. But while she slept, he let his thoughts drift to that best of all possible worlds.
Tristram holds his breath. Father shakes his head, spraying snow everywhere, including back onto Tristram, and blusters and huffs to get it out of his nose. Tristram doesn't know whether to be dismayed or laugh at the sight. It's actually pretty funny, even if it was an accident. Doctor Watson seems to think so too. Behind him, Tristram can hear him whoop and cackle.
"It's good," Tristram says, without really looking at the picture, because her admission has thrown him into something of a tailspin. Her father
"Oh, Mrs Bowen said to ring down to her when you're ready to eat. She'll make you breakfast."
John looked down at the music again and put his hand over his mouth. For a terrible moment, Sherlock thought he was going to cry, but then he took his hand away, and all that came out was a little sigh.
"Do you have anything I can look at with you?" he asks as he scoots his chair in closer.
Father is knelt down on the floor beside Tristram in an instant, his hands gripping Tristram's shoulders. "Where? In London? In the flat? Where did you see him?" His eyes are wide and his manner is urgent, much more so than when Tristram told him about seeing the man smoking under his window at Grandmother's.
"I have no idea what I'm doing any more, Mike. I'm potentially the subject of a bloody criminal investigation!" John hissed, clutching the mug of tea Mike's wife gave him before discreetly withdrawing to leave the two men alone.
"He's fine, she's taking good care of him," John says between kisses. He pulls Sherlock against his chest and caresses his damp head, speaking against his cheek, tangy with the astringent taste of aftershave. "He's fine, and we're going to get him back."
John shakes his head. "Yeah, you're probably right about that," he mutters.
"Can I take my things?" he asks, reaching for his bag from the shelf in the closet.
"I don't believe I have either, and there's a reason for that."
"No. Well." Doctor Watson takes his serviette from his lap and lays it on his plate, which is still half-full. "We'll take it somewhere else then." He looks across the table at Emily. "Are you finished?"
"No..." John said, shaking his head slowly. "No." His smile grew until he had to look away out the window.
John pulls the duvet up over them so they are mostly covered and rolls onto his back so he can reach the reading light on the nightstand behind him.
John cleared his throat. "So. All that you said. About the health aspects. That's really good. You know, like I said, spot on. They screened me for HIV and hep before my surgery, and the other STIs were about ten months ago as part of my annual army physical, and I did always use a condom. And I um." John's hands were folded tightly. He licked his lips. "You were also right about the other- About no long-term relationship. Kind of hard to keep up when you're deployed, so. Not really in bad company there. But there were- God, this shouldn't be so hard, but there were quite a few others in there. Men and women. More than I'd care to own up to, to tell the truth. It was- I know it's not really an excuse, there were certainly plenty of lads who kept it in their pants or-"
"No, good, very good," Sherlock managed, pushing down onto John's fingers to get them back where they were. He squeezed and pulled on his cock at the same time, trying to get a rhythm going.
Tristram's letter back to her is on the table now, waiting for Uncle Mycroft's assistant to come pick it up. Mrs Hudson's been to visit every day. She brought along a deck of cards the first day, but it's pretty much impossible for him to play anything with just one hand, so they usually just talk a bit and watch one of her soaps.
"Okay, well." John put his hands in his pockets (not even going to shake hands) and looked around. The pavement was empty. Only a couple of anonymous cars passed by in the road. He looked back at Sherlock. The six-and-a-half feet separating them were insurmountable. "Good night, then."
Although all of the shops and attractions I've mentioned do exist, I didn't stick to the exact layout of Meiringen, so it may not be possible to reach them all on foot in the amount of time suggested here.
"What should I call you then?" Tristram asks.
"No, but welcome all the same." Sherlock put his hands on John, too, and touched him in all the places he had the last time and more besides.
"Unless there's a jumbo jet headed for my inbox."
Tristram shrugs. "Sure." Although it's more getting out of them that he needs practise with.
"Charming." Mycroft regarded them with a pinched little smile before returning his attention quickly to John. "Can I offer you anything? Something to drink, perhaps?" he asked as he herded everyone into chairs his assistant produced out of nowhere.
Doctor Watson straightens up and glances at Father, and Father stares back for a moment, then shrugs like it doesn't matter to him, only Tristram knows that's not true. Doctor Watson must know it too, because he takes a breath and looks at Emily then puts on a smile, the kind of smile that means he's going to say something she probably won't like. His mouth opens, but then he stops before he even says anything, and almost looks sad. "Yeah, that sounds good, Em," is what he actually ends up saying, to Tristram's mild surprise. "We'll try it that way tonight. Maybe we can switch around tomorrow."
) Lestrade had also expressly forbidden him from organising a stag night, which was fortuitous as Sherlock would have refused anyway. He had less than no interest in watching Lestrade become inebriated.
Sherlock stands up and goes to the desk, shuffling things around haphazardly. "You can leave now. I need to think. We may have actual killers pursuing us. We don't really have time for your sexual identity crisis."
Message: Just spoke to Greg you fucker. Where the hell are you? Have to get back to work.
It's crowded, even at the business-class desk. Although they already have their boarding passes, they have to queue up to check their suitcases, which they have all piled together onto a trolley in front of them. There are still three people ahead of them. Emily wants to go snowboarding when they get there. For the first time, Tristram is glad for his injuries; he has absolutely no inclination whatsoever to attempt snowboarding, and this way he has a convenient excuse not to go.
The next two or three days, I was stiff and sore, which was only to be expected. What I did not expect was the relish with which I luxuriated in each twinge and ache. My every movement reminded me of our actions at the Inferno Club. I reached for my teacup and felt the echo of ropes in the way the sleeve of my dressing gown pulled against my arm. I rolled over in bed and then did it again just to feel the bloom of soreness all along my sides. Every swing of my arm as I walked down the street shot sparks into my armpits, adding a smug spring to my step.
Tristram does. He trusts Doctor Watson. That's not the problem. It's these other people's intentions he doesn't trust. But if Doctor Watson is telling him it's okay, and he trusts Doctor Watson, then the commutative principle tells him that he should go with them. Not that he really has a choice. It's not as if he could kick or fight or get away. So he nods. Just a bit, but it pulls on something in his back, so he stops again.
John looked up again. He was so close now. "They... How?" His entire forehead creased. Sherlock could have kissed it. Wanted to. Wanted to so much.
"Thank you, Mr Lestrade, this is absolutely marvellous! Well done, sir, well done." The mayor pumped Lestrade's hand energetically.
"It's the truth, believe it or not." She sounds resigned, like she's used to people not believing her.
"Sebastian Moran, Daily Telegraph," Moran said, reaching across Sherlock to shake John's hand.
"Should I call my father?" Tristram's excited to try, because his father really is somewhere else and it would be an actual phone call, not just pretend.
Molly went on, "Sherlock... panicked, I think, and ... lied...a little..."
But they never go into one of the bedrooms. Not for this. (Perhaps the caveman symbolism hasn't been lost on John, either.) This is for tilting against the wall and tumbling onto the floor and tangling on the couch. There is no place here for lingering caresses or lazy kisses or simply letting their bodies share what their hearts want to say. Sherlock has no idea what John's heart would say to him, actually. He does know that John likes it fast and hard and straightforward, so that's what he will give him.
My nipples bulged out between two of the cords wrapped around me, and Holmes took extra care to pass the prickly chestnut over them, back and forth, over and over, until I was certain he was intentionally trying to elicit a very particular response from me.
All of a sudden, Sherlock found himself filled with an overwhelming fondness for the greying, middle-aged man with the softening belly and bags under his eyes slumped on the seat beside him. Something both fierce and tender. He knew what it was. He'd known it all along. Somethings. Did they need a name for it? Maybe. Maybe John did. Maybe Sherlock did, too. Naming it would make it real. Would make it something that could be hurt. Something that could end. Will had been hurt. Sherlock was untouchable. And yet John had touched him. John had reached him. John had burrowed his way in, underneath the skin, to the person who was Will and Sherlock and Shezza and all the others.
John's mouth twitched up in the start of a smile. "The central point of the Nativity is the awe and magic of that moment when everyone sees the baby for the first time. How are they supposed to give convincing performances if they've never experienced what that's like?"
"Morning," John slurred, his speech sleep-rough. He turned his head to blink blearily at his bedmate. Sherlock lay on his side, just as they'd fallen asleep the night before. Well, as he'd been when John fell asleep, listening to him monologue on blue gems and creepy bicyclists, silver roadsters and an illegitimate son. Mostly, anyway. They were no longer touching, John's hands neatly folded over his chest and Sherlock's tucked under his pillow. Sherlock's chin was stubbly and his hair was pressed flat, and his eyes were a little bloodshot, as if he'd slept about as well as John, which was: not very. John thought he was the most fantastic thing he'd ever seen, and his heart skipped a happy beat.
John and Father came out of the bedroom just when the animal rescue programme he and Emily were watching ended and told them to put their jackets back on. Both Father and John were all red around the mouth and neck, and Father's clothes were rumpled. Tristram couldn't tell about John's clothes because they're usually kind of rumpled anyway. Tristram doesn't mind anymore when Father and John kiss (as long as he doesn't have to watch), but he's beginning to wonder if it's really normal that they spend so much time doing it. Doesn't it get boring putting your mouth on someone else's after a few seconds?
"John," he commanded, soft but sharp. Sherlock carefully split his conscious awareness into two compartments, one continuing to greedily absorb every scent, every hitch of breath, every brilliantly flashing nerve ending, while the other twitched its ears in the direction of the new input.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sarah laughed without humour and sat back on her heels, covering face with her hands. "Oh my God." She shook her head and took her hands away so she could look at Sherlock. He looked insulted, impatient, and just a bit bewildered.
Sherlock sucked a kiss into John's skin under his jaw as he groped for John's still rampant cock. If they really wanted to draw it out, John could have kept it up under Sherlock's lazy post-coital caresses until Sherlock was ready to go again. But right now, he felt as if everything - his memories of how they came to be where they were now, Sherlock's extraordinary gesture, the knife itself - as if all of that were coiling inside him, welling up, and it was either going to come out through his eyes or his cock. So he put his own hand on himself along with Sherlock's, and they rubbed him together, aided by the slippery remnants of Sherlock's emission. He needed it harder and faster than Sherlock could provide at the moment, sated and drained as he was, but they had a solution borne of experience for this too.
"I'm not my brother," Sherlock said, to deflect from himself and get back to the matter at hand.
John lets out a soft sigh. "It's all amicable. I mean... Obviously it's been over between us for a while. I'm not worried she's going to come after me, shoot me in the chest at point-blank range or anything." It's a terrible attempt at humour, which John seems to realise as soon as he's said it. He blanches and mutters, "Sorry."
"Anyone could see them, they just don't care to."
"They understand more than you think. Especially Tris. He's you, Sherlock. Would you have understood when you were his age? How much did you pick up on that the adults around you didn't want you to know?"
He is suddenly dizzy. Automatically, he reaches out for something to hold onto so he doesn't topple over. It turns out to be a rack of postcards on display outside a shop. It feels like his throat is closed off. He can't breathe. It's like the other morning, when Emily had the curtains open. But now it's not just the feeling of something being wrong; it's that there are people all around him, and he doesn't know which ones are the good guys and which are the bad guys. He wants to run, or hide, or just get away, but he's paralysed by the tightness in his chest. Someone grabs his arm. He cries out - a strangled sound, not nearly loud enough to alert anyone to his distress - and tries to jerk away, but the person's hold is too tight.
I returned the stare and said only, "We are prepared to wait."
Sherlock waited until John's breathing evened out and then he slid out from under him, gathered his clothes, and went back downstairs.
"Well," Emily's father begins, once the four of them are alone, "I- that is, we're happy to see you - the two of you - again. I hope it's all right that it's just the four of us this time?" He seems nervous. Tristram can tell because he doesn't keep his eyes in the same place for very long and he keeps clenching and unclenching his hand.
After that it was my mouth which again captured his attention, and I eagerly returned his interest, becoming bolder in my vocal approval and encouragement. This appeared to please him greatly, and he tangled his fingers in my hair to hold my head in place that he might drink his fill of the murmurs I exhaled into his waiting mouth. His alpha member was like a rod of iron across my groin, my own crushed against his hip bone as he ground into me. He slid one hand between our chests to abrade my nipple with the hard-edged bits of dried wax that clung there, rolling them around and digging them in, sending electric jolts through my chest and into my gut to amplify the pulsating beat in my loins.
Sherlock swallowed convulsively and gathered his wits from where they'd scattered somewhere low in his pelvis. "Yes, perfect, I'll just - Kitchen," he said and whirled away, dropping his coat somewhere along the way.
The bathroom door opens and they fall silent. John comes out and closes the door behind him, then goes into the bedroom. The shower starts.
Message: The patient's you nit! I mean I hope it's going better than when we had ours done. I can still feel where the tailor jabbed me.
"That you'd never had a serious relationship as long as they'd known you... never even dated anyone, as far as they knew. Which - given everything else about you, I couldn't believe was because no one had ever been interested, so I figured it must have been your choice. That you were... I don't know, mostly asexual or something."
"Well, it certainly seems to have succeeded."
"The hospital was horrid," Sherlock insisted darkly. "And I never want to be in the same room with an infant again."
"We can stay here if you're more comfortable," John said without looking up. "Or I can stop."
Sherlock stopped short and looked around as he realised a lull in the room's conversation had coincided exactly with his statement. Looks of shock, surprise, amusement, and disgust, along with a solitary wolf whistle from the third table. John grinned and took a sip of his champagne.
"You can go with me," Emily offers. She wanted him to go with her a couple of times before, but it never worked out.
Tristram, of course, is not exactly able to go snowboarding or tobogganing or swimming in waterparks with his cast. He hasn't pointed that out to her because he doesn't want to dampen her fun. Maybe her father can take her to all those places while he and his father stay at the hotel. Or maybe Father will even do something just with him. He doesn't know what; there didn't seem to be anything pictured in the magazines that someone with a fractured hand could do, aside from eating and drinking. Although that would be like going to Angelo's, so maybe they could do that. Find an Italian restaurant. Or a Swiss one, as they are in Switzerland. To be honest, Tristram doesn't really want to do anything at the moment, aside from get to the hotel so he can finally rest, so that's what he says in answer to Emily's question.
Tristram barely hears the answering "Be there in a minute!" before he and Emily reach the high tide line marked by a contour of green and gray froth mixed with bits of wood and other detritus. Emily checks behind her, momentarily uncertain, but her father waves and signals that she and Tristram are fine where they are. When Tristram looks back, he catches his father angling his phone so that Doctor Watson can see the screen. It'll probably be more than a minute before they come down.
Victor recovered quickly and the novelty of the moment soon faded for the others as well, allowing them to move on to the purpose for their visit. Victor took the lead, showing the group around the building and grounds as they discussed the facilities, music options, worship service, and the staging of the ceremony.
"I know which song you mean."
"Speak for yourself, I'm going to be seeing stars in a ... Oh fuck yeah, just like that, bit faster," John growls.
"Is that where she's been the whole time?"
They found Mrs Holmes ladling broth over a lightly browned turkey in a pan on the table.
Dear Father Chrismas, I'm so scarred of not doing the play properly so please coud you make my Chrismas wish come true and make everyone love us in the play. P.S. Make me be Mary. Love Saffron
"No. I'll go. Just for a day or two. Maybe they'll change their game plan in the meantime, make all of this moot. Or you'll figure out what the hell they're after in the first place." John rubs his thumb slowly back and forth over the side of Sherlock's hand.
John looks over at him, frowning slightly. He checks over his shoulder, but both children are lying motionless under their blankets. "And you?" he asks in a low voice. "I mean, you did see a man killed right in front of you."
"It was Gladstone." Sherlock pointed under the table.
After breakfast, Father says he has some things to check on up in their room, so John takes Emily and Tristram out to explore the town a bit. Irene attaches herself to them. Tristram can tell John isn't happy about that at all, but he asks Tristram if it's all right with him, and it is, as long as John's there too, so John just gives Irene a tight little smile and a nod and they set out.
"This isn't last time. Tristram hasn't been kidnapped, he's gone off on his own."
"So, not what you expected?" John smiled through his words and put his hands right where Sherlock wanted them, which was on his body.
"No." The answer is absolute. Tristram knows better than to try to argue with that tone, but apparently Doctor Watson doesn't. He lets go of Father and takes a step forward so he can look him in the face. Emily drifts away, over to Tristram, and hitches one hip up on the arm of his chair.
"Of course," John agrees readily, but still asks, "What do you need a magnifier for?"
"Tell me to stop and I shall," he said, perhaps for the benefit of those who were watching or perhaps for my sake. I did not know, but God help me, I did not want him to stop. I knew what he was after, although for what purpose I could not begin to imagine; was it part of his plan? Was he trying to provoke me into stopping him and bringing the evening to a conclusion? Was this merely an excuse to end the game? I glanced down to see the stirring in my trousers were becoming as obvious as it felt. As I did my eye caught on Holmes' front, which was positioned directly before me. The way he stood, bent slightly forward, the bottom of his suit jacket gaped open, allowing me a view of the outline of his clearly non-omega member surging up against his belt. I did not think it was visible to anyone else, but it would give us away in a trice if it were. My arousal dissipated in the face of this new development.
"And you're Tristram." The woman focuses abruptly on him. Everything else disappears. Her eyes are dark, so dark and deep and full, although of what Tristram's not sure. She stares at him, and Tristram can't look away, and then he sees it: her eyes are hungry. It's not like Father when he's gathering information, though. It's more like she's trying to absorb Tristram himself. There's also something more behind that look, trying to get out; again, not like Father, not like when he's trying to put thoughts directly into Tristram's brain. It's something desperate and wild, and it looks like she's having an awful struggle to keep it from breaking free. Fascination mixes with his initial dislike. He thinks he should possibly find her sudden interest in him alarming, but it isn't. It's like watching a chemical reaction under a fume hood: he feels oddly untouched by it all.
Okay, and now for the real end notes on this fic:
Tristram couldn't even respond to that last bit - couldn't think about what it meant - because he was stuck on the first part. If they needed to get away, why had she waited until John and Emily left to say something? They should all go together, surely.
As soon as they're outside, Emily starts giggling. "She thought I was your sister!" she crows, as if it were the greatest joke in the world. "She thought I was his sister!" she repeats to her father.
"What's going on?"
"They already know it," Sherlock said.
"Hey, what are you doing in here?" John said. "I had thought we could get lunch or something. Went with Mike and Molly instead."
"You need to go," Sherlock snaps.

Sherlock gritted his teeth. Where was John? If ever he needed backup, now was the time. "It sounds vaguely familiar," he managed to say in a relatively neutral tone.
"Look at that," she says in wonderment, spreading her still-gloved fingers. She lifts her eyes to Sherlock's, a slow smile forming. "Steady as a rock. I suppose all those sessions at the shooting range were good for something other than foreplay after all." She lets out a long breath that just barely manages not to be shaky.
Deliberately, he directed his mind to the brief notice in the newspaper about the third in what now appeared to be a series of suicides, which had caught his attention earlier.He was certain the police were missing something. Impossible to know what, though, without seeing the evidence. Hopefully there would be another. The article had mentioned the name of the detective in charge of the investigation. Maybe he could tap into his phone and get tipped off when it happened.
And that solution, he decided, would be to see what happened. When undertaking a scientific experiment, it was counterproductive to terminate things at the first sign of an unwanted result. One had to allow the process to play out to its conclusion in order to analyse the outcome. It was entirely possible that an unforeseen yet highly profitable product would result. It could also be that one had to scrap the entire hypothesis, but one would still have gained valuable knowledge.
It's still raining, and boring, but Mrs Hudson comes round to fuss at them and invites Tristram down to hers to play a game of Snap. Tristram told her about Exploding Snap the other day, and she exclaimed that was a real game, only without explosions, and taught it to him. Tristram's much quicker than she is, of course, so he nearly always wins, but she's a good sport and plays just as long as he likes. He's going to teach Emily the next time they get together.
"No, you are." John takes Sherlock's hand and squeezes it firmly. "And now let's go get Tristram."
"Why'd they put it in German?" Emily wants to know.
John seemed to come to a decision, or rather, was now ready to follow through with the decision he'd made when he brought up the topic in the first place. He let go of the glass and lifted his eyes to meet Sherlock's - jaw set, shoulders hunched slightly, hands clasped tightly on the table in front of him. "What do you want to know?"
"But you thought there was?" John prods.
We spoke of none of this, of course, despite meeting over dinner the subsequent evening so that I might keep abreast of developments in Miss de Merville's case. Kitty Winter's visit to her in Holmes' company was a disaster very nearly ending in a cat fight, with Holmes having to bodily drag the hostess from "Hell" out to the waiting cab.
"Hey, that's great," Doctor Watson says happily. Tristram is surprised, because if he got an eighty-five on a maths test, his father would want to know why. But then Emily is a year ahead of him, so maybe the tests are much harder.
"Yeah, I do. Doctor here. If he takes his meds, which he will, and doesn't go climbing up on the roof and fall off, which he won't, he's going to be around for a while yet."
I surmised that we were witnessing another spanking - for what purpose I could not fathom, for it appeared both alpha and omega were highly pleased with each other - when I was surprised to see the alpha reach his hand forward, wielding the violet ray whose distinctive scent I had apprehended earlier. Rather than pressing the glass wand firmly against his omega's skin to achieve the proper therapeutic affect, however, to my horror he carefully guided it between the bound man's legs until it was a finger's breadth away from the vestigial member which hung limply beneath his belly, and held it steady there in the air. I cringed, anticipating the crack of discharge and the bright violet light which arced from the instrument to the helpless appendage. The omega jerked forward against his bonds and cried out a word that might have been "Nine!" even as the crowd (for the display had garnered a respectable audience in addition to Holmes and myself) gasped in unison.
"Although they could have sung a bit better," Sherlock mentioned.
Tristram turns around and walks into the bedroom, his back a little straighter, with Emily right behind him.
I saw the wisdom in the latter part of her suggestion, at least, and took a few items which I thought useful out of the cabinet. No sooner had I turned around, however, than Holmes plucked them out of my hands and wrangled me into one of the practical armchairs the room provided, where he proceeded to efficiently clean and tend to my wounds. I did not bother protesting. In truth, I coveted his hands on me, although I made every attempt to comport myself with dignity and decorum.
. In the end, the only fair answer he could give was, "Only what you want to tell me."
"What are you doing here?" John had only opened the door wide enough to stand in the gap. Wary, but not entirely unhappy to see him. Sherlock couldn't allow himself to hope, though. That way lay danger.
Sherlock was seated next to Greg at the front table with the rest of the wedding party, but aside from thanking him for the speech, Greg hadn't exchanged a word with him, having eyes only for Molly. And hands. Before they'd sat down, they'd both kept their arms wrapped around each other's waists or shoulders as if glued there. And once at the table, they'd either held hands or else Greg had kept his arm over the back of Molly's seat, his fingers constantly wandering up to touch her neck or shoulder. This would invariably cause Molly to squirm and shoot Greg a heated look or lean over to whisper something that would make him clear his throat and nip a quick kiss or two or three to her jaw. At one point, Sherlock became so annoyed he suggested they slip off to the loo to get it over with.
"Frightened?" Sherlock rose from his chair, and this time he couldn't do anything about his pulse racing out of his control. Because John had hit the nail on the head - inadvertently, to be sure; Sherlock knew he meant something else - afraid of reverting to the role of the kid brother, afraid of being indebted, afraid of rejection: yes, yes, yes. The most frightening thing of all was how accurate John was with his deduction.
"That can be this." Emily reaches over and rips off a square of toilet paper. "What else? Lacewing flies... What can we use for that?"
"Tris? Come on, Tris, just a little longer. You can do it." That's Doctor Watson. Wasn't he supposed to go with Father? Tristram tries to tell him he should go find Father.
John. He'd allowed himself to give in to a craving. Stupid. Colossally so.
John's left the bedroom door open. Tristram doesn't want him to hear them talking about all this stuff. Tristram knows that he and Father are trying to keep as much as they can from Tristram and Emily so that they don't get scared. Admittedly, Tristram's panic attacks are probably a factor in that decision. As is Emily's insecurity about being separated from her father, which even Tristram's picked up on. He wonders what else there is that he and Emily haven't guessed yet. What other dangers are lurking.
"I do like it rough, but perhaps not in front of the children," Irene purrs. Her red-painted lips curl into a smile, like she knows she's won, which is odd because it's John who has the upper hand.
Irene got a little line between her eyes as her face adopted a look of concern. 'Oh, dear. I hope he wasn't too terribly worried. If only he'd asked me.' Then her expression cleared, and she said in a way that was certainly meant to be reassuring, 'But we were going to travel together anyway, so it didn't matter who held onto it.'
"I am entirely at your disposal. Today and every day, I hope."
Tristram frowns at that. How could Doctor Watson have known she was Tristram's mother? Tristram didn't even know.
Thank you to absolutely everyone who left kudos and such great comments throughout. I love that there was so much of an emotional response to this, and I am especially moved by those personal experiences that people have felt safe enough to share here. This is obviously just a made-up story and I've never been through anything like any of the situations depicted here, so I was really humbled to hear that people are able to identify, even if only in a small way, with some of the characters and the things that I put them through. You, the readers, are such a huge part of this. Thank you for participating. And finally, thank you once again to nox_candida for creating the original characters and set-up and for giving the okay for me to share this what-if with the fandom.
They sat on the sofa, and Gladstone flumped onto the floor with a great sigh, resigned to remaining on the periphery for the time being. Sherlock told John about the dry cleaner while John poured out two measures and handed one to Sherlock, then settled back, his body half turned toward Sherlock, to listen.
With the talk of kissing, Sherlock was suddenly struck by the fact that he and John were standing in a very similar position to how they'd been the previous night. And the risk that a group of hooligans would happen to pass through the assembly hall of the Baker Street School in the next few minutes was vanishingly small.
It takes a while for him to realise that the conversation has fallen silent and everyone is looking at him.
Sherlock's hand was now working John quite thoroughly, a thin film of slick wetness lubricating his strokes. John reached down to press his palm against Sherlock's groin and found it heavy and hot, even through the clothing still covering his lower body. John dragged his nails over the animal skin, causing Sherlock to gasp and buck and stutter in his own ministrations on John.
Sherlock was pleased at the confirmation of his assessment of the company in which the movie was typically viewed. His next words were critical. He couldn't appear too interested, but not entirely dismissive either. "It sounds laborious. A thirty-year-old horror movie?" He moved to step out to the kerb.
Moran was right after all: there was the rope. There was more applause. Sherlock put a smile on and shook the mayor's hand. John was clapping as well, but there was an odd look mixed in with his obvious pleasure at the announcement. As if Sherlock weren't reacting as he should. Sherlock tried to appear more genuinely thrilled. John still didn't look entirely satisfied. No matter; as long as the mayor and everyone else were.
Sender: DI Lestrade
Irene tears her eyes away from Emily's father and her face softens. "No, darling. Let me put your mind at ease. I have absolutely no intention of coming between your father and Sherlock. My only interest is in Tristram. My son." Tristram frowns internally at that.
She frowns and shoots him an irritated look. "John," she says, as if it should be obvious that's whom she'd meant.
Here is where you can buy railway tickets at the Zurich airport. The bakery is right about where the photographer is standing.
"Daddy!" Emily jumps up, her relief evident, and throws herself at him.
Tristram moves over to stand in front of the mirror and tries to twist his neck around so he can see his back. His disappointment over what he thought was a delay in the healing process has turned into glee. He's going to have honest-to-goodness scars, just like Father. Not just little ones like on Father's hands that you have to hold really still and find the right angle to see them either. "Cool," he breathes out. Although no one will really be able to see them under his shirt, which is a bit of a shame.
"Dimmock," John sighed under his breath, shaking his head, but his mouth was edging towards a smile.
Time: 17:24
Tristram's heart is beating very fast. He knows he has to ask the next question. He also knows the answer already, but it's important. He's not sure why, but it's important that it be said. "So is he... like, your boyfriend?" He holds his breath.
"Mea culpa, in that case, and I'm
"Quite right," Father says, nodding at her in acknowledgment. "But people are generally idiots."
"I have to. You're not insured to drive the van."
..." John pointed his fork at Sherlock before he could interrupt. "
I agreed.
Sherlock plonks himself down on the edge of the tub and dabs ineffectively at his ruined shirt with its cascade of red splashed down the front. He doesn't care. John is loudly proclaiming Sherlock's brilliance and his own prowess with his fists and elbows and knees while he washes his hands then rummages in their medical supplies.
Sherlock has seen everything in those eyes as they gazed on him: anticipation and anger, arousal and astonishment, ardor and amusement. He's seen them turned eagerly upwards from where John knelt to catch a glimpse of Sherlock's face as he came, staring down dark and greedy at Sherlock bobbing between his legs, filled with the lazy tenderness of afterglow and maybe, Sherlock fancied shyly, something more.
"Wave their hands? The stars have hands?"
The building, it turns out, is not a castle at all, magical or otherwise. It's a hotel, and the turrets are the domes of an astronomical observatory. Which is, admittedly, an odd thing for a hotel to have, but Father says it's because the conditions for astronomical observation are better here than down in the valley. The air is cleaner and thinner, the moisture content is lower, and there's less light pollution. Which still doesn't explain why they built the observatory on top of a hotel, but Tristram supposes perhaps it was just convenient that there was already a building here. There are certainly no other structures in sight.
"They're very good."
"You know, I don't even know. Why don't you tell me? I mean - my God, I really know nothing about you." John puts his head in his hands and laughs humourlessly. "Are you.... I mean, you seemed as surprised by all this as I am, but for all I know I'm just your boyfriend of the week."
"Did Sherlock also tell you what happened two months ago?" he challenges her, a tight, mocking smile threatening to break through.
Sherlock drops his arm and straightens up, tilting his face down toward John. "John..." he says in a low voice, something between a warning and a plea.
"I've learned not to ask too many questions," Grandmother says, "although one does get curious..." She doesn't even spare a glance for Emily, but she looks Doctor Watson over, as if trying to deduce something about him, the way Father does. Her eyes move much too quickly, in Tristram's opinion, to take in anything of note. She turns back to her painting. "I've always hated pink. I thought it was about time I tried to figure out why. Red doesn't pose a problem. It's obvious: blood and danger. Pink, though; disguised as innocence. It isn't innocent at all, is it? What do you do, Mr Watson?"
"Father?" Tristram whispers, he hopes not loud enough to wake Emily up. He can tell she's not faking.
Irene is no help, of course. When he asks why they came here and when they can leave, all she does is say things like 'Isn't it fun to have a bit of time to get to know each other better?' and 'It doesn't make it happen any quicker if you keep asking,' and gets this kind of brittle smile that tells him to back off. Tristram is too acquainted with adult methods of obfuscation not to recognise that he's being given the runaround. In Tristram's opinion, it hasn't actually been much fun, perhaps because Irene is generally busy with her own secretive tasks.
"I'm the godfather, Sherlock, I can't very well beg off."
"I wouldn't have noticed," Sherlock sniped.
And John had been sitting in his chair, pretending to go through some emails and trying not to remind Sherlock he was almost two hours overdue for his anti-inflammatory. Until he'd finally snapped and marched into Sherlock's room to fetch the bottle, and Sherlock had come storming after him spouting something about not needing a nanny, and—
"So I'd gathered," Irene says dryly. Her eyes flicker to Father. There's a hint of amusement there, as if she's sharing an inside joke with him. His expression remains impassive.
"No." Sherlock understood that full well. Even if he himself would have done anything, from the merely unethical to downright illegal (actually had done), in order to keep John around, John had morals that he couldn't suffer himself to compromise. Ironically, that was one of the reasons why Sherlock was so keen on him. And now it was the reason he couldn't have him. "So," he said tightly, trying hard to maintain a neutral expression. "That's it then."
"You know what I think?" John asked.
"Yes." Sherlock frowned. He'd thought that was obvious. He unclasped Gladstone's lead, then draped his coat over a chair. "Just, anywhere," he said to John, who was looking around fruitlessly for a place to hang his own jacket. "Make yourself at home, I'll be right there." He headed to the kitchen first to make sure Gladstone had fresh water in his bowl, then went to retrieve the sheet music.
An orderly comes in with Tristram's dinner. She puts the covered plate on the table for him and asks if he needs help getting up so he can eat.
The day of his nuptials I spent in a haze of blissful unawareness; the evening in the company of a young geologist from Budapest whom I'd angled at a lecture of the Royal Geographical Society. I found his stones compelling. I did not often succumb to such temptations. My appetites had waned, perhaps with age, although I had not yet seen fifty years; or perhaps because my palate had been spoilt. The anonymous couplings I used to find so stimulating were now bland and unfulfilling, leaving me with a sickly, hollow feeling I did not know how to fill. (That is dishonest: I knew.)
"God, I should be going," John said when he finally looked at his watch.
Sherlock groaned. "Now you're going to say something tedious about infatuation and the thrill wearing off after a couple of weeks."
"Yeah. Yeah, I would," John said quietly. Deliberately, he lifted his hand and wrapped it around Sherlock's knee.
"John. I'm his mother. He's been wondering about me for nearly nine years. Of course he wants to see me. Look how readily he agreed that I come along with you this morning."
"Absolutely not."
friend's father and, he'd thought, his friend as well, in a way. Tristram is the one who brought him into their lives. Doctor Watson made Tristram feel special: he wanted to hear about his soil experiment, he gave him the phone, he told Tristram he was brilliant, and he asked for Tristram's help to make Emily feel safer. He pushed Tristram on the swing, just this morning. But maybe none of it was because of Tristram. Maybe Tristram's father was the one he was interested in all along. His stomach tightens, in an unpleasant way.
"Wait." Sherlock goes out of the room, but comes back less than a minute later. He turns on the bedside lamp and climbs back over John, settling next to him on his side.
What was it that had put John off? It wasn't the relationship itself. John had never shown any signs of being jealous of either Lestrade or Molly, and in fact had expressed spontaneous delight and pleasure upon first hearing the news. It wasn't until Sherlock had mentioned he was going to be involved as the best man that John had retreated and extended his bristles. Did he think Sherlock was going to fill their shared living space with sample books, mock-ups, menus, and scale models the way they had for John's wedding?
Father takes his teacup to the table and sets it down next to his computer.
"The candle," I said when he relinquished my lips for a moment to take a breath. "Use the candle on me again."
"You can knock on the door and I'll come out and help you. But only if it's really a bad dream, or if you or Tris are sick." Doctor Watson looks at Tristram too, including him in the rule.
"Good night," Tristram says softly.
"We're here tonight to publicly acknowledge and thank Mr Holmes and the Baker Street School for the incredible opportunity which they are affording our wonderful city." The mayor paused for the expected applause. "Now, in honour of this occasion and much against the council's wishes, the mayor's parlour has overruled the council, and would like to offer the cathedral ruins as a venue for your show."

Father looks down at Tristram and frowns. "Pulling that suitcase is putting too much strain on your back. Why didn't you say anything?"
"Everyone take out a sheet of paper and write out all ten of this week's spelling words, making your best attempt to disguise your handwriting. Do not put your name on your paper. Mr Watson will then collect them. Anyone whose paper I cannot immediately identify and who has spelled all ten words correctly is absolved from additional homework tonight. Everyone else will write ten sentences incorporating the words. You may begin."
John stays right where he is as Sherlock undoes the buttons. The twin points of contact where their legs are touching function as both anchor and fulcrum. It keeps Sherlock grounded in the here and now, but this is a tipping point. It could still go either way.
"Aw, now you're making me blush," Moriarty croons.
"Oh, no, I-" John starts to protest politely, but Irene cuts across him with a little irritated sound.
"They're not from Mrs Hudson, are they?" Tristram ventures.
Six eager hands shot into the air.
John pushes himself back from the railing and goes back inside. "Five minutes for what? What are we still doing here?"
%%%%%
But no; Sherlock wasn't in investigation mode when John left. He was drifting back and forth between his bedroom and his desk, picking up periodicals that had accumulated during his hospital stay and dropping them like a breadcrumb trail on his circuit when nothing succeeded in piquing his interest.
"You do it then," Sherlock retorted, looking up from his phone. "Or do you have to start a war somewhere? It's Christmas, surely even you can let the world muddle along on its own for a few hours."
"Or it could have been someone local, cutting across the property on their way home," John offers.
It had been Mary's idea for Sherlock to try on rings too that day. They'd all laughed at how ridiculous it was, but he'd tried them on anyway. It had turned out he and John had the same ring size. Sherlock's fingers just looked thinner because they were longer, his knuckles more prominent, but in the end the same ring had fit both him and John. Mary had been delighted, Sherlock uncomfortable, and John... confused by the complicated pride and fear at seeing the matching rings on his and Sherlock's fingers. He'd quickly shoved those feelings away, as quickly as Sherlock had taken off the ring and put another one on from a different display, as if to erase the presence of the first one.
Is he going to vomit? He thinks about his stomach, about the thick yellow pie filling sitting there like a huge lump of the stuff that ends up in the tissue when he blows his nose when he's sick; about the bits of dirt and germs that might be in there from the finger; and especially about there possibly being part of the finger in there too, some pieces of meat come off the bones like tender, greasy chicken, and yes. He is going to vomit.
"Up in Kilmarnock. He's serving a mandatory life sentence but he'll be eligible for parole next year."
"But what does it mean?" Mrs Hudson asks, looking from one man to the other.
Just then, the text alert sounded that signalled one of the carbon-copied messages from Dimmock's phone. Sherlock took his mobile out to check it - unlikely it was anything pertinent, but he couldn't afford to miss that one tip-off he was waiting for, and the distraction was just what he needed at the moment. And - bingo! An address, sent from the number of one of the officers who worked under Dimmock. They must have called him to let him know he was needed, then texted him the address so he wouldn't have to write it down. It could, of course, be another case altogether, but that might be interesting as well. In any event, Sherlock would at least get to see just how incompetent the police were in the course of their evidence-gathering.
Sherlock shakes his head. His chin brushes the side of John's head. "No," he says. "It's better this way. They'll come at the assignment without prejudice."
"Er... This way?" John inclined his head to the right. "Or... did you mean to store my things in the other bedroom? Sorry, I just thought-"
And then the window explodes.
After they've eaten and put their dishes in the sink - Tristram hoping guiltily that Mrs Hudson will come up later to wash up for them - they settle on the couch and turn on the television. Father has moved to one of the armchairs, where he's sprawled out behind a newspaper. He lowers one corner of the paper to glance at the screen as Tristram flicks through the channels, snorts, and buries himself in his reading again.
"Possibly. Once," Sherlock allowed. "Just for the christening. If you'd want me to be there."
"She'll stay here with us, of course," Vi said briskly. "Let the two of them go out and enjoy themselves. They can stay as late as they want, and sleep in Sherlock's old room afterwards. We can have Rosie in here with us. Do you think we should buy a cot for when she visits? On the other hand, I suppose she won't be small for much longer. They can bring her travel cot. I'm sure I saw one propped up in the hall when we were there."
How did they go from rooftop chases and dim sum, lazy Sundays and taking down crimelords to infidelity, shooting up, and flatlining on the operating table?
That actually does sound like fun. However, he is suspicious of the reason for it. Why would both Emily and her father need to stay at their flat? He'd almost think it's a ploy for Father and Doctor Watson to share a bed some more, but they still aren't saying more than necessary to each other, and when they get to their flat, Father brings out some bedding and drops it on the couch for Emily's father. Tristram is a little relieved about that, but it makes him wonder even more what the purpose of the visit is.
Drain the fries well and pat dry in batches with paper towels. Fry each batch, turning frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes or until the fries are a pale blond color and limp. Remove with a mesh skimmer to the baking sheet lined with paper towels.
"Maybe we'd best be making a move," John suggested. "Gladstone could probably do with a walk by now."
"Yeah, just a bit of a dick," he heard faintly just before the door closed behind him.
Sherlock knew whatever he said next was crucial. He couldn't afford another misstep. John wasn't staying away because the play had been cancelled. That much was glaringly obvious. He was staying away because of Sherlock. Ergo he wasn't going to come back for any reason relating to Sherlock. But he would come back for the play. The conclusion was therefore also obvious.
"Mm," Sherlock hummed. It wasn't his age or energy level that had seen him slipping out of the side room to find refuge in the main seating area. He'd simply felt entirely out of place, uninterested and uninteresting, an object of curiosity to those of Lestrade's friends who'd never met him, and of anything ranging from disdain to mild amusement and even pity to those who had. John and Lestrade had both made attempts to draw him into the group, Lestrade pushing a pint glass into his hand and encouraging him to loosen up, and John making comments to him about the match or asking for Sherlock's input whenever he -- John -- was talking to one of the other men.
The driver has backed the car out of the garage, and they are on their way out of the subdivision. Emily has arranged his arm on her lap so she can write on the cast too. Tristram watches as she settles in for what looks like an extensive doodle. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees something else, too. Doctor Watson's hand has migrated from Tristram's leg to Father's. It's just resting there, gripping Father's knee. Doctor Watson is still half turned so his arm can reach back between the seats, but he has his eyes ahead, watching the road. Father is looking out the side window again, just like he was on the way here. Tristram keeps his head angled exactly so that it looks like he's watching Emily. She's drawing what looks like some kind of cartoon mouse with unnaturally large ears and teeth. Beside him, Father lifts his hand from the seat and places it over Doctor Watson's on his leg. He doesn't move it until they get to the airport.
"What's that?" Doctor Watson glances down at her, although he keeps most of his attention on Father, who is, it seems, permanently several steps ahead of them.
2 tablespoons milk
"Tickets to the circus?" Emily guesses. Tristram is impressed; it looks like she was thinking along the same lines as him, but didn't take quite enough time to reason things out as far as he did.
"I don't see how."
Mr Holmes grunted, in acknowledgement, John thought at first, but then he noticed him grimacing again.
And then together:
"That sounds tortuous." And disconcertingly appealing. But he wouldn't have to make the decision one way or the other now.
Tristram scratches at his arm. Something's been bothering him there all day, like a tag on the back of a t-shirt rubbing against his skin. He supposes it's a good sign, like the itching on his back, indicating that it's healing. Doctor Watson and Father are still talking. He can't hear what they're saying through the closed door, but he can hear their voices, switching off between his father's lower register and Doctor Watson's slightly higher one. The tempo and volume remain controlled and even, so they're probably not arguing about anything. Just talking, like they were at the restaurant. Tristram wonders whether Father's ever talked as much as he has since he met Doctor Watson. Were all those words pent up inside him the whole time, waiting for someone to hear them? Or is he just finding them now, like pebbles laid out on a path that he never would have wandered down if he hadn't met Doctor Watson?
"This counts as payment for the play. You can't ask anything else."
Tristram almost wants to say something, but what? Emily will be anxious if she and her father sleep in different rooms. He thinks of her going downstairs at their flat to find her father when it wasn't even properly morning, and at the safe house bringing her blanket down from the bedroom so she could curl up on the living room floor at his feet. No matter how they arrange it, someone will be unhappy. And to tell the truth, having himself and Father together in the living room is probably the best possible outcome for Tristram. It will be just like those nights at their flat when Tristram sleeps on the couch and Father sits at his desk or falls asleep in one of the armchairs. With the additional bonus for Tristram of being able to sleep on a spacious mattress rather than on the narrow couch. So he doesn't say anything.
"Checking on something." The answer is probably meant to be reassuring in its vagueness, the same way Mrs Hudson sometimes says Father 'just popped out for a bit' when he comes home from school to an empty flat. It doesn't stop Tristram from thinking of guns and knives; nor does it stop Father from re-appearing, sometimes not until the next day (or even longer) with tender ribs and black eyes and clothes that don't look like his and smell like sick or worse.
"Thank you," she says, and smooths one hand over her still dark hair, which is pulled back into a neat knot at the back of her head. "You must be my son's associate."
"Well, we really have to be going," Sherlock said.
"Yes."
"You're going to have to get yourself in," his father says as he bends down to set Tristram gently onto the ground. He opens the door, and Tristram climbs onto the back seat, dragging along the blanket that's still wrapped around him. A moment later, Emily joins him, also with a blanket. She looks small and pale, and she's peering out at her father, who's standing next to the car, saying something to Tristram's father. Tristram looks away, because they don't look happy.
Tristram opens his mouth to ask Emily if she's ever played Snap, but she's twisting a finger in her hair fretfully, and he remembers she's going to see the lady, so he closes his mouth again and scuffs his shoe against the pavement.
Father glares at her, and Doctor Watson says conversationally, "Shut up, Harry." He steps back and puts his hands in his pockets. "Go on," he says to Father, tilting his head at the door. "Get out of here. We'll see you tomorrow." He's still smiling.
John considers, looking down at his clasped hands. "I don't know. Advised waiting, probably. There wasn't any immediate threat."
He opens his maths book and tries to concentrate on his sums. The sooner he finishes, the sooner they can go to Emily's.
Doctor Watson shifts around a bit so he can see Emily better. That means the reason he doesn't want to read it is because of Emily. "Because they talk about something very sad happening," he says.
"What were you thinking, putting me in charge of the play?" Sherlock demanded later in Lestrade's office. "I thought we agreed after what happened five years ago I wouldn't do it again." He paced in the small room like a caged tiger, trying to figure out what Lestrade's motive could possibly be for such a hateful move. Sherlock hadn't done anything particularly awful lately, certainly nothing that deserved a punishment this extreme.
Doctor Watson is standing next to Father now by the counter, one hand on his shoulder and leaning in close while Father stirs sugar into his tea. It looks like Father's explaining something to Doctor Watson and Doctor Watson's listening intently - not upset or unhappy like he sometimes is when Father tells him his plans. In fact, he keeps nodding and murmuring things back with a serious, earnest expression, so he must agree. Unfortunately, their voices are too low for Tristram to hear. Plus, Emily keeps up a steady stream of chatter on topics such as who else in her class has been snowboarding, what a shame it is her phone doesn't have a camera, as she wants to take lots of pictures for Tristram, and where in the world her fuzzy blue socks are. The steady noise and flurry of motion she makes as she gets ready is actually starting to get to Tristram. Just when he thinks he's going to have to get up and go back into the bedroom to calm his head down, Doctor Watson and Father step away from the counter together.
Sherlock brushes his knuckles against the back of John's hand on the steering wheel, then leans back against the door on his side and concentrates on his mobile.
"Or I would have come to you."
Time: 15:02

"My bus stop's-" John jerked his head back up the road.
"You're fine," John soothed him. "You're not going to come yet. Just a little longer, hm?" John didn't think Sherlock was at his limit yet, but John himself nearly was. He might have to step out and take care of himself at this rate before he was able to continue.
"I generally find interactions with other people outside of criminal investigations messy and awkward. Within the scope of investigations as well, come to that." He smirks wryly, and John chuckles in sympathy. "What I'm trying to say, is-"
"Anticipation's half the fun, old man," Greg said knowingly, squeezing Molly's hand against his thigh under the table.
"Rona?" John grinned, half embarrassed and half flattered.
Sherlock tosses his hands in the air. "Why does everyone think I have some secret formula for making John Watson happy?" he cries, genuinely irritated.
But Emily is a girl, and she has some silly ideas, like her aunts. She also thought that his father and Doctor Watson were kissing, but Tristram hasn't seen any evidence to support that theory. And, his father actually told him that he and Doctor Watson were going to be working on a case tonight.
"Not at all, look at the way his skates are laced up-"
The usher hurried off. Sherlock looked at John triumphantly.
"I'm going to turn it off now, Sherlock," John warned him before reaching underneath him and bindly fumbling until he'd found the button to make the device fall still and silent. John lifted his head, and as he did, his eyes met Sherlock's watching him with an expression of dazed wonder, as if half confused what John was doing there, or perhaps how he himself had wound up in that position. Sherlock tried to raise his head a little bit further, maybe to see better, maybe to say something, but at that point, John found he couldn't wait another moment longer. He heaved himself up and lunged for Sherlock's lips. Their mouths met in a frantic, chaotic clash of breath and heat and wetness, whispers of praise and wordless affirmations. John settled with his legs on either side of Sherlock's body, his hands on Sherlock's face, in his hair, stroking up his arms and down his sides as he kissed him and kissed him.
"Maybe," Tristram says. "I think my father finished whatever he needed to go there for, though."
Something loosened inside Sherlock. John. His Something. "She's married," he said gently. He nodded at the dance floor, where his erstwhile dancing partner had her arms wrapped around the neck of a dashing, square-jawed, broad-shouldered man, gazing at him with stars in her eyes.
"Her dubious matchmaking attempts, you mean?"
"What?"
Quite aside from the fact that Irene and Father, for all that they were civil to each other the two times Tristram saw them together, don't make each other laugh the way John and Father do. They don't look at each other and seem to say lots more with their eyes and their hands and their shoulders and knees than comes out of their mouths. It doesn't make Tristram happy to think about Father and Irene together the way it does thinking about Father and John together. And it doesn't wrench at Tristram to think that Irene and Father might not actually like each other all that much the way it does when he thinks about the argument two nights ago, when John said he was going to take Emily and leave Tristram and Father behind.
"Shut up."
"I thought you didn't want this anymore," John mumbled against his shoulder, his hands bunching up the t-shirt across Sherlock's back. "I thought-"
Sherlock undid his flies, lifted his hips and pulled off his trousers and pants together, kicking them away onto the floor.
"We're on holiday," Father murmurs absently.
Emily thanks her and takes an orange one. The shop assistant holds the bowl up for John and Irene. John takes an orange one like Emily, but Irene politely declines and the woman doesn't press the issue.
John smiled, perhaps equally at the prospect and at Sherlock's reaction. "It's a bit early, they don't even know if it's a boy or a girl yet, but Mike and Shelly asked me to be the godfather."
"He was nice!" Tristram says defensively, even though he knows it won't help much. "He told me he was there to protect us."
He watched Sherlock shift gears. His hand close to John's knee. Then back on the steering wheel. John closed his eyes, the sense memory of Sherlock's hand last night in bed under his rising to the forefront of his mind. The prominent knuckles, the long fingers. Warm and strong. He hadn't moved away. He'd put his leg over John's. Held him close, against his body, his heart pounding. Both their hearts pounding. John couldn't imagine doing something like that now, putting his hand on Sherlock's. Or Sherlock reaching over to pat John's leg. Where was the line? What had blurred it beyond all recognition last night, only to re-draw it so straight and clear today?
Now, he strains to hear something - anything. He fancies he hears voices; probably his father and Doctor Watson, discussing whatever they couldn't discuss before with Tristram and Emily around. Something about the reason they're here. He listens harder, but now he can't hear anything at all. Either they've stopped talking, or they've gone somewhere else to continue. The silence presses in on his ears.
"What?" Emily prompts him.
"No, I... no," John mutters, not looking at her. He's still warring with himself, but really there's no question. Sherlock showing up has effectively thrown a bucket of cold water over whatever it was that prompted him to agree to Janine's proposal.
"The curtain was -" Tristram tries to explain, but his throat closes off before he can finish the sentence. His heart is racing and it feels like he can hardly breathe. He swallows past the tightness and tries again. "The curtain was open!" There, he got it out this time, but it still feels like his throat won't open up far enough to let air in. He hasn't been poisoned again, has he?
They leave Uncle Mycroft's car at Llanbroc and drive back to London in an old, blue compact. It smells like something's burning the whole way, and Father's knees are actually pressed up against the dash, even with the front seat pushed back as far as it will go. Doctor Watson laughs, and Tristram and Emily giggle too.
"She'll forgive you, John," Sherlock sighs. "What am I saying, there's nothing to forgive, and she knows that too. You can go back to her whenever you're ready. She loves you." Sherlock adds that last bit because it's the kind of thing that matters to John.
"You still with me, Sherlock?" John asked gently from where he sat next to him, and put his hand on Sherlock's face. Maybe it was enough already. Maybe Sherlock had forgotten about the abused and mottled corpse they'd found. Too late, too late. Or if not forgotten, then at least locked away for the time being, tucked away in a secure corner of his mind palace where it wouldn't bother him for a few hours.
"So no one's coming with us?" Nisha asks.
Grandmother raises her eyebrows very slightly but doesn't say anything.
Irene gives him a long, musing look. "No..." she says slowly, and looks like she's going to add something else when the waiter comes over.
Emily, however, doesn't seem to pick up on any of the undertones. She smiles brightly at the woman and looks like she might say something, but just then Doctor Watson wads up his serviette, drops it on his plate, and pushes his chair back like he's going to get up. It's a threatening move, but the woman doesn't so much as flinch.
Father makes a negative sound. "I haven't seen him."
Then he walked toward his bedroom, pulling John after him.
"Holmes, let me, please," I begged, putting my hands on his hips, but he was too far gone to respond or perhaps even understand what I offered. Rather than force the matter or interrupt his progress, I settled for touching him wherever else I could: his face, his back, his chest. I deposited kisses of encouragement and praise on his head, words of gratitude and approbation on his ears as he worked his fist furiously inside his trousers.
"Right," Watson said slowly, "well, I was thinking, do you want to come for a Sausage Sizzler?" He pointed vaguely over his shoulder.
Tristram doesn't know whether he's meant to go with Doctor Watson or stay with Father. Neither of them say anything, and he's honestly tired of dragging his suitcase around, so he stands it up on end and sits down on it next to Father while Doctor Watson and Emily go to the bakery.
Layer lasagna noodles with the sauce mixture, ending with sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
John hears the hotel room door open then snick quietly shut. He lays his book aside and goes out to the living room. Sherlock is there, taking off his coat. John glances automatically at the pulled out couch bed. Tristram and Emily are sleeping soundly, both on their backs with their heads turned slightly toward each other, as if they were just talking and dropped off.
"What-- you're not jealous, are you? You're welcome to the job." He hadn't thought it was that important. John rarely saw Lestrade outside of their investigations. But then John rarely saw anyone outside of their investigations and his own erratic locum assignments. He'd never actually gone back to work full-time. Maybe Sherlock had underestimated the strength of his friendship with the inspector.
1/3 cup oyster sauce
Tristram shrugs. "Dunno." He doesn't really want to think about it. Yesterday's outing was bad enough. But if they all go somewhere again today... The prospect of seeing his father and Doctor Watson together again the way they were at the beach isn't something he thinks he could handle right now. But he's not going to have any choice, is he? Although they didn't seem to appreciate Tristram walking in on them last night, they apparently don't care who sees them kissing when they're outside. Although they probably didn't think Tristram was watching them from beneath his fringe.
"Good guess, but no," her father answers. "Tris, do you want to take a guess?"
There are other interesting parts to the garden, like the hollow bush that you can hide in, and the pond that gets black with tadpoles, but Tristram settles for simply pointing them out today. Maybe if the weather clears up later on, they can come back and play. He also tries to explain to Emily and Doctor Watson how to play rat-in-the-maze or circuit-breaker on the paths, which makes Emily look confused and Doctor Watson shake his head and smile and say, "Amazing." Tristram smiles too, even if he's not sure what's so special about a silly game.
"I know you didn't want all this fuss and to-do," John said. "But-"
"So, what, if I hadn't been involved, you would have left them alone?"
"If you wanted to, you could fuck me tonight."
"What?!" John yelped.
"No. It's not," Father agrees. He leans forward to resume typing. "Which is why it's imperative that we go along with it."
His mobile buzzed.
Doctor Watson laughs. "I already told you it's not candy."
and the
Tristram doesn't need to be told to stay flat against the wall, hidden from view by his father's big coat, while his father works on the lock. It takes perhaps thirty seconds before the door swings silently open and the two of them can slip through. Then they are running down the stairs. Father, still holding his prize, has to wait for him at every landing, as Tristram has to take a bit of care not to jostle his arm on the railings, but he doesn't once tell him to go faster or hurry up. They probably don't need to run - no one has noticed they've left yet - but Tristram's so excited about their escape that he doesn't think he could walk slowly anyway, and Father apparently feels the same way. Tristram is thrilled. It's like being on a mission together! This must be what it's like for his father when he is on a case.
Father requests coffee as well, and barely waits for the waiter to move away before remarking, "All this time abroad and you never bothered to learn the language?"
Sherlock screwed his face up. "'Girl meets boy'? Is this the Nativity or some soppy, dumbed-down Romeo and Juliet?"
The air was suddenly pierced by a sharp, shrill whistle coming from someone behind them. At the same time, a lusty shout of, "Yeeeaaah! Get it, son!" That was Greg.
"You too, Em," he says to Emily once Sherlock's disappeared into the bathroom. "Let's get you tucked in." He puts his arm around her shoulders and steers her out to the living room, where a pillow and duvet are spread on the couch. The lightweight curtains that used to adorn the windows have been replaced by heavy, dark drapes that are currently pulled tightly shut.
"Nothing," Father says and switches off the light. "Go back to sleep."
"You have absolutely nothing to be sorry for," John says. He takes his hand away from Tristram's wrist but stays crouched down next to him. The stool is high enough that Tristram's looking down on him. "You reacted just right."
"What, you want … All right, I just thought-"
"Now do you see?"
Irene is perched on top of the desk, facing forward as if waiting for company. She has her gloved hands folded demurely in her lap and her legs dangle playfully over the edge. She inclines her head slightly in Sherlock and John's direction and gives them a cool smile.
The screen goes black. John's hand tightens on Sherlock's shoulder, but half a second later, the display comes back, this time showing a directory. Sherlock starts scrolling rapidly through it. John lets out his breath and squeezes Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock reaches up his left hand and covers John's hand with his.
Sherlock doesn't say anything for a bit. John's eyes are still open, watching the door.
Sherlock was most definitely not disappointed. It seemed that he had the answer to the question of what would happen if he let things take their course: nothing at all. John must have gotten fed up with Sherlock's intrusive observations, odd obsessions, and abrupt about-faces. It was clear that he still felt some degree of attraction, if the way he'd watched Sherlock earlier while setting up and his reaction to hearing Sherlock play were any indication. But he had probably, like Sherlock earlier, decided that pursuing anything personal was a bad idea.
The bathroom door opened. It was suddenly very still.
"Mm, yes," Sherlock agreed. He tried to ignore the pleasant clenching in his stomach and willed his heart to slow back down.
"And yet?"
"So there is a play at least," Moran fished.
"Is it the bogeyman?" Tristram ventures to ask, once his father is finished with his own interrogation.

"Mycroft is not a god, no matter how much he'd like to believe it! He's an over-ambitious bureaucrat with some good connections and a flair for the dramatic. His 'magical powers' are limited to wiretapping and accessing classified information. That's it. There is nothing on this 'M'-" Sherlock flings his arm derisively toward the phone in John's hand. "-in any of the files. He's calling himself Jim Moriarty, but we're not even certain that's his real name. He's a blank spot on the map,
Tristram's not sure what to say to that, so he shrugs. "It's okay." It's true he's rarely, if ever, bored, a complaint many of their schoolmates often voice.
"Here." John handed Sherlock the cover of the DVD he'd just put into the player.
John huffs out a laugh. "Sherlock, I think I would quite literally do anything you wanted me to, which is a fairly frightening thought. But for this..." John takes a deep breath and looks Sherlock square in the eye. "Did you get an enema kit, along with the condoms and lubricant?"
"I have a job, the kids have school, we can't just-"
Time: 15:59
John stops where he is, halfway between the bathroom and Sherlock. He clenches his fists at his sides. "Are you sure this time?"
"Mm. I didn't want to put her on the spot by correcting her." A slight frown.
Tristram's father smirks and lifts his wine glass. "No one did, John, that's why they called me in."
"What you said about Clara was unacceptable, though," he says firmly. "Especially in front of Emily and Tris."
At any rate, Tristram suggests the game to Emily now, and although she doesn't seem very enthusiastic, she agrees to go over to his room to at least take a look. Doctor Watson looks relieved and mouths 'thank you' at Tristram when Emily isn't looking, which pleases Tristram inordinately.
Sherlock watched his penis disappear into the shadowy cleft of John's arse. The reading lamp on the nightstand was turned toward the wall, which absorbed most of its illumination but left the bedroom suffused in a grayish twilight. Sherlock let John think it a compromise. John would have preferred the lights off completely, was self-conscious of his middle-aged body, but Sherlock was equally eager - perhaps more so - not to have his face on full display. He was a master of dissembling, but he suspected that his expression might reveal more than he was ready to admit to - even to himself - during these interludes. John might be infuriatingly unobservant in general, but he had an uncanny way of seeing past Sherlock's masks at the most inopportune moments.
Using electric beaters or a tabletop mixer, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla and ¼ tsp salt together until pale and fluffy, then pour in the eggs, one at a time, giving the mix a really good beating before adding the next. Add 1 tbsp of the plain flour if the mix starts to look slimy rather than fluffy. Beat in the yogurt.
Tristram thinks hard. His first idea is a tracking device, but the second clue said that he and Emily could also use whatever it is, and there's not really any way for the person carrying the tracking device to 'use' it. You just let it sit in your pocket, or shoe, or wherever. What is something that he could use in an emergency (for the sake of argument, any emergency, not just poisoning or getting lost) and that would let his father know where he was? His thoughts veer back to Friday Afternoon. He tries to push the images away, but one scene dangles itself in front of him, demanding his attention: in the car, Emily nicked her aunt's phone for him to text his father and tell him where they were going. Yes. He gets a tingly feeling, like something in his brain has slotted into place. He wonders if this is how his father feels when he solves something.
It turned out that John had meant allowing the children to indulge their materialistic fantasies of a Christmas morning filled with mind-numbing electronics, ill-conceived gender-conformist bits of toxic plastic, unhealthy mass-produced confections that barely deserved to be called edible, and anything else the consumption- and profit-driven socio-industrial complex was advertising this year. Sherlock refused point-blank to have anything to do with the assignment, and left the lot for John to deal with and sort through over lunch. He may have made a bit of extra fuss to ensure that John didn't interrupt him while he checked his messages and made some calls. One lunch break without John was a fair sacrifice in order to ensure having him around every evening in future.
"I've kept it fairly simple. C Major, nothing more complicated than a couple of major sevenths." He stood close to John, without quite touching, although he did let his sleeve brush John's arm when he reached over to set the pages on the music stand.
"Will Mr Watson be here this afternoon?" Saffron asked at the end of the morning lessons.
Sherlock nods and runs lightly down the stairs.
"It hurts a bit," I admitted. "But not the worst I've ever had. It's like being pricked with a dozen needles, but quite localized. The initial shock was the worst part, although I can still feel them now."
Despite my agreement, Watson did not let go of my arm, as if afraid I might dart away behind one of the macabre funereal statuary at the next opportunity. In truth, I found our sudden proximity discomfiting, his elbow nestled firmly against my ribs and his hip bumping mine as we started down one of the crushed-stone paths. We used to walk like this, back in those carefree days before he married: arms entwined, adjusting our strides to keep abreast, an automated synchronicity borne of a physical familiarity much more intimate than that which we put on public display.
Irene stares down at Moriarty's body. A spill of blood pools and spreads beneath his head. His blank eyes are fixed in an expression of mild surprise. She titters, high and nervy.
Lestrade relented, saying, "Look, if you're worried about what happened five years ago... I think you've adjusted your expectations accordingly in the mean time. You know what these kids can do, and what they can't. You're not going to get BAFTAs and BRITs out of them. Just have them sing a couple of carols and walk through the parts. The script's already been written for two thousand years."
When they get to the top, it's still foggy - or cloudy. Most of the people they were on the cable car with set right off down the path leading away from the station and disappear within a matter of seconds. A few hang around adjusting their equipment and consulting the maps and charts displayed on the wall of the little shed housing the station. Father wanders over to look at the maps and charts too, while Tristram, Emily and Doctor Watson go out to the path.
John chuckles. "Tease," he murmurs. He slides his hand further under Sherlock's shirt, palming his abdomen and side and rubbing his thumb over one nipple. All the time, his eyes never leave Sherlock's face. With his other hand, he reaches around and pulls the shirt up at the back. "All right?" he asks.
"Not exactly," Doctor Watson says.
"You re-wrote it," John said. He was standing closer than he had last night. Close enough that Sherlock could have touched him without any effort at all. He flipped the lighter around and around.
He must fall asleep again, because he finds himself waking up at some point later during the night. There's no light seeping in around the edges of the curtains, so it must still be well before dawn. He listens for what might have woken him but can't hear anything other than Emily breathing steadily on the other side of the mattress. Tristram turns carefully onto his other side to try and find a more comfortable position. He breathes in sharply and his heart jumps when he sees a faint, dark form in one of the chairs next to the sofa bed.
"No, you're making dates behind my back with mysterious old acquaintances you refuse to tell me about, lying to me about it, then not even going and lying to me about
A residual arousal tingled in Sherlock's abdomen, and something else, too, that made him want to reach over and take John's hand where it was clenched on top of his thigh. Sherlock scowled out the window and tightened his arms. This was not him. Not who he wanted to be. He needed to be sharp and focused, not soppy and sentimental. He couldn't afford to cede any more territory in his mind palace. John had already taken over an alarming amount of real estate, and Sherlock had almost died in Serbia because of it. He'd been distracted, maudlin, pining for God's sake. He'd gotten sloppy and been caught, and even then, the only thing he'd been able to think about was how all that effort was going to be wasted if he couldn't get back to John. He didn't even care about wrapping up the rest of the loose ends he'd been tracking, which had allowed Mary to slip right past his radar.
Sherlock watches him until he disappears around a bend and he's left alone amidst the barren rocks. Then he starts up the path again.
Tristram taps the phone once to answer his father's question. Then he realises that he can probably speak again now, and adds, "Yes."
"Okay, I pushed the button for my father," she tells him in her normal voice, with her hand in her pocket, because of course she's not supposed to take her phone out. Tristram's hands are shaking and he can't remember what he's supposed to do if he can't talk to her.
"Like this?" Sherlock settled his body against John's and nuzzled against his cheek.
And then John slid his arm all the way around him, and Sherlock turned onto his side, and they were hugging. Bodies pressed together, length for length, fists in shirts, gripping hard. Noses to necks, breath in ears, lips on jaws, and somehow they were kissing. Somehow, their hands were in each other's hair, trembling over shoulders and backs, venturing down and sweeping up again. Slow, soft, wondrous, both familiar and new.
John widens his eyes, staring first at Sherlock's genitals then slowly raising his gaze once again to his face. "Hello," he says, sounding somewhat stunned, yet not in any way averse to the development.
"Can you tell me now what you saw?" Father asks. He's still holding onto Tristram's hand, pressing it to get his attention.
"-I thought you'd given up on me, and everyone said you'd never-"
There's already a cab waiting for them. Father stares out the window as the driver makes his way through the evening traffic, absent in a way that says he's thinking about a case. Tristram shouldn't interrupt him. Who knows how long this case will go on for, though. And maybe Father could use Doctor Watson's help.
John is looking at the picture again now though. He speaks with an almost forced briskness: "Or — just one more — later, when she could talk, you and she sitting on the floor with the skull between you, and she's reciting all the bones as you point to them."
John rolled his eyes good-naturedly at the children, who giggled back.
Wow, I can't believe it's almost over! Thank you to everyone who's been reading along and making it as fun for me as it hopefully is for you. Just one more chapter to go, to be posted next Tuesday!
"Actually," Doctor Watson says, "I'd like to borrow your dad for a bit." He reaches up to take his own coat down, keeping his eyes on Tristram's father. "There's something I need to talk to him about."
John was in a good mood all afternoon, laughing and joking. He sat next to Father on the way there so that Emily and Tristram could both ride facing forward, and at one point he and Father put their hands on top of each other on Father's leg, the same way they did in the car on the way to the airport the first time, before Mister Tonga was arrested. Tristram wouldn't have said John seemed particularly worried before, but now it was as if his whole body was lighter and his whole face kept pulling upward. Tristram began to see what Emily meant about how her father used to be, before her mother was killed.
"I had to be ready half an hour early in order to come get you," Sherlock complained.
"Just for the weekend," he says. It sounds like a warning.
Sherlock started to turn his head to look behind him but caught himself halfway.
"Still nothing," he mutters as he comes back inside.
Doctor Watson looks at her in surprise, then at Tristram, then back at Emily. "Oh really?" He sounds more amused than angry.
"It's all right," Father's voice says softly. "It's me." A weak light comes on, illuminating his face. It's the screen light from his phone.
The six of them were seated around a round table, John to Sherlock's left, making little appreciative sounds at every new dish. It was a kind of exquisite torture. An exclamation of surprise at the black bean and avocado salsa. A groan after the first spoonful of pork and pancetta pie. "Sherlock, you have to try the mini stuffed peppers. You like them? I wonder what's in the filling. Think I could try something like this. Molly, do you think your cousin would share the recipe?" John leaning across Sherlock to reach the parsnips roasted in honey. Taking two and putting one on Sherlock's plate. A quick smile, knowing Sherlock's particular weakness for honey. Their chairs closer than necessary. The simplest explanation: John had unconsciously created a buffer zone between his left hand and Posy's right, on his other side. He and Sherlock didn't even need to think about it anymore, the two of them always gravitating into position such that their dominant hands were on opposite sides for maximum mobility and dexterity. A pleasant thought, if fruitless.
"I'm sure he made it out, then," Mycroft says, but he still sounds strained.
Finally, John makes Tristram and Emily get under the covers and turns off the light. Rather than retreating to the bedroom, though, he settles himself in the same chair Father sat in the previous night.
They do go downstairs a short while later - hands and faces duly washed - and Mrs Hudson's right: it is more fun with three. After they've played several rounds, Emily asks her if she knows any more card games. Mrs Hudson thinks for a moment, shuffling the cards as she does. Tristram is fascinated by the way she riffles them over and through each other in a way that looks like a falling bridge. She's tried to show him how to do it, but he can never get his hands to cooperate. The cards invariably end up splattering all over the table.
It was all so tiresome. He'd been through all of the arguments with himself before, and he knew that the practical answer was to keep things as they were now. John had stated he wouldn't seek anything more. But the fact that he kept returning to the issue, and that every time he and John were together it became more difficult to stick to his resolution, indicated that he needed another solution.
"Yes," Sherlock says with round eyes, his hands twitching uselessly at his sides. "I think that's normal," he adds after a moment, uncertainly.
"My dad's clobbering your dad," Emily announces proudly.
By the time Mrs Holmes bustled in a little while later, the turkey had been deposited in the refrigerator to thaw, Sherlock had helped himself to some of the goodies already prepared on the sideboard, and John and Mr Holmes were chatting over a cup of tea at the kitchen table.
"You're not even looking," Sherlock says.
"So you are going to live with Sherlock and Tris?" Emily repeats, both obstinate and oblivious.

She understood how it worked: Sherlock provided the entire structure of John's life from the foundations to the gables, while Sarah was allotted one room to decorate. And she had fun doing it. Concerts, cuddles, chicken wings at the pub, Bonfire Night, a night in with a DVD sans fire alarms, and - not so occasionally - sex. Weekend getaways were apparently something she was allowed, too, which was actually somewhat surprising, as it meant John and Sherlock forgoing each other's company for at least 48 hours. Also because two- or three-day trips were something that John and Sherlock did, too (again, not like that), when there was an investigation that took them further afield.
"Oh, so now I'm stupid, is that it?"
Sherlock chuckled. He shouldn't have worried about John finding his living quarters odd. After all, John had never once suggested that anything about Sherlock was odd. In fact, he seemed to be fascinated by all those things that others found so off-putting.
"Your phone."
"No, you can turn it off. Mine's on."
But Sherlock doesn't seem put off by John's speech at all. In fact, he gets a small smile and says simply, "Okay."
&&&&&&
John was now working frantically at his cock even as he shifted his hips to help Sherlock find that elusive spot that would complete him. His chest and balls were tight and his arm was cramping with the effort of keeping up the pace on himself, especially after having just done the same service on Sherlock. Sherlock pressed himself even closer to John, if that were possible, his legs twined around John's and his face firmly ensconced in the crook of John's neck, where he was whispering something against John's skin that he couldn't understand. And then something inside John sparked as Sherlock's probing fingers honed in on their target.
"We have business at the dockyard," Sherlock said briskly, grimacing slightly as he drank the lukewarm tea.
"Yes. In fact, it turns out she's at Bart's. You won't have seen her, though. You're not mentioned on her chart."
Tristram nods and looks down at his shoes. "Yeah. Me too. And this lady can make you forget it?" He feels a little glimmer of hope as he asks, because if someone could simply wipe the entire incident from his mind, maybe he wouldn't always feel like he's about to be found out for having done something very wrong.
"That's not fair," Lestrade replied evenly. "It'd be the same with anyone else. Keep it professional."
goodnight sherlock
John pressed his lips together. He only spared the briefest of glances in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock felt unfairly accused; it was true, after all. Although he knew most people viewed his voicing of such opinions with a very critical eye.
%%%%%%
"I'm not talking about what happened after the distasteful business with Charles Magnussen. I
Sherlock breaks first, shaking with laughter for several long seconds before he's able to speak. "He actually does get called that on occasion."
John wrapped his fingers around the handle. The knife immediately felt like an extension of his hand. He touched the blade to his tongue and felt the instant sting of its sharpness. A knife like this was made for precision work. It was without a doubt the finest knife John had ever seen, much less had in his hand.
"He was hardly going to harm the raison d'etre of the entire scheme." The 'obviously' remains unspoken but understood.
After school, Doctor Watson is waiting for Tristram and Emily with a cab. Tristram expects they'll all go back to Baker Street, but Doctor Watson apologises and explains that with all the excitement that morning, he forgot Emily has an appointment to see the lady with the Geomag and the ping-pong. Tristram had forgot all about her too. Father said he'd make an appointment for Tristram, but he didn't, and now Tristram will just have to tag along and wait with Doctor Watson in the waiting room, which isn't fair at all. Emily doesn't think so, either, and says she won't go in without him, but Doctor Watson asks her to please not make it any more difficult, and Tristram can tell he's this close to losing his temper. Emily goes, dragging her feet.
"I know what I want, there's no sense in wasting time because of social convention."
"It's just for the play," John cautioned. "Just to give those kids something for all their hard work."
, more or less letting Gladstone take the lead, until they somehow ended up standing in front of Sherlock's house. The friendly, casual mood dissolved, leaving something uncertain in its wake. Which was stupid, because John had been inside before and everything had been fine that time and there was no reason to think anything would be different now. But John put his hands in his pockets and hunched his shoulders up against the wind.
"The hospital wasn't all that horrid," John said, amusement dancing on his lips. "The babies were cute."
"We're not doing it like this, Sherlock. This isn't one of the choices," John informed him evenly, even as he applied pressure on the dildo to angle it up more firmly against Sherlock's prostate.
John twists around and turns the bedside lamp off. It is several more seconds before Sherlock finally moves, swinging his legs up onto the bed. He lies down on his back beside John, his body stiff. John stays where he is on his side, not moving. After a couple of minutes, his eyes adjust enough to the dim light coming in from the street that he can see the pale shape of Sherlock's face. It is clear from the faint glistening of the moisture in his eyes that they are open.
"Close the curtain!" Father shouts.
"No. We should stop," she said firmly and got up onto her knees. "We're stopping."
Irene looks like she's weighing the consequences of shaking Father's hand, but after a few seconds she lifts her hand and puts it in his. "You're welcome," she says, like she's a little surprised about it herself.
"John, you can go on. I don't always... " There was nothing for it, he was going to have to say it. "It's not always possible for me to climax like this. I'm enjoying it quite a lot, but if you can... I want you to. I want you... inside me."
"Sherlock..." John said softly.
All song lyrics are from
Further, and of utmost importance, Sherlock would not allow himself to be attracted to or distracted by John. There was no point. He had certainly misinterpreted John's friendly overtures, and at any rate, Sherlock had no desire for any sort of emotional or physical entanglement. Although he might, possibly, be willing to sit at the same table with John during break time and interrogate him about his past experiences. Or even, if the aforementioned interrogation yielded positive and interesting results, to engage in a more extended interview over lunch.
John shook his head. "I can't trust my own judgment anymore, much less his."
"Yeah, all right, full points. There's something else, though." John waggled the envelope.
"He's a nice chap, I think you'll like him."
It's then that they hear voices in the kitchen - probably just the bodyguards talking, or someone coming in through the garage with a delivery - but then the door opens, and Father is standing there. He looks for all the world as if he's just come back from a quick visit to the British Museum, not at all like he's spent the past several hours in custody on suspicion of terrorism.
Father slides his phone into his pocket and settles back in the chair. Perhaps he really means to stay. Tension that Tristram wasn't even aware of drops out of his body. "Was it the bodyguard?" he ventures to ask.
Sherlock looks up with an expression of wonder and surprise. "Oh! Yes, exactly. John, you're a genius. Apparate! Tom Marvolo Riddle! That's why he's smart, not clever. Quick, what was his middle name?" Sherlock snaps his fingers several times at John.
"Christ, should have known," Doctor Watson says when he's able to speak again. "Tris, that was amazing."
Emily's father also doesn't want her to read the
"Homeless?"
John, oblivious to impending events, kept up a steady stream of innocuous and occasionally amusing comments as they walked back. His gait was still slightly off-kilter (leg still giving him twinges), and he was walking close enough that every now and then his arm or shoulder would bump against Sherlock, apparently without his notice. The casual contact, so matter-of-fact and familiar, combined with the pressures of the upcoming confession and his unresolved emotional turmoil over John proved to be too much for Sherlock's self-control.
Tristram finds he can move, despite the pain. He nods and shifts his legs a bit.
"Of course I 'get that'," Father retorts.
Father glances at Doctor Watson, then back at his food. "Childish," he mutters again, but Tristram can see the corners of his mouth fighting not to smile.
Sherlock was loath to imagine what his brother would ask for in return for this.
, full stop. You've seen things, and done things, and been through things that- Well, lots of grown-ups wouldn't have dealt with it all nearly as well as you have. But sometimes I …" He sucks in a deep breath. "I worry about you, Tristram. Just a little, just... I wonder what's going on in your head. What you're thinking. What you're feeling."
It didn't bother him as much as it probably should, John bastardising his original composition. He'd put a fair amount of effort into it, and been pleased with the result. It actually bothered him more that John was probably right: the song was too highbrow, both for the target audience and for the performers. He'd thought he was writing it with them in mind - and at some unacknowledged yet not entirely unconscious level, for John's approval - but subconsiously, he realised after John's statement earlier about the Blackwood School, he'd been writing it to compete with Moriarty.
"I've no idea," Irene says helplessly. "He grabbed for the rack, and I thought he'd slipped."
"The guard outside-" John glances toward the door.
"Mr Watson will not be back this afternoon, or ever, for that matter." It turned out that was surprisingly difficult to say, which didn't make any sense. It was simply a fact. No different than saying there were two hundred and forty-three types of tobacco, or Anderson was an idiot.
But it was less than a month to Christmas, and if, by some miracle, he and John were still on speaking terms by then, it would probably be appropriate for him to give John a present. He didn't normally care about being appropriate; he'd never given Lestrade anything, even though he was on the head teacher's gift list every year. But even if they decided not to be anything more than friends, Sherlock found to his surprise that he actually wanted to give John something. He wanted to make John smile, wanted to let him know that he valued his companionship, without the tedious business of forming words and sentences about it. He would have to give it more thought, though, at another time. For one thing, it wouldn't do at all to buy a Christmas present for John on Moriarty's territory.
Father's legs are long enough that his knees almost touch Doctor Watson's, but they don't actually touch. Doctor Watson takes another sip of his coffee. He grins at Father, then looks away, out the window, even though there's nothing to see there because of the darkness, trying to hide his grin in his coffee cup. Tristram looks up at Father, beside him. He's still watching Doctor Watson. He must feel Tristram's eyes on him, though, because he turns his head and looks at Tristram instead. His eyes click into focus, like he's just seen something.
John winced. "It was in the headlines this morning. And the local news. Don't you watch breakfast telly?"
Sherlock frowns. "As I said, by my estimation-"
Emily frowns. "Really? But he's a doctor, not a detective."
"Ohhh," John says, long and drawn-out, and it almost turns into a laugh at the end. "Of course. You made a deal. You're working with him, Sherlock said you were. So, what, if I hadn't come back you would have-" John presses his lips together and doesn't finish the sentence.
"Oh please, even you can't be that naïve. And by the way, 'the meeting about the plans'? Not really indictable."
John lifts his hand and carefully places it on top of Sherlock's where it's resting on the arm of his chair. "I can't go back home," he says soberly, his eyes resting on their hands.
"It might not have to do with you at all," John says mildly. "Rival gangs, revenge for a drug deal gone wrong, hell, maybe she stole someone's shoes," he suggests.
Tristram follows his father back down the hall to his room. They don't turn on the light, but Father uses his phone to light the way so they don't run into anything. Once they get to Tristram's room, though, he turns it off before going in, and now Tristram is truly walking blindly, his eyes not yet re-adjusted to the darkness.
Sherlock bent over as well as he could without John slipping out and met John's lips for a brief kiss, not nearly satisfying enough for either of them. Then, with a final effort, he relaxed down all the way and his buttocks met John's thighs. John was in.
"That might generate some sternly worded letters from parents," John said before returning the sentiment in kind.
"I could do that-" she started to say, ratcheting herself up onto her elbows, but he shook his head.
In a large pot, cook the peeled potatoes in salted water. In a large pan, saute the chopped onions, carrots, celery – cook until golden, add the frozen peas and lentils and cover to cook for a few minutes. Add a bit of water if these veggies start to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add in the corn, soy sauce, and season with cumin and thyme, salt and pepper. Keep covered, turn down the heat to low.
Tristram grins and opens the book. "Great. Here we go: 'The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it "the Riddle House..."'"
"Well, it's been a pleasure," John says as they all gather in the entrance hall. "We've had a great time, haven't we, Ems?"
"More, come on, these are going in your arse."
"Don't worry about me, then." He settles back in his original position.
John. He trusted him not to take more than Sherlock was able to give, and he trusted that whatever John asked of him, at least in this, it would feel good. Not just physically, but it made him feel good to be pleasing John. It was-
"I think one of his bodyguards is already here," Tristram blurts out in an attempt to smooth things over.
"John Watson has to go," Sherlock said without preamble. He stabbed the cane down onto the floor of the head teacher's office. It would have been a more impressive gesture if it hadn't been rubber-tipped.
As Tristram hands his own coat to Emily's father (he's too short to reach the hooks), he hears Emily's Aunt Harry say to his father in a low voice, "I just want you to know how incredibly grateful we all are to you, Sherlock. Not just for what you did last week, but for all of your help in uncovering what happened. I don't - Well, let's just say it's helped us all to find some closure."
We did not exchange many more words that night. They were not necessary. We had said what was in our hearts through our bodies and deeds. We cleaned up as well as we could with the basin and pitcher in Holmes' room, remade the bed, and lay together until shortly before dawn, when I reluctantly retreated to my room upstairs before the maid came in to stoke the fire.
The rest of the teachers were more or less surreptitiously listening in by this point. The jackals. Sherlock frowned and took a sip of his coffee. It was the perfect temperature now. If he got this over with quickly, he might still be able to enjoy it.
If anyone is interested in visiting Meiringen, here are some links:
"Do?" Sherlock screwed up his face as if she'd just proposed he let the children take turns throwing his violin off the school roof. "There's nothing to do. Eventually we'll be caught out, and we'll all be out of a job. You too, now that you know - which you can thank John for, by the way. The only thing we can do is prolong the inevitable."
They exchange several slow, lingering kisses, taking the time now to taste and gauge each other's reactions to each angle and caress.
"Yeah, I er... thought I'd sit out in the living room, maybe read a little. Should probably get the field bed down from Tristram's room too..." John jerks his head toward the hall.
Emily's already asleep. They didn't read together tonight. Tristram would have liked to, but Doctor Watson said it was too late when they got back from the restaurant, and Emily didn't protest. Reading together is really Doctor Watson and Emily's thing anyway, so Tristram didn't say anything either. Even though it would have been nice to have Doctor Watson sit with them a little while. And Father too, off to the side but paying more attention than it seems like. Maybe tomorrow.
"Have you any plans for the rest of the day, Watson?" I inquired.
Father and Doctor Watson both freeze and turn to him as if they'd forgot Tristram was still there.
"What do you need?"
John frowns a bit and glances at Emily, then Irene, as if checking whether anyone at all knows what he's talking about. Irene is standing at the slit in the curtains, parting them just enough with her red-painted nail to catch a glimpse outside. Tristram's heart flutters.
She pulled off with one last, long suck, and lifted herself up so she was kneeling over him on all fours. She ducked her head to kiss him, slow and deep, while she reached down to encircle his penis with one hand and rub it firmly up and down with the remnants of her saliva.
Said scourge of landladies and doctors spent much of the first two or three days reclining in bed or lounging on his couch, poring voraciously over the newspapers and circulars he sent me out to fetch twice a day. By that time, however, a nervous boredom began to set in, and I caught him more than once gazing longingly at the case containing his needles. Against my better judgment, I allowed him to smoke as many cigarettes as he wished in order to dull the craving I knew he felt for stimulation, until my own head began to spin in the thick, heavy air.
And now John slept in the same bed Sherlock had done those things in, imagined those things. Maybe he did those things too. Certainly he was masturbating there. Sherlock had incontrovertible evidence of that. He had no direct input anymore, to be sure. Sherlock's bedframe didn't squeak. And he was too far away or else the acoustics weren't right for that breathy moan to reach him out here to the living room. He had indirect evidence, though. The leftover flush on John's upper chest. The soft, dreamy look around his eyes. The wadded up tissues in the bin. (He'd managed to retrieve live samples on multiple occasions when John had to leave early for work.)
On his back beside John, Sherlock was entirely naked. He had his eyes squeezed shut and he was breathing rapidly through his nose, his lips clenched in a furl of concentration. His elbows were pointed toward the ceiling, or as near as he could get them with his wrists restrained on either side of his head. His entire body was tensed like a bow. From somewhere, a muted, low-pitched mechanical buzzing sounded.
After lunch, everyone else went back to Molly's mother's, leaving Sherlock and John somewhat at loose ends. There wasn't much in the way of sightseeing destinations in the village, and as they'd just eaten, a visit to a cafe seemed somewhat redundant.
"The photographer says he's all ready, sir," she said, keeping her eyes on his shoes.
John sighed and hugged Sherlock a bit closer. "You're probably right."
So Tristram turns onto his side too and says in a low voice, "He wasn't the one behind it all. Whoever sent him is still out there."
conversation with an esteemed colleague-" He stopped short of naming Moriarty. John's expression had fallen further, from embarrassment to guilt, possibly even dismay.
But he's pretty sure that Doctor Watson wouldn't let it go, and Tristram postulates that Emily will probably react better to Watsonian behaviour than Holmesian in this case. He dredges his memory for a parallel situation to work from. He recalls that Emily has started going to see that lady because of what happened to them on Friday Afternoon. As Tristram understands it, the lady is supposed to help her forget about it. Emily said that all she did was play with Geomag and talk to her. He doesn't have any games or toys to hand, so he tries the other option.
while they cut up toilet paper rolls to fashion the gauges for their time machine. She agrees that what he's read so far isn't any scarier than the final confrontation with Voldemort in the first book, or the part where Ginny was abducted and almost bled to death in the second book, for that matter. Tristram tells her that if her father still won't read the book with her, he'll read it and tell her what happens.
John inhaled and exhaled once, heavily. He nodded, looking down. Then his entire body stilled. Not relaxed. It was as if he'd been electrified, set on alert. His head snapped up. His eyes were keen and alive. Sherlock couldn't help his focus once again locking on to this ordinary, extraordinary man.
Sherlock fluttered his fingers dismissively. "Christmas comes round every year. But a murder, John!"
Sherlock rustled around inside, his fingers bumping John's through the paper. He took a few seconds longer than strictly necessary to choose one. It was almost like before everything had gone so spectacularly wrong. This was the third night in a row they'd gone out after rehearsals. Just as friends, maybe; or maybe ... He couldn't afford to hope. Friends was good. Friends was more than he deserved. He should settle for this, he should be happy. Only he wasn't, and he knew he never would be, now that he knew what else he might have had. A boyfriend. A partner. Someone who...
Tristram knew it wouldn't work. He opens his eyes.
"Typhoon. We lost the connection."
"The people here speak another language, Em," Doctor Watson explains to her. "Although most of them understand English too. Don't worry." He gives her a reassuring smile.
Tristram is so relieved he nearly jumps up to throw himself at his father, but instead he hugs his own knees tightly with his good arm.
Ollie rolled his eyes and gave Sherlock a look as if to say, 'You and I both know the only reason he's in.' Sherlock almost smiled in sympathy, but he did know the reason Bob was one of the wise men, and it was because John had seen something in the awkward runt of the litter. Maybe even something of himself.
"That's working, for him. He's thinking. That's mostly what his work is, thinking."
"You know where everything is."
There is now also a
"Go on, plug it in," Father tells him.
Now that seemed safe enough territory. "No, I moonlight as a dog walker," Sherlock said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
Originally, this end note started out saying, 'and that's it'. But then getoffmysheet  had a
Tristram knows he means what Tristram saw him and Father doing. He would rather forget about it entirely, but he mumbles, "Okay," so that Doctor Watson will let him go.
"Oh, well done, Sherlock. You
"A little more for me too," John said, holding his hand up. Sherlock obliged, then tossed the bottle aside and closed his eyes and wrapped his hand around himself. He'd never masturbated with a condom on before. It was slightly odd, if interesting because unfamiliar.
"Mind you don't drug us this time," Mrs Holmes said. "Your father was sick for two days last year."
) for several minutes, indecisive. If he continued to delete the messages without responding, it was likely Victor would contact Molly. If he did respond and say he wasn't interested in 'catching up', it would make the wedding awkward. Not that Sherlock cared about that kind of thing, but he didn't want to intentionally do anything that might cast a shadow on Molly's (all right, and Lestrade's) day. It would only make it more difficult to rely on them for favours later. To say nothing of the fact that John was sure to hear of it then, and that would only make him ask questions.
"Well, no," she admits, "but... the two of you were never really talkers, were you?"
The second, more compelling point it seemed to me, was that there was no murder to be solved, no mystery at all to be discovered. Holmes' sole charge was to be the convincing of Miss De Merville not to marry the erstwhile Austrian wife-killer, Baron Adelbert Gruner. I speculated that Holmes' interest might have been piqued by the circumstances of the first Baroness Gruner's death, of which her husband was certainly the cause but for which he had neatly and under suspicious circumstances side-stepped being brought to justice. Not so; that which had stumped even the combined police forces of the kingdoms of Austria and Bohemia was deemed too mundane for Holmes' attention. Instead, he intended turning his intellect to matching wits with a man whom he declared - in chilling reminiscence of his unlamented departed nemesis, Professor James Moriarty - to be in possession of a complex mind, as all great criminals are, and accepted Colonel Damery's challenge.
Sherlock was only halfway through his cigarette when he heard footsteps approaching. He flicked the still-smoking butt away and feigned being occupied with his phone.
"Oh my goodness, no, John, can you picture me with children?" Mrs Holmes said, her eyes flashing with mirth.
Sherlock gives up any pretense of fighting gravity and slides down onto the floor, his knees angled up and the side of the bathtub cold against his bare back. His penis hangs red and bedraggled out of his open trousers.
His right hand is in a cast that extends halfway up his forearm, so he has to use his left hand for everything. However, the IV is still attached to his left arm, so he has to move slowly and be careful not to get the line caught on anything. This makes him feel clumsy and awkward and cross. At least he's allowed to sit up now, although he's not supposed to lean his back against anything, not even the pillow, because of the bandages. A nurse comes to change them for him once a day and check for infection. The nurse who checked him earlier today said the cuts are healing nicely, which makes Tristram oddly proud. Although he doesn't have much control over his body's healing processes, it makes him feel like he's upholding his end of the vow his father made to him.
"Happy Christmas to you too," Sherlock says, brushing past. John follows.
"Doubtful," Sherlock mutters.
All of John's enthusiasm seemed to fall away. His fists clenched at his sides before he caught himself and forced them to open. "No."
"We're staying here?" Doctor Watson asks in a strangled voice as they walk up the driveway, which has been cleared of snow right down to the black macadam.
"All right." John sighed and picked up two jumpers from the pile. "Green or blue?"
They have to take two trains to get to the town they're staying in. Tristram dozes for a good portion of the journey on the first one, leaning his head against the cold window. It's too dark to see anything outside other than the occasional light, and much of the route takes them through tunnels anyway.
"Come in," Tris says, letting the book flop down onto the duvet.
Such was my condition, then, when Colonel Damery requested an audience that Thursday afternoon. The interview was intriguing but in the end did not seem the sort of thing that would attract Holmes' attention. In the first place, our visitor refused to name the benefactor who had sent him on his errand, and it is Holmes' sworn policy only to work for clients who divulge their full history to him. (I know now that he had deduced the identity of the bashful client by the end of Colonel Damery's first visit, although he did not reveal it to me. Consequentially, he never actually disregarded his credo.)
"You don't think so?" John asks. "You think she knew we'd be here?"
*****
His father must pick up on Tristram's discomfort - hardly surprising, that - because the lines between his eyebrows go from rigid to wrinkled, and he puts a hand on Tristram's shoulder. "Where have you-" he mutters, looking even harder at Tristram's shoes, his trousers, his jacket, sniffing near Tristram's hair, and then answers his own question: "Stable, obviously. Not hurt, yet something's upset -" He stops abruptly.
John looked so calm; Sherlock wished he were that calm, but he was a wreck. This was ridiculous, just a kiss, billions of idiots did this every day with scarcely a thought. Once and it would be over. Once was all he was going to get anyway, before he did something stupid and ruined everything, as he surely would. He leaned down and brushed his lips over John's. The flood of endorphins was nearly overwhelming - due more, however, to the relief at finally giving vent to all the emotional and physical turmoil he'd put himself through over the past few weeks than to the fleeting stimulation of his nerve endings.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock hissed.
"No, see, I trusted you, Sherlock. Obviously my first mistake. Or maybe the last in a tragic series. I trusted that
Sherlock turns to Janine with a sigh. "I'm afraid John's blog vastly overstates the level of excitement involved in a real investigation," he says, sounding both bored and condescending. "It generally doesn't involve much more than sitting around, waiting for something that's not likely to happen."
John kissed Sherlock's thigh while he moved his finger slowly in and out. Sherlock felt the sensitive muscle there contracting and releasing reflexively, sending signals forward to his balls as well. John circled there for a while at Sherlock's entrance, gently probing and stretching and slowly becoming much, much more interesting.
Sherlock felt like he'd been knocked off balance. Was that really how John saw him? But those were ludicrous examples and proved nothing. He didn't even recall smiling at Ollie. Certainly, the boy had displayed a decent grasp of the principles Sherlock had explained to him and applied them to his model; perhaps Sherlock had been satisfied that his lesson had made it through the boy's thick skull. He certainly couldn't take any responsibility for Gladstone's good-natured personality, and of course he fed and groomed the animal; he wasn't irresponsible. Paying for the tree had merely been the most expedient course to take, given how much time he'd already wasted talking to Moriarty. And John: of course he was interesting! The rest of what he'd said about himself was pure nonsense.
"I assume we don't have an invitation," John says as he follows Sherlock up the bare metal stairs. The unpainted concrete walls are lined with exposed ducts and pipes.
Holmes closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, giving up all pretense of remaining detached. He set the candle down on the small table beside the bed and twisted his body so that he could rest his elbows on either side of my head and scent me. His nose probed behind my ear, down my neck where he nudged and mouthed at the collar, and back up again, his hot breath sending shivers of need through my body. I could no longer restrain myself, and flung my arms around him, causing the hardened wax on my body to crack and fall in a rain of pellets onto the stiff cloth beneath me.
The next problem, however, soon becomes apparent. "Which do you want, the bedroom or the couch?" Emily asks Tristram.
Sherlock took a larger sip of his drink. Half the bottle gone, he should be feeling the effect soon. Maybe he shouldn't come clean after all. John was going to stay. He would have a job nearby. Things were back to a more or less comfortable level between them. Let sleeping dogs lie, one part of him said.
"Those belong to Abigail McCarthy, and she might well like to have them back."
Doctor Watson's eyebrows jump up. "Oh! I've already called in. They weren't happy, but it's not my third strike, so... But if you don't mind..." He sits forward on the chair, about to stand up.
"A moment of insanity, perhaps. But it will serve a purpose."
I murmured his name over and over, burrowing my nose into his hair and neck where I greedily sucked up the fragrant aroma of his musk. It was pure alpha, thick and dark, yet I marveled at how good and right he smelled, how perfectly suited his lean, alpha body was for my arms, how beautiful he was covered in sweat, half undressed, his hair falling into his eyes as he fairly rutted on top of me.
"Yeah, I would," John answers honestly. "Tris too. But that's not something to base living arrangements on. There are lots of other factors. It's one thing to have fun with sleepovers and playing games, but actually living together is different. Think about when we moved in with Harry and Clara. It's a lot different having to share a bathroom with someone than just getting together on Christmas and birthdays."
"And you can do all of that from here?" John asks, scepticism mixing with genuine admiration at the extent of Sherlock's skills.
"I intend to," Sherlock assured him, covering his mouth again and teasing his tongue inside in imitation of the act.
"Obviously," Sherlock drawls.
"Yes, Mr Holmes," both boys mumbled.
"I'd have paid for you to take a taxi, of course," Sherlock tells him.
Sherlock glances at him sideways, his opinion betrayed only by a small crinkling around his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not lying," Sherlock said, irritated both at John for thinking he was and at himself for making it an easy supposition to make.
"Have you solved it?" John asked, careful to keep his tone casual. "The old case?" Or the new one, he rather thought. The case of what John meant to him, what he meant to John. What place they had in each other's lives.
John was watching a nurse adjust a soft, knitted hat that had slipped down over the face of a baby with pale brown skin. "You know what I mean." His lips twitched down and he looked away. "Sorry. I wasn't going to- Sorry," he muttered.
"Merry Christmas."
"Here and there. I've been at the Baker Street School just gone five years now." Which Moriarty obviously knew. He was baiting Sherlock, but Sherlock had found the best way to deal with Moriarty was to let him monologue and not disagree with him, if at all possible. Eventually, he'd have stimulated his own ego enough and would wander off.
"Come here," John says. He nudges at Sherlock until he lowers himself to rest his bare torso against John's still clothed one. John tucks him in close, and Sherlock slides his arms under John's shoulders and nuzzles into the side of his head.
Sherlock stops at the bottom of the stairs and wheels around to loom over John, who skids to a halt next to him. "I know this is a difficult concept for you," he snaps, "but I
33% correct. No chip. Although to be fair, Halton had been amongst the choices.
Tristram looks up from the table, where he's practising left-handed writing in one of the notebooks he brought along. He can almost get his name to look the way it does when he writes it with his right hand. Well, used to write it. The tilt is still a little off though.
Doctor Watson looks unhappy. Not sad-unhappy. More like when you know you need to have an injection and you really don't want to but you know there's no way round it. That kind of unhappy. "Are you sure, Sherlock?" he asks from where he's still sitting on the couch.
"All right?" John asks. His expression is somewhere between amused and self-conscious.
Tristram's eyes go round. An actual curse! Like in the Harry Potter stories!
&&&&&&
"Yeah, um..." John clears his throat and rubs the back of his neck. "We'll see."
His hands were steady as he poured, setting John's glass on the counter near the cooker for him. That was something at least. John started talking about his day, his prospects for his next job when this one finished next week, and Sherlock started to relax. The music coming from the living room was mellow, instrumentals only, no singer to force meaning onto the winding harmonies and aching dissonances. The food smelled good, and Sherlock became aware that he was hungry. He hadn't eaten since breakfast (he'd gotten up early to have tea and toast with John before he left for work), aside from a chocolate bar he'd found in the bottom of a strong box in the bolt hole where he'd spent the afternoon.
"A movie about poison?" Sherlock was mildly hopeful. The other movies John had referenced hadn't sounded very interesting.
"Yes," Sherlock agrees with a hint of defiance.
"Can you ask your dad to read to us?" she asks, holding the book out to him.
John was rocking his hips back and forth by now, both hands on Sherlock's head, half cradling and half guiding. He was puffing like a steam engine and starting to make sounds that came from somewhere deep in his chest. Maybe even from his heart. Things were dangerously close to ending the way they had the last time, though, and damnit, the whole point tonight was to show Sherlock that John reciprocated his feelings, every last one, not to get his rocks off and then have Sherlock slink off, used and unsatisfied.
By the end of the rehearsal, no less than three shoving matches had broken out, one girl had lost a shoe and was in tears, and another girl's mother had to be rung to pick her up early because she had stomach-ache. Everyone was exhausted and at the end of their nerves. And Sherlock hadn't exchanged more than a couple of words with John, and those had been brief and strictly related to the play. Truly, a spectacular failure as his bright ideas went.
As they approach the glass-walled area, Tristram sees that people are lining up and showing their passports. Originally, Uncle Mycroft gave them all fake passports because they were supposed to be going into hiding from the people who were sending the fingers and teeth and bits of skin. The man who shot Tristram has been arrested, though, and this is just a holiday, so they're using their real names and their real passports. At least Father said this was a holiday, but he hasn't relaxed the way he usually does when a case is over, so Tristram really isn't sure. Maybe he's tense because of Doctor Watson. Because of the kissing. Maybe that's all there is to it.
"Tris?"
John didn't try to kiss Sherlock at school next morning, but Sherlock still felt like he had a sign over his head that read 'I snogged John Watson last night, and I liked it'. He was probably unnecessarily stern and short in an attempt to compensate. Not that anyone noticed a difference.
"I'll read," he says as he crawls onto his bed. It's not worth going downstairs to ask, as he knows what the answer will be. He's not resentful, it's simply not something his father does. Just like Doctor Watson doesn't help them take blood samples and smear their nasal discharge on microscope slides.
John waits several more seconds then says in a low, urgent voice, "Sherlock, we've been here five days. My emergency leave is up in two, and then I really may have to go looking for another job. We've had the kids out of school for almost three weeks. I can't-" He presses his lips together and looks down and away before returning his eyes to Sherlock. "I need to know what's going on." His expression is almost pleading, even though Sherlock can't see it.
"Are you hurt?"
"There's nothing I can do for him, and anyway it'd be over by the time I got back," John says stubbornly.
Sherlock glowered mutinously.
"Well, he's never dated anyone, in all the time I've known him."
, although Ollie could make his armpit squeak, Saffron could turn her eyelids inside-out, and Jade could hold her breath for a minute and a half. In terms of actual, useful skills, there were six children who could dance without looking like they had worms in their pants and nine who could both carry a tune and sing loud enough to be heard past the front row. Although whether one would want to hear full-throated yelling about a 'teenage dirtbag' was another question. Sherlock would have made the boy stop, if the display hadn't reduced John to ducking under the table to hide his laughter. No matter. It was going to be a disaster regardless of what they did, but at least they would have something to work with.
Father smiles back, a small one, but his eyes crinkle, and Tristram's heart swells. Then he goes back upstairs to Emily and Doctor Watson.
While John clicked through screens, Lestrade turned to Molly, who had been watching the exchange wide-eyed, wringing her hands. "Did you know about this?" he asked.
"It's a very small country," Sherlock points out. Without detaching his lips from John, he leans back and gropes around for the faucet to the large, round bathtub.
Just when the omega seemed on the verge of completion, the alpha abruptly withdrew and straightened. "One more," he said, his voice betraying how far gone he was himself despite the authoritative tone. "Just one more, darling. I know you can do it."
Sherlock draws closer and points, his arm reaching through the bars that are keeping them safe. "That one, with what looks like a diagonal line running up its side."
"No, apparently not." Sherlock pulls on a fresh pair of pants as well.
Sherlock yanks the phone away from John and pushes the mute button.
** Chapter note: The Englischer Hof was the hotel that Holmes and Watson stayed at in "The Final Problem". It was made up by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but was based on the real "Parkhotel du Sauvage" in Meiringen, so I've done the same thing, basing my descriptions on actual pictures of the hotel, its lobby and rooms from
They bypass Uncle Mycroft's car and get into another one that's always parked there when Tristram comes, but that he's never seen anyone use. It's also black, but smaller and lower to the ground.
"Here." Father has miraculously - or not, given the assortment of oddities he tends to carry around with him - produced a felt-tip pen and is holding it under Tristram's nose.
John folded back one corner of the skin, holding his breath in case it turned out to have a foul smell and ready to spring back if it were alive and aggressive (he had had a bad experience with a crab once). It was neither. Lying on the pale leather was a knife. Formed of a single piece of black rock, it glinted and sparkled in the low light of the fire. The handle was smooth and rounded, and the blade had been painstakingly honed to a hair's-breadth edge. It obviously represented the work of several weeks. John ran a callused finger along the surface. It was warm and slippery, as if it had been oiled, yet his finger came away dry.
Oh yeah. There's no mistaking the suggestiveness in her tone this time, and John's anger—untethered from its initial target by his pathological need to present a united front in Janine's presence—redirects itself at her.
Sherlock frowns. "You're in perfectly good condition. And there are two of us."
Mr Holmes was silent for a good long while. John let him.
"You mean a quick one, like when you have to say hi to your gran, or with their arms round each other and really long like in the movies?"
John leaned back against the table next to him and crossed his arms. "It's all cleared with Greg and the hospital. We're taking the bus and going to visit the maternity unit."
Sherlock couldn't let him get away with insubordination, but he wasn't really angry. He had planned on having the children create decorations for the classroom and the school Christmas tree anyway, which Lestrade was forcing him to pick up later that day.
Sherlock maintained his rightous indignation at John's presumption throughout the rest of the evening and well into Saturday. On Saturday afternoon, when he saw someone in the park who resembled John from a distance, his resolve wavered. Not that he changed his mind about the basic point: John had no right judging how Sherlock conducted his business, or why, or with whom. But, strangely, Sherlock found that didn't entirely prevent him from wanting to conduct his business with John. It was an unfamiliar situation: he was angry at John for having tried to get inside his head - no, if he was honest, for
They ended up sharing two dances, and by the time Sherlock returned her to her husband, John was back at his otherwise empty table with yet another drink in front of him.
Watson looked incredulous, one half of his mouth quirked up as if he wasn't certain whether he was meant to laugh or not. "Right, that's... Did someone give you access to my file? I wasn't aware I'd included any of that in my application-"
When the movie's over, they put their pyjamas on and John sits on the bed with one arm around each of them and reads three chapters of the
John wraps one arm around her and pulls her along with him toward Tristram, who looks around him at the empty space behind John. What's going on? Where's Father?
"Did you two sleep well?" Doctor Watson asks.
John stares up at him, his eyes wide. There is silence for the space of several seconds. Finally, John whispers, "I'm sorry."
"It's obvious," Sherlock said to Stamford, because, truth be told, he enjoyed this part, and he certainly wasn't going to let Stamford off for dragging him into this. "First, you alerted me to the fact that you specifically received some news, so something personal. Further, it must be something you consider good news, judging by the fact that your face has been frozen in that ridiculous rictus since I entered the room. Most likely one of the big three: money, career, or family.
The guard waves them through after flicking an eye at the maroon booklets in Father's and Doctor Watson's hands, and Doctor Watson suggests that he go exchange some money while Father sorts their train tickets. It turns out they still have a two-and-a-half hour train ride ahead of them before they get to their final destination. However, Father insists that they all stay together. Tristram is glad about that, even if it means he has to drag his suitcase halfway across the terminal until they find a bank, and then all the way back and down several escalators, following the signs toward 'Bahn/Rail'.
A delicious, shivery prickle bloomed out from Sherlock's abdomen. His mouth went dry and it felt like his heart was in his throat. He realised that he
"I'm afraid we're just going to have to deal with her."
He's not on the sofa in the green parlour anymore, but one of the French doors is propped open, and Tristram can smell cigarette smoke.
Tristram can't help with that, but he thinks he should do something to make her feel better, because that's what friends do. If Doctor Watson were here, he'd give her a hug, but Tristram doesn't feel comfortable doing that. Instead, he puts a hand on her knee, because that's what his father does when Tristram needs reassurance (either that or his shoulder, but Tristram can't reach Emily's shoulder as easily from where he's sitting). He wonders if this is how his father feels when Tristram needs to be comforted. Maybe it explains why he doesn't hug and cuddle him more, the way Doctor Watson does with Emily.
"Fine."
"Can I change the third one?" Emily asks. "I don't need both Aunt Clara and Aunt Harry."
John pressed his lips together, thought about it. "This is against my better judgment, you know that," he said finally.
" -he spits the word out from between gritted teeth- "about ten minutes later telling me to meet him here." He lifts his phone, which he is still holding in his hand. "And of course he refuses to
did you know about Harry?"
"Let's not overreach."
"This okay?" John asked, feeling nervous and awkward and excited and so, so happy, even though he knew they were just going to sleep. That was all. But Sherlock was here, he'd agreed to sleep next to him, or at least to share a bed for a while. It was more than John deserved.
Doctor Watson straightens up and grins. "Properly," he states, pointing at Father. Tristram's not sure what that's supposed to mean. A proper kiss perhaps? It seemed like a proper enough one to Tristram. More than enough.
Anyway, his mother made a face that looked like she wasn't sure whether to be insulted or amused - Uncle Mycroft's assistant is good at those faces too - and said, 'Oh darling, that makes me sound like I should be wearing a bouclé suit and hosting five o'clock tea. Call me Irene.'
Sherlock flushed inwardly at the memory of just why John didn't go home last night.
And then he started to move. Slowly, gently, he flexed his thighs and hips, while John's hands curved around his buttocks to help support and guide him. The first few passes mostly served to lubricate the inside of Sherlock's passage better and let it adjust to the intrusion. Once the slide was smooth, though, and Sherlock was registering reports of pleasure mixed in with the occasional ache from his overtaxed nerve endings, he tried out different angles until one particularly fruitful jab had him jerking upward quickly, then shimmying back down and around in an attempt to replicate it.
"You're late," she complains.
The sun had already risen when he left my bed, the maid clattering with the coal-hob downstairs. We were reckless. Our landlady remained blissfully deaf and blind, a malady she foresightedly passed on to the servants. The scene repeated itself nightly. He called me darling and lavished me with overgenerous attentions. I called him dearest and let myself be consumed. We fell into old habits. Those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them. I had learned. Yet I was helpless to escape the snares of my own devising, the lures of my peculiar manners of thought and action.
John squeezed Sherlock's shoulder, wishing he could do the same to his entire body. "Yeah, it's nice," he said, hoping his voice didn't come out too shaky. Holy hell. He couldn't-- Sherlock couldn't know what this was doing to him. He didn't mean it like that. True, most people would say the situation was rather clear-cut. Unambiguous. Perhaps it was, in the sense that it was an affirmation and acknowledgment of what they meant to each other, the exclusive nature of their connection, that no one else could fill that space at their side and in their heart. No matter whether this was as close as they ever physically got.
r u fucking following me? stop it. i mean it. turning phone off
Sherlock was willing to take the fall himself, to accept responsibility for the charges of fraud which were certain to follow, but he didn't yet see a way to keep John out of it completely. The man would be stupid enough to confess his role in the entire debacle. And - a truth that Sherlock found more difficult to admit - he didn't want Lestrade to get dragged into yet another one of Sherlock's messes. Sherlock wasn't blind to how much Lestrade had done for him over the years, starting with hiring him in the first place and carrying on through defending him at every turn, both to the board and the other teachers. Sherlock didn't like to be indebted to anyone, and he was well aware that he owed Lestrade more than his fair share already.
This is set between chapters 22 and 23 of the main story, and is based on a prompt from JPerceval, who wanted to see Mycroft inviting Sherlock and John to Christmas dinner.
"When Tris comes back... are we going to live here too?"
Sender: John
John appeared in the doorway of the classroom a couple of minutes after morning classes ended.
If Tristram were logical, like Father - and Doctor Watson - he wouldn't have got scared and pushed Emily.
John held up his hands in surrender. "No, clearly I don't know anything. This whole thing is-" He shook his head. "Sorry. I'm sorry, all right? I'll see you on Monday." He turned and disappeared into the crowd.
"They're still there," I reminded him, looking toward the door leading out to the sitting room and not caring how desperate or wanton I appeared.
Tristram's happy to see Doctor Watson too, but he feels funny about saying that, so he just says, "Thank you."
"What did they say about me?" Sherlock bristled a little, but mostly he was curious. It was a novelty to imagine other people saying things about him that didn't involve the words 'freak', 'shame', or some threat of litigation.
John's glares at Irene, his nostrils flaring. "I tried to. Seems some people had other plans. You and him," John all but spits out at her. "Did you plan all this together? Hm?" His mouth twists in an ugly way. "Let me think I was going to be able to help just to play me for a stooge? Why even bother? Why not just tell me from the beginning?" He jabs a finger towards Emily, who's watching the exchange as wide-eyed as Tristram is. "I wanted to take Emily home yesterday when I found out about all this, but he stopped me. Asked me to stay one more day, to go with him today. Why? If you were just going to call me to heel."
"It's not a party trick," he said, but looked at Stamford anyway. He was grinning from ear to ear; not an unusual look for him, granted, but there was an extra shininess to his cheeks this morning. It took Sherlock all of five seconds to arrive at his conclusion: "Your wife's pregnant."
Gladstone heard the noise before he did. The dog shifted and sat up, and then Sherlock heard it too. In the hall: footsteps. John. Going to the toilet? No: a soft tap on his door. His heart sank; John must have changed his mind, decided he would go home after all but wanted to be polite and let Sherlock know.
"No, in fact I'm not," she says, yanking viciously at the gloves. "I'm going to put an end to this entire thing, once and for all. Kate?" she calls.
John faced him and stood at parade rest, but his eyes were dancing with laughter. Sherlock had the oddest longing to do something that would encourage the laughter to bubble over into sound.
"But everyone also speaks English," Emily points out with a furrow of confusion on her forehead. "Why don't they get rid of German and French and everything else? They don't need it."
"The fact that our mother is even still alive isn't exactly common knowledge. And this estate has no connection to either myself or Mycroft."
Dear father Christmas, please make my teacher happy because he seems really sad. He does'nt even like Christmas so please help him find his smile. Love, Isabelle.
I realised the answer a moment later, and reproached myself for having been so distracted not to notice at once: at the foot of her grave were three small, square stones laid flush with the earth. They bore no names, merely singular dates, each one year apart, starting the year of my departure and the last coinciding with their mother's death. There had been no nursery or photographs of an infant in their house. Watson might have burnt it all, of course, but that would be unlike him, who still carried his brother's watch and polished the buttons on his battered old uniform once a year. Stillbirths then. Was this why he had insisted I come here? To twist the knife even further? To lay out before me in no uncertain terms what I could not give him? And yet Mary Watson had fared no better in that regard. And there she lay, and here I stood.

Fourth line:
"There's no such thing as curses," Emily states, like she's made a grand study of the subject. "But I guess we could look at it," she acquiesces as if she's doing Irene a big favour.
The railway platforms themselves are one more level down. It's dark and drafty. It reminds Tristram of the Underground in London, in a way, only bigger and less friendly, somehow. Tristram likes riding the Underground. It always feels like an adventure. This is an adventure too, but there's too much uncertainty, in too many ways, for Tristram to really enjoy it.
John hadn't needed to deflower Mary. Their wedding night had been far from their first time.
What choice does he have? John's turned down — politely, to be sure, but firmly — every invitation to help Sherlock on a case. Admittedly, there haven't been any particularly interesting ones coming in on the website, and Lestrade hasn't invited him to consult on anything lately. What else is Sherlock supposed to do? Ask John to meet up for a pint? And so he follows him. To and from work, the shops, the pub... the cemetery.
And then around on the inside of his arm - because Father's and Emily's messages already took up so much room on the front side - is what Doctor Watson wrote:
He never made it to the lounge.
"Well," Watson said gruffly into his mustache, scuffing self-consciously at the grit under his boots. I became aware that we had been standing in silence for upwards of a minute. "That's enough of that, I should think. Shall we?" He leaned away as if to uncouple himself but I was not ready to yield. I would never be ready to yield.
Sherlock isn't sure why John is sharing these pictures and this story with him. It's obviously painful for him to do so. The file was underneath several days' worth of newspapers. John clearly doesn't take it out very often. Sherlock imagines he's supposed to say something at this point, but he can't think of anything. He remembers what Mary said, that he and John were never really talkers. Maybe he doesn't need to say anything. If it were him, it would certainly be enough for John just to be there with him. Maybe it's enough for John, too.
"Father!" His voice comes out higher and more panicked-sounding than he would perhaps have liked. "Father!" he tries again, even shriller, when there is no response to his first cry.
Sarah groped John's crotch, finding a thick, yet still soft handful there. "You named your dick after your flatmate?" she said, wrinkling her nose and barely able to stop from collapsing into helpless laughter.
"Do you imagine I make up these rules for my own benefit?" Father continues. His eyes are big and angry.
John darts his tongue out over his bottom lip and appears to consider. "Yeah. I guess I didn't- That wasn't how I pictured it. It was always me, coming to Baker Street with her. I'd sit in that old armchair, you know, the one in front of the fireplace."
Together, they headed for the chapel.
Sherlock dropped the curtain and smirked at John. "If you'd rather sleep with him when he arrives tomorrow, by all means."
Message: On my way home now. You back?
John hesitated. "Molly, and Mike... Mrs Hudson..."
Father hums an affirmative response.
He gets dressed in the extra set of clothes, then steps quietly out into the hall. The house is silent, as if everyone else is still sleeping. Grandmother at least is no lie-a-bed, though, so she's probably downstairs or out in the gardens or in her studio. He wonders where Emily is, if not in Tristram's room.
