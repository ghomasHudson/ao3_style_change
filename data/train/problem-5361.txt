They arrange for Dean to pick Cass up around seven and take them to a drive-in movie theatre. It's kind of far but it's the last in the state and Cass has always wanted to go.
but I’m
“My name is Dean and I’m an alcoholic.”
They came together, a beautiful blend of “I love you”s and “So good for me”s and “My everything”s.
“Dean, I sincerely have no idea what you’re talking about. You know I don’t read social cues very well. I didn’t know he was flirting with me but I do know for a fact that I was not flirting back.”
Dean wraps his arms around the small boy and ruffles his hair. Jack giggles into his chest and
Dean is, in fact, attracted to men too.
“No, you won’t.” Jack stated coldly. “They are my creations and under my protection.”
“Yeah, but how-“ Dean didn’t get to finish his sentence. One moment he stood talking to Jack, the next he opened his eyes looking up at the ceiling. He took in a desperate breath, filling his lungs in what felt like the first time in forever. His muscles felt odd, sore, unused.
“This is a fairly high-ranking Demon. But nothing you haven’t faced before. I will keep it away from anyone but the Angels in the room. Are you ready?” Jack asked. He also motioned for the humans in the room to back up and stay behind him.
Castiel had felt a mixture of sadness and excitement when he felt Dean’s soul enter the realm. His hunter was here, was safe, and he could see him again. He hoped that New Heaven would please him. It was, after all, free will and family that had been the inspiration for the changes that they had made. The things that Dean had fought for for all of his life.
At that, Dean got up from the log. He left his anger behind. One of the many things he had taught himself since Cas died. He stood calmly, looking down at his father. He was about to wait for him to say something. Wait for an accept of what he had just said. But he didn’t need that anymore. Instead, he just stated; “Next time they come by, I hope you’ll join us. We could use your help.”
In that short time, Sam had gifted him a nephew. Named after him. He had masked the overwhelming honour he felt with a; “Really? That’ll be pretty confusion at the family dinners, don’t you think?”
“These people are already dead. Heaven has claimed their souls. You cannot take them.” The corner of Jack’s mouth lifted in a small smile, even though he tried to keep calm and neutral.
“Do you have to be anywhere tonight?” Dean asked before pulling back to look at Cas.
“-Dean, I’m sorry, we shouldn’t have told you-“
The Empty Reaper turned to look at the Angel. Dean immediately read the change in the shadow figure’s body language. “Cas! Look out!”
People started gathering around the table. Dean once again held back Cas, giving the Angel a pointed look. “We’ll talk about this later, okay?”
When Castiel still looked unsure, Dean gave him a sweet, reassuring kiss. Still, it couldn’t quite quench the Angel’s nervousness. “Well, I guess Jack will know now as well.”
Dean couldn’t help a nervous laugh. “Just a figure of speech, Cas.”
Chapter 3:
“Oh, that would be great. They are always welcome.” Mary smiled.
Dean turned around to locate his brother before realising that it was all in his head. “
“Oh, shut up.” Dean grunted. It didn’t hurt, but it felt a little invasive and he imagined that he could still hear an echo of the words in his mind. “Does it feel like that all the time?”
Sam soon strode into the dining room, smiling and a bounce in his step. “Look what the cat dragged in!”
At that moment, everyone around the table seemed to erupt, as if their reactions had been delayed and finally caught up to them.
Dean had expected something grand, like Death’s library, but this was so much bigger. He couldn’t even see the top of the bookcases. The ceiling looked like a starry night and all furniture was kept in dark wood. Yet, the room was bright from an unseen light source.
“Neat.” Dean answered without any enthusiasm. It was eery that the place was so clean. “So, what now?”
“I should have died back then.” Dean stated matter-of-factly. Castiel whipped his head up, about to disagree, but Dean continued. “It was the first time I was given a death sentence. I mean, I had close calls before that. It’s just part of the job. But this time, they told me that I was actually gonna die. Or at least I should have until Sam heard about an actually functioning faith healer. He pretty much carried my ass to one of the sessions, and I couldn’t keep my mouth shut because it all seemed so stupid, you know? But Roy picked me and healed me. On my first day there. Other people had waited for weeks. People who deserved it so much more than me. I was just running my stupid mouth…” Dean cleared his throat and licked his lips before continuing. “There was this girl with a brain tumour. I don’t even know if she made it, found another cure or something. We stopped the preacher’s wife before she was healed. I almost didn’t do it, but… Someone else was going to die if we didn’t stop the healing. This girl actually believed in God, in Chuck. She believed so much. And he just screwed her over like that. Just to mess with us.”
“What? Is something wrong with his father?”
Dean felt a tear sliding down his face. He wiped his face.
Dean was biting his lip.
Sam’s POV:
John rested a trembling hand on his son’s shoulder. “Your mother was very sick... and if you get too sick, you have to go to the hospital, Remember?”
“This one is it, I can feel it!”
Castiel tilted his head sideways. “You have a brother?”
Castiel’s POV:
Dean chuckled. “It depends on the customer. There was one lady last night, Karen. She is usually just annoying, but last night was awful. She was so drunk that she started stripping...”
“As exited as I could be.”
Sam rolled his eyes, taking a deep breath. “Dean—it’s Jack—he’s come back with.....”
The flight attendant spoke over the intercom.
Dean had never talked about Mary or John before. To anyone. If anything, he was the person who shut down those conversations.
It took about a moment for Dean to realize how close they were. Dean could feel every movement Castiel made. The man’s breathing caused his back to press farther into him.
Castiel could feel his face burning. “Can we move on from this topic?”
Both Winchesters grumbled.
“Dean.”
Dean sighed. “Oh... huh”
Dean did a slow turn. “Okay, now how do I look?”
“Is that really an appropriate question to ask?”
Gabriel handed his phone over. Castiel stood, walking over to the other end of bar.
“Better?”
Sam cringed, watching as his brother plummeted down the bunker stairs.
Castiel rested his head on the table with defeat, closing his eyes. “How did you learn how to do this?”
Dean rolled his eyes, stumbling out of the bathroom and over to his hiking boots. “There’s no time. I’m sure you look great. ”
He could hear footsteps from behind him. “How do I look? I want to look good for Sammy on his last day of freedom!”
“Where will I go when I die?”
Castiel took the two books off of the shelves. “If I get nightmares, I will kill you”
They walked down the street. Once in a while they would be approached by a bloodthirsty fan girl/boy.
This question repeated for a year, up until Dean got on one knee and asked if Cas could stay indefinitely... he asked his angel to marry him.
“Sorry, brother.”
~~~~~Dream wooo~~~~~~
He found himself smiling back. “Did your students do well?”
“I didnt know that you read that much, Cas”
“What are doing today, Dean?”
She scowled up at him. “You asshole! You didn’t respond to any of my calls! Are you going to invite me in, or will I have to break in myself?”
They went out and got pizza. He had four slices, warranting a very worried expression from Castiel.
“YES!”
After another ten minutes of talking. Gabriel kept catching Castiel glancing over at Dean, who busied himself by doing laps in the pool.
Castiel took a sip of his drink. “The coffee’s good.”
Sam and Gabriel came in to work soon after. Gabriel started dancing recklessly to the song, bumping into various tables and chairs along the way. the moose just scowled.
And yes, Cain’s lover, did in fact, die.
“Fine, fine! I’ll tell you”
Castiel nodded. “I am rather famished.”
Dean nodded in affirmation.
He nodded, shifting his weight. “Heya, Sunshine.” He ignored the ‘awes’ from the eavesdropping students. “Gabriel told me that you weren’t able to get coffee today. I was passing through here on the way to work, so I thought that I would get you—ugh, just take the coffee.”
Dean sighed. “I was really frustrated at first. I was used to reading with my eyes, so needing to change an entirely new system... It took longer for me to get than most students in my class.”
He nodded, going to the back of the restaurant. He began to make the man’s food. Despite not being able to see, Dean had learned how to cook as well as he previously did. As long as everything in the kitchen was in the correct place and order, things went well.
After landing, the two claimed their baggage and took a taxi back to the apartment complex. The model had to stop himself from following Dean up to his apartment. He was tempted to ask his friend if he could come in.
Dean smirked, filling the mug in his hand with beer.
“So, when are you going to tell him then?”
“That must suck.”
The bartender shook his head, voice trembling. “No... I can’t. I— No way am I getting on. It would be a death sentence!”
Castiel sighed, taking another sip of his beer. They were so close.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cain’s wife dies!”
Sam’s face flushed, and he looked down at the floor. Dean grinned, elbowing the moose. “Can we get an espresso for my ‘hot’ brother, then?”
The shorter man chuckled, smirking up at Sam. He then smiled in Castiel’s direction, eyes bright.
There was a quiet knock at his door. Dean thought that he had been imagining it, but he was proven wrong when hearing it again.
Castiel heard a muffled shout from the back. “Tacos!”
Out of all days, this fucker had to choose TODAY to sit here?!?
He felt a firm hand clasped his back, causing him to jump.
Cas gasped, His eyes blown wide. He repeated Dean’s words, as if trying to translate it. “You want to get a drink with me.”
But it felt wrong. He felt as if he should have ‘woken up’ with Dean. Maybe he could have gotten ready and helped him with Sam.
Castiel huffed. “Yeah. I was really upset, and I had no idea how to... cope. So that’s why you found me in that bar last night”
“When will he be back???”
Hoodie? Check.
Castiel felt a goofy grin slide onto his face. “Tea?”
“Okay, now part your lips slightly. PERFECT”
Gabriel dropped his towel on a beach chair and stuck his feet in the pool.
Dean frowned. “Who’s that?”
The model moved his index finger and thumb to the bridge of his nose.
Dean scoffed. “Am I wrong?”
Dean, unlike so many people Castiel knew, didn't want anything from him. He just liked being around the model because of who he was...
Dean prepared himself, stepping behind Castiel and moving his hand to the left shoulder.
A goofy grin slides onto Dean’s face. “Since always. I always loved him, but didn’t know it ‘till we were stuck in purgatory together.”
The bartender was still for another ten seconds, forehead pressed into Castiel’s shoulder.
Dean shrugged, a frown tugging at the corners of his lips. “Well, I have nothing to offer him. I have only enough money to get myself by, I am terrified of leaving the city, and I cant even see him.”
He was in his restaurant, wishing that he was back home. The place was surprisingly packed for lunch time, almost all of the booths being taken. It was as if the customers were waiting for something. Dean sighed, listening to Karen talking to her friend.
Dean’s eyes softened for a split second, but it was almost immediately replaced by anger.
It had been a rough few days. Dean almost immediately regretted what he said to Cas.
Castiel nodded. “It helps that I know the language... not fluently, though.”
Suit? Check.
“Woah... this jacket is really nice! Where’d you snag it?”
Sam’s POV:
And he felt like throwing up by the time he woke. It was around six in the morning, and there was a frantic knock on the door.
If only.
After John had... caused Dean’s accident, he lost custody of his children. Sam and Dean now lived with Bobby. Sam went to a normal school, and had a relatively uninteresting childhood. But Dean went to Bobby’s school for the blind. He hated it at first, but he eventually accepted it as a part of his life.
“I will bring my Reapers!” The Empty hissed.
“A moment ago, you couldn’t.” Sam was clenching and unclenching his jaw in that nervous habit of his.
When Castiel could no longer hold back, no matter how long we wished this could last, he grabbed Dean’s shoulder. Despite the scar no longer being there, it sent a bolt of electricity through both of them. That spot, where Castiel had first touch Dean, had touched him many times after and had last touched him when alive. It was so casual, and yet so significant that it brought both of them over the edge.
Behind the Gate, something was slamming hard against the door, sending quakes through it, making the sensation-ground underneath them rumble.
“Well…” Dean coughed. “Sounds like we really only have one option here. And it’s not like it would be our first leap of faith. At least this time, I know I believe in the God pulling the strings.”
.” Castiel added forcefully, ignoring Dean. “Since we would not be bringing Michael back, we would need a new driving force for the grace. Someone strong enough to wield the power of not just any Archangel, but the grace of Michael.”
Jack happily started relaying about the changes they had made, most of which they were already aware of through personal experience. He told them about creating new Angels, both from human souls and from scratch, how it was a complex process, but very fulfilling. He told them about a new, promising cooperation with Hell with Rowena as its queen. The witch drove a hard bargain but was not unfair and understood that a good relation with Heaven good secure her a long reign.
“..En.. Yo- eed… oment to se-ld.” What the hell kind of scrambled radio was that?
“’Night, Cas.”
Dean had lost track of time. It felt like he was floating. Everything was quiet. Unnaturally quiet. Only the sound of slightly quickened breathing and pounding hearts. Like the room had been cut off from the rest of the house. From the rest of Heaven. It was just the two of them. If Cas told him that this room made up the entire universe, he would believe him.
house. But instead of living on their old street, they lived out here among ever-stretching hills and trees, close to Bobby, Rufus, Jo, and Ellen and all the other hunters that they had crossed paths with and befriended in their lifetime.
A sudden thought popped into Dean’s head, and he couldn’t hold back a huffed laughter.
A hand grabbed his shoulder, and he turned, ready to defend himself, but instead of black nothingness, he was met with blue eyes. “Cas…”
Before Dean could shake it off, the Empty Reaper attacked again, this time sending a black, solid, thin spear at him. Dean ducked just in time, but the spear still grazed his side. And sonofabitch that hurt.  He growled in pain and grabbed his side, feeling warm liquid covering his hand.
Of course, his family accepted his choice. Some more reluctantly than others. Specifically, his father had to take a long walk before clapping Dean’s shoulder and smiling. “Whatever makes you happy, son.”
“Protecting me—I—what?!? Cas, how could you talk like your life doesn’t matter?!?”
Dean nodded sympathetically. For the second time in the past couple days, he wondered what his rival’s job was.
Then the customer commented on their relationship, mistaking them for a couple.
So he scrolled through social media.
“Thanks, Cas. This is really sweet of you”
Castiel smiled at the thought of Dean telling him jokes while he worked, ruining the takes that the photographers had been trying so hard to get.
Ughhhhhhhhhhh
SHIT!
Dean left his jacket for him. This meant nothing, right? Dean was just being friendly...
“Uh—I got to go... but can I stop by your apartment sometime? Maybe we can get to know each other, since we’re neighbors”
Dean continued. “The world has not treated me badly. I have gotten to meet people I wouldn’t have if I didn't go blind. If I still had my sight, I would probably still be in Kansas.... I would not have met you.”
Why in Chuck’s name would Castiel want to leave Dean behind? To get judged in some stupid competition he won’t even win?!? Funny story!
Gabriel threw a wet dish towel at Sam’s face.
Dean frowned. There was a model in town?
His brother chocked, face reddening. “Why the hell would I do that???”
Castiel’s eyes darted across the tan canvas, hitching a breath.
After an hour, they arrived at their gate. Gabriel spotted a group of people and shouted.
Sam chocked, and a smirk formed on his face. “Hey, that flannel looks really familiar!”
Castiel paused halfway through his sentence. “—Dean. The sun is rising.”
“You’ll find my number on the bottom of the cup, gorgeous.”
The bar door swung open, causing multiple heads to turn.
Hey, everyone! I am SO exited about sharing this update with you! Yes, this extra long chapter is all complete with ridiculous pining, tooth-rotting fluff, and our idiots being... well, idiots!
Castiel’s POV:
“Really?... I—uh—thanks, Cas”
Dean’s voice sounded.... shaky? “Are you exited to leave?”
At first it was amusing. Dean enjoyed hearing more about what Cas looked like.
He shook his head. At this point Gabriel had shushed his current customer, leaning over the counter to hear what he had to say. Dean coughed uncomfortably, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’ll let you win, but on one condition...”
The boys stared in shock at the model’s hand for a moment before shaking it. “The name’s Kevin.”
‘Don't take it to heart’, Dean chided himself, ‘Castiel is just being neighborly’
Castiel looked about as shocked as Sam felt. The angel's eyes were wide, mouth slightly a jar.
“I promise.”
He walked over to Jo, his back straight and his face expression set. He offered her his hand, a sly smile on his face.
“Cas... look. I can’t do this anymore. I want to believe that you’ll come back... that somehow you’re able to hear me. But what if I’m just fooling myself? What if I-I’m going crazy?”
Dean fiddled with his hands, exhaling loudly. “So, Cas... now what?”
How long was he asleep?
He turned away the second Dean peeled off his shirt. He only caught a glimpse of tan skin in the reflection.
Cas shook his hand, nodding. A relieved smile replaced his concerned expression. “It’s nice to meet you. You have an... interesting brother.”
Obviously, that would be too fast. Dean knew he would have to prove himself worthy first. He needed to be the man the model deserved.
Castiel made sure to not look behind him as he finished getting dressed. He didn't want to catch Dean with his pants down, quite literally.
“Go to your room, Sammy”
Dean laughed. That was... unexpected. “Wait, what?”
He chuckled. “I realized the other day that I never thanked you for that—saving me, I mean. I never thanked you for anything, really. If you are listening somehow, I wanted to let you know that I miss you. Things aren’t the same here without you around, man. I just... really hope that you can hear me.”
The bartender huffed, wringing his hands together. He bit his lip to stop it from trembling.
Gabriel stood up, shouting for everyone’s attention. It was funny how loud and extroverted the man was.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay, mom.”
He risked resting it on Dean’s back.
“I want you to put your hands on your hips, not so you completely block the boys, but just a little in their space. Good. Now raise your head a little.”
He scanned the coffee shop, eyes landing on the figure across the room. Cas was, today, reading a book. He was biting his bottom lip, eyes darting across the page. It was adorable how caught up in the book Cas was—
And just like that and he was gone, leaving Castiel emotionally wasted.
“I tried, but Cas is gone...”
He sighed, his stomach dropping in disappointment.
“Great!”
They got onto the plane, Castiel lightly massaging Dean’s arm along the way. He thought that at any moment, Dean would have told him to stop. Surprisingly, he never did. On the contrary, the bartender seemed to lean into the touch, as if it was the only thing grounding him.
“I can relate, man.”
The redhead huffed. “We are leaving. Get your stuff”
“Yes.”
The bartender chuckled weakly, setting a pot of water on the stove.
It was quiet for a while after that.
Castiel’s stomach dropped.
Dean laughed quietly at the idea of Castiel watching a Ghostfacer’s marathon with Jo.
“Dean! Have you found a new plus one? Benny told me that he had to cancel...”
Dean felt his cheeks burning, and his mouth hanging open. “...What?’’
Lucifer walked over to them. “Okay. We are back from commercial in four minutes. Let’s get you situated!”
Castiel stood a few feet from the bed, hand resting on the desk. He looked exhausted, his movements sluggish and body covered in sweat. “Can we do it one more time?”
Dean swallowed down his feelings.
This wasn't neighborly.
The middle aged man laughed. “Dean’s told me all about you over the phone!
Right?
The model slammed his head against his kitchen table, wishing he could disappear.
He had always been supportive. Maybe telling him would be a good thing.
The man was humming to the song  ‘All out of love’, a lopsided smile toying with his perfect lips. The sun peeked out from behind the puffy white clouds, illuminating his tan face.
Castiel walked forward, careful to warn Dean about upcoming obstacles.
Dean groaned, wishing that he wasn't surrounded by drunk toddlers. “Are you guys serious?”
Gabriel looked up from his phone. He gasped when seeing Dean’s brother, bringing a hand to his chest.
A tear slid down his cheek.
Dean’s heart skipped. He didn’t know if he should be shocked or suspicious. Cas actually wanted to talk to him?
Sam rose an eyebrow, a smile toying with his lips. “What is he talking about?”
He had to make a good impression. That, or he could kiss his nonexistent chance with Dean goodbye. They bartender prioritized family, and if they didn't approve of him, Castiel would be kicked to the curb.
“Why the fuck are you like this?!?! No, you can’t get a new book!!! Do you really think I would waste money on that???”
“What do you think? Let me guess, you feel bad for me? Or even worse, do you think I’m... broken?”
“Thanks”
~~~~~~
Jo laughed, ebbing him away from his panic attack. “Don’t worry, Casanova, you’ll get your chance.”
She laughed, her dark brown eyes sparkling. “Cassie was a huge nerd, always reading and writing. He was super shy too, usually keeping to himself. It took us a while to be friends, but the wait was worth it.”
Benny knocked on the door again. “Dean?”
He coughed uncomfortably, taking a step back. His hand was still holding Castiel’s. “Can you stay for a bit? Just until I fall asleep?”
This was going to be a long shift...
He paused. “Dean... is that you?”
Hours passed, and a LOT of tears were wasted, but Castiel’s dancing skills had improved immensely.
Castiel felt a wave of panic wash over him. He clutched his hoodie’s sleeve. “Why?”
Eventually, Dean notices that Sam was there. He promptly hands the karaoke mic to an equally drunk group of college students, all of which applaud him on his ‘incredible singing skills’ (Sam had to disagree). The hunter stumbled over to his younger brother, a lopsided grin twisting his lips.
She decided to stay in the hotel. Ellen went to Gabriel’s bachelor party, who had declared to her that they were going to get ‘very drunk’.
Castiel held his breath, unsure of what to say.
“First of all, he is not just a piece of meat for you to throw yourself under. Second of all, that man has a personality. Maybe you should ask him about real shit, rather than what’s in his pants. Now, why don’t you leave, before I get someone to throw you out?”
“Get out.”
Castiel let his hand drift to Dean’s upper arm. “Ready?”
Castiel spluttered, his eyes tearing up. His stomach began to hurt from laughing too hard.
“Hey, folks!!!”
The model flinched, dropping his phone. “Yes, Dean?”
He liked spending his mornings alone with Castiel, drinking tea and complaining about work.
He remembered what John was like before their mother had passed. He loved his children with all his heart. He was a great father... until Mary.
“Were you born like this?”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I’m so sorry.”
He tilted his head, and his stomach did a flip. “Is what true?”
“I don’t.”
Castiel’s hand hit a knot in his back, and he started working it out.
Hope you enjoy! :)
Sam gasped. “Yeah, that’s him. Dean, your crush is here”
Castiel hummed in thought. “What is the worst meal that you have made?”
A giddy smile slid onto his face. About thirty minutes later and he hears a knock at his door.
The angel winced. “I heard your prayer....”
Castiel avoided looking at the camera, giving Lucifer a tiny smile. “A little nervous, but I’m exited to be here with you”
Sam almost drops his coffee mug.
“Okay.... He’s a couple towns away, visiting his dad.”
Sam laughed, running a free hand through his hair. “I know that look! You’re thinking about Cassie, aren’t you???”
Castiel recalled the conversation in his head.
He grins when he speaks. “On one condition.”
Castiel rubbed his arm. “Never, if I don’t tell him about my occupation”
Dean shrugged. “Will I Do it? Yes. Will I make it there alive? probably not”
Jo giggled. “Well, you came to the right place! Lucky for you, I actually took dancing lessons back a couple years back.”
The two walked to the center of the floor. Castiel began to lead Dean, moving his feet skillfully.
Dean nodded, grabbing his keys and jacket. They left the apartment and went down to the lobby. Garth looked up from his phone and saluted them.
Castiel immediately took Dean’s hand, allowing it to wrap around his bicep.
Castiel drank some of the water. He then sat down in the closest booth. “I.... I have something I have to tell you all.”
The model placed his hand on Dean’s. Castiel continued fiddling with something in his other hand.
So after a whole five seconds, the model gave up trying to escape.
“A year and a few months. It’s January tenth.”
Gabriel shrugged. “He wanted to make some calls. He’ll be down in a bit.”
Because he could feel what he thought he was missing.
Should he tell Dean that everyone thinks they are dating?
“So you have then?”
Nope. No way. Never.
They had been back in the hotel for only five minutes. A sense of doom lingered over him.
Gabriel put his fist in his mouth, biting it. Sam grinned. It might not have been romantic, to say the least, but it’s a step forward... a baby step, but still.
Today, Dean had left work early to see Cas. He said something about teaching him how to read Braille.
The model frowned, regret sitting at the bottom of his stomach.
Castiel nodded, his stomach churning.
“I was wondering if you needed company on your walk to the bar? I have a photo shoot later tonight, so I’m free this morning.”
“Is that.... is that KEVIN???”
Castiel was sitting in his seat, dazed. He had almost gotten caught by the paparazzi, but the bartender saved him! A VERY attractive bartender. He had light brown hair, and his tan face had a few freckles on it. His tight black shirt left almost nothing to the imagination.
Rowena’s grin faltered, realization dawning on her face. “One year, minimum. If you end up winning, which is a high probability if you ask me, you would be signing a contract for the next two years.”
He would be proved wrong.... very wrong.
Dean panicked again, their intimate moment long forgotten. “It takes about an hour to get there, and we should get there early—
Dean slipped on the glass of the broken beer bottle. John let go of his son’s shirt collar, and the boy fell.
Dean gave his brother a wink and poured him some leftover coffee. “How are you two?”
No way was Cas getting away with that!
Hello! Thank you all so much for reading my fic! Hope you enjoy.
He rose an eyebrow. “Umm.... yeah?”
At first they talk about small stuff, work and the whether. As the night progressed, the conversation changed.
Castiel gave him a small smile, taking a sip of his coffee. He remained standing, his free hand resting on his book bag. “I told you yesterday that I was a professor, right?”
Dean removed himself from Castiel, resting his hands on the counter. Castiel kept it relatively clean, no crumbs or spills that Dean could detect. He guided himself around the kitchen.
Castiel felt his cheeks warm. He did feel... awful. He felt hot, as if he had a fever. He didn’t know if he should blame the hangover or Dean for it.
Never.
So instead of grabbing his brother and hightailing it home, Sam creeped over to the bar. The bartender, an exhausted looking woman in her mid twenties, grimaced. She, just like Sam, seemed to be disliking Dean’s performance.
Cass coughs out a laugh. "You really don't quit, do you?" Dean raises an eyebrow, and Cass continues, "What makes you think I'd want to go out with you? We hardly even know each other."
Dean doesn’t really know how to end such a speech, so he just awkwardly walks back to his seat and leans his head against Cas’ shoulder. Castiel presses a soft kiss to Dean’s forehead while Sam reaches across a smiling Jack to clap Dean on the shoulder. Eileen taps him on the knee to get his attention and then signs, “You did good.”
“Don’t you ever do that to me again. I couldn’t survive it, Dean. I couldn’t survive it if you hated me.”
“And then, one year and one day ago. It was our anniversary. I got wasted and I was yelling and screaming and,” His voice cracks. “I raised my hand to him. And then our kid, he came in and he asked what was going on. And I could just see it, ya know? I could see my dad shoving me into the wall and my baby brother running out to see what was wrong and I could see it, ya know? And the very next day, I came here. And I’ve been sober ever since.”
Dean falls to one knee, reveling in the ache in his joints, and pulled a small velvet box from his pocket. Cas brings one trembling hand up to cover his mouth.
Jack’s face lights up and yeah, everything is going to be okay.
“Oh, no, that’s alright. I can ride with my dads.”
Dean sucks in a breath through his teeth. "Shoot, ya know, I wish I could, but it's actually a really crazy story. After I dropped you off, I was driving home, and this woman tripped on a cobblestone and felled over right in front of my car. Obviously, I got out to help her and it turns out she was a ballerina and she didn't speak a word of English. So, I took her to the ER and, well, long story short, we eloped. Yeah, I'm actually in Moscow right now."
Dean nods, eyes still boring holes through the floor.
Another car, this time an older black sedan, approaches and Cass shies to the opposite edge of the sidewalk to try to avoid getting sprayed again. The driver slows, turns down his stereo, and rolls down the window. He leans his arm over the passenger seat head rest and smirks, green eyes sparkling with mischief. "Need a ride?"
Cas hums, placing a soft kiss to Dean’s lips. “As you wish.”
"No!" Cass sputters, louder than intended. They drop to a whisper, "Dean, I literally just met you like ten minutes ago--"
“Not quite sure,” Dean whispered, reverent. “I’m making it up as I go.”
Dean looks to Cas, choking on a sob that he tries to disguise as a cough. Cas keeps his eyes locked on Dean as he whispers, “Of course, Jack. This is our home.”
"So about that date..."
Jack is already waiting in the backseat of Baby. Dean immediately realises that Cas must’ve told Jack to dress up, too, because aside from his usual oversized t-shirt and baggy jeans, he’s wearing a lime green bowtie. It’s incredibly tacky and incredibly Jack.
Cas rolls on top of Dean. “You know, we could just stay in tonight.”
After Cas got back from the Empty, he and Dean were practically inseparable, not to mention insatiable. Stolen kisses in the kitchen, lips dragging across tanned expanses of skin, Dean had never been so happy, but something was still wrong. And Cas could see it, too.
Cass bites their cheek until they taste copper, trying to find something, anything to say in return and, of course, coming up short. They just sink down against the wall, phone pressed to their ear, trying to process the fantastical story they'd just heard. A moment passes before Dean says, incredulous, "Oh, Cass, please don't tell me you've never seen Bojack Horseman?"
Dean chuckles and gets out of the car, coming around to the other side to help Cass out. As they walk toward the door, Cass could swear they heard Dean mutter, "We'll see about that."
Jack makes a face at the salad and Dean pretends to sympathise but… well, can you keep a secret? Sam didn't actually send him the recipe. Dean looked it up himself because he wanted to make sure Jack was getting enough vegetables, even though he was pretty sure being a celestial being kind of nullified the importance of a balanced diet.
"And thank you, Eileen. For kicking my brother's ass into shape. Knowing he's with you made it a helluva lot easier to let go of some of that control I'd been clinging to and just focus on me."
He walks back to the kitchen and pours the bottle down the drain. When it’s about halfway empty…
"Why don't you check the refrigerator, Jack," Dean suggests.
"Cass, I think that coffee might be bigger than you."
Cas turns it over in his hand a few times, blinking back tears. He nods, the smallest, most unnoticeable flick of his chin.
“I had my first beer when I was nine years old. My dad and I had just gotten back from a hunting trip,” he smirks at Sam, “and he was proud of me. Of course, he would never say that. I don’t even think ‘proud’ was in his vocabulary. So instead, he cracked open a cold one.” Dean is hit with the mental image of his little fingers trying in vain to close around the bottle. “That was kind of his solution to everything. Hell, everyone in my family’s solution. My Uncle Bobby, bless his dumbass, he practically raised me when my dad was too drunk or too pissed to do it himself. But Bobby, he drank, too. Lost his wife real young, just like my dad, just like my brother. Tragedy just seems to run in the family. I’ve lost track of all the friends we’ve lost along the years. But then, about two years ago, everything got real good all of a sudden. My kid brother got married to a girl way out of his league. I was honourably discharged.” Another sly look at Sammy and then at Cas. “And I finally told the love of my life that I was head over heels for him. We even adopted a kid. I had everything I’d ever wanted. And I was still fucking miserable.
"Isn't that the point of dating? To get to know each other," Dean says. Then, with a wink, he adds, "Well, among other things, I suppose."
"I thought you liked both cake
When they tell Jack about the vacation, both Cas and Dean swallow their tears and replace them with excitement. But Jack knows they’re hurting. He knows they’re fighting. What he doesn’t know is
After Cas died that last time, Dean fell pretty hard into the bottle. He’d never had a great relationship with alcohol, but after losing the love of his life without even having a chance to say it back? He’s surprised he didn’t drown in all the whiskey he drank.
"Cass, please. God, please, don't do this. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. It should have never happened and I swear to God, it'll never happen again just, please, please, don't do this."
Cas cowers against the wall as Dean stalks closer to him and if he had any presence of mind, he might think how funny this all is, an Angel of the Lord, a wave of celestial intent so powerful he could disintegrate Dean with a mere flick of his wrist, cowering in the corner like some Edwardian housewife. Because he could never hurt Dean. No matter what Dean did to him, if he beat him, if he killed him, Cas could never even think of hurting Dean.
To his shoulder. “Perfect.”
Cass tries to steady their voice, but that dark, gravelly pitch sends a chill straight to the pit of their stomach. They already knew it was him--they would recognise that voice anywhere--but they ask anyway, "Hey, uh, is this--is this, uh, Dean?"
"Y'ello?"
“I forgive you. I forgive you and I love you, too, Dean.”
It’s been a year. One year of falling asleep curled up in one another, of waking up to sleepy morning kisses. One year of unconditional, unrelenting love.
Dean tries not to think about how quiet the bunker had become, particularly when the boys are away. He turns up his music to drown out the loneliness, the abandonment anxiety creeping up on him. He flutters about nervously, peaking in on the lasagna, worried it'll dry out if he left it in the oven much longer. He turns the radio off.
He turns back to the bar, setting down the beers he’d grabbed for himself and Cas, instead signaling the bartender to bring him something stronger.
Dean glances over at a wide-eyed, slack-jawed Cass and chuckles. "You're not looking bad yourself," he says, gesturing at Cass' shirt which is soaked against their skin, outlining every curve of their chest. Cass sputters and awkwardly tugs at their shirt to try to get it to sit more loosely, eventually just zipping their jacket in defeat. "Aww," Dean sighs, "I was really enjoying the view."
December 8, 2017
"I didn't do this, Dean. You did. Now get out before I call security."
some other dude, on our fucking
“Again, with the ‘somethings’. Come on, Dean, what is it?” Another nudge. Carefree Sam was an amazing but also very annoying little brother.
The size of the table and the number of chairs seemed to adjust to the number of beings gathered around it. Now, it was only a small table with two chairs placed next to each other.
Following their first success, Jack didn’t hesitate to send them out again when the next Empty Reaper appeared. This time, they were sent to Thailand. Dean would have liked a bit of sightseeing, considering that he had never been to Asia. Hell, he had barely ever left the States, just the occasional trip to Canada and Mexico, and his one trip to Europe to pick up Crowley’s bones. He could blame his fear of flying but it was only part of it. He could have dealt with it, as he had done for Bobby on their trip to Scotland. But he never felt like he could take the liberty to go on a holiday longer than a night out to a bar. What if something happened to Sam or dad while he was gone? What if someone got hurt or killed while he was sipping margaritas on a beach? So, holidays were never a thing.
More days past with dinners, visiting hunters, nights at the Roadhouse and days just spent in the sun.
In the meantime, Castiel had hugged Mary and Eileen, and greeted John Winchester. Dean, Sam, and Mary had told John about both Castiel and Jack, but he was still eyeing Jack sceptically. It probably wasn’t easy to imagine the scrawny looking kid as God Almighty. Sam was trying to convince him and judging by the disbelieving look on his father’s face, Dean guessed that it was going about as well as one could hope for.
Sweeter words had rarely been spoken, and Dean was out of bed faster than ever before.
They all looked up then they descended. Sam was still smiling widely when he looked at them. But it became clear that the youngest Winchester had not told the others anything. Dean watched as each hunter went through the process of putting two and two together, reacting with a mixture of raised eyebrows, grinning smiles and dropped jaws. It was far from the first time Dean and Cas had walked next to each other. Cas could just have popped into his room this morning, couldn’t he? But there must have been something different about them to make everyone react this way.
Castiel couldn’t hide his own smile, and quickly took off. No goodbye this time. Just a silent promise to return.
Chapter 4:
Dean’s and Sam’s eyes met. For a moment, time stood still. Then, they reacted in quite opposite manners. Sam started grinning and Dean looked like he wouldn’t mind spontaneously combusting. “Damnit Sammy!”
Dean knew that Castiel meant well, but he couldn’t take any more of this… chick flicking. Right now, he wanted to forget all about that stupid training session. He felt tired, but not in the sleep-needing kind of way. He remembered that Castiel didn’t need sleep. So now, he probably didn’t need it either. He was just spent from the fight and that energy explosion. He stretched his back muscles as much as possible without pushing Castiel off of his arm. Something fluttered behind him. Right. “I have wings.”
"Oh, okay, be right out."
“Oh, relax. You can always just mojo us there.”
“Castiel, I meant it when I said you are the only thing that makes my life worth living. You are the reason I want to wake up in the morning and the only person I want with me when I fall asleep at night. I love you more than should be humanly possible. So Cas, will you make me the happiest man on Earth and marry me?”
Dean leans forward and takes Cass' hands in his own. "Cass, this is your life and yours alone. You don't owe anybody anything. Not me, not your family. You're right; sometimes people can lash out about harmless things simply because they don't understand them. So, if you truly don't feel safe going on a date with me, that's ok. But if you change your mind," he pulls a pen from inside his jacket and scribbles on a napkin, "here's my number." He places a chaste kiss on Cass' knuckle and then lets go, leaving Cass' hands feeling cold and vacant. Cass waits in stunned silence for him to leave but he stays seated.
"I was just going to get some coffee. Sundollars. It's just a few blocks away."
Cas presses their foreheads together and whispers, "Y yo a ti."
At around six o'clock, Cass drags themself up off the floor and theatrically throws open their wardrobe, sifting through a very drab collection of clothes and wanting to crawl out of their skin with dysphoria. They settle for a black button-down and dark jeans, tousling their hair as though there's any chance it's going to cooperate tonight. They stare into their reflection for a moment, longing to live in a home, in a world, where they didn't have to hide behind traditional masculinity. Tentatively, they wander into the bathroom, kneeling in front of the counter and reaching into the very back of their bottom drawer. They pull out a candy-coloured lipgloss, something an old friend left at their house years ago, something Cass has treasured ever since, pulling it out only on the most vital of occasions to give them the boost of confidence they need to get through the night. They unscrew the top and breathe in the sickeningly sweet scent of artificial strawberries. Hesitantly, they touch the wand to their bottom lip. The shimmer on Cass' lips is hardly noticeable, but it's Earth-shattering to them.
"Hey, sorry, I woulda knocked but I wasn't sure if your family knew who was picking you--"
"No, thank you." Cass mumbles, having seen far too much Cold Case Files to accept a ride from a handsome stranger.
That is until he remembers they’re not alone.
“Then why were you letting him touch you with his stupid beefy muscly freaking hands?!”
- - -
"And we're already on our first date!" Dean interjects. "Oh, how time flies."
"Wait, what about cake?" Jack interrupts, oblivious to Castiel’s increasing understanding of the double entendre.
"Suit yourself, Cutie." The mysterious driver rolls up his window and drives a little ways down the block when it starts pouring rain. The driver pulls over again, and Cass stares at the brake lights, debating whether this man is more likely to kill them than the pneumonia they'll inevitably get if they walk. Sighing, Cass breaks into a sprint and climbs into the car.
December 12, 1999
"What's for dinner?" Jack asks when he pulls away.
They lay there together for a moment, catching their breath.
"Our first--Our first what? Dean, this is not a date. You did not ask me out on a date and I certainly did not agree to one."
"Lasagna and garlic bread, and some stupid kale salad thing Sam sent me the recipe for."
"Oh, uh, this--this is Cass. Uh, from the car--I mean, ya know, you, um, gave me a ride a few weeks ago."
They take a deep breath and undo the top two buttons of their shirt, shaken by the vibration of their phone against their thigh. "Hello?" The word comes out more breathless than they'd meant it to.
Cas walks closer, slowly, too slowly. Scared.
guy?!” He demands, jerking his finger over his shoulder at the muscular man who’d been flirting with him just minutes prior.
"What," his lover teased, "no good morning kiss?"
The flutter of wings.
They shower and dress and then Cas mojos them to some snazzy bar so they won’t have to worry about driving home.
Jack and Cas had been gone for two days, running some errands for Amara up in Heaven. Once Jack gave her all of the light power, she took her job as God very seriously—moreso than Chuck ever had. She’s been feeling kind of overwhelmed, honestly, so Cas and Jack have been helping out when they can. Dean was proud for it, proud that he had a family who would work so hard to bring change to the world, but he had to admit that he missed them when they were away. Especially now that Sam had moved in with Eileen.
Just feeling Cass' cheek pressed against his forearm drives Dean crazy. Every fibre of his being is telling him to jump out of the car, throw open the passenger door, and kneel down in the dirt in front of rows and rows of moviegoers. It's what he would do if Cass were literally anybody else. But somewhere inside of him, he decides to take this slow, to try to memorise this moment with his arm cast around this beautiful person. He has this unshakeable feeling deep within his core that tonight, there is no need to rush. He and Cass would have the rest of their lives to spend together, to kneel in the dirt, so tonight, Dean could just sit back with his arm around his beautiful person and fall in love.
"No!" Dean chuckles at Cass' naivety. "But I gotta say, I don't know if I can date someone who's never seen Bojack."
"Well, considering I don't even remember your name--"
Cas shoves Dean away from him, full Angel of the Lord mode. “Now, listen here dickwad.” The name sounds so foreign, rolling off his tongue, like a child picking up his parents bad words. “Jack and I are going to go on a little vacation--Disney World, perhaps--and you are going to get your shit together. I don’t know how, and I don’t really care, but just know that if you ever,
Cass glances longingly at the clock on their nightstand. It's only noon but their brain has gone into Waiting Mode™, and they know they won't be able to focus on anything but Dean for the next seven hours. They throw their head back against the wall and, being new to this whole *actually admitting to literally anyone that I'm gay thing*, fall back on the most omnipresent aspect of gay culture. They decide to spend the next seven hours yearning.
He breaks the seal and inhales deeply. He thought he’d missed the smell, the burn in his eyes with his face right over the bottle, but now, it just made him feel sick. He thinks of how lonely he feels now and he just knows that if he takes a sip, he’ll feel that lonely forever. If he falls backward, he will lose his family, and it will be his fault.
make my child cry again, we will leave this place and we will never come back. Do you understand?”
“Come here, kid.” Dean lifts one arm from Castiel’s shoulder and gestures Jack toward them. They all hug again. A family.
they’ve left him for good this time. He just
"Drive," Cass commands.
“Then, shut up and let me drive.”
They make awkward small talk on the way to the theatre, Cass unsure of how to follow up their former brazenness.
Dean nods minutely and Cas and Jack pack their bags, Cas hovering almost protectively around Jack.
"Oh? You get a little jealous of my mysterious Russian ballerina?" Cass could practically hear his cocky little smirk, could feel his emerald eyes piercing, sparkling, like a serpent's right before it strikes.
"I thought you said it was an abomination?"
Dean turns around to see Cas and Jack standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
“Dean?” he starts, cautiously. “Is everything alright?”
They stop by Lactose King on the way to the movie, with Dean insisting to pay for Cass' milkshake. Dean watches out of the corner of his eye as Cass put on a show, plucking the cherry from their shake, lapping the whipped cream off of it and then sucking it off the stem.
Cass glances out the window and their mind drifts to scenes of Dean's other hand adventuring past the console and creeping up their thigh. "We're here," Dean annouces, Cass nearly jumping out of their skin.
"Oh, okay, yeah, uh, cool." Cass tries not to stumble through their words as they take in Dean's appearance for the first time. He sports a leather jacket over a black T-shirt, with worn-out jeans and work boots, a kind of rough, masculine look that, combined with his chiseled jaw and enigmatic eyes, sends an ungodly chill down Cass' spine.
December 28, 1999
“And thank you, Cas. God, thank you, Cas. Thank you for loving me. For seeing the good in me when I sure as hell couldn’t. Thank you for protecting our kid. Thank you for leaving when you had to, and staying when you could. I would have died for anyone, you know that, Cas, but you are the only man on Earth who I chose to live for. I love you so much.” Cas crosses his fingers in a little heart he learned from those silly Korean boys he likes so much.
Cass had always hated the cold, but their caffeine addiction overrides any practical thoughts they might have. It had finally stopped raining and Cass decided to take the opportunity to get a coffee from Sundollars.
He finally opened his eyes. The world came back. But it looked different. He squinted, trying to figure out what he was seeing. But it all just looked like lights. Five golden balls of light and a bluish white one that almost outshined the others.
“Humans find comfort in sleep and a daily rhythm. But no, it is not necessary. As you already know, time sometimes moves differently up here, if beneficial for the individual soul.” Castiel turned around to turn off the bedside lamp. “But rest is, as they say, good for the soul.”
Dean moved in his sleep, pressing himself closer to Castiel. The hand that had been casually resting on Castiel’s side snaked around him and now rested on his lower back. Dean was snuggled up against him. Castiel allowed his arm to mirror Dean’s movement and rested it on the small of Dean’s back instead of on his arm. Castiel got the feeling that this was yet another adorable thing about the hunter that was not to be mentioned, only appreciated.
Jack smiled at their approval.
Castiel felt a surge of nervousness when Jack called him. His son’s timing was less than desirable. He was just about to repeat the much more desirable kissing with Dean when Jack’s voice had kindly requested his presence.
“You can say that again.” John shuffled his feet, holding an arm around Mary’s shoulders. It seemed to be both a comforting and grounding gesture for both of them.
did it.” Jack corrected.
Dean laughed out loud, nerves releasing themselves from his chest. “I don’t know, Cas. That’s the whole point. I just know that I am a hell of a lot happier with you around. And that it’s different to how Sam makes me happy. With Sam, I always have to be the big brother, always have to have my guards up. But with you, I just have to be me. No matter how bad I got, how angry, you were always there for me, pulling me back. Keeping me right. You changed me too, Cas. I tried to be better. For you.” Another shaky breath. “And I just took you for granted and I’m so sorry, Cas. You deserved so much better. You’ve always believed so much in me, and I just...”
“Wait.”
The Empty frowned at Jack. “Speak.”
“I spend a lot of time with Jack, strategizing and sending out other Angels on assignments. At first, it was mainly protecting the gates and maintaining Heaven. As with many new things, New Heaven experienced a few teething troubles.” Castiel considered if he should just stop there, but Dean had asked for honesty, and he was going to honour that. “Then, the Empty attacked. It led to battles along Heaven’s gates, but New Heaven is much stronger than the last time it attacked. We successfully kept the Empty out. We thought it had gone back to sleep, when suddenly we were contacted by the Reapers. They told us about these new Reapers who enclosed the souls in black and took them away. They thought that Jack had created new Reapers and wanted to complain about it. But… when they told us the details, we realised that it was the Empty. Since then, we have worked with the Reapers to fight the Empty Reapers to the best of our ability. But we can’t have an Angel following every Reaper. There are too many Reapers.”
“I’m afraid so.” Jack answered. “And even that is a long shot. We are only assuming that the Archangels were created from the void and that there might still be some of the primal force within the Archangels’ grace. But they must have been created from something. They must contain elements from the time of their creation, from the void.”
want to know.” Sam concurred, and the rest of the table nodded in agreement.
“Maybe we should take me for a trial run. Something easy to get my engines going.” Dean suggested.
Then, Dean went to meet his family and friends. And it just never felt right to barge in on his happiness. Castiel was not sure whether or not he was wanted.
But Castiel couldn’t see the Empty Reaper intercepting his path. It struck the Angel from behind with a force so great that Castiel bounced of the pavement when he hit it before landing again, knocked out.
Jack continued after a pointed look at his father. “We know of one other being besides God that is able to see the normal Reapers even in hiding. They might be able to see the Empty Reapers and may also be powerful enough to fight them.”
It had all taken so much work and diplomacy that Castiel had not yet truly considered that he would one day have to face Dean again. Dean was going to live a long, happy life. He had plenty of time to not worry.
/ ‘Fallen Angel’ by Three Days Grace
“It would only be temporary. And you would not be alive, exactly. No living human can exist in the realm of Heaven.” At Dean’s angry, confused look, Jack elaborated calmly. “We would make it more like a possession. You would be possessing your old body, taking control of it, at least until the grace would be regenerated and turn you into an Archangel. But as you know, even the grace of an Archangel can be removed, making you mortal again, and then I can bring you back to the dead.”
When they could no longer hold back, every shadow was banished from the room by the golden light that exploded as they clung to each other.
to know.”
Dean cut him off with a small kiss. Castiel was surprised by how the small gesture deleted everything that he had so meticulously planned to say in order to apologise to Dean.
Castiel would have run to him, but he couldn’t move. The power was becoming stronger. The room was filling with a blinding light, blinding to even an Angel, and the screeching sound of celestial power. Castiel found himself squinting and wanted to cover his ears, but he had to hear what Dean was screaming. He couldn’t see Dean anymore. “Dean?! Jack?!” But he could still hear Dean’s screams. “DEAN! Jack, stop!”
Castiel smiled at the hunter’s bravado, seeing it for what it was. He simply answered; “Yes. You better be.”
They popped in right in front of Sam. The younger Winchester had been carrying a pitcher of water in one hand and some stacked glasses in the other, but it all dropped to the floor with a crash.
“We decided to take it slow…” Dean tried to defend his… what, exactly? Did they have titles now? Did they want titles? Did they need them?
It took almost a week before Dean was alone with Sam again. It was not a bad thing, just that Eileen and Sam had plenty catching up to do and they had gone to see Eileen’s parents as well. They had even started talking about getting their own place at some point. It was probably a good idea. Maybe Dean should find his own place as well. They were not kids anymore and living at home with their parents for the rest of eternity did have a bad ring to it. But no one was in a rush. Right now, the safety and love of being surrounded by family was more important than independence.
Dean started kissing down the Angel’s chest, enjoying the feeling of the erratic breathing underneath his touch. He started noticing a different sensation compared to their first time together. As Cas started losing control of himself, his grace started shining through more clearly. It flared and pulsated with his breaths and sighs. Instead of the normal bluish white, it became warmer, more golden. Dean felt the warmth from Cas’ body on a new level. “You’re shining, love. It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
The Empty cocked its head, looking at Jack’s outstretched hand as if it might grow teeth and bite. But when no such thing happened, it mirrored the action and shook Jack’s hand while mumbling. “Maybe new God is not as stupid as old God.”
Dean looked up and found Castiel walking up to them. “Cas, we talked about this…”
Sam cleared his throat. “I’m, uhm… I’ll hit the books. Maybe call Bobby and see if he can help with the research.”
when he greeted Bobby. Then he got a tight, desperate hug. When Bobby saw Castiel over his shoulder, he pulled back and looked knowingly between hunter and Angel. “About damn time.”
He moved his hands to pull at the hem of Dean’s T-shirt, and the hunter moved back, just enough to give him space to pull the fabric over his head. As soon as the shirt hit the floor, Castiel tenderly touched Dean’s torso. It was everything he never thought he could have, right under his fingertips. An eagerly beating heart under hard muscle and scarred skin.
Before Dean could collect his thoughts and settle on a reaction, he had his arms full of… God. Well, there’s a sentence you don’t hear yourself think every day.
Dean grinned. “So, we make the rules. I like that.”
Cas’ voice. That was good, reassuring.
Dean allowed himself a second to register that the outside of the Gate was an intangible as the insides. The only difference was that the white fogginess was overrun by what looked like Empty Reapers. All pitch-black bodies slamming against the Gate, crawling on top of each other to tear at the pearly, white barrier. There were many more than he had imagined.
Chapter 15:
It was amazing to see them again. Of course, they lived in the Roadhouse, looking just like it had before it was burned down.
Sam took in a breath, like he always did when Dean was opening up. It was usually both difficult to hear what his brother had to say, and hard to watch him struggle through it. Though they had always been close, Dean had never allowed himself to be Sam’s equal. He was always the protector, standing strong and alert around the pedestal that he had put Sam on. Dean didn’t continue on his own, but he had a small smile on his face, so Sam carefully pushes: “So… how do you feel?”
“Of course. Anything you need.” Jack innocently agreed.
“To get this right.” Dean corrected. “To get used to having someone. Be with someone. In an actual relationship. I didn’t… I never imagined… I dreamed, of course, but…” He looked up at Cas and couldn’t help the smile that spread on his face. ”But here you are. Damnit, Cas… What I’m trying to ask is… Would you mind if we skipped going slow and, uhh… you know…?” Dean looked down at the bed below them.
Then, a flutter of wings, a blink of an eye, and Castiel stood before him.
This time, Dean noticed how Castiel’s grace flared, and his wings spread before the rooms shifted and they stood in front of Jack.
“Sure. But, just so you know, Jack is here and wants to talk about the Empty.” Sam sobered a bit, but one look at Castiel brought the smile back.
“We are under attack!” Jack stepped up, his eyes large with alarm. “It’s the Empty. Its attacking Heaven’s gates!”
He felt something behind him. Someone was moving back there. Probably Jack. Jack had been behind him. He was touching his shoulder blades. Odd. He tried flexing his back muscles to get him to back off, to make Jack give him some space. But Jack just moved with his muscles. Come on. “Kid, let go of my back.”
One of the first things that Jack had done , even before remodelling Heaven, had been to visit Mary in order to ask for Mary’s forgiveness, which he had received it in a warm hug. It had warmed Castiel’s heart that even as God, Jack cared about the forgiveness of one single human. It was beautiful and spoke volumes of his character.
“Dean. You don’t have to say anything if it makes you uncomfortable. Just know that I meant every word and do not expect anything in return. My… My love is mine to give, and it does not depend on reciprocation.” The words were slightly rehearsed but no less sincere.
Nothing happened.
Everyone seemed to forget about the Empty, even in these black, bare surroundings. They were all here, together. They were all that mattered. A family unrelated by blood, whose paths had crossed because of a pair of wayward brothers. They had all amounted to something much bigger than themselves due to the sacrifices and bravery of the Winchesters. So, when asked if they would come to the end of the universe to raise a little mayhem, they had had no doubts nor hesitations.
“Yes, you did.” Castiel agreed with a fond smile. “You did more than anyone could have ever asked of you. Asked of anyone. You carried the world on your shoulders, and still kept going.”
/ ‘Bad Company’ by Five Finger Death Punch (Of course originally by Bad Company, but I got to know it through FFDP.
Behind Jack’s back, Mary hugged her oldest son, who was obviously very happy underneath all the embarrassment. Sam patted Castiel on the back, letting him know that it was alright. John put a hand on his son’s shoulder, giving him a quick squeeze and a smile. Eileen signed something at them that Dean didn’t understand, but Castiel answered with a soft smile and a sign of his own. At Dean’s bewildered look, Castiel leaned in and whispered; “She congratulated us. Apparently, we are ‘glowing’.”
The Demon shied back, crawling along the invisible barrier. It could clearly detect what it was facing. Dean couldn’t deny the rush of satisfaction he felt to see a Demon fear him this way. For all the times when he had had to put on a brave face in front of one of these monsters, knowing they were quicker, stronger, more powerful. Sure, he had skills. But he was still just a man. Until now.
“Yeah, I could.” Dean argued. “I heard Cas!”
Basically: It was all very complicated, and no one really knew anything.
“Yeah, it’s splattered all over that wall. Like doughy graffiti.” Dean pointed at the wall again.
“And you. But you’re not stepping down, and neither am I!” Dean growled. “We’re soldiers, Cas. And soldiers fight!”
Dean tore his eyes away from Cas, just in time to see the Empty Reaper preparing a new attack against him and Cas, a new spear already shaping in its hand.
In that moment, the front door swung open, and an exciting yell called out to them. “Hey guys?!”
“Great. Now get out before I kill the freaking messenger.” Dean growled.
“Yeah… Chuck once said that it would take time to resurrect and create new Archangels. And he had a bit more experience in the field than you do.” Sam contemplated.
Now that everyone was gathered, they all went to Sam’s room to walk through the newly added door that connected the room to the Angel’s part of Heaven.
“And you really think an Archangel could fight them?”
The Empty looked around at the large group of people, and hissed “What is this?”
“We can’t leave all the Angels here.” Sam said. “They deserve to rest peacefully.”
“Remove your Reapers!” Jack commanded.
“Yeah. I want to do this with you, while I’m still me. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow, how the grace will affect me. Or if it will go wrong.” Dean took Castiel’s hand. “I didn’t want our first time to be a ‘last night in Heaven’ kind of thing, but... I just know I’d regret it if I didn’t ask.”
“They are mine. Already reaped by me.” The Empty parroted Jack’s words from earlier with a sick smile.
“That... was two questions, Sammy.” Dean teased, pointing a finger at his brother, receiving an exasperated look in return.
“So, you’ve heard of us, huh?” Dean stepped forward. “Good. No need for introductions, then.”
If Dean didn’t know any better, he might say that he was getting restless. But you don’t get restless in Heaven. Right? But it was becoming clear that he needed to see Cas.
He was greeted by a hug. Their hugs were still a bit too long, a bit too tight. There was an air of desperation in the affectionate act. It was fuelled by losing his mother twice and a life of longing for something so simple as a hug from his mother.
“Are you alright?” Castiel broke the silence carefully.
When he could finally catch his breath, the severity of the situation hit him, and anger settled into its familiar place in his stomach. He turned it on the kid in front of him. “But you said no more interferences, Jack. You didn’t even tell us that Cas was back! That he was alright! And now you are talking about bringing me back to life? And turning me into a freaking Angel? How the hell is that ‘hands off’!?”
The Empty Reaper turned towards him. Despite its smooth, featureless surface, it seemed to be contemplating him, wondering how he could see it.
Dean never thought he would see the Angel again. He felt his façade crumbling at the realisation. The memory of Cas’ death suddenly tainted his eyes and his smile. In three quick strides he drew the Angel in for a tight hug. Tears whelmed up in his eyes as he breathed out; “I missed you, Cas, I missed you so God damn much. I’m so happy you’re back.”
“Just call him, okay? You said you invited them for dinner, so ask if they want to come by.”
“Right.” Dean looked around at his family, who followed them with eyes full of concern and nervous energy. Dean caught Cas’ arm before the Angel could start explaining and dragged him away from the group. He did not need an audience for this.
It was clear where Jack had gotten his inspiration from.
-.-.-.-
Is every Destiel fan destined to end up writing their own version of Dean and Cas ending up together?
When they were alone, Mary looked apologetically at her sons and daughter-in-law. “I’ll go talk to your dad.”
“You too... You will never know how bright you shine.” Cas pulled Dean up for a searing kiss.
“You know what, love? This bed. Is way too neat.” Dean whispered in-between kisses and started pressing down on Castiel’s chest, guiding him down on the bed. He slowly started unbuttoning the white shirt. “I suggest we mess it up a bit. You okay with that, love?”

His bedroom was not his childhood room, thankfully. The bed would have been much too small, and he had – almost – outgrown the red racing car-patterned wallpaper. Instead, it was his room from the bunker with his exact decor and personal touches, though it was more spacious. The only major difference was the window that let in the red rays of the rising sun.
The serenity was disturbed by a sudden voice. A voice that was not supposed to be here. Sam’s.
It felt awkward and lacking, if this momentous emotional step should end like this, so Dean coughed nervously and tried, unsuccessfully, to pull himself together. “So, Castiel…” Castiel squinted at the use of his full name. Dean looked almost shy. “Would you mind… if I kissed you?”
Dean stared at the table, avoiding all the eyes resting on him, waiting for his reaction. He finally gritted out; “Alright. Fine. Go get my body and extract the grace. It’s all yours.” Problem solved, right?
But to the celestial beings, Dean was wrapped in blue light. Grace was running along with the blood in his veins, swirling around his muscles and pumping with every heartbeat. His back was shielded by six massive wings, folded neatly around him in a protective gesture.
“We don’t know for sure. Reapers are not easily created, so we don’t think there are many. Yet. The power to reap souls is complex and draining to create.”
But Dean wanted to see him. So bad.
“Not yet.” Everyone turned to look at Sam as he spoke up.
Damn that Angel. He had always had that piercing look that made Dean spill his guts. It just felt wrong to lie to a freaking Angel when it clearly knew you were. “It really is good, Cas… I’m happy. At peace. I guess it has just given me a few things to think about. You, for one thing.” Another flirting smile, and Castiel couldn’t help but to love it. “But also… I’ve thought a lot about who I am… I mean… There’s no monster hunting up here. Sammy is safe. He has Eileen again. They’re happy together. So, being here… has made me realise that I didn’t really achieve much in life on the personal front. I mean, I even live with my parents, for God’s sake. I guess I just… don’t know who I am up here… yet.”
-.-.-.-
“Maybe I can hurt it.” Dean suggested. “I can hurt the Empty Reapers, maybe I can also hurt the Empty.”
Dean lets out a loud wolf-whistle and Cas rolls his eyes fondly.
Cas falls to his knees and throws his arms around Dean’s neck. “Yes, yes, to the end of time, yes.”
“Dean, what the hell are you--Wait,
Jack hesitates, hands hanging limp at his sides, tears prickling in his eyes. He looks so small, so scared. “Now, Jack,” Cas says. “We’ll be in in a minute to speak with you.” Jack scurries away like a mouse running from a cat.
He fiddles with the bronze chip in his hand. “So thank you, Jack, for making me the person I want to be. You’re a good kid and I’m so damn proud of you.”
"Fine, fine," Dean concedes, leaning back and studying Cass' face. He waits until Cass had seemingly calmed and then asks, "Will you go on a date with me?"
