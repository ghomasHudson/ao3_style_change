“Let’s clarify,” John began in his most commanding tone. “You get to drink, but you don’t get to bite. You stop when I tell you to, and then you will tell us where to find MacCafferty. Understood?”
Harriet Watson, however, was a special case. While John had not asked for this, Estrode set out to locate her nevertheless. It might not have been him that sired John, yet after centuries of regular contact, of acting as his friend and advisor, Estrode had come to look upon John as his childe and thus cared for him in his own way. Finding his sister was going to be a surprise and only two months ago Estrode would have sent word to John immediately that his sister currently was in Liverpool.
John didn’t dare whisper anything to Sherlock since Victoria’s heightened senses would allow her to eavesdrop. Instead, John let his thumb rub soothing circles into Sherlock’s skin through the layers of clothing. Once again Sherlock tensed, but relaxed into the touch a rapid heartbeat later.
“You call that flat,” he said dismissively. “It’s an ugly bedsit.”
, he told himself, even as he exchanged some money for their drinks. The small touches and the way John had behaved at the club were still getting to Sherlock, filling his head with ideas he had no indication were based on John’s genuine interest.
“It wouldn’t have killed me either,” Gabriel remarked when their eyes met.
If Henricus Estrode thought the 1960s had been exhausting and unnerving, he did not know how to describe the 1970s. However, underneath his exasperation with the human tendency to continuously cause trouble by challenging established norms lay a fascination with their race’s inability to stand still.
“Was everything I said correct?” Sherlock asked curiously.
“You said it was enormous!” Hamish protested, making them laugh despite the situation.
With monumental effort, Sherlock took a deep breath. On the exhale, most of the tension left his body and a blush rose in his cheeks. That baffled John more than the location Victoria had provided.
“You cannot do this, Estrode!” Simon Dale groused, and rather loudly at that.
William, however, didn’t calm down. “We can’t, sire! Entire streets are burning and it’s spreading, fast! There are reports that one of ours started it, feeding off a baker and somehow… I’m not clear on the details, but the bakery went up in flames and it’s spreading, fast.”
The vampire and Sherlock held each other’s gaze for a moment, and this time Mycroft had real difficulties suppressing an eye-roll. He had counted on their personalities clashing and seeing it play out as imagined was even more tedious.
John was instantly smitten and very soon he figured out that her name was Diane.
The vigilantes would end up killing more people than the fire, he thought bitterly as he pressed a cloth to his arm. John was hidden from view in an abandoned backyard, only a few droplets of blood on the ground giving away his journey from the street to here.
John laughed and promised to bring him a souvenir before walking away, certain that a bit of space would do both of them good.
"What else did she say?"
"Thank you for your help, Countess. If you remember anything else, please let us know immediately."
John hadn’t removed his hand, but even without it he would have heard the stutter in Sherlock’s pulse that indicated the lie.
Molly reddened, but she continued. "It makes the heart beat. Briefly. That's what Dan said, uh, my contact. He said the quick addicting effect is due to the incredible high, and most who try it once never stop despite the bad side effect."
"No one talks to my niece like that!" the man then spat in Sherlock’s direction, his face twisted into a scowl.
The grey building sat surrounded by soft hills, trees and hedges in the countryside, overlooking the sea. A small, asphalted path split off the main road, marked by a wooden sign indicating it was leading towards "Glenda Manor".
Moving to Glasgow turned out to have been a good decision. John became a well-known doctor who took care of the poorer population in his neighbourhood. Every now and then he went to visit his son, who only met him when his wife was out. He became a father in the same year John told him he was a vampire and presented his newborn son to him. As much as John wanted the baby to know that he was his grandfather, he decided to not see the child anymore when he turned five as he expected the little boy to notice that he wasn’t aging and he didn’t dare to ask the Council again to involve the child in his secret.
“Only if you leave us days without shelter from it. It’s nearly like with humans if you put them into the desert without water. I survived Afghanistan, though. Bloody hot it was there, too,” John sighed, turning his gaze out of the window and Sherlock assumed he was thinking about his days in the army. “We have a special suncream that protects us and we also cover our skin when it’s as sunny as today,” he replied after a moment, meeting Sherlock’s eyes again.
Sherlock snorted, clearly about to give a rude reply, so John beat him to it, leaning forward and stopping Sherlock’s comment with a hand on his shoulder.
"Which is?" John prompted before Sherlock could be any ruder.
"You stopped her husband being executed?"
"Either choose a different inflection or leave me alone," Sherlock snarled viciously. He had spent the past hour staring at their wall, littered with intel, maps of cities with highlighted locations of fetish clubs, scraps of information that Sherlock's homeless network had been able to gather, but other than that there was no sign of their suspect.
Of course, it couldn’t stay like that forever. At the end of the nineteenth century, there was a revolt among the vampires living in Northern Europe, a revolt that was carried by the idea of unveiling their secret and taking over the human world. Out of a blind rage, many innocent humans were killed in several massacres, even women and children, which gained huge attention from the Vampire Council but also the human leaders of the European nations. They sent investigators to find out the reason for the huge bloodshed, never expecting the revelation that was about to come. The Vampire Council arranged a meeting with all European leaders and took the greatest step in vampire history – they revealed their true nature. No one wanted to believe them at first, but when one creature picked up a president and slammed him into a wall, baring his fangs that could grow at will, any doubts fell silent. All of the leaders were intimidated, many of them frightened and others outraged that the vampires had hidden away for so long. They argued about eradicating them because they felt inferior, but others suggested to let them continue as they had before, intending to fulfil their wishes of acknowledgment and prevent the continued bloodshed.
“You are ready,” Estrode announced four weeks after taking John in. London was being rebuilt after the fire had consumed too many homes of too many innocent people. John heard rumours that the vampire responsible for the fire had been tried and sentenced to horrible suffering and a long time in the Council’s catacombs.
“Yes. She owes her wealth to MacCafferty but she’s currently not too happy with him and her situation in general,” he explained in a low voice to avoid being overheard by the woman. “It’s highly unlikely our mark is still in the city or else she would have been nicer to her bag.”
Sherlock licked his lips to underscore his nerviness. “My master’s business proposition would require the involvement of a seasoned distributor.”
John cleared his throat. "I'm sure you will have guessed why that is by now."
The promise of money had the woman’s eyes glint with greed. Sherlock sighed mentally as she told him to fetch his master. When he did, the appreciation in John’s expression made it hard to breathe for a moment. John squared his shoulders and his soft features turned businesslike when he got up and approached the table, taking his chair over to where the vampiress was sitting.
John quelled another wave of desire, then met Victoria’s gaze straight on.
“Then I take it you will wish to return to her. However, I advise against it in your current stage. You might know the name of what you are, yet not how to live as such.” The man spared him a wry smile. “My name is Henricus Estrode, leader of the Vampire Council of England. Since your Sire seems to be absent, it is the duty of my organisation to see to your successful integration into our society.”
"Four to five – how the bloody hell were you able to figure that out?" Sterling asked from his position against the wall, uncrossing his arms with an intrigued expression.
The shot rang out – a last one, well-aimed, fired before their own grenade took the shooter out. Osmond Sacker went down, dropping to the ground in an agonised heap. Bill was at his side in an instance, certain his comrades would cover him as he worked off Osmond's uniform to see the damage.
If he really worked with MI6, then it would explain a lot but if he didn't, how did he manage?
"Let's see," Sherlock said, accepting the items from John. Their fingers did not touch, but John's throat tightened anyway.
At the age of ten, Sherlock had developed a sharp wit, a dark humour and sensitivity for his surroundings that it surprised John on many occasions. It didn’t help his growing fascination for the boy at all. He had become very protective of him, although he also cared for Mycroft when he was at home. The eldest Holmes brother had grown into a promising young man who had passed his A levels with distinction and would surely graduate to become a student at one of the most prestigious universities of the country.
During her response, John slid a proprietary hand around Sherlock’s torso and nudged him. It was faint, but decisive. Sherlock leaned back until his shoulders touched John’s chest.
“What is it you have to propose?”
“Would it be alright if I used your shower?” John asked Sherlock, watching the man getting his keys out of his trousers with somewhat shaky fingers.
"What, there’s a topic you’re not an expert in?" A teasing smile tugged at John’s mouth.
John saluted at him through the window while Sherlock ignored the man and drove the car up to the grand house entrance. Up close, the manor looked even more magnificent, the old, leaded windows reflecting the sunshine in all rainbow colours.
He avoided walking past the front seats, so neither he nor Sherlock could see Diane and her husband. The smell of death was hurting John’s nose and with tears in his eyes he ran off in the dark to the next town to call an ambulance.
That night, John had to take care of his persisting hard-on and the disturbing thoughts that invaded his mind, showing him what he could do with Sherlock if he had the intentions. He felt dirty and disgusted. As much as he liked Sherlock he couldn't let the boy find out about his attraction to him. He might be oblivious now but very soon his hyperactive brain would catch on to what was going on and then John would be very much embarrassed about Sherlock finding out.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed.
"The private chambers are this way. Go up the stairs and turn right into the long corridor," he explained, giving Sherlock a very critical once-over.
“Not one step further, young man,” Mrs Hudson chided as Sherlock tried to advance into the house. “I’ll get you a towel. These clothes won’t pass the threshold.”
He survived, as did his wife and child. John couldn’t believe his luck. Many of his friends had died or were mourning their family who had fallen victim to the illness.
"Correct."
“How come?” John asked, now just as curious as Sherlock as to what had caused this. Sherlock had theories, yet no definitive proof for any of them.
“Has anyone ever tried to kill you?” Sherlock asked now, his eyes boring into John’s.
Estrode heaved a sigh and rose from his place behind his desk where he had retreated after the latest Vampire Council meeting. The subject at hand had been the reinstatement of the city-wide feeding ban for London, since his brethren had taken to act carelessly, leaving bodies with puncture wounds in their necks behind for humans to find.
“Then put it out,” he all but snapped.
"No, he didn’t. He only said he loves the coast and from others I heard he likes to dwell in high-end Vampire clubs where he picks up women for his pleasure. I don’t know where he is now but I bet you could find him in one of those clubs that cater to the rich."
Out of the corner of his eyes John saw Sherlock moving, presumably about to approach the guards, yet before he could so much as step forward, Sterling and Trevelyan had already called out to the men, drawing their attention.
The vampiress crossed her legs and looked John square into the eyes as if she was challenging him.
“I, uh,” John started, at a loss for words. If he lied too blatantly, Sherlock would see through it immediately and start asking questions when he returned to find him gone. “I just remembered that I forgot to prepare something for my shift tomorrow. I’m afraid I won’t be able to stay.”
John wandered off by going upstairs, curious about such lavish accommodation. The corridor the butler had mentioned led to many other chambers, including one balcony overseeing the dining room. Floral patterns dominated the tapestries everywhere. The rooms were too neat for John to actually gather much important information, though the lingering scents he was able to pick up told him a little about their elusive occupant.
In many cultures of the world, people knew tales about mythical creatures, which needed blood to survive, could only live in the dark, had super-human skills and were as dangerous as the wild animals that lived in the forests or open savannah. While parents mostly told those stories to scare children into behaving, they never would have thought that at one point during history, those creatures would be revealed as non-mythical.
“Your brother decided my accommodation is abysmal, so I’m to take his spare room at Baker Street.”
“Hush, Sherlock,” John whispered soothingly to the crying child, cradling him close. “I’ll take care of you.”
“Thank you.” Estrode nodded, put a few pounds down before getting up. “Enjoy your drink, Mr Magnussen, and your stay here.”
That night, she became his first victim after she took him in to tend to his obvious wounds on his neck and arm.
His senses had become incredibly sharp through his transformation and he could hear people’s heartbeats without touching them. It would serve him well in dealing with future patients.
"So you knew that someone developed a poison that kills vampires?"
It came as a surprise to him that Sherlock had apparently pushed his resenting feelings aside for whatever reasons. Could it really be because he had realised how much it mattered to him that John was back? A sly smile spread on his lips.
“Are you sure? Does your arm hurt? I didn’t want that to happen,” John said ruefully.
John chuckled.
Giddy with happiness, John made everything possible for his wife during the nine months of pregnancy, also urging her to move back to Dulwich as the conditions for giving birth at home with the help of a midwife weren’t the best. Clean water in London had always been a problem.
Sherlock rarely showed astonishment but he gave John a look of incredulity at the mention of the banshee. John just shrugged and approached one of the white armchairs opposite the sofa. He sat down and beckoned Sherlock over, patting his knee.
As soon as he had gained access to John's old home, he had checked it for any clues and had come across an old, empty blood bag that was pushed underneath a cupboard in the dusty basement. His experiments had revealed that it was blood type A, which matched John's, and Sherlock had also found an empty sun cream bottle labelled with a brand name he had never heard of. The remnants of the lotion didn't smell like any sun cream he had ever come across.
John was only half listening. His sensitive senses had already taken in the various states of emotions filling the room, mostly anticipation, eagerness, wariness, and boredom which emanated strongly from Sherlock. Soon after naming all his ranks and a short description of his own history, Brown was joined by Estrode and Mycroft, the latter of whom had been watching from the side, clad impeccably in an ash grey, bespoke suit and wearing a poker face. He came to a halt next to Brown and let his gaze sweep over the assembled crowd, assessing them quietly before he lifted his hand and called someone forward.
Never would John have anticipated getting so much involved with this family until Mrs Hudson, his neighbour’s children’s nanny, entered his surgery one day with a two-year-old boy. That was the day he met William Sherlock Scott Holmes. He was a very shy and cute little boy at that time and he didn’t look at all like his mother with his dark brown hair, much more like his father. He had caught the measles and looked rather miserable when he was brought into the surgery. John expected him to cry and fuss when he had a look at him like other children usually did, but the boy just sat calmly on his chair and watched him like a hawk the entire time.
"These are our most important portraits," the butler explained, "showing members of the royal family from the last three decades."
Sherlock's expression must have betrayed him, for John's features immediately softened to something akin to pity – though it was not pity. John would never pity him. Empathy, maybe. One of these emotions John seemed to have aplenty, always bestowing it on others without thinking of himself first.
"I am still the only way you lot will be able to solve this before half the vampire population of Great Britain is starting to panic. And I doubt that would be a desirable outcome? After all, the humans might soon follow... if your reaction is not too late, and whoever is doing this intends to harm mortals as well, this might happen sooner than you think."
He swallowed hard and opened his trunk.
"Cleaning's boring," Sherlock declared, sounding as petulant as he did when he was younger. John's chest ached at the memory. He followed Sherlock upstairs to a second bedroom that had apparently been used as storage and would have to be tidied up for John to move in. It held a large wardrobe bursting with clothes. Sherlock rummaged through them for a moment and eventually produced something with a grin.
On many occasions, Mrs Holmes invited him on evenings when her husband had to work late. Very soon Mrs Hudson watched it with a very careful eye and Mycroft, who had always been a very clever boy, didn’t like it when his Mummy got all giggly and excited when Dr Watson came over. Little Sherlock didn’t mind at all. First he had been careful and quiet but as soon as he realised that John was a very funny and imaginative person, who liked to play with children, he started to trust him and invited him to his pretend plays.
Victor never acted on it, but he had been in love with Sherlock for quite a while, which the latter had figured out soon enough. Victor tried everything to get him back and made the huge mistake of seducing him with drugs to do so. As soon as he realised what cocaine and marijuana did to Sherlock's brain, both of them spiralled down abysmally.
"Let's find an outfit for you, then," he said, motioning to the wardrobe. Sherlock cleared his throat and finally broke his stupor. He seemed to be looking for something, judging by the focussed movements of his hands as they went through the array of clothing.
John had rarely been so nervous in his life. He had seen the exact moment Bill had pieced the clues together. He would have talked to John's superiors by now and any moment they would barge into the hospital room and take him into custody.
John sighed slowly. This was better than anything he could have hoped for. A job, a purpose, to ensure the safety of Britain. The fact that he was given no choice irked him to a great extent, yet under the circumstances he would have to swallow his pride. He nodded, earning another tight-lipped grin from the older Holmes.
Victoria swirled a curl of her hair around her finger. “I’ll let you in on that if you grant me a wish,” she said with a sly smile. “I’d like to have a sip from your pet.”
Sherlock rapidly explained in complicated words that John barely followed what he was concocting while moving about and taking notes. John’s eyes traced his smooth movements until he caught himself staring.
Everhart must have thought John to be a little younger than he actually was, for John's easy allusion to the Middle Ages left the man visibly impressed in its wake. "A dangerous time, I imagine."
"I’ll spare you the details, if all you’re doing is repeat what I said back to me like mindless children discovering the use of their mirror neurons," he grumbled. "She has at least one safe house in Brighton, one in southwest Wales, one in Oxford and one in Edinburgh. Maybe one more in London, though the residual particles on her shoe soles in combination with the remaining clothes were inconclusive.”
With a placating smile, Molly hurriedly produced her documentation Mycroft had forged for them and handed it to the man, who squinted at the paper, his lips pursed.
"Oh, beware of hubris, brother dear," Sherlock cautioned. "Whoever is doing this is clever – disguising his test run as murder-suicides took planning and an extraordinary mind. You would take care not to underestimate your opponent."
She sighed and rolled her eyes. “Victoria. And that’s all you will get,
Said informant’s name was Emily Somervell, a member of the royal family.
A shriek from downstairs jolted him from his thoughts a little while later and he flew down the stairs in fear Mrs Hudson would damage his experiment. However, it had collapsed on its own – apparently one candle had been loose and, while burning down, tipped to the side and against the curtains. Which were currently on fire along with the tree. Mrs Hudson was already wielding a fire extinguisher and ruining the remnants of Sherlock’s experiment before he could object.
"Most of her clothes were gone, also her shoes, except a few sturdier pairs. Those that remained had a mixture of residual particles on the soles – no one ever scrubs them sufficiently. Given she left those shoes behind, I assume she did not rush off to Scotland or Wales. Also, there was a picture on one of her shelves; herself next to an older man, an uncle, possibly, only the paleness of his skin doesn’t match the tan the woman is sporting. Vampire, probably. The picture was taken in front of a formation of rocks found on the outskirts of Brighton. The city matched the missing clothes and shoes. Obvious, really." Sherlock grinned, briefly glancing at John before looking out of the window again.
The car stopped and John blindly threw some cash at the driver before bounding out onto the street. Sherlock quickly followed after to catch up with the speed of the vampire.
He could already smell them from afar and although he didn’t have a heartbeat any longer and he didn’t need to breathe anymore, he felt as if his heart skipped a beat and he took an unconscious deep breath, his feet running from the carriage to the door of the small house as fast as lightning speed. Their reunion was full of tears and big hugs and John felt complete again. The bad news from London had spread quickly and Mary and Hamish had been worried that John had died while treating a patient. Now he could appease them with his presence.
He moved to Chelsea, a posh and affluent area in Central London, and bought a house in a side street of King’s Road. Gabriel also moved here, fell in love with a human woman he soon thereafter married and who gave him a child. For a decade, John’s life was dominated by routine as a local doctor until, one sunny day in 1978, a new family moved in next door.
At that moment, John's thoughts did not circle around the upcoming assignment or the spider symbol, or about whether or not his new superiors would allow him some animal blood or blood bags. No – for the first time in years his thoughts returned to a boy with messy curls and startling blue eyes and to the man he might have grown into.
"Not a lie, do not even try to deny it," Sherlock interrupted the man’s desperate attempt to cover his employer’s transgressions. "You shall allow us to inspect the portraits and leave us in peace and none of this will ever reach the press. Do we have an understanding?"
“Let me guess; you were a right twit to him?”
Sherlock returned to the small table in a corner that provided them with an overview of the tiny establishment. John had taken the chair against the wall and, after setting down their steaming mugs, Sherlock pushed the second one closer. John blinked yet before Sherlock could explain he needed to see the remaining patrons as well, his expression cleared. He had obviously caught on.
He didn't give away that he had seen it to avoid making Sherlock feel caught in the act. He probably didn't even realise it.
John’s eyebrows rose towards his hairline while the woman was ordering an Iced Caramel Latte like Sherlock had anticipated.
“I don’t think it is any of your business to judge me or him. After all, we are not judging you by the brand of your handbag or the origin of your clothes,” John replied, sitting down and gesturing Sherlock to do the same.
"You don’t have to say anything, my dear. They could be lying," he said. "Prove that you are Irene’s friends," he demanded.
Then the riots started and the world descended into chaos once more, only this time it was worse than before and in the end, John’s life was forever changed.
“Mate?” John tried again, left hand moving to the knife hidden in the pocket of his breeches.
"How about that? Could fit me." He gave Sherlock an expectant look with a small twinkle in his eyes.
Now that their mission had been explained, the meeting was adjourned and people left the conference room to go back to their daily routine. John was the only one, who hovered at the door for a moment, his sharp eyes settled on Sherlock, who had walked over to the young Miss Hooper and started a conversation with her. He could hear every word of their hushed talking even from ten metres away, a bonus that came with his nature. Well, sometimes it wasn’t always so good to hear what others had to say. Instead of listening into their conversation he was lost in his own musing, wondering whether he should try another approach with the man or if he should just leave. It was such a relief to see Sherlock again after so many years, to see what he had become but his rejection had been clear and so John decided to call it a night and go back to the quarters they had given him. They were located in this very building and just one floor up.
"Oh?"
John gave a chuckle, pushing the fingers of his left hand into the curls at Sherlock's nape, indicating whom Sherlock belonged to. "Oh, he's got the habit of changing his numbers. He's a very private man."
“Why don’t you sit down? I’ll take care of the drinks,” he offered, pleased at the surprised smile he received in return. Sherlock used the time he waited at the counter for their order to be prepared by trying to calm his pulse. He failed, obviously.
"Coming?"
"Indeed."
He closed his eyes after a while, getting very drowsy very quickly and suddenly his brain had gone offline and he was asleep in John's arms.
It was obvious that Everhart was sceptical about his story and reluctant to give John any information.
“Poorly,” Sherlock blurted. When all his companion did was nod encouragingly, he continued. “The reason is elusive, yet you did have trouble sleeping. Presumably because of the low-quality mattress in your bedsit. Another reason you rooming at Baker Street is the best course of action.”
At this point, John didn’t wonder anymore why Mycroft knew about Estrode.
"Good evening," John greeted, meeting the slanted eyes of the man. "May we share the sofa with you?"
"Which makes them vulnerable to attacks," Sherlock concluded. "Which in turn is the reason it's common in tightly-knit communities like those of these clubs – safe environment for the comedown."
"How shall we –" he started.
Only a few kilometres away in a patch of wood, John whipped around from where he was hunting in the misty grounds. As a vampire he had exceptional hearing and the crash echoed far and wide. A sense of foreboding overcame him as he sprinted through the damp grass until he reached the road. The sweet, coppery smell of human blood was strong in the air but only when he was close to the demolished car did he realise whom it belonged to.
“That does sound like him. Now, why would I provide the information you’re asking for, even if I had it?”
“You were wrong about my brother because Harry is short for Harriet,” John explained.
John noted that Emily’s hands were trembling. At least she finally understood in full how much danger her actions had brought upon her. Now they could only hope she would see reason and give them what they wanted to know.
John smirked. "No."
Sherlock got up from his chair, picked up his long coat from a nearby chair and put it on, causing his obviously bespoke shirt to stretch across his chest. The younger man went past John, pausing at the door to look back at him.
“I’m here,” he assured her. “You’ll be okay.”
Sherlock made sure his expression was free of judgement when he met John's eyes."Yes.
But Sherlock deserved better. John refused to let the first time he drank from the man be in the course of a case.
“I might.”
John's absence left a hole in Sherlock's heart. He was glad he had created a room for John in his mind palace, so whenever he felt very lonely, he went there and relived fond memories of his childhood. He felt very embarrassed about asking Mycroft to help him trace John in America and although his brother used his contacts to find John, he couldn't get any information on him. John had literally disappeared and Sherlock was now even more convinced that he was a vampire and that his fellows had helped to wipe away any trace of him. That revelation made him incredibly sad and desperate. He wondered if the new job in the States had been the real reason for his departure or if John had stayed in the United Kingdom. John had been his only friend, the only one who understood and listened to him. Why did he have to leave?
John sent a silent prayer to the heavens and nodded.
He didn’t know how much time had passed when he regained consciousness again, nor did his brain remember at that time why he was lying on the dirty ground in a backyard, rain pouring mercilessly onto his still body. John opened his eyes, shielding them against the cold water with his arm and sat up slowly to take in his surroundings.
First, Sherlock didn't feel very inclined to help him solve their problems with thefts and petty crimes but with time the cases became more interesting and as soon as Lestrade climbed up in rank, he was able to give Sherlock access to murders and crime scenes.
"Call us a cab, then. They never bloody stop for me."
"Caring is not an advantage," he had said, leaving a bitter taste in Sherlock's mouth when he thought of it.
“My name is John Watson and I’m a vampire. This is my story.”
, of course you bloody did.” John laughed quietly and the sound warmed something in Sherlock’s chest.
He administered the cut just below the wrist with the precision of a doctor and Sherlock took it only with a slight wince. Victoria only approached when John inclined his head in permission and never broke additional skin with her teeth. She lifted Sherlock’s wrist to her eager red lips, sealed them carefully around the cut and started to suck.
John settled against the car door, taking in the landscape rushing past them outside and trying to stifle the feelings curling up in his chest.
“I’m okay, John.”
"You know him well?" the vampire asked.
Sherlock met his eyes, his gaze calculating.
"Well, you’re back now."
"Be that as it may," he concluded sternly, "the Countess insists on internal oversight."
Without waiting for John's reaction, Mycroft rose and stepped through the door the men had held open for him.
The potato blight a decade later caused a great famine among the Scottish population which made work very hard for John as many people were suffering from typhus and cholera. Having faced death so many times now, he had become hard and unfeeling to get through this bad time. He didn’t socialise anymore, nor did he make friends. The only thing that got him going was caring for his patients and helping them survive.
True to his word, Sherlock lent him some clothes, and coming from him they were already twice better in quality than anything John bought for himself. Their goodbye was slightly awkward, yet John hardly cared – he was too distracted by his hunger. Leaving Sherlock that morning had him feeling bereft despite the promise of food, though John had expected nothing less.
However, something about the glint in Sherlock's eyes made John think that was just the official story. Before he got a chance to ask further, the cab came to a stop at their destination. It looked like any other ordinary Georgian terraced London house with a black door and a brass knocker. There was also a sandwich bar on its right with a red sunshade. John looked it over quickly, before following Sherlock up a staircase into a rather untidy flat.
It was obvious John was not only hinting at Miss Somervell’s uncle but also himself. From experience he knew that any vampire over three hundred years was lethal to humans. Including himself.
She bowed her head and tilted it slightly to the side, baring her throat in a show of submission. John released her and took a step back. Sherlock, who had taken off his coat and jacket, was rolling up the sleeve of his white shirt to reveal pale skin before holding out his left arm obligingly.
All too soon the doors opened, but instead of the officer John had expected, two other men entered, both dressed similar to British soldiers with subtle differences. They were meant to blend in yet did not seem to have any affiliation with John and his comrades.
Now Emily had paled visibly and she looked at her companion who was frowning at them.
Heaving a sigh, John followed.
"This is a tome on northern London earldoms, given that we are about to travel to Knebworth House in Hertfordshire. I am researching." With that he averted his gaze, training his eyes once more on the pages in front of him.
Yet all good things end sooner or later, and this case was no different. Bill had seen what happened to rorty soldiers, had treated their wounds in battle when no medic was around, had seen them cry as the life left them.
The change from the Victorian era to Imperialism also brought a change for John. Suddenly he was faced with the fact that the world was becoming bigger and England was looking for new territory. To escape boredom and routine in Scotland he joined the Armed Forces and fought in the British-Afghan-Wars, benefiting from a vampire underground organisation which provided him with false papers. He disappeared from the European continent until the outbreak of World War One.
Suddenly Sherlock realised what he must look like, the way he was leaning across the small table as if he wanted to put John under a microscope and dissect him. He gave him a crooked smile.
Nothing in Sherlock's eyes betrayed even a hint of… of anything, really. They were cold, his face closed off. John could not even determine whether or not Sherlock had figured out he was a vampire – though knowing Sherlock, he surely had. So why no scathing remark? Or was he still angry with John for leaving him that he didn't know what to say? He wouldn't hold it against him. He had every right to be angry. What had happened to the young boy who couldn't stop talking or who would tell everyone in hearing distance about his deductions?
John could only blink.
As his senses had told him there was only one human in the room – a woman he recognised from photos as Emily Somervell. Her thick, auburn hair fell in soft waves down her back, curling on her shoulders. John would have found it dubious that a woman like her would require the services of a dominatrix, yet since she preferred the company of female vampires, he could see that finding sexual partners who did not require financial compensation might prove difficult. Few vampires advertised their otherness away from specific fetish clubs. Which of course were unseemly for a countess to be spotted at.
Thank you so much for reading our story and leaving all those amazing comments. They are very much appreciated! :) Please note that the next chapter will take awhile to be updated. We're writing it now but real life has got very busy for us and sorting it has priority.
“I have seen you eat,” Hamish argued, “You have never drunk blood. Never!”
"She needn’t have said those things," he grumbled, huddling into the sofa and shuffling closer towards John without drawing attention to it.
"Look, will you at least give it a try? If it doesn’t work, we can still ignore each other," John offered exasperated.
Henricus Estrode had seen three different centuries bleed into the next. He had dealt with insurgence in the past, chastised vampires who thought themselves better than their peers, who wanted to see the world kneel at their feet.
“I must, Dale, I must.”
Molly immediately drew in on herself and John’s hackles rose.
This year Mrs Hudson had decided to put actual candles on their Christmas tree. They emanated a soft, warm light that bathed the living room and reflected off the surfaces around the room. It had looked beautiful on the morning of Christmas Day, even Sherlock had to admit that.
The undertone of ‘What is in it for me?’ was blatant. Next to Sherlock, John prolonged the moment, his eyes fixed on Victoria with a calculating look.
Before John could speak up, however, someone at the other end of the room called for silence and ordered them to take their seats. Sherlock immediately left John's side and sat down far away from him.
"Hello, Sherlock," John greeted him with a warm smile. His hair was slightly damp from a shower and he was dressed in a dark green dressing gown. "It's quite late already. Is something the matter?"
“You know you’re being rude,” he said with barely restrained anger audible in his voice.
Not that he was complaining. Quite the contrary, in fact, given how the scheme worked perfectly and only a few minutes later, the five of them entered Glenda Manor. John was appalled at how easy it was to enter a house where a member of the royal family resided but in their case he was glad they could fool the guards.
Everhart's human was watching him, Sherlock noted. Her eyes were slanted, broadcasting her mistrust loud and clear despite the electrifying touch of John's fingers against his bare skin. Feeling bold, Sherlock placed his hand on the vampire's side, just below the ribs, palm flattened to cover as much as he could. He might never get another chance again, so Sherlock mirrored the strokes he felt against his nape, drawing luxurious paths into John's skin through the almost too-thin layer of his clothing. He was so captivated by the sensation that he almost missed when Everhart spoke again.
“What’s your plan?” he whispered so quietly that Sherlock had to strain his ears. “I’d suggest I walk over to her first, chat with her for a moment and then you join us. All right? Don’t take it personally but I really don’t want you to scare her away with your charming attitude,” he said, a teasing smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
had always been Magnussen’s motto and he went about acquiring it ruthlessly. Humans thought his news agency had simply been passed from father to son for three centuries, but the Council knew better. Estrode wouldn’t go as far as to say Magnussen had them under his control, but it was a precarious situation with a very fine balance.
"Maybe you should check?" Sherlock suggested, his face unreadable.
Sherlock nodded and John bade a quick escape. Their first priority was finding MacCafferty, and if John stayed in the room with the other man, his distracting thoughts would only grow in intensity.
Emily nodded, though her eyes had the faraway look of someone whose thoughts had strayed. John exchanged the necessary contact information with the woman and her uncle, yet once he had finished, Sherlock had already left the room.
“I see you,” John told her, grasping her hand and squeezing it gently.
“Remind me never to save your life again, then, mate.” John did it nonetheless, if for no other reason than healing wounds would itch in a rather annoying manner and he did not intent to subject his new-found friend to such discomfort.
With every day that passed he felt their connection growing stronger. He wrote Estrode about the developments, worried about the strong attachment that was blooming in him for the boy. He couldn’t help but wonder how far it would progress – would he fall in love with the boy? Would he start lusting after him?
Irene Adler was a legend amongst vampires. Not as old as John himself, yet experienced nonetheless, she was famous for the services she provided to humans. Apparently being dominated was a common sexual preference, yet being dominated by a vampire who could kill you without exerting too much effort seemed to add to the thrill substantially.
John surveyed the wall, eyes gliding across the pictures as he processed the new information. If MacCafferty was as addicted as the Countess made it sound, they needed to gain access to one of these communities and look for him as insiders.
"We are establishing a special operation unit that will investigate the killings and trace the perpetrators. Synthesising such a toxin requires funds and high-end equipment – I doubt uncovering the culprits shall be too difficult."
“Not my intention, John. I wouldn’t want to kill you.”
“Of course you noticed her eyes change,” John said with a sad smile, “Vampires can go without blood for about two weeks. Cherry, apple or beetroot juice which contain high amounts of iron and vitamin C can only tide us over a little, that’s why many of us get their hands on bloodbags or fresh blood. The longer we go without it, the darker our eyes become. So, going by the colour of our eyes you can also see how hungry and dangerous we are. Well, and a banshee is a spirit. They make a horrible screeching or keening sound to signal the death of a family member or loved one. But never mind that. Humans rarely see or hear them,” John continued. “That place she named. Sean’s location. Are you familiar with it?”
The shock of the realisation made him jump to his feet, staring with wide eyes at the man amidst them. Blond, with chiselled features and radiating strength and authority, he stood only a bit taller than John. The stranger took in the scene before his eyes before he turned his attention back to John.
"For our cover story."
Sherlock swallowed again, shifting his stance. The obvious discomfort in his expression gave John pause. He cursed himself – he couldn’t imagine how harrowing the experience must have been for the detective.
London was already a buzzing metropolis at that time. It was much different to Edinburgh or Glasgow and gave John the feeling he could start a new life here. His bad memories of losing his wife and child were moving into the background now, making room for something incredibly new.
“Mr Magnussen.”
Judging by the light that penetrated the thick rainclouds covering the sky, he guessed it must be early afternoon and so he ran along the path in search of people and houses he was familiar with. He only met destroyed homes but not a soul. Everything was burned to the ground, the smell of burned flesh and wood biting into his nose.
“Quite surprising to see such an unasuming man like you with such a donor. He must be quite new, considering his manners and the lack of a mark on him,” the woman said boldly.
"You haven’t changed since I left. Still a show-off and even more brilliant in your deductions," he said with a smile, although his thoughts were sad.
By the age of fourteen he had come to the conclusion that John either owned some medication or cream that made him look like thirty-eight or that he hid a much darker secret.
"How come?" John wondered, shifting a bit to grant Sherlock better access to his person.
Eventually, John straightened. "All right. Kensington, he said?"
"Please excuse my companion. He hasn’t been graced with good manners," he said, lifting an eyebrow at Sherlock. "We’re sorry for the unexpected visit but we have a good reason. We are good acquaintances of Irene Adler and she has been very much worried about you, too, after several vampires have been killed rather cruelly in London. I guess that was the reason why you went into hiding, Countess."
It was like a dam had broken after that. Whenever Diane and John could make the time, they would meet up. They didn’t lie together every time; sometimes they merely enjoyed each other’s company. Before long John knew he had fallen for this woman just as fiercely as he had for Mary in her time.
John didn’t have to be told twice.
John leaned slightly across the table, looking Sherlock directly in the eye. The younger man shivered imperceptively under his probing gaze and kept his face blank as he nodded. John took another moment to decide, but eventually he tilted his head in the direction of their mark.
Intrigued, he sought an open door, discovering it around the corner, hidden from the main hallway. John advanced slowly, concentrating on his surroundings just in case whatever had lit the lamp wasn’t friendly.
"Why?”
"I am."
It took John a moment, but when he caught on, he couldn’t help the smile that blossomed on his face.
Time seemed to be flying by. John had feared the day when his son would die which happened at the age of thirty-eight in 1696. It was normal at that time to die so early, after all John had lost his parents at the age of fourteen but it still hurt John to see his child die. He attended the burial in the shade of a tree to stay away from his family who would just stare at him. And they would have good reason for it. He hadn’t aged a single bit and still looked young and healthy. A deep, hollow ache settled in his chest after leaving the graveyard. Now he didn’t have anybody anymore.
In the end, however, Victoria withdrew, sealing the cut with her saliva. John placed a possessive hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, who quickly cleaned his skin with a tissue from his trouser pocket and rolled down his sleeve.
"Well. I’ve become better in the last few years. Had a lot of practice."
“Hello, John. You should have accounted for traffic.”
John glanced at Sterling on his right who produced said papers and gracefully handed them over to the guard, even if he had to reach between the driver’s seat and the frame of the car.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, giving no other indication of his thoughts on the matter. "This does not seem to frighten you."
“Hamish.” John’s voice was stern, then, and like the good son he was, Hamish dropped the issue, lending them a hand with slumped shoulders.
John’s eyes were still burning, his limbs tired as he returned to Mary and Hamish on Monday morning, the sky full of smoke from the greatest fire he had ever seen.
The countess exchanged a lingering look with her uncle, apparently reaching a decision as she visibly braced herself, squaring her shoulders and taking a deep breath.
The other man's answering nod was nothing but a twitch of the head and Sherlock felt worry spread through his chest. He shifted closer and covered John's hand that was still on his arm with his own. As their eyes met, Sherlock almost jerked back at the naked hunger he saw but thankfully caught himself at the last moment.
“You don’t die in the sun, do you?” he asked.
"What are you reading?" John asked in a light-hearted tone.
Still, John was not prepared for this. Even less so when Sherlock started to move closer, his long legs carrying him across the room quickly. He seemed to be keeping his expression forcefully blank.
He flinched back as if scolded, glad that Sherlock was too busy grumbling complaints at having to get clean. John stood, frozen, in the room until Mrs Hudson’s return jostled him back to reality.
“So, how long ‘till I get my kitchen back?” John wondered, hoping against the odds that Sherlock might actually answer.
He had heard the story before, when Adler had come to him two weeks ago, telling him about one of her clients who had boasted about knowing someone who was in contact with someone called Moriarty alias "The Spider", he was feared amongst the criminal underbelly of Europe, with a reputation of allowing no room for betrayal. All vampires killed had gone a step too far, as Adler’s informant had explained. They had fed information to the wrong people, believing they would escape the consequences unscathed. Moriarty chose his followers himself and neither allowed boasting to others nor giving away what he planned.
John arrived at lunchtime with a small duffel bag and nothing else. Sherlock had always wondered where all the possessions had gone that John had owned many years ago in his house but he reckoned he had put them into storage. Eagerly he ran up the stairs to show John his new room which looked brighter and more inviting than his bedsit ever had.
"Sherlock’s right," John said, slipping into the conversation. "It’s already afternoon and this place is large. It’ll take some time to cover it all. We don’t want our only lead to get away."
Once downstairs he took a moment to lean his forehead against the nearest wall and released the groan that had been building up in his throat. To think he was about to spend his foreseeable nights parading Sherlock around in fetish clubs… John swallowed. He already felt his rather cold blood getting hotter.
He didn’t answer. John’s response was obvious and he knew a man of Mycroft’s intellect was capable of figuring that out. John’s calm demeanour was certainly giving it away.
Slightly reluctant, Sherlock put his mug on the coffee table and shifted closer still when John opened his arms tentatively. He closed them around Sherlock's shoulders as he huddled into the man's side. The warmth in his chest was blossoming. The sensation was strange, foreign to Sherlock but somehow familiar as well. It was pleasant and Sherlock was under no delusion that this was only the case because the person hugging him was John. Mrs Hudson's hugs never felt like that. Unfortunately, he couldn’t remember what it had felt like when his mother hugged him. He had been too small to remember.
"We are here to question you in the context of several murders," John obeyed hurriedly, fearing that Sherlock might lead with an insulting deduction and ruin every chance of making the lady cooperate.
“I could just leave you with no information. After all,
John was very much surprised. His sister was a vampire? So his fears that his own fate had met her were confirmed. He needed to see her immediately. After all he hadn’t seen her for centuries and obviously one thing hadn’t changed. She was still someone who got herself easily into trouble.
William fled the room so fast a human eye wouldn’t have been able to follow his exit.
“Be careful,” Mary whispered in his ear as he pulled her into a tight embrace.
John just rolled his eyes and disappeared with Sherlock behind a set of double doors at the end of the staircase. It was eerily quiet in the corridor they entered beyond. John’s sensitive hearing only picked up on the summer birds singing outside and some distant voices of the tourists in the gardens. There were no footsteps or voices from the residents of the house to be heard. Could it possibly be that vampires apart from Miss Somervell’s uncle were living here?
“We were informed you have been in close contact to Sean MacCafferty. He disappeared during an important deal with me and some colleagues and I are trying to find him. Can you tell us anything about him?”
Salvation came two days later, during which time John had barely slept or eaten. It was a letter from Estrode, written in urgent hand, informing him that his sister had been sighted in South America.
Amidst the pile of heavy envelopes Estrode recognised the handwriting of Dr John Watson. They had kept in touch, so Estrode was aware of the untimely death of both the man’s wife and his daughter, whose vampire genes had not saved her from typhus in the end. John never wrote to simply keep in touch, though, and Estrode’s curiosity peaked.
It was shortly before his fifteenth birthday; Christmas was already over, when Sherlock showed up late on John's doorstep. It was snowing lightly, the white flakes catching the light of the streetlamps while clinging to Sherlock's brown curls and blue coat.
Especially the manner in which John talked about the mother, Diane Holmes, caught Estrode’s attention. She seemed to be beautiful, intelligent and an all-around perfect woman. John seemed happier with her in his life than he had been for decades, if not centuries.
"Mrs Hudson was quite angry," Sherlock finished, gripping his mug tighter while he stared into the amber liquid, a shade only John was able to make and which was always Sherlock's favourite taste.
There was a moment of hesitation and John feared Sherlock would not want to divulge the information, but the detective’s lips twitched then, his eyes sparkling a bit, and John knew he had him.
As a midwife, his spouse Mary was always at risk of falling ill. Not many people could afford to see a physician and midwives were trained in the art of healing, so she tended to more than just pregnant women. At least their son Hamish was safe – a neighbouring carpenter accepted him as his apprentice when he was old enough, and John doubted any father was prouder than he was of his twelve-year-old son.
Sherlock's gaze found the person John had pointed out immediately, cataloguing everything he could in the blink of an eye. Objectively speaking, the man was handsome, with sharp cheekbones, dark hair, and a slender build which the dark colour of his wardrobe only accentuated. Intricate accessories gave him an air of eccentricity, and his movements were energetic, almost as if he was riding a high.
John lost track of time as he was crouched next to the woman’s drained body. He only looked up when he caught a sound in the distance, unnaturally far away yet still reaching his ears.
Their affair went on unnoticed for a whole year, very often at John’s house but then they got careless and continued secret kisses at Mrs Holmes’ house too.
The one most at risk had always been John, seeing as he was a practising physician. His service in the Second Civil War taught him many things, first and foremost his passion for medicine. He didn’t have the money to attend university; instead a soldier whose life he had saved got him in touch with Edward Bowker, a progressive doctor in London. Bowker had studied in Italy under Sanctorius, who invented something called a thermometer and a weighing machine.
"That was," John muttered, "amazing. Bloody amazing."
"It is dangerous, I take it?"
His training with Estrode helped John to be an “invisible” vampire. Although his appetite had lessened – Mary noticed immediately that he didn’t tuck into his food anymore – he could hide that he was hunting rabbits and foxes during the early hours, pretending he needed to go for a walk while everything was still quiet.
The corners of the man’s mouth quirked upwards. “A healer. You must be so angry with yourself.”
“Don’t know,” John said, taking a slow sip from his hot chocolate. “It’s always been like that. Vampires have feared it for centuries. As far as I know, a human found out about it long, long ago when he had to defend his family from a vampire.”
“I will do no such thing,” Estrode growled, baring his fangs, which was something he very rarely did when it came to politics simply because it was an unfair intimidation technique. Estrode was older than Dale, considerably so. It was a biological imperative to bow to your superiors for a vampire.
It took them more than ninety minutes to reach one of the most popular towns at the south coast of Britain, also known as London-by-Sea which reflected its popularity with Londoners.
After that, there was nothing left in London for John and his son but painful memories, so they left and settled down in a quiet town in Scotland where his family came from originally.
Nothing that Sherlock stumbled across could hold his interest, let alone fill the hole again that had been reopened. Sherlock even closed himself off from the only friend he had made at university. He had finished boarding school with distinction, enabling him to study forensics and chemistry, something that had always fascinated him. His incredible skill of deduction, though, chased most people away, leaving only those who wanted to tease him or felt fascinated enough to try to befriend or date him.
"Baker Street? Really? You can afford a flat in Marylebone? A one-bedroom flat must be more than two thousand quid a month," John said in awe, wondering what kind of profession Sherlock was pursuing.
Most importantly, they taught John how to blend in, to use tricks to hide his true nature. He became versed at hunting animals, draining rats, cats and dogs rather than humans. John thought it was disgusting and was glad when he learnt that he could also sustain his energy by eating bread, fruits and drinking water as long as it wasn’t too much.
John didn’t doubt his words, expecting that they wouldn’t be treated with kid gloves. From his tussle he knew how strong this vampire was. He was matching John in strength which meant that he was at least three hundred years old. He wondered how old the other vampires were that resided in the house. If they were called to give a helping hand in their current situation, then John and Sherlock wouldn’t stand a chance. There was only one way to keep the peace.
John pulled up the zip of the jacket and nodded at his reflection while combing his fringe back. He looked like someone who loved riding a motorbike. Striking, rough and adventurous.
"Why aren't you contacting him via text message or calling him if you've been partners?" he asked, his eyes shifting to Sherlock in curiosity.
“John,” she rasped in wonder as her eyes found him.
A great number of casualties attributed to the Black Death had indeed fallen prey to vampires. Diseases didn’t affect their kind, which made them conspicuous in times of suffering. Additionally with so many people dying, the Council had to reduce the number of allowed kills, or else there would have been no London left to feed off.
John hissed and bared his teeth, his face darkening dangerously and his hand around Sherlock’s waist tightening. Sherlock tensed against his hand yet only for a moment. Then his body relaxed in the most delicious way.
The words, “I am a vampire” were the easy part, as it turned out. Convincing his son of their truth was more of an obstacle.
“Drink it, drink it and you shall never fear death,” was the last thing John heard before darkness embraced him.
John didn’t look back. Estrode had allowed him to contact him in the future, yet other than that John had no intention of returning. All he wanted was to see his wife and son again, so he squared his shoulders and left the Council, disappearing into the labyrinth of London’s streets.
Next to the agent, Molly giggled. John decided to bite his tongue and not allow himself to be riled up. As if on cue, a magnificent Elizabethan manor house came into view.
The picture and the accompanying information proved what Estrode had long since suspected: Harriet Watson, after years of absence, had reappeared in England just in time for the invention of designer drugs for vampires. Whole nests of addicts existed throughout the country and the Council did their best to find them and clean them out if they were causing trouble. If not, they were left alone. Vampires who spend their immortality completely removed from reality in a haze of drugs, willing humans and sex didn’t hurt anyone and the Council really had better things to do.
