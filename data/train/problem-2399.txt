The loneliness was wearing him down. It was something he had not considered when embarking upon this mission. That to be alone for so long after having had the best two years of his life with a friend. Well, it was becoming unbearable. It was almost Christmas. Two years ago, he had been playing carols at 221b. John, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, Molly... all there and he was so far from being alone.
Sherlock turned to look at the man beside, his gaze hungry. Since the night in the sheet with the candy canes, experimentation with other seasonal decorations had become a little game. Santa showing Rudolph how to behave had thankfully just finished when their 'not-housekeeper' arrived with another tray of mince pies.
"If I wanted judgement, I'd have contacted my brother and asked for his private health providers. I thought I was safe with the NHS." He huffed. "And no. It was an experiment."
"Surely that's affected your effectiveness though. I mean, I could just choose happy memories and what would I learn from that?"
"A drink? With eggs in it?" He pulled a face and I couldn't help but laugh.
"Daddy?"
"Why should I have to prove it? Just believe me!" Victor barked out a harsh laugh and turned away.
The fire crackled in the grate, a warm, orange glow cast over the room. It was smaller than Baker Street. Cosy, with wooden floors covered in rugs, a lower ceiling with exposed wooden beams, rough plaster on the walls and thick curtains helping to keep the heat in. The wind whistled outside, snow blowing against the windows with the promise of a beautiful, white, crisp covering in the morning.
"You won't have. I made up the job title. I'm the only one in the world."
"Better. I knew you had it in you, boy. Well, it's more something I did to Mycroft and he passed it on. But unfortunately, your wiring" at this he gestured to Sherlock's head, "interpreted it in a very literal way. Mycroft has nothing to worry about, he was always the smartest of you both, but you? Well, you, my boy, are a different matter." Rudy walked over to Sherlock, passing through one of the other dining chairs, to stand right in front of him. "You are going to be visited by three of my colleagues. The first will call at midnight then it will be one every two hours. We used to rush it through every hour but the powers that be decided, after looking at the data, that it might be better to give you a bit of a rest between each visitation." Sherlock was rarely confused so this feeling was most unwelcome and highly disturbing.
John kept an eye out for the thief, trying to catch the moment when the lanky git would strike and ten would become nine. It was when six was becoming five that he finally caught him. And oh! He would never get over the sight.
"Well, today's the 24th." It hadn't yet answered his question. "Oh Sherlock! You've deleted Christmas! Again!" He swatted his arm with the duster. "Tomorrow, you silly man." He dashed towards the door, grabbed his wallet, coat and keys. "Good luck!" She called after him as he bolted down the stairs.
"That's not what people normally say." The patient looked shy and sad. "They usually tell me to piss off." John laughed.
Yes. He had done well. Now, looking at Greg next to him, it was time for a break.
I am trying to formulate an appropriate rebuttal when Mary continues: “I am ready to make an agreement.”
“John! What a coincidence! So nice to see you!”

most of the time.”
Molly, good, reliable Molly had perfectly understood his anxious order and had driven the limo not to the arranged official pick-up point but rather to the spot just outside one of the less visible emergency exits, one that only her and John knew about. Irene was left behind – she was pissed off at him, but he could live with that.
John decides to make himself scarce – despite burning with curiosity, he’s not in a mood to watch this meeting between exes. As he retreats into the landing, Sherlock shouts for him.
sleep, Dr Watson, inelegant grammar,” Sherlock retorts.
John blinks as if waking up from a dream and smiles sadly at him. “Yeah, no. Well…” He clears his throat, looking around the room, then again at Sherlock. He’s about to say something, Sherlock can sense it, but somehow the words don’t seem to come easily.
, my brave soldier is
And Sally? She doesn’t call Sherlock ‘freak’ or ‘psychopath’ any longer. She hardly even interacts with him. And while this shouldn’t surprise Greg, the fact is this avoidance seems to have more something to do with whatever is gnawing at her and less with her not wanting to have anything to do with Sherlock in the first place.
“Of course. Got some discreet contacts that helped me with that. Old friends.” Greg waggles his eyebrows in a knowing way. “There’s more, but some were traced back to overeager fans that were easily quieted with a few choice words. Harmless people, really. Those in the envelope are the ones that could not be traced. Whoever sent them knew what they were doing.”
John walks out of the bedroom, and calls Irene. She answers after the first tone.
It all coalesces into one bright spot in Sherlock’s mind.
John plants himself on an armchair right outside Sherlock’s bedroom door. He curses the lumpy cushion but decides it will help him stay awake. Exhaustion takes its toll though, and soon he falls into a fitful sleep, the sounds of the Glasgow night meshing with diffuse images of Afghanistan, the Mayan, and a deep, sultry voice calling his name.

Weeks pass; the springtime attempts to melt into warm summer days. Sherlock checks on his bees – this will be a good harvest, and he should be proud of the work he invested a year ago on these beehives. The previous year had been tumultuous: his need to get away from everything and everybody had almost driven him back to his seven percent solution. But he resisted, and a glance at properties for sale on the countryside planted an idea in his head. Two months later, he was halfway through the renovations on the almost-derelict cottage – enough to make it liveable. Enough to prompt him to move on a cold late March day. The rest of the year was filled with a lot of trial and error on the workings of living in the countryside, the nearest neighbour a good two kilometres away and the town a little further than that. He threw himself into this new project, grabbed on to it as a lifeline, focused his intellect on learning everything about beekeeping, dug up weeds and wild bushes and started growing his own vegetables. He didn’t harvest any honey last year, let the bees have it to consolidate the colonies, and now here is the payoff in the shape of a thick layer of amber goodness, well on its way to being fully capped. He thinks he will harvest soon, and let the hives fill again with fresh summer honey, risk a second, late harvest this year.
And when Sherlock's eyes, bright with determination and passion, meet John's tender gaze, he squeezes the small ring box in his pocket with the relief of a man who has finally come home.
“It’s an improvement over
Sarah whispers the question, a warm, gentle voice in the cool air of the consulting room. She prods John’s left hand with careful fingers, systematic movements searching for broken bones.
“For back pain? Not likely. Get me some morphine instead, I’ll be fine in the morning.”
Sherlock sighs. He has missed John like a missing limb, a phantom presence existing only in his mind for over two years. And now that Sherlock is back, and John is real and
“What happened in that room?” John asks with trepidation. He doesn’t really want to know but there’s no choice now, is there?
The train back to London is mostly spent in quiet contemplation at the events around Baskerville. Sherlock is not the sort of man to dwell on the past, but he needs to process what happened in this head. The thrill of solving the puzzle still glows warm in his chest.
There is a lot of dried-in blood on John’s trousers, but he doesn’t care about it right now. After his explosion of fury at John’s aggressor, Sherlock had been eerily quiet on the trip back to Baker Street. John felt his silence, heavy with unspoken emotion, the sort Sherlock cannot quite process. Or doesn’t want to.
“I’m sure I’d think of something else.” John watches Sherlock’s pupils dilate and his Adam’s apple bob up and down with a dry gulp. He encircles Sherlock’s wrist with his left hand, letting his fingers brush the inside of his wrist. Sherlock’s grip on the Sig slackens and his eyes glaze over; John removes the gun with his right hand, tucking it behind his back in one swift movement, his left hand sensing a strong, fast pulse. The movement brings them closer, and Sherlock releases a shuddering breath.
them. John presents Sherlock with a caddy of Fortnum and Mason’s Afternoon Blend, which they premiere at teatime with homemade shortbread biscuits sent by Mrs Hudson. Sherlock helps John assemble a highchair for Rosie’s mealtimes, and they discuss a schedule for the week.
He holds the case straight and opens it again, brushes his fingers over the two rings lying on the satin lining. Palladium, a soft brushed finish, a small diamond well-embedded to not catch on gloves and such.
What if.
“Swear to god, I have no idea how John puts up with all his shenanigans.” Greg shakes his head and takes another biscuit. Some more dull banging echoes through the house. “Is he hammering the walls or something?”

Sherlock slumps into the opposite chair. Mycroft’s library is compact and intimate, its walls covered in overfilled bookshelves, just enough space for the armchairs and a coffee table in front of the hearth. It’s the smallest room of Mycroft’s otherwise spacious townhouse but also his favourite, the place he retreats to when he wants a quiet evening in having a book (or some hundreds) for company. Rarely, he has someone sitting opposite to him; often, that person is Sherlock, and he almost never visits.
Then Sherlock had decided to catalogue his greying hair.
“Is this still about my forged suicide? How positively pedestrian.” He rolls his eyes and flashes her an insincere smirk. “But I am elated that you care.”
a study that links riding a rollercoaster with expelling stones a short time after but even the authors were cautious about their conclusions, with lots of caveats and an admittedly small population sample to work with.
The brothers exchange an amused look.
John doesn’t know either. Obviously, he can’t help with the second method but the first holds some appeal. Not that the second method isn’t appealing but… Anyway. “Just a thought, that’s all.”
Horror builds up inside John as he realizes Moriarty is removing parts of a bomb vest from a box; he recognizes them easily enough from his time in Afghanistan.
“Elementary,” and Sherlock knows he should shut up, but he can’t help it, “you have a military stance but favour one leg, suggesting you’ve been wounded in combat. Tan lines on your neck and wrists – your face and hands are tanned but not from sunbeds or holidays abroad. The pin on your lapel? The Rod of Asclepius. You’re a doctor who has been long enough in the army to get that tanned and then injured. Conclusion: an ex-army doctor. My only question is,” he raises a dramatic eyebrow, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock is a professional, and it is far from the first time an enthusiastic fan has tried to interact with him. Still, he would prefer to complete his choreography without distractions. Worse than the fan hopping onto the stage, though, is the immediate flurry of action from Irene, who is about to chase the guy away.
How many ways can you tell yourself a lie? John – the real John – thinks Sherlock is dead. The radio silence after the last blog post spoke mountains; there was nothing more of interest to tell about their life together, because that had ceased to exist. And so, Sherlock concludes that John has probably moved on, forgotten about him. Maybe Sherlock is just a fond memory, or–
“I love you.”
He slips the letter from underneath the newspapers. The envelope is greyish with old ink but looks otherwise more or less the same as it did the day it arrived. It’s not as threatening as Sherlock imagined it on that day.
John turns and punches his pillow in frustration. Great friend he is, abandoning Sherlock to his sorrow. He sits up and forces himself to untangle the emotions that have balled up inside him, separate them into threads and identify them one by one.
“Where’s Molly?”
His client falls back in the car with a determined push. There is no time to think, only react; and yet, it all happens in slow motion, like a dream where his feet are stuck in the mud while he tries to run, run, run.
Sherlock pretends to be engrossed in his phone, scrolling through whichever news site he distractedly thumbs on. It gives him the ideal cover to sneak glances up to John, who is sitting in his chair, quietly reading the newspaper. Or rather, staring at a fixed point on a random page – not reading.
“Hey, Sherlock.” He sounds surprised but pleased. In the background, Rosie makes splashing sounds. Ah, bath time.
Sherlock’s voice is flat and cold. He slams down the knife into an innocent pear, cleaving it neatly in two halves.
“Sherlock–”
“The bug was Mycroft. The fool.” Sherlock softens his last words – he can’t bring himself to loathe his brother. Not like this, not now.
John snaps his mouth shut. Opens it again. Shuts it. And finally manages to blurt, “Huh?”
doing here?
John gapes at him.
“You don’t eat enough
— the options. What shocks Mycroft is that he would choose the least logical of them. “Sherlock…”
Surprisingly enough, Sherlock does not protest and he sits down while John fetches more pills and water. As John walks downstairs and fills a glass with tap water, the last wisps of sleep leave him. He considers Sherlock’s symptoms, their onset and evolution. Sherlock reacts positively to NSAIDs, but the pain is still intense; fresh blood in his urine, unilateral, cramping pain, no pyrexia… A few possible diagnoses shuffle through his brain, and he tries to hope for the least complicated one.
“Yeah, yesterday too,” John sighs.
“We’re both consenting adults–”
Sherlock shivers, in disgust or dread, and mumbles something about calling St Mary’s when he’s finished with the experiment.
He stands up and faces Sally. The moment stretches in silence as they glare at each other. “And you, Detective Sergeant, are a hypocrite.”
“John Watson!” Mrs Hudson is now proper scandalised, beetroot-red and more than a little bit miffed. “Really, what kind of proposition is that! At my age!” In defiance of her troublesome hip, she skitters down the staircase as fast as she can manage.
“I brought these for you.” Oh, John. He presents me with a lovely bouquet of carefully arranged flowers, some of which I cannot even identify. “It took me a while to get this because I wanted exotic flowers.” He blushes.
“You remembered. I… I thought, maybe…” I am
These are not “other circumstances”.
. Is tonight a consequence of them being cooped up in close quarters for too long? Sherlock had admitted he wanted to go out with John because he could not do so with anyone else. Is this all that there is to it, then?
“Indeed.”
Unacceptable.
The journey northward is long but uneventful. Somewhere north of Glasgow, where the lowlands slowly turn into highlands, Molly checks with John where she’ll need to turn for their destination. After a good half hour of driving on an impossibly narrow road, Molly rolls the car to a stop in front of a wooden house.
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow and gestures a ‘go on’ with a hand flap, curiosity winning over arctic disdain.
“I don’t want to leave you alone,” Sherlock whines.
Except...he never got a key for the show bedroom he visited on his first day, the one where there had been a break-in. This hasn't been an issue, as the room is permanently closed since it’s not in use. Victor has a key.
Sally knows anything she says right now will only be a feeble attempt to fill the void of silence between them. She starts retreating slowly to the exit, trying to find some anger again in her to justify her leaving Sherlock to wallow in his misery. Instead, that small nugget makes itself noticed again, regret gnawing at her. Oscillating between giving in to her pride or her empathy, she takes a moment too long, long enough to witness something she never thought she would witness:
Greg’s thoughts whirl around in his head as he takes one last look at the present crime scene: his team is wrapping things up, Sally structuring work with her usual efficiency, and Sherlock is long gone, having abandoned the place after spouting a stream of deductions and declaring any other sort of follow-up work as ‘insufferably boring’. Perhaps this is why Sally, who had been evidently subdued while Sherlock is there, seems to be a bit lighter, as if that invisible weight had lifted somewhat.
It’s not like James. It’s just not.

John can feel his heart drumming in his chest and wonders briefly if the systole-diastole dance is visible on the outside. A ridiculous notion, for sure, but the uncertainty is there nevertheless. He cannot blame his fast heartbeats on the jogging now.
It takes him a long while to compose a message he is happy with.

Sherlock tilts his head sideways, an adorable small frown of confusion crinkling on the bridge of his nose. Oh, how John wants to kiss that very spot. He tries not to stare.
“So sorry to interrupt your evening like this, but I do need your help. We’re having a little meeting with a common friend in a short while.” Moriarty is gleeful, and John fights a new wave of nausea. A common friend? “He isn’t really expecting you — in fact, he waited until you left to book a rendezvous with me. Such a romantic!” Moriarty leans closer, so close John can feel his exhaled venom. “And while I would love to have a little tête-à-tête with him alone, I do think he’ll be
Sitting at the kitchen island with a mug of steaming tea, John stiffens at the sound of his front door slamming open against the wall, but waits as he recognises Irene’s steps stalking her way and stopping right behind him just before he slides off his stool. He avoids her fist and sweeps a foot under her legs, making her fall flat on the floor with an ‘oof.’ But Irene is agile and enraged, so she is back on her feet before John can hold her down, and slaps him. John blocks a second slap with a ferocious grip on her right wrist, then on her left as she tries to hit him with her free hand. They have a stand-off for a few brief moments, eyes locked; Irene’s are burning in anger.
John slides his hand up and down Sherlock’s arm in a hopefully comforting way. To his relief, Sherlock leans into the soothing touch and relaxes minutely. “I do not want to talk about it.”
The attacker turned out to be the disgruntled father of one of the young recruits killed under Sholto’s last mission in Afghanistan. Usually, the weapons were verbal – bitter words, threatening letters, ranting blog posts from various family members and friends weighed down by anger and grief, wanting an outlet to place blame and seek closure. This, though – this had been the act of a desperate man. One who had nothing left to lose when all that he considered precious in life had already been lost in a pool of blood and gore in a country far, far away.
Sherlock looks back at him, confusion written all over his face. “That is the whole purpose of the severed hand, John, why would I throw it away?” He proceeds to remove his coat and scarf.
“Careful; the safety’s on but it’s loaded.”
. As if there was something worthy of celebration. As he sat in that
“I believe you,” Sherlock says. “I had no idea about him being that young either. He did act mature enough.” He shrugs – it’s not like he had interacted that much with Mycroft’s lover. Between his hard work to climb the career ladder and the effort to keep clean after that period with the cocaine –
Mycroft recovers enough in the following days to bicker with his brother about his constant presence at his bedside. No longer in critical condition, Mycroft has been moved from the ICU to another ward, and Sherlock fusses.
“Do you think this Moriarty guy tried to, um…kill your brother because he told us about him?”
A week passes, then another. There had been a phone call with the results from the CT scan: a five-millimetre distal stone, close to the bladder, had been identified as the culprit, and a referral sent to urology at St Mary’s. There had been fortunately no new crippling pain attacks, but it is obvious Sherlock is not comfortable. From the little John can pull out of him, he understands Sherlock has basically pain every time he urinates, and that most days there is spasmodic pain, although manageable with NSAIDs. John keeps an eye on how much and how often Sherlock takes them, and they develop a habit of not leaving home without painkillers. He places glasses of water and cups of tea near Sherlock and makes sure he drinks them.
Sherlock breathes away the dread that had threatened to cripple him. “I look forward to your call later, then.”

John doing here?
John looks up from his hands with red-rimmed eyes and an expression of amazement. Again, he can’t quite find the words.
John lays a gentle hand on her bicep. “Take a seat by the fire; I’ll put the kettle on.” Ellie hesitates between the sleek dark leather armchair and the cushy red one but decides for the latter when Sherlock slides into the first. She sinks into the soft cushions and stretches her tired legs towards the hearth.
“Richard Brook. Actor and producer. He’s not mainstream so it doesn’t surprise me if you haven’t heard of him before,” Mary replies.
“Not hard at all, I guess.” She shrugs and scratches the bandage on her hand. John notices it’s a fresh one – Molly is taking good care of her injury.
Sherlock is acutely aware that his next words shape a future. They should not rest in limbo as those resting on a sheet of paper inside a sealed envelope.
John takes a deep breath and, before he regrets it, continues, “You’ll go stir-crazy if you’re locked in all day here, I get it. I…Let’s…Yes. That. Go out. Together.”
The snow continued to fall silently on Baker Street.
John, who had been silent in his armchair the whole time while Greg tried to convince Sherlock to attend the press conference, lightened immediately the mood. “Well, Greg,” he quipped, with a half-smile, “I hope you have a speech prepared. Or do you really want him,” he gives a short jerk of his chin towards Sherlock, “to declare whatever he wants in front of the nation’s media?”
Greg frowns puzzled at her. “You okay, Mrs Hudson? You seem a bit, I don’t know. Flustered?”
territory.” Sherlock will not allow John to interrupt him now. “My corner of the world. A small space I carved for myself. And I’m not just referring to my bees or the garden or the new paint job in the kitchen. It’s…” He shakes his head. “It’s my final attempt to move on. I suggest,” and oh how his heart constricts in his chest, “you do the same. On your own. Without having to seek some sort of redemption from me.”
The knock on the door surprises Mycroft. He had been expecting Sherlock to show up on his doorstep, but he assumed his brother would simply burst in – his usual
“I don’t,” Sherlock replies, “but this is beautiful.” He looks down at John, eyes shining and happy.
Bill returns his attention to the now empty chopping board. Sherlock picks up his tea again and takes an absentminded sip at the now lukewarm drink. He follows Molly and John’s movements as they walk back to the house.
The same Sherlock sits before John, defeated, not by a kidney stone, but by ignorance and prejudice.
“Mr Holmes.” Sherlock looks up at John, eyes flashing an unspoken question. “I think there’s been a mistake. It was nice to meet you; best of luck with…everything.” He makes an all-encompassing gesture at the room and turns to leave. From the corner of his eye, he sees Irene smirking in triumph.
He stares at the closed door, ponders how to proceed. Reminds himself that Sherlock is an adult and prickly when it comes to make decisions about his own well-being. And, well. He does have a live-in doctor.
“Maybe, uh, maybe you should tell her that you’re. You know. Gay?” John tries to wrap his mind around this sudden coming out. Is Sherlock comfortable about talking about himself like this? Did John go a step too far?
It’s a dance we both know well. There is an understanding, an unspoken agreement, born out of the ashes of the messy clean-up after Magnussen’s death. What she does not know is that the terms differ: she thinks her previous life is finally tucked away in the past, and that she is forgiven for shooting me. That I am friendly, although cold and aloof due to our past. That John has forgiven her with carefully chosen words.
Which means there is a reason. Start talking.
They finally come. The sobs. It took days but here they are, raising like violent bubbles exploding through his chest. John sinks in his chair, face on his hands, and lets the tears run, unbidden but necessary. He knows he should call Ella, get grief counselling but in the end, it all comes down to the same – the most important person in his life is gone forever and nothing will bring him back.
Sherlock is radiating smugness. “You don’t look like a bodyguard, Mr Watson.”
Soft lips, firm lips. Warmth. Sweetness. A tender touch. A gentle proximity. Not a culmination, but rather a next step. Passion, not brief and fiery but steady and glowing as embers.
“John. John. John!”
There are no distractions now. No excuses to perpetuate avoidance.
That’s lovely, but I really am very tired. How about I get something on the way home? We can go to Angelo’s some other day. My treat.
“Lestrade, it’s good to see you.”
. He has no idea there are so many letters.”
Mr Hardy, Sherlock’s tailor for many years, flutters around Sherlock as he stands wearing what will become a new navy-coloured suit. Sherlock is facing a full-length mirror, half turned away from John, perfectly still as Mr Hardy picks a loose thread here and pins a safety pin there. John stands ramrod straight at the door of the small, private fitting room. He eyes the proceedings with side glances while trying to keep his attention to what is happening outside. It shouldn’t bother him: Irene is watching the entrance of the shop from a safe distance, and Molly isn’t too far away with the car, ready for a swift escape if needed.
“Not at all. Here, let me help you.” John helps her to disrobe of her heavy coat and hangs it by the door. Ellie takes off her gloves and stuffs them in her handbag. John opens his arms in invitation, and they share a warm hug. “It’s good to see you. Our flat is upstairs; come on, you’re just in time for tea.”
“Oh? Here I am,” John says, putting on his best disarming smile and turning to check on a window latch. Locked. Good.
to cut Sherlock from his social duties!
“I can definitely provide you with what you need. I’ll throw in a personal demonstration with the purchase of a second product.”
Sherlock crumples in John’s arms.
Sherlock looks back at him with a frown. “I don’t need to run after Victor Trevor, John. My life is fulfilling as it is now. I have the work and I have–” Sherlock snaps his mouth shut.
“No, I suppose not.” This is not the time to tell Sherlock there are very good reasons to have such measures in place.
A script I wrote. A theatre I command.
With the most nonchalant expression he can muster, John replies, dead calm, “He’s alive. And that’s all I’m telling you.” He slides his gaze away from Mary only to realise Brook’s hand is now on Sherlock’s waist. And Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind this at all, as he looks quickly from Brook’s animated talk to John with an unreadable expression, then back to Brook with a widening smile.
Sherlock mouths this name in silence:
“I was considering how to make the most out of our day. We could go to the village, do some shopping for dinner, see some local sights—”
Although…
. “Perhaps more than a hand. The therapy should be… vigorous. To help, you know. Moving things along.”
There is no need for words right now. The evening slides away with an easy companionship that surprises Sherlock.
“John? John?”
“I said,” Sherlock interrupts John’s apology with clenched teeth, “

The press is gone (thank goodness), the champagne has been consumed, the guests have left.
“Morning, Sherlock. Yeah, I did,” John lies, dashing his eyes elsewhere over the bedroom, skimming over the floor.
He thinks of the bees; how unfair it would be for them to be abandoned if something happened to him. The thought sends a shudder through his body and shakes him out of his dark thoughts. He remembers the bloody letter and blames it for the downturn of his mood. He should just chuck it in the rubbish bin; why hasn’t he done so yet?
. Inside, the place is small and dimly lit; the wood-heavy decor contrasts with bright chequered tablecloths, tables adorned with small flower vases and candles. Country music plays from tired speakers, joining the soft clinking of cutlery against plates and muffled conversations. The smell of greasy food permeates the stale air. For a Tuesday evening, the restaurant is surprisingly full; John had called ahead and reserved a small table in a corner. Sherlock surveys the room in amusement while removing his blue cashmere scarf and grey coat, which John takes and hangs on a nearby peg. They sit down and accept menus from a distracted waiter.
. A glance at Sherlock reveals he is also worried at Mycroft’s reaction.
And this Sherlock standing in front of John right now is anything but a machine.
Sherlock decides they aren’t close enough, too many layers of clothes between them. He makes quick work of John’s shirt buttons, and John fumbles to undo the rest of Sherlock’s, hands bumping clumsily. John smooths his hands up on Sherlock’s chest and buries his hands under Sherlock’s shirt, slides it off his shoulders; the garment flutters to the floor in a silky whisper. Sherlock grabs John’s biceps and falls heavily on John’s bed, dragging John down with him. John releases an amused ‘oof’ as he lands on Sherlock; he braces his arms around Sherlock’s head and rubs up his body, making Sherlock gasp at the contact between naked chests. John leans down and kisses him deeply, shifting his hips to frame Sherlock’s.
John wants, he wants so much, and he can’t help but to try push the door open. He grabs Sherlock’s hand ever so gently between his own and repeats, “It matters to me.”
Ellie shakes off those darker thoughts as she senses Sherlock’s keen gaze on her again. She is suddenly exposed under his scrutiny and does not miss how he narrows his eyes just the tiniest amount. She inhales sharply and claps her hands on her thighs. “Well, boys, it’s been lovely to see you, but I better get going and rescue my sister from those pests.” As she makes a fuss of getting up and picking her handbag from the floor, Sherlock addresses her quietly. “You and John have more in common than what you think.”
"You had a few Christmases with this little chap, didn't you?"
"Mr Sigerson?" He turned to face the doctor and deductions at once flew through his mind.
Another five cases solved in twenty minutes. Tweets in the last hour – forty. God, he was good. He was on fire! After a week of nothing, of hiding in his Mind Palace, unable to deal with being all alone whilst fully awake, he threw himself back into his work.
He takes his phone out, pushes the power button. Opening a text message, he types.
"Ya know, science and stuff."
"I don't get it, John," Sherlock said as they entered the flat following a five-day-long case. "Why hang mistletoe above the victims?"
"What are you? My mother? Relax, Vic!"
"Hidden. I know what you're thinking."
"Not normally waited on by a doctor."
Silently, he made his way down to the lawn and stopped beside the swaying couple.
A record of things that were different:
"Berk. I know you're thinking that if you go for a wander, I'll think you're off to score drugs and I won't go to Harry's for Christmas."
"Yes?" "If you can find and tell me three interesting facts about snow, we'll go out and play."
"Oh! Still? Nothing yet?"
"What?"
"To another Christmas when you're a bit older. Another time and another place but one that had a huge impact on making you who you are now."
As I pace around the small, white-walled hotel room that John and I have been holed up in for the past two nights, I set aside my obsessive pondering of our current, seemingly inscrutable case, and let my mind drift.  We do this often these days, share a room. I rarely sleep on cases—and we’ve grown so comfortable in one another’s presence over the past few years that we haven’t much need for space. It’s a comfort for me to keep him close while I’m consumed by the work.  A comfort and an advantage—I think more clearly when he’s near. I told him once, years ago, that he was a conductor of light. A ridiculous turn of phrase, fuelled by my then untamed ego. Still, it’s remained true, despite everything we’ve gone through together.  He remains the most extraordinary man I’ve ever known, hiding behind a façade of mediocrity.
“She’ll come down,”  She’s known how to scoot down the steps since she was two.
“What are you asking me?”  He says, perching on the stool behind him and crossing his arms.
“Clearly,”  He looks at me where I stand carefully holding the colorful creation of a five year old, and laughs.  “That’s a good look for you, Sherlock, you should keep that.” I hold it up to Rosie, raising my eyebrows in a silent question.  She nods, giggling as I place it in my pocket, leaving its head poking out the top. John scoops her up out of her chair. “Have fun with Molly and Greg?”  He asks. Another nod. She’s used to spending time with them—with Mrs. Hudson, as well.  She’s never known a life where her father didn’t disappear at random for days at a time.  “Greg’s at work, then?”
“Bit of a prick, but he lived a notable life,”  Sherlock says, walking up beside him and casually leaning against the wall to John’s left.  Rosie has slumped against his shoulder, futilely fighting sleep.  “It’s a memoir about his time in Paris, discovering his love of writing—as well as the people he met there who’d changed his life for the better,”  John stares down at the book, carefully opening it to the first page.  A first edition hardcover, published in 1964.  “The title is in reference to a phrase originally of religious descent, meaning an observed holiday with no fixed date.  Hemingway applied it to a place, an
The phrase John types to Sherlock is straight from the song this fic was named for.  Consider it an ode to Sufjan.  <3
“Perfect,”  He rumbles.  Then his eyes widen mischievously in a way that says he’s thought of something that will amuse John quite thoroughly.  He snatches the skull from the mantle and climbs back up the ladder to shove it unceremoniously on top of the tree.  John lets out a shocked huff of laughter, absolutely bloody delighted by this sudden macabre display.  Sherlock really never ceases to surprise him with his boyish outbursts, even now.  He sits back on the sofa staring up at the man where he grins smugly from the top of the ladder.
Warmth floods through my spent body at the thought of referring to him as my husband.  Mine. Forever. I turn my head and press my lips to his neck. Kiss his salty flesh. He moans quietly beneath my tongue.  Scrape the skin with my teeth, lightly suck a bruise. Mark him as my own. Soon I will do so with a ring.
is the term her pretentious, psychotherapist sister had used when she spoke of them.  Bunch of rubbish.  They loved each other.  Relied on one another.  And now poor John is just floundering a bit.

He looks back at me, unwaveringly.  Deciding if he’ll continue.
Brow furrowed, I let my hands fall from his shoulders to rest in my own lap.
John gives Greg his own strained smile, shrugging off his jacket and slipping it onto a hook.  Molly watches Greg’s grey mop of hair retreat into the kitchen, hears him flinging open the refrigerator to fetch John a beer.  John accepts it with a nod of thanks, drinking deeply and glancing around their new flat.
“All right,”  I say, bringing my hands up to hold his head between them.  I smooth my thumbs over his cheeks, fingers gliding through his hair as I kiss him intently—heart swelling when he responds in earnest.  Mouths open, accepting—tongues gliding, palms roaming. I let myself get lost in it—the taste of him—the feel of his body against mine, of his hands on my skin.  Distantly, I hear my mobile ping from my back pocket, ignoring it to focus on the sensation of John’s tongue on my teeth. Another ping. He groans into my mouth as his fingers move down, down, into my pocket, throwing the phone to the floor.  A buzz from his mobile now. He sighs, resting his forehead against mine as we catch our breath.
I wake to the sensation of fingernails scratching lightly over my back—up and down.  Lips against my forehead, John’s breath on my skin.  “Hey,” He whispers. I haven’t opened my eyes, but I stretch a bit, settle back in beneath the weight of his arm.  “We have to go meet Molly and Greg soon,” Rosie has been staying with them again. She’d spent the night since we’d been out quite late, and Molly had suggested we meet them for brunch this morning to retrieve her and catch up.  I groan. “Shower?” He asks. At this, my eyes flutter open. He’s staring back at me, a slight grin on his face. We haven’t showered together, but that is clearly what he’s suggesting. Haven’t even seen each other’s bodies in their entirety, yet.  John flings off the duvet, rolls out of bed and heads to the loo. I follow. Obviously.

I slide into John’s (old) bed, tuck myself right up behind him.  He stirs, then groans lightly. Remains still for a moment and then slowly turns to face me.  “I’m sorry, John,” It’s just a whisper. I’m afraid he’ll throw me out if I say anything more.  He looks at me strangely, then. His eyes look almost sad in the darkness of his (old) bedroom.
“Not going to ask why you’ve got that bloody thing on you,” John grumbles, eyes following Sherlock’s fingers to his pocket to try and catch a glimpse of a pack of Benson & Hedges.  He won’t find one.  Sherlock hasn’t smoked once since John moved back home.
“Yes, all right.  I do think it’s a good idea.”
She’d thought they were just flatmates.  Yeah, she’d read the blog—knew full well that he’d managed to become infatuated with the infuriating bastard.  It was no secret that the man was a source of excitement for her battered and bored brother.  He’d shown up in his life at a crucial juncture and pulled him out of a gaping pit of despair with the sheer force of his insufferable personality.  But John had always shouted his heterosexuality from the rooftops.  He’d made it crystal fucking clear that he was a solid zero on the bloody Kinsey scale and that despite Harry’s suspicions and incessant teasing in their youth, there was nothing more to be said on the matter.  Eventually, she’d chosen to believe him—and therefore thought that the rumours of there being more between the two of them were just that.
I’m glad, too.  I’ve never been one to make a fuss over Christmas, but this year I’ve so much to be grateful for.  I can’t even begin to deny that I’m looking forward to it. “Let’s make it a tradition,” I say.

set my phone aside and slide down, rolling over to face John.
“Harry,”  Sherlock nods, stepping out of the kitchen where he’s just pulled a tray of mince pies from the oven, dropping it onto the giant butcher block island without much thought.  He strides toward them, kisses her on the cheek before pulling her into a genuine embrace.  They’d got on swimmingly from the start.  They hadn’t really had occasion to meet in years prior, but the two of them had taken to each other instantly when she began coming around over the summer.  They bonded, it seemed, over a shared love of relentlessly teasing John.  “Rosie, say hello.”
The past week has been hell on the both of us.  We spent six days chasing down the wrong man, and two more lives were lost because I was too much of an idiot to see that the killer was actually our suspect’s daughter.  Granted, the man I’d suspected turned out to be a sociopathic paedophile and is now locked securely in a prison cell. He’d put his daughter through a living nightmare, and the result was a series of brutal murders.  All Caucasian men in their sixties. None of them guilty of any punishable crime. Still, a clear pattern. They all looked startlingly like her father.
John is here.
“I knew there was no case from the start,”  He says quietly, and when Sherlock turns to ask him
Another hour passes in silence before a car stops, a block away to our right.  Headlights flicker off. A figure emerges--a tall man, with broad shoulders. We watch silently as he slinks through the shadows and straight to the shop.  The distant sound of jangling keys. He disappears behind a door on the side of the building.
“I know,” Sherlock whispers simply, but John can hear the underlying uncertainty, the very real fear of destroying everything they have with one misguided step.  He recognizes it because he feels it too.
The problem isn’t that it makes me uncomfortable, it’s that I want more of it.  I want this to be easy for us. I want to be allowed to wrap an arm around him, to pull him in.  And after all of his reassurances today, he’d likely be fine with it for the duration of the case.  But I can’t allow myself to do these things and then never have them again once we’ve returned home.  As much as I want to reach for him, I know that it’ll only hurt more when it’s over.
She and Greg discuss John often, lately.  They try to think up ways to convince him to be a part of their lives again—always coming up empty and changing the subject when the mood grows too grim.
“John, we haven’t been

and out there and doing what he must so that he can return—return to John.
“Thank you,”  She says, not needing to hear whatever fumbled words John was about to say.  Sherlock embraces her again, too.  Nodding and looking surprisingly choked up.  John takes his hand and smiles when Sherlock squeezes back to the point of pain.
I kiss his upper lip.  Brush my lips over his cheekbone. “Where to?”
“Hello there,” I say, switching off the stove and wiping my hands on a tea towel.  I return her grin. “We didn’t get much of a chance to chat yesterday, did we? Tell me what you’ve been up to,” She does—babbling animatedly about school, the new song in dance class, and how Molly is taking her to Mrs. Hudson’s for dinner tonight.
he’s lovely like this.  Soft and trusting, wild curls framing his untroubled face.  Absolutely bloody beautiful. I have to swallow around the lump in my throat, breathe through the ache in my chest—both present fairly frequently, as of this past week.  It sure didn’t take long for me to trip over the cliff I’ve been standing on for all these years and fall hopelessly in love with him. Hard to believe I’d ever thought him cold and untouchable—this warm, tactile creature in front of me tells a different story entirely.  Not sure I’ll ever fully forgive myself for walking away when he handed me his heart—for taking so
On the walk back to 221B, John holds my hand.  I’m still adjusting to the fact that I’m now allowed these simple gestures of affection.  Still difficult to believe that I no longer need to beat back everything I feel for him. No longer have to keep it all safely contained beneath my skin.

is a YouTube playlist of songs that put me in that mindset, if anyone feels like crying today.  They aren't all heartbreaking, some are more hopeful.  Most of them are pretty relevant to the John/Sherlock dynamic.  The genres are all over the damn place, as they're all songs that were important to me at different times in life.  Listened to them all while writing this.
This isn’t the first time John has come home to find Sherlock lying like a corpse on their sitting room floor.  The flat is unsettlingly dark, but a few stray curls are visible at one end of their dinged-up, overflowing coffee table and two long legs poke out the other end.
“I know that now,”  He says, then pauses, considering.  “I love you, Sherlock, okay?  More than anything,”  Sherlock swallows, lets out a slightly shaky breath.  Almost smiles, but not quite.  Stares.  John takes pity on him.  “Come here,”  He does, immediately, crawling on top of John and nudging his face into the curve of his neck.  John laughs, properly laughs, and holds onto him.  “We’ll talk about all this.  We’ll have to.  But for now we can just—do this.  Be together,”  The surge of relief he feels at his own words is a bit staggering.  He tightens his hold on the precious body above him.
“I was thinking we could host a gathering,” I blurt out.  We haven’t talked about this once. Unsure what force has compelled me to mention the idea now.  John may be absolutely dying to go spend Christmas at my parents’, for all I know.
“Sorry,”  He whispers, seeing the alarm on Sherlock’s cold-and-kiss-reddened features.  “It’s—I’m—it’s relief,”  John’s eyes drop shut, chest heaving as two thumbs gently glide over wet cheeks.  “I’m relieved,”  After a long moment of silence, he slowly opens his eyes, finding Sherlock studying him intently.
They’d decided ages ago not to feed Rosie the lie of Father Christmas, but the element of surprise is still something worth holding onto.  They’ve tucked away all her gifts in Sherlock’s laboratory, and have risen early to leave a few on the foot of her tiny little bed and the rest beneath the tree.  Now they stand, side by side, waiting.
We meet in the middle, my arms pulling him in.  He rests his cheek on my chest, hand curled comfortably against my ribcage.  My palm rubs circles across his back and I let out a soft sigh, the day’s tension fading as we melt against one another.
muted it, almost entirely.  Reduced it to a manageable thud so that Sherlock could slip under, could surrender, could sleep.
The house is a standard cottage, painted red.  Two bedrooms, one loo, outdated kitchen. And a small living room that’s now part of the open floor plan they’ve achieved by knocking out a wall.
He kisses me now, with passion, intent.  We gradually shed our layers until I lie flush against his sweat-slicked skin.  Our mouths tell each other stories of hunger, of lust. Tongues speak of tenderness, of truth and of trust.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, tightening his grip and squeezing the breath right out of him—shaking loose yet another point of tension that John has been holding onto for a solid decade.  That’s been happening a lot lately—old knots loosening and unspooling each time Sherlock demonstrates his comfort with this new closeness, the relative ease with which they’ve slipped into it.  John groans contentedly, muscles melting under Sherlock’s firm hold as he snakes an arm around his narrow waist.  Perhaps he’s always wanted this—to be allowed to be vulnerable—to be held with such affection.  It’s really rather nice.  “You smell
“John, even if you were strapped with a bloody machine gun, we wouldn’t be strolling blindly into that room with a sniper at large,” I’m nearly dragging him now, flying back to the car as fast as our feet will carry us.  “I’ve only just got you back, not about to put you right in the line of fire,” I fling open the door. “There’s someone--we heard--” Both guards leap out of the vehicle and bolt toward the house.
I can feel the built up frustration pouring out of him with every brutal thrust.  He doesn’t touch me and I don’t touch myself. This isn’t about me. Not this time.
John turns to me.  “Shall we grab a pint?”

sound that escapes from the back of his throat is nothing compared to the trembling mess that Sherlock has become.  Without consciously deciding to do so, they’ve pulled each other in—breaths and bodies—chest to chest and twining limbs.  Sherlock holds John's face in his hands in a way that says it all, really.  He meets John’s lips again and again, delving in and dragging to the surface every profound emotion John has never quite been able to suppress.
“Mm.  But once you go a bit deeper—“ He flings open the door, ever the drama queen, and steps aside to allow them in.
John stares, entirely bewildered by Sherlock’s raw words and shaking hands.  He reaches out, grabbing hold of trembling fingers and squeezing—a gesture that’s almost starting to feel natural for them.

It occurs to Sherlock, as he pushes the pads of his fingers into an old wound, as he loosens and unspools each tightly wound knot buried deep within the body of his best friend, that this—all of it,
Once he’s seated flush against John’s pelvis, they both force themselves to be still, despite hammering hearts, heaving breaths, restlessly shifting hips.  Sherlock has yet to open his eyes, but after a moment he slides his hands to John’s shoulders, pulling him upright, closer, closer, wrapping one large hand around the back of his neck, the other snaking around to the small of his back until they’re chest to chest, Sherlock seated snugly in John’s lap.
My fingers encircle the base of his shaft, stroke up, down, grip tight with intention.
“Nothing useful, we’d only just gotten in the door.  A sound upstairs. We retreated immediately.”
—and I’m certainly in no hurry.  Was that comment meant to be suggestive?  Is he expecting something to happen between us on this overnight stay in Bodega?  It’s only the Fourth of July—a useless American holiday, not an occasion for romance.  Am I overthinking things entirely? Perhaps I am. Perhaps he was only making an off-handed comment about swimming attire.  “Sherlock,” A hand on my knee. How long has he been sitting there? “Ready to go?”
“Yes?”  Sherlock breathes, eyes seeking confirmation.  John can only stare up at him, chest heaving, heart soaring.  He can hardly believe how easy this is—how eager Sherlock is to explore it.  He can’t remember the last time he’d had sex three times in a twelve hour period—it’s been well over a decade, certainly.  As much as John has always craved the closeness of others, the feeling of someone else’s skin beneath his palms—sex was always a bit of a chore.  He’s dated more women than he can count but he never really
“Yes, yes of course,”  John slides off of his stool, backing up immediately and never letting go of my arms.   Hal watches this possessive gesture with a slightly sour look on his face. “I’m here nearly every night—you know where to find me,”  Indeed we do. We’ve found him here three out of the three nights we’ve been in. Time to take a break from the Rainbow, I think.
“That’s up to you, Sherlock,”  It is? What does that mean? I feel my brow furrow in confusion.  He smiles slightly, continues. “Listen—I’ve been kidding myself for quite a long time about what I feel for you.  I’ve always known there was something between us, but really didn’t think this was an option at all. And now that it’s suddenly on the table—”  He takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly. “—at this point, I only want to be with you—it’s up to you what that means for us,” Silence falls between us.  I open my mouth, close it again. That is not what I’d expected him to say. Perhaps we’re on the same page, after all—I only want to be with him, too.
John thinks, smiling to himself.

his better-than-average olfactory neurons immediately supply) thrust upon him by John, who is just now trudging back up the stairs—no doubt having tipped the delivery driver an exorbitant sum for braving the weather he’d refused to venture out into.  Sherlock’s fault, really.  He’d dragged John out the previous day on a case that was in no way worth leaving the flat for, and they’d returned two hours later soaked to the bone and shivering, shoes sodden with muck and tempers flaring.
"Yeah. I do."
"Hello?" He berated himself for sounding less than confident, his usual, commanding tone deserting him.
He stared at her blinking, rapidly. The deductions he was making from the expression on her face, her intonation in the questions, her entire body language. He had evidently done something a bit not good.
Damn. He really did know.
"You did look quite lovely in those antlers." Sherlock smiled at John's reflection.
"Sherlock?" Well, there was only one way to find out.
The familiar curly hair was matted and stuck to the pale forehead with sweat and grease. His pale arm stretched out, a rubber tourniquet still loosely tied, a used syringe in his hand. They watched as Mycroft Holmes bundled his brother into a blanket and carried him out of the room for the third Christmas on the bounce. He'd spend a few weeks in rehab, would get out for good behaviour and walk straight to the nearest dealer for a fix.
"My gun? Why? We're going to your parent's!"
"Watson!" Sherlock's voice was groggy from having been rudely awoken.
Sherlock receives his first of three scheduled visitations.
"Perhaps. Problem?" Sherlock thought for a moment.
The third Sunday, and Sherlock was no longer surprised to see a box waiting for him. A new pocket magnifier, to replace the one he had lost last week, lay among rose petals and a small drawing of a bee by Rosie. He added the magnifier to his tool roll and tucked the bee into his wallet. He'd carry out an experiment on the petals with his Goddaughter later on.
The snow had fallen deep and perfect overnight. It lay in thick drifts against the cottage door and walls lending a magical appearance to the slumbering garden. The beehives stood at the end of the path with white roofs and as Sherlock looked out of the window, he smiled.
"I'm done, Sherlock. I'm done. I can't stand to watch you destroy yourself any longer. I love you too much for that."
"Sherlock. This can't go on. I can't do this anymore."
"Ere we are." Porky walked straight through the front door of number thirty and up the steps to the first floor flat. It was tiny and cramped but Christmas pop music was playing loudly and the smell of a roast dinner permeated the air. Sherlock was seriously starting to feel hungry now having only eaten two mince pies the day before.
"No, you're not stoned. Makes a change actually. I'm sure you've spent a few Christmases off your tits in some doss house. Leaving your poor brother to drag you out before you choked on your own vomit." Rudy shot him a disappointed look, shaking his head at Sherlock's past behaviour. "No, I have some wrongs to right and one of those is to do with you."
"Know anything about this?" He looked up as I shook the empty carton.
"You made a bee."
"Of course I can!"
"You don't have much close family. No parents left. This phone was a gift but it wasn't bought for you. It was bought for your brother as a Christmas present from his wife, Clara. Marriage is obviously on the rocks if he's given it away so soon after receiving it. This phone is six months old at that most. You're not close to your brother though. Maybe it's because he's left his wife, maybe you fancied the wife. Most likely, it's because he's an alcoholic. Your brother wanted you to keep in touch with you but not his ex-wife. He left her. Other way around and he would have kept the phone. Sentiment." He looked up the doctor who was staring dumbfounded.
"Yes, Sherlock. It's me."
"Not too bad. Mainly scar tissue from infection. I was laid out on the sand for a few hours before anyone found my unit. Not something I wish to remember so it's my turn now." The doctor turned and looked at his patient as he dried his hands. "What kind of experiment requires the insertion of a giant, plastic test tube into your rectum?" He raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the possible answers he might receive.
"Well, I did have a dream, last night. It was over one hundred years hence and there was a disease that was attacking the entire planet!"
"You always did enjoy the exciting life, Martha." They giggled and took another sip of tea.
She held out her hand in which she was clutching a slightly crumpled envelope.
Her third Christmas was her first at Baker Street. They'd moved back home, finally, after Sherlock broke his leg falling off a storage unit and into a skip. So John went to help him and simply stayed. Rosie was happy, so was he and Sherlock was beside himself with joy. It was he who went all out for Christmas that year.
"I hear you're a bit of a genius." Sherlock raised an eyebrow at the word 'bit'. "Okay, a real, bonafide genius. My tutor can't stop going on about how you aced your BSc and MChem in no time and how you're going to revolutionise forensics." Sherlock blushed lightly causing Victor to chuckle.
"Sherlock!" She laughed as she carried on dusting the mantelpiece taking extra care with the skull. "What have you bought John?" He continued to look at her. "For Christmas?" Nothing changed. "You have bought a gift for John, haven't you?" She stopped to stare at him in bewilderment.
"Brachial nerve damage?"
"No, that would be unprofessional. I'm merely making my own observations. Now, let's get started shall we. I'm John and I'm going to be helping you out today." He woke up the computer and scanned his badge to log on. A few mouse clicks later, and a black and white image of the patient's abdomen and pelvis appeared. The X-ray. "Right, Mr Sigerson, what have we here?" The patient rolled his eyes and felt himself blush as John's questioning gaze.
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock pondered the little box that sat on the table beside his chair. The tag said it was for him and to open it right away but still, it was not a date he had ever associated with receiving a gift before. Inside was a jar of honey from a small apiary in Sussex. Smiling in delight. he went to make toast.
"What? Married, with a dog, in a cottage in Sussex. A grown-up daughter and now a granddaughter? Depends."
"You know it's just to help me think! I can't concentrate without it. I can stop when I finish my thesis."
He followed Porky as they exited the house and the garden disappeared to be replaced by a small row of terrace houses. It wasn't an affluent street but Christmas decorations and lights were present in every window and garden creating a festive, cheerful atmosphere.
His birthday. Another year gone. Another year alone. John and Mary were back together, just as he had planned. Yet, his heart hurt to think of them tucked away in their flat, awaiting the arrival of their baby girl. As he looked across to the empty red chair opposite…
"Yeah?"
"So what? When have I ever done anything as dull as conventional?" He laughed again. Sherlock just stood there agape. "Sit down, sit down." Sherlock did as he was told and pulled out a dining chair, dropping heavily onto it not once taking his eyes off his uncle who looked just as he had the last time he'd seen him. An older, balder, more ginger, version of Mycroft. Not that his brother would thank him for the comparison.
The taller man smiled a devilishly seductive grin and turned towards his bedroom, the sheet trailing along in his wake. John stirred himself to follow behind.
Picking up the phone, he opened the message again. This year could be different. Maybe, just maybe.
Alone.
There was, however, one potential benefit of this situation. Maybe it would mean John would change his plans. The boring teacher had apparently left in a snit earlier and had likely once again made some nark about John and Sherlock being perfect for one another. Probably all her friends had warned her off John because of his mad flatmate. Oh well, she was just another one of John's girlfriends that he had accidentally-on-purpose run-off by being himself. Well, maybe himself plus a bit extra. Sherlock had been raised as pretty much an only child with Mycroft being so much older. He had never learned to share his things and John was his most definitely. If only he could see it and stop trying to find someone else to try and squeeze into their already full and satisfying life. Well, that's how Sherlock saw it anyway.
Everything always had been and always would be for John. Right until his final breath.
"Well, I made a few bad decisions regarding you and your siblings." At the plural, Sherlock looked up, intrigued. "Oops! And that is why I'm only here to warn you. About to bugger this up as well if I'm not careful. My line manager will not be pleased at all. Not used to having a line manager. Used to being the top rung but give me time. I've only been dead ten years." Rudy chuckled to himself. "Right then. I recommend getting some sleep. You won't have much chance after midnight. These events can be a bit draining and if it all goes according to plan, you'll need some energy for what tomorrow should hopefully bring." Sherlock didn't move. He just sat there still staring in disbelief. "Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock! Just bugger off to bed!"
"Christmas, obviously. But mistletoe? I don't understand."
"Yes, but do you?" John looked at his sister thoughtfully for a moment before nodding.
Sherlock sat in the pew furthest away from the service at the altar. He hid in darkness, head covered with an itchy, woollen hat and a hood pulled as far down over his brow as he could. His scarf was wrapped around his nose and mouth leaving only his eyes visible. They were brown; contact lenses to cover the distinguishing freckle in his right eye. He was aiming to be invisible and had succeeded in doing so for over a year now.
In my life I love you more
"Let's get you home, brother mine." He gently scooped the gaunt and much too thin boy into his arms and carried him back out into the fresh air.
"You're not in the army now and I am not one of your cadets." As he said this, he felt a surge of arousal at the thought of seeing the doctor in fatigues, ordering him about.
"But I wish you'd worn the antlers." Mrs Hudson gushed at the detective as he put down the violin. She didn't see the blush as he looked at John, remembering what she'd have seen him doing whilst wearing the antlers had she walked in ten minutes earlier.
"Ah, a film. Goodie." Sarcastic reply.
"Oh yes!" As dreamy looks overtook their expressions, they too faded from view as Porky once again took Sherlock's arm and led him away.
"Why can't you just tell me what they're going to say? It doesn't sound very efficient. Four spirits for one man?"
"Are you just going to keep repeating select words of one syllable? Honestly, you're meant to be a genius! Surely you can accept something as mundane as a ghost." Rudy laughed again but stopped when he saw that Sherlock was starting to look increasingly pale. "Well, anyway. Yes. I did something a few years ago which, unfortunately, has had a rather negative impact on your life. I am here to tell you that tonight, we're going to put it right."
They both turned to the laptop and began searching in earnest. Facts were thrown out, laughter shared, more questions asked. Who'd have thought such a lovely afternoon could be inspired by a cooked bird?
"Myc?" Slurred words. Half-open eyes. Pupils as small as pinpricks, invisible in the nighttime gloom.
John had known about Sherlock's sweet tooth since the day they had met. Two sugars in coffee. Gingernuts. Mince pies. Sometimes it was the only way to get food into the detective when on a case. Place a plate of something sweet and carby in front of him and it would be gone without the younger man realising he was being played. So John shouldn't have been surprised when the candy canes started disappearing off the tree.
"Longer." She looked at the man beside her. Really looked and saw everything.
This chapter broke my heart to write so I apologise to anybody now having a little weep.
"He even sounds like you." Rosie giggled again.
"Come on, Sherlock. It's time to go home." Archie took the older man's hand and once again the lights faded as they returned to Baker Street.
“Da?” They both looked to the little girl still held close to Sherlock’s side. Swallowing, an answer was given.
When finished, she stood in the doorway and admired her work. With a nod, she escaped the way she had entered.
"All done. Very straight forward." Sherlock nodded slowly and blinked to try and clear his vision.
To be sat here now, in his parent's home, at Christmastime, he could feel the sentiment he so carefully kept hidden sneak out. Mummy and Daddy were flirting and smiling as always, the embodiment of happy marriage. Sherlock was sitting with Rosie Watson on his knee, laughter lines deepening with age and use. His now husband, John, laughing along at the fun and games.
The day passed slowly, drearily, never-endingly. He went up to John's room to find his gun only to discover a note attached to the box threatening violence if it was even opened. He ignored the note and took out the weapon only to find that the firing mechanism had a key element missing along with another note. 'I have the hammer. Knew I couldn't trust you. Git." Sherlock placed the gun and the note back in the case and locked them away again.
"Sorry, what? Aren't you meant to be the Ghost of Christmas Past?"
"Don't tell me what I do and do not mean, Clara! I meant every word!" Harry stood too, the siblings glaring at each other across the dinner table. "What is he to you, John? And don't just say flatmate, 'cause I don't believe you." Sherlock watched as all the anger suddenly drained out of John and he slumped down onto the chair. Harry looked at Clara in confusion and concern. "Johnny?"
"You know the answer to that."
“Welcome back. Let’s have dinner. It’s your birthday. Treat yourself.” He smiled a little before closing the message and laying the phone down on the chair arm.
"Cool! Got any pictures?" Sherlock smiled and grabbed his laptop. After a few moments of looking at the gory images which the young lad found incredibly interesting, they settled once again in front of the fire.
"What now?" His mouth felt dry with nerves. He was finally accepting the fact that yes, he really was very attracted to his flatmate.
"Right. And the Police actually ask for your help? I didn't think they used amateurs." The patient made a sound of exasperation and rolled his eyes.
"I dunno. I mean, he's the best friend I've ever had. He saved me when I got invalided home. All I wanted to do was end it, life had no meaning and then he was there and he took over everything." He took his hands away from his face and looked at his sister, begging her to understand what he was saying and make sense of the tumultuous thoughts in his head. "He takes up all the thoughts in my head and is the one person in the world I want to spend all my time with." He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
"Do I need to worry?"
Right enough, a moment later, a lanky teen with the by now very familiar mop of hair came charging through the door carrying a stack of textbooks. He quite clearly wasn't looking where he was going and, even though he knew what to expect, Sherlock still jumped when the inevitable happened. The younger Sherlock crashed headlong into the boy walking in the opposite direction and both ended up on the floor, books and leaves of paper flying and landing everywhere.
It will get better. Honest. Eventually. I think.
"To see where your hatred for Christmas started." The young lad stood and grabbed hold of Sherlock's hand and before he knew it, they were surrounded by snow and standing in the woodland just behind his parent's house.
"Have you see John?" Taking a deep breath, she took hold of the bride, gently steering her away from the garden and back into the party. "Is that Sherlock's coat?" Duty calls, thought Janine and smiled.
"No, why do you care? About me?" Sherlock was starting to feel more alert, the fog clearing in his mind quickly now.
John took a deep breath and buried his face in his hands. Sherlock couldn't stop himself, he felt compelled to be near his friend even though he was merely an observer in this scene. He walked across the room, paying no mind to the furniture, and reached out to lay a hand on John's shoulder, his name on his lips.
He stood next to his daughter, looking at the sparkling Christmas Tree. Sherlock joined them, his arms sliding around them both.
“Forgot to tell you this morning. Got a date after work. Could you possibly get off your arse and get some milk?”
“Da is a lot easier for a two-year-old to say, wouldn’t you agree?” John walked in, a larger envelope in his hand.
"So did I. I won't tell if you don't." She smiled at him and for a second, a small glimmer of an emotion other than sadness appeared in his eyes. She took one and he lit it for her before taking another drag of his own, blowing the smoke upwards as though howling to the moon. She pulled his coat tighter around herself, snuggling into it's warmth.
"Wow! That was brilliant!" The doctor beamed as he took the phone back off the man in the bed.
"Why?"
"Really? Well, there's a first time for everything I suppose." He rolled his eyes and stalked over to his violin.
"How bad could it be? I've never met your mum and dad but at least you've got some to go visit." The look of outrage (completely put on, of course, he didn't actually mind his parents. Quite liked them really when they were behaving themselves) on Sherlock's face intensified. "Fine. But I'm still going to see my sister and that's that. I know you've had bad news but..." Sherlock didn't let him finish, he just lay his violin down on the desk and stormed to his bedroom, slamming the door in mock outrage.
Watson blushed and smiled. Glancing at the door to see it was locked, he put down his glass and cigarette before moving to straddle Holmes' lap, kissing him softly.
"Wha...how...why?"
"Why not another animal? Why turkey?"
"Oh, it's you." He attempted that same smile he'd shot at her with the vain hope that someone might be willing to talk to him now that his role was finished. Janine almost winced with the pain and effort the pathetic smile cost him to spread on the lower half of his face.
"My time is at an end, Mister 'Olmes. Ye've 'ad a lot of insight there and I know ye'll want to think it through but ye have to see the next spirit now. We've run over a bit but we're just in time. Here he is." Porky nodded over Sherlock's shoulder so the taller man turned around straight into the next apparition. Everything went black.
“To what do I owe this pleasure, Watson?” His voice was croaky from sleep, a yawn punctuating the end of the sentence.
"Victor looks like he might have been good for you if he'd stuck around." The older Sherlock nodded, a small, fond, smile on his lips as he remembered his first human friend. His first boyfriend as it had turned out.
"I know this place. I used to play out here all the time." Just then, a small, red, bundle of fur came bounding around the corner of the house with a small boy with wild, curling hair, following in its wake. "Redbeard." Sherlock muttered as he watched the very young version of himself chasing after his beloved dog.
Rosie Watson was four years and eleven months old when London was hit by the worse snowstorm since the Beast from the East in 2018. It started on the Monday before Christmas and overnight, five inches fell in parts of the city. School had closed the previous Friday so it was all there for her to enjoy. She didn't really remember the last snow, being very little at the time. But this, this was different.
He could still recall the feeling of being in those arms as he learned the waltz. Could still feel the warmth and security and affection that seeped through suit jackets and jumpers and shirt sleeves. Could still feel the beat of his heart as it thundered in his chest, beating out in Morse that this was where he was meant to be. Looking behind him, he saw his new wife and soon to be mother of his child chatting with her friends. A smile almost of satisfaction on her face and at once, he knew.
"Nope. I thought they were getting close with, you know, the whole being strapped into semtex and nearly dying but no. Still nothing." She took a bite of her biscuit, looking thoughtful. "I blame that woman. The one who drugged Sherlock and installed that ridiculous message tone on his phone. Honestly, it's lewd!" Another nibble. "Every time he gets a message from her, it moans in a very inappropriate way. Makes me blush, honestly. And John! Well, he can barely control his jealousy. He's counted them you know. Each message. Sometimes, it's several times in an hour. The phone just moans and moans whilst they're sitting there watching the news. Poor, John. Heaven knows what he thinks about it all."
As hard as he had found it at the time, he missed the laughter and cheerfulness of a Christmas spent with friends. Of Christmas lights and carols on the violin and gifts. Now, there was no one.
"And have you ever felt as strongly about a woman as you do about Sherlock?"
"M've a tolerance to sedatives. Need high dose to work."
"Why don't you tell me all about it? Over a coffee? It's the least I could do after nearly knocking you into next year." Sherlock thought about it as he picked up the last of the fallen books and nodded. They walked off together and out of sight.
They sat in front of the blazing fire, the advent candle lit and flickering on the mantelpiece. Holmes smoked his pipe, Watson a cigarette. Both held glasses of brandy and were simply enjoying quiet companionship. The year was 1895.
A case. His mind corrects before his heart tells him to stop kidding himself. Saving John Watson. It was a definite cause.
So John decided that he was going to treat himself to a nice, warm blanket. He laid it on the back of the sofa and then after dinner, he sat down and pulled it around, snug and cosy within its folds. A few moments later, Sherlock sat beside him, as they did to watch the news. Sherlock started off at his usual distance. Then, with a sideways glance at John snug in the blanket, moved a little closer. Within five minutes, he and Sherlock were touching all down one side.
"Yes, love."
"How are those boys of yours doing? Has he stopped shooting the walls yet?" Mrs Hudson laughed.
“John…”
"Well can you honestly say you love me?"
His best friend would be ok. That was the best birthday gift.
"A message? For me?" Sherlock shook his head and quickly pulled up his sleeves, not entirely sure that he hadn't been shooting up and just couldn't remember administering the drugs.
"You mean you haven't already planned out which ones?"
Sherlock was sitting crossed legged beside the tree, the plastic wrapper carelessly discarded and the candy cane, well, that was the thing. The way it moved in and out of those lips, the suggestive sucking. John groaned as he watched, instantly aroused. Sherlock's mischievous gaze met his.
"Blimey! They said you were a genius! Indeed we are. I am the Present Day Festivities Advisor. I'm 'ere to show you what u're missin' out on." He laughed at the thought while Sherlock just continued to look bemused. "So, ye've been shown some bits of what has been, let's 'ave a look at what's goin' on today, then. Ready?" Sherlock took a deep breath, stood and walked over to Johnson, hoping that this would at least be a bit easier going than the previous set of visions.
"Not the type of question I was expecting. Not really even a question. But, yes. I was. In the shoulder. Sniper." He washed his hands in the sink, methodically soaping up and rinsing each finger and part of his palm and wrist.
Sherlock hated feeling like this. Every little movement made the wound in his chest pull sending waves of pain around his body. Nothing the hospital had given him touched the agony. Just another negative to being a recovering drug addict he supposed. He tried to hide the pain as much as he could from John. He wanted to make it as easy as possible for him to leave and go back to Mary, to safety. Who on Earth knew what she would do to them both if John left her for good. No. This was for the best even though when he thought about it, the ache in his chest had little to do with the bullet.
"Not right now. No." A sharp, military nod and then John's head was resting on Sherlock's shoulder.

"It's a drink."
The shorter man looked up at the taller one, trying to read the expression and thoughts of the man before him. He looked like the answers to a thousand questions had been answered yet more had reared up in their place. He looked confused and angry at the confusion yet also like he was starting to form a plan. Porky was sure that tonight's visits were going to be successful but the final showdown was always a bit difficult to judge. He'd been sure of success before when handing over to part three. Sometimes, unpredictable things could happen when seeing the future. If only they could get out of...too late. He Porky sensed that time had run away with him again and that a call to head-office was now out of the question.
Placing the box on the kitchen table, she started to extract the contents, making sure not to tangle anything and let any of the objects fall on the floor. She quickly and efficiently moved around the living area, sidestepping books and the violin. She swept along the mantelpiece, around the skull and the dagger. Across to the skull picture.
“This is
Free, technically, yes; but the fact that he let himself be drugged and have his laptop almost used as an exchange coin for a blackmailer sits badly on his otherwise impeccable reputation.
He flinches when John presses the cold endpiece of a stethoscope against his chest. John mumbles an apology. Sherlock thinks it is the loveliest thing he has ever heard and tells him so.
Like magic, a small clearing appears in front of the club’s door, and the limo stops in front of the red carpet. The roar of ‘Sherlock! Sherlock!’ being chanted by ecstatic fans is deafening as the car door opens and Sherlock climbs out and waves a hand at the crowd. With difficulty, John and Irene help the security staff to stave off a couple of overeager fans trying to reach Sherlock, and manage to whisk him in the club.
John snaps back, “What would my league be, dishonest military types?”
‘And bloody pissed off,’ John chuckles wetly.
As they break their hug, the remaining passengers – Mycroft and Sherlock – leave the car.
Molly smiles softly. “I know you do. Now,” she sets her mug down and straightens her spine, “I know John is away, which means you are hardly eating; how about we go and get some lunch? My treat.”
The soft morning light peeked through the intricate patterns of the lace curtains. It was still very early; the bedroom was painted in blues and purples gently easing into white gold, promising a sun-filled day.
He helps John sit down, hunching down and slowly releasing his grip. John heaves a sigh of relief.

The two men take a few sips in silence, interrupted only by the rustling of leaves on the trees from the yard. The wind is picking up, a tell-tale sign of rain to come. The air crackles with unspoken tension, neither of them knowing how to continue this dance.
They take the few steps that separate their table from the dance floor, past the draped curtains and to the centre of the room. They turn to each other and John takes the lead, one hand still clasping Sherlock’s and the other gently resting on his waist. Sherlock’s free hand lands on John’s shoulder, gentle and feather-light. They lock eyes and relax in each other’s arms, finding their rhythm, turning slowly on the floor to the sound of the ballad.
A silent agreement passes between them.
“Brainless masses screeching at seventy miles per hour. Marvellous.” Sherlock tightens his coat closer to his body against the chilly morning air.
“Honestly John, I know you are unobservant–”
“Yeah, technically the idiot wasn’t doing anything illegal,” Greg continues, “but we still have a few friends back at the ‘Box*.’ So, we got an address and me and Irene paid the man a visit.”
“And whose fault is that?”
right now. I was just about to put the kettle on, would you fancy a cuppa?”
Sherlock takes a ragged breath and bows his head.
“Not. A. Word. Mycroft.” Sherlock shoves past Mycroft and makes a bee line to the bathroom, shutting the door loudly after him.
“Guys, when did all of that happen? The bomb, the shot?” Irene asks, sombre. John had started the call by explaining in detail the last day’s events.

They eye each other for a moment that stretches for an eternity. John’s pulse is loud in his own ears, drowns the clatter of forks on plates and the sizzle of food in woks, mutes the shrill voices of the restaurant guests next table, erases the muffled traffic noises that seep through the front door.

His days are filled with writing music, recording, choreographing, filming… he doesn’t have a romantic partner to spend time with, and the few ‘friends’ John’s seen around the manor are more professional acquaintances than the confiding friendly sort. While Sherlock’s public persona is open to the world to see, the private one is locked up in some unapproachable tower.

. Sherlock Holmes.”
Wrapped up in his thoughts, John is oblivious to having passed Bond Street and almost misses exiting the tube at Baker Street. It’s a short walk to 221 and he shakes off his circular thoughts about the trip and what all that meant as he climbs up the stairs to their flat.
The butter melts slowly in the hot frying pan, the milk solids separating from the fat in a jellyfish-shaped pattern, then bubbling away into a nutty fragrant concoction. Sherlock cracks two eggs over the pan, makes sure the whites don’t merge. One egg for each adult, well-separated and defined. Proteins denature irreversibly and coagulate the white opaque and solid. He slides the eggs sunny-side up to two plates, sets them on the table. John deposits toast on the plates. A concerted dance, movements around each other as a well-practised waltz.
Sherlock lives, resurrected by every caress from John’s fingers.
“I got your letter.”
He could despise John for being the cause of the heartbreak (obvious) but it is all a confluence of unfortunate events, in the end. Mycroft hurts too, for him, for the unfairness of it all. The only thing he can do is the usual same – to be there for his brother.
The man crouches to pick up a shred of Sherlock’s costume, lost in the debris of the aftermath.

“Yes, well, that is what I am proposing.” Sherlock has the gall to look amused at John’s embarrassment. Yet, with uncharacteristic patience, he waits while John processes this information.
As Greg is hoping Sally sees his point, he watches her instead transform: she lifts fiery eyes at him, clenches her fists, hardens her jaw, her whole stance tensing.
Arms akimbo, John lifts his chin just that little bit higher up, the centimetre or so that makes Sherlock hesitate. “You will spend a few hours in this place or so help me. It’s a long trip for just one ride.”
Sherlock uproots a handful of dandelions and tries to forget. He had been getting better, he really had, but that damned letter showed up and took hold of Sherlock’s thoughts. Even unopened and largely ignored, it burns bright underneath the pile of newspapers.
Does he feel the seasons chasing each other? The taste of food instead of decay, the smell of flowers instead of spilled blood? The bitter alcohol in his veins? The acid in the back of his throat?
Oh. No, in fact he had not apologised for this, but what of it? Sherlock knows they were both out of sorts, him high as a kite, John grieving, both being pushed to that place where they became untethered and unhinged.
“John? Anything on your mind?”

“Alright, and you call me John. I’m not practicing any longer, so. Ah, do you have a clean surface where I could place some of our samples?” John looked around him. The morgue was a large room, with standard stainless-steel counters along two walls, refrigerated drawers on a third wall, and a couple of stretchers, also in stainless-steel, standing in the middle of the room.
Sherlock calms his inner turmoil at the sight of his sleeping flatmate. Whatever the future holds, John has already changed Sherlock’s life for the better.
He feels the cushion dip with the weight of John sitting next to him.
Mycroft acquiesces with a tilt of his head and replies, “Better a small flesh wound than your life, little brother. This shall pass.”
Inside, the letter rests still on the kitchen table. The contents? Probably a rehash of the endless cycle of hate and regret that marked Sherlock’s last months on Baker Street. Why open it and make real the words that cut through Sherlock’s chest, deeper than Mary’s bullet? At least that pain had been quantifiable, justifiable, understandable.
Molly gently grabbed another vibrator and started. “So, um–”
“No.” John sets his mug firmly on the coffee table and shakes his head. “I don’t do celebrities.”
“That would be good. Yes.” Sherlock clears his throat. “I will have dinner in the meanwhile, anyway.”

“Why would John be hammering on the walls? And also ignoring my texts? He usually makes Sherlock reply to me or replies himself, but—”
Thoughts of plans to protect Sherlock churn in disquiet in John’s head, though. Sherlock seems to sense this. “What are we going to do?”
Sherlock is a huge star; of course John has seen him on some random ad or the cover of a magazine. He’s worked for a few celebrities before, so he’s not easily star-struck. And yet. There stands Sherlock, six feet of elegance radiating from underneath a bespoke dark grey suit. A navy-blue shirt completes the ensemble, two buttons undone to expose a pale throat. The sharp light differences in the room accentuate Sherlock’s chiselled cheekbones and dark, luscious curls. But what makes John’s heart skip a beat is not the sensual figure in front of him – well, not
"Sherlock?"
I’ve not had many happy birthdays over the years. But I believe they’re going to be a lot better from now on. Especially now that John won’t ever be able to forget the date again.”
"Stop what?"
"Oh! He wouldn't shoot or stab anyone who didn't deserve it. He's very good like that. And John keeps him in check. I think he's hidden the gun or at least the bullets anyway." Mrs Hudson's sister looked on with an expression of confusion mixed with concern.
"I know."
The following weekend, John entered the flat to find it empty. It was the last few days before Christmas and he'd finished the shopping for everyone. He was putting the gifts under the tree when Sherlock returned, a smile on his face.
“Da! Da!” Rosie started and Sherlock looked down to her.
A patter of footsteps followed by clicking dog claws and mumbled warnings of 'careful!' clattered down the stairs as their granddaughter, Catherine, and Rosie arrived to greet the morning along with Graham, the dog.
He had tried so hard when it came to his younger brother. Had cared for him when life was too much and the younger man had sought an escape; sometimes temporary, sometimes with a desire for permanence. He had been by his side throughout it all, wiping the sweat and vomit away from his face and holding his hand when the withdrawal made him scream with pain.
"Well, I've been told by my line manager that it's important. Especially selected by your uncle so I have to show it to you. More than my job's worth to miss it out of the tour." Sherlock swallowed thickly and nodded, allowing himself to be pulled along. "Let's stand just here and if we look over there, we should be able to see what's important about this year."
"What. Is. This?" I looked at the carton he was holding, standing in the fridge door.
I had visited my dealer earlier on. Planned on speed balling myself to oblivion. I had it all laid out on the coffee table like it was a scientific experiment I was about to conduct. Then something happened. Mycroft. He saw the gear. Saw the drugs. And simply left me to it. Didn’t take anything with him. Didn’t drag me away. He allowed me to make a choice.
"Ah, John. Wonderful." The detective strode over to stand in front of John before looking up. There, hanging off the cow skull, was mistletoe.
The moonlight cast down on the couple swaying gently on the lawn. The words of the song filtered into his ears as he stared at the pair.
"You've taken a while to wake up. Didn't realise I'd knocked you out so much!"
"It is what it appears to be." The patient looked away awkwardly.
It’s quiet in the flat. Alone for the first time in a few days. Well. Relatively. Mrs Hudson is downstairs and apparently, Big Brother is always watching. He should be grateful. Thankful that so many people care about his wellbeing. They’ve taken shifts to keep him off the ‘sweeties’. They don’t trust him. Not that he’s given them much reason to recently. But it was for a cause.
The smell was even better once they were inside and the food was all but prepared and ready to be eaten on the rustic dining table. A roaring fire blazed in the hearth and the cottage was decorated with branches of holly and ivy. A large, real, Christmas tree stood in the corner. What it lacked in height due to the low, beamed ceilings, it made up for in width and fullness. It was a beautiful place to spend the festive season.
Archie looked at the older Sherlock and reached for his hand when he saw the tears running freely down the older man's face. The scene faded to one that was familiar in its frequency rather than location. A doss house. Junkies all over the floor, some on mattresses, some on furniture. Some were awake. Some were shooting up. Some were passed out. Some were likely dead. Nothing needed to be said when they watched the taller man in the suit walk through the room, careful not to step on any of the inhabitants, to a mattress at the far end of the room.
"Fine. Here." He handed the patient his phone, curious about what he could possibly do with and inwardly cursing himself for a) actually having his bloody phone in his pocket and b) giving it to a total stranger who had inserted random foreign objects up himself with the excuse of 'science'. For all John knew, he could be some weird pervert with a doctor or even a soldier kink who was going to hunt him down afterwards.
He’d done it to save their lives. He’d given his own to make it so that theirs would continue. But he was the only one sitting on his own. In a chair once used by his best friend. The one person he could be himself around. Could let down the facade that was exhausting to maintain. Not anymore.
"Me?"
"Afghanistan or Iraq?" The doctor raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“Yes, little Bee. Yes, I’ll be your Da.” Sherlock picked her up and held her against him, kissing her hair. John wrapped them both in his arms before looking up at his friend’s face, tears in both men’s eyes.
He types out the message and clicks send before he can think twice. The response is almost immediate. He nods and stands. Grabbing his coat, gloves and scarf, he turns out the lights and leaves 221b smiling.
"Ah yes, the virus. Fascinating. What else was in your vision of the future?"
"I...I..."
"A novel? Come, Watson! You know I don't lower myself to that level." Holmes sipped his brandy, a small smile on his face. Watson caught onto the ruse quickly and smiled in return.
For her second Christmas, he went all out with the decorations and presents. He knew she wouldn't remember this one either but he took enough photographs to help prove he had learned his lesson. She would have fun celebrations from now on.
"Are you asking me out on a date?" John thought about it.
He had to hide so much these days, it was killing him, slowly. The aching loneliness. The feeling that Moriaty had won after all. Had indeed burned the heart out of him. Mycroft was right. Sentiment was a chemical defect and he was definitely on the losing side.
"So, I take it we're going to evaluate my previous experiences, then."
Sherlock and John clattered up the seventeen steps to the flat and flung open the door. Their chatter stopped upon entering the room as both men stood agape at the sight. Tinsel and fairy lights were everywhere.
"Right, that tells you I was in the army. Doesn't tell me how you arrived at that question but there's time for that. My turn. What on Earth have you been up to?" The patient raised an eyebrow at the way the question was phrased.
"You're better than John ever managed. His deductions were always abysmal." Rough and broken, his voice was barely recognisable as the aloof and cocky, consulting detective she had met earlier.
And with that, they were transported to another room, this time with no light coming through the thick curtains and the thick fug of smoke and drugs hanging in the air. The younger Sherlock was laying on the bed, barely moving. The remnants of a joint in the ashtray at the side of the bed and white residue leftover on a mirror on the desk which once held his PhD thesis. Now, it held nothing of value academically. They stood in a corner, watching the scene unfold as Victor opened the door and at once started coughing.
"Oh yeah, right. You love me so you're leaving me. I get it."
"We should make snowmen." John walked up behind him, wrapping his arms around the taller man's waist, resting his chin on his shoulder. Sherlock smiled and covered John's hands with his own.
"M'okay." John chuckled.
At the end, John turned to his husband. "She's becoming more your daughter by the day." With a devilish grin, he pulled the little girl into a hug and said. "Every snow often, you're both brilliant."
"What do you mean?" Sherlock looked at his landlady with a rare expression of confusion.
"Finally! Shall we go to bed?"
"Will you put that bloody phone away! He's not going to text you back, he's not going to suddenly change his mind and he's not going to start behaving like a human being just 'cause it's Christmas!" She slammed the dish down onto the table and sat down with a huff of annoyance.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
Moriarty was right.
"Maybe. He knows what to look at now though." He stopped and let out a bitter laugh. "I made my first and last vow today. To a man who had just made his to someone else." He ground the second cigarette into the dirt and turned has back to her and the party. His shoulders hunched, his posture tightly wound and uncomfortable and so unlike the man she had seen in the newspaper.
It is what it is. Words whispered against John’s hair whilst holding him in his arms for the first time. John had hugged him before. This was the first time Sherlock had held him.
"Those words have been said to me before."
He closed his eyes and snuggled under the blanket John had brought home one day. It smelt of him and Sherlock found it comforting although he couldn't quite explain why. Maybe it was simply a sense of normality after such an unsettling event. There was no other reason for him to feel slightly less disturbed when cocooned in the scents of his friend, was there? He didn't sleep, he just dozed on and off, making brief trips into his mind palace to see if he couldn't come up with some other ideas to explain the experiences of the evening. He wasn't convinced at all that it had been real and by the time midnight was virtually upon him, he'd pretty much convinced himself that nothing at all was going to happen.
"But I'm not gay!" John's eyes shot open and Sherlock took a step backwards as if struck. It was an often-heard statement when people drew their own conclusions about their relationship and every time, John would correct them and get annoyed when Sherlock didn't. He turned to Porky, about the make the request to leave, not wanting to hear any more of this conversation when something Harry said made him stop in his tracks.
"We were meant to be dancing." He snorted as the music changed and 'Summer of 69' started blasting out of the open windows.
"Well, I think I've gotten to know you pretty well, inside and out, today and yes. I suppose I am."
"Wanna stay a bit longer?" Porky looked up at the taller man beside him.
When John went to put the fourth box down, he found there was already one there. Opening it up, he found a drawing of his favourite photo: John holding Rosie, Sherlock's arm around them both, smiling brightly.
call him that." His voice was quiet yet menacing, a thunderous expression, clenched fists leaning on the table.
“Demanding this morning. Daddy not fed you yet?” She giggled and he pressed a kiss to her hair before following opening the card. He just stared at the words inside.
"No, but think of all the soldier friends that John will invite. All in uniform."
Janine didn't have to think twice about ditching the guy who's dancing was, to be kind, rather sub-par, in order to make her way across the room to the man who's smile didn't get anywhere close to reaching his eyes. Over the course of the day, she had seen her 'other-half' declare his feelings, solve a murder, save a man's life and play the most beautifully heart-breaking piece of music she had ever heard. Now, well, now he seemed broken. The mask fading away to nothing and the true realisation that his life had changed with absolutely no chance of ever going back finally showing in the weary creases around his eyes and mouth. Here was a man who looked like he was about to slide out of the room and doubted that anyone at all would miss him for one second. A man who's job was done, who's final act had been played and who now had to try and piece together a new life, just for him. Only him.
"Uncle Rudy?" The man stopped singing and whirled around to meet the confused and shocked expression of his nephew.
"I'm going to enjoy unwrapping you from that hideous jumper later," Sherlock said flirtatiously; a whole side to the detective John had been surprised to discover.
"Well, you were a little preoccupied at the time." John smiled at Sherlock. "Let's get your paperwork ready and see if we can get you out of here." The doctor walked over to the door before turning once more. "Dinner?"
"Christ, Sherlock! How can you even breathe in here?"
"How about you follow me, sir, and you can tell me what you've been up to and what you mean by that question." The patient nodded then slowly and very carefully followed the curious doctor out of the waiting area and into a consultation room. "Take a seat." This was said with a small smirk which Sigerson chose to ignore knowing full well it was deserved.
"Get a cab."
"My phone?"
"In my research! You've always been jealous that I had a degree before you had O-levels!"
"Just take a seat over there, Mr Sigerson. A doctor will see you shortly" The tall man shot an embarrassed and uncomfortable look at the receptionist and rather gingerly walked away to stand in the corner of the waiting room. He was grudgingly impressed that she managed to keep a straight face. He'd heard that his predicament happened plenty so it was likely he wasn't her first.
"I dunno, little one. Maybe Sherlock knows." She turned at once to face the man who was holding her. He shot John a look, who simply smirked back in return, and looked thoughtful for a moment.
"That's right. So, let's have a look."
He spotted the familiar curly hair of his young brother, cascading off the edge of the filthy mattress the boy was half falling off. Crouching down, he felt the long pale neck for a pulse and released a sob of relief when he felt it strong albeit rapid under the paper-thin skin.
"You've deleted the link between mistletoe and Christmas?" John asked in amazement. "And I thought deleting the solar system was bad."
"Come on, let's go." The older Sherlock felt Archie tugging on his arm and he followed the lad as they left the two brothers sitting on the log in the garden.
"You've been smoking."
In my life I love you more
“Wot it say?”
"I like you. A lot." And he knew what the other man meant by this.
Sherlock had actually gone to the shops for once and bought not only milk but also John’s favourite beer. He selected the takeaway menus and put them on the coffee table that last year held his escape from reality. John had kept mentioning a movie marathon night and Sherlock was more than happy for that to be this year’s method of relieving his boredom.
"It says it contains egg. Lots of sugar. Cream. Why would you buy an omelette in a carton? Why would you put sugar in an omelette?"
"Why is there a syringe on the desk?"
Twenty minutes, thirty, sixty. He was fed up of standing still now, his back starting to ache as well as various other places that had been abused by his inability to take safety precautions in the name of science. Finally, he opened his eyes when he heard his name called for a second time.
"But you're more than just friends, yeah?" Harry had also resumed her seat, Clara's hand in hers and resting on the dining table.
"Before I died." Janine gasped with the realisation of what those words implied.
Janine shot one more smile at Sherlock which he returned before resting his cheek on top of the shorter man's head. Walking back to the party, she supposed she should have felt a conflict. She was the maid of honour after all.
He hadn't enjoyed having people around for Christmas drinks but John had insisted, as had Mrs Hudson. She had sneaked in one afternoon while they were out on a case and decorated the flat with tinsel and fairy lights and nothing but the look of happiness on John's face had stopped him from ripping them down. He was getting soft. That needed to stop. Immediately. Mycroft would start to notice and tell Mummy and then everything would be worse because she would start to think he was open to visits and affection and things. That was more than a bit not good.
“Ten years ago, I was sitting in a dingy flat on Montague Street. I was smoking cigarette after cigarette. Turning thirty. A lot of people find a new decade hard. But most people accumulate more as they go through life. More friends, children, hobbies. I had no friends. No boyfriend. No one.
Almost a year had passed since he had first met John Watson.  A year full of adventure, danger and intrigue. He never expected to have a friend, yet here he was. An actual human being who he liked spending time with.
Inside was an expensive leather notebook and a silver pen. It was inscribed:
"I think he means a lot more to you than just being a friend, John," Clara spoke softly
"No dear, she's a dominatrix. But she died the other night. Or so everyone believes anyway so maybe it will all be over soon."
Before he could go any further with that thought, the room was filled with a greenish light and the image of a short, portly man in a tatty red tailcoat appeared before him. Sherlock blinked in amazement as the spectre turned to him and grinned, several teeth were missing and well as a considerable amount of hair at the front.
John chuckled and stood next to his new husband. “You cock.”
"Yes. I can't think of any time when I was happier than when I had Redbeard. We did everything together." The scene faded and was replaced by the same woodland, only the snow had gone. The winter sunlight replaced by gloom and rain. Sherlock recognised it at once and immediately looked at Archie, begging him to not show him this particular Christmas.
"Grandda!" John let go of Sherlock and leaned down to hoist Catherine onto his hip. "It's white!"
"Yeah. It's a bit old fashioned now. Reminds me of my gran, though. Can't have Christmas without eggnog." He carried on pulling a face and replaced it onto the shelf of the fridge door. "It's not like it's the worst thing that's ever been in there." He thought and nodded before smiling. "And no, that's not a challenge." The grin slid away and he shut the door with a bang before storming off.
"Harry." The taller woman put the glasses onto the table and shot her a look warning her to stop before things got out of hand.
"Absolutely! That's a gift."
Ten minutes later, the blanket was wrapped around both of them as they hugged together in the middle. Sherlock's head on John's shoulder, John's arm around his back.
“Busy – SH.”
"What?" The man on the bed didn't move, didn't even open his eyes.
She squealed with delight, leapt off the bed, ran to the iPad and started her research. Within moments, she returned, the two men now awake and sitting up, ready for their daughter to report her findings.
"Breathing is boring." He didn't move as Victor walked over to open all the curtains before throwing open a window to allow some fresh air to enter. He started to collect the rubbish that was laying about in a bin before turning to catch sight of a syringe on the desk. He stopped moving at once.
So there he sat. Alone. In a cold, dark room. On Christmas Eve. Clutching one of John’s old jumpers to his face. Taking deep breaths, imagining the lingering scent of his friend. Wishing more than anything that he could go back.
"Sherlock!" Victor stood and Sherlock marched over to him, face-to-face, his breathing heavy and angry.
"John! How could you possibly think I would do something like that."
"How could you even suggest such a thing?!"
"What did you do?"
"Isn't that a bit unprofessional?"
"Because you're a total cock and you've been whinging about me going to my sister's for Christmas for weeks now. Don't tell me you wouldn't try something underhand to make me stay."
"No more shots have been fired recently but he will keep stabbing the bills into the mantelpiece. There was a Cluedo board sticking out of the wall when I left."
John turned to his flatmate and stared at him, puzzled.
Christmas had gradually lost its lustre as the years went by. Decreasing by slow increments ever since he deduced that Santa wasn't real and that it was Daddy who was eating the mince pie and quaffing the sherry Sherlock had so carefully laid out each Christmas Eve. That and the fact that Fatcroft kept making snide comments as Sherlock wrote out his letter every year, diligently posting it in the special box in the village shop. When the magic was finally blasted away, so was the innocent joy Sherlock had once had at Christmas. Now he simply hated everything about it. This year was looking like it was going to be worse than ever.
"I don't know, Harry. I don't know what he is to me." Sherlock's hand stopped and hovered not quite touching lest he disturb the scene, waiting to see where the conversation would go.
John was tired of always being cold in 221b. It was an old house and as everyone who has ever lived in one will know, they're always bloody freezing in winter. High ceilings, draughty windows and doors. No matter how much heat you put in, it inevitably ended up escaping through the cracks. Thermodynamics, he recalled Sherlock remarking one particularly chilly evening.
"Anything else? Anywhere we can visit?" Sherlock thought long and hard once again. "Hang on a second." The lad held up a hand and pressed the fingers of his other hand to his temple. "Right, just got a message from your uncle. He's got some ideas. It's always helpful when there's a member of the family around for ideas. Ready to go?"
Sherlock looked through the mess that was his sock index. Why did they honestly think he'd keep his stash tucked away with his socks? Did they think him so lacking in any imagination? No. His stash was hidden far more securely than that. He doubted even Hudders would be able to find it and she could give the sniffer dogs at the airport a run for their money. As he sorted through the desolation, refolding and organising his socks by colour (to the exact shade of black), softness, length, toe seam ridge and material, he cursed himself once again falling for the old cigarette trick. Mycroft had got him with that one before. He could only put it down to shock at supposedly seeing The Woman's body, cold and dead on the slab just after she had sent him her most prized possession for safe keeping.
"Where are we going now?" Sherlock was still reeling from the remembrance of that Christmas when he had lost his best friend. Cancer had ended it for the beautiful, red-haired pup that had been his constant companion. He recalled the day his father had taken the dog to the vet only to return on his own, carrying the collar that Sherlock still kept in a box under his bed.
"Yeah, Sherlock. Film night. Coming?" John smiled over at grumpy git sat in the kitchen. "You'll like this one. He reminds me of you." The look from Sherlock made John laugh and Rosie giggled along too.
"What?" Her brother snapped back.
"Yeah. You forgot one last, but very important, job of a best man." She almost laughed as she watched him mentally tick off all the things he was meant to have done today. "Yeah, the best man should always dance with the maid of honour." He nodded as he caught on to her suggestion and simply nodded towards the dance floor.  "No, it's too warm in here. Let's go outside, yeah?" He nodded again and grabbed his coat anyway. Obviously he was expecting to exit as soon as this last and unexpected duty was performed.
Tired. He’s so tired. In the last thirteen months, he’s averaged maybe fifteen hours sleep a week. Always running. Always tracking down the next link. Always fighting to keep the loneliness and panic at bay. He’s not sure how much more he can take at this point. Staying one step ahead is exhausting. Having no one to watch your back like…
I had the glass ready, and the rum. Time to enjoy a class of comfort just as my Gran used to serve. I added the rum to the glass first, just a single shot and went to the fridge to get the carton. It was empty!
"Maybe he didn't know what to look at." He walked around her in a large circle, never getting too close, not letting her see anymore than he had already allowed her to observe.
It was all arranged. The two of them would travel to Sherlock's parent's for Christmas Day. Mycroft would send a car for them and transport Mary there as well. Everything was set. He was as recovered as could be expected having suffered catastrophic organ failure due to hypovolemic shock. Things would never be the same again but he would pretend otherwise. For John.
There was no clock striking or, in fact, any noise other than the damned alarm Sherlock had set for five to midnight. He had tried to sleep, following the advice given by the ghostly apparition of his uncle Rudy. But by the time he had shaken himself together after the encounter, it was after ten and the flat was cold and still in darkness. He stood and walked to the fire, lighting it and sat in his armchair in front of the flames. It was completely unbelievable. He once again checked for recent track marks on his arms. He performed a systems check to see if he was under the influence of any form of drug that might have been slipped into something he ate. Except he hadn't eaten anything since a mince pie around noon. Maybe that was it, low blood glucose. Better have another mince pie to make sure. But no, as he was eating the pastry, he knew that wasn't right either.
"John." He walked out his bedroom and straight to the coat rack to grab his coat and scarf only to find them missing. He turned to look at the other man, suspicion rising. "Where?"
No possible explanation he came up with fit and invariably left more questions than each theory answered. He was tempted to message his brother to ask him about any strange behaviour ever shown by their uncle (other than his predilection for wearing very summery dresses in the middle of a London winter) but he feared that this might cause Mycroft to march him off for evaluation. John would see it as merely a ploy to get him home early. No, there was no one to talk to and nothing to explain it all fully. He was alone and stumped.
"Yes, John. Obvious, really." He was wearing only his sheet, an outfit John had seen him wear often, most notably at Buckingham Palace. The ashtray was still one of his most prized possessions. John watched as Sherlock stood, allowing the sheet to drape but not fall, covering him modestly, if that was at all possible in this situation.
"Why don't you go with Mycroft, to your parent's?" Sherlock whirled round to face John, a look of abject horror on his face.
Slowly, Sherlock became aware of the spirit again and focused on him.
"Well, again, we used to but it took a lot of planning and the union said that we shouldn't be responsible for that aspect. We're just the facilitators. Top brass wouldn't fork out for an administration department so it's up to you now."
"Well, use your deductive powers."
back for a change. John’s back. John. His only friend. The heart of him.
"Get on with what?" Mrs Hudson looked at her sister and mouthed the word 'SEX' at her. Sherlock saw and blushed, looking away from her face as she smiled with glee.
"Well, there was that beheading a few years ago. That was quite memorable."
“Happy Birthday Sherlock! Will you be my Da? Love Rosie” He whispered the words written inside.
"This was the year when I asked for a friend in my letter to Santa. I didn't have any, you see. I had started school in September and no one would talk to me. Called me a freak. Made fun of my hair. So I requested someone to play with and I was listened to. Redbeard was my best friend." Sherlock continued to stand and watch as his younger self played with the puppy.
John thought. His heart hammered in his chest as he watched the sheet-clad god stalk towards him. "You do want to, don't you, John? Admit it." Sherlock stood so close that John could feel the heat radiating through the fine cotton. All he could do was nod. Yes. He did. Very much so.
Sherlock had complained when John had first suggested them. Why would you hang edible things on a tree?! But twelve canes became eleven, then ten. There was only one person in the house that could be responsible and he was six foot tall with curly hair.
"It's Mycroft, mother." She looked at him in fond remonstrance and awaited the answer to her actual question. "He's fine. I've put extra surveillance in the flat and I have the best people monitoring him for any suspicious activity." Sherlock grit his teeth upon hearing, the planned phone call in the morning quickly being dashed off his to-do list.
"She sounds like a harlot."
"I am far too preoccupied with the present." Another draw on his pipe, exhaling the smoke leisurely. "What are your thoughts?"
He takes hold of his mug, hands shaking as he brings it to his lips. Smiling, he recalls the afternoon. John collected Rosie and they all met Molly at a cafe. It was…nice. He laughed for the first time in months. John laughed too.
“What I don’t understand,” John says, pocketing his mobile, “is what Brook has to do with whoever is singing that twisted lullaby.”
And the one time Sherlock agrees with John – on how caring is a distraction – John finds himself feeling disappointed anyway.
death threats?” He starts pacing the room. “No, don’t tell me. It’s glaringly obvious. This is what you have all been hiding from me. Me! You think
“Stop it. Stop it right there.” And as Sherlock pauses, John opens his floodgates. “See, this is the problem. When it comes to the two of us, I am always your number one priority, regardless of the consequences for you. Yes, I did well in restraining you before you could put a scalpel through Culverton Smith but hitting you like that after was. Christ, it was unnecessary, it was violent, it was not okay, it was

“I sent you a letter. You never replied, so I thought maybe you didn’t get it, or. I don’t know.”
As I move closer to the closet, the floor creaks--ever so slightly--beneath my weight.  I slowly open the door to reveal--more carpet. Bingo.
“Hello, Ms. Watson.  Is he all right?”
“I’ve—got something in the works,”  He says, shifting uncomfortably against the worn leather sofa.  “There’s still much to do, but—I suppose I’m—”  He sighs, setting his plate on the floor in front of him.  “I’m planning on converting the flats into a halfway house for substance abuse recovery,”  The silence that follows is stifling, each of them a bit blindsided.  Eventually, Greg coughs, having choked on whatever he was chewing, and Molly slaps him on the back.
technically, but he’d shown up just before things had begun to get weird, Greg never trusted him one bit—and he is almost certain he’s the one who first suggested that Sherlock was a sham.  A low-ranking constable, he was there for all of it, hovering on the sidelines for the most part.  He’d resigned just after Sherlock’s death, never to be heard from again.
I stand staring down at my bed—hands on hips—at two very different options of apparel I’ve laid out.  On the left, a black suit. My daily getup. Trustworthy attire. Also quite likely to make me stand out like a sore thumb in this town of bikinis and board shorts.  On the right, slim black jeans and a fitted white t-shirt. I know which to choose. Obviously I do. But must I?
