“Fuck, Sherlock,” he rasps, turning his head to catch Sherlock's lips, pliant and pleading for more.
are my priority.“
They stayed snuggled in each other’s arms for a couple of long minutes, in silence punctuated by nothing but the sounds of them crying. As soon as Sherlock finally came back to himself, John pulled back a little and cradled his face, placing a fair kiss over his forehead and another one over the temple of his head.

I wanted to do the same to Mary, but… then I’ve realised that she is not going to suffer enough that way. I want to see her

“I-I mean, if we stay. Are we going to keep, you know... playing boyfriends?”
“My God, you look...”
Sherlock didn’t say another word. He squeezed on the back of John’s shirt so tight that he could rip it apart, but neither of them cared. Sherlock simply needed to

, his own actions and the words he willingly said. Never before he so carelessly worn his heart on his sleeve. Reminding himself of the fact that he reached for Sherlock’s hand in public hit him all of a sudden, with full devastating force, mentally kicking out the breath of his lungs. Then again, Sherlock was the first one to take this step, he would now probably deny it, but it was
Hey, Sherlock. All good?

“Then we must not let him ask any questions. Keep walking.”

even. You want me against the wall, John, hm?“ Sherlock drawled, lazily drawing his fingers back up John’s abdomen, his mouth watering at the mere thought of what was about to follow. He rubbed carefully along John’s nipple, across his scar and up his neck, passing two of his fingers right toward John’s parted lips, pausing only briefly before allowing John to suck.

Which isn't your fault. Look, Dr. Watson... We have no idea what exactly happened just yet but I suspect that Sherlock must have experienced rather lucid nightmares while he was comatose. Hence the ravings.
, just to make contact.
Few things John enjoys witnessing more than Sherlock’s face in the moment he figures something out. It is a remarkable sight even now, that John can’t actually see his eyes glinting with ecstasy. His jaw drops and cheeks turn red, no coherent words leaving his throat but as it turns out two seconds later he doesn’t need to ask any more. John’s tongue dipping into his belly answers all his questions.
A beat. Awkward silence.
It belongs to the culprit. One of them anyway.

Stop whining. Just listen. I have a little message for you.
“Just let him in for God’s sake,“ Mycroft professed, clenching on the handle of his umbrella.

John swallows loudly, heart pounding wildly. “N-nothing,” he stutters out, hastily withdrawing his hands. “I was just... fantasising. Not that I... I mean I
, Sherlock.“
“We don't have to go anywhere, you know,” he remarks, talking to the carpet for a moment before he meets John's eyes again. “If you don't want to.”
Sherlock flashed him a grin, making no other sound but a high pitched moan, clinging to John’s shoulders so hard he was leaving marks in his skin. He opened his mouth to goad John a little but John was already drawing back, quickly coating his cock before lifting Sherlock’s legs and thrusting into him for the first time.
“You remember it?“
221B. Focusing on a plump lady in her 60s, sitting in the client chair. This is Mrs. Merrilow.
Sherlock takes a quick glance at him, not surprised that he has been listening. Doesn't move an inch though.
, I am sorry, I-I was about to-to tell you but then-but you are so fucking perfect-“
Sherlock threw him only a brief glance, however, almost as if he was afraid of staring for far too long and giving away something he had no intention to yet. But even after he retreated to gazing at the fire he could sense that John just furrowed his brow, he was perplexed and perhaps even a little more worried than before.
-freezes. Staring his eyes out.
...It's been just a few days.
“No,“ Sherlock replied sadly. “Once I got to him he unfortunately detected me and then ran away. I didn’t catch him so I couldn’t have interrogated him.“
What are we waiting for?
“Alright, Sherlock?“
Sherlock, will you marry me?
“Don’t be absurd,“ Sherlock cut her off but Mary laughed at him some more.
Sherlock's doctor - Dr. Mason - steps out. A bit younger than John, raven hair, lovely. As she notices John, she flashes a half-smile.
“Are we playing games now?”
. I don’t know where I would be without you right now.“
“John,
Sherlock turns over, walks over to his chair, sits down.
SHERLOCK
, you gorgeous, extraordinary, beautiful, amazing, magnificent man.“
John snorts with contempt. Simmering underneath the surface.
This was exactly the reaction John expected yet he had hoped differently. His heart clenched at the mere sight of Sherlock rising up from the chair, his face dejected and no spark in his azure eyes.
Shouldn't I give you my number? I... I mean, in case I remember-
You spoke to me, didn't you? That night. Your voice... your voice wasn't a part of a...
Nothing had changed. Not even once Sherlock blinked to open his eyes again after an achingly long while. The angel was still there, towering above Sherlock with its wings spread wide and hands folded peacefully across its chest, green vines of ivy draped around its stone frame. Not nearly as terrifying as Sherlock first deemed it to be. He stared at that serene, solid face, breathing deep and heavily until he calmed down again, enough so he could finally wipe away the tears that had flooded his face.
What a pair you two make.

“It’s me or
“Sherlock, I am fine, okay?“ he assured him, stroking his arm. “Just a bit tired, but that’s quite a standard turn of events. I am
Sherlock stares and stares. Blinks once. Twice. Dumbfounded.
The moment their lips touch, the rest of the world ceases to exist. In an instant, John cradles Sherlock's face in his hands and ever so lovingly caresses his cheeks with his thumbs. Sherlock's lips are as soft and honey-sweet as John remembers and as equally electrifying, impelling him to kiss even more eagerly. Judging by the whimpers vibrating deep in Sherlock 's throat, he seems to be more than happy to deepen the kiss.
These two are better. Three weeks. Four robberies. No clues.
Sherlock looks back at John.
There's a few seconds of silence. Sherlock - staring at John with bated breath, beyond anxious.
,“ he snarled in a tone of pure exasperation.

Before John’s eyes fluttered shut, it was all there. Devotion. Care. Love. All the reasons why he decided to take the hit instead of Sherlock. It was there and Sherlock couldn’t act as if he didn’t notice. He caressed John’s face ever so gently, merely breathing at the sight of his weakest self. It happened again, John’s life was in danger and again, all because of Sherlock.

John doesn't even peep. Doesn't want to concern the landlady with more bad news about Sherlock.
“Weak-weak spot? Ridiculous.“ Sherlock’s voice rose higher he intended it to, almost as if he already lost all the control he ever possessed.
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing here?“

Sherlock sighed, slightly disappointed, upon receiving no reply, but John fortunately quickly managed to fix the mistake he’s almost done.
-but John says no more. Can't bring himself to speak.
Sherlock pursed his lips. “

Yup. Look at the last entry. Four months ago.
CUT TO:
John wakes up feeling the warm caress of sunlight on his face. With a yawn he opens his eyes, at first a little disoriented, but it’s not long before the memories of what happened last night begin to unfold in front of him.
SHERLOCK
After a few seconds, Sherlock pulls away, only an inch just so he can speak.
Like what?
“We were just
Once uttering those words John disappeared behind the door at last, leaving Sherlock all by himself.
MYCROFT
“John, it’s just a-ouch. It stings,“ Sherlock pouted, frantically rubbing his fingers over the small wound.
Alright. Sherlock, you have to listen to me-
That was the plan. But plans change, John. I had not expected to fall in love, but I did and I... I wanted to quit, I swear. Magnussen was supposed to be my last kill. He knew too much. All I wanted, was to free myself from my past and have a family.
“I suppose he's trying to figure out who the hell the two blokes that have been stalking him for the past few days are. Can't blame him, I guess.”
Nothing. Just... Thank you.

Albeit reluctantly, Sherlock has to get off John and endure the twenty lonely seconds without him while he returns from the bathroom with a couple of wet tissues.
for causing him so much pain. This wasn't the plan. Sherlock didn't expect that his death, albeit temporary, would leave John in such a dark, horrendous place.
“I-I…I don’t think so,“ Sherlock sighed heavily, his voice hoarse and raw. “Can you-John, can you hold me, please?“
“Trying to make me laugh to make it easier for me to talk.“
, as long as you allow me to be all yours. From tonight on, forever.“
-and they're giggling, uncontrollably, but only for a moment before they start kissing again.
(We hear the sound of a shower) On the bathroom door and Sherlock in front of it, knocking.
?“ he chuckled, gently blowing off the hot steam before taking the first sip.
. You expect that Mary would shot me in the middle of a street if I dared to leave my burrow? She doesn’t work like that, I am not as endangered as you think.“
“That’s okay,“ John giggled but then a fresh wave of pain in his torso pacified him and his grin turned upside down within a second.
Can I join you?
How are you feeling?
“Don’t ‘Sherl’ on me, John. I am going to track Mary down and she will pay for everything she’s done. Especially for this.“ Sherlock made a vague gesture in the air, pointing toward John in hopes he was going to catch on. Suddenly he didn’t feel like talking so openly about how his, hopefully soon to be ex-wife, marked him for the rest of the life.
“I am
“Jesus, Sherlock, you have no idea-“ he licked a stripe up and down Sherlock’s pale neck, then kissed once again before taking a pause and pressing his mouth under his chin.

Sherlock - utterly pale, astonished, freezing.
Sherlock swallowed nervously, a hint of uncertainty sparkling in his weary eyes. He could either be honest at last, or he could continue lying to John, which, however, was completely in contrast with the decisions he’d made earlier.
MYCROFT
“No-no big deal? What happened? Didn’t I tell you to be careful if you’re going- where even you’ve been?“
“God knows, I wasn't entirely sure at first, probably not until now even but it's time to face the truth...it just

“He can't even tell the difference between

Panning to John and Sherlock, sprawled on the sofa. They're both fast asleep now. Sherlock half-lying on John's shoulder, his arm draped over John's torso. John has his arm wrapped around Sherlock.
? Sounds you already have a suspect, who?“ John frowned.
What was that about?
“I wouldn’t count on it, John.“ Mary felt everything but fear. There was even a smirk on her face, one that was supposed to alert them that she is the one in charge and they are supposed to play by her rules.
So was I.
Thick steam fills the room, serving as a transition effect.
?“ Sherlock stiffened in confusion, mid-way towards the bed.
about... you. Jesus, I should shut up.”
“Your-your shirt?“ Sherlock blinked and swallowed then opened his mouth but asked no more questions. They slowed down all of a sudden, as if they weren’t even about to devour each other’s faces few moments earlier. John let Sherlock grip and strip off the cloth, chuckling shyly once Sherlock seemed like he forgot how to breathe as his eyes glided over John’s bare chest. Not that he’d never before seen John shirtless, but it happened just a few times and it was a short, barely a glimpse of moment. John used to be insecure about his body and whenever Sherlock accidentally seen him half-naked he’d rather quickly stormed out or kicked Sherlock out of the room but since they were now together there was naturally no reason. John didn’t even mind that they acted as teenagers who were experiencing this kind of contact for the very first time. He wanted to enjoy each moment with Sherlock, take it slowly so he could remember every second of them kissing and touching each other.
Suddenly, Sherlock chuckles.
“Oh… So I was right, wasn’t I?“ Sherlock chortled, entwining his legs firmly around John’s waist.
MYCROFT
he asked himself while frantically pacing around the room. Whenever Sherlock was experiencing one of his tantrums, John was usually the only one who was able to reason with him. And even if everything else failed and no kind words or death glares were of any help, John still somewhat miraculously found a way to get to him.
And so do you.
Sherlock’s face ever so slightly saddens. He seems to be genuinely disappointed with John’s response. “Alright, then. I understand... Well, I can always ask someone else-”
Suddenly, Sherlock pipes down. Purses his lips, throws a brief glance at John then turns around, walks toward the window.
Sherlock chortles.
Not even Mary?
They've reached the front door, John unlocks the door, lets Bonnie inside-
, I am fine. I
Almost as if he expected it, Sherlock groans in response and rolls his tongue inside John's mouth, drawing a surprised little whimper out of him. John is vaguely aware that Harrington has come to a stop but to be fair, he couldn't care less to check on him. He's got much more important things to do. When he pulls back it's only because Sherlock has begun mumbling in between kisses.
Almost immediately, another text appears on screen: I know. I am sorry.
“Where are you going with this?“

Leonardo?? That... That is impossible.
How many times, Sherlock. A fridge is a place where you store food, not body parts.
SHERLOCK
“Okay, fine. I don't need to hear that anyway,” John snapped back, but God, was it a lie. Sherlock had implied
“Sherlock, we really shouldn’t-“
Sherlock’s actions were reduced to nothing but snivelling upon being presented with such a horrific picture. He felt the fluid soaking all through John’s clothes, his own hands and scarf were smeared with crimson blood as he desperately tried to stop it from leaking even though he was well aware of that it is mostly useless. John was dying and Sherlock panicking, he was frantic in fact, cursing himself for reacting so slowly and foolishly before.
With a sigh, John hurries to rinse his mouth and heads back into the bedroom but the very moment he walks through the door, he freezes like a deer in the headlights. He finds Sherlock sitting at the mahogany desk, peering intently at the screen of
SHERLOCK
God, yes.
Contrary to popular belief, Mrs. Hudson, I do not know everything. You have to be more precise. What are you talking about?
Neither he nor John can be certain what exactly is happening, why they’re walking down the street like this, swinging their hands and giggling like a couple of enamoured teenagers but
“John, you’re missing the
“Well, there had been no need before,“ Sherlock shrugged, murmuring under his breath. “We used to live together.“
Never mind.
Mrs Hudson?
“Just one more thing, that's all I need to know,” John said a few moments later, wiping the corner of his eyes with the back of his hand. “What did you expect would happen, hm?”
SHERLOCK
“John, please-“
Vicar looks around.
Desperate to retain his composure, John avoids looking at Sherlock's lips at all cost, knowing that if he did, no force on Earth or elsewhere could keep him from kissing Sherlock. Which, in itself, wouldn't be a problem. The problem would be to try and not get carried away again...
His voice trails off.
“Sadly, yes.”
I know, I know.
, John thinks to himself.
(lets out a small sigh)
“J-John?“ Whether Sherlock was more shocked or relieved to see him again, John couldn’t tell.
(smirks)
John's eyebrows fly up at Sherlock's unexpected request, but this time, he doesn’t hesitate. At least not long enough to miss his chance. Instead of simply letting Sherlock take the charge though, he carefully slips his hand into Sherlock’s, intertwining their fingers. He can hear Sherlock take a long shaky breath, he clearly didn’t expect John to make the first move. Truth be told, John himself didn’t expect it. And in turn, feels like a teenage boy again. It’s kind of ridiculous, he thinks, he
he might as well never...
Yes, we did.
“Mhm... You can make it up to me by not protesting and eating your breakfast for once.”
In the background, we see Sherlock running down the stairs, putting his jacket on. As he goes through the door, John and Lestrade's eyes go to him. A beat on John - looking Sherlock up and down. Can't help it. Lestrade is oblivious to this, still, looks flabbergasted. He narrows his eyes at Sherlock.
John opened his mouth to respond but it happened to be impossible through the lump in his throat. “God, you’re such an idiot,“ he blurted out at last, shaking his head in disbelief. A poor choice of words this time, words John regretted saying immediately once pronouncing them. And yet he didn’t seem to know what to say next, not until the silence that had filled the air again became simply too heavy to bear.
difficult. It was John's wedding day, after all...
”Well then, I guess we have to go out tonight and... start anew,” Sherlock suggests. “There’s a fancy restaurant on the first floor. How about... a romantic dinner?”
Sherlock’s smile but widens though. “What makes you think he’s not going to be there?”
Sherlock slowly blinks to open his eyes, even a huger grin splitting his face once he glares at John’s smitten, glowing smile up close.
It lasted for only a couple of seconds. John pulled back as soon as he realised that Sherlock was still trying too hard and in a way that was anything but the right one.
I won't rest until I make sure he's okay. He-
“Too much trouble? Hell, Sherlock, you can’t just... you know. You could have, I don’t know,

Sherlock hasn't even touched his food yet. Stares at John, zoning out.
“I don’t know,“ Sherlock sighed, shutting the laptop. “Seems like Mary decided to toy with me in a very childish way… if I do say so myself. She knows I am after her but she’s also aware of that I
John strokes the back of Sherlock's hand with his thumb.
Sherlock looks mildly concerned. “Your face suddenly... fell.”
I’d like do to you afterwards, Sherlock,“ John giggles, shuffling further below so he can straddle Sherlock’s lap, his fingers gently stroking up and down Sherlock’s bare abdomen. “It’s all up to you. But if you
It wasn't until Sherlock heard the door slam that he finally perceived, but by the time he did, it was too late... John was already gone.
“Sherlock, what are you implying?”

SHERLOCK
John, concerned, disapproving, but doesn't raise another objection.
“I-I swear that I’ve tried to pull through and scramble back on my feet, but it’s futile,“ he bemoans. “I can’t even sleep, I am having nightmares. These memories,
On John and Sherlock, they're striding down a pathway, passing various animal exhibits. On their faces - furious, determined.
John can hear Sherlock mumbling something to his phone, but he's walking a little too far in front of him to discern any words and doesn’t really feel like slowing down. The prospect of locking lips with Sherlock has messed up with his head so much he ended up humiliating himself and now can barely imagine looking into his eyes without turning red.
CUT TO:
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Mary didn’t even blink upon being addressed by her true name. She casually, as if it wasn’t anything uncommon, pulled out a gun out of her purse instead, leaving her hand down however.
Sometimes, in that one moment particularly, it felt just like a dream. For a split second, Sherlock panicked that this was just another one of his hallucinations, that John was not in fact there, that he never came back to Baker Street and he was definitely not in Sherlock’s bedroom now, placing his own clothes next to Sherlock’s. But these vexatious thoughts were fortunately gone before they managed to scare Sherlock further.
Realising this conversation leads absolutely nowhere, Sherlock finally gives up and lies down to face John. He doesn’t try to fall asleep though. His mind is too full, too clogged with notions and thoughts, ninety nine percent of which involve John.
LESTRADE
“S-sexy you say?“ he grinned, licking his lips. They had never got so far as to actually make out properly, not while Sherlock was pinned up against the wall at least. Those past three weeks maybe were full of kisses and tongues exploring each other’s mouths, but more often than not, it was all still rather chaste and innocent and before Sherlock learnt the magic, also awkwardly clumsy. They maybe got heated up from time to time but each time it lasted for only a brief moment, without a promise of anything more happening just yet. Up until that day as it seemed.
Sherlock’s stomach tied in knots upon remembering those words. Why would John say that? Sherlock couldn’t quite comprehend the meaning behind those simple syllables, not even after scrutinizing each of them to detail. Not even the notion of John sacrificing himself made it any clearer, not the open love in his eyes, Sherlock saw it, but couldn’t understand it. He was still groping in the dark like a blind man, like there was nothing to read in between the lines.
John inhales, taking long, deep breaths, as if buying some time. “Please, don’t try to talk me out of it now,“ he implores. “If I now chicken out… I am afraid I’ll never again muster up enough courage. It’s not much but as long as you’ll by my side I’ll make it. I know I will.“
MRS. HUDSON
, stop chasing the people that were in contact with her, stop trying to gather information by interrogating dangerous thugs or whoever are those people. It leads nowhere. She either runs away or she has such a good cover that you’re never going to find her anyway. You know very well that I’ve never liked this idea of you trying to get to Mary on your own. I’ve agreed only because you promised me to be careful and that was before I’ve learnt about those threats. Sherlock, what if you simply accepted that-“
“Are you sure?“ John wavered, nervously picking his nails. “It’s a delicate topic.“
And you didn't like it.
SHERLOCK
- A fresh scar, not bleeding.
John is only half-listening, he can’t help but stare at Sherlock’s face
“Why are you laughing?“ Sherlock pouted, grabbing the nearest pillow so he could punch John over his shoulder.
“Well... do you?”
What? Retired??
Continuous: On the door as it opens. John and Mrs. Hudson enter the room, both come to a halt.
I'd rather be ignored.
“John, I’ve never been in a serious relationship before,“ Sherlock said in rather a sad voice, raising up to mirror John’s position. “
“I'll pay, of course. Regardless of results. A pretty large sum, I dare to say.”
His mouth falls open at the magnificent sight in front of him. To say the hotel where they're supposed to spend the following week looks impressive would be an understatement.
“Can I be honest?“ Sherlock bit his lip as if he felt guilty. “I am not sure in this very moment. I mean, I

“Yes, and it’s
“There’s something we haven’t discussed yet,“ Sherlock piped out after a while, scrubbing at what was left of the tomato sauce.

On Sherlock, peeking from behind the kitchen door.
“Oh, you mean the mad prick? He fell in love with the bravest man under the sun,“ Sherlock smiled but instead of rewarding him with a kiss in return, John nudged his chest, struggling to choke back a laugh.
“Probably housekeeping,” Sherlock sniggers and gently pecks John's tum. “They'll leave if we'll ignore them.”
,“ he yelped.
“T-too far? What are you talking about?“ John felt like his heart was stabbed with the sharpest knife. He finally braced himself to confess what he had thought he was going to keep hidden forever but instead of feeling relieved he was confused. Sherlock suddenly seemed to regret that he had to learn the truth.
“Oh, that's very generous of you.” Another burst of laughter escapes John's throat and as for Sherlock... he can't quite restrain himself either.
Sherlock gulps, trembling in shock.
I told you everything I remember.

He replied at last.

Especially once they enter the park, surrounded by crimson-gold birches and elms and chirping blackbirds, snuggling close to keep warm and making each other blush and laugh profusely in between sips of chocolate. Somehow it feels natural, like a proper date even, Sherlock thinks, even though he barely has any experience to tell.

Holding on John's face for a few moments. We hear a door creak, then footsteps patting down the corridor. John turns to look.

John reluctantly bit back the retort he had lined up (and it was a damn good one, too!) and pressed his lips together in a pout.

Especially when he was both.

“Alright,” he said, scooping her up once he caught his breath again (and while John lay over on his side, pretending to be someone who could laugh in their sleep), and carried her back to the nursery. As expected the crib was still latched and not a single toy or pillow was out of place, and he carefully lifted her over and set her inside.
...Uh-oh.
Sherlock was glad that he had his mouth covered…not just for the obvious reason, but so that Jawn couldn’t see him grinning like an idiot while stifling his laughter.
Stephen took one of the packets on the table and tore it open, then wrapped the tiny alcohol wipe and wrapped it around the tip of his gloved finger. “And this?!” He poked the other thigh, and rubbed a sterile patch on Tony’s skin. “Is that…no, is that a

“Awwww,” Molly sagged with disappointment. “Why’dja do thaaaaat?” she whinged at Sherlock.
That was all the invitation that Sherlock needed, as the next thing John knew, the little detective was scrabbling off the couch (and nearly tumbling head over heels in the process, but before John could leap of his chair to catch him, he’d already righted himself) and crawling into John’s lap. "Killin’ bir’s i'sh ba'h,” he said matter-of-factly, and squirmed around until he was situated in the perfect position…tucked in the crook of his Daddy’s arm.
Greg was glaring at the mess while wondering if getting the broom from the closet would help, or if that was just a thing they did in cartoons. “Yeah?”
Bucky hid his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, and Steve could feel the little pats of warms tears dripping onto his shoulder.
Loki sighed, and then reached into the open make-up kit sitting next to her and began to dig around. “Wait, here…!” she said, fishing out an older (but clean) brush that had never been her favorite, even when it was new. She handed it to Tony; “Have that one, Bambi.”
“Uuumm...Da’yee!”
There was a painful twinge between Bucky’s legs, and he squirmed uncomfortably…he had to go.
“Okay, so…okay.” Steve grabbed the box and pulled it towards him. There was no tape holding it closed. “So, you know how…so, sometimes you have trouble making it to the potty? When you’re in big boy pants?"
okay, and his eyes were continuing to water. He reached up to touch his still aching nose, his breath coming in short, shallow hitches because yes,
“Don’t ‘
Mama was good at this, and knew it. She would often use it to her advantage, especially on those who mistakenly thought they were immune to Mama’s magic, and who often turned out to the most susceptible.
"Dear my wonderful amazing mama who I love so much: will you write Bagginshield for day 10? With Bilbo bein all embarrassed that he needs a change? 😊"
Which, thinking back, may not have been the most prudent of decisions, for Greg just shrugged back at him; “It’s a special occasion, love,” he said. “Let ‘em squeeze out the last bit of Halloween magic.”
“Me too,” he said, and kissed Jawn on the cheek as he carried him out of the room.
“Um…what if we did, y’know, a couple smacks? And call it even?”
“And no park on Saturday.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and peered at him for a beat longer...then popped his thumb out of his mouth, whirled back around, and began to whisper in his brothers’ ear.
“I! Hel'bed! Ma'ge! Fudge!” Harry giggled breathlessly with each jump upon his Daddy’s bed. His bed was the best for jumping, because it was big and wide and extra springy…!
“I did no such thing.”
“Po’ddy?” Bucky crouched down at floor level to look her in the eye. “B’yue po’ddy?”
Doubly so when he reopened his eyes and dared to peek up again, only to be met with a big, whiskery kiss to his forehead.
As Mycroft pulled off the tall, black stilettos he’d (foolishly) chosen to wear that night and ascend the stairs, Greg turned his attention away from the way the slinky fabric clung to his lover’s hips, and clapped his hands for the boys. “Right! What’re we watching tonight, lads?!”
Oh. Oh, no. Oh no, no no no no no no.
“Well, no…” Bilbo began to say that he didn’t really mind, because they’d dry just as fast by the fire, but before he could utter another word Thorin was hauling him up and sitting him on his hip before splashing through the stream.
“S-sorry,” she gasped, snapping her hips in time with his flicking.
“RONALD!” Molly scolded while Arthur began to cackle.
Bucky sucked on the spout of his sippy-cup despite the fact that it had long since been empty, and watched the opening of the show as he pressed his thighs together and shifted from foot to foot.
Normally, this would be the type of silence that Sherlock would dissolve into, retreating far back into his own thoughts, where nothing short of an explosion would bring him back out.
“That’s because you’re so terribly clever,” Mycroft said, drawing his crying little brother into his lap. “We had a bit of a scare though, didn’t we?”
Sherlock literally slapped his forehead. A coat hanger. A
The smile quickly left Gregs’ face. He was just kidding...he didn’t think that was
“Dwalin’s not one to mess with, burglar. You were bound to find out one way or another.”
Which was fine with him. Smaller Harry was a snuggler, Severus had no greater need right now than to wrap him up in a blanket and give him his bedtime bottle by the fire.
While he worked Bucky’s pants down his thighs, Steve considered himself lucky that he was
“Yeah, good job! That’s what Blue says!” Steve went to lower Bucky’s pull-up; “You wanna try and use it for real this time?”
“That’s different! You gross children…!”
Mycroft’s shoulders slumped, and he looked to Greg for help.
He hardly even ate poptarts anymore. One box a week, at best.
The smell hit him first, making him draw back and taking his breath in a short gasp. Heavy, Pungent.
There was the sound of snuffling behind a conveniently-sized Hobbit-shaped stump and, as Thorin rounded it, he found the source of the snuffling; “Bilbo.”
Mycroft felt his stomach flip and swallowed back a gag. “Nooooo,” he said, pushing Jawns’ hand back down. “Thank you, sweetheart, but you can keep those
But anyway, he would go down on one knee and thank anyone who was listening, that he had Bucky back. His Little Bucky. Or, his once-big-then-little-then-bigger-again-but-now-mostly-Little Bucky.
being a Mama. He loved having so many dumplings flocking under his wing now, especially his lovely little fiery-haired (with a temper to match) malyshka, who was his, and only his.
"✨Day 19 Baby Harry with CG Ron/Hermione ✨"
Thor gave Steve a bounce in his arms; “Of course. A ‘playdate’, he said. Does the idea appeal to you?”
“Maaaaamaaaaa!” Tasha wailed as she sank to the floor at Loki’s feet right in the middle of the very crowded cafe they were supposed to be having lunch in.
Dick folded his arms over his chest with a huff and tucked his chin down.
Blue was gonna get a bath. And Stee'b was turning on the water for her.
It had been quiet, but then again, his little guy was always pretty quiet and rarely got up to no good…so it being too quiet didn’t always mean he had a disaster waiting for him.
Bucky giggled and clapped again, “Goo’job, goo’job!” he cheered.
“Shut up, Tony’s better at nicknames.”
“Speak for yourself,” Greg muttered, and the snapped his head back as Sherlock, for the umpteenth time, went to apply the eyeliner.
Sherlock’s frown turned into a sneer, and directed it at Greg; “Mycroft’s right, you swear far too much,” he said. “And you know just how much it pains me to admit that, so that should be taken into account.”
Steve finally shut up. He stared at her intently, and for a long, long time.
"Sick Tony with Cg Thor (and/or Bruce) for Day 21 please"
Thor still didn’t know what the hell that meant, but before he could push the argument further, Tony snuffled into his neck and began to cry.
“Huh?…” Bucky rubbed his eyes and sat up, and…
Greg forced a cough to counteract the (quite frankly) obnoxious chortling noise that he was still making, and wiped the tears out of his eyes with the heel of his hand. “G-Greg’s s-sorry, muffin-” He stopped to clear his throat and cough again...there, that ought to do it. The last thing he wanted to do was make the baby cry again. “Baby, I’m sorry,” he said again, and meant it. “I really am. I’ve said it a hundred times, and I’ll say it a million more until you believe me.”
He knew what that meant.
The last item, though, was the one that Harry was
Sherlock was always a poor sleeper anyway, and although being in headspace made it somewhat easier to get him to go down for the night, it wasn’t always a sure thing that he would
“Go potty.”
Mycroft brushed a tangle of long, black hair from his wig out of his face (and his mouth); “ALRIGHT, darling, alright! What is it?!”
A small smile spread across Steve’s lips. “To’nee?!”
Of course, Harry did
“Silly boy…here, come show Daddy everything you got from the Weasley’s. You clearly made out like a bandit,” Severus said, placing another kiss on Harry’s shoulder as he carried his little one over to his bags. “Like this,” he said, plucking at the cozy, plush onesie he was wearing. “Who thought to give my little fawn his antlers?”
Sherlock sat back, propped his arm up, and set his chin on his hand as he creaked the rocker back and forth, slowly.
Not much had changed in the hours since Jawn had awoken with a rather rocky start to the second half of his day...but really, there was only so long one could sit in an already uncomfortable seat with an overgrown infant settled on your legs with his bony little backside digging in just the right spot to make them go all pins-and-needles.
“Young Steve!” he said jovially, clapping his hands together in excitement. “What shall we partake in first this evening?! A race with the Karts of Mario? A hunt for eight-legged beasts at the Animal’s Crossing? Or–”
Bucky stuck his thumb in his mouth, and looked up at Steve.
“Forgive me if the idea of a baby with a pencil right next to my very vulnerable eyeball makes me twitchy.”
He smiled to himself. It was soon to be a whole new year, but there were some things that would never really change.
John came up behind his chair (because, of course Sherlock had chosen
Steve grinned as he taped a clean diaper nice and smug around the little guy’s hips. “I bet I can eat more than you!”
Harry could feel the fire start up behind him, the flames creating a lovely, glowing heat at his back.
Now, though? Now, he’d woken up in the dark, in a bed (with cold sheets, at that!), by himself. Alone.
It was naturally soothing, of course, and with Sherlock having an overwhelming need for oral fixation, it also gave him one central focus for all of the restless, pent up energy that sleepiness nights left him with.
John smirked to himself. “And havin’ a lie-down doesn’t mean you’re tired.”
Now, there was a fail safe built into the bottom of the crib in case of emergency, in the form of a trapdoor under the mattress…but every single time Sherlock or John were awoken by their tiny escapee climbing into bed with them (or by getting into something she shouldn’t and making an awful lot of noise), that would be the first thing that they checked.
Ah, that was better. Food usually made most things better…at least to Hobbits. He leaned back against Dwalin’s chest, having almost forgotten who’s lap he was sitting in, then folded his hands over his comfortably full belly and closed his eyes. He thought that he felt the small motion of being gently swayed, almost like laying in a hammock…
have been; Mycroft had already sussed that out from the very first time he’d seen his little brother interact with the inspector, and nearly every moment thereafter. Even without knowledge of certain...aspects, of Sherlocks’ life, Lestrade had unknowingly filled a paternal sort-of role that even the youngest Holmes brother had not known that he needed filled.
Bruce kept his expression blank. It was a fit, yes, but an adorable one.
Harry snuggled in deeper–this was his favorite way to lie, tucked in close enough to feel the rumbling of Severus’s voice against his cheek when he spoke, letting it roll over him in a warm, baritone wave.
Oh. Uh-oh.
“T-try,” Bucky snuffled. Steve could feel him wiping his snotty face all over his t-shirt. “Yeah, you did. Just too little for big boys pants today, that’s all.”
“Smart boy, you’re right.” John kissed the top of his curly head, and didn’t even mind all that much when he came very close to getting clocked in the nose when Sherlock stretched. “Daddy was just being silly.”
Sherlock continued to watch her, dumbstruck, as she unlatched the panel and slithered her way out, making sure to close it behind her, and crawled out from under the crib with…
"That last one shot got me remembering how much I love little Molly! Could we get another Molly for day 28? Maybe she keeps finding a way to get out of a crib during nap time/bedtime?"
“I can still bend you over my knee.”
One has to remember that there is a direct correlation of how small Sherlocks’ headspace is, to how sensitive he is. During his ‘tiny’ days, just so much as a harsh look his way can leave him in tears. Doubly so when he happens to come down with a low-grade fever, thanks to seasonal allergies (although with everything considered, Mycroft thought they had come out very, very lucky).
!” Stephen tucked the syringe close to his wrist, out of sight, and turned back to Tony with his biggest, brightest smile. “My sweet, precious, oh-so-big brave boy! Can you sit very, very still for Daddy?!”
Sherlock wilted against John as he had a good cry…he’d only wanted to wear his Elsa dress because it was pretty, and Mycroft’s party was going to be fancy, and he had nothing fancier than his Queen Elsa dress! And he wanted everyone to see it! And it was perfect, because it was blue, and snowflakes were supposed to be blue, a’cause Frozen, and Elsa could make snow, and–!
receiving new clothes (especially little skirts and dresses), would be over the moon with such a pretty new dress, but when his little one turned around, John was surprised to see him pouting. "What’s the matter, darling? Did Daddy tie it too tight?” John tucked a finger in the sash to see.
“You’re lucky you’re cute,’ Severus said, and playfully whumped his hand against the back of Harry’s nappy. “Let’s see, something new…” he mused and slipped the nipple of his little one’s mouth; “Do you know the story of Amaria Merona and the Pesky Pixies?”
Mycroft gently took that hand in his own, and kissed those sad little fingers. “Gregory had to borrow him, darling, but only for a little while.”
Nat sighed; “Baby, please,” she said, touching her forehead to his; “I just…Mommy loves you
“I’ll put you back on the couch, aaaaall by yourself.”
, take an explosion (of sorts) to draw him out of his mind palace.
"Only one is mine,” Mycroft sniffed, and handed one of them back to Greg as he came down off the footstool.
Greg opened a top cabinet to the left of the sink and selected two sippy cups-
And speaking of leaks, he also noticed that the sippy of apple juice Bucky was holding on to with both hands like it was for dear life, was nearly empty. Again. As in, this had been the fourth time Steve had refilled it, and that had been ten minutes ago. “Hey, Bucky? Baby?”
There was a clatter from the kitchen as Steve dropped the spoon for whatever he was stirring and bolted out of the room, looking for Bucky. “What happened!?” he asked, hurrying over to a sobbing Bucky and looking him up and down to see where he was hurt. There was nothing obvious that he could see, so Steve knelt down and–
The mood around the small fire was light and easy, the drink was strong, and the food, sparse as it was, was filling. Calling for an early camp and giving everyone a much-needed break seemed to be what everyone needed.
Thorin slowed his steps until he could hear the distinct shuffling of distracted Hobbit feet coming up behind him, and then he placed his hand out to catch Bilbo and keep him from going forward. “Just wait with me a moment,” he said, feeling the Hobbits’ puzzled look upon him.
He dropped his cup and tried to hurry, but by the time he got to his feet he was far, far, far too late, and the next thing he knew, there was a hot flood of pee filling his pull-up and trickling down his legs.
A gloved hand reached through, and placed a bottle of children’s chewable Tylenol into Bruce’s waiting hand. It disappeared, and then reappeared with Tony’s favorite Cookie Monster bottle, already full of what Thor assumed to be warm milk. Bruce took it, and then the hand reached further until it gently booped Tony on the nose, making him smile and gurgle.
...A l o n e.
John should be grateful. He knew this for a fact, and indeed he was…he knew how much of a privilege it was that he could work from home and see patients through video conferences, instead of being face to face and oh his feet for hours upon hours upon hours in a veritable warzone, with no break in sight.
Jawn sat up and rubbed his eyes. It was dark. Much too dark for his liking. He didn’t even know where he was, it was so dark! He stretched his arm out and groped along the sheets blindly, until his fingers eventually bumped into smooth, cold plastic.
He couldn’t look at them like this, not in just his…not in just his
It would have been terribly sweet, Greg thought, the scene playing out in front of him.
Judging by the meaty ‘
Dwalin sneaked a quick look over his own shoulder and grunted as well, much in the same manner. “Again?”
Molly clung to the bars on her tiptoes, looking awfully adorable in her p and pouted at him.
...Greg is so very, very sorry! Please stop crying, sweetheart, before your Daddy comes down and kicks my--!”
“Harry, what did I say about jumping?” Severus pulled out what must be Harry’s present from Molly, and actually smiled when enchanted whiskers on the bunny’s face swished at him. The woman knew how to knit a damn good jumper, he would give her that. “I’d rather not have to visit Madam Pomfrey at this hour for a bumped head,” he told his own little hoppy bunny.
It was so much. But he should still be grateful that he wasn’t a surgeon. He’d be a right fucking twat if he was going to sit and groan on about how hard it was to sit and talk to webcams for ten hours straight, when there were nurses on their feet for fifteen or more.
. And, he was sure that there were still marks all over the back of his thighs. There really was no good way to explain off a handprint the size of your entire arsecheek.
Greg held it up and gave it a critical look; “Yeah, but I’m pretty sure it was fuller than this when I handed it to you,” he said, making both John and Sherlock snicker.
’ noise at Greg’s back, fully knowing that for all his barking and threats, his bum was still very much in Greg’s ‘safe zone’, and still faaaaaar from getting a spanking.
Stephen Strange hated this time of year. No, it wasn’t because of the holidays; he wasn’t a Scrooge, for Christ'sakes. But that didn’t stop all the little ones at the compound from looking at him like a monster.
Okay, you know what…sure. He was going to take the time to put up the shopping. That would give him and the baby both the time and space to calm the fuck down. He started with the cold bag, and carried it to the fridge to put away; Butter, eggs. There was the milk. And another milk. And a third. Some ham. Bacon. Okay, there was that bag done.
“Aw, muffin…!” Greg began, but Mycroft quickly stopped him short; “Just turn the goddamn lights back on, Greg,” he said, going over to take his brother from Jawn.
“Aw, baby…” Stephen took Tony’s grasping hands, and placed soft kisses along the knuckles. “It’ll be over in a second, sweetheart, I promise!”
“I, I , I, w-wan’ned g-go toooo,” Steve cried, his chest heaving with every heartbroken sob.
Loki rolled his eyes…Midgardians could be incredibly slow. “You heard me. Come tell me what’s wrong,” Mama said as she patted her lap, inviting him over.
“Okay,” Greg sniffed, turning his nose (and his terribly smudged mustache) up in the air. “I know when I’m not wanted.”
He knew what those quiet nights meant, when there was nothing to do and no one to talk to except your own thoughts. He’d had plenty of those himself.
“Hmmm?” Jawn hummed blinking up at him. He’d heard the murmur of Daddy’s voice, but couldn’t remember a single specific word.
“--In the big bed, dear. With us.”
“NO! MINE!”
...If he hadn’t been the one to fucking thump the baby in the face, like an utter fucking
Greg blushed from the tips of his ears to the tips of his toes (probably), and cleared his throat. “Aw’right, be right back.”
“Bucky–”
Meanwhile, Mycroft had moved to the large dresser on the far side of their room and opened the very top drawer, and from there he withdrew the very large, very *heavy* paddle.
So, that night, when Sherlock was awoken at the bright and early hour of 3 am by a certain little Houdini plopping her pampered bottom onto his midsection and driving every particle of air out of his lungs, he was determined to figure this out once and for all.
Bucky frowned and shook his head, sippy-cup included.
“Dick.”
Greg swallowed thickly.
John pulled the dummy out again and held it up, giving Sherlock a nice, long look at the powder-coated nipple, and then stuck it back in his mouth. “MmmMmM!” he hummed, letting his eyes roll back in his head and sagging a bit on his knees, making a proper show about it.
it was only Loki–he didn’t know ‘Mama’ yet
Big, fat,  (mostly) crocodile tears rolled down Tony’s cheeks when he realized that no, he was not getting picked up and cuddled. He sank back against the Cloak’s soft folds, and began to cry.
Greg gave a shaky laugh into his boyfriend’s shoulder. "Yeah?”
“He can’t run around naked!” Ron shouted over Harry to be heard as he tried to wrangle him into his lap.
“There we are!” John said as he finished tying the bow with a flourish. “Turn around and let’s see how pretty!“
Though, Greg and Mycroft ended up doing most of the ‘lugging’ towards the end of the night, to be honest. “Darling,” Mycroft said, trying to keep the true depth of his weariness out of his voice; “It’s so very late, and you both still need a change, and a bath--” Despite himself, even just listing everything that still needed to be done before bedtime had Mycroft feeling every relentless year of his age.
Thorin sat up; “His wounds??”
"Sadie? Um, could we get more sweet daddy Snape and Harry for 29??? 🥺🥺🥺 Please!"
“No, I said it was a
“See, he heard us say ‘bottle’,” Bruce said as he inched closer, hands still held out, waiting.
“Later.” Then, without missing a beat, Bruce continued; “C’mon, man, you’ve had him all day! S’my turn to hold the baby!”
“N-noooo,” Dick stammered, furiously trying to blink back tears. He was in
Sherlock cupped his hand over his mouth and nose. “Oh,
Bilbo sucked in a breath as tender flesh met with the coarse leather and hides from Thorin’s outer layers, but it was far too late to kick up about it now that they were basically back in camp, with the dwarf making a beeline right for the crowded campfire.
“And that’s a bad thing?” Greg was dumbfounded...well, it’s not like it was a new feeling, not when you’re involved with this family in particular, but still. “Just open the bloody door and be done with it; Jesus Christ.”
Steve blew a puff of air between his lips…man, his heart was still pounding from hearing Bucky screech like that. “I’m not mad, baby. Don’t ever,
Sherlock frowned. That’s not what he’d been expecting. “Jawn, monkey, what’s the matter–?” he began as he stepped through the doorway…
Sherlock, while visibly confused, had gone quiet and was now very curious about what his Daddy was doing with his spicy apple juice.
That meant there was only one little one left.
“Hm. Three, but you’ll still have to nap and then apologize to the baby proper afterwards.”
He stumbled back, his foot sliding on the candy that had fallen and landing him square on his ass. The fist, refusing to lose its grip on him, followed with him and then...and then, Greg was staring up into Jawns’ face as he loomed over him, grinning wickedly.
Bucky got up from the kitchen table, the only place he was allowed to play with his playdough since ‘The Bed Incident’, and eventually found Steve in their bedroom, beaming like an idiot and watching Buck expectantly. On the bed, there sat a big-ish cardboard box.
It only took a few short (but they felt very long, indeed) minutes until Jawn stopped crying, and only another minute more before Jawn sat up once again, cheeks ruddy and eyes looking ever so sore and scratchy.
It was just that easy.
Nat took the opportunity to climb up and perch on Loki’s shoulders. “Hi’sh Dadd’ee doe’shn le’d him chew on sh’tuff,” she said, folding her arms on top of his head and resting her chin on them,
Mycroft had perched on the arm of the couch across from him with the baby on his lap (after freeing his nose), facing him. There was a beat pause (and a quiet sniffle) while Sherlock pondered the idea, then shook his head ‘no’.
“G'eg?” Jawn asked again, frowning as he watched Greg buckle him in. Needless to say, he was not a fan of the carseat. Same with baby leashes, or the high chair, or the crib (if he had to be in there by himself)…any sort of confinement, really.  “Where go'een?”
“Uh-huh!” Harry babbled. “I y’ub i’d!”
“Master Bruce.”
“You were thinking it.” Sherlock, who was currently laying face down, flat on the couch, turned just enough to glare at John with one singular light blue eye. “Just because I’m lying here doesn’t mean I need to nap.”
Thorin breezed right past him, and Bilbo stood there, bare-legged and in shock, before he gathered his wits and trotted after the dwarf. “Thorin, wait!” he hissed. “Give me my pants back!”
No...no, none of this was right! Not one bit of it!
“Bu’d!”
And since they did have a fair bit of sunshine left, they made the most of it; each of the men took a place along the bank and set about washing their things: shirts, socks (Mahal, there were
Sherlock, who’d long ago hidden his face in the fold of Jawns’ striped shirt, now peered out with one glassy-looking eye; “G-g’eg?” he asked, trembling.
"It’s Fine! 😭 I saw how happy you were for Harry and thought I could throw out some other fandoms I haven’t seen you write for yet . Maybe Jawn and Greg for Day 20 instead ?"
Of course, how was he expected to have noticed, when his Daddy was gone??? And he was by himself??? Alone!
Mycroft sucked in a quick breath; “Ooo, don’t do that, darling...ouchy!” Mycroft took Jawns’ hand and kissed it, just as he had earlier. “We’ll wash your face and you’ll feel so, so, so, much better,” he said, adding another kiss with each ‘so’. “But first, we need to change that bum of yours.”
“...Sto’b y’aughin’,” Sherlock said as all the righteous wind left his sails, leaving him slumped and wilted.
He tried to answer, he really did…but the moment he opened his mouth to speak, his throat clenched painfully, and no words came. He froze.
The little one didn’t give an answer, but neither did he scream or fuss when Mycroft took him by the shoulders and gently ‘helped’ him lie back, so he considered that a win.
Harry giggled to himself…it was always a little funny when on got in trouble, as long as it wasn’t too serious.
Sherlock slowly sat up, still looking a little shaky and crestfallen with his wet lashes and tear-stained cheeks, but…John had a plan. “So, we can’t wear the Elsa dress tonight, BUT-” he held a finger up as Sherlock’s bottom lip began to quiver; “-there
Bucky did as he was told, still frowning, and folded his arms over his chest.
“It’s fine,” Bilbo said stiffly.
“It’s only gone in the closet...for now.” Mycroft followed him, still glowing from the satisfaction of a well-done scare (and from a good scrub in the shower). “What movie did the little darlings pick? Casper? Goosebumps?” he asked again.
Bucky peeked around Steve and wrinkled his nose at the interior of the men’s restroom. The whole place smelled like stale pee, mildew, vomit, and alarmingly, the coppery smell of old blood. And a lot of the questionable puddles and streaks and smears on the wall likely took part in that.
“…I just wanted an excuse to get you to hand over the baby,” Bruce said, his shit-eating grin growing even wider. “Thanks, Stephen.”
“I’m still not all that fond of them now,” Sherlock frowned, rubbing his hands together from the chill in the air. “Nothing ever needs to be that noisy for any reason.”
“We named the wrong one ‘monkey’.”
“Never have I been more sure of anything in my entire life.” Mycroft kissed Jawns’ forehead, right between his eyes. “But if you happen to come across anything with toffee…”
, but that bloody thing HURT. “…Three?” he tried, weakly.
Then, along came John. And John found his place.
Greg jumped at the sudden voice behind him, and he whirled around to find a much cozier-looking Mycroft, tying the belt of his robe as he descended the stairs. Face still damp and reddened from scrubbing away his ghoulish make-up, he had a hint of a sparkle in his eye and a curl to the corner of his lips that wasn’t quite a smirk, but close enough. “Sorry...didn’t mean to scare you, darling,” he apologized, with a tone that didn’t quite match his words as much as it did the expression on his face.
“It was an
Sherlock had gone stiff at the sight of the dummy, expecting another round, but when he’d seen what John had done instead, he relaxed. He was also increasingly intrigued..
John smiled, and dipped his head at it; “Go on, it’s all yours if you want it…otherwise I’m just gonna take it for myself,” he added, and slowly started moving the dummy back towards his mouth…
And, he suspected correctly. “I, I’m n-no’d,” Jawn said, his face crumbling as he fell back on Mycrofts’ shoulder, muffling his cries. “‘m n’od, ‘m no’d!”
Mycroft opened his mouth to explain that
“I’m neither drunk nor a baby, Grissom.”
Mycroft was
"Steve/Bucky again for day 14? 🥺🥺🥺"
“You say'ed I c'n do a ma'ge u'bs!” Sherlock said, sounding close to tears as he was clearly upset by the lack of Greg’s confidence in his make-up skills.
The door to their bedroom was still cracked, the way he always left it for the little guy when he was napping, and Steve eased it open and stuck his head in. “…Buck?”
Greg had his chair reclined back as far as it would go, as you do when you’re havin’ a lazy day, and he and the tyke were giving the new ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ series a go. He was enjoying it so far, but the same couldn’t be said for Sherlock...between the lackluster reaction to the show and the steady hand patting the back of his nappy, Greg suspected he might have dozed off. Which would be a small blessing, considering the little guy hadn’t felt well at all.
noticed that Something Did Not Feel Right. He looked down at himself, and discovered that his onesie–which was a soft, light blue before his nap–was now stained dark from the waist down as he lay in the center of a damp, smelly puddle of quickly-cooling wee.
Now, here was where the chase was usually cut short, as Jawn hated any sort of timed limit. But again, there was no answer, and Sherlock raised an eyebrow in surprise as he came to a stop just before the doorway. “…Two.”
Christ, what a mess.
Everything that followed all happened at once, in the span of what could only have been a few seconds but still felt an eternity to Mycroft: a low, dreadful groan rattled out of Sherlock’s throat at the sound that quickly turned into a bloodcurdling scream from both of the boys (though Jawn would later say that he hadn’t, that it had all been Sherlock, but the ringing in Mycrofts' right ear attested otherwise) as a dim, red light flashed at the opposite end of the kitchen, under lighting the head of a massive wolf with its lips pulled back in a fearsome snarl, showing off its jutting fangs.
The lights went off, putting a quick end to both the movie, and Sherlock’s whinging.
“Gregory…”
He heard John snort, and ignored him. Sure, it was a cheap tactic, but Greg was not a prideful man and he certainly wasn’t above a little bribery if it meant he got to leave the house and go somewhere other than work or the shop.
, the hardest part.
Mycroft sighed and set his wine aside. “Gregory…” he implored.
“...Why did you thump the baby in the face, Gregory.”
“B’ampires!” Sherlock was positively gleeful.
Bilbo took one bite…and then ate ravenously, scooping mouthful after mouthful of surprisingly delicious beef and broth into his mouth, until his spoon was no longer sufficient and he used his bread to sop up the rest instead.
“Sherlock. Sweetheart. Muffin. You have to understand how upsetting it is to have a pencil point slowly approaching your eyeball.”
“Scary, huh?” Greg rubbed his chin, which further smudged the remnants of his mustache. “I dunno…”
The hand gave a thumbs up, and then retreated. The portal then closed.
-“You!”-
Greg stared back at him, chest heaving, heart pounding in his ears, wondering whether ‘little shit’ was the appropriate terminology to convey just how close the little bastard (wait, that might be a better one!) was to getting his little neck wrung when Greg finally heard the laughing.
Clint forced her diaper aside and inserted more fingers.
Ah. So that was it. John rolled his eyes and returned to his phone. “Well, I never said you needed to.”
He felt Thorin hook his thumb in the waistband of his nappy and hold it out, then give a low whistle.
Mycroft put a finger to his lips, and hummed. “...Maybe you’re right,” he admitted after a moment’s thought. “I suppose that particular one isn’t as scary as it used to be.”
“It is.” Sherlock slipped the soft, stretchy onesie over Jawn’s head. “Because for the next two days, you’re only going to be Daddy’s small, teeny-tiny baby.”
“Well, let’s make this one of those times.”
“You’re very welcome...least someone has manners ‘round here,” he said, though the last half of it was muttered under his breath. He offered the Jack cup to Jawn; “Here you go, monkey.”
Sherlock scrunched his shoulder and giggled at the sensation, then reached up and gently grabbed Mycrofts’ nose.
Greg smiled. He enjoyed these soft, intimate bonding moments that a nappy change brought them, so he always took his time whenever he could. He was fluffing up one of the boys’ nappies when he glanced down at Sherlock, who was humming to himself while sucking his thumb (naturally) and twirling one of his curls around his finger.
“Try me, Malibu Ken.”
"“ Mycroft in this for today’s prompt plz 👉👈 “
Well, shit. His bluff having been called (because the cheeky little shit was right; Greg didn’t have it in him to carry that out...not right now, anyway), Greg sighed and sat back on his heels. “What’dya want?”
“F’an’goo,” Sherlock said, trying to aim the spout of the cup at his mouth without taking his eyes off the screen.
Jawn tilted his head back at the touch, breaking the suction he had on his bottles’ nipple with a sucking pop, and beamed up at Mycroft. “My’!” he babbled as he pointed at the level, just in case Mycroft had missed anything on the screen that was directly in front of his face. “My’, my’!”
Dwalin grunted in reply.
There was a loud click as the bedside lamp was switched on, and Jawn found himself blinking up at Mycroft.
Sherlock nodded. “P’ea’sh?”
Tony’s chunky little baby thighs were right there, uncovered, and more firmly held in place than his biceps were.
“I said I would take care of it.”
“Can Daddy put it on for you–” John barely had time to finish his sentence before Sherlock was pushing the box into his hands. “P’eash p’eash p’eash!”
“Hm, it sounded better when I said ‘leech’.”
“Wha’d i’sh i’d???” Jawn asked again.
Dicks’ frown only deepened as he turned his attention back to the castle he’d been painstakingly constructing for the past hour. Nobody could make him do
...Until it wasn’t.
He wasn’t about to let Dick know that, though. “One,” he counted, and was met with the poutiest bottom lip as Dick glared up at him.
“You c’n ha’b all’a mines if you s’ssssss!” Sherlock hissed, and Jawn giggled.
Mycroft glared at it, his hands on his hips. “Take it off,
“Then what’s wrong, baby? Don’t you like it?”
“‘But’ nothing. You can wait until we’re home.”
Greg folded his arms over his chest. “We’ll get ice cream tomorrow. At the
“Yeah!” he called back. “I mean, I can make it enough!”
“What sort of pizza do you want, sweetheart?”
“I, I’m s-sorry, baby, I r-really am, it’s  jus-it’s just...!” Greg could hardly finish before dissolving into giggles that left him breathless. God, his belly was starting to hurt.
” Harry squealed, diving waist deep into the bag and coming up with two alarmingly huge, plastic cylinders with bright orange and yellow nozzles.
For once, Sherlock couldn’t figure something out. And that bugged him.
...Unfortunately, even the best of the best have their ‘off’ moments.
“This one, pleeeea’ssse,” Harry said, hitting a soft hiss on his ‘s’, as he often did when he was Little. He held up one of his muggle toys; a squat, plastic green frog, with different coloured spots on its back that played different musical notes when you pressed them.
“Poor love,” he cooed down at his brother, and reached out to brush his hair out of his forehead. “Gregory certainly beat you up, didn’t he? Assaulted your little person, the brute! Whatever are we going to do with him?!”
“Ask it inside, darling,” Mycroft replied in a huff of frozen breath that caught the air. Even under the powder and rouge he wore, his cheeks were chapped raw. “This dress isn’t doing big brother any favours out here.”
The look on John’s face curled into an offended sneer while Mycrofts' fell into utter disappointment...and he couldn’t decide which reaction was worse. The scales did tip in John’s favor, though, with the “You WOT,” that followed. Mycroft put a hand on his other shoulder to calm him down; “Easy, darling,” he said, then turned back to Greg.
Dwalin tore into a loaf of bread; “Still there,” he mumbled through a mouthful, and nodded towards the thicket. “Nursin’ his wounds.”
The rest of the place was no better…the pamphlets, what few were left, were yellowed and curled from age, the gigantic map that boasted their location faded from years in the sun, vending machines empty (except for the small family of mice that had taken up residency in one of them, even though any food that had been left behind was long gone), and the drinking fountains crusted over with dried mold.
Bucky grunted and waved him off with his elbow.
Eh, he thought as he brushed Dick’s hair back from his forehead. That was a problem for future Bruce.
Bilbo felt a lump of fear rise in his throat and swallowed thickly, and then–completely against his own will, damn it all!–
“Yay!”
“You,” Greg said as he trudged up the stairs behind Sherlock, leaning heavily on the bannister; “-are gonna get your bum smacked.”
Mycroft stared at him for what felt like ages...okay, it was maybe five, six minutes at the most, but when even thirty seconds of total silence feels like forever, then five or six minutes of intense scrutiny could easily feel like a lifetime.
Of course, there was no answer. Because he was alone.
Severus smirked; Harry was indeed just as much of a brat as he’d always been, but now he was
Bucky ignored him and refocused on Blue and Josh’s pajama party, hoping that Josh would read just *one* more bedtime story…but no, now Josh was putting his guitar away and telling everyone night-night. Bucky pouted; he was really hoping for one more story!
And although Natasha was his, and only his, Loki loved the rest of her tiny Midgardian friends as if they were his own, and loved nothing more than caring for them the same way…which would sometimes include letting them on the breast.
Mycroft dropped his sparkler and both brothers were on her in an instant, looking her over; “What, what happened? What’s wrong? Are you alright?! Did you burn yourself–?!” they fussed in turn, with Mycroft trying to look at her hands for possible burns and Sherlock attempting to get her to look up at him and tell him what was wrong.
Again...nothing moved. It was as if the whole kitchen itself was holding its breath, waiting.
In fact, within minutes of meeting the man, Loki had firmly decided that Mama would be the one to pop that cork.
Thor…was speechless.
“I was strong-armed,” Greg replied…and dodged another swipe of the pencil. “Okay, no. Nope, uh-uh, I can’t do this,” he said, and scooted Sherlock off from his lap with a speed that left the little tyke speechless, and got up from the chair. “Nope. Can’t.”
The smile slowly left Gregs’ face; whenever Mycroft dropped the latter half of his name and shortened it to ‘Greg’, he knew he was in the shit...like,
...Would he? They still hadn’t heard anything from upstairs either, after all.
into the cider mix.
At least, the remains that clung to his bum and the backs of his legs in sticky, foul streaks…the rest of them were still in Jawns’ nappy, which had been removed and lay discarded on the carpet behind him.
Jawn took one look at him…and immediately burst into fresh tears.
Greg grinned as he went and unbuckled his grumpy little man from his high chair and scooped him up onto one hip. Yeah, he was a sucker, and he knew it.
I can’t believe it’s been a month already, and that Christmas is over and in a little less than 24 hours, we’ll be in an entirely new year!
But still, Steve checked. Because he liked to check.
Sherlock sat up. “Bu’d, bu’d I, I w-wa’n fini’ss a mo’bie, My’coff!” he pleaded.
Sherlocks’ head popped up, leaving his thumb hanging off his lip; “Wha’d??” he asked, sounding incredulous at the sudden turn of events.
“ ‘bout time! Yes, Greg loves his cheeky little muffin bunches and bunches!” Greg pressed the tapes snugly into place, and patted Sherlocks’ thigh, signaling that they were done. “Especially a muffin who lets me go to the park.”
And then he thought about nothing at all, as he’d fallen deeply asleep, feeling safe and satisfied.
“Cause Sher’yock’s a bay’bee.”
let go, just a little bit--I have to into the kitchen to turn them back on. And I have to check on Uncle Gregory.” He really hoped Greg was out of the shower by now...the man was accident prone on his best days, let alone when he was suddenly cast into darkness while covered in hot water and soap on a slick surface such as the shower.
John sighed; “Daddy’s sorry, you know that?” he asked, reaching under Sherlock’s dress to pat his bottom.
Well, it had
“I’m sure you know good and well what this is for?” Mycroft asked. Any hint of amusement he’d shown earlier was nowhere to be found now, in either his tone or expression.
Bruce reached up to rub Dicks’ back; “You, little boy, are going right back into diapers,” he told him with a resigned sigh, and shifted him on his now-soaked hip as he continued to carry him out of the room. “…After Alfred draws us a bath.”
…Several
grungy socks!), trousers, cups, bowls…anything that could be washed, was washed.
Steve smiled. He wasn’t really a fan of pull-ups per’ say, because they leaked
Jawn clung to Sherlock the way a drowning man clings to anything solid that he finds. “B-but I, I’m s-supposed to…!”
Mycroft found himself smiling, in spite of everything...okay, that was just too precious. “Oh, I see; just like your Daddy; yes you are! ‘I’m too little! Pick me up!’,” he said as he walked back to the bed, pitching his voice higher in a near-perfect imitation of Sherlock when he was in headspace. “‘Too little’ indeed, until it’s time for a nap. Or a change. Then you’re oh-so-very-Big!” He lifted Jawn into his arms and hitched him onto his hip. “Neither of you are fooling anyone.”
you only got smacked,” Mycroft snapped.
Alfred was perched at the head of Dick’s bed with the man cuddled up at his side, and even from across the room Bruce could see the half smile on his face when he entered the room. “Eight…” he said, petting Dick’s hair lovingly.
an accident,” he sighed, pressing his fingertips against his eyelids.
“Let him sleep as long as he wants, and really push on the fluids.”
“Oof!” he grunted, as Molly ran right to him and wrapped her arms around his waist, trembling.
Yes, Mama had all the patience in the world for her little dumplings.
John cocked his head at that. “Oh, yeah? Is that it, is it? So, we need to make your bum match, too?”
Greg was grinning like an idiot, having listened to the boys doing their trade-offs without so much as a scrap of bad temper between them. It was always sweet to see them getting along like that when they were both in Little headspace. After turning both the DVD player and the telly on, he looked back at them. “Right, lads,” he said as he used the remote to push ‘play’; “Greg’s gonna go get your cuppies and you’re gonna sit here and be nice, okay?”
So, Mycroft had transferred them to the couch, where he could plug his charger in (and stretch his increasingly weary legs). Other than that...not much had changed.
“…Maybe.”
“Just a minute, darlings, then we’ll be inside,” Mycroft told the boys, then turned back to an increasingly-frustrated Greg, who was still fumbling with the keys at the front door. “That is, if Uncle Gregory can remember how the bloody keys work–” he added dryly.
“Make sure he drinks enough of anything that’s not Red Bull,” Bruce clarified,a and stuck his phone back in his pocket. “And give him a couple of the chewable fever-reducers when he wakes up.”
too hard, much harder than he’d intended...it wasn’t very playful at all.
“Uh, come again?”
“Ah, yes, a solid argument.” Severus walked them into the kitchen area that took up a small part of his quarters at Hogwarts. He opened a cupboard and fetched one of Harry’s glass baby bottles, since Severus got the sense that he felt small enough for one that night.
Though he barely felt it ( and he was hardly going to encourage a stronger one), Greg yelped as if he’d been kicked and jerked his hand back. “OUCH! Oh, ouch, ouchie, owwie, ow!” He shook the ‘sting’ out of his hand, even blowing on it, and then pouted at Sherlock; “We even now, muffin?”
Harry covered his mouth and continued to jump…silly Daddy! Had he forgotten that that didn’t scare him anymore?!
He tucked Harry into the crook of his arm and let him stretch out over his lap, getting him nice and comfy before snapping his fingers.
. The bastard.
“I y’ike i’d dow’ here, f’an’goo,” Sherlock said, frowning at the screen so hard that his forehead creased.
Technically.
“Sorry, sorry-sorry-sorry!” the wolf said, still giggling, then reached up--’
??” he asked, playfully pinching the fleshiest part. “Look, look at these big, juicy turkey legs!”
Sherlock’s face softened from one of frantic worry, to understanding. “Oh…oh, Jawn, no,” he said, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him to his chest. “That’s not your job, monkey. You can’t help all of them; that’s too much for just one person.”
“I can’t help it!” Greg insisted. “It’s a reflex!”
“Uhhh...why not just go in?” Greg ventured, and was shushed again as Sherlock frowned and tried to press his ear even closer...almost into the wood, if he could manage. “I can’t hear anything,” he said eventually.
Sherlock stiffened under John's hands. His eyes fluttered back open to slits, just enough to glare at him sideways, looking almost like a snake. "No."
All feedback is welcome and appreciated!!! Thank you so much for reading, and stay healthy! <3

John raised an eyebrow, barely able to hold back a snicker. That was perhaps the first compliment he'd ever heard Sherlock pay his brother, in all the years that he'd known him. "Mycroft. Who broke into the flat last night to search for drugs that you weren't on and that weren't here, and traced you on his second phone, and then called his army of secret cars to ferry us around the city."

They can give Sherlock any creature comfort in the world that they want. None of this will matter to him. Sherlock doesn't want order-in room service from a five-star chef, a physician with a pedigree longer than his arm, and a pool downstairs where he can take water therapy with the princess of Wales.
"You could be," Sherlock points out, and John's stormy eyes flicker wide.
And as much as he hated him-- as
Sherlock tried several times, to put an end to The Plan.

than listening to a woman complain about her last boyfriend that drank too much, hmm?"
The unsaid implication, of course, was obvious.
"It is mandatory that we commence in copulation post haste, like proper degenerates, so we may relish in debauchery."
He smiles again.
There's really not all that much of his pride left to save, anymore.

He tears a sheet loose from his notebook, very quickly scribbling his words down.
Sherlock has found himself an anchor. He breathes easier and slower, his bright eyes still wide and a little startled, but now given a way forward he's finally able to actually think and slow his hands down. He has found an anchor, and it is not in John and Greg, trying their very hardest but ultimately he might as well have been just babbling to a brick wall, but

This is not what John signed up for. This is not what anybody in the world could ever want. They're sitting here with John pouring out a monologue worthy of a romantic tragedy while Sherlock sits here unable to so much as say a single word back in answer. It's not remotely okay at all.
"You're

touch now, and he did.
Sherlock stiffened. Open surprise flickered across his face before he controlled it again, beating it back into submission, but John just stared back and let the words settle. Mary: not the right person for him. There. He'd said it. He'd finally said it out loud and admitted it for the very first time.
It's only a sprain. He'd twisted it on the ice and landed flat on his back. There was never any trauma to his leg sufficient to break the bone. It's not worth the effort to unfold his frozen solid fingers to explain this via text message, and more to the point, the only thing that will actually convince John is an X-ray. Not that Sherlock ordinarily would care, but-- he figures he has put John through enough today. This week. These past eight months.
"Yeah, well, sorry, I guess I tend to get a little absentminded after being pistol whipped." He rubbed his face again with a long, jaw-cracking yawn. "Sarah's all right, at least. Thanks for... turning up. Helping us out."
John smiled back, the acerbic jab again putting him at ease. Sherlock was fine. Annoyed, sulky, exasperated, yes-- and fine.
If ever there will be a moment,
"Well, maybe you look amazing all the time." John smiled into his chin, tugging his collar straight, smoothing a hand down the lines of his shirt. "Though I can admit that the most expensive, dramatic coat in London doesn't hurt."
"I'm sorry that I hit you, Sherlock. I shouldn't have. I thought you were going to hurt someone and that I needed to stop you, but after that-- it wasn't okay. I hit you because I was angry, and hurt, but... you didn't deserve it. You could never have deserved that, Sherlock. From anyone."
He really would like to personally dissect every single viral fragment in his body. But for now, this will simply have to do.
John picked her up at once. She immediately hugged around his neck and he hugged her back, stroking her very short, very soft hair. Honey-gold, just like her mother's.
It's so much worse than anything John would've ever pieced together on his own.

"How do you feel?"

to have. It does not matter. He can not do it.
Then John lets go, and the moment is gone.
Except, just in all that he'd said just now, he could tell that maybe it wasn't entirely John. Maybe it wasn't him at all. It sounded like a lifetime of expectation and assumption, and many probably much more cruel and ill-meaning than his. But even if there were as a whole host of others to blame for it, none of them were here. The only person here was John, and Sherlock across from him, draped over the sofa and glowering into space. The fervor of it had cooled, but the bristling stab wound of defensive hostility was still there underneath it. Much too late to stitch it, but maybe he could still attend to the scar.
Sherlock thins his mouth, glaring at the space between his knees. The pen taps between his hands, so rapid and angry it's fast approaching a blur.
But it is
to fix it. Not a therapist, but something did have to be done. Sherlock couldn't keep doing this and John was going to put an end to it.
"Is it a good idea for you to poke near your eye with sharp objects right now?" John rolled his eyes, then poked his nose when Sherlock looked to to be about to reply with an indignant defense. "Don't answer that. I'll take them out. Hold still another second." He slipped back to the loo to go through his kit and head back, the proper supplies now in hand. Sherlock had, at least, had the good sense to keep his medical supplies... even if he doubted he'd used most of them for anything that was remotely medically sanctioned.
Sometimes, when he had a point to make and that wasn't it, he would give in.

"There is no need to worry, John." He folds his hands back together, sitting in his chair stiff and all but unnaturally straight. "Sherlock is under round the clock security, and my agents are looking for them. Nobody will touch him."
Which left it up to Sherlock.
The things he felt in replacement weren't exactly positive. But he wasn't anxious. So there was at least that.
He's not a child. He's been in hospital before, actually, believe it or not, and is perfectly capable of subsisting without John here. Which is the point, actually- suddenly, Sherlock looks at John, and imagines him going home, and. It's all right.
Mycroft cleared his throat when John kept his silence, still frowning across the somewhat destroyed sitting room. "I never actually saw Sherlock during this period until I visited during his third year. And by this point, it was too late. He was already in over his head."
There was a knife on the table, and he wanted to pick it up, and he wanted to stab him. Right now. Right in the stomach. Where it would be bloody, and gruesome, and violent. He wanted to feel the blade dig inside him and watch the pain contort on his face and hear him scream, and why the
They sink down together, John into the only chair so Sherlock onto the floor. He keeps his hands around John's fists and leaves them there when they finally unclench, his fingers grasping into Sherlock's like he's drowning and Sherlock is his raft, and Sherlock presses closer. He can't stop John from gasping so he just meets his frantic eyes and stares back until he understands.
"You know what I mean."
John sighed, and sank back down with his head in his hands.

The man whirls to his feet, a gasping hurricane of frustration and upset. John reaches for him again but only catches a vanishing fistful of dressing gown as Sherlock whips away. He shoves the files away in a cascading cacophony of paper and even throws the pen for good measure, and he just storms out of reach in endless, suffocating silence.
John swallows, and takes the note.

Sherlock. Barely a month ago yet, underweight and keeling over with double kidney failure, his arms so badly bruised up and down they almost gave up finding a vein. Sherlock, wanting to go home, demanding to ride it out cold turkey, but being overruled by John, Mycroft, and his attending all together, because he was in such bad shape that the detox
raise the volume of his voice each time (but without yelling. For one, Bucky didn’t do well with yelling and two, he didn’t want to yell at his baby for anything in the first place), but finally managed to get him to turn around and look at him. “You okay in there, big boy?”
Time for a toddler-hunt.
“M’ no’d scared,” Sherlock whispered back...just as the sound of a chair scraping the floor came from the kitchen, making him gasp.
–but the flushing sound ended, and there was Blue’s voice, cheering you on. “Good job!” she said, while the little soap bar went “Yay!”
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose, his shoulder still jiggling slightly as he chuckled. “God…alright, who’s ready for fireworks??”
The change itself went smoothly as well, with Mycroft speaking softly to him the entire time to keep any more tearful outbursts at bay. Jawn didn’t exactly keep up his end with the conversation, but that was fine...Mycroft was more than happy to do all the talking, even if it was about nothing of particular importance, as he wiped the tiny doctor clean and took care to make sure his dampened skin was completely dry before coating him in a fine layer of lavender-scented baby powder. “Your Daddy certainly has a knack for finding the best sort of products, doesn’t he?” he admitted as he read the ingredients on the back of the bottle.
He sat up and stretched, then groaned as he shoved out of John’s chair. “Come along, darling,” he said, paying no mind as he stepped and stomped over piles of paper with satisfying crunches and crackles. He stopped and reached down for her; “Let’s go get a dry bum and a pretty dress on.”
Natasha nuzzled around for his nipple for a moment before finally latching on, eliciting a sigh from both of them. Loki gently swayed from side to side, rocking her. “There, is that better? Yes, know…” he talked to her as she mewled in reply.
“Is he in a clean nappy??”
Thorin threw a glance back over his shoulder and, just as he’d suspected, found their little burglar trailing far behind the rest of the group, eyes downcast.
The sudden onset of pitch black darkness and silence was eerie after the non-stop screaming and explosions that had been taking place just moments before, and Mycroft didn’t realize he was holding his breath until his lungs started to ache. He took a deep breath, then another, as he searched the pocket of his robe for his mobile--
“Maybe I’ll just use all your fancy soaps, then,” Greg huffed, sounding more put out than he actually was.
“Right-o, I’ll take care of it,” Greg said, and added a quick kiss to Mycroft’s cheek. “We’ll trade off when you come back, Morticia.”
“Natasha,” Loki warned as he swatted an eager hand away from his chest. “I’ve already told you, patience.”
Across the table, Thor simply sat back and watched the scene before him unfold with a highly amused grin on his face. “Can’t argue with that,” he chuckled.
Hermione had him bundled in her lap while they waited for the tub to fill. “You say it like you don’t have two other toys waiting for you, you silly little bean!”
,’ Greg thought with a smile, and started towards the kitchen. He’d only just reached out for the lightswitch when--
Tony stared out at him woefully as he sucked one corner of the Cloak, who seemed to begrudgingly allow it…this time. The baby was upset, and they didn’t like Tony being upset if they could help it.
Bucky was still in the living room, standing in front of the TV in nothing but his Blue’s Clues t-shirt and a pull-up while watching, you guessed it, his favorite blue puppy bouncing around and leaving her paw prints everywhere.
The squealing stopped almost instantaneously. “Y’ah?”
Greg winced...he wasn’t being yelled at, and Mycroft was still smiling, but the implication behind the words was still sharp. “I can come help,” he offered weakly. He’d been planning on it, anyway. “I can get them washed and dressed; you don’t need to--”
“Hm. What if…” Mycroft paused to think for a moment; usually when either of the boys were tiny, all they needed to be satisfied was a warm lap, a warm blanket, and a warm bottle. Jawn currently had two out of the three, but he was still a forlorn little biscuit. “What if…” Mycroft mused; “What if we went to the park? You like to visit the ducks, don’t you?”
“That was close enough! I’ll take it!”
Made him look awfully cute though, the poor thing.
“You know good and well who!” Ron shook the trousers at her.
to remember to tell Stephen about that. That was too damn cute. “Look, Tony’s daddy sent it for you!” Steve gushed as he set the brand-spanking-new Blue’s Clues training potty on the floor. “Come look at it!” he said, and pulled out his phone.
“Yeah, the remake. It had what’s-his-face and the short Russian guy from Star Trek-”
John looked over and smiled at him. “Why you over there by yourself? Do big boys not like a good cuddle either?"
Still...no answer.
…” he muttered.
The rest of the dwarves had already made camp for the night by the time Thorin and Bilbo caught up, even though they still had good few hours of traveling time before the sun set. But when he was questioned about it, Dwalin had merely shrugged and gestured to the nearby stream.
Harry blinked up at Severus as he suckled, and shook his head. No, he hadn’t.
Greg suddenly grinned to himself. Lord, looks like they had another fucking genius in the house.
He was still sitting there on the bed, staring glumly at his hands and feeling sorry for himself, when he heard Mycroft come back in the room, and quietly shut the door behind him.
-Greg returned the first two sippy cups, trading them for two more from the vast selection they’d acquired ever since the boys had made this their second home. “Uhhhhhhhhmmmmm,” he hummed, turning over the cup in  his hand as if inspecting it for (non-existing) residual smudges and smears. “
“Hilarious,” Greg replied, spreading the blanket from earlier on the floor. “Bum down.”
"Hello! Anon who made the Steve request here: Can I amend my ask by Adding Mommy Natasha to the scenario too???"
“He is! I was only making suggestions–!” Hermione started to protest, but stopped when she felt a series of gentle taps on her arm. “A’mione,” Harry said, patting her with the tips of his fingers to get her attention. “A’mione…!”
But, as he never let anyone ever,

Sherlock’s mouth dropped open.
“Steeeeeee’b,” Tony nodded, and let Loki sit him up.
Jawn, the poor thing, had another handful clutched fretfully in tightened fist as he desperately tried to clean up the remains of what must have been a terribly upset tummy.
.  “Gregory, you’re going to bed early tonight. That means no movie,” he added.
Sherlock, who’d been watching the space where his brother had vanished, now looked at Greg and blinked as if he’d forgotten he was still there. “Wha’d?” he asked, his voice still thick and raspy.
Bucky sniffled wetly, but he didn’t reply. But then again, he wasn’t very wordy when he was a bub, anyway.
Sherlock, still red-faced and snuffly from the tantrum he’d thrown over aforementioned dummy (and the smacked thigh it had earned him), sat and scrubbed at his poor red-raw eyes with his fists.
Usually, when Bucky went down for a nap, the little guy woke himself up about thirty minutes (maaaybe forty-five minutes on a good day) into it and would come search Steve out, then park himself in his lap and doze for another ten, fifteen minutes while he got good and awake.
“Good decision,” Sherlock said, putting the other pair back. “And that is going to be the last one you’ll have to make for the entire weekend.”
“Yes, well…” Mycroft drawled, his chin resting nicely on top of Jawns’ head; “You left an extremely maudlin child behind,” he added, and lazily turned his gaze to his brother and gave him a wry smile. “It makes an afternoon of fun and games a bit tricky when one of the players can’t stop crying for ‘Daddy’.”
“Shu’ddup, you know he and Greg love having a full house. We both need to shave and change, then we’ve got to her changed, pack bags, and then pick up this mess.”
Greg sighed as he watched Mycroft leave. ‘
Severus smiled; “Now, how could I say ‘no’ to a please that pretty?” he said fondly, and kissed Harry’s forehead. “One story,” he reiterated and, with bottle in hand and babe in arms, carried them into the sitting room and settled them all nicely into the big, cozy armchair by the fireplace.
John gave it a swirl of his tongue, getting it good and wet before popping it back out…and then
"No! I mean, no sir, not necessary!"  Greg chuckled to himself as he dove straight into bed.. He flopped over onto his back and was just about to pull up the covers, when he stopped. "Hey, um, can you…tuck me in? Please?” he implored, fluttering his eyelashes.
“Yeah,” Jawn said, his voice flat. “Is’sa mas’g.”
Bruce Wayne blinked…and instantly regretted it as he realized how dry his eyes were after an admittedly ridiculous amount of hours staring at his computer screen.
“Go on, hazard a guess,” Greg teased, as he went about changing a very soggy nappy.
He should be grateful, and he was.
Harry, clad only in a fresh nappy and his brand new, baby-soft jumper that Mrs. Weasley had given him just that morning, darted down the stairs and into the kitchen. Mr. Weasley was sat at the table, looking over one of Harry’s muggle toys (that he promised to take
The little devil
Mycroft let him have his moment to lick his wounds while he put the paddle away and straightened out his sleeve. When that was done, he turned to Greg and held his arms out.
“If you walked as much as you fussed we’d be at the mountain yesterday.”
“Heeey, big boy,” Bucky lifted Steve up and sat him on his hip. “You’re gonna stay here and take care of Thor, okay? It’s your job to keep him from being lonely and playing videogames all night.”
Bilbo looked up at Thorin from where he was crouched on the ground, rubbing his nappied backside with both hands…even through the encroaching darkness, Thorin could see his ruddy, tear-stained cheeks. “Go’way!” he snapped, reaching down to gather his pants from around his ankles.
Okay, Steve would
Sherlocks’ ears perked up. The flat was silent. Very silent. Even the street level noise (what little there was that lockdown had reduced it to) had dissipated to less than a murmur.
Mycroft gave Greg the Supreme Ultimate Form of his ‘I-Told-You-So’ Look, and then gently tugged on Jawn’s ear. “What do you say, darling?”
Steve gathered up the diaper bag, grinning to himself. He loved being able to put a smile that big on Bucky’s face…especially when all it took was the promise of chicken nuggets.
So. It had,
night’, and we won’t,” Thor told him, with a twinkle in his eye; “because we’ll have to take a break when we join our other friend’s later tonight.”
Molly sat up on her kneed and reached through the bars to lift the mattress up again, and used the coat hanger to hook the patch and lock the panel back in place. Then she sat back on her heels and looked over her shoulder at Sherlock; “Ah-d’ah!” she chirped, holding her tool up proudly.
The combination of such impotent baby-rage dressed up in sweet curls and a wet nappy was too much, and Greg couldn’t stop the short, sharp laugh that barked out of him, which only made Sherlock more irate. “You y’augh a’d me?! You pun’ss me in’na fa’se an’ you y’augh abou’d i’d?!!” he shouted, throwing his hands up in exasperation.
did Thorin have to put him on
…It was flu shot season.
”; “I think it’s perfectly appropriate.”
as a nice game of dress-up, until Sherlock had decide that Mycrofts’ make-up stash should also be part of the game, and had begged and pleaded, and then begged, and then pleaded some more until he’d worn Greg down and gotten a ‘yes’…albeit a reluctant one.
“N’ah!” Tony kicked his leg, completely unaware of what had just happened.
Secondly, they had been in the kitchen. Their warm, cluttered-yet-comfortable, bright kitchen.
“You don’t need them,” Thorin said, pausing by the stream to let the halfling catch up. “It’ll be warm enough by the fire, and we’ll see if you need a change sooner. D'yah want me to pick you up?”
“Good thing that I’m Big and can say 'fuck’ as much as I want,” John said and, without looking up from his phone, snapped a picture of Mycroft, who scowled at him.
And then…he went to Mama.
!” Sherlock fussed without looking back at them, and Mycroft chuckled.
“Your memory betrays you,” Loki muttered, and closed his eyes as Natasha started to have a proper cry.
Well, now Jawns' interest was piqued.
“Uh, looks like you did, bubba.” Steve looked up into Bucky’s grinning little face, and…
“Ferti’yize rosies!”
“I don’t fuss that much,” Bilbo grumbled, and begrudgingly climbed off of Thorin’s admittedly cozy lap.
” he exclaimed again, only louder, and more genuine; now that was no fair! He’d been looking forward to taking the boys to the park for some sunshine and fresh air...not to mention that they weren’t the only ones going a little stir crazy. “C’mon, Myc...what if I just take the spanking instead?!”
“Y’ussssss!”
“You wouldn’t!”
John couldn’t help but laugh…oh my
was wearing them.”
The baby refused to budge, his pout only deepening. “I wan’ Da’yee,” he croaked.
Bucky was right. Everything was g'woss. Leave it to Steve to pick the one rest stop that , from the looks of it, hadn’t been maintained since the early 90′s.
“B’aaaaaaah!” Tony fussed as he tried to pull free. It wasn’t his fault…that stupid little brush that Mama was using on him made his beard itch!
It…was his favorite.
“Ahhh, yes, at the cottage,” Mycroft smiled fondly as he watched John and Molly waving their sparklers around like wands, crying “Obliviate!” and “Levi-OH-sa, not Levi-oh-SA!”. “You hated any kind of fireworks for a good while after that, I recall.”
Sherlock sniffled again, and John was quick to catch his arm before he could rub his nose along the delicate fabric (and create a whole new problem). “Ah’pise?”
This is not the type of silence to ignore when you have a Little, deeply regressed into their headspace, roaming about.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment...then turned his face back into Jawn’s shirt, and began to cry in earnest.
Bilbo was still sputtering for an answer to the ‘change you sooner’ comment, when he processed what the dwarf was saying. “…Pick me up?” he asked.
Good thing she hadn’t done the mascara yet, either. Loki wiped the tears of mirth from her cheeks and tilted her head  to look at Tony, who had fallen over at some point during their obnoxious laughing fit and stayed that way. “C-can Mama finish your face now, dumpling?” she asked, still slightly breathless.
He went to reach for Thorin again, but the other dwarf had already moved past, and was going over to sit between Gloin and Oin.
Thor, and tell them to ready up…
Greg looked down at his feet, taking in the absolute mess that had occured when Jawn ‘exploded’ at him...candy was strewn
Nat followed Bucky out the door, and stopped to turn back halfway through to blow Steve a kiss because she knew that if she got close enough to kiss him for real, he was going to latch on again and then they’d have a terrible problem. “Bye, baby, we’ll be back soon! Keep Thor on his toes!” she said, and then both she and Bucky, were gone.
Behind them, Greg was setting up a line of bottle rockets in empty tin cans. “ ‘ey, can I borrow you lighter?” he called out, and Sherlock tossed it to him. “Thanks! You want me to light’em now?”
“W’on got’ted me
“G-g’eg?” Jawn tried...only to get the same result.
“I’ds, i’ds, i’ds sh’o
“That’s what I’ve just said, isn’t it!?”
,” he added, tipping his head back and draining the rest of his champagne in one large gulp.
Tony grinned up at her and waved his brush (still clutched in fist) “N’ah!”
“Aww,” Harry whinged, even as he lay his head on the older wizards’ shoulder. “Bu’d i’sh sh’o ear’yee!”
…That, was the last straw on the already fragile camel’s back. Bucky’s vision went blurry as tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down his cheeks as he took a deep, shaky breath and opened his mouth to wail–
“I can, depending on what you’re both harping over.” Sherlock entered the kitchen, also carrying two champagne glasses in one hand, his phone in the other. He eyed the banner, then gave both his brother and his boyfriend the once over; “…Double-fisting already, Mycroft?"
Tony only sniffled as he looked at Stephen woefully, with those big, brown doe-eyes of his, and kicked his foot feebly.
Mycroft melted right then and there; Tiny Jawn was such a little sweetheart. “Yes, wash your face,” he said, and slid the overgrown babe off of his lap and onto the bed. Which was all well and good, until he stood up and felt Jawn clutch his sleeve with a small whimper.
“number 12 with loki and natasha with breastfeeding please.”
A worried-sounding call came from the other room; “G’EG??!?”
Clint brushed his fingertips down her thigh, then let them drift back up her skirt and along the leg of her diaper before slipping one in the leghole, making her gasp.
And...nope, not even a smile. Just a big pair of big, wet eyes blinking up at him dolefully while making the softest of sounds as he sucked his thumb.
“Eigh’d,” Dick snuffled. He was partially draped over Alfred’s lap with his eyes squinched shut so tightly that it was even making Bruce see spots.
If he hadn’t felt completely confident in that, then quite frankly there wouldn’t have been any threat great enough for him to have left him with his brother in the first place. Not while Jawn was this small.
“A surprise,” John repeated, grinning. He kissed Sherlock on the cheek and scooted him off of his lap. “Go get it; it’s the little blue box with the Elsa sticker on it.”
Harry had to stop and explain each one in his adorably excited, jabbering way while Severus nodded, until they were well towards the end of his bottomless bag and his little babbling brook of a partner was finally starting to slow down.
part, he might as well have missed the whole show!
“Oh, love,” Mycroft sighed. “Not this time, not for little boys.”
“You need a bath, little boy.” Steve lifted his soggy little one onto his hip, ignoring the unpleasant squishing sound; “And then you know what we’re gonna do?”
