"I was... shot. In the shoulder." He gestures at his shoulder where, under his t-shirt, is a starburst of puckered skin and gnarled scarring. "I was... in a bad way, had to stay in the field hospital for a month fighting infection, they couldn't move me, it was too risky." He swallowed around a sudden knot in his throat, "when I eventually got back on UK soil, I spent six months in a hospital getting function in my arm back. I tried to contact him, Mrs Hudson, I did. I sent emails and letters but they either bounced back or, I think, got intercepted. Mycroft... he told me to stay away."
like a foolish child. As soon as his body has recovered, he hauls himself out of bed and promises to do it right: he still works hard in physical therapy but he doesn't push his limits, he finally accepts the doctor's list of therapists and begins the process of meeting each one to decide which fits him best. He eats the slop, and he forces himself into a cocoon of sheets and blankets and closes the curtains and forces himself to sleep, with the help of over-the-counter sleeping meds.
Apropos of my limitations: I know nothing about drug recovery, rehabilitation, being in the British Armed Forces or mail.
he tells himself sternly. Despite the crisis he'd had a few months ago about his apparent co-dependence on Sherlock, he'd been working hard to stabilise himself for his own sake. If Sherlock doesn't want him, well, it's not much different than how it is now, is it? He'd just keep living his life the way he is now.
Despite Sherlock's insinuation that higher ranking officials get private quarters, John's Captain status (as well as head surgeon) only provides him a small, private office and a less crowded sleeping quarters. There's four bedrolls on collapsable cots in this part of the camp, and his sits against the far wall, rarely used and methodically tucked every day, even if he hasn't slept in it. How many nights had he fallen asleep at his desk, instead of in his bed? But he'd just gotten off of his first Skype call with Sherlock and... bloody hell. He needed to step away, just to bring his mind back to the present. To where he was. Afghanistan. Sand. Dirt. Sun. Blood.
"Good. That's great, Sherlock. Thank you. I just kept... wanting to find you, but I couldn't. When I finally got better, in my body, I tried to reach you. I sent emails and letters but they all bounced back. Eventually I found your website, I read all your blogs by the way, they're very interesting," he feels a small thrill of pleasure at the light that flicks on in Sherlock's eyes, "and I tried to email you on that email too," he saw the question in Sherlock's eyes but he shook his head
“Yes, the sentiment is a bit… sickly." John huffs out a laugh at that. "But I do appreciate the technique of poetry, in itself. It’s not dissimilar to composing music… I can find something else if you like.”
“Can’t sleep?” Sherlock's voice goes low, like he's being considerate of John's fatigue, and it makes his hand expand painfully in his chest.
Sherlock scowled, his voice hard and brittle, “I did not ask you to be here, I did not ask for your help. In fact, I haven’t—“ Sherlock cuts himself off, looking down at his hands.
John is stuck on what to do. Cry? Call Mycroft to scream at him? Bury himself in a mound of pillows and sheets and sleep for eons? He had spent the last two months foolishly,
he know Sherlock? There's so many things that could go wrong with getting entangled with an addict, a healing addict at that. How helpful is John's presence actually being? Is he distracting Sherlock from his recovery, rather than aiding it? Has Sherlock just transferred his addiction to John, what with their emails nearly every day and their Skype calls at least every Tuesday, but often more, instead of the drugs? Head full of what if's and buts and hopes and dreams and
“Where the buggering hell did you get that from? I told you, Sherlock, the first letter I ever sent—“
Sherlock twists the corded phone around on his finger, feeling like a tragic woman from those pathetic romantic comedies Mummy had forced him to watch once. He couldn't help it, talking to his brother always made him antsy, fidgeting the only way to release the pent up frustrated and grudging towards his brother.
“You stay in constant communication with me, brother mine,” Mycroft paced back and forth behind his desk, rubbing his forehead with his free hand, wishing for the millionth time that he could just get Sherlock to understand that all he needed was to follow procedure. Procedures, protocol, laws, rules, follow them and
“Yeah, you. I really think you and Sherlock have a chance, a real chance to be something more than a fake couple. More than just
“OK, OK,” Victor let go of the chair, held his hands up. “Jesus. You get more insufferable the older you get.”
John blinked, stalling. “I believe… you were going to keep her safe until she reached America but she was incinerated instead when her jet exploded?”
Ignoring the ache in her shoulders, she scrambled up the tension wires like a monkey. She hoisted herself up on the railing and straddled it.
“Your dad does not treat his people like that,” Violet said calmly to Edward even though she had witnessed Rucastle treating Toller like a slave. “That’s very rude. Your mum and dad wouldn’t like hearing you talk like that.”
Now she wore gloves. She didn’t hate the way his fingers curled around hers when she took his proffered hand.
That was probably why his mate did all the heavy lifting. Or rather, told them to kneel so he could knock them out cold with the butt of his gun while the Australian man watched.
So he had stormed out of the bar, made his calls.  Once finished with that business, he re-emerged back into the bar section of the clubhouse. He had made eye-contact with Vibart then jerked his head towards the back, indicating he should follow him.
He strode over to the arena and handed the pistol to Gang He. “If it’s not working out, dispose of it. I can’t make any money off it if it won’t do its job.” He gave the pit bull a contemptuous look then spun around and smiled at Violet. “My dear Violet, do not despair. Most people interested in this sport are not interested in Alsatians. Pit bulls are the preferred breeds. You see, this,” he spread his arms out wide, “Is how you know that I trust you. I don’t show ordinary people my side businesses. Oh, I’m not into,” he flapped his fat hand towards the arena and the crates, “that. But I do rent the buildings out to the people who feel enthusiastic about this sport.”
He took care of morning business in the loo then poked his head into the nursery, expecting to find Molly. Instead, he found Mrs. Hooper, sleeping on a lilo she must have brought in there during the night. She slept in front of the baby cot, like a sentinel.
“The memory stick was destroyed and I owe you an iPad. Apologies,” Sherlock replied coolly as he waited for Dupin’s most inferior blogger to bring the car around.
“Yeah, I did,” John said meekly. “I’m sorry, Harry. Really. I’m just…” he blew out a breath. “I’m an arsehole.”
John put the iPad on the coffee table and took the mug. Blowing on it, he said “After living with you so long, I’m used to not taking milk with my tea and coffee, thank you very much.”
Violet let Sherlock walk a few steps ahead of her. She paused near Mycroft to hiss into his ear, her American accent nasal and grating, “Keep your promises,
“I don’t mind, you can come in John,” Sherlock rumbled, still not turning around. “You feel wrong-footed because your world still feels tilted after last night’s confrontation with your sister.”
Violet grinned, some of the weariness leaving her face. She wasn’t a beautiful woman, per se, but her sharp intelligence made her hazel eyes sparkle like topaz and her smile always transformed her face into something quite lovely.
“Your life is not your own,” he repeated himself, tightening his embrace around her rail-thin frame. “Keep your hands off it.”
.” She paled. “Maybe it was a good thing Jimsie chucked me out. It could have been me, dead on the slab, ears cut off.”
, the Seine River and of course now the Catacombs. He wouldn’t go to the Eiffel Tower because of a dig
John frowned. It had been eleven degrees yesterday, not Arctic by any stretch of the imagination, but still not weather that one can go without a coat. Plus the nights were still cold. “Let’s have a look at your temperature and get you sorted out, yeah?”
“Of course I forgive you,” Sherlock said gruffly. “After all, I forgave you for manipulating me into revealing MI-6’s plans to thwart a terrorist attack. Why wouldn’t I forgive you for this?”
“You can’t make me do anything,” Violet kindly informed him. “This is a business transaction, with substantial risk but the possibility of a win-win for everyone if-”
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?” John made his voice as chilly as Mycroft’s. “No, actually, what I should be asking you is:
“Don’t take that tone of voice with me, young man,” Mrs. Hudson scolded him but John caught a smile as she ducked back down inside the flat.
“Welcome to the Onion Field!” the Englishman spread his hands out wide. “I am Brother Morris Scowrers, of the
that long?” Violet burst out. “We should leave, now. Hell, we could all fake our deaths at the Copper Beaches, have that pinned on Rucastle and be on the first flight to Spain. We have money, I still have access to Jack Woodley’s offshore account. Why the hell would we wait until
But John knew Sherlock too well and for too long now. He was not surprised that the key Sherlock selected was the key that opened the secret compartment in the floor.
, he realized. The realization propelled another gush of pure, visceral terror though his already overloaded and stressed system.
. Oh, and the Art? I’m actually expected to teach a six-year-old about Art History. Like teach him about Michelangelo and Picasso and Vermeer.”
His eyes adjusting to the dark, Sherlock scanned the room, peering through the door, not seeing her in the other room. The boat only had three proper rooms, a kitchen, a loo and a bedroom. While the boat boasted a decent-sized galley kitchen with a breakfast nook, it had been turned into a work space for their computers, devices, photos and notes. Unfortunately, due to sketchy service as well as a healthy paranoia about being caught online, the computers and devices often ended up being paperweights for everything not taped to the walls.
Buttoning up his coat and draping his uni scarf over his shoulders, he looked left and right. To his relief, saw Sherlock only a half a block away. He walked quickly, probably trying to find the nearest bus stop as soon as possible. It had gotten damnably cold.
Even when they had been using together, Victor always managed to look somewhat put-together. But then, Victor hadn’t gone as far down the spiral as Sherlock had…
, he thought with an aggrieved sigh, starting to sit down. Then he sprang right back up again, gesturing towards an elderly woman burdened with her shopping and handbag to take his seat.
Relying on her psychology training, she gave Harry a reassuring smile and said “Well, I appreciate it very much that you’re not going to take my photograph. And I’m sure John and Clara are very grateful that you took care of them in the past,” she lied easily. She actually had no idea how Clara felt, except for she was obviously jealous of the carrot-haired tart Harry had replaced her with. John on the other hand… the only thing Violet could pick up on was frustration and rage.
Sherlock whirled around. A split-second flash of relief crossed his face. Only John would have noticed and recognized that tiniest display of emotion. The way the mercurial almond-shaped eyes had widened just slightly, the way his Adam’s apple had bobbed as he swallowed hard. Swallowing down his feelings as he always did. Forcing down his emotions so his massive intellect and ruthless logic could take precedence.
“Thank you, Miss Tey. It would be redundant to say we will take your case as we are already investigating this case for NSY but your information has been most useful.”
Sherlock thought it was good because he could engage in his favorite activity ever: People Watching.
After she had straddled the motorcycle, she wrapped her arms around his waist. He felt her rise up on her legs then felt her press a close-mouthed kiss to his cool cheek. He twisted his head around as she sat properly down again. “Am I forgiven then?”
“Christ, it’s The Cross Keys at Dartmoor all over again,” John groaned. “You need sleep. Stop acting ridiculous.” In a softer voice, he added, “Come here.”
As the cabbie turned onto his street, John decided he would order pizza for Susan and Anna. He’d let them watch a DVD in the lounge then banish them to Susan’s room for the rest of the night. They could giggle and carry on upstairs. He wanted the downstairs to himself.
Sweetie, their battered bait dog they had rescued from that scoundrel Rucastle, made a frightened, high-pitched yip, piddled a bit on the floor, then bolted for the kitchen.
Using one of her many false identities, Lisbeth rented a reasonable sedan that could comfortably seat four.
“Sergeant Alex MacDonald heard about the bombing on her police scanner a minute or so after it occurred as she was driving to work,” Molly explained as she smoothed an errant curl back from Mrs. Hudson’s forehead. “She wasn’t far from… from, you know,” she gave Mrs. Hudson a stricken look. “Where, um, it all happened, so she went there instead of NSY. She saw the medics loading Mrs. Hudson and Violet into an ambulance, so she called Greg. Then Greg called me when he found out they had taken them to here.”
She really didn’t. True, she wore a pile of make-up, but it seemed to be in an effort to look older, not to look sexy. She wore a pretty pink sundress and white sandals. Her shiny blonde hair hung well below her shoulders. She looked like a girl about to go on a date, not to meet a john.
“I feel fine,” she sawed him off at the knees. “I would not jeopardize your safety if I didn’t feel one hundred percent
She had vaguely remembered her dad’s old Army buddies. She barely remembered Lieutenant Green offering her condolences at her father’s funeral. The funeral had been a blur. She had been more focused on calming her inconsolable little brother more than anything else. Quite honestly, she had completely forgotten about Green until her interview with the FBI for admittance into Quantico, when they questioned her relationship with Phillip Green. She had been genuinely puzzled why they pressed her about this man. When they were convinced she wasn’t lying, they finally disclosed he had joined a criminal motorcycle gang.
John finally noticed she no longer bothered to use her faux British accent. “What is he blind to then, Mycroft?”
. Sholto was like a brother to you and Violet like a sister. Then they took your daughter and now have murdered Harry. Family, John, they’re going after your family. Mary is the closest to you now.”
“But that’s the problem, isn’t it?” Jim crossed his arms, staring out the window, watching the grey wintery rain fall. “Strings.
She had heard that Dr. Watson tried to strangle him in a fancy restaurant when he returned. She wished the good doctor would have finished the job.
Helplessly, he watched Sherlock bait the enormous hound. John had been intimidated by the Hound of Baskerville and by Gladstone, but this dog defied explanation. The monster had to have been fed steroids when he was a puppy.
“Look for a Sigma SD14,” he dropped his hands. “That’s what she had when she ambushed Violet and me at Baker Street, but Violet smashed it. People are slaves to habit and loyal to brands, I  being no exception since I prefer iPhones.”
“What I am,” he said, “is better than a genius. I’m an artist. I can’t match wits with someone like him. But my good friend Lord Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper convinced me to help out just this once. Just this one time to take the High and Mighty Sherlock Holmes down a peg or two. And it would be mutually beneficial to me since Toller’s drinking has gotten out of control as of late and, well, he’s gotten sloppy with, errr, well, the disposal of rough drafts, if you catch my drift.”
As Violet went to join Mary in the front seat and as Sherlock skulked in the shadows, John descended into the Underground and stepped into the first train that arrived, not caring where it took him. The carriage was deserted. Relief washed over John as he sat down, the plastic seat beneath him crinkling as he did so.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you are talking about,” the man John Watson knew as Mr. Kincaid took off his tortoise-shell eyeglasses and started polishing them with the end of his cardigan.
John didn’t want a drink anymore. “Right,” he put the tumbler on the table. “What’s the play, Violet? What are you really up to?”
“I’ll drag him to the doctor’s office myself, I promise,” Violet grinned. “And I went on a cleaning spree after Sherlock went to bed. All the cigarettes are now in the trash.”
The woman, a bleached blond with a fake tan and a perfectly made-up face looked up at her with a scowl. Then her mouth dropped open and her eyes widened when she noticed the gun barrel trained at her head. Her French-manicured nails hovered over her iPhone.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up into a grin as Gagnon’s face reddened. There was a deep chuckling behind them all. The
. Over the years he had learned how to read Sherlock’s micro expressions as well as the subtle body language that other people either dismissed or didn’t observe.
“His chauffeur-slash-bodyguard,” Sherlock filled him in. “Kudos to you for naming your goldfish, Mycroft. Makes you seem almost human.”
“Think, John. If Donovan and Mason were investigating me, there was only one reason why they would come to Appledore.”
Somehow, Mycroft Holmes’ poncy little brother still managed to look imperious, stripped to his pants and vest. He needed a shave and his curly hair defied description. Saying it was a cross between a rat’s nest and an unshaven poodle would be doing it a disservice. He wiped his sweaty hand on his vest before he continued to type whatever it was into his mobile.
“No,” Mycroft rubbed his side. “You told me to stay out of your way or else you’d kill him. We made no such agreement about me delivering him to you.”
In a flat voice, Violet told him. Sherlock listened intently but his eyes kept flicking back and forth between Violet and John, noting the distance between the normally affectionate friends, how Violet kept rubbing her upper arms and how John winced with every movement he made plus…
John grinned mischievously. Mary tried to smile back, but what she had overheard from the two gossiping nurses had spoilt the naughty rendezvous she and John had that night. She only managed a feeble smile for her husband.
John raised his hand to knock on the door, but it opened on its own accord. “Hello John,” Mr. Holmes rumbled, holding a cup of punch in one hand while reaching out to shake John’s with the other. His sky-blue eyes twinkled with genuine friendliness.
“Didn’t the Met send  all the authorization paperwork to your office?” John asked, hoping Gagnon wouldn’t notice his little fib. After all, Sherlock, Mary and Violet always pointed out what a shockingly bad liar he was.
“I’m sure they will find those rooms satisfactory,” Sherlock’s lips twitched in suppressed amusement, imagining Mycroft’s howl when he received next month’s credit card statement. Then he tugged on Gladstone’s leash. “
Sherlock, naturally, knew she was a fraud the minute he laid eyes on her. He also knew her life was in mortal danger. Not only had she pissed off the
She tried to take a breath and fire filled her lungs. She tried to sit up but immediately gave up as another scorching burst of agony rippled throughout her solar plexus down to her arms and legs. The pain in her torso and limbs did not even come close to the blinding pain in her head. Her ears rang with an awful clamor. She tried to open her eyes but immediately closed them again, letting a grey haze overcome her.
“My job at the insurance agency was supposed to be a temporary one while I was waiting for placement at one of the schools here in London,” she tried to look humble. “But I kept getting promoted and I honestly enjoyed the work.”
But that cane, that hateful cane and his aching arm and searing, throbbing ankle reminded him that once again, he was next to useless.
“My dear Violet, forgive me for not solving this sooner. I would have never put you in this unfortunate situation had I realized sooner what they were doing.”
“What do we do?” Honoré still looked dreadfully pale, even by the weak light provided in the City of Bones (John hadn’t determined where the light source was from and at this point, didn’t care).
“I am just as much to blame for that decision,” Jim accepted the cup. “I thought it would be better if he remained in London, remained close so we could keep an eye on him. I never dreamt he would obsess over Holmes the way he did.”
John peeled off his gloves (his second-best, he still couldn’t find his good leather gloves.) “Sherlock?” he called out, “Violet?”
But he could tell, observing her relaxed face, the fluid motion of her arms and hands and fingers, that she not only enjoyed playing, she missed it.
Sherlock decided to take the case. Decided to once again take on Moriarty’s network, better known as
He might have even embraced his little brother if the door hadn’t opened and Violet hadn’t walked in. “Everything OK?” Miss Smith asked as her sharp hazel eyes took in the scene.
She thought as she and Toller got closer. When they were near enough, she was about to crouch down and tell Edward she couldn’t wait to see him next week Monday when:
“Aye, we’ll be patching them over,” Chibs nodded before taking a long sip of his iced coffee, with was more watered down coffee than ice. “Some of the weaker members will be cut, but that’s nothing new in a patch-over. Herd’s got to be thinned. Some men aren’t cut out to wear the Reaper.”
“You are deliberately omitting tea,” Sherlock slowly withdrew his right hand from his pocket and flapped it towards the kitchen.  “I ordered some of that nice Great White Grape Tea you served the last time I visited you at the Diogenes Nursing Home.”  Resting his hand on his flat belly, he added, “And there’s cake. Mrs. Hudson made it. Some sort of sponge. I don’t know, I wasn’t paying attention, she was nattering on about Mr. Chatterjee’s many injustices towards her.”
However, a Tottenham pub was the only secure location Sherlock could procure that he knew would not produce a blip on Mycroft’s radar. Dear little Miss Dobney had been an utter God-send. Her paranoia paid off in spades. She texted Sherlock whenever a stranger even so much as glanced at the building. Sherlock finally was able to de-bug and de-camera his home, plus add a few silent alarms of his own as well as reinforcing the locks on his windows and doors. As he entered the dank, unfriendly-looking public house, he made a mental note to purchase his own surveillance cameras, ones that would link to his Smartphone and not Mycroft’s laptop.
“I see that,” Mike eyed the wall behind the sofa, where Sherlock had taped up several papers, all covered with complicated scientific squiggles. Then he gave Sherlock a jovial, friendly smile. “Ah, come on. I’ve got a night to myself for a change. Ade’s out of town and I don’t have to work or study for once. We’re going to the pub for a pint and to play darts. Join us. Take a break.”
Sherlock felt his breath caught in his throat. “Where is this box now?” he continued playing innocently ignorant.
Sherlock, however, merely arched an eyebrow. “Why not? He had our adopted brother killed, remember? And if Mycroft’s death is what it takes to keep my son safe,” he shrugged negligently. Observing her horror-stricken face, he added “But that would be a very last resort, of course. I’m not a psychopath, remember.”
She studied her hands. Then she waved them around as she shook her head again. She pressed her palms to her aching head and emphatically said, “NO.
The Earl agreed to questioning, of course but insisted on having his solicitor present. “As a member of the House of Lords in good standing, I know my rights,” he icily informed Mycroft.
Sherlock observed her with an almost smile as she put her feet into boots and pulled her coat on. But when she left the flat with Gladstone, the half-smile slipped from his face.
Sherlock did not fall for her gambit however. “A bit, but mostly because American fast food doesn’t agree with me. I’m not starving myself. And we need to talk.”
Sherlock wiped the green gunk off his lips, chin and mouth then wiped his long fingers onto his trousers. Then he rose nimbly to his feet in some sort of martial arts move. One minute he had been on his back then next he was on his feet.
Ever vigilant, Violet stood in the doorway, while Gladstone, all business now, sniffed around the lounge as Violet scanned  it , checking to see if anything had been disturbed. Her ears strained, listening for any ominous creaks that would indicate someone was in the flat waiting for her. She put the rucksack down, unzipped it and looked over her shoulder. When she didn’t see Mrs. Hudson, she took her Glock out and clicked the safety off.
. She didn’t care about any of those locations. She only cared about the end of the line for Piccadilly:
“Ronnie’s a good kid, he won’t ask questions. He knows better. Besides, other than Sis, since he’s an EMT, he’s the only other one with medical know-how and Serena’s about to drop.”
Doyle, A. C., & Morley, C. (1930). The Sign of Four. The complete Sherlock Holmes. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & Co.
“People do little else,” Sherlock pointed again emphatically to the inside of the stall as one handsome City boy actually stared at them, vainly trying to conceal his lust and envy.
“What about your education?” John asked as Honoré pressed a long rectangle of clean cotton wool over the cut. Recalling the rigors of his own medical training, he asked, “How on earth are you keeping up on your studies while babysitting him?”
“Mrs. Watson, the most I can tell you is that Marissa is safe and in a secure location. I am not permitted to know more than that in the event I am taken. If I am tortured, I will be unable to disclose her whereabouts.” He wound his scarf around his throat and hooked the umbrella over the crook of his arm, “Although I do have one last question for you, Mrs. Watson. Why didn’t you take the job from Magnussen?”
Violet’s eyes welled up as she threw her arms around the great big bald biker, “Thank you,” she whispered.
“And you will look beautiful,” John told her sincerely, saying what he should have been saying to her when she had been pregnant with Maisie.
As he lit up, she said, “Bullshit. I thought we had an agreement it was pointless to lie to each other since you can deduce me and I can profile you.”
. She was a spy. She was ordered to befriend Molly Hooper after Sherlock returned from his Great Hiatus. After my daughter disappeared, she was also ordered to get to know Jennifer Boyle as well.”
“Oh. Well, it was a pleasure, I’d do it again. Not that I plan on doing it again. I would, if I needed to, but I hope I don’t have to, save him, I mean,” Molly babbled.
The silence hung heavily as the lift took them to the floor where Mary was being kept. As the lift doors soundlessly opened, Sherlock finally mumbled, “I want to have a word with the physician in charge first.” Before either Lestrade or Violet could protest, Sherlock was off, his long coat flapping behind him.
Tristan Holloway might have been considered beautiful back in her “Trixie Holiday” era. Her most notable feature was still her pewter gray eyes, framed by thick black lashes. What was left of her looks though seemed to be washed out, faded away. Now she was silent, pale-faced and listless. Her wheat-colored hair hung limply to her shoulders, lank and unwashed. On Monday, she had spent the day drifting from room to room with a lost look on her face. When Violet had introduced herself to Tristan, the woman merely seemed to look through Violet, mumbled something that sounded like she was trying to thank her for caring for wee Eddie, then she floated away, humming under her breath.
He brought the spiked coffee to Sherlock, who put the book on the coffee table and tucked his feet up so Victor could sit down. “Oh,” was all Sherlock said when Victor handed him the mug. He sipped and pulled a face when he tasted the familiar tang of spirits.
Then, for the second time that night, Sherlock turned and bolted, leaving John and Mycroft struggling to catch up.
Meanwhile, across the street, in a nondescript van, a weary and jet-lagged Anthea listened in, huge headphones over her dainty ears.
“Possibly,” Violet took her pre-paid mobile out. Her eyes widened when she read the message. “I am so sorry again,” she said faintly. “But I must leave at once.”
He had hung there for a while, Anderson. But he never really regained consciousness. Machines had kept him alive. Even if he had woken up, he would have the mental capacity of a toddler. He would need constant care. Need to be fed, bathed. Need help using the toilet then cleaned up afterwards.
He was last seen outside the pathetic surgery he volunteered at but after that, no trace of the good doctor with a flair for purple prose and an addiction to adrenaline rushes.
Of course Violet would know he had bought Baker Street. This was not an advertised fact. Even John still didn’t know Sherlock owned the block of flats now.
“And whether I have five years left or fifty, I don’t want to spend that time wondering when you’ll cheat on me with John.”
“You twat!” John muttered to himself as he bent down to pick up his mobile. When he saw that the screen was shattered, he groaned, “Bleeding hell.”
“John, just do as he says,” Mary fixed her eyes on John. They were not tear-filled or wide with fright. They were dull, resigned.
Sherlock, with his shoulders bunched up to his ears and lips held tightly, dallied. Then he plodded over to the sofa, clutching his plain white mug as if it could shield him from whatever John planned on throwing at him. He sat gingerly down next to John, his posture rigid.
“You’re not in a position to bargain, Sherlock!” Violet interrupted in a bellow. Mulishly, Sherlock held out The Letter as if it were contaminated with anthrax. Violet snatched it away from him. “I’m sorry,” she whispered as she backed away from him. “I really am. I wanted to be friends. I wanted the cover story to be real.”
John grinned. It wasn’t often he could take the mickey out of Sherlock so he took his shots when he could. “Please. If she had pigtails, you’d be pulling them.”
Violet, after a cursory glance behind her to make sure Sherlock wasn’t lurking around somewhere outside, had smiled and followed the dour woman inside the lavish home.
“I’m not sure. I think it was cathartic, that it was good for him that this bullshit with Jim Moriarty and Richard Brook is finally over. But then again, he’s not sleeping so...”
Even though the fearful question had only slipped out because the sleep-deprivation had eroded his normally massive control over his emotions, he was glad it was out. He didn’t know if he could stand to attempt to care about one more person only to be let down again.
Their new place was considerably bigger and probably cost Greg and Molly a small fortune. But the security was tighter in this block of flats than it had been in Greg’s old place. Plus it had three bedrooms. Tiny rooms to be sure, but at least they had a guest room that could be converted into another child’s bedroom if Greg and Molly decided to have another baby.
She cleaned herself up the best she could as her arms and legs alternated between tingling and numbing sensations. The pain in her gut was excruciating.  She couldn’t stand up straight. She had to hunch over as she wobbled out of the bathroom, inching down the hallway, hoping to get to her mobile.
“It’s his eyes, mate,” his old uni mate Sebastian Wilkes had explained once. “The way they’re not blue, not green and how he just… looks through you. Like he’s reading your mind or looking into your soul. Then he spits out exactly what you’re thinking, who you’re fucking and what you had for breakfast that morning. It’s bloody creepy.”
“I know that,” Sherlock bowed his head. He jammed his cold hands in his pockets and started walking again, faster.
Then she cried out as another wave rocked her. She lost her footing, slipped and fell again, making a bigger splash than before.
Fingers tented together, Sherlock’s eyes roved over all the laptops set up everywhere in the flat, except John’s chair, of course. His eyes darted up to the bookshelves, towards the top shelf where a battered old copy of
film franchise was his embarrassingly guilty secret pleasure  and he would take that secret to the grave… he’d almost rather jump off of St. Bart’s again than admit
Sherlock had simply nodded, said nothing. Had said nothing about it for the past two, nearly three months.
“Oh, apologies, Dr. Watson,” Mrs. Toller crooned. “That’s not entirely accurate. It is true no one really is interested in you and the only people who would be affected by your death would be Sherlock and Mrs. Watson. But we simply cannot permit your wife to return to London.”
That burned John just as hotly as it had when he saw the tabloid’s headline “SUICIDE OF A FAKE GENIUS” splashed all over the front page after Sherlock fell.
“Harry, I swear to God,” John picked up his butter knife and pointed it at her. “If you can’t be civil at a time like this, I’ll-”
During his drive to the ostentatious hotel that reminded him of an orange iced lolly, he had received confirmation that Sherlock had not left his flat in three days. The new lead agent on Sherlock’s security detail confided to Mycroft that she had even wondered about the possibility that Sherlock might actually be dead. But she had witnessed Mary and Molly bringing him cassolets and puddings on a regular basis. She also saw him standing in front of his window, staring through the sheer curtains, watching cars drive past.  She took pictures, but he always kept his back to the street when he played violin.
“Go home and get back to work,” Sherlock made an impatient hand gesture to John, who had stuck his head out of the car door again. “What I asked you to do is important, Violet.”
“Fuckin’ sucks,” Wiggins said as he extended an envelope of money under the table towards Collins. “Gonna to need to call my sponsor after this. Really wanna use right now, can’t fuckin’ lie,” he laughed weakly.
“My agent made a fatal mistake. She thought if she told Mary the truth (that the child’s NICU nurse had been murdered) then Mary would be frightened off. Apparently Mrs. Watson is made of sterner stuff. She refuses to let this go. She’s obsessed now.”
The silence was deafening. No one sat. Everyone stood around the large table, looking at the three Sons with stony faces.
A flicker of motion caught his eye. John looked up and saw Sherlock’s face in the small window in the door.
Lisbeth was able to pull a schematic of the fire station, partially because of Violet’s surveillance of the site, but also because of Violet’s hacking into the late Senator Woodhouse’s computer. Lisbeth gave Sherlock and the bikers directions to the room  in which Mitton would most likely be kept.
“Oh, Christ,” Lestrade complained over the whine of the hinges as someone opened the coffin lid. “Why do I have to grab her middle? Nobody told me Granny was a big girl.”
Shortly before her Smartwatch died, she contemplated breaking her thumb in order to slip out of her bounds. She was too weak to get a proper grip on her thumb and break it… although the jury was out if it was her body or her will that was too weak to get on with it.
“I don’t remember,” Mrs. Payne-Ellis wiped her eyes with her fingertips then dug into her handbag for tissues. “One of the West End theatres? She’s an understudy, Ophelia in
“Information,” she said quietly as they continued their stroll down Westminster Bridge, shivering as they did so. “Charles Augustus Magnussen did not work alone and I strongly suspect his network is still alive and thriving. I need to know who’s still involved with his organization, still running his dirty old blackmail scams. Can you do that?”
“Mary,” John rubbed his eyes, feeling a sleep-deprivation headache coming on. His calves burned from all the walking and he felt a deep twinge in his abdomen where his spleen used to be, a sure sign he had overexerted himself. “What more do you want from me, honestly? I am doing the best I can under the circumstances.”
“There’s some guys, Brits, like you two,” Surfer Dude pointed at John and Sherlock with his paintbrush. “They knock off delivery trucks, hide the merchandise down here. Sell it for cheap online. Amazon, eBay, whatever,” he shrugged and resumed painting. “As long as we leave them alone, they leave us alone.”
Violet let Sherlock walk a few steps ahead of her. She paused near Mycroft to hiss into his ear, her American accent nasal and grating, “Keep your promises,
Absolutely uncaring how disheveled she looked, Violet leapt from the car and nearly sprinted inside, her bare dirty feet pattering on the pavement. Sherlock followed at a much slower pace.
He had noted even Violet had been startled by Victor’s good looks, or at least she had been last night. On a superficial level, yes, she found Victor appealing as well.
Sherlock closed his eyes, feeling the sentiment creeping up on him, like rising flood waters. “He was fourteen when he came to live with us. I do not remember a single childhood memory that Ford was not in. I was crushed when he left for university, Mycroft more so. He and Mycroft were equals, despite their age difference. Even though Ford often intervened when Mycroft tried to bully me, he and Mycroft were actually the best of friends. They were both brilliant and adventurous and they would talk late into the night about what they planned on doing when they grew up. They were both quite the outdoorsmen when they were boys as well.”
“Yes, I’ve read what happens to cops and agents when they cross the Sons, they tend to die or disappear,” Violet, however, sounded deadly serious. “I didn’t know her personally, my path didn’t cross with ATF very often in my career, plus she was before my time in the Bureau but I
Mary, on the other hand, who was not scheduled to work today, turned and headed towards the Pediatrics floor.
He thought the cleansing and disinfection of his wounds had been god-awful. And the suturing to close up the bigger, ragged punctures in his arm and calf had not been a picnic either.
“Three ideas,” Sherlock murmured, checking his watch again. “But now is not the time to discuss.” He slipped his mobile back into his pocket then pulled out his sleek, leather wallet. Fishing a black credit card out, he handed it to Mary and said “Go purchase everything you may need for our excursion to Cornwall. And do not worry about the cost, it’s on my brother. In fact,” a devilish little smile appeared on his lips. “Buy something nice for John. I insist. Make sure it’s
Mycroft needed her. And not just as a public relations ruse, the happy fiancée of his beloved little brother. He needed her skills as an investigator. He needed her to find out how Margaux Vos infiltrated MI-6 as well how she’d  gotten ensnared by Moriarty’s people.
Mycroft grimaced. Before he could text back, his housekeeper came in, pushing a tea trolley. “Everything alright, Mr. Holmes?”
“Stick, man,” Trager bounced out of the back room with his arms spread wide in welcome. “How the hell are ya?” Turning his head, he quickly explained to Rat Boy, who had followed him out to the bar, “Friend of the club.”
Both women’s faces were as white as snow and they carried their winter coats now that they were inside. They had both obviously dressed in a rush. Faded jeans and jumpers normally not worn outside the house. Mary wore an old jumper of John’s, the hems of the sleeves fraying. Molly had a spit-up stain on her cardigan, the one Lestrade liked, the one with the cherries. Molly’s shoulder-length auburn was tied back in a messy pony tail. Her soft doe-like eyes were wide with concern and worry. She had her arm firmly around Mary’s shoulders, as if she was afraid Mary would bolt at any given moment. Mary had made some sort of attempt to smooth her short platinum hair down but like Molly, hadn’t bothered with any make-up. Her cornflower eyes were glassy and her mouth was drawn tight.
“Yes I can. You just arranged it for the Paris police to give me a tidy little sum to keep me quiet about being falsely imprisoned.”
To one who knew Sherlock well (or as well as he would allow one to know him), it was obvious he was busy deducing her.
“OK, sorry,” Josie rubbed her eyes like a chastised child. “Um… OK, well… it was dark. In the back of the car, so I didn’t get a good look at her face.”
So she grudgingly canvassed Little Italy, had lunch at Papa Bella’s Ristorante and found to her pleasant surprise, that the food was very good. She also learned everyone’s routine.
Realizing he had caught a second wind, John decided to play around more with his poem, until his mind caught up with his body and he could have a little sleep as well.
“Ah, yes. Apparently they started drinking about three this afternoon. Got pissed at Greg’s favorite pub and um… yeah.” Violet crossed her arms, stared up resignedly at the tourist trap.
Sherlock ignored her flippancy once again.  He was busy flipping through a gigantic leather-bound book. It took a moment for Violet to realize what it was. “Is that a Bible?” she asked.
He had shaved off his beard Friday morning and put on one of a crisp dress shirt and neatly pressed suit for the first time in nearly two months. The luxurious clothes had felt foreign to him.
Violet still had no idea that was one of the reasons why Sherlock liked her so much was due to her practical nature.
“So Violet lied to me about Mitton confessing that I was not beholden to MI-6 for my stay of execution when my suicide mission to Serbia was aborted, but to you?”
John tore his eyes away from The Winged Victory, to the man sitting in what Violet Hunter would have recognized as the
It only took a few moments then Sherlock heard her footfalls on the steps. He crouched down, beginning to pick up the CDs. He mentally apologized to John since some of the plastic CD cases had cracked and splintered.
At least he hadn’t randomly reached out to touch her baby bump. That had been the worst. Random people, strangers asking if it was OK to touch her belly, to feel the baby kick…and then there were the rude sods who didn’t even ask, just patted her tummy as if she were a dog. It made her irrationally defensive and uncharacteristically cranky.
“But there is nothing here, Sherlock! We know that first hand! There’s absolutely nothing here. There’s not even furniture here. Besides, when we were here the first time, we would have…. You would have seen it, observed it. But you deduced there was nothing here, no clues, no files, no
“Sherlock, she’s at work, there was a huge car accident and she’s up to her elbows in blood and guts right now. It has to be
, Lestrade thought wearily as he gathered up the paperwork he would work on at home tonight after Molly went to bed.
Anna stood up, smoothing down her good black dress as Harry watched her warily. She flinched only slightly as her mother cupped her face with both hands. “Forgive me, darling,” Anna murmured. “You spoke the truth and I lost my temper.”
John dimly heard Sherlock fumbling with the curtains, the rings jangling noisily on the rod as he drew them closed, shutting out the rest of the world. Then he felt his long, wiry arms wrapping around him, possessively, felt those long, nimble musician’s fingers rake through his hair and massage the back of his head.
“She doesn’t know anything, I told you,” John burst out angrily. “She’s a nurse. She works the A&E at St. Barts. She’s a homemaker, she’s a mother, she’s…” his eyes opened and he looked helplessly at Mary. “She’s my wife. She’s not involved in any of this. She doesn’t work with me and Sherlock. Just let her go, she won’t say anything, will you, love?”
“Just remember this the next time you get the urge to light up,” Violet said unsympathetically. “OK, then. You said two things…?”
“Nothing,” John immediately lied upon seeing the tension tightening up Sherlock’s face again. He also saw a flash of fear and hurt flicker in those wonderful blue-green-gold eyes. The flash lasted for less than a second, but long enough for John to deduce what was going through his best friend’s mind as well as his heart:
“Perfectly,” Sherlock informed John in his normal, detached voice, albeit a bit scratchy from the sore throat. “If I didn’t trust you, I would have never given you the memory stick of my childhood therapy sessions. If I didn’t want you to watch those videos, I would have destroyed the memory stick. Besides,” he said lightly, “It would be highly hypocritical for me to be angry with you for doing your research. After all, I obtained your birth certificate to learn your middle name when you refused to tell me.”
“Short stories are still important stories,” Sherlock said gruffly. “And your story is not over. You still have chapters to go. Think about that when you can’t get out of bed.”
“If Dupin is taking me back to the hotel, where are you going?” John demanded, feeling his knees starting to buckle. As Sherlock opened the door, John cried out, “
She never understood Mary’s draw towards the ordinary. Cleaning house, cooking meals and raising children all sounded terrible to her. She loathed her current job as a housekeeper. She had plenty of money, payment for taking Jim Moriarty out. But she knew she would need the bulk of that money to pay people off, to keep them from ratting her out to
“You willfully and knowingly put my best friend’s life and my fiancée’s life in danger to get what you wanted,” Sherlock sneered, ignoring how Victor threw his own words back at him.
Violet sprinted towards Mitton. “Mitton, Mitton!” She knelt in front of him. “It’s me, it’s Violet, it’s OK now, you’re home,” she placed a comforting hand on the hand not stuck with a needle as she reached to cup his face.
“What happened? Is it the boys? Did something happen to John?” Violet couldn’t think what could rattle Mary this badly.  “Please, sit down, you’re scaring me.”
“Actually, the Internet names his outfits,” John corrected her. “You have heard about The Purple Shirt of Sex, right?”
As Rucastle continued to jabber on about how the Copper Beaches was quite the steal as it had been in foreclosure during the Eighties, John wondered if the time to choose between Mary and Sherlock had come.
Dupin smiled and rubbed his salt-and-peppered stubble thoughtfully. “Actually, I was thinking that the private sector might be the way to go after all.”
But Molly Hooper Lestrade was not the only woman shedding blood that night. While Violet had her duel  of wits with the Earl and Sherlock had been busy outmaneuvering Toller, Mary had her own mission to complete.
People, the general public, actually believed a high-functioning sociopath was in a relationship with an ice-queen.
“As theories go, it’s quite unlikely she did the deed herself although not quite implausible. As I have told you before, Jo-”
“Don’t judge me,” he snarled. “Violet told me it wasn’t worth watching after Season Four, but I have to disagree.” He pulled the ear buds out, his eyes locking on the file under John’s arm. “Case?” his eyes lighting up with interest.
Apologies for not posting last week. I messed up my wrist and hand - nothing serious, but enough that I was supposed to keep typing and swiping and scrolling  to a minimum (boo...)
“Oh, I know Wiggins,” Mary felt dread pooling in her gut. She hoped she could convince Wiggins to stay silent.  Wiggins
She even drank coffee and cola and didn’t immediately brush her teeth afterwards so they would become slightly discolored. She fought against her American vanity but there had been times she almost broke down and scrubbed her teeth with peroxide so they would whiten again…
Violet responded by pinching his big nose shut. Sherlock’s face immediately started turning bright pink.
“See you two later,” she said to both of them and even mustered a smile for Mary. Then she scrambled to her dirty, bare feet to chase after Sherlock.
“I don’t want to be married to her, but I don’t want her to die either.” John ran his hand over his tired face. “I wish I never met her. I wish I never married her. I wish I didn’t have a child with her. You know what I want, what I
"I found your number in a bunch of my stuff. They returned all of my things from my desk overseas, and I found your number in it. Good bloody thing, because I wasn't likely to remember it."
“What, you're trying to tell me you’ve never picked up, Three-Continents-Watson?” John scoffs at the nickname.
he pushes the door open to free his hand. It’s not trembling now, but his whole hand is seized up as blood catches along the skin of his knuckles. It’s already bruising and it’s likely to swell.
“… not everyone. Not exactly. But she’s ordinary in a truly boring way. No sign of any wrongdoings or secrets or interesting double life.”
When she looks coyly at the ground, looking up at him from behind her eyelashes and says, "So you have any plans with your girlfriend this weekend?" John smiles a crooked grin and says,
As Sherlock reads, John floats in and out of sleep, riding the waves of Sherlock's deliciously low voice. Every so often a passage pricks his ear and he listens, especially when he realises Sherlock is picking through the book to find poems, instead of just reading cover to cover.
Sherlock nods slowly, "You're welcome to stay, John. You and Rosie both, I'll do whatever I need to keep her safe. Of course. But don't do this just for me, what about when another woman comes along? you'll be wanting another mother for Rosie and you'll have to--"
"Stop thinking so loudly," Sherlock murmurs. "I don't want to go slow, John. I've wanted you for months and you've been so far away, and I want to, I want to touch you and kiss you and play for you and--" Now Sherlock is getting cut off, John's lips catching the words and swallowing them down. It's still only chaste, closed mouths and dry lips, but it's their first kiss and it lights a fire in John's heart in a different way than before, not burning it to ash but lighting it up, as if it was made for Sherlock to light, and the first touch of his lips on John's is a match for his unburnable heart and instead of pain it's just warmth and a soft glow, as loving and safe as any hearth.
I am not wrong, John. She stashes bags of powder in the hollow of the frame, and he just has to crack it open to get them. I imagine she can fit almost 20 bags in there, separating them in even spaces so the frame weighs the same all around. It’s clever, John, very clever.
The statement seems to shake Sherlock, and he’s struggling to his feet. John pointedly turns his gaze away as Sherlock wrestles to get the sheet out from his legs and wraps it around himself.
is a very real, proactive link to Sherlock. John could call Mycroft up and ask -- demand-- to know how to get in contact with Sherlock. It doesn't take a consulting genius to understand that Mycroft had been the one blocking their correspondence. But if he could just
Sherlock had changed his life is more ways than one; he’d given him hope for his life, a home for a few years, a best friend and a godfather for his daughter. He’d given him less lovely things, too: two years of debilitating grief, truths about his wife (though he’s unsure if he’s happy about that knowledge or not), a bit more danger than his ageing heart might be able to handle and piles and piles of regret.
in a way he couldn't imagine being a week ago, or a year ago or a decade ago. It would be suffocating, all of the feelings, if it wasn't so damn easy. To love Sherlock was as easy as breathing.
"Doctor Watson. This is getting tedious. You just got back from an active warzone, severely injured, adjusting to new life. Sherlock is of no concern of yours, and you none of his. Settle into civilian life, John, focus on getting a job, a wife, have some nice kids and a house in the suburbs. That is what you're made for. Good evening, John Watson."
"He treats me like a high school girl who should be 'focusing on her studies'" he pulls a face and John chuckles a little,
Not that he hadn’t thought about it, extensively in fact… but there was a time and place. And right now John couldn’t think about anything but Sherlock’s back and the anguished screams that sleep ripped from his throat.
He refuses to believe in it, despite his insecurities and mounting worries. He's learnt a bit from Sherlock, learnt to seek data and evidence to come to a likely conclusion. There is no evidence Sherlock feels this way, in fact, almost all of the evidence is to the contrary: Mycroft is intercepting them, why if not because Sherlock wouldn't abide by his agenda? What need would he have to get involved if Sherlock would carry out his will anyway?
"I'm good. Tired, but that's normal with that crazy girl," he says, gesturing at Rosie and smiling affectionately at her as she throws a big plastic ball across the room. "Heard anything from Lestrade? Any new cases or anything." Sherlock shakes his head, taking a drink of his tea,
"He's not been well, John" Mrs Hudson says, like she could read his mind. Maybe she could, do it like Sherlock at least. Could you develop his skill through osmosis? John really would like to find out. "Even with he's high, or when he's without it, he's making an awful racket on his violin, awful screeching. He stomps around so loud I can hear it downstairs and he makes an absolute mess of the kitchen. But since he's gotten back, he's been... different. Subdued, like something had been eating away at him and he didn't have enough of himself left to live. He's barely left his lat, only just went back to work today." John squeezes his eyes shut, trying to find comfort in the cup of tea in his hand even as guilt roils in his gut,
you sitting in the dark? What is that noise?” As though to supplement his question, the same scream cracks through the air, cut off by a sob. His head snaps towards the noise but Mrs Hudson only squeezes his arm, standing in the way of the door.
All he knows is heat and pain; painful heat like a lit cigarette against skin, and heated pain like the burn of an infection. He thinks it's coming from his shoulder, that's where it hurts the most, but it's also in his fingers, his hip, his collarbone, his toes, his heels and he wonders, quietly, if he's on fire.
"I'm not dating any other women, ever again, because I have no interest in it. I don't want to be with anyone else, because.... Well, to be bloody honest, because I want to be with
Wrapped up in a white sheet that is loose over one shoulder and slipping down to reveal a collarbone. His chest is lightly dusted with dark hairs, and his skin nearly shines white in the dimmed light of his room and
“He’s not a murderer!” John grouches. “I wanted to see you,” John admits, “and now I’m extra glad I came. What was that?”
Group therapy still remained a hindrance, but he still went. One day, when Sherlock felt particularly weak, Dr. Lestrade came to visit Sherlock. Sherlock tried to sit up, but gave up after trying too many times. Resigned, he reached over for the remote that would raise his bed so he could look at the good doctor.
Sherlock smiled, but didn’t comment on it. The two ended up talking more in depth about Molly’s plans during and after university, and what Sherlock planned on doing.
One day, when Sherlock is just lying in bed reading a book, he looks up to see the door opening, and in comes Molly. His face lights up with what has to be the first legitimate smile he’s had while in the hospital.
“Well, yeah. That… Ah. I know this is still coming at you pretty fast, but I do have a bit of good news. Erm, let’s see. I’m sure you know that you do have a wish you can make, if there's anything you want to do in your last month?”
Sherlock sighed softly. “I don’t have much longer left, do I. I would assume a month at best?” he asked as he stared sadly out the window, into the courtyard where he saw other patients sitting in their wheelchairs, accompanied by nurses. His thoughts wandered to what it would be like, where he could rest, free of pain and the sorrows that accompanied it.
Molly Hooper was Sherlock’s closest friend. They knew each other since they were in primary school, and had been fast friends. Molly and Sherlock both shared a certain taste for forensic science, and the two bonded over that. They were each other’s support systems, and were always there for each other. Molly was two years older than Sherlock, and was getting ready to leave for university overseas. Sherlock had neglected to tell her that he was dying, as he didn’t want her to worry.
Molly lights up with another grin. “Yea! I’m almost packed and I’m leaving in a week. I promise to visit you as much as I can before then.”
Sherlock looks over with a tired smile. “It’s as good as it gets. Tests, lab work, all day every day. What’s not to like? You get your finger pricked, arm prodded on a daily. It's everyone’s dream come true.” Sherlock says, with just a hint of malice laced in his voice. After a deep breath, he asks, “Are you almost ready to leave for university?”
“I’m not going to bother to ask how you’re feeling because, well…I can tell. I just came in today to check in and…” He trailed off, at a loss for words.
Sherlock became more and more depressed as time dragged on. Each day was motonanus and began to blur together. His routine rarely changed, with the exception of more and more tests and exams everyday. He noticed that he was beginning to slow down. The function of his body was deteriorating, and he was slowly using a wheelchair more and more to get around. He was in more considerable pain then normal, but was able to deal with it.
“He comes with us,” Sherlock told her, looking this way and that, watching out for whoever was pursuing them.
Curiosity piqued, she put the books she had already picked up back down. Reached for the photograph, she assumed the picture must have fallen out of one of the books.
Sherlock’s tiny heart swelled. “He may be wavering on the prison part. He all but threw himself at Mycroft, offering to sell Mary out in order to get Marissa back.”
He grabbed one of his favorite dressing robes, a lilac silk robe with a giant pomegranate embroidered on the back. He pulled it on with a jerk and belted it shut.
“Sorry, sorry,” Mary let Molly march ahead of her. She leaned over to Violet and whispered, “We’re going to a pub after this, right?”
Posting might be a bit sporadic until work settles down or I win the lottery, which ever comes first. :^)
Violet sank down onto the sofa as Gladstone went to claim Sherlock’s bed. Sherlock locked the door. Grabbing his Belstaff, he wrapped it around Violet so she could warm up. “Tell me everything,” he said, sitting next to her.
Sherlock actually laughed out loud at that. “Oh yes, of course. Silly me,” he bent forward and glared at Anthea, his eyes now gun-metal blue. “Ask your beloved Uncle Mickey about the Earl of Winchester. See what he has to say.”
As John was being slammed to the floor and handcuffed after the French police found his gun while frisking him, Violet sat in Mrs. Hudson’s frilly lounge. She felt more than just a bit suffocated since the small lounge was crammed full of overstuffed armchairs, plus the sofa, the coffee table, the outdated television set and the footrests. Not to mention there were tatted doilies draped over every possible surface and Victorian style wallpaper even uglier than what covered the walls  in 221B.
The driver of the car sipped his coffee from a Starbucks cup and watched The Cute Old Couple in the Red Brick House walk home.
“Tell me what you need,” Sherlock immediately spit out, unconsciously echoing Molly Hooper the night before The Fall.
“Sweetie, come on, it’s almost time to go, get off the phone,” Violet whined, tilting her head towards the entrance.
“She does, she has you,” Violet said, gently squeezing his arm, moving her thumb around in circles. Violet found herself treating Sherlock like a skittish horse at times. No sudden moves.
“You actually meant it, didn’t you,” Sherlock sounded slightly awestruck, as if he couldn’t believe that John would say anything but the truth. “You’d come for me.”
So John knew he was posturing, hiding some emotion he was not prepared to deal with behind a façade of good posture. John also noticed how his black brows beetled together, as they often did when he found himself in unfamiliar territory. Sherlock’s eyes were unreadable as usual. But the burgeoning crow’s feet surrounding them and faint lavender smudges beneath them were far more telling. So were the permanent creases in his forehead and the barest etchings of smile lines around the ridiculously full lips. The years of work and exile and the…
“We need to ice and tape your fingers,” he rumbled as he stood up. “Now, if you’re finished with your temper tantrum, shall we go home?”
She exited out the back of the building, slipping through the damp and dank alleyways of Camden, heart palpitating as she ran, her boots splashing in the rank puddles. Her hands felt icy and cold, despite her gloves.
Adoption had been just about as heartbreaking as IVF. One young mother had miscarried. Two others got cold feet about giving their babies up. After the second mother had changed her mind, Hope had sobbed, “Maybe we should just get a dog.”
He stood in front of her, tilting her chin up with his fingertip. “We talked about this,” he lightly ran his thumb along her chin. “No sentiment. Don’t give my brother the pleasure of your pain.”
“Very kind,” Violet lied. “He made some very astute observations earlier and I would appreciate the opportunity to hear him elaborate on the points he made without the time constraints we have during the formal meeting. I am extremely interested in his insight to such matters as well as some other challenges the United States face in international affairs.”
If the theme and setting of a particular problem has already appeared in an earlier problem without the knowledge of the later composer, the problem is said to be anticipated. The position does not have to be exactly the same, just very similar. Where this is done deliberately by the later composer, the term plagiarised is used. There is a real chance of anticipation if the problem has a relatively simple theme, since there are only a finite number of positions and themes, and chess problems have been composed for hundreds of years. However, anticipations are not always noticed immediately
John had no idea what game was playing or even what sport. He didn’t care. He just wanted a drink. Now.
“No big deal,” Victor picked up one of the picture frames. “I’ve just been going through your shit while you were gone. Is this you?” he showed Sherlock a picture of himself and his beloved old dog, Redbeard. When Sherlock nodded, flushing slightly, Victor chuckled “You were a scrawny little git when you were a kid, weren’t you?” Victor set the picture down again and picked a different one up as Sherlock kicked off his trainers. “What about this guy?” Victor sat down on Sherlock’s bed, holding up the frame. “I recognize you, who wouldn’t with that mop of hair, and Mycroft… who’s the older bloke?”
But Violet was barely listening to Mary. She rubbed her forehead as she watched the town disappear behind her as they headed towards the Holmes estates.
“Ah yes, the lovely Scowerers,” John rolled his eyes. “Don’t think I didn’t notice you slipping out of bed to go read that ruddy file some more.”
So he ate his sandwich and soup with indecent haste. Downed a quick cup of tea, paid his bill then hobbled after Violet.
The chest pain was especially concerning. John had worried for a long time now whether or not Sherlock had really physically recovered not just from the shooting but from all the traumas his body had sustained since The Fall.
He deliberately left Mary out of that equation. But Sherlock immediately factored her back in, “Because I knew you and Mary could provide her stability.”
Mycroft observed that John no longer had military short hair . Though he had let it grow out longer, he kept it neatly combed and pomaded back. It suited him much better than the ten-quid cut he usually sported. But there was no sandy-blond colour left in his hair. It had gone mostly silver with streaks of ivory starting to show here and there. There were also more lines around his dark, expressive eyes than ever before.
The older woman looked like she could be a toffee-nosed bitch, with her expensive handbag and shoes. Her hair was perfect and her dress cost more than Alex’s car. But the woman’s grief was very real. “My daughter, Evelyn. Evie, everyone calls her Evie, never came home Thursday night. And she’s still missing. She’s not that kind of girl to just vanish off the face of the earth. Especially now, she got a job you see. Two jobs really, a proper job and an acting job.”
Reluctantly, she set her gun down on the chair. But she left the safety off. Then she slowly knelt down by her rucksack and peeled off her gloves. “Brrr,” she complained, rubbing her hands together. But it was easier to dig through her belongings without the gloves. She found a compact of pressed powder, concealer, mascara, a tube of lipstick and fake eyeglasses. Setting her glasses and the other cosmetics on the seat of the chair, Violet remained in a crouch. Violet unscrewed the wand from the concealer and then flipped open the compact. Studying her wan face as she daubed cover-up under her eyes and on her scar, she reviewed and revisited what she knew about Margaux Vos.
Sherlock took out his miniature magnifying glass and opened it. Crouching down, he peered into the cool box, the lid still off, still laying exactly where it landed after Susan had flipped it off.
he won’t stoop to; blackmail, extortion, kidnap, murder, rape and he gets away with it because he wears a smart suit and talks nice and proper. He nearly wiped us out and got one of our brothers killed. If he is paying off the Midnight Crew as well as in debt to the Red-Headed League, we are all up shit creek lads.”
But the shine had finally come off Mary for Sherlock, now that he witnessed firsthand how very miserable John was with her.
Sucking in great, big whooping gulps of air, she ripped the fake glasses off her face and shoved them in her coat pocket. She then wiped her wet face on her coat sleeve like a child. Despite the throbbing ache in her fingers and arms and legs and abs (all repercussions from the explosion at her clinic) she pulled her Triumph out from behind its hiding place. She pressed her lips together as she swung a sore and aching leg over the saddle of the bike. She ripped the plastic brace off her fingers so they could be mobile. She sobbed again, this time from pain as she squeezed the throttle, her sprained fingers protesting. But the pain was bearable, so she switched the ignition on, revved the throttle, knocked the kickstand up with the heel of her boot and backed up the bike.
Even though he quailed at the prospect of losing the life he knew, he stoutly said, “Poverty doesn’t frighten me.”
“Yes, right,” Victor was also nonplussed. They all got out of the paddle pool, conscious of the parents and children’s eyes on them.
Mary was undeterred. “How do we know you’re not lying, trying to trick me and John? How do we know that was really Violet Hunter in the video? For all we know, you dressed up a clever actress to look like her and sound like her.”
Mycroft crossed his arms and kept his eyes on John’s retreating figure growing smaller and smaller. Only then did he close his eyes and recall John’s face when he asked him what Sherlock was keeping from him. Remembered every micro-expression, every unconscious action, the slightest movement of his fingertips, the briefest catch of his breath.
The cane, of course, had been Part of the Act. John didn’t like how he couldn’t hold onto his gun while using the crutches. He could move so much faster on the crutches than he could gimping along with his old cane.
Their new lodgings were tiny, even compared to the houseboat. But there was a private washroom attached to it. No shower or bath, but at least a private loo and sink to wash up.
It didn’t seem clever at first glance. But when one realized just how narcissistic Rucastle was and how overwhelmed Mrs. Toller was by mopping up her son’s messes not to mention to day-to-day responsibilities running the household as well as “nursing” Tristan, it was indeed a very clever hiding place after all.
“Three reasons,” she lifted her pointer finger. “It involved your brother,” she added her middle finger, “It happened right after
“Except, your heart chose another ‘team’,” Dupin pointed out then decided to show him mercy. “But as you said to your wife, we must focus on finding
“Indeed,” Sherlock drawled, a bit of his façade slipping. He covered the slip by taking a sip of his drink, grimacing slightly at the taste.
John had just finished shaving when his mobile chirped. He wiped the remaining traces of shaving foam off his face and retrieved his mobile from the bedside table.
“OW!” Sherlock jerked away, clapping his hand over the mouth that had been recently punched by Greg Lestrade.
“Well, I was actually hoping to take you and Sherlock out to an early lunch,” she sounded so wistful, Violet found her heart hurting. Violet was fully aware of Sherlock’s family history and the role Mrs. Holmes played not to mention she had listened to Sherlock complain about his mother’s overbearing nature, but still…
“I was just leaving,” Mycroft started to stand up. “I trust you’ll forget anything you may have heard, Detective-Inspector.”
“Hello?” he called out. He saw Sherlock’s overnight bag and laptop carry-on bag leaning against John’s old chair. His Belstaff and his blue-and-purple checked scarf were neatly draped over John’s chair as well. “Hello?” he called out again, unwinding his scarf and shucking off his heavy parka. The weather, while not damp (for once), had become frigid again. This was proving to be a most miserable November.
,” there was an uncharacteristic sneer in John’s voice now. “When, for all we know, it was Mary who put a bullet in my sister’s head.”
So, really, it was alright that Sherlock didn’t come. Especially since Patricia and her entire family thought he was straight and his family thought they had successfully prayed away the gay.
Mycroft stated at his smart phone, shaking his head. The woman probably used all of ten words during their entire conversation.
“And ours,” John said glumly, surveying the lounge. It very much reminded John of the way 221B could look when Sherlock hit a wall with a case. There were maps and photographs and red string slung everywhere, connecting the dots.
“That’s what she said,” John’s eyes sparkled mischievously as Mary playfully slapped his unhurt arm, giggling like a schoolgirl.
He never said anything to Violet because someone like her didn’t have the luxury of creating permanent relationships. She might be here today, gone tomorrow. He didn’t need to add to her already considerable anxiety.
“How? With his alabaster skin, he’d not only stick out like a sore thumb, he’d probably glow in the dark.”
“Oh, God, Victor,” there was more than a hint of a whine in Sherlock’s voice as he thumped his head against his headrest. “At least let me get high first before you make me discuss
“Marie Devine**,” Mousy Woman said quickly. She spoke The King’s English but with a very faint Russian accent. The unobservant would barely register it. However, John noticed, thanks to years of following Sherlock around on cases.
