memo by a State Department official that had been released a few months after Tony’s recovery. It hadn’t contained any images, but lines like
“Oh, hey, Steve.” Bruce waved awkwardly, then looked at his hand like he wasn’t sure what it was doing.
A browser window popped up on the tablet, displacing the painting program. Steve thought about where he’d done his previous research and typed in “Tony Stark Wikipedia.” When the familiar article loaded, it was covered in yellow annotations, everything from corrected dates to much more editorial comments:
“Paragon of virtue, that’s me.” Tony looked him over. Steve wasn’t wearing anything special, just a pair of undershorts and a sleeveless tank he’d put on so he could try on his new clothes over them, but there was unmistakable heat in Tony’s gaze. “You want to put on your new clothes so I can peel them off again?”
Tony grimaced and scrubbed one hand through his hair. Steve wondered just how long ago he and Ms. Potts had called it quits. Recently enough that Tony was on his best behavior, or something close to it. “Yeah, okay. Probably a good point. So, no nookie,” Tony said. “How about lunch? Want to put on your new clothes and have lunch with me?”
“No,” Tony said, pointing at Steve, then at the corner of the workshop, where a camera Steve hadn’t noticed was squarely facing Tony. “Don’t even. You two are not allowed to gang up on me, that’s not how this is going to work.”
“You call that peeling?” Steve said, but obligingly ducked his head and raised his arms. Tony was more careful than he expected with the collar, stretching it with his fingers so it didn’t catch on Steve’s ears. “If I were a banana, I’d bruise.”
“Thanks,” the man said, wiping an arm across his forehead. “Do you need anything else, Captain Rogers?”
“My privacy protocols necessarily restrict what I am able to disclose. Despite what his public appearances would suggest, Sir is quite conscious of information privacy. His own, at least,” JARVIS added dryly.
“Oh, you’re very welcome, Captain Rogers.” Peter looked like he was about sixteen, but if he was working for Stark Industries he was probably at least college age. Everyone looked young to Steve nowadays.
“Okay.” Steve wasn’t going to get bored. Steve had a tablet with JARVIS on it and a recon mission to finish. “See you later.”
It wasn’t worth the risk. Steve knew that, and he understood it, but he was still unreasonably disappointed when Tony stood up without trying to touch him at all.
Content warnings for internalized ableism about mental health and a mention of possible suicidal ideation, both present very briefly.
,” Peter whispered even more quietly. He cleared his throat and stood up as tall as possible. “Steve. Okay. Nice to meet you, Steve. Let me know if you need anything else. Or, I guess, let JARVIS know, and he’ll let me know? Or I could give you my phone number? Or--”
Steve considered putting on one of the suits, but that seemed too formal, even though Tony was wearing a suit himself. This wasn’t a business lunch. He pulled dark jeans over his shorts and put on one of the plain white t-shirts, then caught a glimpse of himself reflected in the metal side of the garment rack. His own reflection surprised him. He looked...comfortable, almost, in his soft clothes and bare feet, standing in the middle of Tony’s living room. Like he belonged there.
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, voice casual. “You know the story anyway. It’s not like it’ll be a surprise.”
“Thanks,” Steve repeated, hoping robots couldn’t identify blushes. “I got this. Could you do me a favor and clean the kitchen? I dropped some rice in there earlier.”
It couldn’t last, he knew, but for however long he got to have this, he was going to let himself pretend.
Steve hadn't gotten a chance to really look at Tony last night. He had been so caught up in what he was feeling that he'd forgotten to pay attention to anything but Tony's touch, his darkly amused voice, the pleasure he’d wrung out of Steve’s body. He looked now, letting his eyes roam over Tony's well-groomed facial hair and slim-cut suit, everything meticulous and distinctive. Nobody would ever mistake him for anyone else, not even at a glance.
If Tony wanted to buy him a new wardrobe, well, Steve knew Tony could afford it. “Okay. Thanks, JARVIS.”
"Roll it, JARVIS," Tony ordered, and the movie started to play. Steve felt a moment of vertigo at the juxtaposition between the opening moments of the film, sharper than his pre-serum memories recalled it, and the heat and smell of Tony along his side. Both were familiar, but in wildly different contexts.
“You like it.” Steve didn’t try to free his hands, just leaned forward until he could lick a broad stripe across Tony’s nipple.
They’d barely stepped out of the elevator before Tony was pulling him across the room by his belt loops. “No couch this time, c’mon, bed.”
Steve looked around the nearly immaculate penthouse and decided he was better off not asking what JARVIS felt was disorderly about it. “That’s very helpful of you,” he told Peep, who gave him a little rising trill in response. Steve stepped aside and watched Peep trundle over to the sofa.
He didn't move like a fighter, but like a dancer, all quicksilver turns and expressive gestures. There was strength in the spread of his shoulders, his surprisingly muscular biceps, the tight curve of his ass. He moved whenever he talked, communicating with his whole body. Steve could never quite predict when Tony was going to lean in, elbows on the table and fork stabbing forward for emphasis, and when he was going to relax back into his chair, satisfied his point had been made.
, you absolute maniac. I remember how you fought against the Chitauri, and then I read the after-action reports, which are even
“You’ll be sensitive after,” Tony said, relentlessly putting into words the thoughts that were making Steve’s cheeks burn even hotter than before. “But that didn’t seem like much of a problem yesterday, either.”
“An American original,” Steve agreed, and Tony’s mouth kicked up at the corner. Steve ran both his hands over the sides of Tony’s chest, neither lingering on nor avoiding the edges of the scar tissue radiating out from the arc reactor. Tony was still rigid under his hands, so Steve slid his fingers down to Tony’s bare ass and goosed him.
, Steve didn’t say. “What are you working on today?” he asked instead. Tony had drawn a battery design across two napkins and was diagramming the improvements he wanted to make on a third when a server arrived with their cheeseburgers. Steve asked enough follow-up questions to keep Tony talking throughout the meal. He was paying some attention to the conversation, but mostly he was watching Tony.
“You get dressed, I’ll be back.” Tony picked up the bag of Steve’s old clothes and walked out of the room with a spring in his step.
Eventually it got too bright for Steve to avoid thinking about how he was standing by a window with only a blanket saving him from public indecency. Stark Tower was pretty high up, but there were already traffic helicopters circling not too far away. Steve didn’t want to risk becoming part of the local news’ morning bulletin.
Tony made a hilariously indignant face when Steve came back into the atrium and presented him with a mug of steaming milk. "Warm milk? Seriously? What am I, seven years old?"
“This unit is designated Peep,” JARVIS said. “Peep was originally intended to greet visitors in the lobby, but turned out to be, for lack of a better term, shy. Sir felt it was best that Peep have a more limited interaction with the public. Peep maintains order in the penthouse, to the degree that such a thing is possible.”
The elevator doors closed on the rest of Peter’s sentence. Steve stared at the doors bemusedly before turning to the rack of clothes. He started re-arranging the hangers, sorting from reasonable picks (soft t-shirts, flannel button-downs, warm sweaters, plain collared shirts that could go under a suit jacket) on the left, to things he thought were probably pranks (a turtleneck with a big faux-fur poof at the collar, a suit coat with a metallic gold sheen, a pair of skin-tight jeans with so many rips Steve was sure they’d fall apart if he tried to wash them) on the right. He’d sorted through most of it by the time the elevator opened and Tony sauntered out.
Peep emerged holding a spray bottle and a small cloth, then rolled directly towards the new stain on the sofa’s arm.
Tony pulled the waistband of Steve’s shorts down to his thighs. Steve let out a sigh of relief at being freed that promptly turned into a yelp when Tony took his cock in hand and
Steve sucked again, adding a scrape of teeth this time, and Tony’s hands tightened on his wrists. He inhaled sharply as the feeling of being restrained triggered a reflexive burst of heightened awareness. His nerve endings all woke up at once.
Steve swiped his finger across the screen, leaving a wide streak of electric blue. “SHIELD gave me a briefing on Tony Stark before we met. It was only five paragraphs long. After the Chitauri invasion, I did my own research, but there’s a lot of information out there. I’m not sure what sources to trust. I was hoping you could help me out.”
Tony stepped into the gap. “He’s staying with me for a while. We were about to have dinner, want to join us?”
It was a strange feeling, sorting through the clothing looking for something to wear for Tony. Steve didn’t have to think about how fashions had changed, or what his clothes might be signalling to a modern audience. All he had to do was wear something Tony wanted to take off. Even if he didn’t have the time now, he would later, and Steve could admit in the privacy of his own head that he wanted Tony to be thinking of him during his meetings. Given how tight all of the shirts were, that wasn’t going to be difficult.
Steve set the tablet carefully onto the table. There was nothing and nobody to fight here. The attackers were long gone, and the damage long since done.
“Only the little death.” Tony shifted his hips experimentally, finding a new angle, and Steve choked on nothing. “Maybe a few little deaths, depending.”
Steve was rinsing out the cloth in the bathroom sink when the elevator doors opened. He hung the cloth over the shower rod and went back out to the living room. A young man wearing a red uniform trimmed in gold braid was pulling a big rack of clothing, the kind they had in department stores, out of the elevator.
“I’m going to head to the workshop after this meeting so I get enough work done to stay in tomorrow. If you get bored, get JARVIS to show you how the TV and stuff works.”
Steve stood up fast and went back to the window. There were people on the sidewalks. Of course there were, this was still New York. He could find a bench to sit on where it was too loud to think, but in these clothes that would mean reappearing on SHIELD’s radar. The sense of being pinned down was a sour twist in his belly.
“Thank you,” Steve told the robot. The robot chirped and wheeled away, bumping into the corner of a lab bench as it passed. Steve sat on the couch and looked around for something to draw. There were so many options it was a little overwhelming, but Steve eventually settled on a half-disassembled Iron Man armor on a nearby table. He started sketching the helmet lying on its side next to an empty pair of gauntlets.
“When I get too involved in something like this, I forget my own strength.” When he’d spent a summer on the USO tour circuit, they’d sometimes stopped in at towns having county fairs. Steve had broken more than a few carnival games before he’d learned to stop playing. It wasn’t worth the fuss and apologizing after, no matter how surreally hilarious it had been to watch the bell of the high striker fly off the machine when Steve swung the hammer.
Tony went satisfyingly still. Steve kept his expression mild, but inside he felt a little surge of glee. It was fun to surprise Tony. He was already getting addicted to the freedom of doing what came naturally instead of filtering everything he said through the Captain America™ lens.
Steve’s feet had carried him to the elevator before he’d decided he was leaving. He didn’t try to resist. “Is that in the Tower? Can I see him?”
“Eyes open,” Tony said, a little sharp. Steve forced his eyelids up. He wasn’t sure when he’d closed them. Tony was straddling his legs and look down at him, his dark eyes glittering blue from the light of the reactor.
Some of them were drawings of Tony, and Steve got a squirmy hot feeling knowing that Tony had looked at those, but most of them depicted the armor or other projects Steve could see from the couch. Tony was holding a drawing of the disassembled Iron Man helmet close to his face, studying the details.
Steve hesitated for a few seconds, then slid out of bed. If Tony had already left again, gone to his workshop or wherever he went when he wasn’t sleeping, so be it, but Steve knew he wasn’t going to be able to ignore this for long, not if it happened regularly. He’d spent too long alert for teammates in trouble, monitoring his men’s moods by how many cigarettes Monty had hoarded and how often Dum Dum combed out his mustache and how many times Bucky startled silently awake in the next bedroll over. He might as well figure out how to handle this now.
Steve looked up. Tony was standing over the bench, turning the visor over in his hands, staring at nothing. “What’s a lot?”
“Who’s he, a porn star?” Tony asked. He flopped his head over the back of the couch and stared at the ceiling.
“Already did.” Tony waggled his phone, then frowned. “Did you have a phone apart from SHIELD’s spyware brick? No, of course not, what am I saying, why would they give you anything that would make it harder for them to eavesdrop? I’ll have one sent up.”
Tony had come around the side of the workbench, standing where he could see all of Steve, and Steve could see all of him. He was holding himself very still. Steve wet his lips and continued. “I hope you never get hurt like that again, not by someone deliberately hurting you to make you break. But it’s not the worst thing I’ve seen. Not even close. When I see the arc reactor, I think about how you kept yourself alive. How you survived. I see you fly and it makes me think about what you can do, the people you’ve saved. That nuke would have hit New York. I know you’re not a soldier, but you’re not a civilian anymore, and neither am I. This is what we do. The risks we take, those are part of who we are. So no, it doesn’t put me off. It doesn’t scare me.”
“Steve. You wound me,” Tony said, putting his hand over his chest. “If it were my handiwork, it would say PROPERTY OF STARK INDUSTRIES.”
It was a treat to get to closely observe the inside of something he’d only seen the surface of before, and he got lost in all the little angles and curves hidden inside the armor. At some point he heard the blowtorch start up again.
“Nonono,” Steve blurted, surging forward to physically block the robot’s access to the sofa. “Don’t worry about that, I’m cleaning that, I’ll clean it right now, thank you.”
“Show-off. Using serum-enhanced reflexes is cheating, you know.” Tony’s phone vibrated in his pocket. “That’s my five-minute warning. Do me a favor and finish my leftovers.”
Steve blew out a slow breath and set the tablet aside. He hadn’t thought about Pepper until that morning. Tony hadn’t mentioned anything about their relationship during his visits to SHIELD, but Steve had known from SHIELD gossip that they were rumored to be involved. Knowing they weren’t anymore sent relief and guilt coursing through him: relief that Tony was unattached, that Steve wasn’t ruining someone else’s happiness by taking comfort where he could, and guilt that he was happy about someone else’s unhappiness.
Tony stood motionless while Steve looked at him. His breathing was too controlled. Steve wasn’t sure what reaction Tony was braced for, exactly, but he knew this wasn’t the moment to push. “Tony?” he said carefully.
“It’s been more dying-in-space lately than dying-in-Afghanistan, so, that’s something. Variety!” Tony twirled one finger in a little circle, then let his hand fall limply into his lap.
One line caught his particular attention: “Stark is rumored to be dating Pepper Potts, the CEO and second-largest shareholder of Stark Industries.” JARVIS had added a note reading
“When I was a kid,” Steve said, slowly, feeling his way through every sentence, “I went to church every Sunday. The priest at church, the nuns at school, they told us all about hell. I thought it was somewhere you could only go when you were dead. And then I went to war. I saw things that I didn’t know could exist on earth. There were things in the Nazi camps, in the Hydra labs, that were worse than anything I could have imagined. I still dream about them, sometimes.”
with a link to a very short interview Ms. Potts had given to a reporter where she confirmed her relationship with Mr. Stark had ended and declined to comment further.
It was nice to eat without being stared at, but it was weird to be eating in a room so silent he could hear himself swallowing. It contrasted sharply with how it had been to eat with his men, and he couldn’t help but remember: Morita and Dum Dum trading jibes, Monty’s constant expression of fastidious martyrdom at whatever they’d scraped together that week, Dernier adding handfuls of weeds that might or might not have been poisonous to his portion, Bucky attacking his food like it would get up and run away if he stopped to chew--
“Don’t,” Steve said, his earlier fear flowing easily, too easily, into anger, his body already primed for a fight. He squared his feet and folded his hands behind his back in a bid for control. “Don’t, Tony. If you don’t want to talk about it, just tell me that.”
“You don’t say,” Tony said, with exaggerated surprise. “Why is that a problem? It’s an arcade game, competition is the point.” The pinball machine displayed a high-score board, “IRON MAN” filling all the slots. It was funny until Steve wondered how many games Tony had played by himself, alone in the giant room. Or maybe he was just really good at pinball.
“Is this doing it for you?” Tony stepped back, ignoring Steve’s small sound of disappointment, and brought Steve’s wrists together in front of their chests. He used his grip to walk Steve backwards towards the bed. “Is it the pressure on your wrists, being caught by something, or me holding you specifically?”
. Not to mention what you’ve gotten up to on those little side-missions SHIELD’s been throwing you into. Don’t think I don’t know about those. You know parachutes are a thing, right? I could have sworn they had parachutes in the 40s.”
“You sure are,” Steve agreed mildly, and re-opened his sketchbook. He kept his head down and his pencil busy until the sounds of welding started up again. This time, once Tony was safely distracted by his work, he flipped the page and started sketching Tony instead, trying to capture the deft grace of Tony’s fingers and the focused calculation in his eyes.
“Of course,” Steve said, a bloom of pleasure unfurling in his chest. He was almost embarrassed by the strength of it. Tony wouldn’t give unearned compliments, and he definitely wouldn’t use second-rate work for anything to do with his company. If he wanted to use Steve’s drawings to advertise his inventions, it was because he thought they were good work, full stop. “Just let me know what you want me to draw.”
Tony’s eyes jerked to his, his face unsettlingly remote. “Well, she wasn’t thrilled. Seeing the aftermath of your boss’s non-consensual body modification isn’t fun. Being reminded of the torture your boyfriend went through every time he takes off his shirt is kind of a bummer. Hearing his screaming nightmares after he nearly dies flying a nuke through a wormhole into space is even worse, or so I’m reliably informed, especially when he can’t promise he’ll never do it again.” Tony’s hand had crept up to cover the arc reactor. He pulled it away as soon as he saw Steve looking and put both both hands flat on the workbench. “It wasn’t easy for her. It wouldn’t be easy for anyone.”
As soon as they’d finished eating, Bruce promised Tony he’d stop by his lab the next morning to play with biofuel cells, gave Steve a slightly less awkward wave goodnight, and slipped off to his own floor. Steve went exploring while Tony made himself an after dinner espresso--no wonder he didn’t sleep much--and wound up in a room that Tony called a “game room,” but which was bigger than any arcade Steve had seen. Tony appeared in the doorway while Steve was examining a space-themed pinball machine, his fingers looped together behind his back while he leaned in to look.
me when you’re--” Steve’s voice pitched high and cut off as Tony lowered himself another inch in an agonizingly pleasurable slide. He bit his tongue hard until he backed off from the edge of coming.
“You caught me.” Tony scrubbed his fingers on a napkin and let his eyes linger on Steve’s lips a little too long to be casual. Steve was newly conscious of the background chatter of people around them; Tony’s employees, who would presumably notice and have opinions about it if Tony kissed a man in the middle of the cafeteria. And if anyone recognized Steve, they would see Tony kissing
Tony pushed him back hard enough that he hit the bed and bounced, then knee-walked onto the mattress to loom over him. “I can work with that. Hands on the headboard.”
Steve was smart enough not to ask. The last time he brought up Howard hadn’t gone particularly well, and he had no desire to have a repeat of their helicarrier shouting match while he was close to naked in Tony’s guest bedroom. He gripped the waistband of his briefs in both hands when Tony reached for it. “You’re overdressed for this party.”
Tony glanced at him, then took a second, more evaluating look. Only under Tony’s scrutiny did Steve realize he was blushing just from hearing Tony compliment his work.
“Right, okay, I’m, I’m just gonna go.” Peter pointed his thumb over his shoulder at the elevator, while he was backing into it. “Nice to meet you! Enjoy getting dressed! I mean, enjoy wearing clothes. I mean--”
“I got that impression, yeah.” In a lot of the interviews Tony gave, especially ones where he’d been jumped by paparazzi instead of calling a formal press conference, he blithely confessed to being hungover or having spent the last seventy-two hours in bed with someone (or several someones), but he would also redirect or shut down any question that he didn’t want to answer. Tony was brazen, but only on his own terms. “I’m not asking for anything you’re not allowed to tell me. I can find plenty of information on my own, but a lot of it is sensationalized, and I don’t have the background to know what’s accurate. Can you help me sort through what’s out there?”
“Tony, I’m sorry, I can’t wait,” Steve gasped. The pressure, the heat, was already almost too much. He was so worked up already, there was no way he’d be able to last when Tony really got going.
It was four, in the end, which was good enough for Tony to finally let himself go and come on Steve’s heaving chest, but he had a worryingly analytical look that made Steve think he wasn’t getting away with not breaking his record for most orgasms in a night for very long. It was hard to worry about it. Steve passed out before Tony even finished cleaning them both up, asleep as soon as he knew Tony didn’t need him for anything else.
“Well, kinda. It depends on whether you’re asking Ms. Potts or Mr. Stark. I’m an intern?” Peter said, like he was apologizing for something. “So.”
“That’s the idea,” Tony said, a little breathless. He’d taken in the head of Steve’s cock and was moving a slick hand along the rest, getting it coated with lube before rocking down experimentally. “Hold still.”
Peep folded Steve’s discarded blanket into a precisely straight rectangle, aligning its corners with the seat cushions. After doing a circuit around the sofa, Peep rolled back to the foyer closet. Steve followed, fascinated by the way Peep moved; it rolled on a central ball and waved its arms to counter-balance on turns. The result was both uncanny and graceful.
Tony gave him a smile that didn’t reach his eyes and tapped twice on his chest, where the blue of the arc reactor shone through his worn t-shirt. “This. Me, in general. I do realize that. It’s not that I don’t--” He cut himself off and made an expansive gesture towards the wall of the lab where his suits were lined up. They were powered down, their weapons hidden under the armor’s sleek curves, but Steve had only needed one glance at the Iron Man suit to know it was for combat. “It’s bad enough that I wear a metal suit and fly around with aliens shooting at me, at least that’s got a kind of reckless nobility of purpose, but this,” Tony said, rubbing the heel of his hand in a semi-circle under the reactor, “was just the result of my own short-sighted idiocy.”
It wasn't the worst idea, Steve supposed. Steve really didn't want to wear his old clothes outside the safety of Stark Tower and suddenly reappear on SHIELD's grid. Borrowing clothes from Tony would only get him so far, given how different their sizes were. Tony projected presence like a much larger man, but he was a good three inches shorter than Steve (and he wore his pants a lot tighter).
“I just needed to see that you were okay.” Steve was embarrassed now by the force of his reaction, by how viscerally he had needed to lay eyes on Tony to believe that he was all right. He would have to be careful not to do something that revealing again. This had already been enough to spook Tony. “I don’t like that you got hurt. I’m never going to like it. I’m just not going to be surprised when it happens.”
"I won't," Steve said immediately, because Tony was stiff and avoiding his eyes, and that was all wrong. He stepped in close again, trying to remind Tony that he wasn’t on display for an audience. “Look at me, okay? There we go. It’s just me.”
“Of course not, that would be petty and dramatic. I’m going to have them dry-cleaned, then send the bill to Fury.”
Tony glared at him. Steve was surprised to feel a smile growing wider on his face. He wasn’t sure when it had shown up.
“When I was helping Buck’s Ma make dinner. She was from Indiana. She hated the corn we got in the city, always said it was mealy, but she bought it anyway when she could find it.” Steve lifted his feet when Tony took his pants down to his ankles. Tony tugged his socks off at the same time, leaving Steve in just his new undershorts. “When did you, Manhattan?”
Still, he knew how to deal with nightmares. He could wake up and feel relief that it was over, that what he’d dreamed about hadn’t actually happened. Far worse were the dreams where he was sitting at his kitchen table in Brooklyn, Glenn Miller playing on the wireless, the air coming through the window reeking of garbage and cigarettes, his sleeves rolled up carefully past his bony elbows so his cuffs didn't smear the drawing he was working on. The past was a scab that his mind couldn't stop picking away at while he slept.
“It’s not a sculpture, you know.” Tony set his already empty cup on the next machine over and poked the power button. They watched the pinball machine turn on, the tiny space shuttle figurine glowing white as the case lit up. Steve had heard a lot about man walking on the moon in the first weeks after he woke up, the glorious achievement of mankind reaching out to explore the universe; it had taken another month of history briefings to find out the Apollo missions only got funded because they were part of the Cold War. Everything came back to a fight in the end. “You’re allowed to touch it.”
By the time Tony emerged, there was a wet spot on Steve’s briefs over the bulge of his erection. Tony raised his eyebrows and Steve went red all the way to his navel.
“Yep. I heard you were embracing the power of home shopping delivery and wanted to see the results. This your old stuff? Fantastic,” Tony said, stuffing Steve’s old SHIELD clothes into one of the paper bags last night’s take-out had come in.
Still working on this! I think the next chapter won't take as long to get ready because I've got most of it written, but I'm treating this like a very low-stress project that happens when it happens, so I'm hesitant to make promises. Thanks to all of you who are sticking with it!
“Captain Rogers, you are close to breaking the tablet.” JARVIS sounded distinctly alarmed. Steve noted the fact without reacting to it. His vision was sharp, his hands shaking slightly. His body had ramped up for combat.
The tablet was inert for a few seconds while Steve just looked at it, admiring the translucent design, before a painting app opened without Steve needing to tap anything. Steve played with it for a while. He wasn’t trying to do anything fancy, just selecting different colors and trying out the different brush types, enjoying the sensation of finger painting without getting his hands messy. "JARVIS?"
Tony’s head rolled to the side, his cheek resting against Steve’s hair. He wasn’t asleep, his breathing was too fast for that, but he was relaxing bit by bit. Steve was glad. He couldn’t get rid of his own dreams, but maybe he could help Tony come down from his. He closed his eyes, the score underpinning the film fading into the background as he focused on the sound of Tony breathing. Having Tony pressed up warm against his side was almost like sleeping in the same bed.
“How did you put it in that press conference where you told everyone about it? JARVIS, can you play that audio?”
Tony looked up fast when Steve came charging into the workshop. Steve stopped just inside the doors and looked him over. Tony was fine, of course. Probably wondering why Steve had just burst into his workshop in the middle of the afternoon, but alive and whole and unharmed. That was enough to let the knot in Steve’s stomach loosen.
Steve’s baser self stirred at the offer, but Tony sounded exhausted. “Maybe later. You ever watch Buster Keaton films?”
“Oh, of course, my mistake.” Steve filed the shirt on the right-hand side of the rack, then around so he got to watch Tony’s face as he said, “If you gave me a shirt like that, I might wear it for you.”
Dinner was quiet, but not in a bad way. Tony had pasta delivered to a level of the Tower that Steve hadn’t seen before, a communal floor accessible from all the residential apartments that had theaters and attractions instead of bedrooms. The table where they ate could have sat twenty. They occupied one end of the long oval, Tony sitting at the head with his elbows on either side of his plate, dishing out food and bullying Bruce into taking seconds and generally directing the meal like it was a board meeting. Tony, unsurprisingly, carried most of the conversation, but he kept the topic bouncing between Bruce’s projects and the green energy work SI was doing without getting more technical than Steve could follow. Steve talked more than he expected to, mostly about architecture, once Bruce revealed that one of his current projects was sustainable building design. Bruce was restful company.
information if asked, so long as that information isn’t restricted. If you would be amenable, I could provide a real-time fact-check on any information regarding Sir that you encounter in your research, based on my own knowledge. Would you like me to demonstrate?”
For now, Steve could have this. He could stand in Tony’s home and be sure of his welcome. Tony had said they could do this as long as they both wanted to, and Tony’s interest was palpably clear. Eventually he would get bored, and Steve would have to go back to how things had been before--but not yet. Steve could have this, a vacation from the purpose he’d been made for, from the violence and loss that had shaped him, until then.
“No, but thanks for bringing this up, uh,” Steve looked for a nametag and saw an embroidered patch on the man’s jacket that read
He turned away fast, a little afraid of how much he liked it. It wasn’t safe to get used to this, to rely overmuch on Tony’s generosity. He couldn’t stay in the Tower forever, in self-imposed exile; someday the world would need to be saved again, and Steve knew he wouldn’t be able to ignore it if someone needed his help. He would need to put on the suit and lift the shield, no matter how heavy it felt.
Steve groaned and let his head fall back against the bed, pressing his crown into the headboard. He already knew where this was going.
“Captain Rogers,” JARVIS was saying, dimly. Steve thought maybe JARVIS had been saying it for a while. He couldn’t hear much over the white noise crackling through his head.
want to see Tony. If Tony didn’t want to be seen, he could say no, but this way he would at least know that Steve wanted to look. The urge had been building since their conversation in the workshop. The arc reactor and whatever scars surrounded it weren’t something Steve would shy away from, and the sooner Tony learned that, the better.
When Steve got too obvious about studying him, Tony started to pat his face. “What, do I have crumbs in my beard?”
Bruce glanced between them. Whatever conclusions he drew from Steve’s silence, he kept to himself. “Sure.”
Steve had shaded in most of the helmet's shadows and was working on fine detail by the time the torch clicked off.
“I’d put you on the payroll,” Tony said idly, picking up one of the drawings Steve had done of him, showcasing his muscular back and shoulders as he moved holographic diagrams through the air, “but SI has very strict policies on sexual harassment. The head of HR hates me enough as it is for my, and I quote, ‘capricious hiring decisions which make it impossible to maintain an orderly onboarding process,’ and if I crossed her on this she would find a way to kill me with her stapler. It’s a shame, really. I’d love to fuck you over my desk.”
His head snapped around at a sound from the foyer. The elevator door hadn’t opened, but something was moving nearby. Steve crossed the room on silent feet.
“Need a hand?” Steve helped him wheel the rack into the center of the room. It was heavy, loaded with hundreds of items of clothing--shirts, pants, pajamas, a few silk bathrobes (as though one silk bathrobe wouldn’t be extravagant enough), and a few things Steve didn’t even recognize. The bottom shelf on the rack held at least a dozen shoeboxes. It was more clothing than he could ever see himself needing, but honestly, after his conversation with Tony the night before, Steve was surprised he was only getting one rack instead of twelve.
“Point.” Tony picked at his sleeve, not quite looking at Steve. “You still freaked out when you read about it, though.”
“Well, not anymore, Captain Spoilsport. You could have said ‘you can peel my banana anytime,’” Tony said, doing a ridiculous breathy voice. Steve tensed his stomach muscles to keep from laughing. “But the moment’s gone, now.”
Steve put his old pants and shirt back on, figuring that would be more appropriate than answering the door in a blanket toga. He ate some leftover noodles at the kitchen bar, contrasting the perfect quiet of the penthouse with the noisy, disorderly SHIELD mess where he’d last eaten lunch. Steve had usually eaten alone at the emptiest table he could find, after a few disastrous attempts to sit with other agents had led to stilted, carefully polite conversation. It didn’t matter that Steve wasn’t in the agents’ actual chain of command; he still got treated like an officer.
The shorts and undershirt he was already wearing were made of something soft and silky smooth. Their labels listed unfamiliar fabrics--more things to research. Steve consciously dropped that question from his mind. Right now, all that mattered was that they were comfortable and nice to touch.
“Don’t know,” Steve said honestly. He didn’t really want to think about it. It was already hitting him, his thoughts sliding away to make room for the sensory onslaught he knew Tony was about to put him through. It was too new for Steve to trust in the magic to last; what if examining it too closely meant it stopped working? “Maybe all of it.”
Steve swallowed back the urge to kiss him for the stupid joke. It would have come out too soft if he’d tried, given away too much. He crossed his arms instead, holding still while Tony attacked his button and fly. “This isn’t peeling, this is shucking. I feel like an ear of corn.”
He turned his attention to the penthouse, getting his first good look in daylight. At first glance it looked more like a hotel lobby than a living room. All the furniture was sleek and modern, spotlessly clean (apart from the sofa, which Steve was avoiding looking at closely, heat climbing his neck every time he thought about it), no stains on the cushions from dropped food, no claw marks from pets on the legs. Steve checked four tables before he found a dried brown circle marking where a coffee cup had overflowed. Finding it made him feel a little better.
“Excuse you, I’m never overdressed or underdressed, I’m the one who sets the dress code for every party I attend,” Tony retorted, but he was already unzipping his jeans. He kicked his pants and underwear off without a trace of self-consciousness, but ignored his shirt in favor of reaching for Steve’s neck and shoulder. Steve dipped his head down for a few warm, languid kisses, but when Tony’s hands skated down his sides he stepped back an inch, just enough to make Tony pause and look at him.
“I didn't mean she was weak. I just meant--people should get to be civilians. They deserve it. That’s what soldiers are for, to make a world where other people get the chance to be civilians. Just listen for a minute,” Steve said, too fast, because Tony was opening his mouth, and Steve wouldn’t be able to say this twice, he wouldn’t be able to start again if he was interrupted. “Please.”
“That can be arranged. In the meantime,” Tony said, eyes refocusing on Steve, “I never did get to peel you out of your new clothes.”
“No.” Steve hadn’t been, researching Tony and sketching in his lab had taken up enough time, but he could see how boredom would come on fast if he didn’t have something else to work on. “But I like to keep busy.”
“Thanks.” Steve set the sketchpad aside so he could stretch out his arms. The serum kept him from actually getting sore when he held a position for too long, but he still got stiff. When he’d been young, he’d come out of drawing spells with his back locked up and his shoulders aching--he swung his shoulders now and marveled at the easy looseness. He couldn’t remember appreciating the difference before. Was this really the first time since he’d gotten the serum that he’d sat and drawn for hours?
Steve gritted his teeth and settled in for a wait. Every time his body started to calm down, he’d hear a new noise from the bathroom and start imagining all over again what Tony might be doing in there. At one point Tony let out a low, satisfied groan and Steve pushed against the headboard so hard he heard something creak.
The cafeteria was set up like a massive cafe, with a few different long counters and a lot of tables, large and small, scattered around an open space with a bank of windows serving as one wall. There were potted plants and comfortable armchairs breaking up the expanse of tables. Tony steered Steve to a two-person table near the windows.
“Worth every second, princess, because now,” Tony said, climbing onto the bed to straddle Steve’s hips, “I get to do this.”
Tony’s face closed off all at once. The cool, confident smile he gave Steve could have been lifted from any of his press conference appearances. “Not very pleasant reading, Cap, although I’m delighted you’re Googling me. I have some excellent sex tapes I could recommend if you want to continue your research, they’re much more fun.”
Tony had a glint in his eye that made Steve wonder if he had a desk in the workshop, but before he could respond, the workshop doors slid open and Bruce walked in, coming to a sudden stop when he saw Steve there.
Tony hit the controls for the flippers a few times, waving them idly back and forth. “Were you bored today?”
Tony had made Steve a scotch on the rocks, but he'd also said alcohol was a risky coping mechanism for people without superhuman tolerance, and Steve didn’t think scotch was going to do Tony any favors right now. Steve opened cupboards until he found a saucepan.
It was the robot that had taken Tony’s coat the night before. When it saw Steve--did it have eyes? It must have a camera somewhere, although Steve wasn’t sure where--it reared back like Steve had startled it. Steve rounded his shoulders and put his hands in his pockets, like he was dealing with a frightened civilian.
"It's an espresso machine, Steve, not a robot, I haven't even modified it. Much." Tony shifted the mug to one hand and stretched the other out over the back of the sofa. Steve took the hint and sat beside him, slumping down to rest his head on Tony’s shoulder when Tony’s arm pulled him in. The glass panel in front of them lit up with the title card for Sherlock Jr.
Steve looked up and blinked. Tony was standing in front of him, flipping through the finished sketches Steve had set to the side on the workshop couch. At some point he’d run out of graph paper and one of the robots had brought him an actual sketchpad. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been drawing, but his shoulders were cramped from hunching over the pad on his knees, and he’d filled a dozen pages.
“I am no sort of expert but I could point you in the direction of one. There was this doctor. He was researching the subject but he gave it up because of lack of enough data points. He moved his specialization to something that it is a little off the beaten path.”
Time can be a fractious thing. In the span of a moment the sky falls and the world explodes. On one side of the moment all was well. On the other side, was hell.
“Nothing like almost dying to get a religious experience. I hope you got it out of your system,” Tony laughed.
Tony Stark went over every word he had overheard in the cellar of doom. He had been cursed with a perfect memory. So each word he remembered came with a perfect recollection of the blow that accompanied it. After a few hours he looked up from his list. He knew some names. The group used a mix of codenames and petnames. The girl was Gnat. Which was a strange until he had heard someone referred to as Wasp. Their bearing was faux military… like they had made up their own rules. Like they thought they were some kind of pirates. They had kept their masks on most of the time but once when he had been unconscious, and the room too hot, the men had taken off their masks. They hadn’t notice him wake up. So he knew one of the men had dirty blonde hair and the other was a long-haired brunette. Blondie was the one who let names slip. So his list read Blondie, Gnat, Bux, Wasp (unseen), and his soulmate, the one they called Cap. Which was curious because he hadn’t worn one.
Pep’s painstaking file combing had thrown up some interesting facts. Every so often a truck would take a little detour, off the record and off the files and make a little pit stop at a remote gas station before entering the country. The clue had been in the disproportionate mileage that the trucks seemed to register. Sometimes too high, sometimes too low. Now that Tony knew they were switching the entire trucks out, he was surprised they were even taking care of little details like the odometer readings. Their mole was smart. And meticulous. Tony did not like that combination.
Tony had ice cream on his nose and a sparkle in his eyes and blew a raspberry with his pink wet lips.
Shield and police had been tipped off. Hopefully there were a few good guys in there to make sure that the plot would come to light. And please please please let there be nothing to tie him to the whole debacle. Steve would have been there, on the spot. Would he come to tell him how the whole thing had gone? Tony slipped off the cuff and rubbed his mark. It had become a habit now. Now that he knew Steve had lost his soulmark… He wondered what the trauma had been that had finally rubbed the mark off. He had kept the mark through all the torture he had experienced in his childhood. So had Tony’s rejection been the final blow? And why did that thought hurt so much?
Steve walked up to the window and saw his face reflected in the glass. Dried blood splattered over his cheek and forehead. Tony’s blood. He wanted to scratch his face off. But he calmly wet a rag with water from a bottle and wiped the violence off and waited to Tony to talk.
Tony tried to put on a smile, but his mind was still reeling with Steve’s goodbye and his own rather stupefied behaviour.
Steve had been watching Tony work with some chemicals in his lab. It was one of his favourite things to do. Watching Tony be clever. And curious. The way this eyes widened when he had an idea and narrowed when he worked it all out, the way they lost focus when he was calculating in his head and the way they sharpened when he was putting all the component parts together. Steve could watch Tony endlessly. The man’s mind must be a magical place—as brilliant as his eyes.
Thank you, thank you for getting through this mush. I very tentatively ask you to let me know what you think. Kind words and kudos will be much appreciated. Constructive criticism will be truly welcome. Other things, I shall be borne with a stoicism that would make Steve proud.
Steve had the toughest role. He was in charge of guiding the missile through the window. A small target which would have been just right for Clint’s skills except for the fact that it would require him to be suspended from the Zepplin with a launcher that was too heavy for Clint to work.
“So when that woman was surprised that you could talk it was because you literally said nothing for three days,” Pepper sounded equal parts impressed and aghast. There should be a word for that.
This fic is follow-up to the previous story "Words Unsaid." Though you don't HAVE to read the first one to follow this one, just like you don't have to watch Avengers2 to enjoy CACW... but it helps. Here is a clue--Steampunk universe and soul marks.
“Wha…” It was rare for Tony to be struck speechless but the floor littered with crumpled paper had done just that. Steve let out another frustrated groan as he crumpled another sheet of paper and added to the mess. Steve, the stoic soldier, the man who recovered smiling from bullet holes in the chest, was about to cry at the mess of his desk.
“Dislocated shoulder. Concussion. One broken rib. Cracked cheekbone. Two lacerations. Nobody could accurately count all the blunt force trauma and what have you been doing—eating your tongue?” Rhodes began pacing.
That thought jolted him. He had to get to Tony before the man did something stupid like put himself into danger, or die. He stumbled on.
Jarvis cleared his throat, “If I may be so bold as to inquire… your interview with Dr Strange. It was satisfactory? Did you find what you were looking for?”
Tony’s head was aching and he knew he was not thinking straight. His vision was blurry and the world was swimming around him. He felt like throwing up. And Obie would not stop monologuing.
And Steve didn’t know how to answer that question. The moment became heavier. He looked away from Tony’s burning bright brown eyes that stayed on him like they were analyzing his soul. Perhaps he was. There was nothing of Steve that was hidden from Tony. He had all the keys and every map to the inner landscape of his mind. Tony could unmake him. Lay him out in bits and pieces and see how they fit, how they worked, if they worked at all, what was broken, what needed fixing, what needed replacing.
The plan was simplicity itself. The Schloss was well-guarded from the ground, but Tony’s zepplin was a secret no one knew about. SS Iron Man was a brilliant piece of engineering and steam-powered tech. If Steve hadn’t already been thoroughly besotted with Tony, he would have fallen in love with the man behind the Iron Man, all over again.
But now he had a decision to make. He had found his soulmate and the man had broken his body in at least three places. It did not bother Tony that his soulmate was obviously a criminal, that would have been hypocritical. But the man was cruel. To get his men to beat a man who was outnumbered, tied down, defenseless… that was inexcusable. He had tried to take Tony’s dignity. And that Tony Stark could not forgive. Tony would never admit to being heartbroken. Or that heartbreak was worse than all the pain assailing him at the moment. But it was easy to admit that he was furious. He refused to lie down and take it. Metaphorically, at least. So, he straightened his back and pushed down on the pain. All of the pain.
Steve had slept. His nose in Tony’s neck, and the taste of warm honey lingering on his lips, as sweet as Tony’s smiles.
And the day had begun so well. His shipments had sneaked through into the city with only the last truck lost. That was practically a perfect run. Of course he’d have to come up with a new route now that the government goons had figured this one out. But Tony Stark was smart that way. He could think on his feet. Pity he couldn’t think himself out of a bag.
“They may not be completely wrong.” Pepper sighed pushing her hair back and sitting down next to Tony. Last night some men dressed in Hydra militia gear drove into the precinct in a truck identical to the one we used and pulled a switcheroo. Happy is trailing the truck and will report when it gets where its going.”
“Nope love and support. That’s all you are getting buddy. With a healthy dose of calling-out-on-bullshit thrown in free of charge. Take it or leave it. Final offer,” Rhodes smiled.
“He doesn’t, really. He knows he is rather pathetic,” Steve smiled and then he sighed, “Tony, I am sorry for everything. You really deserve someone better. I am not a good man…”
There was one case of words that disappeared after severe trauma that Tony found fascinating. But that kid never found his soulmate, so that was another joke without a punchline.
“On the plus side,” Steve said, rolling a small pebble between his fingers, “we have enough targets to keep us busy for a lifetime. On the minus side, looks like it’s not gonna be a long enough lifetime.”
Steve nodded. The moment felt light and heavy, at the same time. Steve wondered if Tony would try to make up a name for it.
Potts took pity on him. She smiled, “It was the least we could after she saved one of us. Think nothing of it.”
“This can’t be happening,” Tony cried, “Not like this. This is not what I wanted. No, no.” Steve’s head was somehow in his lap and Tony was crying like an actress in some cheap melodrama, rubbing his hands over Steve’s face. His fingers brushed against something hard in his ear and he pulled out Steve’s comm link. That was when the distant pop pop sounds registered in his head.
Pepper walked into the room without a knock and Tony straightened up from his desk trying to look like he hadn’t fallen asleep there.
“That would have worked better if you hadn’t just faced down the female ninja out there,” Pepper said.
Tony had come up with sectors for his drivers. So each vehicle changed hands as soon as a driver left his sector. Once they knew where the problem was it was not difficult to find the rogue driver. There were two of them—Sitwell and Rumlow. But they had to be working for someone else, someone who chose which truck to switch.
Phil smiled back and put a hand against the back of Clint's neck, stroking the sensitive skin. "I wouldn't really want you to." A thought had been swirling in his mind, and even though he was loathe to broach the subject, it was as good a time as any. "If you... look, I don't care what's happened, I fully intend, once we're both ready, to make sure that we have the absolute most fantastic sex that two people have ever had. That said, it's going to be awhile." It was hard to be sure, but the words felt true. He'd never been through anything like what Creed had done to him, and the reality of it was too jarring to ignore. "If you need someone... this is a very different situation. That whole monogamy rule... this is..." He wasn't sure how to put it into words, but if Clint felt ready a long time before he did, having Clint be with someone else sounded a lot better than losing the man altogether. "Just make sure it's someone you trust. That we trust. Go to Natasha, not one of those bars, okay?"
Tony started to answer the could just head up to one of the R&D floors and get them to use the latest bio-foam or skin glue or whatever the biologists had pulled out of their asses, then realized that something like that would have to be explained to people. //And I hate having to explain myself.// "Jarvis?"
"Don't be sorry. Do finish your coffee. C'mon, let's go sit in the living room." Coulson grabbed his cup and flashed Clint a smile. It was good knowing that they could make things work, at least potentially. Potential was all he could ask from the situation. It was cute to see how easily Clint was flustered by the gentler side of things. Earlier in the club he'd been all predatory grace. With something more serious, more intimate, he blushed and stammered like a teenager. It was actually pretty sexy. "You don't have to worry about any of this being new. It's not new to me, but it's... it's a long time ago and pretty far away."
Relieved that the man was getting a little rest, Coulson checked in with the nurse before heading out into the hallway. He paused just outside the door and smoothed a hand over his suit. “You can come out now,” he said in the direction of the ceiling. He should have been annoyed by Clint constantly following him. It had been going on since he woke in medical after the attack on New York to find the agent dozing in a chair nearby. Despite the fact that SHIELD had wanted him quarantined until he was cleared for duty, Clint had snuck away, crawled through the ducts, and ended up in the medical wing with Coulson. Since then it had been a continuous thing to find Clint lurking in the ceiling or otherwise shadowing him. He should have been frustrated, but instead Coulson found it oddly comforting and more than slightly flattering that Clint cared so much. “Want to grab a coffee?”
"I'll be with you," Tony promised quietly. Putting his fork down, he reached out to take Steve's hand, giving him a reassuring stare. He realized he was scared, and realized a moment after that that he was scared for Steve. It didn't matter how accepting the team was, they'd no doubt be shocked. Fortunately, Tony was the only one who was catastrophically terrible - with some vague competition from Clint, admittedly - at handling delicate situations, and he'd already managed to not be a complete ass about it. He wasn't going to tolerate anyone having anything less than kind to say to Steve.
Even though she knew his lack of scientific acumen had little to do with the decision, Simmons smiled as if it made perfect sense. "Of course. We shouldn't be long. I'm sure Director Fury just wants to be sure it isn't all pizza parties and endless pots of coffee."
It didn't take any further urging. Steve followed the gurney as Tony was moved into the back of the ambulance. "Looks like you might not get rid of me that easy."
Steve tried to look stern, but Bucky knew him too well, and he finally sighed and sank onto the couch. “I don’t like that he won’t talk to me. It was hard at first getting to know him, but then… I felt like we were friends.” He’d honestly hoped they were on their way to being a great deal more than friends. “I feel like things would be fine if he’d just let me in, but he spends all his time in the lab, and then he won’t see me and-” Steve cut himself off. Bucky had more than enough problems of his own to deal with. “Don’t get me wrong,” he said, tone gentle. “I want to be here for you. I just wanted to be there for both of you. He’s not letting me be, and it’s driving me a little crazy.”
"Not a word," she hissed. Simmons raised a finger in warning when Fitz' mouth opened again. "You should get sleep. I'll take the first shift waiting for Captain Rogers. I'll run the simulation a few more times. Sleep. Before you say something I'll be forced to make you regret, Fitz."
He'd intended not to make a sound. He'd intended to keep entirely silent. The pain had other ideas, and Phil gasped at the sudden shock of absolute, tearing agony. His hands clenched behind his back, trapped against Creed's body, and he had to fight against every instinct that told him to grab onto Creed and tear at any skin he could reach until he ripped the man completely open. Given how quickly Creed healed, that wouldn't do much. Gritting his teeth, he managed under his breath, "Doesn't matter what you do to either one of us. I'm not yours."
The timing was apparently okay because Natasha felt good enough to surge forward and grab Steve's arms, guiding him over to the bunk when his knees buckled. "Breathe," she instructed calmly, her eyes never leaving his. "Breathe."
"Loki is, unfortunately, more or less a god,” Coulson agreed. “We're looking to contain, not kill, satisfying as it would be to return the favor."
Steve threw his head back against Logan's shoulder with a sigh as he let one hand trail down from the back of Tony's neck, over his chest - just grazing the arc reactor - and finally down over the hard planes of his stomach. Tony might not have any super strength helping him out in the fitness department, but nobody could ever call him a slouch. "Maybe I kinda like the idea of you begging," Steve answered in a husky whisper before he gave in and slid his hand into Tony's boxer briefs anyway. He palmed the man's cock and felt it jump against his warm hand. "Maybe the begging can come later."
“I appreciate the sentiment,” Steve allowed carefully, “but I need to handle it myself. I don’t think Tony’s up to seeing you yet.” Most of the team seemed to agree. He remembered the icy stare Natasha gave him when he told her he was going to share a suite with Bucky. “I’m not even sure I can get him to see me. I’m starting to think convincing Coulson it’s a security issue and getting SHIELD to break down the door might be easier than getting close enough to have a civil conversation.” Steve took a deep breath. “Sorry. None of that’s your problem. I guess what I really need to do is stop talking about doing something and go down to the lab and sit outside the door until either I get in or he comes out.”
Scott hummed his pleasure before finally admitting, "Not sure you rubbing me all over is the way to get clean. Definitely not mentally." He couldn't help but kiss Logan the first chance he got. The man was delicious. He grabbed the soap and did his best to return the favor without moving any farther away from Logan. "Not that I mind. I kind of enjoy the dirty parts."
Thor had pulled Coulson into a rib-crunching hug before the man got a chance to see it coming. "Son of Coul! How have you been, my friend?" he exclaimed happily.
"Except all the books can kill you," Bobby piped up, lifting a strange-looking thing he suspected was some kind of gun. "Probably. I'm not even sure what half this stuff is."
“Tony?” Bucky asked, glancing down at his hand in Steve’s. “Oh, right... they mentioned something about a Tony, but I really didn’t understand.” He gave another slight shake of his head, only to wish he hadn’t a moment later. The drugs had left his head swimming despite his good moon, and a soft groan pressed his lips apart as he fought against an impending migraine. “We were found together... or rescued... or something.” Bucky peered at Steve as if he had the answers to everything. “None of it makes any sense to me.”
Steve reluctantly kept the armor on after they boarded. He wanted to tear it all free, but he held back. Being vulnerable with both Creed and Loki on board was a bad idea. He'd thought about trying to gather the rest of the Brotherhood, but Loki was the ringleader. He and Magneto were both in their custody, and Creed was the only one who'd broken the temporary truce by attacking them. "When we get to headquarters, you'll have a lot of questions to answer," he said firmly to Loki. "We're going to expect straight answers."
Eventually, Bruce reached over and nudged Tony. "I think it's time for food." He smirked at the negating grunt he got from Tony. "Either you text Steve and tell him we need food, or I'm going to be forced to put my hand in your butt pocket to get your phone and do it for you."
Fury turned his monitor to face them and played a video showing Scott and Logan in one of the secure rooms on the lower levels. "That paperwork from Xavier? That says that without the visor, this shouldn't be possible."
Clint's hard cock pressing into her and the supple leather under her legs drove Nat absolutely crazy. Her sex throbbed with the aftershocks of her orgasm, and she knew it wouldn't take much to get her there all over again. "Slow. Very slow," Nat demanded. Her tone was softer than before but no less demanding. Nat knew precisely what she wanted, and she knew Clint could give it to her. His love of their slower sessions wasn't lost on her. He'd followed all of her orders perfectly. For once he deserved to get exactly what he wanted too.
Phil said nothing, though he suspected he'd tensed enough at the question to give himself away. They hadn't been given time to enjoy that particular luxury yet, and Phil was definitely regretting that they'd decided to take things slowly. He regretted even more that anything that happened between them in the future would be tainted thanks to Creed. He regretted that he'd have to wait to see what it felt like to flay the mutant alive. Since it definitely bore repeating, Phil tried for a calm tone as he said, "It's going to be fine, Barton. We're going to get through this."
Having overheard the question, Phil glanced in their direction. While he wasn't looking to advertise the details, it wasn't fair to the team to not know that they were in bad shape. He shrugged faintly, leaving it up to Clint how much he wanted to reveal.
"Oh, I know you wouldn't hate it," Nat agreed. "It's just a matter of whether you'd be willing to do it."
Tony returned with fresh coffee and dessert on a tray. "Ready to have your mind blown?" he teased Steve, easing down close to him on the sofa. "I can promise you've never seen anything like Star Wars." The movie always brought out the kid in Tony, and he could not wait to see Steve's reaction to what he considered to be one of the best films of all time.
Steve couldn't help but smile at the visual. He even managed to bite back any scolding about Tony being careless with his fresh stitches. Instead he stripped down to his boxers and happily curled up next to the man. //Maybe things aren't going to be as complicated as I thought.//
Scott managed to find a smile for that, surprised to find that he believed every word. "Okay. Thank you," he repeated before closing his eyes. Scott was out like a light a second later. It had been too long since he had the opportunity to give in to sleep with total abandon. Given the chance, he did so without hesitation. Scott slept without any sense of time passing. No dreams good or bad interrupted the darkness.
Bucky appreciated the sentiment, although in his heart of hearts he wished it was Steve and Steve alone taking care of him. It felt like crossing a line to insist the other man cancel his date and stay with him instead. It was definitely tempting, but Bucky resisted the urge. That wasn't like him, and he did not want to turn into that dark part of himself insisting he do terrible things. "I'm grateful for everything you've already done," Bucky said, brimming with genuine sincerity. "I think most people would've written me off as a lost cause."
The equation didn't go unnoticed, and Clint twisted his head slowly to look at Nat, eyebrow raised. "Haven't seen him in a couple of days..." A beat. "Wait, 'other one'? Are you..." His eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Nat, are you doing that girl thing again? The one where you read everything into little dumb things and make connections that don't exist?" He paused and sat up straighter. "Oh, god. You think I'm dating Phil Coulson."
Logan shifted uneasily at the mention of Jean, his eyes sliding to Scott. He knew it was irrational, but he couldn't help but wonder if such sentiments might convince Scott to return to the mansion. The prospect of Jean actually showing up and making Scott reconsider - directly or not - definitely had the feral mutant worried. "It'll be good to have some help," he said. "They... we... know them pretty well."
Steve was up at once, rushing over to Tony's bedside and pressing a gentle hand against his chest again to force him back onto the bed. "Hey... no new rules. It's gonna be the same here as it was at the hospital - which means rest. Lots of it." He smiled, the expression genuine instead of pained this time. Tony looked better despite the discomfort he was obviously in. Without a word, Steve grabbed the water from the man's bedside along with a single pill. "You hungry? The nurse said it's better to take these on a full stomach. I can make you something."
Steve had been exposed to the idea of that through Tony himself, so he hoped the man would appreciate the joke. He made his way down to the corner to get a decent selection of chips and sandwiches from the deli. Steve did his best not to look ridiculous or winded as he carried the haul plus two bottles of soda into the Tower. He was absolutely and categorically not going to be bested by a lunch order. Steve was winded by the time he reached the lab but still smiled happily at the sight of Tony standing by a computer doing his thing. The man never failed to look in charge of everything when he was working in the lab. "Lunch is served."
Clint rolled over the next morning, momentarily confused as to where he was. It wasn't his bed, and it wasn’t Phil's increasingly familiar couch. The faint scent of soap on the pillow next to him reminded him fairly quickly, though. He sighed as the smell of coffee reached his nostrils. It should have been nice, but Clint couldn't shake the feeling that Nat was mostly just avoiding the intimacy of waking up next to him. He sighed, scratching his chest for a moment before finally peeling himself up out of the bed and stumbling into the kitchen. "Morning."
"Of course. I know just the place," Jemma agreed. She was desperately pleased to find that she wasn't the only one who not only ran early but who was also relatively low maintenance. In younger years, she'd seen it as some sort of feminine failing that it took her all of ten minutes to get ready most mornings, though as she'd gotten older, Jemma realized that there was something to be said for not spending half her life in front of a mirror. After a few moments, Jemma found her courage and assured, "You look rather handsome yourself, by the way."  The coffee shop she led them to was close but around a corner and stuffed between two other shops. "I didn't even see it the first time I walked by." Inside it was quietly charming, somewhere between Starbucks and a grandmother's living room. "They make the absolute best hot chocolate I've ever had."
"Well, I guess that depends who you wake up next to," Steve answered with a smirk. "Don't expect Natasha to be quite so pleasant first thing in the morning, but her breath's better." He abandoned the conversation long enough to meet room service at the door and came back pushing a tray brimming with a wide variety of options. Steve had learned from experience that whatever he ordered, Tony would ask for something else, so it paid to cover most of the bases to start with unless he wanted breakfast to last until lunch. "How do you take your coffee, Logan?" he inquired after pouring three mugs and grabbing the sugar for his own.
Not worried about what anyone would think, Phil put a hand on Clint's back, rubbing at the few muscles he could reach with the barrier of the man's vest in the way. The team wanted them sane and functional. For just a little while, that was going to mean being slightly less professional than normal. Leaning in closer, he whispered, "We'll be done before you know it. Then on to donuts and movies."
"I said 'no', playboy," Logan growled, adamantium claws bare millimeters from Stark's face and blue eyes narrowed. "I remember you, now. 'Iron Man'. Ain't so tough without the armor, huh? I don't want anything to do with your freakshow. I've had enough o' you government stiffs and your agendas. Your little Aryan buddy back there might've gotten along just fine when Uncle Sam signed 'im up for guinea pig duty, but I ain't near as impressed."
At first Darien couldn't reply. He couldn't think. Frankly he wasn't sure he was awake. It struck him then that kinky as his dreams were, this went above and beyond. Swallowing hard and using the stinging in his ass to remind him that he needed to react appropriately, Darien managed, "You." He hadn't even known Clint two days before. It was surreal to be tied up in front of strangers professing that the man held some kind of ownership over him, temporary or not. It wasn't bad, though. It wasn't bad at all. The way his cock strained for attention was a testament to that even if Darien had no idea what the hell was going on. "Belong to you," he clarified in case his first dazed response wasn't good enough.
"See? Enough for every--body," Tony pointed out, his voice cracking a bit as he heard a quiet 'snikt' and his undershirt was sliced off his back. From the pain, he also felt certain Logan had nicked him a bit in the process. "Jesus... You can definitely just ask me nicely next time," he groused.
Although Tony remained deeply concerned about the situation, his eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Oh, so you're admitting that I am the genius of the group?" he teased with mock-seriousness. "I must be having a profound effect on you, because you've made a lot of progress since moving in with me." Tony tossed a sly wink in Steve's direction, then his expression softened. "Why don't you try and get some rest? I really don't like seeing that pretty face of yours looking so tired." Tony managed to reach across and squeeze the other man's knee without causing himself pain. "And, if you want to undress right here, you won't hear me complaining."
Clint already felt like throwing up. He kept a fairly cool facade, though, until Coulson brought Nat into it. "Goddammit," he snarled, slamming his hand on Phil's desk. "I didn't fucking *know*! He seemed normal! I mean, I get that it was stupid, but how the hell was I supposed to know he was fucking possessed? I..." Running out of steam almost as quickly as he'd built it, Clint sagged into one of Coulson's chairs and ran a hand over his face, looking shell-shocked. "I didn't want..."
Steve gave the man a dirty look, but he didn't ask Tony to stop. Steve didn't really want him to, and from the smug look on Tony's face, he knew that well enough. His expression softened into a smile as he gave Tony's a squeeze. "A dark corner might not be privacy enough for my taste, but that doesn't mean you can't still get lucky tonight if you play your cards right." He glanced up and caught a flash of movement from a nearby table - a man discreetly trying to tuck his cell phone out of sight. Steve barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "I guess it was too good to be true to think we might not get noticed."
There's smut, but it's fluffy smut. This is mostly pure sweetness because they deserve it. Things are about to get rough.
"The chemical they used shocked your body back into a coma. You were only out for a few hours. JARVIS alerted us as soon as he was back online. It was a small window - five minutes, maybe ten. Unfortunately it was enough for them to get Tony."
It hurt like hell to watch Clint suffer. The whole ordeal had been painful. Phil had spent it sitting with his forehead on his knees and his arms curled around his legs. He didn't want to see. It was bad enough hearing the moans and gasps, some of them pain and some of them even more disturbing to consider. As soon as the cell door closed, he uncurled and reached out to soothe a hand over Clint's back. He drifted away to grab the leftover shredded parts of his shirt and rinse them with the water, passing one into Clint's hand so that he could wash his face off and holding the other for the rest of the cleaning that Clint would likely want to do. "Breathe for me, Clint. Just hold on."
Steve smiled at the touch and chuckled low at the suggestion of buying an island just for vacation purposes. "I think maybe we should be together for a little longer before we buy an island." As much as he hoped and prayed there was a future for the two of them, Steve didn't want to put too much pressure on them. He knew how Tony reacted to pressure, and it was usually bad. "Let's stick with maybe some plane tickets as soon as you're back to being in one piece with no staples and stitches needed."
"I know," the agent answered. He nodded to both men before disappearing down the hallway as quickly as he had come.
Steve had frankly been scared to bring it up himself, but he beamed when Bucky did. The fact that things had gone well with Tony had him all but walking on air. He wanted to share that with his best friend. “He agreed to let me cook him dinner tonight. He’s… what happened still has him upset. He thought I’d blame him.” The idea still made Steve’s gut twist, and he could barely look Bucky in the eye for a moment. “It was bad. It’s probably going to be bad for quite awhile. I want him to meet you, the real you, but I…” Steve looked up with a rueful smile. “I think it’s gonna be a long time before he’s ready for that.”
"Yeah," Clint agreed, pushing the hood back and scowling at the lights in the hallway. "He's a pretty nice package," he said, running a hand through his mussed hair in an ineffective attempt to smooth it. He managed a valiant smirk. "Still needs to work on his ability to stand up to your unexpected appearances at awkward moments, though. Lotta blushing."
Logan didn't immediately oblige, taking his time, savoring the slow building pleasure. He hadn't missed the way Scott responded to the rough words, and he nipped at the man's shoulder before biting into the taught flesh, marking his lover close to the same spot Clint had. Scott was his, and he didn't want the man to forget it. One of Logan's hands slid down to Scott's waist, gripping him tight, his thrusts slowing as he drew back and then slamming forward hard. "Like that? Is that how you like to be fucked?" he growled, nuzzling Scott's cheek and moaning softly.
Feeling bad for the guy, Scott offered, "Not that it's any of my business, but... there are worse things to have get around the water cooler." He shrugged. "You could choose to look at this as excellent personal publicity."
"Oh, don't worry. I don't need you to remember something for me to find it. You'd be amazed how poorly organized memories are." Loki's gaze grew far-away for a moment, but he snapped back to the present quickly enough. "You'd be impressed how little I care about SHIELD. The Avengers, perhaps, but SHIELD? One tiny bureaucracy." He tilted his head and smiled coldly at Natasha. "As you said, I tend not to weep for regime changes. I believe your world is due for one. Now, Mister... is it Wolverine? Honestly?"
Steve took his seat when Tony finally did. It was going to be interesting trying to get Tony to play by any sort of rules that weren't his own. He still knew that his lover was the best choice they had to guide the Avengers. As Fury had said, they weren't a SHIELD team - not exactly. "We've got things to do and wounds of our own to tend to," Steve continued in a quieter, calmer tone. "There are a lot of question marks floating around, and we aren't going to get all the answers any of us want as soon as we want them. It's more important now than ever that we remember we're all on the same side here. Is there anything else we need to discuss for now, Director?" The truth was that Steve was still fighting the urge to retreat entirely from the room, not that he let that show in his posture or tone. The team needed whatever stability they could find.
In moments, they were back in New York, and Logan was starting to feel certain that he'd be throwing up if he were of any lesser constitution. How Bruce and Natasha managed to deal with it was enough to impress him. "So, Fury's gonna want an update."
Coulson wasn't surprised to find Clint waiting for him the garage and couldn't help smiling at the sight. People could call Lola a mid life crisis all they wanted. The car and Clint together made for a beautiful visual. "Climb in." Coulson had opted for dark jeans and a button down to avoid a repeat of the experience of being called in on an emergency basis while wearing a t-shirt. They began the drive in companionable silence, the radio playing some low key, middle of the road mix of oldies and modern top 40.
Tony grabbed onto Steve's hand when he walked by. He didn't try to hold Steve back, just held on lightly, keeping contact as long as he could while Steve walked past him. He swallowed hard as the blonde's fingers finally slid completely away. "Love you," he murmured softly, looking frightened and small in his wheelchair.
Wincing at the obviously unspoken part of the statement, Simmons forced another smile. "It's nothing to worry about. Routine excursion." She had absolutely no idea what a routine excursion really looked like, but she prayed it was like what they had planned. "Really."
"Which is impossible. In the visible spectrum," Tony added to make sure Steve understood. "But it's a hell of a lot better than anything else we've tried. I figure Bruce can batter him into submission and then Logan can shuffle him off his immortal coil."
"You're a bad liar," Steve answered, stretching up to kiss Tony again as they found a rhythm that left him barely catching his breath before Tony's thrusts stole it away again. "You want me as badly as I want you." It still boggled his mind to think that Tony had chosen him, that after all the men and women he'd been with, Steve was the one who had ultimately caught his eye. "And never get hurt again. Don't think I can take all that pretending to behave myself around you." Steve rocked his hips upward to meet Tony's next thrust and let out a deep groan. Even though they were still keeping it slow, Steve could feel his release building closer with every rolling movement of Tony's body against his own.
Pressed into his seat between Thor and Scott, Logan was watching the archer less intensely but just as warily. Clint looked at that weapon like it was made of solid gold, and it was hard to miss the odd flicker in the archer's eyes whenever his hand brushed against the handle. //Sure as hell hope everyone knows what we're doin' with this thing.// He glanced back to Scott. "You alright?"
Intrigued by the new turn things were taking, the Soldier smirked and began to stroke in earnest. "Is that all? Just a quick fuck and done? Seems like a shame..." He could feel the man's pulse pounding through his cock, hear his breath speeding up. "There's nothing else you want?"
The rest wasn't an easy one, and Tony's mind was filled with images of Loki, moving over him, doing all the right things to drive him out of his mind. The dream reached a crescendo, and Tony woke with a jerk, hard and gasping the god's name.
This one is long. Really long. Sorry about that. There's a touch of smut with Clint & Darien toward the start, but this is mostly plot. Not sorry about that part.
"I was really just trying not to think about it," Tony answered, trying to keep his breathing even. He wondered how long it would take for Loki to get tired of him. If the god even would. Loki struck him as the sort to keep trophies. Especially the living kind. "You think no one's going to come for your other two prisoners? Because I don't know if you've noticed yet or not, but the Avengers have a way of taking it personally when you kill one of their own. Even temporarily." He knew he might well be digging himself in a world of hurt by continuing to taunt the Asgardian, but it kept him from losing his mind to the realization that not only was he not going to get rescued but Loki had free license to use him however he saw fit.
Bucky grimaced at the sight. He averted his eyes a moment later, shamed by his own actions. "I'm sorry," came his murmured apology. Bucky found himself growing increasingly frustrated with the entire situation. He couldn't trust himself to be around anyone. A word or an innocent action might trigger him to become a mindless killer. Bucky would never be able to live with himself knowing he'd harmed someone. Of course he'd already committed countless atrocities being under Hydra's control, but now that his identity was back, things were different. "Maybe... I should leave?" he said softly. "I'm too dangerous to be around."
"Relax. This is a gift from your suitor. Logan says hello." Before Scott could recover enough to protest, slender fingers plucked the glasses from his pocket. "You won't need these anymore."
//Probably more fun than a certain tall, green wrecking ball I know...// "They know. SHIELD's used to having strings attached when it comes to its pet experiments," Clint said. Fury hadn't seen fit to give him all the details, but he knew enough to know that Darien would need some kind of upkeep - shots, apparently - to remain useful. "The main reason SHIELD wants you is probably because they don't like the idea of someone else having you. That, and being able to disappear has its tactical advantages. The director doesn't always like to tell me everything he's thinking, so they may have something more specific in mind, too. You might want to work on that whole looking ready to piss yourself when someone gets killed thing, though." Realizing that Darien could probably use a little reassurance, Clint paused. "Agent Barton, by the way," he said, wiping most of the blood from his right hand onto his trousers before offering it for a shake. "Also known as Hawkeye."
Logan closed his eyes, sighed heavily, and let his head fall back as Scott's lips moved over his skin. "Kinda really like the way you use your mouth," he breathed, lifting his head and smirking at his lover, "and the way you hold my hand." It was the most romantic thing he could think of to say. The feeling of Scott's fingers tangled with his while they'd eaten dinner had been strangely soothing.
Steve smiled at Tony's rambling, warming at the sound and finally chiming in, "I'm thinking Italian. Comfort food, but classy... and you may have a point about the dancing. All I can say is that you're a terrible influence." Before Tony could get offended, he used his grip on Tony's hand to pull the man in a little closer and kiss his neck softly. "Luckily for you, I enjoy that." Steve glanced up at the clock and calculated briefly. "Okay, I'm going to go shower, get something decent on, and try to answer the three hundred emails I probably have from Director Fury by now. Meet back here at lunch?"
"He might," Bruce allowed with a nod. "He might not, though, and I don't want to lie to you, Cap. This is bad either way. Part of me wants him to remember everything so we can find Hydra and cut all the heads off that thing once and for all. Part of me hopes he doesn't remember anything. We got a taste of what they've been using him for with Tony, but we don't know how bad it's been."
Again Steve had to bit his tongue to keep from demanding to come along, but again Natasha was right. He had promised Tony he would stay close, and that alone kept him from protesting. Instead he let out a shaky breath and nodded once. "Okay. We wait."
Logan shifted uneasily, his gaze wavering for a split second. "Why the hell would I know anything about some artifact, anyway? That was your deal back in the day," he countered, though he was getting a sinking feeling that Nat had been right. What did I know? What'd I give 'im access to? "All I remember was gettin' shot at in Normandy. I can't help ya."
"You look like hell," Darien observed as he looked Clint over. Considering the mission logs he's been cataloging the day before, Darien couldn't say he was surprised. A bender was the least Clint deserved. He tried not to think too much about what company Clint had been in while he went on it. "Coffee coming up." As he moved around getting a pot started, Darien ventured, "Any word yet?"
"Clint's a man of many skills. Reading isn't one of them." Nat tossed a smirk Clint's way before her gaze returned to Logan. "I almost hope we have a reason to see those claws of yours. What I've read... impressive." It might have sounded flirtatious but the glint in her eyes was anything but sexual. Natasha had a deep appreciation for anyone who could kill people as efficiently as Logan. "Just make sure you watch out for the rest of the team. Steve only looks cuddly until you piss him off."
"Just wanted to give you something." The hammer collided with Victor's head with the sound of two trains colliding, and the mutant hit the ground and slid across the floor in front of the team like a rag doll. Clint easily dropped back to the floor as if nothing had happened, looking utterly calm as he resumed his place next to Phil.
"Some good vodka sounds like the perfect way to end a lovely day," Natasha smiled as she finally stepped away from Clint. Her work wasn't done, but things were moving in the right direction, at least.
Already revved up from having gotten Steve off, Tony didn't have much stamina left in him, and watching the perfect man before him suck his dick was too much for his self-restraint. He came with a few tense moans, one of which sounded like his partner's name. With a pleasantly shaky lack of grace, he tugged Steve back a bit and then slumped to the floor with a big, sloppy grin plastered across his face. His hair was mussed, and he was flushed from the encounter, and all he wanted to do was drag Steve into a long, breathless kiss, an impulse which he immediately obliged. He hands tangled in the other man's hair, Tony couldn't imagine anything better than the taste of sweat and himself on Steve’s lips.
Steve had lost his resolve with Tony's building passion, and it only took him a few more seconds to follow Tony over the edge, his cock grinding into the sheets beneath him. They'd need to be changed in short order, but it was worth it. He sagged, boneless in the aftermath, and sighed, "You're amazing. Not that your ego needs the help, but... you're totally amazing." Steve wriggled enough to turn over underneath Tony so that he could kiss his lover's slack lips.
Hank quickly recovered, grateful for May's help, and not just a little impressed at her level-headedness, considering their circumstances. "I-" The racket of Steve's shield clattering through the shelves distracted him, and his eyes widened at the blur of motion that followed.
“If you say so,” Bucky decided, hearing the emotion in Steve’s voice. “We’ve come a long way since Brooklyn, haven’t we?” His gaze wandered over his friend’s form; Steve looked exactly the same, except for his eyes. They spoke of untold things Steve Rogers had seen and done. It made his heart ache not only for Steve, but for the time they had both lost. “So,” he started, searching for a topic to break the awkward silence, “sounds like you’re still suiting up.”
It never occurred to Steve to lie. "We were just finishing up with dinner. Talking about maybe finding a bar to go to after, but I haven't really been to any around here," he confessed. Not picking up on Logan's not-so-subtle signals to shut up and shut up fast, the man ventured, "Don't suppose you have any suggestions?" If anyone was going to know a good, casual bar in the area, it would be Tony. He seemed to be able to find a bar absolutely anywhere.
The pair shared a glance, and Simmons considered keeping silent. Bruce wouldn't be pleased, but she finally nodded. "We actually, er, we've talked about it a bit already." She winced at the look Bruce leveled at them when he overheard the chatter. "We aren't trying to work on a serum itself, Dr. Banner, just something to bring back what Captain Rogers has in his body while it's still there." She bit her lip and confessed, "We haven't found much, but we're looking. The second we find anything more than ideas, you'll both know," she assured Bruce and Tony.
Scott didn't stop for a moment. He wanted to drink every last drop and see the look on Logan's face while he did it. Reaching down, he couldn't resist giving himself a few careful strokes through his boxers. The friction built rather than relieved the tension, and Scott moaned around his lover's cock.
Logan had to grin. He still had his initial impression of Scott cemented in his mind: stoic, reserved, completely controlled. Seeing the man anxious, unabashed, and desperate was sexy in ways Logan couldn't even articulate. He settled for lifting his hips so that Scott could push his jeans down enough for him to kick them to the floor. Freed of the last of his clothing, Logan grabbed the back of Scott's neck with one hand and slid his hand into Scott's underwear, forcibly stilling his frantic movements for a moment as his tongue plundered Scott's mouth and his hand stroked the man's throbbing length.
Scott watched her go, too tired and sated to worry about calling after her. He just smiled and burrowed in closer to Logan. "Mmm, you were right. That was fun," he affirmed, "but now I'm glad it's just us for the cuddly sleeping part. I like that part."
Loki looked up, surprised, and managed, "Thank you," before looking away again. It might mean nothing considering the situation, but an extra voice raised against the idea of his slaughter was still comforting. The plane loomed before them, and Loki hesitated at the ramp, glancing back over the Avengers trailing behind them along with Lady Sif. Her gaze was cold, and he turned away as quickly as he could without looking guiltier than he felt already. It was familiar being strapped into the back of the plane. The situation was far more fraught with tension, however, with the Widow glaring holes through him. Barton and Coulson looked as if they could barely breathe without being in one another's space. //My fault as well,// he thought, unaccustomed to the pang that followed the idea and frustrated at his inability to quell it and, more, his inability to think of any way to rectify it.
Still all-too-aware of the fact that Coulson had probably witnessed some of those firsthand, Clint cleared his throat. He rarely felt weird about sex. His exhibitionist streak notwithstanding, he was pretty comfortable with the whole thing, but for some reason, the idea that a friend knew that much about his sex life was almost more unsettling than the idea that there were more than a few strangers that had seen him fuck someone. "And the obvious training to shoot things?" Clint had to think a moment. "Watch TV. Play video games. Sometimes I'll read a book. And camping and hunting. Those are fun." He snorted faintly. "Mostly things I can do away from other people, I guess," he said with a faint smile. "I'm kinda boring like that."
Logan smiled, tugging Scott closer. "Livin' in the now is the best thing to do," he agreed, pressing his lips to Scott's throat. "Though I'll make sure to pour out a beer for 'im. Or a whole bottle o' scotch," he amended with a fond smirk. The smile faded a moment later as he remembered he wouldn't get the joy of seeing Tony drunk again. He still remembered throwing Stark on the couch in the hotel in Japan and telling him he wasn't getting a good night kiss. He remembered waking up with Tony curled against his back, having gotten lost in the night. "He was an ass. But he was a good guy."
Loki hadn't expected Tony to be able to give in so thoroughly with Steve Rogers lingering in the back of his mind, but it seemed that Tony Stark was a flexible sort of a man in more ways than one. "I have to admit," he finally said, gaze raking over Stark's naked, glistening body, "that you are rather wonderful at that." Leaning in closer, he whispered in Stark's ear, "Perhaps later I can show you a bit more of my skills as well." Loki wondered whether Stark would remain so enthralled in the aftermath, in the quiet moments when he finally had a chance to examine what he'd done.
"We'll be there with you the whole time, and be there after as much as you want us to be." Phil knew that there might be moments where Clint wanted time to himself to process. He hated the thought of their being separated, but it would be about what Clint needed first and foremost. "Right now, I think you should kiss me and stop worrying about it because it's going to be fine. I know it is." They'd survived Loki twice, and they'd gotten home in one piece, more or less. They were going to survive the next round too.
The intimacy of looking up at Logan and having him look straight back was shockingly addictive. At first the press of the finger was uncomfortable, but it took little more than a deep breath to clear that. "That's.. it's different." Scott laughed quietly. He shifted to show Logan that his physical interest had not diminished in the slightest.
"You can do that. Always." Steve smiled at the sight of Tony's sleepy face, the smile on his lips and the way his eyes were starting to blink more and more slowly as sleep threatened. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow's going to be a big day." He tried to make it sound like a day filled with potential instead of the potential disaster he felt it might really be. Steve knew damn well he might lose the person who had somehow become the center of his universe. The thought was enough to make him shift in closer to hold Tony tight as he let his eyes close. "See you in the morning."
Clint nodded. He knew that was the best they'd get unless Fury decided it was sharing time. He bit his bottom lip. "Well, considering how much Fury likes Rogers, I can't imagine him holding out if it's an option. I mean, it's not like Fury couldn't bury it like he did... whatever he did to you, and we all know Rogers could keep his mouth shut. Unless Fury's having to find a way around the council. I'd believe that, at least. They are a pretty epic pain in the ass," Clint observed. It still nagged at the back of his mind that it might be that whatever had been given to Coulson could be taken away. Deciding it was easiest to change the subject, Clint held up his his hand, palm out. When Coulson looked at him funny, Clint urged, "High five. Little bird told me you bagged the Widow."
Clint smirked at Nat before double-checking his parachute straps one more time. Readying his bow to deploy in his hands, the archer casually stepped off the ramp.
Natasha let some of the tension roll from her shoulders. The thought of Clint putting himself in the line of fire again didn't sit well with her, but any of them sitting a round out was even worse. Better to drive forward and do everything they could as a team. "So when do we roll?"
Clint chuckled softly. "You sound like you think I'm gonna slit your throat when I'm done with you," he said, crouching in front of Darien to make eye contact. He grabbed the other man's chin and pressed a rough kiss to his lips, then patted his cheek and stood without confirming or denying the idea. He stepped to one side of the table, running his fingertips up Darien's spine before reaching under his captive to undo Darien's belt. Clint could tell that Darien got off on the sense of danger, and if there had been any doubt, his hard cock would have dispelled the thoughts. Clint tugged Darien's jeans down to his knees, then ran his hand up the back of one exposed thigh to Darien's ass. Winding up, he gave the firm muscle a sharp slap that held nothing back. "Who do you belong to?" The question was quiet, intense, but didn't invite any backtalk.
Clint twitched at that, lifting the hammer a little and taking a step toward Tony. "Okay, whatever this is, it's irritating and mouthy, but it isn't Stark," he growled, looking poisonously toward Loki before turning his gaze back to the man pressed tightly against Steve. "I saw we kill 'em both and let Simmons figure it out."
Victor chuckled softly, relishing the way his toy shivered underneath him in response. He was getting to Coulson. That was what he ultimately wanted. "Maybe you should beg," he growled, one hand moving to the back of Clint's neck, his thumb stroking idly through the man's hair as he stared at Phil. "Maybe if you really make me believe it, I'll use you first."
"Like I said, I don't know you very well. Believe me when I say that's not something I'd come up with on my own when I'm passing notes from your boyfriend."
Loki considered that. He didn't have any plans for Natasha and her friends for at least another day. While he didn't like Creed much, it didn't factor strongly into whether the mutant might be a decent lay. "Perhaps. Let's retire to a more private venue." With a snap of his fingers, Loki moved them to his temporary quarters. Magical decoration made up for the flair the real room lacked. "You were saying?"
"If I wasn't busy having an aneurysm right now, I'm sure that would be comforting." The truth was that having a room full of people imagining him naked was bad. Having Clint Barton leering at him and doing the same was some new level of uncomfortable that Coulson was pretty sure they'd have to invent an entire new word to describe.
"You're staying clear of Magneto, right?" Bruce asked, smirking a little when he drew a glare. He wiped the smile off his face quickly, though, nodding. "At least a few of us could go with you. We're pretty thin on manpower, but I'd definitely say myself and Logan could follow along." He didn't like it, but he was starting to have fewer and fewer compunctions about charging into battle.
It took him a moment to register that Coulson was looking at him. "Phil..." Tony was slouched back in his wheelchair, staring at the wall, looking gray-green and terrified. "Phil, if he doesn't make it..." He trailed off and gulped again, the tremor in his hands seeming to spread to the rest of him as he could barely finish the thought, nevermind the sentence. He wrapped his arms around himself, biting his lower lip as he worked to sort through everything.
Scott's jaw tensed. Even drunk he'd caught the intention behind the words. "I'm not broken," he managed, not sure if he really believed it. He felt broken in a way, or at least cracked. Scott forced a smile that looked more tense than jovial. "I won't go picking any guys up in bars and getting kidnapped. Stupid idea. Nevermind." In retrospect he felt crazy for putting the idea forth to Logan of all people. He'd never talked about his attraction to men with anyone. It hadn't mattered, frankly. He'd been with Jean, and he wasn't looking for anyone else. Gender was entirely beside the point.  Scott took another long pull from the bottle. If he got drunk enough, maybe it would stop mattering that he'd probably just lost whatever small respect he'd apparently managed to earn from Logan at some point.
Steve climbed out of the chair and felt better just for the fact of moving under his own power. He felt drained and weak and more than slightly ridiculous with a body that didn’t feel entirely like his, but at least he was home. At least Tony was the only one there watching him instead of a whole crew of doctors and nurses staring at him like they expected him to make a run for the window and jump. "Yes to both." He hesitated and then closed the distance between them, sliding his arms around Tony's waist. It was hard, the sudden difference, the feeling of being shorter and smaller than the man, but it would have been harder to not hold him just to avoid the reality. "I just need you for a minute first, okay?"
There was a knock at the door. There was a loud clearing of throats. There was a “Tony!” in an exasperated female voice. There was forced medical attention. There were bandages and injections and stinging alcohol swabs to the face. There were lectures. There was rejoicing when the rest of team got back. Then there was nightfall.
Tony tried to say. It came out little more than a mumble. He tried to listen to Obie’s plans of world dominion. It made no sense. Either he was still too out of it, or Obie had gone mad. He was leaning towards the latter option.
Steve snapped his eyes open and began shivering furiously. For a minute he thought it had started snowing again when he felt the cold dusting on his eyelashes and his hair. He had lost the helmet in the crash. He took a few minutes to eat a part of his rations and drink some water. They sky was a dull grey on one side and there was a lot more light. He could discern some natural features at least.
Tony sighed and rubbed his face. “Who’s doing this Pep? It feels like it has been going on for a long time. I had no idea, and you know how I hate not knowing.”
Steve licked his lips clear of the snow and tasted the phantom sweetness of honey and Tony. He smiled and listened for the sounds of the men and the hound and waited until they left. The snow was not his grave, not today. It was just a place to hide and stay safe. There was a radio squawk summoning the men to the rescue efforts at the Hydra schloss.
