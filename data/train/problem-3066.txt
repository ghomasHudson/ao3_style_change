Again, Cas shook his head.  “I don’t know.”  He felt Charlie’s movement and he glanced over to see a very angry beta.
“You’re right,” Cas told him.  “I want to move into the future with you and our pup.”  Cas slid his hand down and gently placed it on the rounded part of Dean’s belly.  “Now, the first thing we need to do is get you both fed.”
“Nice to meet you,” Eileen said to him.  Dean could hear the slight off tone she had when she spoke and he made sure to face her when he spoke as well.
Pete nodded and Cas could see him out of the corner of his eye.  Nothing in his demeanor changed, but Cas could sense that he was going to say more.
Dean’s eyebrows shot up.  “I’m not sure about another house, Cas.  I don’t know anything about real estate and I’m not sure that I want to uproot everything again right now and move.”
“I figured,” Donna replied.  She leaned her forearm on the open window and ducked her head down to look at him closely.   “I know how hard this is for you, Dean.”
Dean reluctantly took the offered bag and opened it.  Inside was a bagel and cream cheese- chive and onion, his favorite.  “Thanks, Charlie, that’s my-“
Dean knew he could do a few things to help Cas but he would need to talk to Jimmy.  The relationship that he had with both alphas complicated what he would normally just do with one alpha.  He thought about it all the way back to the ranch and then needed to figure out how to get Jimmy alone for a few minutes uninterrupted to talk to him without Cas going off.
Cas continued to card his hand through Dean’s hair and he sighed happily.  “Jesse and Caesar are moving.  They are going to go south to be with Jesse’s mom, who is ailing.  She’s been sick for a while and it’s time.  She needs some help, so he and Caesar are going to move down there for her.”
“You’re right, Sam,” Cas sighed.  He hung his head.  His poor omega had been through too much in such a short time.  He had been violently attacked, forcibly knotted by three alphas and hadn’t even begun to process the pain and damage that had done before he was kicked out of his home and forced on the streets with nothing.  That Dean was even standing was a testament to his will.
“I don’t want to be at the bar,” he said.  “I don’t want to be anywhere near him until he can’t compel me anymore.  But if you and Bobby are at the bar with Sam, does that mean I’m here alone?  I’m going to assume that Ellen will be at the bar on a Saturday night.”
The mere suggestion of another omega near him sent him into a blinding rage, howling and screaming at Gabe.  In the end Gabe had hired a beta nurse from the service to make sure that Cas was hydrated and to help clean up.  Cas was not happy about it and growled at the nurse every time she stepped into the room but she seemed to take it in stride.
“About the same,” Cas told him.  Dean smelled calm and content in his nest and he let Cas stay next to him.  Cas couldn’t bring himself to find out if Dean had pupped or not at that moment.  There would be plenty of time to figure out what happened.
Dean nodded and gave him a small smile.  “I know, but it’s hard to make my heart understand that.  They’re my family and I should just go and tell them to fuck off, but I can’t.  I don’t know why.”
“It’s him, I know it.  And we can go.  I can clear your schedule and we can go, right now.”  Her minty scent flared and Cas could see how excited she was.
When they broke apart they were both panting.  Cas looked at Dean with such tenderness and affection Dean felt his heart swell.  He closed his mouth to keep the words in and Cas thumbed his lips.  They stared at each other for a few minutes before Cas broke the eye contact and unlocked the door.
“I didn’t think you’d still be up,” Cas said.  He made his way across the room to the closet as he loosened his tie and pulled it off.  He didn’t look at Dean.
Dean shook his head.  He didn’t even know what to ask.  He was overwhelmed.  His scent must have given him away because MaryAnn stepped towards him and looked him in the eye.
He made a face and crouched down to see what cleaning supplies he had under the sink.  He found some things that would get him started for today but made a mental note to write down some supplies for the next time he was out.
“Don’t say it,” Cas growled.  Dean was slightly taken aback and made to step back before Cas’ hand tightened around his.  “I’m sorry, Dean, I just don’t want you to think badly of yourself.  I don’t, so I don’t want you to carry it either.  You’re my mate.  You’ll have access to the money you need.”  He stepped closer and lowered his voice.  “You’re carrying my pup, Dean.  I would have you secure if you need money for anything.  I want you to be safe.”
They dressed and headed downstairs.  Amelia had kept food warm for them for lunch and Dean thanked her for the food and the ability to sleep.  She smiled and waved him off.  He and Cas sat down together and ate.  They chatted about how many calves had been born and Cas told him another three were born overnight and were in the calving barn, safe and warm.
He was starting to forget that and it scared Dean how easily he had just fit into the lives of the two alphas.  The ranch was his home.
As he settled back into the couch he felt a yawn creeping its way up and he steeled himself for the pain he knew was coming even though he tried to stifle it.  He got through and realized that he was tired again.  He really should move to his bed though.  Dean closed his eyes just for a moment, intending to ask Cas to help him get to his room when he came back down.  He was out as soon as his lids closed.
Both alphas sat in disbelief at her words.  Dean blinked at them and tried to process the conversation.  Not only had Amelia scolded them, but she had just put both of them in their place for making decisions for her without asking.
This was different.  This was something new and it made Dean’s stomach feel like butterflies had invaded it.  It made his mouth dry and his omega whine.
He hadn’t detected a scent bond, but he wasn’t sure. Maybe he was overlooking something. He tried to smell Cas as he put the wine in front of him, but he smelled the same, no change in his scent, and he definitely didn’t smell like the beta. So, not even scent bonded.
They spent some time just looking around so Dean could get a feel for what was there.  They bought fresh smoothies from a stand while they walked around and when Cas asked Dean if he was hungry he led them over to a corner booth called Angel Cakes.
“What’s wrong?” He was moving on instinct, pulling on his pants from the day before, searching for a shirt.
Dean was sitting in his office at work, starting at his phone.  He had been trying to work up the courage to call his brother all morning.  He wasn’t sure why he was the one feeling worried and unsure because it was Sam’s fault they were in this, but he guessed if he made that call he would be stepping forward to talk and Dean was nervous about that.
“It’s nothing!” She cried trying to placate him.  “Everything is great, actually, but we can talk about me tomorrow, ok?”
“Good.  Sam will stand up for Dean as his alpha and Gabe and Balth for me as witnesses, so you can talk to them too.”
“Nah, I’m good.  Keep me company though?” Dean asked.  Cas moved to one of the patio chairs and sat.  They were quiet while Dean cooked, but it was comfortable.  Dean didn’t feel the need to fill every moment with Cas with chatter.  They had only been dating for a short while but Dean felt closer to Cas than he had to anyone else before.  He really liked Cas and wanted him around for a long time.
“No, please, stop.  Let me go, I can’t take any more, please,” Dean continued to whine and struggle in Cas’ grip.
“Alright, then, I’ll be out in the closest pasture.  Jimmy,” he said meaningfully glaring again at his twin.  Cas grabbed his plate as he rose from the table.  Dean saw him nod once and Dean looked between them as he tried to figure out what was going on.  Cas had only eaten half of his meal but he placed it into the sink anyway.
But as the holidays had approached and Dean’s happiness grew, Cas’ alpha had surfaced and wanted to claim.  Dean was always beautiful and sweet, but he had become breathtaking in his joy.  Cas wanted him to always be this happy and content.  Dean had grown some and he was putting on weight.  Most of it was muscle, but he was filling out completely, which suited Cas fine.  He was far too thin when he arrived.
He felt a twinge of guilt at that.  He was always busy.  He had made promises both to Dean and himself about working less and taking care of his mate more, but he had broken them.  He needed to be at the company.  He had worked so hard to build it up, he wouldn’t let something like an accidental mate take his attention away from it.
Dean pressed his lips together.  His phone chimed and he sighed.  He hadn’t really wanted to tell Cas that he was Dean Winchester, omega son of Pack Alpha John Winchester, but if he kept it from him after Cas asked directly it would be bad.  Dean had had more than one alpha sniff around him because of his status.  Cas truly didn’t seem to know who he was though.
“Nothing, Sammy,” Dean sighed unclenching his fist.  He took a deep breath and blew it out through his nose.  “Cas and I have been courting for a few weeks and it’s getting harder and harder to abide by Naomi’s courtship rules.  I don’t know if I’m going to be able to hold out until his birthday at this rate.”
“Come on daddy!  Hurry!  We don’t want to be late!  Ms. Stone told us that it’s important to be on time!”
They stood there a moment, eyes locked, just holding each other.  Cas taking comfort that Dean was unhurt and Dean taking comfort that Cas was there to help him.
“I think that’s a good place to start.  And, Dean,” she said, making him look at her.  “You might have been the one to stop calling, but he let you go.  You did it to each other.  Now, Emma, I can’t tell you what to do.  She’s your daughter and do what you think is best for her
Cas closed his eyes briefly and got a hold of his anger before Dean thought he was angry with him.  In fact, Cas was furious with himself.  He should have escorted Dean all the way upstairs.  One of the reasons that he felt comfortable living in this building was because of the careful watch of the employees and security.  They wouldn’t have let Dean in.
“Hey, Cas, I can only get one of those,” he told him.  Cas only nodded and went back to looking at the shelf.  “Cas?”
“I’m sure she would like that,” Cas told him.  Dean spent the rest of the ride home thinking about what he could do for a nursery.
He groomed Dean and pressed a kiss to his forehead while Dr. Milton wrote some notes on her clipboard.  She put in back into the holder at the end of the bed and looked back to them with a sympathetic smile on her face.
“I intend to ask Dean to marry and mate.”  Cas was careful to phrase it as a statement and not a question.  He would mate Dean, if Dean would have him, regardless of what his mother thought.  Dean was everything he wanted in a mate and his youth and bright spirit were something Cas needed.
Dean nodded.  He looked down at the floor.  He never met his dad’s eyes anymore.  He felt the happiness that he had earlier evaporate as his father spoke.  He reminded him, again, that he was only worth something to his father if he was a virgin.
They made idle conversation as Dean walked Impala to their destination.  It was only a short distance but the day was warm and bright, the sun shining down on them.  Dean held Cas and inhaled his scent of fresh bread and home.
“But I was handling it, Sam.  Who do you think did everything?  Bobby mostly sat in his office and researched folklore and supernatural phenomenon for the last three years.  I hired everyone that works in that shop.  I did payroll, I did the ordering, I dealt with unhappy customers.  I basically ran that shop for years before I bought it.  But instead of seeing that, you just saw what you wanted.”
“Thank you is appropriate,” he chuckled.  “I’ll be in touch with details about the challenge.  Tell your mate and Sam and anyone else you think you want to keep in the loop and I’ll contact you soon.”
Dean closed his eyes and leaned on the cool tile while the hot water cascaded down his back.  He stood like that for a few moments, just feeling the water while he tried to relax.  He had been comfortable at the hospital.  Cas had been there with him, literally right next to him for days and Dean couldn’t deny that he liked it.  He liked his mate close and after having it for so many days nonstop he wasn’t sure how he was going to feel when they were back to real life.
Alfie pulled away from the curb before his door had clicked shut and they were off.  He checked his phone and answered a few emails while they traveled before he put it down.  He thought about Dean as he looked out the window.
“Thank you.  I haven’t broached this with him yet, so I’ll let you know.”  Cas thought that they were finished and he made to rise but Pam put a hand out to stop him.
Dean could only nod as a lump formed in his throat.  Before he could say anything in response the door opened again and Naomi entered.  She quietly approached the bed and ran her hand through her omega’s hair, comforting him.
“You’re not, Dean,” Cas told him firmly.  Dean felt the alpha shift and wrap one hand around his back while the other lifted under his legs.  Cas easily moved him back up to lay on his pillows and Dean closed his eyes.  “Rest, Dean.  I’ll be back shortly.”
Dean was happy to stay in bed for a few more minutes, but he knew it was borrowed time.  Cas’ reminder kick started the gears in his head and he began to think about everything that was happening today.
Cas tugged Dean forward and they sat together on the other side of the small table along the bench.  Dean felt Cas’ thigh press against his in the tight space and he wrapped his arm around his omega’s waist.
“It’s ok, Cas,” he whispered.  “We can take two trucks and I can ride with you.  It’s fine.  And I’m sure Jimmy’s fine with it too, he’s just jerking you around.”
He was able to pull in some of Cas’ clean crisp scent and it helped somewhat, but it wasn’t enough to ease him completely.  He rolled towards Cas and gripped his shirt where he could reach.  He curled himself into a tight ball and closed his eyes again.  He hoped that this would be over soon.
“Of course, I made it Sam, I’m the one that asked for the damn dinner in the first place,” Dean retorted.  His anger was simmering with his brother and he was just waiting for Sam to say something stupid enough for Dean to be able to clock him.
Cas threw open the door and jumped out.  “Across the street, on the bench,” he told them breathlessly.  He slammed the door shut and looked quickly into the road to make sure he wouldn’t get hit by a car.  The last thing he needed was to be so close to Dean and then get hurt himself.
“What room do you want to use?  I get no say, obviously, but I think it makes the most sense for you to use Cas’ room.  It’s saturated in his scent already and he has the bathroom attached.”
“I just need some air,” he told him quietly.  He skirted the edge of the room and blocked out what the alphas were saying until he could get to the hallway.  He should have known that Cas wouldn’t let him go off on his own and he scented him directly behind him, especially when he could scent everything Dean was feeling.  Cas caught up to him and steered him to a door with a gentle hand to the small of his back.
Dean went willingly to the mattress and Cas pressed down onto his back.  “Love you Dean,” Cas panted against his neck.  “I’m going to take care of you.”
“Alright, well, everything looks great.  You’ve been doing a good job, Dean.  The babies look healthy and they are a good size, which is why you’re larger than usual when you’re this far along.  I’m going to get you a few print outs of the pictures and some other information and we’ll get you on your way.”
“I don’t want a big wedding that will take a year to plan.  I watched Jess go through that and it was
“What are they doing here?” she demanded, indicating Sam and Dean.  Her voice had become shrill in the quiet hallway and Dean grimaced.
Cas shook his head and sighed.  “I know, I’m sorry.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”  He pushed away from the side of the barn stall and gathered the empty buckets to put away.
Dean gathered a few of the plates to take out into the other room and brought them out.  He was surprised to meet Cas half way there.
Cas sighed.  “I’m sorry, Dean, I really am.  I just don’t have time to think about gifts for you every week.”
Dean watched as Cas sniffed the air, scenting. He honed in on Dick, whose scent was smug and congratulatory, sitting back in his chair, smile still on his face.  Cas’ growl increased and Dean began to panic more.  He needed to get some control for himself and his alpha.
Dean told him about his current course schedule and Cas had some suggestions for things he could do to increase his desirability for the company.  They talked about Kansas State, where Cas had graduated two years prior, and the marketing industry around Kansas.  Dean lost track of time but when Cas checked his watch Dean realized that their coffees were long gone and it had grown darker.  He checked his phone and realized his class started forty-five minutes ago.
The floats and marching bands were colorful and full of loud music and dancing.  Dean couldn’t remember a time when he had enjoyed an outing so much.  He tried to soak in every bit of the fun and excitement he could.  He wanted to stay with these alphas and he didn’t want to constantly worry if he would be fired, but he had learned enough over the course of the years that the ground crumbled under him fastest when he was happy.
Dean sighed, letting some of the tension ease in his posture.  “Yea, actually.  Do you want to come to the house after work?  Cas is coming home, so he’ll be there, but yea, I’d like to talk.”
Jimmy and Amelia mated the last week of March and moved into the ranch house with Cas and Dean until the other house was ready.
Dean stepped back and helped him with his things after he shut the door.  The cabin was warm and cozy and Cas wondered if they should just stay here when this was over.  It had begun to feel like their home together.
Suddenly, the alpha withdrew and stood to his full height.  The look on his face scared Dean more than anything so far and he couldn’t catch his breath.  The red bled into his dad’s eyes and Dean’s stomach dropped.  He knew his father was about to make a decree as Pack Alpha.
“Yes, it is, Cas.  Stop doing this to yourself.  You love him and I’m pretty damn sure he loves you too.  You just need to get your head out of you ass.”
“That’s true,” Cas replied.  He did not want to engage in any confrontation with Winchester.  He kept an image of Dean in his mind, his goal to make sure he was safe and that they could marry and mate.
“I do,” Dean said approvingly as he ran his hand down Cas’ side.  Neither was really aware of what he was doing.  “You look very fetching.”
“Hmm, some time, probably.  Let’s hear what other omegas at Roman’s Omegas had to say about their former co-worker.”
Cas introduced him to his brothers who were both very different.  Dean was delighted with their personalities and got along with them well.  He and Gabe talked about good pie and then debated the merits of pie verses cake.  He talked with Balth about college life and what Dean was taking for courses and what Balth teaches.  Naomi asked if he was planning on finishing his degree before he had pups.  Dean was so shocked by her question that Cas had to step in and remind her that they are newly dating and pups were a longways off.  He also told her that he would support Dean in whatever he wanted to do if they got there.  He valued Dean’s education especially since it was in marketing.
“It’s done already?” he asked the next morning.  They were eating cereal at the breakfast table like usual.
She was right.  It was Cas.  He was a little nervous about it, but to be honest, he was more excited.  He knew that Cas was going to be there for him and that they were going to see about another pup during the heat, but he just wanted to belong to Cas.  He wanted that mark to show off to everyone.
Cas nodded and brought Dean’s hand to his lips.  He pressed a chaste kiss there and they finished their meal and headed home.  Dean fell asleep on the way back and had a nice nap in the car.  He was relieved to know that the babies were ok.  But, Holy shit, there were two of them.
Dean knew he needed to stay as far away as possible until he was ready to strike least his scent give him away.  He and Jody would try and time it so that they were moving around the same time.  Dean glanced over and saw that she had paused.  She lifted her hand in a silent signal.  Dean took a breath and unsheathed his short sword from his belt.
Dean tried to shrug it off.  “It’s fine, Cas.  They, along with everyone else, had made up their minds about me when the first news story broke.  I never had a chance there, Cas.”
His hard, thick cock sprung out.  It was red and angry looking.  Jimmy must have been hard for a while for it to be this abused.  Dean automatically sunk to his knees and opened his mouth.  He relaxed his throat and locked his hands behind his back like he had been taught.  Jimmy held him by the hair and groaned as he used his mouth but pulled him up and crawled on top of him to knot his ass instead of his mouth when he was ready.
Two weeks later he was not happy at all.  He whimpered in pain as he paced the front room.  He made a circle through the living room and around the island of the kitchen before he started again.  Cas was on the phone with the hospital and Dean wanted to go already.
There were cocktails first and Dean found himself relaxing as he stood next to Cas.  He was able to join into conversations more easily than he had the last time and other people were more accepting of him in general.
He was going to get into Cas’ bed and sleep.  If the alpha came up and wanted him to leave then he would, but he was going to try and see.  Dean walked into the room and scented heavily.  The air was saturated in Cas’ scent and he could still smell the faint traces of their combined scents as he moved to the bed.
Doctor Milton appeared next to his bedside.  She smiled slightly.  “I bet you are,” she told him kindly.  “I’ll make sure that they schedule a time to come back so you’re not caught off guard.”
She pulled out a pad and pen from her coat pocket.  She began to write as she spoke.  “So, alphas first.  Then you need to up your intake of fluids and protein.  I know that you don’t want to eat anything, but you need to.  Lean meats that are bland to start. Nothing rich because it will come right back up.  Lots of water.  Fresh fruits and veggies too.  Those have a higher water content and lots of vitamins.  Are you taking a prenatal vitamin?”  Jody paused her writing and instructions to look at him.  Dean nodded, sort of.  Jody’s brows rose in question.
mated to a very lovely omega who is carrying your pup, and yet, you’re here working and talking to me instead of taking him home where I’m sure he’d rather be.”
Once he was standing next to the bed he grabbed his clothes that were strewn all over the floor and made a hasty retreat.  He threw them on as he made his way down the hall and stairs to the first floor.  Thankfully his keys and wallet were still in his pants pockets and he spied his boots in the hallway at the front door.
“Ok, Papa,” Ben replied.  Cas smiled at him and placed a quick kiss on his forehead before he let the boy down.  Ben scampered back into the playroom and Dean could hear him banging around.  He shook his head and turned back to Cas.
“It’s one Dean,” Kevin was saying.  His voice was still soft.  Dean knew that his friends were worried.  They always talked to him in soft tones these days.  Like he might break if there was too much noise.  Dean supposed that they weren’t far off the mark.
Sam visibly swallowed and nodded.  “That’s completely fair.  I am really sorry, Dean.  I’ll be different.  I want to be your brother again and I want to be part of you and Cas’ lives.  I love Jess and I have really fucked things up with her, too.  And I really thought Chuck was going to fire me, so I’ve basically run my life into the ground the last few months being a dick.”  He looked down at his hands.  “I’m sorry, Dean.  I am and I want a chance to make it up to you.”
He sighed and looped the string around his neck before he tucked it into his own shirt.  He would keep it safe until Dean was ready.
Dean groaned when he cracked his eyes open.  The light filtering from the window blinded him.  He wasn’t sure if it was late in the day or if the hangover he certainly had made it worse.  He clutched his head as he rolled over only to be met with a solid, well defined back.  He squinted one eye and tried to focus.  Dean thought back to the night before.  He tried to remember how he got in bed with such a nicely built man as the one he was staring at, but the memories were fuzzy.
Cas had only been listening with half an ear as Dean had talked about the day.  He was checking his emails while Dean finished dinner and had only caught the last part where he said he was going out.
He heard Cas growl behind him and felt the bed dip.  Cas didn’t tease him and soon he was maneuvering them onto their sides to wait out his knot.  He brushed the sweaty hair away from Dean’s face and kissed his neck.
Cas watched Eileen and Sam through dinner and smiled softly.  He snuggled into Dean, happy that Sam seemed to have a strong match with his omega.  By the time they retired to bed, Cas was exhausted and ready for rest.
“Welcome to the Roadhouse,” he said as he approached. “What will you have tonight?” Dean laid out napkins and tried not to blush when Cas looked up and stared at Dean. “Hey, Cas.”
When Cas had reassured himself that Dean was ok and both their scents had returned to normal he pulled back slightly and looked into Dean’s eyes.  He still held him close but loosely.  Dean could step away when he was ready and Cas would let him.  Dean nodded slightly and stepped back.  Cas’ hands dropped from his body and Dean had to hold back a whine.  He clenched his jaw and turned to face his brother again, putting some distance between him and Cas.
“What? No, Dean, that’s not what I mean.  Oh, Dean,” Cas said.  He cradled the back of his head and Dean cried harder.
Dean gave him a sad smile.  “I knew that she was dead and how she died, but I didn’t know by who’s hand.  I’m trying to piece together what happened, Cas and there are big blind spots.”
The ranch is based on my grandparents farm in the Southeast, so this might not be at all what ranches are like in Montana.
Dean wrinkled his nose and bared his throat at the anger rolling off of his familial alpha.  Dean almost choked on it as he scrambled back in his bed.  His back hit the wall and he could only stare as his father stalked into the room.
“Hey there,” he began.  The man had noticed him and made eye contact while he had been walking towards him.  “I’m Dean.  I’ll be taking over for Ellen, so you just let me know what you need.”  Dean’s skin was crawling and he wanted to back away quickly, but he didn’t want to be rude.  The alpha raked his eyes up and down Dean’s form before he spoke.
Cas had been good about letting Dean work through his issue.  He could see his alpha watching him, frowning at him when he didn’t think Dean was looking.  Dean appreciated the space and made sure to show his alpha all the love and affection he could when they were together.  Dean was ok, he just needed to get his thoughts in order and he needed time to do that.  He also needed to keep busy.  Cas had given Dean several days but Dean knew that he would press him soon about it.  Dean decided that he would talk to his alpha that night.
Dean got his hands on Cas’ pants and tugged them down along with his boxers, freeing his hard cock that was already angry and red, leaking precum.  Cas pulled Dean’s shirt from his body and spun him around before he could get his hands on the alpha.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered.  He hadn’t realized that Amelia hadn’t put the drinks on the table.  “I’ll get you a glass, ok?”
Dean kissed him in thanks and they were out the door in the next breath.  Cas was hungry too, so he wasn’t worried that Dean’s single mindedness was going to get them to dinner quickly.  They road in the Impala after Cas had loaded up a few boxes and he felt one step closer to living with Dean.
There he paused as if he wasn’t sure if he should continue.  Cas decided to help him out and he folded his hands on top of the desk and leaned forward.
He swallowed hard.  Things were moving quickly.  His picture was uploaded on the website, so the alphas knew what he looked like, but there had been no picture of them.  It didn’t really matter what they looked like if their scents were compatible and they offered him a home, but he didn’t like the faceless emails.  He couldn’t picture these alphas.
Dean nodded and asked one more question.  “I don’t know how to drive.  Cas, you mentioned that I’ll need to learn how to drive the four wheeler?”
Cas hung up the phone and sighed.  It was late in the day.  He wanted this over with and he needed to get to Jody quickly.  He buzzed Charlie and asked her to get Sherriff Mills on the phone, then he called Sam.
He was brought back to the present when he realized that the insistent prodding against his ass had stopped.  He didn’t have long to think about what that meant before he felt the hard length of an erection pressing against him again, this time, skin to skin.
“Part of it is that I want to get to know you.  Cas might not have shown it before, but he’s been smitten with you since the beginning.  He wouldn’t have mated you if his alpha wasn’t sure.  I have to admit, that part of it is selfish, too.  I’m not interested in Castiel romantically, but we’ve been friends for many years and I don’t want to lose that friendship.  I know I will if we can’t be friendly.”
“Mother,” Cas greeted her.  He stepped forward and embraced her, letting go of Dean’s hand as he did so.  When he stepped back her gaze traveled to him and Dean gave her a small smile.
“Hey jerk, wanna- good grief Dean!  What is going on?”  Sam had opened the door and took one step in before he covered his nose with his hand.  The scent in the room must be pretty strong for his unpresented nose to react that strongly.  Dean sniffed the air and recoiled himself.  The scent of sadness, guilt, worry and fear were like a thick blanket in the room.
After talking with Cas about his role in the house, he had talked with Eileen.  They had come to an agreement and so far it was working.  Dean cleaned their bedroom and the main parts of the house while Eileen did the vacuuming and the rest of the rooms upstairs.
Cas fed Dean and they lay back down together on top of the covers.  Dean was asleep in minutes and Cas followed soon after.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean securely and leaned them back further into the cushions.  “It makes me feel better when we are equal partners in our relationship.  You want me to hold you up and fuck you against the wall, I’m happy to do so, just make sure it’s what you want and not offer it because it’s something you think I want or need, ok?”
Cas had told him the twins would be insatiable the first week and he had been right.  They ended up with sandwiches that night for dinner because Cas pulled him upstairs again after lunch, then Jimmy kept him there for another knotting.  Though Dean didn’t mind it, he was starting to get anxious about the fact that he wasn’t doing anything to help in the house.  He couldn’t even gather the eggs or fix meals regularly.
Cas pulled him close.  “You’re safe, Dean.  I wouldn’t let Luke stay if I thought otherwise, but we don’t want to take any chances.  Your health, safety and overall wellbeing are important enough to us to make sure we aren’t wrong about Luke.  This room is best because you spend more nights with me in the first place, but you’ll also not have to leave the safety of your room to use the bathroom if you need to.”
“I want Jo and Charlie to take Emma and I want to share my heat with you.  I want you to claim me and mate me.”
The swish of Charlie’s skirts and muted scent told him she had moved away.  He heard the door open and low voices before she returned.
Dean obediently took the bowl and ate but he didn’t say anything.  When he was finished he handed it back to Cas and shifted down again until he was laying in the middle of the nest.  He closed his eyes, effectively blocking Cas out.  He scented Dean and could smell a mixture of things.  Dean was feeling like everything was collapsing again and Cas felt helpless.
Cas lowered his lips to Dean’s and Dean opened for him.  They both groaned at the feeling of their bodies touching and their lips reacquainting themselves after so long.  Cas took control of the kiss and Dean submitted to him beautifully.
“Charlie, you know that Dean sees anyone taking the orphaned pups as a service to the pack.  You wouldn’t have to work so hard at your duties because taking care of the pup would be the duty you’re serving.  These pups need homes and loving families.  Mary is preparing a nursery with a few omegas and betas who have offered to help there for any pups that don’t have a home, but we all really want them to go straight to their new families.”  Cas realized he was getting excited and worked to calm himself.  “Charlie, I’m sorry, I’m not trying to push.  If you don’t think taking a pup right now is something you want to do for whatever reason, it’s ok.  I just want to make sure you know that you shouldn’t worry about shelter or work if you take the pup.  Dean and the council have made it clear and provided a plan to make it as easy as possible for families to take them”
He scrolled through the texts, wondering if he had overlooked something and his heart sank with the realization that Dean hadn’t contacted him in ten days.  He had just gone through the most terrible rut he’d ever had and had to be sedated because he was pining for his mate and Dean hadn’t called or texted to check in or…anything.
He purchased the biggest turkey he could order and made all the traditional sides.  They had potatoes, green bean casserole, stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Dean made a small ham, bread, deviled eggs and yams.  He made four pies.
Dean watched as Sam took it gently, cradling it in his hands.  He cocked a brow at his brother, who stuck out his tongue.
“I thought we could go to the Green City Lounge,” Cas told him.  “I’m not sure if you like jazz, but the atmosphere is its own reason to go.”
Dean nodded. “I understand, Cas.  But the facts are the same.  At the end of this, I’ll have taken your knot and I’ll still be without a mate.  I will still have to figure out what to do in another three months, and then three months after that and on and on forever.
Dean could smell the misery now that he was closer.  His nose was flooded with the scent of moldy bread and something else that tickled his throat and made his alpha rumble.
“Castiel, stop.”  Jimmy’s voice was firm and cut through his rising panic.  “I know what Dean said, but I also know that those things can change.  You also said you didn’t want a mate right now, but I know you’ve changed your mind.  You can’t see what I see.  Dean is as in love with you as you are with him.”
“None of them will starve.  They also have access to the internet to search for jobs and I’ve been working with some of the local businesses to try to hire some of them on a temporary basis, like a probation, and hopefully they will keep them on.
He stepped under the spray and sighed, able to appreciate it more than he had last night.  The water pressure was strong and the temperature was hot.  There were glass doors around the shower stall and next to it was a big tub.  Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had been able to take a bath and he couldn’t wait to try it out.  Bathing in privacy was a luxury he never had living in the omega dorms.
Dean had no idea what the charity was for, other than something to do with wildlife but as he listened to the speakers he realized that the charity was a worthy cause and he was glad they had come.  The conservation efforts alone were staggering to him and he was glad that they had come to support the charity.  He wished that he had asked Cas to bid on more items.
Dean wasn’t sure what to think.  Chuck seemed to agree with everything Naomi was saying, and though Dean had no reason not to believe her, he had built up the meeting in his mind to be something different.  He was worried they were here to judge him, not support him.
“This is how it’s going to work,” Dean began, letting his alpha bleed into his voice.  “Cas will hand me the traditional omega items, mom can stand in for the official Pack Omega, but no vow will be made or renewed.  Cas will take the vow when we mate.  It will default back to mom and things will continue to run as normal.”
“Something is wrong, Cas, you’re sick,” he said.  Cas couldn’t hold in a quiet moan when Dean pressed his hand to the alpha’s forehead.  It felt cool and having his omega touch him soothed something inside of him.
“Dean.”  Cas’ voice was like a whip cracking, alpha tone strong enough to make Dean whimper and bare his neck.  Dean was trying to keep calm but fear was bleeding into his scent.  He closed his eyes and waited, hardly breathing.  It felt like eternity before he heard Cas speak again.
Dean smiled faintly.  “No, Alpha.  Well, not a lot at least,” he amended.  “I’m just bored and grouchy.  I need my routines and I’m getting anxious without them in place.”
“Neither Cas nor I cook well, so we’re happy to have someone who knows what he’s doing in the kitchen.  It’s your domain, Dean.  We relinquish it happily,” Jimmy said.
Cas turned his attention from the empty doorway to his PR director.  He raised one brow at her.  Charlie was not only his employee, she was his best friend.
“Yes,” Cas agreed.  “But we have a lot in common and I enjoy hearing Dean’s perspective and thoughts about school and music, too.”
She looked like she was about to burst and her scent was excited and happy.  Dean returned the smile she gave him and she stepped forward.  Before Dean knew what was happening, she had enveloped him in a big hug and Dean found himself melting at the familiar scent of another omega.
He had also been able to buy a few second hand books about farming on the plains that he had brought.  He had looked over them carefully the last few days and he was pleased to note that he knew a lot about farming as it seemed similar to the gardening he had done at the institute.
“Yea!  It was great until I wasn’t paying attention and cut myself.  Mom was worried but it’s nothing,” he told Cas bravely.  Cas glanced at Tessa who was trying to hide a smile.  Cas nodded back at Ben.
A twinge of guilt passed through his stomach at the thought of Cas.  He had been able to put aside any guilt because Cas didn’t know about her and he never would.  He would be free to go about his life and not be tied down with Dean and an unwanted pup.  But now that Cas was back, he didn’t seem so sure.  He sighed.  That was an argument he would have with himself another day.
“Well, I don’t really have anything else to do right now, so we’ll see.  I’m not sure what Cas wants, we haven’t actually talked about it.”
In the end they had a decent meal of steak and shrimp over pasta and asparagus.  The nice part about the class was that you chose what you wanted to cook and then you were able to sit and eat in a small private space.  There was a waiter who brought bread and drinks and they had several desserts you could choose from.
“Who is she?  What history do you have?  I know you told me that there wasn’t anything between you now, and I believe it, Cas, I really do.”  He looked up earnestly and Cas nodded.  “I just…can’t get it out of my head.  Maybe it’s insecurity still or that I feel like she would be a better match for you, I don’t know.  I can’t get the words from the other omegas out of my head either, about being replaceable.  And the newspaper article said that you had dated.  I just have all these snippets of information and I’m not sure what’s true and what’s not and…” he shrugged.
As he filled his plate Dean tuned into the conversation going on around him.  It was focused on the cleaning for the day.  Dean knew that most of the castle would be cleaned during April and May but the hall was a big job to get done in one day.  Most of the pack that lived inside the walls of the castle would be working today.
“How do you know Dick Roman?” he asked.  His voice was low and dangerous and Dean was quick to try and neutralize Cas’ alpha.
Cas frowns at him, considering.  “Girl?  You mean Daphne?”  Dean nods to him.  Cas chuckles.  “Daphne is not my girlfriend.  She’s a family friend that has also relocated.  We’ve known each other for most of our lives.” He shuddered a little. “It would be like you dating Jo,” he continued and it was Dean’s turn to shudder.
Dean watched as he emerged from the closet dressed for bed and headed straight to the bathroom.  He closed the door and Dean was left again.  He didn’t know what to do.  He wasn’t sure if Cas was angry with him or just tired.  He could be both, but Dean didn’t know.
Cas registered that Dean had lost his clothes at some point and he shifted closer to him.  Dean took his hand, still working his three fingers in and out, and gently pulled them out.  He crawled behind Cas and he felt his hot breath gently glide over his hole as Dean pulled his cheeks apart.
Both alphas nodded, taking in his words.  “We will take care of you, Dean,” Cas told him.  Jimmy squeezed his shoulders and Dean nodded.  He knew that.
“It’s true, Mom,” Gabe said.  Dean saw Balth nod in agreement.  “Balth and I cleaned and stocked it for them when they came back.  We’ve both been to the cabin several times since then.”
Dean and Cas murmured their good nights and Jimmy left them.  Cas sat on the couch with Dean for a while in silence.  Dean could tell that he scented the air every now and then to gauge how he was doing.  The third time he did it, Dean laughed.
Dean shook his head.  “No, Cas, I want to tell you.  It’s just, it’s not flattering to him or me and I hate that he acts that way and that he makes me feel the way he does.  I try and just brush it off, but last night was hard.”  Dean took a deep breath.  “He made me tell him who I was with and then proceeded to do twenty questions about how serious we were.  Then he went on to remind me that I’m only valuable as long as I’m a virgin and that I better be on my best behavior and make a match that would be good for the pack.  He just sees me as only worth the money the reverse dowry will bring in.  He even told Sammy that I was lucky because he thought about mating me after my first heat.”
“I’m going to spend the day at the house with you.  Cas will stay close this morning and then before dinner we’ll head out to check the livestock together.”  He stepped closer to Dean and pulled him in again.  He gently kissed him and patted him on the butt.  Dean grinned at the familiar gesture and moved to the dishwasher.
Now, they were home and Cas held him securely in his arms as he headed for the bathroom.  Cas quickly stripped him and put him in the shower with a kiss to his lips first and his belly second.  He felt enormous and he didn’t know how he was going to stretch any more.  He technically had four more weeks, but Dean was not convinced the twins would wait.  He felt heavy and uncoordinated.  The days were warming and Dean found that he was not happy about it because he was uncomfortable in the warm weather.
As they continued to eat and talk, Cas thought Dean might have been right about needing to eat sooner rather than later.  He was starting to feel uncomfortable and knew his heat was coming.  His skin was prickly and a fine sheen of sweat coated his forehead.  He knew his scent was changing when Dean’s nostrils flared and he stopped talking.
“It’s just that we’re bonded well.  It’s normal Dean.  It’s okay for you to mark me,” Cas told him.  Dean’s eyebrows rose.  He shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was.  Cas nodded.  “It’s ok to mark an alpha you’re bonded to, Dean.  I should have said something earlier about it, but I just didn’t think you wanted to.”
“Ok, honey, it’s going to be ok,” she whispered over and over again. When Dean had himself under control he pulled back and wiped his eyes on his sleeve.
Dean had told Cas that he had recently gotten back into cooking and it was really true.  Before, Dean hated cooking just for himself and did it only when he absolutely had to, and even then, it was frozen pizza or microwaved burritos.
Luke shrugged.  “Just wondering what makes him so special, I guess.  I’ll respect your wishes and not touch him, Cas, but you know that’s uncommon.  House omegas are there to service the house.”
They arrived on time at the venue and Dean took Cas’ offered hand as they walked in.  The firm had rented a hip restaurant for their party so it was closed to the public.  Dean didn’t even want to know how much money that would cost.
“Ok, what about food?  I see that you pulled out the things you bought a few weeks ago already,” Jimmy said with a nod to the counter across the room where he had placed everything.
“We’re back to having someone with me all the time,” he sighed.  “That way, if dad does show up and orders me to do something at least there will be someone here who knows what’s happening.”
Cas’ jaw ticked but he held Dean’s hand carefully.  “First, you are not a drunk man whore.  I don’t like you talking about yourself that way.  Maybe that was you before, but I’ve never met that Dean and I want you to stop thinking of yourself that way.”
When he woke up again it was to a noise downstairs.  He could tell that Cas was home and he wanted him.  He needed something else to eat anyway, even though he wasn’t hungry and everything he had tried had come back up.
When they were finished with the shopping, Cas directed Alfie to take them to a restaurant.  Dean was unfamiliar with it, but he wasn’t worried.  There were any number of new restaurants that popped up around New York at any time of the year.
“Me neither,” he replied.  “Besides, we have a lot to do today.  We are cleaning the hall so it’s all hands on deck.”
“Hey, I’m just teasing.  I’m happy for you guys,” he said as he sat back.  And Dean was.  He was happy that they had found each other.  Just like he was happy for Kevin.  It didn’t mean that the sharp pain in his chest wasn’t still there when he thought of Cas.  The smile slipped from his face as he stared at his hands.  He took a deep breath and looked back up.  Sam was looking at him from the other end of the table and gave him a tight smile.  Dean nodded to him signaling that he was ok.
She was with them when the policemen knocked on the door.  They had been playing with the large car track they had in their living room.  They had spent the afternoon building the best race track they could, using every piece they owned.  There were loops and curves and they had even built a pit out of Legos where they had the crew for when the cars needed new tires.
Dean looked around to see that both of the other alphas were staring at them.  Their presents had been opened and set aside and Dean wondered if Jimmy had tried to get their attention before.  Dean flushed slightly and cleared his throat.  He glanced down at Cas who also seemed to be a little flushed but who was also glaring at his brother.
Then he had been put into the system and probably not cared for well at all.  His age most likely had a lot to do with it, and Cas knew he was probably kicked out of the omega house the day he turned eighteen.  Turned out onto the street without any help or resources.
There was a window seat, and the sun came in so brightly in the summer.  There was a twin day bed against the wall and a plush, comfortable chair with an ottoman in the corner.  He always thought it would be perfect for a nursery almost as it was.
Jimmy didn’t like that answer because he shook his head.  “You will always come when I fuck you Dean.  It’s not fun if I’m the only one who enjoys it.”
Cas leaned in and nipped his scent gland and several other places along his neck.  He swiped them over with his tongue and Dean sagged against him at the claim.  Cas was a good alpha and Dean new just what Cas needed to help him feel better.  Hopefully, Cas’ alpha would calm down the longer he stayed but for now, Dean understood that Cas wanted him to know that he liked having Dean close, but to also deter anyone else.
Dean raised his eyebrows.  He guessed they were at the twenty questions point of the night.  Dean held in a laugh at the idea that this felt like the most awkward first date ever.
Dean stiffened.  The cold feeling that swept through him made his body lock up.  “What?” he whispered.  His mind struggled with the change of his emotions and the realizations of what was happening.  One minute he was certain he was going to get pregnant and the next Cas was telling him he was not only wearing a condom, but had them in the first place.
“Of course, Cas.  This is our home.  Where else would we go?”  Dean sat up all the way to look in his eyes.
“Are you alright?” Cas asked softly.  He rested his hand on Dean’s neck and thumbed his cheek.  Dean leaned into the touch and sighed.
Dean huffed but didn’t say anything.  He moved to get a vase from the cabinet and arranged the flowers.  He put them on the island where they could be displayed for everyone to see.  Dean’s happy omega scent lingered in the room long after dinner was over.
Did the pack know what had happened to him two nights ago?  Did they think he was as useless as his father did?  Would they agree with him?  Would they take advantage of him?  If he was already used, would any of them…
Cas shook his head then and turned back to Dean effectively shutting out everyone else.  “Are you ready?” he asked softly.
Dean looked up at his brother.  Not that he didn’t appreciate the concern, but Sam was making a big deal out of this.  They both knew Cas was leaving, it wasn’t news.  “I’m ok Sam, stop worrying.  You don’t need to freak out.”
After they were knotted, Dean was tired.  He felt sleep pull him under, but just before he closed his eyes he heard Cas.
“Cas, this is enough.  I can’t watch this again.  You’ve been doing this for almost a year now.  It’s not good for you.  You can’t keep living like this.”
“This is my soon to be mate, Dean Winchester.  You are on his father’s lands.  Did you know that?” he asked gently.
He planned, prepared and executed everything perfectly and he could scent how happy and relaxed and full the alphas were.  Cas was so pleased with him he pulled him upstairs for a knotting before Dean could finish the dishes.  An hour later Jimmy cornered him in the downstairs bathroom and knotted him up against the sink.
Cas watched as Dean ate his burger, his alpha itching to make sure he had enough food.  Dean let him hover and posture a bit, which Cas appreciated.  It helped to settle his anger that he could care for Dean and his wolf quieted.
Cas dipped down and pressed their lips together and, as most often happened when they kissed, things got heated quickly.  Cas had a hard time keeping himself in check that night.  Maybe it was his desire to make sure Dean knew that he liked him the way he was, or he wanted to make sure Dean knew he was still interested or wasn’t like his father.  Maybe it was just Cas’ alpha thinking with his dick.  Whatever it was, Cas had to use all his strength to pull away and put Dean in the car.  He took an extra minute to slowly walk around and get in the driver’s seat so he could cool himself off.
When Ellen came in with food and a glass of water for him he still didn’t respond.  She told him that she had to go because they were short staffed at the bar that night, but she would be back.  Sam was there and she’d check in later.  Dean didn’t respond, only continued to stare at the wall.
“If you say so,” Gabe said under his breath.  “You just don’t seem like the mating has changed your behavior at all.”
“Castiel Novak,” Cas told him.  Dean could hear the alpha authority in his voice and the doctor seemed to realize who Cas was
He wanted to leave and practically growled at her.  He needed to keep working to take his mind off the fact that they had been searching for weeks and they still had not found Dean.
“Hello Emma.  My name is Castiel, but you can call me Cas.”  He put his hand in hers and shook it gently.  Dean watched as Cas and Emma met for the first time.  This wasn’t how he had thought about their first meeting.  In the middle of a huge crowd without them knowing who each other was.  Dean had let himself fantasize about their first meeting after Cas had told him that he loved him and Dean had confessed that they had a child together.  Dean hadn’t realized his scent was turning to longing until Gabe coughed.  Dean started and tried to get control before he gave himself away even more.
He tried to tell himself that it was no different than when Cas had watched him from the porch before.  He had handled the vehicle just fine on those occasions and he hadn’t had any trouble.  This would be the same.  Nothing would happen and he would be with the alphas in no time.
Cas’ eyes widened for a moment before he smiled smugly.  “I had hoped that was the case,” he told Dean.
“Our house,” Cas said.  Dean didn’t know how to read Cas’ scent or expression.  “Our house.  You’ve lived there for months now, Dean.”
“I’ll be back soon,” Cas promised. “Jimmy owes me at least a few days,” he told him, reminding Dean of when Jimmy and Amelia had mated and Jimmy needed to stay close to her. Dean nodded and Cas dressed.  Dean stretched and followed him downstairs.  They made their coffee together and Dean heated up some breakfast casserole Amelia had left for them to eat.  Amelia wasn’t in the kitchen and the breakfast had long been over and cleaned up.
Cas’ hand came to rest protectively on his lower stomach, cupping the small swell that will never go away.  “Dean, you gave me a child.  It’s going to leave a mark and I love you more for them, not less.”  He bent down and gave Dean a gentle kiss on the lips.  “Let me show you how much I love you.  All of you.”
“You need water, not liquor, after your rut.  Especially this one.  You haven’t had any aside from the single glass you drank when we ate earlier.”
They rode back to the cabin in comfortable silence and Cas got them inside quickly.  Dean immediately stripped his coat and boots off and made a beeline for the bathroom.  Cas smiled fondly after him and took off his own things.
As they sat in the waiting room, Dean realized that it was almost Halloween.  There were cute bats and witches all around the waiting room walls.  There were pumpkins and fall leaves adorning the side tables and the pens at the reception desk were topped with fun Halloween erasers.  Dean hung his head.  Halloween.  How did he miss so much?
“Yes, Dean?” he calmly asked.  Cas was working in his office.  He looked up as Dean stopped at the threshold.
The day after Dean woke with a headache and he felt like he hadn’t slept at all.  He pulled himself out of the bed and trudged into the bathroom that he shared with Cas.  He hoped he wasn’t coming down with something.  The last thing he wanted was to be sick around Christmas.
Dean looked down to Emma and saw his excitement mirrored in her face.  They raced to answer the door to a bemused Cas.  Dean held the door open wide, gesturing to Cas to come in, but the broad grin on Cas’ face slowly slid away, his nostrils flaring.  Before he could move Emma had launched herself at him with a squeal.  He dropped the bags he was carrying and caught her to swing her up, peppering her face with kisses.  He held her tightly and she clung to his neck, scenting him.  Cas took a few breaths and whispered into her ear as he ran a hand down her hair.  She giggled and he set her down.
They were quiet again and Dean could feel himself spiraling down into helplessness and self-loathing.  He needed his nest.  He stood abruptly.
Dean could scent that Cas was struggling by the time they made it to the check out lane.  They waited in line behind a sweet elderly couple and Cas’ scent was tight and dry.  When he saw Cas clench his fists at his sides he decided to do something.  Jimmy was slightly behind them looking through a magazine and he turned to him.
When combined together with Jimmy’s scent, Dean thought that he could stay in there forever.  He could tell that his happy omega scent was permeating the air because the alpha’s scents changed slightly into something more relaxed and content.
Cas’ chest rumbled under Dean and he could feel him swelling in his jeans where he sat.  Cas liked the idea of Dean’s heat.  Jimmy on the other hand, might have also liked the idea but he laughed.
Around 4:15 Dean sent Emma in to play in the living room and pulled out the meat and spices for the burgers he was going to make.  He had gotten fresh buns at the grocery store the day before and only had to cut up the veggies for the burgers. He had five pounds of potatoes ready to wash to make fries and he turned on the oven to preheat.  He worked quickly, trying to make sure to time it so that the potatoes went into the oven right around 4:45 and the burgers were ready to cook, sitting on a plate in the fridge.
Dean didn’t have time to worry about her words before the doctor was walking in.  A beta with short brown hair walked in with a laptop open.  She smiled at Dean before washing her hands.  She introduced herself as Dr. Jody Mills.  She shook Dean’s hand and looked over his chart on the computer sitting on the counter.  “Well Dean.  Tell me what you’re here for.”  She looked back up at him.
Now, though, as they pulled up to the curb, his stomach was in knots.  He wasn’t sure he was going to make it and he wanted to ask Alfie to turn the car around.  Cas squeezed his hand in reassurance as the car stopped for them to exit.
Charlie brought a fresh tray of food around lunch time and traded out the old one.  Dean noticed there was more oatmeal and hot water for tea.  Dean talked with Charlie for a while.  She told him more about her time at the castle and what her life was like before.  Dean hadn’t spent much time with Charlie without Cas there as a buffer and he realized that he liked the cheery beta immensely.  She clearly loved Cas and Dean was glad, once again, that she was part of the pack now.
“Yea, Jimmy, you did.  Let’s get upstairs alright?”  Dean stood and pulled him up with him.  Jimmy came willingly and Cas was right behind them.  Luke shut off the TV and they all filed upstairs the way they had the previous night.  Dean was aware that Luke was right behind them and only Cas separated him from the alpha.  He knew that he was safe, but he made sure to be as close to Jimmy as possible.
Dean didn’t know he was crying until he realized that the noises surrounding him were his sobs echoing off of the tile in the bathroom.  He cried harder and reached out for the wall.  He slowly slid himself down until he was seated on the floor of the shower, legs curled up as much as he could.  He leaned back onto the cool tiles and let the water wash over him while he cried.
But Cas had handled it well and Dean would too.  He would do anything for Cas, especially after that dinner.
“Ok, then.  How about you come over around five and I’ll cook us something with all this,” he said waving his hand towards the trunk.
Dean sat in the car for a few minutes thinking about all the memories and working up the courage to get out and go up to the door.  Fortunately, Cas must have been waiting for him, because before Dean got a chance, Cas was opening the passenger door and sliding in the front seat.  Dean was startled but Cas had a bright smile on his face.
They spent the next hour organizing the food and supplies and getting ready.  Dean already felt the desire to start working on his nest, so Cas encouraged him to do it.  He got towels and washcloths and put them in the bathroom.  He got a pitcher and filled it with water along with two plastic cups.  He put those on the nightstand next to the condoms.  Granola bars and jerky went in the drawer and extra sheets went on the trunk at the end of the bed.
When Cas had heard the beta’s ugly words to Dean, to his mate, he had been furious.  The vibrant and charming omega that Cas remembered was now hunched over and pulled in on himself as he had backed up against the wall.  The beta’s words had had a negative effect on him.
“Thanks Dad,” Cas said softly.  “It hasn’t been so difficult up to now, but I’ll be conscious of it and if I start to feel like I need more or Dean and I are getting to a tipping point, I’ll let you know.”
Suddenly, a hand was on his shoulder.  He looked up to see his mother standing over him looking at him questioningly.  He realized that he had been staring at his phone while he was lost in thought.  His scent must be broadcasting his anxiety and sadness.
Thought it was the end of May the winter was still close enough that everyone appreciated being outside in the warmth again.  Dean especially did and leaned in to the alpha as they chatted about nothing while they walked.
Dean shook his head as he dried his hands.  “It’s fine, Jesse.  I’ve got some things to do anyway,” he assured him.  He did have some things to do, but he didn’t need to tell him that it was a bath and a new book he wanted to read.
He was running through a mental list of things that needed to be done when the door to the adjoining chamber burst open and the excited chatter of pups filled their room.  They had taken his alpha chambers and turned them into a nursery when their first pup, Ben, arrived.  Cas wanted him close and Dean usually used the alpha chambers attached to the council chambers more than those, so he had suggested they turn it into a nursery.  His old office was a quiet space with a comfortable chair and small bed for Cas to nurse or take a fussy pup.
She was a pretty girl with long black hair, which was currently pulled back into a ponytail with a halo on top of her head.  She was wearing all white with a set of angel wings on her back.  Dean smiled sadly at her, an ache starting in his chest again when he was reminded that Cas was named after and angel.
Cas knocked on the door to the Winchester Pack House around ten the next morning.  John Winchester’s truck was parked outside so he knew the alpha was there.  If he hadn’t been, he would have texted Dean and let himself in.
Dean woke up the Friday before Thanksgiving in his dorm alone.  Kevin had taken a flight home last night after his last class so Dean was solo this morning.  He stretched and yawned, his back cracking as he raised his hands above his head.  He grabbed a quick shower after eating an apple and granola bar and grabbed a pair of faded jeans.  He went to pull them up and button them and found that they were just shy of being able to close.
Cas shook his head and he heard chuckling from the rest of the table.  He looked around to see the older adults smiling.  Only Sam looked a little confused, as if he too had never thought about it.
Dean ducked his head and blushed slightly.  He knew Cas wasn’t upset about it, but he still wasn’t sure if it was ok.  “I should have asked, alpha, I’m sorry,” Dean told him.
feel upset and worried about this conversation.  Dean shifted as he leaned back against the bar and crossed his arms over his chest.  He swallowed uncomfortably and waited.
He looked at Cas and nodded his head.  Cas moved closer from where he was still standing separate from him.  Dean moved over on the bed slightly so that Cas had more room to sit down and he laid his sweaty hands flat on his thighs to stop them from shaking.
Dean rolled his head to the side so he could look at his brother.  “Yea, Sammy, that good.  He’s perfect.  I think he really is my mate.  I’ve never reacted to a scent like that before.  It was a really good night.”
Cas blanched and Dean could tell he was angry about it as well as sick over it.  “No, you didn’t,” he growled.
Cas nodded and relaxed.  Together they were able to maneuver Dean onto his back and into the crook of Cas’ arm.  He rubbed his chin over Dean’s head and brushed his hand over his shoulder.
“I think you’re right, Cas.”  Dean wasn’t sure where this was going.  Was Cas going to suggest a nursing service to come in and help?  Was he going to see if Ellen or Bobby would come and stay?
“Yea,” Sam said.  “I really fucked that one up.  I’m so glad that she knows me so well though, Dean.  If she hadn’t tried to kick my sorry ass into realizing what was going on I would have lost her for sure.  She could tell something wasn’t right.  And I went home that day and told her everything just like I did with you now.  She was upset and pissed doesn’t even cover it, especially since Ruby was never nice to her.”
“That son of a bitch,” Bobby growled.  “I knew we were in trouble but Sam and I couldn’t figure out where the money had gone.  He used cash or cashiers checks and there was no paper trail.”  He pounded his fist on the table.
Dean’s mouth dropped open at the accusation.  Cas meant business today.  Dean wasn’t aware of what Cas was going to say to his mother and he was surprised at his conviction.  If he needed any more proof that Cas was telling him the truth about mating with him then he had it.
“I’m glad you’re here, Dean.  Cas keeps you all to himself too much,” Naomi told him.  Cas rolled his eyes and shook his head.
They exited the elevator and walked across the lobby.  Dean’s nerves skyrocketed but Cas just pulled him close and stopped them before they were at the door.
Sam’s jaw was set and he could scent the anger leaking into the air.  He put a hand on Sam’s shoulder and they looked at each other.  Silent understanding passed between them.  They would do what needed to be done to keep these alphas off the street.  They couldn’t help Dean wherever he was right now, but they could do this for him and to make sure the alphas never hurt anyone again.  Sam nodded and they exited the car.  Jody and the deputy were waiting for them.
“I think it did.  I don’t like that Ruby chick, though.   She seems pretty territorial over a guy who’s married,” he commented.  “But I liked Victor and overall Sam didn’t make a scene, so I’m happy.”
“Dean, Cas wasn’t invited to the planning,” his father told him slowly.  He glanced around before he looked back and Dean.  Dean’s hackles rose.  “He’s not part of the ceremony so he doesn’t need to-”
Dean found that a pattern began.  Cas would get up and go to work.  Dean would loaf around the house and watch TV and read.  He had found a few interesting things he thought he would like to do, but he hadn’t been able to talk to Cas about it.
He felt shaky and sweaty at the thought of doing things for Dean, but he knew it was time to try and figure out what kind of future they could have together.
“Well,” his father sighed when Cas was finished.  “It sounds like you have made some severe mistakes, Castiel.”
“That’s true,” Cas agreed.  He moved back to the fence line they were repairing and Jimmy joined him.  They worked in silence for a few minutes, supporting the beams and replacing the broken ones.
The only people he had told about the pregnancy were Gabe and his parents.  He hadn’t been able to catch up with Anna, but he assumed she knew from his mother already.  He needed to tell Charlie too.  No one but himself could scent it on Dean just yet, but it wouldn’t be long.  It had been a week already.  Dean’s scent would start to change in a few more weeks.
“Alright then.”  She took the brochures out of his hand and set them on the counter.  She filtered through them and withdrew two to hand back to him.  “These have information about the services offered through the school as well as local ones.  Take them and look over them.  There is lots of support for you here Dean.”
“Yea, yea.  Almost.  ALMOST a lawyer.”  Dean was teasing him, but there was nothing but pride in his voice and a smile on his face.  He was so happy for his little brother.
Cas was wearing jeans and one of those sweaters with the big collar and half zipper.  It wasn’t Dean’s style at all, but paired with Cas’ loafers and five o’clock shadow, Dean could definitely appreciate the look.
Cas’ arm came around his waist, solid and secure, squeezing him slightly before answering.  “It was not my intention to spring this on you at school in the middle of the day.”
Dean waved him away.  “Cas needed to know that the pup was safe.  He can’t help his instincts and I won’t deny his wolf that way.  It would hurt us both.  Besides, he hasn’t marked me, so…”
“It’s not good for a pack to have two leaders.  It leads to confusion and problems with loyalties.  I’ve seen it happen before when there are two Pack Alphas.  More than one pack has split like that.  I don’t want that for our pack, son.”
He turned and pulled Dean further into the room and he could practically see the tension and misery in the omega flow out of him.
She clapped her hands together.  “Great!  Alphas or no?  You know, sometimes the scent of an alpha can ease the symptoms, even if it’s a stranger.”
The rest of the day passed and Dean enjoyed the holiday immensely.  He cooked a large meal for everyone and Pete and Amelia showed up right on time to eat and they celebrated into the early evening together.
“You can lie to yourself honey, but you can’t lie to me.  I know you’re still pining.  You’re good at covering it up and you’re good a putting on a happy face, especially for Emma.  But don’t forget that I’ve been helping you through the worst times in your life for most of it and I know something about your scent.  You can’t cover up the longing all the time.”
Dean returned his smile with a small one of his own.  They weren’t anywhere close to the way things should be, but it was a start.  Sam seemed genuinely sorry and Dean had never seen him this remorseful about anything.
Dean rapped his knuckles on the table twice before standing.  “I need to get back to Cas.  I’ll have Benny tell the third squadron to prepare to leave at dawn and I’ll tell Tessa when I see her that she should prepare for omegas and pups in the next few days.”
By midafternoon they had gotten something out from Novak Networks, along with a nice picture of Cas and Dean that Charlie had been able to photograph with her phone.  Dean had put on a nice outfit that Cas bought for him and Cas had dressed up a little too.  They looked like a happily mated couple, Dean’s bite prominently displayed on his neck.
He sighed again.  “So Ruby, the woman I work with I told you about, she and I have worked together on a few projects this year and I kinda got caught up in some of the things she was saying and started thinking like her.  She would say things like how much better I could be doing at the firm if I dressed this way, or took advantage of this situation.   She convinced me that I was better than I was acting and I needed to play the part of the life I wanted.
Dean had pulled on his own shirt and pants by then and he turned around.  “These are fine, Cas.  We can go.”
“You’re welcome, sweetie. Now eat up.  I’m sure there’s pie left, too.”  She winked and left them alone.
Dean didn’t like the idea of staging the outing, but Cas and Charlie both had convinced him it was the best way to do their first outing.  Dean still had a hard time believing that the press in New York City was that interested in him or his mate.  They weren’t celebrities or anything, but Cas told him that money in New York was the key and, like it or not, the media had put a lot of attention on Dean and would probably continue because of the circumstances.  The public was interested in him and until that interest waned, Dean would be popular with the media.
It was a quick trip up to the private ward where they were able to get into the room and Dean was transferred to the larger bed.  Cas was ready to move back beside him when a new nurse came in.
There really was only one option.  He would not leave their punishment up to the government and he would not leave Dean’s family wondering if the alphas would hurt someone else and live without closure.
He pulled up Netflix but paused.  He had been thinking about an Avengers movie, but he stopped himself.  Maybe he’d just find a comedy to watch.  He didn’t want Cas to come out and not sit with him because he was watching an action flick.
Dean smiled down at the omega.  “Thank you for sitting with him,” Dean said.  “You’re welcome to stay.  I’m going to go over a few things that need my attention while Cas is asleep.  Tessa will be up shortly to check on him and talk to me.”
Dean heard Cas’ clothes swish and then his bare ass was exposed as Cas pulled his shorts down.  Dean mentally high fived himself for thinking of changing but that was as far as he got before Cas pulled his cheeks apart and thrust in hard.
I hope the chapter was worth the wait.  Leave me a comment and I promise to get back to you this week.  I love reading all of them!
She pulled out two pouches from inside her pocket.  “This is more willow bark for when he wakes.   Steep if for a few minutes directly in the mug of hot water and he can drink it.”
The pain and longing in his voice was not something Cas was prepared for and not something he wanted to hear ever again.  He remembered the scent of those feelings from the upstairs of the house and he had to hold in a cough, just at the memory.  He was debating whether or not to let Dean know he was there when he spoke again.
Cas seemed to scent that he was nervous and tucked him into the alpha’s side while Jimmy paid for the materials they needed.  Dean relaxed further when Cas rubbed his thumb over Dean’s wrist, marking him.
Cas looked at him and Dean could see his face soften further.  “Why?  What made it so hard?  Didn’t you think about it before?”
He was slowly taking those walls down now and was rediscovering how much he liked being in a relationship with someone.  And he liked having someone take care of him like he liked to take care of them.  Dean was a nurturer by nature, even if he hadn’t seemed like it for a while.  Cas bringing him flowers and taking the time to remember he was trying to stop drinking so much meant a lot to Dean.
“Oh, Cas,” Dean whispered.  He clung to him a bit harder remembering how painful it had been on his end to think that Cas was completely fine without him.  “You did a good job asshole,” he told him without heat.  “So good I thought you didn’t want me.  That was about the time that the pining was getting bad.  And I was pregnant but I didn’t know it yet.  I was a mess.  And then, that’s…that’s when I thought I would let you take the lead and wait for you to call me.”  Dean paused for a moment.  Their scents were clouding, souring together into their shared memories of longing and loneliness.  “And you never did.”
When they got to the door of the cottage Dean tried to stand still and not fidget while his father knocked on the solid wood.  The stable master, Naomi, and her omega had been blessed with a pup a few days before.  As Pack Alpha, his father was there to greet the new member and check on the family.
Cas felt like he was on fire and only Dean could help him.  Every touch sent his nerves tingling, every kiss increased his need.  Cas could feel himself slick as Dean shuffled them back towards the bed.  Their hands were everywhere and Dean’s hot mouth covered his.
have been embarrassing for him, Mom.  He ruined a marriage proposal.  A real one.  I have a ring on my finger.”
“Daphne and I had a short relationship a few years ago.  It was more about scent compatibility and knotting than anything else.  You could call it a fling.  When the attraction waned and we realized that we didn’t want to date, let alone mate, we decided we were better off friends.  We have continued to see each other socially for years, and she’s been my date for many functions that we both were invited to, but that’s all.
Dean sipped his orange juice while Cas worked on the laptop across from him.  They had finished breakfast that Cas had delivered and the alpha was checking the news.  Dean sat quietly, waiting for Cas to finish.
Cas turned to Dean, feeling warm again.  He could tell Dean was a little embarrassed by the story but he didn’t turn away or deflect.
“Enough!” Dean yelled.  “Sam, that’s enough.  You’re acting like a child.  Cas, that’s enough of you too.  Both of you find a seat.”
“I thought I had my handkerchief in my pocket,” he told him as he pulled the pocket up and tried to squint down inside while his hand felt around.  It wasn’t there.  “It’s not here,” he murmured.
“There is a long line of evidence that I have not been a good alpha to you, Dean.  The pictures that day show just how much I had really messed up.  I wasn’t sure what was happening and then they told me it was likely rejection sickness and…it was a wake-up call.”   He shook his head.  “No wonder the police came to interrogate me.  They should have just arrested me on the spot.  There’s plenty of evidence that I’ve-“
The alpha behind him stirred and rumbled and Dean shifted to twist his neck when he felt the twinge of pain.  It was surface pain, like a wound, not something protesting the movement inside his neck.
He decided to take a quick shower to wash off the smell of the shop and get some food.  He quickly showered, changed and was back downstairs staring at his empty fridge in twenty minutes.  There was a bottle of ketchup, a container of Chinese food he couldn’t remember putting in there and a fruit drawer full of beer bottles.
“Cas,” Jimmy admonished him.  Cas glared at him.  Something was wrong with his omega and he wanted to know what was going on.
Dean leaned in and scented him deeply.  Cas bared his neck so Dean would have as much access to his new scent as he wanted.  They lay quietly for a few minutes before Dean pressed a kiss to his mating bite and drew back again.
Cas took a few deep breaths of Dean’s new scent and he felt his alpha rumble.  The vibrations in his chest disturbed Dean and he pulled away with a question on his face.
They had cleaned it up, painted, and moved Dean in the summer before.  Dean had been scraping by in the apartment, but moving in to the house that was already paid for was a miracle.  He had to save for taxes, and there was always something to be done or fixed, like replacing the microwave, but Dean loved it.  He was happy knowing that there was a solid place for Emma to grow up.  She had her own room and there was a yard for her to play in.  She and Dean had shared his one bedroom until they moved here.
“We’ve all known since the first time he talked about you, Dean,” Chuck said.  “He came for dinner and couldn’t stop talking about the guy he met in yoga class who turned out to be one of our junior associate’s brothers.  He gave us every detail of the night you all had dinner and discovered the connection.”
His father and Bobby both agreed.  Dean gave them a wan smile.  He didn’t feel like a very good Pack Alpha so far.  Before he could reply there was a knock on the door.
Cas spent seven days in the campus clinic with the worst rut he’s ever had.  His eyes were ringed red the entire time, his temper was out of control and his physical needs were painful.
He sighed and wandered around the small room.  He thought about how he had been safe and protected here and unconsciously started to count his blessings.  It was easy to get caught up in the worry and the fear about the situation.  It was easy to think about what could go wrong and they spent a lot of time and energy making sure that they kept the secret, but when he stopped to think about it he was eternally grateful for Cas and this cabin.
“Tessa said you needed to bathe and she’s right.  You smell like fear and aggression and you have blood on you,” his mother told him.
He had tried to be brave for Dean.  Cas knew that his friend was happy and excited to go, but he just didn’t want him to.  Cas needed his best friend and it felt like a piece of him was about to ride off away from his body.
Looking at his mate now, he knew that Dean needed a partner who would give as much to him as Dean gave to Cas.  He was struck again at how beautiful his mate was.  Now that he was healthy, his skin wasn’t so papery thin and it glowed slightly from the pup.  Cas couldn’t help but puff up a little at how smug he was with a beautiful mate carrying his pup.  Cas loved Dean’s freckles and his wide smile, but he also loved the way Dean took care of the people he loved and how kind he was to everyone.
Cas suddenly broke the kiss and stepped back.  Dean felt the chill on his front where the air hit him and it helped to clear his head a little bit.
“Sure, Dad,” Dean said in a quiet voice.  He put the bear down on a chair in the entry and moved to go down the hall to the kitchen.  Sam fell in step with him and he could scent the acrid smell of burnt paper.
