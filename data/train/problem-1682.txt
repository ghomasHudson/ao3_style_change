They lay together on the couch, John, with a sleeping Rosie on his chest, with his head resting on Sherlock's belly, as they watch random crap telly. Sherlock is distractedly carding his fingers through John's hair when John asks, "Sherlock?"
“Pink.” John said, suddenly. He didn't know why he said it aloud. It just sort of slipped from his lips as he stared at her with a solemn expression. This had not been what he'd been expecting to do tonight. He thought for sure he'd have been home right now fuming at Sherlock's stupidity over their previous fight if it weren't for their accident. Life threw some strange curveballs at you.
Henry seems completely gleeful to hear that, “Ah, so
Sherlock’s lips twitch around a grin, “Yes, and I rather think you enjoy it – Particularly enjoyed it in the shower this morning,” he teases.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the mention of the name and whispered,“
. Don't stop. Don't you
Sherlock scowls at the phone as if it has greatly offended him. “I’ve told you before, John. I don’t reply,” he whispers, slowly bringing his eyes back to the other man.
“Gray might be a nasty little twerp but at least he’s useful,” Irene comments while she and Sherlock rush about 221B changing out of their costumes and into something more comfortable to attend the club.
“No, Irene demanded it,” Sherlock answers, “I did consider asking my sister but she hasn’t been very stable lately. Keeps going on about how Mycroft let ‘Prince Charming’ maim her canary or… something. Mummy thinks She’s having mixed memories of things she’s done and a children’s cartoon we used to watch involving a princess who sang to animals and was rescued by a prince.”
“John catches him sleeping with someone and his brain melts.”
“Uh, no,” Sherlock took the suit and held it up for John to see, “I'm telling
Sherlock’s nervous laughter would be funny right now, if John weren’t so mad at him. “Ah. Well, I supposed even
HAPPENED MYCROFT?” He shouted as he slammed the door against the wall, “You said you were going to hold it! You
“Mary was interested in international affairs...”(Mary with a couple of international doctors standing outside an embassy), “And so was Harriet,” (Harriet with her shirt pulled up high and two female models on each arm, both kissing her cheeks, one with her hand on Harry's stomach and the other on her thigh, just below her crotch as Harry laughed at the camera posing in front of the Eiffel Tower)
John frowns –
“Oh yeah, she was lovely, really enjoyed her.” John had answered.
Finally, the song’s second chorus is coming to an end. The song key starts changing and Sherlock tags his way into the battle by slipping a hand into Dorian’s waist, allowing the boy to lean back on Sherlock’s body for support while he dances. As he slips slowly down Sherlock’s body, Dorian makes eye contact with John. The kid smirks and keeps eye contact while he reaches up to run his hands tantalizingly over Sherlock's abdomen as he sinks and then moves back up. Before he turns to drift away from Sherlock, he grins and runs his tongue against his teeth, looking up at Sherlock as if he wants to eat him. John glares –
“Welcome back, Doctor Watson,” Irene smirks, waving him and Rosie in and closing the door behind him, “Sherlock’s just upstairs getting dolled up. He’ll be down in a moment.”
“No, Sherlock, I gave you the keys so you could look at them,” John teases.
With that John and Rosie exit and allow Sherlock to change and get himself rightly sorted. Once they leave Sherlock takes a moment to eat a few more bites of the meal John had prepared before rising out of bed and getting changed. He’d fallen asleep with a dress shirt and trousers and they were now decidedly quite rumpled. As he sorts through his shirt drawer for something comfortable he recalls something else he’d stuffed in a drawer. Sherlock’s brow wrinkles at the boldness of the brunet from last night. The note he’d left stabbed to Sherlock’s bedroom door had been hastily crumpled by Sherlock when he’d found it there before he left for Sherringford. He had resolutely stuffed into the drawer of his bedside table with a huff. ‘“Good luck with John,” indeed’ he thinks as he removes his dress mshirt. ‘As if there is even a chance.’ Sherlock rolls his eyes and pulls a t-shirt on over his head and changes into pyjama bottoms. He picks up a piece of left over bacon, stuffs it in his mouth angrily and grabs his now mostly empty tray of food to bring to the kitchen. ‘Stupid perceptive brunet. Stupid perceptive sister. Stupid John. Can’t believe I had to ask the idiot to stay. Of course I want you to stay, moron.’ If there was any truth in this world it was that, that Sherlock would always want John to stay. N
“Brilliant.” John comments, pressing his forehead to Sherlock’s as the other man continues to pant and shudder in the aftermath, releasing their softening cocks and just holding on to one another for support with their other arms.
Irene bites her cheek to keep from smiling. ‘
Sherlock continued to regard John.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock attempts to laugh it off, “Don’t be silly, John, of course he’s–“
“I- how did you?” John stuttered, “Hang on– Have I... done something wrong?”
“...oh...uhh, sure, yeah,” John answered, and then to Mr. Berwick, “Thank you for your... erm time.”
“John?”
hang Mycroft for putting that idea in your head.” Sherlock scowled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure... Alright, hundred and forty - you know what you did – Oi, no!” John yelled at Sherlock (William) as he exited the car with John's cane “He – uh, he's going to be right back, please stay.” John begged the cabby and he clamoured out of the car with his other suit.
?” Her voice raised with every word as she let the anger pour out of her.
“No– What? Why?” Sherlock asked, confused.
For John, he copies the link of Sherlock’s most recent performance, the one Sally had called a Charleston, and pastes it to a message he sends to John with the added caption, “You seen this yet? Apparently, he’s on again tonight.”
Sherlock smiles back the same way, “Shhh, don’t jinx it, John,” he whispers back.
“What?” he asked, distracted.
He sighs and begins to meticulously prepare another bite for Rosie, who waits patiently for him. John sees that Sherlock’s fingers seem to shake a bit and finally takes the utensils away from him, saying, “Oi, you okay?”
“Them’s fighting words, boy,” she says.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wrong, still happily married. It's annoying.”
Sherlock arches his back, stretching his neck in an open display of lust and pants, “Well, are you going to come over here and help me with this or are you just going to stand there and watch?” He lowers his body and looks at John, pupils blown wide and beckons John to him.
“Are they your best man tuxedos?” Sherlock asked, grinning even through his strain.
Someone touches his shoulder and John instantly startles awake, holding onto a thin wrist and breathing heavily.
John, for the first time in a long time you were not just the perfect groomsman!”
No, it doesn't because I had a few plot-holes and beginning notes that ended up going in a completely different direction. Also, um I completely forgot to mention Sherlock using protection earlier so that was... bad. Lol! Whoops! I didn’t mention it but i like to say he did because Sherlock isn’t that careless. The last guy before John though... :/ oops \_(‘-‘)_/ Sawwryy Sherlock. Um I’ll edit it later??? Forgive me, cinnamon roll~~! (in my defence you got to sleep with John and unnamed guy was nice and didn’t give you any diseases so you win in the end. And John loves you. ... don’t hate me. John probably hates me. He’s going to beat me up, I know it.)
“Creepy,” John comments.
alert. I was the minute you told me to help you do this. And even more so when you told me to watch the door. Second, the key word here is
Sherlock preens and grinning rather proudly he states, “You were enjoying it.”
“Anyone else I should know about?” John asked as he sorted through the papers on his lap.
“I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm really not having very much... fun tonight.” John finished, looking towards the bar again.
“Yes. I need you alert. You were in the army, I'm assuming you work well under this sort of pressure.”
“Keep on dreaming Sherlock.” Greg said as Molly rolled her eyes, “Your brother will never approve.”
The brunette is not having it, though, and she huffs, exasperated, “Yeah, sure he does. And you know what, I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t because when you two are in the same room it’s like no one else is in it. Do you know that when he’s around, you act as if I’m not even there?”
John feels his face glow red at Algernon’s suggestion. Yeah, that’s kind of the opposite of what he wants to be doing right now.
“Hm?” Sherlock asks, distracted by Rosie’s babbling, “Oh, Yes, that. It’s in the bedroom. Irene’s using it as a sort-of make-shift beauty table or something. May have to get a new one.”
John blinks, stunned. If Sherlock has been doing this for at least three weeks then how is it possible that none of them has noticed? John is sure that at least one or two of the women at his practice is probably acquainted with the show, and many people know of his association with Sherlock, surely? He’s totally surprised at the fact that no one has bothered to tell him. John’s mind involuntarily reminds him though, that Sherlock doesn’t tell John very many things. He had, after all, disappeared for two years from John’s life, having faked his death, and had never bothered with so much as a small message to let John know he was alive. This was decidedly quite different, seeing as how Sherlock was not faking his death and making anyone mourn him but John still dealt a pang at being excluded from this. He especially felt the upsetting similarity of the fact that Molly knew and hadn’t told him. Well, except she’s told him now. He’d give her points for that.
“Your mother was a romantic.” Sherlock began, “She raised you and your sister with those beliefs. Your father however, was not so kind. In fact, he abhorred the romance she so adored. So much so that he wasn't particularly pleasant to her. You resent him for it. Hate him, in fact. He ruined your mother's perfect happy marriage, like so much poison. Worse. He took her from you when he lost his mind.
Tony nods, eyes still crinkled at Rosie’s responses, then looking to John and Sherlock, grins once more, “I’ll be back soon,” he says and leaves to bring their orders to the kitchen.
In a moment of boldness John winked, “Well, you never know when some 'attractive' journalist is going to coerce you into helping him solve a crime.”
“I’m truly sorry, Watson, but I’ve got to go do a boring grownup chore. I promise I shall be over to dance with you soon, does that sound good, my love?” Sherlock gives Rosie a kiss on the head once more. Rosie pouts but doesn’t argue. Molly feels rather jealous of Sherlock’s secret superpower to get Rosie to behave. If it had just been her trying to get her to do something she didn’t want to do, Rosie would have been screaming her lungs out.
“You sent the note?” John repeated.
what,” he stated.
John frowned slightly but nodded, “Yes.”
“Shewah!” Rosie interrupts, laughing delightedly and reaching for him. Sherlock happily sweeps her up into his arms in response.
“Of course.” Mycroft conceded.
Sherlock's face distorted in shear horror, his hand coming up to his mouth “Dear, GOD, John what
Angelo nods his acknowledgment, but first opens the bottle of wine and pours each of the men a glass. He then punctures the straw in the juice box and passes it to Rosie, who makes grabby hands at it and says “Thank you!” While greedily taking a large sip of the juice through the straw as soon as she gets it. Angelo ruffles her hair in fondness.
attractive–” “–
John thinks as he finally starts to try to move a little differently, trying not to feel self-conscious, and then his sister's voice returns in his head, saying, ‘
“Yes, darling, you were amazing- absolutely fantastic!” John says then, looking to Sherlock, he suddenly has an over-powering urge to stay with him longer, “We should celebrate. Dinner?” John asks.
“Oh, er - no - just - she’s off to Molly’s,” Sherlock answers, finally coming down the stairs, eyes on John the whole way down.
gay. It isn’t a shock. John sort of assumed Sherlock didn’t necessarily care about labels like that (or gender, really) but he never wanted to assume that he had a preference. So,  he’s gay, then. He’s gay and he has fallen in love with a straight bloke. And he’d waited for him but nothing had ever happened between them because this guy, whoever he was, would see Sherlock’s gender as a barrier... John feels a lump in his throat for Sherlock’s sake. It’s a sad situation, but probably not an uncommon one. His heart aches for him. It must be very difficult for Sherlock, to feel like that and not be able to have what he wants. But then John wonders at who it could be. Who in their right mind could be friends with Sherlock and not think he was a great man? Who is it that Sherlock had waiting for all that time? Who is it that Sherlock is actively trying to forget by...?
“No!” Irene Answers while Molly and Lestrade shrug in affirmation, each muttering “yeah,” and “pretty much.” Irene ignores them and shoves two almost identical pairs of Louboutins at Sherlock — “Which ones — these or these?” She asks, lifting each pair to emphasize her question.
There's an abrupt movement beside him and when John turns to look Sherlock is blinking at him rapidly, like the time John had told him that he was his best friend, except this time Sherlock looks impossibly even more dumbfounded. Staring at him, Sherlock just says “... John,” in a blank disbelieving tone.
“Um… bye?” he answers, looking up at the stairs. “Guess uncle Sherlock had a visitor?” John whispers to Rosie as the door clicks shut behind him leaving John and Rosie alone at the foot of the steps.
Sherlock laughs lightly at this, though it’s a miserable little laugh. “No, John. It truly never is.”
I think you'll enjoy this chapter, but it's mostly just a really long conversation that they very desperately need to have, in my opinion.
Molly’s brows knit in confusion. Is Henry lying to her? Is he genuinely upset at the loss of Basil Hallward and hiding it with all this talk of finding him tiresome or did he actually dislike his so-called friend so much? Is it possible that he had murdered Basil Hallward as they suspected? After all, why would Dorian ask
!” Harry finished by bellowing the last insult into the phone then hung up violently and chucked it on the couch next to John as she screeched again wordlessly and began tearing up more of the paper in her hands in frustration. She stomped on it and finally started walking away, crying “I've got to get out of here!
p.p.p.s. I'm getting too attached to the Wilde crew. Particularly Henry and Dorian (no surprise there – they're my favorite evil babies)
“Oh god, John, yes,
John frowned and his previous joyful expression fell instantly, “You don't get it. Of course you don't, why would you?”
“Oh no way he's got soooo fat, it'll just throw off the aesthetics.”
John smiled fondly at him, “Let's just get back to the reception, Sherlock, come sit down.”
Ah. He was going to sloppily disguise this to look like Sherlock had gotten drunk and driven himself into a rock. How he expected to hide the bullet wound was beyond Sherlock. It was probably just to give himself enough time to run anyway. It wasn't long before Sherlock saw his car just where he and John had left it earlier stuck in the mid from their little accident.
“I'd like to take a moment to give a special thank you to a certain man, who really went above and beyond,” Bill began...
“Do you know who did it?” The man next to her asked.
“I remember
John’s grip on him loosens then and he lets Sherlock go only to grip his waist and flip him around to face John again. He grabs Sherlock’s hands and pushes him in a clumsy cha-cha step, attempting to copy the motions Sherlock had made in one of the first videos John had seen him dance. Just as the chorus of the current song picks up he spins Sherlock as he had done in the living room. This time though, Sherlock spins quickly and smoothly, without the hindrance of holding a baby in his arms, and having to be careful, keeping him from being graceful. He pulls himself back in and crashes face-forward into John, who laughs and takes Sherlock’s hands again. Sherlock leads him in a few steps back before allowing John to spin him again. John grips Sherlock’s hips again when they come together. This time while they dance, John still keeps Sherlock’s hips at a distance from his own, but his thumbs move up to graze beneath Sherlock’s loosened top, touching just a bit of skin and making Sherlock shiver. Behind him, Sherlock feels Gladys and Dorian coming in closer. He’s guessing it’s about time to end the dance as a team, though he is feeling reluctant to let go of John, case be damned. He spots Algernon and Jack cheering John on from their side, also coming together to join him. Sherlock doesn’t really want it to be over, but he allows the slight tug from his teammates to pull him away from John anyway, knowing Irene wouldn’t forgive him if he put the case in jeopardy. Algernon and Jack surprise Sherlock, however, and instead of the teams dancing against each other, each of the opposing men takes ahold of one of Sherlock’s team members. Sherlock sees Dorian’s eyes widen at the choice as well, because they know that the moment John had chosen to touch Sherlock, he had broken one of the few strictly-after-party-dance-battle rules – don’t touch the opposing team member. While it would have been alright for John to do it, since he didn’t know the rules, Algernon and Jack did. By choosing to grab onto Sherlock’s teammates they had forfeited the battle to Dorian’s team.
John is about to lean in when Sherlock’s phone makes a very familiar text alert noise, and John freezes. His eyes transform into ice chips and in a flash the moment is gone. It’s a text from The Woman.
John returned from the kitchen with two mugs of tea. Sherlock was sitting cross-legged on the floor when he came in, surrounded by serviette opera houses.
them, right?” Sherlock asked, his voice clearly conveying how astounded he was at the concept of keeping this many horribly cheesy tuxedos. “You have a whole closet's worth, John, why?”
Once he has, John nods and Sherlock goes on, “We entered strictly come dancing because Irene had heard a rumor about some companies being owned by a Hal Ward that might have a hand in producing the show. We looked into them more closely once we were actually entered in the competition but so far we can’t seem to find if Hallward is even real.” Sherlock leans back, putting down his eating utensils for a moment and running a hand through his artfully styled curls, messing them up a bit in frustration, “Irene basically bribed a real professional dancer to allow her to assume her identity for this and then blackmailed some people to get her on. Getting me on was slightly less difficult. She apparently only needed to make a suggestion to the right person.”
John laughed, and seemed about to speak when the nurse from before – the one who had squealed at John and glared at Mycroft walked up to them looking a little nervous and a little curious, “Mr. Holmes, I'm told that William can see you now. He's asleep, just now, but the danger is over. He'll wake up soon enough.”
He thought.
“What's him being promoted to investigation got to do with me?” John finally asked.
“Alright, I've got a deal for you. I'll give you three hundred pounds flat for the whole night, with a couple of conditions, you don't freak out and you don't look in the rear-view mirror or I deduct, got it?”
Eurus eyes him carefully. “I know you’re laughing, idiot. I meant why are you upset?”
The man rolls his eyes slightly in fondness and waves shyly at John and Rosie as they enter 221B while he makes his way to the exit. “Bye.” He mumbles.
(I say this as if I don't have the power to add hilarity... in my defence this story has a mind of its own and 90% of this plot is not mine)
I am lazy.
“No good?” She asked.
shoves him against the door. He practically chokes the man with his tongue as he kisses him. His visitor melts in his arms, groaning at Sherlock’s enthusiasm.
Eventually Sherlock’s nerves calm a bit and his body relaxes as they sit in silence, just being there for each other. And that’s actually rather nice. They both unconsciously move closer to each other, Sherlock silently sharing his blanket and John accepting is as they concentrate on the movie.

“Let's just say we both work the wedding circuit, so...” Sherlock explained.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Claudia snivels at Sherlock – or at least that’s what Irene is calling it – and the woman comes over and takes him into her arms as if they were close friends, “Come here my darling,” she continues, her soot-covered eyes closing as she holds Sherlock close and croons “I’m so sorry about those results, my dear, really sorry.” She pulls away and hugs Irene next. Irene feels her body twitching with fury and the desire to just toss this woman away from her.
Iris looks to him and then looks to Molly. Finally, she rolls her eyes and waves her hands up in exasperation, “Fine!” She says, her accent adding to the apparent annoyance she feels at letting Sherlock do as he pleases, “Fine, do as you like!”
“Yes... was that... okay?”
John smiled and continued to update her on the things she'd missed on her trip and had left John in charge of, “Mrs. Hudson's had her hip x-rayed, I just want to give you her updated progress sheet. Seems fine for now but you might want to have her come in again next month, since she's getting on in her years. You've got some returning patients, Mrs. Turner and her son, coming in for an appointment at eleven and Bart's called asking if you'll be attending the benefit. I left the number on your desk but if you'd like... Should I call them back and let them know you're attending?”
“Just don't listen to him. Besides we all know who the bigger man is, between the two of you, if you know what I mean.” Harry winked.
“Murder on the knees, isn’t it?” John asks him over the song just as Rosie turns to her father for attention.
He questions himself as soon as he sends it. Why had he assumed that Sherlock had meant dinner just between the two of them?
“Will you just SHUT-UP?!” John asked, driving faster.
Omg I can write both end and beginning notes! Yusss!
That causes John to explode into a fit of giggles, which in turn makes Sherlock laugh as well. “Oh, Sherlock,” John breathes, “I love you, you mad bastard.”
When they get upstairs Dorian drags Sherlock to the bar to order a round of drinks for the four of them.
“Shit!” John let go of Sherlock, but it was too late, the car was spinning out of control on the road and no matter which way John turned the wheel or how hard he slammed the breaks the car was
Jack pats him on the back and leans close so John will hear him, “I’m a professional — Gladys and Algy are both actors. Algy has potential but he’s almost too confident. Gladys is okay but she’s still got a lot to learn. Do you dance at all Doctor Watson?”
“Women wore suits, men wore dresses.” John explained through his hysterics.
John nodded his thanks and jogged his way to Mike “Alright, mate, hey, hey, I'm here. What's going on? What's wrong?” He asked calmly, grabbing the man's forearm in a friendly gesture.
John smiled, “I guess so... Mary, before we go anywhere I just wanted to apologize for the other night. What I did... it was wrong. I shouldn't have said it like that–”
“Now, now everyone, we all just need to take a deep breath and calm down.” Sherlock said, loudly and theatrically, moving his hands in a placating gesture to emphasize what he was saying. What was he doing? The whole bar could hear him!
He opens up his laptop and plugs in some head phones, then lies on the couch with the machine balanced on his legs while his upper body is propped up with two couch cushions by the arm rest. He taps Sherlock’s name with the words “hit dance competition” into the search query and is immediately bombarded with gossip articles and links to videos.
Greg shakes his head, answering loudly, “No! She’s upstairs in VIP with Sally and that Henry guy – we snuck Sally in earlier with one of Molly’s new friends from the make-up crew – I didn’t want to risk leaving her alone in case Sherlock buggered off somewhere!”
” the woman sings through the speaker.
doing here?”
“John,” She gasped, and then gestured at Mary.
“Normally you'd be ecstatic.” Anthea commented. “A little gratitude wouldn't be remiss.”
“So what's your theory then?” John asked as they got closer to the pub.
“Oh,” Molly blushes slightly, marveling at how similarly to Sherlock this man speaks and – she mentally shuts down that though, actually, because she is not doing this again. Yes, this man is handsome, yes he sort of talks like Sherlock, no Molly will not develop an immediate crush, “Er… yes, my friends said they’d let me know how they’re doing, but I guess they’re fine…”
life that is insane. What do you do other than work at that clinic and help people marry one another?”
When he finally reaches them, Sherlock surprises John by throwing his arms around him, “John,” he half-yells into his ear, “So glad you came.”
John smirks, “You know I think it does,” he agrees, putting on a false thoughtful look to mess with Sherlock, even if he had thought the same thing about Dorian only moments ago.
you been telling him?”
Josh finally looks over to John, as if noticing him for the first time and laughs nervously (and whether that’s because John is shooting daggers at him or because he feels guilty for not noticing him sooner, John isn’t sure) saying, “Oh, my, yes of course. So nice to meet you, Sir, I’m an… acquaintance of Sherl-lock’s,” he fumbles over Sherlock’s name, his eyes shifting to Sherlock for guidance, as if he were about to call him ‘Sherls’ again, and that just makes John want to punch him more.
“They were all still too stiff. Had to give the suspect a chance to 'escape.'” Sherlock said then.
Rosie looks between the two of them and begins to fuss. John is still fuming and looking at anything but Sherlock. The detective stands abruptly and picks up the squirming toddler, “Come on, darling.” Sherlock says to her, gently, “let’s go put an order in for some food for you.”
Sherlock attempts to breeze by it as if he hadn’t noticed, “Oh, no, don’t worry, Watson, you have me all to yourself today. The Woman is off at Molly’s.”
Mary smiled, “Well, it's very nice to meet you, miss...”
“Oh, yes, Sherlock because weddings are the perfect place to forget that you're
“Oh it’s quite simple, really,” Algernon assures John, “especially if you use Dorian’s strategy. Don’t worry about everyone else in the room – not even your dance adversary. What you want to do is shut your eyes and picture yourself having sex. Move your body the way you would to hit that sweet spot when you make love. Sherlock is a good dancer, but his weakness is that he’s very technical. If you go at him with things he doesn’t expect he gets shy. It’s how Jack beat him the last time we had a dance battle. Just do something he wouldn’t expect. It’s bound to throw him off long enough to maybe get us a win. Plus, I’ve seen him downing drinks like a mad-man tonight. With any luck, he’s drunk enough to be clumsy.”
John moans and seeks it out. Come here, he wants to say, but he finds his mouth can’t form the words and all he can do is continue groaning in displeasure for the lack of contact.
And so the three of them get changed (Rosie with some help from John and from the copious drawers of adorable little outfits Sherlock has purchased for her), and make their way to the restaurant where they spend a happy calm evening eating until they’re stuffed. When John and Rosie finally go home, it’s dark out and Sherlock is filled with so much warmth after seeing them that as soon as he arrives in 221B he crawls straight to bed and falls right asleep with a smile on his features. Today was a good day and now he knows exactly what song to write for Eurus next.
there. That's why I go.”
“Yeah except that suit. I mean, lace, frills, powder blue...?” Harry scrunched up her nose.
“Look, when you brought me to the clinic after Afghanistan I was grateful, and I was blown away by you, and your abilities. I got so caught up in it, in order to distract myself from the pain I was feeling, that I never actually bothered to get past them and get on with my own life. And then I guess I was too comfortable to leave which is when, of course, I realized I had to be there every day to see you because I was so madly in love with you.” John closed his eyes, laughing a little at his final admission.
read.”
-Journal! I'll tear him apart, I swear!” She emphasized this by ripping parts of the paper to shreds, letting the pieces fall to the ground like snowflakes, “I'll tear his stupid skinny body up limb from limb.”
John rolls his eyes and steals the soap.
Molly jumps slightly at the address from him, surprised that the man is speaking to her, if it is her he’s speaking to, “Sorry?” She asks softly, looking at him in confusion.
“Who?” John asked
John swallows. Was this happening? Were they going to do this now? Please, God, let them do this now. John doesn’t care about Sherlock’s boyfriend. The thought of Sherlock with someone other than himself is suddenly unbearable -
Eurus tilts her head, “You liked glass. It made you laugh.”
Dimock looked out the window and saw another flash of lightning crack through the sky. “Alright,” He finally conceded, “but here,” He handed Sherlock a pair of keys, “It's for my motorcycle. It's parked 'round back. I'll go with Carter.” Sherlock made a grab for them, and DI Dimock looked at him before he relinquished them, “It's a little ways off from here, farther up the road towards the other said of town, almost facing the country. Do be careful Mr. Scott, I know you've been drinking.”
“Oh. There's always something.” Sherlock frowned,
John inspected a very curious chip on a near-by glass.
“Me? Why?” Carter asked, immediately lifting his head to look at Sherlock.
seeing him in his element, but also just a little incredible. This man contrasted so much with the man who had been all smiles and smirks with him in the pub, but it was still the same person. It was
The director indicates that the next dancers are ready and Claudia continues, “Alright, darlings, you can keep us posted during the week with me on It Takes Two, and for the audience at home: don’t forget to vote for your favorite couple - you know where to go!” she signs off as the cameras in front of them are switched off. “Well, I’ll be back in a minute, play nice children,” Claudia comments as she makes her way over to the make-up artist just behind the curtain to powder her nose.
“What’s going on?” Greg asks them with a smile as he turns the corner.
Sherlock huffs, “I’m clean. I promise.”
A few minutes later Sherlock’s handsome brunet exits the bathroom and with a fond expression removes the note after reading it. “Your clothes are in the front hall and living room. Don’t worry about the locking up when you go. -SH” it reads. Of course. The brunet recalls how the older man had cried out another man’s name last night as his pleasure had peaked and he kisses the note softly. He had expelled it with such longing. He really couldn’t find it in himself to be angered. He’d stayed, knowing the other man had needed this, but he could never have predicted that he’d catch a glimpse of the person he had been standing in for. He pads his way over to the living room and hall to collect and put on his clothes. He looks around the desk for a second until he finds what he’s looking for. Picking up a pen and paper he writes a note himself and after he’s fully dressed stabs it to the door of the room he (correctly) assumes to be his host’s. With that done the man follows his host’s instructions and leaves, not bothering with the locks on the doors.
, if she considers his admission to be romantic. It isn’t romantic. His suffering over her isn’t cute. He could die. Sherlock was much more vulnerable a person in heart than he let on. The very idea that he might feel like this, like he needs to get high to escape the pain of missing someone he so dearly loves – it sickens him. As the last notes of the song end, John opens his eyes to see a scene of the woman sitting on the coffee table looking back on Sherlock, who lies again on the couch in the same position he had started the song in. John feels involuntary tears in his eyes.
But! How did I know it was
John huffs out an exaggerated breath, “Figures,” he says, in a light tone.
Sherlock gives her a pleased little smile and offers, “Ah yes, thank you, that’s all thanks to the efforts of a friend.”
John's mother looked from John to the door, “John...?” She asked. “You alright dear?”
This chapter is a whole clusterfuck of events... well... kinda. It was hard to write for some reason. I've barely done much editing on this one because it was a fuckin' doozy. I hope you guys like it though. I tried. ;-; I swear there is a plan. I promise.
“You!?” Harry exclaimed, crumpling up a section of the paper hysterically, “You!? He called me
John turned to look and couldn't help the amused smile on his face as he registered who it was. Standing there in the doorway was none other than William Scott smiling in his long Belstaf coat and blue scarf as he clapped, his eyes completely focused on John.
John really can’t tell if he’s being serious, “... Sherlo- really?! Greg Lestrade??” He asks, and he almost laughs at Sherlock’s expression as he bodily turns towards John in shock at his question. “Lestra-!” Sherlock exclaims, “Wait -
John looked at her expectantly.
__________
She’d danced happily the whole time he played and when he’d finished she’d played a song for him in return. “I love you.” It said. “I love you so much I can’t stand it.” The song was so beautiful it had almost made him weep. It was sad, and confused and so full of a longing for forgiveness and affection but wild and destructive at the same time. Eurus felt so strongly that she didn’t know what to do with herself. It was heartbreaking. Sherlock understood all too well. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” He’d promised, encouraged to come see her again by her song.
Sherlock only nods in answer.
“Yes, well, elementary, my dear Watson.” Sherlock replied, giving John a wink.
“John.” He says, breaking away from their kiss, “John take your clothes off.” He breathes.
“Mm nothing.” John replies, but he can’t control the slightly husky rasp to his voice, or his flirtatious little smirk as he says, “Just enjoying the moment. You, all quiet like this. It’s rare.”
Jack Worthing, a professional dancer, joins Sherlock and Dorian. “Be careful with them, though, they’re deadly,” he comments, eyeing Dorian with what looks like amusement as the boy pulls a bartender over to make an order. He leans over the counter to speak to the bartender then turns back around. He says, smiling mischievously, “Don’t listen to Jack. He’s no head for the happy juice.”
William turned his glittering eyes reluctantly from John then and directed his sight to Mary and Harry, his expression going a little more professional, “Sherlock Holmes,” He introduced himself, shaking Harry's hand.
Though not in that order. The title is slightly misleading. ;)
John smiled a little at the memory of those words.
They enter into the crowded building pushing through a variety of different people. There seems to be some kind of coat-check area, which they bypass to move into where the main party is going on. John is surprised to see how packed the place is, despite how spacious the building appears. Its high ceiling is almost invisible from the ground, the dim lighting above making it appear as if it’s an endless shadow with floating colourful jets of light that beam down onto the dance floor but do very little to provide clear views. The strobes move with the beat of the music making it difficult to concentrate on any one detail.
“Ahhh,
Sherlock flops back on the couch and for a long time he says nothing, an arm thrown haphazardly over his eyes, repeating the motion from earlier in the day. There’s a slight grimace on his face, as if the conversation pains him when he finally admits, “I did.”
“You’ll do great.” Molly encourages.
“Ah, yes, well, thank you...” John looked to the man, noticing he didn't know his name.
“Sherlock is very determined and headstrong,” The heavily Russian accented voice of Iris speaks, “but this is a good thing because I am a very demanding teacher. He said a few weeks ago that he was worried that he would be a difficult student but I’ve found him to be a pleasure to teach. What he is, and it’s evident from last week’s performance and practice - is a perfectionist. He does not stop until he has it perfect, and that is the only thing he needs to work on. It is not that I think he should stop practicing as hard - him working like this is the reason that I believe we will win, but he does need to loosen up a little bit. This is very important. This week we dance a Salsa, and he needs to really free himself, free his body. He needs to allow himself to feel that desire, touch that sensual part of himself that he showed us a peek of last week. He also needs to learn to take a little bit more time for breaks. I don’t want my champion in making to burn himself out before we reach our prize. Yes, this is what I hope he will do this week.” While she speaks the screen flips between clips of Sherlock dancing with her last week, Sherlock sweating in the studio and Iris trying to push him to take a break and relax. There are also clips of them missing a twirl or a step and Sherlock growling in frustration only to break out into laughter when Iris pokes his side, reminding him to relax. Finally, when her interview is over the screen switches to the dimmed view of the stage. The silhouettes of Iris and Sherlock can be seen far apart from one another, Sherlock and Iris each sitting at a table on opposite ends of the stage. Sherlock’s silhouette appears to be reading a newspaper and Iris rests her hand on her chin as the slow steady beat of a vaguely familiar American pop song begins.
“Oh, very, very much.” John replies instantly, grabbing hold of Sherlock’s hand to play with his fingers, “And someday you will let me know who I have to thank for teaching you
“Oh... I'm...erm...that is...” He stammered, then frowned slightly, “Those things will kill you, you know.” He said gesturing at the cigarettes. He backed up into the club a bit, “Right... well... carry on.”
“Yup- Bye!”
“T's okay” The little boy answered.
attractive, don't you?–”
Sherlock had calmed himself. His next words had been spoken quietly and very gently, “Irene, if this is going to work, if we’re really going to work on this case together, but most importantly if you really need my help, you need to let me in. You need to trust me.”
John swallowed, “Why...? Why would you want to be like me when you get to be... you.”
“You know I have to.”
Dimock went out with him to wait in the car while fred arrived and to grab a police radio for John and Sherlock.
Sherlock felt his eyelids flicker and a bright light flashed heavily above him. He shut his eyes instinctively and tried again. As his eyes opened again, slowly this time, the room he was in came in to view and all the sounds around him suddenly rushed into his ears. He heard the stable beep-beep-beeping of his heart beat monitored on a machine, and saw that he was in a white hospital room with a woman (presumably a nurse), his brother Mycroft looking particularly disheveled, and John Watson looking particularly beautiful even with the look of nervous worry in his eyes.
“Sherlock,” he says in a worried tone as he pulls away from him in hesitation.
The camera angles away from the pair and a group of six women are seen standing nearby, all dressed identically under a spot light. The crowd cheers again. The camera pans back on Sherlock as he says, “Oh I’ve some idea but I‘d rather not spoil the fun.” He grins mischievously.
He fiddled with the buttons on Sherlock's damp purple top, “Off!” He grumbled.
. His mind supplies once more. Of course, John always knew he’d found Sherlock to be objectively handsome, pretty even – but he’d never quite actually – that is, his mind had never supplied such sensual images of him before and he’d certainly never admit it, even to himself. But now… it’s like that video of Sherlock on the dance floor had opened up this window in John’s mind that had previously been vehemently shut. Sure, John would wonder about Sherlock’s romantic life, and yes he’d been… curious but well, he’d sort of mostly given up on thinking of Sherlock as anything even remotely sexual when Sherlock had said, uncomfortably, “
“Who'r you then?” The man asked.
even, to be planning their wedding with them. Like I have been for every wedding that I've been a part of, but you – you don't understand that because you're – you're a
John watches with barely disguised fury as Sherlock places a hand at the small of the man’s back and ushers him over to the bar. Once they get there Sherlock speaks first to a barista standing behind a counter and orders, presumably, the beverages he is clearly using as a pretext to talk to this “Josh” fellow. John seethes as predictably, Sherlock turns to Josh and whispers to him urgently. Josh looks like a deer in headlights as he nods along until finally they both laugh nervously. Sherlock says something else to him and then Josh hands Sherlock his notepad and a pen – and Sherlock smiles and says something else before he very quickly scribbles something onto the little book. John can’t see what Sherlock has written, but his deductive skills have increased exponentially since returning to more regular adventures with Holmes and John just knew that what Sherlock was writing down was a bloody phone number. Josh pats Sherlock on the back and scuttles away to the back, hopefully to do his goddamn job.
John tilts his head in challenge, “Hmm, I think I could find away…”
Harry's yelling and John's reverie were interrupted by the ringing of John's home phone. John made no move to stand up and Harry turned, exasperated to pick up.
“Yes, terribly unfortunate, also, no one cares.”
,” he’d said. He should be happy for him… shouldn’t he? But he just can’t fight this feeling of foreboding… of wrongness.
John breathes him in, “Good,” he says, “that’s good,” then giggles, staring again, “god, I’ve really been such a moron haven’t I?”
“Oh brilliant idea Johnny!” He exclaimed, seeing the flower in John's hands, “You've certainly saved the day, here, pin it on me, why don't you?” Len smiled as he bent down on one knee and allowed John to remove the pocket square and replaced it by pinning the pink flower onto the pocket, the stem, tulle and leaves covering right over the stain.
“Good,” he said, then pulled away and added, still quietly, “Someday, I'd like to hear the story of why you even had it in the first place.”
“Shut-up.” Finally, standing up straight, Sherlock takes mercy on Molly and gives Iris a light pinch on the shoulder, “Let go of her, you tart. Sorry about her Molly - she’s a shameless harlot.”
“Heyyy,” John answered nervously, “Yup, yeah, just... doing a little tidying up, you know, here and there.”
“DI Dimock this is DI Scott's Colleague, Dr. John Watson. DI Scott has been compromised and we are in need of back up, I repeat, we need back up, Over.”
Harry stopped struggling then and narrowed her eyes at John. He let go and she rubbed at her wrists, as she spat, “Oh please John, get off your high horse, and just admit it, you resent me because you were the one who always had to dress my injuries, and take me out on halloween and practice with me for my sports games and helped pay for my dress for the school formal.”
“But still, there's someone.” Sherlock stated. How Sherlock could tell was beyond John.
---------------
John giggled a little, “Sure, why not?”
“No, no one.” John agreed and smiled at her, the weight on his chest feeling slightly lifted. Good old Mary. She always knew what to say.
Guys I want you to know that my notes for this chapter were as follows:
“What the

John blinks. He was sure Sherlock has caught him checking guys out before. He must have done, mustn't he? Nothing gets past him does it? And John had never really been good at hiding his adoring looks at Sherlock, hard as he might try. Apparently he was better at hiding it than he thought. Finally he asks, “What evidence?
right now.”
Sherlock was actually stunned then, “You knew I was Sherlock Holmes? How?” How could he possibly have known that then?
Sherlock’s neck goes a little scarlet but his face is impassive when he asks, “Problem?”
John gave her a tight lipped smile, but stood and hugged her none-the-less. “No, no, Harry of course I don't mind. I'm sure it'll suit you very well.”
on a case.”
John gaped. The fucking nerve of that guy, was he fucking serious? He turned the page back to the page with William Scott's number and dialled it immediately.
“5-3, 3-2, 8-1, 7-4, 4-1, 6-3, 3-1, 2-1, 6-2, 4-3,6-2, 4-1: 53.816515, - 3.055896,” the message reads.
Sherlock glares but he asks in a soft voice, “You aren’t angry—?”
John laughed, “Why do you assume we're not both the grooms? And who knows... I might marry a woman. I'm bisexual, Mary.”
Josh is the only boy i named (and i named him Josh so that Sherlock wouldn't get in trouble when he made J- and Jo- noises while gettin it on) that Sherlock slept with and I couldn't just leave him hanging with no text reply. He and the second guy Sherlock slept with in the story that I didn't name - are officially dating now, and yes, the guy's anme starts with J, like Josh's because I needed something for Sherlock to write on the paper and I thought it would be funny if I continued with the theme of Sherlock's lovers having J names. But yes, everyone gets a happy ending! Woo!
Stupid movie. Stupid Johnlock. Stupid sentiment! Stupid fluff. I hate you. I want more hilarity. >:(
you–”
Sherlock’s eyes glitter with fondness at the thought, “Possibly as soon as she learns to say it.”
Don't hate the plagiarizer, hate the original script. :P
When Sherlock returns to the living room John is already putting Rosie down on the carpet with a few toys and placing her bag on the coffee table. “Watson,” Sherlock greets them, “smaller Watson.”
Irene had said, “
believe that senseless prattle doesn't mean
“Really?” John asks, “And you really aren’t... I dunno, doing this for a case or something?”
asking after you,” he winks, mock-whispering conspiratorially, “I’ll let you have a drink or two before I text him to come up and fetch you. I know he can be a handful, with his virile youthful energy keeping him so full of life.”
John ran his fingers on the scraps of fabric of the little table. The suit had been ruined beyond repair. He picked up a piece of what looked like the sleeves and felt his eyes sting in pain while Harry turned and chattered away with the seamstresses.
Week 3: Quickstep – Come Back to Me: Frank Sinatra
to hear his own voice.”
Sherlock laughed and leaned further in–
John read the title on the brochure “St. Audrie's Park?”
“Yeah.” John agreed.
(And since today is February,14 2020 - HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!)
someone killed her?”
“No she's Greg's Sherlock's best man,” Irene clarified, “There's two of us, one for John and one for Sherlock. Harry's John's maid of Honour. Speaking of ”
Sherlock raised a brow and turned back to the closet, taking a step forward and his eyes dancing in glee, “Are those what I think they are?”
“Yes sir.” The cab driver answered and did his best to speed him there.
be wasting flat space like that in London.”
Molly hesitates, unsure if she should reveal John’s identity. Then again, the man is clever, and he’ll likely find out on his own. “He’s not that much older than me,” Molly says.
“Guess I just forgot who I was talking to.” John stated and an awkward silence fell between them. After a moment John stood. “I should... er... I should clean this up,” he said, silently standing to put his tuxedos away.
“That kid really has a thing for you, eh?” Greg observes.
“Loser buys the next round!” Algernon shouts at Dorian.
Dimock laughed, “I'm sure it'll be fine, the yard will cover it.”
“Oh, that’s not too bad. The middle is when they start to get good anyway,” she says, just as the screen goes dark after the current dancers have finished being critiqued.
Sherlock stared, this was suspiciously easy. Mycroft raised a brow, “Back to work, then Sherlock,” He said, ushering him out.
He finally buzzes the button on the intercom, requesting his next patient.
Sherlock and John still don't talk to each other.
“Fuck Sherlock,
“Okay?” John was stunned, was this really happening? “It was great!”
Sherlock looks so sad, his panting breaths barely evident. Finally, the audience explodes into cheering and he seems to shake himself free. He stands and his partner runs back out from behind the beads to join him by the hostess’ side. Sherlock now has a broad grin on his face and so does Iris. John can’t help but feel like he’s seen that grin somewhere before, but he can’t place it. He watches as the show hostess speaks to the judges, asking their opinions on Sherlock’s performance.
“Like it was made for you,” Harry beamed.
Rosie nods in approval, and says, “Good. Now we dance?”
Sherlock's eyes looked confused as he gave John a look of denial.
At the end of the night, for both weddings (different times of course) cake was served and the Bride and Groom got up to say their thanks to their guests. Both the grooms made similar speeches which melded together in John's memory because of their similarity.
. He’d
“John– John let me explain–” he tried, bringing his hands out for the paper again.
Dorian smacks him lightly and laughs once more, but he gives up on talking to his friends temporarily as he returns to the bar and orders Sherlock the promised lighter cocktail. Victoria comes to stand beside him, looking more interested in the future events and Dorian orders something for her and Henry as well. Henry extends a hand to Sherlock, “A pleasure, detective,” he shouts slightly in the introduction.
“MmmmHmmm. What do you say? My game then your game?”
Molly attempts to hide her smile at his retort. She’s figured out by now that Henry is the type of person who always has to have the last word so she doesn’t address the question. Instead, she nods her head at the people below, “You really know all these people?” She asks him the question with the knowledge that it’s unlikely he’ll answer it. So far, Henry has rarely answered any of her questions — choosing instead to turn every opportunity to talk in some great philosophical epithet. She asks him more to try and stir up the conversation, and because, occasionally it either throws him off or seems to annoy him. Yet with every jab she makes at him, the more he seems to want to stay around her. He’s probably a masochist. If he is, Irene would probably be proud of her.
. I delete things that aren't important.”
John gives Sherlock a light smack on the knee, “It’s not what you’re thinking, you tit. I’m trying to say... Before I saw... you. I- I was here to talk to you –“
and even that
Mycroft hesitated, “Sherlock, I need you covering weddings. You are embarrassingly good at it, and despite that,
“Why indeed?” Sherlock said, more to himself than anyone in particular.
“Okay, good, yeah, right, because you know, we... haven't really had that kind of relationship before so I just wanted to make sure you were okay with it.”
“In her defence she didn't know I had feelings for Mary. She's my boss. I'm just going to have to get over it. I don't really have a choice... and neither do you by the way...” Irene looked at John questioningly as they switched from downward facing dog to warrior, “She wants you to be her bridesmaid.”
As they sat in silence while the adults walked around chatting with on another Harry and John held hands and stayed put, deciding not to run around with the other children, not wanting to cause their mother any sort of grief today. Little Harry, however had more difficulty understanding mum's pain and finding herself already bored and uncomfortable in the tall wooden pews she tried to find an excuse to get up and stretch her legs for a bit. The bride was taking too long anyway. It was then that she spotted a little boy, cousin Malcolm, it looked like (harry couldn't quite remember since she didn't get to see half these children very often), drinking what looked like a glass of orange juice. Suddenly Harry's throat felt very dry. She wanted some juice too. Harry looked from John to her mother. She remembered John telling her earlier 'You mustn't bother mummy today, she's a little upset because she misses dad, so if you need something, just ask me, okay?' So Harry turned to John and whispered, “Pssst! John! I'm really thirsty.” John's mother heard, of course, and made to get up, but John stood up quickly and held a hand forward to stop his mother, “It's okay mum, I can handle it.” He said, “C'mon Harry, this way.”
? How had he not been able to see it? Sherlock had jumped off a rooftop to save his life. Sherlock had shot a man who threatened John’s life with his wife. Sherlock had let Mary shoot him and still supported John’s marriage and love for her, even though he’d almost fucking died when she’d done it. Sherlock had put himself through hell with Culverton and taken a beating from John and blamed himself for the death of John’s wife - for John’s grief. John had almost lost him then, and again when Sherlock had fought Eurus and almost killed himself, just so he wouldn’t have to choose between the lives of two people that he loved. John was an absolute moron for not seeing it, and right now he decides that he will spend the rest of his life letting Sherlock know how much he adores him.
"I want to hold you closely, look you in the eyes, see you next to me,"
And John is like: ... oh.
because Bride-zilla's on the loose!” With that she stormed out of the flat, slamming the door in her wake.
John said nothing. So
you?!”
“Yes, that’s right, it does go ‘ding’,” John answers with a light chuckle. She raises her arms expectantly and he moves to pick her up. He takes her with him into the bedroom where he finds the screen of his phone lit with Sherlock’s name and his photograph flashing above the message in a little circle.
Oh his heart. His poor heart. Sherlock weeps for the state of it and how Eurus plays its tune so well, despite not understanding its plight. It must be suffering greatly, if even
“Mmm,” Sherlock agrees.
Molly smiles as Tess and Claudia introduce this year’s new addition of professional dancers, the stage exploding with the glitter and glamour of the big musical number that will bring them to the stage. There’s a new male dancer from Spain, a fit young man with blonde hair and two elegant women, one tall with long red wavy curls and one of about average height with short blond hair and hazel eyes. The three look absolutely stunning as they spin onto the stage, dancing to a pumped-up modern version of a song Molly thinks is called ‘Sway’. She watches with admiration as the graceful dancers on the screen put up an amazing performance and subconsciously wiggles her shoulders to the rhythm. It’s a shame she can’t turn up the volume for fear of waking Rosie. Were she home alone Molly would probably be dancing along unabashedly. With a glance in the direction of her bedroom Molly slowly gets up to creep over and shut the door a little. She returns to the living room to grab the baby monitor while she wanders over to her kitchen in order to grab a snack while she watches the show. She can’t really hear what’s going on on the telly right now, but she figures she should grab a snack now before she misses anything more. She places a bag of popcorn into the microwave and waits patiently until it’s done. From there she quickly grabs a bowl, pours her snack into it and rushes back to the living room, baby monitor under her arm while she passes by her chair, stealing the throw blanket on it so she can snuggle into the couch comfortably.
“Hi!” John beamed at her and held his arms out in invitation.
John tried his best to smile, “Oh...well, er... Heh... too much information, Harry,” He chastised as he watched her walk towards her bedroom with that shy smile.
Dorian gasps dramatically at Sherlock’s side while the others laugh at his expense. The boy pouts and yells at Algernon, “You shall be sorry you said that when Sherlock, Gladys and I all crush you into the ground!”
“No! John!” Sherlock laughs, half-heartedly pulling away now.
Sherlock nodded, and turned round in his seat, raising himself up on his knees to peer at the item from a better angle. It was a small heart shaped locket. It was old and scuffed in some areas. The chain was broken and there was one photograph inside in black and white. Sherlock couldn't see it too well in this light, but he was guessing that this woman was somehow related to the driver. He smiled. Ah... another one.
“Er... bout a week or two?” Harry answered, unsure, “Cuz this season's fashion shows are up so I don't have much work.”
“Shut up, Irene!" John threw a pen at her lap attempting to grab her attention. "And for the record I would never beg for mercy.”
Sherlock glares at her through the mirror in front of him. “Foul strumpet,” he replies grumpily. Irene’s reflection grins at him. He gives her a tentative smirk in return and, turning around, offers her his hand, “You’re here, you might as well practice with me.”
They continue through a few more songs and as the playlist goes on they begin to grow slower along with Rosie’s energy. Rosie eventually begins to look quite tired and starts yawning. With each song that Sherlock’s playlist drones she grows more and limper in his arm as he sways. Finally, a soft song begins as her eyes begin to droop. The song starts with a sensual and soft guitar playing. Soon enough a woman begins moaning in a smoky soft tone to words in Spanish. “
John doesn’t know why he does it, but without thinking, he reaches over the table and takes Sherlock’s free hand (which is resting by his wine glass) in his own. “You’re a good man,” John tells him.
Sherlock sighs, “
John tries to backtrack, “No, I mean, I know he can be a dick, but what I mean is, he’s a dick to everyone, not just you-”
He went home then. Walking. He was afraid if he took a cab the rush of emotions would get to him. The fresh night air made him feel much better. It was around two in the morning when he arrived at his flat. He felt calm, as if a million weights had been lifted from his shoulders as he set his keys and suit jacket by the front table.
He notices as he stares at Sherlock, smiling that Sherlock’s cheeks seem to have begun to dust over with a bit of pink and just as he notices that, Sherlock’s eyes flick down to where John is still touching Sherlock’s hand. John blinks and feels a heat crawl into his neck as he hastily takes back his hand.
Sherlock had blushed at her frankness, mainly because he wasn’t expecting her to comment on this again and especially not now.  Where had that even
John gives Sherlock a tender smile. It’s really sweet of him to want to spend time with Rosie and he suddenly feels awful for keeping them apart for so long. Clearly they miss each other. “Yes, I think that sounds great,” he says, and they begin preparing to leave. Before they go, Tony returns to them with a small bag which is apparently carrying a box filled with Italian desserts.

Sherlock feels his ears and cheeks burn at her words but tries to act nonplussed, “Quite sure, little sister.”
of it! He attended two on Saturday alone! But this won't just be about him. It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding industry has transformed something which should really not be regarded so highly in the first place to some corporate revenue stream poorly disguised as a sham fantasy..."

The look of frustration on John’s face is still there, but his voice is sweet when he says, “Nothing ever is with you, is it?”

John shook his head, grinning, “No, no, it's okay. I did always wonder what that would feel like...”
“The last time was when...” He sighed, “
“Speaking of my brother, don't you two have work to do? Please, do go away.” Sherlock shooed them with his hand and began typing on his computer. Greg and Molly glanced at each other then walked silently, yet petulantly back to their own desks.

“Of course, John, I’m ever at your disposal.” Sherlock responds. His partner pinches his ass to grab his attention. Sherlock turns to glare at him just as the man gives him a sour little pout. ‘Don’t stop!’ Sherlock mouths, annoyed as John answers, “Great! Thanks, Sherlock. You’ve really saved us. You’re sure you’ve not got anything on?”
“I'm just trying to point out the hypocrisy of the spectacle.”

“Sherlock,” John warns, “You’re making a scene.”
“You know what, never mind...” Sherlock said, his full attention on what turned out to be John Watson's Diary. He skimmed through just the past week and found all manner of appointments and schedules laid out for each day in chicken scratch so small and so horrid that Sherlock smiled to himself, knowing, that even if John hadn't mentioned being a doctor in his speech Sherlock would have been able to guess from his writing alone. He continued flipping through, looking farther and farther back in the pages seeing appointment after appointment and wedding after wedding penned in to various weekends. And an idea started to form in his head...
Molly is dumbfounded. She sits there, continuing to gape, even after the screen has switched to other celebrities. She doesn’t know what to do. She’s shocked in the most confusing way. She does know one thing though, and that’s that she has got to tell John. She can’t tell him now, of course, because he’s on his date, but as soon as he gets back… but then, maybe Sherlock doesn’t want John to know? Why else would he be avoiding him, after all? Oh, but this is such a strange and tempting story to tell! Molly isn’t normally one for gossip, but this is Sherlock – dancing - on live television, on a popular celebrity dance show known for its glitz, glamour and, and, and, sequins.

I might do a few illustrations for this in the upcoming week (if work doesn't get in the way) I make no promises, but if you do get a lil e-mail about a chapter update or whatever... it won't be more writing, it'll just be pictures, most likely.
“Um...” John Watson was saying. Yes, it was definitely him. He'd recognize him anywhere, thanks to the hundreds of photos his little brother had taken of him.

Was it the thing about the skin?” Of course by not seeing her she’d deduced she’d frightened him anyway, “I thought it would have made you laugh. I did say it was a funny feeling, didn’t I? As I understand it when something is funny it makes people laugh.”
that killed Jennifer Wilson when I've never seen Carter's wife?” Sherlock smirked, “I'll tell you the truth, I didn't. I was suspecting Carter for a long while, though he would have been drunk and in the opposite side of town when she died according to his inebriation level when John and I arrived in town. It was the ring your sister wore in the photograph that let me know she was his wife. Her wedding band, memorable only because of its simplicity was what made her stick to my mind. Carter has an identical one. The minute I saw his ring I knew who he was married to.When I went up to Jennifer's rooms I found all her things were gone. Still I thought it might be him and hoped John would find more evidence. When I came downstairs to do the interviews with John I was disappointed, because I had no more clues, till I saw you at the bar. You had arrived after my announcement of the interviews. It was one of Dimock's statements that helped me make the link most. You see, he told me that Jennifer had ordered a cab, but that it had never arrived. He was wrong of course, you
“Damn right I am. Now get up there and marry your gorgeous bride!” John smiled, clapped Mike on the back and turned to give the other groomsmen a thumbs up. Mission accomplished, Captain John Watson, wedding extraordinaire saves the day again.
“No, but you need to leave.” Sherlock says firmly, reaching down and grabbing the man’s trousers. He tosses them lightly at the man’s head.
Sherlock chuckled. They were quiet again for a moment, comfortably this time. Finally Sherlock let go of John and said, “So... Breakfast?”
He’d had sex, but that sort of carnal pleasure could never make him play a song like this. No, this song was more than that. This song was Love, with a capital L, and Eurus didn’t know why the capitalization of the word was important, or indeed why it felt so accurate that it was, but she could almost feel it, just by listening to the sound of it. She could almost taste it on her tongue and feel it on her skin and it – It was beautiful.
“Ugh...” John laid his head on the bar, his hands holding his glass in front of him, “You don't know Harry. She's going to want me to do everything. I'm not just going to be her Best Man, I'm going to be taking care of everything.”
John's smile faltered, “So... that's it... that's... all I had to say... so... um... ”
Ps. There is a case I PROMISE. We are getting to it. We're only on Chapter 2.
“What? That's it. It's all I've got.” John said, irritated.
John made it back to Stamford's wedding for his speech and the traditional dance after dinner. After the party got properly started, with everyone dancing and drinking John saw his opportunity and dashed back out again to the Murray wedding to dance with Irene for a bit before she decided to fuck a bridesmaid in the dance hall again. And so it went for the rest of the night, John travelling between both parties, changing back and forth from his traditional black tux to his Achkan again.
(See the end of the chapter for
, especially because he has his suspicions about who exactly the man in his dream was. Considering the last argument they’d had and John’s dinner plans…
John stood there for a second letting them walk away. He doubted they'd notice his absence anyway. Just then he felt someone tap his shoulder twice. He turned in surprise as he heard who it was before he saw them,
Sherlock brought his hands back to his face and covered the shock on his lips with both as best he could as he took a breath, “John–”
Sherlock scowls, “boyfriend?” He asks.
John hesitated as they started moving, “Look Sherlock,” He yelled a bit in order to be heard as the man drove them back towards the pub, “I-I don't think I could sleep tonight after seeing Jennifer Wilson like that, especially knowing she stayed in a room at that same inn. I'm just a bit confused is all. Why are we doing this? What's the point?”
“Irene… you’ve barely told me anything.” Sherlock had whispered, a hand reaching for one of hers, “You’ve been keeping me in the dark - of course, we’re hitting a dead end. I’m probably going after clues that have nothing to do with your own case!”
Molly shrugs, a smile on her own face as she watches Rosie settle her face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck and stay there, quietly breathing him in, “Irene asked. Besides, It’s no problem. John said she misses you, so I figured it might be okay to bring her for a few minutes, at least before we go for our morning walk in the park.”
“Three weeks... it pleases me.”
The flash of something seems to pass over Dorian’s face again as the next couple of drinks are poured. Once again it’s gone before John can analyze the look. The boy hands one drink to Sherlock and leans against the bar, again speaking in a charming voice, “Oh no, no, I’ve never acted a day in my life. I find I’m quite clumsy at it. Bit of a terrible liar,” he shrugs, “which I suppose is what makes me so bad at pretending. No, I am but a humble musician, though I quite admire people who are multi-talented,” and at this comment his eyes rove over Sherlock’s figure while he continues brazenly saying, “Like you Sherlock.” He then addresses John again telling him, “He’s quite a marvellous dancer. I would have never guessed — but then I suppose we all have our secret talents don’t we? Like yourself — to think, you’re a Doctor now but you were an army captain at one point and
“No!" The man spat into the ground, "no! Not you John! Not you! Not you! Not you! Let me go! Let– ” The cabby began shouting manically.
Molly giggled.
! And you're dark and cynical, and well, that's you're problem, mate, not mine.”
“Thrilling that you know that,” Lestrade comments, teasing him, “It’s called hyperbole, Sherlock — I’m
They were silent a moment.
And John, after tonight I'm going to turn 'round, walk away and vanish and I promise you that you will never see me again if you don't want to, but I before I do... I want you to know that I think you deserve more than what you've settled for.” John scoffed. “No, I do. I really do, John. You deserve to be taken care of, for a change. I believe that, John.”
*insert shrugging emoji here* He doesn’t know. You know who else doesn’t know? Me. Yeah. I have no clue. ;) (no really the story is running away from me and doing whatever it wants to do. Is this what happens to mofftis? Is this why they make us cry like this?)
Irene had nodded, “Yes, it’s best to leave him alone,” she had agreed, “Some of his clients are rather particular about their privacy, you know, and Sherlock is very professional.”
“Wait, what do you mean, you quit?” She asked suddenly very confused.
, Doctor Watson, am going to have a drink,” Sherlock answered.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said walking up towards a car, John following close behind as the rain began to finally calm down.
names are technically correct.”
“Yes, well... much more efficient, wasn't it?” Sherlock looked smug.
Rosie looks to John, who has now leaned back slightly. John shrugs at her and picks up his drink, leaning back, even more, to signal that he won’t be assisting her in resisting Sherlock’s orders. “You did say you were hungry, Rosie,” he states.
“You have an entire hour,” Irene comments idly then, “Can I send this to John?”
————————————————————
Sherlock and Irene jump into each other’s arms and hug, laughing brightly and directing various “thank you”’s to the judges. John glares at the screen a little bit. He isn’t sure how he feels about everyone gushing over Sherlock using an emotional and physical vulnerability of his just to win some silly competition. What is Irene doing to him this time?
think you're attractive–” John explained as Sherlock pouted saying, at the same time as John spoke, “I'm at least
I'm back babayyy!
“Not quite. But yes, you left it in the cab,” William answered “and it was either the engagement party tonight or yoga with Irene, so I thought that...”
“Oh yes, sure let me just write you in, except, oh wait – YOU ALREADY DID, EVERY SATURDAY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR!”
“I know her. Well... met her, once, a few months ago.” Sherlock explained as they moved closer
“I’ll see you later, Mrs. Hudson.” John says, as she closed the door behind him.
Enjoy!
“And how many of them,” John pushes through, “are you going to give your number to?”
Sherlock raises a brow at that and begins cutting up the meat into smaller more manageable pieces, which he spears onto the tiny toddler-specific fork that the waiter had brought along for Rosie’s meal.
Not beta'd
“Look, John, it's a drink not a week in Paris. Come, it'll relax you.”
Also it gets a little heated after a point and for those of you who don't particularly go in for that sort of thing, I understand so I've made this easier for you with a warning. If you would prefer not to read it, you might want to stop reading after the little asterisks (****) I've placed there for you. I promise you you won't be missing out on anything other than the stuff you don't want to read.
Sorry it just makes for a good cliff hanger, doesn’t it? *grins* *runs away*
“I knew you’d recognize me,” the young man says, “Henry tells me you asked him not to alert me when you got here,” and Sherlock can practically hear the pout in his voice as he slips an arm around him and squeezes even closer asking, “Have I done something wrong?”
John had run out of the pub the moment he noticed Sherlock was missing. He was too late. Sherlock wasn't out here! But then John noticed something, fresh foot prints in the mud. Sherlock's and someone else's at his back. There were tire tracks on the mud as well, going in the direction towards the road Sherlock and John had come into town in. John frowned. What the fuck had Sherlock gotten himself into? John dashed over to the Motorcycle and quickly got on, hoping that he wasn't wrong as he drove it in the direction of the other tracks.
John frowned, “Where is he then?”
“The love of two true soul mates, Harriet and Mary.” John spoke, his eyes narrowed at his sister as she looked at him, her mouth slightly open in an upset shock.

Harry dashed towards John as he entered his flat.
to say no.” William stated it like the fact it so clearly was.
“Oh, good – ” Sherlock starts, going back to his bedroom but then he seems to realize what Irene has just said and gives her panicked expression as he runs back out, grabbing his phone out of her hands, yelling “What? NO!”
He feels himself sigh in frustration, running his hands through his hair as he tries to figure out why his mind is suddenly making him think about these things - why his mind is making him think of his best friend in this way. God, will Sherlock see it on his face tonight? And as that thought comes to him, so does another one - had he thought about it before and never realized it? Since when has he felt like this? Sherlock will surely see the panic on his face this evening. He’s about to text the man a message to cancel dinner plans after all when his phone chimes from the guest room. John sits staring in the direction of it for a second. He hesitates until the phone chimes again. Rosie turns to him, “Phone, Daddy,” She informs him wisely.
John sat on a stool in Mrs. Watson's little shop as his mother spoke to him sternly, “Look, Johnny all I'm trying to say is that the two of you are siblings, and it breaks my heart to see you both this way,”
Sherlock was quiet for a moment as he kept driving. At first John wasn't sure he'd heard him, but then Sherlock finally yelled back, “She was so happy on her wedding day, John. Not a single word I said in that article was wrong. It had all been so perfect... I admit at first I didn't know it was her, and that I'd be doing this were it Jennifer Wilson or not, but now I know it's her I simply must find out what happened... John I... this is what I did, before... before everything. It's what I
,” he twists a finger in his shirt and looks at his phone nervously, “Should I really end the conversation now?”
“How noble of you, do you also run around telling children that father christmas is a lie? Because someone needs to blow that shit wide open.”
“That is absolutely ridiculous!” John yelled, angrily pressing harder on the gas pedal. He just wanted this ride to be over. Why couldn't Sherlock just leave well enough alone?
“Hey,” Mary responded returning the greeting.
“It's just... now that I've...” Sherlock struggled to find words when he finally settled on, “gotten to know John, I realize that what I initially deduced might have been partially... well not incorrect but rather... there's more to the story than I originally anticipated.”
John rolled his eyes and waved back at her as he made his way to the airport.
Harry smiled weakly, sitting on the store counter, “...We're a mess, aren't we Johnny?”
“Dear God,” John says, horrified, “Or ever, if I have anything to say about it,” which only makes Sherlock laugh more.
in anything. I do, however, mean every word I say,” Henry grins. Molly rolls her eyes. He thinks he’s so clever. She turns her attention to the people below them, and he follows her lead with his annoyingly handsome smile still plastered on his face.
Something about the way she says it makes Molly’s already pink cheeks burn more.
Harriet made a show of looking chastised, “Actually... it just depends on how a few things pan out.”

“Sensual?” The officer from whom Sally had stolen the phone responds with an equally broad grin.
“Obvious.” Sherlock said as he put down the kick-stand and slicked his hair back out of his face.
John looked visibly uncomfortable and slightly aroused, “...mmnno?”
“Oh!” Rosie answers, “Yes, please daddy.”
“I’ll kick your ass and you know it,” Gwen answers.
The audience explodes into cheers and a few people manage to throw flowers onto the edges of the stage. Notably, someone’s yell is heard over the crowd saying, “We love you, Sherlock!”
The week after that: Mary Morstan not taking patients for the past half hour due to phone call with... Watson, H. (John takes all her patients that morning. Accidentally makes a kid cry.)
John blushes shaking away the look of deep concentration he’d had just moments ago, “Ah, er- Greg told me to watch it–” he lies (though technically Greg had told him to watch it, just… days ago), “Says there’s something I should see,” (also John hasn’t told his new paramour that Sherlock is on the show and he doesn’t quite know how to break it to her).
“I am a writer.” Sherlock smiled his most creepy smile at John.
Harry and Mary made eyes at each other as John tried his best to continue smiling while staring at the carpet. He wished the chair he was in would swallow him into a magical vortex in space... or something.
Thanks again!
Irene smacks him with the pillow he was using to salvage his dignity, making him squawk and tumble out of bed, the last dregs of the coffee spilling on the floor.
“What is it you do again?” John interrupted, sarcastically.
Irene left after her without a word. John didn't ask.
The shop bell rang as some one walked in, “Mum?” Harry's voice rang out as her eyes searched for her mother. She found her quickly standing in front of John with a look of surprise on her face.
Sherlock quickly types out a
And so the wedding continued with the Bride making her grand entrance and with the ceremony and photos going perfectly, if a bit slowly for John's needs. Still, it was lovely and with his job here done for the moment John ran out into the night again, making his way back to the cab in order to make it in time for his speech at Bill's. It was only half-way back to the Murray wedding that he noticed his cane was gone. John giggled as he changed, remembering he'd forgotten it.
John’s girlfriend gives him a look.
Irene swipes a hand through her hair in frustration and continues glaring at Sherlock, “I
him. The only animals you care about are the dead ones with sleeves. You're just saying all this because somehow you think you'll impress mary since she's so... beautiful. Or... at least other people think she is.”
The boys hang out alone.
” he sent to Sherlock, hoping that the man is able to hear or feel his phone from in there. From the sounds of it, the club is extremely loud. John walks around the line-up that’s set up outside to get closer to the front entrance so that he can be ready to be let in.
“What is?” Sherlock asks her, exasperated.
The next took John a little longer, because he was inside laughing hysterically. Sherlock, unable to hold back and his curiosity piqued, made to get up just as John opened the door and walked out dressed in a wine coloured turtle neck dress with a black lace overlay a thick silk belt-ribbon and a flared skirt dropping down to his knees. He wore it in combination with a pair of red flat slippers.
“Enjoy the party,” John spat and pushed past her towards Irene, where, incidentally he was keeping a bag with his laptop in it.
The waiter bats his eyelashes and continues, “What are
“Mmmmmuuuaa!” Rosie says, blowing a kiss in their direction.
“You’re on!” The boy shouts back, barely audible above the music, then he, Gladys and Sherlock huddle together and step closer towards the inside of the circle.
Sherlock has the decency to be truthful as he sighs, “She’s only met her the once, just this week. I didn’t know she’d told her her name. Molly brought Rosie over - it was my fault - I told Irene in passing that I hadn’t seen little Watson in a while and she took it upon herself to call Molly over while I showered. I did worry you’d be upset, but she was already here and she wanted to dance — and well, I couldn’t just say no—“
“Okay, um... Antoine, remember when I brought you the Sowersby's and they commissioned that six-tiered Diamond shaped masterpiece? And,
“Get in the cab, Detective
“Probably not,” Sherlock agrees, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“You alright, dear?” Irene asked.

Sherlock’s face goes scarlet and he states emphatically, “I am
“up next we have our master of mystery, transforming from detective to dancer, the incredible Mr. Holmes!”
John stood awkwardly in a corner off to the side with Irene next to him.
“It goes ding!” Rosie grins, getting up and standing by the corner of her playpen nearest to him.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and chooses to ignore John’s kick in favour of passing some of his own food to the baby, “Please. Mother would do that anyway. No, I just think it would be funny to see him annoyed that mummy gets to be the one spilling one of my ‘secrets’ instead of him.”
you thought I was attractive.” Sherlock smirked, saying it a little loudly as the bartender brought them their drinks.
Sherlock responds, “
Sherlock's back stiffened. “Jackpot,” He said, his voice sounding casual. He schooled his face to fit the sound as he turned and sat on a nearby chair.
Before the contest had started, when he and Irene had worked on song choices and choreography, he had had a clear vision in mind. It was important that he did, as he needed to stay in the competition for as long as possible until the case was solved, but with the nerves of the first and second performances combined with the pressures of staying had come Sherlock had lost sight of the vision.
Greg still isn’t sure, but he decides it might be a welcome distraction before he gets back to the murder he’s investigating. He takes the offered phone and turns on the paused video. At first, he almost rolls his eyes, having no idea why he’s watching a blonde woman and a skinny git twirling around a stage. Then he sees it. He sees why Sally is being so insistent, because the skinny twirling git... is Sherlock Holmes – and what’s more… the git can
John shakes his head at him and finally separates himself from his detective. "You've a filthy mouth, you know that?" He says, slapping Sherlock softly on the knee as he gets up to remove his condom and moves towards the door to go grab a rag from the bathroom with which to clean them both up. "Be right back." He whispers.
“Did you put that paper bag with the breakfast sandwich on my desk?”
Cecily squeals, “Oh how exciting! Let’s ask the others when they get up here! It’ll be jolly good fun!”
“Boys, now, now!” Mary gestured at the musicians and waiters. And the whole 'show' started again.
, don't you?! Listen to me carefully,
I know you’re all here for the smut ;) I’m kidding, I’m kidding.
“Detective William Scott. I work for Scotland Yard.” Sherlock flashed a badge.
Greg steps in before John can, more than happy to fulfill the request, saying loudly, “Dorian this is our friend Doctor Watson — if you don’t mind, would you be willing to let us steal Sherlock away for a quick drink?”
“Well, they really did love each other...” Harry answered.
“Sherlock's not here.” The severe woman spoke up then, her tone was not as friendly as the others'.
The phone dings again, signaling a second text message to accompany the first.
“Done.”
husband,
From beside him, John’s girlfriend splutters - “John!” She exclaims.
(See the end of the chapter for
...? I think is the technical term...” The way Sherlock is looking at him is confusing the hell out of him completely, it’s the look he gets when he’s discovered something new, and John adds, “Sorry, I always assumed you knew that?”
“No I mean it,” John said, pulling himself up slightly to give Sherlock a serious look, “seriously, never, never do this.”
to forget.” Sherlock took a moment to breathe; he was on a roll.
Carter put his hands in his hair and stared down at his tea. Mrs. Laurinston brought some over for the rest of the men then, and a cup for herself as she sat quietly and listened. Carter said nothing for a while. Just sat there.
Mrs. Laurinston answered the door for them and handed them each a towel. The men dried off as best they could and she ushered them over to the kitchen where there was a medium-sized round wooden table surrounded by six chairs, one of which was currently occupied by DI Carter, who was looking tired and nursing a cup of tea.
“It looks lovely. I haven't eaten anything, and let me give you some advice, do not drink whiskey on an empty stomach, I feel like I'm about to tip over into my own piss.” He laughed as John frowned at him.
“So, when you get married, you want us to look at the groom?” Mary asked.
Okay so there's a case and it's a little longer than I originally planned... so i dunno how 'mini' my 'mini-case' ended up being... Long enough for me to write a whole chapter and decide to cut it in half again. 7996 between this and what is now Chapter 9, so far. So... I'm sorry guys. I decided I'd cut it in half so that you guys could get to at least read something. I'm honestly 50% making this up as I go along while mostly following a movie script. I felt bad though because work has stopped me from writing and I haven't had a chance to do more. (honestly guys today was insane, holy shit i was so tired.)
“Mmmm, you're so vocal, John.”
Ps. ROSIE!! You’re so cute!
Dorian finally looks at John in acknowledgment of his existence and his eyes widen while he shouts, “
He’d laughed and said, simply, “Goodnight sister.”
John frowned a little at that but continued to walk towards her, as he got closer and closer John's face started to fall. He knew that gaze. It was the one he was sure he was always giving Mary. Cautiously he followed her gaze as he approached her but was distracted as he noticed Harry walking in to the club looking absolutely gorgeous as usual. He forgot about Mary for a second as he saw the dimples on his sister's cheeks as she grinned. He noticed she was looking straight ahead, though, and not at John, so he followed her gaze as well and found... it was settled on Mary, who continued to walk towards her. John felt himself stop just as he came to meet both of them in their path towards each other. Both Mary and Harriet seemed not to notice him as they stared at each other and he stood there looking from one to the other. Harry gave Mary a coy look, her mouth opening almost as if she was going to say something, then seemed to startle as her peripheral vision registered her brother.
, Sherlock?” He spat his name like a curse, “Do you want another picture, for your paper?” He fumed.
Mary didn't hear the comment and continued, “I'm a vegetarian too! I used to be a vegan but it was a it of a hassle and with my busy schedule... well”
“You need to get out.” Sherlock says as the man pulls out, a slightly disappointed yet sly grin on his face as he asks Sherlock in return,

Dorian flicks a shy glance at Sherlock and nods, agreeing, “Oh, and too fast – she’ll slip if he keeps leading her too quickly.”
Henry smiles sadly, and it’s the first time Molly has ever seen an expression of melancholy strike him, “Basil cared a great deal for Dorian. You could say he worshiped him. He was everything to him – his muse, his ideal, his God. He tried to explain it to me once before I ever met Dorian – his feelings for him. He acted as if it were some strange complex emotion but… it was love. It had to have been. It was the purest love I have ever seen anyone have for another person. And I don’t particularly believe in love. Not the ideal unconditional love the great romantics have written epics about, but if such a thing could have ever existed, then it did in Basil. Nothing else could explain it – the way Basil Hallward looked at that boy. I know he loved him, even though he never told me outright, but he never… not once – not as far as I know, anyway. Dorian never mentioned that Basil might have ever said anything to him. I do believe he may have wanted to, the night he disappeared. At least, I like to imagine he did.”
Sherlock opened up the little bottle and took the pill, raising it up in his hand when suddenly the window behind him crashed and the one in front of him cracked as a gun fired and a bullet flew right past the rear view mirror. Sherlock turned, startled, and the image he saw was one of such instant relief he dropped the pill at once.
Sherlock thinks for a moment, “Hmm quite young,” he says, “I think I was around Rosie’s age when mummy had me start on ballet and then at some point, I switched to ballroom. I think I won awards as a child but I may have deleted that. You’re probably better off asking my parents… or Mycroft. On second thought don’t ask Mycroft.”
Sherlock, however, pulls away, though his smile is still evident as he teasingly covers his mouth, “No, John,” he whines around a shy grin as John follows him up.
John’s grin grows larger, “No! You said - you said your
of others, but... I
“John.”
“Stop it!” John yelled suddenly and pointed a finger at Sherlock, “Just stop! Stop this! Stop it
Two nights after that: Harry and Mary making out on the couch when John gets home. They don't notice him leave. (He sleep's on Irene's lie-low that night. Wakes with a terrible back-ache.)
“Three weeks?!” John asked.
“John is hella pissed “because he thinks Sherlock is pulling another Janine” (he’s really just pissed cuz he’s jealous) and he’s like: Bruh I thought you learned!!
” She emphasized in Spanish.
“No! Mary! Mary, wait! Please, let me talk to you!” Harriet cried.
John woke to the feeling of Sherlock stroking his fingers up and down his spine as John lay over him feeling completely relaxed. He smiled into Sherlock's neck, “Good morning.” He mumbled groggily.
John rolled his eyes. And there was the Sherlock he'd gotten to know
“Just a little heroin John. I'll be right as rain come morning.” Sherlock grinned.
“I don’t understand why you don’t like him,” Molly replies, borrowing some of Irene’s lipstick at Sherlock’s suggestion, “he seems like a sweet young man to me.”
“They have the best cocktails, you really have to try them!” Dorian says excitedly as the push towards the bar.
“Wait...” Harry held up a hand, “You two know each other?” She asked, gesturing between the two of them.
Week 7: Group – Square Dance: Bad Things - Jace Everet
“Oh... my god.” John said, turning to her, “She sent the note! She asked me out. Irene! She– Mary! Mary asked me out!”
John just smiles kindly and presses a hand to his face. “Not a worry,” he replies, as he leads them both towards Sherlock’s room. They fumble down the hall, both a little weak in the knees as they each take turns stopping to kiss the other - to paw at each other’s clothes and arms and chest, grabbing and holding each other in their frenzy.
Where in all that was I supposed to deduce that you are, in fact, a bisexual?”
“Quite.” Sherlock stated, inspecting her ring, removing it and putting it back. He looked at the rest of the jewelry closely as well, but didn't remove it. John and Dimock stared at Sherlock in silence. The storm raged on around them, the water continuing to fall heavily over the men and the body.
s. “But I'm driving.” He said, taking the keys as Sherlock offered them.
“Yes, you and your brother are idiots. So was James. He got to me, but none of you ever got to her. No one ever did,” Irene had taken a sip of her drink, “until now. Bastard has threatened her life if I don’t give him what he wants.”
John can’t help it. His eyes flick momentarily to Sherlock’s lips and he just barely stops himself from reaching out to touch them.
he thinks, and images of Sherlock’s hands moving sensually in Irene’s body during that first dance come rushing back to him, followed by the images of Sherlock at the dance club with his shirt half-way open and that other woman. John tries to will the images away but finds himself blurting out, “Can I ask about the dancing?”
When his girlfriend doesn’t answer he just repeats the word, “What?”
Irene kneels behind his head and bends down to kiss his forehead. “Come now, Mr. Holmes, you’ll think better once you’re rested,” she says, tugging on his shirt in a plea to get him to sit up.
“I,” Sherlock finally says, dumbly, “Er…that is... thank you? John.”
Sherlock and John swore in panic as the car slipped off the road and onto the the grass zig-zagging across the wet planes this way and that until it turned full circle and slid backwards until the back of the car hit what must have been a large boulder.
The first thing Greg Lestrade says when he sees the line-up of twenty-somethings waiting to be let into the club is: “God I haven’t been in one of these places since —,”
he could believe him. But Sherlock had said pretty words to him before and in one thing he was correct; John deserved better. He deserved better than the pain that was caused him by Sherlock Holmes.
The crowd and a couple of the judges explode into cheers. Finally, Irene and Sherlock break pose and walk over to the judges’ table.
“Please, you dream of me every night,” Irene argues, tearing away the sheets so Sherlock can’t cover himself anymore. She isn’t a bit shy about the fact that he’d stripped himself naked to sleep last night since (and thank god for it) Irene had decided to fall asleep on the couch last night. Sherlock gets up so he can cover himself with a pillow, indignantly yelling “What the fuck, Irene?”
“It's much better actually.” John smirked.
Harry beamed, “Wait until you see the grooms. They look amazing.”
Harry giggled in the other room. John tried to let it affect him.
“Does anyone really
Sherlock frowns, “Isn’t that Thursday’s?” He asks.
As the song’s first chorus ends and second verse begins Dorian decides to go up next. He steps provocatively into Algernon’s space as the singer’s voice expresses,
First Sherlock and Irene did one dance. Then Molly meets Irene. Then John goes away and is sad. Then Sherlock and Irene do another dance, which Greg watches and is like "Lol this is great." and then John finds out Irene is Iris and then Sherlock and Irene dance again and then John - bless him - HE TEXTS SHERLOCK BECAUSE HE'S A JEALOUS MESS! Aha! Ahahahahaha!
John pauses, trying to figure out the best way to say what he wants. “So, em... listen, about this morning...” he begins, a hand brushing self-consciously at the back of his neck -
“Where is she?” Sherlock interrupted, standing.
“Technically this isn't my territory, so technically I shouldn't even be working this case,” Sherlock winked, “I just like to help. Besides, your DI Dimock only sent me here to have a look upstairs and do some interviews, which we've already done. We wrote notes for him, see?” Sherlock smiled, dangling the notebook as he took a seat at the bar, “Three fingers,” He said.
” and then the music in the background suddenly becomes quick, and Sherlock strikes his body into action, turning and beginning a stepping sequence towards his partner who materializes in a golden fringed dress from behind a shower of beads of the same color, dancing towards him. They reach each other’s hands and begin to swivel back towards the center of the stage where they separate again as they dance to the quick rhythm. “
“Ugh, Harry...” John complained. “What about Malcolm? Cousin Malcolm?”
Sherlock eyes her suspiciously, “If you wouldn’t mind…” he begins, hesitating slightly… she’s up to something, he can feel it.
Sherlock shook his head in disbelief and looked at the closet. He took out his mobile and snapped a quick photo while John changed into his (ugly) suit.
As he leaves, a sigh of relief escapes her. Finally, this weird secret is no longer hers to keep and telling John alone has made her feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted off her shoulders. She just hopes Sherlock doesn’t mind her telling.
” As an afterthought, she adds, with a leer, “Unless you would prefer another indelicate suggestion?”
“Molly, you’re too good for this world,” Irene says back while Sherlock responds, “No, Irene is right. He’s the devil.”
“Well…” John says, casually returning to his meal, “you’ve convinced me.”
He blushes as he reads Sherlock’s response, which clearly wonders the same:
John knocked on the door of Mary's flat. “Hey, I need your registry list,” He said when Harry finally opened the door with a large grin on her face. She didn't open it all the way though and only peaked out through it asking nervously, “Hi! I, er... thought you were going to wait downstairs?”
“I'm sorry mum, I don't know how I could have missed all of that,” Harry said charmingly, then turned to look at John in a slightly sceptical way.
” they reach each other and Sherlock immediately takes her hand, spinning her so that her arms are crossed in front of her while he stands behind her and they sway to the romantic tune, “
Hope you guys enjoyed this!
“Hmm… I don’t think I’ll share that little detail,” Sherlock winks, “You’ll just have to be surprised like everyone else. I will say that it may possibly be something by the same artist Irene’s song choice is by,”
“I've radioed Fred, works autopsy. They're coming to collect her right now.” Dimock stepped back, “Well, gentlemen, after you.” He said, ushering them towards the little house.
“My goodness wouldn't it be great if you could hire a service to do that? Like black cars with yellow checkered stripes down the side and–”
“Hey there Archie, how's it going?” John asked, genuinely glad to see the kid, ruffling his hair, “Sorry, you getting too old for that?” He asked.
But before Sherlock finishes a look of realization dawns on John’s face as a single name runs through his mind: Janine! “You utter bastard.” He suddenly says, enraged, “You’re doing this again? What the hell kind of a case would justify this? Going this far? Are you bloody serious, Sherlock?”
“You know I didn't.” John replied in a dry tone.
They watch as the teams currently “battling” begin to come away from each other at the tail end of their song, making room for the next challenging teams of people to step forward as the beat of the next song is mixed in. John spots Gladys as she detaches herself from the men who are stood on either side of her. She steps forward just as Algernon unwraps his arm from around John’s shoulder and a loud steady beat begins.
. His throat feels incredibly dry and he licks his lips subconsciously as he recalls the way Sherlock’s muscles had rippled in the light of the dance club while he moved. The way he’d had so much control over his body, and the way even his sweat-covered hair had seemed to dance along to the music with the rest of him as he tossed his head back in ecstasy — all of it was just...
“Oh... Right, well let's get inside and go talk to him then.”
“Yeah... It was the perfect wedding.” John agreed as he came over to stand behind her and look, his recent mail in his hands. “The Park, the view of the sea, the manor, the band, the ceremony at sunset...”
Anyway have fun crying inside after I’ve put that thought in your head. I’m going to go write about John being clueless and his cluelessness making everyone sad/annoyed/angry. (Including me).
Sherlock didn't hear the second half of that sentence since John had already hung up, but if he had he probably would have still had that manic look of joy plastered on his face.
Sherlock awakens with the second-worst hangover of his life. He feels around for his phone until he remembers, Irene still has it. He sighs and lets his head fall back down on his pillows. He should get up. He should really get up. He doesn’t want to get up. He continues to lie in bed with an arm tossed over his eyes as Irene walks into the room, happily greeting him by placing something on the bedside table then proceeding to bounce onto the bed, saying, “RISE AND SHINE SWEETHEART!”
The boy doesn’t seem to mind though. He nods and John has to give him points for seeming unaffected and even apologetic as he says, “Yes — goodness I didn’t introduce myself did I? How rude of me. Dear grandpapa would be ashamed. I’m Dorian Gray — I’m one of Sherlock’s competitors on
___________________________
Sherlock hadn't even attempted to smile in return, turning his attention instead to the papers before him.
“How can you claim to have an eidetic memory and not remember it? Especially this story?”
John hesitates, feeling awkward but turns around to face him and asks, “Oh. Well, good. Then, um... what did... what did you mean?”
“You- you don’t waste anytime, do you?” He gasps as Sherlock moves to suck on the man’s neck.
?” A rumbling voice whispers tantalizingly in John’s ear. He groans in the darkness and tilts his head in the direction of the speaker, seeking them out. In his mind, he sees pale skin and slim but strongly muscled arms. He feels the flat plane of a pale chest tingling just beyond his fingertips. Flashes of a rolling body fade in and out of existence and John longs to touch it. He feels himself growing stiff as he chases the feeling of that sensual figure, but he can’t seem to catch it. He groans feeling himself twist and turn, seeking the warmth of the body that should be there, but he can’t find it. Where is it? Where is the voice coming from?
He clears his throat. “Yes… well, um. I… mean it,” John fumbles. “You’re um. Good.”
John retreats to go get the items, and as he walks out the door says, “Always knew you’d be a bossy lay.”
Rosie spares her a glance as she waves, “Ni-ni!” She mumbles.
oh shit guys. John KNOWS he has a big bisexual crush on Sherlock?! Of course he fucking knows. Sherlock is his hero, he’s perfect and beautiful and he loves John’s daughter. But what’s he going to do with that information?
Epilogue
“Oh that's such... such
“Huh,” John comments and nudging Sherlock asks rhetorically, “She brought you a good case, didn’t she?”
Also this one's really short. Maybe should have combined it with the last one. Maybe I will when I finish and decide to edit the whole thing.
John stared for a moment until he realized who it was that was praising his actions tonight, “Stop. I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even know why I've let you stand here and talk to me.” He made to leave in the other direction.
“Well, Harry did, and when I cover a wedding, John, I've got to see every aspect.” Sherlock explained as John picked up a very nice looking frame and registered that as a gift. As he moved on to the next object Sherlock commented, “You realize that your sister wants so many presents from so many stores that she physically cannot register for them all herself?”
“Three weeks?” The French pastry chef asked, repeating the very same sentiment John had just thought yesterday. His eyes practically bulged out of his head, “No. Eet cannot be done! Eet ees not enough time for one of my créations!” He shouted, gesturing at a cake he was currently decorating.
Sherlock glares at her, suddenly brought into the conversation, but he grins at the competitors as he says, “We might be willing to join you...”
John giggled and moments later came out of his room swaggering in a bright red Zoot-suit complete with suspenders, over-sized shoes, tie, fake cigar and a large feathered fedora. Sherlock burst into laughter. “Okay, next show me this one,” Sherlock said as he pulled out what looked like a traditional men's kimono.
Sherlock’s eyes widen in panic. Shit. “Josh? What are you …?” he begins slowly, not finishing the question.
Henry but
“I came back from Afghanistan feeling like utter crap,” He began, “I was shot in the shoulder just above my arm, as you can see. Scar's still there,” he gestured with one hand at the healed-over bullet wound, “I had an intermittent tremor in my left hand, making it impossible for me to ever perform surgery again. I fell into a sort of depression. I was useless, no good to anyone... then I met an old friend, Mike, at a park in England. He invited me as his plus one to some mutual classmate's wedding. Shit happened and I ended up helping out with it somehow. It was good though. It felt good to be needed for a moment but... that's all it was. A moment, until I met Mary. She was a bridesmaid at the party. She was so smart, so beautiful, so charming and so perfect.” John sighed, “I think I felt I loved her instantly. So, naturally, when she asked me to work at the clinic with her, I said 'yes'. And she made me feel useful again. She gave me a job helping people and she allowed me to assist her as much as she needed, knowing that I needed this. She encouraged me to follow through with helping friends during weddings, also knowing how much I enjoyed it. She helped me get back up on my feet after I had plunged myself into a deep and horrible darkness. She... she saved me,” He finished, “I'd have done anything for her. Anything.”
” Sherlock exclaims the words without a care who’s sitting nearby. “John, what the HELL is going on in that funny little head of yours? You think that I was giving Josh my– That doesn’t even make any sense, John!”
Sherlock flared then, “Career?! What career?! Do you think this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life? That that sort of
