He sat up. That was his own voice. Ringing in his head. It sounded...well, it sounded bored but more to the point, it was smooth and well-formed, displayed excellent elocution, rife with disdain and public school education. It was his voice...but not. It may as well have been the voice of a stranger for all he knew of the man who owned it.
His nostrils flared. There was a hint of...something...on the wind. Around him, corpses continued to shamble about, unconcerned by his presence. He was, after all, still dead. For all his medical training and research, John could do nothing to change that.
John shook his head. “No, not even any accidental deaths. It was early days. I actually treated one of the wounded. All of them needed antipsychotics and superficial care, but no one died or was...turned.” He looked around the room. “I never even saw the place.”
“Yes.” The response was simple, and the dead man had yet to retreat from the two inches of space directly above his face.
They’d found him at Bart’s, blood on his face, no signs of intelligence behind his eyes. He’d tried to bite Mycroft’s agents, showed no recognition of Anthea or his own brother. Any trace of the criminal he’d been chasing long gone or locked away, inaccessible, in Sherlock’s ruined brain.
John sighed in exasperation at the unhelpful response before deciding to find out for himself. He reached a hand across himself into one of S’s pockets and found-- “Beans?”
He looked around the stage, at the light trickling in under the theatre doors. He hadn’t been out long. He closed his eyes again, basking in the borrowed memory, the new information he had on John and life before the crisis.
“Your Majesty” he intoned, leaning forward and kissing the lady on the cheek, “may I introduce you to my husband, John Watson-Holmes”. The Queen extended her hand:
“Mary, we have received a connection to a live stream from the people we believe are holding the principals. I am patching it though to your laptop”.
The overhead fluorescent lights were making a tick-tick-tick sound that joined the beep-beep-beeps gradually overpowering his brain. It compounded the screeching child dancing on his tautly drawn nerves and his nasal cavity burned with the synthetic smell of deodorant coming from the man perusing the shelf next to him. Sherlock had once asked for John’s assistance during a smell cataloguing experiment and had been informed that this particular scent was called “Lynx Africa”. Sherlock remained astounded by the number of men who chose to use it.
Sherlock considered her point for a moment, his mind still more focused on John. “Yes, well. We do have a certain affinity, I will grant you. We spend a lot of time together, you know, in the nights. I might as well feed her, I am usually up, no point in waking John. Speaking of whom, he is in danger and we cannot stand here
“Yes. Many times. He would say he wanted marriage, a home and a family but whenever I tried to suggest we actually arrange any of these things, he would back away”. This was true, Sherlock deduced but doubted that the decision to end the relationship had been entirely Eloise’s decision.
Both Holmes men glanced at him, neither having seemed to be aware of his presence until that moment.
“Keep walking. Round the corner” His rage had subsided on the short journey. Mary had sat with her head down, her hands laid flat on her knees and John had texted Sherlock then just stared out of the window. He was worried that he had left Charlotte on her own but knew that if she cried, Mrs. Hudson would hear her or that Sherlock would be back soon. It was a risk he had to take to get Mary away from her.
“It would appear I have. After you left, I decided that it was still a bad idea, us having a relationship. I don’t want to lose what we have John, you are the best person I have ever known, the only one brave enough to be my friend. However, I was simply unable
“I had no idea it was as large, had done as much damage. I’m sorry. It must have been excruciating for a long time”
Mycroft had deduced that they were being held somewhere very close to a main road, due to the clear sound of traffic. The regularity with which they heard the sirens of the emergency services also led him to conclude that they were still in London and the fact there was nothing obstructing the view of the sky from the windows suggested that they were high up. None of them had any memory of what had happened to them, the last memory each had being of sitting into a car to go to their intended destinations. Each in turn tried, unsuccessfully, to free themselves from the handcuffs. Sherlock was still passed out.
“Despite your shenanigans, Eloise Armitage was very forthcoming yesterday. She has an alibi for the time Willis was attacked and we have checked it out. She was in a board meeting at the time with 14 witnesses who have all said they saw her there. How did you get on with the murder weapon? Any luck?”
Lost in the different timsescape of his Mind Palace, Sherlock had no idea how long he had been wandering the hallways, opening a door, and methodically exploring each room for clues before slamming it shut again and moving onto the next room. Only two doors now remained closed and Sherlock was resolute on not opening the Cocaine Room, as tempting as it may be, he had made John a promise and was bound by that promise.
She grinned over the bed at John who was putting together the disparate elements of this stream of consciousness. She had her hand poised over her phone, waiting for a response to give Katy and at the same time was playing with her blonde ponytail, making it swish backwards and forwards as she twisted it.
This is written for JAT1981, my fellow 30 Day Challenger, in support of her choice to write Johnlockary rather than Johnlock, 'cos its all fine!
“Sherlock, you have the most extraordinary dick. It brings me the most wonderful pleasure, the best I have ever known. Like the rest of you, it is pure genius and I will never, ever have you suggest otherwise.” Sherlock thrust up into his hand at the praise and John returned his mouth to lick and suck until with a shout, Sherlock came.
From a vantage point that seemed to be in the top corner of a room, Mary could see the four men huddled together on the floor, all with their backs to one another. Sherlock was slumped over but the others appeared to be okay. As she watched, a red balloon in front of Mycroft popped, the noise echoing loudly around the stone walls and a small drone and a black walkie-talkie fell to the ground. It buzzed and crackled until a voice announced:
It’s hard though, because John’s nervous glances and aborted attempts go on for two full days. Sherlock is pretty certain he already knows what John wants to talk about, of course, but finds that he also has no idea how to start this conversation.
What Sherlock was finding much harder to quantify was the role he played in John’s esteem and self-respect. He was also troubled by the fact that John seemed to no longer be attending to one of his basic needs, sex. It was this that had led to the impromptu nakedness.
Before returning John’s first call, The Professor had undertaken some research of his own.  Having reviewed Sherlock’s website and spoken to a contact of his own in the Irish police force, the Gardaí, he had then returned John’s call with a range of questions, each one more complicated than the last. Two further phone conversations and Eoin Fitzgerald was satisfied they were genuine and knowledgeable and agreed to meet them and share his knowledge of the Hoard.
“They do not want me John and I am most certainly yours, unequivocally and unendingly. Do you understand?”
John said nothing. He took Sherlock by the hand and his daughter by the other, pulling them back into the function room. Chin out in determination, he beckoned to one of the photographers circling the room, capturing the crowd. The tables closest to the door burst into spontaneous applause at his return.
“Yes dear. CIA. Retired actually, but still on stand-by for duty. You seem surprised. You’re not the only one who has had to perfect an English accent over the years. Just so you know, dear, I shall not be issuing you with any arms and I understand your own have been secured. Also, I too know what you did to Sherlock and was against your involvement in this”.
Checking the bath, he returned to the mirror, scraping the razor carefully down each cheek, moving it in long, slow, careful strokes to his chin. What about his other gifts though, the ones people so often wished he didn’t have? Brutal honesty, manipulation and deception. These were all as much what made him Sherlock as those abilities Molly so venerated.
Sherlock just gave a snort of laughter and the tension in the room eased. “I think that’s just you John, but I am deeply flattered. Now it’s your turn”.
Opening his eyes to bright daylight, Sherlock decided he had made a terrible decision. Shockingly poor. He would ruin everything and never see John again. John didn’t even like classical music very much, why on earth would he want to go and see a concerto? Hauling himself from his bed, wrapped in his sheet, Sherlock examined his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Face sleep-creased, curls madly pointing in all directions and dark circles under his eyes, what on earth was he thinking? Why did he think John might want him? Selfish, selfish, selfish he chastised the creature in the mirror. He went in search of tea, dragging his sheet with him.
“Did I fool you? Really? Are you just pretending? Tell me the truth, Sherlock, did you really not know?”
The disco took over and everyone danced and drank and laughed. It was a celebration of two great men, the triumph of love and the joy was infectious.
God, thinks John, he really is loving this. Maybe all he has ever really wanted is for Sherlock to be happy after all. “We haven’t made any plans yet,” he smiles, “I think The Times might be a bit unnecessary though. What about you Sherlock?”
Sherlock was desperately trying to move upwards, towards the surface, to breath. The more he tried, the thicker the nothingness around him became, morphing from air, to water to treacle. It was exhausting. He was panting, recovering from his last effort when the rumbling noise came again, louder this time, closer. Sherlock listened intently trying to work out what the sound was. He surged up again, determined, and followed the sound.
“Hi Dad” Emilia burst into the room bringing life and joy with her. She threw down her school bag and moved to the other side of Sherlock’s hospital bed, leaned in and kissed his forehead.
“Ok gents, we’re here to get you out but we have to get those handcuffs off first”. She whispered, creeping from one to the other on slow tiptoe, giving the balloons a wide berth. John, Mycroft and Lestrade were able to walk but Sherlock had to be half carried out, leaning heavily on John and Molly. The men were led to a waiting ambulance and once they were safely inside, Anthea turned off the camera, mission completed.
“Be under no illusions, Mrs. Watson, I know precisely who and what you are. I also know what you did to my son”.
“What on earth are you doing? Is something wrong? Did Sir Phillip leave this way?” Sherlock exclaimed as John made his way down the palace hallway, pushing at doors until one gave and Sherlock found himself unceremoniously shoved into a shelved storeroom full of towels and cleaning equipment.
“Not really. It means they think he is going to stay like this for a long time” John rubbed a hand over his face “maybe a very long time”.
“Hi Dad” Emilia burst into the room bringing life and joy with her. She threw down her school bag and moved to the other side of Sherlock’s hospital bed, leaned in and kissed his forehead.
John and Sherlock run a trial inspired by one of John's fantasies from the time before they were a couple.
John hung up. He wiped his face. He had seen bacterial meningitis take children in a matter of hours. He had also met survivors, some having had their lives saved by the emergency amputation of feet or arms. On auto pilot, he turned off the heat under all the pans and walked slowly over to Sherlock and the still laughing Emelia and put his arms out to take his daughter. He held her close and explained to Sherlock what was going on.
Dinner was tasty, eaten off laps in front of the telly and there was way too much so John froze the left-overs and persuaded Sherlock to dry up the clean dishes. John decided that if they never did anything else but kiss and live in this companionable bubble he would be happy for the rest of his life.
“What about fruit? I’m going to make a fruit salad for pudding and we should have a fruit bowl on the err..” He glanced at the kitchen table, currently covered in test tubes, a Bunsen burner connected to the gas supply at the back of the cooker by a very dubious looking rubber tube and a selection of chemicals. In the middle sat one of John’s date shoes.
Five minutes later he had completely changed his mind. This was the most disastrous idea ever in the history of human ideas. John would be shocked, and probably disgusted. Was he even gay? Sherlock had no idea. He had certainly been put out when Mrs. H had suggested they may only need one bedroom the night John had first called to see the flat. No. Sherlock would only drive John away. He may never see or hear from him again. Awful idea. Terrible.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and began searching systematically, beginning in the bedroom and working his way into the bathroom, living room and kitchen. The flat was clean and tidy, the victim probably used the services of a regular cleaner. There was obviously only one person living here and a root through the pockets of the coat hanging in the wardrobe and the wallet in the kitchen confirmed that person was Mark Willis.
Sherlock looked up at John with a jerk, suddenly realising John was talking again. “Do you want a relationship with me John or just sex?”
“This John. I want to see you, touch you, learn you” the strokes continued and John closed his eyes and relaxed into the longer, firmer strokes on his rib cage and up to his chest. Sherlock groaned slightly and lowered his face to rub it across the raised places of John’s pectoral muscles and kiss his way reverently up to John’s neck. It was only when every other inch of him had been smoothed and worshiped that John realised that Sherlock was now kissing the skin around the perimeter of the gunshot scar on his shoulder.
John’s eyes flickered his surprise at the pet name but he said nothing, instead smiling like a loon and leaning in for a kiss,
Sherlock closed his eyes and paused for a moment, the worry rising to the surface and he had to lean against the door frame. He was tired, having been up with Charlotte since her feed at 3 am and they had watched the sun come up together. He hadn’t bothered to go back to sleep before feeding her again at 6, instead folding the gargantuan amounts of clean clothes in the drier this one tiny person needed. He had responded to Lestrade’s urgent call at 6.55 before having had a chance to wash or eat.
Taking him by the cock, John led Sherlock to the coffee table and bent him over it. He caressed the bare buttocks for a moment, following the caring movement with a resounding slap that caught both cheeks and balls. Sherlock gasped and then groaned deeply. Experimentally, John repeated the slap, this time making sure that his fingers grazed Sherlock’s anus too.
“None of it? Not even apples or bananas? Everyone likes bananas or grapes maybe. I love grapes and nectarines now I think or it. Oh and apricots”.
Once they got home from the hospital, Mary mentioned it to her visiting Public Health Nurse, who assured her the baby was just hungry and just needed a ‘top up’ to Mary’s own breast feeding.
This step had not quite gone to plan. Sherlock had scheduled the meetings to take place at the kitchen table each morning at 9.00 and had even gone as far as to put it in his Google calendar and send John an invitation. He prepared an agenda and brought a note book to take minutes. Unfortunately, the first morning John had just glared at him over his tea and told him he was not awake enough for a meeting. The second morning had been even worse because John had been at work and Sherlock had been forced to conduct the meeting on his own. He had provided John with a copy of the minutes. The third morning he was already out and about himself, shinning down a drainpipe in pursuit of a burglar. He decided that maybe it wasn’t really working.
“Indeed. I understand you may already know this but I am obliged to tell you anyway, under the instructions of the Centre for Disease Control. You need to put Emelia on high dose antibiotics immediately. As you collected her here, you also need to take a course.”
Sherlock keened his delight, spread his legs wider and dropped his right hand to his own dick, slowly stroking in long, deliberate movements. His left hand caressed his balls and he pulled his knees up slightly, offering John the best view possible. He opened his eyes, dark green with need and locked onto John’s face. John gazed down at the magnificent view, leaned over and kissed Sherlock. He whispered into his ear, low and demanding:
John wasn’t sure how he felt about this but the sight of Sherlock, naked and lying stretched out on his side on top of the creamy bed, propped up on an elbow was enough to persuade him. The man positively deserved his own spotlight.
“Yes, yes, you’re a genius blah, blah, blah.” Sherlock dismissed him with a wave.”Hmm. I was thinking of going to see Madeline Neresvsky. She is performing a violin concerto at the Royal Albert.”
He smiled at Fifi as he paid an extortionate amount for fruit, vegetables and a few spices. Even the cost of it didn’t dent his great mood. He was thoroughly enjoying his day off and was looking forward to the afternoon spent cooking. He envisioned Sherlock eating a bit of everything he cooked and a small thrill ran through him. He didn’t bother to try and examine why that should be, he had accepted his happiness at taking care of Sherlock a long time ago.
Just three weeks later and Johanna was in hospital recovering from her operation. That night, her parents and her Sherlock watched for hours as Johanna got her first ever full night of sleep.
Ending the call, Sherlock moved to Mrs Hudson. Carefully laying Charlotte down on the kitchen rug, he quickly loosened his landlady’s bonds and removed the gag. Going down on his haunches, he looked her straight in the eye.
John props himself up on one elbow, arm across Sherlock’s back. “Sherlock? Sherlock. Look at me, love. What’s wrong?”
Eoin swings round on his chair and scrabbles through some papers on his desk. He hands Sherlock an A4 hard bound book.
John was crowded up into Sherlock, his angry face only millimetres from the taller man’s, every muscle bunched and his fists clenched by his sides.
“Still no change. They are talking about maybe moving him to a different part of the hospital, a less high support unit”.
By now, John was nuzzling at the aforementioned penis. Sherlock’s annoyance had been replaced with a languid, relaxed look. However, he sat up and glared at John’s last comment,
With a cup of tea, Mycroft picks at a raisin and custard Danish and beams at the two men. It’s unsettling.
“We’re here lads” The cabbie called, brightly. “That’ll be seventeen quid. Sorry it took a while, it’s the bloody weather”.
Sherlock and John discuss crossing the line from being a couple to a family and how that might work in the future. Rosie doesn't care, she just loves her Dadalock.
Feeling drained all of a sudden, John sat down on the coffee table facing Sherlock. He had not got this far in his imaginings of this scenario. He thought he had been through every possible outcome from being physically thrown out of 221b to Sherlock laughing at him and announcing “but John, I’m not gay” to Sherlock taking him in his arms and kissing him passionately declaring “Oh John, what took you so long!”. That had been his favourite one, had been revisited and embellished rather a lot and had resulted in a rather lovely wank. However, he had not been prepared for this cross examination. On reflection he wondered what he had been thinking. Of course there would be questions.
Here lies smut and some binge drinking, so please be warned. To be honest, I am surprised it has taken me 17 days to get to it. If that's not your thing that's ok, we can still be friends and there will be something new tomorrow.
It was at this point, in a moment of desperation, that they discovered Sherlock Holmes had a hidden talent – he was a baby whisperer. In an effort to help Mary get at least a small amount of sleep and to soothe his crying daughter, John had taken to giving Johanna her late feed, popping her in her car seat and brining her for a cruise around the quiet London streets. She rarely slept but it did seem to soothe her. One night, John headed for Baker Street and, unsurprised to find the lights still on, they went in to visit Sherlock.
“Um, yes, alright. Listen. I need to talk to you about something. Been thinking it over all day. It’s about yesterday, why I walked out on the crime scene”.
Turning over onto his side to relieve the knot of tension in his stomach, John opens his eyes to look at Sherlock. His husband. A new pang of guilt creeps up on him as John admires Sherlock’s dark lashes lying on pale cheeks. He should be happy now; having this should be enough, should at the least, ease the loss. After all, wasn’t this everything he had ever wanted?
John rapidly strips his clothes. He had planned to leave his uniform jacket on but decides that maybe they should leave that for another time. Before hanging it up, he removes the wooden box from its pocket and pads into the living room, carefully leaving it on the mantelpiece, making sure it is precisely squared up.
“What the hell, Sherlock?” yelled Lestrade, as Sherlock pulled on their shared handcuffs in an attempt to put a hand to his back. He was feeling clearer headed after throwing up but was in no less pain and began to suspect that whatever he had been given had compounded the damage he had already done to himself with overdose.  He could smell the oxidising chemical in the balloons and it was making him nauseous again.
John sighed. This was never going to be simple was it? He walked over to Sherlock, took him carefully in his non-injured arm and hugged him, leaning down to kiss the tears from his cheeks.
“Yes, he also had traces of ecstasy and marijuana in his system but at much lower levels. He probably hadn’t used either of those in a number of days. The alcohol was fresh in his stomach. He was drinking it as he died”.
Sherlock whined and his hand sped up, his hips bucking. John sat back on his knees and stroked his own aching cock. He watched Sherlock’s hand flying and matched his rhythm. Raising himself up on his knees, he towered over his lover,
Eloise Armitage was strapped to a dining room chair with silver duct tape. Her brother towered over her, a large sports trophy in his hand and they were screaming at each other:-
They fall into a graceful waltz, carefully moving around the cluttered room. They gaze into each other’s eyes, individually remembering the times they had practiced this for John’s wedding to Mary. John remembers the waltz Sherlock had played for them and pulls Sherlock tight against his chest as he forces himself to remember watching him leave the wedding, alone, and how John had felt like he was screaming at him to stay, not to leave him.
“Yes. Tomorrow. That’s where he wants us to go, his wedding. Do keep up John!” Sherlock climbed down and sat on the sofa with a thump.
This story is totally true, based on my youngest daughter although we had no Sherlock Baby Whisperer. Yes, I was offered the parenting course as the solution and no, I haven't yet recovered from the sleep deprivation.
“May we leave them open? I would like to look at you. It was very dark last night. Would that be alright?”
Standing now in front of the amazing display, John watched his own hand reach out for the plump, ripe apricots. He picked one up and sniffed it. They smelt delicious. He placed a punnet of them at the top of his basket and a few in a brown paper bag for eating on the way home. He knew Sherlock would have a hissy fit if he found them, but really, they were only fruit and Sherlock was a grown man. He could just get over himself.
The dream is nothing more than a series of colours and shapes: a sense of heaviness in his arms, then the floating morphs into a tautness in every muscle. John wakes suddenly, the dream evaporating. He is flat on his back, the grip of guilt hitting him, the familiar pain and loss sitting in his stomach. His mind reaches for its cause until he begins to remember and automatically brings the riveted, steel shutters crashing down, hiding away the unwanted images.
“Oh Sherlock, my extraordinary love, I need to keep those arms pinned down again, to spread your knees with mine and lay between you. I love to just
This morning he is bursting with excitement. He misses Sherlock terribly; it’s an ache in his chest and an itch in his fingers. He had started the day by treating himself to a languid wank just thinking of Sherlock and all the things he intended to do to his boy tonight. John had decided it was a medically advisable procedure as he was sure he would have the horn all day just looking at Sherlock in his tightly-tailored new suit.
I should book a room somewhere new for two more days, maybe three? Somewhere cleaner. Now she has company. Husband? No, Lover? No. Brother? No. Oh, of course, cousin. You’re slowing down Holmes. That pastry was okay, not as good as the ones from that bakery in Watling Street that John always went to. I wonder how John is? I must get an update from Mycroft.
Watching himself in the mirror, John dipped his left hand inside the underwear and pulled his cock out, pushing the fabric down to catch firmly on the underside of his balls. He studied closely as he gave himself a series of firm, slow pulls, his foreskin pulling back. As his hand sped up, John’s head was a kaleidoscope of images and sensations from the last six weeks.
“Probably poisoning. It’s usually poisoning when Anderson can’t identify the cause of death. No obvious blood or wounds and he is stumped.”
Sherlock looked at John, his eyes half closed, a deep grey-blue colour. They held each other’s gaze for a moment “I would like that” Sherlock whispered. “And what would you do next?” John gave him a small, slow smile.
“It was watching the force and trajectory of the apricot fall, made me realise that the murder weapon was actually a sphere moving at great speed. From that point on, everything else fell into place. In fact, Lestrade, I predict you will find the ball in the gardens under the purple geraniums”.
“She said they would be here about five thirty, she was going to meet her Dad at work then come over. Is that alright?”
Whilst buttoning the shirt, he concluded that he wanted to make sure that John would continue to feel this way for a very long time and that he also wanted to try and give John that particular look that meant he wanted to touch Sherlock. That hungry look.
“What you said the other night in bed...about wanting a child.” He studies his hands in his lap. “How do we...if we are together...and I want to be...but is it not...? I can’t give you that, Sherlock.” The last statement comes out in a large sigh.
“Sorry John, you simply don’t have the security clearance for me to answer that but don’t worry, I’m sure Mummy has a plan, she usually does”.
“I saw you with that woman. I saw you kiss her. What the hell do you think you are playing at Sherlock, hmm?” John leaned up and pulled open Sherlock’s shirt at the collar, biting and sucking hard at the delicate, soft flesh where the neck and shoulder met leaving a dark purple welt. Sherlock gasped and gripped John’s dick hard.
“Lestrade. I think I know where John is” Sherlock shouted as he ran downstairs. He was brought up short by the sight of Greg holding Charlotte, rocking and shushing her but to no avail. The baby was still crying, harsh, sharp sobs.
There was small gasp in her head set, then a brief pause before the determined tones of Violet Holmes came through once more.
“Come back to me Sherlock. I’m not done with you yet, my darling. So many things still to do together. I miss you. I miss you in the kitchen filling the fridge with biohazards, I miss you shouting at the TV, I miss you playing the violin and I miss you sulking on the sofa. I miss you in our bed” John climbed up and perched on the edge of the narrow hospital bed, lying on his side. He wrapped one arm lightly around Sherlock’s waist and propped his head up on the other hand, getting as close to Sherlock’s ear as he could.
John turned and gazed at Sherlock “Is it too late? Are we too old for adventures? I am too old for regrets anyway”.
“You are my fiancé. When Lestrade calls to offer us a case, I can say ‘just a moment, Chief Inspector, I must first ask my fiancé if he is available to assist’ and he will exclaim, ‘your what?’ and I shall respond ‘my fiancé, Lestrade. Do keep up!’” The bed shakes as Sherlock giggles.
“No, the pressure to the skull is too great, the glass could smash if applied with that amount of force”. Sherlock considered again. There had been no obvious weapon at the crime scene and his search of the flat had not turned anything up.
There was a frisson of excitement down John’s spine at the idea of Sherlock dressing to please him and he groaned. Holding Sherlock’s face in his hands he deepened the kiss, tongues grazing and, pulling the taller man down to him, holding him close.
He also finds this recent change in Rosie’s behaviour a fascinating development; the testing and pushing of boundaries, the deployment of social niceties to get what she wants. The skillful emotional manipulation of every adult she meets enthralls Sherlock. What John insists on labelling as ‘the terrible twos’, Sherlock sees as forming the bedrock of Rosie’s personality and her ability to interact with others. At times, he is in awe of her skills. He has much to learn from her.
A second origin story, this time about Sherlock and his suits. We find out more about Michael and Sherlock gets to see John in his new suit.
John wondered what on earth could have happened to give Sherlock such a deep hatred of an innocent fruit in addition to its Mycroftian resemblance. “I’m sorry Sherlock that was a totally unintentional apricot, I meant to eat them straight away and I forgot all about them. I’ll get rid of-“
need to be escorted up the aisle. Molly, this is for you,” Mycroft hands Molly a laminated sheet of paper. “Sherlock, John you can step in here. Harriet, if you would be so kind, may I have a brief word?”
They had formulated a plan for just this eventuality. John and Sherlock had sat up one night with the baby wrapped in a blanket on the bed between them and discussed all the possible attacks Mary might make until the dawn broke and they finally slept. It had all come down to one simple fact. Whatever happened, John would protect Charlotte.
?” Greg was eyeing him, hands gesticulating wildly. John raised his eyebrows in surprise and looked at Mike who was nodding solemnly, doing his best not to fall off his stool.
Turning off the taps and stripping the filthy hoody and tracksuit bottoms, throwing them into the corner of the bathroom, Sherlock looked down at his own scarred body, the older marks on the inside of his arms and the newer ones on his feet. Sinking carefully into the hot water, enveloping him its soft gentleness, he thought again of John, of his bravery, friendship, care and loyalty. True gifts. If John knew what he was about to do, John would understand why Sherlock took the drugs, to hide from himself, from these so-called ‘gifts’.
Somewhere near 4 am, Sherlock was exhausted, on edge, unable to sleep and almost on the verge of tears. The Mycroft in his head berated him for his indecision and his imaginary Mummy was at her wits end with him. Frankly, he was at his wits end with himself.
know the answer to this one. “Yes. I would very much like to touch you, John. I have done so for quite some time. However, I have been very unsure of your own feelings on the matter.” Should he tell John about the experiment? Possibly not.
“Any progress in finding the driver?” Greg shook his head. Three weeks after Sherlock had been knocked down by a car that had come up onto the path and hit him at speed, straight on, causing Sherlock to smash his head on the kerb, all the leads had gone cold. There was no doubt it had been done deliberately but there had been nothing concrete to work on.
"Sherlock, mindful of his manners, just about managed a “John, I ..” before pulling John’s chair back from the desk and throwing his leg across his blogger who suddenly had a very full lap of whimpering detective".
“I never knew John. I’m so sorry. I didn’t know. I should have seen it, but you were my conductor of light. There were, and still are, things I cannot see unless you translate them for me. It seems your daughter may also have inherited that gift. After we met I reached a decision to come here today, to tell you what I should have said thirty years ago, with no expectations or restraint. I love you, John Watson.
Five minutes later, Sherlock was sat drinking his tea and listening to the small splashes and ripples of the bath water. Without really thinking about it, he left his mug on the table, went to the bathroom and opened the door, just enough to stick his head around.
Sherlock pushed back, the thin material of their pyjamas not really getting in the way too much. John slid his hands under Sherlock’s top, smoothing and stroking the strong muscled back, still warm from sleep. Sherlock in turn grabbed John’s bum and pulled him tightly closer to increase the pressure of their dicks rubbing together.
“That is the good thing about having a genius for a husband. You learn quickly. Well done. I may now consider it” John gave him another hard slap, driving Sherlock’s dick through his hand. Each slap brought Sherlock closer, a mixture of divine relief combined with stinging pain. Sherlock didn’t know what to focus on and the two sensations intertwined.
“Ah, Sherlock, please” John begged but Sherlock was unrelenting and began his exploration of John’s other arse cheek, repeating the tantalising kisses in towards John’s sac from the other side. This time Sherlock slid his hand underneath John and gripped his very hard, hot dick. There wasn’t enough room for him to move his hand, but it didn’t matter because at the first touch, John rutted and pushed into the hand, crying out in delight at the touch. Sherlock spread John’s thighs slightly, dipped his head and took John’s balls into his mouth, sucking and licking and pressing first his tongue firmly on the perineum.
“Hmmm.” Sherlock looked around the familiar room, deducing that the last customer to visit had been a very minor royal. He fidgeted with his hands, stroking the sofa’s black brocade.
John was momentarily flabbergasted, and grateful for Michael's subtle steer towards the bottom of the staircase. "Up we pop, Dr. Watson, the measuring room is at the top of the stairs."
“You are at least a stone underweight for your height and, yes, as your doctor, you are most likely deficient in a Vitamin C, B group, K and iron, at the very least. I have lived in this flat with you for 16 months and in that time, I have never, not once, seen you eat a piece of fruit”.
It was the beeping that was doing John’s head in more than almost anything. Every one of these machines had their own beep and they all made that nasty tinny sound at least once a minute. Try as he would, he just couldn’t drown them out and the constant noise was gradually driving him mad. Of course, the one beep he did like was the heart rate monitor. That reassured him that, although everything else had gone to hell, Sherlock was, at the very least, still alive.
Her face was very thin and tired, her skin a grey colour and her clothes shapeless and loose, a pair of tracksuit bottoms, sweatshirt and trainers. Her hair and clothes were damp and the thumb and forefinger of her right hand were rubbing against each other compulsively. She bore little similarity to the woman he had married and didn’t even look much like the woman who had given birth to Charlotte just over a month ago. John took a small step back, away from Mary and closer to his daughter.
Standing in the middle of the living room, Sherlock spun around in a circle trying to decide what to do. He needed to think but was distracted by wondering what John was doing, if he had slept, whether he would be going to work in the clinic as planned or if Sherlock might get an opportunity to talk to him. He considered making tea and toast, spun around again and contemplated the sofa, another spin, causing his dressing gown to flare out around him and his eyes rested on his violin. Good, yes, he would play or maybe even compose, it always helped him to think.
Sherlock cut off the end of that sentence, determined to allow his actions to speak for him. He kissed John speechless and wrapped his own hand around John’s. With his other arm wrapped around John’s back, he began to move his hand until they both lost all control, hands flying faster and faster until Sherlock came with a shout, shortly followed by John, keening into Sherlock’s shoulder.
It’s not as if anyone else has ever referred to him as her Dada or Daddy. Also, it does not matter how many times John corrects her - “No, love, Sherlock. Sherr-lock. You say it.” - Rosie still calls him Dadalock.
Heading to the laundry basket in the kitchen corner, John tipped its contents over the floor, hunting for something he didn't mind parting with. He had settled on an old green t-shirt when Angus jumped from Sherlock's lap and began sniffing and pulling at things until he grabbed a particular bit of fabric and ran away with it.
“Her full name is Charlotte Sherlock Rachel Watson” John knew this would only make matters worse but she needed to know, to understand
Behind Anthea, the screen showed the stolen car and a map of the location where Mycroft had last been seen. Mary had many questions but found herself automatically settling in to remember the key pieces of information and start to formulate ideas. She pushed the voice shouting ‘Someone’s got John’ to the very back of her head with practiced ease.
From behind her computer screen, Mary let out a sigh of relief. John was safe. She tapped on her headpiece again.
John takes a deep breath, he’s not too inclined to make big emotional speeches, “I am a different man now, not the man that fell in love with you nine years ago but
Sherlock stood and considered this. In the past he had felt pressured to keep his partner happy, had felt that he could only keep them if he did the things they asked of him, however difficult or uncomfortable it made him. He decided to trust John, take him at his word and say the things he truly wanted.
Sherlock moved gracefully through the crowd, stopping occasionally to greet someone or to respond to his name with a nod. The ballroom was huge, one wall made of floor to ceiling windows, the other three covered in gilt-framed paintings and mirrors dissecting and refracting the light from the crystal chandeliers.
Unsure, John remained where he was for the time being, sticking to the plan just to watch Sherlock’s back and keep as invisible as possible. The woman had reached Sherlock and was placing a hand on the back of his shoulder to get his attention. As Sherlock turned around and looked down, his face lit up with a beam and he wrapped his arms around the woman, pulling her into a hug and even lifting her up off her feet slightly.
Sherrinford returned with coffee, olives, baklava and Turkish delight, multi coloured and drenched in icing sugar. As they settled down, the sun began to set, the colours shifting from blue to yellow and pink. The brothers sat in silence for a moment watching the swifts swooping and curling, rising on the warm air before diving again in the cooler currents.
“Then we do exactly what you want to do and no more, but there is something you need to know. I say it without expectation, for no reason other than I need to say it out loud, even if it is only ever once. I love you, Sherlock. I have been in love with you for years. I want to make love to you.”
The scotch was gone and another ordered in rapid succession. He reminded himself to take his time with this one, he had all night and John really didn’t want things to end the way they had the last time he had attended one of these functions. Blinking rapidly, he shoved away that uncomfortable memory.
John slipped out of his shoes and socks and began to unbutton his own shirt. He let his eyes trail away from the piercing gaze of the now naked Sherlock and looked down at himself.
Back to Johnlock and, for a change, John annoys Sherlock so much they have a row and then, naturally, have to make up.
“What the fuck are you doing in my shed?” The blonde man who had wrenched the door open filled the doorway, blocking out most of the light.
The thought had never once crossed his mind. It had never occurred to him that John might sit down and have such a conversation. More to the point, how would he even begin to start to have that conversation himself? No, on balance, this had been easier. More his style. Not that he was about to admit that.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock pants out, tears coming from the corners of his eyes. “Oh, please promise me you will never say that again.” More shaking. “Fill me with your-” but Sherlock Holmes is unable to end his sentence because he dissolves helplessly into another fit of giggles. When he finally manages to draw a breath, he looks up at a stunned John.
Sherlock, stretched out on the sofa, observed him out of the corner of his eye. In the six months since John had come home, this was the stillest and quietest John had been, sitting now beside the fire staring ahead into space. Sherlock observed the hunched up left shoulder and the clenching and unclenching of John’s left hand. Silently, Sherlock stood and boiled the kettle, rooted around in the cupboards and offered John two paracetamol from his open palm. John grunted his thanks and took the tablets. A moment later, Sherlock handed John tea and warmed his hand around his own mug.
“He was doing well in his work, was expecting a promotion. He socialises a lot with his work colleagues but because he likes them, not because he has to. His suit is new and expensive so he was on his way out to a social engagement but wanted to impress someone or keep up an image.” He flew down to the man’s feet and pointed “His shoes are also new, never yet worn outside but worn around the house to break them in. His watch is new, a gift from a girlfriend, because there is no sign of a tan mark. Also his old, plainer watch is there on his bedside cabinet and he does still have the matching tan mark meaning he prefers to wear that one. He plays with a five-a-side football team in a park league every Saturday. He has consumed ecstasy and cannabis in the past but not recently.”
“What on earth are we doing out here, Sherlock?” asked John, keeping pace with the long-legged detective as he strode down the garden path towards the arbour.
Sherlock concentrated on counting his steps. His directions had been very specific, necessary in this labyrinth of medieval pathways overflowing with people, all seemingly shouting at each other. Ten more steps, turn left, thirty steps, turn right, one hundred and eleven steps, face left and stop.
“I most certainly did, my love. Did you think I expected you to spend ten days looking at ruins, churches and going surfing?” John laughs at the idea of Sherlock on a surfboard. “And it’s a really good one. Actually, it’s a case within a case.”
Rapidly buttoning his shirt he began to quantify John’s reactions. Sherlock knew John had been watching him, had felt the intensity of his stare before even turning around. In the second that he had surveyed his flatmate, Sherlock observed slightly dilated pupils, a slackness of the mouth and jaw, and a number of micro expressions flitting across John’s face in rapid progression – delight, curiosity and guilt.
“Ok, and please, call me Eoin. Well, my predecessor, Professor Aidan O’Neill, was head of archaeology here for 40 years. He was a great man, never stopped moving with the new technologies and techniques. He was the first to document the story.”
Mary stared at her screen in fascination as Anthea turned to say something to the person behind her. Molly Hooper was practically unrecognisable, wearing all black with a stab vest, tactical belt and carrying a Sig P230 handgun at chest level and a determined tilt of her chin as she signalled ‘up’ to Anthea.
day, a one word text was sent to four different phones; “Smith”. Ten seconds later, Sherlock, John and Lestrade each received a text from Mycroft demanding their presence at the Diogenes. They went without question.
The first slap on his arse stung and Sherlock recoiled. It was rapidly followed by a soothing stroke from the same hand. The second slap was harder and burned slightly. The next slaps came in quick succession, some just on one cheek, some on both. Sherlock arched his back up, presenting his arse for more. He deserved this after all for failing everyone, would give John whatever he wanted. The next slap came hard, fingers making contact with his balls and Sherlock whimpered. John eased up, stroking his hand gently across the hot, red flesh and gently stroking Sherlock’s beautifully displayed anus with a single fingertip.
He was getting closer! He knew that sound. It was a voice, a familiar voice. Sherlock kept kicking up, reaching out. He became aware of more sounds now, beeping and the soft, comfortable nothingness was being replaced by a brightness, a harshness that made his eyes hurt. Something was urging him on, to keep trying though, even though his body was beginning to ache with the effort. He took another deep breath.
That man is watching me, there's someone behind me. Military, moving quickly, shit,! Not the dogs. A third. No, don’t do that! Take your hand off….
“You said you were working with the police. Where’s your warrant, I know my rights, you can’t go barging around people’s homes -“ his words fell on deaf ears as Sherlock and John were already sprinting away, heading towards the side gate, John deftly hurdling over two croquet hoops on the way. Evan Armitage gave chase. “Oi you bastards, come back here!”
Sherlock was the only one who had not been directly exposed to the bacteria. He went in search of a Sunday opening Chemist with the prescriptions John had written and returned within less than an hour. Emelia’s were in liquid form, John’s were tablets the size of horse pills.
John’s face displayed his mind’s reactions to this announcement; relief, surprise and finally delight.
In case you are unfamiliar with the expression, Babygro, I believe they are known as Onesies in other parts of the world. They are cotton all-in-one stretchy baby clothes with poppers down the front and enclosed feet
The blue-in-this-soft-light eyes flicked up to his face in surprise and swarmed across John’s face, deducing. John sat back and let him. Sherlock might be better able to tell him how he was feeling about this than he knew himself.
With that, Sherlock headed back out into the rain and his next destination, Serbia. One last place before he could go home. To John.
John’s eyebrows flew up at this statement. This was Sherlock Holmes, who had mastered Hungarian in a weekend. Apparently, one challenge came in the fact that Irish, unlike most other European languages, was not rooted in Greek and Latin. As a result, familiar letters made completely different sounds to those Sherlock was accustomed to.
“Jesus Sherlock, that was fucking gorgeous. If I’d known marriage would do this, I’d have proposed a lot sooner. Are you OK, love?”
Stomping around the garden in circles, Sherlock paused occasionally to rub behind Redbeard’s ears. The circles were drawing in, tighter and tighter and Sherlock began to pull at his curls, yanking at them in big handfuls.
The amber glow of the street light tinged the top of Sherlock’s curls as John sat above him, turning some of them auburn in contrast to the black of the rest. Sherlock’s eyes were screwed up tight, his head thrown back as a long, deep moan escaped his plump lips. John was intoxicated by the sight, the contrast of rose lips and plum glans against pale skin and every muscle and sinew visible as Sherlock strained underneath him.  John wanted to brand that pale skin with his teeth.
This fic is my beloved (only) child, and I will NOT abandon it, fear not! It is receiving constant attention, but my ability to manage a school schedule and applying to jobs and also add to this in significant ways is, uh, well, it's better than it was, but still not great. I might turn it into monthly updates just so I don't put anyone under any illusions and disappoint anyone (myself included).
S walked to the opposite side of the room, where a small door led to a corner closet. Since most professional dancers were ruthlessly pushed to keep a strict diet and workout regimen, they might hide snacks nearby to tide them over before or after performances. This small closet might hold the key to John’s future happiness.
It wasn’t the cleverest he thought he might do, but…he smirked absently and grunted, “Trrr...rrrap.”
“You’re smiling!” The voice sounded accusatory. And familiar. Deep, hoarse, slightly stilted, like--
John gaped after him, wondering just what in the world that meant. He’d only asked one question, for God’s sake!
Which was saying something because he was very dead. Were there degrees of deadness? Was “deadness” a word? He folded his pale hands in front of his face, cherishing the unbroken line of thought.
He reeled for a moment, then gripped the shorter man’s arms, holding them down and away from his face in case another punch was coming. John’s eyes widened as he struggled against the hold but was unable to break free.
He froze when she turned and caught his eye. Her brown eyes seemed sharper than the last time he’d seen her, but maybe that was his own changing perceptions. Regardless, he could not help but notice those eyes flicking between his protective stance and the prey he was trying to protect.
, he thought as he began to eat, heedless of the massacre taking place around him. The brain was the best part anyway. All those memories...
John looked at it dumbly. Oh. He’d still not answered the question. “Afghanistan.” He put up a hand to stop the dead man from responding. “And yes, that was all quite correct. What else can you tell about me just from looking?” He handed the phone back.
He shook his head, dark, damp curls sticking to his face, unheeded. The scent was too distracting. He had to get away from the others.
John’s flinch said differently. He looked toward the door. It seemed he was still harboring some misgivings about following a dead man.
Mycroft met the other man’s eyes and allowed his lips to give the barest twitch of amusement. “Noted. Now, report, if you please.”
I'm currently a couple chapters ahead and will try to post weekly (emphasis on "try"), likely on Saturdays, like today!! Please be patient with me!
He turned back to the door and started pounding on it again, shouting, “Oy, Cheekbones! What did you do to my friends?”
Sherlock needed John to want him, to need him so badly John lost all control. He needed the reassurance that he wasn’t the failure he felt right now. He still remembered how it had felt when no one had ever wanted him and every time John looked at him with
Just as they begin the descent into Dublin airport, John texts Professor Eoin Fitzgerald to confirm their arrival. He had spoken to the Head of Forensic Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Dublin twice from Lestrade’s office when he had first stumbled across the disappearance of the Ballytoohin Hoard, Professor Fitzgerald having written a number of papers on the subject. At  first John’s enquiries had been met first with surprise and later, distrust.
Sherlock had the phone in his hand when it beeped. It was now 10.30 and his resolve had finally crumbled and a plan devised to get John away from this insipid woman. Really, John would be grateful in the long run when he realised what Sherlock had saved him from.
Three days later, Sherlock had slept, washed and eaten at Michael’s insistence, and a call had been placed to Daddy who was on his way to collect him. Again. Nosing through Michael’s belongings while he was at work in the shop, Sherlock leafed through a pile of papers. He was astonished to find three drawings of someone who looked an awful lot like himself in the pile; design drawings of a curly-haired angular man in a slim-fitting dark suit, single button jacket and a dark grey shirt open at the neck. Sherlock was looking down at his grimy jeans and baggy, grey t-shirt when the shop bell heralded Daddy’s arrival. Sherlock stole one of the pictures and shoved it in his pocket as he made his way down to face the recriminations. Again.
So concludes my story and apology, the longest of my life. Who would have thought one phrase ' an unintentional apricot' could result in so many words. I hope you have enjoyed it. Please leave comments and you can find me on Tumblr as
On their way home they stopped in at Barts to visit Greg. His head injury was healing well and although he would need some physiotherapy, would be back to work within six months according to the consultant. There had been an unexpected outcome from the whole disaster; upon hearing of his attack, Molly Hooper had flown to his bedside and declared her feelings for Lestrade, who it appeared, fully reciprocated. John had asked Sherlock if he had known about this development but Sherlock had merely shrugged. John suspected he had completely missed the signs and didn’t want to admit it.
“Your generation have had so many more opportunities than mine. I made sure you had the freedom to embrace all that life had to offer you, to truly be yourself, body and soul. I did not always have that freedom, Sherlock. I do not want to upset you but there was a time that marriage and a family were the last things in the world I wanted. I too have seen darkness, experienced self-destruction but I was rescued”.
“No, that’s not what I was thinking at all. I am now perfectly aware that you are a psychotic killer who lets nothing get in her way. But I do feel just a little bit sorry for you. I was smiling because of all the love I have in my life, all the beautiful, glorious little moments of happiness and joy. You don’t even have those feelings for the amazing child you brought into the world. You have no idea what that means. It doesn’t matter what happens now. You are already dead”
“Oh Sherlock, my extraordinary love, I need to keep those arms pinned down again, to spread your knees with mine and lay between you. I love to just look at you when you are like that, like I could do anything at all with you and you would let me. Do you know what I would most want to do, hmm?” John kissed Sherlock gently on the cheek “I would just ease myself onto your heavenly dick, slowly, slowly and then pull back up again and do it all over again. Time and time again until you begged me to let you go all the way in. You do beg me, my sweet, don’t you?”
Sherlock casts all his usual reserve to one side. He is overwhelmed by the moment. Tears fill his eyes as he wraps John in his arms and kisses him so tenderly that John is undone. Burying his head in Sherlock’s shoulder he sobs, “I love you,” and as they always have done, they cling to one another, ignoring the applause and cheers from the rest of the room.
“I want you to make me a promise, Sherlock. Promise me that whatever else happens to us or between us, whatever dangers we get ourselves into that you will always go to Charlotte. Please, promise me that you will protect her”.
“Come here, John” Sherlock enveloped the exhausted John is his arms and the pair of them stood, swaying ever so slightly, both considering bursting into tears. Sherlock rallied first.
Three years previously, Sherlock had been alone, lying on the sofa deep in his Mind Palace searching for clues to the disappearance of a sixty four year old woman from the local swimming pool. He became aware of a disturbance in the walls, a golden light seeping through, a peculiar rippling and shifting in the air. Opening his eyes, Sherlock shot up off the sofa. Where the fireplace usually stood, solid and brown, was now a flickering golden whirlpool of light, shimmering with colours and energy. As Sherlock gawped, a man walked through the middle of the whirlpool, coming to a stop on their rug. He looked exactly like Sherlock, except that he was bearded and was wearing what Sherlock considered to be an extremely good red coat. He especially admired the collar.
“I had to stay on the sofa after you did. I was so hard, I couldn’t move. If you hadn’t got off me when you did…”
“Yours or mine? Still not a patch on that uniform. We need to find you more excuses to wear it.” Sherlock breathes into John’s ear, dipping his head for a languid lick along at the point where John’s jaw meets his ear.
Sherlock closed his eyes but turned both arms palm upwards again. John saw all the tiny pinprick scars inside the joints and as he ran his fingers over the line of the vein, bright blue against the contrast of the palest of skin, he noticed that the injection sites went nearly all the way down Sherlock’s arms, ending just centimetres before his wrists.
“He was not revenging me. I really was over Mark surprisingly quickly, he was probably right to end things. Especially as I learned this afternoon is that my brother had been having an affair with Mark for the last two years. Apparently, Evan was far more in love with him than I had ever been. When Mark broke up with me, he also broke it off with Evan, wanting a clean break, a new start”.
A young man is waiting for them at the top of the second floor stairs at the entrance to the Anthropology department.
For the prompt 'Cuddles', this was supposed to go one way but grew its own legs, veered off course and turned into 100%, pure, unadulterated fluff. Don't say you weren't warned
Molly Hooper met Sherlock in Bart’s mortuary. Greeting him with smile over Mark Willis’s body, she got to the point immediately, knowing better than to try and make small talk with Sherlock.
Twenty four hours later, though and Sherlock was making no progress. At the crime scene he had rapidly deduced that the nanny had been a plant, there to undercover sensitive information on the woman’s multi-million internet business. He had successfully identified the man who had claimed to be the nanny’s boyfriend and they had gone looking for him, sure he had the child. However, all leads had run cold and there was no sign of either the man or the child.
“I have a good feeling about this, Sherlock I don’t think you need to worry too much.” As much as he would like to say something, Michael always treated the things clients told him as highly confidential. When someone trusts you enough to measure their balls, you have to guard that trust. He was pretty confident that John was mad about Sherlock, but it was not his place to say so.
Sherlock was triumphant “As I suspected! Quick John, we must find the mallets, I think we may well find the murder weapon. They must be in the shed”.
