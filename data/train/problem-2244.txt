The man with his head on the mattress stirred.
“Come along.  Don’t make a fuss.”  The suspect dragged John towards the door.  “Act natural.”
Sherlock made a face and shifted his posture as if he wasn’t quite sure what position to be in when he answered.  “Many thousands of years ago this area made a pact with the fairy realm to offer up mortal sacrifices.”
“Oh, John…” I moaned, rolling my head back to stare up at the ceiling.
“You’re welcome.”  Sherlock answered, trying desperately not to look at his flatmate’s naked body and failing miserably.
“Odd.”
“What would have been a failure?” John queried.
“Shower is quickest.”  John answered as he tossed aside his button down and pulled off his vest.  “Do you need help out of the tub?”
And with that Sherlock was gone.
“You don’t want me anymore…” Sherlock whispered.
“You were becoming one of us… You had no way of knowing how much time was passing.”  Sherlock stated as he sat down in the grass.  The grasses were slowly taking on color, beginning to yellow.
I squeezed my internal muscles down below, feeling him lodged within me.  “No… You’re perfect.”
They settled together.  For a long time they were quiet.  Silently they stared at the fire and shared wine, drinking from the same cup as John rested against Sherlock’s chest.
Obediently the two stood, their hands raised before the king.
Sherlock reached out with his free hand to touch John’s cheek.
Mary sobered and lightly touched John’s hand.  “The one who brought you here… Were you to be their mate?”
“You should have told me.” John agreed.  “But you didn’t.  Instead I learned it from a sister you didn’t even remember you had.”
“Because you were forced?”
Sherlock turned his attention from the prisoner to John, squinting his eyes a bit.  “I do this for your own protection, my lord.”
Mycroft bowed low, still smirking to himself.
“Where did you learn to do that?”
Sherlock stared at John, his lips touching the lord’s base and his tongue caressing the underside of his cock.
That alarmed John and he bit his lips to silence his trembling breath.  Sherlock kissed him lightly before scooting down John’s body.  John couldn’t help himself, he gave a soft moan of encouragement.
John looked down at himself and shrugged.   “I can take a variety of forms.”
It startled him to find that the story was over and a band of gold lay in the palm of his right hand.  At some point he had pulled the ring all the way off without noticing.  The warm circle of gold was heavy in the palm of his hand.  Quickly he returned it to his finger as Molly got up and began to gather her things.
Sherlock took the cup and drank from it before holding it out to John.
Sherlock frowned.  “Of course you have a choice.  You think I would keep you against your will?”
John sat up again and stared at Sherlock.  “Let me… smell you.”
John found himself on the ground as the coils loosened.  Scrambling to his feet he kicked the coils as hard as he could.
“I meant what I said before… I don’t have friends… I just have one.  You.”  Sherlock rubbed his face with the back of his hand.  “Something happened out there… I don’t know what I saw, but it wasn’t a hound.”
Thank you all for reading!
“Famished…” John replied as he yawned.  “Sorry… I was up all night… as you can imagine.”
Sherlock smirked, feeling more in his element away from woods and quaint country B&B beds.  London was his city.  Confidence returned and he was no longer the unsure, vulnerable man on the bed getting his dick sucked.  No… Sherlock was a consulting detective living in a flat with a landlady who made biscuits every week.  Criminals cursed his name because he solved their clever ruses and brought them to justice.  London was home.  “We have to go to St. Bart’s.”
“I’m still very sorry.”
“Why would you expect that?” John asked, sitting on the couch beside his daughter.
The path was dusty and steep.  Many times John Watson’s boots skid on loose rocks and dirt, sending a haze of dust up around him.  His hands caught in the ground to keep himself from sliding backwards to his death.  For a long moment he gasped for air and then shifted the weight of his pack.  A long time ago when he was a boy he had been very good at climbing up the slide.  The experience was the same but he was out of practice and he was much heavier than his child self.  As he took another step he heard a crack and lost his balance, landing on his knees and scraping up his hands as he slid back a several inches.  Instinctively he reached for the vegetation at the side of the path to keep himself from sliding back further.
“Welcome to the family.”
“It doesn’t matter.  It would have been a failure.”
What was I supposed to tell him?  How was I supposed to ask about what he did with Eurus?
Sherlock reached out and lightly traced the scar on John’s shoulder… The one that had ended his military career, ending the only life he had ever felt comfortable in.  His friends never understood.  They attempted to cheer him but he was jealous they still had something that he didn’t.  Sherlock moved in closer and kissed the scar.  The way Sherlock caressed it sent shivers down John’s spine that had nothing to do with the chill of the room.  Sherlock kissed his lips carefully, wrapping his arm around John’s shoulder.  “Can I fuck you?”
There was no Rosie Watson.  Whether or not she existed in this reality, Sherlock could not tell.  But neither she nor Mary made an appearance to tempt Watson away.  Watson seemed content to stay in Sherlock’s rooms without mentioning either of them.
“I am aware of that.”  Sherlock answered.  “Do you want to engage in coitus with me?”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah… look at him!  He’s freaking out!”  John pushed Irene aside and settled between Sherlock’s knees.  Lightly he patted Sherlock’s thigh until the other man looked him in the eye.  Keeping eye contact John leaned down to lightly lip at the glans.
“Are we talking about your den in the city or… something else?” John asked carefully.
Sherlock looked at him in surprise.
John’s fingers slipped into the crevice of Sherlock’s ass and teased the tight sphincter.
The crowd of Fae cheered and became very excited.
“And do what?”
“It makes this too real.  I could not resist you if things went too far.”  Watson admitted.
“You married… A woman.”  Sherlock was having trouble concentrating on his words with John sucking on him.
“I… I was always on top.”  John admitted.  “Lord’s privilege…”
I found myself with my ass in the air and my shoulders on the mattress.  I was in pure bliss.  John’s fingers probed and prodded until he opened me enough to push inside.  I still felt the burn and the sense of being full, but it was bearable.  John’s cock seemed to know where to rub inside of me and I could see stars.
“And your body pleasurable…”
“A bloody good one, I imagine.”  Sherlock answered, pushing his fingers into John’s tight orifice.  “Better than I…”
If John could imagine one word to describe his approaching fatherhood it was, “shock.”  First came the surprise that his mere weeks of sleeping with his new bride caused the pregnancy.  Then it was the overwhelming sense of panic that came with bringing a new life into an imperfect world.  What if war broke out and he was asked to defend the realm?  Sherlock’s realm…  What if he died?  Because he knew he would give his life to defend Sherlock.  What sort of father put the needs of his king and lover before his own blood?  What if he failed at being a father or the child grew up to resent him?  What if his child felt neglected or unloved?
“My lord?”  Mary finally lifted her chin to look at John properly.  “You would find me a husband?”
My eyes caught on the round divot below his clavicle.  I adjusted my position so I could see the exit wound on his back, over the scapula.  Lightly I traced the edge of the scar tissue with my finger.  There was a long hypertrophic scar where they repaired what had to be a broken scapula.
“Remember?  You’re not gay.”
Sherlock relaxed upon feeling John’s seed in his own fist.  Regaining his strength he wrapped himself around the other man.  “Mine.”
“What happened to them?”
Sherlock stared at his friend… His ONLY friend, naked and torn by the task he had been given… To shag Sherlock.  Sherlock had every confidence that John would succeed.  After all, John enjoyed sex.  John wasn’t an awkward, exploratory fumble with a roommate at uni.  John had experience and skill.  So why was he giving Sherlock a look of pity?  Oh… Sherlock hadn’t yet replied.  “Is there a problem?”
“Watson, stay put.  You will be retrieved tomorrow.”
“Don’t you see?  I’ve corrupted you and forced you into sharing my bed.  I’ve tainted your soul.”
“Come now, everyone wants something.”
“What?”  Sherlock gasped from John’s back somewhere near his scapula.
“Yes… I’m just… I wasn’t expecting that.”
“Want what, my lord John?”  Sherlock coaxed with each squeeze and tug.
“Get up.”  Sherlock answered, rubbing his face with the back of his hand.
John got up from his chair and paced the room.  “That’s not fair!  I didn’t know who she was!  I ended it before I found out who she was!”
“I’d feel better if your army was standing there with us.”
“But Mary…”
I bit my lip to cover my pain.
I awoke to a sensation of warmth on my penis.  Looking down, I found John suckling on me.  It felt amazing.  “John?”
“Should I be asking someone else?”
“I want to satisfy you.” Sherlock answered, his head on John’s shoulder.
John sat back, shaking his head at his family.  Picking up his tea, he glanced at his naked ring finger.  It was time to move on.
--Fini
“I’ll send you the footage.  Don’t make any plans until you see it.  I know you… Good day.”  Mycroft hung up and Sherlock ended his side of the call.
“No… Let me see.”  Sherlock insisted as he pulled John’s hand away and pulled him down onto the bed.  Straddling the lord’s body, he leaned in to investigate the old wound, tracing it with his fingertip.  “Is this why you deny yourself pleasure?”
“It’s none of your concern.”
John was never hers because he has always been mine.  Even when he was with Mary he was mine.  I know that now.
Sherlock briefly drew a blank.  What was his desire?  Did he really want to experiment on how quickly he could escalate the situation so Watson shared his bed?  Or was there something else there?  Perhaps it was a need for a deeper connection between them.  At the very least he knew he did not want the cold, medical procedure.  If there was to be touching, it had to excite both of them.  Or neither.
Sherlock managed to take a couple of steps, enough to find support on the door of the house he was staying at.  Something hard and hot breeched him and he cried out as the magnificent cock slid home within him.  It was unlike anything he had ever imagined during masturbation.  It was more than fingers or a dildo.  There was a living, breathing male daring to touch him in ways he had only dreamed about.
“What’s a lie?”
In the summer Sherlock went without clothing, opting instead of a bed sheet draped around his body.  John made no comment on his bed sheet but the former soldier did look… How could he not?  And when Sherlock felt particularly naughty he arranged himself on the couch with only a small corner of the sheet to tastefully cover his genitals, watching John go about his day.  Occasionally he “accidentally” pulled the corner of sheet away and met John’s eyes defiantly.
“I’m here with you, love.”  John sighed.  The endearment slipped from his lips before he could really think about it.  “I’m here.”
“How was your appointment?” I asked John.
“Fauns are all about sex.  They are well suited for it for both giving and receiving.”  Mary gave John a lewd wink.
Sherlock sobered and absently patted John’s shoulder.  “There’s many things you’ll forget while you’re here.  But I know your name… And I’ll never let you forget it completely.”
“What?  No.” Sherlock made a face.
“We’ve already established there wasn’t a bomb…”
“Yes… we are.”  John whispered, licking his lips.
There was a brief knock at the door before John walked in, holding Rosie.  Quickly he took in Molly’s and my position.  “Sorry… I’m interrupting something.”
“I’m so sorry, John.”
John lifted his head and lightly kissed Sherlock’s lips.  “She doesn’t say.  Just that we will be together.”
I sat back and licked my lips as I stared up at him.
“I love you too.” Sherlock answered softly.
“You love me.”
“Oh Gods…” John moaned.
“I… I don’t command anything.”  John crossed his arms over his chest.  “My people fight for me because they believe in me.  They believe our cause is just.  We don’t own people where I come from.  They serve me freely.  You are all free.  You may leave if you like.  But when you’re under my protection you are free.  Is that what you want, Sherlock?  You’re not suited for slavery.”
John’s face turned red.  “Perhaps Mrs. Hudson will take Rosie for the night…”
“Watson here.”
“Fuck… Sherlock…”
“But not the way I love you.”
Early the next day John found Sherlock by the water.  The faun looked miserable.  His arms were wrapped around his legs and he was nearly curled up into a ball of misery.
Mary gave John a nervous glance before taking a step back for her skirts to reveal that she had been standing over a fallen dagger.  “Your highness… My lord husband…”
John kissed him, pushing his tongue into the other man’s mouth to silence him.  Pulling away from the messy kiss he hissed at the king.  “Shut up.”
Mary sighed and suddenly in the place of her legs was a fish tail.  “The tail is my Glamour.”
They watched two episodes together before Rosie rolled off the couch and onto the floor to play with her toys.  By the time the third episode ended she was ready for dinner.
“Hush… I have admired you for nine years, my lord Watson.  Since I grew to manhood I have dreamed of you taking me in your arms and filling me.  Please?”
“It is what it is…” Sherlock answered from where he stood behind his paramour.
Sherlock numbly nodded.
Sherlock moaned and rolled his eyes.  “John, you see but you do not observe.”
“The guest chambers in the south tower will do.”  Sherlock responded.
Moriarty frowned.  “Oh poo… You’re no longer mortal.”
“What’s ‘impregnate’?” Rosie asked.
“Then do as I ask.”  The voice replied.  “You have two hours.”  The gun pulled back and the flap squeaked shut.
“I do.”  John followed Sherlock to the local inn, conscious of the curious looks he was receiving.  But as far as anyone knew he was just a normal human, right?  The room was small but the bed was big enough for two people.  “Are you sure?”
“What did she say?”
Sherlock seemed to deflate, his rump sinking to his heels.
“Thank you for coming to see me.”  Scott Trevor stated.  His hands were carefully threaded together on his desk blotter, his emotions barely in control.  Years had not been kind to the older gentleman.  There was deep pain in his lined face.
And it hurt to know this was the only way I could have John.
“Damn centaurs…” Moriarty muttered.  Behind him Sherlock was released and dumped to the ground without care.  The faun landed in a heap.  “I’ll be back later to play!”  And with that he slithered off.
“Sherlock.” John called to him.
John wrapped his arms around his king’s sweaty back, holding him close.  “You didn’t answer.”
--TBC
“I will.”
“It’s… fine… Why are you so…?”
“No, I mean… I want to do this with you, not have it done to me.  Does that make sense?”
“Of course not.  But she IS my mother.” Sherlock retorted.  “Where do you think I get it from?”
“I have to do something.”  John whispered.
“Good.”  John yawned.  “I feel like I haven’t slept for days.  I could use a nap.”
“Was it horrible?” John turned to look at me.
“You summoned me by using an obvious path of bread crumbs.”
“Say yes.”
John scooted back.  “Sacrifice?  Am I going to die?”
Sherlock kissed him again.  Eventually they did leave the bed to go find the shower and dinner.
“You admitted you like her.” John stated smugly.
Sherlock pulled away, licking the seed from his bottom lip before crawling up John’s body to kiss the scar on his shoulder.
Molly stood on the other side of the door and I realized that I was completely exposed.  Quickly I pulled my sheet up around my waist as Molly blinked at John.  John passed her and she looked in on me.  There was a frown on her face as she looked back over her shoulder where John had gone.
“Are you homosexual?”
“Even if you don’t want me…  I’m still yours.  I’ll stay here until my dying day and you never have to touch me or think of me in that way.  But I will stay and I will be content with just my right hand for company.  Please, Sherlock… For the love of God, say something.”  Did he really just casually mention masturbation to Sherlock?  Not that he had a lot of opportunity to masturbate these days.  Usually it was limited to the shower and even then Sherlock had no concept of privacy and often walked in to brush his teeth or use the toilet.  The bathroom door in Sherlock bedroom had no lock.
“He sounded like Kylo Ren.”  Sherlock responded.
“If I do she will kill me.”
“We can finish that later.”  Sherlock stated impatiently.
“This is Sherlock.”  The man smacked the slave on the back of the head.
“Not women…” Sherlock sighed helplessly.
“Because you are the most magnificent lord I have ever met.”
“They weren’t that big!”  John insisted, trying to back away but the genitals were connected to him.
“I love you.”  The words came out without him meaning to say them.
Sherlock sat down on the bed and was immediately his thigh was commandeered by the werewolf to be used as a pillow.  “I don’t know anything about werewolves.”
John gave Sherlock’s genitals a wide berth, focusing on his hip instead before following down his thigh.
The soldiers at the table erupted in excitement and amusement.
Sherlock blinked rapidly before taking a deep breath.  “I want to…”
Sherlock released both hands and dismounted before rolling onto his back.  “Come here.  I want to feel you…  Feel you take me.”
“You don’t… Love him do you?”
“Gods…” John cursed.
John gave a gentle bounce and a squeeze.  “Go ahead.”
With the last of his strength he pulled himself up the last few feet to the edge of the embankment he was climbing.  His ankle protested every step but he managed to haul himself up onto the edge to look at the clearing beyond.  There was a stream that ran parallel with the cliff he had climbed.  Overhanging the stream was an old oak tree.  On hands and knees he crawled several yards to the tree and set his pack down beside him to pull out his walkie.
“Her whim to burn your heart.”
“It will help with your pregnancy.  Babies with bonded parents develop with fewer complications.” John stood up and crossed the room to sit in his chair.
John bit his lips and slipped his hand under the waistband of the pajamas.  His hand closed around Sherlock’s length.
“I told you, it’s Greg.” John smirked and turned to address the werewolf.  “Thank you for saving me.”
“Well… That’s convenient.”
“They didn’t want you?” John challenged, licking him again from base to tip, teasing the glans.
Watson pulled his hand away and gently pushed Sherlock’s hand away from his crotch.  “Do not say such things.”
“She deserves more.”  John sighed.
John closed his eyes and tried not to think about who was watching or why.
“You pissed someone off.”
John sighed and looked to Lord Mycroft.  “Who are you?  You said you were brother to the king?”
I lay back on the bed, my feet on the mattress so I could lift my hips.  If John was to take me, I would have him face to face or not at all.  A part of me wanted to roll over onto my hands and knees and take the more traditional breeding position… But if this was to be my one and only experience with my Alpha, then I wanted to remember what he looked like when he filled me.
“Ah… Gods…” John whimpered and reached down to tangle his fingers in Sherlock’s curls.
“I was unaware slavery was still in practice here.”  Sherlock’s voice spoke.  “We don’t have it where I come from.  I don’t see the point in ordering someone to serve my bed.  I’m not that sort of ruler.”
--FINI
John stared down at his hands.  “Sherlock, please say something.”
Someone with the police officers called out, “Is this the one?”
“I just do!  Goodnight, Holmes!” And with that he was out the door.
John sat up and stared down at the man below him.  “You want me?”
“Bed slaves.”
Watson looked up from his newspaper and caught Sherlock in his sight.  Then his eyes went to the clock on the mantel.  “It is getting late.”
“Sherlock…”
“A please this time?  You must be in a state…” With a judgmental tut she was finally gone, leaving me in peace.
“Can I buy you a drink?” A handsome young man asked, smiling at John.
John pulled back and stared down at him with a smirk.  “Is this what you wanted?”
The detective remained silent.
“No.” John admitted.
“John had to go pick up Rosie.  He’ll be back soon.  He’s not going to leave you like this.”
“I’m waiting…” John teased.
At that moment the entertainment started and so John was unable to respond to Sherlock’s words.
“John!” Molly looked to John, amusement on her face.
John pushed him down on the bed and straddled his body to sit over him.  “What do you want, Lord Sherlock?”
“He seems to think I want something from you.”
John tried not to notice that Sherlock seemed distracted as he continued the slow strip tease.  His trousers were next and he stood up in order to drop them down his legs and kick them away.   “Can I come back?”
“I know.”
“I’ve told you before… At your wedding reception in fact.”
“You are.”  Mary responded and gave him a curtsy.  “My lord.”
“It’s only until we get a vaccine.” Sherlock answered.
Sherlock made a grab for the lube and applied it to his fingers.  Within a few moments he worked his fingers into John before slathering more on his erection.  With some hesitation he pushed in, letting out a shaky breath as he eased himself down into John’s body.
“No!” John shook his head.  “Is that what you thought?”
John smiled.  “Yes… of course.”
I bit my lips and stared at his empty chair.  “I’m pregnant.”
“You are very distracting…” John murmured against his lips.
“Oh shut up!” Mycroft rolled his eyes at John.  “I’m not here to breed him or even touch him… so be silent.”
With every fiber of my being he wished I could include John on that list.
Sherlock jumped at the sound.  “What is it?”
“Why would I do that?”
Sherlock set down his tea and sat at the table.  “Rosie… When your mum died I promised to take care of you and your father.  Your father would like to find someone to share his life with and help take care of you.  He chose me.  Is that alright with you?”
“How was your day?” John asked.
“Untie him.”
“It’s time to turn up the heat.” Sherlock observed.
“Pardon?”
“Yes, he is.” I murmured.
“Dinner?”
“And you can’t join them?”
“How long?”
John grabbed Sherlock’s right hand and placed it on his cock, urging the detective to stroke him to his own completion.  It only took a few tugs before John collapsed, panting for breath.  The former soldier lounged atop the detective.  “That was…”
“A little tight.” John commented, adjusting the top of the glove just over her elbow.
“Molly…”
Rosie gave a nod as she rocked onto her heels and back onto her toes.  Before the pandemic she had been taking ballet lessons in the beginner class for young primary school students.  “Ready!” Rosie chirped.
“How long has it been since you lay with a man?”  Sherlock asked quietly as he spread his fingers.
“You will have me?”
“Oh no you don’t!” Moriarty whispered, covering John’s mouth with his hand.  “Be a good pony and do as you’re told.”
With some difficulty John managed to get out of the tub without injuring either of them in the process.  And then he reached back to help Sherlock up and out, draping him with towel before finding one for himself.
The faun licked his lips and nodded.  “No more spasms.”
“Rosie needs a mother.  You need a wife to give you an heir.” Sherlock answered.  “I swear I will find her and bring her back to you.”
They entered the flat and John went to the bedroom as Sherlock entered the bathroom.  The water turned on in the sink and John watched through the opaque door as the figure at the sink washed.  John set Sherlock’s things aside and toed off his shoes before pulling off his socks.
Sherlock stood up and approached the bars, still naked and beautiful even in the dungeon.  “My lord, John.  I give you my word.  I have no intention of harming you.  I am here for Moriarty.  I am willing to serve your bed if it will keep my identity a secret until I can find my prey.”
John took a deep breath.  “Perhaps it’s for the best.  If she stayed she would be attacked by her enemies.  At least she can go make a fresh start as someone anonymous.”
The other females in the room acknowledged the order.  “Yes, Doctor.”
“I’m not going to slow down!”  John answered.  “I’m wearing less armor so I can run faster.”
“It’s alright.” John whispered into his ear.
“I want a pony.” Rosie informed the detective.
“You don’t know that.”  John replied as he reached into the bedside table for a vial of something.
“Don’t you?” Sherlock responded.
I blinked again.
“I… Where’s Mary?”
My preparations done, I washed my hands and checked my hair before exiting the bathroom to the bedroom.  The light was on and John sat at the edge of the bed wearing a vest and his pants.  His eyes opened wide when he saw me.  “What are you doing?”
--TBC
“But it’s gossip!  Who is this Lord John Watson and why does he have so much control over the king?  Is he planning to overthrow the crown by seducing his way into the king’s bed?  And what of Lady Janine who has been rumored to be the king’s choice for a queen?”
“Yes, m’lord.”  Lestrade answered.  “If that is what you command.”
Sherlock smiled and adjusted his position so he was standing beside the bed between Watson’s open knees.  Gently he leaned down to kiss those lips.  The mustache was rough against his lip and for a moment he wished that Watson was clean shaven.  Deepening the kiss, he pushed Watson back onto the bed, hands desperately trying to undo all the buttons.  Curse Victorian undergarments!  And, of course, Watson was wearing combinations under his shirt and trousers.  Sherlock made a soft moan of complaint against Watson’s lips.
Not that Sherlock ever considered taking another werewolf mate… and according to the research he could technically still sleep around until John bit him back and laid claim to him.  By biting John he had proclaimed to the werewolf world that John was “taken.”  They would smell John’s blood on him and know that John was off limits.
“Oh my god!” John cried out as the back door shut behind them.  Hyperventilating a bit, he placed his hands on his knees and leaned over.  “I thought I was going to die of laughter.”
“Noted, Dr. Sawyer.”
“I know.”  John made a face at his tea.  It occurred to me that he was bringing up Irene yet again.
A bundle of warmth was deposited in my lap.  I blinked and found Rosie Watson rising to a stand on my thighs and using my chest to keep her balance.
“I love you.” I answered.
“No clue?  No clue why?  Oh why, our king has his eye on you?  You his champion and his knight in shining armor, valiant and brave… More than any other knight?  You don’t know?” Moriarty grinned like a mad man, a flicker of glee in his brown eyes.  “Don’t know why you of all are gifted with his highness, lord of the bed chamber?  To take him deep… Deeper than anyone?  You think you know him?  Know our king because he’s had you?”
John leaned in closer to Sherlock, sniffing at his neck.  “You’re… a lone wolf… like me.”
“Go ahead and finish.”  John took the organ into his mouth again, sucking at it as he throated it and was rewarded with a feral grunt from Sherlock and several warm pulses down his throat.  Pulling back a bit he tasted what Sherlock expelled.  It wasn’t really like his pack mates… but it was palatable.  Sherlock would make an acceptable mate.  Of course John wouldn’t be able to fuck him for very long… the man lacked stamina.  But stamina could be built… like the human women who had bred with the pack.
John pulled his hand away from his face and stared back at Sherlock, one eyebrow raised.
“This won’t be the only time, will it?  I don’t know if I can…”
“You aren’t attracted to me.”  I stood up and went to my bedroom, shutting the door behind me.  I leaned against it as if to use my body as a barricade.
John watched until the bedroom door shut and then he went to the sink to rinse Sherlock’s blood from his fingers.
“We’re not talking about a little grope like Trevor had with you back in secondary… no… a full grown warg, empowered by his instincts to invade your body.  If you are pack to him he will take you.  You won’t want that.”
“No… It’s ok.”  John reassured the man beside him, taking his hand and holding it.  “I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“But he’s my mate.”  Sherlock responded, still confused.
Sherlock shrugged.  “Should that bother me?”
Sherlock returned to the bedroom completely naked.  His lower lip was still pink from the stain of the lipstick.  Dark still ringed his eyes, remnants of his mascara and eye liner.
“But you know how to handle it.” The peacock answered.  Leaning in, she kissed him softly on the lips.  “Happy Birthday.”
The slave slowly sat up and flicked his ice blue eyes to meet Watson’s which caused Watson to shiver.  His skin was pale and his torso thin.  Like Lestrade his genitals were decorated with jewelry.
John made a face and then stood up.  “I wonder why…” And with that he was gone.
Sherlock had no idea what Watson meant.  But not wanting to appear ignorant of whatever nightly ritual they seemed to have developed, he agreed.
“Nonsense.” Sherlock answered.
“I felt her scratch my back.”  John answered.
“You should have someone do that for you.”  Sherlock remarked from where he lay, staring up at the ceiling.
Sherlock cleared his throat and resumed his work.
“I know… I looked at your tags.”
“Everywhere.”
I shook my head in denial, unable to say it.
“They were all my mates.”
“Lord John… Lady Mary…”
“A little.”
“We’ve had dinner before…”
“She will not kill you if I command it.  Lay down your dagger.”
Sherlock straightened up and stared at John.  “What?”
I finished swallowing and rubbed the remainder from my lips with the back of my hand.  The taste wasn’t horrible.  A part of me felt betrayed.  It could have been better for the both of us.  But another part of me felt I deserved it for my part in getting Mary killed.  John needed release and I would give him that.  At least there was no chance of accidental pregnancy if John were to use my body for his sexual release.
“No… But you need to be loved.”  Sherlock whispered, kissing John deeply.
“Fuck…” John moaned and then covered his mouth with his hand.
Mary’s eyes were on the bound hands.  Otherwise she made no mention of the connection.
John reached out, finding Sherlock’s head on the other pillow.  Carefully he pulled the other man closer, wrapping an arm around his head.  “I’m sorry.”
I stared at the screen in shock.
“Please stop saying mistress.”  John moaned as they passed by a courtyard.
“That’s not an excuse!”  John’s eyes looked dangerous.  “Who is he?  Can I meet him?”
Sherlock climbed back up John’s body, lightly kissing his cheek before settling down beside him.
“She must think…” John began and rubbed his face.
“Yes.” I answered, kissing him softly on the lips.  “But I’ll settle for you just moving in for now.”
John grunted in reply.
No, it wasn’t.
Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock padded up the stairs in fishnet stockings.  His heels were in his hand, coat wrapped around him to cover most of the dress.
They lay for a time, both recovering from their excitement.
“Her?”  Sherlock blinked rapidly, wiping at his eyes.
John had a therapy session the next day.  We got word that he had been found unconscious with a tranquilizer dart in his thigh.  Further investigation revealed that the person who owned the residence had been dead for three weeks, her body stuffed into the airing cupboard.
“Take good care of your nana and papa.” Sherlock kissed her other temple.
Sherlock smiled and leaned in to kiss John’s forehead.
“I’m a consulting detective.” Sherlock answered.
John paused, staring down at the consulting detective.  “I can’t be your master.  Because I’m not anyone’s master.”
“Is he dead or alive?”  Mycroft asked.
John stretched the muscle, scissoring his fingers to create space.  When Sherlock was relaxed enough for two fingers he added a third.
John stood for a long time watching teen faun sob into his knees.  Sherlock pulled him away and they continued on their way.  “You regret being brought to the Fairy Realm… Then why are you bringing me?”  John asked quietly.
“What was it about?”  John asked.
--TBC
“Sherlock?” John moved to dismount my thighs.  I held him still.  “Are you alright?”
Sherlock grunted in reply and undid he trousers and pants.  John caught a glimpse of the fact that Sherlock wasn’t erect.  There was no excitement in what they were doing.
John continued to pace the hallway, working off excess energy by traveling between 221A and 221C.  Occasionally he climbed the stairs to 221B but he always came back down again.  It was the night of the full moon and his body craved touch but his pack mate ignored him.  The four days since John left the flat not once did Sherlock come looking for him.
“What do you want, Sherlock?” John asked, very much aware that the man below him was gently humping the bed.
John blinked at the sudden request.  But he could always give as good as he got.  “Do you have condoms and lube?”
Molly hastily found where she had left off and returned to the story.  For a time only her voice filled the flat.
The scenery passed by in a whirlwind of color and textures.  Sometimes grainy, sometimes wet.  There was stone and leaves, there was grass and forest.  Finally John slowed when he felt Sherlock shift against his withers, which was at the base of his human spine.
Sherlock kissed him deeply, wrapping his arms around John’s back to hold him still as he kissed.  One hand slipped down to tease, pushing a fingertip into a tight orifice.
“My lord, we can’t do that!”  Mary protested and turned to Lestrade.  “He didn’t mean it.  Don’t tell his highness he said that. You’re going to get us killed!”  The last phrase was directed at her husband.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Sherlock Holmes knew that his new flatmate was a former slave, he just wasn’t sure what kind.  There were many slaves… some cleaned house, some raised children.  Others fought in wars for their masters.  It was obvious that John Watson had been some sort of slave, but he had earned his freedom.
“If it was…?” I replied cautiously.
“What did he do?”
“No other Alpha will want you.”
We closed escrow on a new house!  Yay!  But that means I've been packing boxes instead of writing.  Boo!  I bring you a short chapter.  Yay!  This week I fly out to visit family in Hawaii and my not have time to write.  Boo!
“Maybe now isn’t the best time for this…” John answered.
“You like women.”  I answered.
Lestrade entered the room and looked confusedly between the two naked men.
“It’s too much, Sherlock.”  John breathed so none of the guests could hear his familiarity with their king.
“That’s Bill.”  John smiled, inching closer.  “Oh… there’s Alex!  And Arthur!  Martin loved it when Arthur knotted him.”  The orgy ended with the howl as all the males again relaxed onto the floor and the females picked themselves up.  “There’s Sarah… the doctor who serviced me.  Molly… Mary… Jenny… the one holding the camera is named Katie… she was already pregnant with Bill’s cub from our previous bonding.  They all got pregnant that day.  And the group after them too when we were in wolf form… our fertility success was really high.”
“We choose for a variety of reasons.”  Mary smiled at him.  “Some want mates.  Others want companions.  What will you choose?”
John frowned at the mention of “his highness.”  “I believe he has forgotten about me.”
A fresh wave of slick filled the room with the pungent aroma of Omega in heat.  “Do we have to talk about that right now?”
John watched with a fond smile blooming on his face.
Mary blushed and curtseyed.
“This is the bridal chamber.  It’s meant for weddings.”  Lestrade answered, watching the couple pack.
John stopped his pacing and stared at me.  “You’re joking, right?  You’re having a laugh at my expense?”
“What do you think?”
“Friends…” Sherlock nearly spit out the word.  “What need do we have for friends?  We have each other.  That is all we need.”
John turned away from us and took deep, cleansing breaths.  “I didn’t know she was your sister.  I told you… She was just some woman on the bus.  Later she was my therapist.  And then I found out she was your sister.  She knew who I was.  She may have targeted me to get to you.”
“You lay with traitors!  You are weak!”  Magnussen snarled and took a swift step towards Mary, his dagger held before him.  Suddenly he gave a pained groan and fell.  A knife quivered, embedded in his back.
The faun smiled and stepped closer, coming around the fire to sit before John.  “That’s right.”
“Then take me.”  John dismounted and lounged on the bed.
“What is it you want, John?”  It was the question I had been harboring since our marriage, six months before.
Sherlock bit his lips and tried to hide his own laughter.
“And that someone is me?” John asked.
“Now?”  John was surprised.
“Yours?”  John whispered.
Lestrade paled.  “I just thought… You would have them use a bed chamber near yours.  There is an empty room down the hall…”
“Hush… I do believe our guest has arrived.  Sherlock!”  The Irish man greeted.
Yes... I'm aware that historically Prima Nocta probably didn't exist the way Braveheart depicts it.  But it's a fun idea to play with and I can't resist.
The detective nodded.  “A souvenir of my time on the run.”
“You are not a bed slave.”
“Isn’t that obvious?”  I was disappointed that he wasn’t naked.
“Your affection.  Your passion.  The way you hold me.” Sherlock answered between kisses.
“We all have to start somewhere.”
Sherlock nuzzled the top of John’s head.  “Do you want me to kick you out?”
Sherlock looked up from his interaction with Rosie.  His mood had improved so he no longer was brooding.  His eyes caught on John and Molly as if he hadn’t realized they were still there.
“Where would we go?” John asked, confused by her insistence that they leave.
“Do you want me to do it again?” I asked, almost terrified to know his answer.
“Congratulations?  Or no?  You haven’t told anyone.  Not even the Alpha that impregnated you?  I wonder why…”
“Sherlock, come up here.”
Sherlock’s kisses worked their way down John’s spine as he pulled away.  When he reached John’s ass he licked the top of the crack, causing John to shiver.  Quickly he pulled off his robe and resumed his kisses, his tongue probing in between John’s cheeks.
“Don’t be like that…” John wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and guided him into lounging against him.
John took the right and found himself running down a dark hallway with no torches.  A door was open, shining some light into the hallway and John ran for it.  At the open door he stopped and Lestrade nearly crashed into him.  Regaining his balance, he looked into the room and gasped at the sight.  Magnussen stood, holding a dagger to Lady Mary’s breast.  King William stood several feet away from both of them.  All three glanced at the commotion in the doorway.
I wanted to laugh.  “Your methods of deduction are…”
“I just want to look at you.”
“The night before I won this scar.”  John answered, his voice breaking.
I have a new icon!  Isn't it pretty?  (pets it)  I've been painting lately.  The painting is called "Little Sherlock" and the style is inspired by Margaret Keane's Big Eyed Waifs.
“Did it ever occur to m’lord than I may know where he is going, better than he does?  Begging your pardon, but I was raised here.”
Sherlock just stared at him, biting his lips and swaying slightly.
Sherlock patted his haunch.  “You look… Magnificent.”  His fingers touched John’s tail before working his way to the other side of John’s body.
“I’m sorry dear… I wish I could help.”
I wanted to laugh.  “Your methods of deduction are…”
“You’ve never… finished… these past couple of weeks we’ve been doing this.  Will you finish if I… mount you?”
Just then a child’s voice called out, “Daddy?  Da?  Where are you?”
“Only because I’m with you.” I answered.  My body desperately wanted to ejaculate.  My lips took his as my hands reached down to guide his arse in a steady rhythm.
John smiled.  “You would miss me?”
John set Rosie on his chair and started to pace the floor, running his hand through his hair.
Sherlock set the mobile down on the nightstand.  “Would you…?”
“I came here for the entertainment.” John indicated the stage.  Sherlock had just begun his song.
“We all have needs… On occasion.” I admitted.  “I would rather satisfy them with you.”
“Who was that?” John asked from where he sat on the couch.  “Jim and Seb… Who are they?”
“You want me to prove my intention?”  I asked.
“Thank you for finding him and returning him to me.”
To be honest I had no time to even think about my pregnancy until I stood in front of my sister, playing her violin.  “You’re pregnant.”
“I wouldn’t put it past you to have fathered at least a few of them…”
“I’m doing it.”
“Hey there… Open your eyes!”  Moriarty cooed.
“Does it hurt?  Would you like some tea?”
“I felt guilty for not loving her enough.  I felt guilty for loving you more.”
“You were beaten?”
Sherlock shrugged.  “It was worth it to find my prey.”
“I was a bed slave.”  John picked up his chopsticks again and attacked his lemon chicken with gusto.
“I am not a blushing maiden.”  Irene mused as her fingers undid the lacing for John’s trousers.  Her hand reached in and took his cock, squeezing it gently.  “I do not fear the marriage bed.”
“From what I understand that might be very difficult without help.”  John answered.
A shadow was thrown over the rock and everyone looked up to see a scowling faun staring down at them in his full Glamour.  Molly’s eyes were wide as she stared at his impressive cock.  Mary smiled, keeping her gaze to the faun’s face.  John looked up and frowned at his partner’s scowl.  “Mary and Molly came for a visit.”
“He asked if I was gay.”
“I’m the first?”  Sherlock mused, adding a third finger.
“This is a private matter.  I can handle it.”
“You haven’t told me a lot of things it seems.”
Lord John approached the dais and knelt with his eyes to the floor.  At his side Mary did the same.  Both waited for King William to acknowledge their presence.
John bowed his head and grunted as his cock twitched.  “You’ve prepared yourself…?”
Gently John guided her back into a proper sitting position between them.  She whimpered at being placed in the new position.  “You have to sit up while you’re in a car, Rosie.” John soothed her.  “I’ll miss her climbing into bed with us in the morning before breakfast.”
Sherlock pulled his fingers out and lightly patted John’s butt before guiding him to his side.  “What is wrong, John?”
I realized I didn’t know if I could trust him not to hurt me.  But my body reacted to the stimulation anyway.  “John… I’m about to… To…” I was helpless and completely under his power.  I ejaculated and John stilled.  As I finished I watched him get up from the bed and go into the bathroom.  There was a sound of him spitting, followed by the sink turning on.  I turned my head to look at the time, surprised to find that it was past time for my alarm to go off.  I checked the alarm and found that it was to go off at the time I set but hadn’t.
“I’m sorry…” John whispered.  His heart felt like it was going to explode.
John picked up Rosie and set her on his lap.  “Did you hear that, Rosie?  You might have a little brother or sister.”
John took his wolf form and happily kept the landlady company as she watched telly.
“Touch me.” Sherlock whimpered.
“And you’re not just doing this to get into someone’s office?”
“So… You’re not faking it?”
John continued to stare at Sherlock as if to assess him.  “Fine… I’ll take you up on your hospitality.  But I have some money so I’ll pay you back.”
“We can forget like it ever happened.  I never seduced you.”  John answered.
Suddenly there was a rush of grey fur and muscle.  Sharp teeth bit into the gorgon’s arm causing him to cry out.  Moriarty was not prepared for the full grown werewolf that savaged his arm as if it was nothing.
“They are too busy.  There is a war going on.”
Sherlock responded by pulling his knees under himself, lifting his arse into the air in offering.
“I just came to see how you were getting along.  This is the one you came for?”  Irene made a face.  “He’s a bit scrawny.  I don’t know… I suppose I will have to see him naked.  He might have girth or length to make up for it.”
“I wanted to talk about your latest conquest.”
“Oh get off it, Mycroft!  Not like I was ever going to take a wife.”
Sherlock reached down and pulled back up his pants and trousers, not bothering to fasten them.  “I plan to learn more about werewolves.”  Remembering Mycroft’s words he took a deep breath.  “What is… a knot?”
“Of course not.” I answered.
“I’ll be stuck like this for a half an hour at least.”  John commented.  “Hopefully the condom doesn’t break.”
“You can’t hurt me.”  Sherlock answered, pulled John’s lips to his own for a deep, filthy kiss.
I turned away, unable to look at her.  Inside my chest I could feel my heart clench, making it difficult to breathe properly.  “Stop it.”
John looked at me with surprise and shock on his face.  “You’ve done that before.  I’m not your first?”
On one such occasion John sat down beside him on the couch, pretending to watch telly with Sherlock’s legs placed in his lap.  John’s fingers drew idle patterns across Sherlock’s skin, causing an erection.  But John kept his touch between mid-thigh to toes.  After the program ended John turned his attention to Sherlock.  “Our client will be here soon.”
It was like with Janine, except not.  John had power and force that took Sherlock’s breath away and it was all he could do to avoid crashing their teeth together.  His body relaxed and he felt himself roll over onto his back with John rolling on top of him and settle between his thighs.
Sherlock pushed the chair back from the table, watching as John followed him, intent on undoing the trousers and working down the pants.  “John… I’m a little busy right now.”
John stifled a laugh.  “Comfortable?”
I knew estrus poisoning was the easiest way to go.  As an Omega I have always been cursed with the need for suppressants.  How easy would it be to stop them and let nature take its course?  In the days before suppressants all the desirable Omega were collected by Alpha.  Those that were undesirable were left to die when their first heat was upon them.  Had I been born in a different time period I know I would have been left to die as one of those Undesired.
John continued to stare down Mycroft, knowing the human equivalent of an alpha when he saw one.  “Sherlock is mine now.”
John paused in his pacing and made a face.
“I’ve never known him to physically hurt you.  If anything he’s always been protective of you and now he isn’t.”
“Especially peacocks.” John stood on his toes and pushed a kiss into Sherlock’s lips.  They kissed for a moment before John pulled away to look up at Sherlock.  “Tell me one of your needs.”
“Sex.” His answer was soft.
“Yes, daddy.”
John stared at Lestrade’s nervousness for almost a minute.  “Alright, we’ll go.  Please have our horses readied so we may return to our lands.”
I pulled the earpiece from my ear.  “Tell me about Moriarty.”
John stepped into the room and sat at the floor near Mrs. Hudson’s feet, knowing his nudity embarrassed her and that his position would block her view.  “It’s moonrise in a couple of hours.”
“It’s only a piece of paper.  I’ve considered myself married to you for years.”
“You’re still too tight.”  John answered, using his free hand to push the curls from Sherlock’s forehead.
“Can you leave the woods?” Sherlock answered the question with his own question.
John was annoyed with himself for dwelling on Sherlock’s words of love and devotion the last time they had been together.  Had it really been the night Moriarty was caught?  That was before John knew that Sherlock was actually King William.  What had those pretty words been about?  What did they mean?  John was upset with himself for not having noticed the man who was so intent on bedding him was actually the king.
“I have seen a male horse and they weren’t this big!”  John insisted.
John’s eyes caught on the faun, noticing that he too had been bedecked in garlands.  But his plants looked more like ivies and greenery.  Something was wrapped around his hard cock.  In the center of greeters was also a table covered in food and drink.  “What is this?”  John indicated the table.
“How can you be starving?  You just had me.” John teased.
John took off his Glamour and glanced at the large, hairy creature.  “It’s Greg.”
The faun rolled his eyes at him and shook his head.  “You must leave all mortal things behind.”  It was said as if it was the simplest logic in the world.
Sherlock went still, his fingers deep inside John, his throat relaxed with an occasional swallow.
John checked the wound, finding it to be a shallow cut.  There was already a clot forming.  “You alright?”
John sat down at the table, across from his daughter.  “Impregnate is to get someone pregnant so they will have babies.”
“His son was your friend, Victor Trevor?” John asked as they left the building.
John smiled.
John set down his chopsticks and stared at the man he had only met the day before.  “What do you want to know about me?”
“You chose Mycroft?”
Sherlock watched the water flow towards the drain.  “They use it to clean the room after they are done.”  On the edge of the drain there was rust colored remains.  Someone had bled out in this room before them.
“Has your daddy been a good boy?”
“No… of course not… She was a behaviorist.”
“Irene is a fairy.”  The faun informed John from where he sat beside him.  “What do you want?”  That was directed at the fairy and held more than a little contempt.
“I know.” John answered as he waved from his car window.
Sherlock gave an irritated sigh and sat up, nearly pushing John from his lap as he stared down at him in annoyance.  “You talk too much during sex.”
“No, of course not.” John replied.
“No…” John replied carefully.  “You haven’t.”
Sherlock slid onto the ground and crouched there, bent over as he fisted the grass.
“I asked for it.” I responded, mostly to keep her from pushing the issue.  And technically I did offer him ‘anything’ which would include biting.
Eventually he did fall asleep and his dreams were filled with his own John Watson.  “I’m not gay,” his John stated as he walked away, leaving Sherlock bereft.  When Sherlock woke he resolved to just let 1895 Watson do what he wanted without any interference.
“He’s a gorgon.  I don’t know how much of you is still mortal.  But if you are a tiny bit he can turn you to stone.  Keep your eyes shut!”
When Sherlock moaned Watson pressed their lips together in a kiss.  It lasted for only a few minutes before Sherlock expelled.  On his back he panted for breath.  “You will not risk it.  So we will never… Bugger?”  The thought disappointed him.
Too soon Mycroft’s car arrived and it was time to say goodbye.
Lestrade chose to ignore Sherlock’s outburst.  “Will Sherlock be in contact with you?  In case we need more information…”
Sherlock stepped up to the table.  “This is our wedding feast.”
“Well… I can see there are no other bite marks on you…” Sherlock answered.
I bit my lips, thinking of the way his feet had made a sharp connection with my ribs.  John was perfectly capable of leaving me in agony.  “You don’t know that.”
“I have every confidence in your skill.”  Sherlock stated.
Sherlock’s eyes focused on John’s chest as if the amount of skin revealed mesmerized him.  “I will… I’ll keep you with me… Always.”  Hastily he swallowed.
“And Lestrade?”  John queried.
“Hello.” John smiled through his mask at Mr. Holmes.  They went into the house, following Mrs. Holmes and Rosie.
No wonder Sherlock had a dream about Watson fulfilling his needs.  Because Sherlock did have needs.  There was that occasional need for release.  The only problem was that he felt like it was cheating to take care of his needs by himself.  And John never offered.  If John did offer, would it be clinical like in the dream?
Sherlock pulled off the trousers and then helped John roll over onto his hands and knees.  “Just a scratch, my lord.”  Sherlock breathed, leaning down to breathe on the wound and then lightly lick it.  “No poison.”  A gentle kiss followed as his hands held John’s hips.
“John Watson.”
“I can’t help it.”  Sherlock answered, pulling himself into a smaller ball.  “It just all comes out.  I don’t mean to say it.”
She said it before time was called.  But then it turned out that neither of us had to go through that at all.  I was so angry, so disgusted, I smashed the casket.  I knew I could never have John.  Never!  It wasn’t fair!
“I… Want…” John grunted, lost for words as his world shrunk done to Sherlock’s fist.
“Eight years.”
That seemed to calm him down somewhat, although his hands were still in fists.  I looked away, remembering the last time he was so angry.  It seemed he remembered too.  With some effort he opened his hands and took a cleansing breath.  “No.  I’m sorry.  It just hurt to be reminded that I’m capable of doing that.  I won’t.  And you shouldn’t pretend you like it in order to keep me satisfied.”
“Mmm…” John hummed, head rolled back with a look of contentment on his face.  “Mary.”
The bushes nearby continued to move and John was very much aware that something was watching him.  Every so often he checked the bush with his torch to try and catch a glimpse of whatever was lingering.
--TBC
With a soft hum, Sherlock pulled back just a little bit just as John climaxed.  Obediently he swallowed it all down.
“Sherlock…”
For nine days he had been left alone with his own thoughts and self-doubt… Vaguely he recalled only demanding seven days.  John taking two days more wasn’t a good sign.  Nervously he rubbed his face to try and clear away his insecurities.  “Is he hungry?”
“Who is spreading these rumors?”
“You said ‘anything.’”  Of course… John had contemplated cheating on Mary with an unknown person.  John hadn’t had sex since before Rosie was born.  The cheating was for sexual release.
John Watson fed another stick into his small camp fire.  Had he reached his destination he would have been required to build a bonfire big enough to discourage the creature that was being hunted from escaping into the country side.  In the middle of the woods it served no purpose but for the very basic need for warmth.
“I’ve tried Uncle Sherlock, Uncle Lock, Sherly… She insists on ‘daddy.’”
Warnings for Omegaverse dynamics.  In canon Suicidal Thoughts.
At that moment Lestrade entered and looked around the morgue.  “Welcome back, Sherlock.”
Sherlock found it very difficult to fall asleep that night.  Whether it was because Watson was cross with him or that he had become used to their nightly activities, he was not sure.  But he vowed that the next time Watson approached him he would not try and reciprocate.
“I said, ‘stop!’” John turned to glare at his partner.  Sherlock seemed to shrink back into the door of the cab, causing John to soften.  “I’m not ready.”  Pulling his hands out from under his thighs, he clutched them together.  “Besides… It’s not about me anymore.  I have Rosie to think about.  It would be unfair of me.  It’s all about her now.”
Sherlock guided John onto his back, fingers still inside the lord, stretching him.  “But you’ve been with a man before me.”
“What gossip?”  John asked.
“I order you… As king… Now!  I want to feel it.”
They lay there for a long time, Sherlock holding his lover close as they both recovered.  John was the first to move.  “I’m sticky… And so are you.”
“I…” What had Sherlock said?  It was a Wedding Feast.  “I think… Yes?”
With the information Mrs. Hudson seemed to accept John’s perpetual state of undress.  Giving him access to 221C along with pillows and quilts was her form of apology.  “I should have known… I met a werewolf once when I was a young woman out in the woods.  I couldn’t understand why there was a naked man on such a chilly day.  He told me that his skin ached with the approach of the full moon.  It must be around that time for you?”
“No, thank you.” I answered, annoyed with her intrusion.
John reached down, feeling the half erection in his hand.  “Of course it doesn’t.”
“Even though I…?”
Sherlock smiled at him from his place on the couch.  His arm moved, revealing a long stretch of pale skin from head to toes.  His other hand kept the sheet from uncovering his genitals.  “What do you think?”
Mary blushed and shook her head.  “Without my father’s advice I’m afraid…”
“Tell me you want me.”  Sherlock urged as he wrapped his fist around John’s cock, squeezing it.
“You don’t strike me as the traditional sort of Omega that wants to belong to an Alpha.  I could be wrong… But this is the second time you have brought up being bitten.”
“I knew you were military.”
John bit his lip and clenched his hand.  “Me.”
“I don’t… Need that…” John whimpered.  And yet his hands touched Sherlock’s sides.
It was near dawn.  His torch long since lost power, Sherlock managed to make his way through the woods in pursuit of his quarry.  The man he chased could barely fare any better in the half light of early dawn.  His stumbling through the bushes and over fallen tree litter made it easy to track.  Somewhere ahead he heard a fall and a curse.  But then there was the sound of movement.  Sherlock pushed on ahead and tripped, falling hard on the leaf strewn mossy ground.  Cursing softly he looked back to see what he legs were tangled on.  A naked person lay with his back to him.
“We both finished.  I count that as a win.”
“It is what it is.” I answered.
John shrugged and used his chopsticks to rearrange the food on his plate.  “I served three masters… all male…”
I shook my head.
Sherlock blushed and stared at the floor.  “I… er… sorry…  John?  Can you come with me?”
I'm still unsure how this will end.  I've written about 2000 words (two chapters) past this point with no end in sight.  If you were to plot me using the series as a guide we're somewhere between Sign of the Three and His Last Vow if that's any indication.
I woke up naked in my bed with John’s scent on the sheets.  And for a moment I fought off the sensation of homesickness that came with having him so near.  But he wasn’t there.  The sheets held his scent but they were cool to the touch.  John had left them more than an hour before.
And so began the wild, adrenalin pumping life for John that centered around Sherlock Holmes.  Within a day he was invited to live with the sometimes drag queen and solve cases with him.
Warnings for... Death of a not very nice man.
“Sherlock…”
“They have difficulty with stairs.” Sherlock answered.
“Yes…” Sherlock turned even redder.  “Both?”
I nodded, unsure what exactly he was offering.
“Did I do it wrong?”
“What am I not seeing?” John demanded.
“I’m alright.”  John stated from where he stood, holding Sherlock’s jacket closed over his body.
--TBC
“Hey…” John spoke up from behind me, causing me to spin around and stare at the damp man wrapped in a blanket.
“None of my partners was tied up naked in a warehouse before now!” Sherlock answered.
Two and a half years before Sherlock had been forced to tell Molly that he loved her.  It had been cruel because Molly had feelings for him since she met him.  Sherlock had explained the reason for the call and Molly had been moved that he had done it in order to save her life.  They didn’t talk about it after that.  But it was obvious Sherlock’s free love with Rosie caused her a little pain.
“And you didn’t even have to bite me…”
“But you could if you both wanted to.  You’d make gorgeous babies.”
“I’m going to cum.”
John couldn’t help but notice that Sherlock didn’t deny it.  “What if I had said that I wanted more children?”
“Oh!  Oh look!  The goat has a pet pony!”  Moriarty crowed.
“If this Moriarty is caught.”
“Tell him?” John echoed.
“Why not?”
Sherlock made a face.  “It’s funny, really…  Ironic, I suppose.  Voracious sexual appetite and no one to share it with.”
John breathed through the pain, cursing his clumsiness.  Now was not the time to be injured.  A test of his ankle told him that it hurt like hell but it bore his weight so it probably wasn’t broken… Merely sprained.  It still wasn’t the best news.  There was miles of wilderness surrounding him and the helicopter would only return for him after the mission was over.
“I have dinner.  Usually we’re on a case and you don’t eat.”
“Are you going to kick me out once you’ve had your way with me?”  His nose nuzzled against the other man’s scrotum, occasionally licking the wrinkled skin.
“Is there something you want to tell me?” John asked as he sat on my new couch.  It wasn’t as good as my old couch.  Rosie sat on the floor at his feet, playing with her toys.
“Of course.”  Lestrade answered and left the chamber to make the preparations.
“Besides breeding an army of powerful warriors the program was used to breed desirable traits into werewolves.  They breed.  You mentioned that this particular warg was drooling on your trouser leg.  They were bred to bond together as a pack to every pack member.  They eat together, sleep together and fuck together.  Yes, I said it… there’s no other way to describe it.  I’ll send you some video footage that will make your skin crawl.  What will you do when he wants to become pack to you in all ways of that word?  In his experience… that means mounting you.”
“But… Why?  I know who you are and why you’re here.  You don’t have to pretend to be something you’re not.”
John shook his head.  “I told you… It was confusing.  I don’t think we were even talking about the same thing.  He said you have needs.”
Irene smiled and stepped up on tiptoes to kiss his lips.  “How long has it been, my lord?”
Sherlock shook his head and pulled off the condom, tossing it into the wastebasket beside his bed.  Reaching out, he pulled John into his embrace, “Don’t.”
“Bed slave.”  Sherlock answered, narrowing his eyes at John.
“You need a knot.  This heat will end if you have a knot.” John informed me as he opened the package and rolled the large condom over his length.  It was made to catch the impressive amount of semen an Alpha produced.  His half knot kept it in place.  “What position do you prefer?”
Sherlock leaned against him, head on the shorter man’s shoulder.  “This is why I didn’t want to become attached.  They are going to take you away from me.  I can’t…”
--TBC
“Not that it matters… you’re just an… an ANIMAL!  Animals are often motivated by just their mating drive.”
“I’ll be stuck like this for a half an hour at least.”  John commented.  “Hopefully the condom doesn’t break.”
“You are going the wrong way.”  The faun announced.  “I will lead you back to your house.  Follow me.”
John lay down upon me, grinding us together with his hips.  “You look… Amazing!”
“Do I look at you in pity?”  Sherlock demanded, rocking his hips as if to remind John of where he was perched.
“You live in town?”
“Wait!”  John commanded, looking between the eager lord and his erection.
We did not speak of what happened for the rest of our hour together.
John kissed him to silence him, pushing his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth.  Breathlessly they broke the kiss.
“You were already awake.”
“Why?”
Sherlock couldn’t really answer.  There was a low, breathless sob and then he went still with an occasional attempt to push in deeper.
“Explain.”
John blinked a few times and pulled away.  “She knows?”
“Oh… Oh I see.”  Eudora frowned.  Then she perked up.  “But I’m still her Nana!  And she is my little Rosie!”  Suddenly she gave Sherlock a very critical look.  “Since she’s the only grandchild I’ll ever have.”
“Sherlock?” John looked concerned.
John stared at me.  His eyes glanced down at my half erect penis.  Licking his lips, he looked me in the eye.  “Do you mean it?”
I cried out in surprise.  “Ow!  John, stop!”
John sat up, keeping his eyes on the floor.  “John.”
“Sherlock asked me to live with him.”  John blinked a few times at Lestrade and then looked up at Sherlock.
“It’s alright… Rub against me.”
“Lady Irene.”  John’s steward announced.
“You pleased me… I just need a little more.”  John sat up, aware that his ass was leaking onto their sheets.  Quickly he straddled one of Sherlock’s thighs and took himself in hand.
“You could help me!” John shot at him.
Sherlock held him tight, trembling despite the warmth from the fire.
“Yes, your highness.”  Lestrade answered.
John looked over the table.  Most of the food was fruits and pastries.  There was a cup that held some sort of clear liquid.  “Ok.”
John cocked his head to the side, regarding Sherlock skeptically.  “Well, why not?  She likes you.”
“It’s rumor and gossip, John.  Do keep up.”
“Mum!” Sherlock sputtered.  “We are not birds.”
Now I am using my gaming computer.  It runs way too hot to be on my lap.  I have to sit at a desk.  My muse isn't happy.  Blegh!
“Was that… Was that you?”  John asked, looking to Sherlock for confirmation.
I shrugged, casually.  “Did you like it?”
“Any time, dear.”
“Your time is coming soon.  What will you choose?” Mary asked John conversationally.
It was too much friction and Sherlock had to cum.  Closing his eyes, he felt his release in throbbing ecstasy.  Opening his eyes he realized Moriarty was gone and John was at his side, reading a book.
“I did not!”  John shot back and then leaned down to suck on the exposed appendage.
“No fair asking me for that while I’m inside of you.”  Sherlock replied, his fingers clutching John’s knees.
The man sat in handcuffs as the local precinct booked him for the crime he had committed.  Sherlock watched him as he was led away to await his sentence.  Turning to John he smiled.  “You hungry?”
“I’m starving.”
“What is it?” John asked, looking at the pensive detective.
“What do you want, Jim?”
“Call him off!”  Mycroft demanded.
“Guard Lord John with your life.”
“Usually we compensate for that by putting on more clothing, not by taking it off.”
John spread the duvet over them both and reached out to flick off the bedside light.  “Night Sherlock.”
“You asked me to come live with you.”
“I thought I lost you.”  Sherlock answered.
Sherlock knelt on the ground beside John.  “It could be worse.  And it’s probably not the only thing you have.  You’re half horse.  I bet you can run like the wind.”  The faun offered the centaur a grin.
“A trick?  Why would I trick you?”  John asked.
“And you should wear less.  Show me.”  Sherlock replied as he pulled off John’s tunic.  His eyes caught on the twisted scar tissue on John’s shoulder.
“I remember you at that tourney.  I was still a child.  But you were so brave and strong.  More than once I thought they would unhorse you… Or you would be hurt.  I held my breath each time you met your opponent.  But you won all your rounds.  And then I found out you were the youngest to compete… And win!”
“How?” I asked.
John casually shrugged and pulled on his vest.  “Probably.”
“No!” John answered.  There were plenty of women in his past to attest to that.  Of course there were plenty of men who thought otherwise.
“To get to me?”  John whispered, paling at the thought.
John took a step back.
John followed him in and up the steps to their flat, entering behind him to find Molly on the couch, reading Rosie a story.
As luck would have it, it was very little.  Immediately he sat back in his chair with a look of disgust on his face.  “I’m so sorry.”
“Did he break skin?”
“Now think about the one that brought you here.  Concentrate really hard on them.  The way they look… The way they smell.  Their taste… Anything you can tie to them.  Concentrate on them and when he are ready open your eyes.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes Watson.  John Hamish Watson Holmes.”
“My Lord Watson… Did it ever occur to you that I may have some insight?  I am a woman, after all.  I know what my sex must do in order to survive as a mistress.  Drawing attention to yourself is not how you survive.  Enemies… Family… All can become jealous of the attention given to the mistress or see them as a way to harm the lord.  You can’t be so oblivious, can you?  Certainly you have encountered mistresses before.”
I ran through everything John had said recently about Eurus.  My sister had pretended to be his therapist and shot him with a tranquilizer dart.  Perhaps she had done something to him while he was unconscious.  “No.”
Quickly I entered the bathroom and removed my clothes, tossing them in the hamper.  I dug through the cabinet until I found the petroleum jelly.  With one foot on the toilet I reached back and hastily prepared myself.
“Yeah… But you couldn’t…”  John’s mind drifted off, trying to imagine the mechanics of intercourse.  Sherlock was too quiet so John looked at him, seeing the amused look on the faun’s face.  “But you…”
Mary took off her Glamour and climbed up onto the rock beside John.  “I was just showing my friend, Molly, around.”
“John…” Eudora addressed Sherlock’s partner.
“You may stay with us for as long as you like.” John replied, ignoring Sherlock.
“We’ll be in the garden.” Sherlock answered as he pulled John out the back door.
Watson!  That was his last name… The one he’d forgotten.  “Watson… I’m John Watson.  I forgot my last name… That was weird.”
I finished the story last night.  But you get to see the third chapter tomorrow.  Today you get chapter 2.
“And why haven’t you thrown him in the dungeon?”
“You didn’t tell me we were going to see his…” John began.
“Sorry.” John answered.
“It wasn’t important.”
“As will I.” Sherlock reassured him.  “But we are exposed to those without masks in our line of work.  I won’t risk Rosie getting sick because of us.  My parents are healthy.  They are isolated.  They’ll take care of her.”
I changed focus from John to the year old child he had placed in my lap.  “Hello, darling.”  I smiled at her.
Watson sighed and waved his hand.  “Never mind.  What are their names?”
The last thing I remembered as the room completely darkened was John whispering, “Damnit, Sherlock!”  And then there was nothing.
“You’ve seen me many times… Every inch of me.” John chuckled softly.
“You can’t wander my castle naked!”  John answered.  “Put something on!”  Dropping his head on the bed, he covered his eyes with his wrists and desperately tried to control his aborted lust.
“What gardens?”  John challenged.
“Who are you?”  John demanded.
John sat on the hay, his trousers caught around his knees as he stared up at the robed Sherlock.  “She was going to kill me?”
Things became a routine.  They often had sex.  But there was more than enough time to be lazy or to sleep.  Gradually the landscape began to change with John’s influence.  A stream passed through the clearing, deep enough to swim or bathe in.  A large, flat boulder became the perfect place to sit and bask in the sunlight.
Months passed.  John seemed agitated.  By my calculations his last sexual release had been shortly before Mary died, the year before.  Someone like John couldn’t wait that long.
John looked away.
We took our time in the shower.  I helped him clean every bit of himself.  John giggled and turned red in embarrassment.  But that didn’t stop me from washing him from head to foot.
“Don’t be like that.”  John smiled and leaned down to kiss where the sheet covered Sherlock’s genitals.  And with that one brief touch he got up.
“I like this position.  But I don’t think I’m quite ready for that… Yet.”
“I am not even thinking about wives…” John admitted.
“You will take my scent and the entire world will know that you have been bred by me.”
“You clean bones?”  John was confused and surprised by what he was hearing.
John stood his ground, although the scent of shit and unwashed, stale musk that wafted from Magnussen made him want to move away.  Sherlock needed him to be strong.
“Lay down.”
“You’re a military doctor.”
“She said there was a bomb.  She killed others so there was no reason to doubt that she would follow through with her threat.”
John returned from the laundry room and sat down on the couch, still naked.  “I’m sorry.”
“That part actually is true.”
Rosie squirmed and I released her.  Quickly she resumed her snack.
“In this castle?  In your bed chamber?  I’m here because you called me here.  You told me you would be called to court in a season.  I waited for three.  You lied to me.”
John whimpered and began to move.  “Oh Gods…” But now he was aware of his words and he bit his lips as he began his needful tempo.  It had been a long time since his last bedding.  Hands and mouths didn’t count.  It had been years since his last bed partner had looked at him the same way Sherlock did now… With a lustful fire in his eyes and a smirk on his perfect lips.  John kissed the other lord’s lips.
I desperately needed to ejaculate.  I pondered the etiquette of releasing on John’s stomach the way he did mine.
John relaxed, hearing Sherlock’s heartbeat against his ear.  Sherlock readjusted the embrace and pressed his face to the top of John’s head.  “Does this mean yes?”
John’s fingers clutched at Sherlock’s buttock, squeezing it.  Sherlock hadn’t prepared him completely but he welcomed the stretch, burn and fullness of his lover inside of him.  His legs pulled Sherlock closer.  “You like having my legs wrapped around you?”
Sherlock pushed up under John, writhing beneath him.
There was a moment of doubt but I nodded anyway.
“You don’t have to impress me.” John assured him, reaching out to pull Sherlock in for a kiss.
“You’re just going to go at it like a couple of animals?”  Moriarty asked from where he sat on the chair.
“But I should have known or made them bring me here.”
“I nearly died.  It grew infected.  Puss and… And it wasn’t pleasant.  You’re lucky… You’re beautiful.  Anyone would want you in their bed.  I’m… I’m no longer whole.”
Lestrade appeared behind Sherlock.  “Yes, m’lord?”
“Do you want me to?”  Sherlock searched John’s eyes again.
I hummed in reply, taking in deep breaths of his musky scent, feeling the tip of his cock almost reach the back of my throat.  A roll of my tongue and a hum made him gasp and harden completely.  I could take him easily.  I didn’t even have to use my hand to keep him from stifling me.  Each swallow he tapped the back of my throat as my nose made contact with his pubic hair.  My John… My fantastic, wonderful John using my mouth for his pleasure.  I gripped his hips and held him as he moved.
But our story begins twelve hours earlier when brother Mycroft suggested that Sherlock needed a holiday, “For your own sanity.”  Sherlock had gone over a month with back to back cases and never any rest.  His work was beginning to suffer due to his lack of sleep and food.  Mycroft managed to whisk his younger brother away from the city to an unused country abode that was conveniently stocked with supplies.  It usually spent time as a safe house, but Mycroft thought his brother needed the isolation more than any of the usual occupants.  “I will return for you in two weeks, brother of mine.” Mycroft informed him before his driver took off, leaving Sherlock in a cloud of dust with an empty house, and nearby woods.
“We wants to be king.”
“It’s rather warm in here.” John commented.
“You broke his heart!” Sherlock replied.
“I am a faun.  My name is Jawn.”
“You don’t mind?”
“But we have been moved to the south tower...” John attempted to reason with the guard.  “We shouldn’t even be in here.  Why won’t you let us out?”
“No… he was special to you.”
“We are a good fit.” John gave a soft thrust.
Obediently I turned over so we could come together face to face.  I wrapped my arms around his shoulders as he pushed back into me.  “John…” I murmured, feeling the delightful stretch and burn.  It was evidence that he was inside of me.
“Fine.” Sherlock let go.
John sat back on his haunches, taking a deep breath.
“Shut up.” John whispered dangerously.  “Why didn’t you take your suppressants?  You knew what would happen if no Alpha was around to help you.  You could have died.”
“Well I’m not going to do it like this.”  John announced and helped guide Sherlock’s body down onto the grass, flipping him over so they were facing each other.  “Face to face… Like this.”  Easing himself down, he lounged upon the faun, taking delight in the way their bare skin felt pressed together.  Playfully he kissed Sherlock’s lips as he slowly began to rub himself against the faun’s body.
John got up from where he sat and smiled at Mrs. Hudson.  “Thank you for your company.”
“I want you to take your pleasure with me.”
“M’lord…”  Lestrade glanced around nervously, unable to give a proper answer.
“Fine…” Sherlock got up and led the way to the bedroom, standing before the bed.  Quickly he took off his clothes and kicked off his shoes before sitting on the bed.
Sherlock shivered at the wonderful sensation of John Watson slowly and confidently stroking him.  It was something that Sherlock never imagined his own John would attempt.  What had happened to the 1895 version of John Watson that he had entered into such a relationship with his Sherlock Holmes?
“Then technically you aren’t doing anything… Your people are.”  John sealed his parchment with wax and his signet.  Taking it to the door, he passed it over to the person waiting outside.  “Send this to Castle Bart.”  As he turned around and shut the door he found Sherlock standing before him.  “Sherlock?”
Sherlock sighed in a put-upon way.
Watson pulled out his handkerchief and used it in his right hand to cover the tip.  His left hand wrapped around the detective’s cock.
“She hasn’t seen me naked.”  John breathed, glancing down at his shoulder.
“You’ve mesmerized me.” John admitted.
“Maybe Rosie can learn something by watching six hours of Kitchen Nightmares with us.”
John suppressed the urge to shudder at the dead look in the man’s eyes.
Sherlock Holmes was lost.  Usually he had an impeccable sense of direction.  But he was not in his beloved city of London, he was in the woods.  The trees made it difficult to get his bearings.  Without the moon he only had torchlight to navigate.  But one tree looked like all the rest.
“Oh God, yes.” John smiled at him with a smirk on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes.
“You can go.  If he shows up I’ll send him along.” Molly offered.
“You’re my h-h-hus-band.”  Sherlock managed with another wave.  As it passed he gasped for breath.  “It won’t stop until we consummate.”
“I will take off this ring and you can woo me properly…  No messy dating of strangers.  I will take this off and I’ll be yours… If you want me.”
“What brings you here?”
“Mary is sleeping soundly.”  Sherlock answered, attempting to pull John’s nightshirt from him.
“If you must.”  Sherlock pulled open his robe, still petting John’s hair.
“You don’t know that!” John shot back.
“A human male passed through here less than an hour ago… can you track him?”
“A bigger tub?”  John suggested as he turned on the shower.  “Here, sit on the edge.”  Gently he helped the other man sit.  “I’ll only be a few minutes.”  And with that he stepped under the spray and began to wash as quickly as he could.
“I am an Undesirable.  I’ve always known it from the moment I presented.” I informed him.
John sat back, still straddling Sherlock’s thighs.  Lightly he patted the detective’s bottom with a soft giggle.
“And yet you imply that writing my letters are either too difficult for me to grasp or they are beneath me.”  John punctuated the end of his letter with a flourish that revealed his irritation.
“You feel so good…” John whispered.  “So tight and slick.  I’m gonna cum.”
“And you’re not married, but helping to raise a child… A child that calls you ‘daddy.’”
John tightened his hold on Sherlock’s body, trying not to think of him as a cold husk of a man.
The three all headed back to the sleeping area.  And from then on Sherlock never complained about Greg living with them.  In time with John’s help they became great friends.
“Then what’s wrong?  Am I too big?”
“No one asked you!”  The faun snapped.  “Go away!  I don’t need your help.  You’re scaring him.”
“Stop apologizing and do it already!” Sherlock managed to bite out.  Fingers probed him… And then one slipped inside.  Oh, it was bliss!  John Watson’s finger gently teased the anal rim.  Sherlock desperately wanted more.  “More!”
“Could it be that you are in denial?  I had an Alpha once.  His name was Jim Moriarty…”
“He tried to make you leave, didn’t he?” Sherlock asked.
“I told you… I told you that I cheated.  It was texts… Only texts, I swear.”  John reassured me.
“Maybe.” Jim answered.  “You know what happens if you don’t do what I ask?  He ends up dead.  You fail or show affection for him and he’s dead.  It’s all about sex.”
“What am I missing?”  Sherlock moaned.
“Sherlock, you’ve never indicated that you even wanted to be bonded until recently.  I always thought you were married to your work.  You were a free Omega without an Alpha hanging around to hold you back.”
John knelt so he could look up into Sherlock’s bowed face, surprised at the pain he saw there.  “Sherlock?”
I leaned against the door and slid down to sit.  I could smell myself as a fresh wave of slick rolled down my thighs, accompanied by semen.  It was a fresh reminder that John sacrificed his own sensibilities to save my life, not because he wanted to but because he had to.  Instinct made me rub my scent against the floor.  I got up on my hands and knees and returned to the bed, leaving a trail of slick on the floor.  It was an open invitation for an Alpha to claim me… Breed me… Make me their own.  At that moment I could take any Alpha that walked through my front door.  It just happened to be John.
“Oh God.”  John fell to the ground, covering his face with his hands.  “This is horrible.”
“He implied you take farm animals to bed with you!”
Sherlock took the position of the big spoon, arms around John’s waist, and his face behind John’s shoulder.  “Yes, right now.”  It came out as a purr.  Really he wanted to hear what excuse John would make.  A part of Sherlock knew that John would most likely turn him down.  Their relationship was not physical.  There were hugs and kisses, but nothing else.
“I could.  Although…”
“You’re welcome.” Greg answered.
“Who is Lady Janine?”  John asked, confused.
I guided him back towards the bed, setting him down on the edge as I stood between his knees.  For a moment I stood, continuing to kiss him.  Then I knelt down on the floor, my face even with his crotch.  My fingers deftly unbuttoned and unzipped his trousers.  I could see him through his pants, he was already hard for me.  Lightly I kissed him through the fabric and I heard him gasp.
“How dare you tell me what to do…?” Sherlock began and was silenced by another kiss.  They broke apart for air.  “I’m your king!”
John got to his feet and began to undress.
John felt something flip over in his stomach at the way Sherlock stared at him.  “I like you.”
“Good.  I think we’re making progress… At least I hope we are making progress.”  John sat in his chair and stared at the floor.  “I’m sorry.  I don’t know what I was thinking when I did those things.  But I know I hurt you.  I wanted to hurt you.  She made it easy to be angry with you and hurt you.  It felt like you deserved it, but you didn’t.  I know that now.”
John was having an easier time focusing on the content of her words and not just the lure of her voice.  “So what is a fairy’s Glamour?”
“Are you sure this is what you want?”
Sherlock placed a hand on the bulge at Watson’s crotch.  Watson gave a soft grunt.  “There, there.”  Sherlock soothed.  “You will not come to any harm.”
“That’s a little out of order, but it will suffice.”  Sherlock answered.  Awkwardly he leaned in and kissed John’s cheek.  “A kiss to seal our vow.”
“Why?”  Moriarty echoed.  “As if you didn’t know, my lord.”
“What?”  John stared up in surprise at Sherlock’s words.  “What are you…?”
John growled softly.
John turned his head to look back at what little he could see of Sherlock.  “Your highness?”  Sherlock rubbed his face on John’s back before rolling off.  John looked down at the broken man crying beside him.  “What’s wrong?”
Sherlock shook his head as if to clear it.  “Um… Thank you.”
John licked the lips that grazed his.  “Marry me.”
I felt relief.  He loved me!  My hands shook as I removed them from his bottom to slide up to his shoulders.  My husband loved me!  No one had ever loved me quite like that before.
“Really?”  John seemed amused.  “You really want to be intimate with me?”
“Please… Milverton is my mother’s family name.   This must be your newest plaything.  He is shorter than I imaged.”  Magnussen smiled coldly at John.
Eagerly the young king crawled up his body, kissing his skin along the way until he found John’s lips.  His body moved, rubbing them together, delighted with the sensation of skin on skin.  With a feral growl Sherlock rolled off and frantically reached for the vial from the table.  Pouring the contents onto his hand he tossed the rest away and opened his legs to push his fingers into himself.
“I have my baby.  My baby is you.”
John followed Sherlock back up the stairs to 221B and into the flat.  When Sherlock sat on the couch he hesitated and cocked his head to the side, watching the human pick up the computer.  Without a word the detective started the disc and placed it on the coffee table for John to watch himself holding Ian.
“John, I’m not having any more children!”
“Good.” Eurus stated and began to change the melody.
“Yes… It’s very close.”
“Three days since you came here.  You seem to be… Nearing that.”
“Only after you’re ready.”
“This is what I have, John.  A man who regards me as his best friend and his child who calls me ‘daddy.’”  And with that Sherlock entered the building.
Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  The exposure to the gas had been brief and he could feel his own body’s reaction to the side effects.  “We can find you someone… Someone to…”
His hand made contact with the top of my head.  “No, you cock.  It only took you twenty seconds!”
John grunted, staying still as if he feared movement might cause injury to one or both of them.
“Marry.  Me.” John tried again.
Sherlock surged forward, knocking John flat on his back as he was covered with tall, handsome brunette.  Sherlock stole John’s breath as he kissed him deeply.  Pulling away with another impish grin he stood up as if nothing had happened.  “Have you ever met your king?  Not the old man… But his son, the new king?”
“Ponies don’t like living in buildings.”
“Yeah… That’s a good word for it.” John gave another sigh and shut his eyes.  “You’re going back on suppressants, aren’t you?”
John bit his lips.  Did Sherlock want someone?  “Me?”
“Harder.”  Sherlock pleaded softly.  “More.  Don’t hold back.”
“You did.” John agreed.  “But I want you to make another one in front of witnesses and sign a piece of paper.”
John closed his eyes to think about it a moment before giving an answer.  “Yes.”
It didn’t hurt.  And when the faun released the ankle John was surprised that it no longer hurt.  The swelling went down and a careful test in range of movement revealed that it was no longer sprained.  “How did you do that?”
“If I was to marry again I would look for someone who wants to help raise my child with me.  I want someone who will spoil her… Love her as if she was their own.”
“Wait… What?”  John attempted to distance himself from the two but found the tree at his back blocked his escape.
“You’ve never been to the city?”  Sherlock watched John’s reaction to Piccadilly Circus with some amusement.
Sherlock read the message and then read it again to be sure of the contents.
With another shy kiss to John’s cheek, Sherlock murmured “Come away human child” and stepped backwards.
Sherlock patted his partner’s back.
“John… I need… N-n-need…”  With a frustrated sigh he shook his head helplessly as another wave took him.
I shook his head to clear it of memories.  “Her whims?”
“That’s ludicrous!”
John shook his head.  “I’m really close.”  Crawling forward, he lounged beside his lover, continuing his movements.  “Kiss me.”
“That’s not your place!” John hissed before moaning as Sherlock ground their hips together.
Irene smirked and unzipped Sherlock’s trousers, keeping her eyes on his as she opened his clothing.
“You’re not angry?” I looked at him.
Rosie grew.  Small things amused her.  Her king was her favorite person.  Whenever she was fussy or fitful she would calm immediately when placed in Sherlock’s arms.  It was as if he had a gift… Or at least her wet nurse claimed it was so.
“John?”  Sherlock’s voice queried.
“Who else would fill your needs?” John looked up at him.  “Or suck your cock.”
“Do you know what pairs of male swans do?  They court a female and impregnate her and then chase her off after she lays a clutch of eggs for them…”
“Sherl… It’s alright.”  John said, quickening his strokes.
“Well, yes.  And no.” Sherlock clarified.  “I mean it was good.  But…”
I hugged her.  “Shh… It’s ok.”  I soothed her back and cradled her against my chest.
“How far will you let it go?  You are aware at least theoretically what a bed slave does.  Can you go that far?”
Sherlock shook his head.  “I can’t tell.  I can only show.”
“What are centaurs like?”
John gave a soft sigh and climbed onto the bed.  His fingers lightly touched where my slick came from.  “Are you sure?”
John took my decision from me by rolling us over so he was on top.  His hand took my erection and began an almost brutal rhythm.  I liked it when he took control.  Within a few strokes I was blissfully unaware of anything but him.  I gasped for breath after my climax, covered in our combined semen.
