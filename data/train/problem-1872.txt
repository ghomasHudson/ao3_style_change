“Well, not recently or I’d know where John was now wouldn’t I?” Becca said, uncoiling the tubing.
Sherlock said something unintelligible.
“That only happens when two people haven’t been able to find their true Soul Mate and settle for friendship. I already have a Soul Mate, and I don’t have, want or need friends. If that’s all, I have better things to do than talking to a half crazed vampire.” Sherlock stood up to leave.
“Check.” John said, placing the gloves on the nightstand.
He was dressed in casual clothes. Sherlock was surprised. He hadn’t expected the door to be answered by a man wearing a satin robe - Doctor Watson was aware that this was to be an interview about the crimes, after all - but he hadn’t expected him to be dressed as if he was headed for a walk in the park either.
“Will do! Goodnight, Doctor Watson.”
“Yes. I am. I was. Until all of this happened. I’ve let my lease go month to month for the moment. I’m not jumping into a relationship with anyone before I even know if I like them much less ‘know’ that they’re the ‘one.’ Didn’t your brother tell you that?” John asked, frustration clear in his voice.
“John is new to this life. So far he’s only been able to tell when I’m around. He doesn’t have the experience and knowledge that we have. That vampire just sat in here, sipping coffee with John, biding his time while spinning his web.”
“Actually, I did but I’m certain that you’d prefer to avoid the A&E when I had to take you there for nicotine poisoning.”
“Just, don’t be a cock. What did you do? Obviously, you found the cigarettes but…” John said, studying Sherlock intently.
John let Sherlock’s cock slide out of his mouth and asked, “Something wrong?”
“Anyhow, you were saying?”
“You’re going to take a break now, Sherlock. Ok?”
“What’s he want now?”
“At this moment, that would be you, John. The other victim is deceased, they’re already taken care of at moment.”
John sighed.
“Ow! Ow! The fuck are you trying to do? Break my arms?!” Sherlock yelled.
“How much have you had to drink, John?” Sherlock asked.
“Is that…yes. It is. That’s steam pouring off of your head. My, my. So angry! Ah, ah, ah! No head butting. That’s not nice.” John reached down and grabbing the wraps around Sherlock’s ankles, maneuvered him into a sitting position against the headboard.
“Afraid not. I’ll keep my blood on the inside,” Sherlock replied, unimpressed. “You’re not trying very hard to remain hidden. What brings us to this coffee shop in the middle of the night?”
“Boss? Who?” John asked slowly, eyelids beginning to droop as the drug began to take effect.
“I can hear your jaw cracking and I’m beginning to feel guilty.”
“At this point, I’m willing to do almost anything to make this stop.” John said, breath hitching.
“That’s the only thing that’s soft,” John said with a grin before pulling Sherlock even closer for a more passionate kiss, entwining his tongue with Sherlock’s.
“Yet you took them on as clients,” Sherlock said pointedly.
“Probably.”
“Please organize the forensic team, they’re milling around like ants at a barbecue,” said Lestrade as he huffed up the hill.
“I believe that we still have to finish the script,” Sherlock said with a grin.
“Obviously you can work with the incompetents and good luck with that.” John said smugly.
“Doctor Watson,” the man said.
“Not really. I asked about the fastest way of starting a hive and showed him my list of flowers and that was pretty much it. He had the starter hive delivered two days ago, once the plants had been set up. Which Mycroft’s gardener did for me, by the way. Actually, Mycroft never did name a price. I’m starting to worry.” John did indeed look worried.
John didn’t think, just immediately pulled his mobile from his jacket’s inner pocket and called Harriet. He’d kept track of her phone number all of these years, although he didn’t exactly know why. It wasn’t as if he’d ever planned to contact or see her again. He hadn’t spoken to her since he’d joined the army.
“Don’t remind me. Waste of space. I’ll be glad when he leaves. Nothing but trouble. All those Alpha’s sniffing around him all the time. Disgusting.” Mr Watson took a sip from his pint and Harry seized her chance to pass along John’s trouble to their father.
“Please, John. Please stop. I’ll do whatever you want.”
“Yes. Of course. I can’t let you go now.”
“I said, 221B Baker’s Street, immediately!”
“I know, da. John’s always been such a disappointment. I do have an idea though, if you’re interested…” Harriet said placing her hand on her father’s arm and giving him her patented (only worked on her father) sweet and innocent look.
“You want John. I want you to get John.”
“What else could there possibly be?”
“We’re good Catholics John…”
“You could run down before you go to work and…” Sherlock began.
“Give that information to Three Continents Watson? You might start out just wanting to try it once, but then it’d turn into an abuse of power and I can’t allow that to happen.”
“Too bad. You really don’t know what you’re missing.” Irene said, a smile accompanying that statement.
“I don’t want anything else. Just consider this a break.” Sherlock said nervously, still holding Watson’s wrist.
“Not officially, no but it’s very small and hasn’t changed since I showed you the first pictures of it.”
“Wait. How can he know anything about us?”
“Read the room, Sherlock. No. It’s not working.”
“No. Nothing. I didn’t see a thing,” Anderson got out, his face staining an ugly red.
“So, it’s hospital for you next time? Got it.” John smiled as he cleaned the few things he’d used to work on Sherlock’s back.
“Were you getting close at all?”
John legged it from one end of the alley to the other. He checked for possible hiding places and then finished by walking several steps onto the walkways outside of the alley just to make sure that no one had hidden in a doorway.
“We can talk about it later.”
The ever charming Sherlock meets John for the first time during a chase.
“Well, first of all, one of the stage directions is to force you face down on the floor and enter you all in one push,” John waited.
“Because this is all a glamor. The feelings are real but you never would have acted on them so quickly, if at all, if I hadn’t forced you too.”
“Espresso? EXTRA espresso? I’ll be climbing the walls if I drink that entire cup.” John said, laughing.
“Ah. I see,” Sherlock said, eyes lighting up.
“It was? I just murdered that flower for love. Is it still romantic?”
“Quiet, Harriet. Catholics don’t have abortions! What would the neighbors think? What would the family think? We’d be ostracized!”
“Don’t get any ideas. I’d hate to have to kill you.”
“Later. Ooh. We’ll talk later. Squeeze it tighter.”
John sat on the bed next to Sherlock’s thighs and began organizing the few items in front of him. Reaching over for the gloves, he slowly drew each one on in a distinctly lascivious manner.
Slowly riffling John’s hair, Sherlock made a seemingly casual remark.
“Right. Of course you were because you’re a sneaky bastard and didn’t want to get caught with the evidence.”
Sherlock was panting and moving his hips erratically causing John’s fingers to slip out. Sherlock finally got a rhythm going and he thrust forward into John’s fist and then back onto John’s fingers.
“Same,” Sherlock said simply and seriously.
More silence.
“God. It’s the only thing in the front seat that says ‘Blood Infusion Warmer.’”
Purple is ‘baingani’ and represents magic and mystery.
Their coffee came and they both added cream and sugar. Sherlock, in John’s opinion, putting a ridiculous amount of sugar in his cup.
“Don’t worry about it. You good for it,” said John, following through with original attack and forcing Sherlock down on his back.
“Listen,” Sebastian started.
“You know for what.”
“Yes, dear. I know.”
“Why is lube ok for this and not penetrative sex?” Sherlock asked, genuinely curious.
Sherlock easily carried John up the 17 steps to his flat, opened the door, and took John into his bedroom. He removed his jacket and shoes then dropped him unceremoniously onto his bed. It didn’t look like the most comfortable position but Sherlock had had enough of Doctor Watson and he wasn’t his butler.
Yep. Pompous arse. John had learned the hard way not to be a very trusting person when he met someone new and said;
“No,” Sherlock said.
“But it so much fun and so accurate. I’d feel bad…” Sherlock started.
“I love you too, you crazy, crazy man. Now go to sleep.” Sebastian stood to leave.
“This is worse. This is most definitely worse. I hope that I don’t wind up in hospital because of this. Sherlock would be furious,” John said, with a poor attempt at humor.
John entered the flat, taking in all of the scientific equipment crowding the kitchen and the books stacked into precarious towers. Other than the furniture, there wasn’t an empty spot in the flat.
“Fine. How about…” Sherlock began.
She prided herself on her ability to sense what a man was looking for and playing the part to entice him to ‘treat’ himself. They all loved that one. They could be the biggest arsehole in London but they’d still believe that they weren’t able to 'relax and enjoy' themselves with their wives/mistresses. They deserved to be pampered. They 'owed it' to themselves. Men were so easy to manipulate that it wasn’t a challenge anymore. Until Sherlock had appeared at her door dressed as a reverend. He’d taken her breath away in that moment and had never given it back.
“What happened to their necks?”
“That word was the final push that I needed to come. I wouldn’t want to go through this again but I’m happy with the way it turned out.”
“Damn right you are! Uhhhhhh!” John grunted shooting his load deeply into Sherlock.
“This is my job, Sherlock. I won’t have you forcing me to act in an unprofessional manner. Now lay there and try to be quiet because I’ll be ignoring you anyhow.” Becca turned and went into the lav to scrub up.
Sherlock,
“Darling. This is Vivian Westwood. You’re wrinkling the cut!”
“John. May I call you John.”
Gesturing to the bed, Becca said;
John kicked off his shoes, pealed off his socks, and had his trousers removed completely all in under 60 seconds.
“Good. Now stop being a creeper and come back to bed. Why we’re texting between the bedroom and the kitchen in the same house is beyond me.
“Where are they going?”
“How dare you make that kind of decision without my permission! My baby’s sterile now?!”
“Who is this…man and why is he here before me much less touching my body?” Sherlock demanded.
There was a hook on the wall next to John’s elbow on which Sebastian hung the IV. John sleepily wondered why he’d never noticed hooks in the morgue drawers. Sebastian, seeing John’s questioning look, said;
“But what about your poor back?” John asked, lining the head of his cock with Sherlock’s hole.
“Stop. Just stop right there. My work is important too. Actually, I’d say that it was often more important than yours seeing as most of my patients usually start out alive and I tend to keep them that way.”
“Never mind. We can discuss it later…”
“Yes. I am,” he sighed as John lifted Sherlock’s right leg and pulled it high over his hip.
Moriarty’s Safe House
He added a bit to Sherlock’s hole and slowly slid his index finger in.
“Don’t be ridiculous. With the amount of overtime you put in? I’d be surprised if someone didn’t drag you out of here kicking and screaming just to force you take a break and do something different for a change.”
“Last chance. Do you want to use your safe word?”
“Jesus Christ, John!”
“I want to see my son before I leave!” Mrs Watson demanded.
“You think that THIS, is romantic?”
‘That’s interesting,’ John thought. ‘Sherlock clearly doesn’t want me doing this. I wonder why…’
“I look down. People look down from time to time,” John protested with a blush.
Moriarty’s coquettishness suddenly vanished and he looked up at Moran with eyes as black and shiny as polished onyx.
“Maniac? OH! You mean Sherlock. He ran into you? Did he stop at least?”
“I swear, I’m going to kill that woman one day.”
“You’re being unreasonable, John!” Sherlock said, now giving up all pretense of subtlety and demanding that John just do what he said.
“Lift up a bit so that I can pull these pesky trousers and pants down.”
“Ah! The lovely Dahlia. This particular one has the show name of Bishop of Llandaff. Dahlias can represent a lot of different things but commitment is what's termed as its general meaning.”
“Why, what’s to stop me from “convincing” some nurse to overdose him with insulin? Whoopsy! That’d be a nice clean kill and the nurse would just think she slipped. Perhaps an overdose of narcotics? That’d be a little tougher to pull off since he’s not a known drug user, still accidents happen all the time,” Moriarty laughed.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock huffed.
“Now I’m sure you’re wondering about the repeated rape of Harriet by her father - your grandfather, and if this was true, why didn’t your grandmother or your other “sister” do anything even after Harriet finally told them about it. The fact is, they just didn’t believe her. Or wouldn’t. Not to mention the fact that they refused to believe that such a thing would be going on without them knowing about it. Things became even worse for you after that.
“You know you don’t mean that,” Sebastian said and deeming the blood warm enough for the first go round, hung the bag on the IV stand and connected it to one of the lines currently feeding John. He then went over and did the same thing on the other arm, hooking up the saline and setting both IVs to drip full tilt.
“Fuck you, Watson! You’re no doctor!”
“Good, well…are you a violent man, John?”
“Stop! Stop Harry! You’re hurting me! You’re going to kill the baby! Please!” John begged.
“You’re a scientist. You usually try to learn everything about a subject you’re involved in. I’d call it research but we both know that you just dive in with both feet…” Sherlock suddenly looked even more nervous.
“Not so fast. One more thing…”
“You. He’s talking about our future living arrangements and being a complete arse - as usual - about it.
“What do you mean, you “can’t justify” having John’s old schedule reinstated?! You’re on the Board of Trustees! The Holmes’ have contributed hundreds of millions of pounds to St Bart’s. Not to mention the expense of new buildings “specializing” in disease control. I think that you CAN but WON’T, correct this…this mistake.” Sherlock huffed.
John was so hard he thought he might burst. He needed to fuck Sherlock before he shot his load and became too sensitive to take John’s cock.
“Why aren’t you making any noise? Doesn’t this feel good?”
“That would save a lot of angst while also opening a whole new can of worms. Sherlock’s not going to like this so I’ll do it! Now you owe me. What are you going to do for me?” Becca wheedled.
John walked back into the bedroom where Sherlock was in the process of turning over onto his back.
Molly maintained her blush.
“Ugh! When did you become disgusting, Irene?” Sherlock asked, rubbing the saliva from his face with the sleeve of this shirt. ‘That one’s going in the trash’ he thought.
“Why…what…,” John sputtered.
“Um…anal…speculum…” And here, Sherlock trailed off, biting nervously at his thumb.
Suddenly, a man pushed his way through the throng of people yelling; “Let me through, I’m a doctor!”
—Mycroft”
“So Gregory said. I’m glad that you were paying attention despite,” Mycroft gestured at their undignified position, “all of this.”
Pushing Sherlock back down, John licked his way across Sherlock’s sharp hips and smooth, alabaster stomach. Upon reaching his goal, John placed his lips over Sherlock’s cock head and sucked him completely into his mouth in one go.
“How can you NOT want to? I want to and you always want to when I want to,” Sherlock said, getting unreasonably frustrated.
He was about to stand and begin gathering everything to get dressed when Sherlock reached over and pulled him back down into a sitting position on the side of the bed.
“Good job, man. Now that the police are here, it’s best that you both go inside and make sure that your customers haven’t gotten into your top shelf liquors,” Lestrade joked.
“Sure it will,” John assured him.
I will edit live later, as usual although the story won't change, just the spellos and any continuity issues. (Don't bother commenting that 'spello' isn't a word. I'm aware of that, I just like it better than 'typo' and I make up words, so there! NAH!)
“A cheater? What a surprise. My turn.” Then John balled up his fist and nailed Anderson in the shoulder right between the joints. Anderson’s arm immediately went numb.
“Hmmm?’
“Becca.”
“You can’t smell anything. I’m on suppressants!”
“I’m not going to tell you that, silly! I’m not an idiot!
He’d been packed up and ready to leave the lab since 12:45am but kept putting it off. First by straightening anything that seemed remotely disorganized followed by shuffling and reshuffling the paperwork on his desk for things that were scheduled for tomorrow. Well, today.
“Not now, Sherlock.” Sherlock opened his mouth to speak and John raised one finger to him saying, ”Not now. Later. I promise. Now make with the snuggling.” John said, turning on his side and facing away from Sherlock.
Glancing at his mobile, Sherlock snorted and tossed it to John.
“Yes. The mind boggles. Now, what can I help you with, Mycroft?”
“Ah! You’re awake! Good! I was beginning to think that you were going to sleep forever. I just came in to change the bag connected to your IV.”
"Hmm..." John paused fucking Sherlock with his fingers to ponder the question.
“Then go to a clinic,” John piped up. “Although I doubt they have a cure for the attitude adjustment of which you’re badly in need.”
“Oh. Yes. The boss, Moriarty, you might have heard of him, has been somewhat patiently waiting while I gained your trust. I must admit that I actually do enjoy your company though and I sincerely hope that you make it through this.”
Returning his attention to Sherlock’s cock, John gripped it in his right hand and rubbed the tip against his lips interspersed with gentle butterfly kisses. Looking up and meeting Sherlock’s eyes, he began licking his cock slowly as if it was the most delicious ice cream he’d ever had then began sucking on the head.
“Well, if they’re so bad, why is there a pack always hidden somewhere in the flat?” Sherlock asked logically, squinting his eyes as it was now beginning to feel like his back was on fire.
“Too much,” Sherlock said, without moving.
Sherlock allowed his gaze to travel from Doctor Watson’s shoes to his chest with a moment too long spent staring at Watson’s crotch. Sherlock shook himself and continued his study until he’d reached Watson’s smirking face.
“Drugged? The coffee was drugged? Why? Was I just injected with something or did I imagine that?” John asked, addressing the most recent issue on his mind.
“I was drugged into a stupor, is what I was.” Sherlock said, turning on his side and facing John.
I hear that congratulations are in order. Can we expect a happy announcement some time in the near future?
Downstairs in 221A, a sudden whirlwind started out of nowhere, picking up papers and scattering them all around the room. A form began taking shape out of mist and then Mrs Hudson was there, dressed in her housecoat and apron.
"Ah, but then, I'm well known for being obnoxious so it doesn't count. As to why I'm standing here; I've recently discovered your interest in my buttocks so I thought that, rather than sit on it, I'd put it on display for your enjoyment," he finished calmly. The bloody bastard had yet to turn around and was intentionally flexing his arse for my benefit.
“Yes, John.”
“Fine. Aubergine. That’s my safe word. This is the only time you’ll ever hear me say it though so cherish the memory.”
The doctor stuck his head in the curtain and said; “Time’s up.”
December 9th, continued…
“Wha…what are you doing?” Sherlock asked.
“Tell me this, at least; was the word to make you come ‘red’? Passion, love, fertility? Seems like the logical choice. Am I right?”
“My know it all, busy body brother.” Sherlock said, irritation clearly evident in his voice.
“John. I want you,” he said, trying to pull John’s arms away from the chest that they seemed to be locked to.
“How did you find me anyway?” John asked as Sherlock pulled him to his slightly wobbly feet.
“Let me go, John. The case is over and…
“I told you, that stuff doesn’t work on me.”
“Wait. Just wait. I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Yes? It doesn’t just say “anal.””
"Well..." Mycroft started awkwardly.
Mycroft rolled his eyes.
“You’ve been spending too much time around Moriarty!”
“But…”
“Can you feel this?” John asked as he lazily stroked Sherlock’s cock head.
“No. It’s not just that I won’t do it. I physically can’t do it. My shoulder can’t support that kind of pressure and you know it.”
“Don’t try to figure him out, dumpling. It’ll only give you a headache. From what I gathered from your side of the conversation, you’re going to need enough drugs to keep Sherlock out for at least two days? He’s going to be really mad.”
TRIGGER WARNINGS: Mentions of rape (not detailed), child abuse (detailed). Heed the trigger warnings up top. They will definitely change as the story progresses.
“John! Don’t! You’re hurting him!”
The problem was he didn’t like the idea of being penetrated. He’d tried with other men before but couldn’t get past the symbolism of another man dominating him - even if only sexually.
“Oh no. I believe it.”
Sherlock smoothed John’s hair away from his brow and kissed him there.
In the morning, they’d discuss Sherlock leaving the wet flannels in the middle of the bed ending with them both waking up on the wet spot before John realized what had happened.
"Yes. God help me, I do."
“It’s a little funny.” Sherlock walked over to John and wrapped an arm about his waist.
Irene herself rarely took a client unless there was something about them that she found irresistible. And even then, she only entertained women now. She’d done her time pandering to male vanity while coming up in the business and once she’d started to feel resentful and bitter, she’d stopped seeing men altogether. But Sherlock? He was different. It didn’t hurt that he was androgynous, beautiful, and sexy as hell. She found him irresistible but the feeling, other than a mutual respect - he appreciated her as an intellectual equal - were not returned. His tendencies didn’t lean that way and there was nothing that would persuade him otherwise. And she’d really tried. Pity.
He dug around on of the many junk drawers in his desk trying to find a pen, and set about fixing the cards. He paused after fixing them and figured he might as well leave a bit of a note in there. He set them up on the coffee table, leaving the cards in a pile and siting the bee up properly so when Rosie came in, she could see her.
“You,” John started, blinking and looking Sherlock up and down. “You’re . . . something else.” It felt like the air was sucked out of the room at John’s words. He barely had time to process the words before he felt a hand on the back of his neck, pulling him down so their lips could slot together.
Perhaps this wasn’t such a good idea, Sherlock thought as he stood in front of the sea of cards before him. John would probably be upset with him in any case, but something just told him he had to do it. Some part of him decided he should try to get them something. Years ago, he wouldn’t have given the date a second thought, but so much had changed in that time. He was a Godfather now, a best friend, and he realized how precious those around him really were and how quickly he could lose it all.
“Right,” John said, his eyes boring into the back of Sherlock’s head for a moment. “I’ve got to go or I’ll be late. I’ll, uh, pick her up after my shift then?” He asked, giving Rosie a quick kiss on her head before starting towards the baby gate, simply staring down at it.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes
Everyday you show me just how STRONG, UNDERSTANDING, and GIVING you are. I’m so happy to be spending life loving you.
“I put glue on it!” She said, full of pride. Sherlock gave her a smile.
Two days online, various websites, and several thousand pounds later, Sherlock let out an annoyed sigh. Between the repairs to Baker Street, shopping for Rosie, and just the basic essentials of living, he was seriously running low on funds. Oh well. For a Watson, it was worth it.
He ripped open the envelope and slid the card out. The front of the card had his mouth going dry, his heart beat picking up in his chest. “To the man who has my heart,” John read softly, not believing Sherlock would pick out a card like this. He opened it, unsure what he’d find there. He tried to swallow the lump in his throat.
He looked at his phone, seeing that it was marked read with no response. He hadn’t told John about what he had done to the upstairs. It felt a little silly to bring it up and ask if it was okay. It was his flat, even though it was John’s old room. He should be allowed to do with it as he pleased. And, as it happened, he so wished to make it feel more like a second home for John’s daughter.
Rosie had been staring at the writing, not really understanding anything it said, before she pointed at the other card on the table. “Who’s that for?” She asked, holding the bee closer to her chest. It was obvious she was becoming quite attached to it.
He shook his head, letting out a sigh, but couldn’t stop the smile on his face. She couldn’t go up the steps quickly, needing to take them one at a time, but was going as fast as she could. You’d think she was told she was going to Disney or something with how excited she was. He always seemed to be just as excited to see her as well.
“Yeah!” She said, seeming to remember what she had done at school. She let go of his legs and started to dig through her bag, pulling out a bit of craft paper covered in stickers, glue, and cotton balls, and glitter. She had tried to trace his name, which had been clearly written by an adult, with the glitter glue, but had made a mess of it.
room?”
Sherlock wasn’t sure how he found himself in Mothercare, staring at an overload of baby supplies, clothes, and a sea of pastels. He couldn’t blame a distracted mind simply carrying his legs here without any knowledge as he had to actively find the nearest one to him, surprisingly close to Baker Street. So much so, that he was shocked he had not realised it sooner.
“Do you . . . d’you really mean it? What the card said?” He asked, afraid to speak louder than a whisper.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she said, her eyes getting misty. He hadn’t been expecting that reaction. He had thought she might smile, want a hug, and be on her way back inside her flat. He stood there awkwardly for a moment, unsure what he was supposed to do about the threat of tears. He had just been trying to do something nice after all she had done for him. Seeming to understand that he was out of his depth, she stepped closer and gave him a hug. He wrapped his arms around her smaller frame and returned the hug, giving a gentle squeeze before stepping back. “Thank you.” He gave her another smile as he handed them over to her. She took the flowers and box of chocolates before dabbing at her eyes with a tissue she had pulled out of her pocket. He stood there for another moment before clearing his throat.
“I think we should. And if the state of my trousers are anything to go by, we should make haste.” They began walking to the fire escape, arm in arm when Sherlock suddenly stopped, jogged back, looked at the red dahlia’s and regretfully snapped one off and handed it to John.
“Stop,” Sherlock said but there was no heat behind it.
“Ow! I scanned it. I don’t remember anything about biting!”
“Does it involve nudity?”
“Because that’s too much power for anyone to hold over me and I don’t like being out of control and at someone else’s mercy.”
"Why haven't I heard of this through the Yard?"
“Don’t be sorry. I neither want nor need your faith in me to accomplish a mission. I will take you and you will thank me for it.”
“I have to get on top of you.”
“Come on,” John said, moving forward and pressing himself against Sherlock’s back said, “It’ll be fun.” John emphasizing that last bit with a wiggle of his hips.
“Sorry that I took so long but I was a little…excited after that last scene so I jerked off to relieve some of the tension. I wasn’t going to last ten more minutes at that rate. Now, the pressure’s off and I can take my time with you. Isn’t that nice?” John smiled at Sherlock who remained face down on the bed, awaiting further instructions.
“You know who. John Watson! What have you done with him?!” Sherlock asked, tightening his hold on the collar just enough to cause Moran to cough.
"We'll, uh, discuss this later. Oh, right there!" Sherlock moaned.
“NO!” John said, stomping to the door to the flat, slamming it so hard that the panes of glass rattled in their frames.
John stopped about an arm’s length away, fists balled up, breathing barely under control.
“You’re insane.”
“You came down here just to tell me that?!” Sherlock said, astonished.
“Once upon a time…” Sherlock began.
“What’s that wobble?”
Ok, Sherlock. Scissors beats paper. You loose," John said. "Now, pay up," he said with a wicked grin.
“I don’t have a name for my cock. What should I call it?”
“Ooh! The plot thickens! Do tell? Why do you need my girl… Ah! You’re in luck! She just walked in.”
"The coffee table? Again? My hips are still bruised from the last time," Sherlock complained.
“Nothing to do with me? I have friends, mum! How long do you think I’ll have them when they find out that my brother's a slag.”
“And…is there…an ‘us’?” Sherlock asked, afraid of the answer.
“Slow down, Rosebud,” John said, watching as Rosie nearly ran towards the door once the car pulled up to Baker Street and the door opened. He picked up her bag from the passenger's seat and started towards the door, finding the key on his key ring. “I’m sure he isn’t going anywhere,” he said, unlocking the door and pushing it open for her. She wasted no time, ripping her bag out of John’s hand and started towards the steps as quickly as she could.
“She in your room?” John asked, catching sight of Sherlock at the desk on his laptop.
But it was the single greatest thing to have ever happened to him in his entire life. For the first time since before Sherlock left, Baker Street was finally starting to feel like home.
John reached out, ever so slowly, to touch Sherlock’s cheek, afraid he’d jerk away at any moment. Sherlock let out a sigh and leaned his cheek more into his hand. “You utter cock,” John said, leaning forward and pressing his lips briefly to Sherlock’s own. “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
He sent back quickly, setting his phone aside and going to take a careful sip of the tea. He paused with his lips on the rim before reaching out to grab his phone and send another quick message.
Not beta'ed. Any mistakes are my own. Do let me know if you catch any so I can make changes. Thank you!
John looked at the front of the card, a bright pink elephant shooting hearts out of his trunk. “To my Goddaughter,” John said, unable to keep the smile out of his voice at the scribbled addition in Sherlock’s own hand. He opened the inside. “Don’t forget my love for you on this Valente’s Day,” he said, pointing at the printed words and moving over to the handwritten note. “Thinking of you and the joy you bring me. Forever your Godfather, Sherlock.”
John and Rosie stop at Baker Street for a Valentine's day surprise.
John remembered the gate when he went up the next time. He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, perhaps Rosie on the floor as she usually was or inside a Pack-and-Play Sherlock had bought along with the gates, but she was nowhere in sight.
He had been worried about how things would work out with him and Sherlock now that Rosie was here. John had told him, in no uncertain terms that she would come first. Always. He figured they’d become distant and slowly grow apart. John never would have thought Sherlock would want to have anything to do with his daughter and would find her more of a distraction, but he seemed as head over heels with her. He had taken to her as quickly as John had and was always asking if John was going to be bringing Rosie with him when he said he was going to pop over for a visit. Somehow, along the way, visiting Baker Street had become a nearly daily thing.
“I see that. Brilliant use of glue.” He placed it front and center on the fridge with a magnet. “There. Now everyone can see your artistic use of glue and glitter.” She beamed. “I’ve got something for you as well. It’s by the couch.” And then she was off like a rocket towards the couch, wondering what it could be.
By the time all the things he had ordered arrived, and he had them set up, and ready to be used, the flat was officially done and blessedly empty. When Sherlock had thought months ago that the flat had felt too lonely and quiet, he hadn’t wanted the commotion of construction crew bustling about the place and getting their grubby hands on everything. He felt like he could finally relax, everything in place and finally settled. It was just as he was sitting down in his chair, a warm cuppa in his hands when his phone alerted him to a text.
“Well,” Sherlock said, having followed John up the steps. He stood behind him, looking into the room that had John stumped. “She’s a Watson and Watsons deserve only the best.” He shoved his hands in his pockets and rocked on his feet, nervous and unsure what John’s reaction meant.
“Sherlock,” John breathed out, both keeping his voice quiet both for Rosie’s sake and because he was almost afraid that the sound would turn the illusion in front of him back to reality. “What have you done?” It wasn’t an accusation. His voice carried with it wonder and awe, unable to believe what he was really seeing.
“Is that Rosie and John?” He heard the rumble of Sherlock’s voice from the the top of the stairs and Rosie seemed to nearly vibrate out of her skin at the sound of his voice. It was obviously them, as they always came around this time on days when Rosie had daycare,but the question was more for Rosie's sake than anyone else's.
With that done, he made his way towards the kitchen to put the kettle on. John would want a warm cuppa when he got to Baker Street and Rosie would no doubt want some snacks. So, he set about making a veggie tray for her and the teas for John and him before they arrived.
“That’s for me,” John said, setting her down and handing her the plate with vegetables on it. “Why don’t you go enjoy that in the sitting room, hmm?” He asked. She grabbed the plate with one hand, already nearly tipping the food onto the floor, and started towards the sitting room.
kiss. Too rough. Too sudden. Both too much space between them and not enough.
“Um,” Sherlock said, looking around. Usually he was more eloquent than this, but he did not even know where to begin. “I could use some assistance.” He turned a full circle, taking in the store and everything inside, before turning to the woman again. “Do you not have cots?” He asked. He knew the store wasn’t all that large, but surely there were cots somewhere.
“I was unaware you had a website,” Sherlock said, pulling out his mobile and doing a quick search. It took less than a second for the page to pop up, annoying color scheme and flashy sales that Sherlock doubted would even be useful. “Thank you for your assistance,” he muttered, not once looking up from his phone as he feet carried him back home.
to see. Sherlock wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do, the tension thick and his heart pounding in his ears. He didn’t dare look away.
“Yeah,” John said, glancing at Sherlock who had turned back to the countertop, seeming to busy himself with something else. John sat down and pulled Rosie onto his lap. “Let’s see,” he said, setting the one aside that said “John” and opening the one that said “Rosie”.
“We’re here!” John called up from the stairs, taking them quickly enough. He must have listened to Sherlock then. Usually it took him a lot more time as he had to carry both Rosie and all of her things. He stopped at the top of the steps, making a curious noise in his throat. “What’s this then?” he asked as Sherlock looked up at him standing on the opposite side of the gate he had put up.
Now with Rosie staying over so much, it was becoming annoying to carry so much around for her. A travel cot, a nappy bag, a small travel bag for toys and clothes, and anything else she might need. It seemed a bit excessive to tote it all back and forth from John’s flat to Sherlock’s. He couldn’t count the amount of items that had been lost in transit: nappies, dummies, socks, toys, and so many other casualties left behind in the streets and in the cabs of London. It made more sense to simply stock up on the necessities at Baker Street than need to lug everything back and forth. Sherlock just wished he didn’t feel as out of his depth as he did.
“Bloody fucking-.” He swore under his breath, nearly tripping over the thing and just barely catching himself before he properly fell onto it. The quick urge to kick the stupid thing passed over him before he glanced down at the display. It was a small set up of cards and in them one happen to catch his eye. He reached out, quickly flipped it open to scan the words. Not bad. He could work with it. It would need some things crossed out, some things added, but it was promising. He added it to the card for Rosie.
Sherlock looked up from his laptop. He had just been reading a scientific journal article on up and coming methods for detecting toxins in blood, but it was more just for something quiet to do. What he’d really like would be to pick up his violin and play a bit, but he didn’t want to risk waking Rosie. He knew even a nice melody, if loud enough, could wake a toddler.
John tried to swallow around the lump in his throat, rereading the message inside and unable to believe the words were true. Did he really mean all that? Could he . . .? He looked up to see Sherlock studying him, wondering if he was understanding what was really being said in the card.
“See you then,” Sherlock said, turning just in time to catch John’s eye. He gave him a small smile and John tried to return it before heading back down the steps, stopping after a few to go back up and lock the gate again.
“Of course I did,” Sherlock responded and sipped his own tea. John didn’t noticed vegetable spread on a plate on the table. Clearly snacks for Rosie for after daycare. Never in a million years would John had thought that Sherlock would have been good at this sort of stuff, but he always seemed to knock him out of the park with his expectations.
“A baby gate, John. Honestly. It’s like you’ve never seen one before,” he said, getting up to unlock it for him, giving Rosie a smile. “Your dad’s a little slow today, isn’t he?” He asked, swinging the gate open and then locking it behind him. “Seemed the best way to keep her from the steps now that she’s starting to walk.”
Now with the flat coming to the end of construction, John was leaving Rosie with Sherlock more and more. It had started because John had an emergency come up at work, and Molly and Mrs. Hudson had both been busy that day, so Sherlock had offered to watch Rosie. Now, it seemed obvious that he would be the first person John went to. For the most part, Sherlock was free and didn’t mind having Rosie over. He took more cold cases or simple ones he could solve from the comfort of his flat, unwilling to ever put Rosie in any sort of danger. Not after what had happened to her mother. Sherlock wasn’t sure if he could live with himself if he took another person away from John. Besides, he had grown fond of the little Watson stumbling around the flat.
“We do sell cots, but this store doesn’t carry them. You could order from our website and have it delivered to your place,” she suggested, a smile still plastering her face. It was overly polite and completely fake.
“Hello! Can I help you?” asked an overly perky sales woman. A quick glance at her told Sherlock everything he needed to know. She was middle to late twenties, had some sort of reptile, was in a steady relationship, and was hoping to have kids of her own. Usually he would send an annoyed look her way or toss a scathing remark to make her leave him alone to do his own shopping, but he felt too far in over his head.
“I thought there were a few changes worth making,” Sherlock tried to say casually, not looking at John and instead focusing his attention on Rosie. “Just seemed a bit ridiculous to need to carry everything back and forth with how much I see her.”
room?” John asked, turning to look at the stairs leading up to his old room. There was a gate on those steps as well. “What do you mean
Sherlock only gave a single nod, refusing to break eye contact with him. John’s heart was pounding in his chest, blood rushing in his ears as he stood up. He hoped he wasn’t reading more into this than he thought. He hoped his understanding of what Sherlock meant was the correct one. He hoped he wasn’t going to make an utter fool of himself.
It wasn’t the blindingly brilliant kiss Sherlock had dreamed of when he allowed his mind to wonder. It wasn’t even a
“Hm? Oh, no. She’s upstairs in her room,” Sherlock said, flapping his hand towards the stairs that lead up to John’s old room.
He had started towards where he had seen some flowers, preparing to get some roses for Hudders. He was not sure what sort of card he was supposed to get her, so he figured some flowers would be alright. He was making his way there, weaving between people, when he nearly tripped over a stand set up in the middle of the isle.
“This for me?” He asked, taking the offered craft paper. She smile and he looked down at it. “It’s beautiful, Rosie. You did a fantastic job. I see you worked hard on it,” he said.
“Of course I did, John. How could I not? She deserves a proper place to sleep if I’m going to continue to watch her.”
“You didn’t have to get her anything,” John said, taking the offered tea.
“Right, well,” he trailed off, rocking on his heels, before turning and grabbing up his bag again. He heard her shut the door behind him, muttering about how lovely the flowers looked and where she would put them. He took the steps two at a time before throwing open the door to the kitchen to his left. John and Rosie would be home soon enough.He  needed to pick her up from daycare after work.  They’d stop by, as they always did, before they went back to their own flat. They'd stay for just a few hours for a visit. He knew he had only a few minutes before they pulled up. Today would be just like any other day she was at daycare. Afterwards Rosie always wanted to come to Baker Street to show Sherlock had she had done that day. The fridge was now covered in her drawings and work that she saved up for him. He proudly displayed every piece and carefully stored the ones that had been displayed for too long so he could keep a fresh rotation of her work up at all times.
Sherlock came to stand by John, taking Rosie from him and setting her on the ground so she could crawl about and play as she liked. He also looked around the sitting room, wondering what John was getting at for a moment before it dawned on him. Ah, yes. The baby proofing. He had made sure to make Baker Street safe for Rosie, covering outlets, making sure there were no dangling cords or things for her to pull, placing everything out of reach of her tiny grabby hands. There was a toy box shoved against the wall just under the window near the couch which Rosie now dug through, pulling out various toys Sherlock had bought online. A highchair was squeezed into the kitchen, which was spotless of lab equipment. He had them convert 221C into a small lab for him when they were working on 221B. He had talked to Mrs. Hudson who had agreed to allow it considering the mold and that she still couldn’t seem to rent it out.
“Ow! Goddammit! Why didn’t you tell me that it was going to hurt?!”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea…”
“I wasn’t talking about murder and an abortion isn’t murder. I wasn’t planning on getting an abortion anyhow. I believe that everyone has a right to choose and I don’t fault them for it but it’s not for me.”
“Why not indeed.” Mycroft glanced over at Greg who was looking a little sheepish.
“Busy day? Why?” Just then he looked at the clock on the nightstand.
“Didn’t Molly just tell you the cause of death?”
"What are YOU doing? Someone out there?" I asked a little breathlessly.
‘Damn, damn, and double damn! How could she know that?!’ Despite being the greatest, and only, Consulting Detective In The World, Sherlock wasn’t as self-aware as he seemed to think that he was.
“Yes. I do have him followed everywhere.
“Can’t touch silver? Can’t enter a church? Despise bloggers?”
“The case is solved, John! Isn’t that exciting to you?! When was the last time you had this much fun. A man had a foot in his mouth! That has to be worth something.”
“I am not “kidding” you. You’ll find that I don’t “kid.” I just didn’t think you were ready to handle it at the moment.”
"Not this time! Go!"
“I suppose if we moved you sideways over the bed, you could suck my cock a bit,” John said while simultaneously pressing his hand over his trousers against his burgeoning erection.
“Mistress Adler,” Sherlock said by way of greeting.
“It’s Miss Watson and fuck the baby. I just want it out of me. I don’t care what you do with it. Keep it. I don’t want it!”
“I don’t know. This is so sudden. I always said that if I was going to move in with someone, it wouldn’t happen without some serious vetting.” John stopped, thought for a second, then smiled.
“Indeed. Unless there’s a sign saying ‘He did it’ and pointing at the culprit, the NSY couldn’t detect their way out of a wet paper bag with a razor blade.”
John could feel his heart beating a mile a minute. It felt like it was doing summersaults in there. He put a hand to his chest, looking a little pained.
“You’re awfully confident.”
“He’s jealous of you and wants me for himself,” Sherlock replied.
“No. It was quite good, actually,” John said as he reached down to unbuckle Sherlock’s trousers.
“You know you love me!” John said, kissing Sherlock on the back of his head.
“God. What? Just tell me. I can’t deduce by looking at you which thing I’ve said that’s irritated you this time. So?”
“Wrap it up, Sherlock.”
One day he came home from school to find that Harriet had run away. Mummy was a little upset but other than that, no one in the family, other than Lawrence and his mum, who had had to quit her job to take care of them both, seemed to care why she’d left or where she’d gone. Especially John. Now he only had Lawrence to deal with although his aunt wasn’t much nicer and also had a temper just like daddy’s. She yelled at John a LOT but he never knew what he’d done wrong so he didn’t know how to fix it.
“So there are agents located within St Bart’s, then? Within John’s department?” Sherlock demanded.
Picking up his mobile, he hit speed dial, his call was answered on the first ring.
Releasing Sherlock’s hair, John used the same damp hand to flip up Sherlock’s robe followed by quickly sliding his pajama bottoms down until they just cupped his cheeks.
“Yes but they’re not exactly monogamous. Think of it as having a spouse and concubines although that’s not really apt because the concubines aren’t particularly monogamous either,” Sherlock said, bothered by not having a more concrete definition immediately to hand.
Moriarty shoved a well thumbed file across the table to him.
John pulled his bag higher on his shoulder and set off for home knowing that Sherlock would be following him all the way and finding that he didn’t mind it quite as much as he thought he should.
“Anderson! What the hell are you doing lurking in that alley? And why are your trousers unbuckled. Couldn’t you just find a loo like a normal person?” Lestrade barked.
“There’s more though. Maybe you should read the script fully before you agree to anything.”
Thursday
"Oh. Right. Not very sanitary. Sorry, dear." Mrs Hudson said, bustling over the table and setting the biscuits down. She made it to the front door to the flat, pausing on the threshold.
John reached around and grabbed Sherlock’s cock with his slick hand and began pumping him in counter point to John’s cock entering him.
Dearest John,
“If I can make you come in the next five minutes, you’ll let me fuck you up the arse tomorrow. Deal?”
“I’m lulling you into a false sense of security!”
“I’m here John. Ok?” Sebastian said softly when he returned.
“Sadly, no whips or paddles were specified. Only the use of my hand. Don’t worry though. I’ll make sure that you don’t feel cheated in the pain department,” John said, sitting on the sofa and patting his lap.
John and Sherlock layer sprawled on plastic sheeting, limbs tangled into an unnatural position.
“Don’t start that! And I want you right here in this position when I get back. I think that I’ll be mistress tonight. Get my strap on ready for me, darling. Would you?” Becca said to Irene with a smile who brightly returned it.
“Ok. What is it?”
“It’s, ah, a bit sudden, don’t you think?” John hedged.
"What are you doing, John?" Sherlock asked without turning around.
He was just about to make that suggestion when Sherlock shouted out, “JOHN!! Oh god. John, I’m coming!” And sure enough, Sherlock’s cock began pulsing with what seemed to John at least, an unusually large amount of come. Not a freakish amount but, well, the volume seemed to be more…plentiful than usual, to John.
“Sherlock. Calm down. You’re right. I was wrong not to trust your intuition and I’m sorry but apologies aren’t going to bring John back so gather up all the evidence you can find and bring it to my home. We’ll go through it first and then have it analyzed by forensics.”
John and Sherlock each took an unplanned step towards the other until the were suddenly in each other’s arms, placing passionate kisses over every bare patch of skin ending with their lips.
“Like what?” Sherlock asked innocently.
“Please. I want to feel something else besides this heartbreak. Even if it’s only for an hour or two. Please John?” Sherlock looked into his eyes and John knew that he could deny this man nothing.
“Were you ever violent with those particular men?” Sherlock asked.
"Boys!" Mrs Hudson called as she climbed the step to their flat.
“KILL A BEE!! Are you insane?! Where is it?!” Sherlock bellowed dashing towards the windowsill where a bee was buzzing happily in an upside down glass, a playing card beneath the opening.
‘Three continents Watson, my arse!’ Sherlock got on his knees and applied his mouth diligently to John’s cock which began to gratifyingly inflate.
“This is Trifolium or clover.”
“You need, ah hem, should there be more? I would think that the message is pretty clear at this point. I mean, if you’re right and there’s a message to be had in all of…this…,” John gestured vaguely to the flower boxes.
John began smacking Sherlock’s arse even harder than before. Around the twenty-fifth strike, Sherlock moaned. At thirty-five, he began pleading for John to stop.
“I wouldn’t do that were I you…” Sherlock began.
“That would be an affirmative,” Sherlock said. Apparently appearing out of thin air.
Warm regards,
“Well, coffee in general, is an acquired taste and espresso is an entirely different level of taste acquirement. I know that I won’t ever surprise you with Turkish coffee. That’d probably kill you!” Sebastian said, finishing his coffee and throwing it in the bin.
“There’s my sleepy head!” Becca said as she finished hooking up the new IV.
“Well, that must be why we still have so much of it. Come on. I’m not recommending this as a cure but for today, I think you need a little something to take the edge off. Alright? Trust me. I’m your doctor.” John smiled at him.
“Don’t you walk away from me! We’re not through!” Anderson yelled angrily then charged.
“John, dear. He’s the Greatest Consulting Detective in the world! He probably knew before you did…”
Sherlock tried sensing John again - still nothing. His mobile buzzed letting him know that he had a text. He wasn’t in the mood to play word games with Mycroft right now.
“I didn’t expect to see you here, Lestrade. Not anytime soon. Were you drinking on the job? How unprofessional of you.”
“So, we’ll drop them off at the dry cleaner’s on the way home. There. Problem solved.”
“Yes. Thank god for small favors,” Mycroft said imperiously.
“N-n-no, John.”
"I think I'll let you be the Master for a change."
“Sebastian Moran?” Sherlock demanded.
“You know what I’m talking about! That whiny baby voice that you put on when you want something that you already know that I’m going to say no to.”
“Yes…”
“You. You decide how many.”
“Oh, no reason.”
Sherlock stood in front of Irene Adler’s high end brothel contemplating his current case.
“Not ok but I can hear you. Can’t seem to open my eyes anymore. The lights are so bright.”
“This seems a round about way to get me into bed, doctor,” Sherlock said.
“NO! I’d like some privacy!”
“Come live with me and find out.” Sherlock leaned forward, took John’s hand and looked him in the eye.
Wednesday, March 20th
“No. YOU listen!” Becca set John’s wrist that she’d been holding, on the arm of the chair.
Truth be told, Sherlock enjoyed their little sparring matches. They both did. They were evenly matched in wit and intellect and had yet to find anyone that met either of those requirements, much less someone who had both. Not that they’d actually looked.
“That might be a bit difficult considering that you’re the coroner and I’m a consultant to Scotland Yard on murders that they can’t seem to solve. Since this happens regularly, we will be seeing a lot of each other. Unless you choose to quit, which I don’t think you will, we’ll be seeing each other often. Now, sit back down, John and just listen. You can yell all you want when I’ve finished.”
Sherlock felt arms wrap around his shoulders and then a huge, sloppy kiss was placed on his cheek.
This was new though. There was no way that Sherlock actually believed that the human body was hot enough to boil and egg. Whatever he wanted must really be a doozy this time.
“I only had hot water to warm it up and I was afraid that it would clot if I tried to heat it in the microwave,” Sebastian said nervously.
“Yes, my love?”
“I’ll give you a nicotine patch later if you’re good,” John wheedled having absolutely no intention of allowing Sherlock any more nicotine in any form tonight. He didn’t want to go to hospital either.
"Well, you know what to do," John said, patting the coffee table.
“I’m going to stop you right there. Where are you going? You’re leaving the scene already?”
“Did you kill those men?”
“First I’d like to make a…suggestion. Ok?”
They could hear Anderson sputter and cough over that.
“If you say so, John,” Sherlock said, casually brushing aside John’s concerns. “In any event,” he continued, “we’re here to discuss your background. That’s all. We can address your interest in having intercourse with me at a later date. I must admit that I’m a little intrigued by your admiration. It went straight to my groin.”
John turned around to find that Sherlock had changed into pajamas and what looked to be a satin robe.
“No.”
“Get up and stretch your legs. Try to get some feeling back into your arms. Then I want you in your bedroom, completely naked, face down on the bed.”
And so it was with a rare defeatist attitude that he walked up to the front door and knocked.
John turned and walked away. When he’d gone far enough that Anderson didn’t think he’d come back, he yelled;
“Were they also customers of Doctor Watson’s during this time?” Sherlock asked.
At Sherlock’s confused look, John said;
“Truth be told, I don’t feel so well,” John said a bit shakily.
“Take your shoes and socks off, then those trousers. I don’t want anything between us,” Sherlock groaned.
“LUBE! Lube, John!”
“Let’s go back to you losing that job for me before you even knew me.”
“We already have agents on the way to…ah…interview him.”
“Doing what?”
“I just want to look at it. See how bad the damage is. Give me your hand.” John held out his hand.
“Oh! What a relief! You’re not allergic or anything, are you? Actually, I guess we’d already have known that by now. So…you can drink then?” John asked.
It looks weird and I apologize but I hit the wrong button and reformatted my entire chapter. Since I was more concerned with losing the text than fixing it, I left it alone. I hope it's not too difficult to read.
“Oh, yeah. That,” John said gesturing to his rock hard and incredibly large cock.
“Oh my. He doesn’t look happy, does he.” Mrs Hudson stated.
‘I should call the cops,’ Will thought as he picked up the telephone receiver. John was obviously being forced against his will to go to somewhere he clearly didn’t want to go.
Wednesday 8pm
- MH”
“Sorry.”
Tearing open another packet containing an alcohol swab, Sebastian cleaned the area near John’s collarbone, preparing the site to be numbed. He jabbed the needle in several locations to make sure that the lidocaine was well distributed.
“I thought that was foreplay!” Sherlock complained.
“That was…different. What does it mean?”
“I think it more likely that I’d take a chunk out of your flesh considering that I don’t have fangs.”
"No you didn't and I couldn't care less. Say the thing again," John said.
“Really? That sounds lovely,” John enthused.
John began to slowly press forward until he’d breached Sherlock with the head of his cock. There was a sharp intake of breath.
When he’d recovered, he said, “Sir. You know that I despise Sherlock Holmes. Can’t stand the sight of him.”
“We are friends. That’s the only reason that I’ve been so kind and patient with you. I’m really not a nice person, John, and once the boss has you, well, playtime will be over. I’m truly sorry John.”
“Thank you, John but I assure you that I’m quite average,” Sherlock said with a blush that John found endearing.
“No. It seems to be stuck.”
I'm a ball of insecurity and Kudos make me want to write. Yes, I'm that needy.
“Because I read his file and he’s perfect for you. Definitely has the patience of a saint and lord knows that’s the only way you’ll ever get an Omega,” Mycroft said, his eyebrow raised.
“And stop struggling. You lost fair and square.”
TWACK! TWACK! TWACK TWACK! TWACK!
Wednesday
Red is ‘lal’ and is the ultimate color of love, passion, and fertility. And, finally, yellow…”
“True but I should have stopped you as soon as Lestrade and I made eye contact.”
“See! He looks just like you!" Elizabeth enthused.
John stopped walking and looked back at the mention of his name.
"Because you cheat! Why do I always have to be the bottom?!" Sherlock whined.
“Oh, no,” the nurse said hurriedly, “Miss Watson is exhausted. In fact, she’s probably already sleeping so you’d actually be helping her by looking after the baby until she’s moved to her room. New mothers need all the rest they can get.” The nurse waited anxiously to see if Mrs Watson would cooperate or if she’d be forced to tell her that Miss Watson had refused to look at the child, much less hold it.
“What’s that?” John asked nervously.
“He’s here full time. He makes more here in a week than he’d make in an entire year working in a clinic and he’s found a niche market that he’s cornered. As I said, he’s very good. Very talented. It’s almost supernatural at times. How he doesn’t have lockjaw by now, I don’t know.” Irene said, admiration clear in her voice.
“Thirsty…” Sherlock pouted.
“Because that means that all bets are off and I can cheat too!” John said, flipping Sherlock onto his stomach.
“Not tonight, Sherlock. I just want to go to sleep. It’ll keep until the morning, yeah?” John asked hopefully.
“That’s disgusting, John,” Sherlock said.
“That’s what I thought. Tah, darling. Try not to kill John,” Becca said, closing the door behind her.
“No. Really. You do,” John said, reaching over to give the other delectable globe some attention.
“Even if I was going into heat, I just can’t.”
Moran did as told, stomping angrily and sitting down in a nearby chair.
“Seb? Where am I? Was there some kind of accident in the lab?”
"We seem to have an alarming amount of government personnel turning up dead or worse,” said Mycroft.
“Come on. Don’t be like that! Have a drink,” John said, holding the glass up to Sherlock’s lips which he stubbornly refused to open.
“Yes, sir.”
Eventually, Elizabeth started noticing that John had begun having accidents around the house - often. The only one who was ever around to see what had happened was Harriet who blamed the child for being clumsy.
He took pictures anyway even as the surf gradually erased them until there was nothing left but foam and muddy sand. Even if he never found a use for them, better to have them than not.
Certainly, he could do one without the other; he was a genius after all, but that would be a waste of his valuable time - even if that time was just spent lying on the couch.
“Well, well, well. Not even five minutes in and I’ve already pinned you. With ease, I might add. Surrender?”
“That’s better. Relax your thighs!” John said, slapping the back of Sherlock’s left thigh and leaving a vivid red hand print in its place.
“‘Moron!’” Sebastian said loudly and from the hallway he heard;
Sherlock smiled to himself. Another battle won. Well, technically, they hadn’t argued about it. Sherlock had just texted Mycroft telling him what he was doing and Mycroft had given in without a fight. Sherlock had to admit to himself that he was a bit disappointed by that. He’d been looking forward to the distraction. That Mycroft had capitulated immediately left Sherlock feeling vaguely unsatisfied. ‘Which was probably Mycroft’s goal, damn him!’
“That’s Sherlock. Only focused on what he’s interested in and that murderer was all he was thinking about. I apologize on his behalf. I’ll send him round to apologize properly, if you’ll give me your address.”
“Oh, yes. You wait for me. I’ll be right back…goodnight Jim.”
“I don’t mean it to sound as if I’m over worked. I just enjoy the sense of accomplishment. I feel deeply satisfied in a job well done. That sounds thoughtless and uncaring about the dead but I actually meant it more along the lines of wrapping things up for their loved ones and closing the file. Ok. That sounded a bit cold too. I should probably stop talking right now before I say anything more insensitive,” John said with a laugh.
“Wider than that, sweetheart.” John said, making the last word sound less like an endearment and more of an order.
“Well,” Sebastian started, removing the stethoscope he’d been using to try to find John’s heartbeat. He’d found it but it was thready; barely there.
“This is one experiment that I’d be more than happy to assist in as many times as you deem necessary. Almost forgot. How were you able to come untouched? That’s the unknown variable for me here.”
“Sorry. What?”
3:30am St Bart’s, Coroner’s Lab
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in the mirror but did as he was told.
John wasn’t worried. He was a lite sleeper and would wake at the creak of a board much less someone trying to get a speculum into him.
“And when I do, I don’t care where we are, or what we’re doing, I’m going to teach you a lesson about keeping secrets from your lover.”
“Cold?” She asked.
“This probably isn’t the best place to stand, John. There’s water from the falls all over the walkway. I don’t think that it was meant for guests to use. It’s just for looks.”
Sherlock had been insulted and had flounced off to his bedroom in a huff, slamming the door so hard that a picture had fallen off of the wall, glass shattering on impact. He didn’t even open his door to see what had happened and he certainly didn’t clean it up. John took care of it, as he did with all of the things that Sherlock felt was beneath him which was pretty much everything.
“Tell me about John, now or you won’t leave this room alive,” Sherlock threatened.
“Why? This is going to be good. A test of wills and all that. My money’s on Watson. Hey! Ow! That’s going to leave a mark!” Mycroft said, rubbing his bicep.
“Really. I can escape anytime I’d like.”
Briefly coming up for air John panted breathlessly,“Lube? Condoms?”
Moran set about adding an IV bag to the Port in John’s chest. Hanging the bag on the nearby pole, he patted John’s shoulder saying;
“All the more reason to do it. Besides, they can’t see us all that clearly. And no one’s looked up in the past 15 minutes. I’m not going to tell you again; pull your trousers down.” John punctuated that with a firm thrust against Sherlock’s backside.
“Did you know this bloke before? Gone out with him before? No one becomes this attached to someone they’ve never even met before,” John asked, surprised to find that he was jealous.
“Don’t you feel it? That we should be together?” Sherlock said softly.
“But he’s fine otherwise?” Mrs Watson pleaded?
“Oh. Right. Darn.”
“Da. John’s pregnant and mum wants him to keep it so you can see that he won’t be leaving home anytime soon.”
“It seems that Jim got a little high and passed out. Between getting high on John’s blood and the narcotics, he was just on the floor when S…his assistant got there. So…long story short, Jim needs to sleep it off and his assistant doesn’t want you doing any running around causing mischief while Jim’s unaware. This is just enough of our cocktail to keep you asleep until Jim wakes up and recovers from being groggy. There. That’s everything,” Becca said with a smile.
“How? I have teams everywhere. You’ve been there everyday as well and I know that you’re the last person who someone could slipped by without your notice.” Sherlock could hear Mycroft’s chair being pushed back as he stood up.
