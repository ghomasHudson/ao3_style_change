Sighing in relief, Dean was sure that C’s family either hadn’t seen his love declaration or simply hadn’t told them. Of course, there was also the option that C was ignoring it – but that sounded so unlike his soulmate that Dean didn’t consider that option any further.
A car honking at him got Dean out of his stupor at last and he quickly made his way inside. Gracie and Cas seemed to both be working on their own stuff, completely immersed and in what appeared to be a perfectly quiet, harmonious atmosphere.
The next moment, he wanted to flinch away as she leaned in even further and he could feel her hot breath against his ear. But he kept himself in check.
Even when he finally sat down in the seat of his Baby and Gracie had shut the door on the passenger side, closing them into a bubble of peaceful quietness.
“I …” she mumbled, before letting out a laugh, leaving Dean completely confused. Especially when she lightly smacked his arm with the back of her hand. “I was just kidding. Of course I know you won’t favor your daughter in this contest.”
“Stop stealing from your kid,” he grumbled in typical Luke-fashion. “She earned that piece. Have some manners, man.”
He didn’t have it in his heart to throw away the letter once he’d realized he would probably never be able to hand it to Cas. Michael could have sent it after him, so Cas would still have it for all his applications, but quite honestly Dean’s fear had been too high that Cas would simply rip the letter apart and throw it away.
There was a figure sitting on their porch swing as they got back and Dean couldn’t help but notice Gracie’s hopeful glance – only to see her shoulders slump the moment they came close enough to recognize the person in full.
The cobwebs of his sleepy brain still clung to him, trying hard to pull him back under – but the remnants of the dream he had just woken up from were also calling to him. The details were hazy at the moment and Dean didn’t try to chase them, knowing he would only lose the dream the harder he tried grasping for it. The only way for him to prevent his dreams from slipping through his fingers was to let the details come back in their own time.
And ‘here and now’ was family time and Dean needed a cold shower to help wash away the melancholy his negative thoughts brought on.
“Small towels are under the sink,” he told him instead, already yawning while vaguely pointing in the general direction of the bathroom door.
Whatever she wanted to reply was interrupted by a long yawn first. “But the Angel Cookies are so yummy, Daddy.”
“What do you want me to say?” he whispered, making sure his lip-movement was still clear enough for Eileen to read.
By the time students milled in for fourth period, it seemed that the conversation and all the info had spread around the corridors already, making for an undisturbed lesson.
His brother sighed before he started anew and somehow Dean had the feeling that he didn’t say what he’d wanted to say before.
He seemed to be successful, as his Pumpkin didn’t wait long before she hugged his side, not letting go while they made their way back to the parking lot.
Dean scoffed at that, getting up. Not to run away but because he could feel the anger begin to bubble up inside of him again. He paced a few steps before leaning against the handrail opposite the swing, facing Michael. He crossed his arms in a defensive manner and glared at his friend.
Happy Christmas, Merry Christmas, Happy (belated) Hanukkah, Happy Yule, Happy Holidays to all of you, my faithful readers, the new ones and the old. I come bearing gifts 🎅🎁
“I don’t know what you mean,” Cas replied cheekily, trying and failing to hide his grin. “I told her a lot of things today; you might need to be a bit more specific.”
Gritting his teeth, resolute not to let these two dampen his good mood, Dean gave himself a second and then relaxed. When he looked down at his daughter, he found her gaze already on him, a mix of annoyance and prompting in her stare. Raising an eyebrow in question, she gave him her sweet, angelic smile that Dean had learned long ago not to trust. He breathed out a laugh and then thought, ‘why the hell not,’ turning to the two biggest gossips in all of Stars Hollow.
pierced his heart. Clenching his teeth, Dean finally turned back around and let Cherry gallop again.
Obviously, the gravity of his actions went right over Cas’ head and the man seemed to be even more aggravated as he spat back, “Who the hell cares? Certainly not you!”
Cas’ whisper so soft it was almost lost in the breeze around them. But Dean stood close enough to catch it and in lieu of a reply, he simply leaned in, slowly, carefully. Trying to draw it out, the moment of anticipation before their first kiss.
The others at the garage as well as his friends and family quickly learned to steer clear of him and after a few tries, they even stopped asking him questions. Dean was grateful for that small mercy.
Michael put some more dishes down, right next to the ones Dean had carried, looking at him intently, the earlier carefree demeanor gone.
Still, the real reason why you get so many more words for Dean's POV - in my opinion - is this: three more years of writing experience on my part. If I was to write Angel Cookies today, it would be much longer as well, with more details and more finesse. Who knows how these two stories would look another three years from now...
Pointing to the second piece, which had fallen into her lap, he once again watched as she lifted the lid of the little box.
From the minimal light that filtered into the room, he could tell it was still early. He knew he hadn’t slept long, seemingly less than his usual need for four hours… and still, he somehow felt better than he had in a while.
“You gotta be kidding me,” Dean mumbled when he woke up for the umpteenth time that night. It wasn’t even four-thirty in the morning and he was ready to give up on sleep again. How could it be that he was dreaming about Cas three nights in a row just because the man happened to be back in his life?
. He wanted all those questions and wishes and ideas and confusing feelings - he wanted all of that to just
on Saturday. But surely, they couldn’t mean that? No, the way they all acted still had him believing it had to do with
“Then why?” Dean demanded right back. Because if Cas wasn’t mad, then Dean sure as hell needed to know what he really felt. “Why did you run away? And why are you behaving like this now?”
He picked up a phone and dialed a short number, most likely just an inter-house code, and then he waited. Dean tried not to fidget, biting the inside of his lip in the hopes it wasn’t too obvious. Hefting the strap of his duffle bag higher on his shoulder, he took a calming breath.
“I know, Gracie. I know.” Pulling his pouting daughter close to him, he hugged her to his side. “I’m sorry. We’ll do it next year, okay?”
let them operate without asking for any booth rental. Guess that meant Dean should be an adult and be nice to him, if only this once. The man even bought three packs of cookies, adding to the ever growing pile of money in the kids’ cash box.
Clearing his throat, Dean forced away that particular painful memory. Luckily, the rest of the town had had his back, declaring such a thing impossible. But the feeling of being under observation had haunted Dean for the better part of his first years as a teacher.
As it had happened so often over the past few months, the small but nagging question of ‘what if he’s your soulmate?’ came back to him and Dean tried to ignore it. He would’ve felt it if that was the case, right? Not that Dean could really trust his instincts anyway, as Cassie had proven spectacularly.
He was sure his emotions were written clear as day on his face, but he couldn’t help the small glare as he looked at her.
It's quite obvious that LC will turn out much longer than AC. I've been asked if it might be because it's easier for me to write Dean's POV and my immediate thought was: nope, I'm usually much better with writing Cas. BUT! Then I really thought about it and I have to admit that, yes, with this Dean, this particular version of him, it really is easy as pie for me to get into his head - because he has been with me for a long time. I wrote AC within a few weeks, but LC has been with me for over three years now. So yes, I guess, when it comes to these two versions of Dean and Cas, Dean is easier for me to write.
“It doesn’t matter, because I am not going to pull him away from his life in New York. As far as I know, he has a boyfriend now, so no need to ever talk about this.”
Maybe they could find a quiet moment tomorrow. Maybe… maybe if the whole cookie incident had calmed down again, they could take the time to really talk about it. Then Dean would feel out the situation and…
While he enjoyed his warm drink and listened to his daughter babbling happily about their snowman, he let his eyes wander. Cas was in deep conversation with Eileen, the two seeming to have bonded. After Eileen’s earlier comment, Dean actually wondered what they were talking about now, yet the thought of Cas getting along with his family still made Dean happy. He couldn’t stop thinking how well he would probably get along with Charlie and Jo as well.
Just so you know, so far, most of your ideas absolutely fit into my idea of this verse and I'm having a hard time deciding which to pick first. But at the end of LC, I will have a list ready for you to let you know what will definitely still happen in this verse - even if not all of it will be written in 2020. I really hope you will stick with me and this verse for "a little bit" longer 💙💚
“Good morning, Cas,” he greeted in the direction of the red light, once again only seeing a shadowy figure next to his horse.
“Alright, it’s on,” he challenged, delighted to see a spark in Cas’ eyes. “From tomorrow on, you may hit me with all you got. I’ll be open-minded and promise to give you my honest opinion.” And that was no small promise, coming from Dean Winchester. “But I’ll bet you won’t be able to hand me a better author than Vonnegut.”
Cas used to be his friend as well before … well, before it had all turned weird somehow and then even weirder and –
A little red light bobbing up and down in the darkness, as if it was in motion, gave Dean plenty of warning that someone was coming his way. Knowing that they were close to the slope, he tamed Cherry’s gallop to a trot and then a walk.
“Okay,” they both replied quietly, before smiling a bit again, leaving Dean’s side. Once they were gone, he sighed. They weren’t intoxicated, he was sure of that. Otherwise he would have gone after them and made sure they got home safe. “Dean?”
When Cas sat back up, Dean was prepared to simply enjoy the view, letting his lover do as he pleased and guide him along – but that moment was gone when he saw Cas fumbling for leverage and not finding any because his left hand was still useless in its cast. He was trying to brace himself on Dean’s chest, only to grunt out in frustration, the “Fuck,” on his lips sounding more annoyed than from arousal. Cas leaned back after that, trying a different position, but Dean could tell right away that it wasn’t the same, not without being able to hold himself like he wanted to.
When Cas’ eyes finally met his, there was so much pain in them. So much heartbreak, Dean’s throat grew thick at the very sight. They spoke of defeat as well - as if Cas had simply given in.
She left the room before Dean could ask anything else. Instead of pondering over it or going straight after her, Dean sighed and jumped into action.
Gracie stared at the pen for a moment longer, then the journal, then the pen again… until finally, she sank back into Dean’s arms. Not in a boisterous, loud way, but in a tender, heartfelt moment.
Not that that was of any help, of course. It only gave him more time to brood about all the horror scenarios imaginable. It was driving him crazy so he tried to focus on what little he
Usually, Dean would have a reply ready for Taylor, teasing the man in some ways. The guy always made a mountain out of a molehill and most of the times it was amusing to see him get confused when Dean threw him with a funny and completely unrelated remark. Right now, however, he was glad the man was saving him from having to reply to his daughter, so he simply nodded, showing Taylor that he should continue.
Not to speak of how hurt he would be about being the talk of the town again should this get out. Just the other day, he had told him about how embarrassed he had been all these years ago. Had tried to leave once already because of the
To his great satisfaction, almost all students had been on time, making Dean proud at how organized his kids were. Only Max came running five minutes after their sale had opened, two more boxes of cookies in his hand.
“The wrapped one first,” he finally said, pulling his hand away and himself out of his thoughts, which were racing a mile a minute, not helpful at all to calm down those damn butterflies. “The thing in the card is... the real present, so...”
Quite honestly, he was hardly able to follow the conversation at all. Cas asked something about the letter Luke had delivered to them and yeah, that tickled something in Dean’s memories from Christmas. But really, the smell of Cas was simply too intoxicating, his warmth too inviting, the stretch of bare skin right in front of him too alluring. So Dean wound his arms around the man, pulling Cas’ backside against his own chest. He could hear the hitch in Cas’ breathing and he was sure he was distracting him – which, probably, wasn’t nice. But he seemed unable to stop himself. Leaning in he began to kiss along Cas’ neck and up to the ear that wasn’t occupied by the phone. The soft hitch became more noticeable and Dean could tell that Cas was fighting hard to keep his breathing even as to not give himself away. He was probably also fighting a moan if the way he pressed his lips together was any indication. Dean himself had to suppress his chuckle – but he at least could easily distract himself by nuzzling along the shell of Cas’ ear and into his soft hair, leaving warm trails of kisses.
With a last smile in her direction, Dean turned around and quickly moved the few yards across the street and towards the
Getting up, he finally shoved the yearbook back to where it belonged, letting the envelope rest next to it. In the hopes that he would one day be able to look at all this and not ache for a future he would never have.
to let me know what else you would like to see in the Angel Cookies verse. I already got so many nice prompts and I can't wait to work on them 😍
imagine Cas’ face falling. Even more color drained from his cheeks and he looked completely ashen. Something was seriously wrong and his suspicion was only confirmed when Cas put the half-eaten cookie down on the table and pressed out some hasty, mumbled words between clenched teeth.
“Jesus, Sam,” Dean replied, rubbing a hand over his face. Even though he had known what was about to come - had
It took him a moment but finally, Cas opened his eyes and looked up at him. There were tears of pain in the blue and he looked like he wasn’t breathing normally.
He needed to hit something, he needed to let it out before it ripped him in half. Before the pain of his broken heart would kill him. He just wanted to take a sledgehammer and hit something.
Grinning, he reached for one of the items. “Alright, looks like we’ll be busy with these for a while,” he commented cheekily, holding up the very long and very thick vibrator, already trying to imagine how they might use it. The heat that this thought sent to his dick was undeniable. “Good thing I booked a one-way ticket to New York.”
“– and seeing their loved ones and my grandchildren... I know I’m truly a blessed man,” Chuck continued and for a wild moment, a bit of sadness hit Dean that he hadn’t ever expected to feel.
“But soon, her touches seemed to be more intense whenever they happened. And I started dreaming about her. The dreams quickly got … more steamy, so to speak. I needed some time to realize that it wasn’t me being confused. It was me finally seeing more clearly than ever. I
Thank God for whatever Gracie had said to him, as it seemed she’d been able to make him promise to stay.
They both broke off right away and a heartbeat later, Cas’ head whipped up and Dean was caught by mesmerizing blue eyes, unable to move even an inch.
“Look, guys,” Dean interrupted his brother, putting the bottle on the table as he sat forward. If they wanted to do this, he needed them to speak clearly with him, everything else would drive him crazy. “I’m in a really good mood right now and I might already have a slight buzz going on. We all know what you really wanna ask, so… just go ahead, ask. Stop skirting around the topic.”
He was shutting him up in the only way he had left and when Cas kissed him back within a heartbeat, eagerly pulling him in closer, Dean lost all sense of reality, all presence of mind. There was only one beacon, one thing to hold on to that rooted him to this world.
He took his time instead of rushing through his nightly routine as he usually did if only to give Grace some more minutes to read. Washing his face with cold water, Dean finally looked at himself in the mirror, tracing the droplets with his gaze before staring into his own eyes.
Gracie’s high-pitched scream finally pulled Dean out of his musings and more than that, it silenced the room. Everyone watching on as Gracie threw herself into Cas’ arms, tackling the poor man to the ground while screaming into his ear. “Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthankyou! Oh my God, this is the best present ever. Oh my God, thank you!”
Cas looked somewhat surprised at her words but a genuine smile quickly spread across his lips. He looked pleased at Gracie’s invitation and to Dean’s relief, he agreed.
His words had the desired effect, enticing a sweet little chuckle from Cas and a cute blush. “You’re not
Smiling softly, he brushed against her cheek again, the tears slowly coming to an end. “Sorry. What I meant is that you were already on the way, okay?”
Cas had hated him since the day of the wedding. For not going after him. For breaking his heart. For ruining a family legend for him.
“Yaaay!” Gracie exclaimed, squeezing his side again before she rushed towards the sleigh, grabbing Cas’ hand along the way and pulling him after her. Not giving them any time to exchange much more than an amused gaze.
Dean read the new words at a red light but didn’t have time to answer before the light turned green. The words disappeared and he could already feel the next ones appearing while concentrating on getting to campus safely. It wasn’t until the next red light that he looked at his arm again.
All these sensations – already divine on their own – mixed and mingled, merged and combined, crashing over him like waves. Sweeping him away like a forceful storm.
Taking the sheets from her, he held her gaze for a moment longer, then finally looked down at the notes in his hands.
about this situation for them. “Grace and I loved the cookies your Aunt baked last weekend, so I may or may not have bribed Michael to hand out the secret recipe.”
Now fully awake, Gracie was skipping down the hallway, probably already excited about her time with Sam at the fair. Sending a sweet smile after his daughter, Dean turned back to the laptop, ready to say his own goodbyes.
“Grace, pumpkin,” Dean interrupted, waiting for his daughter to look up at him. “You know I don’t need to read your letters, right? If you’re not comfortable with–”
“I’m sorry,” Cas replied, misunderstanding Dean’s turmoil of emotions, if his next words were any indication. “Please tell Gracie that the cookies taste wonderful. I’m just not feeling well.”
Another kiss, then Dean got up and made his way to the door. Just as he was about to switch off the light, Gracie called out for him once more.
? I don’t know, Cas. I’m old, you tell me what label we use as long as it shows that you’re mine and I am yours.”
There was silence on both sides, Dean not daring to look up and into the camera. He still caught some movement and figured the girls were looking at each other, probably wondering if Dean had gone crazy.
Dean had to swallow hard. C’s thoughts were scarily close to his own, proving once again just how much they thought alike, how compatible they were as soulmates. Though he was sure that many people thought exactly like that right now.
There was a lightness around Dean’s heart he hadn’t felt in a long time and he had to fight against the urge to sink into another kiss. Knowing they would miss the event if really he gave in to that desire again.
did something wrong to have Cas run away from her; and I cannot tell her that it is all on him because, despite everything, I don’t want her to think bad of him!”
on a loop while he still couldn’t take his eyes away from Cas. When he looked back at him halfway down the stairs, even the confusion in his head calmed down, every fiber of his being just focused on this one man.
As he stepped away from the car, he watched as Michael set Gracie back down, hugged her close once more, and then said something to her. She nodded in reply, squeezed him tight again, and then went inside without a backward glance.
The smell of fresh snow was lying heavy in the air, mixed with the fragrances of the ranch. Dean had always thought of it as a soothing combination. The feeling of home that was associated with this place was only intensified with the clean and earthy scent the newest layer of snow had left. Breathing in this air – especially at night – was usually able to calm him down.
The dark blush on Sam’s face was golden and certainly something Dean filed away to tease him about for a long, long time. As for right now, he simply joined in the loud laughter of their family, enjoying his brother’s embarrassment which Sam tried – and failed – to hide.
“I know, Dad. I swear, Castiel, I’m usually better with keeping secrets. It won’t happen again, I promise.”
Dean had to squeeze his eyes shut to fight against the pain welling up in him. How much he wished he could answer such a simple question. Technically, he
When he looked up, he was the first to notice Dean standing there, watching them. His smile, while still soft, turned a tad wider, leading Gracie to take note and turn around.
“I guess, I’ll leave you to it then,” he pressed out, stamping his foot on that thought right away. He’d already gone too far and if he wasn’t careful, there was no coming back. “To wrap this up or whatever.”
He didn’t, because he didn’t want Dean to be close. He didn’t want anything to do with him. Maybe Dean had thought about the wrong reasons for that but in the end, the reason didn’t matter. All that mattered were the facts. If it was due to hate or embarrassment, it did not matter, the bottom line stayed the same: Cas would never want him around and that was that.
“Urrggh, not you too,” Cas exclaimed, looking positively annoyed - a fact that made Dean grin. “I’m telling you, there are a million people out there with the name
He was sure Gracie knew as well, seeing how she had already made sure to bring the box with Cas’ draft as well as a lamp, so she could read a bit more before falling asleep.
and let me know what else you would like to see in the Angel Cookies verse 😍 I already got so many great wishes and I can't wait to work on some of them 💕
Under normal circumstances, Dean would have given in to his pleas. He was no man to keep someone against his will. Not normally. But he
Dean couldn’t stop himself from looking at the man. The soft smile Cas was sending after his daughter was a good look on him. The sharp angles of his face appeared to be softer, his eyes warmer.
Dean couldn’t help the smile that spread over his lips. “Of course I do. Hadn’t had a good laugh like that in a while. Why?”
“Definitely something we need to work on, yes,” Dean agreed without hesitation, quickly finding himself back at the receiving end of that intense gaze. “Although I feel like we’ve made a pretty good start; last night as well as this morning.”
He tried not to be hurt by the comment of her not wanting this to get back to him. He hadn’t ever known his daughter to keep any secrets from him – nothing important, at least; nothing she would go to such lengths to keep from him; writing to who knew, just so Dean wouldn’t find out – and he would be lying if he said it didn’t bruise him at least a little bit.
Damnit, Cas wasn’t supposed to distract him to the degree that he was an asshole to his students and not listening to his daughter anymore.
Trying to stay calm, Dean turned back towards Cas, holding out his hand so Cas could hand his coat for Dean to hang up. All the while, he tried to find the right words. In the end though, all he could say was the truth.
Smiling softly at her, Dean nodded. “Of course. I love you crazy ladies way too much to stay mad at you.”
And he knew Ava and Lily were his best students in class, never disappointing him at all. But they were also sixteen-year-old girls that probably had to deal with first crushes and heartbreaks, the constant need to talk to their best friend never fading.
For a moment, a dark voice inside his head urged him to tell them the whole truth. To tell them that he had figured out that his feelings for Cas had always been there; that he suspected they might even be more than the ones he had held - still held - for their daughter.
“Oh, sweet Jesus.” Cas’ voice was sleep-roughened, his words more of a groan than anything else. “Please tell me I’m not dreaming again.”
Ignoring everyone lingering in the hallway, ignoring their questions and confused gazes, ignoring the outstretched hands from his closest friends, Dean moved as fast as he could without actually tackling his way out of there.
Loud laughter rang out all around the room and Dean joined in – even though the phrase of ‘uncle’ certainly didn’t sit well with him, but hell would freeze over before he let Cas’ family know that before he even had a chance to talk to the man himself. The laughter only grew louder when Michael grumbled something Dean was unable to catch but seeing as his friend had crossed his arms and played at being annoyed about Gabe’s comment, Dean had a pretty good guess at what it was he had said.
to hear it from Dean. Not guess it, not hear it from someone else (whoever that should be), not find out by some clumsy attempt from Dean to kiss him, like what had almost happened in the alley…
At one point, Dean even drew one on his bare ass cheek, to which he got a winking smiley back that had him grinning like a madman.
“I totally get why your parents would call it that,” he finally told him. “I love the whole storyline with those rose petals.”
This time, it was Jo’s turn to roll her eyes while she slightly pushed against Charlie to get more space in front of the camera. “How’s everything back home?”
going to be a problem. A problem of the most divine kind. And by the cocked eyebrow and the soft smile that bordered on a smirk, Dean could tell that Cas knew it as well.
“We know,” Alice agreed, patting his hand. “And now enough of that. We haven’t heard anything new about your students yet! Are your seniors
– that her father would find someone again. How she wanted him to be happy again. How she wanted to see someone in his life again.
Thank God he’d been able to say that in a normal voice when his insides were in turmoil. Unable to prolong this any longer, Dean got up, cursing his own body for feeling the loss of Cas’ warmth like a physical pain.
“What?” Dean bit out. Yes, he had certainly reached his breaking point, still sick with worry for Cas and fed up with his constant inappropriate thoughts. “What would you do?”
There was a light feeling in Dean’s chest when he woke this morning and instead of getting up and starting his routine right away, he gave himself a moment to just lay in bed and enjoy all these new feelings inside of him.
The stationary was so important to her because while other girls might keep a diary, Gracie wrote letters to her mom. Some of them were even buried beneath the flowers on her grave, new letters following every time they went there to plant new flowers. But those were only some of them – the others she kept in a box under her bed.
Even though he would not admit it – didn’t want to admit to the small hope growing inside of him – Dean could
stairs there and people just sit on them despite it being freezing cold outside and have a picnic and make music or just talk and it’s this general amazing atmosphere and one of the locals told us it’s totally
A tingling in his neck, as if eyes were boring into him, followed him the whole way across the square.
“On Christmas Eve, if you eat Angel Cookies right before bed, you will dream of your one true love, and they will be your destiny.”
Not that there really was a second chance given to him – yes, Cas was here, and yes, Dean had finally opened his eyes, but that was all.
To be honest, Dean had no idea about what Cas would want. All he knew was that he didn’t want to burden him with Dean finally,
Reaching for his flashlight, Dean gave her a last pat before starting the icy descent. He had to tread carefully, reminding himself time and time again that it wouldn’t help Cas at all if he broke his neck.
? What? Wait, Gracie knows?” How the hell did his daughter know about this? And more importantly, how the hell had his daughter kept it from him?
Dean relaxed into the sidelines to watch the mayhem unfold. His time to hand out his own presents would come soon enough. Therefore, he simply enjoyed seeing the kids – Gracie included – get excited about their new toys and books and clothes. Only once their noises had calmed considerably did Dean begin to make his rounds. A nice personal present here, a wisely chosen gift card there – Dean wasn’t the greatest gift-giver around but at least he had put some thought into each and every one. He knew how much Hannah loved to decorate her home – but only to her own taste, so instead of buying her some random stuff, a gift certificate for the local crafting store was what she got. And with a baby on the way, Rebecca would be in need of so many baby clothes, a gift card for
There was no immediate reply, but Dean was confident that C would read the words within the next twenty-four hours, so they wouldn’t vanish unread.
Those daydreams about a faceless man aside, he still didn’t care if D was a man or a woman or anything else – which was the pan side of him, of course – all he wanted was to finally meet them.
Instead, he focused on the snowmen. If Grace and Cas were going to win, Dean wanted to have a clean conscious. He wanted to be able to honestly say theirs had been better than all the other ones.
“Oh, Jesus, fuck. Dean,” Cas babbled, his head shortly falling back onto the pillow before his eyes were back on Dean. “Oh my God. Oh.”
Cas moved a bit, probably to get a better look at him and the confused frown on his face and this cute head tilt he always did, told Dean that he wasn’t quite following him. Huffing out a little laugh – because yeah, that explanation had been weird – Dean moved so he was able to sit down next to Cas. As he pulled him into his embrace he was mindful of the cast, which Cas rested gently on Dean’s chest, away from the water. Absentmindedly, he let his hand move up and down Cas’ back as he tried to sort his thoughts so he could explain this in a way that would make sense.
“Yeah,” came the reply right away. “Sorry, I forgot to bring a light. Didn’t think someone would be up this early.”
“Right,” Dean relented, letting the topic of love confessions slide. “Who was it that used to call you Clarence?”
But really, all his brain function was concentrated right now on forcing his hands to open. To release Cas.
“Yeah, you can’t compare that. Everybody knows you loved her and were faithful to her. You would have never done anything to break her heart.”
Taking a sip of his water first, Dean reached for the papers he’d put aside, looking at the one on top. It was a letter of recommendation he’d written shortly before Christmas, planning on handing it to Cas at the beginning of the new year. Reading the words he’d written so long ago, Dean had to smile. Cas had always been an outstanding student when it came to literature and writing. It had taken Dean hours to put into words how amazing the boy was without it sounding like he was gushing over him or just glorifying something.
“Dean,” Cas gasped, when he was able to catch some of his breath, “how dare you not respect the classics.”
The happy grin that spread over Cas’ face was worth the embarrassment and the heat Dean could feel creeping up his neck and his cheeks. He let himself be drawn into a loose hug, Cas’ arms resting around his middle. Cas was swaying them, just slightly, as he pressed a kiss to Dean’s nose before finally replying. “Now that sounds promising.”
All of a sudden, Dean became incredibly aware of just how close he was standing to Cas - had he been leaning in towards him? Had he
Getting up and making his way to the kitchen to start a pot of black tea, Dean pondered that question. While he let the tea steep, he went back to the bathroom and quickly got ready. His shower could wait, he would need it later to warm up anyway. By the time he poured two cups of tea, one black for himself, one with three cubes of rock sugar, Dean had decided on a plausible answer: They had parted in such a terrible way, and Dean knew Cas must have hated him for that. He probably still did, although Dean couldn’t know for sure. Asking Michael about it somehow didn’t feel right, so Dean had no other option but to wait and see.
Throwing a sideways glance at Sam, they both barely hid their snickers. Everybody knew how much Taylor annoyed Luke Danes with everything he did. It was always fun to see how long it took before Luke exploded. And just like always, Taylor ignored the man and all the rest of them and went right on. Groaning for real, Dean settled back in his chair, trying not to fall asleep until Gracie would enter the stage. That was until he saw the little red light on Sam’s fancy camera blink.
Which made it all the more surprising for him to hear that C was now ditching classes – to go shopping, of all things!
“Oh, seriously, Cassie?” Gabe’s voice was like a bucket of ice-water, instantly pulling Dean out of his trance. “Are you nerding out over the movie?”
“Friends?” Charlie threw in, obviously confused. “Didn’t you tell me it was one of his students that –”
God, everybody knew she was him in miniature, in almost every aspect. So if Dean - at almost forty years old - still mourned the loss of his mother, then so would Gracie with her own.
Yes, his own feelings were hurt, and yes, maybe he was still mad at Cas in some ways – but it didn’t change the fact that after all this time, after all these years… Cas at least deserved to
And all this time, he had only his thoughts to keep him company. They kept jumping around, playing out one possible scenario after another. What if Cas didn’t even want to see him? What if he wasn’t there, or worse, he was home with
Next chapter will be up tomorrow... in which we will finally find out how Dean's chase after Cas went down... and what Zar said to him 😎
“I started exploring. First with videos, then by looking at the women around me more closely.” There was a low growl and a smacking sound. Without checking, Dean could only guess that Charlie had shown what exactly she thought about Jo checking out other women and Jo must have stopped her. Without a hitch, she went on. “I didn’t need long to realize that other women didn’t interest me in the slightest. Like, not at all. They were nice and I could honestly admit when I thought they were beautiful – but there was never any sexual note behind it. Except for Charlie. She … she was my only exception and I knew I wanted to explore it. With her.”
“Yeah, absolutely. It’s– it’s so damn sexy and sinful and it makes me feel things whenever I hear it.”
“You don’t need to tell me that you want me to be happy, Dad. I know that. You show me. Every day, you show me. But I think it’s time you see that I can, and
Her voice was so small, so unsure, Dean could do nothing more but to put the papers aside and pull her into a deep hug, burying his nose into her hair.
for lack of a better word. If looks could kill, Lydia wouldn’t even see her death coming. Her smile to the other girl but especially the woman next to Dean was so fake, Dean had to bite back a grin.
Relishing this moment, even though it wasn’t meant for him, Dean let it last a few heartbeats longer.
His words still hung in the air and as he cleaned up the kitchen, they echoed in his heart. He knew that while it was true, while he was happy to have back Cas’ friendship – he also knew that he was lying to himself.
Jo gave him a hard glare. “You wanna play this game and tell us anyway in the end? Or do you want to skip the bullshit and come out right away.”
Sighing, he stole a gaze in Cas’ direction. He needed to know he told his daughter ‘yes’ for the right reasons – and not because he wanted alone-time with Cas. Since the conditions inside the barn were no different than they had been a few hours prior before Dean even knew Cas would be here, and since everything was perfectly fine with Shiv and Ruby… well…
Cas briefly looked over at him, moving his left hand to lay over Dean’s. “I, uhm… not really? But… given my departure…”
. He drew a sharp breath and focused on the delicious feeling. It was never the same when he did it to himself, never as intense, and this had been unexpected and –
“Don’t sweat it. Now go, help the others,” Dean told him, clapping him on the shoulder before he playfully shoved him over and in the direction of his classmates.
The dreams that had gotten somewhat steamy two nights ago. Not really, of course, but … had that been a start?
“Here,” his daughter said, holding out another cookie for Cas, as if it was a peace-offering. “Please, you have to tell me if it tastes just as good as your family’s.”
Friday night had been spent with a nice family dinner at Bobby’s place and since the snow had picked up again sometime between second helpings and pie for dessert, Sam and Eileen had decided to stay for the night. Gracie had fallen asleep during their impromptu movie night, so Dean had carried her to her room in Bobby’s house, no desire to carry her all the way back to their place in the middle of a freezing cold night.
Today's chapter doesn't go along with any chapter of AC - but I wanted to give you a bit more of Dean as a teacher and a dad - have fun!
As if he had the time for that, seeing how he had used up every last minute to spend it with Cas. But if Gracie really,
“I want the same, Cas,” Dean promised, leaning in for a lingering kiss before adding, “but I don’t want you to think you’re the one who has to give up everything in this.”
“Ah, that,” Dean replied, chuckling with slight embarrassment. “That was a stupid comment in the heat of the moment, Cas. Just to point out that we had all the time in the world.” Looking at the packed suitcase on the bed, he sighed. “Or at least, I’d thought so.”
“Yeah,” Cas interrupted him, his voice full of wonder. “Yeah, sure. I mean, I’m clean as well. I just thought... for you...”
Just like that, the conversation turned into a big one with everybody at the table involved and Dean thanked the Gods for Eileen’s quick thinking.
He wasn’t stupid. Of course, him refusing to answer was already answer enough and his students would know it. But he couldn’t bring himself to openly admit it to the kids.
Confess that he had finally figured out his feelings? Should he really do that? Should he just dump that on Cas? What if –
C had finished their education this year and had been busy recently with a few smaller jobs and various interviews for permanent ones. It left them tired and drained and with Dean’s own busy schedule of college and the garage, it wasn’t uncommon for them lately to only exchange a few words every day. And Dean hated that.
He knew one thing for sure, though. Cas would certainly go through with his threat. So it was probably best to just listen to him and take him to the mansion as quickly as possible. Someone there ought to be awake already. They would be able to drive him to the hospital.
“As you wish,” he replied right away, dropping the vibrator back where it came from and pulling out one of the lube bottles instead. He hesitated for a moment when he saw the strip of condoms… but then decided against it, closing the drawer instead. Right away, Cas stopped him, his eyes wide and full of questions, and damn it, Dean could feel a burst of heat blooming in his cheeks. Was he seriously blushing because of this? Still, he pushed on and explained, “I know I’m clean and if it’s okay with you –”
“What is it?” he finally asked, hardly able to keep his voice steady from worrying. Helpless not to brokenly add, “Don’t you want it?”
Once again, Dean tried to find more words, tried to find a way to say what he wanted - what he felt was needed.
As Cas sat up and his eyes met Dean’s, he simply shrugged, a cheeky grin on his lips. “Well, I trust her not to show you – or anyone.”
! You knew that, didn’t you? You knew and you still kept trying to be near me these past few weeks.”
Her grin turned wider and she quickly scrambled to where she had positioned the small pile of presents she was handing out herself, returning with a wrapped gift and sitting back down next to him.
Trying to ignore it all, Dean sat down in his Baby and took a few calming breaths. Pulling out a pen, he began scribbling on his arm.
“Ehm... now?” he asked carefully, trying to find a reason not to go. A reason to brush her off in the kindest way possible. “We... sorry, we’re having pie here and kinda in the middle of something, so...”
When his tongue swiped over Cas’ pert nipple, that stray thought was gone with the wind, carried away by Cas’ loud, downright sinful moan. And
Dean was at a complete loss for words. He hadn’t planned on acting on his feelings but telling his friend that felt just as weird as agreeing with him. So Dean opted out of either option and took another sip of his drink.
Well, that was a bit exaggerated, seeing how there hadn’t been any tickets to book in the first place. But the sentiment was true – they had all the damn time in the world to stay in bed and fuck each other senseless… or rather,
As Dean looked up, already chuckling, Gabe was rubbing his hands, looking gleefully around the display. Wiggling inquisitive fingers and making grabby hands, he picked up the first bag and looked at it.
“But instead, you sprang away the second you heard someone call out. Like you had burned yourself; like you wouldn’t dare be caught with–”
Snaking his own hand between them, Cas wrapped it around both of them as best he could, grinning at the muffled groan that came from Dean. Following the already set rhythm, Cas marveled at how well they already fit together.
“Oh no. It’s fine,” Cas replied right away and if Dean wasn’t mistaken, there was a very faint red shimmer on his cheeks. “I invited her.”
His mind - his feelings - it all was a mess at the moment. If he was honest, they had been ever since Cas had stepped back into his life. It was as if everything was upside down, his heart a mess, his mind one constant whirlwind, and it felt as though he hadn’t been able to catch his breath ever since.
But no. For the first time in his life, Dean knew how it felt. It wasn’t as if there was no air left for him to take in. It was simply that his chest had become tight, something squeezing him and not letting go until the connection between him and Cas had been broken. And even now, he still felt the uneasy squeezing in his stomach.
Dean was pulled out of his thoughts when he heard Gracie’s bedroom door open, his head snapping up in shock, checking the time. It was almost 11am. He’d been sitting on the couch so long his tea had gone cold without even realizing it. Yet he still hadn’t found a solution to all his troubling thoughts.
Not answering right away, Gracie crawled into his lap before continuing. “Do you think there’s any chance Cas will come back to Stars Hollow?”
Entering, Dean found Cas’ eyes on him right away, going wide with shock when he saw him. It must have gotten Gracie’s attention because she looked over her shoulder a second later.
When there was still no change with Ruby, Dean became restless again and wandered down the aisle between the bays, pretending to check on the other horses. The storm outside had picked up and for a long time, it was the only noise coming from outside. That was, until Dean thought he heard a car arrive. Looking back down the aisle at his family, no one seemed to have noticed but then again, he was a lot closer to the barn doors than they were. He had most likely imagined it but even though…
“As you should already know, we have lots of events planned for this month, all of which you can find in our brochure –”
“He was brave enough to tell you. And I think he deserves that same kind of braveness from you now.”
Just yesterday, the family had talked about how to handle their own gift-giving, since technically, they normally didn’t celebrate until tomorrow morning. In the end though, they had agreed to join the Shurleys and hand out at least their big gifts for each other as well. Sam had even begun to talk something about the fact that in Germany and some other parts of Europe, gifts were traditionally given on Christmas Eve and not Christmas morning – and yeah, Dean had rolled his eyes and agreed, if only to stop his brother from fully nerding out.
trying to convince me it’s all a misunderstanding. He made it clear that he thought it was a mistake.”
Just a few weeks after the picture had been taken and Cas had chosen his quote, he’d left. Left right after Dean’s wedding, right after he’d run there to stop it, right after Dean had hurt him by not even spending five minutes to go after him and talk to him.
“What?” Dean asked back, his brain not fully caught up just yet because, oh God, it really was Cas! Thank God, he was here. He was really here, he was okay, he was
“Hey, don’t sweat it,” Dean interrupted him. “It’s just five minutes. Give your boxes to Lily, she knows where to put them.”
Not that either of them cared, not anymore. Not now, that the only thing people could truthfully say about them was that they were happily and irrevocably in love with each other.
Cas began to shallowly rut against him, his moan so sinful it pulled Dean in further. Like a siren’s call. He kept kissing him, pressing his own very hard erection into his side, and swallowed every sweet noise coming from Cas and
“First step: Pizza?” he asked and Cas nodded, taking the offered towel and wound it around his hips. Dean did the same and together, they left the bathroom to get some food into their system. He had an inkling that they would need all the carbohydrates they could get.
As it was, he made sure to first and foremost take care of Gracie and calm her down, promising her that he would go after him. He even went back to his room to get fully dressed before taking her up to the main house. While she had crawled into her bed up there, Dean knocked on Sam’s door and let his brother know that something had happened and to watch Gracie. He didn’t answer any of his brother’s questions, simply told him to ask Grace as he was already rushing back downstairs.
But he wouldn’t go so far as to invent any excuse. None further than, “Something simply came up and he had to…” A fresh wave of pain took his breath away and he had to pause for a moment before he was able to finish that sentence. “He had to go back to his life in New York.”
- this one to go - and then headed for some hot drinks from the fair. Instead of coming back, they placed their goodies on a table and immediately immersed themselves in a long conversation. Dean himself had joined Michael and Naomi along with some old friends of Naomi’s. Only now and then did he steal unobtrusive glances at Cas and Gracie.
It wasn’t until Gracie called out for him again, that Dean got up. Pushing everything aside, he went to the kitchen to get his daughter fed and ready for the day.
And with that, the door fell shut and Dean was sure that with it, the last bit of air had been sucked from his lungs.
Dean was sure he had blatantly been staring at the man for countless minutes until finally, the meaning of his words sank in. He tried to push down any hope flaring in his chest - this was a step forward again, right? - but couldn’t help the smile slowly forming on his lips. Maybe Cas was taken and maybe this would never lead to what Dean was hoping for. But maybe, just maybe, it could lead to the second-best thing: Cas’ friendship.
The action was almost immediately accompanied with a whispered, yet furious, “Shut the hell up, you morons. Don’t you have
. Yes, Dean really did kind of want to talk about it. But… he also didn’t? Dean wasn’t sure anymore. Right now, it was easier not to talk, of that he was certain.
“Of course not, Pumpkin,” he promised, before switching back to Dad-mode. “But if you make a promise, you need to keep it, Gracie.”
to say something. Putting the boxes on the counter, not letting go of them completely, Dean made a decision.
Which was why he took out his phone and let some AC/DC blast around the room while he cleaned up. He always kept his room well in order, but with the upcoming holidays, it was a good time to give it a thorough cleaning.
Obviously, his soulmate had just woken from a coma. The handwriting looked like that of a kid who’d just learned to write. Nothing like the elegant handwriting Dean had grown accustomed to. The one-word-answers had been pretty telling as well and all Dean could imagine was his soulmate, sleepy and still mostly dazed, just awoken from a coma – and the first thing they did was to send a message to Dean.
“Of course not,” Dean replied, rolling his eyes and nudging her in her side. “I would love to talk to you again before I’m old and gray. And I know that won’t be happening if I do that. I’m not that stupid.”
It was too bad Emma was nowhere to be seen or Dean would have some other way of ignoring Lydia aside from being outright rude himself. He hated being rude but some people simply didn’t
The feeling of déjà vu was overwhelming and like last time, his hands acted out of instinct, reaching for Cas’ arms to steady him. The sudden closeness had butterflies in his stomach soaring, the familiar fragrance engulfing him.
“You’re kidding?” he asked, continuing once Cas shrugged his shoulders. “Hey, nothing against Harry Potter, but it’s a kids’ book.”
A faith that was so rudely ruptured when he saw a little light ahead of him churning wildly and begin to tumble dangerously towards the slope Dean knew started just there. The scream that followed just seconds later and the red light suddenly disappearing made his heart freeze, as if ice pierced it.
One more misunderstanding between them and Dean would probably go crazy. He was further reassured when Cas pressed another kiss to Dean’s lips but despite the fact that he apparently wanted this as well, he didn’t let Dean deepen the kiss. Instead, he leaned back again and said, “I’ve wanted this with you for so long. But Dean, you…”
“Oh... well,” Cas replied, looking mildly uncomfortable. And it suddenly occurred to Dean that - since the man had crushed on him majorly once - this was probably not a nice question for him to ask. “Not that I can say, no,” Cas finally explained, making Dean’s heart skip a beat. Quickly though, Cas steered away from that particular topic. “But this movie is the reason for one of my nicknames.”
Little fingers were digging into his side, making him grunt from trying not to succumb to laughter. His daughter was a dirty fighter, knowing exactly how ticklish her father was. It didn’t help her, however, when Dean unceremoniously dropped her onto her bed, her squeaking laughter loud as she bounced off her mattress.
He watched with bated breath as Cas pulled out the Christmas card, opened it, tucked the folded paper behind it, and then read the words Dean had written. Cas didn’t give anything away, his eyes moving over the lines, narrowing ever so slightly at what Dean guessed was his clue to what was behind the folded paper. Without speaking a word, Cas closed the card and unfolded the paper. Once again, his eyes flicked over the written lines, and this time, Dean watched them go wide before Cas looked back up at him, eyes sparkling in wonder and awe and curiosity.
Closing his eyes, he willed the memories of teary blue eyes to go away. He’d almost lost Cas a second time today and it was eating him up from the inside. Like a physical pain. A heavy knot inside of his stomach, getting bigger and bigger.
“Yeah, pumpkin,” Dean asked, exchanging a quick smile with Alice before giving his daughter his full attention.
All that mattered was that Cas never stopped kissing him, his arms snaking around Dean’s shoulders to draw them together even closer. It was indeed hot. Very hot.
Not even the possibility of Cas having found love and happiness somewhere else had been a red flag for Dean last night - a fact that made him ashamed in the light of the early morning. He was no homewrecker and if Cas was spoken for… well, then Dean would just have to live with this newfound revelation on his own.
Dean huffed to himself in disbelief. The fact that he hadn’t even considered the ‘consequences’... He let his easy smile take over again as the implication hit him all at once; still baffled sometimes at realizing again and again how he absolutely didn’t care about what people thought about him and his love life. Or his sexuality, for that matter.
Their kisses, as amazing as they had begun, soon faded into panting against each other’s lips. And yet, Dean was loath to lose the contact. Cas seemed as unwilling as him, but Dean could see him struggling and soon, Cas sat back up, moaning again in pleasure. Making Dean wish that he was the one pulling those sounds out of him.
Because that was another thing he had learned over time. C was definitely a very intelligent and intellectual person. The thought of that kept Dean awake sometimes, seeing how he himself had barely made his way through high school, and was now looking ahead to start working at his uncle Bobby’s garage full time once school was over. The garage and scrapyard just outside the city limits of Lincoln, Nebraska, wasn’t much, but it was like a second home to Dean and he loved it there more than in his own room sometimes.
“Dinner is over and this won’t take long,” Cas explained, phone already in hand as if he was eager to take the call. “I don’t want him to worry.”
None of that had prepared Dean though. He was currently standing in front of one of the most luxurious apartment buildings he had ever seen. One that most people usually only saw in movies. The type with a canopy over the entrance area and even a carpet running from the front door, two big pots with fancy-looking plants on the left and right of the door. And despite the weather – the snow still coming down and the soggy black slush that covered the grounds all around them – the entrance area was squeaky clean.
The smile spreading across Cas’ face was so sweet, Dean was powerless to not kiss him; the taste of those lips and the little sounds he made and all too soon, there was no holding back anymore. Moving them so he was lying on top of Cas, the kiss progressed from sweet to heated and filthy within a few short moments.
Realizing that his thoughts were spinning once more, Dean dried his face and finally left the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Immediately, he heard a book being closed and put away and then the rustle of blankets. Just as he turned around the open doorway, Grace closed her eyes and lay completely still.
“You’ll always find something against my choices, won’t you?” Cas asked back, more tease than accusation and certainly with a good dose of amusement.
Getting through his stuff at a rather great pace, it was about an hour later that Dean was able to put his pen down and enjoy the satisfying feeling of a job well done. For the moment there was nothing left to correct or prepare, so he finally allowed himself to call it a day without feeling like a crappy teacher again. After cleaning up his desk, Dean left his classroom and the school, making a beeline for the diner to pick up his daughter. He could already see her blonde mane from a few yards away, yet when he looked past her, he was completely caught off guard as he saw the man she was sitting at a table with. So caught off guard, actually, that he stopped in the middle of the street, just staring, wondering if he’d been picked up and dropped into the wrong movie.
He’d mostly kept his promise not to let his private issues interfere with teaching again, but even he could tell he wasn’t as easy-going and fun as he usually was. The sleepless nights, the weird dreams, not seeing Cas in the mornings ... It all came together and left him moody. His students could certainly tell something was wrong, and he should probably take it as a tribute to how well-loved he was that they didn’t take advantage of the situation.
“What?” he asked, looking down into his daughter’s questioning eyes. “Yeah. Yeah, sure,” he assured her right away, hoping he hadn’t missed a question. “Just a bit tired, sorry.”
“Wow, okay. Was not expecting this to be so easy. I thought we had to… I don’t know, punch it out of your dead body or something.”
“That night – in my dream – Lisa was there, telling me that it was alright. God, I know this sounds stupid and I know it wasn’t real, just a dream. Just wishful thinking and my subconscious mixing things together. But she – man, it sounds so stupid, saying it out loud,” he interrupted himself, not really sure how he should explain this without sounding like a lunatic.
“You like my voice?” Cas asked in wonder, sounding so surprised that Dean couldn’t suppress his laugh.
Even speaking over each other between their embarrassed laughs, they still weren’t able to find a quick enough excuse. Dean raised one eyebrow, hoping it was still somewhat effective even though his smile never left his face these days. It seemed to be the one detail the two women latched onto as well.
Gracie quickly rose the three mugs she was carrying. “Sorry,” she said, almost sounding like she actually regretted not having her hands free for a hug.
? Was he still hurt by it all? Did this still bring back all the bad memories? Was there a way – any way at all – to ever make this up to him?
The feeling was mutual, to be honest, and Dean simply shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t really care, as long as it isn’t just rabbit food. How about we just order another pizza from Papa John’s?”
When Dean woke up, he knew right away that he had overslept. It was this weird feeling of being asleep one second and awake the next without an alarm pulling him from sleep. To add to that feeling, the room was too light. Not bright or anything, it was still early in the morning – for a Sunday at least – but seeing how he was usually up long before dawn, the grey light in the bedroom told him right away. Jerking up, he saw the numbers of his alarm and once he realized what he saw, he rolled onto his back with a long groan. It was just after nine. He hadn’t slept this long in years. He also couldn’t remember switching off the alarm, so he must have been really out of it to do so without even noticing.
Cas only had a few seconds of a headstart and it didn’t take Dean long to find him at the outskirts of the fair, walking along the main road. It looked like one of the side roads was his destination and Dean rushed forward to catch him before he could reach his car.
eighteen. He had waited three years for this moment and now it was finally here. The best birthday present ever.
It was a silver fountain pen, engraved with vines and roses. On the side currently visible, it held a quote by Horace –
Was it normal to constantly want to be close to him? To be saddened when Cas didn’t show in the mornings? Or when he clearly made sure Grace would be ready by the time he showed up at
“I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it. Just that... well, it’s an amazing book, but there are actually some continuity and logical mistakes in there. And to be honest, since it’s a kids’ book, the language is not the highest quality.”
And by God, Dean wanted to go over there and simply kiss him. Kiss him for making his daughter so happy; kiss him for trusting her like this; kiss him for making it sound so
At some point, Dean had let go of Cas’ hand but he couldn’t keep himself from reaching for him again, grasping his arm instead, as Cas leaned against the wall. Cas looked as if he needed the wall to keep himself upright - something Dean understood very well, for he was sure he would collapse into a heap of hysterical laughter if it wasn’t for the grounding feeling of having Cas’ arm in his hand.
He only replied with a breathed-out moan, showing Dean that he was still alive. Dean’s soft chuckle was his answer before his man spoke again. “There’s something I wanted to tell you for so long now.”
She was lucky he was still young and strong. At least, enough to carry her a few more steps before he gave up, claiming she had probably eaten too many Christmas cookies already.
For a moment, he tried to think. Tried to recollect some of what he had seen during his ‘research’, memories of his fantasies. But they wouldn’t surface, his mind too hazy, too focused on the man above him and… and…
“So,” she finally said, her tone telling Dean right away that she wasn’t buying any of his shit. “Is this the only reason you’re in a bad mood?”
Ready to face the music once more, Dean returned straight to the living room, no desire at all to have Michael catch him again whilst on the hunt for Cas.
Because people deserved to know when they were loved. That’s what he had always told his students – what kind of role model would he be if he couldn’t even honor his own words?
“Heeey, little Gracie,” Chuck replied, letting the excited girl squeeze him while he hugged her back.
A man he tried hard not to fully fall in love with simply from exchanging written words on their skin.
“It’s okay. Hey, we’ve kept you guys way too long. You’re in Europe, you shouldn’t be bothering with our problems back home. Go, have fun.”
For the first time, he fully understood what Cas had meant when he told him that the smell alone reminded him of
“We know, Taylor,” Dean could hear Luke yell from somewhere, directly followed by a more excited Babette calling, “Yeah, get on with the program.”
Dean hadn’t even fully kicked his shoes aside by the time he was already scribbling on his arm, ignoring his mother’s call to not leave a mess in the hallway again as he beelined for his room.
“Did I have another choice?” Brushing his hand over his face, Dean sighed before sitting up as he continued talking. “At least she took it pretty well. She was more worried about Cas than anything else.”
“Alright,” Dean replied, pushing any troubling thoughts to the back of his mind. “Let’s get you upright and see if you can walk. The only other option would be for me to ride back home alone and call an ambulance.”
He knew the moment he closed his eyes and took a deep breath, hesitating for just a moment too long, that he didn’t need to answer anymore. His silence was confirmation enough.
And oh yes, good. Let’s move on and far away from the topic of a young teacher forcing himself to not think about one of his students…
Dean couldn’t find it in himself to care even a little bit about the water or its temperature. His gaze was solely on Cas and as the man leaned over the tub to reach the faucet, Dean had to bite his lip at the perfect picture presented to him. He tried to hold himself back for all of three seconds – until he realized he no longer had to. Stepping over, he grabbed Cas’ hips, holding them in place as he shamelessly pressed close, Cas’ groan filling the whole bathroom. It was music to Dean’s ears but before he could say anything, Cas moved his hip just so, rubbing his ass firmly against Dean’s hard cock. It coaxed a moan out of him, so filthy, so needy, he would be embarrassed if anyone but Cas were to hear it. Leaning over, he kissed Cas’ back, all the way up to his neck, drawing out more and more sounds from his man until it was time to get into the tub.
“Hey, yourself,” Cas whispered back, his eyes dancing across Dean’s face; finally very clearly landing on his lips. A heartbeat later, he leaned in again, their lips touching for another quick kiss.
Dean’s eyes went wide, not able yet to take them off Cas’ face. He was rewarded for his attention, able to witness the usually stoic face cracking up with laughter. The exact way Cas’ mouth moved when he began to chuckle and the way his body shook as he forced himself to  stifle the sound Dean wanted to hear so badly. The way his eyes crinkled, those faint lines Dean had noticed before deepening with Cas’ joy.
“Oh, you guys gotta be kidding me today,” he growled, making all of them jump. Ripping the little letter right out of Lily’s hand, he ignored the shocked gasps from the girls as well as the pleading, “No, Mr. Winchester, please.”
The only one really taking it serious tonight was Gracie, the countless stacks of chips spoke volumes. Some people might think it inappropriate for a young girl to already be gambling. Dean though was of the opinion that kids simply needed to be taught a healthy relationship with such things. Which was also why Gracie was allowed small sips of alcohol when Dean was around, like champagne on New Year’s or that sip of beer she wanted to try on her birthday. Sooner or later, she would grow up and maybe drink and gamble anyway. The least he could do was make sure she had a healthy understanding of it all, maybe prevent her from having any problems with them.
Yes, he was with a man for the first time; yes, this was new to him in so many ways. But no, it wasn’t one bit intimidating or confusing or any other negative thing one might worry about.
“You know Taylor’s OCD. Lulu’s a teacher, and since there always needs to be a teacher on the judge’s panel …”
“I’m not,” Cas replied after a moment. Even through all the layers, Dean could feel the muscles of his upper arm move, as if they were vibrating from all the tension. Like a bow-string, ready to shoot. Ready to run away from him again.
And Dean could definitely understand that fear. What he didn’t understand was what had happened. Not answering right away, he tried to think of his dream that night. He remembered waking up with a content feeling, not being able to grasp the dream fully at first, and then being distracted by Cas not being by his side. He knew Lisa had been there but the details were hazy. Now that he really tried, more fragments came back to him until finally, he was able to piece together the dream from that night. Relief washed over him – because yes, it would’ve been a bit weird to simply dream of his dead wife after he’d just spend a night with the love of his life – but it was quickly replaced by a weird mix of emotions. On the one hand, he was happy that this was a misunderstanding they could easily put aside. On the other hand, it had brought so much pain to Cas, to himself; to
“Good girl,” he whispered as he took the harness, caressing her neck. “Good girl, waiting here for me. You’re getting some extra treats for breakfast, promise.”
They stood in silence for a moment, Dean’s hand on his daughter’s shoulder. He still had no idea what to say, no idea how to console her. What should he say? What
Dean turned around and was met with the kind eyes of an elderly gentleman, his uniform clearly distinguishing him as the concierge of this house. He stood behind a built-in reception area, further giving off hotel-like vibes.
“I know, I know,” Charlie interrupted, stealing one of his fries while ignoring his glare. “You two promised to wait for each other. So romantic. You do realize though that not all soulmates are meant to be
“Of course, sweetie. Why don’t you take this,” she handed her a ten-dollar note, “and run ahead? I’ll be with you in a minute.”
Like the saint he was, he had called his children to order. Told them to stop harassing Dean. Shushed any of Dean’s mumbled apologies, telling him not to think for a second that any of this had ruined their Christmas.
Dean ignored his weird thoughts once again, focusing on what Cas had to say. “My best friend’s sister is deaf and the two of them lived with me for a while.”
Gracie sent him a quick smile but her eyes were right back on her gift as she leafed through the empty pages.
Shrugging her shoulder and sniffing, Gracie didn’t reply, apparently deep in thought. He hated this. Hated not being able to take away her pain.
going through while one of his classes was playing a game. Since he had been involved in all the activities, it had remained untouched and went back into his bag in the same condition. If he was really lucky, he would find some time over the next two weeks to take care of this, so it wouldn’t bother him once the new term began.
Gracie only nodded into his chest, which wasn’t all that convincing. Since he was sure she wasn’t cold, there was only one other guess Dean had.
“It will be alright,” she told him and pressed a kiss to his cheek before stepping back to the fence.
It was the little twist Cas made on an upstroke that sent Dean tumbling over the edge, trembling and moaning; tightening his embrace as fire shot through his veins and little stars exploded behind his closed eyelids.
“You gossiping harpies! I’ve told you: Stop judging Cas for what he did! He’s certainly been braver than you’ll ever be.”
Opening his eyes so he could look at Cas while they spoke of such serious matters, he shook his head. Absentmindedly, he let his fingers draw patterns on that beautiful skin, but he didn’t let it distract him, didn’t give in to the desire to taste all of Cas. Not yet.
“We’ll stay with her as long as you need us to. Go. Find an outlet… but please be careful, the streets aren’t looking any better yet.”
Yet, no moment could last forever, and all too soon the smooth warmth of Cas’ skin was gone, the loss of the contact once more like a physical pain. One not even a deep breath and the fluttering of his heart was able to chase away.
“Are you some kind of bestselling author or something?” he quipped with a lopsided grin. “This looks pretty first class to me.”
As he pressed a kiss to Cas’ jaw, he coaxed a moan out of the man that had Dean’s cock twitch in interest and,
There really wasn’t anything suspicious about the way she had said the name – not much, anyway. But it was just enough for Dean to get suspicious. Had Cas…?
To this day, Dean believed it was the reason Sam started wearing his hair long – a clear difference to Dean’s short cut. Well, seemed it didn’t help with Taylor.
. To finally let Cas’ words fully sink in and digest them. No more distraction, no more responsibilities, no more bone-crushing tiredness.
“Yes. Remember? A few days before that, you threatened to jump off a horse if I even dared to try and deliver you right to the doctor. You didn’t want to be caught with me because you were still embarrassed about the past. So when I heard that voice, all I could think of was your words and your fear of stirring up new gossip and… I couldn’t do that to you. So I tried to defuse the situation. But when I turned back around, you were gone.”
“Seriously, Taylor?” Sam pressed out. “All these years and you still confuse me for my brother? I even
Cas was saying something but Dean was so focused on getting it all out before Cas would stop him that he quickly interrupted him. “No, Cas please let me finish,” he begged. “All I want is for you to be happy. And if that means to be with him rather than with me, then I’ll accept that.”
As soon as the movie ended, Gracie monopolized Cas, and Dean tried not to watch as they first went to get their daily pie at
Dean did not believe a single word - but he couldn’t exactly force him to reveal more. Maybe it was a good thing that Gracie brought out her report card. With one last look at Cas, Dean let himself be pulled into his daughter’s excitement over her grades.
How exactly Dean got through the rest of the cookie sale, he had no idea. His head was in the game but he knew he was numb. He laughed and joked with the students, wished all of them a Merry Christmas whenever their shift ended, and tried his best to be his normal self.
Dean’s fingers nervously drummed against the steering wheel while he forced himself to take even breaths and not speed. The streets were still in terrible condition this early in the morning and he didn’t wanna risk any accidents.
care so much? We both know that this between us will never be more than friendship. Why do you keep pushing? You even try to use your daughter. Do
On instinct, Dean’s grip tightened. He really didn’t want Cas to think Dean didn’t want him close. That was until he realized that Cas was simply getting into a more comfortable position, lying on his stomach next to Dean instead of on top of him. He was resting his weight on his forearms, his back bent so he could look easily at Dean without having to strain his neck. As soon as Cas seemed to have settled, Dean turned towards him.
“Just wanted to say, Mr. Winchester… whatever’s going on right now, ehm… I’m glad you’re feeling better again.”
Twenty minutes later, Dean was cleaned and dressed, a small duffle bag hastily packed with the necessities to stay a night or two in New York if needed. With weather like this, one could never know. Leaving his room, he was still wondering what Grace had been talking about – when once again he heard familiar voices coming from his living room. As he had guessed, Sam and Eileen were there, but as he spotted the third person sitting on his couch, he stopped in his tracks, eyes wide in disbelief.
up by putting the prepared cookies into the oven to fulfill one of her wishes. Only halfway through, when the smell of vanilla and sugar hit him… only then did he remember that they were
“You sure about that?” Cas asked with a little smirk, moving his leg so it brushed against Dean’s cock – which was very much
He should probably have wondered why Gracie was giving in so quickly, but it was explained within seconds when she started talking about tomorrow’s contest again, the excitement in her voice addictive. For the rest of the drive, Dean couldn’t stop grinning about his daughter’s happiness, all thoughts about Cas pushed aside.
It took them way over half an hour to go around the field and judge all the art presented to them, the others taking a lot of time to judge every little detail. Until earlier when they’d gone over the list, he hadn't known some of his students had joined in as well. Now he was happy to see all the amazing designs they had come up with. Sadly, none of them scored high enough to get at the top of their list, but he would make sure to let them know they'd still scored high and done an awesome job.
He didn’t finish his thought but by the smile on Cas’ lips, he didn’t need to. Once Cas had taken a second bite, Dean pulled the pastry away and at the next red light, he held out the cup of cinnamon latte, which Cas greedily took and only handed back when the lights switched to green. Taking it, Dean put it in the cup holder and then turned back to his own baked goods and simple coffee for a moment – before the cycle started anew. Meanwhile, Dean had to agree, all this really tasted delicious and he understood why the little bakery around the corner from Cas’ penthouse was his favorite. Cas had insisted they make a little stop there before heading home and Dean had been unable to deny him.
The comment surely was meant to sound sweet - and for Emma, it probably did, since she sincerely meant it. But Dean had a hard time keeping his smile, especially when Lydia leaned down to greet him with a kiss on his cheek and then took the seat right next to him - instead of letting Emma sit there!
“Gonna invite me in?” he couldn’t help but ask, going for coy but knowing just as well that he had failed, his voice too full of emotion to not sound suggestive.
Luke turned around and while Dean could only see his back, he could hear the soft smile in his voice as he held something out to Grace. It was a folded piece of paper. “Castiel stopped by and asked me to give you this.”
“Alright, everybody.” Gabe chose that moment to speak up and Dean had to close his eyes and mentally restrain himself from snapping at his friend for choosing the worst time ever. The room instantly fell silent while Gabe got up from his chair. “Who’s ready to help clean up so we can start opening presents?”
any of this just lying around, didn’t want to risk Cas seeing it and being reminded of the terrible moment. So he had taken it with him.
, they were standing so close and he couldn’t listen any longer when Cas blamed him for playing with his feelings and all of a sudden, Dean surged forward, only enough presence of mind to catch their crash into the wooden wall of the barn so he wouldn’t crush Cas.
Dean waited with bated breath. It was a full two minutes before he finally saw something appear on his skin.
“You ready?” he asked in a calm voice and when his daughter nodded, he reached out an arm, relieved when she hugged into his side and let him lead them back to the car with an arm wrapped around her.
Encouraged by this reaction, Dean decided that it was time for a bold move. Reaching the tip of Cas’ cock, he did not hesitate to take him in his mouth.
But the thought went flying away when Cas’ eyes were back on him. There was one of these moments again, one of those that were charged with tension. That seemed to gravitate Dean closer towards Cas naturally. He could feel it - and he wanted to give in.
Dr. Richardson and Bobby were talking in low and soothing voices, discussing things simply to have something to do. If Dean hadn’t been so distracted, he would have spared a grin about their interaction. Bobby had known Amelia Richardson since she had been a little kid. Back then, her father had been the local vet, and while a good decade had passed since she’d taken over his practice… well, for Bobby, she was still the little girl he used to know.
His eyes flicked back to Gracie where she was wiping away a silent tear, which had Dean swallow hard.
Stretching, Dean got up and while pressing his phone between shoulder and ear, he put on some sweatpants and quietly walked over to Gracie’s room. As he opened the door, the early morning light from the hallway fell on his daughter’s sleeping face. It seemed to irritate her, as she wrinkled her nose, whimpered a tiny bit in her sleep and then turned around, clearly not ready to wake up just yet. Dean closed the door again, smiling.
His focus shifted a little bit then, back to the fact that he had his mouth on another man’s cock for the first time in his life, his hands gripping Cas’ ass to hold him steady. Dean tried to name his feelings in this moment but his mind was too engrossed in what he was doing and who he was with for that. So he went back to simply letting himself feel, taking his time as he kissed along the shaft. There would be many, many more opportunities like this to analyze everything but this was not the time for that. Especially not when he reached the head, letting instinct take over as he lightly sucked on it, licking over the slit. The taste of precum hit him then, his mind going completely blank as a groan escaped his throat.
More than that though, the cold clarity of her words finally pushed away the last of Dean’s haziness.
“Be right back,” he assured Gabe, who was already moving around the table to take his place, before bolting for the street.
Propping it against his wall, he took a new piece of paper, this time not starting with the stick figure but rather concentrating on drawing a nice moon. He took extra care with it, noticing how the easy task calmed him down. There was nothing elaborate about the illustration, but it was definitely recognizable as the moon. A lasso was also drawn around it but there was no space left to add a stick figure.
His waking dreams… well, those were another thing entirely and he couldn’t believe one of them turned into reality.
He also wanted so much more. He wanted to spend lazy Sunday mornings with him; wanted to cuddle under a blanket in front of the TV; wanted to watch him and Gracie have their pie-and-work-dates at
- boyfriend, Dean tried to ignore the conversation still going on. That was until Amara playfully slapped Gabriel’s shoulder.
With that in mind, he finally decided to man up once it was time for dinner. With his quick maneuvering, he secured the seat right next Cas, ignoring the cold shoulder he kept giving him.
The next punch was the strongest yet and after that, Dean stopped thinking and ran on autopilot as he took his churning emotions out on the bag.
When they had passed the lobby to take their leave, Christmas over all of a sudden, Dean had seen it lying on the floor. His gift to Cas. He hadn’t hesitated to pick up the card and its envelope, quickly pushing the letter back in before also picking up the DVD. He considered simply putting them down on the table next to the door. But… he couldn’t.
“It’s … it’s alright, Grace,” Cas replied, and Dean was glad he seemed to be sincere about it. Of course he would have had every right to be mad at Gracie for giving away a secret – but Dean would still have defended his daughter had Cas said anything mean to her because of it. Instead, Cas went on. “I didn’t mean for you to keep it from your dad, it’s okay. Of course you shouldn’t have to lie to him, so it’s alright.”
Still, his class kept their silence, the unease in the room bordering on the same atmosphere as last week.
He huffed a laugh, well aware of the heat in his cheeks as he averted his gaze. Quickly, he leaned in and pressed a kiss to Alice’s cheek.
But as he looked up at them, at his family, that voice was silenced before it could even set root. Because Dean knew, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that, for them, it didn’t matter how much he loved Cas - or how much he could come to love him.
“Ohhh, oh, oh, and yesterday,” Charlie babbled on while Dean tried to keep focused on her words, “we went to
He hadn’t even met C yet. And already, he hardly thought of anything else other than meeting them, hoping it would be soon.
Dean squeezed Cas’ thigh again before looking back on the road just as Cas took the turn towards the ranch.
“Are you crying?” he asked in shock, unable to put all this together and really starting to get frustrated now with the lack of forthcoming information. “Damn it, Cas, talk to me.”
“I apologize once again,” the stranger said, this time reaching for the map with a sure hand. “I’m a bit nervous. And lost, which makes me even more nervous.”
“Grace, baby, look at me,” he urged, hating that he had to disentangle her from his safe embrace to be able to see her face. “Pumpkin, what happened?”
Dean winced at that, even though Harry did not sound miffed about the situation. “I know that must look bad, but it's really not, I promise. You know I don’t like her walking home or getting a lift from anyone. She waits for me at Luke’s or the gazebo outside if it’s a nice day and one day the shop was really full and… well, Cas was there and she had just met him the day before or so and…  she sat with him. He’s a Shurley, even if he doesn’t go by that name anymore, so he’s a good man and -”
Cas nodded but did his best not to meet Dean’s eyes, turning his head away from him, down towards the ground.
Dean let his eyes wander around the open living room, taking in the high walls and open space, the artful decorations, the soft colors that matched and complemented each other, and the furniture that looked comfortable but stylish enough to belong in the living room of a rich person.
Thanks to circumstances, Dean had a free period right after his class this week. Enough time to collect himself again. As always, his students had dropped the topic after he had answered their questions - knowing full well that they would lose the privilege of open talks should they not respect the rules.
Simple, and yet, they did so much to Dean. He had just turned eighteen and knowing stories of people who had to wait some years before their counterpart would turn of age as well, he had never put much hope into getting in contact with his soulmate right this very day.
“The person after you isn’t here this weekend and the person after that is pregnant. Do you really want a poor, pregnant woman to have to do that?”
supposed to think, right? It was all a bit hazy between those noises Cas elicited from him and his hard cock being paid so much attention after so long, combined with all the new sensations.
Ignoring his friends’ disregard of the matter, he resigned himself to the fate of going practically naked to pride this year – just when his arm tingled again. Trying to convince Meg he really didn’t care which kind of g-string he wore, “Just pick one,” he stole himself away again, reading the message on his arm.
Finishing off a few more pancakes, Dean put the rest of the batter in the fridge and quickly hurried to take a shower. Once he was alone again, his smile fell away, all his thoughts back on Cas not showing up this morning. Which, of course, was completely stupid to even think about. It wasn’t as if they had agreed to meet or anything.
“Look,” Grace interrupted him, sitting up straighter. “Can you just… can you trust me on this? My instincts? I’ve watched him, Dad. I’ve
“Ah,” Dean replied, rolling his eyes. “What you saw was her finally annoying me enough that I told her off for good.”
compare Lydia to Cas - or their situations. But did Cas think that way? “She was interrupting a sacred moment,” he finally explained.
With that, he moved to the door and opened it. Stopping himself only one last time, he turned around and bit out, “Oh, and: Merry Christmas!” then he let the door
to say – forcing himself not to lose his focus. When the elevator dinged its arrival on the top floor, he took one last calming breath and then stepped into the hallway.
Turning back to his horse, he reached for her. But Cherry had detected his nerves and was whinnying in distress.
Dean looked up and over to Rebecca, who had spoken up during a lull in the conversation, gaining the attention of everyone around. Her focus though, Dean found, was on him and Cas.
him. But then Cas widened his stance and pulled Dean impossibly closer and the voice in his head was silenced as Dean took the invitation and pressed his leg against Cas’ hard cock and
“Don’t pretend like you’re not enjoying this, Winchester,” Michael replied, fixing him with a stern gaze.
The moment Cas took a bite, his eyes closed and for a few heartbeats, he seemed to be far away. Where that was, Dean wasn’t quite sure but soon enough, Cas looked back at him and leaned up. The kiss was sweet but brief, Cas quickly turning back to Gracie.
Back in his own bedroom, Dean’s eyes fell on the book cover and the name of Gracie’s favorite author.
He loved all those pictures on that wall – but the one he walked into now was the most wonderful of them all and for a second, the joy that filled him took his breath away. Leaning against the wall, he simply took it all in.
How could it be that the night from Dean’s perspective had been the best of his life, a dream come true, had opened his eyes to a new world… how could it be that the same night meant
A quick look back up showed him that Cas was still dozing, his breathing even and deep. Carefully, Dean moved lower, getting into a comfortable position right next to Cas’ cock. His gaze wandered between the length and Cas’ face. With the man still mostly asleep and yesterday’s talk about consent and mutual agreement about not minding to be woken like that still in Dean’s mind… he felt no restrain in taking his sweet time to get himself ready for what he really wanted to do. With a reminder that it was perfectly fine to go slow – which was as much for Cas’ benefit as his own – Dean leaned in and nuzzled against the soft skin of Cas’ thigh first. He pressed a tender kiss against the skin and then looked up. There was no change in either Cas’ position or his breathing, not even when Dean followed up with a few more kisses. With still no reaction, he moved his nose closer to Cas’ crotch. The smell was intoxicating, which amazed Dean. He had never thought he would enjoy inhaling the rich fragrance of musk and light tanginess, yet, once again, with Cas it felt natural.
Cas seemed like he couldn’t decide between being completely baffled or utterly amused, a funny range of emotions flitting across his face. In the end, he settled on a slightly solemn expression, saying, “I was under the impression it rather hurt you when I did it recently?”
Well, that probably made sense. Sipping his tea, Dean noticed too late that Jo still had her scrutinizing gaze on full power.
Cas didn’t need much encouragement, slowly moving so he was leaning over Dean, deepening their kiss. It didn’t seem enough for his man, as Dean took hold of his thigh, pulling Cas up to fully straddle him. Softly biting and nibbling on Dean’s lower lip, Cas smirked as he pulled the sweetest sounds out of his man, still amazed that he was to finally have this, to finally bask in their intimacy. And for just a moment, he was unable to stop his thoughts from wandering back over the past few hours; reminiscing on how they’d gotten here, wrapped around each other like this.
Their gaze never broke as he sank down onto Dean, both of them groaning as they held onto each other. Moving slowly at first, Cas soon set a steady pace, relishing how Dean’s fingers dug into the flesh of his ass cheeks, helping him keep the rhythm. The sounds filling the air were music to his ears.
By the time Kirk was finally done and walked off to take his shift with the sleigh rides around town, the first of Dean’s students had arrived. They covered the tables with white tablecloths and while Lily and Ava focused on decorating them with mistletoe, fir branches, and pine cones, Claire and Kaia arranged the boxes of cookies they already had.
Dean was still half-convinced that everybody was overreacting – Cas had made the decision to leave, so obviously, he was
He could see Cas shiver and while he was sure the man didn’t even notice, all he wanted to do was get him somewhere warm. But Cas wasn’t done yet with all he had to throw against Dean.
His students took in his words and he could see that they thankfully had some effect on them. He was sure they would still come up with two very good questions.
That man – that wonderful, wonderful man – entrusted a twelve-year-old with the draft to his next book? A fan with the very secret next installment to a long-running series?
“You’re welcome,” Cas replied and Dean almost pinched himself so he wouldn’t stare too hard at the cute little smile the man was wearing.
Hesitating for a moment, Dean was not sure how to reply. Obviously, he did not believe in fairytales anymore, he was a grown man after all. But he knew his friends did and did so very much. And of course, he was not going to ruin any fairytale for his little girl.
Now that was a surprise and Dean latched onto it, trying not to give away that inside of him, there was a war battling.
Of course, Dean knew some parts of this. He’d been the one Jo had opened up to first when she’d been confused about her sexuality. He just hadn’t known all these details.
Watching her for a second, Dean let his head drop back onto his seat and closed his eyes, taking a deep, deep breath. Knowing his daughter, this conversation was far from being over - but Dean would relish any moment of reprieve before his daughter remembered she wanted to have
“Maybe none of them paid as much attention to you as I did,” Dean replied softly. He suddenly wished he hadn’t said that - it was too dangerous.
. Trust me, the only reason I let my daughter read it at such a young age was the fact that I think it’s one of the best in its genre. Maybe
There was this awkward silence between them again as Dean tried to battle his feelings. Mostly trying to get them to be reasonable. To stay focused. To not wreak havoc in his head and against his insides and his -
Rolling on his back and resting his hands behind his head, he stared at his ceiling, once again letting his thoughts wander.
There was no reaction from Cas other than that he threw another shirt into his suitcase and then closed the lid. He was obviously done with packing.
look back around as he pushed open the door to his building and made his way inside. Leaving the strange encounter far behind him.
He was unable to stop himself from asking as he looked down at the paper in his daughter’s hand. Or rather,
“It’s okay, son,” Harry assured him, a caring smile softening his features - the kind of smile Dean could never remember seeing on John Winchester’s face.
To be honest, Dean couldn’t really tell at the moment. It was… strange? Not unpleasant. The weight on his tongue was actually something he could see himself enjoying. The taste wasn’t exactly pleasant, but it definitely wasn’t a turn-off either. All in all, he concluded that… yeah, this wasn’t bad. Not at all. He felt a bit unsure about doing it correctly – but he simply went by what he knew
Despite the close proximity, Cas still somehow got rid of Dean’s jeans and his boxer shorts, before helping him with shoes and socks. After another quick kiss, Cas moved over to the jacuzzi, leaving Dean to stare after him as he seemingly checked the temperature before draining some and then adding more hot water.
“Cold, okay? Is that what you want to hear?” Dean bit out, getting angry at Jo. Unreasonable, he knew, but still. “It was fucking cold because he still hates my guts. He can barely
Once they finally made it out of the city limits, the drive went as smooth as they could’ve hoped for, the weather had improved and the roads had been cleared while Dean and Cas snuggled in their happy bubble. They talked and laughed the whole drive and sometimes even sat idly and in content silence, Dean unable to keep from laying his hand on Cas’ thigh.
“Good morning,” he whispered as he leaned up, gazing down at his boyfriend. And yes, thinking that term had Dean giddy with excitement.
Some lines were scratched out, others rewritten a few times with different wording, some arrows showed where she wanted to rearrange sequences in the final version – all in order to send away one letter that held exactly what Gracie wanted to say, he was sure of it. But no matter in which way, no matter how rough these pages of a drafted letter were, they were all words written down by his daughter.
Pushing away that gloomy thought, Dean joined in the general excitement that had erupted in their living room while Charlie and Jo gave them a mini-tour around the place beneath the Eiffel Tower. Whenever Charlie’s excitement led to her talking too fast for her lips to be read clearly, Jo always remembered to sign along for Eileen’s benefit – such a natural move that it showed Dean just how often this probably happened when the two couples video chatted.
, all his dark thoughts had been fully erased and all that was left was the memory of the first real smile Dean had seen since Cas’ return.
Once he'd dropped her off at Miss Patty's dance studio, Dean made his way over to the town square to see if there were a few last minute things that needed to be taken care of. He ended up helping Kirk with the stage decoration, Taylor Doose running around with his checklists and driving them all crazy. As was so often with these things, no matter how early preparation started, there was always last minute shit that went wrong or was missing.
Wanted to see him smile and laugh. Wanted to be the reason he smiled and laughed. Wanted to hold him close; wanted to kiss him, feel him, taste him. He wanted things with and from him that he had never let himself think about before; had never had reason to think about before.
His feelings might still be raw but with a few hours too cool down, Dean found that he at least could be certain about that. Cas really cared for Gracie and Dean was grateful for that.
Shaking his head, Dean dropped the book on his nightstand before finally getting ready for bed himself.
“Is this warm enough?” Cas asked as he pulled one of the blankets over his shoulders, covering Dean’s legs in the process.
to feel shitty because it was just the friendship that connected him to Cas. He convinced himself of all those lies without ever really thinking about any of it. It had been like a coping mechanism. Something he had no need to actually think about
Therefore it was pretty damn good she had so many self-proclaimed uncles who loved to shower her with gifts. But it also meant Dean really had to put some thought into this every year, if only to make sure he outdid the uncles. Not that he minded, of course. And while there would still be presents waiting for her under the tree when she would wake up tomorrow, his main one was in his hands right now.
“We’re so happy for you, Dean,” Jo’s voice finally came through the speakers at a normal volume again. “You deserve it.”
grow up and get over their schoolboy crush.” Jo already opened her mouth, but Dean was faster. “And embarrassed? Why would he be embarrassed?”
They could’ve probably drawn it out far longer and someday soon, they would. Someday soon, they would spend a whole day in bed exploring each other, and just stay intertwined and connected in every way possible. Right now though, Cas was too overwhelmed by all the sensations to slow down; especially when Dean bent his legs, giving himself leverage to meet Cas’ thrusts. It didn’t take long after that before Cas was seeing stars. And given Dean’s deep groan and the shiver running through his body, he was right behind him.
“We know that. And the right partner by your side will know that as well. And accept it. It won’t mean that you will love them any less or that they are just a replacement. Love is love, Dean, and it certainly isn’t black and white. And you, my boy… you have the biggest heart.”
“No, Cas,” Dean promised as he rested his forehead against Cas’. “I wouldn’t mind at all. I would never mind being seen with you in any way.”
Once the last student had left his classroom, Dean sank down into his chair, just staring straight ahead. Today had been the worst so far, and he didn’t even know what made him more moody: the thing with Cas, or the fact that Gracie was mad at him. Since he couldn’t really do anything about Grace’s mood, other than ask for her forgiveness once more and then maybe bribe her with some hot chocolate, Dean’s thoughts quickly wandered towards Cas, papers on his table all but forgotten.
Gracie was sitting at the kitchen island, a plate full of pancakes in front of her, a mug of hot chocolate – based off her chocolate mustache – in her hand, which appeared to be forgotten as Gracie babbled on quite happily, her story making Cas smile.
Like with the question if he should really gift Ruby's foal to Gracie. The horse would give birth around Christmas and Grace had begged to have it be hers ever since they’d found out Ruby was pregnant. Sure, it was a lovely thought, but it also meant a lot of responsibilities. Then again, maybe it would help Gracie get rid of the underlying fear Dean knew she still had. Not that it was keeping her away from the horses in general but the fact that, so far, she hadn't asked him to be allowed back in a saddle told him everything. Gracie had grown up on the back of a horse. After Lisa's death, they had moved to Bobby's ranch, and Gracie had spent as much time as possible riding, or hanging out in the stables or outside at the paddock.
At first, Cas only laughed. After a moment, though, he pulled Dean in for another kiss – this one already more heated.
They shared a few lazy kisses now and then, but mostly they just lay together, with Dean resting his head on Cas’ shoulder and Cas leaning his cheek against it while drawing lazy patterns over his chest; both relishing in this newfound closeness.
It appeared not to be good enough, though. “I think I’ll pass,” Cas replied, moving forward, obviously wanting to get inside.
Not looking back, he made his way to the weight room, not even bothering with the changing rooms. It wasn’t as if anyone else would be here right now. Quickly getting changed, Dean searched for a playlist on his phone and connected it to the Bluetooth speaker in the room, blasting it on full volume as he threw on his boxing gloves and made his way over to the punching bag.
Only focusing on the building he had to get to, Dean was momentarily distracted by someone calling his name, waving over at him. Not slowing down, he raised his hand to wave – only to barrel into another body a second later.
Dean grit his teeth. He had no choice but to shake Brady’s hand, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do.
Dean closed the passenger door and moved to the back to throw Gracie’s bag in the trunk. Walking around to the driver’s side, Dean swore the moment he saw how close the car next to his side had parked.
However, that didn't change the fact that Dean had absolutely no desire to talk to her now. Especially if it meant leaving Cas and Gracie, even if it was only for a few minutes.
“And again, you’re making it too easy. Dean, I’m telling you. It’s not like lighting strikes you or anything. Jo and I didn’t even realize it until a few days later.”
The irony of his movie choice was not lost on him and he had to smile at how this movie had just gained so much meaning for the two of them.
“Oh, don’t worry, boy,” Miss Patty replied, making Dean almost roll his eyes. No matter how old he would get, for Patricia LaCosta he would always be a boy. “They’re all so excited, they don’t even feel the cold.”
She was right and he couldn’t believe he had been moping and had been angry for two days without ever realizing it.
He had sat with them again yesterday, Cas’ laugh carefree and infectious. Today, Dean was sure his students had become aware of his somewhat improved, though still tense mood, probably wondering if he was going through a midlife crisis with how capricious he had been.
He tried not to - really, he did! - but as he handed the phone over to Cas, his gaze was drawn to the screen. There was a pic of Cas, together with another dude.
Dean was about to ask what the fuck that even meant. Why that had anything to do with their shared night – when Cas’ phone came to life, playing a song Dean hated to recognize. And yep, he certainly was a masochist, for even though he
The kiss goodbye lingered longer than was probably appropriate with Gracie by their side, but Dean couldn’t find it in him to care. Cas had stayed at the ranch for another hour, spending some time with Grace and visiting the new foal, but now the time had come that he needed to leave.
Oh, this was too good to be true. Squeezing Gracie’s hand to keep her from giggling, he himself had to hold back his laugh. It took all his self-control to not break as he spoke the next words. “What, you haven’t heard yet? And here I was, thinking
our daughter. You chose her, Dean. And every day you showed her how much she meant to you. How could she have done better? To have someone who not only loves her but also
Unable to keep his hands still, Dean reached for Cas’ dick, reveling again in the feeling of it in his hand as he began to stroke him. Cas’ eyes opened, his gaze hazy and filled with lust but also with love and bliss, and when he leaned down, Dean happily welcomed the kiss. They stayed like this for a moment, Cas’ breathing hitching from time to time as he kept up with the slow movement of his hips, fucking into Dean’s hand and then back on his fingers. There was no way for Dean to tell how far Cas was with prepping himself but he had a feeling that it was thoroughly done.
Sweaty and sated, they sank back into each other’s arms, Cas only strong enough to pull the blanket over them before he stretched out his limbs and sprawled over his man, content and happy.
Too soon, Cas pulled back again and this time, Dean blindly chased him. He was sure there was a grin on Cas’ lips as he pressed them to Dean’s once more, the kiss short and certainly not enough.
for the reason you’re thinking.” When he didn’t continue right away, Jo and Charlie just stared at him, for once not using his silence to accuse him some more. “I knew about his feelings for me,” he finally confessed in a whisper. “Had known for a while. And … I should have …” He was searching for the right words to say, but it was harder than expected. “I should have talked to him before the wedding. And that day, I should have gone after him and – I don’t know – apologized to him, or something.”
Dean tried to swallow but his mouth was too dry. He knew all this, of course. Knew the stories, knew the legends. He had just never thought… had never even considered…
But even with all this, Dean had still somehow hoped Gracie would never find out. Especially since she’d become friends with Cas. Because this was certainly the one question he’d never wanted to hear her ask: “So … is it true? I almost wouldn’t be here? Cas almost prevented me being born?”
Cas brushed away his comment with a quick, “Of course, that’s not what I meant,” before tilting his head and scrutinizing Dean. “You said you’d only booked a one-way ticket.”
And he clearly, oh so very clearly still hated Dean. If the cold shoulder from earlier hadn’t been enough to let Dean know, this encounter certainly had been.
Getting Gracie ready this morning was easy because she was done and out the door before he’d even pulled on his boots. Maybe he should feel jealous that she was so excited about joining the contest when it was someone else by her side, but he simply didn’t. If at all, her excitement and happiness as well as knowing that Cas was the one who was making her so happy … yeah, damn, it warmed his heart. Seemed like he really did need to follow Jo’s advice and
proud of you.” He pressed another kiss to her head before cradling her face in his hands to make his baby girl look at him. “It doesn’t matter if you take a wrong step or not. The fact that you’ll be dancing at all is already amazing.” A small smile formed on her lips and Dean smiled with her. “Just go up there and dance. Don’t think about anything else. It’s all about having fun, remember?”
“Awesome,” Gracie replied with a huge smile. After setting down her plate and taking a cookie for herself, she cuddled up on Dean’s other side. Dean hugged her close and pressed a kiss to her hair, murmuring, “I love you, pumpkin,” before looking back at his boyfriend.
It was only another few minutes and they were pulling into a space near the fair. Gracie was out of her seat and the car even before Dean had finished pulling the keys from the ignition. He simply snorted and exchanged an amused look with his in-laws as she called out for them all to hurry up.
As he followed his request, Dean wound his arm around Cas’ back, supporting his waist while also gripping his forearm with his right hand, trying to give him as much stability and support as possible.
“Arrrrgggghhh,” he heard her growl, her naked feet stomping on the floor, followed by the door banging shut. Usually, he would reprimand her for that, but right now all he wanted was for her to go to bed and get some sleep. He would make it up to her in the morning with some pancakes.
Cas nodded in agreement as his thoughts seemed to wander far away – most likely to two weeks ago. A moment later though, his eyes went wide and his gaze caught Dean’s again as he exclaimed, “Oh God, I know why. That Sunday was the day you told me you know I’m C. S. James. It completely distracted me and–”
For those reasons and those reasons alone, Dean went with a second truth he hoped would soothe Cas’ insecurity.
Their rather chaste kiss by the lake had quickly turned to more, both of them starving for this, starving for the touch, the connection, the closeness to the other. It had taken a lot of willpower to not let it go too far right there by the water’s edge and instead make their way over to Dean’s car. Even though Cas practically lived across the street, Dean still drove them there safely while Cas never once fully let go of him. They both knew this was so much more than just sex. So much more than to just reach the peak, to just find completion. It was about being able to finally get lost in each other.
“I wanted to be near you, but I needed to admit to myself what I’d known for years: that I didn’t care that you are a man. That my feelings for you were real, no matter your gender. And once I had finally admitted that to myself, I also had to come to terms with –” Dean had to stop at that, swallowing hard, trying not to let his emotions get the better of him. “With the knowledge that I never loved Lisa the same way I love you now.”
Great, so when had the roles between them changed? Since when was his daughter the one to worry about her dad?
Dean got him to the hospital. Which was exactly what Dean wanted to yell at him but since that wouldn't get him far, he pressed his lips together, forcing himself to count to ten so he didn’t say anything he would regret later on.
Dean had to force his breath to stay even but he was unable to stop his eyes from roaming all over Cas’ face, trying to take in every inch. “Yes,” he finally whispered. “I... I just had to come back.”
“Dean, Sam,” Chuck called out, looking rather unfazed by all the held breaths around him. “So great to see you, boys. And Eileen, hello my love.”
“I’m not –” Dean started, only to realize that he would not be able to keep his voice down in this conversation. He finally gave in, unwound his arms, and started to sign.
Dean chuckled before he caught sight of the clock on his microwave. Putting down the pen, he hastily stuffed the last of the pizza pieces in his mouth and got his stuff together before picking the pen up again.
Cas’ words had Dean’s heart racing. Any second, Cas would turn around and see Dean. He was chuckling as he hung up and not knowing what to do, Dean did the only thing he knew he was good at: playing a nonchalant cocky bastard. He leaned against the frame as if he’d been like this all along, just as Cas turned around and visibly jumped out of his skin.
Thankfully, it turned out that they were closer to the path than Dean had thought possible. In his fear for Cas, it had seemed like his search down the hill had taken forever when really, it wasn’t all that bad. It gave him hope that Cas’ injuries were also limited to just the messed-up arm.
It had probably been stupid that he’d let his friendship with Cas suffer because of this. Most of the town knew of their closeness anyway, and the rest of them at least knew that Dean and Michael were best friends. Still, when the time came, Dean had put away Cas’ nickname and called him by his full name for the first time in his life.
every day now and that she hoped Cas would come back more often - or better yet, stay in Stars Hollow.
“We know that, too, Dean,” Alice assured him right away, taking his hand into hers again. “We’re not here to judge. Or to accuse you that you didn’t love our daughter. We know you did.”
More shreds of memories came floating back and Dean realized: the longer he sat here, the deeper he would drown in them.
Still, father and daughter both listened intently as Charlie and Jo told them about their highlights of this week. But as soon as they finished their call - most likely leaving them to a night in a German bar and with the promise to be ready to chat again next week at the same time - Gracie and Dean got ready for the day at the fair. As the movie fanatics they were, they had memorized the schedule of all the movies being shown today by heart.
is pretty thorough, so she edited some stuff I then also had to change in AC 😅 she's a horse person, and one of her comments about this chapter was: "nope, you need more horse lingo in this! Just lemme do it" 😂 Ariel, I LOVE YOU
- a silent question as he leaned even further into his space. Praying that Cas would be on board. He watched Cas’ lips begin to part - whether to ask a question or to gasp - Dean wasn’t sure. Cas could be about to tell him to fuck off, but Dean hoped he was reading the look in Cas’ eye right. The look that said he wanted this.
“I could never,” Dean whispered, finally finding his words again. “Lisa will always be in my heart.”
While Cas kept babbling slurred nonsense, Dean took a moment to let the feeling of a cock in his mouth sink in. Really sink in. Cas’ reaction was amazing – but how did it feel for him?
You have already given me sooo many amazing ideas for what else to write and I'm looking forward to fulfilling as many of your wishes as I can 💙💚
He knew he was delirious but he didn’t care. He was so close from opening his mouth and just declaring Cas his undying love – when one particular stroke did him in.
Of course he knew when they were standing in front of Cas and Grace’s, hardly able to keep from smiling. What a wonderful lumberjack, even better than the one Gracie and he had planned during practice. He was wondering how much of this had been Cas’ influence while Miss Patty already raved over the little details. Like the beard or the little twigs sticking out of the beanie like strands of hair. It quickly got a ten from all of them, and Dean was glad he didn't have to defend giving his daughter’s snowman the highest points.
One that he actually noticed fall minimally when her gaze landed on Cas. She didn’t even greet him, only sent him a nod.
Once he had Cas spread underneath him again, boxed in with his arms and leaving little to no space between their bodies, Dean was thrilled to see that the frustrated look on his lover’s face had vanished, a groan pulled from him so filthy and full of longing that Dean didn’t hesitate to move. Strong legs wound around his hips, urging him and – Jesus, that position was simply marvelous. The feeling of Cas around him, around his dick, in his arms,
It felt right and amazing and so damn satisfying – emotionally as well as physically – that Dean couldn’t imagine ever wanting anything else. Or anyone else.
more and for a second – just a second – Dean considered laying his heart completely bare. But… something held him back. He knew how he felt about Cas – always had, always would. But he didn’t want to tell him simply to reassure him. Not while they were in bed together, about to get frisky. It would look like he’d only said it so they could have sex and, well… that felt cheap. After all these years, Cas deserved more.
What little part of his mind had still been occupied by all these thoughts went silent as well the very moment Cas’ hand buried itself in Dean’s hair, tugging and, yes, also gently guiding him. Dean couldn’t help the little moan escaping him as his eyes closed and he let go. Really let go, to simply feel the moment.
Dean was pulled out of his sleep by yet another dream. He rolled over in bed and stared up at the ceiling as he recalled warm skin on skin, closeness, comfort. Intimacy.
“Fiiiiine,” she replied, only a little bit pouty, not enough to make Dean believe she was really annoyed. After all, he did his best to raise her well and she knew this was not a time for reading but for family. Therefore, she put the pages and the card back into the box and then put the lid back on. A moment later, she was back in Cas’ arms, hugging him close as she thanked him over and over again. Making not only Cas smile, but also Dean.
The moment Dean sat down, his knee bumped into Cas’. He knew he could move, readjust his sitting position slightly. But this was exactly what Dean had wanted. Some contact between them to show his brain that his body wasn’t reacting at all.
“The next time, eh?” Dean asked with a lopsided smile, pulling Cas into a loose embrace as he leaned back against the kitchen counter. “Does that mean… you’ll move back to Stars Hollow?”
Satisfied, Dean recalled that the shivering had stopped sooner though… somewhere in the middle of their hot kisses…
But for one, Grace didn’t do stuff like that often and always only out of fun - she would never be misbehaved with him for real.
Dean looked closer now, knowing that while the form was easily made with a mold, Gracie still had to color it all by herself. The dragon he held was different shades of green, every scale painted individually. His daughter had clearly put a lot of time into this.
Cas forced himself not to stare after the handsome stranger as the man moved along. His whole body was still covered in goosebumps and he couldn’t even explain why. He had never reacted to a stranger like this, had always needed an emotional connection with a person to even consider them desirable. Since the first day D had replied to him, even that had vanished.
“Let’s try the first option,” Cas breathed out, much to Dean’s relief. He really did not want to leave Cas alone in such a condition.
“Hold onto her mane,” he heard himself say, unconsciously leaning closer to Cas, his lips almost grazing the shell of his ear. This was bad - so, so bad. He tried to concentrate on his words instead. “This is going to be a bit rough.”
“Point is,” Cas went on, obviously set on ignoring Dean’s comment. “These books formed a whole generation and it hasn’t stopped. So does it really matter if the language isn’t up to par? Is the better book still one that has a remarkable language but hardly anyone has heard of as long as they weren’t in Dean Winchester’s literature class?”
With that, he took their empty bottles and Eileen’s glass into the kitchen. His family knew him well enough to know that pushing now would not help their matter at all, so they let him be.
“Oh, shush, you!” A backhanded slap landed on his upper arm, just enough to sting and to tell him what Alice thought of his comment. “I don’t want to hear you think such crap ever again!”
“Just wanted to buy her her favorites. So she has something to munch on while she’s watching her new best friend.”
The collective murmur suddenly rising startled Dean back to attention. Looking around, he tried to catch some scraps of conversations while searching for the cause of the turmoil. Over the sea of heads he couldn’t see it right away, but soon enough, his eyes fell on the one person Dean hadn’t seen in almost thirteen years.
Thankfully, Taylor was done at last and Miss Patty entered the stage, the girls all following her. Dean spotted his baby girl right away and after a moment of searching, Gracie found him as well. Sending her a huge smile before whistling and clapping even louder, Dean could see how the nervousness left her and some of the excitement she’d radiated the past few days finally came back. All the kids got into position and a moment later,
Eileen did something she rarely did and covered his hands, holding them lightly in hers to effectively stop him from signing. Stop him from speaking.
“It was a spur of the moment thing,” he said as if it meant nothing. He wasn’t even lying, not really. “Even though it seems we kinda think alike,” he added, holding up the book, before pointing at the envelope in Cas’ hand, “The real gift…”
“We were already wondering how you didn’t freeze up there,” his sister-in-law told him with a scolding tone, reaching out to correct his lapel and patting him on the chest when it was all set. “It’s not like you were working so hard that it was keeping you warm.”
Once again, he looked down at his phone. Still no message. It was nearing midnight, Cas had been gone for hours, and still no word from him.
“They knew – just like Lisa, they knew that I wanted to run after you that day in church. They knew I had feelings for you while still vowing my eternal love to their daughter. And now they tell me that it’s alright,” he choked out, giving up all pretense of keeping it together as he clung to Cas.
“Damn, I wish we could,” Cas sighed. “But they’re closed over the holidays. They always take this time off, family-run business and all. But the next time we’re in New York, I’ll take you there, promise.”
As he stepped up to Cas, his boyfriend took the pan with bacon off the stove and turned towards him. Without hesitation, Dean caught his lips in an innocent kiss. One that still sent thrills and shivers through his body, setting him on fire in the best way possible.
The answering smile had Dean’s heart skip a beat. It accelerated as he watched Cas reach into his vest to pull out a small present himself. And when he held it up with the words, “Sure. After all, I got you something as well,” Dean was ready to burst with happiness.
“The pages are loose leaf,” Dean explained, “So you won’t hesitate to fill them because you’re worried to ruin the whole notebook. If you mess up one page – which I’m sure you won’t, but… you know, just in case – you can just take the page out. No harm done to the book itself.”
Dean waited until Cas had come to rest once more – enjoying the new view Cas’ turning now gave him. Cas’ cock was already half-erect and without really noticing, Dean licked his lips. He had gotten a taste of it already, yes, but so far he had been hesitant to try more.
Hardly able to contain the bubble of laughter, Dean caught Cas looking at him and when their gazes met, the two lovers shared a secret grin.
Cas’ comment was unexpected and Dean was confused as to what he was talking about. When he looked at him, it dawned on Dean what he meant and his gaze wandered to the closing door.
Until then… well, until then, Dean would have to live with the fact that even his favorite pornos didn’t do it for him anymore. Not when his every waking thought, and some not so waking thoughts, was about Cas.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Cas answered right away. But Dean was not to be fooled. He knew he was right.
For what it was worth, Dean was sure now that he was not into men. Not in general, at least. He could appreciate them and… yeah, seeing them naked was surely not a turn-off.
He also didn’t want to burden them with this the second C got home, of course. So it was another few days until Dean was finally brave enough to breach the topic.
Yes, he could respect that promise – for a promise it was. Not just a threat, not some empty words. There was no doubt in his mind that Zar was capable of going through with what he’d said.
Still hopelessly overwhelmed with the whole situation, Dean couldn’t answer right away. Had Cas seriously just been talking to his daughter for who knew how long? Had Gracie managed to do what Dean hadn’t been able to?
“You once told me that Cas was brave when he told you about his feelings. Even when he knew he was too late. Even when he thought you didn’t love him back.”
Her last few words were pressed out before her tears fell for real, but her smile never wavered. He couldn’t even tell who moved first, a moment later, they were in each other’s arms, hugging close.
The thought stung like a bee, but once it had latched onto his mind, it just wouldn’t go away. Did Cas seriously forego his morning run just so he didn’t have to meet Dean? Really?
Together, they headed over to the town square, which was now filled with more vendors than usual and a life-sized Nativity instead of the stage and seating area. Those weren’t needed anymore, as there was no big event planned for tomorrow. Despite all the complaining in the beginning, Dean had to admit that Taylor had been right in the end - a whole month filled with a Christmas fair and different events every Sunday
Cas closed his eyes and Dean could see him shake his head minutely. What he said, though, was not a denial. It wasn’t a confirmation either, but it might as well have been.
But Cas didn’t pull back, so Dean slowly intertwined their fingers, gave him one soft, reassuring squeeze, and then simply held his hand as they stood together and watched a new life come into this world.
Dean had to suppress a chuckle. “You little –” he began to breathe out but interrupted himself. Instead of playfully scolding Cas, he thought of a better ‘punishment’. Letting his lips hover over the sweet spot behind Cas’ ear, touching it just barely, just so, just a feather-light touch of his lips, he murmured, “You’ll pay for that later.”
It was a big round of hellos before the group started their way to downtown Lincoln, towards the Pride Parade. There were many restrictions still, the pandemic not yet fully defeated – but there was also a lot of reason for hope and at least, they were allowed to celebrate together again.
He could have probably sat here for hours and still wouldn’t have found an answer to that. How was he to reply to such an honest admission from his daughter? His
“Would you please stop apologizing to me,” Cas softly begged, and as Dean felt a hand brush through his hair and then rub his neck, he closed his eyes to take in the feeling; still listening to Cas as he said, “Having emotions is not a reason to apologize.”
However, Cas just stood there, frozen, not making the slightest move to even react to Gracie’s plea…
“Yes, Gracie,” Cas replied, smiling, while Dean rolled his eyes behind his back. Leave it to Grace to still worry about her new friend even though she should know to trust her dad. “I’m really okay. Your dad is right, we talked it out.”
With one final tightening of the hug, they both pulled away, smiling at each other - and Dean could tell that Alice had needed that hug just as much as he had.
For a fleeting second, he wondered if maybe this handsome stranger could be D for him to react like that – but then he caught sight of the time and gasped in shock. He was going to be so late! Focusing back on the directions the stranger had given him, he hastened along the path and towards his job interview.
“That doesn’t make sense,” Michael said, more to himself than Dean, quite obviously racking his brain for something. “He never said anything… no, we would’ve known.”
What had been easy to ignore last Saturday - when they were out in the open space and surrounded by so many other people - was almost torturous now. Here in the dark, their elbows brushing together, Cas’ breath ghosting along Dean’s skin when he leaned in to whisper. Torture.
Closing his eyes, Dean lifted his girl up in his arms, hugging her tight as he soaked up the moment. “I did,” he finally replied, opening his eyes to catch Cas’ gaze over his daughter’s shoulder. “And I don’t intend to ever let him go.”
“Hey, I’m not a snob,” Cas exclaimed, stabbing his pointer finger into Dean’s chest. “I’m just stating facts.”
Careful not to jostle the hand, Dean began to move his fingers up Cas’ forearm, touching him softly every few inches in search of other spots that had possibly suffered from the fall.
Dean’s eyes went wide at Michael’s unmasked words. It was one thing having his brother and friends know about it - but while Michael certainly counted to this category as well, it was still something different having
Normally, they would’ve been here yesterday, after opening presents and enjoying a big Christmas breakfast.
“No, I’m serious,” Cas replied, even though he did not sound so sure at all. “I mean… your horse can’t carry two men, right?”
His thoughts circled around the same few questions, again and again, never giving him a chance to think about what he would actually say to Cas once he was standing in front of him. Therefore, it also came as a surprise when the truck finally pulled into the Shurleys’ driveway.
The noises of the bustling streets all around him were still loud and all-consuming, cars honking and tires screeching and people yelling.
As she kept kneeling, quite obviously silently talking to her mother, maybe praying as well, Dean let his eyes wander from her hunched shoulders to the gravestone itself.
“I... I guess it’s true,” he continued, almost as if to himself, surprised that he finally understood. “You can love more than one person. I mean... you told me you’d always loved me and yet you have that guy up there and I’m not going to argue that you don’t really love him –”
He spaced out on Taylor announcing the third place, only just coming back when Gabe celebrated the second place as if they had won. He knew his friend would love the gift certificate for $50 at
“What ever happened to your little bet?” she inquired in genuine curiosity. “The one with Cas finding a better author than Kurt Vonnegut?”
The first touch of his lips against the velvety skin of Cas’ cock was… amazing, actually. But it was mostly Cas’ reaction to it that was exhilarating. He could see his legs tremble and Cas’ hands found Dean’s shoulders again, his grip almost painful this time. Not that it bothered Dean at all. How could it?
“Better,” Dean allowed, already feeling a grin tug on his lips, happiness slowly setting root inside of him, spreading further with every word Cas spoke next.
When Jo spoke again, her voice was soft, nothing left of the hard edge that had been there earlier. “Slowly, to be honest. First, I would just seek out her company, thinking it was normal. She was my friend after all, right?”
Deciding to step away from the stables, hoping to not disturb the group inside, he closed the barn door behind him. Already stepping towards Cas, he tried to get a handle on the situation, asking, “What are you talking about?”
That he wanted him in his bed and that he wanted to forget the world while it was just the two of them. He wanted
, trying not to let his confusion show too much. Most likely, Cas had had the same thought as Dean, trying to hide from Brady and any further gossip. Which was good, of course. It was just… well, he might have hoped that Cas would have waited for him a bit further down the alley. He didn’t have to run away completely, right?
“Good question,” Dean pressed out, hoping he didn’t sound too bitter. They finally reached the car and got inside, Dean hoping the topic would be over. Soon enough, he realized that wasn’t the case, because Gracie was looking at him as if she was expecting more to his answer. “Look, I don’t know, okay?” He had a pretty good guess, but he wasn’t telling his daughter about that. “You would need to ask him.”
Groaning, he pushed away his blankets and made his way over to his office. Carefully closing the door so he wouldn’t disturb his daughter, Dean sat down and reached for the yearbook that still lay on his table. Though what he really wanted was what he had hidden under it.
