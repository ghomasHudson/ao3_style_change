Cas loved that Dean answered Bal, but he looked Cas in the eye as he replied. The alpha looked him in the eyes, and held. If he wasn’t an omega that would be normal, but no one held the gaze of an omega. No. One.
"Hold on Blondie-Girl, hold on." Dean helped her sit down on Cas' lap before she ended up face first in Cas' french toast with blueberry maple syrup.
"Which one?"
Cas watched as the wall began to shimmer, then shake as it began to fade away like pixels. All he could make out was that there were others in the room they were stepping into. He had one foot through the portal when he heard the office door slam open.
Dean wiped more tears as they fell from the blue-eyed omega that had already stolen his heart, and swore that no-one would hurt this beautiful soul ever again. He would spend eternity making sure that Cas knew how precious he was to Dean.
"Oops?"
The omega turned away and directed his attention to the beds of blooming plants, shrubs and trees. This time of year was filled with a bountiful variety, and the gardeners maintained a lovely balance of color and style.
“We kill some vamps and I get home to my angel.”
*sighs*
He had searched forever to find something to tell his parents because his mom would check. She was more protective and nosey than his dad. She had good intentions, she just didn't believe that there was anything off limits for her to ask. He was embarrassed many times as a kid with her asking people how they met their soulmate and how it felt when they laid their hands on their hearts.
“Dean, Alpha! Please!!” Each word was accentuated with a grunt from the force of Dean’s thrusts.
“Yeah, no sweat. Ha! I mean, he mostly lays in your bedroom and cries, poor dude. I'm getting him some more water and cool rags. Check in later?”
"Yeah well, in my opinion Dad's been pissy since he was passed over for Archangel when he mated with Mom. He only talks to us by giving us orders because he can't order anyone else around. When you are mated and become a Virtue he won't be able to order you around anymore."
“No, I was waiting for you...shouldn't I?”
What was
“Yes.”
“You kinda want to watch Dean let his alpha out, don'tcha ?”
“Dean?” His mate placed a hand on his arm.
“Let’s go, Dean.”
“Yes! Oh, Alpha....don’t want to come til you knot me. Knot me, Alpha!” he cried out.
"Fine. He'll be out here soon. Be nice, Bal. I want you to get along with my mate, please."
Each hand grabbed a cheek and spread them out to expose his dripping, pink hole. Gods, yes, he was going to feast on that. Castiel licked and sucked and thrust his long tongue inside of his beautiful omega. The slick was even sweeter than his scent and the alpha couldn’t decide if he liked the taste better than the sounds his Dean was making. Lucky for him, he could have both.
Dean sighed when he watched his mom kiss Bobby on the cheek, in thanks for a small figurine of a turtle dove that he gave her. So far, Bobby had impressed Mary (and Dean, to be honest) with his instincts for courting gifts. He was happy for them both. For a while after John had been forced to fall, Dean and Sam had 'peeked' in on him, and every time he was in a bar drowning his sorrows instead of doing good as Michael had demanded. Dean was curious as to what his Original Sire was going to do to John, but right at this moment he didn't care, and right now he was happy to see his mate walking towards him.
“Mary, may I ask you something?”
Dean felt like a creeper cuddled up to Cas, just watching as whatever the omega was dreaming about played across his face. It seemed to be a good dream since there was a sweet smile on his face along with the adorable crinkles at the edge of his eyes. He had been awake for a few hours just looking at his mate with wonder, so happy that they were about to have another pup. Speaking of pups, he heard Emmie beginning to move around in her crib so he slowly eased his way from their bed to go to her.
The new challenger was young and fresh. Should Dean worry?
Dean closed his eyes and concentrated on following the connection with his mate to feel for his pup. Once he sensed her, he flew them straight there. He didn’t mean to land right next to the chair that Cas’ sister was sitting in, which caused her to scream, which then caused the pup in the cradle across the room to start squalling. Oops.
They had been driving for just under ten hours, trading off every so often for the other to try to get some sleep. The nest had been larger than they thought, so they were pretty beat up, but the stress of being so far from Cas is what was hurting Dean the most. When Sam was driving, Dean couldn’t sleep for thoughts of finally being with his angel, in the biblical way. It had been his most recurring fantasy to knot the blue-eyed angel, since that day in the barn.
Dean’s growl (he assumed he found the slick-scented tshirt) spurred him on. He had just gotten into the bedroom and had hidden behind the bathroom door, when he heard the alpha’s bare feet smacking against the floor in approach. Cas could hear the sharp snarls of his alpha as he drank in his scent. The scent of  the soap his alpha had used along with the lightening in his scent got sharper as Dean’s arousal grew. It smelled like a thunderstorm in the bunker, and when combined with his scent of lilacs and honey? It was the best damn thing Cas had ever smelled.
"Oh, it looks as if Dean has found his one. So, come on now. Don't be shy. He won't bite, at least on stage. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dean the Rough boy!"
"Thank you. Come."
Dean sat still waiting for his mate to pick a side. He watched Cas’ hand slowly come towards his neck, gently pushing his head to the side. He kept his eyes on him as the omega leaned forward to plant his nose into the left side of Dean’s neck, and scented him. He felt a soft kiss before the sharp bite of Castiel’s teeth broke his skin, marking him as a Mated Alpha. He knew that everyone in the room could smell how happy his alpha was.
“Are you happy, Castiel?” He was surprised at the seriousness on his brother’s face.
"Dean, Emmie wants to come back." He looked up from gazing at the pup in his arms at his brother.
Cas had kept his eyes glued to the ever-changing emotions on Dean’s face, so he was able to watch as those long, long lashes slowly started to drop, as his alpha’s face came closer with those plump, red-bitten lips aiming for his own. He leaned up the last inch to meet him in the middle with the sweetest kiss that they had so far.
Dean brought his hands down so he could run them down his sides, over his hips, and finally let then come to a rest on his thighs before he slowly, extremely slowly, swung his body down to sit on Cas' lap. Grabbing ahold of his knees he opened and closed his legs a few times loving the feel of Cas' thighs under him. He turned to look over his shoulder at the Omega to see him biting his bottom lip while watching Dean's back.
He pointed his tongue, prodding just inside to tease his omega. Slowly, he pushed in and out and gloried in the loud moan he elicited. His tongue kept stretching him open and driving his omega crazy.
The idiot in front of him was laughing.
As she took a deep pull of her beer, she told him what Cas had muttered out between bites of food. He had fallen near a lake in California, and it had taken some time to find someone to help him get on his way to the bunker. He had some issues with some alphas harassing him, but thankfully, an older alpha ran them off before they caught him. The man had offered to help Cas, but when he pleaded that he had to get home to his alpha, the older man kindly put him in a cab, which took him to the edge of town. Then he had walked the rest of the way to the bunker.
“Don’t apologize. I wish I was there now, to take care of you.”
Relentlessly, Dean brushed his fingers over that perfect spot, which caused Cas to cry out while frantically pushing back on his fingers then pushing forward to grind his cock on him. Damn, he was a lucky alpha. Driving his omega crazy was doing things to him, awesome fucking things. His cock had never been harder and all he could hear in his mind was
“No luck getting some shut eye?”
His knot was ready to lock in—“
He risked a peek at the prince, who was squinting his eyes at the alpha in question. The few glimpses he had allowed himself of the man in front of him thrilled him to his toes. He was beautiful. The combination of his brilliant blue eyes, chiseled jaw and tall physique left him squirming. Mentally. Because omegas didn't fidget.
Cas was working with Hannah to pack Emmie’s puppybag, making sure to grab plenty of pacifiers while she folded some sleepers. He looked over his shoulder to watch his mate rocking their pup to sleep. Emmie was snuggled into his neck like she did to Cas. She would usually throw a fit if anyone else held her that way. She was secure in the arms of her Daddy and she knew it.
He watched as the five alphas turned as one, and knew the Winchester brothers had arrived. Cas saw Sam jump out of the car, and chase the two that ran. The Impala stopped just inches from crashing into the remaining three, and as Dean stepped out, he wished that Charlie had left the sound hooked up on the cameras. Regardless, he would watch every move his alpha made. He could already feel his slick leaking in anticipation.
"Worse than you dying? Not sure what that could be, little brother."
Walking down the stairs, he caught sight of the shirt and lifted it to his nose, and let off a growl at the scent of the omega’s slick. He lifted his head to scent the air, trying to determine which way his mate had gone. Dropping the garment, he continued down the hall, towards the bedrooms and took a minute to stop at his own doorway.
“Interesting. What do you expect from him?”
“Yes. She is our pup. There can be no other claim on her.”
“Fuck! No, just want to remember what you enjoy. I want to make you feel good, too.”
And today was the day (hence, The Mood) that the omegas and their guardians arrived. All omegas attending the impending meet came the day before and stayed overnight, giving them time to rest and prepare for the afternoon Meet. The alphas would only be allowed on the property when all was ready to begin. The guards from the court were a great help in this regard, because the young royal only kept a minimum number of guards at his estate. Nobody was stupid enough to attack a brother of the king, and Castiel had been given one of the most impregnable castles in the country. It was generally well-known that he was the king's favorite sibling.
"While I think you will make someone an amazing Alpha, you are not mine and I am not your Omega. I fear that if we try to fool the Angels the consequences will be worse..."
“He really was a smart, old man.”
Sam knew from studying his history that it was quite common for alpha brothers to be Truemates with human, omega siblings. So it’s logical that he could be mates with his brother’s omega’s brother. Sam shook his head at the knots his thoughts had become. He was just going to stop thinking, stand here and watch Gabriel eat candy until it was time to get Dean.
kinds of stupid.
“Immensely, thank you.”
“Dean, damn. You smell so good.”
“Normally Sammy lives in his nest, which is just over the mountain back there.” He was pointing to a large, beautiful mountain he could see through the doors. “But while he’s gonna watch our girl here with Gabriel, they’re gonna stay in the guest room, there....see the lights?” He was pointing to a small, almost shed-sized, building just at the edge of the yard.
“We just gotta change then we’ll hit the road. It's about twenty-eight hours if we just trade off without stopping. Is that...is Cas crying?”
“So, my soul says “property of Castiel?” When he saw the blush bloom across his mate’s cheeks he melted (What? He was in love dammit). “I’m good with that.”
“Well, when I go through a rut it goes down in about 15 minutes. Now, however, I don’t know how long it’ll take. I’ve never knotted anyone before.”
The first time he got drunk, it was with Bal. The first time he drove, at thirteen, was with Bal. The first time he skipped school was with Bal. That day was also the first time Cas realized that he wanted an Alpha. Bal had taken him to a store in Lebanon which was about four hours away. It was a book store that also sold Star Wars memorabilia and they had a mint condition Boba Fett action figure that he needed, needed he said, for his collection.
!” while holding Dean's head in his hands and gyrating backwards. His alpha was driving him crazy.
"Keep talking, Dean and it'll be the only huge thing I have in my mouth today." Dean nodded quickly that he'd be good before turning his attention back to his pup who now had plum purple hair. Crap.
He stood in front of the sliding glass doors, looking outside when Emmie began laughing at something (Dean) behind him. Cas gave her a sip of his drink before letting Dean take his weight as he rested with his back against his chest.
“No need, Dean. This, us, is very new. I can’t say that if I had woken up alone, that I wouldn’t have thought that I dreamt you, surrounded by the scent of alpha that’s haunted me since I first caught your scent.”
“Come on, it’s time to go get in line to see Michael.”
Also I am so sorry it's taken so long to update.
“We’ll take care of each other, yeah?”
Thanks to Roo for the sassy bit at the end.
“Sweetheart, it’s alright. Can you feel that?” Dean thrust up tight letting Cas feel how hard he still was, buried inside him.
Dean heard the laughter in his brother’s tone and wanted to look so badly, but just as he was about to chance a glance, he saw two pairs of feet stop in front of him.
It broke the solemn moment of Michael's speech, causing them all to begin laughing. His Blondie-Girl didn't know why everyone was laughing, but she giggled while still trying to get to her brother. Michael gave him CJ back, so Dean turned slightly so that Emmie could look him over as he snoozed away. He wrapped his other arm around his mate, gently combing his fingers along the top of his wings.
Prince Castiel tapped his fingers on his knee. He was silent for a moment and then he quietly asked, “Were you hoping he would be here? Do you wish for him to claim you?”
He found himself being held against the wall by his shoulders with his feet dangling in the air. He was quite impressed with his brother’s strength.
Dean had been crying for hours being so overcome with love and relief. It had taken almost four hours after Cas' water broke for their son to be born, and he was worth every minute of pain, so his omega told him. He was sitting on the sectional in their living room as Michael was teaching Cas to hold the weight of his wings after he had healed him from childbirth. Dean thought (and said
"Cassie, come on! You're going to be there, so there's no reason for me to get up at 4 fucking a.m.! Let me sleep."
Finally (it was only minutes, but his omega was in heat waiting for him!), he saw the water run clear. He turned it off and shook himself dry before putting on his emergency boxer-briefs from the trunk. As he walked back around the corner, he was just in time to see Charlie come out the door with four duffels, two laptops and a box of food that she was pushing on the ground with her foot. She was always an awesome multitasker.
They took their time savoring the subtle flavor of honey and peaches. He stood and hugged Balt one last time.
"You are spinning in circles sniffing the air! You look quite mad, darling."
A servant brought the heavily sweating prince some water. He drank down the first glass, then waited while it was filled again.
We can make it, we can make it by
“Castiel, if you accept Dean as your alpha, place your hand on his shoulder.”
“H...how would you do that, Alpha?” It took everything in him not to moan when Cas placed one hand on his shoulder and the other on his chest. Now was time for talking and reassuring his mate, they would get to the moaning stuff soon enough.
He heard the bedroom door open, so he rolled over and sat on the edge of the bed. Cas was very happy to lay his head on her shoulder when the tiny dynamo hugged him.
"What is it, Bal?"
Bullseye. The omega's eyes flashed up for a moment, and the alpha caught a glimpse of a dimple. Oh, gods. He had dimples, too?
He watched as omegas and betas called out to his alpha. They wanted Dean's attention, but his eyes were locked on Cas. He could feel the heat and the weight of his alpha's desire and, honestly, affection. Dean's eyes were looking at him like he couldn't decide if he wanted to cuddle with Cas or eat him alive. He planned on making sure both happened, and soon.
He began shaking with sobs as he realized that he didn’t have to fear that his pup could be ripped from his arms at any moment, had the alpha decided to claim her. She would never have to be near that animal.
“I can smell those apple pies they were baking yesterday, but I didn't see them on the table…and believe me, I looked. Apple pie is my favorite thing to eat.” He squinted his eyes when Charlie laughed at him.
, he would bring his omega pleasure.
“Come on, Alpha. Let's go inside.”
"Yeah. Crazy is a good word for the whole damn situation, Cas."
He ran his hands up the outside of Cas’ thighs, massaging them firmly, which caused the omega to push his ass up, trying to get Dean where he wanted him. The alpha just winked at him and whispered “patience” as he took one cheek in each of his hands to squeeze and separate them so he could see the hole that was leaking Dean’s new addiction.
“Fuck! You know I do, Omega.” He whimpered when Dean started stroking that large,  alpha cock.
How long I'll love you
“I know, I just told you—”
Sam told his brother everything that he knew about his omega’s situation while he straightened Dean’s robes. He really hadn’t appreciated how much Dean’s life was about to change. When an alpha angel mated, it was common enough for the couple to spend several weeks in their nest away from everyone. Sam would miss his brother, since he was used to speaking to him several times a day.
“Look at you, fuck. Cas, you look so good sitting on me, but I really want to taste you. Can I, can I taste you?”
“Charlie, damn.”
“Thank you, Mary.”
“No, he’s not. They blamed me for being out at dusk alone. Said I provoked him by wearing an open collar shirt. He's free and clear, but at least he has never tried to see Emmie.”
He had lowered his eyes and nodded. “Capice.” Then he looked back up and smiled. “I love you, Omega. Come on, it’s almost time for check out, let’s get dressed and get this over with.”
“Of course, Dean. Yours, just as you are mine.”
Sorry for the delay, life n health got screwy.
“Can I call Dean again, please? I hate to be a bother, but it made me feel so much better,” he pleaded.
The alpha interrupted his thoughts. “Dean, whatever you tell me, I will keep in the strictest confidence. Do not be afraid.”
“Sam, you may call me Sam.”
“Of course.”
“I thought for sure someone would give chase, because he had grabbed me from a crowded street, but no. I won’t tell you any of the details of the assault, except that it wasn’t one time and when he was done with me, he took me back to the same spot from where he grabbed me and threw me in the street, naked, like I was trash.” He had stopped crying but he couldn’t seem to stop shaking.
“Castiel,” he smiled, “you will
“Yeah, it’s not happening, Sammy. Hey, can I ask you something?”
“Your amazing son has claimed us. He claimed an unrelated pup and a single omega who had a pup outside of mating. Many in our hometown wanted to sentence her to death when the alpha who assaulted me didn’t claim us. I did not want to be claimed by him, and I truly would have killed him if he tried to claim her, but the rest...”
Cas took a few minutes alone (with his Gatorade and Emmie, of course) to walk through the cottage. His alpha had done a wonderful job making a nest with which any omega would be thrilled. In the living room there was a large sectional (lots of pillows and blankets too) across from the biggest television he had ever seen, and Gabe was asking Dean where he could get one for himself. He decided to follow his nose to the main nest (he could smell his alpha’s scent coming down the hallway so strongly), what with his heat starting and all.
<3Roo
<3 to the QueenMaire.
"Listen, I'm making a change to this number. One I'm sure everyone involved will be happy with."
Dean could hear the voices calling his name, but his alpha was locked onto his mate. Cas was the only thing he could see as he stalked towards him. He hadn’t let his inner alpha off the leash for a while. Last time was when a jealous husband jumped him outside a club they were dancing at about a year ago. Dean wasn’t even the one that had danced for her, but the other alpha didn’t care. He was drunk, pissed, and Dean was the one who came through the door. He wished the alpha had given him more of a fight. Oh, well.
“Oh, Sweetheart. Don’t be cryin’, now. I’m on my way, as fast as I can.” Dean made his voice as soft as he could.
Just as he went to reach for her, Michael released his hold on her as he whispered “Fly, little one.” and Emmie launched herself at her alpha Daddy who caught her with ease. She had wings! Their pup had the most fluffy-white wings. Oh, my word, he thought to himself. She was just precious.
"I'm sorry about that, I am. He has to catch a plane tomorrow to arrive on his next job on time. I'm glad that you two are going out tonight. Have you decided where you are going? Make sure he doesn't want to do anything too crazy. You aren’t like him, dear."
“Cas, yeah, Babe. I ...uh....OK, so a few years ago the furniture store by our place was having an amazing sale so I bought a nesting bed. I’ve never slept in it. I put it in the master bedroom and I sleep in the spare room. I wanted to find you so desperately I couldn’t bring myself to sleep in such a bed by myself.” He couldn’t look at Cas but he knew his mate could smell his embarrassment.
“Hello, Dean. I want you here so badly.” He hated that he started crying all over again, just from hearing Dean’s voice.
“Cas?!?” He saw his sister run in the nursery to check on him. He shook his head at her before handing Emmie to her. Poor pup was without a diaper, but he needed...his alpha. He needed his alpha. He walked up and wrapped his arms around the angel and buried his face in his chest and let out all his fears of what could have happened.
“What’s up, Cassie?” Gabe gave him his ‘I’m so innocent’ look.
Dean rumbled back in pure happiness. His alpha puffed to hear his omega’s purr. “I love you too, Sweetheart. That’s something I've never found easy to say, but I’ll spend my life making sure you know just how much I love you.” To make his mate more comfortable, Dean rolled them over so he was on the bottom.
"Thanks, Sammy. I just want to, well, to be good enough. You know that Dad was disappointed when word came down that I would be a Virtue after I become mated. He wanted me to be a Seraph or he really hoped I would be like our original sire Michael and become an Archangel."
He climbed on the bed between Cas’ legs (watching the omega spread them for him caused a feral growl to burst out), blue eyes still locked on Dean’s hand stroking his cock. He trailed his fingertips up his calf before bending down to place kisses on the back of his knees. Moving up just a few inches, Dean got the first taste of Cas’ slick. Glorious. He knew his angel would taste like heaven.
Thanks for following this story, I'm so in love with these adorable dorks so there is plenty more coming for them but be patient, please.
He looked around and spotted some pictures of Cas on the entertainment center, so he walked over for a closer look. He smiled at his pretty mate in the high school graduation picture where Cas was giving his big,  gummy smile and there was laughter in his eyes. He picked up a frame that held three small pictures. The first was of Cas’ dad holding a young Bal in one arm while he held a sign that said “Pup #2 on the way” with an arrow pointing down towards his belly. The second picture showed his Dad heavy in his pregnancy with his mom and Bal kissing his belly.
century of existence she had only called him handsome.
Charlie smiled at him. “I can sew my own clothes, but I never learned to do the fancy stuff. We have a few in the castle that can…”
“Thanks. Um...another thing. I’ve never uh...been with an omega during their heat before.”
"Oh, Dean. You look so handsome."
“You have to wait for the ceremony to start, Dean. I also have one last thing to ask you. Promise me that whatever is stressing your mate and his brother, you’ll let me help you. I got your back. Alright?”
He never had to worry about Zachariah again.
"Yeah, I'm more than ready. I hope that my Omega is here today. I don't think I could take it if I had to wait another century or so for the next ceremony."
“He doesn’t want to see his ‘soldiers’ be happy. John hasn’t been happy in years, not since his parents were lost in the war. He envisioned that Dean or Sam would help avenge them. He has never been concerned for
Dean hated the uncertainty and anxiousness on Cas’ face. He stepped forward and placed his hands on the omega’s face, cradling him gently. He whispered that Cas was perfect just the way he was, before he claimed his mouth. He moaned as their lips slid together. The omega’s lips tasted like ambrosia. He was addicted already.
“Exactly how would you ‘help,’ Dean?”
“Why are you so nervous, Cas?” he asked while securing his hands on the man’s hips. “I won’t do anything you don’t want, I will never hurt you, Omega. You know that, right?”
I had marked this story at ending at chapter 3, but as I usually do I am now not sure how long this is gonna be because apparently the idjits are in control and not me.
“Yeah. I made our nest really nice. I hope you like it. If there’s something you want different well, just tell me! I want our nest to be your home. Yours and Emmie’s.”
bite of french toast in your mouth." He smiled innocently at Cas when he glared at him.
"You wanted to go into business with me, partner, so get up and help me get ready to open the bakery!!"
He couldn’t think of anything but Dean, so it only took a few strokes before he came all over the bed, again. Time to clean up and take another blanket off the bed.
"Come on, Sammy, let's go play!" Pulling his sputtering brother along, Dean moved them towards his pup and Sammy's future mate.
“No, not at all. I just...I think we should continue this somewhere more private than the parking lot. I have already heard some growls coming from patrons that want you.”
Cas reached out to take his hand as they walked up the sidewalk, towards the door that was already opening. Son of a bitch...here we go.
“I was attacked by a demon?!? What about Emmie?” Cas hated the weak way that he sounded when he asked about their pup.
Today they were leaving for the Alpha Omega Meet and he wasn’t sure how he felt about it. On the one hand, if he was chosen, he wouldn't be given to that old, fat and balding Lord Zachariah. But on the other…what kind of alpha would claim him? Maybe they'd be even worse. But…maybe they'd be better.
A voice interrupted his pup communion. “What are you smiling at so sweetly, Dean?”
He rolled his eyes. “No, jerk. He's always been yours, so you gonna step up, now?” Sam put a hand on his shoulder. “Stop worrying about whatever the hell you’re worrying about. You’ve loved him for years.”
"Here, let's have some tea with the cookies I made for you. I also brought you some of your favorite cinnamon rolls for you to have for breakfast tomorrow with your Omega. While we go to the ceremony, Sam will stock your home for your upcoming rut."
“What?!? I didn’t touch him, like ewww. I just imparted some knowledge on how to stroke one out. He uh…"
“Gabriel.” He forced him to let go so he could hug his brother. “I promise you, I am happy. Please take good care of Emmie. Also, until I find out more, I need you to make sure that John Winchester stays far away from her and from you.”
Green eyes got lost in blue. The heavenly aroma of Cas' slick hit his nose, then it soaked his legs. Dear Chuck, he didn’t think his cock had ever been harder in his life! He needed to be buried in his mate now (and his inner alpha agreed if the rumbles from his chest were anything to go by).
Dean came off stage and wiped off the sweat. He was going to have to take a quick shower before going back out to the crowd. It was damn hot in here and he suspected that Crowley, who owned the place, did it on purpose to make sure the audience was rowdy. Fuck, give him air conditioning. He could rile up the audience by himself. He had been dancing for seven years, and he knew how to please a crowd while making the money he needed.
Cas would be turning twenty-one at midnight, just before they would arrive at the club. He had no interest in going to just any club and he wasn't going out to get drunk. If that's what he wanted he just had to go to Bal's room. He had a well stocked mini-bar that he said Cas was welcome to anytime. No, what Cas was looking forward to was this particular club on this particular night.
“Alpha, please.”
“Dean!”
Dean laid his hand on Cas’ cheek gazing into his eyes, letting his own show his mate how much he loved him, respected him, and desired him. Sliding his hand up his jaw, thumbing his earlobe he continued to stare at him til he could feel some of the tension leave the omega’s body and he could even begin to smell the man’s arousal again. Leaning forward he slotted their lips together in a lust filled kiss while at the same time he placed one finger from his other hand on Cas’ forehead.
“Who the fuck are you? I see that bitch hiding behind you. Did he tell you a tale of what the big, bad alpha did to him? Fucking bitch was asking for it and now you’re gonna die.” Oh, yeah. Really ugly.
The prince's smile was the glorious sun. “Shall we retire to our rooms, My Dean?”
Dean whimpered at Cas’ words. He couldn’t wait for everyone to know that they belonged to each other, either. Sure, there had been snark, innuendos, and some people had even asked how long they had been together, but once they left their bites on each other, there would no longer be any question that they were together.
Charlie was actually afraid of the threat in her friend’s voice, but continued. “Dean, it’s not that bad, so calm down and let me finish.”
“She was just telling me that she and Dad had pupped when they mated and she was wondering if we would and I was wondering if you wanted pups?” He watched his omega chew on his bottom lip. He reached and pulled it away from his teeth.
“Awesome,” was the last thing he heard for a while as the rumbles made a lullabye under his cheek.
, Cas, and the best is still to come."
Cas pulled all of Gabriel's blankets and sheets from his bed. He had to admit that Gabriel made himself a nice nest, but not nearly as fluffy as his own. He needed to be cushioned and cocooned with many pillows and throws.
He reared up, yanked Cas' hips to his groin and rubbed his cock over his hole. Teasing over it back and forth, he purred out “I can play dirty, too, Angel.”
“Kiss me, Dean.”
“Omega, do you want to run?” Gods, his voice sounded rough, even to him. He shook with effort of control. There was one last piece of it, and he gave it to his omega.
“Alpha.” He barely heard the whimper from Cas, but he felt it resonate throughout his body, most especially in his cock. He pressed closer to his mate’s body, making sure he could feel every inch of him sliding in the slick between his thighs.
<3Roo
“I’ll lead you, Dean. I'll squeeze your shoulder when we get close. I know I've given you a hard time about how you’ve been acting and I apologize. I just...I just wish that I was chosen to have a mate, too.”
“Because I wasn’t really focused on him. I wonder what Michael is going to do with your mate’s brother.”
His alpha nodded vigorously in approval. “Hell yeah! You didn’t just shower?”
“Then what am I smelling, Charlie? I have a good nose, and I am telling you, that is apple pie!”
He pulls out a chair for Cas to sit down, because Bobby taught him to be a gentleman, but his omega had other ideas. Dean found himself being pushed into the chair and his mate sitting in his lap. Cas put one arm around his neck, and with the other he smacked his brother upside the head.
The alpha gave a gentle squeeze of his hands. “Cas, our pup is ours. She is fine. He is not a demon right now, but he will become a strong one if we don’t stop him. Michael assigned this to us specifically so that you may have closure.”
“Dean!” Dean was startled at the scream Cas let out, and the fact that the omega came again just from the first lick across his rim. Hehehe....this was gonna be fun.
The omega in him really didn't like all the women and men catcalling his mate. Cas tried to tell himself  that the alpha's focus was solely on him, buuuuuut it wouldn't hurt to flirt a bit, now, would it?
family. Just then he felt arms encircle his, and turning he saw it was his mother-in-law who was smiling at Dean and Emmie.
“I don’t want to know what you’ve done, for now, but it’s time for you to take Emmie. My heat is here.” He handed her to Dean to let him say goodbye, as his brother pulled him a bit away from the group.
“No submission, Cas. You are my omega, but you are also my equal. I don’t know if I deserve you, but hell if I'm gonna question this. I've wanted you for too long, Angel.” The alpha's eyes were soft and warm, and he brought his other hand up, cupping his face reverently.
While she drew his night clothes off and shoo'd him to the loo, she replied, “You didn't sleep much these past few nights, Sir. You needed your rest. It's a big day, today.”
“Excuse me? Who or what is a Charlie?”
Sam showed “Cassie” where he was to be and apparently the candy-eater was staying with his brother.
“Huh??”
“Please what, Omega?” He bit his lip and watched his mate begin to slowly hump the mattress.
Dean jerked to attention when he heard his mother calling for him. He took one last look in his mirror, and squaring his shoulders he walked out to find his mom making tea in his kitchen.
Notice that this story has an ending chapter now, we're almost done with this one.
As soon as the car stopped, Dean stepped out to have a bit of privacy to talk to Cas.
“No, Charlie-girl. Not gonna go easy. Sammy, I don’t need a damn gun! I’m gonna rip them apart and listen to their screams as I bathe in their blood.”
Dean helped his mate up and kept his hand in his, as four of them walked through the hall to the exit door on the other side of the room. Once inside the waiting room, Sam led them to a couch outside Michael’s office. Dean sat next to Castiel and was thrilled that his omega leaned over to place his nose in Dean’s neck. He could tell from the ‘happy omega’ scent coming from him that he was taking comfort from Dean’s scent, which meant that Castiel was, in turn, smelling happy, aroused Alpha.
He accepted his mate’s kisses, finally pulling them both up from the love seat before they got carried away and ended up staying another day.
) that you would think they could haven't taken Cas' pain during labor, but what did he know.
"Of course not, I gave my word." He tried to appease the Angel. He didn't know what he had done to make them threaten him, but he had given his word. He would follow them.
"Are you ready for your party tomorrow night, dear?"
Cas sat up and wiped his tears before continuing his story, but he stayed plastered to Dean, snuggled in his arms.
He couldn’t take much more and he needed to feel more drag, so he slowly slid his cock out til just his large head was inside the stretched rim of his mate. Dean looked up into Cas’ blue eyes, threw him a wink and smirked, and slammed back inside.
"You OK, there, Cassie?'
"Fine."
This was their new beginning. It didn’t matter what came at them in the future, they knew they belonged to each other. Forever.
He was satisfied with the sea of nods and agreements of, “Yes, Your Royal Highness.”
He started thrashing his head back and forth with the feeling of Dean popping his head in and out of his rim. Cas, again, was trying to push against Dean to get him deep inside him and as before the alpha refused to let him move by keeping a tight hold on his hips. Only this time he was stroking his hip bones with his thumb, making Cas wonder if everyone’s hip bones were an erogenous zone, ‘cause it was driving his desire through the roof! He couldn’t control the whimper that made its way out of his throat, which brought a deep rumble of laughter from Dean.
He took one last look around at the others before falling into step with Sam. Dean didn’t see his mom and he was becoming worried about her. He would ask Michael as soon as he had a chance.
“You will have your turn, Brother. Michael will see to it when he feels you are ready.”
Throwing his arms around his (marked!) alpha, Dean landed on his back with Cas plastered to his lips in a kiss. He stopped to watch his beautiful Dean as he let out a full belly laugh. The omega swore he would pull that sound from his alpha as often as he could.
“No, is that bad?”
He made sure to wash very thoroughly until the one Angel who seemed to be in charge stepped forward and announced that it was time for them to go.
“I will hunt down that bitch!”
Dean jogged back to the stage and after he collected his tips along with a few phone numbers (that he would throw out), he went to go get changed for his last dance. When he got there, he found himself surrounded by the guys. Benny, Michael, Mitch, and Gabe were facing him with their arms crossed over their chests. They were already in their jeans, boots, and hats for the group dance. He started changing, waiting for one of them to tell him what the hell was wrong, although he knew.
He had never, though, had his alpha want out during sex. Don’t get him wrong, he loved sex. His alpha was just waiting for its mate and now that it’s found him, he’s anxious to knot and mate his omega.
Cas stood to follow Dean while speaking to his brother. He held his hand out, and immediately the Alpha was pulling him to his chest. Fuck. The Alpha was still shirtless. He wanted to rub himself all over it. He needed to rub himself all over his Alpha. He should smell like Cas and Cas should smell like his Alpha.
“Yes, Dean. I’m just worried that I can’t make this good for you. I don’t have any experience, other than what I've done for myself.”
"How about I bring breakfast in bed for the three of us after I change a
It had helped when he was able to talk to Dean, a few hours ago. Maybe Charlie would let him call his alpha again.
"Are you ready for today?"
“Charlie!” He rubbed his hand on the back of his neck.
Dean fell to his knees.
“Michael.”
“Charlie, listen. When we hang up, I want you to turn off the cameras until either Dean or I call you back.”
"We have time, it's just 2, we have a few hours to run, to hide you, to do something!"
“Cas, go to our room, remove your clothes and wait for me. Please.” He did not use his ‘alpha’ voice on him. He made it a request. He respected Cas and he wanted to show him that.
“Charlie? Charlie!?!”
An older woman he assumed was Cas' mom stood in the open doorway and smiled with curiosity. “Cassie! Who’s this and where is your brother?”
“Oh, it’s gonna take lot more than that handsome.” Gabriel winks at him and takes the drinks. Dean watches him fade into the dim light of the Roadhouse. He searches for that crow’s nest. Half convinces himself that Cas’ eyes might flare in the dark like a cat. A customer barks an order at him, and he falls back into work hoping that Cas will come to the bar to take the next order.
He just can’t shake what happened at the bakery that morning. Gabriel’s hands in Cas’ hair, calling him angel and Cas not even flinching, if anything looking like he enjoyed it. The pink on his ears flaring up and the stupid smile on his face in the kitchen when he mentioned how Gabriel makes him eat everything in the bakery. Dean bets Gabriel makes Cas eat plenty alright. To hell with Gabriel and his delicious baked goods. And to hell with Cas and his, whatever he was doing with Dean.
He was out. He was here, back in his cell, back with the Russian and he couldn’t really fathom it. This was a joke. It had to be. This was just Shurley playing his puppet mastery and he’d take Dean away or Dean would wake up and be back in the Empty, that he never really left. The warmth around him wasn’t real, the dry ground under him was just his mind playing tricks on him. They had played enough on him during his time in the Empty.
“We didn’t specify a time.” Castiel replies groggily running a hand through his sleepy head. He woke up ten minutes ago. Dean scoffs.
Cas climbed up Dean’s body, his eyes closed, mouth slack and bliss covered his face. Cas brushed his nose against Dean's. A tiny hum vibrated from his friend's throat. He looked peaceful and Cas didn’t want to disturb him any longer. He made quick work with the cloth, taking some of the lube off of Dean and then manhandled Dean’s tired body under the covers.
“Any girls catching your eye this year?” his Mom asked. Dean nearly spat out his drink, careful to swallow and not choke too hard at the question. He ignored any looks towards Cas as he shook his head.
“Right,” he clapped his hands together “How you wanna do this director?”
“Daddy.” Charlie’s sad tone came in from behind him. Riot perked up hearing her voice.
“It’s always good.” Dean admitted, a little breathless. His eyes widened at his admittance, he opened his mouth like he was about to back track when Cas pressed his thumb into the slit of Dean’s cock and all that came out was a desperate whine.
“You are aware of what we get up to. You watch the videos.”
“What was that Winchester?”
Balthazar nodded. The others did too. Cas turned his head round and saw Dean peering out of his cell. He forgot to re-adjust his hair, probably a mess from Cas’ hands. The Russian sighed, moved past his men and descended to the ground floor of the block. Dean stood over the railing to see what he was doing, where he was going. If he was going to Sam’s cell.
Yeah. He liked it.
His finger stroked inside of Dean, a spot he had yet to explore making Dean see stars behind his eyelids. His hand dropped, head hitting the pillow as he took in what Dean could only assume was Cas hitting his prostate over and over. Dean’s legs started to shake from the onslaught, and something told him Cas was only getting started.
“Today, after school.” He said with conviction. Cas wondered how long it took him to come up to him, how many times he replied the moment in his head till he got the courage to come up to Cas to inform him he’d fuck him today.
Dean couldn’t help the scoff, smiling too. “Pfft, like you haven’t known for months.”
He wanted Cas.
He walked down to his kitchen, noticing that it was in fact snowing out the window. It must have come down hard during the night. The sheath of white on the ground untouched and thick. He wondered if the kids had school, if he had work.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I seem to have upset him and would like some advice on how to rectify it.” He admits. Jessica smiles at that. It puts Castiel on edge. He didn’t like crossing over professional boundaries. He likes his students as they are, students. The gap between them keeps Castiel focused on their work, not on their persons. He only wants to know them through their stories.
“Then go,” Cas replied, pulling the collar of Dean’s jacket down to get at a piece of skin he hadn’t become friendly with yet. “The doors behind you.”
He turned his head into Dean’s palm, kissed it sweet. Kisses he had been getting through-out the day whenever Cas felt like giving them. “You are, now sleep.”
Then nothing happened. Nothing till Dean sighed audibly and commented, “I can’t do this.”
“Coming out is personal,” Cas touched Dean’s face, “I would never force you to do something you didn’t want to, as long as I get to enjoy you behind closed doors I can wait for a while.”
Cas didn’t go down that road. He got dressed behind Dean and Dean didn’t sneak a look. Unfortunately. Cas lay down on his bed.
“I am content hiding for the time being, if I require anything more, I will ask.” Gabriel goes back to the front. His friends floured hand leaves a mark on his knee. He would be lost without him, so he leaves it there enjoying the symbolism of it.
The noticeable pause coming from Cas makes Dean think he shouldn’t have asked. He had been slow, biding his time for Cas to feel ready to kiss him and it never came. Stealing his phone in part was to put his number in, in part to make Cas get close to Dean, closer than hand holding. The hand holding, it’s nice, sweet but Dean wants more. Wants those blue eyes darkening and that attention to come back, like Cas is trying to sear through Dean’s clothes and see what’s underneath. It had been all sunshine and rainbows on their date. He can only do sunshine and rainbows for so long.
“You go, I’ll put this in the oven.” Cas returned to the brownie mix.
“Let go Dean, I know you want to,” Cas whispered. “I can feel you’re close.”
“I’m nobody’s prag.” Dean spat out.
Right, the pie, the guilt, the apology. He shakes his head regaining himself.
Cas’ tilted his head. “What do you mean?”
Another gulp.
Castiel gets up to fetch the pie. He debates getting plates but settles for eating it like him and Gabriel do, two forks out of the pie dish. Dean approves. They scoot in closer to together facing each other with the whole pie between them. Their knees touch.
The wave calmed down. He leaned his head on his elbow, trying to take some deep breathes before more came up. A glass of water appeared in his view.
did he ruin it.  That part of his brain had been asleep and now it was awake and alert and hungry, so damn hungry for more of it, more of Cas.
“I was leaving his place this morning and we kinda had this…moment I guess where I admitted I had feelings for him, and he kinda agreed.”
“You want me to eh…” Dean pointed at the erection.
Now with the anointing over Charlie and Claire ran down the garden to the tree house, Cas hung back with Dean on the deck finally letting their laughter out.
And with that Cas tumbled into oblivion. “Oh God,” his hips started to stutter as he spent himself into Dean’s ass. Orgasm strong enough to curl his spine. “Oh fuck.”
“I am,” Cas admitted. “So, say whatever you need to and leave me alone please.”
“Yes.” Is all he gets in return, completely lacking in any enthusiasm. Does this guy know any other tone other than mono? The guy walks over to the lift, Dean follows because well he was going that way anyway. They live on the same floor.
“Oh okay,” he failed at hiding the dumb look on his face. He was totally elated that Cas had said that and his smile gave it away. He recomposed himself after a second or two, he could totally get lost at sea in those eyes of Cas’. “I actually came looking for a cup of coffee.”
He did. Sam ringing him up in the middle of the night, telling him he’d just ran over a dog. Dean had been more concerned about the state of Baby than the animal that his brother hit. The following days Sam had been going to check up on the dog, though Dean soon coped on that he was also checking up on the hot vet that was in there.
When he’s sure Dean is asleep, he slips out of the apartment and back into his.
“I will read you one another story I’ve written.” He replies. Dean seems content with that. They eat in silence. It gives Castiel time to think which of his stories he wants Dean to hear, what part of who he is does he want Dean to know about through his words.
And it was at least once a day, sometimes twice depending on if Cas was in their cell during their day time lock up. The reason why he was missing count was still ongoing, but he was always back in the night time for some hands-on time with Dean. Hands-on time Dean spent most of the day looking forward to. He was gone on his celly, so pathetically gone on him and it was getting increasingly harder to keep this straight guy gig up.
“Language Cas.” Dean’s smile smears onto Castiel’s chest. He wants it imprinted there. He needs his mouth back though, grabs Dean’s head to bring him back to him, wiping that smile off of his face as he delves his tongue into Dean’s mouth needing to taste him, needing Dean to silence him from words he shouldn’t say. Dean distracts him, pushes his lower body into Castiel’s feeling that friction on his erection. It’s a bit rough but it’s not enough. He needs more.
"Hot.” Meg noted, standing beside them with a devious smirk on her face.
He was surprised about Dean’s knowledge on it. He hadn’t thought Dean had much going on in his mind aside from girls and cars. Perhaps he had judged Dean too soon. It seemed Dean was more than meets the eye.
“God you’re so fucking hot Cas.”
“So, when did he call you Daddy?”
I'm thinking two more chapters? And maybe some smutty time stamps but we're near the end on this one x
Castiel checks his post after work. It’s been a good day, lectures were good, seminars were good, even Naomi wasn’t as painful as she usually could be and he’s on top of his work load for once this semester. He’s looking forward to getting back to his mid-week routine of a book and laundry.
“Here’s hoping for a quiet night eh?” Dean lifted his beer to his brother.
Zachariah came up to him, expecting an interrogation as to where Cas was, a snide comment or a jibe at his physical appearance Dean was ready for whatever the guard threw at him. He wasn’t expecting though for Zachariah to click twice, as if Cas was standing beside him and just walking on to the next cell.
Then Cas answered. He stepped into the circle.
Dean stays awake this time.
“Drop it Sam.” He snapped.
“There is more editing than usual.” Cas answered.
Dean pulled back to get a look at Cas’ face. It was less sad. “I’m sure we’ll come to blows one way or another. I’m stubborn and you aint no angel.”
“It’s ok,” Cas whispered. “I’ve got you.”
“Trust me Sammy, I’ve been dropping it.”
“When I came back here, after years of running away from this place I made a promise to myself to not look back, only forwards. Leave the bad where it belongs, only take the good.”
That thought made Dean groan, stomach clenching like it did multiple times in the video. He could see the moment he let go, one of his fists come into view to take hold of the bedding and he started fucking up into Cas’ fist.
“C’mon Cas.” He moved one on his hands back to get a hold of Cas’ cock, already wrapped up and ready to go. Cas responded to the touch by pushing Dean further into the bedframe. It made him smile knowing he was just as responsive to his touch. “Get this inside of me.”
Dean nodded. It was better, much better. The breath came, the stretch was there, the pain was the right amount and fucking hell Cas had his cock in Dean’s ass. This was happening, this was not a dream or a fantasy. This was real life and freakin’ awesome.
It wasn’t Cas he had to look out for, Claire full on body tackled him, making him fall back into the snow. “I got him! I got him!” she called out pressing him into the snow. Next his daughter came, jumping onto him too making him cry out in pretend agony. The two girls had him pinned and then Cas stood up over him, blocking out the light. He could see a ball of snow in his gloved hand, smile as wicked as his daughter’s.
She hadn’t even said goodbye to him, too engrossed in what looked like the Tran kid’s bag pack. There were Power Rangers on it, Dean couldn’t blame her. He was about to make the walk back through the park when one of the head teachers spotted him. Crap.
Bobby nodded. “Uriel never had that kind of sway in here.”
He wanted to ask how Dean knew that Cas wasn’t one for paying attention but that would open up a conversation he wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to have. They needed to stay on track, no digressions. That didn’t mean Cas couldn’t get his own back at the slight dig. He refused to let Dean think he could get one over on him.
He took the lead, guiding Cas’ cock to his hole, holding onto it as Cas pressed in slowly. They were both looking down as it slid in without much traction, watched as it disappeared inside of Dean and fuck Cas was inside of him. He could feel the stretch more and Dean let go, scrambling to get a hold of Cas, fingers digging into the meat on his shoulder blades as he felt Cas bottom out.
He licked his lips once, gulping back the lump in his throat as he answered,
Dean’s breathe got stuck in his throat. Holy crap. He killed Gordon. He killed Gordon for Dean, for what he did to him. Cas didn’t even wait, didn’t even skip a beat, in the space of a few hours since he cleansed Dean, he gutted Gordon. The man who almost raped and killed Dean, who had been out for Dean’s blood for such a long time that it shook Dean to his core. He was gone. Cas killed him for what he did to Dean.
Dean brought him close to the edge. He felt his orgasm being carved out. Hand crafted by his friend. Cas started to pull Dean’s mouth away. “I’m close.” He mumbled, not trusting himself to not say his friend’s name. “You need to—”
Dean let out a burst of unexpected laughter. Cas used a variety of animals instead of swearing words to describe people who got on his nerves. It was imaginative and another reason Dean found himself completely hooked on the guy. Cas smiled quietly at Dean and it warmed his insides.
Dean shook his head. “No, he said it in English.”
“Shame, guess we’ll have to keep those dirty little secrets to ourselves then.” Balthazar adds to the taunting. Damn, now Dean really wants to know. Cas’ drink is half gone already. What could his neighbor be hiding? Secretly a vampire? A murderer? The actual angel from his story?
“Use your words, what do you want?”
That was almost two weeks ago. 12 days to be exact. Yes, he had counted.
With that hanging threat Gabriel joined the brothers, jamming his lollipop back into his mouth and leaving the others with a decision to make.
“I’m sure Claire would love to have her best friend for a sleep over too,” Cas offered. “You might need the whole night to get your memory back if it’s been a while.” A smile made its way onto his face. Dean scoffed at that suggestive tone.
Dean’s arm went around Cas’ middle and his breath got caught in his throat when he felt Dean’s lips on the shell of his ear again. “Yeah but not as much fun though, right Cas?”
Half an hour later he’s showered, dressed, caffeinated and slightly nervous. Just awake Castiel didn’t have much registration of what was going on around him, his emotions and thoughts don’t fully kick in till he’s showered and caffeinated. Now that he is, it’s hitting him. He’s about to go on a date with Dean. Dean who likes him.
“I wouldn’t exactly call them the ‘good ole’ days.” He replied solemnly.
He never had Cas down as being a particularly funny character, perhaps talking to Dean in English removed that part of his personality. Cas had great English, fluent as far as Dean could tell, some metaphors and idioms were lost on him and sarcasm, he wasn’t that great with either.
“Every day those dickheads will see that name and regret telling me I was good for nothing.” Castiel remembers Gabriel saying when he decided on the name. Gabriel could bake just about anything that had sugar in it. The lack of sweet things in the orphanage meant Gabriel had years of making up to do. His insatiable sweet tooth now earned him a living as proud owner of the best bakery in town.
Cas put his hand back, gentle, barely a hint of a touch rubbing up and down Dean’s pink, aching shaft. He looked down at it as he spoke, “I’m going to edge you for as long as I see fit, no cumming until I say, do you understand Dean?”
Cas grimaced at that name, like a bad taste in his mouth. “Not a fan?”
“And he just said he’d leave you alone? Just like that?” Bobby questioned. He knew Bobby from the outside, good friend of their Dad when they were both out of prison at the same time. Bobby wasn’t going to see the outside of this place again. Life without parole he got this time for grand theft auto with a deadly weapon. It’s his third offence. No one messed with him though, he was a vet in here, people respected that in all the gangs. Well, except the AB because they’re bat shit crazy.
All Dean could do was nod, like he knew and that made it even worse, or better he wasn’t sure, being able to differentiate that was becoming impossible. He didn’t want this to end, this moment, whatever this was between them. He wanted Dean, wanted him in his bed, at school, in the back of Dean’s car. The feelings he tried to shove away emerged and took hold as Dean fucked him.
Dean paints a smirk on his face, getting up to pat Cas' shoulder.
A flicker of several emotions flashes across Dean's eyes: regret, guilt, sorrow, rage. The last probably being the Mark's effect. Cas waits for Dean.
Concern and frustration etches itself on the angel's face.
The hunter prefers not to discuss what the angel found out about earlier. Not that he needs Cas' permission to make decisions like these. But it'd be nice to have the support of his . . . best friend. Yeah. His best friend.
Dean looks down and croaked, "You left me. You left me and you didn't give me a chance to say---you mean the world to me. I know I get angry and I push you away. I push everyone away. I don't know many. Maybe it's because I'm afraid of losing people I--losing people I care about. I just keep on losing people. But you. You always come back. Because you know me. Know me better than anyone Cas. Better than I know myself sometimes." Dean sniffles. " And you're so---you're you Cas. And you're so oblivious sometimes. And most of the time you hardly let me finish a god damn sentence. Because if you did you'd know that Cas-," Dean looks up, running his hands through Cas' messy black hair with tears in his eyes, "Castiel, I love you." Dean slides his hand down to Cas' neck as his green eyes greet blue. He whispers, slower this time,  "I love you too."
There was always---if he did this, there would be no going back.
Empty. Air. Instead of Cas.
"Of course, Dean." Minutes pass and Dean's breathing slows until light snoring leaves his mouth. Castiel smiles at the relaxed features on the man's face and whispers, "I love you, Dean Winchester." Dean smiles in his sleep and the angel continues to count the freckles on the Righteous Man's face in the moonlight.
Castiel's blue eyes feel like water to a dying man as he stares into them. Dean can feel the warmth from Cas 3 feet away. His hair is more messy than usual and he smells weirdly of dirt, sweat, and---is that grass? Cas' eyebrows are furrowed and he has a small frown on his face while he looks over Dean, making sure his hunter is ok.
"Yeah." Sam shifts awkwardly trying to contain his relief that Dean could stop mourning off Cas. "I just dropped by to get something---"
." Dean's eyes snap up to meet a concerned stare. He quickly glances away and back to Cas.
Cas paused, "Something I should've done a long time ago." Cas topped the bottle with his grace and turned to face the Empty. "As a good man I know once said, 'think fast.'" Cas tossed the bottle to the fuming figure before crashing to the middle of a green field.
Earth.
"Course. 'M fine, Cas." Dean turns to go back to the bed before Cas grabs his wrist for the second time that night. Except this time Cas didn't need to lift up the sleeve to get through Dean's lies. Dean's eyes are glued to Cas' piercing gaze.
is pain. An aching emptiness in his heart stabbing with such force it brings tears to his eyes. A wave of grief accompanies love. A love that longs and aches with just as much pain as the grief. He can't decide whether the floor is being ripped from under him or if a part of himself is being torn from his very soul. Perhaps it's both. But the feeling is disconnected. A part of him and not--dulled by mere distance.
Suddenly, Dean's arms traps Cas into a hug. Cas' eyes widen in shock, but his body becomes lax when he relaxes and returns the hug. "Thanks, Cas." Dean whispers.
The words echo in Dean's mind as he lies awake on the motel room bed.
Dean is in pain. He needs him. No. Dean doesn't want him. Not after---he doesn't have time to think. He has to act now before the Empty comes. Dean is in pain. That's all that matters. Cas looks down, scouring his pockets for something. Anything. And there. A bottle. A small bottle, but it was something. A tag attached itself to the cork.
"No, you're not." Cas always knows what to say. He could always see past the mask and past the lies. He always calls Dean out on his bullshit. He cares enough to not ignore it most times. Not that Sam didn't care. It was just easier to talk to the angel than his little brother. He had to be strong for Sammy, but Cas. Well, Cas made him feel--finally Dean sighs and Cas loosens his grip on Dean enough to let him slide on the bed again.
"Dean." It's the first time Castiel spoke up in a while. The angel seemed so content to listening to the hunter. Dean could never understand why that was. Castiel's eyes look like sparkling diamonds in the moonlight. Dean's eyes slips to his lips. "
That's all Dean sees as he stares on.
Dean shifts on the right side a bit until, "I'm jus' tired is all." He glances from the pillow to the Mark to the pillow again.
He makes it to the door and moves to open it. His hand hovers over the knob. Dean shivers as he cautiously opens the door.
When Dean entered the armory for the first time since Cas d---since the incident his legs immediately gave out over the vacant spot Cas stood last. His head bent slightly as he sobbed. Everything became distant as soon as the tears fought their way out of his eyes. Dean tilted to the side knocking out one of the beer bottles keeping his company. Every time he tried to leave the room he came back with another beer. Too many bottles to count. Too many failed attempts to care.
The metal door slammed shut behind them. Dean shifted closer to the angel. His angel.
Cas moves to the left side of the bed and sits with his back on the headboard next to Dean. He peers at Dean while Dean looks anywhere but at him. Dean noticed the wrinkles in the blanket and the papers Castiel had shuffled when he wasn't looking. He looks at the clock again. 1:05pm. Finally, he returns Cas' stare. Dean slowly deflated. He opens his mouth and hesitates to ask his next question. "You can lean on me if you feel comfortable." Red rushes to Dean's cheeks as words of defense and 'cut the chick flick moment' makes it to his throat before jamming on the tip of his tongue. Cas looks open as though he's ready and okay with anything Dean has to say. That's what Dean loves about him--he means not loves. Maybe strongly likes. Love is a strong word. Dean strongly likes that Cas never managed to look disgusted and judgmental of what he had to say. Cas always understood even if he didn't
Cas smirks reassuringly, "Hello Dean." Dean launches himself into the angel's warm arms. For a moment, Dean embraces him with closed eyes and a broken smile before he sobs into Cas' shoulder for the first time ever. Cas freezes before wrapping his arms around the hunter too. Dean grasps onto the angel's trenchcoat as though Cas might fade away if he lets go. His cries makes Castiel's heart clench, wishing to take that pain away from his righteous man. After a while, they slide to floor. Dean is practically sitting on Cas' lap and still hanging onto Cas when his sobs silence. Dean's mind aches for him to get off the floor and "stop acting like a damn sissy," but this time is different. This time he knows. He knows Cas loves him back. And Cas didn't know. Cas died thinking---He didn't think he'd have a chance to tell Cas. But now he does.
"How?" Silence hung in the air. Hopelessness lingers on that question.
"What are you doing?" A familiar voice growled from behind him.
Eileen interrupted, "Yeah, but we just realized we don't need it anymore."
"Dean. You not going craz---"
"What's up, Cas?" Dean grumbles, closing the door and sitting on the edge of his bed uneasily.
"Luci---Dean, what are you talking about?"
Cas' eyes hardens into determination and his voice deepens as he responds, "I don't know. I don't know if we'll have to kill Metatron to get the answers or hope for a miracle, but we will. We'll find a way, Dean. I promise." Dean pauses, taking his words in.
After knocking 1, 3, 6, 5 ? too many bottles, Dean successfully shifted his kneeling position and looked up to the ceiling. "Cas?" He called out in a broken voice before clearing his throat, "Cas. I know you can't hear me. I-I wish you could hear me . . . but we did it. We won and . . . and I wish you were here. None of this would have happened without you and . . . I never got to say it back . . ." Dean bowed his head with closed eyelids as his throat went dry. "I'm so sorry I couldn't say it back. I---Castiel." He paused before whispering, "I love you too."
Cas inhales sharply at the admission. Dean leans forward, gently nudging Cas to close the gap between them. There noses brush against each other and---"Cas?"
After his 5th beer and 3rd cup of whiskey, everything goes blank. An aggravating thud pesters at his mind. 'Hang overs are shit,' is the first thing to come to Dean's mind followed by, "Wait. That thudding is not inside my head."
Dean pull his face away from Cas' shoulder. Cas looks at him with a certain love and gentleness. 'ow did I not see it before?' Dean knows he looks like hell. His eyes must be red shadowed by dark eye bags from all the crying and the nightmares. His nose is red and a little runny---there has to be a wet spot on Cas' trenchcoat from the crying and the runny nose. Not to mention he smells like alcohol from his little blackout last night. Still, Cas looks past that. He looks past the wrinkled clothes---sprinkled with little beer stains--and the cheeseburger socks (what they're his comfort socks! Can you blame a guy?!). Cas doesn't crinkle his nose and express any judgement. The angel just sits there with the hunter in his arms waiting patiently with soft eyes. Dean opens his mouth and freezes. He can feel the words piling up in his throat. He looks Castiel in the eyes, his blue ocean eyes, still holding a grip on his coat, and dares to speak: it was his turn to speak his truth.
Cas' demeanor softens, "I was. I'm not anymore." Dean licks his quivering lips and lowers his gun, but his grip on the weapon tightens. "Remember?" The angel continues to step forward until Dean's back hits the railing. Cas' voice deepens, "I'm your huckleberry."
Dean.
Dean's tears threaten to spill again before his face goes serious. "N-no. You're not here. I'm going crazy---"
"Dean, are you okay?" His raspy voice snaps him out of his reverie.
"Are you okay with me leaning on you?" Cas smiles softly and nods. He shifts further down the bed so Dean can properly lay down on him. Dean takes a minute and gently applies his weight onto Cas with his head nestled on Cas' shoulder. Castiel stares at the ceiling while Dean curls around the angel. It feels vulnerable for the hunter, but it gives him more peace than he's received in months. Hell, maybe even years.
"But--" Eileen gave Sam a pointed look. Sam turned away from Eileen towards Dean and Cas with an exasperated bitch face. "Yeah, never mind. I'll see you two tomorrow."
“Enough, Bal. How the pups come to be is my and Dean’s business for now. All you have to know is that Dean has a brother, so you will not necessarily be the ‘favorite’ Uncle.”
Cas was enjoying the walk to their home/nest. It was so beautiful here, so peaceful. The only thing breaking the quiet was Emmie’s quiet giggles as Dean would chuck her chin, or as she peeked over his shoulder to smile at Gabriel and Sam, who were following them so they could take her for the night. Mary was going to watch her tomorrow. He kept wanting to pinch himself to see if he was dreaming, but he knew he couldn’t have dreamt an alpha as wonderful as his.
“Michael did, he just wasn’t expecting Gabe to show up now,” she laughed. When she realized that Emmie wasn’t going to let Cas eat in peace, she motioned for Alfie to come over.
“Yeah?”
When he began sliding into Cas’ body the omega cried out in ecstasy. Almost immediately, he came so hard he actually got cum in his mouth. He hadn’t realized he was so close, but fuck, did it feel amazing.
Dean felt himself breathing quickly and starting to sweat. He also felt his pants getting soaked. The scent of his alpha (all right,
Dean nodded once to his brother as he felt Sam clasp his shoulder with his hand. He literally was his ‘handler’ for the ceremony. He was glad that Michael had chosen Sam, and not his father, when it became apparent that his mom wouldn’t be able to walk him. Dean wouldn’t be able to show his father his nervousness, and he would not have known that his omega was here, for John would not have told him.
"I wanna hold my nephew too!" They all giggled at the pout in Gabriel's voice.
“I know. Come on now, Omega. Don't cry. Charlie said you’re getting dehydrated. I need you to take care of yourself for me til I get to you.”
“Dean, of course I am. Cas is family, man. I’ve known for a long time that you felt so much more for him than just as a ‘brother’. I’m just glad that you’re gonna do what your heart wants, Dean. Seriously.”
His brother shook his head, exasperated. “I can’t believe that you actually spouted that crap. You do know Dad was wrong about stuff, right? Fuck, Dean. An omega doesn’t lose their mind when they are in heat, and they don’t want just any alpha. He wants you because you are his mate. God, I can’t believe you. I never thought my big brother was so sub-gender sexist. I'm actually ashamed of you right now. I'm going out. I'll be back before dark so we can get this shit over and go home.”
