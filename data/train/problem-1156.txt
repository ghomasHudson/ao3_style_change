as well: this production emphasised the role of Puck as a mediator between Titania and Oberon, but somehow in their subsequent performances he had turned into the cause of their jealous argument in the first place. He wasn't sure how it had begun, but with each afternoon's reading Sherlock had pushed Ben onto him like he was egging John on, and the young actor had lapped up the attention, growing more clingy and flirtatious, and John hadn't been able to do anything except step up his own possessiveness and twisted, confused jealousy. He wasn't sure from night to night whether he was jealous of Puck for spending time with his wife or of Titania for trying to corrupt his manservant; wasn't sure how much of his jealousy was friendly or sexual.
He blinks a few times, as though the answer is glaringly obvious. I turn back to the body, scanning it hastily – what could have been in such plain sight that
His heart trips and lands hard on the bottom of his stomach. "It's okay, Sherlock. I told you we were going too fast. We can try again later."
he agreed.
John had always known for his liking of being in charge of his romantic and sexual encounters. It wasn't that he liked bossing people around, just that he liked to know that his partner
"You know, for never having worked with Will before, you certainly know a lot of his work by heart," John commented under the applause of the crowd.
But Sherlock's already on the move, whirling around in search of his phone, thrown aside in disgust earlier. "The horse did," he says distractedly. "Remember the match outside the stable? Straker lit it behind him so he could see the right spot to make the cut, and the horse panicked and kicked him." With a crow of delight, he dives onto the sofa and digs his phone out from where it had fallen between the cushions and rushes out. John watches the magnificent body disappear into the bedroom, still blinking and trying to sort through the cotton wool to find what just happened.
for this morning," he replied emphatically. All he had done was join in with what the detective would have done anyway without him. He could understand how it might be more rewarding with someone as goofily enthusiastic as John had been to accompany him, but the overenthusiastic praise John had provided over the past few days couldn't match the glimpse into Sherlock's theatrical world that he himself had been granted. Sherlock's smile widened until John thought it might be genuine.
John grins and settles himself back against the headboard, plucking his own cup of tea from the tray. A sense of elation seeps gently through him; it appears Sherlock is in a good enough mood to indulge his plans for today. He wasn't being evasive in his earlier assessment; he really doesn't know where they'll go or what they'll do, but he knows he wants to spend the day being John and Sherlock, flatmates and best friends, rather than Sherlock Holmes and the Doctor Watson that helplessly tags along behind him.
." The doctor slid off Sherlock's coat, flicking it carelessly onto the floor. Sherlock's lips tightened instinctively at the gesture.
, Sherlock, surely you know that it's you that I…"

"Actually," Kirsty interjected, "we found them like this. Looking like they'd been dead for years and preserved like this. Whatever it was it can't have taken more than a few
The barking dog was louder here, but so were several of the voices; John hoped that the light everywhere signified that he had left the nightmarish memories behind. The first door that he opened swung inwards onto one of the tiny rooms the cadets of Starfleet Academy were provided, with a younger Sherlock cross-legged on the bed reading a textbook at lightning speed.

She sighed again. "Is Mycroft still here?"
Shakespeare actually smiled. "Don't worry," he said enigmatically. "I have someone in mind."
with him? "But for now, I think you should not be so quick to turn me away. A friend is often nice to have."
John thought it was a bit rich of Sherlock to criticise anyone who liked the sound of their own voice; he glanced at Lestrade with a wry grin and was gratified to see that despite the veil of irritation at the insults to his assistant the Constable was smiling slightly. He wondered how rude it would be if he asked the older man about Donovan; there were a lot of strange things in London in the new century, but the strangely wealthy Constable and his outspoken, mixed-race assistant were one of the strangest he had seen so far.
"Of course not," he said diplomatically, plunging his fork into the depths of his salad again. Bill chuckled.
of Sherlock's life.
like a naïve kid with a stupid crush on a teacher that had somehow managed to come to fruition. Grieg's hands gripped his thighs reassuringly while his own scrabbled at the desk for purchase, trying not to catch a handful of essay that would then have to be explained away when it was handed back.
Sherlock shook himself. "Yes, of course, sorry. The torch just went out for a moment, it's fine now."
John threw his arms wide.
"So do all female parts, according to most people," John countered. He had thought previously that Rosalind would be the perfect part for his newest friend, with her razor-sharp wit and her delight in being more intelligent than everyone else. He agreed that Rosalind was a very young and naive character despite all of that, though. But then Sherlock seemed young to him sometimes.

Sherlock shifted impatiently, but John could still see a tiny proud smile on his face. He nodded again. "We did. However, Mr Miracle, I'm here today to assist the Constable in the investigation into Lady Brackenstall's disappearance."
"John!" Will snapped, clicking his fingers urgently. John quite suddenly remembered how to breathe. "Please calm down. I don't think it's as bad as you think."
I wave my hand airily at her once I'm confident my voice won't sound choked up. "Go ahead."

Jim repeated in a mockingly interested drawl, raising an eyebrow at John.
He stopped sharply and turned towards the voice. He kept himself to himself at Cuxton, and while he knew people talked about the way he knew more about his subjects than the teachers did and the way he had no friends, no-one ever dared to say anything to his face; the people who had tried at first soon found out that Sherlock could more than make life unpleasant for them if he wanted.
Lestrade rushed after him; John hurried to keep up with his shouted response. "I think the butler was the closest thing - he's in the drawing room, but they're in the middle of cleaning it -"
I still haven't forgiven you for, by the way."
Sherlock snorted, taking the bait; the argument around the adage was an old one between them. The rattling from outside quieted slightly. "John, you are aware that your medical qualifications do not automatically make you more trustworthy," he said for the umpteenth time.
Will smiled softly. "You see people differently," he said, fondness creeping through his voice. "You don't judge people by the things that normal society does - you look at Sherlock and I and you see genius, where most other people just saw
"It doesn't bode well for either Lady," John finished for him.
There was an indistinct murmur from the other side of the door as he rapped on it; taking that as consent, Sherlock opened it and moved through into the doctor's bedroom, averting his eyes just in case John was doing something he wouldn't want Sherlock to see – it wouldn't be the first time he had burst into the room to catch a glimpse of a healthy-sized erection as John struggled to hide it from him, invariably leaving Sherlock desperately trying to cover a blush and look away before his own body began to react – but when he looked back John was sitting up in bed, clearly having been woken from rather deep sleep.
His words are cut off by another sharp twist of the revolver. "Shut up," the woman hisses. "You don't get to talk now, you filthy bastard. You ruined my life, but you won't ruin anyone else's. Not anymore."
in it."
he added to himself,
The detective frowned. "I'm afraid not. I'm staying at an acquaintance's inn in Islington currently - I've been having a bit of trouble finding lodgings within my price range ." He stopped suddenly, John almost stepping into a questionable puddle in the road to keep up with the change in pace. "Actually," he said thoughtfully. "I found a nice two-bedroom house in Marylebone for rent. I couldn't stand the thought of sharing lodgings with a stranger, but I… if we split the rent, it wouldn't be much more than your current rooms."
Kirsty stuttered a little, glancing at Hannah. "We… we thought because of the plague on the Degavar System, you know, they might have
He allowed Sherlock to give a wistful smile at this, returning it with an indulgent expression. He lifted a hand as if to stroke the velveteen curls, allowing the longing to do so show plainly on his face. Sherlock leaned almost unconsciously into the imagined touch. Then John took a deep breath, breaking the spell like swiping a hand through cobweb.
"I want you to." The taller man doesn't hesitate this time. "I'm ready now, I'm expecting it. I trust you."
Sherlock said judiciously, with a distinct air as though he was trying to close the conversation.
. She looks a lot older than he remembers her, but then, it's been more than ten years. "Oh, Hannah! I'm great, how are you? How's Bill?" Hannah's husband Bill had been a friend of John's through high-school, and they'd joined the army together. Bill he saw often, but he hadn't seen Hannah since they'd left for Afghanistan. "This is my friend Sherlock," he introduces, remembering his manners. "Hannah and I went to high school together. Before she married my best friend."
John asked, unabashed at his naked curiosity, letting a modicum of jealousy show through in his face.
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
The detective is breathing heavily, staring at him, eyes wide. "John," he says, and his voice has impossibly dropped at least an octave. "That… I…"
Sherlock turned away, shifting his whole body sideways to look out of the window as though turning his face away might stop him from hearing, from feeling the John-sized hole in his chest so acutely. But the Doctor kept talking, and Sherlock kept hearing it, listening to it despite himself. "And then I met this woman, and she… convinced me to go back." Suddenly the absent frenzied tapping of fingertips on Formica stopped and the large hand grabbed at Sherlock's. "I understand how you feel," he said earnestly. Sherlock couldn't look at him because he was having trouble just
Sherlock grinned back. "Perhaps somewhere without the murderous flesh-eating aliens, this time," he suggested lightly.
The Biology laboratory was buzzing with noise when he got there; the teacher hadn't arrived yet and one side of the classroom was gathered around Sally Donovan, browner than ever, beaming and showing off her new shoulder-bag and holiday photos. John slid into a seat beside Bradley, who was watching them with a vaguely interested look on his face. The blond looked over at him as he sat down. "Hey, John. Sally talked to you yet?"
His search for the keys was arrested by John grabbing his lapels and pushing him against the front door, standing on tiptoes in order to press their lips together. Their bodies rocked solidly against each other, and Sherlock momentarily wished that his coat was four sizes bigger so that he could button it closed around the two of them, shielding them from the outside world.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes," the Great Detective pronounced, "and this is Captain John Watson and Constable Gregory Lestrade."
Kirsty pursed her lips as though she had just bitten into something sour. "When you're ready," she said, twisting the doorhandle rather more sharply than necessary.
They stopped in front of a completely inconspicuous door, Holmes dropping the thief unceremoniously on the ground. "Feel free to leave now, Master Watson," he said brightly. "Your help has been much appreciated, but I imagine you will want to get
him bared so deliberately, his chest heaving slightly with each deep breath. He lifted his hands once more to swipe his thumbs gently over Sherlock's dusky nipples, earning another deep groan as Sherlock's own long-fingered hands deftly unhooked John's shirt from his trousers. When John looked up at him, Sherlock quirked one corner of his mouth upwards, his eyebrow lifting in a silent question.
Shakespeare nodded briskly. "Go on, then, good lad," he agreed, shooing the young actor towards the stage door. "All right, Sherlock - now
"Apparently," John had to agree.
Sherlock blinks again, a slow flicker of the black fan of eyelashes over the misty-grey orbs. Something flashes over his face, a glimpse of some rare emotional struggle. Then he laughs and claps John on the arm. "Perhaps it's for the best," he says, smiling in pure, childish delight.
"Unfortunately, if you don't pick a stranger, you won't get anyone," John said wistfully. He accepted Sherlock's coat when it was held out to him with an absent expression, as though he didn't notice he was doing it. That was another thing that Sherlock valued so much about John: Sherlock had become such an intrinsic part of his life that it was as if the doctor attended to his every need without thinking about it, on automatic pilot the same way in which he brushed his own teeth. "And sometimes you need someone."
why she does it, Sherlock, you might cut her a bit of slack every now and again."
The doctor smirked at his repeated use of the word 'exploring'. Sherlock was momentarily grateful that Lestrade was looking in the opposite direction as he allowed himself to imagine the scenario.
He looked around for Ben, who was still standing surrounded by John's entourage to one side, arms folded sulkily.
Again, Sherlock took the time to breathe in and out before he asked the girl calmly, "Do you know what they sell at the scary shop, Emilia?"
At least, that's what Sherlock thinks. John has other ideas.
Sherlock smirks. "To Milverton's cleaner."
Sherlock is already sprawled over the sofa when he enters, busy wrapping himself in the discarded duvet from the morning. He looks up when John bangs the door and his smile quickly turns into a frown of disapproval.
he said quietly, turning back to Sherlock. He sighed wistfully, reaching out a hand as though to stroke the older man's face but thinking better of it.
so badly if he just dared to open his eyes he wouldn't be able to see straight, but he doesn't dare to do anything except kiss back. He leaves control of the situation in Sherlock's hands, holding himself back, because he knows that at any second it might all be snatched away from him.
to touch.
Sherlock doesn't react in the slightest; John nervously watches the steady up-and-down of his exposed collarbone as he breathes. "It's fine," he says finally. The tone of the words is so careful and rehearsed that he doesn't believe it, knows that whatever he's done to hurt Sherlock it's somehow more than just a gentle kiss he didn't want. "Just as long as it doesn't happen again."
a candle on the actual table, but more light couldn't possibly hurt. "He just likes you," he said fondly. "He wants to give you the best things he can."
"I suppose we'll just have to keep your mouth occupied," Sherlock replied wryly, removing his hand in order to replace it with his lips, pulling their groins together in another long, shivery roll that made John's thighs ache with effort and his knees tingle.
believed you could be the king of the fairies.
"Continue, my Lady," he said once he had finished his perusal. "They left you tied to the chair, and I am assuming gagged somehow so that you could not call for help?"
Sherlock shot him a grin and muttered, "You wish." He hadn't meant it to be flirtatious, but from the way the doctor grinned back he could tell it had turned out that way anyway. Sometimes he wasn't sure whether John returned his flirting because he thought Sherlock only did it to unnerve the Yarders or because he, like Sherlock, did it without realising, did it because it was the natural response to the way John looked and spoke and moved.
The playwright hummed in thought. "Well, you're a detective now, John," he said with no small trace of amusement. "I'll leave it in your capable hands."
together, are proving as difficult to separate as a limpet from a wet rock. I'm not sure which of us is the rock in this case; probably me, seeing as he's the one that's trying to leave.
somehow, more willing to interact with people. John felt as though Jim had accepted their company because attempting to get rid of them would have been too much trouble, rather than because he wanted friends, as though he would be perfectly happy on his own. Sherlock's reactions to his praise, however, suggested a more natural desire to be
Sherlock nodded happily. "Of course, John." His long fingers toyed with the rim of his mug, drawing John's eyes as they stroked absently. "Lestrade will most likely depart for Sussex tomorrow, so we shouldn't be disturbed by those investigations, although he may pop by himself to discuss the questions he ought to be asking the inn staff. But I had got the impression that you were rather enjoying that aspect of our acquaintance - you wouldn't object to the Constable stopping in, would you?"
Sherlock smirked. "Probably not, if he ever actually tried. Too much of an ego."
Sherlock looks at him. "Yes. I know." He smiles weakly. "I… I just don't like not being in control. That's part of the reason I never wanted to try it before. I thought maybe I should gather data on it because it's the motivation for so many crimes, but it's not a stable source of data. And I didn't trust anyone else enough to try and lose control with them. I knew what you were doing, with all the making tea and the compliments, and I thought I should try – I found the notion… appealing. I'd expected to react when you kissed me, but it was too strong and my brain shut down and shut you out. But I want to try."
Sherlock's smirk widened.
Sherlock snorted, although he didn't bother to attempt to deny that he had also been achingly curious. "We should probably get out of here before the police turn up," he mused, looking around at the people picking themselves up off the carpet. "
"Sorry," he jokes anyway. "Wrong room."
Ben was still at the theatre when they arrived but Emilia was long gone; the boy was in mid-flow on the stage surrounded by the rest of the company, Will bouncing on the balls of his feet and mouthing the lines along with him. The playwright turned at the sound of the ground doors opening, a mixture of relief and disapproval on his face. John hadn't bothered to check how long ago he had asked them to be there.
"And now to get back at her – and you, in all probability – he's kidnapped Lady Carfax and at least one other woman," Sherlock said, rather cruelly in John's opinion. The elder Holmes quite clearly understood exactly how much he had messed up, even if John didn't. "We can't know whether the woman posing as his wife was complicit in the kidnapping or not."
, the air quiet but for the melancholy cries of the circling crows. Perhaps whatever was wrong was confined to that one tower.
Sherlock snorted. "That's what they all say," he managed, though the sarcasm of his words was lost somewhat in another groan. "
John had always laughed a little at how quickly Theseus overturned Hermia's father's determination that she should marry Demetrius and not Lysander. Egeus' insistence on having Lysander's head and Demetrius' heart was essentially the driving force of the play, and yet once it became apparent that Demetrius' heart had - perhaps unnaturally - returned to Helena, one sentence from Theseus denied the lord's cries for justice and ensured a happily ever after for the lovers.
Before either of them can quite process what's happening, they're outside on the street blinking in the sun and staring at a burly officer standing in the doorway and smiling back at them in a way that quite clearly indicates he won't be letting them back in and Lestrade is apologising to them again through the window of a patrol car.
Sherlock's grin turned amused. "Oh, yes," he said airily. "He isn't sure yet, but he was thinking
or for the character he was playing. He smiled shyly back anyway, attempting to shrug the praise away without words.
it works, I said," Sherlock admonished, but he couldn't keep back the smirk at the expression of pure joy on the other man's face. His opinion really seemed to count for something in this man's mind – this
Sherlock waved lazily at him from a seat at the base of the stands, the drawing master on Gracechurch street apparently forgotten. John rolled his eyes, but grinned at his friend and waved back anyway.
"A shop in Moregate, Master Holmes," Billy told him, standing up as though anticipating being knocked over by the detective's enthusiasm. "One of the pieces you described, in a packet with some others."
John pulled his chin down to press a fond kiss to his lips. "I promise," he assured him. "Trust me. I'm a doctor."
Nonplussed, John frowned at the girl. "My name? Why, what did I do?"
John couldn't say anything, not even as the teachers surrounding the pool began shunting everyone out of the building, herding them onto the London pavement outside. Carl Powers, dead. He wasn't sure how he was supposed to feel about that.
John shared the detective's triumphant look as it was directed at him. "And when was that?" Lestrade asked, giving the two of them a wan smile in acknowledgment.
Unacceptably, I can feel tears well up behind my eyes. I screw them shut to stop anything from happening and turn pointedly away from my landlady, hoping she'll just leave but knowing she won't. I haven't cried since I was fourteen, but I remember the last time quite clearly. Then, as well, I was fine until someone offered me comfort.
John couldn't help but be insulted at the knowing glance that his friend bestowed upon him, accompanied as it was by Sherlock's amused little smirk.
The smaller man nods. "My PA was there for a good portion of the night, but he never went upstairs."
I enjoyed it, John. The reason I don't want it done in public is because it's horrifically arousing."
John melted and solidified simultaneously under the onslaught; lost himself in it and discovered new parts of himself. Kissing Sherlock was nothing at all like kissing the girls he'd been with; then, he had been cautious, gentle, in control because he had wanted to take care of them. Now Sherlock was refusing to let him be any of those things and something electric was sparking inside him. Sherlock Holmes was something different, something breathtaking, something
Bill shut up for the rest of the lesson.
"The Trelawney-Hopes'. There are a number of things I'd like to know before we expose this properly."
He couldn't help but smile at the metaphor, noticing the movements of his fingers but being unable to stop them. The Doctor looked down at them and grinned. "She approves of you," he said, his voice returning to its usual joviality. "I didn't think she would. I thought she might even try to throw you out, you being all…" he waved a hand like a fish fighting for oxygen, the gesture encompassing Sherlock's body. "Complicated."
Sherlock smiled, accepting the hand up that John gave him and stepping carefully away from Bottom's body as Ben jumped towards it and eased the donkey mask off.
be real, especially now when that's become the point of the fantasy in the first place.
response that might have been on the tip of his tongue vanishes.
A tiny, shy smile crept across Sherlock's face that made John's stomach twist. It seemed strange that he was this attached to Sherlock after knowing him for just over an hour. "All right," Sherlock said. "I'll meet you at the British Museum at eleven on Saturday."
"Oh, the cleverness of you," John sighed mock-wistfully.
"Why can't he treat
Grieg had slipped his hands down when Sherlock broke the kiss to talk, grabbed his hips, and before he had a chance to register what was happening, lifted him up and deposited him on the edge of the desk. Sherlock watched, panting, as he slid down his chair and onto his knees with fluid grace. For a moment he
Will Kemp made an obscene gesture and Shakespeare nodded sharply. "Yes, like that, Master Kemp, thank you," he dismissed. He looked around the company, inviting questions. "Is that ok with everyone?" he checked. There was a collective murmur of agreement and nods. "Good. From the top of scene five, and I'll try not to interrupt again."
John, apparently, noticed too. "You're very upbeat this morning," he commented, towelling his hair thoughtfully as he entered the kitchen. "Sleep well, did you?"
, he reasoned to himself. It was
John raised an eyebrow. "Yeah? Name one."
This stopped John dead for a moment. His best friend smiled almost pityingly. "John," he said, almost pityingly. "I know you better than you know yourself, and I'm getting to know Sherlock a lot better than he thinks I am."
John grinned wickedly. "Your butt is ticklish," he stated, scratching it again.
Mycroft's lip curled in distaste. "I have told you before what I think of your little
The blonde looked at Billy, looking frightened and uncertain. The older boy nodded encouragingly towards Sherlock. "The scary shop," the girl said, so quietly that even John struggled to hear her.
"Enough," Sherlock replied quietly. "Kiss me?" He made sure to say it like a plea rather than a demand, and John smiled as he complied, readjusting his body against Sherlock's so that he could feel the weight of him pressing him down, the kiss subduing him until his hips rocked unconsciously forward against John's thighs. He was
back there. He gasps and threads a hand into Sherlock's curls, not pushing or moving, just there, and when Sherlock licks his earlobe into that unbelievable mouth he can't stop the detective's name escaping his lips. He feels Sherlock smirking against his neck and his heartbeat accelerates until it's one steady hum and each individual beat is indiscernible, blending into a song of Sherlock's name.
"Morning, Sherlock," he says brightly. Sherlock grunts out a reply without looking at him, so he makes sure he crosses right in front of his flatmate to bend over the laundry basket in search of clean pants.
Sherlock shook his head. It didn't seem right. People were always eager to put shoes on after leaving the swimming pool to avoid getting wet feet, so how could they take away a pair that wasn't theirs by accident? And it was highly unlikely that someone whose friend had just had a fit and died would think to grab his shoes. "
John smiles grimly. "Then at least you'll have company."
them like I delete the solar system. His blatant misunderstanding when I told him about the way I delete things was really more amusing than irritating, no matter how much I griped at him about it. I can feel Mrs Hudson bristling with indignation and it's comforting that I know she's on my side, but I'm glad she doesn't say anything. I don't need to hear how badly out of line he was, because I already
If he expects Sherlock to look nonplussed and ask him who Janet Frame was, he's disappointed. "Am I supposed to be grateful they're not diagnosing me with schizophrenia and giving me electric shock therapy?"
Sherlock's eyelids flutter, and before he can open his eyes and protest that John is taking too long, the doctor leans forward and as gently as he can, touches their lips together. Sherlock breathes in slowly against him, his fingers tightening on the sleeve of John's jacket. John tries to draw back but the detective follows him, pushing forwards to keep the contact between them.
personality, even then, even after only knowing you for an hour, I couldn't think about anything other than you and I thought… if I spent more time with you I'd be completely consumed by you. It scared me that all the reasons I had for
So here we are, then, sitting over a pile of books and trinkets, trying desperately to remember moving in and each unpacking our own things. John sighs over a rolled-up poster of the human muscular system. "Is this yours or mine?" he asks tiredly, tapping my leg with it. I look up and shrug; it's his, but I've used it before so if he wants to leave it behind I won't complain. He shakes his head. "This is ridiculous," he says. "We've lived together for so long that nothing is
"You recognise the piece?" the jeweller asked, his eyes narrow as he watched Sherlock scrutinising it.

you may as well leave," the detective snapped. "Two women are missing, I don't have time to play guessing games."
His entire pre-prepared speech delivered, Sherlock sat back slightly and watched the teacher nervously. Grieg stared at him until he said quietly, "Please say something."
"Your verdict?" Julien asked, sliding his hand from Sherlock's jaw to the collar of his shirt.
his friend asked, whirling around on one heel in order to glare properly at John as he clambered to his feet.
So big, to hold so much: they lack retention.
The inkeep nodded amiably. "Aye, he's up," he said gruffly, waving his tray in explanation. "I hear congratulations are in order for last night," he added, grinning.
John's phone announces itself before his first pint even arrives, but he doesn't check it for a few minutes. It's too fast, and he's scared that it means Sherlock doesn't want to see him again.
The consulting detective flashes a positively disarming grin at his flatmate, then lets out an 'ah!' of triumph as the lock clicks and the door swings open. There is, Sherlock mentions languidly as they creep through the corridor, a door that leads right
mind. What had he done to be recognised on an
John figuratively shakes himself, takes the plunge, and presses his lips to Sherlock's.
The boy's arms dropped as if in shock.
It was a while like this before John noticed that Sherlock was whimpering into his mouth and pressing his groin into John's hip; the very idea of how close to coming apart his friend was made John plant his hand into the other man's buttock and pull him closer, drawing a groan from his mouth. Sherlock's hands scrambled for the ties of John's trousers, tugging at them and somehow managing to tighten them instead of undoing them. John laughed. "Sherlock-" he placated, wincing as a particularly sharp pull pinched his skin. "Let me."
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever."
The Constable frowned. "But I can? My job's important too -"
The detective gave him a rather patronising look. "At least one person has been murdered," he said sternly. "They're not doing this for fun."
But Sherlock was shaking his head. John frowned at him. "I don't… there isn't anything else. That's the happiest memory I can think of."
John caught up with him at the bottom of the stairs out of the apartment building, his shoulder bumping comfortingly against Sherlock's upper arm. Sherlock shot him a grin as he opened the building's front door with a sweeping gesture, indicating the doctor should move ahead of him. "So, John," he said brightly, closing the door behind them with a snap. "You're not busy this afternoon, are you?"
John eyed the woman, who giggled again, tilting her chest forward so that her breasts almost spilled out of her dress as though to demonstrate that they were, indeed, dun-coloured. "Flattering," he commented. "Women will swoon."
He wanted the use of his hands, because he was sure that just a few touches to the parts of his cock that John's rocking wasn't reaching would cause him to come, but he didn't
Sherlock laughed, dipping his head down into another urgent kiss but breaking away again before the point of no return. "My bedroom's closer," he said quickly, grabbing John's hand and dragging him up the stairs behind him.
He climbs back onto the bed and settles down beside his flatmate, his fingers reaching out of their own accord from the overwhelming desire to
The truth is he's not sure he can do this, can attempt to commit so much when he can't be sure Sherlock's committing too. This – what just happened, what Sherlock's suggesting could possibly happen next – this means so much to him, and it evidently means a lot to Sherlock, too, and he couldn't bear it if they messed it up by trying to go too fast.
Sherlock shook his head distantly. "It was always a possibility, that there'd be more than one young blonde submissive with bruises all over her face. The fact that she'd dated all of the victims makes it more complicated. There's so much that was right about her that makes for a hell of a big coincidence considering she isn't the killer. It just doesn't make
"So," he said brightly. "Let's start with what we know." He lifted two sheets of paper from the pile that had sat in front of him. "
But John, chuckling at the memory of the over-enthusiastic Alice Turner, waits a little longer with Lestrade, who shakes his head in defeat and gestures to Donovan. "Did he just solve a case by identifying different kinds of tobacco ash?" he asks, grimacing. Lestrade chuckles.
he was saying wasn't important. "But I don't think they talked for very long." He dropped his eyes from John's with a reluctance that wasn't entirely faked and checked the report. "No," he said, angling the screen towards the doctor and using the gesture to mask a tiny step closer to him. He'd never been on the receiving end of John's seduction before.

The Doctor looked around quickly. "Off in the shadows somewhere, I should think," he said softly. "They accepted my terms and let you go."
that even the most threatening rooms made John smile.
"Yeah, and I've never understood that. No offense or anything, Jim, but I've been there, and it's nothing to shout about."
"Go talk to him in another room. Tell him that you know he let someone into the scene over the weekend – don't
Sherlock kept his ground, implying that he wouldn't
," he repeated, smiling with just a little more than his usual hint of teeth. John returned the smile and twisted his body slightly to pick up his tea again, still very much inside Sherlock's 'personal space'.
John turned to grin at Sherlock, who smiled lazily back at him. His grey-green eyes travelled to the backstage door suggestively, but before they could make any kind of move to disappear Will was patting both of them on the back and reaching out a hand to snag Molly from where he was passing them on the way to fetch his water. "You three," he said indulgently. "I'm so glad I chose this direction for you. And Sherlock - Tom is fantastic."
"Well, you're very observant," he threw back. Sherlock grinned at him, flashing unusually white teeth. It struck John that there was a difference between Sherlock's smiles when he was a detective, and those when he was an actor. Perhaps it was simply the self-consciousness that naturally came with being watched the way an actor was, but the way he looked at John in the context of the stage was entirely more subdued and shy than the way he was grinning now. There was something more
"You would think so," I agree. It looks like red wine, a deep, dark smear on the faintly disgusting peach carpet. "But I wouldn't be too worried if it didn't."
"Where are you going to find someone in ten minutes who knows Titania's part?" John pointed out.
"It wasn't an argument," Sherlock snaps. John catches his eye, still chuckling. For a moment, the detective holds his scowl. Then he snorts in amusement. "But if it was, you wouldn't have been wrong," he admits grudgingly. "You should put this one in your blog."
"That's okay," Sherlock said after a pause, making sure his face showed that it was anything but. "I don't want you to lose your job because of me." He looked around sadly, pointedly adjusting his erection in his trousers as he stood up. "I should go."
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
John bent his head as if to acknowledge her point, letting a sudden, unnerving smile break through his mocking sympathy. "
Holmes laughed. "Oh, yes," he agreed, shifting the thief higher over his shoulder. "Right down to the part where it becomes disappointingly simple once I explain the trick."
The canopy above his head shimmered and changed until it reflected him back to himself, John's body stretched out indolently on red and gold Gryffindor sheets, come splattered over his abdomen and smeared over his lips.
John smiled softly and shrugged. "I always do," he replied easily. Sherlock grinned back.
Once the audience burst into applause - only slightly muted from their previous performances - John turned to say something to his co-star, perhaps try again to comfort him, but Tobias was already gone, leaving his wig and dress hanging over a nearby stool.
, and something jolted through his body like an electrical current, and before he had time to realise what he was doing he'd made some kind of noise and surged forward with his body, dropping Julien's face and clutching his torso with both hands instead.
John freezes. Sherlock looks up at him, tilting his head adorably to cast a look that seems desperate for approval and makes the doctor's stomach twist uncomfortably, and not for the reason it
But. John reasons, at least there's food there, and even if he's trying not to baby the detective or force him to eat, there can be limited harm in placing a dish of something in front of him to try and encourage him. "Great," he says, stepping out to join Sherlock in front of the taxi that seems to magically appear every time the tall man sticks out a hand. "I'm hungry."
Salazar," he groaned, wrapping his own hand around them. John thanked all the four Founders that the younger boy seemed to be just as close as he was. Merlin knew how he had expected to last through being fucked. "Oh, tighter –
He held out her bag; she took it, dropping their hands and smiling at him. "This is where you kiss me for luck, I think," she remarked, so casually John almost didn't realise.
"It looks lovely, your stylist is to be complimented," Sherlock continues. John tries not to frown as his brain whirrs through possible reasons for the flattery.
That wasn't what had happened.
To his surprise, Sherlock sniffed and curled catlike into him, throwing his legs over John's lap and burying his head in his armpit. Slightly bewildered, John rubbed his fingers through Sherlock's curls. He hadn't expected the Cuxton boy to want to be close to him after it was over. This seemed almost
John and I smile. "Happens to the very best of us, my Lord," I remark wryly. "If you'll excuse us."
"Sherlock Holmes," the young brunet pre-empted calmly as they approached the desk, flicking his sleeves back down his arms as he lay aside his pen.
Not that John spent a lot of time theorising about his First Officer and best friend's sexual organs and practices. Curiosity was human, that was all.
Faced with such blatant disapproval John almost felt guilty. "Obviously I did," he countered, sitting down in the chair opposite his friend and trying to look indignant. The playwright put down his paper and gave John his full attention, placing his hands deliberately on the arms of his chair. John sighed under his scrutiny. "Will - I know why you disapprove but honestly, this actually solved a problem we were having that would have affected our performance."
He broke away after a moment to breathe heavily against Sherlock's neck, feeling the pulse race under his forehead. "Will you give yourself to me?" he asked quietly, pressing soft kisses to the trembling skin of Sherlock's throat. "Let me make up for all the things
I want to be able to kiss him good morning and fall asleep with his arms around me and mine around him. To listen to the sound of his breathing and his heartbeat even when we're just sitting on the sofa together. I want to be able to touch him the way he wants me to, and to have him touch me and maybe I'll get used to it, maybe there's a way we could do it that wouldn't be so overwhelming.
John grinned at him. "I gather from past experience that they are, yes," he said.
Sherlock took a sharp breath in and put his hand over John's where it was trailing cheekily down his stomach to stop it. "Three I could have dismissed as coincidence. Four I have more trouble with.
in here made it even harder to believe that he was really just made up of thoughts in someone else's mind. "Okay," he said. "I'll see you on the other side, I suppose."
The detective opened his mouth to say something, but was cut off by the clicking of the doorhandle behind them. John's heart leapt into his throat as the door swung open, knowing what had to happen and what it could mean if things went wrong.  Without thinking, he reached out to clasp Sherlock's hand in his to share the tension, but found only empty air; Sherlock looked at him oddly as John groped at the space between them. He supposed this really wasn't the time for holding hands.
Miracle seemed to think about this. "I would say for certain that if Lady Brackenstall had a secret, Lady Carfax knew about it. The other way around I am less certain about, but it is entirely possible."
The consulting detective wriggles his way out of John's grip and for a moment he thinks he's done something grievously wrong and the other man's about to run away and bang his door shut. Then Sherlock's lips are on him, hard and moving, and there's tongue and hands and John
He blinked wildly for a few seconds before he remembered why that was significant. "Oh, right. I'll have to remember to photocopy my notes after Bio, then."
The doctor frowns slightly.

Jim smirked around his mouthful. "Donegal. But my family lived in Dublin for the last six years."
The hand in his twitched as the Doctor sighed. "But the thing is, it's worth it. It might not seem it right after you leave someone, but you realise in the end that it's worth the hurt when you lose them, to have them in the first place. You and Doctor Watson, there's more. Much more. You've only just begun."
Bill narrowed his eyes at him, but then shrugged. "Just curious as to what you might bring to something like this," he said finally.
"Julien, please," he corrected him. "Forgive my tardiness,
"Promise me
She swallows visibly. "I assume there will be significant damage to his career if the document is released to the public?"
They both looked up at him at the same time, smiling broadly. John couldn't help but grin back, taking Will's place in the dance only to hear the final line of Ben's soliloquy and drop their hands again. Sherlock smiled at him, his angular face softening slightly. John fought the urge to lean in for a kiss. On stage, in character, he could pass off the compulsive press of lips on lips, but he couldn't do that when it was just he and Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again. "
John painted their young Demetrius' eyes with his flowers as Ben scampered off and re-entered, alone and looking no less gleeful at the misfortune he'd brought on the lovers. "
"I thought if I could show her how little she was upset by all the people she'd devoted so much of her life to
coding accidents don't generally go down very well with the Frankfurt forces." The other man smiled in a somewhat empty sort of manner. "Do you drink coffee, Doctor?" Sherlock asked briskly.
, but he knew that that wasn't why the man had said it and the knowledge kept him quiet.
Sherlock looks up innocently from where he is sitting, the Stradivarius cradled in his lap, light from the window catching the ends of his curls and lighting them up like a halo. "I'm sorry?"
"Oh, God," Sherlock breathed, stepping forwards and kissing John again, wrapping their bodies together and burying one hand in the doctor's short, sandy hair. His cock nudged against the soft, dry skin of John's belly, and he could feel the hard heat of his new lover's own member pressing insistently into his thigh.
Sherlock shrugged. "I know the woman who owns and keeps the house. She owes me a favour and offered me a lower rent - her husband was executed for treason following the Devereux plot last year."
The frown did not diminish. "Are you doing that because you don't want to go, or because you want me to talk you back into it?"
Sherlock managed a smirk as he deftly unlooped the other boy's tie. "Always." He'd never seen the point of patience, of waiting for other people to take their sweet time about doing things. Most of the time they were just too stupid to realise he was in a hurry anyway. Mycroft had once suggested he slow down and appreciated some of the finer things in life. So he'd left the remains of the frog he was dissecting in his brother's bed and showed him just how appreciative he could be.
on you, it's the first whole-company rehearsal and you want us to do it without the main character?" Sherlock only frowned unconcernedly. "He'll kill you," John mused, trying desperately to think of an angle that would work and knowing that one wasn't it. "Sherlock, you need to get it out of your mind. Throw yourself into something else and then let this sort itself out in the back of your mind."
Lestrade stopped mid-sentence and frowned at him suspiciously. "He described a short brunette with a snub nose, and he'd never heard of Teresa, the maid," he finished. Sherlock nodded shortly. "How did
them so much that they will never let more than the smallest glimmer of emotion into the front of their minds. That is why we must endure Pon Farr - the struggle to hold everything back becomes too much."
"He's my brother," John bluffed idly. Carl's smile vanished. "No, not really. Are you going to let him go now, or am I going to have to explain to Ms Roper why I'm late
He sighed, and allowed John to rub soothingly down his arm. John resisted the urge to press a kiss to the top of his head.

"Actually," the Doctor interjected, "they
reason not to want to be around you, Sherlock Holmes," he said sharply. "You are smart and funny and
The ex-army medic flushed and hurried to cut the tape around Sherlock's hands. "Do they feel all right?" he asked, rubbing his wrists gently. Sherlock could feel indentations in his skin where he had struggled against the tape. "Circulation okay?"
John snorted and glanced hesitantly at Sherlock. The detective was looking at the man who had spoken with a half-amused, half-murderous expression. "We're off the stage now, mate," he replied easily, lifting his mug in a salute.
"Yes, I can imagine that would be a problem," Sherlock replies, his eyes lighting up. John, too, sits up straighter and leans forward. "Considering he was murdered yesterday evening."
John waits until he's sure Sherlock is finished, then nods slowly. "Thank you, Sherlock," he says gently. "I didn't know how much I was hurting you, but now that I do, I promise you I'll try to stop, okay? I'm not going anywhere, not if you don't want me to, because I really don't want to."
The boy raised a suggestive eyebrow, not looking at all rattled by the implication. "And that touched a nerve?" he asked, grinning cheekily.
Sherlock shuddered in arousal at the image, a soft moan escaping his lips. Julien's green eyes snapped up to his, and the boy's lips twitched into what might have been a smile had his mouth been empty. He could feel the muscles in his hips twitching with the involuntary thrusts he was trying to hold back as Julien's mouth kept slowly and gently advancing down his length. He bit his lips to stifle another moan as one of the other boy's hands left his hip and travelled down his own torso to disappear under the waistband of his pants.
The detective strode onto the stage first, flanked by one of Orsino's attendants.

To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
John tried not to look as though this hurt. "I was only trying to help," he said in as patient a tone as he could manage. "Last time I suggested things like that to you it seemed to help. Why'd you keep asking me to come with you if I annoy you?"
"I read it," John told him, taking his own - significantly thinner - cue-script from his pocket. "Orsino only has one scene over these two acts. Will wants me to play some other character as well. Belch, I think he said. He'll give me the scripts later - it means I get stage time with him, and with Molly, even if it's as an ass."
I want you. Have you ever spent ten minutes in your own company? It's impossible to talk to you and
"Because that curtain-rail is three inches higher than I can comfortably reach, so he must be at least three inches taller than I am," Sherlock replied easily, shrugging.
"Oh, yes," Sherlock confirmed, forcing a bright tone of voice. "Yes, you did brilliantly. I believe my theory is not only plausible but almost definitely correct." John smiled at him. There was a heartbeat's awkward pause in which Sherlock considered throwing the entire façade away and begging the doctor to finish him off. Then he cleared his throat briskly. "If you could just cut my hands free, John, I'll write up my findings and send some enquiries to a few contacts."
"But this
"What colour were the tulips?" John interjects. Sherlock shoots him a look.
John tried to smile. "I told you you could." The former Slytherin looked back at him and beamed. "What were you thinking about? If you don't mind me asking," he added hurriedly.
as my lead. He said he'd been impressed by your
Did we establish already that John's not your average Englishman? Because falling in love with Sherlock Holmes, while perhaps never exactly on his to-do list, is quite possibly his proudest achievement. Not that it was difficult, really, but in the two days since he realised he'd managed it, it has provided him with no end of entertainment.
John moved without thinking, slinging his fist up to connect with the side of the man's head and dropping him like a sack of potatoes.
"I was young and keen once," John mused. Sherlock did not respond.
he sneered.
"I'm not going to lecture you, or try and get you to report whoever did that to you. I'll completely ignore it if you want me to. I guess I just wanted to check you're okay." John's fingers tapped against his mug uncomfortably.
"I think we should talk outside," he said quietly.
. Please, come in." Sally sighed as he turned to face her. "Sally. I'm serious, okay? You're lovely, but I'm not interested." On cue, the copier spewed out the last page of notes and he gathered them into a pile. "Here – I hope you can read my writing. I'm glad you had a good holiday."
"How so?" John asks, surprised. He's never seen it like that; Sherlock's very existence is a blaze of glory and energy and intelligence, and his own… well, it's

, post-coital cuddling like any other couple. John wound an arm around Sherlock and smiled to himself.
John to try to overwhelm him, he was steadily refusing to do just that, keeping control of the kiss firmly away from him.
John waits a long time for him to elaborate, but after a few minutes that stretch out like years, he drops the stick in the sand and walks away.
Will rolled his eyes, but his expression was fond. "We never doubted you, Sherlock," he drawled. Molly was already gone, chasing after his new friend with a shout of

John tries not to laugh. He really does. But Sherlock's statement irrevocably brings to mind the theme song from
Sherlock looked back at Mycroft's closed door, from which Lestrade had not yet emerged, with a heavy frown. "I imagine it'll be too late by
They laid the dead woman down as gently as they could manage on the floor of the dingy cottage; Lestrade looked as though he were holding back his gag reflex with great difficulty as they bent back to the nails in the base of the coffin, Sherlock prising them up with relative ease until they could lift the second lid and discard it on the floor.
They sprinted back to the door they had entered the forest through, Sherlock's heart throbbing in his throat. The moment Hannah was through the heavy door the Doctor slammed it shut and leaned against it, panting. Sherlock doubled over and tried to breathe through the image that wouldn't leave his head of the shadows stretching greedily towards their feet as they ran past. Hannah was gasping in shock, spluttering against the wall.
Will raised a suggestive eyebrow at John, who rolled his eyes. "Not at all," the playwright said dryly.
"Lube. You have… why do
The doctor tensed as though he had not expected to hear it; he turned in Sherlock's arms and kissed his lips, hard. "I love you too," he said fiercely. Then he split into a bright grin and turned back towards the laptop. "Now shush. The Angels have the phonebox."

worried, whatever was about to happen was probably something he didn't want to be awake for.
long-term, surrendering to the fact that Sherlock was going to become the defining part of himself for the indeterminate future. Sherlock would, within their first walk around the British Museum, come to influence the way he thought about what he wanted to do in the future, from Christmas dinner to enlisting in the army. What were the chances that Sherlock was in it for the same?
Those people he'd cared for that had screamed at the top of their lungs that it felt like their body was on fire, felt like something was eating them from the inside, they were all wrong.
John glanced back at the script, confused at the abrupt change in subject. He had heard
. He's never been very good at reading the little tells that add up to spell
"I expected something in a less wealthy part of town, not something the children had let rot," John tried to defend. "How did they get this house in the first place? This neighbourhood costs more than I've earned in my entire life."
Angelo chuckled deeply. "Three years, give or take," he confirmed. "He's a good lad. Still looked like a boy when he saved my life."
Sherlock, the wanker, knows exactly how confused everyone else is, and is enjoying every moment of it. "Officer Gregson," he addresses to the guard in front of the cell, remarkably like a magician announcing his final trick. "Would you be so kind as to fetch me a bowl of water and a sponge? Thank you."
John snorted. "But it's so nice in here," he said lightly. "I don't know how you can bear to leave."
The detective took a surprisingly patient breath in. "Where did you see him, Emilia?" he asked kindly.
he said, disapproval of the two of them clear in his voice. Sherlock awkwardly shrugged off his embrace at the sound.
After a while the giggles faded and the reality of their surroundings crept up on them; the detective broke off his last chuckle with a discomfited grunt and slid down the floor in order to lift his hips and work his trousers back up his thighs. The gracelessness of the motion set John off again, but now that Sherlock had brought it to his attention his own trousers were biting into his thighs and he had to imitate his friend, rolling clumsily onto the floor to pull them up to a more comfortable level. When he had finished struggling he looked over at the detective, now lying on the floor beside him staring up at the ceiling with a mildly concerned look on his elegant face. John rolled onto his side to look at him more clearly, frowning at his expression.
I've seen him somewhere before and I still can't place him," he said, one hand clenching into a fist in frustration. John thought he could understand how painful it would be for Sherlock with his incredible pride in his mind to lose a piece of information so vital.
Sherlock casts a disparaging look backwards. "Why would I? Footprints in the sand only last until the tide comes in, and then they get washed away and forgotten about." He's picked up a piece of driftwood along the way, and is holding it out in front of him like a wizard with a staff. John snorts, then frowns.
The last couplet he spoke tentatively, somehow managing to look up at John despite being so much taller. He wasn't quite sure how to react to so much insecurity being thrown at him by one of his servants at once; John cycled through a large number of possible reactions in his mind before settling for trying to appear interested to placate the younger man.
The young, blonde teacher jogged the last few steps to catch up with them, grinning widely. "Have a good holiday? It's a shame you're not in my form group this year. I fought for you, but apparently they wanted to do it by your subject choice."
The detective chuckles, the low, amused chuckle that John loves, only today it's not for him but some woman, somewhere. Maybe it's judgemental and disgusting but John had never really considered that Sherlock might

look over her shoulder at him, and he is justified in not-so-gently removing the woman.
It was the staff entrance, invisible unless you were looking for it, down a tiny pedestrian alleyway squeezed between an electrician's and a boutique soap shop. Sherlock had carefully circled the block until he was certain he was parallel to the pool and then ventured down the nearest alley until he came to the open space required around the pool building so that the damp wouldn't spread.
on his face, as though he were right back there in that swimming pool, staring at John for the first time. "And then I met you, and you didn't get angry when I deduced everything about you, and you called me brilliant and amazing and you were willing to fight for me even though I'd only just met you. If I'd never met you back then, John, I'd be a bitter and lonely drug addict who'd never trusted anyone or let anyone in."
John was dimly aware of Lestrade shifting in surprise as he blinked at his friend. "But you're not finished here," he protested.
a fraud. And nothing
The redhead paused. Then he said carefully, in the exact same tone as before, "So who was he?"
The Doctor made a thoughtful noise. "There's a chance… if we got you back to the TARDIS I have things - enough light could make them let you go, and then it's just a case of trapping them and putting them somewhere they can't hurt anyone. But we still have an entire swarm in this building, we don't know how far they've spread. I'd hoped we'd managed to trap them in the forest, but apparently not."
There was a crash behind him, a muffled
John nodded sharply. Sherlock was gratified to notice that he looked a little disappointed.
Molly stood gaping, his mouth opening and closing like a fish finding itself unexpectedly out of water.
John frowned. "You can talk to me about things that are bothering you outside the play, you know," he told him firmly.
The friend of Mr Holmes' who was here with him?
They stood in silence for a moment, desperately looking at each other. Molly Hooper had listened in from where she was checking up on the other members of the landing party; her dark eyes were wide with fear as she looked desperately at John. Then Captain Adler cleared her throat. "Doctor Watson," she said softly. "I don't like to ask, but… you could try."
rocked the room before John had time to process what was inside it; he cried out as he was thrown against the wall, almost touching the occupant of the bed. The young Sherlock didn't move, apparently noticing neither the crash nor the grown Starfleet Officer who had almost fallen on top of him.
He allowed his fingers to probe gently at the completely dry, fake-looking bone. "What could do this to a person in three weeks?"
"Who the

John's hand fixed itself into his hair and tugged their lips together again; this time his tongue probed out almost straightaway, nudging against Sherlock's lips until he parted them quickly to let it in. He was trapped by it, by John's body and his mouth, unable to move but not wanting to, clutching helplessly at the short greying hair and revelling in the warmth of John's skull underneath. John was
He grinned as Julien got to his knees again, sitting on his heels and sliding his cool fingers up from Sherlock's knees to his thighs before lowering his head again.
John twisted himself onto the stool Tobias had so vehemently vacated and frowned. "I have no idea," he replied. He accepted the toga that the playwright handed him without looking at it. "
he said.
John had just kissed those lips. The pressure of his own hand darkened them in comparison to their normal pale pink.
"Sherlock," Bill booms wryly. Wry seems to be his default setting, and I have yet to hear him branch out. "What can we get you to drink? You haven't touched anything yet."
Sherlock gave him a scathing look. "Oh, he was definitely dominant," he appraised, putting the photograph down. "Perhaps our
One corner of John's thin lips turned up amusedly. "Tease," he declared wryly. Sherlock shot him a stunning smile that apparently turned flirtatious on him again, because the doctor's own smile betrayed a flash of the idle, sultry heat Sherlock had received the previous night. It was lucky he was still holding onto the back of his chair, because his knees threatened to buckle.
"Go on, then."
John stared at him. "Sherlock," he said, allowing the surprise to show in his voice. "Sorry, I thought you were my flatmate."
, Sherlock wasn't exactly giving off the impression of a boy who knew exactly what he was doing – but there was something swelling in his chest like it had just been born, and instead he found himself clutching onto a pale, bony shoulder and pressing back.
They didn't talk about what had happened, how it had affected the both of them. John's eyes lingered on him more often than usual when he thought Sherlock was looking at his food, and for his part Sherlock felt the stares burn through his skin and make it flush pink. He hadn't felt quite this caught-out since he was fourteen and Mycroft had found him in the laundry desperately trying to wash his pyjamas before his mother found them.
John coughed carefully. "An exclusive
he agreed, gesturing towards Shakespeare once more.
John cleared his throat quietly. Both men turned to look at him with vaguely surprised expressions. "Who
," John retorted.
John cocked his head to one side.
John smiled down at him as he turned the shower on; Sherlock flinched at the cold spray before it began to warm against his skin. Really though, he mused as he watched the doctor, sitting down was the best place to be in this situation. Perhaps kneeling would put him exactly at eye-level with John's almost painful-looking erection.
Sherlock spread his legs suggestively, letting John slide more solidly against him and kissing him frantically. "Then have me," he told him, arching an eyebrow as coyly as he could. John groaned, reaching down to adjust himself in his trousers, like he was steadying himself to thrust in.
She dipped her regal head. "They did, Master Holmes, but after an hour or so of wriggling I was able to free my mouth enough to scream and Teresa found me. She untied me and then raised the other servants, who called Constable Lestrade. I fainted when Teresa had returned me to my bedchamber from the shock, but I awakened shortly before you arrived." She smiled again, an incongruously wide and playful smile. Teresa added her own timid curling upwards of lips as if to corroborate the story. "Is that all, Master Holmes? I wish to break fast, I have not eaten since last night." she said lightly.
I turn around so that I'm facing him, his hand still rubbing circles into my arm. I sniff and wipe my eyes pathetically – mostly because John has a soft spot for the helpless, so the more innocent I look the more he'll try to comfort me. "I just… It's –"
John propped himself tiredly onto one elbow in order to direct a more serious look at him. "I want everything you want to give me," he replied fervently. "For as long as you want to give it to me."
holding onto it, like the ship itself was reaching out to him. He drew in a sharp breath at the sensation.
He doesn't make it very far before he stops, looking back and frowning at John, wondering why he isn't following. John's still staring after him, nonplussed. "And then what?" John asks, scrambling to catch up. "And then you met me what?"
The detective doesn't relax, standing pressed as close to the wall as possible, his eyes shut so tightly the lids are almost white, his fists clenched. John's heart falls right out of his mouth and hits the floor. "I'm sorry. I can't believe I… I'm really, really sorry. I don't want to force you into anything."
The look on Molly's face was so pathetic during Sherlock's rebounding flood of observations that John stepped in to defend one of his points; all the same, she gave him a look plainly intended to be pure fury and then ran out of the room. John sighed. "Charming," he said, forcing himself to sound resigned and frustrated rather than secretly thrilled that Sherlock had shut down two hopeful suitors without blinking. "Well done."
John hid a smile - being cast in the role after Sherlock likely meant that this young actor would have to spend a remarkable amount of time shadowing the detective and copying his mannerisms, essentially following Sherlock's every move. Of course the detective counted that as an opportunity to learn how to act properly. "Will's favourite sort of actor," he commented. "Someone young and keen that he can shape to his design."
Mycroft gives him a long, piercing look. "Indeed," he says finally. He taps the umbrella again. "The Duchess of Cambridge sends her thanks."
"It's perhaps not as tidy as it could be," John replied, a tiny smirk lifting the corners of his mouth.
"I… I don't…" he stammers. "It must have – thank you, Mr Holmes. I would never have looked in there again – to think, in my safe-box beside my bed all this time."
Sherlock frowned. "
Behind him, out of his sight, a wall of shadow was advancing on the castle, roiling and charging with a low
"Well… it doesn't really matter. Do you need a lift back to London? I can help you with that. Always wanted to visit 221B Baker Street."
He feigned surprise. "The journal?" he repeated. "Yes, I suppose that would interest Sherlock, if only for the possibility of scientific experimentation. Perhaps he might wish to collect any residual DNA and discover if this

He struggled valiantly as Molly rushed to comfort and restrain him both.
he protested. His bent leg twitched slightly as though he wanted to rise but thought better of it.
Angelo's grin widened. "There's a man downstairs wants to see you, Sherlock," he said, rubbing his meaty hands together. "Says he knows a Lady Brackenstall you might be looking for."
"Not a chance at all," Sherlock murmured, teasingly taking John's earlobe between his lips.
He smiled tightly around a mouthful of ginger and bread. "Several," he replied once his mouth was empty. "But only one I believe to be worth pursuing."
; I arranged to meet Lestrade at the studio at ten. It's difficult to miss if you want to meet there."
"Could we maybe hold the meeting of the Serial Killer Appreciation Society outside of police time?" Lestrade interjected wearily.
he asked, raising a hand to his chest as if to say 'who, me?'.
Even the lovers had stepped up their game, not to be outdone by the fairies; John watched Helena and Demetrius rush past his tenuous hiding place behind a prop. He'd always liked the relationship between the two 'lesser' lovers: it was the less healthy side of obsessive love, the way not everyone fell in love like Lysander and Hermia, with someone who loved them in return, the way Helena followed her hopeless infatuation even into the danger of the forest.
John reaches out for it until both of our hands are closed around it. This suddenly feels a lot more like fighting and I feel claustrophobic, I don't
In that moment, when his mouth fired off something that probably wasn't very nice to the young pathologist and turned away to take a sip of the frankly insipid coffee, he made up his mind. For whatever reason, he couldn't remember John Watson, and the fact that he
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow at the moniker. He was more intelligent than Poe's Auguste Dupin. Joe Grieg had called him that before and he couldn't help but find it slightly insulting, despite the fact that he knew they were trying to compliment him. Apparently nobody had written a clever enough detective character to compare him to. It was almost depressing. "You don't want to come with me?"
John blinked a few times, trying to encourage his friend without being too obvious, but Sherlock didn't continue. "Are you doing anything in the morning?" he asked after a moment of this silence. "We could try more of
The playwright nodded, sympathetic expression back in place. "And he didn't like it. Naturally."

He'd always enjoyed doing this, the intimacy and the total
, he reminded himself, trying not to overact any femininity. He looked expectantly at Sherlock, whose inscrutable eyes flashed dangerously.
Once again, Doctor Watson had caught him by surprise; Julien allowed his eyebrows to lift before assuming his usual politely bemused smile. "May I inquire the occasion for such a gift, Doctor Watson? My collection is not priced for the everyday, and Sherlock's birthday is not until June."
Sherlock shoots him a grateful smile. "Well, the killer seems to like his colours. You so perceptively noted with the first murder that everything was red; he dresses them up in one colour, picks a spot that reflects that colour, etcetera. Rather juvenile, but it seems to work for him – there have been three bodies so far, all women. The first one you already know; it was found in a meat-packer's, decked out in red. The second they found in a tulip bed in the botanical gardens –"
had informed them that Milverton goes to bed without fail at ten-thirty every night and is out like a light. How she knew this, John hadn't bothered to ask.
That was his own face, barely twenty years old, sitting opposite a shock of dark curls and grinning broadly. John couldn't help but wander closer to hear the well-remembered conversation.
He didn't worry that John might think he was in pain and barge in, unsuspecting. The good doctor masturbated enough – one day, John will ask Sherlock how he knew and the detective will smile and look in the other direction – that he knew what the act sounded like, and did he perchance hear a drawn-out groan or two he was British enough to turn beet-red and roll over.
Sherlock nodded in resignation. "Then we'll have to hope we catch them on their way to the funeral. They'll enlist enough people to help them carry that coffin that we should be able to talk over them." Lestrade's eyebrow inched higher in confusion, causing the detective to sigh in frustration. "Peters' mother-in-law's coffin is twice as deep as it needs to be," he reiterated. "The only logical explanation is that they have Lady Carfax after all, and they intend to bury her underneath Peters' mother-in-law."
He took what he wanted because of the ugly, bitter feeling in his stomach raised by Julien's words. It

The Doctor grinned again. "Sorry. Can't tell you my real name – by law, actually - and you wouldn't be able to pronounce it if I could."
In the end, it's three days before both men crack.
Sherlock shook his head. "I just don't quite understand."
Sniggers erupted from the watching cast at Will's indignant shout. Sherlock relaxed as John dropped his hands, a wry smile breaking across his face. "Sorry," John chuckled. "Just trying something."

John frowned; he had thought perhaps the response was simply buried in other people's lines and not visible in the cue-script he had been given. He raised an eyebrow. He couldn't say he was surprised: it wasn't the first play in which Will had done that. He seemed to like drawing attention to the lack of input women had into their own marriages, even after an entire play's worth of romantic build-up.
"Probably." Sherlock unlocked his door and let the other boy in. "Why, are you interested?"

The detective's lip curled upwards into a tiny condescending sneer. "
Her room was dark, the light filtering through the wine-red curtains drenching everything in tainted light. His mother's room had always been a source of nightmares for Sherlock. Nothing except disappointment ever happened to him in there.
"That's it," Will replied calmly. "Is there a problem?"
from someone else, and he couldn't help being the slightest bit miffed that it appeared there was something he wasn't getting from their 'arrangement'.
"But -" he started in surprise, a sharp inhale escaping before he could control his mouth. It was a skilled rendition, and the face was jarringly familiar: the blonde hair and pale skin he'd glimpsed as Mycroft handed it over framed clear blue eyes and rosebud lips curled into a secret, mysterious sort of smile. "That's Lady Brackenstall," he protested, looking up at the detective in confusion.

Sherlock waited until he turned around before wiping the saliva off his cheek with his palm. He personally wouldn't mind if John decided to give every
flitting between them until John made a tiny gesture as if to throw his hands up in surrender and turned away.
"No, that's not possible." John snapped his eyes back to Sherlock's face as he spoke, trying frantically to decipher
"Did she take the maid to Sussex with her?" Sherlock asked quickly, bringing his other hand up to toy with his bottom lip, pinching it between finger and thumb thoughtfully and tugging on it. John tried not to bite his own in response, because he had a feeling that Mycroft would notice the motion and read more into it than it was, the sudden sense memory of other lips beneath his own fingers, his own lips. John had always liked kissing, and Sherlock had objectively lovely lips.
Sherlock scrunched up his face in a grimace. "Mycroft's office," he said, as though each word hurt him. "He has to report to both of us, there's no point in making him do it twice."
"Of course," John said, hiding the little amused smile at the look on the taller boy's face. Apparently he didn't get compliments very often. "It's not something just anyone could come up with, it was really clever and observant."
John allowed his shoulders to slump in time with the playwright's sigh, and crossed to the chair that had been left centre stage from the previous scene.
"I'm not the first one to try to pick that lock," the detective interrupted, withdrawing the instrument and replacing the box in the cupboard. "It wasn't Lady Brackenstall who removed those jewels."
; Sherlock himself was conspicuously absent, and Captain Adler didn't spare John a glance from the empty view screen as he wandered through. The rest of the level seemed to be an amalgam of rooms from the ship, including John's office and med bay, the science laboratories and the engine room, where John was startled and slightly disturbed to find two of Lestrade's senior engineers, Anderson and Donovan, locked in an apparently passionate embrace. Like everyone else in Sherlock's mind, the two appeared not to even register John's presence in the room as he hurriedly ducked back out. He'd known there was
crawled
"No," Sherlock snapped instantly. John had raised the same point and been shot down just as quickly. "I know you're fond of my brother, Lestrade, but there's a very real possibility that he's involved in this. Knowing what we know about the situation -" he glanced meaningfully at John, since they hadn't told Lestrade about the locket they had found for this very reason - "there's a chance that informing Mycroft how close we are to incriminating Peters will be the difference between life and death for both Ladies."
He was hurtling almost startlingly fast towards climax; somewhere, he gained the presence of mind to think about the state of his pants. "Sherlock," he muttered, worming his fingers into the curls and tugging slightly to try and separate their mouths. It backfired; apparently Sherlock liked having his hair pulled, because he moaned again and pressed their mouths together even harder. "
"Um. I don't remember. I'm okay, he'll be done gloating soon." As he says it, Sherlock finishes his high-functioning analysis of why Anderson's new glasses make him look like he's just been hit in the face with a cow pat and turns back to John.
John smiled. He couldn't help but be flattered when Sherlock wanted him around to watch him do simple things that he could just as easily do on his own. "All right," he accepted with a grin. "So Lestrade first, then Angelo's?"
It was two days before the man woke up in hospital, but they phoned Lestrade anyway and he went, half-mad with back pain from the sofa he'd been sleeping on in his sister's flat and the stress of trying to work through it. He took the bus because his wife still had the car, and as he approached reception to ask what room the overdose patient had just woken up in because the nurse who phoned hadn't left a name he
solve high-profile crimes with my mad best friend I never would have believed them. I probably would have thought they were just humouring my overdeveloped sense of adventure."
"My Lady," he said quietly, "we want to help you. Sherlock has no obligation to arrest you, or anyone else that had a hand in this. Lord Eustace was not a nice man. I, for one, am perfectly prepared to believe that his murderer was only trying to protect you. Doing a good deed, even. And Sherlock shares my sympathies. If you tell us everything, we can allow the Constable to believe that this really was an attempted burglary, and that will be the end of it." He smiled as the detective nodded at her.
"Really?" Sherlock challenges, his eyes dancing. John meets his gaze evenly.
"It displays Celia's jealousy over Orlando to great effect," Sherlock said thoughtfully. "And has the potential to highlight the fact that she could have had the same chance with him if Rosalind hadn't been quicker. Like
he continued insouciantly, bumping his hip against John's,
"Well, this ship was built for more than one pilot," Sherlock reasoned. "Judging by the shape of the console and the way you're having to rush around to get us going. Probably more than two pilots, but two still must be better than one, surely?"
John nodded briskly and set off for the kitchen. Sherlock smiled fondly after him. He skimmed his eyes over the rest of the statement – the eyewitness they had interviewed had eventually stopped watching because the pair had seemed to forget they were in public once they started kissing. The dominance of the victim was already clear from the kiss, though. A tiny shiver announced itself up Sherlock's spine, and he followed John into the kitchen.
John frowned and shushed him. "Don't say that, you'll hurt him," he said indignantly. "He tries. I don't think he'll come back to the theatre, though."
He frowned. "I offended you. Why did that offend
The consulting detective hugs the duvet closer to him. "I didn't realise," he says quietly. "I didn't understand, I didn't even think that he would sacrifice himself for his family's reputation like that. But when he said, I… I think I'd do the same, John." His eyes, deadly serious, meet John's. "I'd rather die than live with the knowledge that you thought I was a fraud."

John snorted and let one hand go in order to sit on Sherlock's chest and strap the other to the railing of his headboard. Sherlock found himself almost face-to-face with John's groin and breathed in sharply; John was completely hard, straining against his jeans. He wanted to reach out the hand that John wasn't using and touch it, stroke it, see what noises the doctor might make. He forced himself to breathe out again. Perhaps it was a good thing that John was tying his hands to the headboard.
"Oh! Brilliant, well done you. So you can go back now?"
A rich noise of assent rumbled out of Sherlock's chest as he launched himself to his feet once more. "Best not to keep the good Constable waiting," he said, his nostrils flaring in amusement. "Excuse us, Master Shakespeare."

trouble. John remembered very clearly pulling a couple of burly second-year Gryfindors off him two weeks into his first year as a Prefect. When he'd asked Sherlock if he was all right the boy had shrugged his hand away and stalked off.
Crocker must have known Lady Brackenstall in some capacity, to be confident enough to pretend to be her lover. He knew a lot about her, where she came from, where and when in her life she might have met a lover. But he
His eyes lifted to meet the sparkling green ones opposite him again. Julien was smiling, his hands pressed flat against Sherlock's ribcage, measuring the hammering of his heart.
Sherlock for the moment that he did.
Sherlock looked up sharply.
"Here," Sherlock said after a minute of John's awkward stroking. It was difficult even to touch the other boy the way that he would touch himself with the angle so different. Sherlock drew his hand away gently and used his own to grasp the two of them
He smirked a little, because it had been years since anyone had called him clever and he'd almost forgotten what it felt like. "So, what have you got, then,

Sherlock frowned. "How do you mean?"

That was a big hit and Burbage really wanted it. I couldn't have cared less up to then, but he got quite nasty after that. And then my
that he hadn't noticed their complete change in neighbourhood. The street they were walking down was neatly paved, the sewage running down neatly hewn paths from the elaborate buildings on either side. John whistled. He supposed it shouldn't be surprising, given the way Mycroft had dressed and spoken like he was on first-name terms with the Queen.
The detective narrowed his eyes. "Why would you think that?" he asked.
dregs only in one glass." He held it up to illustrate.
John starts forward, then registers that he's limping and stops to collect himself. It's a goddamn rifle range at a funfair, that's all. He keeps walking, without the limp. "What, are you asking me for your pocket money?" he teases. "Of course you can have a go."
gay bars."
The knowledge that they could have been doing this for six months made John dizzy. He joined Sherlock on the sofa and pulled the younger student's mouth back towards him. Sherlock made a sort of strangled whine and scrambled up until he was straddling John's lap, almost bending double in order to compensate for his height. The possibilities of this arrangement occurred to John in a dazed rush; with a groan he replaced his hands around Sherlock's hips and pulled him closer, lifting his hips to grind their groins together. The sudden and irrefutable proof that Sherlock was just as hard as he was from their snogging sucked the breath from his lungs. "I think there's some clichéd line I'm supposed to say about that," he muttered, resting his forehead against the pure-blood's.
For anyone who might be stuck in the storm over in England, I wish you the best of luck and hope you're all right.
, and it felt surprisingly nice, so he took the opportunity to rock his pelvis forward and mash their erections together. The teacher gasped into Sherlock's mouth and he swallowed the sound eagerly.
"Inspiration," he commented sagely. He turned towards Sherlock, expecting to meet with a sarcastic comment and then depart together.
that couldn't really be anything else. "That's… do you do that all the time?"
I've come to realise that I was being a tad ambitious when I requested that we go back to the way we were. It's not John, even though there have been a few times where I've looked at him and he's been looking at me and I know that he's thinking about what happened between us and it's electric, as though some kind of static is pulling us together like when you rub a balloon over someone's hair. But he's doing admirably. It's

Lestrade hurried after them, grabbing at Sherlock's arm to hold him back. "Who
Lestrade?" Sherlock repeated, a touch of irritation colouring his rich voice.
"They didn't follow the rest of the crew when they beamed back," John told him. "We don't think they can survive in the ship's air. If you can just force them out of your mind, they'll die."
"I can get the door open or keep it shut against the Judoon, but it's encrypted in Old Atraxi. It's a trip system. If I get even one character of the coding wrong, the entire tunnel explodes and collapses and whatever's in there is burned and destroyed."

"Even so," Lestrade persisted. "Might we sit down? This is my assistant, Sally Donovan, and Sherlock Holmes and his colleague John Watson, they're consulting for me with this case."
When he came down, he sat up shakily to see the other boy spitting into his rubbish bin. He'd expected something like that; he couldn't imagine it would taste very nice. Julien looked up at him, but he was smiling. "Unusual," the boy criticised slowly. "Bitter."
She nodded again, but this time she was looking intently at Sherlock with a tiny smile at the edge of her mouth. "Not easy, is it," she said sadly. Sherlock wondered what part of it she was talking about, the indignation at the way John was so willing to
He's punished for his sarcasm by one of Mycroft's tight, sardonic, patronising smile. John wonders sometimes how many years of his life he spent perfecting that look. "I merely came to question your involvement in last night's Hampshire murder."
