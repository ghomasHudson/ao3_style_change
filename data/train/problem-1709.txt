"...Fine. He has helped me when I was high, he made sure I wasn't doing drugs when I left the house the other evening, he agreed to go to the therapy session with me, he offered to help me by saying he would be my doctor, he stood up for me, he made sure I was eating." I mumble into my cup.
"Not 'or', Little Brother, 'and' is correct; he likes both men and women, bisexual. Smoker, fingers are coloured orange from where he holds it, as are his lips. Has 3 grand children, 2 children of is own however, 1 now, the other died. Hates his job so, he takes his chance to get with people. Clearly, his relationship with his wife is bad. Yes, wife, picture of woman in a photo on his car keys, not daughter, too old, too new, daughter was the one who died any way so, he has a son. Your turn."
"Let's get on with it then." I begin kissing his neck, nipping at a bit of skin. Then, I suck, hard. He moans and grips me harder. I keep sucking, with my teeth and coating it with some saliva. He's so delicious. I look at my handy work, yes, my John. My mark meaning he's mine. No, he isn't mine, remember, friends. I kiss the spot where I had been sucking and John shudders. My right hand travels down his body and stops at his waist band on his trousers, I lift up the band and I let go, allowing it to snap against John's lower abdomen. He moans with pain and pleasure. My fingers snake under the band and I can feel John's hard, throbbing member, in my hand.
the pain, hehe. Ya know that guy who came in earlier? Wiggins? He is my therapist but, they come at a price if you want to fell better~ hehe." What the hell is he on about?
"I don't have to justify my actions to you, Watson! Leave me to my own devices, I know what I'm doing and I know why I a doing it so, why do you need to know?!" I snap.
"It is. What happened, I must've drank too much please, explain what happened. My memory can only serve me to a certain extent... I can remember faintly, having some food with you and judging by the smell in the kitchen, it was noodles. Also, there is some whiskey on the counter, almost empty. I must've eaten in the lounge because that is where my bowl remained. So, enlighten me."
"Are you seriously this dense?!" I take in a deep breath to calm myself down and whisper 'ok' under my breath. "Unbutton your shirt, Mycroft..." I say calmly.
"Good night, Mycroft." He walks away and I hear the door shut and the foot steps descending down the stairs.
"You want to see if I really have sentiment towards John as The Woman told you I do." I blurt. "You want me to save him."
"Awwww, John, you jealous I wasn't with youuuuu~~~." The drunk boy drawls. I sigh and shake my head.
"How- how do you know my name?" He rolls his eyes at my comment and carries on, attempting, to tie his tie up.
? They aren't useful and irrelevant in helping with my school work, why listen to something that has already been muted?" I begin making my tea.
"How will we go about this? I can't get into a relationship because, as much as I would love to do that, I can't get attached to people as you know I have enemies; Moriarty etc..." He pulls his underwear the rest of the way up and sits back down on the bed.
"No, we haven't fallen out, he's just... out with another friend. That doesn't mean we aren't going either."
"No, you're going to have a nap plus, it gives me time to take a rest as well. If you don't rest, I won't and you always go one about how I need to take a break."
"Some of these scars they look like they came from a syringe or a pin or something, what are they?" I inquire. He gives a little chuckle.
"Thank you. How would you know what isn't sentiment? Since when can you detect what isn't love?" He grabs his cup and saucer and pours the dilated tea and watches it mix with the sugar.
"You want to test me. You want to see whether I will leave John and save myself or die for John or save him, there are multiple out comes and multiple ways to find those out comes in a plethora of different ways. However, you are looking for just one in order to get what you want, the information you need."
"licence, please." And just like that, I walk out the shop with the whiskey and stationary. I make my way back to the flat. Eventually, I arrive back at 221b. I slam the door behind me and I head up the stairs. I enter the flat and I check the clock, 7:58. John is in his chair eating instant noodles.
"Yep, that's what embarrassment is, John. Have you forgotten who you're talking to? I'm your best friend. I am in need of some assistance, I would help you too, even if it is this situation. It is aching, I need some kind of thing to help this rising feeling. Google won't give me release." I see John groan and sigh heavily. "Please."
"Mycroft! Open up your eyes! Mother doesn't give a shit about us! She says she does but, in reality she's scared, she's a coward, she's isn't bothered! Father! Oh, don't even get me started on
"Good, let's get ready then." I smile. He smiles back in confusion and walks away. My smile drains away and I sigh.
"Shhhhh... be quiet you imbecile... if you don't shut the fuck up, you'll die, ok?" They whispers. Are they going to... kill me? Why me, I've done nothing wrong?! I can hear voices, children's voices, my age.
"Oh, don't play dumb, Sherlock. You couldn't see pleasure even if it came up to you and shot you in the head. That's why you have Johnny Boy and I can see why you keep him, army boy, right? I bet he's rough isn't he and,
"Yes. Like, no signs of love affection if we are in a public place. We, more like you, can have relationships with other people without either of us being jealous. No hard feelings if we are unable to actually go out. And finally, we keep doing what we did today because honestly, I thoroughly enjoy seeing all of your beautiful body and I do find your moans delightful and there is more to your body I wish to look at and try."
"Well, if you must know my friend here wasn't too happy in middle school when you damaged him so, he wanted revenge and obviously I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see my loyal play thing so, I'm here to even things out between us, call it a token of my affection." His Irish accent rolls off his tongue like a python. I look him over, there is something in his trouser pocket.
"You are going to school, Sherlock." Mycroft says sternly, throwing the sheets to the floor. This is the kind of things Mycroft does to piss me off. I get up out of bed and look him dead in the eyes.
"Are you quite done, Little Brother?" I sigh, rubbing my eyes as I return back into my chair. "Good. Listen, Sherlock, I understand your concern but, you know we don't have a say because you know what happens if you are to say anything. In fact, you know that punishment very well.
Is this what karma is? I wanted some fun because school is boring and now I'm messing with fire. I have to go, or else who know what would happen. I take another drag of my cigarette. The woman... he hired her... why. Later. I need to go back to John; he'll be suspicious.
"You know what I've noticed about you, Sherlock?" He asks, placing his head back to- near enough- his original position.
"You're here, with me, you're not dead, you are a living, breathing, organism. You keep all these normal human functions inside you and it's unhealthy. You may not be dead now, but you are killing yourself slowly!"
"You will live there for however long it takes for you to stop being addicted. Even if it means for you to stay there until graduation." He states sternly.
"Then, I think those 4 hours closer need to come sooner." I groan into the sheets. John huffs and changes the subject.
I walk over to the sleeping boy and I sit next to him. I put my hand in Sherlock's hair, it's so soft and curly, I love it.
"Commonnnnn nghhhhh lets go upsairssss." unimpressed, I help Sherlock up the stairs to the flat. As we get through the door, he becomes lively and runs towards the large sofa and jumps on it. "Let'ssss play, John! I'll be the pirate and youuuuuu, haha, you can be my right-right hand man! Cast the sails, John!" I know this shouldn't be funny in the slightest but, seeing him like this, out of his usual introverted, typical teenage grumpiness, is actually quite amusing. I can't help but laugh a little bit behind my hand. Sherlock jumps off the sofa and lunges towards me, stopping a fraction away from me. He just looks at me in confusion and tilts his head from left to right, looking at me from up to down.
"You know everything! You knew you needed to meet this son of a bitch here! You said he gave you an invitation! Did you want to see me get blown into fucking smithereens!?"
"Yes, her. Turns out we'll be staying with her while we attend the school because of how far it is away from our house. We couldn't go to any other school as there are non close by so, Baker Street Middle is the closest. We have to arrive there at school by 8:30am." I check the alarm clock, IT'S BLOODY 6:37 am!
"You know what happened in middle school, Mycroft. You wouldn't understand what he can do..." Just thinking of what happened makes me feel queasy, it never happened to my brother, he was never bullied. He builds reputations and a social standing and yet, keeps people distant, like they don't mean anything to him. However, me, on the other hand, I don't want people to get too close to me, I have the odd person here and there, who I actually like but, even then, I keep them distant. People are difficult, too much work and effort and... pain. I prefer being alone. Mother and father think I have something wrong with me because of my constant distant attitude to them and sadness and therefore, sends to me therapy. I want to leave but, they say 'It's for the best, Sherlock.' Some days I like going there, other days I don't, it all depends. I go there once every 3 weeks so, not too often.
"Because sometimes they can occur when thinking about something or someone that they find sexually arousing."
"I know~." He sings, he doesn't even sound like he's been crying anymore. He just sounds... drunk. I help him through the corridor. His bed room door is still locked.
"No." I get up and grab my coat and scarf. "I'll get rid of you once and for all." I wrap my scarf around my neck.
What is he doing to me? I'm feeling things that I had numbed myself to feel yet, this boy is breaking that barrier down. This can't happen, I need to stay distant, alone, to myself. But, I don't want to hurt him, to lose him... he's making it hard for me to stay away from him. This is something I've avoided for all my life and it's all crumbling down before me and I'm watching it happen. I'm LETTING it happen. I have to say this but, dare I say... Mycroft... might be right... I'm giving into sentiment, I'm getting too attached. I can't. I won't. I... I don't want to lose him.
"I have called our doctor and he has recommended for you to go to a therapist near by, Little Brother. It's a group therapy where other children come with similar problems as you go and you talk about your problems." Mycroft says, tapping on his phone. I groan.
"Hi~~. Fancy seeing you here, Sherly." The well dressed boy cooed. I stay silent. "Oh? Is little, Sherlock nervous? Did you miss me, while I was gone?" I cough, clearing my throat, standing up. Analysing the guard and where his organs are placed I try a figure out a plan of action. Distract Moriarty, strike legs to trip him up, gives me time to take out the guard. He would start attacking, lunges forward,
I can't believe I'm standing outside of Baker Street High. It's a public school but, their ratings from Ofsted are brilliant! My Sister said I wouldn't get in, but look at me now! John Watson, in the prestigious, notorious, Baker Street High! The uniform looks great, navy jumper; silk shirt; red and green tie; comfortable black, cotton trousers and (to top it of) leather, black, shoes. The main gate is so, large and mysterious and-
! He hurts us, Mycroft! Not out of love, not because he 'accidentally' punches us, pulls a knife out on us, strangles us, lashes us with his belt, burns us with his cigarettes! He purposely does it! You are such an idiot!" My breathing is heavy and rapid, my pulse is racing, my vision is fuzzy almost, blurred. Everything comes into focus and I can see my bother sitting back and just staring me, with a bored expression.
"Bye." I hear him call as I rush down the stairs and exit the house. Ok, I have my knife in case he tries anything. The air is quite warm to night, that's unusual for Britain, not that I have any complaints. This is weird, though, maybe he wants to talk about the woman to me but, what information did she collect and why are they obsessed with me and John? They're probably trying to get to me.
"W-what are you doing?" I demand an answer. He just shushes me and tells me to hold still once again, I do as told and keep still. He curves around me and again, meeting me back into the same stance as he was before. Then he puts a hand on my shoulder, tightening his grip slightly and staring intently at it. He then does the same with his other hand but, this one is on my right, hand, shoulder. His hands slowly drift down my arm, slowly, slowly. I just look at him confused at how intently he's looking at his hands move. My face goes warm as his hands reach mine, he lifts them up to his face height. Shortly, after examining them, he puts my left arm down and keeps my right hand, holding my arm with his left hand. Slowly, his right hand goes up and he intertwines his fingers with mine. His hands are cold and thin but, yet, I like... it, how he holds my hand. My face is clearly red and confused. He looks away from mine and his hands to look at me. God, his eyes look dark even though, his eyes are usually a pale blue, they look distant. To stop myself from getting redder I look away from him at our hands, this must be a dream, what is he doing? This isn't Sherlock. It can't be, he must be really drunk, too drunk, too know what he's doing. I look at his hand when, something catches my eye, his sleeve is slightly rolled up and I can see something, it looks like a cut or scar or something. My curiosity gets the best of me so, I roll his sleeve the rest of the way up. What I see is shocking. I look at him then back down at his arm then, back to him.
"If you really want to get involved with relationships then, why not go and look for sentiment elsewhere because there is nothing amorous nor romantic going on between us in anyway."
The bell for lunch rings after 3rd lesson, biology. She wasn't in that lesson but, she was in my second lesson, English, John sits elsewhere in that lesson, he sits next to her while, I have to sit next to Donovan, that idiot. I don't speak to her, she would lower my IQ by the second if I do. John meets me out side my locker and he is accompanied with
"To hell with me! Me, later; you, now." I run my finger along his cock and it's still painted with his semen, perfect! I lean down and lick along the head of it all the way to his pubic hairs. He is squirming above me and I feel his hands grab my head, I keep licking in stripes. Until, I move my head down and take John into my mouth. His hands grip into my hair.
"Fine. I'll stay, Sherlock." His face lights up to those words, he looks like a child at Christmas. I it on the other side of the bed taking my socks off. I go to take my shirt off however, I stop, I can't do that it'll be wrong.
however, there is no alarm clock there and the alarm keeps beeping. I hiss in pain from hitting the table I locate where it is coming from, it's on the other bed side table but, it's a phone... not mine... neither is this bed... and who is that next to me? I lift the covers away from their face... IT'S JOHN!!!
I try and push the event out of my mind and turn back to my news paper, reading the sports section. I drink my tea. I whistle a tune. I turn the pages. Yet, it's still in my mind! I get up and grab my empty cup of tea mug and go to the kitchen to get anther one, turning the kettle on my curiosity runs, what are they doing. It's been half an hour. Fuck it.
"I-... Sherlock, I want to say, I forgive you. I understand now, after spending some time with Stamford, that I know you aren't that kind of man. No matter how bad you may seem to the public, you aren't a bad lad."
"Allow me to give you a demonstration." He sighs. Before I know it he's pressing his lips against mine. Hard, rough. It feels intriguingly wrong . He grabs my hand and wraps around his back, trying to deepen the kiss. He moves his body to sit on my lap, wrapping his legs around my waist. Just like that night with... John. John. This isn't John but, I can't show Moriarty that I want him. I want John... this wouldn't ruin mine and John's friendship or my chances with him... will it? I feel like I'm betraying him, like I'm enjoying Moriarty's touch more than I would with John, am I being unfaithful? No, we aren't even going out... but, I want to-O
"You know small talk is awfully tedious." I groan, removing his hand from my leg. "Keep your hands to yourself."
"What game, Brother Dearest?" He replies. Mycroft loves games, he always has but, not the normal games, he enjoys
The bell has gone for the beginning of form time with our tutor called Mr Smith, Culverton Smith, I don't like him, not at all. There's something about him that makes me feel uneasy and on edge. I shake it off as just growing up hormones however, I'm still going to keep an eye on him anyway. He doesn't make us do any work or activities in form so usually we just talk. Me and john sit in our places next to each other, Molly opposite John and Donavan and Anderson to the left of me on the other side of the table. Mr Smith is at the front of the class doing the register but, the thing that catches my eye is that there is someone standing next to him, a female.
"Not that I would like this conversation now but, I have a door to knock down because I need to get changed for school now, if you excuse me." I get up and walk out the room with my jeans, shirt and jacket, socks and shoes in my hand. I manage to knock the door down and get into my room to get changed.
"I know just the amount it will take until I will forget tomorrow. 4- 5 glasses. So, begin." I pour my first glass full and I swallow half of it down. "Wow, good stuff. Come on spit it out." I drink the rest of the glass and I pour another one.
"Hahahaha you look but you do not observe. Watson, hahaha. Why do you think I'm here? Hahaha, my mother doesn't give a shit about me or my brother hahaha! My Father hits us haha burns us ahaha kicks us, throws us, ahahaha hahahaha and he even uses us as an hahaha ash tray!" So, he and his brother are abused... how do I respond to this? My friend, the person who doesn't care about anyone or anything, who seems like the most strong willed person on this earth, has just proven that he does care about people and things and that even he has weak spots and can be venerable sometimes and all that has just been proven to me by him having too much to drink.
friend die?! I was scared, for the first time in ages, I've been scared to the fact I can't function! John, I would never forgive myself, if you got hurt or worst! I would be worst than I am and I would probably be in a drug den, off my tits from meth and I'll probably die of an overdose, just so I could forget! So, don't you ever thing I would ever want to see you die! Or even think of the sight of it!"
"6:49. We should get our things ready, just pack the essentials and anything you want to occupy you. This includes school bag, books, pencil case etc." He lists monotonously. I let out a long groan and move my fingers and my thumb up and down mockingly.
We walk outside together and John is talking to me about what happened in his maths lesson. I, obviously, don't listen because my mind is set on having another cigarette, I'm bored... it's boring here, nothing interesting is happening! I need excitement!
"That's good. You'll be going to school in a minute so, be ready you two." She says. "Oh! I almost forgot! There will be another child here the same time as you two, he has just started staying here because his Father is a doctor in the military and at the moment he is in Afghanistan fighting in the war as a medic. So, he is staying here, he will be coming here after school. If you two want to find him at school his name is John Watson. He knows about you two so, maybe he'll find you first." She chuckles. I am intrigued, a soldiers son?
"I doubt that's the only thing that happened however, forgive me, I will try to restrain myself next time. If there is a next time."
"Just sit on the bloody bed!" He snaps at me. Looking at him, I comply sitting on the edge of the bed. He goes in between my legs and starts scrubbing at the patch of tea. I look down at him, his dirty blond hair looks more soft up close than from a distance, it almost makes me want to touch it. His slightly tanned skin looks so soft yet rough on his hands, cheeks, neck and some on his forearm of his left arm from, what appears, to be cuts and bruises from where his bullies beat him up. Something about seeing those inflicted marks sets off pangs of anger. On top of that anger, there's an unknown, tight feeling in my chest that feels like it's rising to my throat, almost suffocating me. I just cough a bit to try and get rid of it, it helps slightly but, not for long as John accidently brushes off my inner leg near... near my...my...
"No wonder Sherlock isn't asleep." He laughs. "This is twice now, John, you seriously need to control yourself."
"Well, I've died long since I was bought onto this pitiful, loathsome, disgusting parasite of a planet!" I sneer.
"I only know one person who wears lipstick that red, Sherlock..." He doesn't sound angry, he just sounds sad.
"Because, Sherlock! I care! I'm worried, I'm scared, I'm- I'm so confused!" He shouts back at me. I rub the bridge of my nose and sigh aloud.
"Thank you. Anyway, I'll be back later." I get up and head for the door and I grab my wallet and a hat, forgetting about my coat and scarf.
"HAHahahaha! Busy last night were you, Little Brother!? HAgahahahah, since when do you give into sentiment?!" He roars. I just sigh and put my head into my hands, not in embarrassment but, in pity for John, it
After 10 minutes of getting my essentials together, I go to find Mycroft. I find him in the kitchen, sitting at the table eating Cornflakes.
have you been doing?!" I raise my voice but, then quickly remembering the other people in this house.
do you know my name?!" I snap, walking toward him until, I'm face to face with him. Well, chin to face, he's slightly taller which doesn't make me look intimidating to him at all. He sighs.
"Since the day you were born, Sherlock. You say you aren't human and you don't have feelings but, in fact you do. Whether you like it or not."
"Thank you, Sherlock." John stutters into my neck, he seems really worked up, maybe this meant a lot to him... Feeling his breath on my neck makes me feel weird again but, this time it's more like a... fuzzy feeling. I can't describe it however, it feels... nice...
Sherlock introduces his friend to John. John doesn't know who he is but, when Sherlock goes missing for hours on end John gets worried about his whereabouts. However, when he does come back, John isn't ready to see the person he had become.
"I want you to know how much I love you because you are so kind and so helpful and you are always there for me and I will always be there for you. You probably don't like me back because of how many times I have fallen out with you but, it was because I was scared. I was scared of you rejecting me and only using me only for the fact that you had to."
"I'll answer all later, Watson. It's time for school. We'll speak after school, at Mrs. Hudson's house. Come along!" I start walking and I hear his voice shout behind me.
"Trust me, John, the last thing I would do is give into sentiment to other people. Plus turns out, I'm gay anyway so, that just proves my point more." I smile, rubbing the rest of the lipstick off my face.
"I did this mainly to gain the information needed, which I've collected effortlessly. However, if you would like me to help you, I'm happy to do so." He sounds bored, almost as if I was no pleasure what so ever. How dare he think I am disappointing, he thinks I'm not man enough! I shove him on his back and I pin him down.
"What are you thinking about, Mycroft?" I ask without notice. He hums and still sits still, I roll my head back in boredom until, an idea springs to mind. "Wanna play a game, Brother?" I purr. Now that attracts his attention.
"Good boy. I should give you a reward. I'm not going to kill John..." He backs away from John and puts his hands in the air showing he's unarmed. I run towards John and I try and undo the bomb with success and I slip the bomb away.
After, I walked into the lounge to greet John, he is on his easy chair drinking a cup of tea and playing on his phone.
sit next to each other and I sit opposite. I feel weird about this situation, it makes me uneasy, it makes me worried...
"Is that a pocket knife you've got there, or are you just happy to see me?" I ask playfully serious.
"Nothing, I'm- I'm fine." Trying to keep calm I take a deep breath in and out. Stop, feeling this. It's highly annoying she's making me feel. I manage to compose myself and return to my regular posture. John just shrugs it off and continues with his sandwich.
"Mhmhhh that's always good." He nods with a smile back however, his smile disappears at the acknowledgment of my statement. "Wait! Hold on!"
"Wrinkled face, clearly in his 40's. Bags under his eyes, lack of sleep, not driving, however, because he doesn't look stressed. So, must be because his sex life is good, different women or men though, even though he's married to a female, because his wedding ring is in the cup holder therefore picks up people who call the cab. Your turn."
"Enough of that, Sherlock is drunk in his bedroom go look for yourself." He walks into Sherlock's bedroom. I follow him as I walk in I see Sherlock standing up on the bed and taking off his clothes.
"Because... you're a fucking asshole, Sherlock!" I shout before, I throw myself towards him and hug him. "And that's why I can't lose you! Why, Sherlock... Why do you do this?!" I plead. He doesn't respond, his arms don't move from his sides.
I cringe at the note and open the fridge with disgust. After I poured the milk into the bowl of cereal, I return it back to the fridge, ripping the post-it off it and returned with it and the bowl back to the table.
"Then, don't watch, sleep, here, next to me." A large blush creeps up on my face, I try to cover it with my hand and I look away.
"Yes but, I wont tell Mycroft about it, I don't think it's ok to tell him... it's about what you said to me..."
"No he has a husband, clearly. In that picture you see, that is his sister, not wife. Why would he have a picture of his wife on his keys if he wants to get with other people? Also, if you looked at his right ring finger, the finger, some, gay couples have their ring on, it is slightly lighter tone than the rest of his hand. Children were adopted. Your turn.
"I'm not thick. And… that's bad? I wouldn't want anyone else to help me. I, in fact, …" Come on say it, he'll help you if you say it. You'll get the release you need. "I
"Funny... you said the same thing last night when I told you ' Its ok'." He says, sipping again at his tea.
"John, I do not like where this is going, I do not give into sentiment however, that is an area where you fail to full fill. Now just leave me be." I shout whispering in his ear. He pushes me away and sakes his head.
"I'm not, okay?! I was scared, John! I thought I was going to lose my first friend- my only friend- m-my best friend! You think I'm that sadistic that I want to see my
"Well you've just confirmed my suspicions. In my opinion, Mr Holmes, you aren't straight. Your actually gay." She reaches into her pocket pulling out some lipstick. "Thank you, Sherlock. I can leave John alone now, you've made this easier." Her lips make a pop sound.
"Follow my finger." He waves his finger from side to side. I follow it as instructed. "Let me smell your breath."
"No. I'm putting my foot down, John, I'll wake you up, I promise. Do it for me... please..." I hear him sigh.
"Please~, call me Irene, John." He voice is like velvet yet, he words are like a python, suffocating me slowly and purely, both at the same time. She looks almost intimidating.
"I hope you sleep well, Sherlock. I'll be in the other room if you need me." He just hums and I walk away towards the door. "G'night, Sherlock." I pull the door behind me until, a shout stops me.
John and I haven't spoken after that night, it's been 2 days. The only point we've spoken was when I asked him if he wanted tea and then, he only gave me a hum in approval. I haven't seen Moriarty at school since, either, he's up to something and that has to be my main priority at the moment, not the social side of things, I must stay on track and in control.
"Cross my heart." The room goes silent, me and john still embraced. I shift my head a bit to try and look at him. He's asleep, I knew he was tired, probably due to school and looking after me. I shuffle over to the edge of the bed to retrieve the duvet and I lay down slowly, aligning my head with the pillow, John, still on my chest. I manage to lie down and lay the covers on top of us and I relax. Finally, my back won't kill me anymore, I might as well go on my phone for a bit before I rest also. I grab my phone out my trouser pocket and I turn it on, a message pops up on the home page, as I begin to type the password. As soon as I enter my phone, I open up my messages and click on the number.
"Sure you're not... to bed now." I start pushing him towards his bedroom, damn it, we need to fix his door. I push him onto his bed. I hear the door knock. "One moment please!" I quickly rush back into the lounge and I sit onto my chair however, I notice my 'problem.' SHIT- what do I do to hide this, uh uh uh uh uh... news paper! I grab the newspaper and I put it on my lap. "Come in!" The person opens the door to reveal, Mycroft. "What are you doing up here so late?"
"Ughhhhh, it's not going to sort anything out, John! There's no need for me to go, no person can make me any different to how I am now."
"Don't make say the same sentence again, I swear to fucking god! NOTHING IS EVER OK! IT WILL NEVER BE OK!" John jumps at the loudness of my voice. I just sigh and storm off into my bedroom. Just before I'm gone I hear john breath:
"Yes it is, if she can't handle it then, she is too sensitive for her own good. Blazer?" I keep 2 conversations at once to save time.
"Not until you get dressed for school!" I push him back to get him away from it however, he comes towards me and pushes me on my bed. There's no way I can beat him unless, he's off his guard- which he obviously isn't. He pins me on my bed, he holds my arms above my head and his legs are pushing mine on my bed. I try to struggle out of his grip yet, my attempts are useless as he has a much stronger grip on me than I assumed. A crooked grin is on his face and he chuckles under his breath. "Look at you~, a little child, who can't even fight his brother. You were always the weaker one~~." His voice is soft yet, feels like an out of tune violin played by a person who doesn't know how to play. I show my teeth at him but, then I realize as I look at him more clearer, he has lost 2 pounds since I examined him last. Soft point, self conscious of his weight so, he tries losing it. Probably because I'm so thin and spindly and the children at the hell that manipulates children's brains, called school, are commenting about him. In my personal opinion he is quit fit and healthy and his weight shouldn't be an issue however, I will not lose against my brother.
"A past client of mine works in the Shard lets me onto the observation deck whenever I like would you like?" The words fall out of Sherlock's mouth as if aided by gravity and he wonders if John, all the way down there, can see the flush he feels creeping up his neck. ("I totally did," John murmurs a month later. "Oh you did not," Sherlock whispers back.)
"Hello to you too, John. I came to return Sherlock's phone. He ran out earlier and I was going to return it then however, I became distracted and so, here I am. Where is he?"
Mycroft and I arrive at Baker Street High however, we are early so, we have to stay inside the gates until the time is 8:30; at the moment it is 8:10. We are sitting on the benches together, I -with my legs crossed- and him -on his phone- texting someone. I close my eyes and my mind begins to whizz about like hundreds of bees in a swarm. Yet, one thought stops in my mind... John Watson. I suppose he wont be hard to spot, he'll probably be taking similar subjects as me. I assume he will take double science, Health and social care and biology or, maybe Physics. On the other hand, Biology is more likely. I'm taking double science, French and Chemistry. So, we will be in double science together maybe, he'll be in my English class together and maths. Wait- wait, why do I care? It's not like he'll like me anyway, he might even bother finding us. Every kid I've ever met has hated me, to the point where- no I'm not going to think about that.
I turn out the kitchen and go down the corridor leading to Sherlock's room door. I put me ear on the door. I hear mumbling, I cant hear their voices fully just some words, then silence. I stay like this for another 10 minutes with no avail of voices. I lose hope of getting anything else but, that's odd. Why would they be sitting in silence for this long? The kettle had boiled long while before so, I turn it on again and make another cup of tea. I return into the lounge and sit in my chair before I sit down my phone buzzes in my pocket, Sherlock. I open the message.
"What is it, brother Dear!" I shout before he can knock on the closed door. It opens and Mycroft enters the room.
"What is it, Sherlock!" John groans from in the kitchen. He walks into my room shortly after. "I was just about to make food."
"Sorry, Sherlock! I promised him I could let him do whatever he wants when we arrive so, I think if you just sit through this one, it'll go aloooot quicker." He smiled. I scowl, looking down.
"Of course, slow means I will have you longer." I walk to him, slipping my coat off and then, my scarf. My right hand reaches his stomach and it snakes to his back, tracing over his curves. My other hand does the same however, lower; his hip. My left hand is cupped gently on his ass. I pull him closer, pushing his body against mine, sharing our body heats. His hands wrap around my neck, bringing our faces closer, closer still, until I feel his breath upon my skin. I admire his eyes, his lips, his cheeks, his neck, all of him. He is so unique and I want to explore every part of him. Before I know it, our lips attach and we start slowly kissing until, the kiss becomes more wanting and hungry and I accidentally moan into John's mouth. He doesn't seem to care, he seems like he enjoyed it more than anything. Interesting, stimulation to unspoken praise and noises. The way our bodies are positioned isn't enough for me, I need to explore more. I pick him up and carry him into my room and he lies down on my bed and I tower over him, kissing him again. Eventually, our tongues intertwine and I begin unbuttoning his shirt and I force it to come off. He shuffles his trousers off at the same time. I exit the kiss to look at him.
"Please, Sherlock, be safe, ok? Be back at 9:30. 10 at the latest." Why does he care all of a sudden?
Mycroft lets out a sigh of frustration and grabs a small pile of clothes, folded into a square shape. He throws them into my arms and grabs another pile of clothes.
"I can sort it later, if you begin now, you'll end up burning the whole flat down so, I suggest you don't."
"Do you mind if I try it?" I look at it expand into a long, thin string as I extend my index finger away from my thumb.
"Boys!" We hear a third voice interrupt. We both look at John, turns out we both stopped walking and Mycroft and I are face to face. We just begin walking again and John scurries behind to catch up again. "Listen, I don't mind coming with Sherlock to- whatever it is. I can keep an eye on him, make sure he tells me where he's going and who he has round the flat. However, as his brother, Mycroft, this should be your job."
"Looks like we have French together, Holmes. Would you mind escorting me there~?" Her breath is minty fresh, it hits my nostrils like a bullet to the head. I flinch to look at her.
"He'd be dead in an abandoned building." John looks at me as he heard the word 'dead'. I keep my head down, snarling to myself. "That's why he makes a list of all the drugs he's had because that day he was shaken up and I hope it'll be a lesson learnt to him."
is he packing more than just a pistol." He edges closer to John, breathing over his shoulder next to his cheek. "Do you get him to beg John? Or is it the other way round, does he get you on all fours~?"
"Shhhh, shush... shshshsh." He shushes. His right hand raps around my waist and his left hand grabs my hand. He intertwines his fingers with mine, keeping them lowered. He backs me against the counter and brings his hand, that is holding mine, above my head and he pushes it against the cabinets. He keeps his grip on my waist.
"Oh get over yourself, John! Just look for god sake!" I snap. His eyes drop to my trousers and immediately chokes back a laugh.
"Yes, yes it really was. Has anyone told me about you? How did you know any of these things?" He asks, naming list after list of questions.
"Sherlock..." My vision becomes blurred and glossy, tears roll down my cheeks, my mouth tastes like blood and my face is red hot. Why, Sherlock. How did I not know?!
"Stop it! Just stop it, Sherlock! Where is your list!" He snaps, John just looks at us weirdly. I groan and grab my jeans from the other night and retrieve a piece of paper.
Lesson is boring. They're literally teaching me things I already know! Maths is so boring. I'm sitting next to a class moron, who I don't even know. It pisses me off to think that teachers give us seating arrangements. John isn't in top set with me, he's in second set, however. The bell finally goes and I'm out of there as soon as it does, the teacher tells the others to clean the room up but, I don't stay around for that, I just rush to put my things into my next lesson, English, and I go to John's maths room to wait for him because he stays to clean up most the things in the class. I lean against the wall and look at some other students walking past from some of the other classes. I huff bored of waiting for John. Before I manage to stop leaning against the wall, someone runs into me and he leaves as soon as he came, I, on the other hand, am on the wall again, holding onto the bricks to stop myself from falling over.
He only just gets my hint of where I'm looking before, he pulls his arm away, jumping back and hogging it like a prised possession. I look pitifully at him, did he do them? I walk to wards him cautiously, trying not to scare him.
It has been a month since me and John had attended the same school together and lived in the same house. So far I've met some people, some I can tolerate others, I despise. On my good list I have Molly Hooper, a girl in all of my science classes, she isn't the most good at conversations however, I have no place to talk in that area. Then, I have Lestrade, he's a strong minded fellow, not really at my level of intelligence but, still a good speaker at that, he's in my form room, English class and one of my science classes; Physics. Stamford as well, I don't talk to him often but, he's a good source for information as he's more of a background character who can slip around easily, getting useful information. To finish off the list, there is, of course, John. I've learned a lot about John, not just his past or his everyday routine but, his personality. It is compelling and interesting. His independent vibe, the strong, self assured stance, even though at times he can be very clueless and a fumbling idiot, he could actually come into use some time, some day.
I turn my phone off and look up at the ceiling, hearing another two messages ping on my phone. My curiosity over runs me and I unlock my phone and read the messages.
"See you later, Sherlock~~." And she's gone. I stand there in shock. She works for Moriarty. How did I not know that? He's planning something, something big.
"You're hiding something. If this wasn't a convenient time then, it could've waited till the morning."
"Uncharacteristic? Sherlock, you have every characteristic I can think of, what can be out of character for you?" I place my hand on his hair, tangling my fingers into each strand. "...except... that...." Taking a deep breath in and out I cough.
"I don't care anymore, John. It's pointless to dwell on something so insignificant in my life." I blow on my drink to cool it.
"Don't worry, good sir, thank you for your time." I thank as his phone starts beeping from another call. "You better get that, sir, you have a business to run here wouldn't want your boss or, worst, your husband to have...
"How about deductions?" I smile. "A pound bets I can win~." A large grin on my face forms as does one on his face.
Fuck... my head... I feel so dizzy, I feel sick and tired. My eyes are heavy as I open them, my vision is blurred and unclear. I'm in my bed. How? I only remember going out last night to the shops for... uh I think booze and... what's the time?... Where is my phone?! I need to find it. I get up out my bed and walk through the broken door frame to eventually look in the living room. I check the clock on the mantelpiece, 6:41am, why this early? Oh well, can't dwell on that, I need my phone. Uhh... where did I see it last... I was with Mycroft? He could've taken my phone, highly likely, as I wouldn't have misplaced it myself. So, he would've gave it back after he did what he needed to do... and because I was intoxicated, due to the signs I have of a hang over, the other person he would give it to is John.
"Mmmmm... yes." I reply with the cup in my mouth swallowing more of the intoxicating drink. This is perfect, I wanted to get drunk tonight and I wanted to know what John's feelings are, win, win. Third cup.
"It's fine, John. It doesn't matter, let's just get back to the flat, we can talk there; where there are no snakes hissing around." I grumble. The rest of the way home is silent, an uncomfortable one at that. We arrive 5 minutes later, Mycroft goes to his room, me and John head up the creaky steps. We head into our flat and I shut the door after us, slamming it. I chuck my coat and blazer on the floor and undo my top buttons. John picks up the clothes off the floor and hangs them up.
The bell rings. I grab my contact book, note book and pencil case, before I get up to leave to go to French someone grabs my arm,
"look at her, Sherlock. She's gorgeous." He whispers. I scoff and roll my eyes. Yes she is quite good looking however, that won't cover the fact that she's different to other people but, how? She sits down on the chair.
"Come now, Sherlock. Eating is important~." Her arm waves the apple in front of me, I just grab my cigarette out my mouth and blow out some smoke.
"Deal!" He shouts enthusiastically. "Cab driver, lets go, ladies first~." I groan however, take my opportunity to go first.
"I-..." He pauses. It's so funny and adorable, hehe. "I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I have done for ages now and I can't begin to explain how long I've wanted to say this."
"What is it, Sherlock?" John asks. I just shake my head putting the apple back into the bag, I throw it in the bin.
"We are attending Baker Street High School. It's a public school located by where our childminders' house is." Mycroft takes his night shirt off and drapes it over the desk chair and slips his shirt on.
"Say hello, greet her." He hisses. I grab John by his collar and pull him towards me so my mouth is next to his ear.
"Right," I cough. "I need to get my phone, I may have thrown it and we also need to have dinner." I say, moving John onto the bed. John just sits up again and yawns. I retrieve my phone, there's a few cracks on the screen but, not fatal so, it'll still be good to use. The time's 5:12 pm. "What do you want for dinner, John?"
"I'm not being childish! John is apart of the equation with my addictions, he carries that on his back as well as me!"
John just looks at his phone, not even caring that I'm in front of him. I grab his phone out of his hand and turn it of, putting it into my pocket. He just glares at me, sipping his tea.
"Send him up." I sigh, pacing back and forth. Mycroft groans and goes back down the stairs, shutting the door behind him. John looks at me in bewilderment.
He has a lad behind him, a strong one at that. Parents dead, works for Moriarty (clearly), body guard, same age as me, brain issues, crooked eye, slight limp; nothing serious.
"Drink the damn tea." I sigh and take the tea, crossing my leg. The silence is thick and awkward. "Listen, Sherlock, about wh-."
"Sherlock, you technically either asked me to have sex with you or masturbate in front of you. For someone as smart as you, you can be incredibly thick. I can't tell you how to have sex or how you will or won't like it, you just have to let your instincts... flow."
"I don't want to go to school. It's boring and useless. Can I just stay here and miss it?" I stuff my face into my pillow and shut my eyes. However, before I can settle down I feel my brother grab my sheets off my back, allowing the cold, morning air to hit my back. Goosebumps wave over my body, faster than the common cold spreads, even from under my night clothes it's freezing cold.
"I-... I care, John..." I mumble. His head moves to look up at me, he's looks sad? "Uh... John... I thought I did something nice, I didn't know it was... sad?" He laughs sadly and gets up to hug me, his arms wrapping around my neck, shoving his head next to mine. My arms are in mid air, wondering what to do with themselves. My eyes blink in confusion before I hesitantly close my arms around his body. I can feel my heart in my chest, pumping rapidly and my breathing is fast.
"1 sugar. You miss him don't you?" I walk into the kitchen ignoring his comment. "I can understand why, it's such sweet sorrow when a faithful dog strays from his master." I slam the kettle switch on and it begins to rumble.
"I- I don't actually know. I thought you would like her and stop spending time with me." He mumbles.
"Sherlock. It's been a fun game..." He has an earpiece on, I assume connected to Moriarty. "...but, here we have a dilemma. The king is in check, what's the king's move?" He looks sweaty and scared, his breathing is at a quick pace. He unzips his coat and pulls the sides away from him revealing a bomb. "Here is the problem. As you can see there is a bomb strapped-" John begins to stutter, refusing to say what the psychopathic boy is saying. He takes a deep breath in and out. "... strapped to your favourite, little, Johnny boy's chest. There are several out comes to this problem and I want to know if you can chose the right one." With that final sentence John takes off his coat and takes the earpiece off. I hear the storage room door open and Moriarty walking out.
I reach into my pocket to grab another cigarette and I light it with a shaking hand. I'm scared... why am I scared? I shouldn't be scared. I'm not scared. I'm worried. Why are there so many emotions in humans when most emotions make us weaker? I take a large drag of my cigarette and hold it for a while. Then, I let it out, heavily.
"Yes, it looks alright. What's the time?" I see Mycroft check his watch and go back to sorting his hair out.
"I DON'T FUCKING CARE!" My tea spills onto my lap and on the bed. A hiss of pain escapes my lips as I try to rub it off and slamming the tea cup on the table. My body jerks off the bed, John isn't in the room anymore. He returns quickly with a wet towel. I just rub at the fabric in pain.
"No, John I didn't kiss her back. I didn't do anything, I assure you." I notice he calms down slightly at my reassurance.
"I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you but, I can't. I'll say one thing though, to keep you one edge~." She puts her head next to my ear. "Did you miss me?" She whispers. I look straight ahead of me in realisation as soon as those words leave her lips. She kisses my cheek and leaves.
"Just take your shirt off, Watson." I hear Sherlock sigh, face rammed into the pillow. I chuckle lightly and do so. Still, though, I am not gay. I lay under the sheets, which are already warm from Sherlock's body heat.
"Oh, Sherlock, you're being childish, this is a matter your addictions and it is your problem alone." Mycroft hisses.
"Well, great job so far! How many times do you think I've been captured, forced to say fucked up things by a psychopath and almost blown to pieces, huh!?"
Sorry, if this is a bit shit and messy, I'm working hard on progressing the story and the plot. Just bare with me. Thanks for reading so far. THERE IS MORE TO COME.
"Make me!" I shout. Mycroft takes a sharp inhale and exhales slowly. He rubs his eyes with his right index finger and thumb.
"No one of you concern, Watson." I grumble. John just shakes his head and goes back to reading his paper. Another set of footsteps come up the stairs, different, unsure and fumbling. That's him. Bill Wiggins. He opens the door and enters, he's a tall kid, same height as me but, he looks scrappy and dirty. He's wearing a grey hoody, dark blue top, grey sweatpants and a pair of whit socks and black trainers, that look battered and worn out.
"Oh, go on." I gulp another mouthful. "Take a deep breath and just... let it out." It's kicking in faster than I thought.
"... This isn't you Sherlock." He leans his head and rests it on my shoulder and mumbles into my ear.
"You should be." He says deeply. It sends shivers throughout my body and causes goose bumps to wave over me. He looks at me dead in the eyes.
"It's not like I have a say in this so, why not?" His grip on my arm doesn't leave me and he guides me into the gymnasium to when he finally lets go of me and shuts and locks the door behind him. It's dark and the only lights I can see is the street lights outside. I walk forward, taking long, slow, strides as I do. "What do you want then?!" I shout. "I received your little invitation and it looks like your 'friends' were expecting me. So, why not just... come out-" The lights turn on to reveal a person, my age, short. Not Moriarty. "John?" It's summer and he's wearing a large coat with fur on the inside. He's not cold... he's hiding something.
Sherlock's pale-eyed gaze upon his back, although he did not acknowledge it, pretending that this was normal, although it was anything but.
You frown, your nose crinkling. But then you laugh, a small smile appearing on your face, and I breathe out another exhale.
about you being not-dead? How many other people knew, Sherlock?" John demanded. "And don't lie to me, I'll know."
Did the gunman come back to finish me off, maybe? Maybe he did, maybe he didn't want me to live to snitch on him. But no, it's a different gait, a different set of footsteps. It's you, Sherlock. You came back for me. You're shooting at the gunman, but I don't think you really care if you hit him or not. You're there, suddenly, kneeled at my side, lifting my hand away from the wound to see the damage done.
John silently added, but he didn't say it out loud. There was another beat of awkward silence on the other end of the line, and John worried for a moment that Sherlock had hung up.
"You . . . you told me once that you weren't a hero." John began, his voice slow as he tried to pull himself together, to get his words in the right order. "There were times I didn't even think you were
He looked through old wrought iron at the two men in the distance. Faintly he heard the words idiot, moron, army, and cheese.
had been to finally get his driving licence because apparently that's what grown-ups do, according to his sister, and so he let himself be talked into receiving driving instruction from "a place I know," and on a cold winter day he'd met his driving instructor in a mostly-empty parking lot.
Marylebone Railway Station is quite literally around the corner from 221B Baker Street...what do the boys see when they wander past?
Back bowing, John Watson went and added a lovely warm mess all over his belly. After a boneless little while he began to dreamily slick their messes together.
have strong opinions on how to make their tea (milk before! no, no milk after! steep the tea for two minutes! no, no, no dip the bag in the water twice and that's strong enough!).
Oh so delicately John presses into Holmes' stupidly stunning suprasternal notch, and wiggles his finger. Holmes' deeply-relieved sigh travels right on up John's arm, through his chest. And down.
"Oh, right." Mike gestured as they sat. "John Watson, Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock's a detective. Looking for a flat share. Since we were just talking about that this morning I thought I'd bring him by."
A looker from the look of things—curly hair, fine cheekbones, a sensual mouth—but definitely, certainly, emphatically
Every single one of the remaining strangers listen so carefully they're holding their breath. Sherlock's cheeks may at this point actually be on fire.
He didn't do it, though. Decided he didn't care if he could deceive the man, because he was sure he could. It's not hard, it never is. Even if they're liars people want to believe other people aren't. Sherlock's good at making use of that little foible too, when he can.
Of the one hundred and three people currently present at the Met's Christmas party, forty-seven turned toward the shouting. After nothing happened for ten seconds except more owlish squinting on Sherlock's part and the fading of a blush on John's, most of them turned away.
paper had the story. It always seemed unfair to John that no one in the press later covered the fact that, when one of those tiny twins fell ill, Holmes began donating platelets for her. And then never stopped.
This is lovely when he brings me honeyed tea if I sneeze (I never tell him it's from giving my herbal soother a good little sniff before lighting up) it's less good when he's in a hurry to meet Himself, and doesn't hear a single word I say.
A dark-haired giant got right up in his face and said with insinuating urgency, "Follow me doctor, there may be time to save him."
When Holmes slipped me the thumbs last week he specifically asked they be buried in constant shade, eight tails apart, one tail down, left for six days, report on decomposition to be provided promptly on day seven. Today.
to a woman who clearly hadn't expected to see him. Didn't seem to matter to the man that she didn't stop to talk. It's not like he lacks for companionship, every time he comes down for lunch or a coffee
Sherlock puts a hand on his belly, another on his chest, and he says small and soft between small, soft breaths, "Help me."
of hospital architecture, which is said to allow for greater ventilation and keeping people with infectious conditions separated from those without.
"You have pretty hair," he says, because John's own hair is very plain and he wishes he had big, fluffy hair like Sherlock. And also,

Sherlock hooted. They'd been so busy the last two weeks he hadn't even had a chance to do the thing with the slices of nasal cartilage. Well, he knew exactly how
Sherlock slow blinked, flipped up his coat collar, shoved hands in pockets, a six foot wall. "That would be tremendously ambitious of you, Dr. Watson."
Once there he kissed the small of John's back, lipped the skin and licked his lips. Fresh sweat, salt-sweet.
Still busy relishing the rummage, it takes Mr Holmes a moment to look up, gaze a post-orgasmic sort of dopey.
While I can't speak for what it was like in ACD-canon era, right now Montague Street is well-to-do, full of hotels and flats, and is planted dead centre of a lot of colleges, museums, and busyness. It would have been a good spot for Sherlock to fill in his "too abundant leisure time."
With a lifted chin Sherlock turned, walked-strutted a dozen feet. He turned with a sway, returned, stood directly in front of John, legs akimbo. It was a mere quirk of fate that his crotch was at the height of John's mouth.
No one, not one of them, realised John had slowly moved through their small circle and right up to Sherlock.
Like that time John said, "Holy happy Christ I will so love fucking you right up," to the guy with the bat aimed at the back of Sherlock's head? Yeah, well that guy totally didn't see John's fear-shaking hands, didn't know John was still wearing a knee brace from a slip on winter ice. No, all the guy with the wavering cricket bat knew was that John sounded almost
The short man is right behind him now. Sherlock fumbles more apples. The woman wonders if her phone is getting all the audio.
there short-haired bikers? is that even allowed?) sits himself down—after his snooker partner wins ten pounds from him—drinks one of the three drinks leather-clad, long-haired men have bought him, and he stares at Sherlock.
Sherlock sits down with his cold coffee and, in a lonely cafe in the middle of Regent's park, he pretends he's alone. He's very good at doing this.
John had a girlfriend once who said he was perverse. Not content with over-long hours as a doctor, he went and joined the army so he could then risk his own life while saving others.
The fifth and sixth kissers each smelt of eggnog, which made John giggle, and he was sure both were men (one was). The seventh definitely was and the eighth and ninth kisses were both from the tall, pretty, black woman who'd been chatting him up earlier.
“Now you lead John, it’s more traditional for the man to do so especially at weddings.” Sherlock relinquished control of their steps to his pupil.
Sherlock did not respond and John did not prod further. Instead he left, closing the door behind him knowing that as he did so that he was leaving behind an opportunity that he never considered before. Part of him realized that the lesson he had learned this afternoon was that he had experienced his first dance with the love of his life rather than his future wife.
John tripped for a moment but when they started to turn once more he seemed to be catching on quickly. “I think you’re a natural.” Sherlock complimented John as they continued to practice the very basics of the waltz in the living room they once shared.
John shook his head and looked to the detective. “No, I mean…no it’s not that I don’t want your help. I was just surprised, alright? I didn’t mean anything by it.” He offered a warm smile to Sherlock to let him know that he had not meant to insult or tease him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again. “It seems a good a time as any. The wedding is less than two weeks away and if you’ve never had any lessons then the sooner we start the better.”
Yet somehow they're about to let the moment pass, because each has been alone long enough that it's begun to seem normal, maybe safe. Then Mike makes a chest-deep sound and turns his head. It's difficult to tell which man he's looking at, but it spurs one of them to speak.
The fourth time they were so bemused by the first three that they giggled throughout, but this time it was John moaning, "Let me…" and making it there in time to swallow everything.
Quiet and a couple dozen feet from the angry man, John paced. Another corner, another tap of his toe.
It took Sherlock a good three seconds to realise any of this. When he did, he sat up and demurely placed a hand over the pretty tent in his trousers. He listed left, took hold of the table edge so as to stop listing left. "Why did you do that?"
John was halfway across the room before he had discussed this plan with his feet and by the time he let his feet know
Included in my Tumblr photos of St. Mary's is one I took of a restaurant right up the street from it. It's a striking looking place and I imagine John-nothing-happens-to-me-Watson doing his occasional shift as St. Mary's then going down to this place to have a meal and a pint or three.
They call it skin hunger, the need to touch and be touched, the cell-deep craving to know through contact that you're not alone.
"You got shot, Sherlock Holmes, that's what I learned at St. Bart's when I went looking. It hurt so much, didn't it? I know it did because it says in your records that you wouldn't stop moaning about the pain, about the blood, you were babbling they said, that's the word written in the file: 'babbling.' I can see it clear as day, the bullet dug away some of that fatty bit of your shoulder and it bled so much, too much, more than you thought it could. But the worst part…as you watched the red run through your fingers you waited in that alley for the next bullet, because that's all you could do, all your body would let you do with legs gone to lead and the mercy of disassociation telling you all of it was happening to someone else."
from the thing he wasn't, so Sherlock Holmes vented his frustration by undoing his seat belt, reaching over, and prying his student's fingers off the steering wheel.
Use it John had, however, and that's probably when everything began changing, because it was then Sherlock started to see what he was seeing.
John heads over to the 'queer pansy' in the tight jeans. Eyes made up, spike-heeled boots on his feet, the man emphatically doesn't belong in a dodgy neighborhood pub with dried beer in the corners and walls the colour of bile.
The blonde-headed four-year-old having a fit at one end of the aisle is a Watson, so the little scrapper indeed belongs to James Watson. His offspring is shouting at an innocent bit of produce, maintaining that "No, no, no, daddy cowofower is mean!" because little Johnny Watson

So while John undid his jeans, Sherlock undid John's shirt, and when John started to wank, Sherlock started to lick wetly at John's nipples, then sucked the moisture away noisily, only to leave even more spit behind when he was done.
After work, everyone at the Met goes to this pub. Greg's not the only one who needs that symbolic crossing of the street to feel he's left work behind and the fact that the Grafton Arms is nearly within sight of the Met doesn't matter.
They are at opposite ends of the supermarket aisle, the shouting little boys, but Sherlock Holmes' mother and John Watson's father are in the middle, accidentally almost back-to-back, as if each is striving for plausible deniability that the child having the tantrum is theirs.
Having already eaten half of three of them John wasn't sure how Sherlock had come to his conclusion but he successfully disabused his one true love of the falsehood when he said, "Sherlock.
answered. He doesn't want to hear "Well you're an idiot," or "That was stupid." So Sherlock Holmes says nothing. John's not so reticent.
So it's not the man's body or bad jokes that draw Sherlock. To be honest he's not sure what he's seeing when he stares, but Sherlock knows he'll keep doing it until the man makes him stop.
John rose so sharply his chair skidded backward. As if on a string Sherlock stood, too. Five other sets of eyes went wide.
After that came six red frames, twelve blue, and four purple. There were then yellow, green, and beige. There was a white pair that made Sherlock pale as a milk bottle, and ovals that made him look like a consumptive poet. There were cat-eye frames, flower shapes, circles, and squares. There were frames of metal and plastic, velvet and of actual wood. There were three pairs with gears and magnifiers, ruby lenses and leather, and over these they spent forty minutes, heads together, figuring out what all the little bits could do. Sherlock's tongue stuck out the side of his mouth. John watched it lick and poke.
Within five minutes of their second playdate Sherlock had taken John's hand, walked them the twelve metres to the local library—Maureen and Altamont Holmes had picked
If you want to write about Sherlock's life before John, and would like to know a bit about Montague Street, I hope this chapter offers a bit of aid. Be sure to look
"You chatted up the barista for five minutes, then pretended you'd forgot your wallet—it's bulging right there in your back pocket—until she gave you your coffee and cake for free."
The plainest of plain filter coffees in his hand, Sherlock Holmes blinked benignly at the psychology student, the son of the daughter of Mrs. Hudson's sister and a boy Sherlock was 'helping' by answer questions for the young man's college essay. Sherlock was not strictly doing this out of the kindness of his heart.
A bunched up pair of black jeans soaked up Sherlock's come and John's crotch soaked up his moans. A couple minutes after that Sherlock's arse took care of John's needs.
John reached back. "One hundred pounds says I can kiss a dozen people, eyes closed, and tell who's male and who's female."
Three hours and four times that many giggling fits later, John said, "—and you're just lucky I backed you up when it was the man's
moue down at him. "First, you think you're a regular Miss Marple, don't you? Second, you had no clue about the bee sting, I know you didn't. And third, I'm not actually gay. What a great detective
Before he could put the full stop on his last directive—"And absolutely no touching"—a non-scent-wearing, facial hair-free person bowed before the blindfolded doctor and pressed their lips to his.
But it wasn't okay, which is why Sherlock couldn't stop crying and why, after awhile he had to run the back of his hand under his nose, so nose stuff wouldn't get on his bear. When his hand came away glistening wet, Sherlock made an actual "Ugh," sound because Sherlock did not like…fluids.
Postman's Park is tiny, just a small space quite near the Old Bailey, where the boys are sometimes expert witnesses in criminal trials, it is also close to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Barbican, and almost right next to the Museum of London.
Over the many, many years they will rut and fuck and love Sherlock will find himself here often, doing what he for the first time did now: flicking his tongue from the bottom of John's hole to the top. Salty? Yes. Sweet? Yes. Musky, dark, soap-scented, sweaty,
At Bart's later this afternoon he'd spilt a test tube of blood and it had flowed across the bench like some sort of very small red sea. The student two seats over had watched Sherlock mop up the mess very messily, positively beaming as the smear smeared.
Sherlock disappears. Greg slumps forward, under the illusion he's had a narrow escape. After a few minutes Greg starts to worry he's misunderstood something important, then a short man in army dress blues approaches.
Still trying to scratch his chest with his own chin, Holmes says in a carrying sort of voice, "Between my nipples!"
No, instead John looked at the blond hardwood floor at his feet, and then he went Zen and started pacing along the fancy, dark inlay at its edges.
Sherlock closes his eyes, bows his head to the dusty airport window and he turns the bottle round and round in his pocket until it makes a sweet, soft little
The whole speech, the touch, the long finger kind of hanging off the end of Sherlock's open mouth, all combined to keep John mute. Fortunately his throat had no such confusion and proceeded to let loose with a small growl.
learnt things through the years, too. He's learnt that if you yell loud enough, you might make another kid cry. That even though they're annoying, that kid might have a mum who's sick, a dad who's dead, or just not
Finally, the second best thing John learned through all of this was that once in a great while, when Sherlock gets excited by something their bees have done, he will dance on his toes.
Sherlock's voice was high and breathy and aggrieved, and it was right then John became capable of hearing that one voice above all others. He raised his eyebrows so high they made little wrinkles on his forehead, and he sniffled, "Hu?"
"I could talk your ear off about what's suddenly going on with my decrepit knees, but I won't because you look very nice."
Rapt. Fascinated. And something wonderful: Before Sherlock had intruded with grim reality, John Watson had been randy as hell.
cross Baker Street then turned left, he’d be on Marylebone Road. On Marylebone you’ll find not only another tube entrance for Baker Street, you'll find a Marks & Spencer mini supermarket. This isn't one of their proper supermarkets, it’s too dinky for that. This is more where John and Sherlock would grab high-end pre-made meals because they've just got back from a case that had them walking hip deep through the Thames, down into the sewers, then along Regent's canal and damn it
"Let's get a few things clear, mister." The stranger rose up on tip-toe so he could drop his voice. "It was the
Which is to say Sherlock paused before replying. Which was all the reply the belligerent little man before him required.
and that includes the one he'll have at twenty-eight, when he figures out how to get Bakelite to burn without emitting brain-damaging poisonous gas.
John Watson goes to his knees under that bar, right down there where the fetid water's collected from the broken bar sink, right there where rubbish no one ever sweeps up crusts in the corners, and with steady hands he touches the bartender's forehead, the pulse in his neck. He peels back an eyelid and John can see in those wild skittering eyes that the man wants to push him away, that he reads all the signs of John's help as potential hurt, and when the man half-succeeds, scooting backward with heels scraping against the filthy floor, John gets behind him and sits down hard, so that the man shoves himself backward and into John's open arms.
John floats himself up to an empty table, where none of the glassware from a party of eight has been cleared away.
So yeah, he comes out the front door of NSY and peers round the left side of the building to have a gander at the famous clock tower, checking if his watch is right. It always is (Greg spends good money on good things when he needs them) but he checks anyway. Probably because he likes catching sight of so many landmarks so close. He wasn't born in London, and he's tickled, yes he is, when he gets a moment to remember its beauty.
John Watson did not pay one little never mind to the man behind the bar, because John Watson does not come into pubs to socialise. He comes into pubs to drink and while he is drinking he radiates as many prickly
John Watson laughs and suddenly they start moving easily, then talking easier still. After awhile everything stops being awkward.
Broadly speaking, there are four main supermarkets here and in order of cheapest to pricey they are: Tesco, Sainsbury's, with a tie between Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (called M&S). Want a good ready-made meal? M&S or Waitrose. Cheap and easy and grab-it-on-the-way home? Tesco, because they are pretty much everywhere.
Mr. Coat and Curls stopped, turned, looked the sex toy over and shrugged, "My source did report satisfaction."
of books the last three days—discussing the diarrhea, drooling, and contact dermatitis brought on by them.
"I'm sorry John!" shouted Sherlock, flailing at John's belt again and totally missing how belts work. Again.
John then suddenly stepped out of his trousers. This was mostly because Sherlock had just gone and pushed him over and dragged the trousers off. With John's shoes
John looked up and up and was busy not discussing things with his nose now, because he sniffed loudly, then giggled and said, "You smell like
There once was a little boy. Well, he wasn't so little really, or no littler than most other five-year-olds, who all seemed about the same size as him. John would have to think about that.
Then a friend of a friend had suggested Madeleine Hamlyn Watson. Within five minutes of their phone conversation Madeleine had agreed to tutor the youngest Holmes. When then warned that her new charge was inclined to flit and fly from topic to topic Madeleine said the fateful words that would change the life of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes forever.
He went and said something again and again John had to smack at his husband's hands and half-holler, "For the fuckin' love of a French roast Sherlock, slow down I can't understa—"
The funny thing is, give a man enough time alone, enough days, weeks, and years of forced reflection and he'll not only learn what he wants, better yet, he'll learn what he needs.
John Watson inhaled so sharply he snorted his own spit, then choked on it. As he suffocated, he stumbled three steps to the left, away from the big man holding a strand of anal beads.
you and why should they? John's learnt that people expect short guys to be belligerent, that they're sure all surgeons are arseholes, and as of today he's learnt that four beers and a shot are apparently more than enough to make him drunk enough to not really notice when some idiots tie two chairs together, then tie him and another guy to them thinking they're
His devotion to not laying hands on himself started soon after he began laying hands on himself. He was fourteen.
Then Sherlock takes one second more to tease through the jaw-dropped reality that his throat's gone dry and he's breathing funny and… "Yes."
Greg probably does this a lot, because very close to NSY is Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, the London Eye, and the River Thames.
So, if you're going to set a story in NSY you'll want to research when/if that move has at last happened.
Close they do. Seconds pass. Then more seconds. John presses every last button on the panel. He now has forty-two floors of opportunity. He intends on using every one of them. He turns to Sherlock. "So Mister, uh…?"
John moves closer, their bare bodies warming the world beneath the duvet, and he wiggles his foot between Sherlock's ankles, hooking them together. He bows his head a little more and Sherlock does again what he did all those years ago, before John was deployed, he brushes his lips against the short, short hair and starts monologuing.
Mr Holmes tightens his fist round the squishy faux fruit in his hand. The machine purrs its happiness at the renewed flow of fluids.
"You're beautiful." John replied, flushing scarlet, betrayed by his mutinous mouth. Apparently his whole body was going over to the other side. As if no one had ever told
If you find that St. Mary's doesn't suit your stories, I'd also highly recommend St. Thomas' hospital which frankly
and he rarely lets himself see that, much less say it. But he's just now spoken that word, just now touched the softness, the—
Little John Watson does not know the word caffeine or milligram either, but that hasn't stopped him from just now ingesting one hundred and twenty-four milligrams of the stuff.
John drops the phone, wraps his other arm around the man who has started to moan again and John whispers, "What's your name, sweetheart?"
Sherlock asks about Afghan food, John's shoulder, how long a blood transfusion takes, if it's true tongue prints are unique as fingerprints, and when human bones cease fusing.
Sherlock makes a hurumphing noise and turns up his suit collar, the very opposite of a peacock display of welcome. Unlike a clueless consulting detective, the woman reads the sign loud and clear. With a tip of her glass and a grin she's gone.
Sherlock is busy being distracted by the heat of the big animal between his legs and the heat of the small one at his back. Again John Watson doesn't wait, but squeezes the horse with his thighs and the moment Mike moves Sherlock yelps ("No I didn't," he'll say one year from today. "Yes you did." John will reply.), so John takes hold of his guest's waist.
Sherlock will deduce you before he's met you, he'll deduce you after three words, he'll damn well deduce you from the teeth marks you leave in your toast.
Which is further to say that though John is laid back – he did not survive two tours in Afghanistan by being high strung – this Sherlock Holmes bloke was most definitely getting under John's…um, his skin. Yes, that's what he's under.
That was how John Watson met Sherlock Holmes one summer when they were both small, and they're each pretty sure that that's when the seeds of some of the…
"He played rugby in college, not football, was in the army not the navy, and he's far too smart not to see through your plans of fraud. So those index cards you've been studying? Wrong. Wrong. Wrong."
Still and all, John's about to say something along the lines of, "Thanks a lot but no…" because John's still not ready to acknowledge certain personal things, but you know what? Mike has pretty much had it.
"See here's the thing. I got on my knees yesterday. Where they're putting up that big ugly Ferris wheel by the river, you know? Anyway, I wanted to pet this tiny dog, Sir Aloysius Dandelion Floof or something painfully adorable like that. You should have seen this dog. Not even two kilos but the gravitational pull of a planet. I made infantile sounds at that dog. I may have cooed."
That had been his last appointment for the day, luckily, and now it was time to head back to the mundaneness of Baker Street. Working at a doctor's office and diagnosing other people's problems helped him to forget his own, although he was always painstakingly reminded of what he had to go home to at the end of the day. It had been two years,
since his best friend had committed suicide, and John had never completely gotten over it, no matter what he told everyone else. He had considered moving out of 221B, considering all the memories it held, but he just couldn't. Baker Street was his home.
There was the sound of fabric shifting from behind him, and the sound of a wooden chair screeching outward from the kitchen table closely following it. Sherlock was most likely settling at the table instead, though for what reason, John didn't know. The piercing whistle of the kettle brought John back to the present time, and he was quick to pour out two mugs of tea, carrying them over to the table and setting them down with a clunk. The sugar bowl was set down as well, in case either of them wanted to add some to their tea.
Sherlock gave a curt nod, so John turned and walked into the entryway, hearing the door shut behind him a few minutes later, and the sound of Sherlock's footsteps. John set the bags down in the sitting room before heading down the hall and into the nursery, picking Rosie up from her cot and cradling her close, bouncing her slightly to calm her cries. Once he'd given her the pacifier she'd managed to drop and paced around the room with her for a few minutes, she had calmed right back down, and John tucked her back in before going to see how Sherlock was holding up.
feel." Mrs. Hudson sympathetically patted his arm. "All the marks on my table; and the noise – firing guns at half past one in the morning!"
The first thing that threw John off was the door to the flat being open. He usually shut it before he left for work, and it was always that way when he got home. Maybe Mrs. Hudson was getting a late start with the usual dusting she did, although that seemed unlikely. Had someone broken in? Well, John certainly wasn't afraid to defend himself. But then, as his hearing adjusted to the quietness of the building, that was when he heard
You look like you haven't slept well in days, or at least gotten a few minutes at a time, judging from the dark circles underneath your eyes. You haven't showered, either, as your hair has a greasy look to it underneath the fluorescent lighting. You've been here the entire time I've been unconscious, haven't you? You haven't gone back to 221B, those are still the same clothes from when I was shot. I can tell, there's blood on the cuff of your sleeve.
John's fingers trembled around the sides of his mobile phone, squeezing the plastic so hard that his knuckles were quickly turning white. "No,
John allowed himself a smile before gesturing toward the hallway. "Come on, then, I'll show you your room, shall I?"
he'd feel, but having the police called on him didn't seem like the brightest idea. So here he stayed, in the stupid house contained within the stupid neighborhood he hardly even liked, partially drowning in the memories of what this place used to contain.
"Shut up, Sherlock, alright? Just . . . shut up." he said, clenching his teeth together for a moment. "I don't care about how you did it, alright? I don't, I
He'd gone to bed at around eleven, exhausted both physically and emotionally from that day's events. Sherlock had paid mild attention to the late night shows on the telly, though he'd mostly been involved in scrolling through the news on his laptop, trying to catch up on everything and check to see if anything new had happened. They'd ended up getting takeaway for dinner, with John going out to fetch it, and spent the night in companionable silence. Just like old times.
So many other people did, too, because we thought we'd lost you forever. And now here you are, right back in my life like you never even left it. How exactly did you think our reunion was going to go, Sherlock? Did you honestly believe I was just going to pretend it was alright, like I didn't drown myself in sorrow? You're a right
"I think I'll sleep in here. You've experienced these night terrors before, and you tend to not go back to sleep afterwards, instead going out to the kitchen and drinking a few cups of coffee before staying up until your shift at the clinic starts." Sherlock said, matter-of-factly. "And considering you need to be well-rested in order to treat patients, it might be better if you have someone else's presence with you."
"I hope it's alright. We never really had much use for it before, I already went ahead and changed up the sheets and all that."
John's feet were starting to ache once he'd arrived at the familiar door of 221B, and he was grateful to be back home. His limp had become more pronounced since Sherlock's death, but he was stubborn, and refused to use a cane.
"Better safe than sorry, that's what I always say." John said with a smile, then pulled out a lollipop from one of his desk drawers, handing it over to the young girl, who accepted it with a grin. "Drink lots of fluids, Annie, and don't forget to wash your hands. Wouldn't want to pass it onto your mum, yeah?"
"Oh." said Sherlock, and there was another beat of silence on the other end before he spoke again. "No, it's- I'm fine. I'm staying with Mycroft for the time being, until Baker Street is rebuilt. I haven't really been- still trying to process everything, I suppose."
but let me tell you this: you were the best man, and the most human . . . human being that I've ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, and so . . . There."
"John?" he asked, his voice quiet yet curious. "I heard you screaming from downstairs, were you having night terrors?"
"You wouldn't be. Look, you don't have to accept, I just thought I'd offer. I have a guest room, so you wouldn't be forced to sleep on the sofa or anything like that."
"Sorry," was the first thing to exit John's mouth, and he could've slapped himself for it. Although, it did gain Sherlock's attention, accompanied by a questioning look. "It's late, I know, but- I was worried. About you, I suppose. I hadn't heard from you since . . . well, you know, and I thought that you'd like a place to stay."
and Sherlock fell backward out of a sort of shock, his eyes going wide as his hand raised to touch the quickly reddening spot. John was on his feet now, hands firmly clenched at his sides as his chest heaved with heavy breathing.
You know I've already dialed, you're speaking very harshly to the person on the other side of the line. I catch snippets of words like
"John." Sherlock managed a small smile, although it was quick to fade. "Is it still alright if I come in?"
John hadn't realized how choked up he was actually getting, now on the brink of tears by the time he'd finished speaking. Whatever shoddy excuse Sherlock was going to come up with, whether it be that
The man seemed startled by the loud noise of the grocery bags hitting the floor, the violin abruptly stopping as he turned around. John's heart immediately sped up as a smile slowly stretched across those familiar cupid bow lips, excitement lighting up those familiar blue-grey eyes. Those cheekbones, those thin fingers, John knew them all too well. Everything about this man, as he strode across the sitting room toward John, seemed so surreal.
was his gun? But as the door opened completely, John stopped in his frantic scrambling. Sherlock's tall figure stood in the doorway, his face eclipsed into shadow by the darkness of the landing.
You blink quickly, then fumble for the buttons to raise the bed so I'm in a sitting position. We stare at each other for a moment before I reach out and pull you into a tight embrace, which should be awkward considering that I'm sitting on a hospital bed and you're standing, but it isn't. You stoop slightly to get comfortable, but you don't mind.
Holmes had carved himself a place within John's heart, nestled himself there, forced himself to fit, and it'd been a gaping wound after Sherlock had taken his fall. It had torn John apart, and he'd just been putting himself back together again when
John was already well on his way down the hall, but the creak of the sofa signified that Sherlock was following. He reached inside the guest room to flick on the light, and stood aside so Sherlock could enter.
I'm not booting you from my life, alright? Even though I'm certainly going to be cross with you for a long while, I'm not just going to let you walk out of my life all over again. That'd be really stupid of me, and- y'know, Sherlock, at your funeral, I said a few things at your grave. But there was one thing that I asked you for, one thing that I really wanted. I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead. And here you are."
I feel so tired, and my eyes are closing. You're yelling, now, your voice in a twist. You're shaking me, but I ignore it. I'm exhausted, I want to sleep. You don't understand. Everything is slowing around me, and I can hear other panicked voices. But yours is the one who stands out most, barking orders at everyone there in the ambulance.
"I'd die before I let anything happen to you, John." Your voice is distant, and I didn't see your lips move.
but I don't pay attention, my eyes on the stars. Stargazing calms me, and I count the different constellations in my head. There's the Big Dipper, and there's-
he hated it. Every inch of this life he was struggling to maintain, he despised it to the very core. Not Rosie, never Rosie, but instead the false air of mediocrity that he gave off to all of the neighbors. It wasn't him, it was far from him, and what he wouldn't give to burn the entire place to the ground. John knew how good it would feel, how
"No! No, there's nothing wrong, Sherlock." John quickly interrupted, taking a seat on the sofa, running his tongue over the back of his teeth. "Sorry, erm- I just . . . I was wondering how you were doing. I mean, we haven't really- Christ, forget it, this was a stupid idea."
"Okay. I'll see you then." John said, before ending the call and immediately setting off into the kitchen to put a kettle on to boil.
John felt like he was going to pass out again, and he mutely felt Sherlock's hand clamp to his shoulder to steady him. "You . . . you're . . ."
The funeral was quiet, just himself and Mrs. Hudson. John found it hard to breathe as they stepped in front of the headstone, taking a shaking breath to prevent himself from breaking down. He had to stay strong.
After he'd changed, washed up, and laid down, John felt himself relax for the first time in a long time. It felt comforting, to have someone else in the house besides him and his daughter. And the fact that it was Sherlock, that he now knew Sherlock was safe, put him at ease. It was easy to fall into a doze.
John watched, in mute horror, as Sherlock's body was put onto a gurney and wheeled away into the hospital, and that was when, at last, tears began to fall from John's eyes, hands resting on his knees as he drowned in his own sorrow. Just like that, Sherlock had been painfully torn from his life, from everyone's lives.
It's just you and me here, running down a dark alleyway, our breathing harsh and in tandem. That's how it's always been, really, just me and you. Well, except when it's me and a woman, and sometimes, you show up there, and it's awkward. If I invite her over, you start deducing her the moment she walks into the flat, and most of the time, she ends up leaving. I should be mad at you. I am, sometimes, but most of the time, I pretend. I know she wouldn't be as
"Well, Mrs. Tawney, it looks like your daughter's just fine. Just a mild bout of the flu, should clear itself up in a few days time." John Watson scratched out a prescription onto his pad, then tore it off and handed it to the woman sitting on the other side of his desk. "But, do give her this medicine, it'll help to speed up the process."
Getting shot isn't new to me. That's exactly how I'd gotten discharged from the Army. But it's never been so close to a vital organ.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock was apologizing, again, and John's violent train of thought came to a screeching halt. "I know, John. Things aren't the same between us as they were before, they probably won't be ever again, and I'm accepting that. If you want me out of your life, that's fine. I would understand. I would have told you, you know, if I had the choice. But my brother was very secretive about the whole thing, he didn't want you knowing. Or anyone close to me, for that matter."
how you know I do all that, even though you've been away for the duration of them happening, but alright. Let me just lug it out of the closet." John swung his legs over the side of the bed and shuffled over to his closet, opening it and taking out the box that contained the blow-up mattress. He plugged the pump into the wall and began to inflate it, unplugging it once he was done.
be Sherlock Holmes, and nothing about that fact had changed over the course of seven years. The last time he'd seen Sherlock had been when they'd parted ways once they were back in London, Sherlock in one cab and John in the other. He'd not received a call nor text from the detective in the days since, and that slightly worried him. Where was Sherlock, now that there was no Baker Street to return to? Why hadn't he reached out? Was he waiting for John to make the first move, considering they were still on thin ice after what had transpired after Mary's death?
We'll die together. Here, with our heartbeats thudding in tandem until they beat their last. You move closer, my eyes shut, and . . .
"Are you sure, John?" Sherlock slowly asked, his tone incredulous. "I wouldn't want to be a bother."
don't. What I want to know is . . . how could you do that to me? You flung yourself off St. Bart's, I
The water is up to the side of the bed, pulsing over the mattress, soaking our clothing. It's almost up to our mouths, and we still don't move.
You look like you've gotten a fright, and yes, I suppose seeing me here on the ground would've done that to you. But I've never seen your emotions this clear on your face before, so
That left him here, at 10:32 PM on a bloody Tuesday, feet wearing treads in the carpet of his sitting room as he paced back and forth in front of the coffee table. He'd put Rosie down for bed a few hours ago, but yet (there was another one of those but yets), he couldn't sleep. He hadn't really slept since after Mary died, and even after he'd reconciled with Sherlock after putting him in hospital. His mobile sat, motionless, on the coffee table, the very source of his internal debate. It was late, of course it was late, but a part of him was itching to at least try Sherlock, to reassure himself that Sherlock was alright. It'd been itching for days, but being manic on three cups of coffee at a late hour seemed to do the trick.
"Thank you, John." Sherlock gave him a half smile, hefting one of the bags he'd brought up onto the bed and starting to unpack.
, is right on our heels. He's angry. You made him that way. And while I do love a good dose of adventure, running for my life isn't really a way I want to spend my evening. But that's okay. You're here with me, so everything will be fine.
But yet. John's life was filled with but yets, far too many for his liking. For example, he himself had a lovely daughter and a spacious house in the suburbs. Things were alright. But yet,
"I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please." John desperately pleaded, pushing the investigators and such aside. "No, he's my friend. He's my friend. Please."
"Here I am." Sherlock repeated, although a sad smile appeared on his face. "I know, John. I was there. I heard you."
It takes me all of ten seconds to realize this, and another five until I collapse onto the pavement, my lungs screaming for air, my heart still beating. It's a quick flutter under my fingertips, and my free hand goes to my pocket to grab for my mobile. I know blood is already smearing all over the screen, but I need to dial 999 before it's too late.
The steady beeping of the machines I'm hooked up to helps to keep me grounded, and I finally look around the small room that I'm in. There's large windows over to my left. And to my right . . .
Someone's pinched my arm. Oh, it's you, and you have an urgent look on your face. You were trying to get my attention, trying to make sure I didn't shut my eyes by accident. I understand. I've been in your position before, Sherlock, I know the drill.
He heard Sherlock get up from the table, and a few minutes later, the sound of violin began to once more flow through the flat. John smiled to himself, shaking his head. He was still in shock, of course he was, and it'd be hours still until he recovered fully, maybe even days or weeks. But Sherlock was here,
The other side of the bed remains empty. No more blond curls sprawl across the pillows, and the other side of the closet is a hollow space. He'd given away most of Mary's things a few days ago, after he'd gotten back home and had a spare bit of time to recover from the horrifying experience in Sherrinford. He still kept a few, nestled away to keep for Rosie when she was older, but he himself knew how desperately he needed to let go. Mary no longer lingered around as a figment of his grief-addled brain, so he'd taken it as a sign. He'd felt lighter in the slightest.
alone, and I owe you so much." his voice was tearful now as he took a step away from the grave. "Okay."
"I . . . I'm angry." he said, his voice stiff as he disturbed the silence between them. "It was . . . cruel."
He headed down the hall so he could make up the guest room's bed with fresh linens and a few blankets from the top of the closet, checking in on Rosie for a second before going to check the tea. He'd at least have a cuppa out if Sherlock wanted it, but if not, that was fine, too.
Okay, we'll talk. I'm going to put the kettle on for tea." John said, trying to keep his voice steady before whirling off into the kitchen.
"Yessir!" Annie chirped in response, saluting him as she unwrapped the sweet and stuck it into her mouth. "C'mon, Mummy, Doctor Watson says I'm fine!"
"But I'm alright." I said firmly, and you nodded, so I allowed myself to relax. "That's good. That's . . .
"Yeah, me too." John felt a bit easier about the entire situation. Sherlock was safe, warm, had a bed to sleep in, wasn't out on the streets trying to drown his memories with whatever he could purchase off a dealer. That was what mattered. "That's, ah- that's good, Sherlock. I'm glad."
John almost laughed, but refrained, crossing his arms as he looked up at the ceiling. Sherlock had actually been there, lurking in the trees, listening to everything John had been saying to his grave. How utterly . . . Sherlock Holmes. He took a sip of tea, which had cooled a bit by now, and sighed.
"Bloody specimens in my fridge. Imagine – keeping bodies where there's food!" Mrs. Hudson's voice was breaking now, hands shaking. "And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on!"
A wordless gesture was made toward the grave before John finally walked away, dragging a hand over his face. It was time to move on. It was time to face reality.
This was definitely the worst idea John'd had in a long while. Already the conversation was plummeting slowly downhill, and he'd only gotten as far as a small greeting.
Sherlock, in that time span, had gone to his bedroom and brought back his sheets and his duvet, and he silently handed them to John to put onto the mattress. John rolled his eyes, shaking his head as he kneeled to set up the bed.
"What about afterward, Sherlock? What about then, when it was hours after, and I was safe?" John sounded extremely hurt, which he most certainly was. "You could've contacted me."
John's fingers curled around the edge of his mobile, glancing around at the interior of his home. It was just him and Rosie, against the world, tucked away in the suburbs that John wished he could escape. But, he felt as if there was an empty, gaping hole. He needed company. He
"John, I can explain, alright?" Sherlock got to his feet, although he didn't back away from John, merely stepping closer. "Just calm down. I had my reasons why I couldn't show my face right away, I really did, and they were important. You have no idea how much I wanted to come back here, how Mycroft tortured me with the video footage of you in here, around London, whenever I was in the country. I'm sorry."
"Sherlock . . ." John began, then paused, wrapping his head around the idea that'd just popped into his head a moment ago before he continued on. "Listen, I . . . would you want to . . . it's alright if you say no, but- maybe you'd like to stay with me for a bit? Just until Baker Street's done. I know Rosie would love to see her godfather."
Sherlock?!" John snarled, and Sherlock watched in silent wonder. John hardly ever cursed so vulgarly, only when he was extremely upset. "You let me think you were dead for two years, two yea- I bet you heard everything I said at your funeral, didn't you? And you just had a great bloody laugh to yourself! How could you
The sight before him took his breath away entirely, grocery bags dropping to the floor with a loud clatter. The flat was clean, thanks to Mrs. Hudson, but that wasn't the thing that had captured his attention. There was a tall figure at the window, a violin cradled in his arms, bow moving rhythmically and smoothly across the string. The figure wore a pair of flannel pajama bottoms and a blue house robe, and his hair was dark and curly.
A breath hitched in John's throat as he stumbled upon a picture frame, shoved deeply away where he wouldn't have to see it. He and Sherlock had been taking pictures for the newspaper the day it was taken, and whilst John smiled, Sherlock wore an extremely serious expression. The detective was never really a fan of all the newfound fame, and it showed. Although, once the newspeople had turned off their cameras, Sherlock had leaned down to John's ear and whispered a deduction about the cameraman, to which John had laughed heartily. Lestrade had managed to snap a photo of the moment when they both weren't looking, and sent it to John, who had gotten it framed and kept it in his office. The pair of them were both smiling and laughing, and while back then it had been a good memory, now it was just a painful reminder of what had been.
