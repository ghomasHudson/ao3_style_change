“I… I don’t know what to tell you, Dean.” Cas began in his deep, gravelly voice. “My… my father, uh, left. When I was younger. I barely even remember him, to be honest. So I’m not really one to judge what it means, to be a good son or not. I don’t know what your relationship with your father was like, but what I do know is that you are a good man, Dean Winchester. I know that you do everything you can for other people, and that you never take for yourself. I know that you try your hardest, even when you want to stop, just because it is what you feel you must do. I know that… that you make a room brighter just by walking into it. That anyone who meets you is blessed to spend even a moment in your presence. And I know that your father would be proud of you, that he’d never blame you. And if he would, then he doesn’t deserve to have a son as amazing as you.” Cas finished, not quite sure if what he said would help, but knowing that each word he spoke was the truth.
“Okay.” He claps a hand down on Dean’s shoulder, reels him in for a quick hug. “Hey… how long have we been on the road, anyway?”
Sam sighs and returns to the car, to start looking for their next job, and Dean stalks off towards the gas station instead of the bar, his posture just screaming anger.
“You saved Dean’s life. That means something to me. Besides… you seen the rest of our family lately?”
. It’s seared into his shoulder, and it looks gnarly, but even when he pokes at it it doesn’t really hurt. It’s just…
“You’re really staking your brother’s life on whether or not one of my angels makes the same mistake often enough?”
“So, say you and me are in a bank. Robber comes in with a shotgun, everyone else hits the floor, you could just… just completely destroy it?”
“For now, he’s with us. I mean, when he’s… when he’s used to Earth, we can give him options, we can try and set him up somewhere if he wants a normal life, but… he’s just not ready for that. It’s not safe.”
“We’re adding stakes, Cas. Winner gets… hmm…” He comes around to stand toe to toe with Cas, though Cas is not in the least intimidated to have Dean tower over him. He doesn’t think intimidation is the point-- challenge, yes. That’s part of the game. Dean reaches down and fixes his tie, gives him that soft little lip-biting grin. “Winner gets to ask the loser for a favor, to be determined… whensoever he chooses.”
“I mean, he can’t face you because he thinks he failed to protect you. You’re in here hating that you’re not doing more to protect him. And we could spend from now to the next apocalypse going around in circles doing the same things over and over again, or the two of you could be honest with each other.”
There are sheets over most of the furniture, and since Cas is standing there holding Dean and looking half ready to collapse himself, Sam whips the sheet off the big bed first, before getting the rest of them out of the way and trying to make the place temporarily habitable.
“I don’t want to live in it.” Dean’s voice is cold, hard. Bitter. The look in his eyes communicates about as clearly as he would ever try to say in words, that he wasn’t going to put this knowledge on Sam’s shoulders if he hadn’t pushed for it, that he was a cornered animal lashing out when he’d have rather holed up in the dark, and sharing this truth was a last-ditch effort to stop having a conversation.
Dean’s hand is healed, but Cas doesn’t let go right away this time, just turns it over between his own--
“You guys still haven’t finished that game?” Sam asks, loping into the room with his open laptop balanced carefully across his forearm.
“I don’t think so. On the occasion that I encountered him, he was occupying a male vessel, but that could have been a matter of convenience rather than preference.”
“I really hope you mean a play pen and not like a dog crate.” Sam shoots him a look, but then he catches sight of Cas’ face.
If he does this, that’s it, this universe goes to Chuck, putting them at… As far as Sam can tell, as far as he can think, this is Chuck’s second sure win, and while a couple look maybe pretty good for him, there’s only one he knows is ironclad, one where Cas absolutely cannot and will not leave them.
“Yeah, you usually don’t. Uh, I probably… can’t talk about this whole thing. Pretty sure at least one of us gets zapped with lightning if I talk about what I’m doing here.”
“My apologies, beloved.” Cas noses at his cheek, hands dropping to his hips. “It wasn’t purposeful, at the time, but… even if I could take it back now, I wouldn’t. Is…?”
“Not okay. You want to tell me you don’t want to get back all the people Chuck vaporized? You want to tell me you don’t want to save the world?”
Well shit, so now he’s got to deal with Dean actively pushing Cas away for his own good, because he never quite gets that other people should get to make choices, even if the choice is thinking Dean Winchester deserves to be taken care of once in a while… Because he never quite gets that yeah, maybe if you stand there shouting ‘go on, can’t you see I don’t want you anymore’, someone might actually believe that, and have feelings about it-- because he absolutely doesn’t get that someone could have actual positive feelings towards him. Because he’s an
“I didn’t know. That he’d fallen off the wagon, that he was drinking again. I had thought… God, I don’t know what I thought. That he would get better. But the old man just had to prove me wrong, huh? I should’ve been there for him, but instead I abandoned him. It’d been months since I’d even spoken to him last, what kind of son does that, huh Cas?” Dean looked up, eyes filled with suppressed tears and anger and pain, breaking Cas just by looking. Just as he was about to speak, Dean continued.
Shivering from the cold, Castiel ducked inside the quaint coffee shop, inhaling the familiar scent of stale coffee and fresh baked goods.
“Yeah. I guess so. So, uh… Want to, I don’t know… meet up sometime? Like, you know, a bar… or for, lunch or… something.” Dean asked awkwardly, his face blooming bright red as he adverted his eyes. Cas felt his heart speed up as he smiled lightly.
building unbidden in his chest. Hope. Huh. That is an emotion he’s almost forgotten, as it is rarely used here, where he can have whatever he wants whenever he wants it. He finds that he doesn’t want it, actually, remembering why he’d left hope behind with his mortal body. After all, it’s hope that leads to the biggest devastation of all.
It’s when his hand twitches at the last second, causing his stone to sink in the water with a silent splash, a spasm caused by the pain within his chest squeezing tight and refusing to let go, that he lets the facade drop. It’s only for a moment, one second (if seconds exist anymore), a breath of time that he doesn’t need or experience anymore. But it’s enough to make him gasp for unneeded breath, squeezing his eyes tight as a flash of vivid blue dances in his mind, liquid and shining as a smiling mouth says words that he’d not had any time to process or respond to before it was too late. Bright blue eyes that haunt him endlessly, ceaselessly, the one thing missing from paradise that spoils the whole set.
One day, an undetermined amount of time later, a young man arrives in their heaven and he watches as his baby brother cries as he holds his son, the nephew Dean never had the chance to meet in life. The nephew he’d never gotten to see grow up.
“And now, now I’m bothering you. God, you probably don’t care, do you? You, you don’t know me, I’m just a customer to you. But, here I am, blubbering about my problems. Pathetic, that the only person I can talk to is a, a guy who serves me coffee. Stupid…” Dean muttered again, as he put his head in his hands, pulling lightly at his hair, his coffee lying forgotten on the table.
And despite himself, despite the promises he’d long ago made to stop bothering a being that stopped caring eons ago, that moved on when he failed to respond— his promise to stop picking at a wound that should have long ago healed but is now badly infected and oozing... the promise to move on and enjoy the afterlife he’d been given... despite it all, he finds himself sending up another prayer, this one more desperate and yearning than the last. Which is really saying something.
While Sam looks exactly the same as he remembers him, a middle aged man with slightly too long hair, he can see the years Sam has lived without him in Sam’s eyes, the decades of life that Dean will never touch, no matter how long they may have together in this Heaven of their own. And for the first time in decades, a hint of sorrow touches his heart as he thinks of the life he’ll never get to fully experience, the years he will only hear stories about, never live firsthand. But as he sees Sammy smile, the same smile the man has had since he was an infant... the sorrow melts away and contentment rushes back. After all. They have time. They have nothing but time, now. While he won’t be able to live them with his brother, those years gone and passed, he will be able to hear the tales. Now that he has his brother, he can finally be fully happy in this heaven they’ve been gifted. He’s sure of it.
it was supposed to be. This isn’t... this isn’t how it was supposed to go. I wasn’t... you weren’t... none of this was supposed to go like this. I was happy, before this. I was happy. But I can’t be now. Not... not now. Not now.”
Still, even as his mouth opens and his throat and vocal cords move, lips forming a word that is so deeply ingrained in his soul that he could never hope to forget it, doubt flashes through him. He’s flying too high right now and he’s terrified of the fall. But he can’t help it, and before he can stop it, the word is out, hanging in the charged, pregnant air, floating like a butterfly on the breeze.
The drives help him clear his head, let him gain control of his own afterlife. And, for the most part, things are good. Time passes the same as it always does in this realm, like water flowing in a lazy river, seconds and millennia merging into one. It’s like a blur of family and friends and joy and contentment. More friends and family join them as the years go on, the last stragglers finally catching up with them in the end, in this timeless place where anything can exist.
“Well… Thanks. I mean… I know I’m just a customer to you, but you, well… You’re kind of like my best friend. Pathetic, right?” Dean asked with a weak grin, insecurity shining in his eyes. Cas smiled softly back, feeling his heart flip slightly in his chest.
“Dude,” Sam scoffs. “You’ve seen this movie how many times? I don’t get how you manage to be surprised each time.”
Cas obliges his eager boyfriend and licks a stripe across his hole. Dean moans immediately and tries to grind down on Cas’ tongue but the angels already moved away.
When Dean returns to the bedroom Cas is still missing so he lays on the bed naked as was requested. His cock twitches slightly as he closes his eyes to try to imagine what his treat will be.
With Cas it was even worse. The dude, being an angel and all, never even had to piss. Sure, Dean was a little jealous of that. It sounded like a real time saver.
“I-I uh,” Dean stutters fidgeting with the car keys still in the ignition. “Okay. Should I stay on the line.”
“Why don’t you undress your lower half and lay on the bed,” Castiel suggests. “I think this will be easiest.”
Cas cries out when he releases and Dean swallows it all greatly. He rests his head on Cas’ lap and smiles up at him.
"Look at you," Cas says in awe. He can hear the shuffle of Cas shucking his clothes off as fast as he can. His footsteps are getting closer and then his hands are on Dean's ass rubbing it through the padding. "You look beautiful, sweetheart."
Bladder pulsing Dean really regrets downing that soda as quickly as he did. He’s jiggling his leg a little but he can hear the diaper crinkling with every slight squirm. He keeps looking at Sam through the corner of his eye trying to detect if he’s noticed anything and thus far he seems to be completely oblivious.
Cas would put a hand over Dean’s crotch and feel as the diaper grew warm and slowly expanded under Dean’s jeans. It was always a struggled to pull his hand away and not give into the urge to rub Dean to orgasm. He didn’t want to get them into the habit of unsafe driving.
The two sit nearly on top of each other curled up under the ugly yellow blanket on the couch. The only light in the room coming from the television screen. Dean had made good progress with the snack devouring nearly half the bowl of popcorn on his own. He had made even better progress on the drinks. He had managed to guzzle down a liter and a half of the sweet fizzy drink and was definitely beginning to feel it in his bladder.
Just the thought of taking a break makes Dean’s skin crawl. He knows it’s irrational, that a few short stops to just take a God damn piss are ultimately inconsequential, but what if they aren’t? What if life or death for some poor sap is determined by those few seconds? It makes him feel nauseous.
Dean just makes a tired noise before retreating to his bedroom to clean up. Cas makes quick work of putting together a PB&J sandwich for Dean. He does it exactly as Dean prefers; peanut butter on both slices, strawberry, not grape, jam, not jelly!, in the middle. He pours a cup of milk to go along with it. He’s been told milk and PB&J pair excellently together.
"Yea-yuh," Dean moans. All the water he drank in preparation is finally catching up with him and he has to press a hand against his crotch to remind him not to leak but the plug's pressure against his prostate is making it more difficult than it would normally be.
Dean shifts in his now soggy padding feeling sick to his stomach. Sam’s gonna find out. He’s going to know what a sick fuck Dean really is. That he pisses himself for fun. Dean could cry. And worst of all he still really needed to piss.
The first finger goes in easy enough with a sharp breath inward. He moves the finger in and out slowly, circling it inside every so often. He squirts a little more lube before adding a second finger and scissoring himself open. His insides are slick with lube and nearly stretched enough for the plug. He adds a third finger curling them inside himself right near his prostate but not far enough in to actually touch it. His cock is leaking against his stomach and he wants so badly to finish himself off right there with three fingers in his hole. He pants slightly as he grips the plug with his free hand.
“My beautiful boy,” Cas hums, his breath hot against Dean’s sensitive skin. He places gentle kisses against Dean’s hole, soft, barely there.
"Well, I am surprised. You're wearing the plug I got you, too," Cas teases as he continues adding pressure against it.
Cas kneads his palm against Dean’s crotch eliciting those lovely moans from his diapered boyfriend. He didn’t expect Dean to react this way. To love it so much. He fully expected Dean to just give up and pull over to use the bathroom at a gas station or in some wooded area on the side of the road. This though, this was truly surprising and Dean deserved a treat for being so good.
Dean’s quick to snatch a small bottle of white pepper from the spice aisle his hands only slightly shaking.
The tell tale pangs were just enough to have Dean squirming. And just enough to have Cas paying more attention to Dean’s wriggling than the actual movie. Which, in Dean’s opinion, was somewhat of a shame because Rocky was awesome.
"Dean, your entire life is abnormal," Cas tells him. "You hunt monsters for a living. You've died multiple times. Not to mention, you've entered a long term relationship with an angel of the Lord. Wearing diapers is probably the most normal thing you've ever done."
“So, you’re going to go into the grocery store wearing your wet diaper under your jeans and nobody will be none-the-wiser?” Cas questions cheekily. He knows what this is doing to Dean.
“Fuck,” Cas gasps. He’s snuck his hand into Dean’s sleep pants and is massaging the sodden material. “That was so hot.”
Cas lets out a moan that shocks Dean a bit and makes his cock stir. His hand travels from Dean’s bladder to Dean’s crotch. The padding is full, bloated with liquid, when he presses down on it. Dean closes his eyes and lets out a long low moan.
“Dean,” Comes Cas’ gentle voice pulling Dean out of his light doze. Dean moans grumpily and snuggles further into the pillow he was clutching. “Would you rather just sleep? Have your treat tomorrow?”
There was an erlking terrorizing children in rural Pennsylvania. Dean decided to take this one on his own as it didn’t seem too dangerous. According to Sam the lore stated erlkings could only harm children and seeing as he’s a grown-ass man and not a child he made the decision to let everyone else have a relaxing few days off. Besides, he liked hunting solo occasionally. It was one of the very few times he got to be completely alone. It may seem a tad deranged but it was relaxing.
Cas fixes him with a look that tells him he's being an utter dumbass but wraps him up in his arms nonetheless. He places gentle kisses to Dean's skin rubbing his nose along his neck.
“God, Cas,” Dean groans. “We don’t need to be talkin’ bout this. It’s nothing that hasn’t happened before.”
With that Dean does let out a sob. He has to go so badly his bladder is starting to feel hot and tingly. Cas' thrusts begin to pick up pace jostling Dean across the bed like he's weightless. He's clawing at the sheets near tears from the pleasure pain of it all.
Cas flushes a bit embarrassed to be called out. “I may have come across some websites that were less than appropriate when I was researching ways to help you last night.”
And the next case did come. Somehow, Castiel managed to weasel a way into getting Sam to stay at the bunker with Jack so it would just be him and Dean. Sam gave off five flavors of confused expressions but didn't question them too thoroughly. Dean's almost certain Sam thinks that the "case" is just an excuse for Dean and Castiel to go off and have sex privately. If only it was.
“I see,” He hums. He lays down next to Dean, placing his hand on the small of the other man’s back. Instantly, Dean feels his pain subside and he knows Cas has healed him.
Luckily, there was a Wegmans off the exit. Dean listened to Cas chat about some Netflix show Jack had him watching as he looked for a parking spot.
His spirit lifted and feeling rather devious Dean climbs onto Cas’ lap. He grinds their crotches together his diaper so wet the sloshing is audible. Cas is so hard Dean can feel him through both of their thick sleep pants and his diaper. He feels rather proud that he was the reason Cas got so worked up.
“How the hell do you know all this?” Dean questions his lips upturned, amused at Castiel’s knowledge.
“I’m sure it is baby,” Cas chuckles warmly. “Might wanna put a towel down before you sit. Sounds like you really bloated the diaper today.”
Dean snorts softly absorbing the words. Yeah, his life was pretty weird that wasn't a surprise. Maybe, putting it into perspective made it sound... Okay. He fiddles with a button on his flannel.
They crinkled in his hands and smelled a little weird. It took him a minute to figure out how to get them on while standing up. Of course, Cas had to get him the kind with adhesive strips and not just the kind he could pull up. God, this was humiliating. If only his stupid brain wouldn’t send him to a fucking panic attack at the thought of just taking a God damn three minute break.
"Dean," Cas sighs softly. He rests a hand on Dean's thigh, gives it a gentle squeeze. "You know I'm not going to judge you if you do."
“My diaper!” Dean shouts, his body growing rigid. It’s all too much. The diaper is warm and slick with precome. Cas is right there kneading his balls and holding his hand. Keeping him safe. It’s overwhelming. “I’m coming in my diaper!”
“You’re so naughty Dean,” Cas teases. “Pissing your diaper right in the middle of the store. What if that poor cashier caught you.”
Dean shivers, squirming in his seat relishing how the warm wet padding feels against his skin. Against his cock, “It’s s-so, so warm. It feels good.”
The first night was the worst for Dean. The first night after using a diaper during the day that is. He could barely sleep that night his stomach tossing and turning with feelings of guilt and shame. He shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as he did. Scratch that. He shouldn't have enjoyed it all. Despite Cas' best attempts at reassurance he still felt like a sick fuck.
He was going to be showing Cas Rocky for the first time which was exciting in and of its self but he’s also concocted a devious plan to get back at Cas for what he did at the grocery store. Dean did not appreciate being teased so thoroughly and left completely high and dry. Even if it did produce years worth of fantasies he could tap into whenever he was alone and in the mood. This time he wants to tease Cas and leave him just as frustrated, if not more. And he has the perfect plan to do so.
“That’s good,” And Dean can hear the grin on Cas’ face. “Well, I’ll let you go now. Hunt safely, Dean.”
He pulled his jeans up over the padding and checked the mirror once more to see how obvious it was he had a fucking diaper on. To his surprise he couldn’t even tell. The crinkling when he moved however. It sounded horrendously loud to him.
Dean has the perfect night planned for him and Cas. He set up the living room for a cozy movie night. Cas’ favorite extra soft sherpa throw blanket was slung over the couch just waiting for them to cuddle under. It was an ugly bright yellow color but Cas loved it so Dean tolerated it’s hideousness.
He takes a long gulp from the water bottle, a twinge already evident in his bladder, before taking his clothes off and getting comfy on the bed. Truthfully, he hated prepping himself. He’d much rather have Cas do it for him but he wanted this to be a surprise. He squirts some lube, sticky and thick, onto his fingers and circles his rim slowly. He teases himself allowing his index finger to just barely penetrate his hole before pulling away. He does this for awhile letting himself work up to full hardness in anticipation.
“Just relax,” Cas soothes. He moves his hand to rest on Dean’s stomach right at his bladder. He pushes down lightly making Dean gasp. He turns the music up with his free hand and massages Dean’s bulging bladder with his other. “Just listen to the music. You like this song. Metallica.”
“You can’t be serious?” Dean scoffs sitting up from the bed. “There is no way in hell I am wearing those.”
The diaper slowly warms under Cas’ hand as Dean releases his bladder. They feel twin shudders as the crinkly material expands.
"You need to go, huh?" Cas asks his fingers still deep within Dean. He pistons them in and out paying no mind to Dean's shaking legs and sweaty brow.
“Uh. May-Maybe,” Dean begins. He makes the mistake of looking into Cas’ eyes while trying to speak and the earnest expression sends a chill down his spine. Cas just wants to help him in any way possible. “Maybe, just this time. You can help. To see how I feel?”
His thoughts spiraling, Dean doesn’t even notice when the credits start rolling. He’s brought back to reality by Sam loudly declaring he’s going to be in the library if they need him. Dean’s pretty sure he even threw a wink in Cas’ direction.
Cas has at least tried to be sympathetic having picked up on Dean’s paranoia. The angel rubs a calming hand across his back and whispers about how he’s doing such a good job.
“I’m sorry if I don’t last very long,” Castiel sheepishly apologizes. “You managed to get me all worked up.”
“H-how do you wanna do this?” Dean croaks, his throat dry and sticky. He bites nervously at his lower lip the diaper still clutched in his grip.
“When’s the last time you wet?” Cas asks him. Dean’s fingers squish the pear pie box a little too roughly at the question.
Cas is fully erect and dripping when Dean manages to pull him out of his pants. He’s beautiful. He squirms his body across the bed until he manages to get his lips around Cas’ cockhead. Cas never liked getting deepthroated, what he loved was having his head played with.
Dean sleeps soundly for ten hours straight when he wakes up with a familiar twinge in his bladder. He cuddles into Cas who has been diligently sat by his side occupying himself with his iPad. He tugs Cas’ hand away from his CandyCrush game and puts it on his crotch.
Cas had been there for Dean through every step in this weird diaper wearing process. He’s enjoyed every step of it too, that freaky little angel. Dean can’t complain though he’s enjoyed a lot of it. But Cas has had to bear the brunt of Dean’s insecurity and today Dean wants to make his thanks known.
Dean’s legs are shaking with the need to piss and with the desire to just be able to let go, but he can’t. He can’t make himself. It’s just not natural.
Kisses are peppered against Dean’s skin. First on the back of his neck, then by his ear, then the small of his back. Cas places his lips lower and lower until he’s right at the cleft of Dean’s ass.
A shiver runs through Dean’s body, followed by a small pang of insecurity, “Is it really that obvious?”
The next part of his plan involved a lot of lube and the giant butt plug Cas liked. Cone-shaped with soft silicone and pleasant blue color. It doesn’t matter how many times Dean shoves it up his ass it’ll always look daunting.
“Oh, God,” Dean repeats hips already moving. He humps against the bed his dick rubbing against the soft thick padding of his diaper. The precome oozing from his slit assisting in that entrancing feeling. He’s never felt anything like this. It’s almost like fucking a girl but something about it feels so much better and that scares Dean a little.
“A little but I’m fine for now,” Dean bites his lower lip and evades eye contact. He’s being very obvious in his lie.
He wraps his fingers around Cas’ cock gently jerking him as he suckles the tip. Cas always tastes so sweet. He hums around Cas’ dick something he knows drives his boyfriend crazy.
Dean nods hesitantly, “Yeah, I’m fucking exhausted. I want to be able to relax and just you know having to get up, turn on the lights, and all that shit to just take a piss messes with your REM cycle or whatever... You don’t have t-“
Dean seems to finally understand and his eyes go wide and he shoots up suddenly more awake than ever.
Castiel can't help the way his hips stutter upward as the hissing of Dean releasing his bladder grows audible. "You're so hot, baby," He moans.
Cas watches as Dean walks oddly to the car. It’s clear he’s not used to the way the diaper feels around his bottom. It’s a tad amusing, but also oddly adorable. Dean looks the picture of grumpy as he slams the car door shut with a little more force than usual.
The he releases the flood gates. A steady stream of urine is pouring from his dick warm and unyielding. His already wet padding just soaks it all up. Dean’s still pissing when the cashier gives him his change. He grabs his grocery bag and books it out of there as politely as possible.
Dean gulps nervously before snatching his keys, checking that his wallet is secure in his pocket and stumbling out of the car. He pays extra attention to his reflection in the Impala’s exterior tugging at the hem of his shirt and smoothing his flannel.
Dean takes a moment to truly process the request. One day? It couldn't be that bad and he was in a lot of pain yesterday. It seems like every time he gets an infection it only gets worse. Plus, Cas is looking at him with those big stupid caring blue eyes he’s such a sucker for.
Dean’s hesitant to stand up and drop his drawers which is absurd as Cas has seen him naked on numerous occasions. Hell, Cas has had his dick in his mouth. He really shouldn’t be so nervous but he just can’t help it he is. He undresses with shaky hands and flops down on his back on the bed. He bends his knees and flexes his toes against the covers.
Castiel tried to recall the past few days. “We had the party and I wasn’t feeling well… Dean! Where are the kids?”
Castiel couldn’t answer her. His mouth froze in what felt like a manic grin before pointing at the phone. Meg lifted it and quickly scanned the e-mail. Castiel watched her brown eyes dart back and forth as she read. She looked up and smiled before pulling Castiel into a hug. “This is amazing, Clarence.” Her murmured voice actually sounded sincere for once. She pulled back and gripped his hand. “I’m so happy for you guys.”
Dean made it to the bed before Castiel. While he brushed his teeth, he heard his husband’s deep groan from the bedroom. He poked his head out the door. “You ok Dean?”
Castiel sagged in his seat and covered his face with his hands. He felt his husband’s touch on his shoulder as he gave a gentle squeeze. “Is there anything else you can tell us, doc?”
Aside from the air quotes, this guy looked dead serious. If Dean wasn’t so nervous, he’d have said it was hot as hell. That voice and that face. Oh, how he’d beg for this man…
“Two reasons. One, I thought we were becoming friends and friends care about each other’s feelings. And two, I was under the impression we were going to try and enter a more intimate relationship as well. If we are to progress as a couple, this is the sort of thing I think I should know.”
“I- I don’t know…” Castiel trailed off. Oh God. How had he never thought of all this before? What would happen to Claire?
? I see.” She straightened her posture and glared down her nose at him. “It would have been nice of the school to inform us that the parents of one of the children were deviants.”
“Oh, hey man. Haven’t had a chance to introduce myself. I’m Dean.” He held his hand over the wall for the other man to shake.
“A mini Australian Shephard. Seriously Dean-o, I couldn’t have dreamed up a better puppy for you guys.” Dean rarely saw Meg smile, but at this moment he could practically feel her glee through the phone.
“Cas, for all his crap, he cares about you. He’s a good friend and would probably get upset if you didn’t ask him. Right?”
“Yes. I must admit, I haven’t been in here much. I don’t watch a lot of television. My brother suggested I take this opportunity to expand my ‘pop culture knowledge’.”
“I said, I shouldn’t be complaining. You’ve got a lot more to deal with than I do and you’re handling way better than I am.” He huffed and stared at the floor.
the Saints. He grew up in a house decorated in black and gold. His parents had met when his dad played for the team for a few years and his mother had been a Saintsation. Mary died when he was four and John didn’t handle it very well. His father was never very present, but he did love his football. Dean and Sam were often taken to home games by his dad and uncle Bobby and they regularly had viewing parties at their house. That was the only time his old man really seemed happy. When Dean restored his Impala, he painted it black and did the interior in tan trim to try and make it as close to the team colors as possible without being
Reluctantly, Castiel agreed with Dean about getting a new car. Three children with car seats would just not fit in his Continental. They did their research and decided on a Town and Country. After being discontinued, they were much cheaper than their Pacifica replacements. Dean insisted on the ‘S’ model, “If I’m gonna drive a minivan, it’s gotta be a little sporty, Cas. Plus, the ‘S’ has better rims”. Castiel didn’t really care about rims, but he conceded that the ‘S’
Those words caught his eye and it only took a few more seconds of reading to figure out that Dean was talking about him.
“Might help. I mean, you can still talk to me but… maybe talking to people who have already gone through this?”
Patience all but squealed as she threw herself into Dean’s arms. She pulled back and chattered in rapid French as she rifled through the other clothes and poor Dean was soon very confused. When she mentioned putting the skirt on, Castiel cleared his throat. “Patience, do you need help changing?” She shook her head. “Dean and I will go check on the twins.” Switching back to English he addressed Dean. “She wants to try on her clothes.”
The music ended and Castiel stopped moving. Dean felt like he was waking up from a dream as the other man walked towards him with a smile on his face. He had a light sheen of sweat on his forehead and he was breathing heavily. Dean had never wanted anyone more. “Did you like?”
“He sure is. This guy helps me be independent. We can’t all have cute husbands.” She gave them a sly grin along with a brow waggle and Castiel was suddenly reminded of Meg. He had a feeling those two would get along.
The party was wonderful. The new couples were of great interest as was Benny and Balthazar’s announcement that they were opening a restaurant together. Everyone was sad to see Benny leave the Roadhouse, but excited to visit him at his new place. Gabriel disappeared at some point and came back as Santa; clumping down the stairs and ringing a large bell. The girls screeched and all three children ran into the room. Gabriel slowed his walk so he wouldn’t trip over Alicia (who clung to his leg like a monkey) and made his way to a special chair that Bobby had set up for him to sit in.
Castiel scoffs at the idea immediately. Dean talking about feelings? The pandemic will end before that happens.
“No. These last few months have been wonderful. If there was ever a time to get stressed, it was before the adoption. That process was not fun, but I handled that just fine. I feel like she said that just so she didn’t have to admit she had no idea what was wrong.”
Castiel fought the urge to roll his eyes. “No. Just said I would keep trying. I’m seeing him again in a few weeks remember? I’ll talk to him then if I have to.”
Castiel’s heart broke seeing Dean so lost. He collapsed next to him and rested his head on his husband’s shoulder. He felt Dean’s arm snake around his waist. “Exactly what you’ve been doing. You’ve been so wonderful about all this. Just… I just need you to
She asked a few more questions while checking out his motor functions and reflexes. “Ok Castiel, I’m not seeing anything obvious here. I’d like to send you to a neurologist and possibly a cardiologist. It could be migraines, a blood pressure issue, any number of things. There are a few disorders that mimic each other and it’s best to have a specialist clear you. Come back after you’ve seen them, or sooner if you feel worse. In the meantime, I’d like you to take something for anxiety. Stress can manifest in lots of different ways.” She scribbled something on her notepad and handed it to him.
He wasn’t expecting the entire room to explode into laughter. Cas just stood grinning at him, eyes sparkling in amusement. Dean opened his mouth to shout some more when Gabriel came and slung an arm over Cas’s shoulder. He popped a sucker out of him mouth and looked at Dean. “What’s up Dean-o? You look upset.”
His first date with Dean took place about two weeks after they met. Dean had invited him out for coffee to a little place Castiel had only visited a few times but discovered Dean actually owned. It was not your usual coffee shop for sure. While it did have a vaguely hipster-type vibe that he got from most individually owned shops, this one was more focused on classic rock. Vintage guitars and records adorned the walls along with dozens of overlapping band posters. The décor also included some 80s action and cheesy horror movie items. None of the furniture matched in the traditional sense but somehow the items complimented each other. The coffee selection was pretty standard although the names of the drinks had been changed to match the theme. There was also pie and pastries instead of the usual cookies and cakes. Even though Castiel had only spent a few hours with the man, he could easily pick up that this place was very “Dean”.
The test was loud and made his already sore head hurt even more despite the provided earplugs. Tara brought him back to his room where Dean sat playing on his phone. “Ok, Mr. Winchester, your doctor will be back after she gets the results from our neurologist. It’s late, so it may take a while for the doctor on call to get to them.”
Castiel hurried into the living room to see Dean reaching towards it. “Oh, that. Just a few things I ordered. Kind of a late birthday present for you.”
Katie and Dean stopped their continued conversation about hearing aids. Castiel hadn’t even noticed she’d removed one and was showing it to Dean. It was black and purple, had a beaded tube, and had what looked like a dragon wing attached to the piece that went behind her ear. She slipped the hearing aid back in and tilted her head. “What was that?”
He took a closer look at his friend and noticed how haggard he appeared. “Geez Cas. I know you’re not a morning person, but haven’t you gotten used to this schedule by now?”
symptom. It’s not going to stop me from getting dizzy. It’s just so I can learn to live around it. I’m still going to be broken.” He raked his fingers through his hair and gripped tightly, using the slight pain to try and ground himself.
“I understand. It is not ideal. It was why we were so excited you agreed to take all of them. It is clear they are unhappy being away from each other.”
Castiel froze in shock. That lasted for about five seconds before it started to be replaced with rage. Castiel took a breath to calm himself. “Excuse me?”
“Exactly. That may be the pressure you feel in your ears. Also, since this valve isn’t working right, it’s prone to fill and empty randomly and sometimes violently. It tells your brain you’re moving when you’re not; that’s what’s causing the spinning sensation. Now secondary hydrops is due to accident, injury, infection. It’s usually more subdued than primary hydrops; which is Meniere’s disease. The spells you’re describing don’t sound as violent as the ones I typically see in my MD patients. There’s a chance we can fix it or mitigate the symptoms depending on what type it is and what’s causing it.”
“Ok.” Dean raised his eyebrows. Castiel huffed out a breath. “I’m nervous. What if there’s something really wrong with me?”
Balthazar simply stepped over the dazed man on the floor and dragged Castiel to his office. The door closed and Castiel dropped into his chair and thunked his head against the desk. Balthazar poked him in the head. “Spill.”
“Already did. Got here early since I was by myself and knocked it out pretty quick. Oh! Before I forget, here’s your spoils for the week. We had a bunch of tourists come through. They loved the creamed honey.” Dean handed Castiel an envelope with some cash. He sold some of Cas’s honey along with his produce at his farm.
“What what?” Dean asks. He still feels a little lightheaded, but at least now he can’t chalk it up to all his blood rushing to the wrong head, because that fire’s been doused yet again by
“No offense meant, if I have implied that I care less for you to a degree you feel hurt by. You are a trusted friend-- you were the one person I knew I could turn to, who I thought would help me to keep Jack safe.”
The look Dean gives him is priceless, the impotent fury of an older brother being told if he doesn’t eat his vegetables, he’s not getting dessert, and even if he could get out of bed and to the kitchen, Sam put them up on the top shelf, and he doesn’t actually think Dean can get them if he nudges them back.
Dean’s where Sam left him, which is encouraging in that he’s not twitching and drooling on the floor or trapped in another dimension or anything. The only change is that his elbows are on the table, ass in the air.
Sam finds himself back at a point in time he remembers, in another world. This time, everything goes a little sideways, from how he remembers...
, and he’s learning.  He’s learning so much about what it means to feel things, and how to communicate, and Dean knows that’s not because he taught him how. It’s just because he’s gotten good at it.
It’s dark out when Cas comes back in, stomping snow off his shoes, soaked through. He trudges into the kitchen with a bulging QuikStop plastic bag, though before Sam can ask if he walked to the nearest gas station and back, Cas starts emptying it and he realizes he was out
“Nothing wrong with freaky stuff.” Sam feels motivated to say-- they’ll take it as him talking in defense of himself, but he can’t help but think about his own Jack, and what it was like raising him, freaky stuff and all.
The immediate look of guilt that makes itself at home on Cas’ face is almost childlike, broad and obvious.
Sam watches Dean flip through until he hits Cas. The book doesn’t have much on him, at all, but Dean starts filling some in. He gets a good paragraph written and tosses his pen down, leaving the book open to let the page finish drying.
Cas, the Cas who’s fought by their sides for years now, this is a Cas who barely knows Sam at all, and hasn’t actually known Dean for much longer.
He could do it a third time and Dean would let him. Maybe not across the forehead. But maybe not not across the forehead.
Sorry this took SO long. Between needing to focus on other things and just... getting a lot written that I wasn't happy with, it took a lot of time to feel like I was getting what I wanted.
at Dean than he already was, his expression unreadable-- enough so that Sam realizes how much of how well he can ever read their own Cas is through Cas’ changing, and not how well he’s figured out his weirdly deep, weirdly blank looks.
She’s, objectively speaking, very attractive. Full pink lips, kind of a natural beauty… short, honey-blonde hair, a spray of freckles that add to that sort of spunky-cute vibe, and… very perky, physically.
Deanna returns to her nachos, which is at least one familiar thing in an unfamiliar world. Sam’s other self has ordered some kind of roasted vegetable sandwich, which isn’t half bad-- he feels a little guilty for taking control of her body before she could get more than two bites in.
“You feel… you feel like you don’t have control, right? Like there’s nothing you can do. You’re remembering stuff that’s behind us and you’re all caught up in regretting it, like you weren’t trying to do right at the time.”
one anymore.” Sam hisses. “More concerningly, what makes you think a hymen and a-- a foreskin are remotely comparable?”
Cas leans in and sniffs, which Sam expects Dean to object to-- his Dean would tell Cas to cut it out and that humans don’t generally consider it socially acceptable to sniff each other. This Dean… doesn’t do that.
“Or ‘hey, Cas, since you’re stuck on Earth because you sided with us, you should stay here, you could have a room of your own and keep things in it’. Seriously, why not ask him?”
“No, I know. Nobody’s going to give Michael a meatsuit. God, you’re already on the run as it is, and… well. Are you sure about this? Going in there?”
Sam holds up his hands and takes a step back, leans against the Impala and watches Cas and Dean conference, huddled up by the door to the warehouse. He can’t read Cas’ lips, mostly because he’s growling and grumbling under his breath and not moving them much, but he can see his expression past Dean’s shoulder, the earnestness in those difficult-to-read emotions. The importance behind whatever he’s saying. The open despair when he shakes his head and presses something into Dean’s hand, blocked by Dean’s body so that Sam can’t see what it is. He can guess.
Sam had left some time ago, leaving the two of them to a game he had no desire to be a part of, wargaming miniatures spread out across the map table. Dean had come to him with a dusty box of the things, and Cas hadn’t even asked where he’d found them, he’d just leapt to set them up, and to hash out the rules of combat.
“I have literally never thought about that.” He takes a swig from his beer. “So what, it’s like… half there?”
“Yeah. Like that. I mean-- and I could help you, if you wanted. Give you some pointers with… You know, I’m here to help.”
“Alone and miserable. Suffering. Sure.” He nods. “That’s gonna get old fast. So… a bet. If you win, I turn on Dean. I play ball. You think he’s broken now? He’s still got one thing to lose. And you’ve got the chance to win it.”
“I come to him when he is in need of me, for now.” His head cocks to one side. “When he has fully recovered, he will no longer need me. Until then… calling distance is the width and breadth of the universe.”
“Then why are you embracing me as if you believe one or both of us will die?” Cas grunts, words muffled against Sam’s shoulder.
“Oh.” He only looks at Sam briefly, before his attention turns back to the wall. “He considers us friends?”
“I’m okay.” Dean nods-- less of a nod, more a slight jerk, and Bobby takes that for what it is. The topic is closed.
Dean is ignoring both of them. The moment he’s released them both, he’s holding onto his own shoulder. Not like it’s hurt, just like it’s more comfortable for him to stand that way. His head drops to one side, just slightly, his eyes close and it dims the glow, but there’s something soft and contemplative to his expression for a long, silent moment.
“What does it look like?” He drops the big, tarp-wrapped thing with a groan and stretches, rubs at his lower back.
He runs a hand over his head and he does not look at Castiel. A ripple of tense upset shimmers off of him, the way it had when Castiel had marveled at his humility. No-- humility is a virtue. Dean is the Righteous Man, there is much in him that is virtuous, Castiel knows this. But his aching, broken lack of self worth is
“Well, he threw ‘em and they hit the TV in the motel room, but you know. Baby shoes, the weak-ass arm of an eighteen month old… didn’t do much.”
Sam turns, and immediately forgets what it was he was going to say to Dean, at the look on his brother’s face.
, the realization stops him in his tracks. When Zachariah eased up, he wasn’t dying half as fast, but he wasn’t
Something about the idea of having sex with her still sends a knee-jerk visceral disgust rippling through him.
about Hell. Dean needs to get used to being alive again, maybe. Dean needs the familiarity of the road rolling under him, and some peace and quiet so he can get himself in order, and then he needs to talk to Sam, and Bobby just hopes whatever Sam did, it’s…
“No, believe me, I understand a whole lot more than you think right now. The veil has been freaking… lifted from my eyes here, Dean, and there’s a lot I can’t get into with you right now, but I get that Cas is important to you. I’m
“Yeah. Plus I gave him the same deodorant talk I gave you when you were twelve. Explained that soap was not optional when you’re living out of a car with a couple of other dudes, whether or not you get gungy on a hunt, basics… Basics.” He shrugs. “Anything I didn’t cover… we’ll figure it out when it comes up.”
“I drove the demon out of your circle of confidants, I thought that would be enough. But he wasn’t the real threat, and Jessica paid the price for my lack of foresight. I… This was before I knew, how big a part of my existence Dean would become. I only knew you were destined to be Lucifer’s vessel and I thought I could stop it. I couldn’t…”
“That’s how you talk to a baby?” Dean gets up, moving around the table, though he doesn’t reach out to take Jack from Cas. Still, he leans in and goes into a gentle sing-song as he addresses him. “No, no, you gotta-- Hey there, champ. Hey, buddy. Who’s a big man? Can you give me a smile, huh, little guy? Yeah, like this, that’s good… You know where your nose is? Aw, good job, champ, that’s right, you got it. You got it.”
“Charlie found it.” He beams, pointing to his chest as if it was in any way subtle. “She understands my love of wordplay. We are a modern day Algonquin Round Table.”
“Yes, in order to go unnoticed during the night. Humans sometimes find it disconcerting if they see me stand in a parking lot not moving for several hours, this seemed neater.”
“What the hell?” Dean scowls-- not at Cas, who’s staring the way he used to before a solid decade of gentle reminders about personal space and what humans consider polite versus what humans consider creepy, but at Sam. “I said this was a bad time.”
After a long silence that hovers between comfortable and awkward, they head back to the motel, where Cas disappears-- not with a flutter of wingbeats, just into thin air.
“I don’t have much choice, I know the position I’m in. This is the one place I know that Jack and I can be safe while I rest and formulate a plan for whatever comes next. But of course I would. Of course. I just… Do you remember, once-- almost a dozen years ago, I suppose that’s a long time for you…”
Although… Sam’s pretty sure Cas is looking. It’s hard to say, since Cas is pretty much always staring at Dean, but…
Sam settles down to sleep, with that assurance in place. He should be asleep in his own universe, after all, and it’s not like he can spend ten consecutive days and nights without sleeping.
It makes him feel too much at once and even when it’s over he can feel the echo of it on him and whatever it is is too
“Okay. Well… maybe what you need to do is just… feel weird, for now.” Sam nods, helpless. He gets having weird feelings you can’t put words to, he’s dealt with plenty of weird, but that doesn’t mean he has the answers Jack needs now. Cas might, but… “It’s gonna be okay-- we’re not going to give up until it is, I mean. I… I wanna try and fix something, and I don’t know if I can. It means I’m gonna go out for a little bit, okay?”
“We’ve talked about this, man.” He says, halfhearted. “It’s not in your best interests to get me all backed up.”
“Don’t need to-- For god’s sake, Dean, I don’t know what weird hang-up you have with Cas right now, but don’t take it out on me when I’m just trying to help. It’s just hustling.” He rolls his eyes, ignoring Dean’s incoherently apoplectic response. “I mean, do you really expect me to just… sit in the car every time we need money while you do all the work? I’m not a kid anymore, I can pull my own weight.”
He’d learned the word ‘gynecomastia’, too, but never felt comfortable using it. Sam could get away with spitting out nerd words. He practiced saying, instead, the completely factual ‘I got that weird thing where you grow boy boobs, and let me tell you, that was a blessing and a curse when I was fourteen’, and depending on who he had to say it to, maybe a little wink-wink nudge-nudge ‘couldn’t get me out of my bedroom for three years when those puppies came in’, but he’d also been silently relieved never to have to.
Dean was too angry to speak. He shrugged and glared at the TV. They all watched as the Saints were forced to make a field goal putting them three points ahead. The Rams were able to make a last-minute field goal themselves which tied the game and caused them to go into overtime. After an unfortunate interception, the Rams got control of the ball and kicked a last field goal to win the game.
Everyone greeted each other and shook hands before settling in their seats. Jaqueline grabbed some paperwork and addressed the group. “Today we are going to be doing another routine interview and Mr. Rocha wanted to go over the visitation schedule and further discuss the issue with Max. After we are through here, it is time to meet your children.”
Meg laid a hand on his arm. “Don’t worry Clarence, I’ll keep an eye on him. Hey! Why don’t we turn this into a baby shower?”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I didn’t steal them. They’re probably in your mailbox right now. What about vandalism for my grass?” he countered.
Traffic was horrendous and it didn’t help that his air conditioning had cut out several weeks ago. He refused to tell Dean because he knew how smug his husband would be and that he would insist on getting him a new car. Castiel liked his car. Sure, it was a bit old and maybe not the sexiest thing on the road, but he didn’t care. It got him from point A to point B and it was the first thing he bought with his own money after he left his parents’ house. If Dean could cling to his Impala, Castiel could keep his Continental. Besides, they were saving up for something much more important than a car.
He meets Cas’s eyes and the joy he sees there has him tearing up all over again. “Dean. Sweet, beautiful, incredible Dean. How could you possibly think I would ever leave you?”
“Hold on.” Gabriel ran to his car and pulled a bag out of the trunk. He came back and handed it over. “My camera is in there. You remember how to use it?” Castiel nodded. “It’s got a full battery and plenty of space on the memory card. Hide it somewhere to record when you tell him. It’ll be great to show the kid one day. Just…
It had been a long day and Dean had fought valiantly. He’d held the line against their enemies. He’d ignored the screams of the fallen. Stayed brave through the sounds of constant gunfire. Dodged every bullet sent his way. Dean Winchester was unstoppable…
He checked his watch. Any minute now. He busied himself unpacking their dinner. Ellen had packed all the toppings separately so he could reheat everything properly. After a few minutes in the oven, he was assembling the first burger when he heard the sound of the Impala pulling into the garage. He raced back into the living room to turn the camera on before going back to the kitchen.
Castiel wiped his hands on a towel before grabbing his husband’s hands. “No, sweetheart. I just wanted to spoil you a bit, that’s all. Everything’s fine.” His leaned in and kissed him softly. “I promise.”
“That’s up to you. I know she’s upset that you’ve kept it from her and you haven’t wanted to drive a wedge between her and her mother, but that hasn’t stopped Amelia from doing exactly that.”
They were almost home before Balthazar spoke again. “I know this has been a rough couple of months, Castiel. Just… try to remember you have family and friends who care about you. Don’t push us away.”
Was this because he had asked him to keep the noise down once it got late? No. That couldn’t be it. Dean hadn’t seemed upset when they’d spoken; quite the opposite, in fact. What other reason though would he have for sending this?
WaywardAngel: How would I not take offense to that? Big talk from someone who I can tell plays a lot of HS.
“Yes. I don’t even think I’ll miss him that much. It’s more that… we’d just been together so long. Three years, you know. I don’t think we were really a couple at the end. Just roommates who ate together and occasionally fucked.”
When the timers on the pizzas went off and Dean and Cas went to get them, Sam and his wife had a quick discussion. “I thought they were just friends.” Eileen signed.
Jaqueline waited just inside the doors next to a small pile of garbage bags and boxes. “Good afternoon! The children are in the playroom. Would you like to take their things out first?” She pointed towards the sad little pile and Castiel’s stomach soured.
Castiel did and he was startled when he ran into Dean. He opened his eyes to find himself several feet from where he started. “How--?”
shut it off before getting busy in front of it. Love me some porn but there’s some things I never want to see.”
“Ah.” He turned his gaze to the older girl. “Hi sweetheart. I mean, Bonjour.” He lifted his hand in a small wave, which she returned.
Castiel had listened with a growing detachment until that last part. “Hearing aids? I might need hearing aids? And what about the spinning? Will it ever stop?”
Alicia pulled away from Dean and stepped in front of Castiel. “Salut!” she all but squealed as she leapt into his arms. He caught Dean’s smile before wrapping his arms around the little girl. This was it.
Dean threw his head back and laughed. “Can’t escape me Jo. I’m your ride home. Hey, speaking of rides…”
Both men smiled widely at the affirmation and Alicia, who had been uncharacteristically quiet during the exchange, burst into giggles. “Two daddies!” More giggles. “That’s silly.”
And that's a wrap! I've been wanting to write this story for a long time and I'm so happy to finally have it finished. In case it wasn't crazy obvious, I have Meniere's disease. This story was meant to be cathartic. When I first signed up for the bang, my health was ok. That changed over the summer and I very nearly quit a few times. Major thanks to my husband who wouldn't let me give up on this.
At first, they reasoned Castiel was getting a cold or the flu, but he never got any other symptoms, so that was ruled out. There was a possibility it was his West Nile flaring up, but that seemed unlikely. Bobby even brought over his blood pressure monitor to check him during an attack, but other than a slight elevation of his heart rate, there wasn’t much change.
Cas looked like he would melt on the spot. He pulled Dean into a soft kiss. He pulled away all too quickly and smiled. “I’d like to try too. But you’re right; I do need time. I promise not to take too long ok?”
Meniere’s disease. There was finally a name for what he had. He wasn’t crazy. He was so flooded with relief he nearly forgot the most important question. “Is there a cure?”
“Dang dude. This is the Taj Mahal for torts. That looks great! Now, in about five years, he’s gonna need something bigger. I keep mine outside till it hits about 55 degrees. Then they stay in a heated shed out back.”
“Sure do. He loves it. He’s a squire to one of the knights. Carries his sword and shield.” At Castiel’s slight look of alarm, he clarified, “They’re foam. Totally harmless.”
He whips his head up and Cas is right there. He’s close enough to touch and staring at Dean intently. He looks nervous as hell, but determined. Dean notices movement and looks down in time to see Cas’s hand reach slowly towards his own. Dean takes a shuddering breath and lets his fists unclench. Their fingers tangle together and Cas feels so warm, so perfect. He feels like he’s always belonged there. Cas’s thumb grazes the back of his hand and he gives the rest of Dean’s fingers a gentle squeeze.
looking forward to the flight back.” He opened the fridge to find the cream. He was glad they paid the extra fee to have some groceries delivered before their arrival. Trying to navigate the new city to find food while they recovered from their travels would have been a nightmare. Castiel joined Dean at the little table and leaned over to look at the laminated pages his husband was leafing through. “What are you looking at?”
Christmas Eve found everyone at Bobby and Ellen’s for their annual party. They’d agreed weeks ago that Gabriel was going to dress as Santa and the kids were very excited to hear that he was visiting them and wanted to look their best. The children each had gotten a new outfit. The girls looked adorable in their sparkly dresses and Max sported the cutest sweater vest with gingerbread men on it. After greeting all the adults, the kids disappeared into the room that had been set aside for them months ago to play with their toys.
“Yes. He’s been wonderful. He coordinates with my other doctors to help figure out the best treatment plan.” Katie smiled softly and turned to pet Falcon.
“No! No. That’s not it ok? I- I don’t know to be honest. Something left over from my dad, I guess.” Castiel watched him carefully as he spoke. “Ballet is hard, I know that. I don’t think less of you. It’s impressive. I really admire male dancers. Y’all have to lift the girls and make it look effortless and you have to be flexible and in shape and… no. I don’t think ballet is just for women.”
Dean looked upset. “Oh crap Cas. I’m sorry man. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot like that. Shit, I never know when to shut up. Look, it’s ok. If you ever need anything, you can call
“Just a little.” Dean rubbed circles into his back. He didn’t seem to be able to keep himself from doing it. “Anything else?”
Dr. Adamson did a standard ear exam and then broke out honest-to-God tuning forks. He spoke out loud as he did each and every test; voicing what he was ruling out. He confirmed that Castiel seemed to have some hearing loss in the lower tones, but wanted another hearing test to be certain.
After he placed a kiss on Castiel’s neck, Dean nudged him back under the spray to wash the suds away. Castiel closed his eyes and just enjoyed the sensations of his husband’s fingers moving across his skin. The previous arousal that had flagged as he became more relaxed quickly started to come back at the first brush against his cock. Dean took hold of his dick and gave it a few gentle pumps. His eyes shot open and Castiel moaned as he leaned closer into Dean’s space. His cock continued to harden and he gripped Dean’s shoulder as one particular twist of the wrist sent a bolt of pleasure through his body. He tried to bring the other man closer, but Dean brushed him off and dropped to his knees before wrapping his lips around Castiel’s length.
With only two days left until their flight home, Castiel and Dean took their children to the zoo. They had a great time. The kids had never been to a zoo before and were thrilled at the variety of animals they had only ever seen in books or on television. They particularly enjoyed the redfoot tortoise exhibit. Alicia could not stop laughing at the slow-moving animals and even Max cracked a few smiles. Castiel took photo after photo. He was now on his second memory card of the trip, but he didn’t care. He was determined to capture as much as he could.
He hauled Castiel up and set him in a chair at the table. He then grabbed the bucket and cleaned in out in a nearby bathroom. After returning to the kitchen, he made Cas drink more water and then got started on the burgers. Every now and then, he’d glance over at his friend to see him watching his movements with unfocused eyes.
Sam blushed while Eileen tried to hold back her own laugh. “When Sam started coming in for private signing lessons.”
“Don’t worry sweetheart, I’ll take care of you.” Cas reached for the lube and squeezed some onto his fingers. He wrapped one arm around his husband’s waist as he slipped a finger back inside. Dean groaned again as Castiel pumped in and out. He was soon able to add another and laid kisses and sucked bruises along Dean’s shoulder as his husband writhed underneath him.
going to be someone who is sicker than you. The more you hang around other disabled people the more you’re going to realize that. You’ve got a chronic illness. You’re allowed to be upset. You’re allowed to
The next week was spent meeting with their caseworker from the local agency and their immigration lawyer to fill out forms with the children’s information to petition U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services to find them eligible to immigrate. They met with possible therapists for Max and with their local school board to see if they could provide services for Patience until she became more fluent in English or if they would have to find a private tutor in the interim.
That was as far as he read. He could no longer see through the tears gathering in his eyes. He covered his face and his shoulders shook as he let out a small sob.
Castiel smiled at her enthusiasm. “Of course you can.” He handed her the other rake and they got to work.
“Alright. Well I don’t want the kids seeing you like this. Go straight up and get in bed. I’ll bring you some water.”
Dean pushed into the room and dragged Cas to sit next to him on the bed. “What’s wrong? Is it what I said?”
. There was screaming, cursing, and not a happy face in sight. Everyone from those covered in body paint to the grey-haired fans were all feeling the same rage. Castiel stood stock-still, mouth open in shock. He turned to Dean and blurted out a disbelieving, “What the fuck? This is absurd.”
Castiel tried to look intimidating, but wasn’t sure if he pulled it off. He dropped his voice, “I should teach you a lesson.”
Castiel let go. He cried and cursed the universe for his shitty luck. He cursed encephalitis-causing mosquitoes and his broken ears and every crappy doctor who didn’t take him seriously. He cried for the life that was stolen from him and for everything he’d already lost: his job, his cousins, time with his family.
“Hey guys. See ya met Cas.” He signed the few words he knew as he spoke. “Thought y’all might wanna play Monopoly.”
Balthazar did end up booking a stripper. She came dressed as a naughty nanny and simply read a copy of ‘Go the Fuck to Sleep’ before adding it to the pile of gifts and leaving with all her clothing intact. He also got them ‘You Have to Fucking Eat’ and ‘Nobody Likes a Cockblocker’. Castiel wasn’t sure if he should be amused or annoyed.
“Then what’s the problem? Are you alright?” His eyes moved over Dean’s body as if he expected to find something physically wrong.
He went through a few more e-mails before he came across one that stopped him in his tracks. His heart started pounding and he felt like he couldn’t catch his breath. Fingers slightly trembling, his clicked on the one that read, ‘Brazilian Council for Intercountry Adoption’.
Ellen made a sympathetic noise and pulled him into a hug. “I’m sorry, honey.” She pulled back. “It’ll be alright. I never liked you workin’ there anyway. It didn’t make you happy.”
The package looked innocent enough at first. It was small and made of bubble-lined black plastic. A little label on the side grabbed his attention.
They didn’t have to wait long before Castiel was pulled back to an exam room. Castiel’s doctor (a beautiful woman of Indian descent) insisted they call her by her first name, Kali. Castiel told her what he could remember and Dean filled her in on what had been going on for the last few months and what his other doctors had said. She listened while she stitched up the gash on Castiel’s head. Dean held his hand but stared intently at the wall. His husband had an extreme fear of needles but he refused to leave, even though he was pale and sweating. Gabriel tried to act serious but couldn’t seem to help cracking inappropriate jokes and flirting shamelessly with Dr. Kali. Dean and Castiel glared but the doctor found him hilarious and it only encouraged him to keep going.
He shouldn’t read any more. He really shouldn’t. It’s such a horrible breach of Dean’s privacy… but… he has to know. He pined over Dean for years (who was he kidding, he never really stopped) before writing off the idea as a fantasy that would never come to pass.
When the time came to leave, Castiel disappeared into the kitchen to start washing dishes and Dean walked them out. Sam lowered his voice as he talked to his brother. “So, Cas seems nice.”
“Generally, yes. It’s like hearing loss. Some people lose their hearing from loud noise and some because of a degenerative condition. Different causes with similar outcomes. Of course, with both forms of hydrops, inner ear function will continue to decline if the pressure keeps increasing. Meniere’s patients sometimes need more intervention in the form of steroid shots to the inner ear or sac decompression surgery. The sac can even be removed, but we only do that in extreme circumstances as it causes deafness and permanent imbalance. Secondary hydrops usually doesn’t require such invasive treatments.”
Gabriel and Meg were still going strong. They had a three-year-old son named Loki. Although the boy was gentle and sweet, he was already incredibly sneaky and could put up some pretty logical arguments for a toddler. Castiel remembered Gabriel acting the same way when they were younger and constantly wondered how his parents had put up with it. Apparently, good teeth were also genetic because logically the boy shouldn’t have any left after all the sugar Gabriel let him have. He and Meg spoiled him rotten, but had already declared one child was enough for them. They also swore they would never get married. Castiel knew it wasn’t because they were unsure of their relationship, they just preferred not conforming. He was a little sad that he’d never stand up at his brother’s wedding, but they had asked him to be Loki’s Godfather to make up for it.
“You recognized me, when you woke and saw me here. You didn’t leap to your brother’s defense, or look at me like a stranger.”
“Didn’t need anything.” He shoves his hands into his pockets with an easy shrug that’s not fooling anybody. Because if there’s one thing he’s damn good at-- after ganking evil-- it’s blowing his chances with Cas.
“I do not need to consume anything, drink included.” He looks to him, uncertain, only to stiffen when Dean noses at his neck.
“Yeah. Well.” He swallows, and leans in. Turns his hand to take Cas’, stilling him. Keeping him. “I still appreciate it.”
“I need to speak with your brother. Alone.” He grinds the words out without looking at Sam, although Sam’s pretty sure Cas still
“They are my brothers. But it is not the same. Not the same as the relationship you share with your brother.” He shrugs-- at least, that’s the best description Sam has for it, it’s barely a movement, an almost birdlike tic of the head, but it has the energy of a shrug somehow.
Dean just hums, already half asleep, and after Sam lays down salt lines, he ducks into the bathroom, makes sure the water’s running and that they have toilet paper and soap. He’s checking the kitchen sink when Cas comes in carrying basically all their stuff. Not the gear they keep in the trunk for hunts, but all their personal crap and a couple bags of what Sam hesitates to call ‘groceries’, given that Dean bought them at the last gas station, but… well, shit’s edible. He hopes.
“So… you agree that I seem poised to win the favor from you?” Cas rises, scooting his own pieces where he wants them, and removing one of Dean’s ballista units from the field. “You shouldn’t have left this open to attack. Your forces on this continent are going to suffer considerably from this loss.”
