“I’m right flush,” Wiggins said. “I go to the music hall and have a pint any time I like. I even went down to Brighton the summer last with a bloke I know. I even bathed in the sea, I did! And I owe it all to the Guv’nor.”
The Irishman viewed my progress with a wary eye, but I think he was also proud of my initiative. He often asked me questions about my studies, and I was surprised – although I should not have been, considering the power of his mind – at his knowledge of things outside of Mathematics, such as Chemistry, Physiology, and even Anatomy.
I nodded and tipped my hat to her, but she turned up her nose and tugged at the poodle’s lead. I was obviously beneath her interest. It must be my clothes. Must be. Because my person is pleasing to the ladies. I know that from personal experience.
But the truth was that I wanted badly to live there. The thought of returning to Earl’s Court and the dark and musty bedsit was more than I could endure.
“So,” said Holmes. “Mr. Michael Wiggins, formerly of the Baker Street Irregulars. And, if am not mistaken, this is Dilly Mitchell, the paramour of our client, Mr. Charles Griffith.”
“I will have you, Johnny Lad,” he whispered. “You may count upon it. I will have you, body and soul. Because I know what you want and what you need: a man who is everything to you – friend, companion, comrade-in-arms, father, brother, and lover. Together we will defeat all our enemies and rule a dominion unseen by men without vision. Once I thought I had found my perfect soul-mate, but he proved false. One day he will pay for that rejection. But you will not reject me, John. I will have you. I will be the first to possess you. And then I will always own you.”
She also refrains from killing him. In that, she is a decided improvement over my esteemed friend with whom I share rooms in 221b Baker Street, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
“That you loved me. Not simply as a friend and companion, but... as something more. I knew you had loved both men and women in your life, but I also knew that for years you had suppressed your desire for men... until recently. But during the years we have been together I also have suppressed my desire – but that desire was for a single person, a person I could not reveal myself to out of fear of the strength of my emotions. So I channeled that desire into my work. And when I could constrain it no longer, I sought the ring, hoping it would be beaten into submission. When even that did not suffice, there was always the needle.”
“I know,” he said, lighting the pipe and puffing it contentedly. “That is what makes it so strange. And so very wondrous.”
“A habit of manners, my dear boy,” he said. “Besides, I wish to insinuate myself into your good graces. If you are going to lodge with me I want you as an ally and not an enemy.”
The Irishman regarded me darkly with his piercing grey eyes. But then he laughed. “Damned but I believe you would!” And he kissed me right on the mouth as we sat in the café. “I feared that all the spirit had been beaten out of you, caro mio.”
“The Red Cockerel,” I pronounced, looking at the sign swinging above the door. “Isn’t this the place Young Griffith mentioned?”
“So that is how you knew,” I said, feeling utterly undone. “I’ve been a damned idiot! How you must have despised me!”
“You will never be asked to join the Order of the Garter with that attitude towards sodomy,” I pointed out. “And a knighthood is out of the question.”
“What idea could he possibly get?” Holmes said in his infuriatingly calm manner. “What could be more innocent than two men with an intimate connection who have shared an abode for many years lounging companionably together in bed?”
“A reputation?” I blinked. “If you mean he is well-known as a genius of deduction, a Bohemian and eccentric, and the world’s only private consulting detective, then he has that reputation.”
Holmes nodded. “I haven’t forgotten. That’s heroism, my dear fellow, not thrill. You walked boldly into the mouth of battle because that was your duty, that was the calling of your honour. But to seek danger when you could seek safety, that’s a distinct kind of excitement.”
I waited until the Irishman was in a sweetened mood before I broached the subject, laying out my rationale for this study and pointing out that having a personal physician would serve him well – he would never need to wonder if he could trust a stranger with his life and well-being. Needless to say, he did not immediately agree to my proposition, but he could see the advantages to it.
“Sheridan?” I said, my memory recalling something I’d learned recently in Sussex. “Your brother named that creature after the Seventh Earl of Sherringford?”
I didn’t remember such a package coming to Baker Street, although I usually retrieved the mail each day, so it must have come in that morning’s early post. My curiosity overcame me and since it had already been opened and perused...
Holmes set down the pot and picked up his cup. “I am going to my room. I’m fatigued and I must get up early tomorrow to meet with the lawyers before they question Wiggins and Mitchell.”
At the age of 16 I was dispatched to Holland, to a Jesuit seminary surrounded by water, to be trained as a missionary priest. What I remember most about the place was that dank canal water. You could not travel anywhere except by boat and the country was low and flat and wet, the sky always a foreboding grey. Or so it seemed.
“That puts my poor mind at ease,” she sighed. “When your servant said you could not receive visitors I imagined the worst.
“It was a delight, John,” Wilde bowed. “And I shall be looking for your tales in ‘The Strand.’ I adore stories of suspense and adventure. I would love to try my hand at one some day.”
I smiled at the revelation of Holmes as Puck, orchestrating rehab, both the inane and the sublime, for his own amusement.
“On the contrary, there is much to say.” Holmes began pacing back and forth, puffing smoke like a freight train. “Blackmail, suicide attempts – these things do not occur out of thin air!”
“That reminds me, Mr. Holmes,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Your rent was due yesterday. And that includes the added charge for cat-meat for Wiggin’s Moggy.”
“Is that the way it had to end?” I asked later that night. Holmes had left his bed after turning out the lights and come into my room. That was the way of it – he always came to me. And always after it was dark and everyone else abed. “Is that the way it always has to end? A dying secret in a God-forsaken place?”
“I put a hot brick wrapped in flannel at the bottom of your bed, sir,” he said. “It’s freezing in here of a night, but that’ll make it toasty as a kitchen when you get in.”
So across the Continent we moved, from one grand hotel and villa to the next, eating in fine restaurants, attending elegant parties, and mingling with wealthy and titled people. Everywhere we went the Irishman bought me things – suits and boots, jewelry and watches, golden cigarette cases, rare books, anything I saw and fancied, until we were laden with luggage like an army traveling with a city in its wake.
“I give any calling cards to Mr. Sherlock,” said James, his chin held defiantly high. “And Mr. Sherlock also gave me orders that you were not to be disturbed, Dr. Watson. I was only following his specific directions.”
“Calm yourself, my dear boy,” said Holmes. “Mycroft has provided a specialist for Mr. Mitchell’s care. Of course, the irrepressible Mr. Wiggins is none the worse for wear for his sojourn in the Bridewell.”
“That you belong to him – lock, stock, and barrel!” James pronounced in a way that made me hear Holmes’ voice echoing in the words. “And that no confounded female is going to come between you!”
It had been a long day and I was sick of unsolved enigmas. “Why did you call Mycroft ‘His Lordship’? I want to know!”
I knew I must wait for word from Holmes and not lead the Irishman to his door. That would defeat all I had gambled upon. The only thing to do was to attend Stamford’s that evening and take dinner with him and his wife. That would discharge my final social obligation before I took leave of my old, simple, and cherished life.
I have a full-length Victorian story in this Universe which I may begin posting later, if there is any interest.
“A valet is a waste of good man power,” Holmes said dismissively. “I will take care of my own unpacking and dressing, as will Watson. We are both able-bodied fellows, fully competent to care for our own needs!”
“You can tell me, Barton,” I coaxed. “If the lad is in trouble, then my intimate companion Mr. Sherlock Holmes will come to his aid, as he has for countless others, both great and humble. The major said it would be the ruination of their family, but surely it can’t be as bad all that.”
“Oh, an Affirmation!” Holmes returned. “You mean you want me to tell everyone how happy I am to be here, like dear Betty. And how I look forward to being cured of what society deems bad for me so that I may join the grateful throng of drones who perpetually do what is appropriate. Is that what you want me to say?”
“If he gets... away... then all is for naught.” I sank lower into the mud, my body heavy. So heavy. The rain began again. But it wasn’t rain drenching my coat, my trousers. It was blood. My own blood. “Holmes... Moriarty... don’t... delay...”
“Undoubtedly.” I set down my newspaper. “Why would they want you to go there specifically? You have shown little interest in art in the years I have known you.”
“The boy is a fool,” Holmes said dismissively. “He imagines he’s in love and so is willing to sacrifice all – his fortune, his good name, even his life. Such poppycock!”
Mick Wiggins looked weary and soiled, but compared to the pathetic Dilly he was as on holiday. He leaped up and broke into a broad grin when he saw us. “Doctor! And the Guv! You gents look a rare treat. I knew you’d come to spring me!”
“You would know that as well as anyone, Doctor,” said Mrs. Jenkins. “Being his... his only real friend. I mean, that ever he’s had.”
“I have the privilege of being not only your friend, but also your physician,” I answered firmly. “I thought the rationale behind this sojourn was rest and recovery of health after the long winter’s siege – my health and yours!”
I enjoyed myself in Paris more than I can say, but unfortunately war broke out between the French and their eternal adversaries, the Germans. I ignored the fact that I was dancing on the lip of a volcano until the Prussian Army was at the very gates and the city effectively under siege. It was my first taste of war and would not be my last, although I must say that experiencing war in Paris and experiencing it in the bleak Afghan mountains are quite different things. By Christmas it was obvious the city could not hold out much longer and, sadly, I collected my belongings and made my way out, not wishing to meet up with any Prussian officers who might decide that the sodomitical virginity of a foolish English boy was their due as victors.
“A late riser,” he commented. “But then I imagine you need your weekend rest. Come and have some coffee. I also took the liberty of helping myself to a slice of your bread, but I couldn’t find a toaster.”
And, he was telling me, being seen with eligible females would quiet the gossip about Holmes and myself.
And so I found myself being guided away from Piccadilly and towards Leicester Square. I recognized the Salisbury, which is on St. Martin’s Lane, as a theatrical public house. I had never been there myself, but knew its reputation as a meeting ground for actors, producers, playwrights, and other types who populate that dramatic milieu.
“None whatsoever,” I acknowledged. I stood and felt a cramp in my bad leg. I shook it out as best I was able, but I was glad a hot bath awaited me upstairs. “Are you coming up?”
“Robbie reads everything and knows all the writers in the city,” Wilde explained. “Many of them are here tonight, along with some of our most illustrious artists and actors. And some that are not so illustrious, of course – all incognito, naturally. But I make no distinction whatsoever. I welcome the attentions of anyone who acknowledges my genius.”
“My needs have been quite well satisfied,” sighed Holmes, reaching for his pipe. “A brief nap and I will be refreshed and ready for more, I vow.”
“That was splendid!” I praised to my hostess. “If your husband eats like this every day then soon he will not fit through the front door!”
“No one,” he said. He was older and shorter than I, but gave the impression of being a taller man by his stance and manner. His shock of dark hair was untamed and he hadn’t shaved in days, but that seemed normal in a place like this where formality counted for little. His large hazel eyes darted back and forth compulsively and his expressive hands were jittery as he spoke in the short, quick bursts characteristic of an addict on edge. Or an addict who was no longer an addict, at least in theory. “It’s obvious.”
I found my own way out of the Diogenes Club without catching sight of Mycroft or anyone except the silent porter at the door.
“I don’t know his name,” said the boy, trembling with real fear. “I don’t think he has one. Not a real one, anyways. But when they call him anything at all, they call him the Professor.”
He squinted at my wound. It was minor compared with what Holmes had endured, but I knew the Irishman well enough to gauge his reaction. He had an almost pathological fear of injury and disease. Long ago I used that apprehension to convince him to let me begin my medical studies. I told him that having his own physician, one he could trust implicitly, would be to his benefit. And it worked – for a while.
“Investigate,” said Holmes. “I am convinced that establishment is connected to William Fisher’ murder. He was a procurer for that house. He recruited both Wiggins and Mitchell, as well as this boy, Thommie. Gaining entry to the place is critical if we are to find evidence to free the lads. Why so reluctant? You cannot tell me that you have never crossed the threshold of a brothel, Watson, for I know that is not the case.”
“Holmes!” I cried, springing to his side. I turned him over. His white linen shirt was red on the right where blood was seeping through badly applied toweling. “I told you he needs to go to a hospital!”
“The weather has been foul, sir,” said Lovell. He stopped and opened a door. “Your usual room, Mr. Sherlock. I received your telegram this morning, so I instructed Mrs. Jenkins to light a fire. I hope it will be satisfactory.”
Campton Grange was a newish house, perhaps fifty years old, and not very impressive compared to Sherringford Hall. But it was clear that the family who lived there was prosperous and the place had a brighter prospect than Holmes’ gloomy family manse.
“I’m having a drink at the Criterion, sir,” he said without even a trace of shyness. “It’s just down the way. Care to join me?”
“Your dinner party with Dr. Stamford,” he reminded me. “You dine at eight o’clock in Chelsea. Don’t you remember?”
Perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps the house was empty, with the Irishman and his servants fled long ago. But the yard, although forlorn, did not look abandoned. And the gate, although closed tight, was not rusty.
Fred stared at Holmes with genuine loathing. But he was a professional, I must give him that much. “You have been here three months, Sherlock. You know what an Affirmation is!”
I was dozing by Dilly Mitchell’s bedside and Holmes was quietly smoking his pipe when Constable Clark came in and tapped Holmes on the shoulder. “Mr. Griffith has arrived, Mr. Holmes.”
But would that be the whole of my life? I had always hoped for more. A home and family I might call my own. Domestic happiness. Things Holmes eschewed and even mocked outright.
“Here, Gladstone!” called James. “This way, boy!” The dog was off his lead and wandering in the direction of the lake.
Holmes took out his ring of lock-picks. “This should be simple enough. I imagine a firm kick would do just as well.” But he chose an implement and fiddled with the lock for less than a minute before the door swung open.
“I don’t,” Holmes admitted, wincing as I swabbed. “When I felt the pressure in my side I turned and glimpsed my would-be assassin, recognizing him as one of the Professor’s more lowly henchmen, a man named Redmond. I have already sent his name to Lestrade, along with the names of the killers of William Fisher, but whether our friend from Scotland Yard will act upon this valuable information is up to debate.”
My ears perked up like a foxhound that hears the bugle, but I shook it off. I was not expecting to meet anyone in this part of town. Unless, of course Stamford might be on his way to the Criterion and thereby hail me. But this voice was nothing like Stamford’s baritone. Instead, it was a high voice. Not feminine, but more a light tenor. And the inflection was decidedly of the lower orders. Even, perhaps, that accent from the vicinity of the Bow Bells that some term Cockney.
A woman who had seen better days laughed loudly as I passed by. “Now there’s a rare toff! On your way home to the wife and kiddies, squire?”
“Oh, two, if you please,” said Holmes. “I feel the need for a little sweetness tonight, Watson. It feeds the mind. And I have much to think over.”
I drank my tea and nibbled at a teacake, feeding the rest to Gladstone. Then I fetched the dog lead and put on my greatcoat. It was April, but the weather was still chilly and I had no wish to catch my death of cold after having survived the long and miserable London winter.
“If you wish to question Mr. Fisher, you are an hour too late.” Lestrade glanced down at the corpse, which was already beginning to stiffen. “We have everything under control here, Mr. Holmes. And you may put away your gun, Doctor. We have the victim – and we have the perpetrators. There is no need for your services tonight.”
I thought of the miles upon miles I had walked in the Afghan mountains, never knowing if the next step would be my last. But here I was safe in my own land, with a stout companion who would never fail me at my side.
“You are too modest, sir,” she said, lowering her eyelids most fetchingly. “A gentleman such as yourself, a doctor and a stalwart soldier, must have had a great many adventures to relate in which you are the hero – and not your friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!”
That did not mean the Diogenes Club, but Mycroft’s personal rooms in Pall Mall. I knew they were very near the club, which was also in that street, but I had never been there. Mycroft was a secretive and solitary fellow, not given to extending invitations even to his brother and his brother’s longtime compatriot.
I finished stitching and bandaging, then eased Holmes back upon the pillows. “Will you return to Baker Street tonight? I can try to make you comfortable in a hansom.”
“I don’t know about that.” Holmes propped himself up on one elbow and studied me. “Addiction to prescription narcotics after two extremely severe wounds suffered in the service of one’s country does not signify someone who is either an ass or an idiot. It suggests a man who has endured much and fought a valiant fight. Many strong men have traveled a similar difficult path.”
He was still for some moments, as if considering. We lay there so quietly I could hear his heart beating. It was a sound that made me happier than I have ever been in my life.
To my shame, Young James was asleep on the sofa of the sitting room. When he heard the door open, he sat up and gazed at me sadly.
Then one Friday night, facing a long, depressing weekend, I buried my inhibitions and entered the fray. I went to a pub I’d walked by a number of times. It seemed more low key than the ubiquitous Coleherne, the music not as loud and the shaved-headed contingent less obvious. I straightened my resolve, adjusted my tie, and plunged forward.
My brother, misguided fool that he was, sneered at the Irishman, which, I am convinced in retrospect, sealed his downfall. “I will judge as I will. You have made my weak-minded brother into your catamite, to his shame and mine! If I had a stick here, I would beat you with it!”
“Never fear, my dear boy,” he replied, unruffled. “Lovell is used to my jests. He was on the receiving end of many of my pranks when I was a lad, weren’t you, Lovell?”
“No, it is not my wound,” he insisted, setting his pipe aside. “It’s the memory of... of my own youthful folly.”
“Perhaps you have that kind of self-control,” I retorted hoarsely. “But I doubt I’ll be able to stop myself from...” I gasped as he took a firm hold of my cock. “Good God, Holmes! I can’t... I just... can’t!”
“I think you should go up to bed,” he said, cutting me off. “We will make an early start tomorrow and there is much work to do in London if the Griffith case is to proceed. We could tarry here another day or even a week, but what help will that be to Young Charles?”
“I will make no further comment on that,” I sighed. “But I too wish to examine the lad in the morning. He seems to have sustained no substantive physical damage, but his state of mind is another thing altogether. A man who attempts suicide once is always in danger of trying it again, especially if his difficulties have not been alleviated.”
“I remember little of India,” Miss Morstan admitted. “Except that it was very hot. And there were monkeys in the trees in our garden. I was delighted by the monkeys!”
“Certainly not!” I insisted. “They offer, but I always refuse. Then they laugh and offer me more. I thought it was a game to them to try to wear down my resistance.”
He stopped me. “But I do understand, my dear fellow. It is you who don’t understand. And I apologize for that, but it could not be helped.”
“What fun would that be?” he opined. “I spent the day touring the hives and observing the bees, but it was not very enjoyable without someone to explain them to.”
“A chimpanzee,” Mycroft corrected. “Part of a government experiment in mind control. The animal has been taught to play chess, but, unfortunately, his moves are quite rudimentary.”
“The more fool you, then!” I huffed. And I began walking away, towards Trafalgar where I might find a cab.
“Never looked at it that way,” the captain admitted. “But you can’t count savages the same as good, honest Englishmen, can you?”
“At your service, sir. Just call if you’re needing anything.” He bowed and left me alone in the dark and cavernous room.
Holmes stared at the fellow with an appraising eye. “I am Sherlock Holmes and this is my intimate friend, Dr. Watson. We are here to collect a few belongings of a friend of ours, Mr. Michael Wiggins, who is... um... going to be away for a short while.”
“I see,” I said, wondering how they ever survived at school with such names. “And that’s why you prefer to be called Holmes.”
“Don’t say that!” Mick cried. “You and me have been together since we was pups. I’ve always looked after you and I’ll keep looking after you. I swear I will!” Mick turned and saw Holmes and I standing there. “Here’s Dr. Watson! He’ll make you better! I know he will!”
And I had never cared before about that. I was content to live in the light of his brilliant sun. To bask in his heat. To be grateful for every crumb he tossed me, never expecting more.
James went down to get my toast and I considered all I had to do in the next two days. Settling my accounts would be fairly simple – I had some money in the bank, enough to cover my modest outlays. Luckily I had not been indulging in betting on the horses as of late. And my practice would be in good hands with Dr. Anstruther. Perhaps I could even direct a few of my patients to Stamford, although Chelsea was a bit far from Marylebone. Mrs. Hudson might cry when I told her I must leave – that would be difficult to bear. But it would not be a total surprise to her, for we had already discussed it. And I realized that the idea of leaving this place – and forsaking Sherlock Holmes – had been growing in my mind for a long time. But it took the Irishman to put the plan into place.
“I don’t know, Guv.” Mick Wiggins sank down in the straw and held his head in his hands. “I can’t talk about any of that. I can’t! He’ll have me killed like he had Bill killed! And he hates anybody who peaches. He can have me gutted any time he wants, even in this prison. He can get to anybody, anywhere!”
It sounded odd to hear Holmes referred to as the young master. I tried to picture him as a boy, but never had a man seemed to have been born fully formed as did Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes’ hazel eyes were on me, unblinking. “I think you do, Doctor. You have faced down evil. And so have I.” He tossed his head, as if shaking that evil off his shoulder. “But no matter. I will take your case, Charles. You are now my client and I will not rest until you have justice.”
“A stab wound. From a fairly short knife. Perhaps even a penknife. Made from behind. By a right-handed man.” I opened my bag and took out a solution of antiseptic phenol and some cotton. Then I cleansed my hands with the carbolic to prevent further contamination.
And when the Irishman was done with me, another, lesser man would probably take me up, and so it would go. I’d seen it happen to women and I had pitied them. But I vowed not to pity myself. I vowed to find some way to survive without becoming something that the world would despise.
It irked him that I had been out. But it irked him more that I would say nothing about that evening, where I had been or what I had done. But I had vowed to myself that I would never relate what had passed then to any man. Or woman. But especially not to him.
So many things told me to turn down Holmes’ offer. I knew so little about him – and what I did know left me puzzled and apprehensive. That his brother was ridiculously wealthy was evident, as was the fact that Holmes was the black sheep of some ancient and eccentric family.
The servant led me up the stairs and directly to the Irishman’s room. It was the same room he and I had inhabited before. He knocked once and pushed the door open. I walked through, to my meet my fate.
Then I went back into my bedroom and took out my pistols. I have two – the service revolver I brought back from the East and a newer American Colt. One is a familiar old friend, but the other has a keen and deadly accuracy. If there was to be a standoff, I did not want to be left flatfooted.
“Oh, Dr. Watson,” said Mrs. Hudson, coming in to take away the tray. “You’re up already! I’ll go and get your breakfast. Mr. Holmes was up very early. He said he had much business to take care of this morning.”
Three patients. That wouldn’t seem a great number to an established physician with a thriving practice, but to me it was three more than I would have had a few months ago, when I often sat for hours waiting for even a single client to darken my door. It was during that period that I began to write down a few notes about the exploits of my good friend Sherlock Holmes. Just for my own amusement, of course, since many of his cases involve the great and mighty of this and other lands, and most are of a sensitive and often personal nature. But I find that I enjoy penning these narratives. I flatter myself that I have a flair for framing a story and parroting dialogue. Perhaps I might try my hand at something for the theatre one of these days.
“I hope you slept well last night,” he said, still perusing the countryside. “I know your rest is often compromised.”
If I was never to see Holmes again, then I knew I must write him a letter of explanation. I owed him that much at least.
“Then, if you really do care for me, you will give me a chance to live. Not to spend the rest of my life running and fearful, a hunted thing. I want to walk freely again, while I still have the chance.”
“Solitary, but not lonely,” Holmes shrugged. “I made my own life even as a boy. I studied and in my spare time I read the popular papers – the servants gladly obtained for me the most lurid of the penny presses in return for a small fraction of my allowance. Crime in all its aspects intrigued me from an early age. I remember reading ‘Macbeth’ and thinking that the man might well have gotten away with his murder if only he had not depended on an hysterical female as his partner in crime!”
He shrugged. “Don’t know, really, Doctor. Mebbe sixteen or thereabouts. I was born in the Workhouse and they didn’t keep no records of that fatal day. Or if they did, they didn’t tell me before I scarpered out of there.”
“No,” he sighed. “But your touch is driving me mad! For God’s sake, John, get the rest of my clothes off or I’ll start screaming!”
I walked around, taking in the scene. It was too discombobulating to be offered all this on a silver platter. Or perhaps my skeptical nature was making me overly wary. “Did your brother live here?” The flat was clean, but had the dusty veneer of a site long out of use.
Holmes reached for his pipe and filled it. He had smoked a small bowl at the table after dinner, but since we had retired to the library with the sherry decanter, he had refrained until now. “The natural sciences – that was my father’s realm.”
A glum butler in a faded tailcoat was there to greet us, bolstered by a red-faced housekeeper and a gaggle of servants who gaped as if we’d arrived directly from the moon.
“Yes, it was wonderful, Jane,” Miss Morstan added. Then she turned to me. “I am a governess and although my employer, Mrs. Forrester, keeps a decent kitchen, I rarely have a meal such as this.”
“My profession,” he said, deftly discarding his clothes. “You don’t think I makes all my crust delivering messages, do you? I usually charge five shillings for a toss-off and another five bob for a suck, but for you, Doctor, it’s nothin’. I’ve always had a yen for you. Thought you was a handsome bloke. Different from the Guv. More smooth, like. Refined. But the genteel toffs is the best fucks, I finds. Once they give in, they give it all they got! I’ll even let you brown me, if that’s your fancy. And I don’t bend over for just any man, believe me.” He reached into my trousers and seized my member. “That’s a beauty, Doctor! A real beauty!”
“Wait until we take to the open road, Watson,” said Holmes as he breezed through another red light. “We can motor down to Sussex and spend a weekend at the house. Mycroft is never there, so we won’t be bothered.”
“And may I present my dear friend, Miss Mary Morstan?” Mrs. Stamford turned to a young woman who came forward. “I hope you become good friends as well.”
I followed Ivan to the warming room, where I sat as he banked up the steam. I began to perspire freely and could feel my muscles loosen and the tension drain from my body.
“I am not toying with you,” I said. “I know the stakes and I know the danger. I am offering you a proposal. If you vow not to kill Sherlock Holmes or have him killed, then I will come to you and stay with you. You know that I always keep my word. If I promise it and you agree, then you can have me and do with me what you will – as long as Holmes remains unharmed.”
“I was afraid of that,” I replied. And I took out my handkerchief and mopped the sweat from my fevered brow.
Usually Gladstone is taken out in the morning and again in the evening by one of Holmes’ Irregulars, a band of street urchins who always seem to be at hand. They are his eyes and ears on the streets of London, as ubiquitous as the mud and just as invisible. They are also very willing to perform any small deed in Holmes’ service, from delivering messages, to hailing cabs, to hauling coal for Mrs. Hudson’s stove. And walking Gladstone.
“Spoken like a cradle Catholic,” Holmes interjected. “Now, Charles, if I am to get to the bottom of this trouble I will need to know details. Names, dates, places – I must have all! We are here to help you out of this muddle, not to judge you.”
Why was I drawn to this infernal place? Perhaps it was my nature to seek out others of my own ilk, others who must, in their waking life, hide what they truly were.
He perused me. “Are you a priest or a vicar or something? You don’t look like you belong on this patch.”
Charles winced, but nodded. I helped him sit up straighter. “You may trust Mr. Holmes. The words you speak will not pass from this room.”
But to my dismay, he met my self-destructive fury with a surprising gentleness, even tenderness. That is when all the fight left me, for I knew something then I did not want to know – the Irishman loved me. He didn’t simply desire me or selfishly wish to possess me, he was in love with me. And that love defeated me utterly. I took to my bed, unable to eat or speak, and I could see fear in the Irishman’s eyes – fear that I would wither and die.
“I know,” I said with a shudder. “I am sorry for that. I know I can never erase that sordid picture from your mind. And I can never take back that moment of... of supreme weakness. But I am a weak man. I have ever been weak and sinful. I believe it to be my nature, although I have struggled against it. But it has been in vain. Which is why...”
Alfie looked distinctly uncomfortable. “Yes, Doctor,” he conceded. “Mr. Charles and me – well, I’ve known him all his life.” He unconsciously stroked his young master’s troubled brow. “This is a small world ’round here, sir.”
“Certainly, sir,” he said, backing off. “Mr. Lovell said you and Mr. Sherlock don’t have any servants. How do you gentlemen get along without them?”
I shook my head. When Holmes gets into one of these moods he might refuse to speak for days on end, even to me. There is nothing for it but to ignore him. I learned that lesson early on.
“I did not,” said the Irishman. “I don’t need to kill. I have others who perform such deeds – if they need performing.”
Holmes nodded. “Two months and twenty-six days, dear boy. I’d give you the exact number of hours, but I don’t want to take up any more of the Group’s valuable time.”
“Thank you, James,” I said, opening the bag. I took out a bottle of alcohol, cotton, and a roll of tape. “I think this should be sufficient.”
“This message was delivered about an hour ago.” She handed me a telegram. “It’s from Mr. Holmes’ brother and is marked as urgent!”
Holmes put his face right up next to Mick’s. “Listen to me, you foolish boy. I’m trying to save you from the gallows. But you must be honest with me. You must tell me everything!”
Holmes jumped up, gleefully rubbing his hands together. “Capital! Get dressed and we’ll go over to see it posthaste!”
I turned down onto my street from the Cromwell Road, wondering what in blazes I’d do with myself until Monday. And that’s when I saw him. Sitting on the front steps, smoking his pipe, his expression quizzical.
“He might be gone for a number of days,” I informed her. “I’m sure he will send you word if it is to be longer.”
I was not sure whether to proclaim my unease at being in the bed of such royal infamy, at being in that same bed with my intimate friend and compatriot, or at learning that he was the scion not just of a wealthy family, but of a titled one.
He stood very still, his mind alert to my words. “Have you come here to offer me Holmes? That isn’t like you at all. You are the most loyal creature on the face of this earth.”
“It can be,” he admitted. “But I am talking about the chase – using one’s intellect, one’s cunning, one’s bodily strength, all of one’s faculties to face down the most perilous of villains, whether a blackmailer, a murderer... or a roving night nurse. Wait!” He squeezed my arm.  “Hush!”
“A medical emergency,” he informed me. “There has been a summons to Campton Grange, which is the next estate over. Someone has been injured.”
I spent that first day in bed, hiding my face, refusing food. Another servant, a female this time, came and brought me water to wash and a clean nightshirt and a blue silk dressing gown. She told me to put it on.
“Shove over, Watson,” said Holmes. “It was deuced cold in that old passageway! My feet are like blocks of ice!”
Stamford frowned. “You’ve been lodging with Holmes far too long,” he said darkly. “Mark my words, you’ll turn into as much of a misanthrope as he is before long. And then it will too late! A pair of sad old bachelors, that’s what you’ll be! Get out of Baker Street, man! Didn’t you sell a few stories to the ‘Strand Magazine’? That one about the African safari was quite entertaining. Writing must bring in some extra mint.”
I did a cursory examination and then stood, anger overwhelming me. “This person should be in a hospital, not a gaol!”
I asked to be admitted to my deposit box and the bank clerk took me into the vault below. There I removed a velvet bag that contained a sapphire stickpin that had once belonged to Lord Percy, and a golden cigarette case and some other small but valuable pieces of jewelry given to me by the Irishman during our days together. I had put them there for safe-keeping before I left for India and never taken them out after my return, thinking they might one day serve me in extremity. Now that day had come. If I was to leave England, perhaps forever, I might need them. I knew little of America except that I would be utterly alone and friendless there. If I needed money, these trinkets might be turned into ready cash. Or I could begin to wear them again. My new life with the Irishman would be the kind where sapphire stickpins and golden cigarette cases were de rigueur.
“And do you have a place to stay upon release?” Her manner was friendly, but businesslike. “Or a position? We find that our successful graduates have a plan and a routine to return to – a job, a flat, supportive friends.”
“Men who prey on the weaknesses of their fellows are a sorry lot,” Holmes concurred. “Young Griffith is a mere lad, unused to the true evils of the world, and so he was ripe to be exploited. Unfortunately, Major Griffith is an obstinate ass and unlikely to give his son the kind of guidance he will need to avoid such contretemps in the future.”
I hailed a cab and directed it to an address in Hampstead, to a house I knew all too well, but had not seen the inside of in almost eight years – not since shortly before I met Sherlock Holmes.
The hansom came to a halt before 221b and we emerged. The street was silent. It was well after midnight and all law-abiding people were home in their beds.
Just as Mrs. Hudson was bringing in Elevenses, an unexpected patient came to the door. His name was Captain Phillips and he was sent to me by Stamford, whose patient he had been for the past year. But now that Stamford had removed to Chelsea with his new bride, it was too far for the old gentleman to make his accustomed weekly visit. As he lived in Montague Place, Stamford immediately thought of me here in Baker Street. While I appreciated the recommendation, I would be lying to say it did not irk me somewhat to be getting cast-off patients from a man who was once my junior assistant.
“They threatened you, John. With this.” He produced a stiletto from within the folds of his black frock coat. “They might have damaged you and I cannot allow that. They went too far. They were supposed only to frighten you, not to touch you. Your beauty is too precious to me. And so they had to be taught a lesson. A last and fatal lesson.”
But I often over-think. It is one of my most grievous faults. Outsiders who know Holmes and I only superficially think that Holmes is a brooding, peculiar, and brilliant character, while I am some slow, blustering dolt who lives solely in the shadow of my more flamboyant companion. But the truth is that I also have my own eccentricities and moods. When I first returned from India I was sunk for months in a depression I feared I would never shed. Only the reappearance of the Irishman and his offer of a renewed association shook me out of my torpor and forced me to take hold of my life and remake it.
“It’s my head,” I said. I put my hand to my forehead. There was a small gash just above my right eyebrow. “It’s nothing. A mere scratch.”
“Luck!” he ejaculated. One of the players turned to glare at him, but he stared the man down. “Luck is for those who want to lose. I never rely on luck, but on my own mind. It never fails me.”
But the main disadvantage was that I would be out of his sight for the better part of the day for weeks at a time. I would be interacting with people he had not approved, perhaps even making friendships, or at least acquaintances, with them. But it was also becoming clear that he could not keep me locked up in the Hampstead house for the remainder of my life. And we could not spend all our time traveling when he needed to be in London, conducting his business. This was a dilemma that the Irishman’s colossal brain had never imagined facing and it left him in a confusion that was unprecedented.
“And the way you see fit has caused your son to try to hang himself,” said Holmes, taking out his pipe and lighting it. “So that has worked well, hasn’t it?”
“You will not be boxing any time soon,” I insisted. “Trust me – I’m a doctor. And I am also your good friend...”
But I had not remembered. So many things had happened since I saw Stamford and made the date that it had completely flown out of my head.
“Yes,” he confirmed. “Now we must get into the house before our hunter makes another attempt.” He pulled me up the steps, retrieved his latchkey from his pocket, and opened the door, shoving me inside.
Full of regret, I bid the dear ladies adieu with the excuse that my brother expected me to begin my studies shortly. This was actually a fact, although I neglected to add that I had no intention of opening my books at Michaelmas term or any other term that season. I had not yet settled on a way of living, although my brother wanted me to take up the Law, following in his and our father’s footsteps. But I knew that pursuit was not for me. I had more of an affinity for Medicine, but I knew that study was an onerous one and was not eager to turn myself over to its heavy discipline. At least not yet.
“You may withdraw, Mr. Collins,” said Holmes. “Neither I nor the good doctor is smuggling a shovel with which Mr. Wiggins might dig his way out.”
“Let him go!” cried Holmes. I could just see his figure emerging from behind the hedge, my Colt revolver gripped in his extended right hand, taking aim. “For the love of God, Moriarty!”
“I don’t know,” said Charles, squirming. “She called him her brother, although they look nothing alike. Dilly is fair as the sun, while her brother is dark.”
“It’s best not to ask too many questions,” I warned, thinking it was useless to believe that anything could be kept from a sharp servant. “We wouldn’t want to hinder Mr. Holmes’ investigation.”
“Delightful woman,” said Holmes as we roared off, the cab attempting to follow. “The hours must fly by with her in the room.”
A small crowd had gathered to watch the show, of which Henry was more than aware. He carefully adjusted his clothing as if he had been soiled by a leper’s touch and then spoke loudly: “I will not apologize. There is no need. I no longer recognize this creature as my kin. I bid you good-evening.” And he stalked off without a glance backward.
“Amazing muscle control,” Holmes observed as the man thrust into the lad, every motion explicitly visible to the rapt audience. “That takes a fair amount of practice.”
“One moment, please!” I answered. “At least put the covers over your head, Holmes. For my peace of mind.”
Hearing Holmes speak of the Irregulars made me think of Mick Wiggins. I did not want to be reminded once again of that quizzical young fellow, but he always seemed to be intruding upon my thoughts.
The boy brought the glasses and then sat down next to Wilde, grinning broadly. Although he was a very common lad, Oscar treated him as if he were a young lord, petting and fussing over him.
“Of course you do, Charles,” Holmes asserted. “Now that your mother has retired and your father is nowhere in sight, you will tell me all.”
No, more than merely fascinating -- I was powerfully attracted to him. More powerfully than I had been to anyone in years. And that terrified me. The last thing I needed was to attach myself emotionally and physically to a man -- an addict -- even more damaged than myself.
I swallowed a lump in my throat. He was so near – the man who had injured Holmes. The man who had raped him, humiliated him. The man who wished to kill him. The man I must sleep with and be loyal to from now on.
But I was adamant. “They did not kill Fisher. You know it, I know it, and Holmes knows it. Let them go free.”
“Oh, Doctor!” she cried, clasping my hand in her dainty one. “I am so relieved to see you looking so fit! Dr. Stamford told me you had been injured – shot! – in some confrontation with a desperate criminal! I have been so distressed you cannot imagine!”
“Don’t worry yourself about that, my dear.” I took the creature’s small hand in mine. His skin was clammy, but he also had a feverish aspect. “We will get you out of here as soon as we can.”
The Irishman gave the coachman the order and he turned. A few minutes later we stopped before the old building. It was very late and the street was dark and still.
“I know,” Holmes said. “It is amazing. And in that time I have neither murdered anyone nor been murdered myself, which proves the supreme power of my self-control.”
James puffed up with pride. “You should taste her faggots and pudding! Better than all that Frenchy stuff!”
“Idiots!” The Irishman leapt from the carriage. “Fix it! The boat is waiting at Rye. I want to be in France tonight!”
“Holmes... I....” I set down my paper. “If you would put aside these drugs, perhaps visit your brother’s estate in the country. Or even take a trip. To Italy. Or Germany.”
“Of course not!” Holmes spat. “Lestrade is a fool. Did you see the wound on the fellow? His throat was slit from the front, which must have sprayed arterial blood to Kingdom Come, yet Wiggins had only a trace on his hands and Dilly none at all. I suspect they walked in shortly after the real murderers left and Mick touched the body briefly to see if Fisher was still alive. It looks as if the pair were set up, Watson. Someone knew they were going to see Fisher and tipped off Lestrade, who arrived just in time to arrest them. He’s a blind idiot not to see the obvious!”
“Don’t be absurd.” Holmes made a face full of distaste. “That would be a disgraceful display of emotional excess.”
“Capital!” Stamford clapped me on the back. “You won’t regret it, old chap. Friday, then. We will dine at eight o’clock. Don’t fail me this time.”
“I know it’s one of your favorites.” Holmes’ hand was on my shoulder. “The beefsteak is first rate. Good British food and none of that Frenchy stuff, right?”
Holmes’ words were invading my foggy ears, but the meaning made no sense to me. Know all? That was impossible!
What I did not know at the time was that my brother was also leading a life full of chaos. His work as a solicitor bored him and he was delving into the speculative business practices that would eventually reduce him to bankruptcy. He was also drinking, albeit secretly, well on his way to becoming a drunkard. But this was in the future and I could not recognize the signs that were plainly before my eyes. But we never recognize the signs, do we? Not until it is too late.
“That may be out of our hands,” I told him. I could not imagine that Charles Griffith’s little paramour was not a guilty party in this sordid business, but it would be a sad lesson for the lad to learn at so tender an age.
But the reckoning always comes. For me it came after a little over a year of cheerful debauchery. I was 18 years old, arrogant, pleasure-loving, and footloose. I was making love regularly to two beautiful women, a French countess-in-exile who was the mistress of a duke, and the wife of a Member of Parliament with a house off Grosvenor Place and an estate in Hertfordshire. I was living rent-free at my brother’s house in Kensington and spending every shilling of my allowance on my wardrobe. For food and drink, I depended on invitations, and I had many. A beautiful face and an ingratiating smile took me far and my mirror told me that I might expect to parlay these gifts of nature into marriage to a wealthy widow or even the daughter of a peer. Then I would be set for life.
“No, my dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes. “I am a detective. A consulting detective to be precise. And the best in the world, if I may be so egotistical to say so. I have solved cases for everyone from the inspectors at New Scotland Yard to our own Royal Family, from His Holiness the Pope to a high official in the Kremlin, as well as a number of billionaire industrialists and Hollywood film stars.”
“You must come to dinner this Friday,” Stamford pressed. “To make up for our missed engagement. Jane is very eager that you meet her friend, Miss Morstan. She’s a very pretty young woman, Watson, and extremely agreeable.”
“Very well.” I set the teacup on the tray and lay back down. Holmes nestled deeply into the bed, grunting in a way that reminded me of Gladstone. I closed my eyes, praying that the dream would not return.
“Stay away from Sherlock,” he continued. “I know he’s your roommate, but there are others here who have a positive outlook. Spend some time with George. He’s a good counselor and he’ll steer you right.”
“You’re a rare card, sir!” Thommie laughed. “Not here! I know a place we can go. Nice rooms suitable for gentlemen. And they offer champagne for an extra charge.”
As a boy I never understood it. But as I grew older I came to believe that my resemblance to my mother, whose loss they could never reconcile, made my very existence painful to them. Seeing me so alive and with such high spirits always put my father in a black mood. And my brother, a decade older and constantly away at school, was a shadowy attendant at holidays and other special occasions. I barely remember him speaking more than a few sentences to me before I, too, was sent away to school at the age of ten.
But he didn’t kiss me. He held me close to him. I could feel his member harden in his trousers as it pressed against me. His cold grey eyes were now hot and blazing with lust.
I turned to look at him. “I thought numbers were your stock in trade? The great Professor of Mathematics! Do you even know what year it is? Or what day? What keeps you alive – besides hate?”
“No,” he asserted. “I must say it. That is the only way it is real. I love you, John. And I have never said those words to another human being, or felt that emotion for another human being. Only you.”
“I can speak,” he said. The rasp had faded, but his voice was still weak. “But I have nothing to say to you.”
“I did not,” I breathed. “How could I? I didn’t know where we were going. I left him in the dark, without a word.”
“I was worried about you, sir,” he said. “And about Mr. Sherlock, too. He hasn’t come home for two nights.”
Quickly – that was the way to do it. It was the only way – I could not shoot myself otherwise, I was too fainthearted. But once Holmes was dead, killing myself would be easy, for I would not wish to live another moment longer.
I lay in my bed that night and turned the question over and over in my aching head. But all I could return to was the pervasiveness of the Irishman in my history – and that he was still a force who might yet prevail.
The butler frowned. “Christmastide. He remained through the New Year and then returned to his pied-à-terre in London.”
Holmes paused, a forkful of kippers in almost to his mouth. “Send him up, James. It must be momentous if the good inspector is up so early and sending out messages.”
I don’t speak of it to many people, even my intimates, but I was born and raised in the Roman Catholic faith. Catholics are not acceptable to most people in England. Although my family was as British as any in the Queen’s Empire, we were looked down on, as other Catholics are looked down on still. The hint of Popery is foreign, even tainted, to the stout Anglo-Saxon sensibility. I was educated from childhood by the Jesuits, another suspect foreign order, but they taught me well, I believe. They taught me to reason and to value knowledge. And they taught me control: control of the mind and control of the body.
“Not technically true, but close enough,” Holmes returned. “Now get yourself upstairs. We have unfinished business that won’t wait another moment.”
“Yes,” said Holmes, lost in his remembrance. “He was an expert on crime and criminals and he sparked an interest in me as well. He subscribed to the ‘Police Gazette’ and we read it avidly. He also ordered legal histories and accounts of old cases and we studied them together, conjecturing. How had the crime been committed? How had the criminal been apprehended? And where had he gone wrong? The only thing we did not linger on was the punishment. My tutor did not like to discuss punishment. But I learned much during that time – things that started me on what was to become my career – the detecting of crime.”
“Is he out hunting for the man that took a potshot at you the other night?” James asked. “Does Mr. Holmes think he’s connected to the fellow who was blackmailing Mr. Charles?”
Holmes rolled his eyes. “Gladstone is as spoiled as ever and that scrawny alley cat is scrawny no longer. Wiggins will never be able to reclaim his pet. Mrs. Hudson and the girls have grown too attached to it.”
He stepped back and straightened his clothes. “Perhaps. But if this be madness, yet there is method in it, as the poet said. Adieu – for now.”
“The fellow betrayed you,” said Holmes, his eyes glittering. “You are too young to understand the evil in this world, Charles. It often comes in the guise of love, isn’t that so, Watson?”
“Gladstone enjoys attention of any kind, but especially from the fair sex. And he is quite a glutton, I fear.”
“I believe Henry had help in his downfall,” I said. “Tell me the truth – did you orchestrate his failure? Did you drive my brother to his early death?”
His foggy words brought me little comfort. I was sick in body and in my soul and only wanted the world to end that night. And it did – but not in the way I understood an ending.
As this little exchange between Holmes and Major Griffith was playing out, my patient was becoming increasingly agitated. He tried to sit up and speak, but he was obviously in great distress. The valet, Barton, endeavoured to soothe him, but to no avail.
“Calm yourself, madam,” I urged. “The lad will be fine. Tall trees and young boys have an affinity that will not be denied. This won’t be the last injury he will take in his life. That is the nature of the male animal – to take chances and climb when there is something to be climbed. I only suggest that you bid him to be cautious.” I turned to the boy, who was sitting in James’ strong lap. “Do you hear me, young man? Will you be careful in the future?”
“Over a week.” He dipped the cloth into a bowl of water, wrung it out, and placed it back on my forehead. “They brought you here, to Sherringford Hall. Are you in much pain?”
I let Wiggins pay for the pints – a point of pride to him – but I stood him the second round and also one for his friend. While we drank the young man chattered on about this and that, mostly theatrical gossip, but his talk was also peppered with praise of Sherlock Holmes.
And, in fact, I was being honest, being truthful, when I begged off Stamford’s party. Holmes was ill. Acutely ill. Gravely ill.
“You frightened me, Watson,” said Holmes, his voice low and almost caressing. “Your face – I cannot describe it except to say you looked haunted. If you wish to confide in me, I promise that any confidences will be kept to the very grave.”
He sighed. “I will see what I can do. But it’s bad business to turn good servants over to Scotland Yard, especially when they have simply followed orders.”
“I don’t think either of them have the patience for family life.” We paused before 221b. “Why don’t you take the rest of the day off, James? It’s a beautiful day and you should enjoy it while you are young and able.”
“When you get to New York call upon this gentleman at ‘The New York World,’” said Holmes, giving Mick a sealed envelope with an address written in his distinctive hand. “He’s an editor at that newspaper and he knows of my work. I’ve written to inform him of your arrival. He should be able to direct you both to some gainful employment.”
But I shook him off. I am not an old man, no matter how I might look to a mere stripling like James. I’m not even near to 40 – still six years younger than Holmes, who leaps and prowls like an alley cat, not to mention trading blows with the bare-fisted ruffians in places like Alison’s and the Box.
“But no longer,” he said. “Because I am not afraid now. Not afraid to admit what I’ve never been able to acknowledge before. That I...” He stopped, as if the words would not form on his lips.
“I did!” the valet piped up. “I was attending the major when I heard a loud crash. I ran in here and... and saw him in a heap on the floor.” Barton winced. “I called out and the major came running.” He pointed to the ceiling. One arm of a gas fixture was bent. “I think he was only up there for a few moments, sir, but I thought he was stone dead!”
Now Holmes’ face was all concern. “Of course, my dearest fellow. Come then.” He took my hand and led me from the gallery and out onto the pavement.
“No,” said the Irishman. “You are a man. The beautiful boy that once was has been destroyed. Beaten down and trampled in the mire! And whose fault is that? Whose, my lad?”
So Sherlock Holmes was not only making use of these children of the streets for his crime-solving intelligence, but he was assisting them as well. He once told me that Wiggins was as bright a boy as any attending the finest public school in the land, Eton or Harrow or any of those. He only lacked the advantages of family and money that those boys had to make good in the world.
I must say that I got quite a workout that night, which was what I had been seeking. But it was all so emotionless, so mechanical, that afterwards I felt even more empty than I had before.
I was at a loss for any of those. “I have my Army pension. I was on disability and before that in convalescent hospital. My few belongings are in storage. I suppose I’ll look for digs in the city... somewhere. And then try for a job. Perhaps the Army can advise me on something.”
“I’m your counselor,” he’d told me, as if this were a summer camp for extremely damaged, over-grown children... which I suppose it was. The whole place had the makeshift atmosphere of camp. But I was used to camps. Much, much worse camps, in much, much worse places than North London, in a nondescript street just off the Bakerloo Line.
“I want you to do to me what I saw you do to that boy in Cleveland Street,” he said. “I want you to make love to me, John. To kiss me. To possess me. To fuck me. Because if you do not, then I don’t believe I can continue to exist.”
“Please, sir! Let me practice on you!” James begged. “I keep hoping His Lordship – I mean, Mr. Mycroft – will take me to London and let me valet for him. I do for him whenever he’s here, but that’s almost never! I know if he took me to London I’d serve him right proudly.” James shook his head in frustration. “Anything to get out of this blasted old house! Will you please allow me, sir?”
When the nurses awoke us the next morning, Holmes was safely in his own bed and I began to believe it had all been a dream – until Holmes gave me a wink as we marched out to breakfast.
Holmes sighed and unbuttoned his fly, pissing on a rock at the side of the road. I looked away, but did the same. It was still hours away from Chichester and who knew when we would next be offered relief?
After one more round of handshakes and embraces the pair scampered up the ramp, off on their adventure.
In my mad state, I pressed the Irishman to be rough with me in bed, lashing out at him in an effort to goad his passion into violence. For I knew he was a violent man, capable of killing me with his bare hands if that was his wish. And since I was too much the coward to kill myself, I wanted him to kill me instead. It seemed the only solution.
“There is no need to apologize, my dear fellow,” said Wilde. “I must allow that you were a paragon of male beauty of the purest kind so admired by the Dorian Greeks – blond and stalwart and sensual, an inspiration for the ages. That is no shame, John. And that beauty has been forever preserved in rare works of Art, which are always to be preferred to mere reality.”
“A good decision, Mr. Wiggins,” Holmes said. “But that’s not the kind of proposition I meant. I have in my pocket a ticket for the Irish Princess. She is a steamship that leaves from the port of Liverpool in a week’s time, bound for New York City. I propose that you take that ship and seek your fortune in the New World. I have some connections in New York and will write you a letter of introduction to help you gain employment. I will also see that an account is opened for you with a decent amount of currency that you may draw upon until you have settled into your new life. I think America is truly a place where you might make a fresh start and leave your old life behind. What do you say to this, Michael Wiggins?”
When Lovell had cleared the last dishes away and decanted the Madeira, Holmes pulled out his pipe and began to puff thoughtfully. I felt it was now time to pose the questions that had been plaguing me.
But I cut off his dissertation. “Yes, I am familiar with those portraits. And yes – I am the person portrayed in them.” I picked up my glass of sherry and bolted it. “I posed for them a very long time ago.”
My stomach turned queasily. “If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go to the library. Are there any newspapers, Mr. Lovell?”
It was like at Maiwand. The noise and confusion. The pain and the blood, mine and that of so many others. Trying to stay awake. Stay alive.
That was the trouble. My entire existence was wrapped around Sherlock Holmes. I had little to occupy myself outside his compelling sphere. My meagre medical practice did not come close to interesting me in the way Holmes did. It did not rule my life, waking and sleeping, the way Holmes did. I was merely an appendage of Sherlock Holmes. An instrument. A shadow.
“Yes,” she replied. “I don’t know why you have agreed to this arrangement and I don’t want to know, but it is not too late to escape. You are a mere child, John. You have your whole life ahead of you. Do not waste it... this way.”
“When I was a lad of about fourteen,” he began. “I was living at Sherringford, of course, and being schooled by tutors. My parents were on their travels and Mycroft was at Cambridge, at Trinity, where he proved himself a prodigy, which was no surprise to anyone who knew him. But I was not far behind as a child wonder. But my mind was of a different sort than Mycroft’s. My mind was active and questing, while his has always been passive. He let information come to him and then he dealt with it as an intellectual exercise, as he does now for Her Majesty’s government. But I was ever a seeker, wandering the downs of Sussex, exploring, asking questions, gathering data and specimens. The world seemed full of marvels and I wished to know everything! Science, Art, Music, Philosophy – I breathed in knowledge as if it were air.”
I attempted to contain my outrage, but it was impossible. “This is intolerable! This boy should be in a hospital! Do you think he will run away? He can barely stand!”
“Take your cane,” came a voice from the sofa. “And if you think that beast can run you are even more deluded than our friend Lestrade.”
“Stay away from your former occupation,” Holmes warned. “This is the chance at a new beginning, so don’t fall back on the easy shilling, my boy.”
“I also have been pondering this dismal affair,” said Holmes. “Tomorrow I wish to question him further. I only fear his father will hinder me. The major and I did not part on the best of terms.”
Holmes cocked his head. “Wiggins has not been in my employ for an age, dear boy. I know these street urchins all look alike to a gentlemen, but surely you’ve noticed that Mr. Wiggins no longer comes to the house.”
“You’ll pay for that, John,” he said darkly. “You will both pay for that betrayal. I swear it! Now ready yourself. The carriage is waiting to take us away.”
My heart broke right there. I could feel it crack and crumble within me. He knew. Had known all these years. Known and never breathed a single word, but pretended he knew nothing of my life, my past.
“Don’t think I know him,” said the man, taking in our evening clothes. “But we welcome gentlemen, long as they behave themselves, know what I mean?” And then he guffawed.
We dodged down an alleyway off Baker Street and into a secure garage where Holmes parked the Jag. The cab was waiting in front of the building. Holmes and I and the cabbie, tempted by a handful of ten pound notes, carried up my things.
He picked up his fork and attacked the salade verde. The watercress and leeks gave up without a fight. The rest of the meal proceeded without incident and a most delicious dessert was forthcoming for both of us.
Then I can move my consulting rooms to a place more conducive to a medical practice. Harley Street would be ideal, but even Wimpole Street would suffice. And, one day, perhaps an intimate practice in a place like Highgate or Hampstead. A place where I might have a house of my own. A wife. A family...
“Stamford invited me.” I settled into the chair opposite the sofa and opened the paper, pretending to read.
“I’d be happy to oblige, missus.” He eagerly picked up the empty tray, as well as his sack, and followed her out of the room.
“I don’t have a valet,” I insisted. “And I don’t need one to dress. I haven’t needed one yet and I won’t in the future, although how a lord like you has done without one all these years is a true mystery.”
“Oh, pish tosh!” she retorted. “Better I say them than you let that poxy Lord Brigham do them to you! Are you such a naïf, my dear, that you don’t know what they want a beautiful boy like you for?”
“Like Oscar, I think they are beautiful.” Ross fingered the sleeve of my coat. “But not as attractive as the man who inspired them. Unlike Oscar, I am partial to reality and not fantasy. He searches for the perfect artifact, but I am content to find a congenial companion – even if only for a night.”
“I never thought Zeus was particularly known for his intellect,” I pointed out. “His virility, yes, but not intellect.”
At that point Moggy, who had ceased her wails somewhere between Oxford Street and Lower Baker Street, began caterwauling once again.
But my cheeks burned with shame when I remembered that once I had been much like them. Those were days I now preferred to forget. As if I ever could.
I hadn’t thought much beyond finding the cat. “I will fulfill my promise to Wiggins to look after her. The animal is obviously important to him.”
I began to sweat, and not from our previous exertions. “Is that where you place me? Among thieves and murderers?”
“You’ve mentioned this house before,” I gulped, closing my eyes and crossing myself. “Could you slow down a tad?”
“I think you do,” said James, standing up purposefully. “Begging your pardons, sirs, but this place is a sight. It needs a good dusting and this carpet hasn’t been swept in an age. Look at all the ashes here! And your grate needs cleaning. And your boots polishing. And your cravat is all askew, Doctor. Here – let me.”
“I don’t know how to play Commerce,” I said, turning around. I was met with a long, thin face and a pair of cold, piercing grey eyes under a shining cap of black hair. “We weren’t permitted card games at my school.”
“Not to be a nosy parker, Doctor, but... you were out all night. Does that have to do with why you’re going away?”
“Oh,” said Holmes. “That’s rather a sticky one. Seems I had better call for a taxi after all. We can put your things in the cab and you can ride to the flat with me. Voila! Problem solved!”
“Believe what you will.” Holmes opened the door of the room. “It’s getting late. Take the box with your new pet and let us leave this oppressive place.”
“Blast the situation!” Major Griffith’s face was red with anger. “This is none of your affair! I will handle my own son in the way I see fit!”
“I don’t know, Doctor. Mr. Sherlock suddenly took against his tutor. They must have had a falling out over some little thing or other. You know how boys are – they take things to heart. Mr. Sherlock refused to study mathematics anymore. He told the old Earl that if he couldn’t be the best, then he’d rather be nothing. That put the Earl into a fury! Then the lad said he wouldn’t be in the same house with his tutor and demanded he be sent away. The poor man needed the money, I think, which was why he was teaching the boy in the first place. Scholars are not rich gentlemen as rule, are they, Doctor?”
“Thank God!” Holmes slipped into his chair, sulking. “That lad is a pest. I haven’t had time to find him a proper job and at this rate he’ll be here until Doomsday!”
I shuddered at the word ‘grave.’ All I could think on was the Irishman telling me that Holmes was only alive because he did not wish to kill him – yet.
“Never fear, Wiggins,” Holmes declared. “There’s not a door in London I can’t open – if I wish to.” He smiled slyly at Collins. “Including any door in this gaol.”
I filled my small trunk and valise with clothes and a few mementos, but carried the box with my papers into Holmes’ room. They were his cases, I had merely set down the particulars. Now they were truly his. I vowed never again to put pen to paper. Mr. Wilde would have to take up the slack in tales of suspense and adventure, for John H. Watson would be seen no more in the pages of ‘The Strand.’
Alfie Barton shook his head sadly. “Now you see why the young master wanted to off himself! The guilt of it was tearing him apart, but when his father found out the truth it was more than he could bear! I blame myself, Doctor! I should’ve seen it coming! I should’ve watched him like a hawk!”
“Don’t question,” it would read. “And don’t try to follow. Trust me that I need to go away for my own peace of mind. It is better thus. Farewell, my friend.”
It never occurred to me to protest. This was the life I knew and I was proud to have been selected. My teachers drummed it into me that their order were the Soldiers of Christ, beholden to no one but the Holy Father in Rome, the elite of the Mother Church. I must toughen myself and prepare myself like a soldier, both mind and body. And that is what I did.
He looked away, unable to meet my eyes. “Freedom is an overrated commodity. But if you must have it, then use it wisely. Adieu, Johnny Lad.”
“I’m looking forward to taking my leisure,” said Holmes, taking out his damned pipe once more and lighting it. “There’s nothing like the country to stimulate thought and encourage relaxation, isn’t that true, my boy?”
“He’s still alive,” the Irishman stated sourly. “The air-gun should have done the trick, but Moran is too hot-headed these days to shoot straight. And then that idiot with the knife! Now Holmes has gone to earth, like a fox. But he will emerge... one day. I have patience. He does not.”
“And what school was that?” asked the man. He was tall and exceedingly lean, in his mid-30’s or thereabouts, lounging against the doorframe and smoking a long French cigarette.
“Friend not here now,” said Ivan. “You want that Ivan should give relief? Only 3 bob extra for good customer.”
“Whatever! Now shut up and lie still!” I ordered. Then I glared at Holmes’ brother. “And I need that water now, if you please.”
Perhaps that’s why I didn’t notice him at first. My mind was preoccupied. The street and pavement were crowded, as they always are in midday in that part of London, especially on a brisk April day when the sun was still attempting to breach the morning fog.
“I’ve come to seek my fortune in London.” He pointed to a small cloth sack at his feet. “I’ve got all my gear and a little money saved up. I walked most of the way, but then a gentleman gave me a ride in his trap into the city and, after asking a few kindly souls, I found my way right to your door. London isn’t half a confusing place. And all the people! It makes my brain spin!”
Holmes took out the ticket and put it into Mick’s hand. “This is how serious I am. You may use the ticket or cash it in – it is your choice.”
“They won’t,” Holmes assured me. “And if they do...” He sniffed dismissively. “I’ll take all the blame, no need for you to fret. I can’t get into any more trouble here.” His arm curled underneath my neck in a possessive gesture. “If you want me to go back to my own bed...”
“If you are done with your gallantries, Watson,” said Holmes impatiently. “You might take a look at the subject at hand.”
“I thought you were a Confederate?” I said. “I didn’t know they acknowledged the legitimacy of their conquerors. You see, sir, I may have been locked away in a strict Jesuit school, but I was allowed to read ‘The Times’ and other newspapers. I am not completely ignorant of the world – even if I am merely an impertinent boy!”
I had been visiting Regent Street to pick up a pocket-watch that I had left at Carson’s to be repaired – the winding stem had become loose. After retrieving the timepiece, I thought I might while away an hour at the Criterion Bar; perhaps I would meet Stamford there – it is his favorite place of refreshment – and have the opportunity to apologize in person for bowing out of his dinner party of the previous week. I am not in the habit of accepting dinner engagements and then reneging upon them. That would be the height of poor manners and incivility. Unfortunately, my intimate friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, with whom I share a suite of rooms in Baker Street, was quite ill that evening.
“Don’t know how you manage with Holmes,” Stamford remarked. “He’s certainly a queer duck. I don’t think I could live with him as long as you have.”
“Oh, thank you!” She took out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes. “You are so kind, Doctor.”
“I was living in London,” he began. “I was supposed to be studying, but I was not. I had no desire to return to university. The dons are dullards. They have no finer feelings at all. No poetry in their blood, no fire in their souls! And they do not understand love.”
I left the prison shrouded in a cloud. Rather than take a hansom home, I walked, thinking to diffuse my black mood. I walked down Fleet Street, past the newspaper offices, then past Chancery Lane and the Temple. I had not walked in this part of London for many a year and it brought to mind my early days as a medical student, when I had cheap lodgings just off the Kingsway, before I moved to Aldersgate to be close to St. Bart’s. Those were heady days – I had felt freedom for the first time in a long, long while – when I had gladly buried myself in my studies.
In Group I hardly spoke. I didn’t know what to say. And I didn’t know whose side to be on. There were things I wanted to share -- I had no one else to talk to about my fear of the future, no one else who might understand but others who were in the same position as I. Yet, if I joined in the discourse of Group, I knew Holmes would see it as a betrayal.
“And what was that?” she inquired. “Is it about that cat? Because she’s been no trouble, but I wonder how much longer we must keep her here.”
I winced. That’s always been my curse -- my looks. In medical school and then during my hospital training it was difficult for the professors and resident doctors to take me seriously. Later, in the Army, I struggled to make myself a figure of authority. I even grew a moustache in an effort to appear older. “Youth isn’t always a blessing.”
I didn’t expect a response. In fact, I was amazed his eyes were yet open. For on the small side table next to the sofa lay his morocco case. Inside were his syringe and needles.
“Ah!” Holmes laughed. “Good old Watson! I knew I could count on you. Always at the ready whenever the bugle calls. Come, my dear boy – the game is afoot!”
“Mrs. Hudson,” I began, not knowing how to tell her what needed to be said. But the direct approach seemed best. “Remember what we were speaking about not long ago?”
I enjoyed myself in Amsterdam. I found the ladies of easy virtue agreeable and they seemed to like me. But all ladies seemed to like me. My mirror told me I was handsome, even girlishly pretty, blond and blue-eyed like my mother. But I was also strong of body, hardened by my years with the Jesuits. I could get by on small rations, my feet were nimble, and my hands quick with a sword. I was also a dead-eye shot. I thought of the Army, obviously, but before I turned myself over to another authoritative institution, I wanted to taste a little of the world as a free man. With my few possessions in a small pack, I set off across Europe to see what I could see.
“That he is,” said Stamford. “He likes to chat about his pains, but he’s healthy as a horse for a man his age.”
The journey to Hampstead was not long. The house loomed dark and menacing. It seemed uninhabited, but I knew it was not. At least not yet.
The Irishman snorted. “Then you are both fools! Do you fear the approbation of the world so much, my lad? You were never so timid before.”
“Such a pretty face,” said the larger man, a fellow with dead eyes and a slim stiletto that he pressed lightly against my ashen cheek. “Be a bloomin’ shame to see such beauty all bloodied and scarred, wouldn’t it, Fred?”
I snorted at that characterization. “From what I hear of the Earl, he should have been the last person to upbraid anyone for their bad behavior!”
Gladstone immediately woofed and waddled over, emitting the fetid odour for which his breed is infamous. He’s becoming ridiculously fat, which is fatal for a bulldog. He lives on a diet of scones, toast crusts, leftover meatpies, and whatever garbage Holmes drops on the floor when he remembers to eat. And the scraps of mutton and bacon Mrs. Hudson saves for him. This is a terrible diet for a man let alone a beast.
“I told you he hates to lose,” said Mycroft as the monkey clambered up the draperies, hooting and shaking his hairy fist.
He smiled at me, preening. And I shuddered to find how easily I fell back into the old routine of flattery, using sweet words to get my way. But the difference was that then I was a callow and beautiful boy, while now I was a grown man, a doctor and a soldier. Or I had been, because that would all be ending. Anything I was before, I would no longer be. I would be only the Irishman’s catamite. At least for as long as I pleased him. And after that – I would undoubtedly be dead.
“A pretty thing, isn’t it?” The voice purred in my ear. “A lovely female, but not so fetching as her darling son. Isn’t that so, Johnny Lad?”
“I am Mr. Sherringford and this is my intimate friend, Mr. Baker. We were recommended this place by our friend, Mr. Griffith.”
“Hardly!” he laughed. “James, my lad, why don’t you see if Mrs. Jenkins might send up some beef broth for the doctor. And tea, as well. For both of us.”
“Quite,” said Holmes. “You know what our illustrious Henry the Fifth said – at least as the Bard portrayed it...”
“Who, indeed?” Holmes sighed. “But that doesn’t explain why you began prostituting yourself as well.”
Each night after Holmes had returned to his bed and begun to snore, I turned over in my mind every possible scenario for my future. None of those futures featured my new friend and lover. I resigned myself to the understanding that this clandestine relationship was doomed to be sweet and short-lived. In all likelihood we would never even see each other after my release. And if we did the circumstances of our coming together could never be recaptured in the ordinary world, far from the hothouse atmosphere of rehab.
Mick writhed like a fish on a hook. “Yeah, he was one. The last one. Dilly said they was in love. Said they was going off together to America and live like husband and wife. I told Dilly she was bloody balmy! No toff is gonna take some Mary Ann across the ocean, especially when she’s sickly, like.”
“On the sofa in my parlour,” she replied. “I can’t have him up in the attic where the girls sleep. They’d be up to all sorts of mischief, as you can imagine. That fellow is far too good-looking for safety.”
“I cannot,” I whispered, knowing my wishes were not a surprise to him. “Please let me stay and continue my studies. I can’t live this way any longer. It will be the death of my soul.”
He looked older. Much older. With a waxed mustache and a pince-nez he looked a genial scholar, but his grey eyes still blazed with a malevolent light.
“So, Wiggins,” said Holmes. “You are telling me that you and Dilly only turned to blackmail because of the extremity of her illness?”
The young man in the bed shut his eyes and turned his face away, a single tear coursing down his handsome face.
“Very well,” said Holmes. “There’s nothing further we can do here since your draft horses have trampled the crime scene so badly it might as well be a public thoroughfare.”
We sat down and waited. After a short while a young man entered from a side door. He was tall, fair, and quite handsomely built, like a guardsman. He reminded me slightly of James. He stood by the divan and then began to take off his clothes. When he was completely nude he assumed a number of strongman poses, turning and flexing his muscles, which were impressive. I had witnessed a strongman show once at a fair in Surrey, but the man posing had been covered by a loincloth. This young fellow’s show was not at all hindered by his lack of garments. In fact, he seized his manhood and began to manipulate it with great gusto. The gentlemen in the audience leaned forward in anticipation.
He sat up straight, his eyes glittering with triumph. “Of course you may, my dear fellow. It’s a wonderful flat, actually. Centrally located. It’s in a block my brother owns. There is a building society on the ground floor, then offices, then some flats above. Ours is on the top, almost like a penthouse. It’s very private.”
“I’m going to work for you two gentlemen,” James stated with assurance. “It’s not proper that two fine gentleman like yourselves should have no valet to do for them. I’m going to remedy that lack.”
The room was shabby, but tidy. A tiny window overlooked a patch of yard behind the building. He had some pictures ripped out of the newspapers tacked up on the wall over his narrow bed: an elegant woman in an evening gown, a pugilist with fists raised, a racehorse, and other trifles. His extra clothes were neatly folded and stored on a shelf alongside a flat cap and a battered straw boater. He even had a small rag rug on the floor, on which he had set a pair of red carpet slippers. I had to admit that Young Wiggins was much more orderly in his personal surroundings than Holmes himself.
“They’re gone. To their New World.” Holmes tipped his hat in acknowledgment. “May they make the most of it.”
“Thank you, Doctor!” Wiggins bent and kissed my hand. “You’re too kind. And you, too, Guv. I know you won’t let me and Dilly down!”
I examined Holmes’ hand. A barely distinct line of red was visible on his middle finger. “A mere scratch.”
I will not describe the dreams I had, except to say that they revisited my deepest, darkest fears. The disturbing events of the previous night were nothing compared to the terrors that met me in the land of sleep.
“Yes, I understand. We will sort it all out and find him a position in a suitable household. Mr. Mycroft might know of one. After all, James was working in his house.”
“Never fear, dear lady,” I said, taking her delicate hand. “I will see to his recovery personally. Soon your boy will be as good as new.”
I shut the door and bolted it. Although Holmes asserted that Mycroft would not return, I was determined not to chance any interruption. If this was to be the night – the only night! – when we would make love, then I did not want anything to spoil it.
“Don’t forget, Doctor,” said Mick, tugging at my sleeve. “My cat, Moggy. You promised you’d look after her.”
“I knew you were mine, Johnny Lad,” he whispered. “Body and soul. I’ll never let you go. Never. Never. Never...”
“I think Miss Morstan has taken a fancy to you, old man!” he leered, digging me in the ribs. “She’s a corker, is she not? And you always liked blondes, as I remember.”
“You should be here of a Friday or Saturday night, sir,” Hammond said. “It can be lively. But I find most gentlemen like a quiet house. There’s no discord here, gentlemen. Never any discord at all. Thommie’ll tell you.”
“Kings and queens are mere figureheads these days, Johnny Lad,” he said dismissively. “The true power of the material world lies in the hands of men whose names will never be known, whose faces will never be seen. Such men do not seek notoriety. They eschew mere fame. They gain power and wealth by their very invisibility.”
Mrs. Hudson crossed her arms over her ample bosom. “Have you ever heard ‘fight like cats and dogs,’ Doctor? Because it isn’t just a saying, you know.”
“Quite.” I held on for dear life as we rocketed through London. Holmes was without a doubt the worst driver I’d ever known.
“Perhaps this is not the right time.” He turned his face away. “I feared it would not be the right time. But it never seems to be the right time. So often in the past I have wanted to... but then something always interfered. Something always stood in the way. Most often it was my own misgivings, or my own stubborn-headed pride, or... or something in your look that stopped me, as it has almost stopped me now. And then I could not. I dared not.”
“I say, Watson,” I heard Holmes remark to my back. “Pray forgive me. It has been a long and tiring day.”
I was beginning to get deucedly uncomfortable. “I thought they... they liked me! Mr. Spencer knows everything about Roman history and we speak Latin together. He took me to the Vatican and we heard Mass! And Lord Brigham wants to take me to Naples to see the ruins of Pompeii and gaze upon Mount Vesuvius, and then explore the Villa of Tiberius on Capri. That is why I came to Italy, to learn and see all that I can see!”
“Yes, yes,” he said as we moved briskly down the pavement. “I want you to come with me to the gaol. They won’t let me see either Wiggins or Dilly Mitchell, but they will let in a doctor.”
The Sherringford Folly is famous in Sussex. From it you can supposedly see France. On a clear day. If you are a bird perched on the top of it.
“I knew them two would come to no good,” the man snorted. “On the game, the both o’ them! I’m the landlord ’ere. You a copper?”
He lit the cigarette and drew in the smoke, a look of bliss on his quizzical face. “Ah! Better than food. Better than a holiday in the South of France. Almost better than...” He glanced at me. “No, nothing is better than sex. Or good sex. Or a hit of heroin. But both are forbidden in here, so I must make due with my smoke. They allow me four cigarettes a day. I have to appeal to the matron for them every morning.”
“Emergency? What kind of emergency? A consulting detective emergency?” I huffed. “If I were safely installed in the Earl’s room then you wouldn’t be unable to creep through the secret passageway and make your way into my bed! Then I could get an uninterrupted night’s sleep!”
“I will endeavour to entertain you, my dear lady,” I replied, bowing. “Seeing as I am a confirmed bachelor who must sing for my supper.”
The young man’s face fell. “I’m a good servant, Doctor, even if I’m just learning. Please don’t turn me away! Mr. Holmes – I appeal to you! Don’t send me back to Sherringford! If I have to stay there, I won’t be able to stand it. I want to be in London, where there’s people and things are happening. Nothing ever happens in Sussex. I’ll go mad down there.”
The hardest, of course, would be Holmes. I needed a story that made sense and also would not pique his relentless curiosity. Perhaps he would be relieved. The uneasiness between us would then be at an end. He might miss my companionship for a short while, but his naturally solitary character would soon prevail and he would forget me.
His lips came close. “Your lover. I had a desire to observe him. To see what had claimed you for so many years. I wished to see you two together. To understand your fascination.”
“The consummation?” I recognized the quote. The Irishman loved to show off his knowledge of Shakespeare. But this quote referred to death. To self-slaughter. “To be or not to be.” Under the circumstances I became even more afraid. I backed away, but there was nowhere to go. No escape. The windows were barred and the house infested with the Irishman’s minions. I would look like a fool attempting to run.
“Not today, thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” I said. “I shall be dining out this evening. But some tea would be welcome, if you will.”
“Servants are the eyes and ears of an estate, just as my Irregulars are the eyes and ears of London,” Holmes stated. “They know all, usually without being told. Secrets are the air that they breathe.”
“Here,” said Holmes, handing me the invitation card. “Why not go to the gallery? It might prove amusing and they are certain to offer free food and drink. I will meet you there after I finish my business and then we’ll have supper at the Café Royal or the dining room at the Langham. How does that sound?”
“And neither was I,” Mrs. Hudson returned tartly. “But I have one. And so do you. I will bring up your tea as soon as I’ve gotten this visitor settled in the kitchen.”
When the young man had gone, Holmes got off the bed and undressed. Then he pulled back the bedclothes and got in beside me.
Holmes perused the periodical. “I have told you, my dear boy, that the solving of crime and romance are completely at odds! One is the result of logic, deduction, and sheer brainwork, while the other is a chimera of sentiment and ridiculous emotion!”
“No,” Dilly whispered. “It’s too late. It’s for the best, Charlie. You can live your life now. Find a girl to love – a real girl. Not some false and broken thing like Dilly Mitchell.”
“You gents want to take turns?” he asked. “Or do you fancy having me together? What do you like to do to each other? I reckon you’re the top man, sir,” Thommie winked at me. “You have the air of a man what likes to give orders. Am I right?”
“You understand the situation perfectly. I knew you would, Watson.” He tendered an ingratiating smile. “It’s quite a nice flat and comes fully furnished. And I don’t expect you to act as some kind of – how did you put it? – convenient sexual outlet. I thought of you because you are one of the few people I’ve ever known who I’ve been drawn to immediately. I don’t know why, but it’s true. I feel an odd kinship with you. I suppose that’s what friendship means. I’ve rarely had a real friend – certainly not one since I left University and that was a long time ago indeed. But I feel you are such a friend, my dear boy. I offer you the room because I think it would benefit both of us to throw our lot together. If it doesn’t work out, you are under no obligation whatsoever. And if it does...” He shrugged.
“And there is little hidden between a master and his servant, as you attested before,” I remarked. “So why would a gentleman of good family want to end his life? A young man with seemingly all the attributes society deems necessary for happiness? Exceeding good looks, fortune, two loving parents, a fine home – what more could be desired?”
And I went to my room to change into something more suitable to wear to a gallery opening in Mayfair.
“Good God, Watson!” Holmes cried, bursting in. “What the devil are you doing lazing about like this? Dress yourself! We are going out.”
“I don’t need to see his cards,” he said. “I’ve been watching the game. I know exactly what hand every player has and what cards remain in the deck.”
“Now you are being melodramatic, my boy,” said Holmes. “You feel for this boy and so you begin to empathize with his plight. But you are much too reasonable a fellow ever to fall into such a trap – and so am I. We will both do our best for Charles Griffith – you for his body and I for his situation – but do not begin to believe that you can cure all of his ills – or all the ills of the world. I know you wish to, Watson, but it is impossible. That path leads only to frustration and despair.”
“Yes, London is a bustling place, indeed,” I said. “And you wish to... to seek your fortune?” That sounded ominous.
“Dangerous?” Was it that bad, then? Was something – or someone – swiftly bearing down upon the Irishman? No – bearing down upon us, for now I was one with my master. His fate was now my own fate.
I stared at the slips of paper. They were my markers from the gambling establishment in the City. And also from my gentlemen’s club in Belgravia, and from three different bookmakers. And bills from my tailor and various haberdasheries in the West End. All paid in full.
It was quiet in the baths that afternoon – I seemed to be the only patron. The place was much busier in the morning, when men came before going to their offices in nearby Whitehall, and then again in the evening, when they came for a relaxing steam before repairing to their clubs in St. James.
“There’s no need.” He picked up a small jar from the nightstand. Holmes can always anticipate my actions. “It’s some of Mycroft’s massage oil, but I believe it will suffice.”
“I did have those terrors,” I said. “When the battle would return to me and wake me. It was all too real. Even now those mountains will come back to me and I’ll awake in an icy sweat.”
It was difficult leaving the Irishman, but I knew it was what I had to do if I didn’t want to become something I despised.
The lad shook his head. “I only saw him a few times, briefly. He always came to my lodgings after dark. And he usually sent Dilly’s brother to collect the money.”
“I said I would do it!” Holmes barked. “And what are you doing here? You’re supposed to be sleeping in Mrs. Hudson’s parlour.”
“You are more beautiful than I had imagined, Johnny Lad,” he crooned as he caressed me afterwards. “I am intoxicated by you. Possessing you is a privilege I will not take for granted. You will be cherished, as you well deserve. And no one else will ever have you again. I will keep you safe and sound, I promise you that, my beauty.”
“Doctor Watson,” said Mycroft Holmes, the saturnine presence otherwise known – or rather mainly unknown – as the Eighth Earl of Sherringford. “How are you?”
“Keep watch over him, Doctor,” Mrs. Jenkins entreated me. “Mr. Sherlock never had anyone who cared for him enough to do that. But I think you care enough. As a friend, I mean,” she added quickly. “A good and kindly friend.”
“I must stay,” asserted the major. “And my man, Barton, too.” Major Griffith indicated a well-dressed servant standing on the far side of the bed. “There are... things which you must know.”
“Yes,” said Holmes. “I need to stretch mine as well. Too much coffee this morning. It goes through me like a sieve.”
The Irishman opened a door to a side salon. A few gentleman were inside, viewing a selection of smaller studies.
The woman glared at me, her eyes blazing with a fury I didn’t know she was capable of. “And leave me to deal with Mr. Holmes? With his rages and his chemical concoctions and his shooting up the wall at all hours of the day and night? And the drugs that he takes! You think we all don’t know about that? The maids are afraid to come in here when you’re not at home, Doctor, and that’s the truth. Sometimes I think Mr. Holmes is... is truly crazy! And I mean that! If you leave this house, then I won’t be responsible for him! I don’t care how much extra he pays me! It’s not worth it!”
But the Irishman wanted him dead and if I killed Holmes I would be fulfilling his evil wishes for my own selfish needs. I would be no better than my dark, diabolic lover.
Holmes nodded. “I am willing to wager that Barton knows more than he is saying. He strikes me as a loyal servant who is overly fond of his young master and wishes to protect him.”
Now I take pride not only in my memory, but also in the copious notes I keep on all the enterprises that Sherlock Holmes embarks upon. Many of these details are of a sensitive nature, involving both high and low. Some of Holmes’ cases are so secret that I often worry for fear they should fall into the wrong hands. But Holmes seems to have no such fear. In fact, he encourages me in my literary endeavors, both the trifling adventure stories that I have offered to the public, as well as the accounts of his cases, which so far have remained private.
Yes, I thought, once the Irishman and I have left England, it will be safe for him to come home. He will be safe in all of London, all of England.
“Indeed,” Holmes conceded. “I, too, feel the same way. The city calls to me, my dear fellow. Moriarty might be on the run, but there are other miscreants walking free, other mysteries to be solved, precious jewels to be recovered, missing heirs to be tracked down, embarrassing letters to be retrieved. The game is always afoot, Watson. And London is where that game begins.”
The evening, which had been so delightful, suddenly seemed blighted and dispiriting. All that Stamford had – loving wife, comfortable home, secure profession – was always to be denied to me. Love – that also would be denied to me. And the devotion of a decent female, like Stamford’s Jane, or like Miss Mary Morstan, would forever be out of my reach.
“Who wishes to offer an Affirmation this afternoon?” asked Fred, who, unfortunately, was the counselor conducting Group that first day. “Betty?”
I pulled the creature from her lair and deposited her in the box. Holmes set the top and secured it with twine from a ball we bought at the market. The cat meowed loudly, but I was satisfied that no harm had been done to her.
My mother was a beauty. I know many men say that of their mothers, but in my case it was true. I remember her beauty, although she died when I was six, giving birth to a sister who also died. There was a portrait of her that was my father’s pride and joy – it hung in his study and when he was out I often crept in to gaze at it. She was tall and slender, forever captured in a pale blue dress, her hair as yellow as the sun and her eyes the same shade as the dress. Every person who crossed our door in my childhood stopped and stared at me, exclaiming, “He’s the picture of Marianne! That golden hair and those eyes!” And the women always kissed me and some of them wept, remembering my mother. The servants doted on me, petting me and forever telling me what a pretty lad I was. And I was a happy child, believing the world was in love with me.
He laughed. “You leave a trail a mile wide, as they say in America. I looked for places where a imprudent young man might waste his time and lose his money – and there you were.”
“I lay your dressing gown here, sir,” he said. “On the bed. And Mrs. Jenkins brought up these clean towels for you.”
Mycroft looked on with supreme unconcern. “You should be able to handle this well enough, Doctor. The wound did not seem deep and Sherlock assured me that no major organs had been compromised. I stanched the bleeding as best I was able and we waited for your arrival. Is there anything else you require?”
“No!” I replied with force. “That is not why I hesitate. To me you are far more desirable than any so-called beautiful boy. That lad, that Thommie, was a mere body to me and no more! Even as I was... was fucking him...” I flinched at the indecent word. “I was thinking of another. Only one person. Always that same person!”
“Perhaps if she threw out that ratty jumper she’d be even happier,” Holmes said under his breath. “Not to mention the shoes.” His eyes moved to the stained trainers on her admittedly large feet.
Then I heard another sound. The familiar sound of a small secret door being opened in the nearby wall. A moment later a shadowy form was creeping into my bed.
“And you have no such desires?” I questioned. I noted that his hands were clenched tightly in his lap.
“I don’t sleep too well, Doctor, and that’s a fact. But it’s mainly Dilly I’m afraid for. She was weak before, but now...” His face fell. “She’s bad, sir. Please do what you can.”
We were sitting on the terrace, which had a sweeping view of Sherringford’s extensive park. On Sherring Hill the folly that, according to Lovell, had been built in the 18th century by the Fifth Earl, presided over the landscape. I vowed that when I was fully able, Holmes and I would walk up the hill to the folly. But that time was still a long way off.
I had little spare money to pay for companionship, but I swiftly found that I did not need it to attract the notice of the fairer sex. In fact, there were friendly females everywhere I turned – barmaids, serving girls, widows who offered rooms for rent, married ladies of a certain age who invited a lonely young Englisher to tea, even a black-eyed gypsy in a caravan by a deserted roadside. I may have been a late-bloomer physically, but I was quickly catching up in that phase of my education.
But then I sat up. A sound, like a window-sash being raised. Yet I felt no draught. And the door of the chamber was firmly shut.
Monday morning found Holmes and myself once again in Mycroft’s leaking carriage, lurching towards London in a driving rainstorm.
Holmes sniffed. “Grandfather could never stand losing at chess, either. Although he never climbed the curtains. At least not when he was at home.”
“I’m sorry, Wiggins,” said Holmes. “I will endeavour to get to the bottom of this. But there is nothing I can do at this moment. I’m afraid you will have to go.”
“Oh, it’s been in all the papers since those arrests, but not before. Mrs. Hudson was mostly in the dark,” James said. “But that was because Mr. Sherlock didn’t want her to worry her little head over it.”
“Hopes?” I said. “Hopes for what? That my recovery would fail, as yours has so many times? So you’d have someone to share your failure? A pitiful little acolyte you could watch go down in flames? Someone to feel superior to? You already feel superior to me and everyone else in the known universe! You’ve had so many chances and wasted them all. You’ve obviously a brilliant man, but you’re also a stupid one. Stupid and foolish because you insist on punishing yourself over and over again. I don’t understand why and I don’t really want to know why you wish to destroy yourself, but I don’t wish to be destroyed with you!” I stopped and covered my face with my hands, trying to steady myself. “I only have this month to get myself straight. If I don’t I don’t know what I’ll do. I can’t get a position as a doctor if I’m an addict and my disability pension isn’t enough for me to live on. So what the hell am I supposed to do? You seem to belong to some rich and powerful family and can afford to fritter away your existence, always knowing that money will give you whatever you need -- drugs, rehab, whatever it is you require. I don’t have that luxury. I must succeed here or I might as well off myself! Not that anyone would give a fuck if I did!”
He linked his arm with mine and elbowed his way through the crowd to a door overseen by a burly, black-bearded fellow.
Looking around the cavernous room, it seemed much more welcoming with a roaring fire in the hearth, the bedclothes on large canopy bed turned down, and the steaming tub beckoning. James had rearranged my meagre belongings, hanging my trousers in the press, and setting my brush and shaving kit on the dresser next to the porcelain ewer.
“Why did you not call me yesterday if you were in distress?” I said, immediately taking off my coat and opening my medical bag. “Those dressings should have been changed. I also brought something for the pain.” Although I did not approve of Holmes’ use of narcotics in general, I had brought his morocco case and a vial of morphine.
Regent’s Park rolled out before us like a green carpet and I smiled to myself at how so many things that had lately seemed disastrous had turned out to be the beginning of a new and better existence. Even with a bad leg, a damaged shoulder, and now a nasty chip in my rib and a scar to match, I counted myself the most fortunate of men.
I ran my hands over Thommie’s body. He was smoother and more girlish than Mick Wiggins, but no less wanton. This was not the body I desired. Not the man I had dreamed of or thought upon for so many hours of my life. This was something of the moment. Something bought with money, but no less willing for being bought. No less sweet.
And yet... within minutes I had three drinks set in front of me. A thirtyish fellow in a polo shirt came forward, smiling, but was elbowed aside by an aggressive boy who looked to be no older than twenty-one, who in turn was sent on his way by a tall man in an expensive leather jacket who took my arm and pulled me to a corner table.
“We have no business at all,” I said, steadying myself. “When I left you it was forever, as you well know. You let me go and that was the end of it. Except it is you who keep coming back to me. It is not the other way around.”
I strutted away, laughing, very pleased with myself for having scored off the pretentious gentleman.
“I know what I was,” I said. “And I know what I am. I am aware of the passage of time. But I am not an immortal who can make it stand still.”
Holmes reached into his pocket and took out a crisp five pound note. “Then think of this as payment for medicine for Dilly and adequate food for both prisoners.” He slipped the note into the warder’s jacket pocket. “Plus a pint or two for yourself.”
“No, it isn’t about the cat.” I paused, gathering myself like a horse faced with a five bar gate to jump. “Tomorrow... I will be leaving Baker Street.”
“If I might confide something, sir?” he said. “I wouldn’t, except you’re ever so understanding. I guess ’cause you’re a doctor and used to listening to people’s problems.”
True, I fancy myself an author and have accepted payment for fictional works that purport to stimulate the senses of readers with scenes of mystery and intrigue.
I am a smoker myself, although I am attempting to quit the filthy practice, as I believe a physician should set an example of healthful habits to his patients. But Holmes is a chronic and compulsive puffer. And his pipe tobacco, a rough shag which is tolerable in an airy sitting room with a high ceiling, was not so agreeable in a closed carriage.
“Of course I know all, my dear boy,” he said. “I would be a piss-poor consulting detective if I did not.”
We were shown a room in the back of the house. A small fire was crackling in the grate, but the furnishing were sparse – a plain wooden chair, a table, and a bed. Even the walls were bare – a faded floral wallpaper, but not even a cheap print hanging there to break the monotony.
Holmes looked horrified. “Good Lord, no, Watson! I...” He hesitated, as if searching for the right words. “I’ve been released under the condition that someone responsible live with me. Brother Mycroft was going to hire a...” He winced. “A person to do the job. Some sort of detestable male nanny to watch my every waking move.”
“Nonsense!” Holmes exclaimed. “I am twice the man I was at 20 – stronger in body, more alert in faculties, and certainly my intellect is honed to a knife’s point, far sharper than I could ever have imagined as a mere callow youth.”
“Anything,” Holmes replied. “Loose ends. Moriarty has gone to ground on the Continent like the wily old fox that he is. And a few of his henchmen have still eluded Lestrade’s sieve-like grasp.”
The tone of his voice, the expression on his face, seized me with nameless dread. “Please! I will find a way to repay you,” I pleaded. “I will go to a moneylender.”
Soon I would be leaving London, perhaps never to return. Never to see anyone I knew again. It was a steep price, but I was willing to pay it. My life was worth little compared to...
We followed the major into the house and up the stairs to a large, well-lighted chamber. A man was lying on the bed, the bedclothes pulled up and almost covering his face. Two females stood by, clutching handkerchiefs: the older, a small woman with greying auburn hair whose face was contorted with crying, and the younger, a tall dark-haired girl whose mein was more stoic. Mother and daughter, to be sure. A knot of servants stood behind them, seemingly at a loss for what to do.
“There! Those look a treat!” said James as he surveyed the polished boots. “You’ll look right proud in these, Doctor. What suit are you wearing this evening? I’ll press it up for you neat as a pin.”
“Beastly weather, this,” I sighed. And, as an actor on cue, Gladstone, reclining on the floor of the vehicle, farted loudly and then sighed along with me.
“Dilly,” said Charles. “Dilly Mitchell. She entertained on the stage there. Sang so sweetly that it touched my heart. And she is beautiful, too, with yellow hair and cornflower blue eyes. The moment I saw her I felt... felt something I had never felt before in my life.”
“If we were ever to vacate these rooms, Watson, Mrs. Hudson would be hard pressed to find equally engaging tenants to replace us,” commented Holmes. “Then she would be condemned to a lifetime of bourgeois tedium and intellectual ennui. She should reward us with a reduction in our rates based solely on our entertainment value.”
“I know how you, as a medical man, encourage the consumption of fresh vegetable matter, both for yourself and for your patients,” he replied. “I therefore alerted the staff.”
“I saw you at the reception,” she said. “I was not aware you were in Rome.” She paused. “Or that you had been taken up by...”
“I must go,” she said, standing abruptly. “I am meeting the Princess di Cristalli for tea and mustn’t be late.” She bent to kiss my cheek. “God bless you, John.”
“I am very interested in the effect of Art on the senses,” continued Wilde. “And the consequences of Art on how one lives one’s life. It must be a disconcerting thing to look upon one’s own face from many years before and understand that time has passed. Not that you are not a handsome fellow now, my dear John.”
“Don’t be vulgar!” I returned. “Sometimes I wonder at you, Holmes. I find that you are the scion of an old and noble family, brought up in opulent circumstances, obtaining every advantage, and yet you insist on behaving as if you were raised in a stableyard!”
“I was wondering when you’d arrive, my dear boy,” said Holmes. “Good Lord, you look like hell. Bad night?”
Mrs. Stamford brought forth her opinion of some new novel by Lady Constance Lawrence that was all the fashion among the women, but neither Stamford nor I had read the thing, so we let the ladies hash it out among themselves. Mrs. Stanford was of the opinion that it was quite wonderfully true to life, while Miss Morstan felt the plot was rife with coincidences that beggared credulity.
“Nearby,” I said. “A savage and mountainous land.” I closed my eyes, thinking about it. “I almost died there. I was hit in the leg as well. That wound was not life-threatening, but it troubles me more now than the shoulder. This bath is quite soothing to it.”
I waited for him to speak. But there was nothing. I turned out the light. He never came over to me. We both lay in the darkness, staring at the ceiling, as the minutes passed. Finally, I heard a soft snuffle and then a louder snore and knew there would be no final good-bye. I turned over and eventually fell asleep. In the morning, he was already gone from his bed when I woke. I took my bag, signed the release papers, and walked out into the bright, dangerous world.
“Oh, yes,” said Holmes. “We’re all so very, very happy for you, my dear boy.” He stared at me and my heart sank. Now I was one of the enemies.
“Don’t add blasphemy to our presumed sins, my dear boy,” Holmes retorted. “If there is a Supreme Being who created these bodies, then assuredly He made them for such delight as this. Now, shut your mouth and fuck me once more, this time even more forcefully, if you would be so kind.”
I turned to leave, but my foot touched a package on the floor. I picked it up to place upon the table. Then something caught my eye. Something familiar about the handwriting. Something that tugged at the fog of my memory.
“James is of no consequence,” Holmes dismissed. “You are perfectly capable of dressing yourself without assistance. You have done for many a year without a valet.”
I found my way upstairs and down the dim hallway to my room. “Oh,” I said, as I opened the door. “I didn’t expect anyone to be in here.”
“I mean it, my boy. There is no being on earth whose approbation I treasure more,” he returned. He was staring into the dwindling fire, his fine profile sharpened by the shadows of the evening. “You ask if I were ever lonely as a boy. I did not understand then that I was missing the companionship other boys take for granted. Mycroft and I took our singularity as the natural order of things and we turned to each other when we needed the encouragement that might otherwise been offered by a parent or adult mentor. But you have met my brother – he’s not a warm or easy man and he was not warm or easy as a youth. He was not someone in whom I could confide my thoughts or dreams. In fact, I never considered that such a person might exist. A person in whom I could always rely, always trust, and always know that he would forgive, no matter what damnable offense I might commit in my bumbling, blockheaded manner.”
“But we have a little time for this,” he whispered. And he held me and kissed me. Kissed me forcefully, almost brutally. But I did not flinch, although I hated him with all my heart and all my soul.
But James sprang to his feet. “I’ll do it, Doctor! Let me get some hot water and I’ll fix you up right as rain.”
“I doubt that.” The room was small and there were two single beds. Since Holmes had flopped down and was now lounging on one, I shifted my dufflebag onto the other bed, sat down, and began unpacking the few belongings, minus my confiscated mouthwash and cologne, I had been permitted to bring with me. “If I weren’t both an idiot and an ass I wouldn’t be here.”
“I’ve been an idiot,” said Holmes. “I have pretended that emotions were nothing to me, but it was only because I did not trust myself to those emotions. Self-discipline has always been my refuge – I could not allow myself to lose control for fear all would be lost!”
But all was not well in London. There were pretenders to the Irishman’s empire, as well as Scotland Yard, which was breathing down the necks of many of his minions. But always the Irishman himself stayed aloof. He had made certain that it was difficult, if not impossible, to connect him to the many enterprises he surveyed. But he was restless, very restless, and that made him touchy. He sometimes lashed out at me in anger, but I could never strike back – to do so would have been too dangerous. I found that I liked my life, even if it lacked all purpose. Even if it lacked any sense of honour or decency.
“They’re in the next room,” Lestrade grunted. “But you have no right to put any questions to them, Mr. Holmes. They are officially under arrest and therefore in my personal custody. This is my case and I consider it closed!”
Would Holmes even believe me? Perhaps he would know I was lying but pretend to believe me. Then we would be able to part on equal terms, both knowing that the truth was too disturbing to support.
The house was a large one, a detached dwelling set back from the road and apart from any of its neighbors. The carriage pulled up to the door and a silent servant ushered us inside. There was a chill over the place and a hush, as if warmth and speech were strangers there. I saw a sitting room where a small fire was lit and began to move towards it, but the Irishman’s iron hand gripped my shoulder like a vise.
I rose and found my clothes, dressing noiselessly. Then I unlocked the door of the bedroom and went into the outer room.
We departed from Baker Street the next morning in a driving rainstorm and bounced and bumped the entire way, cold and soggy in a closed carriage that leaked in at least two places, one of which was directly above my head.
“You are solo today, Doctor, sir?” he asked. Ivan was a stocky Russian with a shaved head. Except for the manager, who appeared genuinely Turkish, all the attendants were Russians.
I then visited my bank at Charing Cross, drawing out all of the savings I had. It was not a great amount and made me painfully aware of what little mark I had made on the world – a handful of bank notes, some pages of sensational stories published in shilling magazines, and a box of papers under my bed detailing Holmes’ most interesting cases. I would leave that box in Holmes’ room before I left. His private investigations would then be securely in his own hands.
“Simple observation, my dear fellow,” said Holmes. “I am, after all, now quite an expert in matters of the heart.”
James shook his head. “No, indeed. But by the time you got here, you were delirious. Mr. Sherlock sent for a doctor from London. I came down to help out. There was an infection and the doctor feared for your life. But me and Mr. Sherlock never gave up hope.”
“Ha!” Holmes brayed. “Capital, Watson! I should force my brother to come out and take a turn in the ring with me. Can you picture that? He always used to get the better of me when we were lads – he was so much older and larger. But the tables are turned now! Yes, the tables are turned!” He bit off another piece of sausage and threw the remainder to the dog.
“Yes,” he said. “That word is so alien to me, but it was love I wanted. Love that I desired. My tutor got into my bed and began to make love to me. But that was not what I wanted. I wanted love from the heart and the soul, not what he wished to do. I did not even know those acts existed, such was my innocence. And when I cried out and said I didn’t want to... to do that – he did it anyway.”
“I’m pleased to make your acquaintance, Watson,” he said, taking my proffered hand. His grip was firm and uncompromising. I thought I felt a spark of static electricity pass between us, which wasn’t peculiar seeing that the air in the facility was ridiculously dry. “And you can call me Holmes.”
“I must take the food for Mick and Dilly over to the gaol first,” he said, standing. “And I’ll keep taking food over there until they’re free. That might be a long while, mightn’t it, sir?”
Perhaps I dwell on these things because I have been on my own for so long: my mother dead in my early childhood, my father a remote figure with little time for children, my elder brother of unsettled and uneven character. When I was still at school my father died, leaving only enough money for my education and little more. My brother, trained in law, eschewed that practice and instead followed business schemes that always seemed to go awry, usually due to his mind being befuddled by drink. He swiftly lost his inheritance – what little there was of it – and went to seek his fortune in the colonies, first the West Indies, then Australia. I never saw him again, learning of his untimely fate only when an unknown solicitor in Sydney sent me his personal effects, chiefly a few letters and our father’s watch.
“Young Quigley is my current lieutenant. I am hopeful that he has some intelligence for me.” Holmes paced, his hands behind his back. “If you would excuse me, Watson, but I think the lad will be more forthcoming if it is only the two of us. He’s a bit of a bolter.”
“I am, Doctor,” the fellow boasted. “I even got me own room over by Charing Cross. I works as a messenger for the telegraph office in Oxford Street. I get wages and I keeps all my tips!”
“So they say,” Holmes agreed. “My ceaseless questions drove the Old Earl to distraction. And I went through tutors like he went through mistresses and steeds – using them hard until they were useless and then moving on to the next. And I excelled at many pursuits. My violin master wanted to take me to Vienna to study. He said I might be the next great virtuoso on that instrument and I must study composition and prepare myself for a career in the concert hall.”
Then I looked at her face. She was laughing at me. She was as heartless as the Irishman. They all were. No one cared what happened to me, not even my own brother, so why should this woman take pity? I cried, but still she laughed. I thought of ways to kill myself, but I knew I would not do it. “A consummation devoutly to be wished.” But I was a coward. I was a child. I wanted my life – but I wanted it on my own terms, not the Irishman’s. He was besotted with me, she’d said. Perhaps there was still time, still hope...
“A green salad stimulates the digestion and purifies the blood, just as fresh fruit in the morning energizes the body. Mr. Lovell,” I said to the butler. “Please bring a plate of greens for Mr. Sherlock as well. He will also be indulging at the evening meal for the duration of our stay.”
I sipped some of the liquid courage. Now was the time. If I waited any longer I would not be able to say the words. I had told Mrs. Hudson and James, I had arranged with Anstruther, now all I needed was to tell Holmes. Then I could leave England with my mind clear, even if my heart was far from free of regrets.
“Let me come to London with you!” James exclaimed. “I’d valet for both you gentlemen! Gentlemen need someone to care for them, it’s not fitting otherwise. You’re ever so nice, sir, and Mr. Sherlock seems much more congenial than Mr. Mycroft. I’d be honoured to serve you!”
“More than you can imagine,” he said darkly. “I could strike at your ridiculous paramour at any time, but I refrain. Always remember that: he’s only alive because I do not wish to kill him – yet.”
“I know,” Charles sighed. “But now I was tainted. My father was furious. He said I must study and try to be admitted into one of the lesser universities. But my heart wasn’t in it. That’s when I met Dilly. She was everything I could have hoped for.”
I’d just spent half the night shagging my head off and ordinarily the last thing I’d be thinking of at six o’clock in the morning was more of the same, but in this case...
“I am not common!” I retorted. “My father was a solicitor and my grandfather a doctor! They were both gentlemen, as am I!”
“That may well be,” he agreed. “And you, my dear boy, are a young soul. I think even when you are an old man, you will seem like a green youth.”
“Moriarty.” He muttered the name. “Were you in love with him? I mean... back then. Before you left for the East.”
“Get away from me!” I jerked my arm from his grasp. “I don’t have to listen to such rot! And Holmes is not my paramour!”
“Holmes, don’t you feel it might be best to get off the bed?” I suggested. “At least while...” I nodded in the direction of the footman.
“I wouldn’t dream of denying it,” Holmes said grandly. “It belonged to my grandfather. But you are correct – I don’t exactly need help in paying the rent.”
Reaching London in the New Year, I fancied myself a well-traveled, self-proclaimed expert in the art of love, proud to be still in firm possession of my manhood. In other words, I was a smug and insufferable young jackass. And I was happier and more carefree than I have ever been in my life, before or afterwards.
Sherlock Holmes was standing there, waiting for me. He was leaning against a lamppost, smoking his pipe thoughtfully.
Mrs. Jenkins covered her mouth in forbidden glee. “Oh, Doctor, His Lordship was a Tartar, that he was! But don’t be saying that I told you so!” She moved up the stairs. “Here’s the old gentleman himself.”
“You will return to Mrs. Hudson’s parlour and go to bed,” Holmes ordered. “Let Watson alone – for now.”
“I see you did not bring a valet, Mr. Sherlock,” said Lovell. “Who will unpack and lay out your attire?”
For my other, greater shame was that I knew I wanted to do this and wanted it done to me. And that the Irishman had discerned that desire and brought it to light. Because I could not deny that my body had roused to him, eagerly meeting his ministrations with a response that dwarfed my experience with women, as delightful as that had always been. My body – my prick and my arse and my mouth – had betrayed me, even as my mind fought and lost.
“Something I don’t discuss,” I said. “Something I cannot discuss. Ever. Not with you, not with any living being.”
But I could see no other way to protect the life of the only living person I cared anything for – Sherlock Holmes. His safety was all that mattered. The Irishman had given me my freedom because he loved me. Now I was giving Holmes the same thing, and for the same reason.
But the Irishman was troubled and preoccupied. Something was happening in his empire – something ill.
“Destiny. Kismet, as the Mohammedan would say. I believe that certain things are determined by a higher power. Certain meetings. Certain successes and failures. And that certain people are bound by fate to rule over others.”
“You have left debts all over this city,” he continued. “They are not substantial obligations, as such things are understood.”
I wanted to go there to see Holmes, if only to assure myself that he was not in pain, that his wound was being seen to, that...
The first fellow touched the sleeve of my coat. “Don’t mind Cedric, my good man. He’s worse for too much champagne. Would you like a glass? Shall I call the waiter?”
The Irishman leaned close to me. “Three days,” he allowed. “That should be enough time. You will come to me on Sunday and I will be waiting. Then we will go abroad for a while.”
“He did, my dear fellow,” Holmes replied. “You don’t think I’d allow anyone else but you to touch me? There’s no one I trust but you, especially now.”
As the cab rattled through the dark streets I made notice of something. “Holmes, we are going in the wrong direction. Cleveland Street isn’t this far from Baker Street. I believe we just passed through Russell Square!”
The hansom let me off on Piccadilly, near the Royal Academy. It was the nearest I could safely come to the Diogenes Club without giving anything away should the Irishman’s minions be stalking me.
“That’s a fine dog,” I heard him say to Gladstone. “Do you want your breakfast? And a run outdoors? Come then! Come on, boy!”
“Welcome to Sherringford Hall, Mr. Sherlock,” said the butler in a distinctly unwelcoming tone. It was obvious that our arrival had interrupted the tedious routine of the place.
A sensation of dread raced through me, but I didn’t speak. Perhaps it was only a coincidence. There were many professors in England. Many. There was nothing to connect the Irishman with this man of whom Mick Wiggins was so petrified.
“Why, Watson, you sound like a Socialist,” Holmes laughed. “Or a lapsed Catholic rethinking his beliefs.”
“I think you’ll do well,” said Fred. “You don’t have an addict’s personality.” He paused. “Unlike some people here. They dig in their heels and refuse what’s good for them. But you want to do well and please. You’re a doctor and that’s important. I think you could help others, John. You might do a world of good -- as long as you conform and learn to work the program.”
“You can decorate your room any way you wish,” said Holmes, showing me around. “If you don’t like this bed or the furniture, say the word and I’ll have it taken away.”
“I must get to the bottom of this if I am to save you and Dilly,” Holmes said urgently. “Tell me, Wiggins – who else might want William Fisher dead?”
“Yes, madam. Thank you. Say hello to the Lord on my behalf.” He walked over to the door and closed it firmly. “Good God, Watson! I will never understand your penchant for gushing over females,” said Holmes, taking out his pipe and lighting it.
Holmes and I had been patronizing this establishment for years, but I had never been there on my own. I was greeted at the door by the manager, Mr. Ozmet, and directed to the changing room. One of the regular attendants, Ivan, took my clothes and presented me with a large white Turkish towel, which I wrapped around myself.
“How do you know that?” I asked, eyeing him suspiciously. Had this strange man somehow seen my files? But how could that be? “And you knew I’d been in Afghanistan.”
“I’m not forgetful of the past,” I said, turning away. “The past sits on my shoulder like a great dark bird, blighting my very existence and making any future happiness impossible!”
The driver and his mate unhitched the horses and then disappeared down the sodden road into the mirk. The rain had ceased, so I stepped from the carriage to relieve myself. I foresaw a long wait as the Irishman’s servants sought and procured a new wheel – or a new vehicle.
He did not need to tell me that the police were on his scent and we were one step ahead of Scotland Yard. I went and packed my things, including my medical books, for I still had hopes.
“He’s working on it,” I assured him. “But this is a difficult case. And Inspector Lestrade and Scotland Yard are not helping. They believe they have the true culprits.”
“I could have done,” said Holmes. “I used to do it regularly when I was a lad. But no, I came through another venue – one known only to myself and my brother.” He yawned and stretched his legs. “That’s much better!”
Holmes and I were breakfasting the next morning when James hurried into the room. “Constable Clark is here, sir,” he said. “With a note from Inspector Lestrade.”
That teaching served me well in my medical studies. And it served me well in Her Majesty’s service. And it has served me in my excursions, my adventures if you will, with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
“Next time tell your henchmen to be more careful.” I faced him directly, showing him my forehead. “This is what your air-gun did.”
All the pain and fear would be over, then. Moriarty would be defeated, deprived of the satisfaction of gloating about his triumph over Holmes. And I would be free, finally.
“I like them older.” The young scoundrel licked his lips lewdly. “They always have a lot in their bag of tricks.”
I threw aside my apprehensions and took him into my arms. “You know that answer! How could you doubt my feelings? How could you have ever doubted them, after all these years?”
That was Holmes’ idea of pillow talk – pointed maxims and painful observations. If I was expecting romance of any kind, then I was in the wrong bed with the wrong man. But I didn’t care. I wasn’t thinking of the future and I wasn’t hoping for anything beyond that moment.
“Well, now!” James exclaimed as he came into the room with a large silver tray. “Gentlemen! I have broth for you, Doctor Watson, and tea with plenty of sugar. And for you, Mr. Sherlock – whiskey and soda.”
“You are a spoiled brat,” said the Irishman. “Entranced by your own beauty and certain that you will always get your way. And, if you follow my instruction instead of that of the well-meaning but very limited Lady Percy, then you will certainly always get your way from any man and woman you desire. Except me, of course. Because I will always know what you really are.”
“I don’t have a normal life,” I returned. “I left so-called normal life behind long before I was wounded. My parents are dead and my brother and his family are in Australia. The friends I knew before I went into the Army aren’t the kind who would be of any help to a damaged man coming out of drug rehab. When I leave here...” I shrugged. “I don’t know what I’ll do.”
“It’s the exact color of your eyes, my dear,” she said. “And it will look much better on you than ever it looked on Lord Percy.” She patted my hand. “John, if you need money, you have only to ask. I will give you the fare back to England – or wherever you might wish to go. America, perhaps. I have friends in New York. I will write you a letter of introduction.”
The room was smoke-filled and crammed with small tables. All the denizens were turned to a stage at the far end. An out-of-tune pianoforte played while a slender figure in a mauve gown sang. I did not recognize the song, but the words I caught were vulgar beyond belief. Something about a sailor and a maiden who was not quite a maiden. Every verse was greeted with catcalls and hoots of laughter.
“I cannot heal while my mind and my heart are in turmoil!” I replied with fervor. “You say you knew all. But how can that be? I feel as if I am in a dream, or a nightmare, in which everything I believed to be true is a delusion. And the person I thought I knew best proves to be someone else altogether.”
“I was afraid,” he said. “Afraid you would flee from me in abhorrence. I knew you had also been hurt, in body and in soul. And I did not wish to test you, for fear you would break. I should have known that you were the stronger one. I should have known that. But... I was still afraid. Until...”
The moment I stepped into the gallery on Bond Street and handed Holmes’ invitation to the attendant, I knew I had made a dreadful miscalculation. But it was too late for retreat.
“Oh, no!” Stamford cried in dismay. “Never! Not at all. I’d never suggest such a thing.” But the vehement way he was denying it told me that’s exactly what he was suggesting. “I’m only saying that you need to mingle with a wider circle of people. Meeting a few appropriate ladies could not hurt you, Watson. The charming Miss Morstan can be extremely diverting.”
“Twaddle!” said Holmes. “What earthly use to me is a title? I have even less need of it than Mycroft. And if Mycroft is the most unlikely man to breed an heir, I am certainly the second most unlikely. I have an allowance for life that more than meets my needs, and if I am ever short of funds, I ask Mycroft for an advance. Whatever would I do with this hideous monstrosity of a house? And all the land and farms surrounding it? And to be responsible for the lives of all the servants and tenants? I like my life as it is – I am a free Englishman, Watson, as are you, unencumbered by such trifles. Who could ask for more in this life?”
Something within me sighed in relief. Going home was the beginning of normality and I longed for things to be back to normal – with one vital alteration.
Resolved! Nothing was resolved! In fact, things were more complicated than ever. How would we live, now that we were breaking the law every time we committed those acts deemed as ‘gross indecency’? James knew the truth, and I was certain that Mycroft, in his saturnine way, also knew. But what of Mrs. Hudson and the girls? Could Holmes and I live under her roof as lovers and keep them all oblivious?
My mind turned to Holmes. How was he bearing up? And his wound – was it giving him pain? I should have seen him that day and changed his dressings, but I had no word from either him or Mycroft and I dared not seek him out until summoned.
“And no more broth for me,” I said, pushing away the proffered spoon. “I’m very tired. I think rest would be best.”
And then there were all those notes from my excursions with Holmes. One day, perhaps, they might form the basis for... something.
“And what do you know about this matter?” I probed, trying to use Holmes’ own methods of obtaining information. “You are the major’s manservant, but I imagine you also valet for his son, is that not true?”
He kissed me and I kissed back. We fell upon the bed and the rusty springs rattled so I thought they would give way. But they did not – no, they did not give way. Thommie’s legs wrapped around my waist, pressing me to him, into him. In my mind I pictured the tableau, with the fair young man thrusting mightily and Thommie squealing and moaning. But it was I who was thrusting. I who was delving deeply into the boy. He clutched and clawed at my back, his dark eyes rolled back in unfeigned delirium.
“It’s an invention of a certain German and is used by assassins and other cowards who wish to kill without being heard.” He stopped pacing and took out his pipe, lighting it with agitated fingers. “There is only one in England that I know of and it is owned by...”
“I’ve tried.” My forehead was aching and I rubbed it. Gladstone, who had been dozing before the hearth, awoke and stretched. Then he came over and nuzzled my bad leg. He often did that when I was distressed, as if he was trying to comfort me. “Good old Gladstone. You’re not a young fellow anymore. You’ll need someone to care for you, too, won’t you, lad?”
One day I had the carriage take me into town and drop me on the Strand for luncheon and some shopping, with orders to pick me up a few hours later. But I did not go shopping – I went to the University of London to inquire about entering the Medical School.
Then one of my club friends directed me to a certain gambling establishment. It was in a disagreeable area of the City, which I will refrain from naming because the humiliation of my youthful imprudence still stings. But I was sure the gods were with me – I was young, handsome, and cocky. The cards must turn my way! Luck had to be mine!
“Please, Miss Morstan!” I begged. “Please sit here and calm yourself. I am fine! I was never in any mortal danger!” It was a lie, but only a white one.
I went into Holmes’ bedchamber. I had only rarely entered its hallowed precincts in the years we had resided at 221b. Holmes liked his privacy and I respected that, although he did not feel the same compunction, often invading my room at all hours, dragging me from my bed and hastening me off into the night on some errand of adventure.
“Silence, my dear boy.” Holmes pressed his fingers against my lips. “I know it will be difficult to stifle the sounds of ecstasy I am capable of coaxing out of a responsive partner, but at least make the attempt. If we hear anyone coming down the hallway, we shall simply desist until they advance.”
I could feel Holmes’ heart beating, his breath hot on my cheek. “I’m no stranger to the abyss. That’s how I came to be here, remember? Afghanistan?”
“Some gentlemen are shy,” said Thommie, stripping off his trousers and standing only in his shirt. “Your mate will come around. He can watch a bit to put himself in the mood. I saw him watching me at the Cockerel. I saw him licking his lips. He’ll be a goer once he gets started.”
This indolent life took its toll, leaving my body slack and weakened, which was not to the Irishman’s liking. So he instructed his bodyguards to teach me fisticuffs and also engaged an Alsatian fencing master to spar with me daily with the foil and shortstick. The Alsatian started me on a course of exercise to strengthen my legs and upper body – a regimen that served me well in my recovery from the horrors of Afghanistan and which I use to this day to keep in fighting trim.
“Your aid is not necessary, I assure you!” I finally told him. “I am not going to fall and break into pieces!”
“Vernet,” he provided. “Yvonne Vernet. Yes, she was my grandmother. Unfortunately, she was not my grandfather’s wife, the Countess of Sherringford.”
But in the quiet darkness that was for ourselves alone, we never addressed what might happen afterwards. Neither of us wished to sully what little time we had left.
“Then you don’t know me at all,” I replied. “For I am not brave. I am not even fully a man. That is my fate. And my curse.”
“Yes,” I asserted. “Mick and James have gone to a new life. They may be able to live freely there, but perhaps not. But can we live freely? In a society that judges us sinners and wrong-doers?”
“That is no longer possible,” said Holmes. “I remember when he was a pup. Even then he was a greedy and indolent creature. And ill-tempered.”
“And I am likely never to get out of here at all. Or else...” I felt his mouth against my neck. “Fred told you that they threatened me with prison, didn’t he?”
The Irishman blinked. Now I had surprised him. “Don’t toy with me, John Watson. That is a dangerous game.”
I can live with that. I long ago vowed to live with it. But now that he knows for certain the truth about what I did with Mick Wiggins, things cannot continue in the status quo.
“Obviously,” I said shortly. My face burned, as if he knew. As if he could tell where I had been and what I had been doing. And, being Sherlock Holmes, he did. He knew all. Knew at a single glance.
I turned and strode to the door. The shadows of falling night lay heavy in the corners and in the rooms beyond. A shudder coursed through me.
His quarters were Spartan. A bed, unmade. A table, piled with papers, books, and pipe paraphernalia. The press, gaped open, spilling a tumble of clothes onto the floor. Perhaps we did need James to keep order here, since Holmes would never allow Mrs. Hudson to breach his defenses.
“The tender and honest emotions of a lady can never be misconstrued, my dear Miss Morstan,” I told her warmly. “I cannot promise that I will never be put into such a position in the future, but I assure you that I will take as much care for my own life as I would for yours, if it were to be placed in my hands.”
“Don’t you find that for a novel to be true, it must be exactly like life, Doctor?” said Miss Morstan, turning her large blue eyes upon me. “I cannot enjoy a story that is too fantastic. It seems so silly.”
And as I stood in our quiet sitting room in Baker Street that night after leaving the Irishman’s house, knowing Holmes was somewhere else, wounded and in pain, his life in mortal danger, I knew I had made the right choice, even if it meant the forfeit of my own life.
I wandered north through Spain, finding that country both picturesque and easy on my limited purse. But I was eager to get to La Belle France and try out the years of French I had labored over in school. And also to try out the charms of Paris I had read so much about in the literature of Dumas, Hugo, and Verne.
“No,” said Holmes. “He wanted to kill you. But he could not. I shot your revolver – and, to my everlasting regret, I missed Moriarty and hit you. I ran up, crying out, as you slumped in his arms. And I saw his face. That look will always haunt me. He was torn between staying with you and saving himself – and that choice destroyed him. I know that is true. I stood over you both, the pistol in my hand. I might have shot him right there, but I could not.” Holmes swallowed hard. “You were bleeding profusely and I cried out, ‘Do something, man!’ He kissed you – and then he got up and ran. I didn’t even watch him run away. I dropped the pistol and took you into my arms, doing all I could to staunch the flow of blood. Lestrade and his men arrived in moments. If they had come any later, I swear you would not be here.”
“I am sorry not to have been there to benefit from your generous tutelage, ” I said with as much sarcasm as I could muster.
“Of course,” I replied, my heart breaking only slightly. “We wouldn’t want that. So you’d just like a convenient sexual outlet, is that it? And I’m obviously available at little trouble and no expense.”
“Our dog,” he repeated as the housekeeper and butler exchanged glances. “He will eat anything, so be careful of what you drop on the floor. He also emits certain odors, so he will need to take the air regularly.” Holmes handed the end of the lead to the red-faced woman.
I swallowed. My throat felt dry and constricted. “And you knew of my previous relationship with... with the Irishman. You knew it even before he sent you those... those drawings of me from so long ago.”
“The idea of Mick Wiggins in a policeman’s uniform is a jarring one,” I said. “But he certainly does not lack for spirit or bravery.”
Holmes paused to light his pipe. “Can any man – or woman, for that matter – live as freely as he might wish? Only the thoroughly lawless believe themselves free, but that too is a chimera, as Moriarty undoubtedly understands now, wherever he may be hiding.”
“This is most unusual, Watson,” he chastised as I tried to explain that I might be gone from London for some time. “I have covered for you many a time in the past, but only for short periods. But now you say you don’t know when you might return. I find it most unconventional.”
The next few days saw us settling back into our accustomed routine. I rose late, long after Holmes had crept from my bed and seated himself on the sofa, opening the early mail and perusing the morning papers. James had already been up and about for hours, running errands for Mrs. Hudson and carrying messages for Holmes to and from Lestrade at Scotland Yard. Since the weather was so fine, in the afternoons I managed a daily walk up to Regent’s Park with Gladstone, always with James in hovering attendance.
Yes, that was my type – witty and beautiful blonde women. And dark, brooding, brilliant and impossibly difficult men. That was my lamentable fate.
James made a grim face. “It was bad, Doctor, and that’s no lie. But we’ve been here every moment. Mr. Sherlock slept on the floor next to your bed – he refused the chair or the divan – in case you woke in the night and called for him. But you mainly mumbled nonsense about India and such. Lord, Doctor, you seem much better now!”
But Holmes was a complete misogynist. If he ever felt an authentic emotion for a woman – even for the loathsome Mademoiselle Adler – he had never expressed it. I’d come to believe that he was incapable of such emotion for any living being, but certainly not for a female.
“He is...” I hesitated. I had only met the man on a few occasions, in every instance in connection with one of Holmes’ cases. “A substantial fellow, of keen intellect and solitary habits.”
No wonder Holmes despised me! No wonder he could barely stand the sight of me. I was not fit for the company of a decent, honourable man such as Sherlock Holmes. The sooner I quit these lodgings, the better.
The tall man, his eyes closed in bliss, suddenly opened them. He stopped the lad’s ministrations  and raised him to his feet. Then he lay Thommie on the velvet-covered divan, lifted his legs high, and began to fuck him vigourously.
When I saw Dilly my heart sank even lower. The boy was thinner and paler than before, if that was possible. He had not been imprisoned even a week, but this was the result. A month would be the death of him.
I shrugged and climbed inside. I did not care when we were leaving or where we were going. I had given up my life, my self, to the Irishman’s enterprise and nothing else mattered.
“I have not in many years,” I maintained, my nerves rattled. “And one that traffics in... in sodomy is beyond the pale!”
“Or until we can fly across like those birds.” James pointed to a gull swooping over the harbour. “Never fear, Mick. We’ll probably be sick together. They call it feeding the fishes.”
On the other hand, the flat was literally a penthouse, high above street-level, so the noise was abated somewhat. It was also luxurious – furnished with antiques and Turkish carpets, centrally heated and air-conditioned, with a kitchen twice the size of my bedsit.
She shut my file and tossed it on the desk. “You will, John. Or should I say Dr. Watson? Fred, do you have anything to add?”
It was James, the young footman. “Mr. Lovell sent me to tell you that dinner will be served at half past six, sir. Mr. Sherlock is already in his room, dressing for dinner.”
“Doctor!” he cried, his eyes brightening. “And you, too, Guv’nor! I knew you’d come and spring us. We didn’t do nothin’, I swear it! When we come in, Bill was already stone dead.”
