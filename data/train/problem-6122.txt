“I’ll text you the time, place, and dress code.” Tony says, his smile audible in his voice. “Go on, then, shoo. Bye-bye.”
“And then,” Lucy is telling Doris, her voice as confident as anything, “I’m gonna marry my soulmate n’ we’re gonna live in a little house with cherry trees upfront.”
For a moment, Steve thinks Tony will kiss him. Instead, he only nods, straightening up. “I’ll see you later, Steve.”
Tony lets him draw him up into his arms, lets him kiss him, soft and slow, before he draws away. Steve deserves to have this, deserves this moment of sweetness.
His mind calmed by a review of the task at hand, Steve checks his ID again, making sure he remembers his code name — Grant Hale — and glances up at Tony, trying to read the blank mask on his face. Somehow, it’d been easier to understand Iron Man’s moods.
It hangs in the air, thick and ever-present, and sometimes Steve is convinced everyone else can see it and just doesn’t have the words to bring it up. He dreams, sometimes, of himself covered in handprints, of people pointing and laughing. There goes Captain America. He’s a—
Steve stares at him, confused. Hadn’t this man gone out of his way to offer him his house, to stock his room, to build him suits? Hadn’t the Wasp assured him that he liked him, that he’d been busy?
“Don’t you think joining our team could provide a useful platform to get that message out there, Thor?” Tony asks.
He’s at home in his own tailored suit, perfectly at ease in the armored car. His sunglasses hide his eyes, but Steve can imagine the crinkle in his lower eyelid that should come with the sardonic half smirk he’d worn on the way out. It’s slipped off now into a perfect, untouchable neutrality Steve envies.
Neither of them bring it up again. Steve imagines offering to add more flowers another night, but the mysterious implication looms over them, unclear but somehow all the scarier for it.
The sound of swishing skirts alerts both of them at once to Mrs. Roth’s presence in the room. Arnie jumps, disentangling himself from Steve with a speed that suggests he’s been caught doing something wrong.
Steve hums in his response, slightly choked but almost amused, a vague, self-satisfied kind of permission.
Tony didn’t look surprised, only grim, like something unpleasant had just been confirmed for him. He raised his hand to his chest, as though feeling for his own heartbeat, and dropped it again. “Was it—?”
Future Steve sat down on the couch next to them, his side brushing against Tony’s. For a moment, Steve expected Tony to stand up and go, but instead he moved awkwardly to one side, leaving two inches between him and each Steve.
Later, when the fight is over, the bomb out of the way, he’s hanging back in the air, still ready to help any overturned trucks or crushed men. He doesn’t turn away when he sees Steve, his uniform badly torn, blood streaming out of his nose, duck behind one of the armored trucks to take his own turn throwing up his breakfast. There’s substantially more food in this one, coming out in a mostly-digested mush.
Years ago, Tony had gone swimming with orcas in the icy waters off the coast of Norway. He’d chosen whales because sharks were too normal, too predictable, too easy. Half his friends had swam with a great white. He’d been struck by the ocean as much as the whales themselves, the cruel bite of cold even through his thermal wetsuit, the jerky, unpredictable shadows moving under the ice.
He expects Rogers to draw his hand back and do the rest himself, but instead the soldier just stands there, letting Tony pull his hands around and fuss with the seams, pulling pockets of red leather from each fingertip. He’s probably right handed — he seems like he would be. This probably easier for him.
Tony’s responding rumble is harder to understand. Steve thinks about Donald Blake’s humble practice with some amusement.
But he’s a dying man, in the end, a man whose heart will eventually doom him to a quick and painful end, gone too soon. More than this, he’s a man who will never, ever deserve to be soulmates with Captain America, will never be enough for him.
It’s a man. He’s tall and broad, tanned, his features sharp, light brown hair smoothed back with pomade. He wears a nondescript uniform, vaguely Jarvis-like; there’s the white button-down and vest, the black slacks,
They drug his soda. Steve’s usually above this kind of thing, too present, too grounded, to fall for it. It’s not only his muscles that are peak human; his senses are just as keen. He should taste the faint metallic under taste in the Fanta, should feel something slightly off with the carbonation. He should be better than this.
supposed to work like that, that normally any images carried over are supposed to be temporary, that it’s really more about dreams and feelings and all of that stuff that’s hard to understand, hard to sort through. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe the universe had always known that Tony finds objective evidence reassuring, that fragile things like people and dreams come hard to him. Maybe this perfect fingerprint, as clear and objective as anything can be, was actually put there for him to find.
“She—“ he starts, and then immediately cuts himself off, “you don’t want to hear this. You’ve got bigger problems.”
“Make me,” Steve says, without much heat, the lazy, take-it-or-leave-it innuendo that’s so rare with him. Tony rolls his eyes and playacts wrapping the bandages over his mouth instead of his arm.
“Thor will deal with Amora. You know he always does. Tony’s unharmed; we’ll leave the door open and someone will find him in no time.”
So, Steve, in his fantasy, blushes that same faint red, shakes his head. “I’m not going to—“ he says, but all of them know he’s absolutely going to, that he’s already halfway on his knees, and then—
One night, he thinks he’s missing a daisy, but he never gets anything back. It’s that night that he dreams of flying. He’s soaring so high in the air that the lit-up buildings below look like nothing but little white and gold dots, swooping in and out of wet, white clouds. Somehow, none of it can touch him; he’s separated from the world around him by thick slabs of metal, comfortably tucked away inside.
“I know,” Steve says, setting a hand on the chestplate, “well, not the scarred bit, I didn’t know that, but— you built it when you built the suit, right?”
Natasha picks up Tony’s hand, fiddling with the little ring around his pinkie finger, pulling it off to see how it fits her own, much smaller, hands. She’s bored, and a bored Natasha is a recipe for disaster.
He realizes that he wants the team to see this part of him, wants them to know what he’d kept so close to his chest for months now. He hasn’t told his twin brother or any of the women he’s taken home, but these near-strangers are men he’ll perhaps one day die with.
“You know my limits. I know the safeword. If this wasn’t meant for emotional catharsis, Cap, I don’t know what the point is.”
He doesn’t make a big deal of it. Tony Stark is nothing if not effortless charm — the disinterested air of a playboy comes to him as easily as breathing. He waits for Rogers to talk to him first, and waits, and waits, and waits.
Thor’s voice is gentle, like he expects it to be, a little mournful but understanding. Steve, on the other hand, is harder to pin down. His mouth screws up, the scowl almost disapproving, like he’s about to tell Tony’s cancer cells to man up and do better. “Is this a joke? One of those ironic things I never seem to get?”
Steve stares at the writing, confused and overwhelmed. For the first time, he has solid proof that there’s someone out there for him, that he’d been meant to have a soulmate after all. He’s talked to her, exchanged words.
He’ll have a perfect handprint on his skin the next morning, he thinks, a sharp purple bruise he’ll feel sitting down. He shivers at the thought.
“In the nature of total honesty,” Steve says, and Tony feels his stomach sink. This is the part, he’s sure, where things go horribly wrong. “I thought it was Iron Man.”
Steve is going to have to understand, right? The heart failure, the secret identity, the impossible to balance intersection of his two lives, it’ll all speak for itself. Steve will know why he’d had to keep the secret, why he’d avoided him.
Both of them know that Tony is in the position to do the talking, which rankles Steve more than it should.
“She must be trying to hide it,” Steve says, reassuring, “maybe she’s with someone. Maybe she panicked. It doesn’t mean she doesn’t want you, son.”
Steve stares up at him, one eyebrow raised. He’s receptive, in an amused kind of way. He’s also huge — his shoulders alone nearly fill the space between seats, the outline of his back visible even through his blazer. Three hundred and fifty pounds of superhuman muscle, and he’s on his knees in Tony’s limo, waiting patiently to be allowed to suck Tony’s dick.
“I don’t think even a licensed psychiatrist could navigate the emotional ramifications of that foursome, darling,” he says, sliding down on the couch to get his head into her lap.
“I told you I’d say the time and place,” Tony’s annoyed Steve isn’t keeping up with his train of thought. What’s not to get? “‘Cos you owe me.”
Tony glanced back once to his Steve, and stuck his hand out, uncertainly, for a handshake. “Fourteen years, old friend,” he said, and for a moment, Steve heard someone else in his voice, someone closer to him. He couldn’t place it, couldn’t say who, and so he stuck his hand out and shook Tony’s firmly.
Numbly, he reaches over and helps Steve undo the strap on his ankle. Steve pulls off his blindfold in the exact same fluid, wide gesture he uses to pull off his cowl.
Steve reaches down and palms him, rough. It’s too much, too hard; Tony gasps and flinches away from the touch. Steve glances up, annoyance at the interruption written into his features, and Tony feels a thrill of fear shoot up his spine.
He was pale, breathing heavily. Steve’s heart pounded desperately against his ribs, relief and worry mingling. “Ow,” he muttered, and rolled off Steve.
He sees himself on his knees, sees Steve grabbing his hair, pulling, slamming, sees Steve picking him up and fucking him, sloppy and unprepared and painful, almost splitting him in two. He sees Steve hitting him with his full strength, leaving Tony feeling nothing but pain, and he likes the thought, wants it.
Tony feels orgasm coming on so suddenly he near misses the time to pull back, and comes in spurts over Steve’s face, fine white lines clinging to his lips, his stubble, his cheeks, his eyelashes. Steve’s a gorgeous mess, his chin covered in shiny, bubbling drool, his eyes a little bloodshot, dark.
They waited until they heard future-Steve’s footsteps on the stairs, followed by the level whirring of the elevator.
And there he is, now, with Amora, with that same easy smile, like he’s charmed to meet her. Fake smiles aren’t supposed to reach your eyes, but Steve has long noticed that Tony’s do.
Part of him almost misses the fight. In the heat of the moment, he had found no time for the idle suicidal ideation, for the slow counting of days. He had felt alive, and he’d wanted, desperately, to stay that way.
This is what she always says. That’s what his parents have maintained ever since Tony had been told enough to ask about the markings.
Are they expecting him to give a speech? What can he say to them? How can he presume to tell Barton, right now, how to feel about what she had been.
“Don’t be a spoilsport, Rogers.” Natasha says, her annoyance showing. She holds her liquor remarkably well; Tony wouldn’t be able to tell, if he didn’t know, that she’d been drinking at all. “We already stopped poker for you.”
“Are you alright?” Steve asks him, one hand on the side of his face, his thumb pressing into Tony’s skin just under his eye. “What’s going on?”
Steve trains in the gym with Iron Man, who warms up gradually to him but never takes off the mask, never talks personal details. He makes friends with the whole team, charmed by the Wasp, easily pals with Giant-Man, appreciative of Thor’s combat and easy camaraderie, but, slowly, he and Iron Man grow closest of all. They fight together easily on the battlefield, naturally cognizant of each others’ strengths and weaknesses, getting the same ideas at the same times, keenly aware when the other is in danger.
out of the library. That was the first time he’d run into it, the avoidance, the way his mother had picked the book up and frowned, told him he’d better return it. Steve, who’d already blown through the book and found nothing in it but the slightly discomforting story of an evil painting, in which he’d liked absolutely nobody, still remembered the strange confusion, the unease.
He makes a mental note to find out the man’s name and give him a raise and hangs up without saying goodbye.
He’s suffocating. The car is big but not in a way that shows on the inside; it’s all long, narrow hull and heavy bulletproofing. The seats smell of new leather, over processed. Tony Stark’s cologne mixes unpleasantly with the chemicals.
Steve settles, tracking Amora and Tony as they go their separate ways. Tony’s small talk is manufactured, predictable. Amora always seems surrounded by a cluster of people, her melodic laugh occasionally piercing through the crowd. Steve wonders what her end goal is — can it be as simple as luring Thor in, revealing his human identity? Has she not been able to guess where she could find him in the vast city he’s been calling home, choosing to search for the prince among the wealthy and powerful?
“I’m so sorry,” he says, and he activates the nanites in her brain and bloodstream, the ones he’d injected to give her control of his suits.
He flies slower with Steve in his arms, but it’s still not long before he’s back on his bed, answering hurried emails from the PR team, and Steve is in his shower. The anxiety hasn’t faded. It’s a litany of the little things playing on repeat in his head:
“If you don’t, who else will?” Asks the soldier already pulling the suit upright to recharge, and in the end, it’s that simple.
He allows himself to be pulled under Steve’s heavy, muscled arm, leans into his side. Steve picks the channel — he’s the one in this partnership with strong opinions on late night TV — and, for a while, they settle into comfortable, tired silence. Tony doesn’t quite sleep — he’s still too tightly wound, too worried about any possible complications of whatever Steve had been hit with— but he drifts.
“You’re a real gentleman.” Steve smiles, still looking up at him. He has dimples when he smiles. Tony reaches down and pushes his finger into a dimple, imagines digging in with his nails until he breaks skin. This night could end there, with his nails tearing up Steve’s face.
If Tony’s a little bit in love with him, if sometimes the rare boyish grin leaves him lightheaded, if he’s started saving notes Steve leaves him if they so much as hint at affection (“Last night was nice, gone for lunch with B & G, looking forward to dinner - SR”), if he’s at the point of being able to picture Steve’s body the moment he closes his eyes, that’s his own problem.
“Does it make it better or worse if I say I put this together before we met?” Tony asks, gesturing expansively to the room around him. “It’s not all that weird to make shrines for dead people.”
“Really?” Steve spins the helmet on one finger, but Tony thinks his eyes aren’t on it.“I was thinking of you more as a kind of friendly ghost.”
“You’ll see me again,” Tony said, giving him a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Fourteen years, if I don’t find a way back sooner.”
Though if he had one, he thinks, he’d treat her right. She’d be special to him, and he’d take her out dancing, and he’d draw her, he thinks, and he’d—
Strangely, this seemed more intimate to Steve than it would have been had they really gone into the bedroom.
Of course, he’d met vets like that before, kids who’d joined the army at eighteen and come home having lived too much for twenty-three, but he can’t make the mold fit around Captain America, who seems to radiate self-confidence and experience, whose image and name had been used to convey strength and power for decades. It’d be like feeling older than George Washington or Abe Lincoln.
Steve’s watching the television. Tony nudges him lightly with his big toe, and asks, playing at a casual voice, “What’d you lie about?”
He can’t tell if Steve’s tense or if it’s just the the position he’s forced his arms into. He’s perfectly still, not responsive, and Tony doesn’t know if it’s the ropes or something else.
“Mr. Stark isn’t as much of a snob as he says he is,” Iron Man had told him, “I’m sure he’d love to have something like that.” He had sounded like he believed it, and at the time, it’d been easy to agree.
And then he realizes that it’s only Jarvis. He needs to play it cool — if Jarvis sees the gun, she’s going to kill him. She’s not taking any risks.
Steve shakes his hands out and reaches up, setting a hand on Iron Man’s cheek. It’s soft and warm and he can’t believe he’s touching it, that he gets to do this. Iron Man straddles his lap, his muscular thighs on either side of Steve’s hips.
He picks a shrimp up on his way to over to Rogers, rolling the skewer between thumb and index finger. Cap doesn’t need to be told to pay attention; his eyes are immediately on Tony, assessing. Sauce dribbles down the shrimp’s segmented, insectoid body, pools around the edges of Tony’s fingernail.
“You’re Sherlock—“ Tony hiccups, which, for some reason, makes him sneeze. “— fucking Holmes, over here. Listen, the time’s now and the place is here.”
Steve turns on the television. Tony catches his eye and swings his feet onto the couch, his soles pressed against Steve’s warm, firm thighs.
The Wasp, at least, was good at her assigned job; the ballroom of the mansion, which they had chosen for their party space, was decorated in impeccable style. Thor was arranging store-bought finger foods messily on plates and pouring glasses of mead on one side and orange juice on the other. Giant Man, Hawkeye, and the twins, none of them trusted with anything else, had shown up.
Steve pushes into him too slow, and then moves sudden and fast. Overwhelmed, Tony closes his eyes and lets the sensations wash over him in waves. Steve knows his body, pushes in hard, deep, hitting against the sweet spot almost each stroke. His thighs ache, jostled each time Steve’s skin brushes against them. Steve’s hand, rough, is on his cock. Steve’s hand, gentle and familiar, cups his hipbone.
A group of people pass, all women in long cocktail dresses, most of them startling shades of red or blue, blocking out Steve’s view of the conversation.
Tony glances Rogers’s blue-clad back up and down, thoughtful, remembers the way he’d broken out of the medical facilities only a week earlier. The Cap suit,
Steve makes a choked up noise that Tony feels, and, impossibly, comes down further, his nose millimeters away from pressing against Tony’s balls. His hand finds purchase on Tony’s ankle and squeezes.
Steve pushes himself up, wincing at the pain in his chest, and reaches over to pull away the cloth. “’S it bad?”
If it was Iron Man, Steve thinks he’d want to talk through it, crack a joke, even. Tony’s business-like tone of voice leaves no room for that. He sounds in control. He must know. He must realize this is likely to be a trap.
He beckons them over to the table, where Jarvis pours all of them wine. He notices a slight hesitation before Rogers takes his, the uncertainty of a man who doesn’t want to be rude. He lets it go. The bigger matter at hand is goading Thor onto their official team roster.
Steve stares him down, his expression bemused, and then, seemingly deciding not to fight it, takes a long sip of his Coke.
The man smiles, pulling something of out his pocket. Steve squints, and then frowns, recognizing his cell phone. “He’s here. You asked to meet.”
She’s keeping him alive for a reason. Maybe if he can talk to her, get her to see sense — if he can tap into the part of her that must love him, still, because she hasn’t gone so far as to kill him.
He wants Steve here, with him, but he also wants Steve angry at him, wants to feel the strange, empty comfort of feeling hated.
He straps the shield over his arm, pulls up his boot, tries hard to summon adrenaline which just won’t come. Unreality surrounds him from all sides. He feels like his point of view has been pushed back further, like a thick slab of glass has been inserted between his brain and his surroundings.
you, Tony. I can’t imagine how much more this would have stung if you’d been a perfect stranger, someone with a family tucked away somewhere in the suburbs who was being paid to keep me company. You
He’s going to have to blindfold Steve, he thinks, to give himself a little bit more time to figure out what the hell he’s doing. His practical brain is working, at least, where his sexy brain is failing.
He doesn’t think he’s been taken to make some kind of point, that this is political. He hasn’t been roughed up nearly enough. There’s no symbolic ripping of his tie, no blood dripped artistically onto his hands. It’s possible this’ll come later, but there’s something practical, matter of fact, about the way that this man holds his clipboard.
He wonders how many people in the team feel the same, spies working with legends, scientists on the same team as gods, a soldier from a long-gone war fighting alongside a machine made to level tanks. Everyone but Thor is probably in a position to feel a little insecure about themselves, and Thor’s a talented guy. Tony’s sure he’ll manage to find something.
They have to give him their names several times before anything sticks. Wasp. Bucky’s gone. Bucky had fallen, and there’s nothing left of him. He hadn’t had a serum to keep him alive. He must be alive. Bucky must be alive, but he can’t be. Giant-Man. He doesn’t trust them. Thor. They’d won the war. They were going to win the war. Iron Man. The robot is called Iron Man.
He’s not on the Avengers anymore. He’s not Cap. He’s Commander Rogers, charged with taking care of a country he barely understands anymore. And, now, by the invitation of his once-best-friend, once-worst-enemy, he’s on the Illuminati.
in the morning, having left behind nothing but an apologetic note about his work remaining unfinished, some kind of emergency call back, and Tony sits on the edge of his bed and misses him, like a dumbass.
Cap likes Iron Man, sure, likes the idealized, invulnerable front that Tony has poured so much of his heart into creating. If Iron Man was Captain America’s soulmate, there wouldn’t be any issues.
The next morning, Steve received a message from JARVIS telling him that he believed that the Mandarin was at a base in Miami. Steve and Thor headed out immediately. When they arrived at the mansion, they were surprised to find Tony, walking in a banged-up Iron Man suit, and Rhodey, also banged up, but without a suit. Steve smiled, relieved that they were both alright.
“You have nothing to apologize for. Really, Tony. I, uh, just… I want you to know that I’m not picking Bucky over you. I’m not. And if other me did, he was an idiot.” Steve realized abruptly that he and Tony were standing really close. His whole body felt electrified. He swore he could feel the heat from Tony’s body. He swallowed hard, opening his mouth to continue talking before realizing he couldn’t think of a single thing to say. He closed his mouth, licked his lips, and watched Tony’s eyes track the movement.
Steve smiled. “I do like my StarkPhone. I’ve always found that Stark tech is the best. Howard was an ass, but he was a brilliant ass. I also like how far things have come in terms of equality. I mean there’s still a long way to go, from what I understand, but there’s been a lot of progress. It’s nice that I wouldn’t have to have a big fight with the brass to lead an integrated unit. And women in the army! I’m sure Peggy loves that. She had a tougher time than she should’ve.”
and Steve rushed to pull it out of his pocket. “I take it that’s the actual Iron Man?” Steve read the incoming text.
“Steve,” Natasha said slowly. “I was thinking. We’ve been treating Hydra and Bucky as two separate issues. What if they’re not? What if Zola didn’t just have the serum, but an actual test subject? What if Hydra has control of the Winter Soldier?”
The grief was piercing this time, strong enough that he had to shut his eyes against it and didn't see Natasha's eyes widen and then narrow at the picture. "That's Bucky Barnes. James Buchanan Barnes. He's – was – my best friend."
“I refuse to accept Jim as a substitute for Rhodey. But yeah, sure. If he hadn’t already figured it out, sure, I told him. What does that have to do with Aunt Peggy?”
Natasha raised one eyebrow, but Tony responded first. “Yeah, that sounds like Aunt Peggy.” Steve jolted a little and looked at Tony, who was not looking back. He supposed it was reasonable the Howard and Peggy had stayed close after the war, but he hadn’t thought about it in terms of Tony.
Clint’s jaw dropped open, Natasha’s eyes narrowed, and Thor just looked confused. Bruce was the one who actually asked, “I’m sorry, Hydra? I thought they were wiped out in World War 2.” His eyes flickered between Tony and Steve. “When Steve crashed the plane into the ocean and defeated the Red Skull.”
God but she was brilliant. "Well, to be fair, they probably don't know my senses are heightened. I also wanted to ask you if you still knew anyone at SHIELD that you're absolutely sure of."
Trip took his hand, eying him a little suspiciously. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but has anyone hugged you this century? Because you look like you could seriously use a hug.”
Fury, on the other hand, did not crack a smile. “Well, I suppose that’s alright for now. I’d like you to get started training with Romanoff. You’re strong and you’ve got a lot of practical fighting experience, but that’s not always going to be enough. You can train here or at Stark’s. The team is your first priority. You make it clear to Stark that he should appreciate you fighting his battles for him.”
Steve liked listening to Tony explain new tech. He was less enthusiastic about whatever music Tony had put on. It was fine, but it didn’t really resonate with him. He hoped Clint’s music was better. As they went on, he realized how useful the phone was going to be. He could look things up in real-time, instead of making a list of things to ask about later. For the second time, Steve’s time with Tony was interrupted by a stranger barging into the lab.
“Is there something I can do for you, Tony?” Steve asked with a wry grin, trying to push the breakfast plate at Tony.
"Maybe she wouldn't have been involved, but a lot of people would've given almost anything for the chance at the serum, Steve." Bruce looked ashamed. Thor, sensing his discomfort, clapped him on the shoulder, but said nothing.
“That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve some happiness, Cap. I know you lost a lot, and moving on from that has to be a monumental task. But there are good things about you being here, now, not the least of which is the fact that you could actually make a real life with a man you love. Just think about it.
“Sure.” He flipped to the picture he had (luckily) been working on the day before. It showed the six of them on movie night: Nat and Clint intertwined on the loveseat, Bruce tucked into an armchair, Thor sprawled across one couch with a huge bowl of popcorn in his lap, Tony and Steve on the other couch looking at each other and laughing.
Steve made the leap. "It was never about worthy, Nat. It was about loyalty. Yours to Fury runs deep, deeper than the rest of us. I knew I needed to be able to give you a good reason for loyalty to us to come first. Your story today happened to fit that requirement. I don't know if you've noticed," he couldn't help the smile; Natasha noticed everything, "but I'm not exactly the warrior stoic type. It probably seemed a little odd to you that I could tell you exactly what Bucky meant to me one minute, and then have virtually no reaction to your big reveal. I knew Bucky was still alive. I found out yesterday, from future me." He went through the whole story – minus the details of his future self's big reveal – and waited for her reaction.
"You always did know me better than anyone but Bucky. Alright, yes, I need something. I'm working with SHIELD now and I have some… concerns. I know you helped found it, which is one of the things that's kept me there, but… maybe I should back up a little. I've been working with a team. They're amazing – you'd like them. Actually, you do like one of them. I work with Tony Stark."
“Damn. I’m not sure what else we can do here or how to find Tony. It’ll be dark soon, so I guess Thor and I will go back to the quinjet and get some sleep. No point in coming all the way back to New York if it ends up being around here. Hopefully Tony will get in touch soon. At least we know he’s alright. Or he was when he left here.”
Dozens of emotions passed over Trip’s face, too quickly for Steve to decipher. “Garrett? Are you sure?”
Bruce was nodding as soon as Steve got the words out. “Go, I’ll figure it out. Keep your comms on. Let me know when you find him.”
Steve could hear Tony pause and parse his words as he watched Natasha silently raise one eyebrow at him. “Wow, you got to her this fast? Color me impressed, Cap. Guess batting those big blue eyes is more effective than I would’ve thought. Can’t wait for the story on that. Over and out, Rogers.”
Over the next couple of weeks, Steve kept mostly to himself, although he did spend plenty of time at the SHIELD gym. He watched both versions of
Steve immediately pushed himself to a seated position. “He’s a year older than me,” he whispered. “Oh my God, they have Bucky!”
Steve blinked. Matched him. Not Loki. “Might as well, I suppose. Please, go ahead JARVIS.” A voice that sounded just like his rang out in the room.
“We don’t need anything from Fury,” Tony corrected. “I’ve tapped into all of SHIELD’s records. Figured it would be faster. JARVIS, put together a list of teams that are not currently at a major SHIELD facility and are also led by Hydra.”
"She and Coulson have been tight for a long time. She was temporarily working a desk job after an op went bad, but she's one of the best field agents in SHIELD. She's also 100% loyal to Coulson. She would know the difference," said Natasha.
JARVIS interrupted, “Perhaps a drink is inadvisable, sir, given what took place in the lobby.” It might’ve been Steve’s imagination, but that seemed a little pointed. He was curious about what might’ve happened in the lobby, but Tony didn’t seem inclined to share. He just huffed and gestured Steve to a chair. Although Tony sat, he continued to tinker with whatever he was holding. He didn’t seem to be able to hold himself still.
Thor looked alarmed and opened his mouth to speak, but Steve cut him off. "Go. Figure out what's going on. Do you need help? Someone can come with you."
America’s ass,” while looking at the prone form of current Steve. Four of them swiveled to stare at him while Tony laughed helplessly.
Steve frowned at that. “You called Jim?” He didn’t think he’d managed to keep the hurt from his voice, at least not if the wince on Rhodey’s face was any indication.
“Wait, so if he’s really from the future, shouldn’t him telling you shit mess everything up?” Clint asked. “Wouldn’t he change things enough so that he never comes back? But then he wouldn’t tell you and things would go back. Now I’m confused.”
He found himself sketching more and more, mostly pictures of Bucky and Peggy with the rest of the Howling Commandos sprinkled in, but eventually, he started trying to sketch his new team. He didn’t know them as well, so they mostly remained vague outlines. He hadn’t realized how much he wanted the Avengers to become his new Howling Commandos. He would never want to replace the amazing men he had served with, but he knew he wasn’t really meant to be an island. He’d spent most of his life with just Bucky and his mother, then most of what was left with just Bucky, but the time he’d had with the Commandos had made him happy, despite the horrors of what was going on around them. That was the first time in his life he’d felt he really belonged anywhere, and it came from leading a team. SHIELD had already told him that they were all dead, but he knew that when he was a little less raw about it, he’d want more information about how they’d lived. He wanted to know what they’d done and whether they had families. Maybe he’d even see if he could meet some of their families and hear about them from a more personal source.
“I’d like to be involved in your illustrious organization. Learn a little more about your plans. Who your assets are. That sort of thing. I’ve gotta tell you, I’ve found that a lot about the future is… let’s say in need of reorganization.” Pierce didn’t have to know that Steve really meant the government who let people be homeless and go without healthcare or decent working conditions or basic human rights. He heard Natasha’s voice in his head.
Steve heard a lot that Tony didn't say. Never once had he called Howard his father. Of the three deaths, he'd only responded to Edwin's. Howard had apparently talked about him enough that Edwin refused to. He took a shot. "That's funny. No offense, but I always liked Edwin a lot more than Howard. Don't get me wrong, he was brilliant, and he helped me out a lot, but I never really… connected with him."
“How else could Bucky have survived the fall from the train? I find him on a table in Zola’s lab, and then suddenly, he survives a fall that should have – no doubt about it – killed him.” He closed his eyes for a moment to swallow back his grief. “If there had been any chance – any chance at all – that he could’ve survived that fall, I would’ve gone back for him. I left him there. And he got taken and turned into the Winter Soldier.”
Steve smiled at Tony and watched as he was rolled into a waiting ambulance. After the doors closed, Bucky sighed and said, “You have less game than anyone I’ve ever met.”
Since this is my first fic, I don't have a lot of experience with tagging. I'm adding stuff as I think of it, but let me know if you see anything you think I should add to the tags!
“Yeah, Romanoff is definitely the snitch of the group. Maybe we release information a little at a time. Start with what seems like Mickey-Mouse stuff. I’m not great at undercover, myself, so I’ll probably have to stick pretty close to the truth,” Steve grimaced a little. “Actually – and trust me the irony isn’t lost on me here – how much did you get from the SHIELD computers when you were on board? Is there any reason that you can see for us not to trust them?”
“Steven. My boss is the CEO of SI. Who did you think her best friend named Tony was?” she rolled her eyes and hopped off the counter. “James, deal with him. I’m going to go take a bubble bath.”
He sagged into the passenger seat of the car where Natasha was waiting for him. “I texted Fury a meetup time from my burner phone along with a code so he knows it’s me. And I talked to Tony. He said you did well and not to feel guilty about what you said about him.”
Clint laughed. “Nah, man. That’s just her way of bonding. As far as she knows, the great love of your life is Peggy Carter. That’s how all the stories go. The published ones, anyway. The conspiracy theory stories say that the great love of your life is Bucky Barnes.” He glanced at Steve out of the corner of his eye. “Anyway, it takes a lot to overcome that much prior information about a subject. Plus you’re used to hiding that you’re gay. I wouldn’t have picked it up. You never check anyone out.”
“Shall I take that to mean that you’re not going to help me convince Stark to build the new helicarriers?”
Steve blinked. "Are you telling me that Gabe's grandson is SHIELD?" He grinned over at Tony. "Maybe I should pay him a visit."
In contrast to Tony’s quiet agreement, Natasha looked delighted. “Well, well, well. You surprise me, солнце
Steve continued hitting the heavy bag. “Little one, yeah. What about you? Got time for a beer after your workout?” He and Natasha had discussed this. Keep working out. Make it casual. Use the exertion to hide any tells there might be. Steve could see Rumlow smirk out of the corner of his eye.
“Mr. Stark is in his workshop, and he is willing to speak with you there. Please follow the highlighted path.” As he spoke, lights sprang to life along the hall floors.
“He has to do it,” Natasha argued. “They can’t know that we know they’re Hydra. If he would’ve done it for SHIELD, he has to do it now.”
"Oh it does, and when you're done talking, we have plenty that we'd like to share. But you're at something of a trust deficit in this room, Natalie, so you get to start." Despite her excellent and almost immediate recovery, Steve could tell he'd scored a point. He may not be a spy or a good liar, but he had plenty of experience reading people, and in his day, reading things wrong usually got him beaten to a pulp.
Tony took the wrench out of his mouth and wiped his hands on a rag before taking his plate and looking askance at the water. “Fine. Why wouldn’t it be fine?” Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “Okay, it’s not fine, but I don’t wanna talk about it. Talk about something else. I’ll update you on my search for Barnes instead. Or hey! I have an invasive personal question. I’ve been wondering something since I found out you were gay.” Steve choked a little on his water. This was not going where he’d expected. “Was Barnes… I mean were you and Barnes… I mean he seems so important to you.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Tony said, turning to Steve. “You don’t look surprised. Why aren’t you surprised? I feel like you’re taking this warrior-stoic thing too far. This is shocking. And terrible. There are Hydra members inside SHIELD. Be more surprised, please.”
“Well hello there Steve the firefighter,” came a flirty voice over the phone. “I would love to get dinner with you on Saturday. I thought you’d never ask.”
“Oh. Well. I guess I didn’t really figure you guys would want to come. You’ve already got your special SHIELD-sanctioned rooms. I’m sure they’re very… symmetrical.”
Steve smiled at JARVIS’s dry humor, which he was starting to get used to in a machine. “Stick with me for a bit, will you JARVIS? Thanks.”
"No. From what she says, I may have to return to Asgard, and I would not take you away from your duties here. If I go there, I will have help enough."
each other. From here on out, this team comes first. And Bruce, at some later point in time, I’d appreciate it if you could fill me in on these companies who try to cheat honest workers out of benefits.” Clint snickered, but Steve ignored him. “Now, Tony, what did Fury want you to make?”
After he hung up with Pepper, Tony turned to Steve. “Okay, so the spy twins are going to Malibu, apparently. Do you have plans for the rest of us, oh fearless leader?”
The next day, the whole team gathered, except Thor, who was still off-world. Steve cleared his throat. "There's not a good way to say this, I don't think, and certainly not any way I can come up with, so I'm going to just say it, and then you can ask whatever questions you like. So as you all know, Tony has been digging into SHIELD's personnel records, following up on what Nat and Clint suggested about recruiting agents. He, uh, decided to start with anyone recruited by Coulson, and he discovered that Coulson's most recent recruit was after New York. After the chitauri. After he was supposedly killed. Tony brought this to me first, because he wasn't sure if it was possible. We went to check it out. Phil Coulson is alive." He paused when Clint dropped the glass he was holding. Natasha immediately put her hand on Clint's thigh, trying to comfort him, but she didn't look any steadier than him. Bruce sank wordlessly onto the chair. "The records were classified at level 7, which means that at least Nat, Clint, and I should have had access. Based on your reactions, I'm guessing you weren't briefed either. Someone decided we weren't need to know. I'm not any happier about that than I'd guess you are. I'm sorry we didn't tell you right away, but I know how much he meant to Nat and Clint, and I didn't want to get your hopes up if this was a mistake. We asked him to come out so we could brief him on the Hydra problem. He should be here in an hour or so."
“No promises. There’s an awful lot of traffic for a Sunday morning. But don’t worry, our exit is coming up next, we’ll get you to the church on time.”
“Now we just have to figure out how to get messages to the non-Hydra members of those teams,” Rhodey said. He turned to Natasha and Clint. “Who would you always believe if they sent you a message?”
“First, I’m fine for you to tell Agent May. If Clint and Natasha sign off, that’s good enough for me. We’ve asked Clint, Natasha, and Sharon Carter – Peggy’s niece – to put together lists of people they trust without question and people they suspect as Hydra. Tony’ll plug the information into whatever fancy model he comes up with and we’ll go from there. Natasha is also going to try to teach me to go undercover.” Steve made a face. “Thanks to future-me, they all think I’m Hydra, so I’m apparently a built-in spy. Right now we’re just at fact-finding, but if my lack of hailing is discovered, we could shift to fight mode pretty quickly. We’d like you to be ready.”
“Yeah, apparently Hill evaluated him for Coulson’s team. She gave him top marks for combat and the best espionage score since Romanoff.” He paused to raise an eyebrow at Natasha. “Apparently he doesn’t have great social skills though, because she drew… something spiky next to his personality profile.”
“Okay, but you stay behind me,” Steve ordered. As they approached, they watched Tony eject himself from one armor and dive into another. Steve jumped into the fray, letting Tony bounce his repulsors off of his shield, using the shield to knock Killian back, but seeing that his own weapons wouldn’t be enough to kill him. Even when Tony encased Killian in the Mark 42 and had JARVIS blow it, Killian just emerged from the fiery pit with his skin knitting itself back together. Steve had been thrown back by the blast and watched, horrified, as Killian stalked toward Tony. Then, out of nowhere, Pepper appeared and hit Killian with a wooden beam, then kicked a missile toward him and blew it up with a repulsor she’d taken from one of Tony’s broken suits. Both men just stared at her.
Steve and Bruce exchanged a look. "Well I'm going to get back to looking over Jane's data. It's fascinating stuff."
“Yeah, that’s fair, but I gotta say, I don’t think getting attacked by the secretary was really Steve’s fault,” Clint said.
“And you trust me? Man, no wonder your friends had to go all superspy on me. You need a keeper. Say I agree to this. What happens then? I just quit my job, move to New York, sit around and wait for the world to explode?”
As the paramedics loaded Tony onto the backboard, he got his first real look at Steve. “Wow, are all firefighters as pretty as you?”
“No, he hooked up with some kid, left the suit with him to reboot, and stole the car of one of the people who was on fire. Do you think JARVIS could find him?”
him. He liked some of them better than others but made the same polite small talk with everyone. After Natasha had left for the day, he usually kept pretty much to himself. He'd put in his headphones and run or destroy some punching bags. He knew he'd be going on missions with many of these agents sooner or later, but he wanted to solidify his team first, and he wasn't even close. One February day, he was in the locker room putting his stuff back together and one of his least favorite agents approached him. They were alone in the locker room when he greeted Steve. "Hey Cap. How are things? Making progress with everything you've got going on?"
A few minutes later, the ambulances arrived. Steve could hear Clint giving them the run-down of what had happened as they came over. “Okay, the paramedics are here. They’re going to get neck braces on you and get you transported to the hospital. They’ll take good care of you.”
“Steve, you’ve watched me build dozens of suits over the last six months. Lucky for you, they have a remote access feature, now that I’ve connected back to JARVIS. They’ll meet us there.”
Steve just grinned and let them fight it out. His mood was great, until he felt the car tilt and pull to the side. Damn, he really meant to replace the tires yesterday. He put his blinker on and pulled to a stop in the breakdown lane. Oh well, it was an easy enough fix. Even if he’d been alone, it wouldn’t have taken him long, but the four of them had worked together at the firehouse for so long that they were a well-oiled machine. Without a word, they all got out of the car. He popped the trunk and walked around the front to take a look. As they got things going, he saw a car pull off pretty far in front of them. He chuckled. Nice to see that there were still good Samaritans out there, even if this one overshot and the four firefighters didn’t really need any help.
“What can I do for you, Cap? I thought everyone had bailed. No SHIELD debriefing to attend or search and rescue to organize?”
“Agreed,” Natasha said. “We’ll give you our full list. We also have to make your algorithm a little smarter.” Tony looked affronted, but didn’t interrupt. “While we don’t recruit assets for SHIELD, it’s my job to assess people and figure out the best way to get them to do what I want. What you need to understand is that people don’t usually apply to work for SHIELD. They’re recruited and then subjected to a rigorous battery of psych evals. In order to get new Hydra agents within SHIELD, either people are targeted for recruitment
“Trusted,” Clint corrected, voice tighter than Steve had ever heard it. “Past tense. I’m not sure if I’m ready to upgrade it to present.” He narrowed his eyes. “How
Steve dove in immediately, telling Tony all about the fight with the other Steve, learning that Bucky was alive, losing the fight, and waking up with the scepter returned. He paused. “Now, here’s where things get odd. The man I fought, he wasn’t Loki in disguise. At least, not according to JARVIS. JARVIS says that this man most closely matched me, and he played me a message that he recorded. He says he’s me from the future. He… he knew things he couldn’t have known otherwise. Things I’d never told anyone. And then he said he only had one piece of advice. He told me to trust you. The rest of the team, too, but you first, and that I need to deserve your trust. He said our team could be amazing. So here I am. Trusting you not to decide I’m crazy. Well, I probably am crazy, but this part is true.”
Thor skipped the shopping but met them at Natasha’s, which was homier than Steve expected. Despite the weapons case against the wall, which he suspected was only a part of her stash, the whole room seemed warm and welcoming. It threw Steve's own place into sharp relief. Though he had no visible weapons in his apartment, it lacked every feel of home. It had been decorated by someone else in a poor facsimile of the '40s, and he hated every inch of it.
Rumlow just laughed and shoved the guy off. “My orders come from higher up than you, Kaminsky. Captain America is welcome here. He’s our oldest living member. Well, top five anyway.” Steve watched as Kaminsky’s eyes widened and filed that away to analyze later with the team. What living members of Hydra could be older than
Once they were settled in the back seat and on their way, their driver smiled back at them in the rearview mirror.  “So, are you here for a romantic weekend?”
Steve about jumped out of his skin, whirling at the sound of Tony Stark’s voice.  “Mr. Stark--Tony, I didn’t--shouldn’t you be at the Draft?”
Sharon laughed.  “That’s true enough.  Romo was proof of that.  Ticketing holds I think one or two tickets in that section for everyone on the final roster once the season starts; in case you get a girlfriend.  They don’t want you to be caught out wanting to bring her to a game and there’s no seat.”
“Operation Paperclip,” Natasha said. “After World War 2, SHIELD and other government agencies would have recruited German scientists with… strategic value.”
Steve leaned against the wall of the elevator. When he arrived on the common floor, he allowed himself to follow his instincts and just face plant on the couch.
It was Tony’s turn to frown. “You sure you can’t stay, Platypus? I’m sure we could convince Cap to let you join the superfriends team. Once we take all the Hammer trash off your suit, you’d be a good addition.”
“So it should be both super soldier and old man proof, but let me know if you have any trouble figuring out how to put it on or anything.” Tony was a whirl of movement now, picking up and putting down various tools and projects. Steve decided that maybe both he and Tony could use a break from the intensity.
“It wasn’t that. Or not just that. Look, Barton came and talked to me. Asked me when I wanted him to leave, because clearly I have issues with people who were brainwashed into murder.”
“I’ll probably head down tonight and put Fury out of his misery tomorrow morning. Rumlow mentioned that he and the rest of STRIKE were being relocated to DC, so hopefully they’ve had plenty of time to relay my interest in a meeting with Pierce.” He saw Tony frown.
“I know he did,” Clint said, softer than before. “I also know a thing or two about crappy parents and wondering if things could’ve been different. You’ve taken a hard hit, here, man. I get that. I also get that it might seem easier to take it out on Steve and Bucky, but I don’t think it’ll help you, and it sure as hell won’t help Bucky, who is still the prisoner of the batshit people who made him do it. You want some catharsis? Take their fucking Fist of Hydra and shove it up their ass.” Clint paused, and Tony couldn’t help it. He burst out laughing. “Damn it, I didn’t mean it to come out like that,” Clint said, but he was laughing, too. “Look, I know that maybe you think things have to be different now, but they don’t. You can still take this, and move forward, and be a goddamn Avenger, and use all that hate to burn Hydra to the ground.”
Natasha frowned thoughtfully. "That's… actually not a terrible idea, Stark. It's always best not to have anyone alive who can contradict your story. But if Schmidt recruited him, how did he figure out that Hydra still exists within SHIELD?"
Tony scoffed, but it was Rhodey who responded. “No, sorry, weapons designed by Justin Hammer. And it’s not like I had a lot of options. They wanted more guns. You don’t make guns anymore. Anyway, I’m happy where I am, but you can always call if you need me. Maybe before the world actually ends next time, okay?” He gave Tony a stern look, then a hug, then waved to everyone and left with Pepper.
“Yeah, well that actually doesn’t surprise me. Stark was forcibly outed as bi in the papers as a teenager. Didn’t go over too well with his pops. Publicly, he’s only been with women since then. Anyway, not to worry. I won’t say anything. Although no one on the team would care. Nat obviously knows about me, Stark is bi, Asgardians don’t seem to care about anyone else’s sexuality except when they’re trying to get in their pants, and I’m pretty sure Bruce considers it the least of his worries. If you ever decide you want to tell people, I got your back. Boy, this is so much better than the conversation I came over here to have. Here, have a burger, we’ll put on a baseball game.”
Bruce cleared his throat. "Jane, would it be alright if I looked over your data? I think it would be great if we could develop a way to track this kind of phenomenon. Especially if Loki is going to be on the other side of it."
Steve was still trying to work out how this could be right. "Hmm? Oh not much. I've really only interacted with Fury, Phil, Nat, and Clint."
“That’s not it! Actually, I think it’s that you remind me so much of Peggy. Peggy Carter,” he clarified for the rest of the room. “She trained me out of stammering at her, especially on the job. She couldn’t afford for anyone to take her less than 100% seriously. She might’ve beaten the lesson into me a little.” Steve rubbed the back of his head with a reminiscent grin, as though he could feel the ghost of a swat. “I’ll admit, taking a punch didn’t usually help me learn any lessons, but Peggy was special, and she’d earned a spot where people took her seriously. Besides, I tried to mostly do what she said after that time she shot at me.”
"Miss Hansen is currently working for a think tank by the name of Advanced Idea Mechanics, which is run by Aldrich Killian. If I may, sir, Miss Potts had a meeting with him a few days ago. He wanted Stark Industries to invest in a project he called Extremis. Miss Potts declined."
“Do you think you can plug in whatever lists Clint and Natasha give you? Give you some more,” Steve took a moment to reach for a Tony-ish way to describe it, “data points for your web?”
The recording stopped and Steve just stood, immobile, wondering what the hell he was going to do now. Well, nowhere to go but forward. “Um, JARVIS? Do you think you could keep the first item on his list to yourself? The proof that he was… me? Boy, that’s odd. I’m going to have to tell the rest of the team that he was here, and what he said about us, but…” Steve took a breath, trying to find the words. It wasn’t like no one had ever known he liked men, but he was pretty sure most of them weren’t in this century.
They kissed for several more minutes until the door banged open. They sprang apart and looked over to see Rhodey staring at them. “Okay, seriously man? I did not need to see that. I just came back down to make sure you were okay, and this is the thanks I get. Also, I told you so.”
“Everyone sit back down. We need details before we can do anything about this. Tony, tell us what you know.”
“You gave me a home in the century, Tony. Not just the tower, although it’s amazing. You let me invade your whole life. You took up the fight for Bucky like it was your own with no questions asked. You spent a whole bunch of time teaching me about modern tech. Hell, you let me sit in your workshop and sketch while you work. I’ve been literally invading your sacred space. I was surviving at SHIELD. Here, I get to actually
Steve could tell Tony was getting agitated, so instead of arguing, he just said “Okay, Tony. I trust your judgment. Tell me what you’re working on.”
"JARVIS confirmed that he wasn't Loki and the things he knew… only I would know that." The palest pink that tinged his cheeks did not go unnoticed by his audience.
“I’m sure he did,” Phil sighed. “Okay, so you’ve established that I’m alive and dazzled my science team. Is there anything else?”
They spent the day making Steve’s apartment livable. Natasha explained credit and debit cards and showed him how to figure out his financial situation. He had more money than he’d ever imagined, but he also knew that everything cost more now. She smirked and told him he’d get used to it, but also helped to steer him towards stores and options that wouldn’t break the bank. They stopped at a little Chinese restaurant for lunch, where Steve ate whatever Natasha ordered for him.
“Very good, Captain. It’s good to see that your mind works the right way. If you’re right, bringing Stark in would be a risk, and it’s not time for the world to know about us yet. Get me the helicarriers and I’ll bring you in. Do you think any of your other little Avengers would be welcoming to our ideas?”
Steve could hear Bucky not even trying to stifle his laughter as Steve turned pink. He was saved from answering by Pepper. “Tony, leave the firefighters who saved us alone! Seriously, thank you so much for all of your help.”
Phil smiled sadly. “It wasn’t my call. Fury said that you weren’t to know, even though your clearance is high enough. I wanted to tell you. Really, I did.”
As he listened to Tony talk, Steve couldn’t help the grin that came over his face. “Tony,” he said very seriously. “Are you telling me that you’re creating a stealth AI that you have named SNEAK?”
"Maybe first we should figure out how Hydra came to exist within SHIELD," Clint suggested. He was visibly restless.
Natasha pulled out a slim box and flashed it at Clint. “Perfect! Great movie, a million references, nothing that should be too touchy. Pop it in!” They settled in, Thor and Steve on the couch, Natasha in an armchair, and Clint stretched out on the floor. Natasha brought out warm, buttery popcorn in pretty cream-colored bowls.
“That’s good advice. I don’t know exactly what we’ll come up with, but we’ll talk about it. Still, we’ll need allies within SHIELD, as well – people who know the players and how things work. I’d appreciate it if you could help us, come up with a list of people you trust without question, maybe people you’re suspicious of. Tony is coming up with some sort of algorithm and the more data points he has, the better he’ll feel about it. Barton and Romanoff are coming up with lists, too. We’ll see where you guys overlap.”
Steve laughed at Tony’s question. “I actually didn’t dress up as a kid. I was Superman at the children’s hospital last Halloween.”
“You can reach me at the Tower at any time. I’m sure JARVIS will be happy to put you through. You reached Stark that way, as I understand it.”
“Sorry, yeah. Everything’s fine. Tony just finished decrypting some Hydra files. I’ll keep you posted on the plan. Thanks for everything over the last few days. I don’t think I knew how much this would mean to me.” Steve stood and held out his hand for Trip to shake.
"Sure, book a hotel room. They'll have recording devices in the lobby, but law prohibits them in the room. Don't book in advance and use a fake name. You'll need a credit card on file for incidentals, but we can work you up one with whatever fake name you like."
“Well. That’s not exactly how I would’ve chosen for you to hear that, but okay. Sure. Why not? Your suit is extremely unflattering. We’ll work on it.”
“Well, it just so happens that I might have some rooms ready that would be appropriate for you and the spy twins. You know. If you wanted.”
Steve continued to run around the monument, and shortly found himself approaching the same man. Again he said, "On your left."
Steve stood frozen for a moment before pulling out his phone, thanking his lucky stars that he'd let Tony work some SHIELD-proofing magic on it. He pulled up the Avengers group chat and sent a message.
Steve blinked. That had sounded almost… flirty? No, that couldn’t be right. He was just kidding. Right? He shook his head and turned to Natasha, who was giving him an assessing look. “I’ll see if I can bump into Rumlow in the gym this week. See if he wants to meet for a beer.” He wrinkled his nose.
is amazing. It has the best characters and good representation and a giant flying bison and the relationships are meaningful. And hands down the best character arc ever. Plus it’s all about a team, which should resonate with the good Captain.”
Steve took a deep breath and entered the room at the nursing home. He could see it was a top-quality kind of a place and wondered whether Tony had anything to do with that. His eyes tracked to the woman in the bed and his heart stilled for a moment before restarting just a little too fast. He cleared his suddenly dry throat. "Hey there, Peggy."
“Sure thing, Cap. Grant Ward was recruited to SHIELD by Garrett. He excelled at the operations branch of SHIELD academy, proved himself on several missions, and was a specialist at SHIELD before he got put on Coulson’s team. That’s all in his personnel record. What isn’t in his record is that he broke out of military school, stole a car, drove home, and lit his house on fire with his older brother inside. Garrett broke him out of prison. In several of his early psych evaluations, he stated that all he really wanted was to be worthy of the faith Garrett had shown in him. He’s definitely Hydra.”
Steve thought through Tony’s suggestions. He noticed that he, Clint, and Natasha were not invited to live in the tower and wondered whether that was because they already had living quarters or because Tony didn’t really want them there. He certainly had reason to distrust Natasha, and it was pretty obvious that she and Clint were a set. Steve knew he’d have his work cut out for him turning this group of six independent, stubborn, mistrustful people into a team. All this flitted through his head so quickly that there was no noticeable pause before he replied, “So Natasha suggested Indian food for dinner if that's okay with you all, and Clint was charged with picking a movie."
She chuckled lightly and held out her hand. "I'm so glad you're here. We have so much to catch up on. It's been so long."
I’m so so sorry it’s been so long. Thank you so much to everyone who commented on the last chapter. It’s the only way I could manage to bring myself back. I developed such a weird block after finishing up the last chapter and couldn’t write anything for weeks. Instead, I played a lot of Animal Crossing lol. And then I got laid off, and I spent the next couple of weeks too overwhelmed to do anything constructive that wasn’t absolutely necessary for life. Good news is that I found a new job!! I won’t be starting until the end of July, so hopefully that means plenty of time to write! Anyway, here it FINALLY is :) As you may have guessed from the title, this chapter is largely about Bucky! I hope you enjoy it!! <3 Stay safe and healthy!
Over the next few months, Steve and Tony talked a lot about everything that happened, and Steve extracted Tony’s promise to always call him when things went sideways (“You have a team now, Tony. That’s what we’re here for.” “Yeah, yeah. Give it a rest, Rogers.”). They continued to spend time together, and Steve convinced Tony to spar with him in the gym in the tower. He still went to the SHIELD gym with Natasha, and he definitely learned more with her, but he much preferred the time spent with Tony.
“You’d be better at it, I think, but hopefully she can make me not terrible. Say, you got to ask me an invasive personal question. Can I ask one in return?”
“Of course, Captain. Mr. Stark is in his lab. Dr. Banner and Thor have not yet returned from their outing. Mr. Barton and Miss Romanoff have not arrived yet.”
Steve was just staring at her, open-mouthed, but Bucky had doubled over laughing. “Tony’s friend Pepper is your boss?” Steve asked in disbelief.
Fury’s face betrayed no emotion. “And what exactly happened yesterday that makes me suddenly trustworthy?”
Hey all, this took a little longer than I wanted - I had a not so great mental health week last week, so writing took a back seat. But we’re back now! Also, I’m not so much a “plan things out in a detailed manner” kind of writer, so I don’t really know how long this is going to be. It’s only been like two days in-story, and we’re at the end of chapter 3. I think things are going to move a little faster after this, once we’ve gotten everyone sort of introduced and settled. I hope you enjoy it! Thanks to everyone who has commented/kudos’d – I really appreciate the encouragement!
"Of course, Sir. The majority of their descendants do not live locally. However, one of the grandsons of Private James Morita lives and works in New York. He is a high school principal in Queens. Sir, it may be of interest to you to know that one of the names, Antoine Triplett, matches that of an agent listed in SHIELD's records. He is the grandson of Private Gabriel Jones."
First, this is so much later than I wanted. I had a really solid idea of how I wanted it to start and how I wanted it to end, but then I had to rewrite the middle a couple of times to get it to fit right. Turns out it's pretty hard to figure out what would happen in the MCU if the Avengers actually talked to each other. On the plus side, it’s almost twice as long as my usual chapters.
They spent the next hour planning both the Hydra takedown and their infiltration of the Hydra base where Bucky was being kept. Eventually, Thor left to check on Jane, Rhodey went to pack, since he was leaving the next day, and Bruce went to check on an experiment he’d left running.
Tony was babbling. Steve wondered how much sleep he’d gotten, but knew he wouldn’t get a straight answer. “Well I hope Natasha really likes him. He’s gonna make a move, and I’d hate for her to kill my first non-Avenger friend.” Steve smiled, wondering if he could convince Tony to eat dinner with him. He was starving and also desperate for non-Hydra company.
Clint cut off his thoughts anyway. "More importantly, who's the soldier?" He gestured at the only other personal item in the apartment: Bucky's photograph.
It seemed that today was a good day. He was glad that this first meeting could be easier. Even though he'd been awake in the new century for nearly a year, seeing Peggy was hard. She was a tangible representation of exactly how much time had passed. He walked over and grabbed her hand. "Actually, Peg, I was hoping to execute a jailbreak. Wanna go on an adventure with me?"
“I apologize for the confusion, Captain. The man who was in this room fighting with you and who both left and returned with the scepter was not Loki. His energy signature did not match that of Loki, even when Loki temporarily created the illusion that he was Captain America preparing to coordinate search and rescue. Indeed, during the time of your fight, Loki’s energy signature was detected in the lobby of the building with Thor and Mr. Stark. The man you fought with most closely resembled you, although he was not an exact match for your energy signature.” There was a brief pause, as if JARVIS was thinking; then, “If I may, Captain, when he returned the scepter, he asked me to record a message for you. Would you like to hear it?”
"I don't know. All I can come up with is that Fury used this to motivate us, to make us a team. He must've known we wouldn't trust him if we found out he lied about this."
“Alright, drink’s on hold for now. I reserve the right to change my mind, depending on what the boy scout has to offer.”
“I’ll give you one. And when I say your team is not cleared to know, I mean none of them, not just below, but no one above you, including Fury.” Steve added. “You know my history better than most, Phil. You know I’m not one for the hierarchy of command. With the Commandos, I kept no secrets from my team, and the Avengers work the same way. For good reason.” He exchanged a glance with Tony. “So you’ll understand that there if I’m asking you for silence, there’s a good reason.” He looked Phil in the eye and waited.
“I thought I had more time, but with your schedule moved up, I had to get it done. You shouldn’t be undercover with no way to call for backup.”
Steve laughed. "Actually, that's the most normal part of all this. Dames were constantly falling for Bucky. He liked them just fine, but I can't say I ever saw him fall for one."
“Dr. Foster was apparently infected by the Aether, which is an infinity stone, like the Tesseract. The Aether is the ultimate weapon of the Dark Elves, who were once at war with Asgard. The leader of the Dark Elves kidnapped Jane and killed Thor’s mother. When word of her murder got out, Loki came to Asgard. Although he hates Odin, he loved Frigga more than anything. He has apparently been using the stolen Tesseract to travel through time and space. The Dark Elves removed the Aether from Dr. Foster, and with Loki’s help, Thor was able to defeat them. However, with his revenge complete, Loki vanished shortly thereafter.”
“Nah, Nat can handle herself. Besides, if anyone’s licensed to give talks on her behalf, it’s not me. It’s Clint. You might have a slight disadvantage, though, seeing as how we’ll all be back in New York this time tomorrow.”
“J, scan social media for any mentions of big events – weddings, funerals, etc. – that our targeted family members have in the upcoming two weeks. Let’s pick a date that they can all come to. Once you get a hold of everyone, make travel arrangements. Rent out the Plaza for two days. No other guests. Set up drivers to pick everyone up from the airport. You know the drill.”
“No, no, that part was true. It’s true that I didn’t love her. It’s a lie that we could’ve made each other happy. I would never have been happy with her. I wanted to be. Really wanted to be.”
“Well, that’s good. I’m not good with secrets, either. With one or two very specific exceptions, JARVIS won’t keep secrets from me, so don’t ask. I’ll take care of finding out what I can from SHIELD. You’re going to be in charge of testing Romanoff. I vote we wait to tell everyone else until you get a read on her, because if she sees us having regular conversations with the rest of the team, she’ll want to know why. I don’t do trust. After what I’m sure you’ve read in my files, you should understand why.”
“Clint said something about a girlfriend. Maybe he knows how to get a hold of them. I’ll ask him tomorrow when I get my playlist.”
"Two tours. Some things you leave there, some things you bring home with you." He shrugged. "How's it going in the modern world?"
“Yeah, no I get that. I mean I like my balls attached, but if that does it for you, whatever. But doesn’t it bother you?”
“Rhodey is still going to think you’re the most beautiful thing ever. Also, I’ll find someone to meet us at the hotel. We’ll fix it. As long as you’re okay, it’s all fixable.”
Steve slept solidly that night, his body working overtime to heal the minor damage done to him during the fight. From the look of Clint, he hadn’t fared nearly so well. The store with the phones was a little overwhelming, but Steve picked things up pretty quickly. The more he saw, the more he realized SHIELD had been sheltering him and guiding what he could and couldn’t see. Before the battle, he’d hardly left his room except to go to the gym. He wondered if he would’ve done all this if he hadn’t had a visit from future him, then decided it wasn’t worth trying to figure out. He didn’t know much of anything about his future, and it would drive him to madness if he examined every move wondering whether or not it was the same. He bought a phone and a laptop, deciding he didn't need a tablet. He would see if Natasha would come out with him for other things he needed – it would be a good opportunity to try and feel her out one-on-one.
Tony’s smile went soft around the edges. “Relax, Pep, I’m fine. JARVIS is monitoring me. I’m too wired to sleep now, anyway. I had some cold pizza. Guess we'll take a raincheck on the shawarma.” Right at that moment, though, Steve’s stomach growled, loudly and to his great embarrassment. Pepper, who hadn’t seen him in her Tony-tunnel-vision, whirled around, eyes widening. Tony laughed. “Apparently, the big guy feels differently. Pepper, this is Steve Rogers. Cap, this is Pepper Potts, light of my life and CEO of my company. I don’t suppose anywhere is going to be delivering tonight, huh?”
“Holy shit. It was crazy enough to hear that you’d come back from the dead, but Bucky Barnes too? Grandpa talked a lot about the two of you. He said Sarge saved his ass in Azzano. He could hold his own, but five on one odds aren’t great. I guess some of the guys weren’t too thrilled sharing the cell with a black man. Speaking of which, how exactly did you manage an integrated unit?”
“That could be a huge advantage,” Tony said. “From what we saw, it seems pretty likely that our future selves found out about Hydra in a violent way. I’m inside all of SHIELD’s files, and there’s nothing there about Hydra, so I’m guessing we only found out when they decided to come out of the shadows. Us not only knowing beforehand, but having a built-in spy? This’ll be cake.”
Clint laughed and pulled a mug out from behind his back. “Here you go.” He took a deep breath. “So I was wondering when you want me out of the tower.”
"Turns out pretty handy, actually, that even brainwashed, he managed to crack the ice on the person on the team that we most needed to convince."
The cab pulled up in front of the Tower, and Natasha quirked an eyebrow at him as they got out. "Stark is the one who called you?"
“We’ll have to get a list of teams and missions from Fury,” Clint said. “Some of it will depend on who is in charge of the group. If the team leader is loyal to SHIELD, we can have Fury issue encrypted orders for their eyes only. For teams that are led by Hydra, we’ll have to come up with something else.”
Phil is alive. Woo! He did die during the Battle of New York but was brought back to life by some crazy alien shit that Fury did (which he doesn't find out until later; he thinks he was dead for like 9 seconds). He now heads a team of people who make up the “Welcome Wagon” – they seek out new powered people, introduce them to SHIELD, help them adjust. His team is made up of Melinda May (played by Ming-Na Wen, she’s the most amazing bad-ass woman ever), Grant Ward, Jemma Simmons, Leopold Fitz, and Skye, at least in the beginning. May and Ward are the field agents, Simmons is the biochemist/biologist/other life sciences, Fitz is the engineer/weapons specialist, and Skye is a hacker that Phil recruited from outside SHIELD. May and Coulson have worked together for a long time and are really close. She was actually asked to watch Phil by Fury because all the other people who received the crazy alien treatment lost their minds, but she only did it because she and Phil are so close. Fitz and Simmons (collectively referred to as Fitz-Simmons) are extremely tight – they’ve been best friends since the academy, he’s in love with her, and eventually, they end up together. Skye adores Phil. When they meet, she doesn’t know who her parents are, she was bounced around the foster system and has no real family, and she definitely ends up seeing Phil as a father-figure. Ward is Hydra. He was initially recruited as a teenager (after suffering abuse from his parents and older brother for his whole childhood and then trying to kill his brother by lighting their house on fire) by John Garrett, who is also Hydra. Unlike a lot of Hydra members, Ward is not loyal to Hydra; he’s loyal to Garrett. It’s extremely traumatic for the whole team – he tries to kill Fitz and Simmons and ends up giving Fitz brain damage. He falls in love with Skye and tries to convince her to join him in Hydra. She tries to kill him. He continues to love her, and eventually, after Garrett dies during the war between SHIELD and Hydra, he ends up a prisoner of SHIELD; he agrees to give Skye information on Hydra to regain her trust. He doesn’t care about SHIELD or Hydra – just her. After the team loses Ward to Hydra, they gain Antoine “Trip” Triplett, grandson of Gabe Jones. When Trip was first introduced on the show, his commanding officer was John Garrett, but he wasn’t recruited by Garrett, and he’s not Hydra. Eventually, they get some new team members, including Bobbi Morse. In the show/MCU, her relationship to Clint is never mentioned, but they’re married in the comics (616), so I kept that. In AoS, she’s got another ex-husband, Lance Hunter, who also ends up joining the team. He’s a former mercenary but joins SHIELD after the other members of his team die on an op with SHIELD. They also gain Alphonso “Mac” Mackensie, an engineer who takes over/helps after Fitz is injured in the fight with Ward. Phew. I think that’s most of the background, but hopefully, the story stands on its own.
“Apparently it wasn’t a real gun. It was something she and Fitz invented. They call it a night-night gun. Boy, do they need better names. Anyway, it basically sedates whoever you shoot. Still, it makes me like her.”
There was a pause, and Steve knew that JARVIS was asking Tony. “I have notified him of your arrival, Captain. He would prefer that the other Avengers not join him in the lab.” Steve felt a tiny burst of pride that Tony trusted him to be in his space, but he also wanted Tony to trust the rest of the team. He knew he’d have to just give it some time.
Clint and Natasha exchanged a look. “There are some people in SHIELD that I’m absolutely sure of,” said Clint slowly, “but it’s hard to be absolutely sure of Fury. I do trust him. I do, but he keeps so many secrets. But then, some of the people I’m sure of are – or were – his most trusted people.”
“He took Pepper? How long ago? What are you doing about it?” Tony lurched toward Steve, who caught him by the upper arms.
“I do not have a record of Loki leaving with the scepter. The scepter was removed by a man who matches the existing data on Captain Steven Grant Rogers. He then returned a short time later and replaced the scepter.”
“No!” Tony rushed to respond. “This is definitely not just kissing. I would definitely like more than kissing. That sounded not how I meant it. More than just physical stuff. But also physical stuff. Not gonna lie, really want that too.”
Steve felt a huge wave of relief wash over him when he stepped back into the tower. Since Nat was staying in DC for a couple of weeks and Sam had to clear up his life in DC before moving, he was coming back alone. He asked JARVIS to take him to the common floor. When he arrived, Tony was on the phone.
“All due respect, Sir, that’s my job as their captain, and I take it very seriously. That’s what makes a team.”
Steve managed to overcome his shyness enough to look Tony in the eye. “I think I was waiting for the right partner.”
"Yeah, that's Bucky for ya. Always there for just exactly what I need." Steve sighed. The one time Bucky had needed him, he'd let him down. He had to make it up to him. Whatever it took, he'd find Bucky now and save him.
“Yeah, we’ve ID’d everyone at the bar. We’re going to look into Rumlow’s SO, see who else they recruited, as well as that Hydra Prep school. And then we were trying to figure out what living Hydra members are older than you.” Tony leaned over to pat Steve’s shoulder as he spoke.
“Your invitation is most welcome, Anthony. With the tesseract missing and the Bifrost broken, I do not know how long I will be unable to return to Asgard. And I do not like the hotel where Jane and I have been staying. Everything is so breakable. The furniture is much hardier on Asgard.” Bruce choked a little on his drink at Thor’s pronouncement.
So I realized that I had the wrong birth year for Natasha (I for some reason had it written down as 1974 instead of 1984), and that would’ve made her 13 when she met and fell in love with Bucky, which is creepy and gross, so I’ve made a few changes to Chapter 2. If you’d like to actually read it, it’s the paragraph that starts “Clint recruited me for SHIELD in the fall of 2000.” The summary is that she was 13, not 23 when they met, and she did fall in love with him in that 13-year-old who falls in love with a movie star or the cute older boy who lives down the street kind of way. Bucky is NOT a creepy predator and did not love her back, but thought of her as a sister and cared for her enough to be kind to her. Steve realizes that Natasha does actually look a little like Bucky’s baby sister. I have therefore also removed the Bucky/Nat tag. I also did a tiny bit of cleaning up of the previous chapters. Just little fixing of commas and typos and whatever.
Before he could respond, Tony interjected, "You know, the new suit wasn't just a gimmick to get you guys over here. I actually do build things. Cap, wanna check it out, or do you have to get back before curfew?"
Steve and Bruce exchanged a glance. “Shit. Bruce, if it’s alright with you, I’d like you to stay here and keep working. It’s not that I – ”
Natasha swept in behind him. Her eyes alighted on the picture of Peggy he'd hung on one wall. "Who's the girl?"
So the actual lyrics for this song aren’t really representative of this chapter, but I love the idea of Pierce being the Great King Rat. Since we’re meeting a new garbage character in this chapter, we’re also going to meet a new awesome character! Thank you so much to everyone who has commented. I appreciate the love more than I can tell you <3 I hope everyone is staying safe inside during this difficult time and that you’re all doing okay.
"Steve, it may have been longer for me than for you, but I couldn't forget the man who cost you your best friend." She took his hand and squeezed it warmly. Then she frowned. "But you're probably referring to the fact they recruited him for SHIELD." She sighed. "Yes, I was upset about that, but there was no arguing with Howard when it came to the serum. What does he have to do with SHIELD now? He's dead."
Steve blinked at her. That was not what he was expecting. “Uh, no. Clint mentioned it, but I haven’t gotten there yet.”
"Your tea isn't any better now than it ever was, and you only made it when you wanted something. Out with it."
Tony just blinked at him. “I don’t think that counts as a real lie, Rogers. That’s practically the truth. Also how did I not see pictures of this? I can’t believe that it wasn’t all over the news. Oh, Halloween. That’s when I was working on the thing for the update. Yeah, okay. Still. J, throw some pictures of Captain America as Superman up on the wall.” Immediately, photos covered the walls – Steve in glasses with the S peeking out of his button-up shirt, Steve posing with his hands on his hips and cape flared out behind him, Steve flexing with kids hanging off his arms.
She couldn’t complete the thought, but Tony had already seen what was making her babble. A car was backing up in the breakdown lane. It took only seconds, but each one was frozen in his brain. It was so close, cars were everywhere, around him, and suddenly it swerved out of the breakdown lane and right into his. He slammed on the brakes as hard as he could, bracing himself for impact. It came faster than he thought, but still somehow took forever.
“Lots of things. You and Red Skull were alone on that plane. He told you about the promise of Hydra. You didn’t kill him, the tesseract did. You saw something incredible when it killed him. You weren’t sure about joining SHIELD when you first woke up, so you wanted to look into it more. As soon as you saw Zola in the photograph of the early SHIELD, you knew he must have brought Hydra with him. You have enhanced hearing that allows you to listen in on conversations in the next room. The future is overwhelming and you need order. The brass never used to listen to you, and you don’t think Fury is listening to you now. You want more control over your destiny. Hydra is all about control. Any of those statements false?”
Steve gave a half-hearted attempt at a smile. “Fury mostly left me alone after I busted up his attempt at a ’40s era hospital.” Clint and Natasha exchanged another significant glance. “I have a radio, but I think Fury did something to it, because I only get a couple of jazz stations. Don’t get me wrong, I love jazz, but they’re not even getting the good stuff. I’d love to hear some other kinds. And all of Stark’s references – those come from movies, right? It’d be nice to understand more than every fifth word he says.”
“Arc reactor-powered helicarriers with continuous sub-orbital flight that sync to a network of targeting satellites.”
