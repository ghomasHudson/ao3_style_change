Castiel has heard that most HVF groups have disbanded at the government’s behest, but some of the more dedicated groups still operate. However much the treatment centre and the government encourages everyone to go back and live their lives like they used to, Castiel knows that disgust and hostility are most likely what awaits him.
“Sorry, boy, not this time. I’ll be back in a few hours,” he says. Dorian, evidently understanding the tone of voice, hangs his head a little before recovering and trotting over to his dog bed Cas placed in the living room.
“How about… Dorian?”
Dean stays exactly where he is, not letting up as he watches Cas’ face expectantly, holding his breath.
Dean doesn’t exactly know what he’s expecting, but whatever it might have been can’t hold a candle to the sight before him.
“Not. A.
I’m not sure what else I could be doing to convince you otherwise,” Cas replies jokingly.
“Thank you,” he whispers, hoping that somewhere, somehow, Balthazar hears him.
“Hey Sammy, what size shoes you want for those clown feet of yours?” Dean asks with a smirk. Sam rolls his eyes and Cas tries (and fails) to bite back a smile.
“As I recall, it was
“Shit,” she says, repeating Cas’ earlier statement. Cas sinks lower in his seat and Charlie avoids eye contact, but sure enough, Dean sees them and walks over to them, his face an indecipherable stony mask.
look pleasant,” she says. Castiel just shrugs and changes the subject.
(See the end of the chapter for
Their next task that Charlie insists upon is to clean out the fridge and, after discovering the furry, rotten, and expired items that in another life were once edible (however difficult to imagine), Cas whole-heartedly agrees. So, their expressions pinched in distaste at the pungent aroma, they start throwing everything out (it’s not like Cas has much use for food anymore anyway, edible or not). After they give the now empty shelves of the fridge a wipe-down and attempting to clean the few dirty dishes in the sink with a thorough scrubbing, Cas knows that they have to move on to the next challenge.
Cas could get used to this.
Dean raises an amused eyebrow. “Well, if that’s where you’ve set the bar for charming, I don’t even know what I’m worried about.”
Cas tries to say something else, but his throat seems too thick for words. So, he’s incredibly grateful when Dean gleans his unease from the single syllable.
“Sorry?” Castiel asks, confused. The man rolls his eyes.
Cas doesn’t know what to say to that. In truth, he knew it was screwed up. But he came anyway. He felt like he had to come anyway. Maybe he was wrong. Cas glances towards the door and wonders if he should just leave. Dean suddenly sighs and heads towards the couch.
“Hell yeah! You show ‘im, Dean!” they yell.
His thoughts momentarily wander to Balthazar. Didn’t he deserve justice? But, then again, that was John, not Dean. And if Cas has learned anything these past few days/weeks…
Before he retreats too far into the darker recesses of his mind, Cas suddenly finds himself wrapped up in Charlie’s embrace. Although the physical comfort is mostly wasted on him, Cas still greatly appreciates the gesture and hugs her back, burying his neck into her shoulder to try and stifle his hiccupping sobs.
“Christ, Cas, that’s awful. I’m so sorry,” Dean says. His brows are furrowed, like he’s trying very hard to say the right thing. “It’s not your fault.”
Bobby continues. “As for me, I’m gonna stick my nose in some books—see what I can scrounge up. I’ll let you know if I find anything.”
“Time away from you.”
“Right.”
“You’re gonna be fine, Clarence. Just means that you’re going to have a
Charlie considers this for a long moment. “Nah. Castean sails!” she cries. Cas and Charlie burst into giggles at their own ridiculousness and Cas decides something then and there.
“What did you and your family used to do for Christmas?”
Sam looks to the ceiling for a moment, as if asking for strength from a higher power, before saying, “I’ve seen the way you look at my brother.”
“I fucking don’t!”
Dean barks out a sharp, mirthless laugh and takes an extra long swig from the bottle. Cas doesn’t move, doesn’t speak. He’s shocked. He’s angry. He’s remorseful. He’s too many things to count.
“I seem to have developed claustrophobia… because of the um… you know,” Cas mumbles, unable to even bring himself to say the word.
“Why not?”
, but he’s in the car now and-“ Dean spitfires, running an agitated hand through his hair. Charlie interrupts him.
“The door across from mine,” Cas murmurs, handing the toys and magic set to Charlie while indicating where Samandriel and Gabriel’s shared bedroom is. He doesn’t need to tell Charlie that although he’s ready to begin the process of moving on, he’s nowhere near ready to enter any of his family’s bedrooms. He would surely crumble under the weight of the combined grief, guilt, and regret.
” Cas all but screams. He doesn’t know if it’s the tone, the use of the full name, or the rare instance of profanity that gets Dean’s attention, but the Impala is suddenly squealing to a stop on the side of the road and Dean is looking at him with concern.
Dean lets out a small, relieved breath before finding Cas’ hand where it lies between them, grasping it in his own.
In a word: complicated.
“Where are you?”
Then, Bobby’s eyebrows furrow. He makes a few more adjustments, quickly this time, before the eyebrows rise into his hairline. “What the hell…?” Bobby mumbles under his breath, leaning forward even further.
They stay like that until Cas notices, a little guiltily, that Dean has begun to shiver. The two boys head inside, quickly divesting themselves of their sodden clothing, whispering promises against sensitive skin about creating their own heat.
“Crap, okay, I gotta go if I’m gonna make it on time for my shift at the hospital,” Charlie says, already gathering her things, “Think about what I said.”
“Dorian the dog? Dude, you can’t be serious.”
Dean puts an arm around him then and, despite everything, Cas can’t help but lean into it. “I’m hearin’ a lot of ‘what ifs’ there, Cas. No sense worrying when we don’t know anything yet.”
They joke and laugh, Dean gushes about fun facts and behind the scenes knowledge, and Cas finds he’s truly enjoying himself. Archeological adventures make more sense to him than space warfare, he quickly discovers. Not only is he enjoying the movie, however, but also the time spent with Dean.
“There it is! Go get it, boy!” Cas says, throwing the toy across the room, a delighted Dorian running after it. He chews it mercilessly, squeaks filling the space, before bringing it back to Cas proudly.
If you have any thoughts or feedback I would love to hear them, your reviews always make my day <3 Okay now I'm gonna take an intense nap lol thanks again for your continued support everyone, it honestly means the world. Merry Christmas and happy holidays!! :D
“No, trust me, I’m not sorry about that because…
Not wanting to drag this process out any further, Castiel exhales a shaky breath and begins his transformation.
“I went to a party last night,” he says. Charlie brightens again.
“Been standing out here for a while.”
“If you’re thinking that they’re a couple of normal red blood cells hangin’ out in a body that can’t produce them, then yep.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greets happily. Dean looks from Cas to Dorian, smirking a little.
“Nothing, it’s… nothing,” Dean finally answers. The intense staring contest is finally broken as Dean moves along the next few rows of graves before announcing that there was no one else. John nods, satisfied, and the group finally leaves, dragging Balthazar’s body behind them.
“That’s not the only reason I called.”

“Because
“What’s up?” Dean asks, smiling at Charlie. Charlie is smiling back, but her expression seems… worried?
Dean smiles. “Yes, sir.”
all the life they used to contain,” replies Castiel, trying to pull suitable words from the English language to convey the confusing thoughts swirling around in his grief-addled mind.
needs.
“But… what if what happens isn’t… well…
“Charlie, I can’t explain it. I just… I feel like I need to do this. I have to,” Cas says, trying to put as much sincerity into his voice as he can. He doesn’t know why he feels so strongly about this, but he once again feels that unnamed pull, just as he did with seeing his own grave.

“What does that even mean?” Cas asks. Charlie looks at him and places a comforting hand on his shoulder.
Cas, no offense, I know you’ve been through a lot lately and I’m really glad you told me, but are you freaking
“Castiel and Dorian. You two were made for each other,” Dean says with an amused smirk, looking at Dorian. The dog tilts his head to the side and Dean suddenly barks out a laugh.
He tilts his head back up to the sky and spreads out his arms, closing his eyes to soak in as much as he can.
Cas is more than happy to oblige, walking right up to Dean and kissing him, soft and languid. Cas leans back and can’t help but laugh once more at the ridiculous head ornament.
“I’ll see you around?”
“Oh, yeah, definitely on the right track,” Dean replies smugly before bracing his arms on either side of Cas’ head and doing exactly what Cas wants, exactly how he wants it.
So why does it hurt so much?
, but it’s
“And what would you have me do, put that crap on my face and let them win? Sod that. I do it because I

Cas smiles a little and puts on an over-exaggerated voice, “I don’t want to be
2009.
“I don’t have it,” Cas says, his voice shocked, still unable to fully believe it himself.
In a way, he thinks it would be better if they came every night like clockwork. That way, he could prepare himself for the inevitability of them. The uncertainty, the not knowing, makes the flashbacks that much worse.
Cas – together into one cohesive image. He’s seen – and subsequently killed – plenty of rabids before, but this is different. This is horrific in a way Dean has yet to experience in his unfortunate line of work.
Sam takes a deep breath and lets out his next words all in one breath. “Something’s-wrong-with-Dean.”
As Charlie starts to wander the room a little, Castiel ponders his growing fondness for the girl. He finds himself
They then exchange a few details about tonight, and it’s decided that Cas will go over at 8 pm. Needless to say, he’s looking forward to it: to the movie (though he’d never admit his curiosity to Dean), to seeing Sam again, but mostly to seeing Dean for the first time since their kiss(es) on the rainy doorstep. Cas’ over-active brain leaps into action, and he tries not to let it cross that tenuous line between “wondering” and “worrying”, which he quickly finds out is much easier said than done.
He starts to feel
“PDS sufferers killed my mom. They might as well have killed my dad. It’s my job to make sure they pay for that. For what they did. For what
“Dorian, do you feel I may have spoiled you a bit?” Cas asks his dog. The animal in question hops around on his newly purchased dog bed, switching from toy to toy, overwhelmingly excited from the selection and unable to choose just one to play with. Cas chuckles warmly, “No, I didn’t think so.”
to me! Ever since you showed up, my head’s been a goddamn
in matters such as these, always repressing and internalizing his thoughts and feelings. Alone was what he knew best, and yet now that he had it, he finds himself floundering in a way he’d never experienced before.
Cas smiles. “Seems like sound advice to me. But that’s coming from a completely unbias party, of course.”
This time, she leads him away from the dancers and over towards the far wall. They approach a table that Cas hadn’t been able to see from his earlier vantage point. On it lies a large platter with some kind of food that Cas can’t quite distinguish. Just as he begins to wonder why there is food at a party full of dead people, they’re at the table and Cas can finally see what’s on the platter.
“What do you mean?”
“I wouldn’t know.”
or something, I don’t know! Or what if it wasn’t actually
“Um, hi.”
“Yes it is, Dean! Don’t you understand? It
“Why?”
“And what’s your name, little guy?” Charlie asks, directing the question more at Cas.
“No, it’s okay. I- I want to,” Cas replies, surprising not only Dean, but also himself. Cas takes a moment to collect himself, trying to organize his thoughts amidst the chaos of
“What the
“Thanks, man, I’ve been looking everywhere for it.”
“Okay, okay, so I might not be the best at coming up with analogies. Sue me,” Charlie replies, smiling and rolling her eyes good-naturedly. Castiel chuckles.
“It’s not pity, it’s…” Dean loses his words for a moment, trailing off with a frustrated huff. He pauses for a moment, evidently trying to form the right words, before abandoning the notion completely. “Fuck, I just don’t want to lose you, okay?”
Cas finds amusement in playing up his ignorance of certain franchises, loving how it riles Dean up. Sure enough, a reply chimes in a minute later.
In which the bubble bursts.
There’s an inherent vulnerability in nakedness—for Dean had quickly divested Cas of the rest of his clothes as well, remarking that it was a two-way street—but it’s comfortable in a way Cas hadn’t previously thought was possible. Between the two of them lies an openness and an honesty that wasn’t there before, and with the largest of the unseen barriers down, the small addition of clothes seemed almost laughably inconsequential in comparison.
Dean smiles a little at that, his mouth just barely curling upwards in the corners, before he’s impossibly closer, his breath ghosting over Cas’ mouth as he speaks. “It
Cas grabs his trenchcoat off its designated hook, and he and Charlie are out the door (Cas having already put on his makeup that morning, just for something to do). They clamber into Charlie’s yellow Gremlin and she starts the engine.
Instead, Cas feels the presence beneath his pinky get snatched away as Dean suddenly volts off the couch, standing up rigidly straight. Cas is too surprised to even get a word out.
The chorus of the song comes on and Charlie starts dancing around, belting the lyrics, and somehow still managing to begin dusting the furniture simultaneously.
Dean’s eyes widen in terror, “I’ll turn around, we can go back!”
Just in time to be almost blinded by some type of laser light. He closes the door and looks around.
“What if I don’t want you to calm down?”
And then some nerdy little dude in a trench coat comes along and
“Alright, while I’m stuck with you, I might as well give you a much-needed education.”
“Yeah, I think I do,” Dean replies with an indecipherable expression. There’s a sad crease in the furrow of Dean’s brows and Cas tries to think of something he could say that would smooth it out.
Charlie looks up, only just noticing Dean’s presence. “Oh! Hi, Dean! Didn’t realize you’d be here.”
Cas is feeling too much, too fast, and all he really wants to do right now is sleep. He trudges up the stairs to his room, more exhausted that he’s ever been, and climbs on top of the covers still completely dressed.
try to move on, to fully embrace his second life, but all he
“Come ooon, Clarence, like I said, you gotta loosen up and this will definitely do the trick. I would say ‘live a little’, but, well,” Meg says, laughing at her own joke.
On their way out the door, Castiel grabs his reliable trenchcoat and his mother gives him a fond—if slightly long-suffering—look.
“Where should we go?” Cas asks. Dean thinks for a moment.
And manageable is exactly what they need as they rehabilitate the undead back into living society.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean replies with a comforting smile, his eyes radiating kindness. Cas can feel his throat thicken with emotion; he lets go of Dean’s wrist.
He pauses by the ‘S’ authors, remembering how much he enjoyed the Dan Simmons novel he read not too long ago, and stoops to examine his other titles. He picks up one called “The Fifth Heart”, and reads the back, learning with interest that it’s a historical mystery with Sherlock Holmes and Henry James as main characters. Caught up in the description, Cas fails at first to notice the woman staring at him from across the aisle. Sensing her in his peripherals, he looks up out of instinct.
They break apart for air, and Dean smiles a little guiltily, “I should have done that right when you walked through the door.”
“What about something like… Destiel?” Cas asks.
of us. We can do this.”
Cas raises his eyebrows in surprise. “Yes, ma’am,” he can’t help but reply.
that you—”
“I think he must have had a panic attack. Jess has them sometimes when she gets really stressed, she taught me what to do,” Sam explains, “Dean, you count to ten and coach him through his breathing while I get a blanket or something.”
Cas hesitates for a fraction of a second.
“I understand, Dean. You shouldn’t feel guilty for wanting someone…normal.”
Dean makes a show of shoving him. It’s not that hard, but it’s hard enough to force Cas to the ground and he falls to the gravel by the side of the road. Dorian yips in concern and trots over to Cas, staring up with confused brown eyes at Dean.
And by the way Dean’s face lights up in a warm smile, that’s all he needed to hear. Dean lifts his hand and lays it gently on Cas’ face, which Cas can’t help but lean into. Dean quirks a brow, as if asking permission, and Cas gives a small smile in return. Dean then leans forward and kisses Cas, so tenderly that Cas’ throat feels thick with emotions too great to possibly express. They part reluctantly, and Cas tries to pour everything he’s feeling into their shared gaze.
Dean suddenly claps his hands together, making Cas jump a little, as he says, “Well. This can’t get any more awkward, so let’s just watch the fuckin’ movie, huh?”
“Sorry, that was stupid, I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“And as for you. If I
“And just where do you think you’re going?” Dean asks him accusingly.
“Yes, we do.”
Dean then heads to the front desk, where the receptionist hands him a few bills, which Dean pockets, and then they’re out the door.
But Cas’ insecurities, evidently not to be tamed overnight, spit timid words from his mouth before he can stop them, “Was that… okay?”
Evidently having given up his useless attempts to knock down the car doors – and not having the working brain power to undo the locks – Cas just sits there, looking right at Dean. The sight makes Dean’s blood run cold. Cas is perched in the driver’s seat on his haunches, facing Dean. He stares unblinkingly at him and though Dean doesn’t want to, he can’t help but stare back. The next thing Cas does breaks Dean’s heart; he tilts his head to the side slightly. What should be an endearing quirk of confusion is now a cold and menacing predatory sign of considering. Cas looks like he’s sizing Dean up, like he’s figuring out what section of him he wants to rip apart first.
What if there are factors no one considered? What if… What if this—What if
it. He tilts his hand from side to side, watching in fascination as the droplet moves lazily from one side to the other, Cas
“You made fun of me for naming my dog ‘Dorian’, but you call your car
Cas clutches at Dean’s side, grasping at every part of this radiant boy he can reach. Suddenly emboldened and utilizing a strength he didn’t know he possessed, Cas flips their positions so that Dean is gazing up at him with pleased surprise. Cas regards how Dean’s iridescent green irises are nearly swallowed with the black of his dilated pupils, and Cas still can’t believe he’s the reason for such a reaction.
They hadn’t gotten very far, and it only takes them less than ten minutes to arrive back home again. Cas thinks, a little despondent, how he misses the cozy feeling of coming indoors after being outside in the cold; he truly didn’t know what he had until it was gone, as the saying goes. He quickly shakes it off, though, and hangs up his coat while Dorian shakes off any snow that had stubbornly stuck to his fur.
“Set him down on the couch,” Sam instructs. Dean does what he’s told and guides Cas to the couch, gently pushing him down onto it. Sam kneels in front of Cas and starts to speak in a relaxed, calm voice.
“Wait. So you’re telling me that you had a run-in with John Winchester?
Sure enough, once the dog gets a few meters away from Cas, he stops suddenly. Then, Cas hears a low growl rolling off the animal, the menacing noise seeming unnatural from the small canine. Cas isn’t surprised by the reaction. Animals seem to be able to sense the lack of life force in people like him. And dogs, with their keen sense of smell, can’t place the unsettling aroma coming from the dead. Though he isn’t surprised, Cas can’t help but feel – absurdly – a little hurt.
Cas says nothing.
If Dean is surprised at the new seating arrangement, he doesn’t say anything. Instead, he cranks up some angry-sounding rock music and peels out of the drive.
And there we go! What did you think? I wanted to show a chapter of Dean and Cas sort of learning how to be together, so let me know if you think I accomplished that or not :D
this is safe?”
“What does that
“Thank you,” Cas says quietly, but sincerely. He tries to truly believe Dean’s words, but constantly re-routing your brain into less guilty channels is much easier said than done. He sniffs a little and tries to calm down, before he goes to wipe his eyes out of instinct.
He once again begins an inner debate about simply turning around and leaving, when a girl about his age with mid-length dark hair and a leather jacket, saunters up to him, looking a bit like a delighted cat having found a mouse to play with.
“Damnit, Cas, you’re the one who wanted to be friends in the first place!” Dean cries. Cas’ throat feels thick with tears he wishes he were able to shed.
A few minutes in, his eyes start to droop and his breathing begins to slow, and soon enough he falls asleep.
“It’s all true.”
“Merry almost-Christmas, Cas,” Dean says, smiling warmly.
“I don’t
and I could have been with them!” Cas sobs, getting more and more inconsolable the more he talked. Dean hasn’t once let go of his hand, even when Cas is sure he’d gripped it to the point of discomfort.
Cas leads them to his bedroom, trying not to be self-conscious of his space as he realizes Dean has never actually seen it before. Then again, Dean seems a little too distracted to focus on the particulars of Cas’ decor. Dean walks them backwards until the back of Cas’ legs hit his bed, which he lowers himself onto. He expects Dean to follow suit, but is surprised when Dean remains standing. Dean cups the back of his neck, giving him a lingering kiss, before breaking away and looking around the room.
a love-sick teenager, so surely some allowances can be made.
Just as he starts to worry he’s missed it, Cas comes to the end of the road and a small park that has seen better days. The sun is just beginning to set on the play structure and it’s accompanying swings. The park is empty save for one lone figure sitting on a swing, looking down at his feet.
There’s a moment of awkward silence, until Cas – against his better judgment – breaks it.
Having finished, he dries off and wraps a towel around his waist and heads to his closet. He opens it and for a brief and ridiculous moment, actually worries about what he should wear. As if that will really make a difference. He shakes off the thought and randomly grabs a long-sleeved black shirt and a pair of jeans.
Cas loves Dean.
And dear God when did Cas start finding threats on his life amusing?
“What’s not to get?! It’s an awesome line!”
In which poor Cas really can't catch a break...
Cas looks up into Dean’s amused face, regards how his pupils are blown wide. He smiles and shrugs, a little coy. He leans closer and relishes the way Dean’s lustful gaze drops to his lips and back again. “Maybe it’s just you.”
“It’s, uh, kind of a long story…” Dean begins, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Who’s Dean Winchester?” Castiel asks.
Cas’ voice breaks on the last question, and he severs eye contact with Dean, suddenly unable to bear the weight of his gaze. He crosses his bare arms loosely, wishing he weren’t so exposed.
It’s then, for the first time in the course of their friendship, that Cas gets
And Cas knows without a shadow of a doubt that this is one of those days.
“Well… perhaps a little,” he says quietly, looking sheepish. Charlie snorts a good-natured laugh.
Cas sighs. “I know. I’m not sure how I feel quite yet. We’re not even sure if we just received good news or bad. What about you? What do you think of it all?”
“This was a dumb idea,” Dean replies, a little huffy. Cas only smiles, finding the sore loser side of Dean rather endearing.
“Don’t touch me,” he hisses vehemently. Cas is hurt and confused.
“I didn’t say anything!” Castiel replies, feigning innocence. Charlie rolls her eyes, smiling.
“I’m doing alright. A little better, I guess.”
“You know you can confide in me, right? I mean, I don’t hang around here just to shoot you up with chemicals,” she says, smirking. Castiel chuckles.
For a moment, Cas doesn’t say anything, overwhelmingly grateful to Bobby for supplying the words that Dean should be far more used to hearing than he is. Dean suddenly laughs, continuing, “He also said not to screw it up.”
“It’s just you and me, Dorian,” Cas intones softly.
” Charlie exclaims after Cas has finished telling her all of what took place the night before.
Castiel can barely hear his own screams through the ringing in his ears and the sirens that now surround him. As his vision goes black, the blinding brightness of the fire still flickers behind his eyelids.
Surprisingly, Dean drops him off at his house this time instead of a block away. Cas is grateful for this; he feels exhausted. Just as he reaches to open the car door, a hand suddenly clasps his shoulder. He turns to look at Dean.
” Dean says, a mixture of authoritative and just…
“Sort of?”
The doctor asks him a few routine questions – which Castiel answers with as few words as possible – before picking up what can only be described as a medication gun. The doctor inserts a vial of neurotriptyline into the device and gets behind Castiel. The device is then inserted into a small, grotesque hole located under the back of his neck, right between the first and second vertebrae. He knows the injection is coming, but he still squeezes his eyes shut and hisses as the doctor pulls the trigger. It’s not necessarily with pain – he doesn’t feel pain anymore – but more the brief onslaught of emotions and the sudden jolt of memories he doesn’t want to remember.
“That’s good, because something happened and if I don’t tell someone I fear I may explode.”
At first, Cas doesn’t think that Dean has even heard him, but after a long pull from the whiskey bottle and a shuddery breath, Dean begins to speak, his words coming out slow and ever so slightly slurred.
“Thank you?”
“Look, I’m sorry, man, I wasn’t thinking, I should have known-“ Dean starts, actually apologizing to him.
Dean pauses for a moment and chuckles a little, his eyes somehow bright and sad at the same time.
“Caught a rotter on patrol. Just dropping it off,” Dean replies, to which John nods approvingly.
“Right,” Bobby murmurs, nodding.
Cas laughs. “You are smooth! I, personally, have yet to hear a better pick up line than”—he assumes a terrible impression of Dean’s voice—“‘if anyone’s going to kill you, it’s gonna be me.’”
And with that, Cas finds himself being pulled towards the throng of dancers.
The pup lowers his head, seeming to shake it in disbelief. Cas sighs. He looks around him, trying to get some kind of inspiration. His gaze falls on the ornate cover of his favourite book. He looks at the canine warily, as he pitches one last idea.
“You asked me to,” Cas replies simply. Dean nods and stares ahead again. Cas does the same, swinging back and forth just a little.
“I’m sorry-“
Dean is silent for a long moment. His grip alternates on the steering wheel, loosening and tightening in quick succession. He lets out a frustrated breath.
“What are you saying?” Dean replies, sounding almost angry.
Castiel fists his hands in the bed sheets and shuts his eyes tight as the neurotriptyline invades his body. He turns back around once the feeling fades to find Charlie wincing in sympathy.
“You’ll see, but it definitely involves-“ Charlie starts before dashing off to the kitchen mid-sentence. Cas hears the opening and closing of cupboard doors before she returns. “These!” Charlie finishes, throwing a bottle of cleaning supplies in Cas’s direction along with a roll of paper towels. Just as he catches them, Charlie dashes off again, this time up the stairs. She comes back with a portable speaker and her iPod. As she sets it up, she speaks over her shoulder to Cas.
“And why is that?”
“You do it when you’re confused about something, it’s kind of hilarious,” Dean says. Cas smiles a little, and raises his eyebrows a fraction in surprise. Now it’s Dean’s turn to be confused.
He can’t say that he doesn’t feel some level of disgust when he looks at himself, nor can he say there isn’t a part of him that’s worried Dean will want nothing to do with him if he saw this. However, Cas just shoves that to the back of his brain because right now he’s capable of it.
Cas racks his brain, trying to figure out a way to explain it.
“Indeed. Two peas in a pod, you and me. Brothers in arms and all that.”
Castiel nods, heaving a sigh. Charlie places a comforting hand on his shoulder.
treated to me. Wouldn’t you agree, boys?” John says, glancing at his fellow soldiers. Cas follows his gaze and he finally notices Dean among the six people gathered, standing towards the back. While the others chuckle cruelly and nod their heads at John’s taunt, Dean just looks straight ahead, stony-faced and silent, jaw clenched. Cas looks back to Balthazar, fearing the worst.
Cas leans back a bit to look into Dean’s eyes which almost seem to glow in the dim porch light. Dean looks uncharacteristically shy, and Cas would be lying if he said he didn’t find it endearing.
The happiness is, rather contradictorily, scary in itself. It’s a fact of life that when you have something, it is possible that it could be taken away from you. This is the same of happiness, and a part of Cas is scared when he feels it because somehow it makes the inevitable loss of it that much worse. He tries not to let that stop him from feeling this way, tries to just enjoy the rare moment, a sense of lightness he hasn’t felt in the months since his return.
“I thought you didn’t remember.”
Cas shuts the door and begins to walk up his driveway. He hears the roaring of Dean’s engine fade away behind him. Cas finally gets to the front door and goes inside, collapsing against it. He breathes out a contented, tired sigh. He smiles to himself. Cas didn’t have friends…
It’s not until he’s a few meters away that Cas notices the already half-empty whiskey bottle in Dean’s hand and everything clicks together.
“You- you’re a PDS sufferer?” Cas asks, stating the obvious.
“Right, completely neutral, huh?” Dean teases.
Cas can physically see the relief that washes over Dean’s face, and when the pressure is suddenly released, Cas realizes Dean had been holding him down.
“But you’re ready now?” Cas asks, a bit nervously.
So distracted is he, that it takes him a minute to realize that Dean is asking him a question.
No one likes to read an author's note full of excuses, so instead I'll just say that I really hope you enjoy this absolute BEAST of a chapter, clocking in at a little over 7k :D
“No choice? He could have
Cas was fairly confident Sam would like his gift: a nice set of glass slides and petri dishes for his microscope which Cas purchased after Sam mentioned his frustrations with the cheap plastic ones he had. Dean’s gift, however, was a risk and Cas was extraordinarily nervous about giving it to him on Christmas Eve.
“Then what?” Charlie replies, calming down a little bit.
Now, a few days later, Cas lies in bed awash in that blissful feeling of awake-but-not-quite, and smiles a little at the fond memory. For the first time in what he thinks is far too long, he feels
Cas flounders for a response as Dean pops in the DVD and sits on the couch.
What is in reality only a few seconds, feels like hours to Cas as Dean opens the wrapping paper to reveal a small wooden box with ornately carved designs on the lid. Dean lifts the lid, finding a music box mechanism inside. Dean smiles like people do when they don’t know what’s coming, but who are excited to find out. He quickly locates the silver wind-up key on the bottom and cranks it three times.
Dean slowly releases most of his tension, but defeat is still present in the sag of his posture. He regards their joined hands and looks at Cas. “It’s not just that. I mean, I can’t even see my own goddamn boyfriend without worrying about someone breathing down our necks, you know?”
“What?”
“I just… I don’t want any part of it. That life. And I…”
Before Dean can say whatever clever quip is surely on the tip of his tongue, Cas finds far better uses for that mouth by kissing it again. He gives in to his fingers’ exploratory whims and sneaks them under Dean’s shirt, feeling the smooth planes of muscle he finds there. Dean shivers a little under his hands and when they part again reluctantly to take a breath, Dean croaks out, “Bed?”
Bobby chews his cheek for a moment. “I ain’t never seen anything like it.”
First thing's first: I'M SO SORRY!! I know this is really late, but I was swamped with school work and exams so I apologize for that, but I'm done for the holidays now :D I wrote the bulk of this chapter today, and I'm pretty proud of it, so I hope you enjoy it!! <3 Also...
Cas bites his lip thoughtfully for a brief moment, trying to come up with a witty retort. He smirks as he types his next message.
but it hurts.
For the millionth time, thanks for sticking with me guys, it means the world xoxoxo
Love you all and I hope you all have a fantastic day :D
“Hell yeah. I think you’re gonna like it: good mix of history shit and action awesome-ness,” Dean says excitedly, making his way into the living room. Cas follows and settles down on the couch while Dean messes about with the DVD.
Bobby shoots him a small glare. “Hold your horses, will ya? I’m gettin’ there.” He turns back to Cas. “Neurotriptyline was always meant to be sort of a… permanent band-aid, I guess. Nothing was gettin’ better, but nothin’ was gettin’ worse. But… When I looked at your blood… Well. Come here and I’ll show you,” Bobby says, gesturing towards the microscope.
Ten minutes later, Charlie is pulling her Gremlin into the driveway. Cas walks downstairs and meets her at the door, and they head back up to his room.
“So… what the hell was that?” Dean asks, not unkindly.
with somebody? Let alone a dude. Especially one who’s… you know.”
He can feel the uncomfortable sensation of a panic attack coming on and tries desperately to control his breathing. He closes his eyes, and just as quickly snaps them back open again when the grieving mother’s face appears behind his lids.
Dean ducks back in for one last quick kiss and then runs to his car with a wave goodbye.
food.
They drive in silence for a few more minutes until Cas has had just about enough.
,” the woman cries, dissolving into broken sobs.
This is
Cas is too stunned to speak for a moment. Soon, though, his tension melts and he smiles. “Yes, I suppose you’re right.”
In which Castiel makes a friend and meets a certain someone...
Cas just stands there on the fringes of the excitement, mouth slightly agape and
“Cas? What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean whispers, letting Cas go. He looks around, but there’s no one in the immediate vicinity who can overhear them or see them.
“Dean… is he a…?” the boy begins to say, trailing off. He addresses Dean, but remains looking at Cas like he is a particularly interesting animal at a zoo. Cas looks down and shuffles his feet, suddenly uncomfortable.
Distantly, he hears shuffling to his side, but doesn’t think anything of it.
Castiel considers it for a moment. He’s not exactly looking forward to interacting with others, but he did fine with Charlie so maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.
Normally, this would be the time where Castiel would go back to his room and pass the time by counting ceiling tiles and mentally reciting poems and quotes that he’s memorized until he eventually falls asleep, but today is different. He once more follows the crowd to their new destination.
“Somehow I doubt that. Although...” Cas says before trailing off.
Dean laughs shakily. “You’re such an—
Cas beams, “Me neither. I had a great time too, Dean.”
Your dad-“
Dean suddenly looks at him, a little stern, “Yeah, they are, because they’re special to
“Not so fast. Come here, boy,” John says, his tone sounding… off. Castiel swallows and walks back to John, still keeping his head down.
“I know.”
“How ‘bout tomorrow?”
“It’s new to me, is all. I don’t know how to act. Just need to get used to it, I guess.”
So what'd you think? :D I'd love to read any and all comments you may have!
Cas nods solemnly, feeling – for the umpteenth time – very lucky to have Charlie in his life.
He stands there for a moment, immobile in his shock, before shaking it off and getting to work. He picks up all of the items on the floor, handling each with care, and puts them away in the designated spot. He shakes out the bed covers and remakes both beds until they lay nice and neat. He opens the window a little to hopefully refresh the stale air. He cleans until the layers of dust have receded.
—was never meant to last?”
During their time in the Impala, when Cas made his silly confession, he knew that whatever idea had made Dean’s eyes light up so beautifully was an idea he could never say no to. And in the moment, he hadn’t
Sam’s expression fades from shock to focused determination.
Cas notices the Jeep slowing down at the staged scene.
. That’s the beauty of freedom, you see.”
Castiel is surprised at himself. He’s usually not so… snarky. But, then again, he’s never had the (dis)pleasure of meeting someone like Dean Winchester.
“Sounds perfect for us,” Cas says softly with a smile. Dean pauses his ministrations and looks back at Cas. He returns the smile and, though the tension in the room is still stiflingly thick, Cas can’t help but be comforted by the small action.
Cas thinks, going to the top cupboard and reaching towards the very back. He feels around for a box and smiles when he finds what he’s looking for. He pulls out an old box of dog biscuits.
“This one’s on me, alright?” she says by means of apology, gesturing at their food.
By the third replay, Cas starts to murmur the lyrics, moving his shoulders to the beat.
“Of course.”
“See? I got you a ‘lol’! You’re welcome,” Charlie says, proud of her so-called achievement. Cas just chuckles a little and shakes his head.
They look at each other, smiling a little, but it reaches neither of their eyes.
“Well, you know what they say, communication is key and all that. Worse comes to worse, he tells you he hates you and that he was just drunk off his ass.”
“Hey, yourself. The surprise, I take it?” Dean replies, gesturing to Dorian. Cas beams, nodding.
Cas has seen Dean’s determination many times before. He’d seen it when Dean had been trying to make the best of a life he’d never wanted. He’d seen it when Dean had needed to make his voice heard after their encounter with the HVF. He’d even seen it when they’d done something as simple as bowling. Not only was Dean one of the most determined people Cas had ever met, but he also had a seemingly endless capacity for caring. He’s seen that many times too—mostly in the way he cared for Sam.
“Are you done?” Cas asks politely.
The first thing Cas hears is his name.
The rest of their game passes by quickly. In the end, Sam surprises them all by taking the lead, Cas not too far behind him, and Dean bringing up the rear (which he, predictably, was none too pleased about).
“Shit, I’m so sorry about Dean! I swear he’s not usually such a–“
“Where is this coming from?” Cas asks of this sudden truce, and suddenly wishes he could take it back, not wanting to push his luck.
“There was a time when people would have said I was smooth. Just wondering where the hell that went.”
“Bye.”
Next up in the routine is group therapy, which is about as exciting as it sounds, that is to say, not at all. Castiel loathes group therapy. Even before he died, he was a bit of an introvert, never talking much, but now he barely speaks at all if he can help it.
“I know he does, but… it’s not the same. When he smiles at me, it just looks like… some kind of apology? I don’t even really know for what, but it’s hard to look at sometimes. I doubt he even knows he does it. But when he smiles at you, it’s like… he’s just
“Not a thing,” Cas replies stoically.
“Well?” he asks, a teasing lilt to his voice. Cas blinks in confusion.
“I’ve been assigned to give you your medication and to check up on you, see how you’re doing and all that,” she replies.
Dean looks tired and haggard. His hair is in disarray like he’s yanked his fingers through it too many times. The car smells of old booze.
Cas tries to catch Dean’s eye, but can’t seem to manage it and he doesn’t even want to consider what that might mean. Instead, his gaze roams over to Charlie who’d been standing at the sidelines of the exchange.
“Ooh sounds juicy. Gimme.”
“He’s right.”
“I know, I know. It’s just hard to talk about, that’s all. I hope you understand.”
Cas stares at Dean, open-mouthed. The anger is gone from Dean’s expression, replaced with that tired sadness Cas has come to know. Cas’ brain, usually so analytic and sharp, is completely, utterly, blank.
“Yeah, whatever.”
Time always seems to go slower when you’re waiting for something, Cas muses as he paces his bedroom, willing the minutes on the clock to turn faster so that he can just get this over with. He decides to take a shower, not out of hygienic necessity, but just to keep himself preoccupied.
“Cas?” Dean calls, a few paces ahead. Cas knows he must look insane, but he’s too elated to care, particularly as more snowflakes follow the first one in a steady sprinkling of sparkling white. He looks up to the sky, feeling the pinprick shock of each flake hitting his face. He can’t help it; he begins to laugh.
In person.
“It’s fine, Charlie. Seriously, don’t worry about it,” Castiel says, waving a hand. Charlie sighs before pushing her plate away.
“May I ask the problem here, ma’am?” he says to the woman. The fury in her eyes is still present, but now there’s also an indescribable sadness. She switches to English in a choked voice.
Dean shrugs, a hint of a smirk on his lips, “Nothin’. Just never heard you laugh like that, is all.”
?” Cas retorts a tad testily, the emotional barriers he’s come to know in the past few weeks serving as his shield.
“No problem,” Dean replies.
Cas beams. “More than.”
He cuts across his lawn, hastily retreating into the forest. He inhales the pleasant scent of nature through his nose and feels the corners of his mouth quirk upwards in a smile. He’s missed this, he suddenly realizes. Castiel deftly makes his way through the forest, ducking under branches and stepping over obstacles, somehow still remembering where to go. It’s strange how such mundane things come back to him, as if he’d never been away at all.
He’s touching, feeling, tasting, and he never wants it to stop. Everything is fading away and falling out from underneath him, but it’s not scary at all, it’s-it’s- he’s not falling, he’s
, that can utterly destroy him.
“Nervous because the thought of going back into society seems daunting and I’m afraid I’m not going to know how to live ‘a normal life’ anymore.”
Dean groans. “Oh, man, did I really say that?”
Having had just about enough, Cas starts to leave, but stops short at the spot where Balthazar’s second life had been cruelly ripped from him. Cas sets a knee on the ground and touches the grass with an almost reverent caress.
“Hi,” Cas says, not trusting himself to say anything further.
“You’re scaring me, man, what the hell is wrong with you?” Dean asks, voice raising. He grabs Cas’ arms and pulls him out of the closet. Cas whimpers.
“I said, what’s his name?”
They walk inside and take a seat in a booth by the window before a pretty blonde girl walks up to them holding a small notepad, presumably their waitress.
, it would be
“The longer you wait, the harder it’s going to be,” Charlie replies simply.
Maybe this is what healing feels like.
In which there is a new beginning.
Cas looks at the timestamp of the last text and realizes with a start that it was only sent about ten minutes ago, meaning that Dean could be here any time now.
“Huh? Yeah, totally, everything’s peachy. Why do you ask?” Dean counters, clearly trying (and failing) to throw Cas off the scent.
“Alright, alright. Even I can take a hint.”
“And yeah… I guess it would be easier… but fuck it. Easier doesn’t mean better, and I can never say no to a challenge,” Dean says, smirking rebelliously.
Cas quickly glances at his phone’s GPS and relays the information to Dean, who announces he’ll be there in ten and promptly hangs up before Cas can say another word.
“Shit,” he says, a rare example of his use of profanity.
Dean kisses him with surety and absolution.
The hours pass by quickly as he watches the sky change its colours, offering up a wide range from blue to orange to pink. He notes absent-mindedly that while the setting sun paints its vast array of hues, Castiel’s mind is a blank canvas, blessedly devoid of all thoughts. He ponders the interesting contradiction for a moment before letting the thought slip away from him like all the others.
Unknown Number.
“I guess I just wanted to say… thanks?” Dean says with an awkwardness that Cas knows only appears when Dean’s trying to be nice to him.
“Good.”
“Thank you,” he says.
In the rare moments of silence, however, Cas can’t help but ponder on old Novak and Winchester Christmas traditions. He thinks about how although it’s sad to let them go…
Cas puts his eyes up to the occular lenses. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust, but when they do, the sight of his own blood cells greet him. From the droplet itself, he expects to see nothing but tiny, black Cheerios slowly oozing their way across the slide. And he does see this, but what shocks him is that it’s not all he sees.
“Does this mean we’re friends again?” The question slips out unbidden, and Cas immediately feels like he’s been reverted back to a toddler for even asking. But Charlie only smiles.
I'M SORRY DON'T KILL ME! You must have known it was going too smoothly for our boys, I gotta keep you guys on your toes after all haha ;D I'd love to hear any thoughts you may have, reviews always make my day (and honestly with me going back to school tomorrow bright and early, I could use the cheering up lol). Love ya <3
“Are you sure that’s a good idea? With my… um… condition?” Castiel says, worried about people’s reaction to him and not wanting Charlie to get caught in the crosshairs.
He walks through the sliding doors of the chain store and wipes his boots on the mat before entering. The floor plan is as familiar to him as his own home, and he walks through it confidently, feeling more at ease in a public place than he normally would. He browses shelves aimlessly, looking for nothing in particular, accompanied by the music of cash registers and idle chatter and the clinking of mugs at the connecting coffee shop.
“Thank you,” Dean whispers into Cas’ shoulder, barely audible. Cas doesn’t say anything, just holds him tighter.
“Contacts and cover-up.
“Hey, Cas. Wake up. Come on, Sleeping Beauty, up and at ‘em,” says a joking voice. Cas yawns and rubs his eyes as he sits up. He opens them and is confused for a moment until he remembers where he is.
“I- No. I… didn’t consider that. I’m sorry,” Cas says, getting up off the couch and approaching Charlie. He’s at a complete loss as to what to do or say in order to make any of this better.
“They… They sound like really cool kids,” Dean says quietly.
“Yeah.”
So, he decides to take an early evening walk.
“Oh? Why’s that?” Cas replies.
Dean suddenly looks uncomfortable, and Cas almost feels bad before remembering that being open and honest in a relationship is a two-way street. So, he waits as patiently as Dean did for him.
face that woman remembered. That she’s
It’s dark. That’s the first thing he notices. The curtains are drawn, and Cas can only make out dim outlines through the sliver of light that slips through. A part of Cas wants to run from this room, but a larger part of him is tired of running. So, he strides to the curtains and yanks them open, letting the bright wintry light bathe the room for the first time in months. Cas slowly turns around to survey the only things he has left of his brothers.
Cas leans back where he sits on the sofa, letting out a happy sort of sigh. He continues to stroke Dorian with one hand, and reads his book with the other. He finds it hard to concentrate, though, his heart (metaphorically) racing in an odd mix of anticipation and anxiety as the clock ticks closer and closer towards Christmas.
“Can’t go back. Please no,
They say their goodbyes and Cas heads inside, his mind already conjuring lists of what he should pack.
He hears the clack of practical heels coming down the hall and the same nurse from this morning walks in, holding a large plastic bag.
After about twenty minutes of first-day-of-schools and class picture days and the ever-popular oh-god-these-should-be-burned middle school photos, etc., Cas finally finds what he’s looking for. He pulls it out, laughing a little at the sheer absurdity of what he’s about to do, and puts the box back in its place.
“I get it, it’s a bit dusty,” Cas says, cutting her off with a chuckle.
They begin the drive in silence, Cas absentmindedly looking out the passenger window, watching the streetlamps pass them by one by one, illuminating them in sickly yellow in turns.
Cas nods, still processing. It seemed just as everything in his life was starting to finally veer its way into something resembling normal, the world had yet again decided to pull the rug out. Already feeling the onslaught of a spiral at the prospect of the unknown, he feels he needs a plan. He takes a deep breath. “What are my next steps, Dr. Singer?”
thinks Cas happily. His fingers dance over the touch screen.
He takes a minute to apply his cover-up and insert his contacts, not wanting to risk venturing out of the house without them, no matter how isolated the area. Another of the many things he appreciates about Charlie’s friendship is that he doesn’t have to hide with her. Since the day they met, he’s never felt the need to put on his artificial living façade. Mask or not, she treats him no differently.
Dean smiles. “You’re welcome. Come on, I’ll walk you in.”
Cas expects a feeling akin to a hard punch in the stomach when he looks at the pictures, but is instead surprised to find the feeling more like a sharp poke rather than a full on blow.
But no, Cas self-corrects, it wouldn’t be
“I see your point. Although, I did think it would be a bit more interesting than ‘lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?’”
He makes his way to the large hall where the group therapy is held, picking a random empty chair amongst the many groups, about six or seven per. The discussion leader waits a few minutes as more people file in, and then starts up.
He looks at himself in the hallway mirror as he’s about to leave, adjusting his unkempt hair. It predictably pops right back into place again, and Cas just sighs in defeat before practically flying out the front door to greet the driver of the Impala currently idling in his driveway.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the fifth replay, he’s singing along and bobbing his head, occasionally spinning around if the mood strikes him.
The mystery novel serves as a tangible reminder of all the things that Cas’ family is unable to do now. Everyone always assumes that they have all the time in the world to accomplish the things that they want to, it’s just how people get through life. However, now Cas knows the truth and he finds it deeply distressing – as anyone surely would when they’re suddenly faced with the crushing realization of their own mortality. The harsh reality of the situation is that in the span of as little as a few seconds – a flash of headlights, a scream, a last look filled with sad resignation – everything you ever held dear can simply cease to exist. Just like that.
Castiel makes his way back to his room and flops down on his bed, breathing a sigh of relief. He picks up the packages and opens them, tossing the empty boxes aside. He toys with them, glancing at his dresser with its adjoining mirror, before getting up and slowly making his way towards it. He closes his eyes tightly as he turns to face the mirror directly. He tries to avoid the mirror whenever possible, but he can’t put on his cover-up without it. He slowly starts to open his eyes.
For the rest of that night and all the next morning, Cas’ internal settings get stuck on a single mode: frantic. He runs around his room, haphazardly throwing things into an old duffle bag, trying to prepare for anything he might need on this impromptu getaway.
“You’re damn right I am.”
Cas chuckles a little at Charlie’s teasing. He smiles as he types out his next message.
“You dooo.”
Bobby shakes his head. “Don’t give me that look, son. You wouldn’t have come here if you thought I was gonna squeal, so we might as well go inside and you can fill me in on just what the hell is happening.”
And if Cas’ heart aches this badly just from hearing it second hand, he can only imagine what Dean must be going through.
“Just barely,” he replies.
him, but he has to keep going, he has to get out, he has to–
Charlie opens the door and Cas lunges at the first thing he sees, which is Dean by design. Cas’ body collides with full force into Dean’s, knocking the wind out of him. Cas’ jaws are snapping left and right as Dean tries to push him away. They wrestle each other to the ground and all Dean can hear is the blood pumping in his ears and Cas’ animalistic snarling. This is all too much for him, but he attempts to remain focused, shoving every ounce of power and strength into keeping the both of them safe. Surging with newfound energy, Dean manages to roll them over and pins Cas to the ground. Cas struggles, trying to bite and claw and gauge his way out of the hold, but Dean remains steadfast and determined, eventually managing to pin both of Cas’ arms down.
“Hi, Dean, I’m– Holy crap, Cas! What did you do to him?” Sam cries once he takes in the scene before him.
to! But no, you just had to be
“Dean,” Cas says, his voice choked with a sudden rush of emotion. He finds he’s embarrassingly incapable of more than the single syllable.
“But that’s just it, we
Cas walks her to the door and closes it behind her, already worrying about what Charlie’s reaction to the letter will be.
In his mind’s eye.
“I meant what I said before, that we don’t have to. We’ll go as far as you’re comfortable. But… Cas, if the only thing holding you back is your worry that I’m not going to want you? Then you’re fuckin’ crazy.”
Cas opens the passenger door and easily slides into the front, throwing his duffel into the back seat before turning to face Dean.
Cas and Dean look at each other, immobile, eyes wide in panic. The slamming of the car door sends them into action. They both jump off the couch and Dean looks around wildly as Cas stands there unsure of what to do.
His hands come away wet.
Dean shrugs a little, staring at his shoe that he absentmindedly scuffs against the floor. “It is what it is. S’not so bad; I still see him every once and a while.”
“You know what I mean!” he replies with a chuckle, bumping his shoulder into hers. Charlie laughs before pegging Cas with a skeptical stare.
As Cas’ gaze is fixed to the screen where Luke is burning the body of his newly discovered father, he absentmindedly goes to stroke Dorian, who is currently lying on the couch between the two boys. When he reaches out, however, he makes contact with Dean’s hand, who’d apparently had the same idea. Cas looks over to him, startled, and Dean does the same thing. They both pull their hands back. An awkward moment ticks by.
—and Cas isn’t sure if he has the courage to let it be seen.
Dean clears his throat pointedly. “What am I, chopped liver?”
“Your coat. Unless you plan on holding it like that the whole damn time,” Dean says without the malicious edge a comment like that would usually hold.
Dean nods and grins slightly, his expression looking distant and far away, seeing memories long-passed. Cas decides to leave Dean to his happy musings, and is content to look out the window at the passing scenery.
Fun fact: that whole scene where Cas was in the closet, I actually wrote that while sitting in my friend's closet ahaha XD I needed some extra inspiration because not being claustrophobic myself, I needed to immerse myself in a small dark space :P So shoutout to my friend Bryce for letting me just chill inside his closet for about a half hour ;D
Cas considers just telling him to alleviate his worries, but a more childish part of Cas wants to keep his newfound friend a secret for now until Dean can see Dorian for himself.
“Tell me you didn’t,” she says, her voice deadly serious. Cas inadvertently shrinks away from her, just a little.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
“Cas?” he asks.
When Dean steps back to leave, Cas is half expecting the familiar clap on the shoulder. He’s not expecting the gentle brush of his arm accompanied by a soft smile.
“For what?”
All pins are knocked down in one fell swoop.
“What the fuck are you talking about?”
He takes a deep breath and knocks three times.
“I thought you might like that,” he says, still chuckling.
“What.”
Dean must notice this too because he cranks it up a notch. He winds up his leg for a kick, and for one wild moment Cas tenses in expectance of a blow he should know won’t be coming. He wonders what that means, but decides now is not the best of times to puzzle it over. Dean’s leg kicks out and although the toe of his boot makes contact with Cas’ stomach, it’s only just. Enough to make it look as though a blow had been landed. Dean looks at Cas with slightly widened eyes and raises his brows expectantly, and it’s only then that Cas realizes he evidently hasn’t been reacting enough. He nods slightly and gestures vaguely for Dean to keep going. The Jeep has fully stopped now.
Cas laughs, “No, but really. I did.”
So, Cas doesn’t say anything at all.
The last sentence is said in a way so reminiscent of Dean that Cas can’t help the small chuckle that bubbles to his lips. “You’re right. But I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know what makes me happy.”
EDIT JAN.23rd: Hi everybody, so a little bit of bad news... I was trying to get a chapter up for the month of January (with my new goal being at least one chapter a month), but I just don't think it's gonna happen this month. I have to play some SERIOUS catch up in one of my uni courses so for the next two weeks I'm studying and reading hardcore so I can rewrite some things. So I'm doing that on top of my regular school work, and unfortunately I just don't have the time to write Chapter 11 :( But I'll see you guys in February for sure with an update!!! Sorry I'm such a butt with my slow updates, thank you for sticking with me ily <3
