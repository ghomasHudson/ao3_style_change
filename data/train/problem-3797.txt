“Yes. Dad says regardless of how advanced the education, schools will never care enough to properly feed students because they benefit from the lethargy.”
Dr. Mills chuckles knowingly, sliding her hands into the pockets of her coat. “I see. You’re not the first omega to have this problem — though I’d say most wish their problem was their alpha being too careful.”
There’s a long silence where they can hear nothing except the dialogue from the movie playing in the next room. Dean stares at his best friend, too many thoughts tumbling in his head for him to formulate a full sentence.
They get a table by the window and after a few more minutes of grumbling under his breath and stubborn stalling, Dean opens his mouth enough to place an order. They make small talk about work and family until their lunch arrives and Dean finally tries to get to the bottom of this last-minute rendezvous.
It was the perfect year because his parents were on some haunted house tour in Europe and Grandmother had passed years ago so Cas didn’t have to worry about sending her to an early grave when he put Santa and his eight reindeer on top of her house. Gabe had inherited the old Victorian but he and Cas were sharing the space and he’d pretty much given Cas free reign.
Dean moans into the kiss as Brady grinds in his lap. He runs his hands up and down the beta’s broad back, moving down to his ass. Brady bucks against him and nips at his bottom lip, shooting fire down Dean’s spine.
The moment Cas hears his name the bat falls from his hand and he’s still not breathing but for an entirely different reason now. Because he knows that voice, knows it as well as his own, hears it even when they’re not in the same city, state, or country.
“Maybe that’s the way it’s meant to be.” And it hurts to hear that, the idea that Cas — perfect, wonderful, brilliant Cas — believes he’s meant to spend his life alone. Not because there’s anything wrong with being alone, but because it’s clearly not what Cas wants.
Dean laughs as he heads for the door. “Oh no, Dr. Novak. You’re not breaking my clean record.” He slips into his jacket and picks up his bag. “I’ll see you tonight, babe. Love you.”
Each of the Novaks had a gift, a special power beyond the ability to cast. Some had visions, some could read minds, there was a distant cousin who could levitate. There seemed to be no order or lineage linked to the gift one was born with; they each just woke up one day in their adolescence with an ability.
Just three minutes ago they’d been kissing. He had held his best friends in his arms and tasted twelve years of dreams coming true and he had felt Cas in his hands, felt Cas’s hands touching him everywhere like a man on a mission. It was so surreal, Dean would have thought he’d just imagined it — wouldn’t be the first time — but the evidence of their very real encounter is still pressing painfully against the front of his jeans and Cas’s lips are still wet and his clothes rumpled. It had happened.
At that moment Dean is hit with the scent of Cas’s slick and Cas reaches for his hand, pushing it around to his ass where he can feel the wet spot through his pajama pants.
Dean blinked slowly. Everyone was watching him carefully. There was a look of understanding on Sam’s face while Dorothy and Charlie watched him with pitiful gazes. Jess had her head tilted, as if anticipating Dean’s next words.
“Dean,” Cas says at last. “You know you don’t have to tell me anything, but if you ever want to talk about it, I’m always here for you.”
“What’s the crisis, ladies?” Deanna asks and the cheer in her voice makes Cas want to grind her teeth.
God, how much had he had to drink last night? He had honestly lost count. Jess and Jo had just kept pushing them at him and he just kept sucking them down. He couldn’t even remember what he had been drinking.
“You know I don’t have a problem with a beer or two but you can’t be drinking twelve packs on the job. You’re gonna get yourself hurt.”
“Right. Look, Cas, I know you’re mad at me and you said all that stuff about us not being meant for each other and I understand and you have no reason to ever listen to me or anything I ask, but I need you to come with me.”
Brady chuckles and finally stops moving, leans against the sink to give Dean his full attention. “Okay. What’s your news?”
It’s been so long since they last spoke, Dean’s body shivers with it just like when he heard it the first time. But that was many, many years ago.
Cas could see Jess pouting sympathetically. “I’m sorry, Cas. I really hoped things would work out for the two of you.”
Dean waves him off and passes him the plate. “It’s cool, man. She’s a good kid. Plus, I figured you had to be pretty damn desperate to ask me to take care of her. Guess everyone else you called was busy?
Dean can’t properly explain the ache in his gut when he opens the door but it suddenly feels like he swallowed something large and heavy. He thinks it has something to do with the soft glow Cas is letting off, the sort of tired yet satisfied droop in his eyes, the lazy lift of his smile. His scent is soft and relaxing. The picture of a content omega.
Dean’s eyes bugged and he couldn’t help looking down at his crotch. Charlie threw her head back and laughed, drawing attention from the people around them. “Dammit, Charlie,” Dean cursed. “How did you even-?”
Dean and Cas both chuckle as they watch her waddle and clank away, heads leaning together. “Your kid is weird,” Dean says.
Cas refocuses on the spoon, imagines it flipping over or shooting off the edge and hopefully hitting one of his stubborn sibling’s in the head because he’s getting really tired of their bullsht. This is ridiculous and the damn thing is never going to move because Cas is not a-
“I want to kiss this guy I met in college. The most beautiful guy you’ve ever seen. Unfairly gorgeous. His eyes, his hair, his lips, his shoulders.” Cas growls deep in his chest, eyes closing to clearly enjoy a memory. “I used to daydream about his shoulders.”
Cas leans forward, lips pressing into the junction where Dean’s neck meets his shoulders and Dean kisses Cas in the same spot. Their hips continue pumping, Dean’s knot swelling, feeding the barely contained inferno smoldering inside of them and they’re so close to incinerating each other just a little-
Mildred scoffs and instead of shaking his hand, she keeps hold of it. “It’s wonderful to finally meet you, too, but if you call me ma’am again, this engagement party will become a funeral.” Dean swallows and nods. “Now, you come with me. Castiel has been eager to see you.”
Once she could trust them to finish the last few on their own, she left and found Deanna and her crew finishing up. Taking a breath, she finally walks over.
Deanna’s lips quirk at the outburst but she reigns in the smile and reaches for her friend’s hand. Cas lets her take it. “Hey, hey, I know. It’s a lot. But first, everyone knows that none of this is your fault. They know you can only to do your best with what you’ve been given, which isn’t much because Principal Crowley is a dick. And second, I think the theme is cool as fuck.”
He doesn’t know if those are the right words; they seem too simple. Cas makes a watery sound like he’s losing the fight to hold back his tears and Dean wants to crawl over the table and hold him.
When she’s five she and Papa get the same last name as Austen and Daddy. She doesn’t remember the day much except for the pretty dress she got to wear. But she remembers her dads kissing in front of everyone and her Grandma Mary muttering about how it took them long enough.
They spend five beautiful days wandering around the historic cities. Cas takes Dean to all sorts of little shops and cafes and restaurants. He makes Dean eat all sorts of chocolates and fights tooth and nail to drag Dean into a sauna only to basically have to carry the man out. They make love for hours that night, Cas clinging to Dean for all he’s worth as Dean fills him repeatedly and whispers sweet and filthy words into Cas’s ear that have him absolutely mewling with pleasure.
The sounds of gunfire blast from the television following by hooting and hollering and a stampede of horses rushing through town.
“But friends tell friends when friends make them cum five times,” Jo says and sounds genuinely outraged at having been kept from this information. Right before falling into another fit of laughter.
“Good, ‘m good,” Dean says into the stranger’s shoulder before he tries to extract himself. “Where you been, man?”
Cas hums, “Merry Christmas, Dean,” and their lips meet. And it’s soft and easy, natural as breathing and wonderful as only magic could be.
“Yeah, it was real nice of him. Especially since he was ready to beat your ass for fucking with his sperm.”
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean says immediately, letting the words pour from him like they’ve wanted to for years. “I have no excuse. I didn’t even know until something made me remember on Callie’s birthday. I know it means nothing, but I was drunk and upset and I-I was jealous-”
“When you asked me to help you find a donor it killed me because all I could think about was how badly I wanted to give that to you. To be your mate and give you children. But I knew you didn’t want that from me so I tried to be a good friend. When you left I thought I was going to finally move on. I thought I actually had moved on,” Dean amends, daring to take a step closer. “But the second you got back I realized not a damn thing had changed. I’m still in love with you Cas. Have been since freshman year.”
He was attacking a rather redundant paper comparing Islam to Christianity when it was suddenly ripped from his hands. Cas yelped and looked up.
Dean tries to keep his expression neutral and decides to take the safe route and shrug his shoulders.
Dean tingles under Cas’s touch and he grins. “Damn right,” he purrs, eyes dropping to Cas’s lips and Cas starts to lean in. “But first…” Dean reaches behind Cas and pulls the abandoned mistletoe from the counter. “I want to look at this!”
As Charlie speaks, the night starts to come back to him — at least the beginning of it. He definitely remembers opening the invitation from Meg and snarling when a bunch of confetti sperm had fallen all over his floor. He remembers dreading the event and purposefully taking extra hours at work that night so he’d have an excuse not to go. He remembers ignoring Cas’s calls and texts that day because every time he thought of Cas pregnant with someone else’s child, his chest ached and he didn’t know how to stop it.
“Now, I want the alphas to sit behind their omega, bracing your partner between your legs,” she says coolly.
Cas watched a bee documentary, one he had seen many times. Eventually, he was able to fall asleep on the couch.
Deanna had made two goals that night and when they’d met up afterward, Deanna still in her uniform which was clinging to her everywhere it could and her eyes still bright with victory and adrenaline, she told Cas how she loved knowing Cas was there, part of the thunder. Cas has hardly missed a game since.
Cas pulls back, a look of distaste on his face. “Didn’t you say taking suppressants messes with your cooking? Because you can’t smell things right?”
Cas did as he was told, throwing on some dark jeans and a sweater. He grabbed Sam’s present, still in the bookstore’s bag.
Bobby knocked him out of the way on time. Dean hit his head pretty hard against the concrete ground, but in the scheme of things that was like being tapped by an empty water bottle.
Cas rolls his eyes then angles his head. Dean nods and they slip away to the kitchen. Dean represses a whistle. He may not like the guy but Balthazar has a nice kitchen.
Dean’s smile lingered for a few more seconds before he turned his head to look out his window. “We’re here.”
“Won’t Dean notice when Cas stops putting giant wreaths on every door to cast a circle in the middle of his apartment?”
Dean’s hand comes to cup Cas’s chin then, tilting his head back, and he stares into Cas’s eyes. “I’ve wanted to kiss you for so long, Cas,” he says and he looks at Cas’s lips again. “I’ve always wondered what they’d feel like.” His thumb circles over the corner of Cas’s mouth, a gentle but Earth-shattering touch. “Can I feel them now, Cas? Please?”
She’s here too. Cas sees her fight through the thick of the crowd until she reaches Dean and he smiles, big and bright, and throws his arms around her, lifts her into the air and she laughs.
But it was over. That’s what Cas had to hold onto now. He and Dean were over. It was resolved. They had parted on… cordial terms. They could move on.
Cas doesn’t know how to respond. That’s literally impossible. He and Dean had fooled around a few times, but they hadn’t actually mated or bit each other yet. Without the bite, they couldn’t be real mates.
“God, I’m such a dick—I didn’t mean—God, Cas, I can’t do anything right. I’ll just—I’m sorry—look, I’ll go so you don’t-”
Cas and Claire look up to find its their turn. Claire takes off immediately, Cas following much slower and cautiously. He tells himself that Dean probably won’t even recognize him. It’s been eight years and unlike Cas, Dean has surely been able to find someone new, someone to erase all memories of some college flame.
The body moving away freezes. Cas frowns at their figure and takes a few tentative steps toward them. She thinks she can make out light hair and the person is obviously in a suit but they’re very small for a man.
Dean meets her eyes and gives a nod like it’s his death sentence. The air in the next moment certainly feels colder, more threatening.
Benny nods, lips frowned as if to say he understands. His hand squeezes Dean shoulder before falling back to his side. “Don’t worry, brotha, we’ll find you someone.”
Dean glowers at the teasing. “Don’t be a jerk. It’s... I really like them. I think I’ve liked them for a long time.”
Wildfire rushes through Dean and he’s hard in an instant, mouth gone dry. “Thrusting,” he echoes and his voice is low, deep in his chest.
Dean had been wholly unprepared to hear those words and they had triggered a flood of emotions that crashed through him like a tidal wave. Happiness, pride, glee. Guilt. Sorrow. Shame.
“I’m going home,” Brady shouts back at him. “I’ll have someone call you when your things are ready to be picked up.”
Dean keeps smiling and Cas doesn’t understand why he can’t look away from it, why he focuses so much on the pink of Dean’s lips and how wonderfully full they are. Almost feminine in shape. An odd physical trait for an alpha but… very appealing.
“Yeah, I, uh, sorry.” He shakes it off and starts moving with the rest of the crowd on the sidewalk, trying to get his mind right. “Did you say you were moving back?”
“I’ve learned the hard way.” His eyes slide behind Dean to where all his paperwork is laid out. “I see you have great plans for a Friday night.”
“I’m a food snob?” Cas finally looks up, his smile big and disbelieving. “This coming from the man who refused to eat fast food while in culinary school?”
Cas forces himself to stop looking and just drinks his beer, refuses to think about the celebration last year when Dean lifted Cas into the bar and screamed we did it, sweetheart! Before kissing Cas long and hard and barely appropriate for a public space right there in front of their friends and what felt like half of campus.
Dreaming up a few more ideas for how to lovingly irritate his boyfriend tomorrow, Cas closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep.
Cas felt choked. He leaned in to wrap Charlie in another hug. “Oh, Charlie, I’m so happy for you. Congratulations.”
“I talked to Dr. Mills today,” Cas breathes against Dean’s neck, pressing a wet kiss at the column of his throat.
Cas groans and runs his hands down his face. “I don’t even know. I told Balthazar that Callie wanted a cowboy western party and we were going to do it at the park but then he insisted on having it here and that he would take care of everything and somehow it turned into-into this!” Cas’s hands shoot up into the air, his voice booming, and Dean can smell the distress coming off of him. “And now my daughter is crying and won’t even talk to me and-and it’s her birthday and she’s miserable!”
And the more he didn’t want to go tonight. Because that meant seeing Dean and Cas honestly just didn’t know how to handle it.
In reality, Cas had spent the first month after their relationship ended avoiding Dean like the plague. He had been the one to call things off and the idea of seeing Dean, having to relive the hurt he had caused, Cas couldn’t bear it.
“Cas,” he cuts her off with was is probably the most stern tone she’s ever heard out of her classmate who still swears by sock puppets and gives out hugs like free candy. “We can handle cleaning up without you here to guide us. Go take care of your business.”
And Dean all but explodes because he doesn’t know how else to say it. “I switched them Charlie! I-I think I did something to Balthazar’s and I replaced with mine!”
“You really didn’t think I would recognize your legs?” Cas asks as fury floods through her. “What the hell are you doing here?”
“You know, you two should come over for dinner some time. I’d really like you to meet Brady, get to know each other.”
Dean’s eyes wander to the other side of the room where Balthazar was standing, all the color drained from his face. “Him,” Dean answers and looks back at Cas.
“I can’t,” Cas interrupted, his voice slightly louder than he intended. He took a breath. “I can’t, Sam. Your brother made it very clear that he… that he never wanted to see me again. And aside from what happened last night, I will… honor his wish.”
The figure reaches back into the kitchen and light spills into the hall, illuminating the man before him. He stands there in crisply pressed dress blues, looking stern and intimidating but as he removes the hat Cas is met with soft green eyes and it’s like all the soldier melts out.
Cas looks up at Dean, half expecting the man to look nervous or reluctant. But Dean just crawls into position, settling behind Cas, with his legs on either side.
But there were a select few that Dean clung to, that ended in the same way Dean and Cas used to begin their days.
“It’s only my third,” Dean promises. “We have a long way before we reach Twister levels of destruction.”
“You had no right to come barging in here,” Sam ranted on with the same amount of fury but his volume much softer. “You can’t just go out and make an ass of yourself and then come running to Cas when you need someone to take care of you. You don’t get to do that anymore. And that’s on you..”
Dean doesn’t know what to say. Cas looks like he’s just had a life-changing revelation and Dean feels like he’s treading muddy water, an ocean of bad memories and self-deprecating thoughts without even a light to guide him.
She sees it and it’s all the confirmation Dean needs. His chest swells tight and it’s like he can feel his inner wolf howling with pride and happiness. A child! He has a child — an
They never talked about him — they weren’t allowed to. But Dean could see the toll it was taking on his friend to lie, could practically smell Cas’s questions and concerns on her even after her scent-neutralizing shower and the sterile clothing she always had to change into. One time it got so bad, Dean flipped a table trying to escape.
“Well, I was talking to Callie, trying to help Cas calm her down after Balthazar made her mad.” Dean imagines the scene in his mind, can still feel the warmth of Callie’s little hand clinging to his leg, can smell the distress and comfort Cas was putting out, clearly upset but still trying to care for his daughter. “All of a sudden Brady got mad and stormed out and I followed him outside and he said… something really weird.”
“Ya nev’r asked me how I was doin’. “’s rude,” he said with all the righteousness a drunk man could muster.
Before Dean can even react, Cas snatches the brochure and drops it back on the receptionist’s side of the desk. “Well, he’s not interested. He’s here to help me. So if we could get the registry or whatever it is now, that would be great.” And he ends it will a smile sharp enough to cut glass.
Callie slows down enough so they’re side by side and looks up at Dean. “You’ve known him for a long time, haven’t you?”
“Well I’m hoping that I’ll finally get to kiss you,” Dean replies easily, eyes dipping down to Cas’s lips. “And maybe a little more afterward.”
Dean melted. To think that after all that had happened, Cas was still worried about offending him. He couldn’t help it when his hand reached over to wipe Cas’s hair from his forehead. For a second, he thought Cas leaned into the touch. His big blue eyes blinked up at him. Dean smiled. “No, Cas. I’m not mad. I’m glad you finally get to go. I just want you to be happy.”
Something in Cas’s chest drops as he watches the show of high school love and affection, marvels at how simple it looks but knowing just how complicated and nerve-wracking it truly is.
“Cas!” Jess cheered when he was in range. She stood to hug him and Dean had never wished to be Jess before, but in that moment he would have given anything for long blonde hair and boobs.
Cas considers prying but bites her tongue. She doesn’t need to know anymore than she already does or she’s just going to hurt herself.
The teams wins and the whole city goes mad. Charlie and the rest of their group races to the bar downtown they know the team will be heading to and Cas is dragged along with them. They get a table near the back and Cas sits quietly with his beer.
“No, let me,” Deanna pleads. “I was an ass and I wasn’t thinking about you. I know this is harder for you — it shouldn’t be, but it is and I’m sorry for not being more understanding.”
Cas jumped up like there was a gravitational pull away from Dean. “I, uh, I’ll clean this up. You should probably go take a shower. I’ll have more tea waiting when you’re done.”
“Why would you… why would you even volunteer to take care of him? You could have just left him at the bar. Or Ellen could have taken care of him.”
Cas slid into one of the stools. “Why are you in my house?” he whined. “What happened? Please don’t tell me we-”
Callie’s stoic expression melts away the second she sees the food. She hops in her chair, mouth practically drooling as she grabs for her burger.
“Oh, you think I’m here for you? I was just trying to find a quiet place away from all that. Ya know, old age and all that. You seen your dad?”
“I could never forget it,” Dean murmurs. His other hand comes to lie on Cas’s hip. “You were so cute, I could barely keep my hands to myself.” Cas sucks in a deep breath. “But then again, I have that problem constantly when I’m around you.”
Dean looked at his glass, dark laughter shaking his chest. “Yeah, well, breaking promises is kind of what I do best.”
Dean shakes his head and unclenches his fists helplessly. “You know me, Cas. What could you have said that you honestly think I would have believed?”
“Of course, but I need to know, Jess. I deserve to know what caused all of this. It’s like he’s protecting something.”
The second half of the class is breathing exercises. Donna instructs everyone to scoot off of their chairs and push them back toward the walls so they have plenty of room.
After Dean left on Sunday, Cas had spent the entire day in bed. He mostly slept. A phone call from Anna woke him around 4:00. Cas ignored it. Around 5:00 he actually got up and went to the kitchen. He found a plate of Saltines on the counter and nibbled on one as he pulled a can of Sprite from the fridge. The broken mug had been cleaned up and Dean had washed the dishes from breakfast.
“Yeah, by their scents. But I’m not meeting these alphas in person. I just want a second opinion before I choose the other father of my child. And there’s no one I trust more than you.”
Charlie shrugs her shoulders, sending her red hair over her back. “I’m not the one in denial of my feelings.”
“Are you kidding? No, this is amazing news!” Without thought his body carries him forward and he gives Cas the hug he knows needs to be given. “I’m so happy for you, Cas,” he says while Cas can’t see his face.
“Oh my god, Dean!” Sam tried to help him back to his side. Dean’s eyes were cloudy and unfocused as he looked at Sam’s face. “Are you okay? Hold on, I’m calling an ambulance.” Sam pulled his phone out of his pocket only to have Dean slap it away.
Dean had always had a habit of making Cas think he was having a heart attack. There were things he did or said that would make Cas’s heart flutter like the wings of a hummingbird until he was sure it would break from his chest. Or sometimes Cas felt like his heart stopped altogether. This time it felt like Cas’s heart was choking, so he mirrored Dean and looked away.
She stretches out on her tiptoes and smacks a kiss on his cheek. “No promises!” And then she’s gone.
Dean brings the cup closer with his shaky hand and can’t help but laugh a little. This is the shit Cas has to basically inject himself with later? Somewhere in this cup is Cas’s future child?
Dean just waves it off. “No sweat, Cas. Anything for you.” He says the words and almost wants to take them back — not because they’re not true, but because he’s terrified as he realizes just how true they are.
He hears Benny’s laughter as the man disappears into the fridge. “You’ll understand when you’ve got a pregnant mate at home.”
A smirk curls Dean’s swollen lips, all sorts of cocky and as obnoxious as it is endearing. “Oh, trust me, sweetheart,” he drawls, “you have no idea just how bad.” His hand lowers to the front of his jeans and Cas blushes.
“Dean that’s crazy!” Charlie cries, looking more serious than Dean has ever seen her. “I mean, you and Cas never hooked up. And we know for a fact that Cas used a donor. We were literally at the party where he got inseminated.”
Those first few months had been some of the scariest of Sam’s life. He had never seen Dean so destroyed. And the worst part, for Sam, was having no way to fix it because Dean had been the one to set the detonator off on himself.
Cas was a quiet guy, but he wasn’t exactly the nervous type. There were actually very few things that got to Cas. But Dean had. Dean had seen a type of anxiety that boarded on fear in Cas’s eyes. And he had put it there.
Dean’s begins to stroke faster, more precum easing the way. Twists his wrist a little at the tip. Make it tighter. Tight like Cas’s—
The line moves and Claire pulls him forward. He tries to redirect his attention to his niece instead of staring at Santa like a maniac.
Cas tries to take a deep breath and calm down. “No, I know. But I’ve been so angry with you and I felt like I was going insane because I kept thinking you were… I don’t even know. I can’t believe you were going through that without me. Who- was it because of Brady?”
The front lights go out and Dean is left alone in the kitchen, his sanctuary of stainless steel and soft buzzing machinery. It smells sterile, just the slightest whiff of lemon to curl your nose and please your lips. The fluorescent lights hum above him as he slides onto a stool and pulls out the paperwork he needs to complete. It’s without a doubt his least favorite part of the job and he can’t say he missed it at all. But the rest of it, that he had missed dearly.
“Einstein was a theoretical physicist, Dean, not an herbalist,” was Cas’s grumbled response. “And, no, I don’t have a second.”
Dean tries to shake off the heat rushing through him and waves a hand at himself. “Um, it’s it obvious, Cas? Whom else would you entrust your safety of your child to?”
He trudges back up front, slower than before, and smiles when he sees the shadowed figured in the door. “What?” he calls as he walks across the dining room, “did you forget the tiramisu you made for Andrea, too?”
He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Cas’s jaw. Cas didn’t move so he continued, letting his lips tremble gently up to Cas’s ear, licking the thin skin just behind it, then down the curve of his jaw and he felt Cas relaxing under him
“Around 4 a.m. Woke up starving and talking my ear off. Kid has a weird fascination with her own puke.” Dean wrinkles his nose.
“Not if your powers are just not developing. There could have been a change, for whatever reason, and if that’s the case there’s one more thing we can try to prove it.”
Dean laughs and bumps his shoulder into Cas’s. “How was your meeting?” All the amusement in Cas’s face disappears and Dean frowns. “Cas? Is everything okay?”
The shed is hot and could use some better lighting but she can make out the array of tools lining the walls on pegs or tossed into the dozen-and-a-half tool boxes Deanna shares with her dad. This is where they work on cars together, usually some old classics John lucks into at junk yards.
Whiskey carries him through a downright hostile game of Trivial Pursuit because — as they’ve told Charlie a million times — nobody fucking likes Trivial Pursuit.
Cas’s head whips up and his body goes through a dizzying rush of responses: excitement, embarrassment, a little shame even, and confusion.
If Kara notices the discomfort she doesn’t show it, just laughs at the two of them and says, “Oh you have to tell me some horror stories about high school Dean.”
“Hard to believe someone as gorgeous as you doesn’t have someone special,” Dean whispers, drawing Cas’s attention again.
Sam nodded as he fought to take a breath. “Yeah, yeah, I’m good. So, ugh, India, huh? What takes you there?”
Deanna had been collecting offers since March. It wasn’t surprising. Deanna was universally beautiful with her long blonde hair, flawless freckled skin, and bright green eyes. And there wasn’t a person in their school who she didn’t call friend. She’d been asked out by someone from all circles, from the theater club to the third baseman of the baseball team. But to Cas’s knowledge, she still hadn’t accepted any.
“So when are all these people leaving?” Dean whispers. “Think you could just move them out with your powers?”
“Dare,” Cas says, folding his arms over his chest, and Dean knows he’s just trying to be difficult but he goes along with it.
“I-I” Cas stutters and looks around uncomfortably. “No,” he finally says, shaking his head. “I don’t hate you.”
When that was done, he went on a run. His goal had been two miles but he barely made it one. He really needed to start working out more regularly.
Eventually they spot Cas and Balthazar and head over. As they get closer Dean can see Cas and Balthazar are engrossed in what looks like a rather heated conversation so he starts to back off. But then Cas looks up and catches him and for a moment he almost looks relieved. But then it’s gone and he’s smiling pleasantly and gesturing Dean and Brady forward.
Carefully he lifts Cas off of his lap. He doesn’t miss the excitement on Cas’s face as he settles back into the pillows while Dean climbs between his legs. Dean takes his time undressing Cas, pulling off his pajama bottoms and his underwear, then lifting his shirt over his head.
The last bell finally rings and Cas makes her way to her locker. Every part of her just wants to go home but she has a few hours to put into the gym at least and then homework before she can just face plant into her bed and ignore the world.
“You could have died, Dean! He at least deserves to know the truth of why he hasn’t heard from you in two months.”
Dean gestured down at himself. “Cas, come on, that looked like someone was purposefully unzipping my jacket. And earlier, I told you it felt like someone grabbed my ass.”
His best friend is grabbing at his crotch, fighting some invisible force for the possession of his pants. “Cas!” he yelps, tugging the zipper back up, “what is- oh my god!” He finally manages to reclaim the zipper and pulls it up and buttons them up. When he looks at Cas, his eyes are wild with embarrassment and fear and Cas wants to die because thoughts are starting to string together-
The kids go back to playing and everything seems to be going smoothly. Dean looks to Brady. “Ready to head out?”
“He works in the religious studies department with Cas,” Sam said. “I’ve seen him around a few times. Friendly guy.”
Mary makes a sympathetic sound. “I can only imagine. Dee’s been out there all day working on a ramp or something.”
And absolutely no amount of willpower can keep back the tears when the two kids race down the stairs until to slide to a short stop when they see Dean sitting next to the tree.
He looks up at his name and wants to die when he spots Dean. He looks out of breath, his chest heaving, and his face is tight with worry. He approaches slowly when Cas doesn’t respond and sits next to him on the bench, leaving an appropriate amount of space.
Before he can think more of it, Meg crashes into him and he can smell the liquor on her breath before she even speaks.
“Look, I was with you through the whole process. You never would have picked someone you thought wouldn’t be good for your child. And you have good judgement. So if you really think introducing Callie to her donor father is for the best and you say he’s a good guy, then do it.”
“And just to make him even more perfect, he’s also funny. And he’s kind, the most generous, loving person I’ve ever met. And so smart. And he’s an amazing cook. I think the first time I knew I was in love with him was when he made me this delicious peanut butter cake for my birthday.” Dean’s eyes snap up in time to catch Cas’s pink tongue licking his lips. “I remember because all I could think about while eating this amazing cake was his scent. It was like I couldn't get it out of my system. Like we were already mated without even having touched one another."
He means it lightly but he sees the way Benny frowns immediately. The giant alpha puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. “Hey man, I know we haven’t really talked about it, but I’m sorry about how things with Brady ended up.”
“You don’t have to say anything,” Deanna says gently. “I just want you to finally know. That I love you. More than anything I ever thought I could love. And I want to take you to the dance. If you’ll have me.”
Dean wandered toward the entertainment center as Cas placed their order. He smiled at the bee figurines and Cas’s geeky movie collection. Cas kept an impressive collection of religious items on the shelves, everything from a wooden cross to a small statue of Buddha. Cas had bought most of them himself, the rest had been gifts from Dean over the years.
Cas stares at him, his face unreadable. “So you left me because you thought I was going to leave you?”
He smiles, trying to look grateful. “Thank, man. Look, you get that back to Andrea before she sets your place on fire.”
They spin toward Donna, spines going rigid like guilty children. Their teacher glides toward them, somehow looking threatening and kind at the same time.
He plays with the tip, circling his thumb over the slip until the first pearl of precum leaks out and he scoops it up, strokes it down his shaft and hisses as the slickness of the movement.
All Cas can focus on is the redness in Dean’s face and the glassiness of his eyes. “I think you’re seriously coming down with something.”
“‘s not like I know... anything about the place... And... ‘s important to you.” Dean shrugs it off and a cough steals what Cas is sure would be a self-deprecating laugh. “I’d probably just... embarrass you anyway."
“You want to go to Amsterdam...?” Cas looks up into Dean’s eyes and the disappointment he finds there cools all the heat raging inside him. “Dean?”
“Well, no. But I feel like it’s my duty to come and make sure my godchild’s first years of life aren’t spent in a beehive.”
Either way by Saturday he was sitting up in bed, finally feeling more in his right mind. Cas came in with his tea tray and Dean immediately recoiled.
The omega’s lips twitch in what may be the premature attempt of a smile. He pushes inside past Dean who is still staring dumbly outside. Because this can’t be real. Cas can’t actually be here.
Kara’s smile turns sweet and she tilts her head back to stare up at Dean whose staring at the ground. “Awww Mr. Perfect.”
Finally, he just chucks it all in the trashcan next to Cas and dusts his hands off, avoiding all eye contact.
“Oh my god, oh my god, are you serious?” She pulls the hat out and just holds it in front of her, jaw dropping.
“Um, your mom is ordering pizza for dinner,” Cas says, breaking it. “Said it should be here in thirty.”
The smug grin softens into a sweet smile and Deanna’s eyes fall to the floor and she rubs the back of her neck. It’s a reaction she has often and it always manages to catch Cas’s breath. Somehow endearing but also heartbreaking because if this was a story, it would be a sign. A giveaway for Cas to know that maybe…
Cas got home and he felt numb crossing the threshold. The racket of last night echoed in his head and for the first time in months, the apartment felt empty. Lonely. Strange.
Cas barks out a bitter laugh, bending to pick up another strand. “No, it seems Balthazar was quite careful in undermining my directions for every aspect of this party except the cleanup part.”
“Side? Really, Dean?” Sam huffed a sarcastic bit of laughter and turned to fetch the bacon from its pan on the stove. He shuffled a few pieces onto each plate. “This isn’t about sides, Dean. This isn’t a game. This is Cas’s life. And you chose not to be part of it. So you don’t get to just come randomly stumbling back in whenever you want. Especially considering the way you chose to leave.”
John laughs off Deanna’s horror-stricken face. “That’s my cue,” he says and grabs his tool box. “See you around, kids.”
Standing feels foreign and a little dizzying once Donna announces they’re finished for the day. Dean gives a big yawn, stretching his arms over his head and trying to shake the sleepiness off. Yoga may not be his thing but damn if he’s not going to have one hell of a great nap later.
When they finally separate, it’s disorienting, like they’ve forgotten how to function without the other and Cas loves it, loves the dizziness and giddiness he feels and knowing that only Dean can make him feel that way. Loves knowing that only he can give that feeling to Dean.
Cas inches toward him, kissing his chin, and Dean is about to respond when Cas’s stomach grumbles again. Cas rolls his eyes. “This will have to wait. Emerson is demanding nourishment.”
Charlie eventually joins him on the couch, not touching but close enough that he can pick up the notes of sympathy in her scent.
When Cas’s lips touched his, it was soft, barely a brush, but wholly earth-shattering. Dean found his hands grabbing onto Cas’s waist and pulling him the rest of the way in.
Cas dropped his computer case on the counter. He saw the dishes by the sink and bit his lip. Dean had washed them. He could tell by the way the plates laid flat on the dishtowel – it had been one of his more bearable annoying habits.
Baby looked far too good for the hybrids surrounding her and you could practically see her nose stuck up in the air as the glow of the sun hit her fender.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine,” Dean stutters, dabbing at himself and avoiding Cas’s eyes. “Just lost control for a second.” He tries to laugh it off but Cas doesn’t seem to be buying it, still standing extremely close and the embarrassment along with the horror he feels at having told Cas about the date is just a little more than Dean can take. “Look, uh, I’m going to change out of this. Do you have anything else in the car?”
He nods his head, answering her unasked question. “I’m gonna do it. Just…” He sucks in a shuddering breath, tries to muster up a smile and even he can taste the salt in it. “Just give me a little time.”
Luckily, the waiter returns then. Dean busies himself signing the receipt and leaving a generous tip.
With careful steps, Sam made his way through the living room and toward Dean’s room. He stopped to knock briefly on the door. When there was no reply, he twisted the knob.
He couldn’t tell Callie that he also wanted to be her dad — that he was, in fact, her other father biologically. He couldn’t tell her that he wanted to spend every day like they had this weekend, watching TV, cooking together, enacting old western scenes in their cowboy hats and collapsing in fits of laughter. Dean’s pretty sure he’s never felt so complete in his life. His alpha had felt so content, like he was finally listening to all of his instincts and doing what he was always meant to.
“Shh, sweetheart, I got you,” Dean whispers when Cas’s movements start to get a little erratic. “I’m finally going to take care of you to the way you deserve.”
“Oh right,” Krissy says and her lips curl in a knowing smile. “Cas mentioned he was going over tonight. Finally gonna work a Christmas miracle?”
Cas watches her for a moment and arches a brow. “So skipping school to batter a car is typical behavior you’ve just been keeping from me for ten years?”
“Anything for you, kiddo,” he says into her sweet-smelling hair. “What do you say we walk back out there and show them there’s a new sheriff in town?”
“Well, kiddo, I know it’s not easy to lose a friend like that. But I’m sure you’ll be able to stay in contact with her. I mean, all these apps and stuff these days. Can’t you just Snapbook her or something?”
She turns with it in hand and Charlie is just behind her. “What is it?” she asks with burning excitement.
The next Saturday, Dean makes up an excuse for a celebratory dinner and tells Cas to get cleaned up.
Cas looks ready to say something when both of their noses twitch, picking up irritated beta. Neither has to look to know who it’s coming from. Cas makes a little noise in the back of his throat, smile taking a slight edge before he moves away.
“Yeah? Well it’s about to get better,” Brady promises, his voice getting deeper, sultry. The space in Dean’s pants gets tighter and Brady grins when he feels it. “Ready to go to bed?”
They’re seated in a booth and Dean asks about her day. He and Lisa have had a thing — he supposed that’s the best word for it — for a little over a year, since she joined the staff at Lawrence High. It’s mostly been harmless flirting around the school and a few dates here and there. Never anything official. He liked Lisa — she was smart and kind with a sense of humor, but there had never been a real spark between them.
Bobby glowered from under the rim of his trucker cap. He eyed Dean’s beer. “How many is that today for you?”
Behind Anna, the whirring of the mixer stops and she hears Cas approach. “Did you bring everything I asked for?”
Things pick up gradually as more time passes until it’s like no time has passed at all and you’re lucky to catch one without the other.
Dean looks at him, face sour. “Pretty sure if dairy was a danger to pregnant people, I wouldn’t be here because Mom says ice cream was about all she could eat.”
He leads Cas to the impala, hustling to open the door for him which Cas raises an eyebrow at. Dean just smiles and carefully shuts the door once Cas is safely inside.
Deanna shrugs. “Yeah. Once I get the frame done, Charlie and I are going to mold foam around it and paint it to look like stone, and I then I can just attach it to the stage. I already took the measurements.”
“I did.” Cas says it with so much conviction it’s startling and all Dean can do is gape for a moment.
Cas puts his hands on either side of Dean’s face and makes him look into deep blue eyes. “I don’t want to wait for you anymore.”
All of this was happening because of Dean biting his tongue all of these years and his body refused to keep the secret even a heartbeat longer.
Cas avoids her eyes, not wanting to betray any information she wasn’t ready to share. “I don’t want to go anymore.”
She slipped past Dean, and he turned, watching as she headed toward the door. “Where are you going?”
Cas looked down at the table. “It’s mostly for work. There’s this temple in western India that I’ve always wanted to see. I-I’ve been planning this trip for a while.”
A quivering sort of sadness settles in his gut and draws his lips down in a frown. He spends a few minutes just sitting and staring at the pile of presents, the chill of loneliness seeping into his bones.
Dean freezes mid-stride in the middle of pedestrian traffic and gets his toes smashed for it. “Ow, fuck!” he hisses into the phone.
“Scoot as close to your partner as possible,” Donna continues as she circles the class, observing their positions. “Omegas, you are going to lean back and your alphas will be there to support you.”
Dean felt lost in time, hearing all of his closest friends talk about their daily lives and seeing Cas smiling right in front of him as he listened.
Cas clucks his tongue. “You’re right; Michael is a dick. I guess you would be the best option, Dean.”
Dean can’t help but notice the way Callie sinks into her chair. He swallows around the disappointment forming in his own throat and musters up a smile. “Well… that’s great, Cas. I’m happy for you.”
They sneak up the stairs to get Dean cleaned up and changed into his soft Christmas pajamas. Then, Dean finishes wrapping the gifts — which look much neater than Cas’s — while Cas sets up the presents from Santa — a bike for Juniper and a monstrous Paw Patrol tower for Caydon.
Somewhere in the distance they pick up on squealing and bright laughter and it leads them into the belly of the beast: a living room redecorated in wall-to-wall pink fabric and an army of a dozen or more little girls frollicking around in pajamas and positively screeching. There are adults moving around in fucking tuxes with gold serving trays of what looks like — fucking champagne? And hour d’oeuvres? And there in the back hanging from the high ceiling is a long banner proclaiming, HAPPY BIRTHDAY CALLIE!
Similar to that moment, Cas feels like she can’t look at her friend, can’t say a word, without destroying everything she’s worked so hard to keep.
“Dean,” Cas says sharply and Dean closes his mouth. Cas stretches up to his tiptoes to kiss him on the lips, comforting him. He’s a lot more affectionate like that lately. Dean not so secretly loves it and Cas loves using it to turn the alpha into a puddle.
He doesn’t get far though when he feels a hand slide into his and pull him to a stop. When he looks back, Dean is staring directly at him, eyes smiling.
Cas felt dread rush through him like ice water washing down his spine and spun around as the front door swung open.
Somehow in all the madness Dean catches his eye and extends a hand. Cas takes it and lets himself be dragged into the dogpile, loving every little giggle and whimper and whispers of I missed you and I love you.
There are no fireworks because those would have been loud and distracting for a moment as precious as this. It’s a quiet, private sort of explosion between them, a galaxy being born and filling with more and more stars with every passing second.
Dean groans as he climbs to his feet, clearing up the wrapping supplies. “Time flies when you’re doing Santa’s work.” He stops to pluck one the the cookies off the plate left out for the jolly toy maker, winking at Cas as he bites off the top half of a snowman.
“No, Jess,” Cas interrupted. “Thank you, but a date is the last thing I need right now. But I will join you.”
Dean was sprawled across the bed on his stomach, eerily still. Sam lunged forward, fingers going to his brother’s throat to find a pulse. “Dean, Dean, wake up! Come on, Dean, wake up!” He found a pulse but it was weak. Sam reached up and slapped Dean’s cheek. “Don’t do this. Come on, you idiot!”
Dean nods and Cas can see his shame, feels his own shame for the coil of excitement warming in his chest.
Cas doesn’t know what to say in this moment, too occupied by the symphony of unpleasant emotions stirring in his stomach. He still can’t believe Dean even remembered the few stories Cas had shared about his previous relationship. He doesn’t make a habit of talking about his time with Gadreel because for the most part there wasn’t much to tell. It had been a borderline arranged marriage between their families, the most honorable way to do away with the two gay sheep of the families and maintain their prestige. There had never been much between the two aside from subdued but pleasant conversation, a lackluster and occasional sex life, and their annual trips to Amsterdam.
“Are you really making a joke right now?” Sam asked, fingers itching to strangle his brother. “I thought you were dead! What the fuck were you thinking?”
Dean’s mouth goes dry suddenly. “Cas,” he says finally. “I don’t understand what’s happening right now.”
Something barrels into Dean’s legs, nearly taking him down. Dean feels Callie nuzzle into his legs and his chest warms with the strong beating like it’s finally working properly for the first time in months. He reaches down to pull the little girl into his arms and she wraps around him with all her might, face buried in his neck.
“I just never personally understood the appeal of them,” Brady says with a shrug. “They get good results though. Decent test scores.”
As if Dean hadn’t hurt him enough, he then had to humiliate him in front of all of their friends — the people who were the entire reason he and Dean had agreed to stay friends after everything ended.
One hand still cups his chin while the other grips his waist and even as Dean’s touch grounds Cas it also makes him feel light and vulnerable, swept away by every lick, nibble, and moan that comes from Dean’s mouth.
Cas is still in a state of shock. Because that’s his boyfriend in a hospital bed. With fucking pneumonia.
“Yeah we were hanging out at your house and you were wearing those hideous reindeer socks and you got so pissed when they almost kissed but the girl backed out.”
“You do tonight! Let’s go!” And like that, Balthazar was whisking Cas to the dance floor. Dean watched as Cas giggled uncontrollably as they found their place amongst the other dancers. Balthazar’s hands dropped to Cas’s waist.
to do anything. I know that. He… he left me. And the things he said, the way he acted, the—the…” Cas couldn’t even get his brain to process the words because he knew it would tip him over the edge. And he had spent a year trying to get away from the edge.
Cas stared at Dean, clearly skeptical. But Dean looked so earnest and desperate, he couldn’t keep the word of permission from slipping past his lips.
Their second kiss is somehow more intense than the first, Cas throwing everything he has into it. After years of dreaming and fantasizing, he finally gets to
But one day when she’s older, she asks them what it means to be true mates and they just smile at each other and reach for their hands.
Charlie rolls her eyes again but seems to admit defeat. “Fine. I’ll let it go for now. But this conversation is not over.”
“There’s a trash can right here if you get sick,” Cas said. “Here’s some water. When you wake up take two Tylenol. I’ll be in the living room if you need anything, okay?”
Cas startles at Dean’s cry, eyes going wide as he watches the zipper on Dean’s jacket lower as if it’s being pulled down… by no one.
Cas spun on his heel and raced for the stairs. He was almost in the clear when he heard, “Hey, Cas?”
“I suppose it’s time to start cutting the cake,” he says, clapping his hands together. “Balthazar, care to help?” He takes the alpha by the hand and the two disappear into the kitchen.
But they had happened. His denial didn’t change the past. And it didn’t help him or Cas get over it.
Dean hears Cas stand and he doesn’t dare move. There a soft murmur of voices and then the front door opens and closes and the room is still.
It’s not that Dean’s never had a crush before, but with his looks and personality they never had to wait long before something came of it (i.e. Lisa, Tessa, Anna, even Cassie from sixth grade — that one had stung for reasons Cas had been too young to understand).
Even with the abnormality of his case, it didn’t take a genius to figure out who Dean’s wolf thought it was mated to. The treatment was surprisingly simple yet agonizing: a couple hormone shots a week and absolute isolation from the person who had rejected him. It was temporary, of course, but Dean’s soul couldn’t understand that and it longed and wailed and begged for the touch of someone it did not belong to.
Dean takes a moment to steel himself and walks closer. Cas doesn’t move but his eyes track Dean until they’re just a foot apart.
He doesn’t recognize the face Cas is making now but it makes him feel hot and like he wants to jump out of his skin but also freeze this moment in time forever so he never has to see anything else ever again. It makes him feel like he’s choking but also breathing properly for the first time in his life. Like they’re the only two left in the entire universe but also like they are the universe at the same time? So unthinkably big but small, everything and nothing. Loved. So incredibly, poetically loved.
“i really think you need to stop living in the past, Jo, and move on-” He cuts off into a laugh when Jo punches him and dashes back out into the party area.
The man had blue eyes. They weren’t nearly as bright as Cas’s but they made Dean squirm all the same as he looked him up and down carefully. Finally, he leaned to shake Dean’s hand. His grip was strong, almost painful and Dean’s eyes narrowed and returned the pressure.
“I’m worried about Dean. I realize you need help filling in while Benny’s away but Dean hasn’t had a day off in almost two weeks and I’m afraid it’s taking a toll on him. Isn’t there anyone else who can help pick up these shifts?”
“Hey.” Strong fingers grip his chin and pull his eyes into two lovely pools of blue. They’re on the verge of fire, promising trouble if not heeded. “Stop thinking about it. It wasn’t your fault.”
Cas thinks about dating, even gets a Tinder. But nothing comes of it because he can’t help but compare everyone he talks to to Dean and accepting that he had the perfect guy and threw him away is a hard pill to swallow.
Cas still sounds broken up on the phone but a lot better than the last call now that he knows his child is home safe. He thanks Dean about a hundred times and apologizes a thousand.
She nods excitedly. “Yes, Santa! I’ve been very good, you can even ask my uncle!” She points at Cas who feels like a deer in headlights. “Tell him, Uncle Cas!”
Claire is looking at him with pleading eyes and it’s enough to kick Cas out of his internal little pity party. He smiles at them and says, “Yes, Santa. She’s been very good this year.”
“Thanks,” Cas replies. “And this- this looks amazing,” she says, gesturing to the balcony. “I really can’t thank you enough for going out of your way to do this.”
Dean frowns around his first pull of beer. “Uh, yeah. I’ve told you about her. We send her birthday and Christmas gifts every year.”
“What? No! Don’ call Sammy.” Dean yawned,his body digging deeper into the couch. “He’ll jus yell at me.”
Everything smells sterile and like nothing. It’s not the normal mix of pheromones and body odors they grow used to over time and it’s downright unsettling.
Cas fills his day with errands and friends. He cleans around the apartment, not that there’s much to clean because Dean is such a neat freak nothing is given the opportunity to get dirty.
Dean smiles and waves his worry away. “‘Course. Just hot. Sorry I’m late but I was tracking down some parts. Figured if I could get them today I’d be able to get off early tomorrow.”
“Congratulations on another good year. I wish you all happy summers and I’ll see you back here in the fall.”
Cas smiles for a moment but then he’s pulling back and smacking Dean in the chest. “Why the hell didn’t you tell me?” he demands, voice far too loud for Christmas Eve night.
“Sorry isn’t good enough, Dean! You left me! You-you just decided that you didn’t want me! You abandoned me during one of the most stressful moments of my life! Twenty-one days! You left me twenty-one days before we were supposed to get married! Who the fuck even does that? And everything you did before that? The drinking? The disappearing acts? And then you couldn’t even tell me why. You just vanished one day.” Cas’s voice lowered as he began to tremble, thinking back on that terrifying day. “I came home and you were just gone. Not even a note. You just…
“I was terrified.” The words fall from his mouth without thought. “Because I thought you were the one too. But no one meets the love of their life at nineteen.”
“Thank you,” Cas says with deep sincerity. He flips to the next profile but Dean’s barely paying attention, too many images of a pregnant Cas in his mind. He’ll be so beautiful with a swollen stomach and probably grumpy as hell. Cas now can barely manage with a minor inconvenience. He can’t imagine how unbearable he’ll become once he’s laden with the extra weight of a developing person and all the stress and horrors that come with pregnancy.
He takes a long swig. “It’s my day off; it’s whatever time I want it to be. And I haven’t been acting funny.”
When Dean hesitated she kicked him again, making Dean jolt against the table. “S-so, Cas,” he gritted out as all eyes shot to him, “wh-what are you working on in India?”
They’re sprawled out on the couch, stomachs full of pizza and cheesy breadsticks and the comforting lethargy only known on Friday evenings in a space that was finally starting to feel like home.
“Dean!” Cas hisses softly, trying to go for admonishment but he knows his grin gives him away as he meets Dean’s eyes, twinkling with mischief.
Cas turns slowly to face his siblings, his mouth opening and closing uselessly a few times as he struggles to find the right words. “I think I’m going crazy,” he settles for.
“I wasn’t going to say that,” Anna says. “Just because we’ve never seen it before, doesn’t mean it’s not true. Your powers could just now be manifesting. We should probably contact Aunt Naomi and Aunt Hael.”
“Oh, you have no idea.” Checking to make sure there’s no one approaching, Cas closes the door and starts to lead Dean toward the party.
“When you said Callie was yours it was like something clicked into place. Like everything made sense for the first time since she was born. And for a moment, it made me so impossibly happy.” A low growl darkens his words near the end. “But then it hit me what you had done and I could have killed you.”
Cas had woken on the couch disoriented. He went to his bedroom to get ready for work and had nearly screamed at the sleeping form in his bed.
The living room is eerily quiet this time of night and dark aside from glow of the Christmas tree. He doesn’t dare turn on the overhead lights or else he’s sure to be ambushed by two pairs of little feet dashing dashing down the stairs. The dark and quiet usually don’t bother him so much. In fact, he used to find it quite romantic, sitting in the twinkling white lights, listening to nothing but the wind outside and falling snow if they were lucky. But that was when he had someone sitting beside him, lost in the mess of last-minute gift wrapping and staging a believable Santa visit.
Everyone else seems to be buzzing, the seniors excited for tomorrow and chatting about their beautiful outfits and how they’re going to style their hair.
Charlie wiggled over to rest her head on Dean’s shoulder. “Then you move heaven and hell to get him.”
The finish eating and Dean gets the bill. He’s telling Lisa about last Saturday when he and Cas went furniture shopping and he had to beg Cas not to buy a guinea pig bed spread for the crib as they exit the restaurant.
“I’m great! Sam, Sam! Look who it is!” Jess was bouncing, her hands clutching Cas’s upper arm like she was afraid he would disappear.
Dean was so flushed with pride that there hadn’t been an ounce of awkwardness when Cas approached him and said, “You did good.”
Dean listens intently, his smile slowly growing into something far more genuine. He leans back and strokes his beard, looking pensive. “That shouldn’t be too difficult. I’ll do my best.”
They stand there for several long seconds in the glow of the light post, neither making a sound other than to breathe.
Cas throws his head back and laughs. “Sorry. She spent a little too much time with her Aunt Anna when we were in Washington.”
“Of course I do. I have… Umm…” Cas perused the shelf and began to feel smaller and smaller as nature and religion documentaries caught his eye. Dean was laughing on the couch and Cas shot him a dirty look. “Oh, shut up. I know I have to have someth- Oh!” Cas pulled a case from the shelf and turned around with a cocky grin.
Cas fought his way back into the lecture, doing his best to answer all questions and concerns about the upcoming exam. His students deserved his absolute best and he refused to fail them. Especially with their grades at stake.
Dean waves it off. “Balthazar, smalthazar. You’re Calliope Novak. His daughter. Who he has dreamt about long before you were even born. Trust me, I was there for all of it.”
There were two empathetic groans as a waitress set three glasses of water in front of them. “Yeah, I’ve been working with Dr. Turner to get the exams for his law classes ready,” Sam said. “There’s only so many questions you can ask about torts before you want to blow your own brains out. I feel bad for these kids but Turner won’t budge. Stubborn old grouch.”
Deanna snorts a laugh and rolls her eyes, but when she refocuses on Cas everything about the way she looks at her friend is soft and reverent. “Because I love you.”
“It’s part of the spell. I figured you’d prefer something with love as well. You want to infuse your emotions with the energy of the mistletoe. So talk about the moment you first knew you were in love with Dean.”
Anna smiles then, small and sharp and almost threatening and Cas has the eery suspicion that he’s just fallen perfectly into a trap.
Cas throws his hands up and falls into one of dining room chairs. “I don’t know! I was just- we were in the garage and I was kind of thinking about him and how I-” his cheeks heat “-how I wanted to touch his chest a-and then his jacket- just started unzipping. On its own.”
There wasn’t much in there. It was mostly clothes, things that had probably gotten mixed into Cas’s wardrobe from years of doing laundry together. He pulled out a blue flannel. He used to love seeing Cas wear it because it brought out his eyes. And there was just something about seeing the person you love in your clothes. Something almost primal that always sent Dean chasing after Cas to pin him down somewhere.
He can’t do this. What had he even been thinking? He can’t cast a lust spell on Dean. Mostly because he one-hundred percent is absolutely not a witch… but also because with the small ridiculous chance that he is, he can’t risk this spell working and forcing Dean to act in way that he normally wouldn’t. Casting a spell on someone without their knowledge crossed all sorts of boundaries on it’s own, but a lust spell? Oh gods, what if it had actually led to sex? Wouldn’t that be assault?
“Hello, Dean,” he says and his voice is rough, almost hoarse. It turns the weight in Dean’s stomach into something even heavier, hurts so much Dean almost presses a hand to his abdomen.
“That’s not the point!” Jess barked. “Cas… I know this is hard. I know. And if you truly don’t want to be with Dean, I can respect that and I won’t push you. But don’t pretend like it’s because you guys don’t belong together. Don’t lie to yourself.”
The table hummed with silence for a moment. Something hit Dean’s shin and his head jerked up to meet Charlie’s angry glare. “Talk to him,” she hissed.
Cas goes taunt, his entire body locking down around Dean and his teeth sink into Dean’s flesh. Dean howls, his knot popping instantly and he bites into Cas. The euphoria that courses through him is harsh and relentless and so damn delicious. He feels himself coming inside Cas, flooding him with his seed and he goes slack-jawed, teeth easing out of Cas as he sinks back against the headboard. Cas slumps against him, head on Dean’s shoulder.
But that’s not an option and nobody cares what Cas wants, least of all these two, the love of his life that he abandoned and the woman who picked up the pieces of Cas’s mistake and found bliss.
“I don’t know,” Dean whispers back. “We probably need to have a conversation about what happened. Guess I should talk to Kara too.”
Dean was standing out in the middle of the hall. He was barefoot, dressed in a gray T-shirt and simple black sweatpants. Cas remembered those sweatpants. He remembered giving them to Dean as a present because Dean always complained about how cold Cas kept the apartment.
Dean sat up as Sam barged into the room, Charlie scurrying behind him. “Heya, Sammy. What’s up, Charlie?”
Castiel buried himself under dozens of religious studies theses, calming himself with familiar theories and using a red pen to take out his wrath on every grammatical mistake he could get his hands on.
“Callie is actually really into cowboys right now,” Cas speaks up for her. “They did a unit on the gold rush at school a few months ago and she hasn’t been able to stop talking about the wild west ever since.”
He felt bad about bailing on the doctor’s appointment though, so he’d sped back into the city, made a few stops, and was hoping to make it home before Cas so he could surprise Cas with dinner.
Cas must have noticed the way Dean was shuffling because he tossed a soft grin over his shoulder and tried to lighten the mood with, “Make yourself at home.”
Cas almost shudders at the word, as if it’s not something he’s heard every day his entire life. “It’s not possible,” he says finally. “I’ve never shown any signs before. I’ve been tested and analyzed by every scryer and healer from here to Belfast and they’ve found nothing.”
Cas is late getting home because a freshman had a break down during office hours. Only after assuring her that a late paper was not the end of the world and she was going to be fine and sending her home with a friend, was Cas able to leave campus.
“Dean,” Balthazar said. “So we meet at last. I must say, Cas, he is every bit as beautiful as you said he was.”
Dean frowns through another breath through his nose, catching no scents. He can’t even smell Cas thanks to the scent suppressing spray that had greeted them at the door.
Dean sighs, energy rushing through him as if he hadn’t just finished a twelve-hour shift and the restaurant. “Dude this is the best news I’ve gotten in months. I-I… I’ve missed you, man.”
He tries to think but it’s really hard with all the alcohol in his system and his whole body shaking because he can’t stop imagining the look on Cas’s face when Dean tells him he ruined this just like he ruins everything and how Cas is going to chop his dick off as payback and Dean can’t even be mad.
“We were still in college and I was studying in the library,” he starts, his voice almost a whisper. “It was late and I was super tired and stressed over a chem test. I’d been a monster all week. Cranky and antisocial and just miserable to be around. I think at one point I threatened to set the Impala on fire because Dean’s alarm woke me up.” Cas laughs wistfully. “But he never lost his patience with me or got mad. He checked in on me that night and he got worried when I didn’t respond so he walked through the snow to bring me dinner.” Cas looks up, joy coursing under his skin and the affection and appreciation he feels hits Anna like a tsunami.
Things started to change near the end of their junior year. That’s when the recruiters really started piling in. Dean was constantly whisked away, meeting with major league coaches, brand consultants, sponsors. Preparing him for his future at the professional level. It was an exciting and proud time for Dean. But it was also incredibly lonely for Cas who had to stay behind and wait.
It wasn’t always easy, had actually involved a lot more late-night pints of ice cream than Dean was proud to admit. There had been times when Dean’s alpha hurt so bad he hadn’t even been able to look at Cas. And the only thing he had to console him were the even darker days when Dean was forced to admit that even if by some wild miracle Cas could come to love Dean, he doubted he would even allow himself to accept. Because deep down, in the very soul of the alpha that guided him, he knew that Cas deserved more than some kitchen grunt.
Dean faintly remembered being hugged before Sam and Charlie led him out of the house. Sam took the keys to the Impala, forcing Dean into Charlie’s bright yellow contraption.
It’s then that the front door opens and Brady hustles inside. “Hey, baby, sorry I’m—” He pauses when he comes upon the table, eyes going between Dean and Callie who are leaning toward each other with intense eyes, between them a helpless Castiel sipping his wine like a lifeline.
He still puts his all in it, swallowing around Cas’s cock until it reaches the back of his throat. He sucks around it, then comes back up, licks his tongue around the tip and then up the bottom of the shaft. Cas’s hand clutch at Dean’s hair as his body continues to jerk and move, riding the pleasure wherever it takes him.
“Since I left him.” Dean tilted his head against the couch, staring at the ceiling as if it was a starry night sky. “April 23. And you know what next month will be?”
Dean throws the invitation across the coffee table and sinks backwards into the couch. “Not happening.”
Cas leaned back against the seat. Yes, what now? He’d waited a year to find out just what had provoked Dean to leave him and now that he knew he had no idea where it left them.
“You know how I never talk about my dad?” Cas nodded but Dean didn’t turn to see it. There’s a good reason. He’s not a good person, Cas. Ever since Mom died. He just hasn’t been right. But every once in a while he likes to come around and pretend to be a good dad again.” Dean took a breath. “He came to see me for my birthday. A week late.” A huff of bitter laughter shook from Dean. “He popped up at Bobby’s first, chatted for a bit, tried to act like everything was normal. We ended up going to Ellen’s that night, Cas, you remember? We were there with Sam and Jess. Dad was there too. He saw us together.”
Dean wants to give in so badly, his entire body screaming for him to give Cas whatever he needs. But he feels Cas’s stomach rub against him and his instincts snap at him to be careful. He can’t risk hurting Cas or the baby, so he can’t give Cas exactly what he wants. But he can give Cas the next best thing.
Dean doesn’t let his nerves ruin his plan as he and Cas stand and he gestures for Cas to walk ahead. He still holds the door for Cas and opens the car door for him, all the while ignoring the strange look on Cas’s face.
The bell rings then and Cas stands, using the table as support. This stomach is starting to become more than he can handle.
Cas nods and keeps his eyes ahead where Callie is skipping down the museum corridor. “Yeah. I, uh, I met Callie’s donor father.”
Dean perks at his little brother’s voice. It’s still weird seeing Sam here, in his home. But it’s good too. It’s been far too long and, while Dean wasn’t happy with the circumstances that had brought Sam here, it did his wolf a lot of good to have his little brother around. Sam had been by his side through his entire discharge process and when Dean entered his apartment for the first time in months it was the sweet scent of their childhood that welcomed him home.
Cas swallowed. “Because Sam has a very loving older brother who I can only assume would also be in attendance.”
It drew a smile from Dean, small but still there. “Yeah, I, uh, can’t stay I’m much better.” The silence grew again and they both looked away from each other. Then Dean, said, “Cas?”
Cas had hesitated just a second before moving his books to the floor. Dean had put out the spread and together they’d gorged themselves for a full hour. By the end there was color in Cas’s face again and he was laughing and damn if that sight hadn’t warmed Dean down to his soggy toes.
For some time, they continue kissing and touching, happy to just familiarize themselves with the bodies they’ve longed after for so long. But slowly, clothing is lost, distributed across the floor piece by piece, and new territory is bared for careful exploration and worship.
“Does Cas know?” The question comes from Gabe and his normally cheerful tone is chilly and Dean can’t help the response of irritation he feels.
“I had a best friend,” Callie says out of nowhere and Dean gives her his full attention. “In Washington.”
Dean watched as Cas’s hand gave his stomach one final pat. At just six months, Cas was finally starting to show, proudly displaying a cute little baby bump under his sweaters. Sometimes it was still jarring for Dean to look at his friend of five years and see the obvious sign of pregnancy. But then he would smile because, truthfully, it was a good look for Cas. He looked happy. Soft.
And even though he knew it was coming Dean still feels it like a blow and terror rushes through him, turning his blood to ice. “I-I can’t do that, Charlie.”
Dean rolled his eyes—well, tried to—and lifted the glass to his lips. He was sloppy and quite a bit dripped down his chin but he got the whole glass down. Cas took the glass before Dean did something stupid with it.
He takes Cas down to the root once more and wriggles a finger below to circle Cas’s hole. Cas’s hips jerk up and then slam down, but Dean is careful. He uses his other arm to pin Cas to the bed as he continues to suck around his cock and rub at his hole which is practically gushing slick. Cas begins to shake.
Cas’s smile was small, almost trembling. “I want you to be happy too.” He reached over and took Dean’s drink. It was gone in one swallow.
They spend the next few minutes just enjoying their meal, no need for conversation as they try to satisfy the rumbling in their stomachs.
“I thought you were supposed to be a professional,” Callie says with a laugh when Dean burns yet another crepe.
Dean gestured toward the door. “I’m gonna go. Um, have a safe flight and, ugh, have a great time in India, okay?” And because he just couldn’t leave otherwise, he stepped forward and pressed a kiss to Cas’s forehead. “Bye, angel.”
“I can see you’re thinking of playing hookie,” Dean says as he returns with the first aid kit. “We’ll be close by each other all day, Cas. And the second that bell rings, I’ll be next to you.”
Dean gives everything another quick glance. “Yep. Should have it all plated and really to consume in fifteen.”
Cas tries not to make a sound when her heart aches and instead runs through all of their close mutual friends who could have piqued Deanna’s interest. Garth? Benny? Victor?
“Dean?” Cas asks carefully, eyes shifting to wear Lisa and her friends stand just outside the throng or dancers, looking at them expectantly. “Lisa is calling for you.”
Dean shrugged one shoulder. “I don’t know, Cas. Kinda. I just wanted you to be happy. And you weren’t gonna get that with me.”
Unfortunately, when Cas got home he had nothing else to distract himself with. He had already cleaned and he didn’t have any work to do. His exams were written, finalized. There were no essays or small assignments to grade.
“Right you are, young Castiel! So go get your ass dressed and let’s roll. I’m gonna be pissed if we miss the cake.”
Dean stumbles into the bathroom and leans against the sink. It’s cool in here and he tries to let it calm the heat under his skin and just breathe. Slow, deep breaths.
“Baby, are you okay?” he asks rushing to the living room and slapping his hand over Dean’s forehead.
“He’s just trying to protect what’s his. And I can’t blame him. How would you feel if some alpha he went to college with showed up out of nowhere and they were hanging out all the time?”
Deanna has her hair pulled into a chaotic bun on top of her head. There are no safety goggles this time and she has a sledge hammer and is going to town on a beat up Camaro.
The bell shrills and books and backpacks start slamming against desks, chairs screeching over linoleum as the students rush out the door.
He catches sight of Cas a few times from across the room. He’s pressed up against Hannah and Dean tries to ignore the nauseous curls of jealousy in his stomach. Cas never looks back at him.
“He’s not Callie’s father,” Dean repeats, his chest heaving in anticipation of his next words. “I am.”
Dr. Mills laughs. “Hey, let’s get through this check-up and then I’ll have you back on your way to that handsome alpha.”
Cas quietly places his bag on the dining table and tiptoes to their bedroom. Sure enough, there’s a large mound snuggled securely under the blankets in their bed, the sound of soft snoring ebbing in the darkness.
Once again, Cas was supporting all of Dean’s weight as he pulled the man closer to the headboard. He wiggled him around until he could get the blanket over Dean’s body.
Sam snorted. “Of course you don’t.” He picked up his fork and began poking at his eggs with a little more force than necessary.
Dean gave him a deadpan look of disappointment. “I found your sex toys my first night at your place.”
She’s on the bed watching Netflix and about to take a bite when the door opens and Deanna walks in in just a towel.
“Wait just a second, young man,” Dean says in his jolly voice. “Don’t you want to sit on Santa’s lap and tell him what you want for Christmas?”
“Oh, right.” Dean smiles sheepishly but takes the few steps to invade Brady’s space, pushing his body against the counter and sliding their lips together. “I’m home, sweetheart.”
Cas was careful not to touch Dean’s skin as he slipped the jeans over his hips and down his legs. He’d be lying if he said the temptation wasn’t there or that seeing Dean sprawled out on their –
Cas went to fetch a trash can from the bathroom. He got a second glass of water and some Tylenol and put them on the bedside table.
Cas smiles because he understands. This change has felt so natural but at the same time a huge adjustment. It’s still a lot to get used to that he can touch Dean like this, look at Dean in certain ways, say things he’s had to bite his tongue on for years.
Cas doesn’t respond for a long time. His eyes drift to the floor and Dean can practically see the gears spinning in his head. Waiting feels like walking the Green Mile but Dean determines to keep his head up and accept his fate.
Jess hadn’t let Cas forget about his promise to go out with them Friday night. And really, when Cas had agreed to go he had meant it. But as the day got closer, Cas found it harder to breathe.
Cas snorts and fetches his rolling pin from the pantry. “Doesn’t my entire existence thus far prove that?”
Dean stands and looks straight at Cas. “All I wanted was to see you crack. Even if it didn’t mean that we could ever be together again, I just wanted a little sign that you had cared as much about me as I did about you. So when you started crying back there... a little piece of me thought.... well,” he breaks off with a sad laugh, “guess it doesn’t really matter what I thought.” He sighs. “See you around, Cas.”
Dean snaps out of whatever he’s thinking to grin and nudge against her. “Told you I was a good kids. Bet your friends couldn’t say the same about you, huh sweetheart?”
Deanna doesn’t respond, still staring almost dumbfounded, and slowly deflates, arms dropping to her sides. Defeated. “Okay, Cas.”
Dean cleans the cut on Cas’s foot and bandages it. Once he’s done, he pulls Cas to his feet and Cas is amazed at how easy and natural it feels to just fall into Dean’s body and kiss him.
“Don’t be too mad, Dean,” Gabe says. “At least you got to spend some alone time with Cas. If anything, you should be thanking us.”
“God, Cas, wanted this for long,” Dean breathes into him, pulling back just slightly, their foreheads knocking together.
“Love what you’ve done with the place,” he says. “Thought I was at a bachelorette party for a second.”
Dean watches her get into her car and waves as she drives off. A cold breeze pushes into him carrying the last whiffs of her scent. Lavender and lemons. And he frowns, body longing for honey and clementines.
The words sat between them, seeming to take up all the space in the room, and neither of them spoke for a long while.
Cas reached out to take Dean’s hand in his. Dean’s hands were always rougher than Cas’s, dry and riddled with callouses. But now they were a little softer, evidence of his lack of work lately. Cas rubbed circles into Dean’s palm with his thumb. “No,” he finally said, his voice sure. “I want you here.”
“Not enough to keep you from listening to some really stupid advice or something. And not enough for you to tell me what it was now. I’m tired of the mystery, Dean. I’m tired of this guessing game with you. We’re almost thirty years old. I need more than this.”
Sam and Jess were making their way over. When Jess caught sight of Cas she ran ahead, launching herself at Cas much like Jo had.
It’s a balcony like right out of a Disney movie with intricate balusters and a dark stone appearance.
Dean shrugs with a lazy grin. “Gotta get them done some time and it’s not like I got anyone to get back to.”
The words seem to burn all the air from the room it’s so damn quiet no one was breathing. Cas eyes Dean, something dark starting to pool into his blue irises. “What the hell are you talking about Dean?”
Then a face appears in the window and a familiar smile appears in the dull light. “You really gonna make me dig out my key, brotha?”
Cas’s long fingers tickle up his ribcage, sliding to his back and pulling his closer. “Dean,” he whispers, looking up from under his lashes.
Cas’s face feels hot but instead of hiding it she reaches for Deanna’s hand and gives a gentle pull. “Come on. I want to go show you off.”
His coping mechanism was to just keep himself busy. Growing up that had meant cleaning profusely, which probably explained his obsession with cleanliness as an adult. But when he was at work that meant reading and even re-reading student papers.
Dean slides over to Brady and wraps his arm around his waist, presses a kiss to his head and waits for his sour aroma to fade.
There’s a sharp and purposeful cough from behind them and Dean opens one eye, trying to find the disruption. Nothing jumps out to him at first until he hears it again and looks down.
Sam bent to give him two more breaths when Dean jumped to life. He coughed violently and Sam helped flip him onto his side. Dean lurched forward just in time to vomit over the edge of the bed.
So with a dramatic yawn, Dean starts tugging off his suit jacket and makes a beeline for his room. “Well, good night, Cas,” he says over his shoulder, too afraid to look back. “Thanks for coming with me. I’ll talk to you-”
Dean accepts the cup and takes a whiff just to be sure and swirls of peppermint wafts into his nose, clearing his sinuses like magic. He scrunches his nose. “Damn. That’s powerful.”
Cas swallows and looks at the woman behind Dean who looks just as debauched as his ex boyfriend but with messier hair. Dean always liked running his hands through Cas’s hair when they kissed.
Anna secures the ribbon around the mistletoe and hands it to Cas. “Okay so when you get to Dean’s just hang this up and let your magic work itself.”
“Castiel?” his sister’s voice carries to him, sharp with concern. The footsteps get faster. “Cas, what’s wrong?”
She doesn’t wake up again until they’re in her home and Dean has her situated in her own bed, a cold rag on her head and trash cans on either side. He gets some medicine in her and takes her temperature because he knows Cas will want to know when he calls.
Dean turns in time to catch Cas’s friend, Meg, before she can fall on him. She uses his arm and the counter to steady herself and gives him a dangerous smile. “Doesn’t it look awesome?” she shouts over the music.
Sam sighed and shoved a hand through his hair. “I don’t know, Cas. I just… I guess I was just thinking that… maybe—maybe if you tried talking to—”
He hurries toward the Impala, eager to escape the cold and the sorrow burning inside him. He shouldn’t still feel this way. He should be over all this; the feelings, the lingering hopes. There’s just no point in letting it get him down anymore.
“I think…” Cas starts and loses her voice for a moment. “Uh, I think it’s someone asking me to prom.”
A mop of unruly dark hair appeared in the distance and Dean just smiled, watching it get closer and closer until he can make out the tanned skin and the wide lips and the bright eyes.
Cas hums around his coffee, feeling warmer than he has in weeks as Dean spits out plans and puts their lives back in order. “Sounds perfect, Dean.”
He shows the images to Callie who immediately lights up, eyes wide and almost disbelieving and he knows he has her. “What do you say, partner?” he asks, forcing his best southern drawl.
He starts to crouch. It’s not a hassle yet, but definitely isn’t as easy as it was six months ago. Or even two months ago. He gives a little wobble and shoots an arm out to steady himself and then feels two large hands grasp his hips.
To say he was shocked would be an understatement, but Cas didn’t have the time to process his surprise because he was soon supporting a very heavy and pliant Dean Winchester.
Cas’s body shook as his face tightened. “Ugh, disgusting. I never understood how you liked that stuff.”
Cas looks up and before he can blink there are lips on his, so soft and Cas’s enter body temples under it, under the weight of his first kiss with the first boy he’s ever loved.
Sam didn’t answer, didn’t dare to. But it seemed Dean didn’t need a response from him when he continued.
It shouldn’t be this jarring. Dean was a beautiful man, an unfairly gorgeous work of art really with the loveliest personality to match and in any other universe would surely have been snatched up and married with beautiful green-eyed and freckled babies by now. Truly, Cas has been blessed to have not had to feel this sickness in his stomach much sooner and many times over.
