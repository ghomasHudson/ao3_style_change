“You’re the one who stopped me from apologizing.” Cas shot back, sounding bitter. He fully swung his legs over so they joined the rest of his body on the bed, matching Dean’s position.
Dean’s face lit up crimson for what seemed like the hundredth time this morning. He quickly diverted his gaze to the window in hope Sam didn’t notice. He felt Cas shift in his spot beside him and he mentally prayed that he wouldn’t say anything.
Dean shuddered when his palm finally reached the bulge between his legs. He felt horny again, despite already coming twice just a few minutes ago. The heightened state of arousal theory was really gaining traction. Dean's body felt like it was on fire. He suddenly wanted to be touched. Needed it. And he knew Cas was the only one who could satiate him.
Then, he was leaning over and placing his lips to the side of Cas’ head, short and sweet, before walking in the direction of a small barn in the distance, “I’ll go get someone to wrap this up for us. Don’t let anyone steal our tree.” He pointed at him as he said it, prior to him spinning back around to actually watch where he was going.
“Dean—“
Cas seemed irritated enough by whatever happened to forcefully push Dean against his shoulders, sending him tumbling backward into the motel. Cas followed in after him, shutting the door with force. Dean had just finished stabling his balance when Cas turned back around, giving him a clear frown of disapproval. He waited for him to explain what he'd witnessed mere seconds before but instead, Cas gave him the silent treatment. He huffed as he stomped over to the bed, sitting down where Dean had been laying. He shifted over a bit and wrinkled his face in disgust when he quickly realized upon sitting down that an area of the mattress was damp.
Cas was about to move aside when Sam piped up, pointing at him, “No, Cas. Stay.” The angel’s posture straightened slightly, trying to match Dean’s height as he pressed himself closer to the door. His icy blue eyes bared into his. Dean could clearly see desperation within them.
Hey, I know I said I'd try to update everyday since I'm on break but I had written an entire chapter and hated it and then had to start over. So here she is! The next chapter should actually be up by tomorrow because it's shorter. Happy New Year and thank you so much to all the lovely feedback. This is really encouraging me to want to write on here more often!
Dean squinted his eyes at him, expecting himself to say something like
Sam smirked, knowing what Cas had been getting at, "You're asking me if I had any weird sex dreams? No, I didn't. At least, not that I remember."
He had every intention of pacing around—or leaving all together, before his vision went blurry at the edges and he felt too light headed to stand. He collapsed back onto the mattress with a gasp and now Cas was standing and rushing to the other side of the heart. He laid a hand on his shoulder earnestly, “Dean, are you alright?”
Dean could finally breathe in a normal rhythm again, pulling himself away from whatever that moment could be described as. He felt like Cas was teasing him, wether he meant to or not was the real question.
It had the appropriate effect on him, causing his crotch to feel tighter.
As he yawned again, he heard Cas’ voice.
Cas scoffed and sternly said, “No.”
”For fuck’s sake, I’ll be fine. I trust that you’ll kill it before it eats me, anyway.” Dean sighed. He seemed to be able to stand up now without a lot of assistance. He could do this.
It was so pleasurable Dean was feeling disoriented from it, still experiencing some sort of post-orgasmic haze. And he remembered
Dean finally piped up, looking at the back of Cas’ head, “I don’t feel
His slight movement he made to scoot himself up toward the pillows made him suddenly painfully aware of the state his body was in, and he was then grateful Cas wasn’t there.
Sam’s eyes widened at him, “Dean, are you sure? You’re bright red.” He leaned halfway over the table, trying to get a closer look. Dean proceed to cross his legs in hope of hiding his troubling problem down south. When he looked back up, all he saw was his younger brother, the mirage of his sexually charged angel had finally disappeared. His sudden need for self-awareness was enough to drag him away from his dream world.
It’s *spicy time*
She closed her eyes and let out a rattled breath, “She’d been having these dreams for a couple nights leading up to this—I think 3 nights.” Dean shifted in his seat knowing that meant he didn’t have a whole lot of time. The woman continued, “She’d take multiple naps a day, she was just constantly tired, probably because her dreams would always end up keeping her awake the rest of the night.”
But he felt exactly the opposite way about him. So he had to keep having these internal battles.
He continued to keep his eyes fixed on the carpet, so that he wouldn’t have to see any three of the men currently staring at him. Dean felt like he was trapped under an unavoidable spotlight. The guilt, the shame, the despair, were all bubbling to the surface, trying to torture him. And he knew none of the people in the motel room were going to let him push it away.
When Dean saw the room he simply nodded and when Sam saw it moments later he narrowed his eyes in confusion, “Dean, what the hell?”
“I don’t give a shit what Sam said. He likes to convince himself of things that aren’t real. He
Dean didn’t even know what to say. His brain was completely empty of responses. He ran a hand down his face, feeling how hot he was. He knew his entire complexion had to be the same shade as the heart shaped bed by now.
?” Sam scoffed, mocking him again.
Cas gently placed Dean next to Sam, propped up against the car for balance. He laid his entire body weight on the backseat door.
, they knew they could take a break because they’d be at it for a bit.
Everything reaches a breaking point.
Dean can’t help what his heart wants
Cas nodded like he’d reached a confirmation, “So, it was a woman.”
Dean nodded as he slid under the covers, yawning, “If I start making noise and it disrupts
At first, Dean was taken back and mildly embarrassed. And then another second passed and he was hunched over laughing.
written down the right leg. Given him and his brother’s height difference, they were going to be slightly baggy on Dean. Regardless, he still carried them into the bathroom with him and changed while performing the rest of his usual nighttime activities.
, he responded after Dean told him. And clearly Sam told Eileen because next thing he knew, she was approaching him at the map table with a catalogue of rings. She even had some already circled of the ones she liked. The only reason she had that on hand in the first place was because she’d proposed to Sam a few months earlier, right after Chuck was defeated. So, Dean had to keep asking himself: What the fuck was stopping him from doing the same?
Cas shook his head, “I would’ve sensed powerful magic.”
“Hey, you said it yourself that I needed to try to get along with Cas. Don’t you think sharing a room together alone would be some sort of progress?” He proposed.
"Dean, we can handle this by ourselves.” Sam pleaded. Dean looked over at Cas to see that he was awkwardly focused on the pavement, clearly not wanting to involve himself in what was probably soon to be an argument. He also noticed the three stakes were now drenched in dog’s blood. He’d done it while they were bantering.
The visit to the morge had been even less helpful than they imagined. Cas was able to scan their bodies for the usual Enochian sigils that Cupids branded into people’s ribs, and he found nothing.
So, Dean was right. Something about this was wrong.
When he opened it, he widened his eyes to see Cas standing on the porch, arguing with two women who were still in pajamas. Of course, the door swinging open to reveal their dispute, forced it to come to a crashing halt as they all turned their heads to Dean. None of them looked remotely happy to see him—especially Cas.
And now his heart was doing somersaults, barreling back into his chest. He was breathless like the angel had sucked all the air from him. Dean was drowning in deep blue and
he sounded. Like he’d actually been brought up with manners. His voice was higher than usual, and less gruff. It had practically become a natural instinct for him at this point.
Of course, Dean wasn't having it. He reluctantly fought against Sam holding him down, "The Hell I am." He grumbled. He attempted to stand on his own when Sam eased up on him. He posture was wobbly but he managed to stay standing when he focused hard enough to get his surroundings to stay still.
Dean simply nodded and put the car in reverse.
“Well, I slept great—for the most part. Did you guys hear that one room last night? Like I get it’s a by-the-hour motel and all, but jeez they were loud. Talk about having no shame.” Sam then resumed his typing on his keyboard.
“Just because I’m a prisoner here doesn’t mean I have to be a sober one.” He grumbled. He grabbed a couple of tiny vodkas before slamming the door shut. The entire fridge rattled and shook as he stepped away from it. He assumed physically taking his anger out on an inanimate object was probably better than taking it out on Cas. He looked around him for a place to sit. He wanted to lay on the bed, but Cas already occupied the space and the last thing he wanted was to be near him. Mostly, because he was furious. But also partly because every time he locked eyes with him now, he couldn’t help but recall his erotic dream and how good it was.
Thank you to y'all leaving kudos and comments, it warms my heart that you like my smutty angsty writing lmao. Just FYI I’m trying to get a chapter out everyday but if not at least every other day there should be a new one.
Julia seemed to wrack her brain a bit harder, “Last night, in her sleep, she got up and ran around the room, even pulled down our curtains. She kept screaming about someone coming to eat her.” She let out a bleak laugh at what seemed like a ridiculous answer. She eyed Dean curiously, “But it was just a heart attack, right? The FBI doesn’t seriously think it was something else?”
“The great lengths you’re going to to hide your current condition is quite.......
"Mmmm Cas, you're so good." He moaned as he laid himself flat on the bedspread, his incredible dream and everything that followed loosened his muscles and calmed his stress. His eyes closed for a second before his fun was ruined with the shakiness of Cas' voice.
Dean finally looked at him for a split second. And in that split second all he could see was his sad face as he said he was
Dean hated how much Sam was clearly enjoying this. He grumbled as he started cutting into him omelette, “I didn’t sleep well.” Technically wasn’t a lie.
Dean did away with the choking, tiny gasps were able to spring free from his mouth when he did. He palmed himself faster, biting his lip and feeling the pleasure in the pit of his stomach build again.
But he was quickly proven wrong when he drifted all the way asleep.
Dean and Cas finally give in.
The friction created by his hand didn't stop, however, because Dean was still surprisingly hard. He still felt his body crave more and his nerves were on fire.
.” Or in Dean’s case,
“You don’t snore—“
succubus. A literal
"Dean."
, Dean thought to himself. When the memory of them in the motel room a mere half hour ago replayed in his mind, the world around him spun faster and his stumbled over nothing. Suddenly, Sam's hands were pressed against his shoulders to hold him steady.
“Sam, take my card and get a room before I start swinging.”
He knew in the back of his mind that he could never hate Cas. Cas could never truly be dead to him. Because the ghost of him would never stop haunting him.
“Are you not aware of what he fucking did?” Dean hissed.
“I think it might be what we’re dealing with. I’m thinking whatever this creature is, it feeds on sex or hormones or something like that.”
Dean drove them to a Christmas tree farm forty minutes away. It wasn’t even the closest one near the bunker, but when Dean was looking up places to go, he saw they had the biggest trees.
to her. He’d learned sign language over a century ago and with Eileen around, it came of use now.
Instead, he rose to his feet, a cold breeze now hitting his exposed damp skin and making him shiver. He fished for clean clothes out of his duffle bag before strolling over to the bathroom to change and clean himself up.
“I said it’s quite bewildering.”
Also if y'all thought I was going to forget about the empty deal, you thought wrong.
“The succubus.....It must have drained a lot out of you.” He stated.
He mainly addressed Sam, not ready to see Cas’ reaction again because he knew it would break him for good, “Look, you’re the one who dragged me here in the first place and told me to suck it up and work this case. So, you’re going to let me out of this car, I’m going to interview whoever is left in that house, and I’m going to
, he thought. Luckily, the place wasn’t that crowded when they got there and there were still plenty left.
Mortified wasn’t even accurate enough of a word for the way Dean was feeling. A blush crept up on his cheeks for no one to see.
“Alright we’ll leave in twenty.”
He didn’t want to admit how many times he’d almost called him, begging him to come back.
But Dean was already stomping away toward the older woman, which left Cas to interview the child and Sam to scope around some more.
He tried again. He walked out through the front door and once again, the sight of the parking lot in front of him was immediately replaced with the ugly black walls of the motel room. This time, he came from the closet.
aspects of the situation but she did say she heard her mother screaming she was going to be eaten.” Cas stated while folding his hands in his lap. His eyes flickered over to Dean only to see his gaze was glued to the floor.
“Dean, what’s—“
“Look, Dean—“
And to Dean’s surprise, the doors clicked again while Sam let out a disgruntled sigh. He was free to go.
In these short five minutes, Dean knew it wasn’t friendship. Whatever the hell their relationship was, was anything but friendly. And suddenly he craved clarity. More than he had in twelve years. He craved Cas. The
Not to mention, Cas and Dean could barely look at each other—or talk about what had happened, and now he wanted to go into his mind and watch his dream front and center.
“We didn’t say—“
It got harder and harder to push away his desire to apologize to him. He couldn’t stand the thought of Cas walking around even half as depressed and lonely as he was.
Cas let the joyous endeavor continue for a few more seconds, taking in the sight of Dean coming undone beside him, before finally retracting his hand.
Next, Dean insisted on buying lights and ornaments because they didn’t have any to begin with. And letting the two of them wander around a department store went exactly as expected. Cas continually found himself distracted by almost every item around him, as well as some of the people, too. Dean was firmly holding him at the arm, guiding him toward the decorations. He had recommended that he and Cas just carry their chosen items around the store, but Cas was stubborn and grabbed a basket on the way inside.
His hand reached for the gear shift to put the car in reverse, but Sam beat him to it, placing his hand over the knob to prevent him from moving it, “Dean, wait. Okay, could you just try to talk to him?”
"Fuck." Dean breathed out and let his head fall back.
Dean is totally fucked both literally and figuratively.
That was enough of a visual for Cas to sense something was wrong. He was barreling out of the chair and crouching in front of Dean in an instant.
“No, don’t ‘
Dean snorted, “Rogue Cupid? You know the last time we tried tangling with those bitches, it ended up being something way worse. You really want to take that bet again?”
Cas shook his head and finally held out his own ornament, “I think we should use this one and I think it should be you.”
Cas simply said, “No.” He didn’t even look mad, probably because he knew he’d won. Unless Dean was going to teach himself Enochian in the space of an afternoon, he wasn’t leaving.
Dean squinted at him and questioned, "What-What are you doing?" He was out of breath despite doing close to nothing other the last ten minutes.
and the toe of his boots pointed in Dean’s direction, “What about you? How about you break your silent treatment and help us out. Especially since you’re the one whose fucked here.”
And......Dean’s eyes were open in a flash again. His mouth was open and his forehead wrinkled in a reaction he could only describe as surprise. He couldn’t help but feel his heart kick once or twice in his gut, reviving itself. Dean wish he hadn’t. He hated false hope more than anything.
Sam made similar attempts to talk to him, which were met with similar rejections.
you.” He seemed mildly confused by his bizarre expression but still understood what Dean had meant.
There was also a noticeable wet spot on one side of the bed of some sort of clear liquid. Unfortunately, all of them knew exactly what it was.
Of course, Dean had hardly noticed because he was more focused on the fact that he was leaning in toward Cas. Their faces were close. Their lips closer.
Cas just looked at him dubiously, “Weird how? Weirder than the boisterous volume of your pleasurable cries, you mean?” The way he told him this like it was nothing sent Dean’s head spinning. Even just hearing Cas say the word
Dean was having the literal life sucked out of him.
Sam scoffed at him in disbelief at his impressive nonsense, “All he said was
Sam shoved his hands in his pockets, “Well we were more surprised to not hear from you. It’s been quite a few weeks.” He seemed as though he was trying not to address the real subject at hand. He was acting like the person he was speaking to had just been too busy to return his calls and not been taking a vacation away from them because he accidentally got their mother killed.
Dean then proceeded to shove the key card into his brother’s hands, “Well, I’m going home, have fun. Got the best room in the joint so you can continue kissing Cas’ ass in private.” He snarled.
Dean was at a loss for an answer, “Uh.....B-Because I said so?” He shrugged at him. He had quite a few reasons not to tell Sam, unfortunately all of them involved Cas. His first biggest one being that Sam would ask way more in depth questions about his dream than Cas would—which would lead him to reason number two, Sam finding out he was having sexual fantasies about their best friend. Although, based on last night’s behavior, he wondered if Sam had already sensed something between them.
He settled for the chair that Cas had been sitting in a few minutes prior. He dragged it from the corner of the room to near the bathroom, as far away as possible from the angel as he could get in the confined space. When he finally sat down with his handful of tiny bottles, he saw Cas roll his eyes at him from the corner of his vision. He decided he didn’t care and popped open the first bottle.
However, Dean's crotch didn't seem to get the memo. He felt his cock twitch in his pants and he wanted to throw himself out the diner window.
Dean exhaled while aggressively stabbing a fork into his omelette, "Sorry, I'm just tired."
“Great….lets start looking into that.” Sam was grabbing his duffle bag off the floor and searching for his laptop.
He coughed again, forcing himself back to reality. His mouth went dry with anxiety as he continued watching Cas' intense gaze. Dean had no idea how to read this situation, and he didn't want to get it wrong if he actually tried. Cas catching him off guard was enough to make his words to him come out as something almost resembling a mumble, "Um....I guess, non-threatening ones....when I'm not being attacked."
Cas then seemed timid, “Should I attempt to wake you if you start.....” He didn’t even try to finish his sentence.
So much for Sam figuring it out on his own.
Unless it wasn't tasting something physical....
“I’ll take the front entrance.” He announced as he stormed away from them.
Ngl this chapter is kinda kinky. If it starts to not really be your thing you can always skip to the next, I'm trying to set this fic up so all the dreams are every other chapter and the plot is in-between.
Dean had to glance up at Cas again to make sure what he had heard was real. He gave Cas a stern look, to remind him that Sam wasn’t supposed to know about what was going on with him.
I can't believe 1k people have read this! Thats probably not a lot by AO3 standards but it's a lot to my self-conscious brain lmao. Thank y'all so much. I swear it won't take me this long to update next time, which I'm hoping might be tomorrow if I consume caffeine.
“This one.” They spoke in unison. Their harmonized words caused them to lock eyes and smile at each other. Dean only lasted a few seconds in his gaze before he looked away bashfully. And all of a sudden, his plan was playing through his head again.
The door of their conversation had been completely slammed shut by Dean. He’d turned cold and sour again, much like he always did when talking about his feelings started to scare him. His upper lip stiffened and the anger that had been sizzling inside of him made its grand appearance, “Then he better not see me again.”
Cas still couldn’t meet his stare, “I suppose with Jack’s passing it’s obsolete.” He mumbled and Dean could barely make it out.
Dean tried to blink away the entire scene in front of him, but to no luck. By now, his erection was fully visible, and he couldn’t do anything about it. He attempted to keep his breathing steady as he finally replied to Cas, “I-I’m fine.”
“Dean—“
Dean shrugged, “I thought so too, but she told me she wasn’t.”
Sam was then pulling Cas into a short hug, giving him a pat on the back as he did. Dean rolled his eyes at the sight of the small grin that washed over Cas’ face as it happened. When they pulled away, Sam admitted, “It’s good to see you, Cas.”
“Agent?” Julia interrupted his staring. He turned back toward her and nodded.
Alcoholism? Check.
Dean blinked him away, not in the mood
As the orgasmic haze cleared, he started to become more aware of his surroundings. The last thing he could recall was leaving the diner. He blinked rapidly when he realized he was in the passenger seat of the impala, which was now parked beside a curb in suburbia. And he wasn't alone.
Sam groaned at his reluctance, “Dean, this is for your own good. All the moping around the bunker, not eating and running on nothing but crappy coffee, sitting in the impala alone all the time......” Dean fixated on Cas’ reaction to his words, feeling slightly bashful all of a sudden. Cas simply raised an eyebrow at him but didn’t say anything as Sam continued, “You’re miserable. Even if you won’t admit it. And I’ve just about had enough of not talking about the elephant in the room for weeks now. So here’s the fucking elephant. Talk to it. Before I go insane.” He pleaded.
Cas didn’t say anything, he just turned his head back around to face him again. Dean felt compelled to continue.
thing he could’ve done. He knew how much Jack meant to him—despite how they parted ways. And as much as he wanted to add a cold remark about how Jack would’ve been better off had they let him die the first time, the motivation to do so never dawned on him. Almost like the pain he felt every time that name was mentioned was beginning to wither away. Dean couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or not.
Dean let his foot drag a line through the stale snow that had fallen a few nights ago as he huffed out a breath, the slight gust of warm air brushing against his cheeks, “I like agreeing on things.”
And with that, Sam left.
“But moving on from motive, the victims all strangely had felt both incredibly horny but also lethargic a few days leading up to their deaths. Most of them were forcing their spouses to have sex multiple times a day but were sometimes too tired to even finish the job. One woman, fell asleep during it.”
“Dean—“
"You...wrapped your own hand around your throat and you started....choking yourself." He answered, feeling clearly uncomfortable and shy about it. He still kept looking down, not meeting Dean's gaze.
He opened his eyes and shifted until he was sitting up, mirroring Cas’ posture. Suddenly heat rushed to his cheeks and he wasn’t as amused by his condition as he was earlier. He swallowed hard and felt a twinge of pain run down his throat. That led him to his next talking point, he turned to Cas this time as he spoke to him, “Yeah, I mean, my throat is sore as hell.” He tried to muster a laugh to cover up the pure awkwardness of his words, but one barely came.
That shot tingles down Dean's spine. He knew it wasn't real and if he focused hard enough he could see Cas still sitting a few inches away, looking in Sam's direction.
The thing that confused him was the fact that he wasn’t married. But he couldn’t help but think about what he was going through with Cas lately and figured maybe the monster thought it was close enough. Besides, prior to the absolute disaster that shall not be named, Cas had stuck by his side constantly, they helped raise a kid together, and they both lived under the same roof. Surly, the monster couldn’t have been able to tell the difference between their situation and a real marriage.
They both responded accordingly. Cas quickly stood himself up from the booth, Dean made sure to scarf down one last strip of bacon before joining them out the door.
Cas let out a frustrated sound and continued to move forward until he was almost pressed up against Dean, he placed one hand on his shoulder and tried to speak to him in a stern tone, "Dean." Dean realized they had been in a reverse situation barely even fifthteen hours ago. Only this time, Cas was way closer than Dean had ever gotten to him. And it was at that moment he realized that this wasn’t his brightest idea.
His eyes rolled to the back of his head as he climaxed. His palm hugged his neck tighter and his other hand moved swiftly against the bulge in his pants, working him through his release. His boxers, which were still slightly wet from earlier, became soaked with cum again. This time, Dean could feel the dampness all the way through the thick material of his jeans.
Things start to get tricky
This chapter is mostly setting up the case and also Dean and Cas starting to reconcile.
“I’m not sicking anyone on anyone. You’re not going to bail. You’re going to work this case with us, wether you like it or not. But first, you and Cas are going to talk things out. And I’m not letting you out of this room until you two come to some sort of understanding.” Sam explained while folding his arms over his chest.
But all of his desire was quickly replaced with anger. He was sick of never getting the things he wanted. He felt like even though Chuck was gone he was still punishing him for reasons unexplained.
Dean's cock throbbed upon him seeing Cas' look of astonishment settle into something along the lines of curiosity. His eyebrows pulled tightly together but his eyes relaxed to a certain degree. His lips subtly curved upward just enough for him to notice.
Dean started mentally cursing himself out. Cas had heard him. His dream was clearly intense enough to make him moan in his sleep. And apparently, according to Cas, he was quite loud.
Dean had completely forgotten the case that had brought them to the shitty motel room in the first place. All of the victims had died from wet dreams, or at least, that’s what the headline they had read claimed. Cas had to be right, there was no way it was a coincidence that Dean just happened to have the best dream sex of his life the very moment he rolled into a town full of people experiencing the same thing. This, however, didn’t prevent Dean from drinking a second bottle of vodka.
There was a night when him and Cas had gone out for a beer and were walking back to the impala. It was the end of October and the temperature of the air was perfect. Dean was virtually sober, Cas had a bit of a drunken sparkle in his eyes but he walked and talked just fine. Somewhere during their conversation about having a scary movie night together, Dean had gotten lost in the very sight of Cas. The way his teeth would slightly bare and show a smile when he rambled about something he was excited about. The autumn air blowing against his jet black hair. His stunning eyes. His sexy 5 o clock shadow….
Cas simply sat back on the bed and huffed, “About what?”
“Talk about a happy ending.” Dean snorted.
When Dean stubbornly looked outside his sideview mirror, he saw a big house distantly behind them, surrounded by cop cars and caution tape. He realized then that he found an out.
Dean felt his head pang with fear but he didn't have much choice but to pretend otherwise. He tilted his head and shrugged his shoulders, his voice pitched itself up an octave higher due to the nerves, "What is it?"
and his answer to his problem was suddenly clear when every top search result was the same.
“Since now.” Dean shot back.
Dean pouted at him as he felt his crotch throb with need. He had no idea what had gotten into him. He felt like a teenager all over again.
“Dean, please.” His brother pleaded, the desperation in his voice was evident, “For me. Just give him a half hour. A half hour, that’s all I’m asking. If after that time is up, you’re still dead set on never seeing him again, then I won’t push anymore. I’ll accept that whatever you two had is done and I won’t bring him up ever again, okay?”
Sam and Dean held a deadly staring contest for almost a minute before Dean let out a dramatic huff of air. He then took his foot off the break and the car began inching forward before he started steering it toward a parking space, “Fine.” He grumbled, “A half hour.”
He figured Cas coming back to save him had to be a sign. One he decided not to ignore.
“Uh...Rowena.” He seemed to blurt out the name on the spot.
This is probably my favorite title I've ever named a chapter lol
Please leave me kudos and comments if you liked what you read. And if you didn't......I guess you can yell at me, no hard feelings.
He never thought there would come a day where he’d be bummed Cas wasn’t choking him.
Dean was impressed with Cas' amount of professionalism while discussing this topic, because Dean didn't have any. His face was nine different shade of red—and if the room wasn’t dark Cas could see it, and his heart rate had skyrocketed. He tried his best to keep his voice steady as he nodded, "I guess that explains why it hurts so much....and why you didn't wake me up." He remembered the agreement him and Cas had made before he went to bed and he had been wondering why he didn't withhold it.
“No reason.”
“Because I just do! Okay!”
The women folded their arms over their chests and backed away from the porch, clearly ending the argument they were having on an abrupt note. Of course, one of them made sure to flash Cas a high and mighty middle finger before officially leaving.
Sam sighed, "Awesome, how exactly are we supposed to get dog's blood without....you know."
“Because the motel complex has already missed out on enough sleep for tonight.” He sassed him.
Sam went on to explain, “The combination of a dangerous occupation and a bumpy marriage would more than likely leave a person feeling emotionally vulnerable, more than the average person, at least. Many of the vics also had histories of drug or alcohol addictions.” As he told them this, Dean noticed Cas looking over at him, yet he still kept his mouth shut. He rolled his eyes and continued paying attention to Sam, “All of them also weren’t close with their families, they were either dead or abusive. Once again, I think that plays into my theory about emotional vulnerability. It’s almost like whatever is targeting this town is going off some sort of trauma checklist for picking it’s victims.” Dean was starting to strangely take offense to everything Sam was saying, because he was one of the victims now, unbeknownst to him. But, Dean had to admit everything described him perfectly.
When they made their way back downstairs, the living room was flooded with photographers and police officers, as well as people in plainer clothing wearing looks of distress on their faces. They were more than likely the victim’s family members. An older woman who appeared to be in her forties, and a young daughter, who couldn’t have been older than ten.
The drive was only 20 minutes. Considering succibi needed to be in close proximity to it's prey in order to affect them, it made sense why the distance was short. The car wound up parked on gravel and Cas was scooping an exhausted Dean out of the passenger side when he saw the impala parked a few feet away, Sam leaned against the trunk with his arms crossed over his chest.
Ugh fuck, Cas." Dean loudly moaned as he opened his eyes. He felt his cock twitch and then the next second his underwear went damp. His body pulsed and shuddered with pleasure as he rode out his orgasm, his body hunched over the car seat as he panted trying to catch his breath. At that same moment, he felt his own hand still wrapped around his throat and his other palming himself through his jeans. He retracted both and let them fall to his sides while he was still coming down from his high.
Don’t forget to comment and leave kudos :)
Cas finally turned his face toward Dean, eyes full of both hope and immense misery, “But what if he’s not?”
His younger brother simply ignored him and looked at Cas, “I got the dog blood and made some wooden stakes while I was at it. Are you positive it’s in there?”
Cas bit the inside of his cheek and looked away. He focused on the ugly carpet this time, "You make it sound so simple."
Dean took another second to give him an answer, “No that’s okay, I’ll still sleep fine.” He then wasted no time climbing into the bed, “I’ll leave the lamp on for you.”
“Fuck.” Dean cursed as he climbed off the bed because he wanted to put more space between him and Cas and also because his nerves decided to spike. His mind was racing with emotions.
“Have you ever thought about getting piercings?”
Dean just shook his head and didn’t answer his question. He gave Sam a resentful scowl, “Well then I guess you’re gonna need some padded walls, because I’m not doing this.” He finally pushed against Cas, trying to get him to budge.
The ends of Cas’ lips curved upward at that.
Dean still made a stride toward the door and stopped right in front of Cas, coldly glaring at him, “Cas, let me through.”
By now, Dean’s breathing was more steady. He stared at the angel in disbelief at everything that was going on. He knew his thoughts were starting to return to him because he started to feel his anger rise to the surface. The anger he had maintained when he first arrived. He no longer cared how good naked dream Cas had made him feel. Because normal, fully clothed Cas was the one standing in front of him, and this version of him had caused him pain.
“No, Now.” Sam pushed, “The clocks still ticking here.”
Cas’ back slacked farther against the pillows. He looked over at Dean who was contently laying on top of the covers. He huffed in annoyance , "Dean, you should be taking this seriously.”
She chuckled and moved her hands again,
“What?” Dean nervously asked as he tried to slow his breathing.
Dean thought about telling him there were worse ways to die than through intense orgasmic bliss but he figured all it would do would concern Cas even more.
” He then gave him and Cas a look that Dean couldn’t quite place. It wasn’t quite suspicion.
The angel nodded and nervously shifted the weight on his feet, “I was surprised to hear from you.”
His brother nodded, "Yeah. After that room quieted down, I fell right asleep." Dean believed it, the bags that usually settled under his eyes while they worked cases weren't prominent and his overall demeanor seemed more relaxed—besides when Dean was raising his suspicions.
But his involuntary nap left him experiencing one of the most vivid dreams he'd ever had in his life. Maybe even the most.
They didn’t have a lot of time left.
But Cas didn’t look up from what he was doing.
An abusive and dead dad and a recently deceased mom? Double check.
Dean perked up upon hearing his brother's confusion. He slightly pushed himself off the car and tried to stop him from inspecting the item thoroughly, "Wait a second-"
Dean shivered before giving an answer, “Y-Yes.”
Dean took a bite of bacon and tried to not look so startled. He watched as Sam was turning the laptop around so both of them could read something on a database he’d found, “You guys ever heard of something called a Lideric?”
Dean groaned in annoyance and dramatically rolled his eyes, "Look, Cas, there are certain things in life that older brothers don't want their younger brothers to know about and this is one of those things." He figured what he said wasn't exactly a lie, more of a vague excuse.
(See the end of the chapter for
Also lemme know other things y'all wanna see me write--preferably DeanCas content. I'm nearing an end to this story sadly and I need writing inspo lol.
Writing Destiel smut on Christmas? Couldn't be me.
What hurt him the most is that Cas more than likely really believed what he said; he thought his presence was burdening to Dean. But Dean could never feel that way about him. If anything, having him around comforted him in ways that even Sam couldn’t accomplish most of the time. Despite the tumultuous history of their friendship, after everything, Cas still brought him an ounce of security. He wished he didn’t, so everything he was dealing with would be simpler. He just wanted to hate him so he could move on.
Dean steadied his breathing before realizing how long Sam had been stuck waiting for an answer. He cleared his throat, "Y-yeah. I meant it when I said I was tired." He whistled before sipping more of his coffee.
So, he tried again. This time, using words, “Hey….uh Cas?”
Dean immediately turned his head, almost like the phone was a shining beacon, “I see that. Put it away.” Sam ignored his words and his phone then lit up and his thumbs started moving against the glass. Dean let out a frustrated groan and extended his arm to him, “Hand it over, we’re not calling him.”
As Sam started shamelessly stripping, unbuttoning his shirt as he kicked off his cheap and uncomfortable dress shoes, Dean realized them sharing a bed was a terrible idea.
“You’re also not blonde.”
Sam leaned farther against his hands on the table, his back falling toward the wall. He raised his eyebrows and his lips parted as he seemed to contemplate Cas’ idea. He then looked between the two of them for what felt like the hundredth time, “Huh. That’s actually not the worst idea.”
Sam continued to chase after him, trying to walk with him side-by-side as Dean’s eyes remained focused on the numbers on the outside of the motel doors. He spun the key around on his fingers and walked with a purposeful stride. He was clearly determined to find the room he had just rented. Cas jogged
Of course, he was probably more freaked by the most important detail: it was in the shape of a heart.
He knew he had to say something to ease the invisible weight on Cas’ shoulders. He didn’t want to apologize. Dean didn’t want to let him believe that what he did was okay in the slightest. But he also couldn’t bare to let him suffer like this.
Dean just grumpily rolled his eyes, by now, he was beyond exhausted. He had been awake too long with very little sleep and even less coffee. He yawned through his words, “Not quality enough, I’ll tell you that.”
Dean felt his cock start to rise. He tried desperately to pull himself away from what he knew wasn't real, even though it felt plenty.
Cas sighed, examining every crack the ceiling had to offer. He’d been dreading this moment for almost a year, “When Jack was dead, when we rescued him from Heaven.....the Empty had tried to claim him as it’s own. But I vowed to not let that happen. So I took the curse it bestowed upon me to trade my life for his.” He explained, with extra details that Dean finally could understand.
"You've got to be kidding me." Sam grumbled from the front seat, pinching the bridge of his nose in disapproval. He was clearly trying to get over how mortified he was at hearing his brother have a wet dream with every excruciating detail of it being displayed to him. His other hand was grasping the key that was inside the impala's ignition. The car was still, the usual rattle of the engine absent, meaning he was in the middle of shutting off the car when Dean's cries interrupted him.
Dean felt his heart sink, “C’mon Cas. You deserve it.” His voice started to sound a bit more strong and like himself.
During one of their spurts of childish banter, Eileen looked equally amused as she was slightly agitated at her future husband and brother-in-law. But she quickly masked her emotions with a bright, genuine smile in Cas’s direction, “You and Dean had fun today?”
Dean surprisingly didn't need to aid Cas into
This time Dean fully looked over at his brother with a glare that could kill, “Fuck off.” He spit at him.
“Well….There is another way to find it’s location…..” Cas’ voice reemerged after several minutes of awkward silence. He fully stared at Dean as he spoke.
Dean and Cas finally got together the very second he’d come back from the Empty. When he reunited with them while they were on a hunt gone awry. The very second he saved Dean’s life. Again. Dean was kissing and hugging him before his grace even finished healing his wound.
Cas bent his head to the side, narrowing his eyes at the hunter, “Yeah? And why not?” His voice was lower than it’s usual octave. Dean didn’t want to admit what effect it had on him. Tingles hit his stomach and continued to spread throughout his body, he tried his best to simply ignore it, but it was hard when Cas was a hair away from being basically flush with him.
His brother gazed out the window, “We should hit the morge before it gets dark.” He then turned toward his brother, who was slightly intoxicated, and let out a frustrated noise, “I guess I’m driving.”
Dean only laughed harder, tears welling in his eyes. It had been so long since Dean had laughed like this, and he didn't mind enjoying it even if it was at Cas' expense.
, what’d you find out?”
Dean stammered, "Uh...In some situations, y-yeah. It's not really something I wanna t-"
When Dean was able to focus hard enough on his surroundings, which were ever-changing as Cas proceeded to drag him closer toward his brother, he could see a torn down building in the distance. Every step he took he could feel himself getting drowsier. They were definitely at the right place.
Sam stood from the table and grabbed the keys, “Okay…..I don’t need to be here for this, and frankly, I also don’t want to be. I’m going to head to that shop and get the dog’s blood and anything else we’ll need.”
But Dean relaxed. Because it was also the most
. They never dared to have that conversation that blurred the line between whatever the hell their relationship was and what it could be.
He shrugged in response, “Sure. We’ve done more on less. Besides, I can’t say I’m not at least a little curious.”
Dean woke up screaming.
written across it. He bit his lip as he smiled and made eye contact with him, “Very funny.” He tossed it back into the basket with the rest of them.
For once, he actually thought before he spoke, “Cas, I know this scares you. Hell, it scares me too. But I have to wonder if all of this, this spell I’m under, or the succubus—or whatever, is meant to be a sign. Chuck’s gone, we’re free to make our own choices. And maybe it’s time we stop making the wrong ones. Stop being so stupid, so damn oblivious all the time....” Dean felt like that was the most open he’d been with his best friend in years. Sure, they talked plenty. But they never really
She lifted an eyebrow at him questioningly.
Dean, in response, felt both anger and bashfulness rise to his cheeks. They were practically steaming hot and bright red.
Real Cas wore concern on his face, “Dean, is everything alright?”
It was quiet for most of the ride, Sam typed away on his keyboard and flipped through his books as Dean focused on driving.
Dean wondered as he was falling asleep if maybe his dream earlier was just a fluke. That maybe a monster wasn't actually preying on him and he just a had a wild imagination.
If Dean didn’t know any better, he could’ve sworn Sam was implying that him and Cas were going to do more than sleep and do research.....
“It’s going to eat you if we don’t stop it.” Cas had said after it was quiet for way too long, at least on his end of things.
Dean’s eyes latched onto Cas’ only to see him returning the favor. This time, Dean saw the same cloud of sadness, but it was tinged with excitement. Hope, even. And it almost startled Dean at the sight. His breath felt trapped in his throat, he felt unable to speak but also unable to move away.
"That's because it is."
When he returned to him, now holding several boxes of lights, the cart was full. He had to have chosen at least fifty by the looks of it. Yet, Cas was still trying to shove more ornaments in. Dean huffed out a laugh and slowly forced the basket out of his hand, “Unless you’re planning on helping me pull a bank job on the way home, I recommend giving it a rest.”
“I already saw it earlier, Cas. Will you just take—“
Sam still tried talking to him despite Dean's brain partially dividing his attention. He had to refrain from reacting to
“I am. And I’m also aware that he’s incredibly sorry.”
When Dean looked up to see Cas still sitting across the room he was able to not let himself get sucked into the mirage. As hands grazed his chest he knew to keep his reactions minimal.
“Cupids going on strike, perhaps?” Dean half jokingly suggested, “Are they not getting paid overtime to shoot arrows at people’s asses?” That comment made him realize he was maybe a little more than just tipsy. A giggle escaped his lips even though no one else found his remark amusing.
Then, when they had their scary movie night a week later, Dean almost did it again. The way the angel snuggled against him and threw a blanket over top of them, reassured Dean that he wanted that for the rest of his life. He quickly tried to get himself set up to do it while one of the movies was paused and Cas had gotten up to make more popcorn on the stove. Dean was literally kneeling on the floor and everything. Until several minutes passed and Dean started smelling smoke and hearing Cas call his name from the kitchen.
His head fell back against the pillow and he shut his eyes, “I’m fine.”
“I said whatever, Cas.” He shot back. His mouth tasted bitter with frustration.
And Dean
"Alright, shut it, Cas." Dean snapped.
He guessed beggars couldn’t be choosers.
, Dean thought as he rolled his eyes, “Because, Dumbass, I said so. Now, take the ornament.”
Cas squinted at him and tilted his head in the way he famously did, “I-I didn’t say anything. Are you positive you’re alright, Dean?”
“Because you’re a flight risk!” Sam was baffled that they were even having an argument about this.
"Came so hard for you." He mumbled as he grew too tired to keep himself elevated off the bed. He fell completely backward and let his body sprawl out. His eyes fluttered shut before he was being violently shaken awake.
Sam sighed, “He’ll be dead to you. I’m not making any promises that I won’t ever see him or talk to him again. But I can promise it doesn’t ever need to involve you.”
“I advise against that. Passing out, at least.” Cas kept his voice quiet and gentle. Suddenly, Cas, angel of the lord, a being who’d been around for centuries, sounded small. Like he was afraid anything he said would set Dean off.
Cas' eyes stayed pinned to his face, watching his reaction.
Sam shook his head, “I’m not calling Cas, I’m...texting a friend.”
everything to go back to normal, so he
“Dean, I think that is unwise.” He admitted with caution laced in his voice, “Based on the other victims, you only have a few days before whatever this is has a lethal effect on you.”
Dean gawked at the unexpected movement and groaned, "Shit, Cas." His first instinct was to keep his voice down, to feel embarrassed by the volume, but his second thought was that Cas had already gotten more than an earful and once more wasn't really going to change that.
minds? I’m not letting Cas inside my head!”
Cas ignored his teasing and handed the laptop over to him, “Plenty more time to research. I could hit the lore while you type more questions into the machine.”
“Stubborn enough to marry you.”
Until Dean decided to ruin it, “Hey, Cas?”
Dean pushed his laptop aside and curiously got up from the bed. He slipped on his shoes and grabbed his gun from underneath his pillow, just in case. He tucked it into the waist of his jeans and underneath his shirt, before heading toward the door.
expression. And that wasn’t that.
by your company.”
The hunter’s ears perked up, “Curse? What’re you talking about? A curse?”
“Why not?”
The woman nodded slowly, her tear stained cheeks were now evident with the late morning sunlight striking her face just right. Her eyes were puffy and her nose was red. Her lips looked chapped like she’d been biting away at the skin. Dean didn’t realize how destroyed she looked until he really began to focus on her complexion. He had to admit, he felt bad for her.
He saw the impala in the parking lot, it was still the afternoon despite how long Dean had slept for. He then stormed out of the room toward the car.
. Meanwhile, Eileen and Sam were more than entertained by the scene in front of them. The both of them covered their smirks with their palms. The older Winchester groaned in annoyance, “Fine, but just take the ornament, Cas.”
Dean rolled on his side and aimlessly reached for his phone on the bedside table. When he found it he clicked it on and found himself squinting at the light. He painfully forced his eyes to bare the excessive brightness so he could read the time.
Precisely why he could never bring himself to ever hate him.
But it was too late. Sam was already scrunching his nose at the giant hole in the crotch as well as the now dry and crusted substance surrounding it. He threw them back in the bag in disgust, "Dude, Gross! Seriously? In
Four hours really was enough time for Dean to do all the research he needed, "Relax, We don't have to go smite an innocent pooch. I found a place a half hour away that sells all kinds of witchy shit. I'm figuring they'll have some....probably have to ask for it directly.”  He yawned again.
“You’re angry.” Cas stated, quietly.
But by the time his hand fumbled for the velvet case in his jeans, they were standing beside the car.
Cas playfully shot back, “You realize you’re just stubborn?”
Sam scrolled further down on his computer screen, “Well, according to this, seven people have died so far, all of them relatively young, all of them married. 4 women, 3 men. Their spouses all have similar eye witness accounts of seeing the victims experience similar dreams for a few days leading up to their death. Apparently all of them caused the victim to be so loud, they woke up their spouses.” He reported as if he was talking about the weather.
“Why not?” He cocked his head to the side questioningly.
explain what was so sacred about his situation. He nodded and let out a cough to mask a small burst of laughter that managed to slip through, "All the time."
When Dean sees Cas' lackluster reaction, he feels more empty inside than he was expecting.
Cas cut him off, while noticeably scooting an inch further away from the hunter who was still coming down from his high, “I understand.” That was also when Dean recognized a tinge of something more upbeat in his tone. It was subtle, but not enough to slip past his radar. Maybe he wasn’t as uncomfortable as Dean originally thought....
. I didn’t get a lot of research in before your grand show down outside.” He continued to poke fun at him.
They weaved their way through all of their potential Christmas trees, their fingers laced together, Dean’s thumb running across Cas’ knuckles. Their breath fogged and their noses turned pink from the cold. They made a point to walk as close together as possible so that Dean could keep warm. Every tree they passed just wasn’t quite good enough for their liking; too short, too tall, leaned too far to the left. They were both perfectionists at heart and refused to settle for less.
Sam seemed to drop his suspicion and began engaging in conversation with them, abandoning his research considering Dean had done all the work for him. He grabbed ahold of his own mug of, now room temperature, coffee. He asked aloud to the both of them, "So...how do we kill a succubus?"
Sam barely took one look at him before he frowned and exhaled, “He looks terrible”
Dean merely rolled his eyes and shifted in his seat. He eyed the mini fridge as he piped up, “Its a succubus and you kill it with dog’s blood. There you go. Happy?” He took on a sarcastic delivery.
Cas shifted around, “Well.....We don’t exactly have a choice.”
“Dean, you might not have a choice!” Cas raised his voice at him for the first time the entire conversation—hell, the first time since they’d reunited.
And that deal had gone right out the window.
Cas….
Dean felt his heart pounding in his ears, his questionable response left him suddenly nervous. He couldn’t help but stutter over his next words, “W-What? Just lay it on me.”
"Okay." Sam said before turning around and opening the trunk. All of the usual weapons were spread out in front of them in organized piles. Dean wasn't the tidiest but he still insisted on keeping his car neat. Sam obviously reached for the new items inside. He handed Cas the stakes and a jar of red liquid.He then opened up one of Dean's duffle bags and began rummaging around in it, "I figure even if guns can't take it out, it might slow it down so......What are my sweatpants doing in here?"
Dean’s eyes widened, “It’s what?”
Dean proceeded to glare at him through the windshield, “Because I don’t need to. I don’t have to accept his weak ass apology.”
“I don’t think that’s the best idea—“
me.” He mocked him and groaned, “We all know now, thanks to my stupidity, what he’s going to see in there!”
With a few flashes of a badge, they were inside scanning the scene. The only room that seemed to leave any evidence was, of course, the bedroom. Sheets, blankets, and pillows were scattered all over the bed and floor. The rather gaudy looking curtains had been yanked from the wall they were attached to and now pooled around the carpet below the windowsill.
“What?” Sam squinted.
made his stomach do somersaults.
Dean blinked again and Cas still wore his blank expression, not a suggestive smirk in sight. Dean thought maybe he was still a bit drunk. Or just plain tired.
Dean turned on his heels in surprise and anger to narrow his eyes at the angel, “You’re shitting me.”
"T-that um.....I didn't..."
Dean couldn’t make sense of what he meant. He was turning on his side to get a better view of him, unsure if he felt more or less annoyed by the response. His eyebrows pulled tight together and he drew a long calming breath to keep his emotions in tact. He knew all too well what happened when he let anger take the wheel. Cas got hurt. Cas would get told things he didn’t deserve.
Dean angrily snapped his head back over at Cas only to see that he was midway through taking another sip of coffee. He looked over at Sam who was still working on research, who didn’t appear to be phased by what Cas had just said. Then Dean groaned when he realized.
"You think that I wouldn't have already tried?" Dean felt unexpected fear when Cas raised his voice at him.
“But Dean already figured it out.” Cas piped up, “We’re hunting a succubus.”
"You're still trying to get out of working this case. That's why you did all that research, so you could dump it on us and play sick." Sam pointed a finger at him.
“It’s already coming after me, which means I’ll make good bait.” He defended.
Dean listened and then proceeded to give him a look that said,
Dean huffed in frustration and flipped on his bedside lamp as he rose to his feet, trying not to seem too let down. He headed straight for one of the tables adjacent from them, which displayed a small coffee maker. He used the dull lighting to make out the words on the sticker that the motel had slapped on the top of the machine. When Dean was finally able to read what it said, he groaned, “You have to actually pay the front desk to give you coffee grounds. What kind of motel is this?”
Dean sighed and tried his best not to focus too much on the figure behind him who was
Cas had made the mistake of leaving his hand on Dean's thigh, and only realized as such when he felt it being dragged up Dean's leg.
This time, when Cas responded, it sounded different. His voice was gentle and soft, almost like a gasp, “Dean.”
There was a comfortable silence for a few minutes and then for no reason, Cas decided to push his luck, “You should cease with consuming alcohol if you want to be competent enough to hunt.”
“Plan B? Shove it up your—“ Two angelic fingers were then pressed to Dean’s forehead. He cut himself off as he crumbled to the floor, his eyes suddenly snapping shut. His body curled into a ball as loud snores could now be heard erupting from his mouth.
Dean uncomfortably looked down for a split second, feeling guilty for his insensitive question, “Yes, please. If you could just try to remember. I know this isn’t easy.”
Dean placed a hand on her back as he led her over to one of the couches, “Hi, Julia. I’m Agent DeYoung, I just need to ask you a few questions about last night, if you don’t mind.” If he wasn’t so distracted by the events that happened a mere half hour ago, he’d be impressed with how
His eyes seemed to mainly focus on the bed. The only bed. It was a queen, which seemed like a substitute for two twins.
Dean rolled his eyes at his mocking, "I do plenty of research without you."
Dean's hand loosened around Cas' and came to a halt. His hand now rested gingerly on top of the angel's, which surprisingly to Dean, didn't move away.
Sam was lecturing him about who knows what beside him when Dean turned to frantically grab at the handle, preparing his escape. Unfortunately, the sound of Sam clicking the doors locked rattled through the car before he could push it open. He still refused to go down without a fight, unlocking the doors with the button on his side and going for the handle yet again. However, Sam beat him to the lock button for the second time.
emotions piled behind his eyes as earlier, “There is a difference between can’t and won’t and this is the former. The curse I bare doesn’t allow you to me, Dean.”
in the past.
Dean felt like the anticipation was getting the better of him and he shoved the ornament into Cas’ hand, “Just, hold it up and put it on the—“
It hit Dean the following second.
Cas had finally found the voice to respond, “Dean, I—“
“I’m sure you can, but I’m coming.” He replied and gently grabbed one of the stakes from Cas’ hand.
When Cas was finally in front of him, he noticed how flushed and sweaty Dean was. His eyes widened slightly and his head tilted, “Dean, are you alright?” Concern was laced in his voice.
“Okay, so we know it’s a type of demon because of Julia and also because of the sulfer I found on the windowsill.” Sam recapped what they had already discussed in the car on the way back to the motel. Cas sat on the heart, Sam paced around, and Dean remained in the chair all the way over by the bathroom, exactly where he had pulled it to yesterday.
Dean successfully hid his grumpiness under an artificial smile as he shook the woman’s hand. She wasn’t as skilled at such action and her sadness still seeped through her greeting to him, “Hi, I’m Julia.” Her voice was low and fragile, which was more than likely normal for someone who had just lost their spouse in the most unusual of ways.
“But I—“
He nodded and sighed, “I know.”
Dean made sure to speak slowly and clearly to her, noticing how out of it she seemed to be, “Did you notice anything strange last night that might’ve corresponded with your wife’s passing?”
“Believe it or not, according to this, Cupids have the ability to control the arousal of those they strike with their arrows. My theory is some rogue Cupid out there is turning up the heat too high.” Sam explained.
He faintly heard them call his name as he climbed the steps.
Normal, fully clothed Cas stood from his chair and started walking over to him. Dean nervously joined his hands together in front of his crotch trying to cover himself in the most socially acceptable way he knew how. Then again, he knew that Cas was incredibly inept when it came to human interaction. If he ran and grabbed a frilly pillow off the bed to cover himself, Cas probably wouldn’t even bat an eyelash.
Dean cleared his throat, “N-No. Not really.”
"What's-" Dean paused when he realized a hand was indeed holding his thigh. Cas' hand was being held there forcefully by Dean's sudden needy desperation to be touched by him. Dean almost felt bad, but he remembered that Cas was stronger than him. If he was truly uncomfortable, all he had to do was shove his hand out of his grasp.
Cas leaned in and planted another peck of his lips, “Merry Christmas, Dean.”
He then cut to the chase, “All of the victims were not happily married. Wether it was cheating, money issues, bad sex, or just fighting in general, all of them had their issues. The spouses were all pretty open about it too, which tells me this was something that had been happening for awhile. I think maybe all of them were gearing up for divorce. Also, all the vics had dangerous jobs. Two were cops, one woman served in the army, another was a firefighter, a pilot, a bodyguard, and one of the husbands basically implied her wife was apart of the mafia.”
Dean snickered at that and Sam and Cas both looked at him with disapproval.
Dean swore in that moment his heart sunk to his ass.
“You’re too weak.” Cas stated to him. It came out more as an observation than an insult.
He couldn't help but tell himself,
wasn’t going to tell him he wouldn’t mind if he had the dream again. It did feel incredible, after all.
There was also Thanksgiving. Dean and Cas were working on cooking dinner—because after they’d finally won their free will after all this time they figured they deserved to do holidays right this year, Sam and Eileen were out grabbing more whiskey. Something about them cooking together felt so domestic that it made Dean’s heart flutter.
, “Do you need me to
“Why not?” Dean had asked before Cas even gave him an excuse. He for once wanted his disappointment to be made evident to him.
When deep blue eyes latched on to his, Dean saw something within them he couldn’t even begin to pin down. Shock? Disgust? Something else entirely? Even when Dean quickly looked away, feeling unable to stare at him for more than a second, Cas’ gaze still remained lazer focused on him. It made Dean swallow hard and his heartbeat thud in his ears. His veins were cold and his body went completely stiff. The ache in both his throat and his groin from his previous activity was still very much present.
A couple times had come and gone where Dean really thought he was going to.
Sam began his spiel about the new information he’d acquired, “I interviewed every victim’s spouse, and found some blatant similarities—almost too many, if I’m being honest. It might be hard to narrow down what’s the real contributing factor, which just makes this case that much more difficult—“
Dean swallowed hard and shuddered. He knew exactly what he was alluding to. And it excited him. Probably because he was already hard and horny out of his mind.
Dean finally felt his boner disappear, he removed his hands from his crotch and folded his arms over his chest, “Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn’t have put me under in the first place.”
"You would rather it not be you?" He squinted at him.
He read a little too much about one monster in particular, a Lideric, which came from Hungarian folklore. Most of the lore described it as something hatched from eggs, which had to be laid by chickens (for some fucking reason), and out of the eggs came creatures that would resemble dead relatives. These creatures would then sneak into family member's rooms at night and essentially jerk them off while they sucked them dry of blood from their necks.
He patted his boyfriend on the shoulder and said, “I’ll go get lights. Are we thinking traditional white or rainbow?”
The sound of Sam’s footsteps came to a stop
This is a fight Dean can’t win.
"Dean you can't fall sleep, remember? Dean?"
Real Cas was still staring bewildered at Sam before it set in that what he'd said was a joke. He gave his best attempt at a smile before looking down at his hands.
Sam shrugged, “I’ll keep looking but that’s my best guess for now. Maybe to be sure it’s not a Cupid thing, we should call Cas.”
Then there was silence. Intense, deafening, silence. It was only interrupted by Dean's incessant yawning. Every time he did it Cas would glance over at him for just a second.
“What, Cas?” Sam ignored his brother’s protest in order to catch up to them.
“You’re such a dork.” Dean teased Cas as they loaded the now-netted tree into the truck. Cas held onto the top, while Dean pushed at the trunk. It barely fit, they definitely had to put some force into shutting the backdoor.
Dean was going to argue but he figured Sam wasn’t going to be able to wake him up if something went wrong anyway.
“Dean—“
“Cas, I am not having this conversation.” He snarled. He made a beeline toward the mini fridge. He swung open the door with more force than necessary. His suspicions were correct in that it was stocked with alcohol.
Cas finally stood from his spot and began to pace, “Theoretically yes, it is possible. But it’s not in a Cupid’s nature to commit such acts of violence. The motive is questionable.”
Dean was so deep in thought he barely noticed the familiar squeaking of the impala door as Sam slid in next to him. He tossed his duffel bag into the back seat while he left his laptop resting on one knee, and a stack of old mythology books resting on the other. He was clearly gearing up to do research on the way there.
Cas fiercely placed two fingers on his forehead, knocking him out cold. It was something so spontaneous and something so purely done out of rage that Cas hadn’t realized he’d done it until Dean was snoring against the pillow.
He tried his hardest not to think about him the last few weeks but his name always found a way to flood his conscious. His words were still constantly ringing in his head.
"My ass." Dean scoffed, when he lifted his head, he glared at the angel, "Besides, if this shit all depends on your true happiness, then can't you just change it?"
“Cas, can you please speak plain?” Dean urged him when he got irritated by how cryptic he’d become.
Sam took a large step over his unconscious brother to get to the door, which Cas finally moved out of the way of. Sam patted him on the shoulder as he opened it, “I’ll go start investigating the vic’s spouses, when he wakes up, he’s all yours.” He slightly smirked.
The hole that had been left in the crotch area of the sweatpants, which was previously the side of a quarter, was now huge and bigger than Dean's fist. His dream had been so intense that he'd rabidly torn at the rip in desperation to touch himself. He guessed when his mind was being plagued by incredible sex dreams, it lacked the ability to think logically. The logic that would've told him it was smarter to go through the sweatpants the other, normal way.
When Dean blinked his way back to reality, he had been staring at Cas’ lips for a second too long. He diverted his gaze and prayed he didn’t notice. He tried to steady his voice as he attempted to diffuse Cas’ anger, but his words still came out weak and rough, “Look, I didn’t mean to laugh, and I didn’t mean to be so loud. Just....please don’t tell him.”
“The child clearly didn’t understand the more
Cas raised an eyebrow at him, “Well, are you?”
“Rowena? What do we need Rowena’s intel for?” Dean was now driving around the town aimlessly looking for the motel they’d agreed upon before going. Naturally, when Googling for places to stay, they picked the cheapest one. When Dean rounded the corner, he saw the motel and started pulling in.
Dean immediately shook his head and responded, “No way.” He laughed bitterly and side-eyed his brother.
“I’m not......a little.....but......”He didn’t know what to say. The atmosphere around them had turned so somber it overwhelmed him. A question did eventually make it’s way to the front of Dean’s brain, “What’s the curse?”
crimson. His eyes unapologetically shifted to his lips, and how near they were. How soft they appeared.
Both Cas and Sam looked at him confused. Sam suddenly pushed his laptop aside to join the pile of uneaten food. His eyes narrowed at his brother, "He didn't say anything...."
But Dean needed to stop getting himself worked up over what was probably nothing.
The dream played through his head again as his green eyes locked with Cas’ blue ones. He couldn’t stop his mind from remembering the way his blue eyes intensely watched him as he sucked his cock. The way the hand that was touching his shoulder now had been nestled in the back of his head, or tugging on his leash.....
He realized he was still intensely glaring at the coffee maker so he rubbed his eyes with his hands and dragged his feet back to bed. As he approached the general vicinity again, he saw that Cas had gotten ahold of his laptop that Dean had pushed onto the floor. The screen illuminated his features as he intently read what Dean had been researching right before the commotion outside.
That was enough to catch real Cas and Sam’s attention. When Cas laid a hand on his shoulder, Dean’s skin burned underneath his layers of clothes. He was now more than turned on, with both versions of Cas touching him.
“Save it.” Dean grumbled as he climbed out of the car.
SURPRISE! Sorry I took such a long hiatus from updating, I’ve just been insanely busy and there’s been some major shit going on in my life. But I’m back with two more chapters! I really hope y’all like them because I’ve rewritten them a dozen times lmao. It’s good to be back because I’ve missed writing. Thank y’all for the nice comments and kudos, it means a lot. :)
Dean raised an eyebrow, “A friend? Sam, all your ‘friends’ are currently sitting in this car right now. Who else could you possibly be texting?”
“Ha.” Dean laughed sarcastically, “No, I’m not.”
I'm like 90% sure I don't have any major typos in this but if I missed it don't be afraid to tell me, I hate when I go back and read older fics and I realize they've been up all this time with big mistakes in them lol.
Cas continued on despite Dean's lack of response, "I tried waking you up because I was concerned you were being attacked but nothing worked. Whatever this is has the ability to put you asleep even under impossible circumstances until it allows you to awaken. But, I guess I stopped being as concerned when it appeared you were....enjoying it."
Dean began thinking through all the leads and clues he'd been given thus far. Almost all of them pointed to siren. However, sirens couldn't dream walk--or at least not the ones he'd encountered. Plus, there was another glaring piece of evidence that stood out.
At first she didn’t respond. She gave him a slight glare and her hands balled into fists on the couch. Dean knew this behavior toward loss a little too well.
Dean genuinely looked at him and shrugged, “This one is really hitting me, Cas. I don’t know why.”
, he’d tell himself from time to time when he felt the ring he’d bought months ago burning a hole in his back pocket. He always had it on him, contemplating when the right moment was. If there was ever going to be a right moment.
Dean let his eyes fall shut at the gentle touch and whimpered at him, his tired and muddled brain had forgotten to flood him with shame afterward. He never realized until all of this began happening to him that he liked drifting in the feeling of submission. Especially when it was Cas in control.
They pulled away when Dean noticed Sam and Eileen getting up from their seats and walking toward them.
"Obviously not hard enough." Dean's upper lift stiffened and his arms folded over his chest.
“A succubus? How’d you figure that out?” Sam looked at Dean.
But as much as he couldn’t bring himself to forgive him. He also couldn’t bring himself to hate him either.
“Sam, Today.” Dean interjected when he got impatient with Sam’s rambling.
Cas!” Dean yelled at the empty space next to him, forgetting for a moment about his distorted reality.
"I'd prefer if people experienced as little enjoyment as possible upon seeing my face, Yes. It makes my job easier." Dean huffed. Although the thought of Cas never looking at him in the way he often did ever again sparked a pang in his chest.
“Because I.....” Cas stammered as words began to overwhelm him and none seemed fitting enough to explain. He was provided another second before the modulation of the answer he’d come up with wavered, a new shakiness present that Dean had never heard from him before, “Because I can’t have you. If I have you, I’ll have to go.”
If he got within close enough proximity of Cas, he didn’t know if he was going to punch him or kiss him. Or both.
His laughter didn't cease until Cas angrily stood up and was preparing to storm out of the room, "That's it. I'm telling Sam." He threatened.
He blinked himself back from his delusions. The room had slowed down slightly and he felt like he could more distinctly differentiate reality from not. He still felt too tired to sit up, though.
—————————————————
“No, Sam. I’m done having this discussion.” He said firmly.
But his mind couldn’t stop thinking about naked dream Cas.
Dean instantly exploded, “Have you lost your
When they reached a giant shelf holding what almost felt like an infinite supply of ornaments, Dean turned to the angel while wearing a slight grin on his lips, “Pick out whichever ones you like.”
However, Cas was still dead set on it. He threatened, “Dean, you can either fall sleep willingly or I’ll put you out myself.”
Sam wore a welcoming smile while Dean trailed a few inches behind him with his signature frown. He begrudgingly dragged his boots against the pavement like a child.
A hand found it’s way to the back of Dean’s neck, scratching nervously. A blush his complexion, he made sure to keep his face angled downward at the best attempt of trying to hide it. Even if it was pointless in doing so. He had already put himself on full display in the car.
Dean then snatched Cas’ ornament from him. He sarcastically said, “Happy?”
he was coming again.
Cas took his silence as a yes. He looked out the window for a brief moment, watching cars that drove by. His gentle tone continued, he said his next sentence so quietly that Dean barely heard him, “I missed you too, you know.”
, it was a disaster.
Cas blinked, clearly not expecting the kind gesture presented in his words. However, his eyes remained fixated on Dean’s face and not the object he was holding. His mouth opened slightly before he came up with an answer, “No, that’s okay.” He turned fully around so his body was facing Dean. Dean could see that he was holding another ornament, which was mostly sheltered by his hands. But from the colors that peaked out between his fingers, it looked to be the hunting riffle.
As Dean turned to storm out, Cas entered the room, blocking his escape. Cas tilted his head in confusion as his gaze also focused on the bed, “Well......this is festive.”
As they began driving toward the new crime scene, Dean felt himself grow drowsier until his head was lazily resting against the window.
Dean knew this but still decided to comment otherwise, “You really know how to flatter a girl, Cas.”
Dean naturally moved away disappointed for what seemed like the tenth time that day. From the corner of his vision he could see Cas hopelessly trying to divert his gaze anywhere except the man on the bed beside him.
Dean groaned, “Fuck, don’t tell Sam.”
“Look, you wanted me to work this case, I’ll work this case, okay?” Dean defended and Sam seemed to drop the subject, because at least he had gotten him to agree to stay. Dean didn’t mention that the reason he was suddenly eager to work the case was because he literally had no choice unless he felt like dying. That then brought him to his curiosity about what Sam knew so far, “So,
"Dean, did you hear me?" Sam snapped his fingers in front of his face.
me to be all sulky and depressed and lonely as an excuse to fix it.” Dean huffed and opened a third bottle.
.” Dean practically hissed. He knew all of the heavy emotions were weighing him down the more and more he sat inside the car.
Another second passed and Cas was still sitting upright like he’d been before Dean changed in the bathroom, he now looked confused, “I said, Do you need me to move?”
Dean ferociously yawned and then felt
Dean wore a polite smile for the scowling couple who looked to be in their 70s, “Is there a problem here?”
He knew that his cock was fully erect in his jeans right now, he thought it was best to keep himself facing away from Cas so he wouldn’t see. The real Cas. The Cas that
Then, he was holding one shaped like a baseball, which he was confused by considering Cas had never once expressed interest in sports in general. Until he turned it over and read
Hi! So sorry this took so damn long! I promise I'll try to get the next chapter up faster, which will probably be the last one.
Dean blinked at him, not sure what to say. He almost thought Cas was joking but there was (of course!) no sign of amusement written across his features.
He then searched through his duffle bag for a pair of sweatpants. Some of Sam’s clothes had gotten mixed up with his so all he found were an old, beat up grey pair with
But Dean clearly knew what it meant because he was rolling his eyes and pulling his arm slightly closer to the shelf, “Yes, I’m serious.”
Dean gulped and just stared wide-eyed at him, imagining the absolute catastrophe of the kind of dream Cas would witness if he were knocked out suddenly, possibly being too caught off guard to relinquish any control over what fantasy his mind spewed out. Dean assumed the only death Cas was going to allow for him was one of embarrassment.
. His posture straightened as he attempted to give his undivided attention to the the conversation that had started beside him. Based on the way real Cas was sneaking glances in his direction, he seemed to know what was going on with him and took the liberty of addressing Sam, "You said you slept well?"
Dean snapped his head up and matched his intense gaze. He felt caught off guard by his question and he didn’t have a snarky reply at the ready. So he simply looked away and started fiddling with the plastic label on the vodka before taking another swing. He was starting to become used to the burn in his chest that came with it.
They exited the Impala and approached Cas.
Dean tested it again just for good measure.
Meanwhile, Cas struggles to hold back on taking what he wants.
He was being preyed upon by a
Dean lifted his head up in a panic to look at him, “What?”
A part of Dean felt terrible by how sadly and sincerely he said those words. But another part of him wanted to convince himself he deserved it.
Cas’ face sulked and didn’t try to reply. His look of sadness and guilt returned in a flash and it made Dean feel worse than he expected. Regardless of what Cas did, Dean hated when he upset him. Yet, he always found himself doing it anyway. Because that was the only thing he knew how to do: hurt the people he cared about.
What he blurted out next interrupted Sam quietly conversing with Cas, “Hallucinations.”
“That is all the details….at least the PG ones…” Dean mumbled. He knew right after he said the last part that it was a mistake because he could hear the sheets on the bed ruffle as Cas shifted uncomfortably.
He guessed that was one way to end a conversation gone stale.
, Dean?”
Dean then felt an instant wave of panic and he jumped at him, snatching his arm. Cas scowled and pulled it free from his grasp. Dean then had to resort to his second option, which was beating him to the door and blocking his path by outstretching his arms across the corresponding wall.
Dean felt himself on the edge of forgiveness, just to wipe the despair off of Cas’ face. So, he became determined to shut him up before he did it, “I’d prefer to get drunk and pass out again in peace if you don’t mind.” He gave him a fake smile before downing the first bottle. It burned on the way down and tasted exactly the way cheap motel vodka should.
Dean was unsure what he meant until he began to replay his dream in his mind. He remembered the succubus, telling him he wasn’t allowed to come without permission. He remembered hearing it’s threat to eat him if he did. And then Cas had shown up......
Cas repositioned himself beside Dean as he laid down. Dean made the effort of climbing into the covers as if anything about this was normal.
Cas strolled over toward the heart shaped bed and sat down on the edge of the point. He folded his hands together in his lap and looked up at Dean, “I am not
“Anytime I’m really tired, I start having hallucinations.”
Unfortunately, all the coffee in the world wasn't enough to keep him from shutting his eyes and accidentally falling asleep.
He thought being openly affectionate with Cas would be awkward at first but it wasn’t. They held hands, kissed each other’s cheeks, made love, as easy as breathing air. It was like they’d been doing it for a decade. He figured even if the two of them weren’t weird about it, at least Sam would be. But he wasn’t. If Dean was being honest, he was barely even surprised.
When they returned to their motel room, it was already nighttime and very little light came through the window. Sam repeated the action of tossing the keys onto the table and he began shrugging off his jacket, “Alright, thanks to Dean, we’re stuck sharing a bed for the night. What’re your plans, Cas?”
Dean then broke their matching gaze by looking him up and down shamelessly before turning his head toward his now agitated brother behind him, “He’s not some attack dog you can just sick on me, Sammy.”
He thought back to his dreams again, trying to block out the erotic content in favor of the important things. And he remembered in his earlier dream, when he'd first encountered the creature. The woman's eyes had turned completely black, albeit, just for a second. But it was enough to send Dean's fingers rapidly typing against the keyboard again. He used the keywords,
“Dean, I’m sorry.” Cas apologized with complete sincerity. His eyes were wide with regret and sorrow. They were pleading for Dean to let him have what they used to.
This was fortunately enough to drag him away from his delusions for a split second, "W-what?"
“I don’t think this is the appropriate time to have this discussion.” Cas deflected, guilt invading his voice. Something inside him was holding back the urge to say what he wanted. Which, Dean should know, because he himself had been feeling that for over a decade.
Dean figured that made some sort of sense.
Dean still couldn’t bring himself to look at him.
Sam scoffed, “You? Researching? Without me asking?"
“Dean......I-“
“Tell you what? Go get yourself your own room. It’s on the house.” Dean tried to flash him a genuine smile as he pulled out his credit card and held it out to him.
“I know you don’t want to. But this whole standoff you two have going is getting ridiculous. He’s your best friend. You’ll have to talk to him eventually.” Sam gave him his usual puppy-dog eyed look that he only used when he needed something from Dean.
That realization led to Dean typing nonsense into the keyboard, trying to see if anything relevant came up. He was astonished to find an overwhelming amount of results for lore on all kinds of sexually deviant creatures, which equally made things easier and harder. Easier because he knew he was closer to narrowing it down. Harder because there were still many possibilities to narrow down from.
Okay, First off I'm sooooo sorry for leaving y'all on that cliffhanger for so long. I wrote a chapter, hated it, rewrote it, hated that too, and then the third time was the charm. So here she is!
He then proceeded to shrug off his suit jacket and undo his shirt while ridding himself of his shoes the same way he’d watched Sam earlier.
As he exited, he felt a cool breeze hit his crotch and he realized the sweatpants had quite a noticeable hole through them, which was a few inches shy of exposing part of his cock.
He did his best to just ignore it and with the disappointment and anger coursing through his system, it wasn’t hard to do.
That was when Cas felt the need to make his presence to him known. He sat in a chair in the corner of the room that was closest to the bed. His voice chimed in behind him, startling Dean, “Your lungs are rather powerful.”
There’s going to be one last chapter after this but the story is pretty much done! It’s been really fun writing this story and I really appreciate y’all sticking through it with me lol.
“More or less, yes.” Cas plainly answered looking back toward Sam.
“My dream. You....” But sentences didn’t come easy to the Winchester. His brain still felt hazy and tired. Even with the intense arousal coursing through him, keeping him a bit more alert, he could still fall asleep at the drop of a hat.
Sam and Cas briefly glanced at him in annoyance before continuing with their brainstorming session, “If it’s not a Cupid, then what? Witch?”
(See the end of the chapter for
thing that could be heard. For Dean,
The woman stepped closer to him and answered, “Yes. We were minding our own business and your friend here told us if we so much as looked at this tree, he’d tackle us.”
But, Dean figured going along with it would be better than having to
Dean knew it all had to be psychic.
He then watched Cas' eyes pull together and his forehead scrunch in confusion, "Being plagued with sexually intimate dreams by a supernatural entity is something brothers keep from each other?" Dean then almost wanted to laugh again at his misunderstanding. However, he managed to keep a straight face as the feeling of amusement finished washing over him and simply dissipated out of his system.
Especially since Cas was looking up at Dean a moment later, questioning him, “A succubus?”
It took quite a bit of effort for Cas to both drag Dean into the car--The car he'd taken from the bunker and had been driving since he'd been off on his own, and also keep Dean awake. He had to keep one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the hunter's shoulder to shake him awake. Dean tried his best as he drifted in and out of consciousness. Meanwhile, fantasy Cas sat on his lap while whispering dirty things in his ear. While also promising to eat him, which left Dean feeling equally turned on and terrified.
Dean thought.
I presume you mean ideal for intercourse.” Cas bluntly said and then proposed an idea, “That would make it a siren.”
Cas’ lips were curved downward and his eyes seemed heavier than usual. The exact same look he had telling him it was
"I was fortunate enough to get the location just before you...."
"Cas." Was all he croaked out.
When they had walked to almost the very end of the motel, Dean came to a halt as his eyes landed on the desired room number.
Cas’ pupils were dilated so large his eyes were practically black and his smile was larger than he’d ever seen it before. His cheeks were just as wet as Dean’s, “Is that a yes?”
And that’s when his mouth cut itself off at the sight of a gold ring hanging right in front of him.
But I’m secretly patting myself on the back because this shits kinda hot lol
“Well.....while you were dreaming....you um..." Cas trailed off unsure of how to phrase his explanation. This was also when the memory of him pulling his hand out of his sweatpants right after he woke up had hit Dean like a ton of bricks. He knew then that that had to be what he was struggling to say. That he had started touching himself in his sleep and Cas had watched him do it. That thought strangely excited him more than it did mortify him. He figured he must've been onto something earlier when he theorized that victims were forced into a constant state of arousal. Dean definitely felt overstimulated. It was taking a lot to keep himself calm sitting right next to Cas.
Dean coughed and felt his erection still straining against his zipper, "Trust me, you'd remember it."
Dean didn’t even take his gaze away from Cas’s face, still desperately pleading for him to just let his plan go smoothly. To let him actually
But he couldn’t let himself believe that. That Sam would seriously think him and normal, fully clothed Cas would hook up.
“I tried everything and nothing woke you. And you were asleep for two hours, which is even more peculiar because angel grace usually doesn’t have the power to keep someone asleep for more than thirty minutes—especially mine.” Cas admitted, his eyes then diverted to the ugly pink carpet.
“Well, ain’t that a bitch.” Dean uttered, fully sitting up, “In the car earlier—what the hell was that?”
Cas was staring up at him unable to hide his worry in his expression, "Dean, tell me what's wrong?"
But it didn’t stop Dean from shoving away the good and only focusing on the bad. He didn’t respond to Cas’ greeting, instead he walked past him, bumping his shoulder as he did, and headed inside the motel lobby to check in.
A hand was placed on his shoulder, which only confused Dean more considering there were already hands on him. He didn't know who was who anymore.
Dean shook his head and cut him off, “No, I don’t want an explanation. For anything. Not from you.” His words came out harsher than he felt. They felt like venom rolling off his tongue.
Dean's head lazily lifted from his chest as he chimed in, "What about me?"
Considering, according to Cas, his lungs were
And any suggestion of reaching out to him was met with immediate rejection. Sam knew that but it didn’t stop him from still trying, “Look, I know you and him are in the middle of a falling out—“
Cas was also starting to get slightly irritated, “No, take this one.” His voice grew deeper, which was usually the first signal to Dean that his fellow companion was pissed off.
Dean’s voice went up a whole octive as he started outstretching his hand. The ring had been living in his jeans for months, it had practically become apart of him, and now he was finally giving it away. Everything about that terrified him. His voice was quiet, “How about you do us the honor of putting the first ornament on the tree, huh?”
Love y’all, thank you for taking the time to read this. I’ve loved writing it!
Dean couldn’t help but doubt him, “Cupid? Yeah, right. What makes you think that?”
The shifting of Dean’s hips made him realize he still had his hand firmly wrapped around his cock. He had been stroking himself, following along with his dream.
Cas then told him and the sadness he’d exhibited earlier began to make perfect sense, “I will be taken by the empty upon experiencing my moment of true happiness.”
Dean admitted.
“You mean besides the screaming in her sleep that I couldn’t wake her from no matter how hard I tried?” She questioned bitterly, her nice exterior fading away at a moment’s notice.
“People in Chesterfield, Missouri are claiming their spouses died from wet dreams.” Sam repeated to him, this time spinning the laptop around so his brother could read the article he’d found. And sure enough, the heading said exactly what he’d just told him twice now.
“Guess so.”
"Calling Sam, he's going to have to meet us there."
Cas’ eyes flicked down toward his lap and a hand was raised to scratch the back of his neck, “Oh....right.” He sounded like he absolutely knew something.
Apparently Dean was too quiet for too long because soon he was getting called on by the angel. He had apparently said something else that he hadn't heard, "What?"
Cas realized with what Dean had said, despite reassuring him, had let him know that there was a clear misunderstanding. That Cas hadn’t explained himself well enough, which he really hadn’t. He couldn’t have been more vague if he tried. Saying nothing at all would’ve probably elicited the same response out of Dean.
As much as he wanted to do it that night, he wanted to prevent the bunker from burning down a little bit more.
The succubus drains more out of Dean than any of them were anticipating. He struggles to both stay awake and know what’s real.
Dean nervously cleared his throat as his hands began shaking. Sam must’ve immediately recognized what was about to happen because Dean watched him elbow Eileen to look up out of the corner of his eye. Both of them weren’t even able to contain their grins. Usually, having an audience would probably stop him dead, but knowing Sam and Eileen were supportive and wanted this to happen, actually made it easier.
The angel shrugged and searched around the room for potential activities to keep himself occupied before he suggested, “Try to dig into more lore and learn about what we’re hunting.”
