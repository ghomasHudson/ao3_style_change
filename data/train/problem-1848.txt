Gerrie looked to John. “It’s ‘Mother’ now. It’s only ‘Mother’ when he’s upset with me.” She turned to her son. “And it’s no use being rude to a guest. Go get yourself cleaned up; you smell like a barn. Then you can join us for tea, if you can be civil.”
“Mrs. Grossman?” John called again as he went to the doorway that connected the kitchen to the rest of the house. He was reluctant to wear his boots any farther than that and had been hoping the housekeeper could run up and get his gloves for him, so saving him from having to remove his footwear altogether. But now the two teacups had him curious. “Did we have company?”
John kept his expression neutral. “It’s not a problem; I was waiting up for Sherlock anyway.” Somewhere in the back of his mind he wondered at how easily the lie surfaced.
John glanced back at the collection of grave and concerned faces behind them as he followed the doctor back through the doors.
“The stone and wood come directly from the land here at Weald House,” Gerrie informed John proudly. “Now you sit—” She indicated a polished wood table situated near two windows at the far end of the room. “And I’ll start the water. I wonder where Chloe could be?”
John thought about it for a moment, recalling the marks Moriarty had made. “The second burn?” It wasn’t, as he remembered, very far from the first.
Was this it, then? Was Mycroft warning him that Charles—whoever he might be—was loose? Then how old was the letter? How long had the sentence been? Why not just warn Sherlock directly?
“Which means he’s already at the museum.” Sherlock rose. “Contact Lestrade. I’m going after the lily.”
Fifteen minutes later, John was wishing he had taken Lestrade’s advice to at least stop for tea, since “almost there” to Sherlock amounted to a twenty-minute walk. They had to be halfway back to Baker Street, in John’s estimation. Then Sherlock stopped in front of a building, and after a moment John recognized it as the one they’d been in the previous afternoon, one that looked much like any other building in the area. John wasn’t sure how Sherlock’s internal compass worked, but he couldn’t help admiring it.
The ceremony was set for late afternoon, meaning the day would be spent preparing. The tents would go up, the tables and chairs were to be set out, the cooking and baking and decorating . . .
But Irene ignored him. “It’s not defense; Sherl’s never had a particular interest in his own safety.”
“But he never gave you drugs.” The statement had the tone of something that had been asked at least once before.
SARAH KNOCKED SOFTLY but wasn’t surprised when she received no answer. She eased the door open a fraction. “Um . . .”
“And you don’t get that he’s keeping you at a distance so that he can make himself believe that he doesn’t care.”
She took a subversive sort of gratification from his startled expression when he turned over. “What are you doing here?”
Sherlock stopped just short of asking what Eoin’s parents had been thinking by giving him a name like that. It occurred to him belatedly that he probably didn’t have much leeway for throwing stones in that department, but at least his name had a ring to it.
John nodded. “And two hours might make all the difference,” he added in an infuriatingly reasonable tone.
Sherlock stood and Lestrade turned at the sound of the flat’s front door squeaking open. “Sherlock? Lestrade?” John called in the tone of someone trying to find a person in a library—that is, wanting to be heard while also staying quiet.
The test had been designed to please John, or at least placate him, but Sherlock found it remarkably easy to fall asleep despite their contiguity. Still, when he opened his eyes in the early hours of the following morning, Sherlock was momentarily confused. In part because he’d awoken with the thought,
Sherlock followed John’s gaze and cursed through his teeth as the bell rang. He froze for second, then jumped to close the morning room door while instructing John, “Dishevel yourself.”
The snake in John’s stomach slithered and his eyes drifted again to the desk, but he was already shaking his head. “No. I’m not going to kiss you.”
John took Charles’s measure in one unflinching stare. Not as old as John had expected; Charles likely didn’t have more than a decade on Sherlock, which meant he’d been a young teacher at the time of his misadventure, possibly just out of university himself. So this was no serial predator, not yet at any rate. Either Charles Whitcombe really had been swayed by passion or he’d had the singular misfortune of choosing Sherlock Holmes as his first, and ultimately only, conquest.
Sherlock, with his innate sense of direction, knew exactly where they were. “This way,” he said, though he didn’t start walking until he was sure John would walk with him. He was sorry to see that John showed some reluctance. But maybe that was only because they were going back the way they’d come, closer to the crime scene? “It spooked you,” remarked Sherlock, and this time the look John gave him was something akin to exasperation.
He glanced back at the letter, skipping the intimate details and going straight to the last paragraph.
John glared at Sherlock, who acted as if he didn’t notice, then stalked out of the room, returning a few minutes later with the adhesive. He handed it to Sarah, and she perched herself on the edge of a table. “Let’s take a look,” she said.
Sherlock was about to ask what thing she was talking about when John said, “End of July. I should be well enough by then.”
“I will.” John ended the call and stared at his phone a moment. Maybe Sherlock would be bored enough to want to return to London early, regardless of any promises he made to his brother. In the meantime, John felt he should at least call Sarah before she started checking hospitals for him and his flatmate.
He went to his door and pulled it open just as his flatmate appeared ready to disappear into his own room. “Sherlock.”
“They’re going to figure it out. I mean, Michael might not know, but plenty of people do, and if he says anything—”
“—can’t be driving if you’re not well,” Mrs. Grossman was saying in her low and rapid voice, though it seemed to John to be echoing down a long tunnel. Then she turned, saw her employer and visibly brightened. “See, here he is now. Mr. John . . .” But she stopped uncertainly when she saw John’s expression.
John opened his mouth, but Moriarty put a finger up, gesturing with his head toward the door behind him. “Sleeping,” he mouthed as he stepped forward. “We were starting to worry you weren’t coming. But we’ve had a nice visit. I was even able to untie him after he lost consciousness. The first time.
John cleaned as much as he needed to get a look at the location of the actual wound. Not the heart, thank whatever God was in heaven, but nearly. So close, so very close . . . The ribs were almost certainly broken, shattered even, and there was a real chance the left lung had been pierced. When had Eoin become such a good shot? Had he always been, or had he practiced for this?
John fumbled for his phone then struggled to dial while keeping pace with his companion’s long strides. “Can we at least get a cab?”
Sherlock was quiet for a minute before offering, in the hopes of amusing his friend, “He threw a book at me.”
a worrier at heart,” Patrick agreed. “It’s what makes him good at his job. And at being a big brother.” Sherlock merely sniffed in derision, and Patrick laughed. “I take it I shouldn’t let the boss know. Anything else? Or does Irene have it covered?”
Still he felt himself listing to his right, rocking as the house moved beneath him. He heard Mrs. Grossman yelp in alarm—had there been an earthquake?—and then there were hands on him, steadying him, but he couldn’t focus; his vision remained fuzzy. “Is everyone all right?” John asked thickly, or tried to, but he couldn’t be sure the words came out correctly.
“Then go sleep in my bed.” And to forestall any further argument, Sherlock pulled off the counterpane. “My God, what are you wearing?”
A door on the other side of the bed swung open and Gerrie peeked through. “There you are. Where did the two of you disappear to?”
The release of tension as relief swept through him threatened John’s equilibrium once more. “Good,” he said faintly. “Because that wouldn’t have been . . . safe, or . . . or healthy.”
John laughed and shook his head. “Sherlock’s not the type to waste his efforts on a dog. Much less more than one.”
Sherlock, meanwhile, was slowly relaxing. “They wouldn’t,” he said. “And if it were Moriarty, we’d be dead already.”
Sherlock’s eyes darted to John’s face, which was drawn down in seemingly sorrowful lines. John always did wear his feelings openly, something that alternately fascinated and irritated Sherlock. But now there was another reaction, something lion-like that made Sherlock feel the need to guard and protect John. Never mind that John obviously knew.
Now John sighed and rolled onto his back, which Sherlock counted as progress at least. “What do you want?”
, John told himself. But another part of him responded that if Mycroft had meant it for Sherlock, he wouldn’t have hidden it in John’s shoe.
Mycroft took a sip of his tea and made a face that suggested it also tasted like sweaty socks. “And did she say anything else?”
Sherlock temporarily halted scrubbing the hardwood where the rug had been soaked through. “Why? It can be reupholstered.”
Once they’d shooed their landlady from the flat, John and Sherlock collapsed next to one another on the sofa, though Sherlock almost immediately winced from the stabbing sensation this caused, shifting to try and find a comfortable way to sit. John frowned, his face lined with both exhaustion and concern. “I can give you some ibuprofen for that,” he said. “I’m afraid I don’t keep anything stronger any more, but I’ll go to the clinic tomorrow and get you something.”
Then Sherlock stood. He swayed precariously, and John tensed, prepared to catch him if he fell. But Sherlock steadied himself and moved around the bed. “Where was he?”
“Sorry?” Rings, cars, Lestrade . . . John couldn’t pretend to keep up with Sherlock’s erratic way of thinking.
John squelched a tiny swell of concern. Sherlock hadn’t wanted John with him and was capable of managing on his own.
“We, uh, manage.” John couldn’t stop himself from looking around. The room seemed impossibly white; how did it stay clean?
Sherlock eyed John as if he were honestly thinking it over. “So I do,” he said at length and stood. After making sure his legs wouldn’t buckle beneath him, John did as well.
Eoin had started at the clinic the past fall, though John had not taken much notice of him. Later, after John and Eoin had begun seeing each other, Sarah admitted that everyone had been aware of Eoin’s obvious crush on him. She’d come into his office for a tea break, something they’d made a habit of each afternoon.  “It was really sad, watching him make the dejected puppy face every time you walked past.”
With a growl of protest, Anderson handed it over. “Get him out of here,” Sherlock said to Lestrade as he turned toward John’s room.
“Yes,” John echoed absently, “very good of him.” He rose from the chair and Gerrie followed suit. “I, uh, really only came to make sure Sherlock was all right; he left rather suddenly. But it seems as if—”
“None,” John conceded, “but it might to Elyse. Jeremy came around with that—” He jabbed a finger in Brandywine’s direction.
“He’s all yours now,” said John, retrieving his shoes. He went into the pantry and found a ring of keys labeled GARAGES, then went back upstairs to grab his bag and get fresh socks. He stuck his head into Sherlock’s room for one last check before pulling his things together and going to seek out his car.
They reached Baker Street a couple hours later, and Sherlock was still asleep. John didn’t look forward to waking him; Sherlock was always irritable when roused from a deep slumber. Maybe he could just finish off his nap in the car and come inside after?
“You don’t get that back until we’re fully done with the investigation. In the meantime, I need to talk to you, and Anderson’s coming with a swab kit for the doctor.”
The martlet, then, was swiftly on its way . . . working tirelessly . . . for this castle? For the safekeeping of something or someone who was identified with it?
Now John took a seat in it and watched with undisguised fascination as Moriarty painstakingly took the two or three steps to reach him. It was as if the man’s entire body had become misaligned, nothing moving quite smoothly or in tandem.
She shrugged and went back to her work. Or online shopping. John figured one was as likely as the other.
John was subversively gratified to see he had his flatmate’s full attention now. Sherlock had gone very still in his seat, his bright eyes concentrated on John’s face.
A shiver ran through Christopher. “If you’re worried about it, I promise my current boyfriend isn’t the jealous type.”
Sherlock glanced back at the wreckage of his hospital bed—the abandoned IV tubes, crumpled sheet, discarded gown—and replied, “It’s a bit late now. Where are my shoes?”
“Must be for you to have been gone so long,” said Sarah. “I checked hospitals, you know. I was wondering whether to file missing persons.”
“Your old room is still free,” said Mycroft, neatly removing the glass from his brother’s hand. “Don’t think I’ve even gone in it.”
“Oh, God,” she said as realization dawned. “Oh, Sherl. Okay, I’m coming. I’ll hop the next flight. You—you should go see your brother, stay with him until I get there.”
Once again, John hadn’t the least clue what Sherlock was talking about. “Is that supposed to turn me on?”
With a thud, John’s medical bag landed next to where he knelt, and beside that, Irene. “You have to help him, John.”
Startled awake, Sherlock glanced at John, whose eyes were still closed. “New York,” Sherlock echoed flatly, sounding almost as if he’d never heard of it, much less been there short of a week before.
Sherlock sighed but complied by rising. He moved with greater ease these days, though he still suffered the occasional twinge. Now as he paused, John turned to him with a small frown. “All right?”
Lestrade saw the way they locked eyes, and it suddenly occurred to him that Sherlock hadn’t called his flatmate for a second opinion at all. He’d called John to show him. But what did they perceive in this, Lestrade wondered? What did this tableau mean to them? Was it a taunt? A warning? Or just awful coincidence?
John finally met Sherlock’s gaze. “But you never wonder for my sake, do you? It’s only because you need something to occupy yourself with. You don’t care; you’re just curious.”
Sherlock laughed. Irene was far from poor, though she put up a good front. It wouldn’t do to advertise her light fingers by living beyond what, for all intents and purposes, counted as her means. Though Sherlock privately thought she should at least spring for better furniture.
JOHN KNEW HE was trying the patience of the sales assistant, but this was perhaps the most important purchase he’d ever made, and it needed to be perfect.
“You know Irene,” said Christopher, crossing to the minibar, “she probably had this planned. Take your coat off at least.”
And as Sherlock began to fall, John broke free of his stasis. He took Sherlock’s right arm and helped Mycroft ease Sherlock down.
“Not this time,” another voice said from somewhere in the room. A smooth, masculine voice. “Not yet anyway.”
, John thought as he watched Sherlock scan the room. He bent over and retrieved the abused shirt. “I’ll go and call Sarah.”
Sherlock stood staring at the ancient Greek artifact, and Irene stood watching him for a minute before finally asking, “Do you want to tell me what happened?”
“That’s Mother; never met a color she didn’t like. Yellow . . .” Sherlock seemed to be considering the array of doors.
“But they’re so . . . worldly, I guess. God, even Irene is more stylish than I am,” John realized, the idea suddenly depressing him.
“It doesn’t make sense,” Sherlock insisted. “You wouldn’t hide a suicide note. You want people to find it.”
Lestrade put his hands up. “We shouldn’t even be in here yet. Should’ve waited for the team to arrive. ” He squinted out the glass. “I see the top and bottom of the bed, but the curtains hide the middle . . . Maids haven’t fixed it up yet, eh?”
SHERLOCK ENTERED THE kitchen with the intention of going out for a walk. The house was far too crowded now—it had been almost from the start, of course, but his mother’s presence pushed some kind of internal limit—and Sherlock felt the keen need for space. But when he saw Mrs. Grossman and Mrs. Watson huddled over yet another project for the ceremony, Sherlock nearly turned around. For where they were, Irene was sure to be nearby.
“Okay,” John said again before disappearing into the bathroom, leaving Sherlock to wonder if he’d been too hasty. But after what had to be one of the fastest showers on record (and Sherlock presumed this was because John wanted to eat; John always woke up hungry), John emerged and said, “We should have it at the house.”
“I should have told you,” Sherlock said. “I forgot that just because it didn’t mean anything to me didn’t necessarily mean it wouldn’t mean anything to you.”
But the attendant knew nothing about it, and neither did anyone else who came to speak to him: a concierge, a bellman, the hotel manager—this last to whom John showed the note he’d received.
“Well, first I was interrogated and forcibly fed biscuits by Mrs. Hudson, and now I’m cleaning,” said Sherlock. An area rug had already been rolled up, the furniture that once stood on it pushed aside chaotically.
“I’m going to have to ask him, Sherlock,” Lestrade warned. “Do you think he’s well enough for that yet?”
John nodded again and looked over his shoulder at his pillow. He shivered and began to pull ineffectually at the bedspread.
The sense of dread deepened. John had not guessed anything of the kind, but now he was both terrified and compelled to finish reading what Sherlock had to say.
John was forced to compose his reply between shudders. “No . . . God, no . . . why . . . would I . . .?”
“What?” Sarah practically yelped in surprise. “Oh, uh, I don’t really know; I didn’t have much chance to speak to him.”
Sherlock brushed past where John stood in the doorway, moving into the living room in search of his shoes. He pumped the fount a bit by saying, “Yes, but you’ll do it anyway.”
, thought John grimly. The wrapped body on the bed didn’t move, so hauling in a deep breath of his own, John stepped toward it. One, two . . . He found himself counting the steps in order to keep his mind off what he might discover. He ended at six, pulled over one of the richly upholstered chairs from beside the windows and sat down.
It irked him more than a little that, thus far, none of the breaks in the case had stemmed from his own effort. He planned to rectify that now.
“I mean, I’d give you my dad’s but he’s using it at the moment.” John stopped. Had that been unkind? He hadn’t meant to brag that his father was still alive while Sherlock’s wasn’t. John snuck a glance at his companion, but as usual Sherlock’s expression gave nothing away.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed; he was unsure why his words had gone without acknowledgement. But he discarded his pique in the face of more immediate needs. “Yes. Why?”
“Don’t we all. Don’t suppose you’re interested in some international art heists?” Lestrade asked, half joking.
LESTRADE STOOD IN the bedroom doorway and considered the two men in the bed. Not wanting to break the heavy silence by speaking, or even moving, it felt like all he could do was stand there and take in the scene.
There was someone on the bed. Not “someone” of course, it was Sherlock, but John found thinking about it that way only served to paralyze him. And anyway, it wasn’t so obviously Sherlock because the person was wrapped in the bedspread, though some of the hair was visible. And that was definitely Sherlock’s hair.
Irene stopped walking and turned to face him squarely. “God you’re dense sometimes! There’s no easy way to go from mourning someone to marrying them, no switch to flip. There’s rewiring involved.”
“But this morning Chloe brought what she thought was a trump card,” Sherlock went on. “She confronted Henry with the news of her relationship with Elyse.”
John heard the door open. Maybe Sherlock . . . But no, that wasn’t likely. Sherlock never thought of anyone but himself.
And now Mycroft turned to look at the doors John had pushed through minutes earlier. “I think I’ll go up just the same.”
“Oh,” answered Sarah, visibly affected, but she rallied quickly. “And I suppose that was one time you chose to listen to him.”
Maybe John was downstairs helping Mrs. Hudson with something. But not at this hour, surely. Mrs. Hudson was almost certainly sound asleep. Though if, against the odds, John
John was attempting to push the wet and clinging broadcloth from Sherlock’s shoulders. “I thought you don’t dream.”
SHERLOCK LEANED IN again to whisper in Christopher’s ear. “Sorry to disappoint you, Christopher, but I’m not angry and I’m not interested.”
John stared at her for a moment. Looked at Sarah, who seemed to be waiting to see what he’d say. Finally he ran his hands over his face and said, “If you need me, I’ll be . . .” And with that he staggered off toward his room.
He caught up with Sherlock in the corridor outside Mycroft’s flat. “Should have kept my key,” the detective muttered after trying the knob and finding it locked.
Irene gave him a quizzical look. “I know they weren’t on speaking terms at first, but what about everything Mycroft did for John when he needed rehab?”
Lestrade rolled his shoulders and shifted on the sofa. “Do you, uh . . . Do you think, then, that the samples we took from the sheets will match you and Whitcombe?”
John frowned at the x-ray. “No immediate danger to his organs, but I’d feel better if we taped them.”
“That people know about Markham? Seems unlikely his firm is eager to let one of their top clients know; they’d at least want to formulate some kind of plan or proposal to keep the work.”
John located his boots—lovingly cleaned by Mrs. Grossman after the last time he’d worn them, which had been the day Sherlock had returned—and decided to carry them downstairs and put them on in the kitchen. He hoped this might forestall any grousing on Sherlock’s part about the additional wait, though Sherlock had been deeply considerate on the whole when it came to John’s recovery, including the fact that it still took John more time to do some things. Like dress.  Bending over the wound in his left side, working the stiffness out of his right shoulder . . . These things were getting easier, but it was taking longer than John liked. Sherlock, on the other hand, was almost eerily patient in these matters, even solicitous, except when in a pet about something else. Like the imminent arrival of future in-laws.
Now John was getting annoyed. “Can I go back to London now? Since you don’t really need me after all?”
“That’s just . . . incredibly creepy,” said John. “Isn’t it?” he asked when Sherlock only responded with a blank stare.
“Sherl?” John’s eyes flicked toward Sherlock, who didn’t turn. “Well when you figure it out, let me know.”
Sherlock had gathered up his crumpled clothes and was thinking he would need to fetch fresh ones. “Under normal circumstances, yes. But not today.”
“You mean we weren’t all here waiting for you,” Mycroft interpreted. “No, I’m afraid not. Irene, Mrs. Grossman and Mrs. Watson are in the throes of planning, and Mr. Watson has taken to visiting with any number of the locals in an attempt to keep out of the way.”
John ran his hands over his face. “How are you not on section right now?” Though whether he was talking to Sherlock or himself was not entirely clear. Pulling himself together, he directed Sherlock with a bit more authority, “Take your shirt off.”
Sherlock moved his head just slightly against whatever he was lying on; something padded that smelled like a memory. Soap? No, shampoo. On a pillow. John’s pillow.
Eoin’s lack of hesitation widened the crack. Sherlock had never said it, of course, and neither had John. Confronting Sherlock with unvarnished emotion was akin to assaulting him; John would never have gone that far without being sure Sherlock was ready.
Wanting to make it clear that he was fine with her having a guest—and also a little curious to meet the object of Mrs. Grossman’s affection—John braved the hallway despite his boots.
“We’re coming up on it now,” said Sherlock, pointing. “This wooded area on the far side of the pond that stretches up to the clearing around Corring Hall.”
Like a surgeon wielding a scalpel, Sherlock mentally severed his physical awareness of John and discarded it in favor of watching the glow that crept around the edges of the curtains from the street lamps outside slowly give way to the first fingers of sunlight. But every now and then John would shudder slightly, or make some little sound, and Sherlock would be reminded he was there and have to refocus once more.
“Yeah. I was getting ready for bed, but . . . It was clear Sherlock didn’t want to be alone with him, so I stayed until Whitcombe left.”
that’s not true. You can be as mad at me as you want, but don’t take it out on him. He took you to meet his mother, for Christ’s sake!”
John sensed the building anger and tension in his flatmate and placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“I’ll do it in the morning,” said Sherlock. “Think I’ll shower and . . .” He made a dismissive motion with his hand.
John turned his head toward Sherlock, who in turn had his head turned slightly away. John could still smell the soap and shampoo and aftershave, mixed now with the antiseptic smell of the hospital gown and sheets—but for a moment John was able to clearly picture all the care Sherlock would have put into his grooming routine that day. Oh, Sherlock could be fastidious even on an average day, but that day he would have checked and re-checked, adjusted and re-adjusted until someone (presumably Mycroft) dragged him away from the mirror. And while it would be easy to label Sherlock as vain—and in many ways he was, though not in looks, John had learned—no, in truth when it came to appearance Sherlock was simply insecure. He was the scrawny, gangly kid who’d grown too tall too quickly and was no good at sports. But he more than made up for it with his brilliant mind. (And that was where the vanity came in.)
Well, they had it now. He unsealed the envelope and removed the thick sheet of stationery inside. It was embossed with the same crest.
“You’re more than welcome to take a stab at it,” Sherlock told him. “But we’re not staying here in any case. So you can either send us home with the information we need, or I can research it on my own.”
Sarah sighed and stirred the lo mein in search of more chicken. “Why did you push him into a pool, anyway?”
The spacious bedroom—the one with an attached bath that featured a spa tub big enough for two—was also off the entry, to the right. Though he mostly wanted to break it down, Sherlock paused to listen at the door before opening it. Sounds . . . indistinct murmuring of some kind.
“Of course not.” Sherlock threw back the bedspread and lay down. “You can’t leave me here by myself.” He turned onto his uninjured side and closed his eyes.
“Seemed more regretful than anything,” said John. “Although he did promise to see Sherlock again soon.”
“Irene is a hopeless romantic. She reads too many novels and fashions drama out of thin air in order to make her own life more exciting.”
“I’ll be fine. Thanks,” John assured her uncertainly. Irene’s solicitousness unnerved him, though he wasn’t sure why; it was almost as if she were trying to make up for Sherlock’s complete lack of interest. He stepped away, though it meant risking his ability to remain upright. It had taken every reserve of strength to get halfway through the living room.
The containers that followed all seemed to serve a similar function. Each harbored a strange collection of memorabilia, some of which John recognized, much of which he didn’t. A wineglass with lipstick stains, a bag of hair and nail clippings, a miniature painting, a solitary sock . . . It made no sense to John, but then he supposed it wasn’t meant to.
“There’s no one there now, maybe, but there was. I need to . . .” Sherlock glanced down at himself, then began looking around.
“And what am I supposed to do?” John muttered. He envied the way Sherlock’s ability to simply fall dead asleep, as if someone had flipped a switch inside him and turned him off. And based on experience it could be anywhere from twenty minutes to several hours before his flatmate snapped awake again.
But Sherlock was looking at Irene now, who was cringing, and John asked sharply, “Eoin? He wasn’t invited.”
“I’ll have my assistant bring over some of your things,” Mycroft announced abruptly, folding his newspaper and setting it aside. “You can stay here until we get all this sorted out.”
“I want to be sure I understand all this,” said Mr. Watson once Irene had turned the corner. Sherlock gave him the same blank stare he applied to Lestrade when the inspector said the same kind of thing before encapsulating the finer points of a case. “You were John’s flatmate. He used to mention you, quite often actually, which probably should have been our first clue.”
It made sense in a strange way. John wouldn’t normally return to the house this early; it would be the perfect time for a beau to stop in for some tea. And now he was leaving in a hurry and she was probably worried about repercussions.
“I’ll make tea,” John announced a bit too vehemently. He planted himself in the kitchenette and pretended to ignore the fact that his would-be girlfriend had her hands all over his flatmate—which, by the way, was more than Sarah had ever done for John. Not that he resented it, of course.
The phone was buried under the small avalanche of post that Sherlock had been sorting through earlier. He checked for messages, but they were all from Lestrade.
“I’ve been off them for almost a year and a half,” John told him. “Thanks to Irene. And Mycroft,” he added grudgingly.
John left it at that and continued on to the stable. He led Tiberius from his stall and had him saddled and ready to go before realizing he’d forgotten his gloves. He briefly considered going without them but worried the reins might give him blisters.
“John is just out of surgery,” Lestrade reported. “It was a near thing by all accounts, but he’s stable now. Not awake,” he added quickly. “They’re keeping him sedated to prevent him pulling his sutures.”
After a moment’s indecision, Sarah resolved to try and take the edge off things by making John a cup of tea in the staff room. But when she brought it to the office he was working in and set it on the desk, he pulled back as if she’d bit him. “John . . .”
Mrs. Hudson made tea and brought up biscuits with additional promises of a cake on the morrow. Lestrade did not bother to hide his disapproval that Sherlock had exited the hospital well before what he would have considered proper, though he begrudgingly acknowledged he understood the reasons for it. He did not mention Eoin, and no one asked. Lestrade lingered until it became clear the Register might very well fall asleep on the sofa, at which point the inspector took his leave so that he could return the old man to his rightful bed.
“You do know a lot about them,” said John. “But I really wanted to talk to you about—” He broke off as he realized his mother and Mrs. Grossman were still staring.
“Those ribs, I think they’re broken,” John persisted. When Sherlock failed to respond, he sighed and moved on. “Where did the gun come from then?”
John was a strong swimmer, though it was difficult to do in jeans and a jumper. His jacket and trainers he’d discarded somewhere between the house and the pond. He reached the overturned rowboat in under a minute, though to John it felt like ages. His biggest fear was that Sherlock might be under the vessel, so he was relieved to spot his flatmate floating facedown on the far side of it. John threw an arm under Sherlock’s chest and lifted him back, pulling his face from the water and revealing a gash on Sherlock’s right temple where the boat had hit him as it flipped.
He was standing in the middle of the flat, trying to decide whether to hide them or throw them away entirely when the door swung open.
John shrugged off the pilfered article of clothing and went to the closet in the corner of the room, where he slipped it under a stack of blankets and spare gowns. Then he made for the door.
about things.” He gestured at the ground near the pond, and John saw they were passing deep set boot prints that led to the water and back.
“I don’t—” Sherlock began as John wandered in and asked, “Who is it at this time of night? Lestrade?”
John had half convinced himself to go check when he heard the door open. Sherlock was home early then. Had he brought Irene with him? He listened but there was no telltale chatter, and he didn’t think Irene could be quiet for very long.
The door opened once more and a nurse stuck her head in. “Visiting hours are—Oh, I’m sorry, doctor,” she said. “I’ll let you finish up in here.” The door clicked shut.
“We’ll get new ones,” Sherlock promised after a minute, his attempt to soothe John’s irritation. What he failed to understand was that John was not so much angry about the loss of his phone, though it rankled a bit, as angry with himself for having put them in jeopardy. He didn’t have to be a brilliant consulting detective to know mobile phones could be tracked.
“With you, Sherlock, there’s no such thing as a shortcut.” He took a breath and asked his final question. “Did he hug you?”
Mycroft put a steadying hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and abstractly John realized that, because he was behind his brother, Mycroft could not see what had happened, what
John had no idea what this man was talking about; he wasn’t even sure he was hearing all the words being said. But the low intensity of his voice and his breath against John’s ear were nice. John closed his eyes again, prepared to sail back into sleep.
Irene’s shoulders fell under the weight of his accusation and she began to pick at her fingernails, an old, anxious habit. “I’m a thief,” she admitted. “But I’m not that kind of thief. Anyway, it’s not like he would have me; he wants you.”
John found himself staring at a dark-clad leg. Moriarty’s knee, he realized and coughed a weak laugh that sent more blood into his throat. The day Sherlock returned to him would be the day he died. And all at once he felt like he’d been waiting for this, expecting it. Sherlock had always had the luck of the devil, and anyone bold or stupid enough to risk his company took the chance of inheriting Sherlock’s deflected fate.
Irene’s eyes darted between Sherlock, who’d gone stock still, and the slightly hunched figure of his flatmate, who was walking determinedly but also carefully through the room. When Sherlock neither offered an introduction nor moved to help John, Irene stepped over and took John’s arm.
John closed his eyes and shook his head slightly. What had he hoped for, he wondered? It was no use trying to bring out any real feeling in his flatmate; Sherlock seldom functioned on such a level.
Suddenly aware of how cold he was, Sherlock went to fetch a shirt before reading the note. But he knew upon finally snatching it up from the table that it hadn’t been written by John after all; the handwriting was Charles’s.
“Okay, well,” said Mrs. Watson brightly. She gave John another hug. “We’ll be getting everything ready for you here tomorrow.”
This hadn’t occurred to John. “Oh,” he said and blinked a few times. “It’s just . . . You keep things . . .”
“I certainly hope so. Thank you, John,” she added sweetly as he returned and handed her the keys. “Just keep in down, boys, if you don’t mind. I’m a light sleeper.” And she pulled the door closed behind her.
Both Sherlock and Lestrade stared for a long moment before the inspector remarked, “You seem to know a lot about it.”
John hesitated. He felt like he was standing on a crumbling precipice, but maybe there was a chance to jump to more stable soil. “Wish you’d let me dress that cut.”
It was a low and dangerous tone that Irene had only heard Sherlock use a handful of times in all the years they’d known one another, and immediately she was aware she was in a precarious position. “I don’t . . .” she began, and Sherlock’s frown deepened. “It’s not for me to say,” she told him. “I mean, I thought you knew. Since you’d said Mycroft was keeping you informed of . . . things . . .”
“He handles the heavy work and Chloe does the rest. Mycroft makes sure I have the help I need. Good of him, considering how busy he is.”
JOHN WAS SURPRISED when, instead of keeping to the path that circled the pond, Sherlock struck off toward a more distant stand of trees that hugged one side of the base of an otherwise bare hill. After having become familiar with the property two years before, John almost never went this way; there was nothing for miles out. But maybe that was the point, he thought, given Sherlock’s long stride that was just short of a loping run. John struggled to keep pace, his nearly healed injuries still ready to remind him of his limitations.
“I’m not—” Sherlock’s phone rang. Mycroft. He declined the call, but realized something as he did so. “I do have a picture.”
Someone had said those words to him not so long ago, but who? John was too tired to think very hard about it, but the memory nagged at him, until he remembered it had been Sherlock who had said it, on that last night together, that perfect night that in retrospect John had come to realize Sherlock had so carefully constructed. Because Sherlock had believed he was going to die, just as John believed it now. He was slipping under the waterfall, and even if he’d wanted to hold on, there was nothing left to grab onto.
“I don’t know anything about Eoin,” Irene admitted; John had never mentioned such a person to her. “I only know he asked for you.” She looked up at Sherlock expectantly, but he only stared blankly. So she said, “He’s allowed to change his mind, isn’t he?”
The Christopher issue continued to eat away at him. Irene was a smart girl; she should have known better than to fall for anything Christopher might say or do, especially after their last encounter. But Irene’s soft heart was also her downfall. Her idealism had attached her to Sherlock in the first place, after all, and Sherlock was well aware he was nothing but trouble for anyone who knew him.
JOHN HID IN the shower for as long as he felt he could get away with it, and when he emerged found the bedroom empty. So he ventured out, all the while trying not to think about what Mycroft had been led to believe.
“No,” said Sherlock. He stepped farther back so the two men could get a good look at one another. “John, this is Mr. Charles Whitcombe.”
Sherlock allowed it, and in slow, painful steps was guided to the pavement. “Call Lestrade,” he told John. “Have him bring the Register.”
“When I know, I’ll tell you,” said Sherlock as he headed for the door. Once outside, he was forced to consider whether he wanted to carry the scrapbook home or hail a cab. It was a nice enough day for a walk (despite John’s reservations, Sherlock did notice these things), but the scrapbook was thick and unwieldy as the folded clippings pushed the pages apart. Not easy to tuck up under an arm. So in the end he opted for the cab.
When it was clear Lestrade was as close as he was going to get, Sherlock said, “He has flour in his hair.”
John was left standing in the living area, his mind void of excuses. Raising a fuss would only set an unpleasant tone for the day, and he didn’t feel like dealing with one of Sherlock’s moods on top of everything else. So after a brief moment of reflection, and a promise to himself that next time he would put his foot down, he went to comply.
“Yes,” was all Sherlock said. John would have liked more, would have especially liked a kiss goodbye, but he knew Sherlock would never do such a thing with so many people standing there. It was a wonder he was going through with the ceremony at all.
“Well, it’s good of you to help out and all, but it worries me a bit when you get involved in these things,” Sarah told him.
Because he’d wanted to go, hadn’t he? Of course he had. He’d wanted nothing more than to follow Sherlock out the door and go with him.
John watched Gerrie work out what he was talking about, all her lines of thought written plainly on her face. “You’re talking about the picture,” she finally concluded. “It was taken at Wells; that was an especially nice summer.”
Irene rolled her eyes and held a finger up to Tamzen to indicate “a minute.” Then she slid out of the booth to let Sherlock up.
“I guess a lot will depend on how long you’re staying . . .” she continued to muse, “unless we find someone you can pack up and take with you.”
When he was done, John came back to where Sherlock had settled himself in front of the computer, roughly a dozen windows open on the screen as the detective toggled between them. A flash of gold caught John’s attention as his flatmate typed, and zeroing in, John discovered Sherlock was wearing the ring.
“Come on, then,” Mycroft told him. “Let’s go home so you can get some proper rest. He’ll still be here tomorrow. And probably still asleep.”
There was a strangely uneven sound that grew louder as whatever made it came closer, and Sherlock willed himself to remain still when he felt the breath on his face.
Sherlock checked the date on the paper; it was from last August. A long engagement meant one of two things, or maybe both: (A) they were expecting to host a large wedding and needed time to plan, and/or (B) there was reluctance on at least one side, in which case the longer the wedding was put off the better.
Using the base of the statue, which was the heaviest part, Sherlock hit the wall twice more, at which point the bricks began to give. Sherlock set the statue down to pull at the loosened blocks with his hands.
“No one asked me. This one has to be yellow.” Sherlock started for the door between his mother’s and Mycroft’s.
“So you’ve come all this way to forget about it,” Irene went on, taking his bag and tossing it onto the sofa. “We should be able to do that without too much trouble. What are you in the market for? Fling or full on rebound? I’d suggest a one-nighter, but you’ve always had trouble with those.
Still, at Baker Street and feeling in no rush to get up to an empty flat, Sherlock took the stairs slowly. As he unlocked the door, he was thinking he might actually eat something when a voice said, “Any luck?”
John cleared his throat and Sherlock whirled around to face him. “Why are you here?” the detective asked without preamble.
been placed there, arranged like dolls, because it was somehow too terrible to contemplate their dying in such a way. Had they known? Suffered? Which one of them had died first, and had the other one had time to mourn or feel alone before following?
Not that they had time to visit jewelry stores. Never mind, he’d think of something, maybe while they were on this “holiday.”
Sherlock forced himself to rededicate his attention to the computer screen. The story displayed there was from over two years before, detailing the opening of some prestigious art gallery in a spectacular new building that had been designed by Benjamin Markham. There were photos from the fête, including one of Markham and the gallery owner. Each of them held flutes of champagne, and clearly visible on Markham’s left ring finger was a gold ring.
“But he hadn’t planned on my seeing him, either,” said John. “He would have slipped in and out without me ever knowing.”
Mycroft scowled down at the petite redhead now standing directly in front of him, but she only continued to beam like a self-satisfied child awaiting praise.
Sherlock returned with a half-meter or so stone statue of some saint, or maybe a late archbishop. He went to the wall, felt again to be sure, then hefted the icon and struck.
John looked up; Irene looked away. She sat perched on the vinyl chair and stared at the already wilting flowers behind her as if they were the most wondrous things she’d ever seen. But even with her head turned and much of her hair in the way, Sherlock could see she was blushing.
John quietly absorbed that, then said, “You should have called first. It’s a little early for dinner, after all. What if she’s out somewhere?”
“It would take too long! You don’t ride?” When John only shook his head, Elyse said, “Climb up behind me; I’ll manage Morningstar.”
John’s eyes traveled up the column to which the man referred, which seemed to buoy the wooden ceiling above.
Sherlock glanced up as the doctor came over to speak to Lestrade again. “Yes. Irene . . . John is . . .” But he couldn’t say it. If he said it, he might cry. He hated to cry.
Eoin gave a short nod, and Sherlock looked away quickly to keep from laughing at his show of bravado; the boy was trying all too hard to make the exchange something grown up, whatever his idea of “grown up” was. Probably something from daytime television, the sorts of shows Mrs. Hudson liked.
“You call,” Sherlock added, though it would have gone without saying. Sherlock hated talking on the phone, and he equally hated dealing with service people of any kind, for which he had no patience. So having him talk on the phone to a service person was one of the worst things a person could ask of him, and it was a fair bet that if Sherlock had been the one phone for their dinner, by the end of whatever conversation was likely to occur, the food that came might not be entirely safe to eat. Because Sherlock had a knack for pissing people off.
“I shouldn’t,” he told her now. “It’s a long way back, and I wouldn’t want to disrupt the household.”
Sherlock focused for a moment on the door. It was unlocked, which only confirmed what was now obvious—John had left. Sherlock felt a sudden prick of vulnerability, mixed with an aggrieved irritation that John had abandoned him.
Sherlock tried to understand this but realized he wasn’t fluent in the emotional language involved. He needed Irene, still and again; she would be able to decode the situation and feed it back to him in a way that made sense. For now, Sherlock stepped away from the bed and said, “I’ll bring Irene by later. She flew in, but she’s still getting over her jet lag.”
He unspooled the belt he’d wrapped around his hand and doubled it so that he was holding the ends. Before him, Christopher stiffened in anticipation.
From the bed, Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “I believe the custom is to bring gifts to the person who’s been injured.”
He was on his way back to the library when the doorbell rang, followed by furious hammering, though the blows weren’t loud so much as rapid. John hesitated, but there was no sign of either Chloe or the elusive Jeremy, so he went to answer the door himself, whereupon Elyse Baskerville all but fell into his arms.
“I’ve read your website,” Charles said. “You always were clever. I’ve read some of John’s blog, too.” He frowned up at John. “Sorry if I seem nonplussed, but I thought you had a girlfriend?”
John wasn’t sure if what she’d said was meant to be a promise or a threat, and he didn’t get the chance to ask. Gerrie was already stalking away when his cell phone rang. John’s first thought was that it was probably Sarah wanting to know where he was, but when he checked, the ID read Lestrade.
SHERLOCK AWOKE IN an unfamiliar place, which in and of itself was irregular enough, but the discovery that his movement was restricted caused him especial alarm. He immediately began to take stock of his situation:
Sherlock was unable to stop himself from flinching when Moriarty moved as if to touch his face, and Moriarty clucked with disappointment. “Reserved,” he sighed, “and for someone who doesn’t even want it, more’s the pity.
Worse than that, the moment Mycroft laid eyes on John, the older Holmes would see exactly what they were up to. And then they really would be in trouble.
“Asking Sherlock how he feels is like asking the refrigerator if it’s had a nice day,” John said as he dug biscuits out of the cabinet.
Sherlock’s mind was clearly racing. “We don’t have to break in so much as get ourselves locked in, I think. Might have to break out, though . . .”
“And leave me all alone in the middle of London with nothing to eat? You’re a better man than that,” Irene assured him as she pressed the elevator call button. “How’s Sarah, by the way? Not too upset about everything, I hope.”
“Ah, but also brilliant. And if one is going to be insane, then it’s just as well to be the genius kind.”
The boy didn’t disappoint; he had no apparent filter for his emotions. Flushing even more, he said only, “Oh!”
Then his senses began to flood him with information. John was not muttering, not moving. It was true that the flailing had begun to abate over the past day, but this calm was unprecedented.
Lestrade forced himself to focus. “The one with his back to us is Benjamin Markham,” he said, indicating the taller and darker victim. “We haven’t ID’d the other one yet.”
“YOU NEVER USED to flick your wrist like that when you removed your watch,” Sherlock said as he ran his free hand down Christopher’s left arm. “But the movement was so smooth, I can see you’ve had practice at it. And the only reason I can discern for it would be so that the watch lands with the dial propped up just . . . so.” He wrenched Christopher’s arm back, looped the belt around Christopher’s wrist.
“Nausea?” Charles asked sharply. He set the bowl on the table beside the bed and pulled out the notebook again. “You, John, are my insurance.”
John looked down at his side. The stinging was becoming more pronounced; it seemed almost to burn. “You stabbed me.”
Moriarty pushed himself away from the door, slipped his hands into his pockets and sauntered into the flat. “I got a letter like that recently. And then I realized I could kill two martlets with one stone.”
John drew back against his pillows. “What?” He turned a hard gaze on Irene. “What are you telling him?”
“Don’t ruin your lunch now,” Mrs. Grossman warned. It had taken her some time to get used to the notion that Sherlock (who she thought of as “the man who had upset Mr. John”) was the rightful master of the house, though Sherlock had made it easier by leaving things much in John’s hands.
Sherlock had navigated a week’s worth of Mrs. Watson’s physical affection with aplomb and had seemed to gain Mr. Watson’s quiet approval, but the arrival that morning of both Harry and Mycroft had nearly broken him. Harry’s first order of business had been to walk through the house plugging in every electronic gadget she owned—of which there were several—while simultaneously listing all the changes she would make to the décor were it hers. And Mycroft in turn had said next to nothing, which was in itself reason to worry. So now Sherlock lay on the bed, shirt open, having started to dress for dinner before abruptly changing his mind.
“I’m going, too,” Harry announced. When everyone looked at her as if she’d gone off her rocker, she added defensively, “For Johnny. And I can’t stand sitting around here waiting.”
His flatmate had done as instructed for once; he was wrapped in his blankets and already asleep. John took a seat on the edge of the bed and leaned in for a closer look at the wound. A cut, he decided, and nothing too serious; it had bled quite a bit, as head wounds were wont to do, but Sherlock had clearly used the towel to blot it, and the bleeding had stopped. Still, there was a chance of concussion. Someone would need to watch Sherlock for the next few days to be sure there were no lasting problems, and John had a feeling the job would likely fall to him.
John looked down at his shirt, but it was as if he couldn’t see straight or clearly. Taking pity on him, Irene reached out and began to fix his buttons. “I wish you’d been my sister,” he said, really just thinking aloud, but a corner of Irene’s mouth quivered slightly, though the smile remained fixed.
Irene returned from what counted as a kitchen with two glasses of red wine, one of which she handed to her guest before taking the seat opposite him at the table. “Start at the beginning. What’s his name?”
“That’s what Benson is for,” John told him, referring to his solicitor, who had been Sherlock’s as well. “But I’ll have him talk to you before agreeing to anything.”
“I feel like you’re very close,” John found himself saying a few minutes later as his flatmate stood in front of him, carefully running the razor over John’s cheeks.
John was still shaking, though not as violently. His head was filled with a steady thrumming sound and his eyes felt sticky. He was sure he’d be sick to his stomach if only there were anything in his stomach besides the water.
He kicked off his shoes and lay down. Wondered whether Sherlock and Irene would make a night of it. Wished suddenly and piercingly for some of what Charles Whitcombe had used on him, if only so he could relax and not think about what he’d seen on his phone.
Gerrie thrust a reproachful finger under John’s nose. “You’re the one who put him in this mood, John. You need to be the one to talk him around. Elyse and I shouldn’t suffer for whatever quarrel the two of you have had.”
“Which means he knows all the best places on a body,” Sherlock paused, adding at length, “for a bullet.”
“Sherlock and Elyse’s brother are of an age,” Gerrie informed John. “So, you see, they’ve grown up together.”
John waited until they were seated beneath one of the oversized umbrellas and had their meals in front of them before setting the box next to Sherlock’s plate. “Here.”
For a moment Sarah was confused because she hadn’t moved. But then she saw John’s attention had been redirected.
Mycroft finished whatever he was doing and stood as well, giving John a look that made him feel as if he’d just been read as clearly as a map. But the only thing Mycroft said was, “I should go up and see him.”
Lestrade shook himself out of his morbid turn of mind. He had been doing this job long enough not to be overly sentimental about these things, but he was still human enough that it bothered him more than he liked to admit.
John dropped his trainers by the door and wiped his bare feet rather ineffectively on the mat before taking a seat at the table. “Sherlock solved it,” he told Mycroft. “Sorry if you’ve wasted a trip.”
“He was outraged,” said Sherlock, “on all fronts. He was determined that Elyse would marry me, and if not me—though he fully expected to bully me on that score—she would marry another eligible bachelor with a good family name.”
“I thought it might be . . . diverting . . .” Sherlock answered uncertainly, and John immediately felt sorry for snapping at him. He’d forgotten that Sherlock didn’t deal in emotion the same way most people did; when overwhelmed, Sherlock went back to what he considered solid ground, which for him was logic and reasoning. The fact that he was attempting to draw John in with him only proved his underlying sentiment, in a backward sort of way. So John indulged him by explaining how he’d settled on the band of brushed and antiqued gold trimmed in tiny strips of platinum.
John swallowed his retort, folded his arms and leaned against the nearest wall. Why had he bothered to come? Sherlock had it sorted, didn’t need his help. And yet here he was, extraneous and underfoot.
John and Mr. Watson watched him go. Then Mr. Watson asked, “So, John, do you want to tell me what’s bothering you?”
“I believe he mentioned you once. You were one of his instructors, weren’t you?” John asked with mock innocence, and he could tell by the way Charles searched his face that the man was trying to determine whether John was playing him.
Lestrade glanced uneasily between the two men before taking up his inquiry once more. “The file shows you were there the night they arrested Whitcombe.”
Sherlock brushed past him and went to the door. “A lot less of it might have happened if you’d been more timely.” The door swung shut behind him.
“You’ve moved on. I see that. I couldn’t have expected different, could I?” Charles continued. “But really, there was a stretch of time when you were impossible to locate. Next thing I learned of you, you were living with Mycroft, so I certainly couldn’t tread there. Now, though . . .”
“His real name is Sutej, but he opted to adopt something more mainstream after some legal problems.”
The wide-eyed innocence put a crack in John’s heart, and he almost dropped the subject. But his parents were coming, and his sister, and it would be better to have this done with first. His parents had met Eoin completely by accident when they’d come to visit for a weekend and Eoin had dropped by unexpectedly. They hadn’t suspected anything—Eoin hadn’t been that dense, thank God, though if he’d been waiting to be introduced as John’s “boyfriend,” he’d been disappointed—but Harry would figure it out in a matter of seconds.
Sherlock held the paper up so that the early morning light from the windows could catch it. Nothing irregular about the watermark.
Sherlock smiled, small but genuine. He smiled because this woman was kind, and he liked the thought of her taking care of John. John deserved that much.
“You have to start from the beginning,” Sherlock told him. “Chloe was the only other person with access to your gun.”
THOUGH IT TOOK no little time—or maybe exactly because it took so much time—Sherlock chose to walk to Kensington. There were few things he disliked more than having to spend any amount of time in Mycroft’s company, but e-mail would have been insufficient, and Sherlock preferred to be able to see his brother’s facial expressions (what there were of them) when speaking to him. Never mind Sherlock’s aversion to the phone.
John briefly considered calling his sister and asking to borrow her car, but he knew it would only lead to some overblown conversation that he didn’t have time for. Well, and he also didn’t like to ask Harry for anything. She was the type to remind you when she’d done something nice for you, as if you owed her. So in the end, despite the expense, he hired a car and used the GPS software on the phone Harry had given him to plan the route.
They were on the verge of exiting the Great Hall when Sherlock’s mobile phone chimed. Thinking it was probably Mycroft, he stopped to check the text message. But it was Lestrade.
Despite his mental detour, John arrived at the stables, and finding Tim in the paddock, he paused to chat. Another way to divert his mind for a while. Magdalena would foal soon, Sovereign was recovering from something John had never heard of, and Mr. Stoke had asked if Augustus was ready to stud his mare.
Sherlock supposed a shower and some decent sleep would be more use than sitting in the hospital room, and there was always the chance he’d be kicked out eventually anyway. But he asked, “You still have people watching him?”
“A lot, I would think. John had a new boyfriend, he almost died, you’re back in London for the first time in two years and everything is different but not really . . .”
And then the meal was over, and John found himself feeling a bit like a man who’d just sat through a movie and couldn’t recall a single thing that had happened in it. He was sure he hadn’t exchanged more than two words with Sherlock, if that many, and he wondered if Sherlock was upset about it. Suspicious, more like. John risked a glance, but Sherlock was staring at the sideboard, lost in his own thoughts.
Charles’s smile widened. “What use could you have for that? But as for the medicine—what would you be willing to give for it?”
“After discovering our ‘secret’ this morning, Chloe went directly to Corring Hall and told Henry. They quarreled—”
“More like I found her that way. Crying. In the office. She was upset because the hydrangeas were too pink or purple or something. That’s where she is now, you know. Out looking for blue hydrangeas to make you happy.”
“I’m going to have Mycroft send Sherlock out, and then it’ll be your turn.” Irene spoke slowly, as if to be sure John understood.
Sherlock reached up and pulled John into a hungry sort of kiss which John seemed slowly to warm to. Releasing him, Sherlock said, “If you want me to stop, John, you need to tell me now.”
He pushed away from the door and turned as if to leave, but Irene said, “Wait. Don’t you want to know the rest?”
A small, dark brown box sailed across the room, and Sherlock was forced to drop the scrapbook on a side table in order to catch. But even before he had his hands on it, Sherlock knew what it was. Opening the box was only a formality.
This sent a bolt of awareness through John, and his eyelids rose. “I’m in the hospital, Irene. The only medication I’m on is whatever they’re giving me.”
“Is Sa—oh,” said John, stopping short when he found them in such close conversation. Misinterpreting the spots of color that bloomed on his flatmate’s cheeks, John went on tensely, “You have a bedroom for that, you know.”
It was like when they’d been younger, and John had wanted to read or do his homework or listen to music or even just go to bed, and Harry would barge in and start talking and never shut up. “Please stop,” John used to say, and he was thinking it now, but as always Harry just rolled on under her own momentum, flattening anything in her path.
Sherlock had turned his attention back to the envelope. Not only was there no return name or address, there was no mark. It had never been mailed; had to have been hand delivered.
Charles nodded. “Yes, and then there were non-molestation orders, you know, your brother being quite thorough. I knew he’d be watching you and that if I came within any kind of radius he’d find a way to clap irons on me again.”
John gazed at the abandoned tea for what felt like a long time after Sarah left. He listened for any sounds coming from Sherlock’s room, but the flat remained quiet.
“If you do it right, we’ll be back in London before Mycroft knows anything, and he’ll be too busy to do anything about it,” Sherlock informed her. “You know he hates it when I end up in the papers. He’s already got his hands full keeping news of the shooting under wraps, and he certainly isn’t going to let my escape from the hospital mar the family name.”
Lestrade realized he’d remained in the doorway the entire time and wondered at his reluctance to enter the room. He didn’t usually show such resistance, though he was also accustomed to hanging back when his team was sweeping the scene. That was the most likely reason for his staying put, he supposed.
John tried unsuccessfully to hide his hurt feelings by rallying himself as he sat up, saying, “Well, I’m supposed to cover at the clinic anyway.”
“I know.” John moved to sit on the edge of the bed, though this time he resisted the urge to lie down. Might look strange if a nurse should happen to check in. In fact, when the door opened, John was prepared to jump free of the bed but relaxed when he recognized the red hair.
“Good night, boys,” Gerrie answered faintly, and John’s last glimpse was of her standing there, her forehead slightly puckered as if she didn’t understand what had just happened.
his; it was the side he always slept on, and he felt lucky that Sherlock’s injuries and IV lines were on the opposite side), taking care not to jostle anything. He lay on his back there, staring at the ceiling, but it felt unnatural and he couldn’t hope to fall asleep like that. He shouldn’t fall asleep, he knew, else the risk of being caught would be exponentially higher.
Spotting his jacket, John steered them in that direction so he could grab it and throw it over Sherlock’s shoulders. His shoes, he supposed, would have to wait.
He found Sherlock and Lestrade seated almost unnaturally close on the sofa. “What’s going on?” he asked, and Sherlock froze mid-sentence in whatever he’d been telling the inspector.
“Charles Whitcombe,” said Sherlock, staring at the now unfolded document. “I’ve never seen this. Mycroft must have . . . must have intercepted . . .”
Lestrade sighed and shut the door then slid into the driver’s seat. When he remained quiet as he drove, Sherlock finally admitted, “I was expecting a lecture.”
“I know. And I’ve just sent him off, and now I need you to go find him for me.” John risked a glance at Eoin, whose frown had deepened as he watched and listened intently.
“It’s fine. He’s out looking at the—” He glanced uneasily at Elyse. “The scene. But I need to get back to London, so . . .”
“I find you very useful,” Sherlock assured him. “And you’re only a distraction when I want you to be.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. He’d removed to the guest chair when the kissing had come dangerously close to going too far. Not that he wouldn’t have risked it, but John had made it absolutely clear how he felt about the possibility of getting caught out by a nurse, never mind potential damage to his wounds. At some point, Sherlock realized now, he must have drifted off. And Mycroft had been right; he was sorry for it. His neck was stiff from the awkward angle at which it had fallen.
Watching John resignedly pull himself from the bed without further argument, Sherlock reflected on his beloved’s determination to endure despite his obvious exhaustion; John, Sherlock knew, would follow him doggedly for as long as he allowed, though it didn’t seem fair to drag John on.
“No . . .” Sherlock answered absently. He maneuvered his way through the masses and began to walk around the building. Every entrance had at least one guard and a few people milling near it, including the Tunnel Entrance, which Sherlock felt would put him closest to where he wanted to be once he got inside. So he put on his most confident expression and approached.
“What difference should it make to me what color the fucking flowers are?” They’d come to the base of the hill, and Sherlock showed every sign of intending to hike up.
John caught Sherlock’s arm, pulled him close and kissed him. He needed to find that core, dip in and feel it wash over him.
“No, I fell out of a boat. Or, to be perfectly truthful, an angry young woman tipped me out of a boat.”
John sighed and threw the garment bag on the bed before going back for his weekender, which was still sitting in the hall. As he grabbed it, Gerrie stuck her head out of the other guest room and said, “Don’t be afraid to tell him no if you like the yellow room better.”
The dining room, as it turned out, was excellent, and better yet, the hotel had opened the terrace for the season. They enjoyed the food, wine and sunset, and if it was a little chilly out, neither of them mentioned it. That was what dinner jackets were for, after all.
Drawing in another deep breath of fresh air, John mounted the steps and went to the door. It opened before he could even get up the nerve to ring the bell, and before him stood a thin, fine-boned woman with short, silver-white hair and eyes so pale a blue they almost seemed clear. She stood erect and her severe expression as she pulled open the door made John’s mind go blank, same as it always had when he’d been in trouble at school and had no good explanation to offer his teacher.
What he said was, “No, I didn’t bring anything. Just came to check on Sherlock, but he seems . . . fine . . .”
“No accelerants that we can find,” Lestrade went on after a pause. “But it started in the middle of the floor, so doesn’t seem likely to be the wiring, either.”
Sherlock stopped in the middle of pulling the pad off Brandywine’s back. “The sooner I see the scene the better.”
Sherlock made it a point to stop frequently, despite his itch to rush through and get what he really needed. Normally he would enjoy a museum for its quiet beauty. Museums were good places to go think without too much interruption, and Sherlock enjoyed having beautiful things to look at besides, though he couldn’t be bothered to dedicate any brain space to the history of the objects he was viewing. He only knew ‘calyx’ because he’d looked it up.
He would have to, though, eventually. Otherwise he might never get anything done. But that wasn’t John’s fault, and it wasn’t John’s burden, and so as Sherlock broke off the kiss, he said, “I’m married to my work, remember.”
“You can guess who managed the calendar in that relationship,” Irene muttered to John as she towed him toward the door. “But then, if it had been up to Sherlock, they’d never have gone anywhere unless a body was involved. A dead one, I mean.”
As he finished buttoning up his own shirt, Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at John, who could only shrug. They were in Sherlock’s room, after all; he had no options.
John glanced at his hand then looked away, blushing but uncertain why the compliment embarrassed him. “Well, I do have work,” he said stubbornly. “So unless there’s something else I can do for you, Inspector . . .”
Sherlock closed his eyes briefly and composed himself. “When you’re done,” he said again, and John could hear the strain as Sherlock worked to keep his temper leashed, “send John to the morning room so we can talk. Please.”
“You don’t just like him, you love him,” Irene proclaimed. When Sherlock only gave her a blank stare, she leaned in and whispered conspiratorially, “You don’t rob museums for anything less than true love.”
“Hardly.” Sherlock stood at the windows that faced the Ritz. He pointed. “You can see directly into the bedroom of the suite we were in. Don’t—” He put a staying hand as Lestrade began to lean forward for a look, “touch the window sill.”
Tamzen regarded him with frank curiosity, Jonah kept his eyes focused somewhere toward the center of the tabletop, and Demetria said, “Mm-hm,” and patted the seat beside her. “We’ve heard all about you. Come sit over here by me.”
“Thanks,” said John. A minute later the car was issuing a series of directions that John strove to follow as he got used to the way the car handled. Fifteen minutes after that, the car told him, “You have reached your destination.”
JOHN MADE HIS way back down the hall toward the entry, wondering which was the morning room. He passed the formal dining room, which looked able to fit two dozen comfortably; some kind of library; a smaller room that might have been an office given the desk that took up most of the space; and finally he was back to the front of the house, with the one reception room he’d already seen on one side of the staircase and . . . Sherlock turning circles in the room opposite.
“Which is why you haven’t been able to talk to him about whatever has come between you,” John deduced.
Irene snorted with laughter. “Only you, Sherl! Not everything can be relevant; some things are just life.”
Taking a deep breath, John picked up his tea and took a seat on the sofa. He picked up the paper—no idea what day, but it hardly signified—and flipped sightlessly through it for a few minutes before asking, “Learn anything interesting?”
John inhaled deeply. It had been a long day, and a strange one. A day that had started with his having a bad dream, and finding Mycroft Holmes waiting for him, and then there had been the long drive and the bizarre tea and the walk and the letter, and all at once John was somewhere between exhausted and highly irritated.
“He came running home the minute he heard you were with someone,” Patrick went on. “That must count for something.”
“I wasn’t planning to,” Sherlock answered shortly. “I was only going to help you as far as the bathroom. Unless you’d rather go back to bed after all.”
John had been hoping to ease into the discussion and work his way ’round to the topic at hand, but he supposed he should have known better than to try anything but direct discourse with Sherlock. So pulling together his lines of thought, he said, “I was thinking maybe you could be a bit kinder to Irene.”
“Don’t make an enemy of them, Sherlock,” Mycroft advised gravely. “You can’t afford more than the one you already have.”
There was a point at which John screamed at his sister. There were several conversations with someone named Fiver. John muttered to and about any number of people Sherlock had not heard him mention before. But John never acknowledged Sherlock, never said his name.
John looked again at the girl holding his arm. She was tiny, didn’t even come to his shoulder. Hardly the image of a high-profile criminal.
And yet, given a choice between waiting a lifetime to hear Sherlock say those words, or listening to Eoin say them twenty times a day . . .
“Of course he does. Because part of him believes if he locks you down now he won’t lose you again later.”
“I can never tell with him,” John admitted, then turned a hard gaze on his companion. “Why? Was your giving me the ring a lark to rile your brother?”
Sherlock nodded very slightly then turned for the door; evidently whatever balm he’d been seeking had soothed him to his satisfaction. John trailed after him, waited as Sherlock latched the door.
Jeremy stopped a meter away from where John stood over Henry’s body. The old man’s eyes went from John to the gun in his hand to Henry’s still form. Then he looked to Elyse. “You all right, Miss?”
John took it out to where Sherlock had several Internet windows open and running. “What do you suppose this is?”
“Bend over any farther and you’ll be charged with public indecency,” Sherlock warned her as he got out. He paused. “Do they have that here?”
“Lestrade?” John guessed. “A librarian? Someone who has spent his entire life studying the peerage as a hobby?”
The door to the room opened and That Man (as John had started to think of him) entered. That Man had a tray bearing a glass of water and bowl of soup. Always soup. Not that John was ever hungry.
John sighed. “Yeah, but unless Sherlock is texting from the shower, it’s not anybody I want to hear from.” Lestrade gave him a strange look, and John quickly amended, “No one important, I mean.” He thought about that for a moment and realized it still didn’t sound quite right.
Sherlock slipped his phone into his pocket and took John’s from the bed to set it on the bedside table. Then he pulled back the blankets and bedspread. “Come on, up you go.”
Sherlock made directly for the kitchen, which featured a nook with a glass table and wrought-iron chairs. A plump, brown-haired woman in a grey uniform gave a yelp when she saw him. “Just me, Daisy,” Sherlock told her as he took a seat, gesturing for John to do the same.
“After all the panic, you’d think they’d be here keeping vigil or something,” said Harry, adding as a new notion occurred to her, “Oooh, do you have scars?”
“Your friend asleep in a bathtub? A nice one. And they gave him bubbles, so it can’t be all bad.” She was trying to be lighthearted about it, though she knew her efforts were weak at best.
“Oh, they have an answer,” said Lestrade, “though they’re running the tests again to be sure it’s correct.”
John nodded as if he understood, though he wasn’t sure he did, exactly. He felt more like he was being warned of something. “I should probably . . . Need to drive back and all . . .”
“And he could have come to me. He could even have defended me, stopped his brother from pressing charges. But he didn’t. Because—and you must know it as well as I do—Sherlock Holmes doesn’t put himself out for anyone.”
John stared at the page in his hand long past the point in which he was still able to read it, his vision having blurred and his brain gone numb. At some juncture he realized he was holding his breath and began taking in air again. And some minutes after that he finally put the letter back into its envelope and returned it to his pocket. Then he stood, shakily, and climbed toward the Falls until he found the markings in the soft, wet soil that proved someone had recently been there before him. More than one person, in fact, given the two separate sole imprints and the distinctly different sizes of the shoes.
very close,” Sherlock murmured. “I have to be in order to . . .” His voice trailed as he made another pass with the blade. “I’m sorry, John. About Charles.”
“So you could have a day named for you?” John guessed. “So people would light candles and pray to you for guidance?”
“Irene,” Sherlock said firmly, “focus.” She turned her oversized green eyes up at him expectantly. “I need your help.”
Sherlock considered. He wanted to work on the case more than he wanted tea. And John could always make the tea after his shower. Finding this resolution sound, Sherlock turned his attention back to the computer. He was scrolling through old news stories when John returned, the smell of his soap and shampoo causing a momentary disruption in Sherlock’s ability to focus.
Sighing, Sherlock thumbed idly through the scrapbook, his eyes flicking over headlines and images. But as he came toward the back of the book, Sherlock slowed. A series of short mentions, followed by longer articles, all covered the same subject.
John followed Sherlock into the room in question. The walls were papered in a butter-hued floral pattern; the rug was a cornsilk-and-brown Oriental; the huge four-poster bed was covered in amber-colored down. “Well there’s no question that it’s yellow,” John remarked.
“That . . . friend of yours. He upset you. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have let him stay and bother you.”
John himself had two options as he saw it: to either go sit in front of the telly and let Sherlock work, or to try and engage his flatmate in some kind of dialogue. This second choice had always proven to be hit or miss since it depended primarily on Sherlock’s mood. But there was nothing on the telly that John much wanted to see, and he had to admit to a certain curiosity about the case. Morbid curiosity, he supposed. Though if he were being honest with himself, he was secretly hoping Sherlock had learned something that would put him more at ease about the whole thing.
John did nothing to dispel this notion, merely closed his eyes again and kept them closed until he was sure Sherlock was gone and wouldn’t witness his tears.
“For most people, that would be a good thing,” John remarked. He surreptitiously eyed the cut on his flatmate’s forehead but said, “I’ll just get out of your way. Call Lestrade if you get a moment; sounds urgent, whatever he’s on about.” He headed for his room.
John turned and gathered the tea things, forgetting his earlier desire to save them from Sherlock’s battering and so putting them at jeopardy once again as he all but slammed them to the tray and the tray onto the kitchen counter. Sherlock’s untouched cup slopped a bit and John hissed an oath; he just wanted to go to bed now, but if he didn’t clean this it would sit out indefinitely until it finally became one of Sherlock’s experiments.
Sherlock grabbed the collar of Charles’s shirt and hauled him from the chair, turning him so that they were face to face. He pushed Charles back against the chest-of-drawers and put the gun’s barrel against the hollow of Charles’s throat, and the amusement in the older man’s face died. “Tell me what you did to him,” Sherlock said evenly, “and if I don’t like the answer, I’m going to shoot your throat out.”
Moriarty barked a laugh, but it sounded uneasy at its core. “Come now. He’s no murderer. He’s a doctor.”
Immediately John was sorry, then suspicious. In the five weeks since they’d first begun negotiating this new aspect of their relationship, John had come to the conclusion that—as with eating and sleeping—Sherlock showed affection in cycles that were directly related to whether he was absorbed in a case. In short, John was a pleasant way to pass the time when Sherlock had nothing better to do. At least, that was how John understood it.
Mycroft ignored the jibe and began rocking toe-to-heel in his highly polished shoes. “Well, Sherlock, you’ve caused me no end of trouble today. Put the gun down, Doctor.”
“They sat there, mostly. There was a moment when I thought they might attack, but . . .” John shook his head.
John saw now that his relationship with Eoin was formed of a combination of Eoin’s eager persistence and John’s having chosen the path of least resistance. He hadn’t wanted to hurt Eoin’s feelings, and still didn’t, but this wasn’t working, was never going to work.
Sherlock nodded curtly as if this met his approval. “I expect I’ll be back by midday, but don’t hold off eating by waiting for me.”
By the time he got to Irene, she was half done with her meal, and despite his protests, she insisted on his ordering something as well. There. Someone else trying to take care of him. Sherlock was rapidly becoming convinced he didn’t need another family.
“It makes all the difference,” said John. “If he really cared for you and felt you had abandoned him . . . You said he was poetic, after all.”
“Mycroft tried to warn us,” John put in, “with the letter. He must have known Whitcombe was around, even if he didn’t know what Whitcombe was planning.”
“There you are,” she said brusquely. “Brought you both some tea.” She pushed into the room and set the tray on the bedside table, tutting when she saw John. “Poor dear. I could tell he was sick.” She drew back suddenly. “Not catching, I hope?”
“I didn’t think it was necessary,” John said, stung at the notion he wasn’t wanted. “I only thought you might like some company. But go. Go on then, I’ll just . . .” He rubbed at his face, trying to get the blood moving. “Catch up with you later.”
“Suit yourself.” Jeremy started the cart rolling, then gave a whistle, and the pack of foxhounds went running after, yelping and baying in the wagon’s wake.
SHERLOCK EXITED THE bathroom shirtless and resigned to whatever ministrations John might feel necessary, if only to keep from being alone. It was strange, this desire not to think; it had been some while since Sherlock had last felt the need to break free of his own brain. He thought of his mind as a computer, always on and running, humming in the background when not in direct use. Powering it down was not an option, had not been since Mycroft’s and Mother’s intervention. So far, though, Sherlock had managed not to be tempted. John acted as added insurance; not only was he a doctor and likely to be stridently vocal should he find Sherlock mainlining, but he served as a valuable distraction. Too much time alone with not enough to do had always been a debilitating combination, but Sherlock had discovered that he did not crave as much time to himself with John as a flatmate. If nothing else, John was an interesting socio-emotional case study, and he also gratifyingly never ceased to be amazed by Sherlock’s work, even at those times when Sherlock himself found it unchallenging and dull.
Elyse clearly read something in John’s face because she let out a wail. “Oh no! No, no, he can’t be!”
Mrs. Grossman opened her mouth to assure the man yet again that it would be no trouble (she didn’t like the idea of him going away unwell; what if he fell ill on the road and there were an accident?), when the sound of the kitchen door being forced open then shut again resounded down the hallway, followed by the sound of riding boots on the stone flooring. “Mrs. Grossman?” John called. “Did we find a carpenter to fix that door? Oh, tea.”
John had been so distracted with other things, it took a minute for what was being suggested to sink in. “You think
“Don’t—” Sherlock began but couldn’t bring himself to voice what he didn’t want to happen, as speaking it aloud might make it so. So as he went for the phone, he merely added, “Just don’t.”
“You’ll do no such thing. You’re in more danger than he is. Istanbul,” Mycroft reminded. “I’m almost done cleaning house of Moriarty’s people, but you’ve just made my job that much more difficult. What in blazes came over you?”
“You like the smell of lilac. And you like daffodils because of the color and that Wordsworth poem. And you find tulips oddly enchanting, especially those pink and white ones. You see. You thought I wasn’t paying attention, but I . . .” Sherlock swallowed and blinked rapidly; for some reason his vision had gone fuzzy.
Sherlock unlocked the doors, and both he and John climbed into the car. “I trust you loaded our bags?”
John had moved on to the next button. “Just going to go change. You know I hate these shirts; I only wear them for the clinic.” It was a reasonable enough answer, and not a lie, not really.
Could it be that Lestrade had turned up needing something? This was unlikely since if he had, John would have informed the inspector that Sherlock was home and Lestrade would then have waited for him to come out of the shower.
The corner of John’s mouth quirked upward, and Sherlock relaxed, only then realizing he’d been tense. It felt good to be with John again, but still awkward, like going back to class after having been sent to the headmaster. One more infraction might lead to expulsion.
“Uh, yes. He does, yes,” said John, finally putting the puzzle together. “If you could just show me?”
SHERLOCK HAD LESTRADE fax all the information regarding the art thefts to the hotel, which of course served to set Lestrade on alert. “You’re
“Evening, Inspector,” said Sherlock. It was a clear dismissal, and Lestrade left without another word.
Now he took a step, two, stopped. He couldn’t bring himself to come any closer, was keenly aware of Sherlock’s appraising gaze.
John slid out of the booth. “Well I’m done anyway. Just be sure I get my phone back when you’re finished, would you?”
Sherlock was aware of Harry’s eyes on him, but he took care not to respond to her intent gaze, focusing instead on John, who moved his head on the pillow slightly but did not open his eyes.
“John . . .” Sherlock began, forestalling his flatmate’s immediate departure for his room, “Tonight, you know . . . What you did, it was . . . very accommodating.”
It was the least of his worries, he supposed, since he was slowly bleeding to death from the stab wound in his lower left side. And now John saw through his lashes that Moriarty was taking the knife out again. Opening it.
“I’d like to hear him laugh once in a while,” said Mycroft, and he departed, leaving his mother to whatever shallow thoughts might lap the shores of her mind.
“God, you’d think he’d won an award,” Harry groused. “He’s getting married, not going off to—” She came to an abrupt halt as all eyes swung toward her. “War,” she finished, adding defiantly, “Well, he’s not! This time.” She glanced uncertainly at their parents.
Sherlock had been headed toward his own room to change into day clothes, but he stopped with a frown. “Why?”
“No chance to distract him with a sham medical emergency this time,” Moriarty taunted, his smile growing colder.
“Wait!” Irene called after him, and against his better judgment, John stopped and turned. “Your phone?”
John took the hot cup of tea that had evidently been waiting for him and told Mycroft the whole story. By the end Sherlock’s brother was nodding gravely. “We’ll need to find Chloe. Elyse, too, if she’s not at the bottom of the pond.” He heaved a sigh and added, “And I have to get Mummy a new housekeeper.” By the sound of it, this final task was the one Mycroft considered most onerous.
But despite an effort to be prompt, John’s parents were already ensconced in the library with Irene as their hostess by the time Sherlock and John came back downstairs. Mrs. Watson hopped up from the couch the moment she spotted them, diving for a hug first from her son, then aiming for a startled Sherlock. “There you are!” she crooned.
Mycroft, meanwhile, appeared apoplectic. John watched the red-purple flush of anger rise from Mycroft’s collar to his ears and on up to his hairline and silently prayed his pronouncement hadn’t induced a stroke.
“I HOPE THE other guy looks worse,” Sarah said a little too brightly when they joined her at the clinic. John shot her a pleading look, coupled with a small shake of his head, and she bit her lip. Sherlock, meanwhile, ignored her completely and began walking around, fiddling with objects on the waiting area reception desk.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock actually laughed. “It wouldn’t work. Which is no reflection on you,” the detective added swiftly upon seeing John’s scowl, “or me, for that matter. Elyse has been told what to want for so long, she’s incapable of thinking for herself.”
John tried to picture Sherlock in the midst of a group of self-satisfied, sophisticated people and could immediately understand why Christopher would have wanted him to stay silent. Harder to visualize was anyone able to keep Sherlock from speaking if and when he fancied. “So why would you invite Christopher over when you knew Sherlock was meeting you for dinner then?”
“Knowing about his relationship with Eoin won’t inform yours. The only thing that matters is what happens between the two of you.” When Sherlock appeared unconvinced, she added, “If you need more data, you’ll have to mine it from shared experience.”
John felt as if ice water had been thrown over him. His eyes flew to meet Mycroft’s, but Sherlock’s brother was as indecipherable as ever. Then John turned his gaze on Patrick, who met the stare steadily, though like Mycroft his face gave nothing away.
“I need . . .” John said softly to himself. He didn’t have Sherlock’s number, but he could call Mycroft, or even Irene. Yes, Irene would be the one to talk to. Irene, who’d seen him through the funeral and checked on him regularly. She’d been the one John had called whenever the sense of loss threatened to overwhelm him. And she’d come to visit at Weald House every summer, had been planning to come again in July. Only Irene would understand the mixture of anger and relief John was feeling. So though his inability to move his right shoulder and the stiffness in his torso made it an effort, he dialed Irene’s number and awkwardly held the phone to his ear.
It took a minute before John could brave looking at Sherlock. When he finally did, Sherlock said conversationally, “At least we still had our clothes on.”
The first question was: where was the portfolio? Had whoever killed Markham and Lumley taken it? This seemed reasonable. But then again, Markham had to have known he was on the outs with the organization. Mycroft had said the Martlets had waited to kill him. Which would have given Markham ample time to hide his portfolio, if that was, indeed, the book in question.
“Detective Holmes.” He held up a hand to forestall additional questions. “Time is key here, Mr . . .?”
A second voice caused John to open his eyes again, if only a fraction. “Let him be, Charles,” this second person said, and John was sorry when the hand on his cheek slipped away, leaving his face suddenly cold. “We can’t damage the merchandise.”
Sherlock caught him, made an alarmed sound at the fresh gushes of blood that John’s movement had produced. “Help. We need to call . . .” But he couldn’t leave John to fall half out of the chair; he needed to finish untying him first. He did it quickly and eased John out of the chair and onto the floor.
MYCROFT, MR. WATSON and Harry were seated in a neat row, Mycroft and Harry each involved with their mobile phones while Mr. Watson watched people come and go through the emergency entrance. John approached him first, but even before he had the opportunity to say anything, Mr. Watson rose and asked, “What’s the matter, John?”
.” She pointed a long and highly polished fingernail in Sherlock’s direction as she charged him with this task. “That vein was perforated; it’ll need time to heal, else he risks ripping it right open.”
By the time he came to the place where he’d last seen Sherlock, John had concluded he should have stayed in bed that morning. He climbed the rest of the way to the Falls, pausing to scan the area, but he saw no sign of Sherlock. Or anyone else for that matter.
So as he threw the car into gear, John searched for something to say. He decided it would be best to simply be honest. Meat and potatoes, as it were. Hold the garnish. He took a deep breath and turned to Sherlock . . .
“It’s a fifty-fifty chance,” said Sherlock, “but given that I had gone to my room before Whitcombe took his leave during his first visit, he—rightly, as it turned out—assumed chances were good that John would be the one to answer his knock.”
John only made another noncommittal noise before asking, “Are we d—?” A question he didn’t get the chance to finish because Sherlock’s mouth on his prevented him from speaking.
Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly, the only indication that he’d heard. Then the skin around his eyes tightened and his brow furrowed as if he were trying to see something clearly, or perhaps simply to comprehend.
“The cars, John,” said Sherlock, his voice flat and monotonous. “You see them because, consciously or subconsciously, you are looking for them.”
“‘Little’ being the key.” Sherlock grasped his phone and started to pull his hand free, but Christopher caught it.
“He’s going to hate it,” said John as he peered into the bag at the large and very white stuffed animal.
, Irene Adler had said at the time. And if Sherlock’s memory served, she might unwittingly have been correct.
SHERLOCK ARRIVED AT the museum to find a small but dense crowd standing outside the main entrance while a security officer tried vainly to move them back. “What’s going on?” he asked a young lady who’d been chatting with a friend.
“Hm?” Though there could be no question of whom Mycroft spoke; Sherlock was the only thing they had in common. Still, John couldn’t help but feel that there was a right answer and a wrong one, and that the truth would somehow also fall on the side of “wrong.”
“The euphoria is cycling down,” said Charles. “He’ll sleep for a bit, then wake up in need of more.”
He reached over and tugged some of the bedspread away from the neck and shoulders and couldn’t stop himself from gasping. He was no forensics expert, but he recognized teeth marks when he saw them. Rope burn, too, and for good measure something small and sharp had been driven in just there, forming a minute but deep puncture wound . . .
Sherlock rounded as people continued to stream around them on the sidewalk. “Conjecture at best. Mycroft told Mum, and you can imagine how upset she was. It was an absolute mess.”
It didn’t help that there were no lights on the in the flat when he got there. The only illumination came from the rapidly deepening sky outside the windows. John thought Sherlock must be out, but a quick glance around showed that his flatmate was merely asleep on the sofa. Sherlock was curled up with his back to the room and was so utterly still that John suffered a moment of full-blown panic that the worst had happened—that Sherlock was dead.
