Dean paused for a moment, then raised his eyebrows at Castiel. “We’ve only just met, don’t you think we’re moving a little too fast?”
“Mm. Goodnight, Dean.” Castiel leaves a lazy, smacking kiss on Dean’s shoulder before his lips go slack with sleep.
The man blinked, a thumb coming up to wipe at the streaks of dirt on his face. Then, he broke into a half-grin, askew and mischievous. “Hey, I guess you’re right. Good observation.”
Dean inquired about the presentation Cas had today and Cas struck up a conversation about meiosis and mitosis and whatnot, and Dean easily let himself be lulled into a gentle haze by the cadence of his voice, low and melodic and soothing. All the while, his mind was ticking away as he kept his eyes steady and fixed on the intersection in front of them. Any moment now.
Apparently this wasn’t the answer Gabriel wanted because his frown only deepened. “They’ve been gone too long.”
They stumbled together into the island, knocking a bowl to the floor with a ringing clatter, their hands flying everywhere; over shirts, through hair,
So I offer to you these two chapters to at least let you know that I have not abandoned this story. Thank you for sticking around, thank you for keeping an eye on this story, thank you for reading, thank you, thank you, thank you, and I hope you enjoy! <3 <3 <3
Dean heard Cas’s grunt and turned just in time to see him jump back up. His heart raced, he took a step toward them—
“Kansas, lad, in the U.S.,” she answered with trepidation. “Think this place is called Lenon ‘r Lean-Along ‘r somethin’.”
Cas just kept trying, sitting with him at the table, or leaning up against the counter, or simply hovering nearby, and he would just. keep. talking. Whether purposefully or obliviously, he would just keep talking and
come on,” she groaned as she moved to stand. “It’s gettin’ late an’ we’re both right racked. Do me a favor, yeah? Let’s go in for bed.”
The infuriatingly small gas tank and the struggling demon in the bottom of the boat forced Dean back to reality far too soon. He swore to himself that he'd get Cas back out on a boat as soon as possible. Or maybe find a convertible. Or maybe a motorcycle? Or... skydiving? Wait— No! No way. No fucking way, why would he even think of that?
It repeated itself a hundred times in his head, losing its meaning and becoming just a sound, just a sound that meant—
It was so infrequent that Dean got to see Cas really smile that he was tempted to do a loop around the island just to stretch the moment. But they had a hunt to finish and Sam was here and—
Before, Sam would have probably just let that go. But not this time, not anymore, not after everything that had happened to them.
Dean blinked at him. “Right. Um—” He coughed. “No, I just meant like, did you want to go with them or not. We could do something else. Work on the plan.”
He turned to help Bris wrangle the archer, but she’d already pinned them and halted any further struggles with a knife at their throat.
-To the best of my research into Geailge, Sebhin should be pronounced SHEV-in. "Bh" is a compound consonant and before the vowel "i" would be shortened from a "w" sound to a "v".
“No argument here. I mean, they call their most famous sculptures ‘The Bean’ and ‘The Picasso’,” Sam said as he checked his map to make sure they were in the right place. “Oh, hey, there’s a preserve just north of us called ‘Campground Road Woods,’ you wanna go there instead?”
Bris leapt at her afanc with a frenzied scream, aiming to plunge her dagger into its neck, but the creature flailed and knocked her with its snout. She fell, "Fuck!" but quickly jumped back to her feet.
Sam was in the bunker’s gym, the weather outside proving a bit cold for what had become his and Bris’s usual morning run. Bris had already finished her own workout already and gone for a shower, leaving Sam to stay behind a little longer to work on his own extra exercises.
Bris took a near-empty fifth off one cousin and accepted an old shirt from another. She rushed to rinse and fill the bottle in the creek, and ran back to Inas.
His meandering anxieties were cut short when Dean finally entered the library again. He looked extremely pleased, and Cas’s hope soared.
His lit eyes flared and the lines on Dean's skin burst in a flash of light. Where those lines had been, now scars appeared anew like spider webs across Dean’s skin, Cas's grace having been burned from Dean's body.
Sam staggered into a tree, blinking rapidly. As fast as that happened it was gone, and he could barely even remember what it was.
We leave Dean’s room. Sam returns to the bunker from his run, and goes to the kitchen for his smoothie.
“It just stings.” Gabriel looked up at Sam. “Look... I can take a little pain to keep you all safe. I’ve been— I’ve been hiding from Michael for eons. This is nothing new.”
He threw his free arm up and jammed his thumb into the monster’s eye. Its blood rained down on him as it reared back with a screeching roar.
His fingers went white on the steering wheel as he tried to relax into the music again. The song he’d been given did its best to help with that, enthusiastically bouncing and jingling along:
Dean slipped a hand along his thigh, feeling the little pills in his pocket he had tucked away for later. He set his drink on the table.
Michael chuckled again, lower and more subdued. “Alright," he said. "You know what? Alright. I’ll offer you a deal.” He spread Dean’s hands wide. “You can have Dean back,
“Ah, well, yeah,” she blustered. “Point is, no. There were only one a’ him. At least I think there were.”
He fell back onto his bed, covering his face in his hands. For the first time since May, hot tears breached their dam, and slipped through his hair into the sheets.
“It's far more likely they were simply lazy," Cas said. "Demons hold no reverence for churches, and God almost certainly didn't lead you here."
“Some philosophers discuss the difference as nature versus nurture, experience versus innate being, memories versus heart. They try to distinguish the two to decide what makes a person who they really are, and their efforts are admirable, but they are one in the same. They're both necessary to form the whole.”
Home. Little villages on the coast, high cliffs and craggy rocks, the salty ocean crashing against the shore... Not like this fucking place. All roads and cars and shitty strip malls and too-quiet bars and tall, handsome men who want nothing more than to pull you into their arms and—
When he did finally reappear, though, Bris knew right away from the determined set of his eyes that he needed to talk to her as much as she did to him, maybe even more so.
of that registered with Dean, “Oo, drinks!” and he took off for the kitchen. At least, he hoped the kitchen was over here.
By now the camp was scrambling. People were running in all directions to raise the defenses, rushing every which way, slipping in the snow—
yeah.” Sam pulled out a chair and sat at the table across from them, spinning his laptop around to show them the news articles he had pulled up. “So get this: more than twenty people have died or disappeared under suspicious circumstances in Illinois in just the past month, all of them along one river system. In the town of Elgin there's four bodies, drained of blood, with their ears and noses missing; then just north of that, eight children have drowned at one county preserve; and then, just up the river from
Sam let the knife settle back on the counter and turned to Bris with a grin. “Would you be up for teaching me that?” he asked.
Dean hesitated, giving Bris a discerning look, but finally he nodded and returned to his seat. He eyed Direl as the man pulled a chair over to their table.
“The spellbook of our favorite, late, attempted mass-murderer. Obviously. Use your context-clues,” said Crowley. “I took this book off the witch, thus cutting her power in half and giving your bird here the opportunity she needed to take her down. Again:
Maybe… Maybe that was what Sam could do. All he wanted was to be better. To be safer. What was a few more spells under his belt, especially if he was already inclined toward it?
though,” she grimaced, tossing a hand at his chest. “Ye don’t need me and I’m not gonna fix anythin’.”
Dean didn’t even bother brushing his teeth. The surprise of Sam being involved in the making of a breakfast that was going to get cold pushed him right out of bed and down the hall.
The group moved past Dean to follow Crowley. Sam stopped, though, and put a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, you gonna be alright?”
I feel?” Rowena leered. She glided toward Sam, heels clicking on the cracked wooden floor. “Someone found themselves a nifty little curse, there?”
Bris entered the library, dropping a duffel bag into the pile that was already gathered at the end of the long tables. It landed with a thud, filled mostly with things like food and water filters, knives and extra ammo. Belatedly she realized it was the most she’d ever carried on a long trip. Usually she traveled by sea, usually alone.
His upper lip twitched. “Right,” he said, and turned back to his laptop, effectively ending the conversation.
In the middle of the room, a woman appeared, clutching a book in her arm. She leered at the three of them, her awful, malicious grin spreading wide.
She continued without him. “Well fuck now, if that's the case, Jaysus, those two be needin' to have a
From where he still knelt, straddling Cas's lap, Cas gently pulled Dean down for a kiss, sweet and lovely. His hand lingered on Dean’s cheek, a small smile playing at one side of his face, and his eyes positively sparkled. As he began to recite, his voice fell low and smooth, caressing Dean just as softly as his hands.
“Good,” she repeated. She stood, using the hand Cas was still clasping to bring him along with her, “Now come on, I want more of that whiskey before it’s gone, it was really good.”
"Hey, I know, man, I know," said Sam, resuming the movement of his hand, pulling Castiel back just a little bit more.
Bris looked again to Sam, but he had already turned to lead Castiel to the garage, leaving her standing in the hall.
Castiel’s arm relaxed, as though he were releasing his hold on something, and he withdrew his hand from Sam.
he would bring Dean’s doom all on his own. All she had to do was let Castiel do what Castiel always did, and soon enough Dean would be— soon enough Dean would be—
Typically, Bris was just assigned to the watch while the new camp was set up, so as per usual, she went to take up a position—
He tried again, thinking maybe he could get at least a twitch of a smile out of him. “You know, you keep givin' me all this help and I’m gonna get all dependent on you. Won’t be able to take off like you do.”
He turned it over in his hands, still so careful and slow, and soon ascertained that, indeed, it was real. He looked around the room, glancing up at the muted green walls.
After ordering, the talk at the table revolved around what Inas and Ballo were going to do once they got back to Ireland, first and most urgent being meeting up with family members that hadn’t been captured, and letting them know they were alright. Relatives needed to be informed of what had happened, where they'd been all this time, who had chosen to stay in the U.S. and also who… hadn’t made it. But they did their best not to dwell on that and tried to keep it light, quickly steering the conversation back to who they might find first, and who Bris and Direl wanted the two of them to be sure they said hello to for them. They were largely successful in their efforts, and Ballo’s warm, booming laugh filled the small restaurant even as Inas did their best to keep him at a civil volume with their hand on his knee.
“She kissed me,” he said, uncaring or unable to hide the desperation in his voice. “She came at me, and she kissed me, and I didn’t want it. She's nothing, Bris.”
He realized that since they’d gotten back to the bunker— really since they’d left Illinois together— the heavy shit like that wasn’t even fazing her. She just carried it like a champ and asked for more. More of his knowledge, more of his burdens. And it was all just so unbelievable.
had changed lately— But Dean caught all those questions, covering the small noise they made in his throat with a slight huff and a shift in his seat. He caught them, and he shoved them all right back down.
As the song picked up, Cas went quiet. Oddly quiet, even for him. Dean discreetly opened one eye to sneak a look at him and found him staring between Dean and the speaker. As the song picked up, the barest hints of a smile peeked through on Cas’s parted lips.
Sam pursed his lips and swallowed. Of course he knew that, but he'd pushed this anyway. How could he have been so—?
Kevin shook his head, tears cutting down his cheeks as he looked between them all. “You don’t understand… You don’t understand
“I mean, you know, in case,” Dean backpedaled. “In case something happens. Not exactly the safest line of work, Jody.”
“Yeah. He—” Sam cut himself off, getting a warning look from both Castiel and Bris. “Um. It’s complicated,” he finished lamely.
“Yeah, you, ye thick maggot, have you completely lost yer gourd? Can’t you tell a couple’a boys from some manky demons when they’re right in front a yer nose?”
Dean looked helplessly between Bris and Sam, then up at Castiel. He found him frozen, staring at Sam in wide-eyed horror.
He turned down a little dirt road that they had definitely been down before. The wide expanse of empty farm fields stretched around them for miles.
"I did," Cas stated. “My point was, you aren’t alone in experiencing this, Sam, this still affects me, too, and I’ve been a warrior for eons.”
He clenched his fists and considered the pros and cons of punching a tree. Cut knuckles and angry hippies beat out the release so he dug his nails into his palm and breathed as deeply as he could.
Bris watched as Sam rubbed his jaw and gave a quick grunt to test that his voice had returned. He stood from the bench, and shared another look with her.
She downed the last of her glass and waved the bartender over. He barely acknowledged her as he poured her another.
Direl cringed, averting his gaze from Crowley. Then his hands balled into fists at his sides. He raised his eyes once more, hard with determination. “Look now, F— Fergus. Look here now, I gotta—”
Sam raised an eyebrow over a contemplative frown, "Huh," and returned his attention to the spell's ingredi—
That same day, Sam and Bris were back in the library, and Bris was feeling pretty darned proud, if she said so herself.
"No." She squeezed her eyes shut. When she opened them again, they burned with defiant determination. "No. I can do it."
Dean noticed the difference, and asked him about it, but Cas's perpetually confounding nervousness caused him to avoid discussing it. And so Dean had left again, the only time Cas was grateful for it in the last twenty-four hours.
He moved on to Sam, still unconscious. He placed his hand over his forehead and found his injuries were far more severe than Bris's. It was obvious the witch had been targeting him. Cas did what he could, time would have to heal the rest.
Castiel blinked slowly, his posture drawing up as he came back to himself. He closed his eyes and frowned.
“She tried to summon her mate and ate basically everyone before they managed to bind her. We’ve been watching her ever since.”
“I don’t think so,” Sam said. “I suppose I could have forgotten something, but I tried to tell you everything I know.”
“Yeah.” Dean reached out, too. Slowly, with no surprises. He reached out, and took Cas’s outstretched hand in his. Cas tensed with the touch. Dean ran his thumb over Cas's knuckles, trying to soothe that tension away.
She continued her shower, her mind settled solidly down on that decision. As she scrubbed at her skin, though, she felt a pain inside her, and it took a glance down at the drain to realize it wasn’t anything to do with her turmoils, but instead something far simpler. She watched as a thin curl of red spiraled through the water at her feet.
Cas pulled back, and the same grudge he had against Dean’s shirts was now released on his accursed pants. He worked furiously to undo his belt, the button, the zipper— Dean gripped at the sheets, letting Cas take what he wanted, and Cas wrenched both Dean’s pants and boxers off, tossing them somewhere. He returned to kiss Dean— passionate, rough, sloppy— and took his cock in his fist. But his grip was too tight, and he pulled too hard—
Once dinner was out and everyone was squeezed around the table, conversation picked up as one would expect. They started with the usual:
“Well we’ve only just…” she trailed off, running her thumb over his hand. “An' seems you got a— a big thing goin’ on what sounds like, an'— Well, see, ye know I’d understands if ye...”
But she’d gotten the better of that nasty fucker, and she’d get the better of all them nasty fuckers out there. Weren’t no one gonna hurt Sam, not so long as she still drew breath.
“T’weren't no afanc attack, tha’s fer sure,” he said, and turned to Dean, gazing at him up through his lashes and causing Dean to flinch back. “Wha'd’you t’ink, boss?”
It had snowed sometime in the last few days. The roads had been plowed, but the winds of the Great Plains were already reclaiming them in its drifts. Dean checked if this car had four-wheel drive, but found it already engaged.
“Come on, you’re gonna look over-eager,” Dean coached, “You gotta play this cool if you want it to go well.”
But even with Ballo’s assistance, Dean eventually had to say through strained breath, “Cas… I gotta stop… I gotta get to shore...”
It was late, and the town was settling down for the night, but even so, their walk was decidedly too quiet.
“That's not how we operate,” Sam said, his grip tightening on his bottle. “The British hunters are dicks.”
The sound went straight to his groin, and he groaned into the crook of Cas’s neck. "Like that, huh?" he breathed, and he bit again, a little lower, a little harder.
He ripped open his jacket and his shirt, revealing a sigil carved into his chest. Everyone leapt back from him as Jack moved forward, arms spread in front of everyone.
“God, Cas…” Dean fell back a step as he ran a hand over his face. “No, god, Cas, no…” He ducked behind his hand, then lowered it to his mouth. “Sam and I don't— Where is this coming from? How long have you thought that?”
let him convince you to break him out of the Green Room, and then— coupled with everything happening with Sam— well next thing I knew, the whole Apocalypse wasn’t happening!
“Do you? Do you Know? Because it seems to me that if you Knew, you would know how your ‘miscommunication’ has
“What even is this?” the witch stepped forward, out of breath and clearly annoyed. She was holding a spellbook that she hadn't had before. “I mean, what are you doing here? What do you even
Cas turned back from his now-meticulously organized pile of lockets. “Perhaps they mistakenly thought they were of importance,” he said with a shrug.
There were the more subtle things as well. Where conversation with Dean used to be easy and forthcoming, it was now jilted and riddled with landmines. Where Dean had previously sought out his company or welcomed his presence, he was now distant and only seemed to come to him after drinking. Well, drinking more than usual.
Dean looks over and sees himself again, but this time he’s addressing himself. He’s pleading, with his hands out, and the other him is looking at him with… such fear and terror. And concern.
When Dean had leapt from the table that day… he’d stared at Cas with such fear in his eyes. He’d never explained that, and Cas had never asked him to, but now... Had that been when Dean realized…? The way Cas was realizing...?
Ballo stood from laying Bris down, bracing himself on his knees to catch his own breath. He looked between the river, Dean on the ground, and Cas standing tall before him.
The angel screamed, bright light pouring out of its face, and in only a second it was over. The angel fell silent and it dropped to the ground, its eyes and mouth and nose burnt out.
From his seat in one of the reading chairs in the library, Dean grimaced and picked up his phone on the table to skip the song.
Now over the last couple weeks, Dean had been avoiding ‘time to think’ as much as he possibly could. He knew exactly where it led, so he’d just… not been going there. But right now things felt different. Maybe it was that he was in his Baby, with his family (and Direl) around him and some real radio stations going, or maybe it was just the change of scenery, but right now, things were a little calmer upstairs. A little less turbulent. A little more steady.
The lone bar in town was a good ways off from the bunker, but if Dean was gonna drink as much as he wanted to right now then he was gonna walk. He absolutely would not leave Baby in that tiny, godforsaken, municipal parking lot overnight.
“Yeah, about that,” Dean said as he leaned against the wall at the back of the room, “we lied. You understand, right, demon?”
“Oh she knows, she knows exactly what I’m talking about, don’t you, girl?” Michael drew himself up, tilting Dean’s head condescendingly to one side. “You know
“He’s…” Dean continued, “He’s good, and I’m...” He looked down at his own chest. His voice fell softer, wavering, “All I’m gonna do is bring him down. All I’m gonna do is... is break him again.”
the smarter brother.” He jabbed his chin at Ketch. “Your little stowaway gave me all the information I needed! He knew this young lady’s history surprisingly well,” He glanced down at his body.
Speakin’ a’ that,” Bris jerked her head at the phone on the counter, “you know I ain’t from Galway, right?”
Cas coughed and tried to sit up. Dean hurried to put a hand on his back to help him. Through the tattered shreds of Cas's clothes, Dean saw that his shallowest wounds were already starting to close, but the deep ones were still bleeding profusely.
undid all of those plans,” she said to Sam. “Time and again, you and your brother shirked Heaven’s intricate machinations. And it was in watching that, in watching two men thwart the momentum of Ages, that I must admit I became quite interested in you. And since then I have been watching you, and indeed, helping you here and there, placing my finger on the scales of a close call or two.
Rowena sighed through her teeth in frustration and tossed her arms, “Fine! We'll go find precious Dean-o! Might have been long enough by now, who even knows down here!”
that had happened last night. No, of course not. He'd had to go and be a drunken ass at the door, too.
And now he and Bris were washing the dishes from the amazing meal they had made for themselves, Sam washing and Bris drying—
“No,” Jack pulled back from her, ”You don't understand, he’s my responsibility. I’m the one who opened this rift in the first place. It’s my fault he even wants to go to our world. It’s my fault that you and I are even here in the first place! And what Kevin said…” he looked around at the quiet tents, "I can’t ask everyone to put themselves in danger when all Michael wants is me. You all don’t have the power I do, he’ll just hurt you." Jack dropped his eyes to the ground. “He’ll kill you…”
Crowley’s mystery bar woman, who had given her name by now but he’d already forgotten it, seemed to be doing her damndest to keep up with his pace. She couldn’t, obviously, but Crowley was nothing if not an enabler of vices, so even after her card got cut off, he covered round after round for the both of them. Pretty soon they were swaying on their stools together, arms around each others shoulders, ignoring the looks of mild impatience from the other bar patrons as their laments competed with
Bris turned to Cas like she was just realizing he was there. Then her eyes dropped downward, and her face softened, falling somber.
but I can’t find hide or hair of him!” The knife at Sam’s throat nicked him again, a fresh line of blood rolling down. “Now, I can only figure that you sent him on some
Cas looked down between the blades in their hands, and up to the guards on the porch. “Have you ever thrown that?” he asked.
“Hang on now, just what are you gonna do?” She followed his glare to the demon house, and didn't need to look down to his chest to know what he was feeling. “No, wait now, Castiel. Don’t you go runnin’ off, what if you get hurt—”
Still pushed up against the dresser, standing so stiff against Dean, Cas took a deep, shaking breath.
The door opened anyway, and who turned out to be Sam said, “Dude, it’s like almost afternoon. We let you sleep in already.”
He didn’t even get a response to that as he moved off to gather his ingredients. Yeah, definitely a French Toast kind of morning.
“Fierce,” Bris said with a wide smile and a sharp nod. “Well, off you go then! Gotta figure out what’cher gonna say! Big moment after all.” Her own revelations could wait. This was far more important.
Usually people leave their radios on. The silence Dean now found himself in told him that he must have turned it off at some point, as his new awareness was greeted by nothing but the hum of the engine and the soft gusts outside.
One hand idly going to his stomach, Dean looked around the empty parking lot. He rolled his eyes, and gave Crowley a Look.
From their place on the sidelines, Bris and Dean watched the two of them. As Sam and Cas began loading the trunk again, Bris leaned over and said, “Really seems like you lot don't do this enough.”
just so she could go after King Henry II. Talk about a freaking power couple— Here, we’ll just listen to it, you’re gonna love her.”
“Left ye high and dry yesterday. Weren't good a' me. That just weren't where I thought that conversation were gonna go an'—”
Sam stepped forward and went to take her hand, intending to say something, to comfort her, to reassure her, but she jerked away from him again.
Sam wondered if Bris had had enough time with Cas that Dean passing through wouldn’t be a problem. He shrugged it off, though. Dean wouldn’t understand what they were saying anyway. “Yeah, of course, Dean.”
But that weirdness aside, he was fine, coasting steady— until the fourth day after he had come back. Fuckin’ Thursdays. He had always hated Thursdays.
Almost. Her tone immediately drew his gaze, and the pencil skittered to the other side of the table.
Cas released him. Direl collapsed back into his seat, unconsciously rubbing his throat and staring wide-eyed at the back of Cas’s head.
When Cas finished explaining his situation to Bris, he expected the same kind of reaction Gabriel had given him: Some confusion, a bit of concern perhaps, but certainly not the giddy smile that graced Bris’s face.
“And what are two lovely ladies such as yourselves doing all the way out here?” asked Crowley. “So far from this oh-so-important Settlement in the South.”
One by one, three huge forms climbed out of the lake. The dark, hairy creatures plodded from the water, clumsy on their stout, webbed limbs. Their flat tails dragged lazily behind them as their disturbingly long, toothy snouts sniffed at the air. Apparently satisfied, they approached the waiting pile of meat with only mild hesitation.
“I don't know, but we’re not going into a place that knows we’re coming while it’s dark. I’m going to bed.” He moved past them toward his duffel.
For all her chanting, though, not much seemed to be happening. Sam looked around the library, but saw nothing unusual. Usually with these spells the sigils would at least glow, or some hum should pick up, or at least a
They finally reached the dense brush of the degraded woodland surrounding the farm. After the muck, the solid ground was truly a blessing.
Sam couldn't help but mirror his smile. With a huffed little laugh, he gladly turned the radio back on and settled back into his seat.
“Oh aye, s'pose this here's a much better choice.” She looked Sam up and down. Her eyes paused for just a moment on his chest, and the smallest of frowns came and went in an instant. But before Sam could ask after it their drinks were delivered. They each took up their new whiskeys for a sip.
“—Dean’s stuck in that Apocalypse Dimension. We’re going in to get him back, him and Mom and Jack, and we could really use your help.”
“Not all that much, really,” Bris said with a sharp smile, “jus' think of it as a back-payment on your rent.”
“Sure did,” the demon said, completely oblivious. “Broke his fighting spirit! He’ll be moping ‘til the end of time!”
It was dark inside, and the place smelled like no one had really been down here in years. Maybe decades.
Cas, who didn't seem nearly drunk enough, went stiff next to him. “Um, the boy and the talking dog were about to—”
It turned out that Jakob’s scouts were right and the fortress was indeed deserted. They made it inside without incident and combed the place for anything useful.
“Oh, um,” Bris turned back from distantly looking out the window, “Cousin had a baby. S’pose that counts, yeah?”
“All sorts of things. Omens for angels, omens for demons, even a huge power outage like with Jack. But unless another nephilim is being born…”
You each try to take the blame for every errant happenstance onto yourselves in order to avoid dolloping it on anyone else—
She couldn’t help but sigh at the look on his face, lost and pained. She nodded her head toward the stool Castiel had just vacated.
Dean exhaled, low and grumbling. “Look, um... She’s gotta make up her mind eventually right? She's gotta stop jerkin' you around
Bris’s face broke open in joy and she nearly tackled him to the ground with the force of her kiss. Rowena just smiled at them as they tumbled off, and began cleaning up her spell.
“Where did he fail? What did he do? The Angels started the Apocalypse, and he stopped it; Hell and Worse came to tear the World apart, and he stopped them; all manner of Spirit and Monster threatened the people of Your World and
He and Cas scrambled up as it reared back for another strike. They got a quick look at a gray creature with a small head, a long neck, and a stocky body— looking more like a fucking
Dean grabbed Bris’s wrist and pulled her roughly to her feet. He took her around the middle and jumped in after Cas, Ballo right behind them with a flick of his coat.
It might have been the most fantastic thing he’d ever seen. “Fuckin' hell, you're a goddamned blessing, Cas,” he said as he reached for the bottle.
Dean edged him out, taking over the laptop to run the GPS search. “Go get a drink,” he said, waving a hand at Sam, “can’t have you crying like a bitch when you go get her back.”
Dean stared down at his phone, just barely containing the urge to throw it. He shoved it in his pocket and got back into the car, slamming the door behind him.
“I don’t know but we have to do something…” Dean’s hand balled into a fist. “Maybe we can find another angel, get some of their mojo for him.”
“You know, you can admit it to me, Sam.” She was still coming closer. Sam stepped further back. “You can tell me you missed me.”
Castiel shook himself, blinking the shock from his eyes. He drew himself up to his full height, and nodded toward the sandbox.
Sam glanced at Cas and Bris. He set his face, and pushed on. “Dean, most of what that witch said was crap. Absolute shit.”
“Be a dear and get them all out of here,” Crowley tossed a finger at the five of them, “before I change my mind.”
Inas stepped back and smoothed down their shirt, “Sorry, lad, I just— It just hit there that we're goin’ back. We're really goin’ home.”
Back at the camp, with everyone healed, the fire restarted, and the liquor flowing freely, everyone gathered together to discuss what would come next.
He rolled Sam onto his back and slipped an arm under his shoulders to lift him. “Gotta get him to his room," he grunted, "get him in a bed.”
He bit down on his tongue. It tried to move anyway. He bit it harder and clamped his jaw, soon tasting blood in his mouth. But just when he thought he was going to break from the pain—
Suddenly everyone was crowding for a look into Sam’s chest. Sam tried to placate them, but a heat was creeping up his neck nonetheless. As the selkies fawned over him, Sam and Bris found themselves smothered in enthusiastic hugs, and Cas found himself blissfully ignored for a time.
A soulmate is just someone you’ve bonded with so strongly that your personal little Heaven bubble would be crummy without ‘em.” He looked out of the corner of his eyes at Direl, “There’s nothing special about your kind of love. It grows just like anything else.”
“Yeah, you know, gotta be able to take care of your woman and all that.” Dean gestured vaguely with his hand. “If you couldn’t keep her happy, then you failed.”
left my gracious hospitality,” Michael murmured smoothly as he pulled a vial from his coat pocket, "but hey, no time like the present, right?"
“They do,” said Cas, leaning unnervingly close to the man’s head to inspect the wounds, “but this was not the work of a fish.”
“I should probably go too,” Bris said. Dean jumped at her voice, having apparently forgotten she was there.
“‘Course I was, Cas, I almost got myself drowned over nothing.” He took his coffee in hand and sat in one of the table's two chairs, fiddling with the stirrer in his cup, “I jumped into low-visibility conditions like a rookie, I made you use your mojo on a shit monster hunt, I stormed off when you were right, I’m an idiot, Cas.”
“I swear to god I will knock you out right now and leave you in this trunk if you don’t get your shit together,” Dean stared him down. “This isn’t a joke, this is a rescue mission, and I will not bring you in there just to have you die from sheer ass-hatted-ness.”
When he got there, Sam and Cas were leaning on the Impala waiting for him. He tossed the thing into the trunk, wordlessly got in the driver's seat, and started the engine. Sam and Cas climbed in after him, their doors shutting without comment.
Sam was pacing in the gym, the weight he meant to be practicing with sitting untouched across the floor.
“What- Hey, no!” He jerked away, nearly falling from his chair. He raised an arm, keeping her back, and he stared at her with eyes wide with—
Parked down another little road, beneath a highway bridge crossing the river, the Impala sat stoically, subtly quaking with lascivious motion.
“Well, let’s get going,” he said, trying to keep the surprise from his voice. When Sam and Cas went to get in the car, Dean pulled the thing out of his pocket.
“I do,” Fate admitted, her shoulders drooping with resignation. “It irritates Them to no end, but— Well, truth be told I challenge any of you to watch magma push the Earth’s crust for an eon without growing tired of it all.”
“Oh, she knew I was joking, and we all know she loves to meta, especially when she’s drinking, right? So you know, she’s gonna try to be better next time.”
Not needing an explanation, Castiel opened Baby’s passenger door and slid into the front seat. Sam reached through the open driver’s window and flipped the key in the ignition to power the stereo.
Dean’s chest warmed at the sight. “You should do that more,” he said, pointing too close to Cas’s face.
”Yeah— I—” Dean choked out. He became aware that his hands were fisted in Steve’s shirt. He used them to pull him closer, pressing them together hip to chest— and holy fuck
At first, Cas had done well at the small warehouse. Then he had been overpowered by layer upon layer of intense warding, and was incapacitated. He may as well have not even been there. Sam’s mind had been afflicted, and Dean was in terrible pain, and then that witch had
“You long ago developed astigmatism and optic nerve damage from your frequent head injuries. And, well, the condition of Dean’s heart shouldn’t really be a surprise.”
Sam absolutely did follow, and if he wasn’t busy preparing himself for a verbal lashing he would be planning how he could sit this selkie down with a notepad and ask them questions until they both went hoarse.
The next contraction must have been harsh, because Sebhin’s free hand shot out and snatched up Bris’s. Her heart skipped a beat, her chest seized, and her stomach flooded with guilt.
The demon leered down at his handiwork and dropped the flannels on the ground. “Goodbye, Castiel. Enjoy eternity knowing you did this to them. That you couldn’t even protect two measly humans from their ultimate fate.”
“I swear you take the fun out of everything, Samantha. No one? No one cares?” he spread his hands at the three of them.
With a clap and a little shake, Dean released Cas's shoulder. He headed back to his bag, twisting around en-route to ask, “Oh, hey. You still got your FBI badge?”
with Cas to work, right? He wanted things to go back to the way they were before he’d taken this shit-show of a trip down self-discovery creek. He wanted to go back to easy, back to nice. Back to normal. Because Cas was still his best friend, that hadn’t changed and it never would, no matter how much bullshit there was. So if he wanted normal, it only made sense that the best way to do that would be to
Yup, there was Fred, and Daphne, too, no doubt, but now… there was Fred. With his perfect hair, his can-do attitude...
out of my own operation, all the work I'd done, for one little slip up for siding with Asmodeus— fine! But I’ll fuck your day
Jack watched him carefully. His movements were sharp and his speech was so… unpredictable. Something in his gut told him to be cautious.
“Hey!” the demon called, looking desperately between their retreating backs and Sam’s rapidly deepening scowl, “Hey! You promised a fast death for information!”
Sam held his phone to his ear as he poured through the pile of books on the table— everything on angels, malachim, devas, tenshi— Sam intended to leave no stone unturned on this.
Sam’s eyes flew wide, “Nope!” he shouted, palms raised high, and spun on his heel to head back for the car.
Dean gave up and just flopped instead, splaying out over the floor. “I really want you to stay, Cas. I really, really, want you to stay.”
But they only got a few yards away before Dean became aware of an absence. He patted his pockets, “Shit, left my phone in the car, I’ll be right back.”
She set down the book she’d been holding, turning her full attention on him. “Ye need to talk to him.”
“Good. Good.” Dean picked up another handful of meat. “Just thought— with what that witch did, thought he might not take that mind-melding shit too well.”
“Yeah, and she was pretty freaked out, so come on.” Dean tugged a little, but Sam seemed dazed. “Hey.” He waved a hand in front of his face. “Hey! Come on! She’s still out there, what’s with you!?”
“What…?” Lucifer brought his hand up to inspect them. “Why are they… What did you do to them?” He picked up the ring with the large white stone.
Bris rolled her eyes at him, dropping her voice a little. *Your boy there, is he sweet on your brother?*
He reached the end of the parking lot and skidded to a halt on the rough surface, his chest heaving, his arm clutching his stomach against the burning, stabbing pain. He flipped back and forth, trying to see which way Cas could have gone—
a’ ours. He’s already got enough on his plate what with the pain I can see in him since Hell, so if yer not gonna be of help to him then ye better damn well
don’t need to worry about it. Now tell me what’s wrong here before we go charging into something you knew better about.”
“The witch…" he said. "She... She put a tracking spell on me. When I came yesterday, she followed us and—”
Sam spun to the voice, pushing Bris behind him. He drew his gun in the same motion, leveled it at the intruder, and fired.
on the faint giggle he heard behind him, he pulled the Enochian handcuffs from the bag, hefted it on his shoulder, and followed Cas and Dean.
Dean stared. He couldn’t stop staring, why was he staring? “We, um— yeah, we—” He managed to blink. “There’s a, ah… a thing. And... um...” He trailed off, not that that sentence ever had an ending.
Crowley appeared in the throne room immediately. Dean jerked back from him, sliding his hand up Cas’s arm to hold him tighter.
The speaker in Castiel’s pocket abruptly switched songs, from its current heavy beat to something else, something slower,  yet sharper at the same time. But Castiel didn’t notice, didn’t even hear it. He
be dealing with another Eve?” Sam asked cautiously. “All these monsters showing up at once, rare ones that don’t really belong here? I mean, North Carolina leeches and English grindylows? And now whatever the heck we have here, sailor-nappings and wife-snatchers.”
Bris glanced between him and the extended branch. Twice. Then, carefully, like Sam might pull it back any second, she reached out, and took it.
of files that he had been trying to avoid in the first place... it didn’t feel tedious. It was boring as fuck and he’d rather do almost anything else, but he was working with Cas to try to help Sam, and something just felt supremely right about it.
The group of demons paused, then turned around to look up the empty street behind them. There, in the middle of the road, they found a woman, just standing there with a large green and purple gun in one hand, and a blue hula-hoop in the other.
So they dropped off their bags, walked across the street. and got themselves a table. After they'd ordered their drinks, however, no one started conversation.
He seemed to cringe at that, his jaw clenching unexpectedly. “It’s—” Sam started, his throat bobbing, "I—"
She forced her hands back down from against her temples. Snapping into action, she shoved the blade back in her hand back in her belt and ran for the library. She shot up the ladder and yanked a gigantic book from the shelf.
Cas’s hands tightened on the case. “I’m… very grateful that you share them with me. Your band. All of your music.” He turned to him, “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas didn’t turn around to see, but his words may as well have slapped Direl across the face for the way he went completely silent and slowly fell back into his seat.
They bumped into each other as Dean kept trying to take the turns he thought led to the hallway of bedrooms. Cas seemed to think they were somewhere else, and gently guided him along in that direction. Dean hoped his bedroom hadn’t moved again. It had a bad habit of doing that every few months.
Castiel may have thought their journey would be short, but by Sam’s estimate it would take at least a week, maybe two, of solid walking to reach their destination. Now yes, half of this group was fully immortal, and Bris and Direl were… well, not
“Oh— God— I'm sorry,” Dean stepped forward with his hands raised, “I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to shout—”
Cas. You in action has got to be the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen in my life. But Cas, that doesn’t even matter!
“They’re literally just giant leeches,” Cas said with a shrug. “I assume there’s not a special process to it.”
“Ah... there it is. I was wondering when the other shoe was coming,” Crowley said, more than a bit of nervous tension in his voice.
Charlie would know what to say. Charlie would know what was happening. Charlie would know if he was just making this up.
She gritted her teeth and cranked the temperature, letting the near-scalding water run over her shoulders to carry those thoughts away. And it did, but of course something else came up to take their place.
Dean roared and launched a fist at his door, it rattled loud but didn’t break. Hand throbbing, he spun from it and went to his dresser.
Something familiar clicked in Crowley’s mind, and he found himself saying, “You know, I could do something about that for you.”
Dean huffed a short laugh and sat up in his chair again, taking a second just to watch Cas enjoying the song.
He shifted toward Sam, leaning forward on his elbows and clasping his bottle between his hands, and spoke to him gently and deliberately.
Sam winced. “Well, I wish I could say I know you well enough to just head for the nearest bar…” he glanced away from her, “and the tracking spell didn’t pan out—”
Direl missed the dangerous glint in Crowley’s eyes. “Haven’t the foggiest what you’re talking about,” he clipped.
Sam got to his feet, surprisingly steadily now. He tried that deep breath again, and it felt like a summer breeze, hot and relieving.
“Yeah, Sam— uh...” If Direl was any guide, the actual purpose of their visit wasn’t going to be taken very well, but Dean hadn’t thought up another excuse yet.
Moving methodically, he swept the library, the kitchen, and the map room for threats. Satisfied that the common areas were secure, he hurried to the bedrooms to find Dean and Cas. He reached Cas’s room first, and was about to knock when he heard—
The selkies on the ends of the line, flanking the witch, flipped their knives in their hands and threw them at her. The witch threw up her hand and stopped all of them—
He would push them out, shakily but determinedly, a little further each time, nearly reaching his full span before bringing them back with a snap and starting all over again. And in that stolen moment Castiel had swelled for him, so proud of the pertinacity and the strength of his older brother.
Bris squeezed her eyes until colors swam behind them. She didn’t lift her head when she said, “Nothin’ even happened to me like did Sebhin.” She hugged her knees tighter. “An’ Mol an’ Kira an’... They had to… They had to…”
He stopped in his room to grab his headphones. Just the headphones though, the bottle in there had been empty since last night.
They strolled in silence for a while, purposefully, but not too fast, surrounded by the soft whistle of the wind through the bare branches of the trees and the thick understory. They walked. And they walked. And Sam was just about to speak up when they apparently reached whatever point this selkie was waiting for.
"I believe so," said Cas. “His neural pathways are already healing. I just need to recuperate and then I can—”
"Lord above..." Bris closed her eyes. With a shake of her head she took another breath, clearly gathering herself. “I were brought here against my will, back a few years ago, now. Only just got out, yeh see.” She looked off to the side. “Illinois...
“Things,” Sam confirmed. “Look, ah, my grandpa just sent me to get these, the old coot,” he laughed weakly. “I dunno why he wants ‘em, all he does is shoot at trees anyway.”
Gun still drawn, he ran down the center, looking inside each stall. Monsters of all kinds stared back at him. Some lunged at the bars. Most shrank back into their dark corners.
radio stations again. The sun was peeking out from behind a wall of gray clouds, lighting the faded road before him. Things were just starting to run smoothly on this stupid idea of a trip, when a question arose. It was a question he’d asked himself a million times already on this drive, but now, safe in the warm surround of his car and his music, he wanted to give it another shot.
Or at least, he tried to head out. As he crossed the library, however, Sam made a beeline from the tables to Dean, a conspicuous manila folder in hand.
“‘A keen interest,’ hell of an understatement," Rowena rolled her eyes, "but I can help you do somethin’ about that, Sam. You were right in what ya told me before: What he did? It won't go away. But you can
The crowd erupted around Dean, causing him to reflexively duck at the sudden roar. He looked back over his shoulder to see the selkies surge around Cas, pushing Direl back as they swarmed him. Multiple drinks were thrust at him at once and it seemed like at least half the selkies were trying to shake his hand at the same time.
“Right, is that everyone?” Crowley called out. “Fantastic, off we go then,” he said, not waiting for an answer. He started off and took the lead. Sam, Dean, and Cas followed right behind him, and Direl and Rowena took up the rear.
Sam lowered a hand to his lap and carefully held up his scalpel and tweezers. “Think I can start on those stitches now? I bet they itch like a motherfucker.”
Sam gripped the phone so tightly his hands shook. “You can’t—!” He turned to Dean, tears threatening to spill. “She’s fighting her— They’re going to try to—”
He ended up packing a whole second duffel. After all, who knew what they were going to find on this crapshoot of a case?
Those eyes were so beautiful, so dark and sparkling and wide, and Sam silently vowed to give her that look as often as he could. She asked him, softly, *Why, Sam?*
“Ah— Right. Go get it, please. I’ll just get the notes and the other ingredients from storage and— and we’ll do this!” He gives a short laugh and leaves quickly with a little hop.
Thank god Bris had been there. Thank god she could handle a machete. But if she didn’t— If she hadn’t—
{Golden Dandelions - Barns Courtney} This song has single-handedly gotten me through writing this piece, the happy song to push me through the sad. :)
“Yeah, that’s it! Oh, he were a spry little fella! Thought he could take on the world, tha’ one!” Direl smiled warmly at the memory. “What ever happened to him, Bris?”
How an angel like her had slipped everyone’s notice he’d never know. Pushing a button his ass, she should have been leading
“Oh, don’t act so surprised, Samantha, you called me,” said Crowley, who was indeed now standing between the group and the portal. He lifted his nose and sniffed. “Why does it smell like Big-Time Goddess in here?”
“Love it when you laugh, man.” Dean tilted his head one way or the other, he wasn’t sure. “Whoops,” he rumbled, “Wasn’t gonna tell you that.”
“These two could separate right now and they’d still be able to find someone else who could love them just as much.”
"You were rescued because you needed to be, because you needed to get out of there, because you never should have been there in the first place. If we had known... Fuck, Gabriel, if we had known we would have gotten you out
He could see it on everyone’s faces, he was getting better. Things were better. Even Cas was spending more time around him and
The moment of calm Dean had found in giving Sam shit didn't last nearly long enough. Within minutes of the conversation ending, Dean was back to snatching furtive glances in the rearview mirror; but not because he had the sudden urge to be as safe as possible or anything, no, no.
he was reading for the billionth time to groan and drape himself over the back of his chair, pressing his palms to his face as the tracking programs just ran and ran and
“T’ain’t no more threats out there, way I sees it,” Inas said. “Witch dead, hidden from demons, who else gives a tick about us?”
She burst out into the evening and the cold slammed into her, snapping her back a good few notches from right plastered. Fat lot of good it did her though— she stopped at the sidewalk outside the bar, head swimming with drink, flipping back and forth at the road, not knowing where the fuck she was gonna go. She had to decide quick, but just— but—
They had driven up and down the river, checking every back route and service road from Antioch, IL to Burlington, WI. Twice. They had rented a boat and searched the river, at least three times. Direl did his best to help, but he didn’t recognize anything north of the state border. It had been dark when the selkies had escaped the farm a month ago, and they had been panicked, fleeing for their lives.
“There ye go, love, let it out, let it out. Ye been holdin’ that in for far too long, standin’ too stiff to this. You remember what I always says about the trees, right?”
They pulled into the parking lot of the bar and all piled out, following Dean when he led them all back to the trunk. Bris and Direl's eyes flew wide as Dean propped the false bottom up and reached for a small cooler shoved in the back.
A few people came in with their loads of plates and leftovers. They waited for them to leave to continue.
They all sprinted south, allowing the witch to follow them. Spells were hitting trees all around them, wood chips as sharp as their blades flying through the air.
Cas wandered the aisles of a little thrift store, probably the fiftieth one he’d checked just today.
“‘Kay…” her expression didn't change, “but why do she wanna help you now? Is this somethin’ to do with that fight she were goin’ on about?”
“See, you had a Task:” he said to Castiel, “'Deliver the Righteous Man from Hell', 'Bring Back the Michael Sword', 'Raise Dean from Perdition'. That was it. That was all I ever Meant of you. But, somewhere along the way, you decided that wasn’t enough. You stuck around, you kept popping up, and it made sense at the time but it just kept
“Holy shit,” Dean said as he gaped at it, so brightly colored that the kitchen looked gray by comparison.
A man at the back of the bar caught his eye. Tall, dark haired, just enough scruff, an easy smile on his face and a confident set in his shoulders—
Cas stared at the table. He tilted his head. Then he looked up at them, and said, while waving his hands, “Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.”
“So that was the first step?” Sam asked as he let his hand fall back, his nerves ringing like a bell when it tapped his thigh. “What’s next, are you going to turn me inside out?”
“Now look what you’ve done. You’re worse than worthless. You’re mindless. You’re savage. You’ve never done a good thing for Creation in all this ti—”
Bris and Cas looked up from their conversation as he passed them. If one of them said something, Dean didn’t hear it, he went right to his room and locked the door.
“It’s just— It’s just how you guys are,” Chuck said, almost to himself. He began to pace in his corner of the room, his hands clasped behind his back. “You’re Built to take Orders, so of
“Damn, I bet you'd be amazing in bed,” Steve was saying as he re-did his pants. “You want my number, sugar? I'd show you another good night anytime.”
“Because something is obviously wrong,” he looked her up and down. She was fidgeting and hunching her shoulders.
As they climbed the porch of their first family’s home, Dean reminded Cas, “Alright, this is... Mr. and Mrs. Karim and Jane Ike. Their sons drowned last month.”
” the witch repeated, exasperated. She threw up a hand and the three of them went flying, landing heavily against a hill. The witch dropped a fist down and held it. They were all pinned to the ground.
They followed Mrs. Ike through a little foyer into the living room. As they entered, a tall black man came in from the kitchen, wiping his hands on a tea-towel.
“...yeah, thanks. We’ll be right there, Sheriff,” Dean finished. He stood from the table, addressing Sam as the group approached, “We're heading out. That was the Sheriff, they just found another empty boat. And a body.”
Sam's whole stance sagged where he stood, his heart breaking for her for the second time in an hour.
Castiel had accepted his Fall. He had removed himself fully from the service of Heaven, had left the Host to join the humans on Earth. He had done that. He had
Did they all ignore what they didn't want to hear from him? Cas had told them... told them all in that barn… But they never... Not one of them had said back...
Sam brought out some candles, one shaped like a three and one like a nine. Only two candles, he insisted, or else they’d all die of smoke inhalation. From how small the candles were, Cas made the assumption that it was meant to be a joke and didn’t correct him.
She made a line for the river, ignoring her family’s stares and slipping into the water without a backwards glance to anyone.
“It seemed fitting. And… also…” Jack shuffles sheepishly, “none of the Reapers want to be anywhere near you.”
right outta me. We finally get outta that farm, an’ the afancs comes after us. We take care a’ them, I go off to make the best o' this, an’ a man takes my coat what don’t want it. We beat them afancs
He took his hand back and grabbed the loop of Dean's jeans. Steve tugged on him sharply, lifting his ass from the wall, and rolled his hips maliciously into Dean, bringing him right back around, his hands flying back to slap against the wall as a sharp, strangled moan fell out of him.
He dropped his arm and gestured at the door, “Would you go with them, buddy?” he said to Cas, “I don’t want them going off on their own just ‘cause they’re pissy.”
“...Fuck,” Sam sighed. He looked at Bris and Dean again, at the way they were looking at him in return. "But, I mean, I’m okay now, though... right?”
Steve moved past him, grabbing his coat from his chair, and led the way out of the bar. Dean followed in a bewildered daze, just barely registering that Sam and Cas weren’t at their table anymore.
He turned abruptly and headed further down the hall, intent on finding a quiet place to regain control of his vessel.
Eileen glanced away, “Right.” She took a step into the room. “You know, Sam, I couldn’t help but notice…”
you…” Castiel cut him off, his frustration now taking on the edge of anger. “What I have here— How could you think I shouldn’t care!? My relationships here on Earth are the most important, the most precious to me!”
It was too much. So rather than sour Sam’s important moment, he had left. He would find them later. Perhaps at the bunker. They probably wouldn’t even notice he was missing until another door needed to be opened.
Like he needed to know what Cas was. He knew that already. Cas was an angel. A goddamned Angel who didn’t even think like that so what the hell was the point to all this?
“Because I was angry? Because I was just shouting things?” He pushed off the table to stand up straight, gesturing out in front of himself with his hands. “Bris, I didn't lie to you before, if you don't want to give me your coat, then I don't want it. If— If the only reason you ended up giving it to me was— was because I— No. I never,
So disheveled and broken was the man in front of him that he should have been unrecognizable, but Sam would know this face anywhere. It had haunted his nightmares for years; first those burning with fear and fury, then those washed in guilt and regret. So Sam knew exactly who this was, and it cut something deep inside of him to see him now. To see him small. To see him beaten.
Sam…* She stopped his eminent spiral with a finger pressed to his lips. “Have you already forgotten what that amulet told you? ‘Cause I remember every word.” She pulled him down for a kiss, *Powerful. Worthy. An’
He tucked his phone into his pocket and returned his full focus to the road, gladly losing himself to the music for the next few hours.
Sam took his beer with a smirk and popped the lid with a nearby bottle opener. Cas pushed his lid off with his thumb.
wantin’, that you called a bein’ to you that wants nothin’ but to help ye fill tha' void in yer heart.
“You know, a cassette... To listen to music? Make mixtapes on 'em to give to your girlfriend? ...Or your— friend.” He blinked.
were. How ‘bout I tell you how many fuckers in bars wanted to take me out for a ride when we were still hopping towns with Dad? And
Cas's smile turned knowing, but instead of arguing the point further, he placed two fingers to Dean's temple, and began.
With some texting back and forth, they found the bar Direl had meant and met him inside. Ballo joined him, and much to Sam’s elation, so did Bris. The group found a table and ordered some drinks.
“What?” Direl jumped forward. “No way, Douglas were a wee beastie, no more’n eight meters, this one’s gotta be fifteen!”
don't bother,” she said as they passed through the kitchen, “you're gonna hate it. Not your kinda thing at all.”
killing the angels, one after the other, after the other, after the other— he kills Balthazar, he kills Duma, he kills Ishim, he kills Bartholomew, he kills Alfie—
As the four of them headed off into the white-topped trees, Sam, Cas, and Direl just stood there, baffled, in the silent parking lot.
Sam continued, “It's just that… Used to be Cas would have asked if that was really okay. If that would annoy Dean. And he made him that insane cake, and he wanted to get him a birthday present...” A stray thought caught Sam, “You can see their hearts, can you tell what's going on with those two? Something new?”
They each reached into their belt and pulled out their knives. Ballo held the angel blade that Cas had allowed him to keep.
Later that evening, sitting in the storeroom of the police station, the three of them found themselves surrounded by piles of case files and stacks of their own notes.
When Sam finally got his feet to work again, he returned to the group as well, only half-listening to whatever Jody was saying now. He didn’t know that most of what Dean said wasn’t really going to hit him until he laid down to sleep that night, but with what he was processing right now... of course he couldn’t understand. He cursed himself. He cursed the world. Of course he couldn’t fucking understand. Maybe he couldn’t even help. But he
“Yes, that’s enough,” Cas confirmed after a few were broken. He went to Sam, a little steadier now. Dean kept scraping at the other wardings, one arm absently wrapped around his stomach.
When they separated, Sam looked down at the remaining pile of supplies and asked, “Hey, you want some help here?”
She pocketed it and flashed him a smile. “Thanks, mate. Really, it’s been a gas talkin’ wit’cha, here. Y’know… ‘sides from all the wallowin’.”
“Can’t thank you enough fer helpin' us out here,” Ballo said, his deep, rolling voice rumbling through Dean's chest as much as the creatures' did.
At the next corner, they were able see the rest of the farm. The turf-covered hills they had seen from the outside stretched in rows before them, each at least fifteen feet high and most topped with barred cages.
On the second day, Ketch finished the last of the passports for the selkies, and Bris was ecstatic when Sam told her.
“Look, take it or don’t, but don’t come whining to me when there’s a spell in there you could have used to turn the tide in your favor or something. The record
Sam lunged at the place the witch had just been, but he stumbled, still weak, and she was still gone.
go on!” Direl prodded, perhaps prompted by his fourth beer. “They can handle it, maybe they’ll even ‘ave an idea!”
“But... Father...” he started carefully. When Chuck said nothing at his tone he continued, keeping his voice carefully even. “Father... we’ve tried everything, we’ve looked everywhere. I can’t find him, I can’t reach him—"
. Maybe it was the necklace, or, fuck, maybe talking to Rowena in the Impala a few months ago had knocked something loose.
The thing that Dean had forgotten while he was busy griping about the lack of creativity in the naming schema of Northeastern Illinois— was that stopping for a rest meant getting a motel. And getting a motel, meant sleeping.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean breathed, rubbing where the demon had elbowed him in the ribs. "Can you just take him to the dungeon?”
“Yeah, because I’m going to take relationship advice from you.” Sam rolled his eyes. Then he seemed to realize what he said and cringed.
Cas had known the Winchesters for almost a decade, but they'd never celebrated a birthday like this before, at least not when Cas was around. Usually they had been on the road, or on the run, and Cas had simply come to assume that the brothers just didn’t care about the anniversary of their birth in the way that other people in their culture did. But Sam had insisted that this time be special. Cas couldn't find a reason for this. Dean was turning thirty-nine, and the number itself didn’t merit special significance. This past year hadn't seemed all that different than any other they'd experienced. Cas had even reminded Sam that he and Dean were actually far older than their Earth years reflected— time was experienced very differently in Hell, after all
“Then you came in from the west, and from the north, and you killed, and you burned, and you stuck yourself into the workings of this continent the same as you did all the others. Then more came in from the east, and you killed, and you plundered. You just couldn’t leave well enough alone. Tried to tell Dad. Tried to tell everyone how awful you little cretins were going to be, but would anyone listen to me?”
“Oh, My child—” Fate rushed forward, her arms outstretched. Unseen by Bris, Castiel threw a wing in front of her, blocking Fate’s path, but she simply walked through it, and bent down to fully envelop Bris in a tight embrace.
Dean groaned. That’s all his headache needed, Ketch’s damned voice. He tossed a hand at the pot, “Yeah, I guess…”
It was going to be a challenge to find the selkies. None of them had a phone, and one couldn’t listen for the call of a selkie heart. Direl told them that he had planned to follow Inas south once he had found Ballo and the others, but in the rush they hadn’t agreed upon an exact meeting place. Dean pulled off at a gas station, and Direl and Ballo gathered around Sam’s phone, together looking at the map he pulled up.
Kevin shrank, but he answered. “A way to open a rift. A better, easier way, without archangel grace.”
Dean insisted on cleaning up afterwards, sending Sam off with a bottle of ibuprofen and instructions to 'go get some freakin' sleep'.
Frowning, he lowered them and picked at Dean’s jacket. Michael removed it and the flannel beneath and dropped them to the ground.
They stayed out in the water for a few hours, not that Dean and Cas watched them that long. Eventually the two of them went back to the cars to wait, though Dean did run a towel out to Sam’s pile of dry clothes for him. Their conversation as they sat in the Impala
Sam's tripping unease seemed to light Gabriel's spark again, setting his eyebrows to dancing above a mischievous grin. “Well now you
Dean's memory slid back in, as fuzzy and hazy as ever. The background was almost nonexistent now, only the most immediate things coming into any sort of focus. He set a bottle opener on some counter top and raised his eyes back up from it. Cas’s tan form waved before him.
“I can’t believe you didn’t know,” Dean says, choking out the words. “I thought— Thought I couldn’t hide it any worse. I love you, too, asshole. I don’t even know how long, but I love you— I love you so much it
“Oh my god— Oh god, I’m so sorry, Baby!” Dean looked around as if he were going to see the problem as he caressed the dashboard. “I’ll fix that when we get home, I promise.”
And suddenly Sam sound himself fighting a smile, because he remembered then that Gabriel had previously directed Cas to them for help with his “problem.”
Castiel straightens and, feeling a little silly, mirrors Dean's posture and attempts to move himself to the beat of the music, stumbling over himself every few bars. Dean continues to encourage him and after a few songs, he begins to feel more confident.
Dean grinned crookedly, which Castiel counted as a win. He picked up the cup, thanked Castiel, and headed out the door. Castiel worked very hard to keep his eyes above Dean's belt as he walked away.
"I'll work extra hard on this one, then," he said, turning away with the cups. He quickly whipped up the soy latte and held Dean's cup in his hand, hesitating in front of the carafe. Before he could talk himself out of it, he quickly took the sharpie from his apron and scrawled out his phone number, just above the paper sleeve, before filling the cup and taking both drinks to Dean. He smiled as innocently as he could.
Dean nodded and left with the two drinks. As soon as he was out of sight of the store windows, Castiel slumped against the counter. At least now he would know whether Dean read the cups or not.
"Don't worry, Claire, take your time," Castiel said warmly. "But don't actually, I've got a hot date."
When they part again, Castiel's hands slide down along Dean's arms as he casts his eyes to the side. "Dean I...I'm getting married in a few days..."
"Dean, is that..." Castiel said, admiring the appliance. It was almost nicer than the ones he had at the Bean. But if Dean could make excellent coffee at home... "Why do you come to the Bean if you've got something like that at home?"
Castiel sighed. "Me neither." He thought for a moment, and then added, "I haven't been on a date like this...ever. I haven't even been on a date at all in years."
He walked over to Castiel and held out his hand. Castiel hesitantly took it and pulled himself up off the couch. Shoving down his fears of what he might be about to find in the upstairs of the house of a man he was now realizing he barely knew, he followed Dean up the stairs to a room down the hall on the left which appeared to be Dean's office. It was warmly decorated, with a few plants, some photos of family and friends, and a large corkboard on the wall next to the computer. Dean flicked on the lights and stood next to the corkboard. Getting a better look at it, Castiel saw pieces of thick paper pinned all over it. Paper with...his handwriting. Castiel brought a hand to his mouth.
"Yeah. I was...I was gonna go out to the Roadhouse for a burger. Do you want to come? With me?" Dean slapped a hand to his forehead as quietly as possible. Smooth, Winchester.
When he's finally standing, Castiel's fingers brush over his lips. They still tingle as though shocked from the unexpected contact. "Dean, I..."
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, me neither." There was another moment of silence until Dean said, "Do you want to come back to my place? I still owe you coffee."
Dean sat down and ran a hand through his hair, kicking himself internally. "Yeah I...I just brought a bunch of groceries in from the car." Castiel hummed and Dean leaned back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling. "Listen, uh..." What was he supposed to say, anyway? He thought of Sam earlier, heard his brother's words ringing in his head. You should ask out Cas. "Do you...are you busy tonight?"
"I should be able to, I own the place," he said. "I'll just have to remember how many cute guys I've given free coffee when I go to balance my books."
Castiel was dumbfounded. Dean locked the portafilter in place and then paused. He turned to Castiel with a big grin. "Actually, there's something I want to show you."
"Ah, ah, Cas, eyes up here." Castiel's gaze flicks up and lands on Dean's sparkling green eyes and his heart begins to race again. His mind spins with concern, causing him to lose his footing and tangle his leg with Dean's, knocking them to the floor. When Castiel's mind catches up, he finds himself on top of Dean, hands splayed out on either side of his friend's head while Dean stares up at him with wide eyes. For the briefest moment, he sees a hint of colour on his friend's cheeks beneath the constellations of freckles. Castiel's chest feels tight, perhaps because he is embarrassed. For once, Dean appears to be speechless. His mind insists that he needs to get off Dean, help his friend up again, but his muscles simply won't respond. Dean isn't telling him to get off of him, either. Castiel can feel a tickling in his stomach that felt foreign and strange. Just as he's about to apologize to Dean for knocking him down, Dean surges forward, capturing Castiel's lips in a surprisingly passionate kiss. Castiel recoils, shocked. Now kneeling above Dean's legs, he feels as though his face is burning.
Dean accepted the cup, looking slightly crestfallen. "You, uh, give free coffee to a lot of 'cute guys'?"
Castiel looked up from writing "Dean" on the cup and eyed the man curiously. He set down the named cup and picked up another. "And the name for this cup?" he asked, trying not to sound too suspicious.
Dean pulled Castiel into a hug and continued next to his ear. "Thank you. It meant everything to know someone cared, someone was listening."
"No, don't say anything. Let's just pretend it didn't happen." Dean paints on an obviously fake smile, but when Castiel's expression doesn't change, it instantly falls away. "Or...maybe I should just go."
"Thanks," Dean said with a tired smile as he tapped his card on the reader and Castiel stamped his frequent brewer's card. Dean ritualistically made his way to the pickup counter, and Castiel took the opportunity to write a quick "Good luck on your pres" on Dean's cup before pouring the brew and handing it to Dean. Dean took it and thanked Castiel without looking at the cup. Castiel hoped that he would see the message before his presentation.
"I wouldn't call owning a successful business 'substandard'," Dean said. "What does your brother do?"
"Great," Castiel said. He rang up the coffee and pulled a medium paper cup from the stack. "And can I get a name?"
Dean closed his eyes and continued to waltz with himself, deftly spinning around Castiel, who stood dumbstruck. After a few beats, one of Dean's eyes cracks open to look at him and he smiles.
Unable to summon anymore nerve, Castiel had scowled at the ground, mumbling, "Yes, father," before he was dismissed.
"Dean..." Castiel says quietly, his voice deep and thick. Dean brings one hand up from his waist and places it on Castiel's cheek.
Dean chuckles. "Yeah, Cas's always leaving me little..." He held up the cup to look at Castiel's note of the day when he saw the digits and had to fight down a blush. "Uh...huh."
Dean starts to walk past Castiel looking completely defeated. Castiel's mind is screaming to the point that he can't understand what it was saying, so he just follows his heart instead, grabbing Dean by the shoulders and pulling him close, slotting their lips together with as much expertise as someone who has been kissed once (thirty seconds ago) can. Dean's body is frozen, but Castiel persists until finally, Dean's hands fall onto Castiel's waist and he gently, carefully moves his lips against Castiel's, as if he's afraid to startle him and ruin the moment. After a moment that feels like a lifetime, Castiel slowly pulls away, searching Dean's face for...something. Anything that might indicate how he's feeling. All he sees is slightly hooded green eyes and a hotly flushed cheeks.
Castiel felt a blush rise to his cheeks and he felt his heart pound in his chest as he tried to objectively interpret the meaning of Dean's last sentence. Castiel smiled at Dean to relieve the tension.
Castiel didn't normally take that much notice of his customers, but this man...how could he not notice? As soon as he had seen his stunning green eyes, his short, dark blond hair ruffled from the wind outside, something had stirred in him for the first time in a while.
"Several, actually," Castiel said unenthusiastically. "Mostly doctors and lawyers now. In fact, only my brother Gabriel and I have 'substandard' jobs by my parents' standards."
Dean chuckled, tamping down the grinds. "I was running late one day and it was on my way to work," he explained. "Guess I liked the ambiance."
Castiel smiled cheekily and grabbed a cup. "Don't worry, you can just make it up to me later." Dean fumbled for his wallet but Castiel shook his head, writing Dean's name on the cup. "On the house."
A few years ago, however, a new, bigger newspaper had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and had presented his family with major competition for the first time. His family had tried everything from lowering the price of the paper to embellishing the headlines, but it wasn't long before they weren't turning enough profits to keep their gates open. Hundreds of workers had been laid off, the presses left to collect dust in the empty building. Now, his mother is bedridden with illness and his father manages finances for a local fish monger, saving each penny to pay for his mother's medicine.
"One vegan cup of syrup with a splash of coffee," he said teasingly as Sam put the book away. His brother took the coffee and produced a bitchface.
"Okay, Cas, let's move around a little more." He counted them in again and Castiel began guiding Dean around the study, careful not to run into anything. He casts a glance down at their feet but Dean quickly interrupts him.
"Sorry! Sorry..." Dean says, wiping a hand down his face. "I'm sorry, I, uh..." He stands, dusting off his pants. "That was uncalled for. Here." He offers Castiel his hand and helps him up.
"That's great, Cas!" Dean exclaims as the song came to an end. He runs over and changes the record again before returning to his place before Castiel. This time, though, Dean takes Castiel's hand and places it gingerly on his waist. As he places his hand on Castiel's shoulder and clasped their other hands, Castiel can feel the ripple of muscles beneath his fingers and heat creeps onto his cheeks. His heart is racing, but when he meets Dean's confident gaze, he manages to compose himself. Surely all those nerves are getting to him.
They passed the rest of the drive making small talk and getting to know each other in simple ways. Castiel learned that Dean's father was a mechanic most of his life and ran an auto shop with his friend and Dean's "Uncle" Bobby. He learned that Sam was studying to be a lawyer, "But the good kind," and that his mother was a painter. Castiel told Dean about his failed attempt at following in his older sibling's footsteps and his decision to drop out of an undergraduate in medical sciences and instead take some small business courses while working as a barista. Eventually he had enough schooling, experience, and savings to open his own place and after years of barely scaping by it had become a local favourite.
Dean opened his mouth to retort, but it was undeniable at this point. He sighed and held the cup between his knees, slightly hunched in defeat. "Yeah, maybe."
"It's your turn," Dean finally offers, and Castiel knows that it's an invitation to use their game as a distraction, but it's already clear that a simple game of chess simply cannot pull him from his wallowing.
"The notes you left for me," Dean confirmed. "I...kept them. Cut them out. They really brought me out of some tough places, and they're a reminder that there are good people out there, people with big hearts." Dean closed in on Castiel and took his hands in his own. "People like you."
Castiel climbed inside and sat down on the passenger side of the bench as Dean slid in the drivers side and started the engine, which revved with a gentle purr. Classic rock played softly through the old stereo and Dean pulled out onto the quiet downtown street.
"It's very simple, see?" Dean says as his feet move perfectly with the music. "Just move with the rhythm of the music. Feel it inside you and let it lead the way."
Dean stayed silent while he willed his heartrate to go back to normal. Sam, blessedly, said nothing as well, though Dean could sense the stupid triumphant grin on his brother's face. Finally, Sam changed the subject and began telling Dean about a cute girl in his classes who he was getting to know. They had met as part of a study group and he was going to ask her to join him for lunch at class the next day.
Sam sat silently for a moment, staring out across the quad. After a while, he added, "You know, I haven't seen you as happy as you are talking about Cas in a long time."
"He runs a small chain of candy stores," Castiel explained. "'Something Sweet', I don't know if you've heard of them. He sometimes sends me samples to sell at the Bean."
"It's our last hope," his father had said after describing his--well, it could really only be described as a  "plot"--to Castiel. "With your brother gone to chase skirts across Europe and your mother ill, we have no choice."
Dean pulled away and squeezed Castiel's hands. "Now, come on. We'll see who makes the better espresso, you or me."
Castiel made his way to the living area, turning on the fireplace before he went to sit. Just as he was lowering himself onto the couch, he caught a glimpse of Dean in the kitchen, turning on a high-quality espresso machine.
"Perhaps I'm overinflating things," Castiel concedes, "but I'm nervous about the wedding. I only have five days and I feel so unprepared. I don't even know how to dance!"
Castiel's parents owned a very successful newspaper. He has fond memories of visiting the printing press and watching the machines mass-produce the morning paper. He can remember when his father had found out about his brother Gabriel skipping his lessons and had sentenced him to selling papers for a day, telling them if he didn't earn at least thirty cents, he would not be allowed supper. Castiel had snuck out of the house for a chance to witness Gabriel on the street corner, pathetically announcing the dull headline while the other real newsboys looked on and laughed.
Dean smiles sadly, rubbing his thumb over Castiel's cheek and drawing his blue-eyed gaze back. "I know," he says softly before touching their foreheads and brushing their noses together. "But you'll always have me."
His father's face had turned stone cold. "You will do what I say, Castiel. You are a part of this family, and as the future man of the house your have a responsibility to it."
"Welcome to the Busy Bean, what can I get started for you?" Castiel asked as the man reached the counter.
Dean looked surprised, which confused Castiel. Dean clarified, "Don't you think it would be a little weird for you to make me a coffee, since we're going on a...date?"
Dean snorted a laugh. "Nah, just my kid brother. He wanted to see just how good the coffee was, since I come here almost every day, and he's into that vegan stuff so..." Dean trailed off, tapping his card and not looking up as he put it back in his wallet. "I don't really do...girlfriends."
"This is the best burger I've ever eaten," Castiel muttered around a mouthful before diving in again. Dean laughed and picked up a fry.
"I know, I'm sorry. I've been up all night and the only thing that's kept me up is about two pots of coffee. Not as good as yours though," he added with a weak chuckle. "I have this big presentation today, and I really need it to go well."
It's exactly five days and thirteen hours before the wedding. Castiel sits across from Dean as his friend surveys the board, calculating his next move. Dean's never been good at chess, but he still insists on playing every evening that they are together. Dean makes his move and Castiel is barely paying attention as he captures Dean's exposed rook. Dean makes a sound of protest and begins to contemplate his rebuttal, but Castiel's attention drifts away as his mind circles around his impending marriage.
"Okay, now here's the tricky part," Dean says, adjusting their stance. "Keep moving to the music, but take me with you. Show me where you're going with your hand on my waist." At Castiel's terrified expression, he laughs. "Don't worry, I'll help you out this time, but you probably won't get so lucky with your bride, so focus. One, two, three, one, two, three--Ouch!" Dean winced when Castiel stepped heavily on his foot. "Right foot first, Cas...always the right foot first. Probably should have mentioned that."
"Sure, that would be great!" Dean said. He couldn't believe that had worked. "I'll be there in an hour. See you soon!"
"Sam, huh?" Castiel said, trying to keep the bitter iciness out of his voice. "Who's that? New girlfriend?"
Castiel went through the kitchen to the break area, grabbing his trench and shrugging it on. He emerged from the back and made his way towards Dean. Dean took a swig of his coffee and then led Castiel out to his car. His Black Beauty of a car.
Dean's eyes widen for a beat, but his cocky smile soon returns to his freckled face. "Well, if that's the only thing you're worried about, that's an easy fix." Dean slides his chair away from the chessboard and stands up, offering a confused Castiel his hand. Castiel reluctantly takes it and is pulled to a more open part of the study. Dean leaves him there for a moment, walking over to the record player and choosing a record from Castiel's collection, many of which had been gifts from Dean. Soon, soft music in a gentle 3/4 begins to play and Dean returns to face him. He holds one hand in front of him and one out to his side and begins to move.
"D-Dean," Castiel stammers. Dean's eyes are wider than before and he looks terrified, an expression Castiel has never seen on his friend. Dean quickly pulls his legs out from under Castiel, sliding a few inches away.
Sam rolled his eyes. Dean grinned back, and picked up his pace down the greyscale streets. At this rate, they were really gonna be late.
"You think I don't fucking know that," Dean snapped. "It's the only thing I can think of these days. I can't—I just can't. I know I'm a selfish asshole and I don't deserve you, any of it, but I miss you, Cas, god, I miss you." He inched forward on his knees, carpet scraping along his jeans, until he could wrap his arms around Cas's waist. He buried his face into his stomach and breathed. He still smelled the same, and it was enough for now.
“The two rundown hunters you’re talking about are the two most important people I know.” Cas was pulling that solemn, wide-eyed look again, the one that said
He shoved away the people crowding around him, making a beeline for the exit, brushing off the sharp questions with a mumbled deflection. He pushed open the door and ran out into the brisk, freezing air and looked up.
How could he relax? How could he have fun when Meg was in his arms, gorgeous and smiling, and Dean was all the way across the dancefloor?
“Because I didn’t approach you at the gift shop because your eyes were green. I did because I wanted to get to know you—to talk to you—and because there’s something about you that makes me want to tell you everything about me.”
“I think you two can work it out on your own,” Beth said. “I don’t—listen, I’m just here for the volunteer hours. I’m actually supposed to leave, now, so here you go—” She shoved the pie tin towards the two of them. “Have fun. Nice seeing you guys. Happy Pi Day!”
The love went away on its own, and even the taste faded away eventually. Castiel obediently pressed and penned down each and every blossom. Sometimes, he'd flip through the pages, fingering the edges of the wrinkled petals with a strange sense of detachment. He remembered the love, but he couldn't remember the sensation; like watching a movie or reading a book, it was all in the past. His crushes were always baby-pink innocent, pale pastel petals, and the memories were warm and fuzzy. The stronger ones were darker, navy reds and blues in blossoming jasmine and peony. (He hadn't had a rose, yet. He wondered who would be his rose.) His first time having sex was with a girl a grade up called Meg who had smirked at him while he fumbled with the condom. He thought that Meg would have to be a big, loud flower, the sort that took up the centrepiece of a bouquet; big black roses or a cactus flower that hurt coming up. But he never had any for Meg, and Meg hadn't had any for Castiel.
“Emily,” Dean would read, and Castiel would reply obediently, “Daffodils. She was my lab partner in Chemistry.”
"That’s fine," Castiel interrupted with a smile. He dragged his luggage through the door, and deposited it on his side of the carpet before studying the rest of the room. Dean had arrived early, as far as he could tell, and was almost finished unpacking—posters littered the walls, and a closet was stocked up with a faceful of flannel.
The music abruptly stopped. Castiel peered into the room the exact moment that someone appeared in the doorway and nearly ran into him.
His head hurt like someone had taken a jackhammer to his skull, of course, but his heart—that was a different matter entirely. The physical sensations came back to him slowly, piece by piece (gummy eyes, cracked lips, an awful bitter taste in his mouth) but through it all, his heart pounded relentlessly and ached steadily as it did so—ached with a fierceness that made his breath catch.
Dean was sitting next to him, his hands all over Castiel, on his shoulders on his waist on his back, rubbing circles like he always did (he always did that, when Castiel was sick vomiting hungover drunk). Words were meandering their way into Castiel’s head, muffled by the stream of flowers.
When Castiel was first contacted to become one of the castle’s guards, he’d been apprehensive at first: he hadn’t even trained in Winchester grounds before. But news of his skill travelled quickly—even through land that was a three-day trip—and it would, as he’d been reminded dozens and hundreds and thousands of times, be an incredible honour and dignity to serve the Winchesters. The months leading up to the trip, Castiel had been putting extra hours and long gruelling nights into his training, determined to meet their expectations—or exceed them.
“Seriously?” Castiel was mildly incredulous. “What about when he disguised himself as a stableboy to sneak out and ride horses at night?”
Rolling his eyes, the man gestured up and down himself. “Like you said, I don’t look much like royalty, do I?”
knowing they’re doing it out of sheer necessity? Out of pity? It’s worse than anything the disease could bring. It’s the worst feeling in the world.”
Castiel lifts his head from where he was meticulously picking out all the pretzels from the snack mix. Dean hates the pretzels; his husband is certifiably insane. “Hello, Dean,” he responds. His voice is a little hoarse, a little low, like he’s been drinking too much beer and talking the whole night.
Castiel tried to no avail to evade Dean’s eyes. It felt as if he could see past Castiel’s skin and bones all the way to the heart. (He didn’t need to see him to do that.) They were always green to a fault, startlingly so, but it was only now that Castiel was beginning to really, truly notice them.
"For now? Get over it," Singer said curtly. "I'll give it to you straight: right now, you've got two ways to go. You can get over it, and the flowers will get rid of themselves. Alternatively, you can get surgery—which I wouldn't suggest, considering the potential complications."
Cas lifted his head. His blue eyes were red-rimmed, eyelashes all clumped, and his face was all red from crying. “Who are you?” he demanded, his voice shaky but firm.
“Dean?” he piped up ten minutes later, when their pyjamas were on and they were settling into their respective beds on opposite sides of the room.
On Friday, Cas somehow spotted the same Beetle again on their way to school together, right as it turned the corner and disappeared into the swarm of other vehicles. Dean argued cheating, because there were plenty of blue cars around here, plenty of short, stubby-looking cars that could closely resemble a Punch buggy but
Castiel met his face, his first thought being that the man was absolutely gorgeous—bright green eyes and tousled hair—and then he quickly dashed that thought away with a burst of annoyance.
Dean had gotten so used to being loved, he realized staggeringly, that he hadn't even noticed it until it was gone.
Fix this, he thought, and reached for Cas with fingers shaking so badly they could hardly move, and leaned in with tears running down his cheeks and slicking the way, and he missed Castiel's lips and caught his cheek instead but judging from Castiel's reaction, he might as well kissed him straight on the mouth.
Dean pursed his lips in sympathy. “I can help with both of those,” he said, “but only partially. Bobby told me you shouldn’t eat anything too heavy in calories for a few days, or anything high in fat, just to give your body a chance to recalibrate itself without anything getting in the way. And we still have to get you to sign some forms before we can get you home, but that shouldn’t take long, and you’ll be able to rest properly as soon as I get my hands on those papers.” Feeling a draw like a magnet to the Earth, Dean inched closer to Castiel’s bed until he could see every crease and corner of the mattress. “Does that sound good?”
Dean smiled and moved his hand to Cas’s shoulder instead; gave it a squeeze. “It’s okay,” he said, the words feeling common on his tongue now.
"Castiel?" A female voice drifted in from the halls. Castiel looked up to see a nurse holding a clipboard.
“I, uh,” Dean said, abruptly flustered. “I think it’s real pretty how it covers all the trees and grounds. All—white, and, uh.” It took him a moment to realize that Castiel was trying not to laugh. “Oh, fuck you! I’m not Shakespeare.”
Pushing aside branches and flinching at sharp twigs dragging themselves along his skin, Castiel trudged and stomped and followed the man, who walked without hesitation, until—all of a sudden it seemed, without any indication nor signal—they were in a tunnel, surrounded by damp dark stone and so narrow Castiel’s hair brushed the top.
Castiel recognized faintly. Someone was singing along in a rough, low voice that was surprisingly on-tune.
Dean grinned and reached over to mess up Sam’s hair one last time. The thought made him sober up. “I’ll visit as much as I can, but I don’t know how busy this semester’s gonna get, so.”
“Longest day ever,” Castiel breathes, squirming briefly, cold toes prodding against Dean’s ankles, before finding a position he’s satisfied with; halfway on top of Dean and wearily sprawled, just melting, moulding, into Dean.
Sam said, big eyes watery and accusing as he stared up at Dean from his position, cross-legged and cross-arms and sprawled across the dirt. “Wanna stay and play with Isobel.”
Dean sighs. Lets it settle into his bones and trickle through his veins and sink into his skin, like a tattoo or a scar. “Yeah,” he says, and he suddenly feels like he’s teetering on a knife’s edge to crying, which is just—ridiculous.
"I know. I love you too. I have to go, now, the elevator's closing and I just know it’ll be up there for ages and ages before it comes back down again—I'll call you!"
He reached out before Castiel could protest, fingers deftly tucking his dress shirt under his blazer so that it laid across the fabric crease-less and smooth. Ran a hand through Castiel’s hair, which Castiel sputtered at because unlike Dean, his casually-ruffled look looked more like he’d just gone ten rounds with a leafblower. Stepped back, gave him a silent once-over, and then unbuttoned the topmost button in Castiel’s shirt. His tongue was peeking out just the barest from the corner of his lips the way he did when focusing on a tricky math question, or trying to remember a niche word, and Castiel’s mouth went dry.
“Having a good time?” Dean asks, stupidly. Castiel has lost the jacket sometime during the night, his dress shirt rumpled at the collar and half-turned up. Dean can’t help himself; steps closer and reaches up to tug at his collar gently and smooth it out. His fingers brush up against warm skin and he shivers even though it’s burning up in the ballroom, all moving bodies and laughter. At the last second before he draws away, Castiel turns his head to press a kiss to Dean’s knuckles. He smiles and Dean grins back, blurts, “Dance with me?”
he said, and grimaced while wiping his mouth. He flushed the toilet and watched the contents of his stomach swirl away.
"I'm not," Castiel said. "Like I said, you can't choose who you love." He held Dean's eyes as he said it, and Dean, someone startled by the intenseness of the gaze, directed his attention to the floor instead.
Castiel looked away, hiding a smile. "It didn't work out," he said. "Tom's—nice. But I only like him as a friend. I had a good evening with him, but there wasn't a spark."
Bobby made a move as if to shake Dean’s grip off, and then changed his mind. “He’s fine,” he said, and Dean let out a barely-there sob and if he hadn’t been holding on to Bobby, he would’ve sank onto the tiled floor. “He’s recovering right now, but he should be awake, unless he fell asleep in the two minutes I left him for.”
tall, lazy, swooping hills, children scattered like ants across the canvas, tiny puffy jackets and hats with pom-poms at the end, arms thrown in the air and sleds shooting up snow from the back. The snow wasn’t splattered or dripped, but hand-painted, every speck fluffy and distinct.
The dinner passed uneventfully. Castiel ordered the parmesan chicken and thought that tasted nothing like Dean’s. The music they were playing in the restaurant was some awful modern-day pop that would probably make Dean gag himself with the soup spoon. When the waiter came with the bill, Castiel remembered when he’d gotten a part-time job at a fast food place a few months ago, and Dean had gone through the drive-thru eight times in one night just to say hello and bought eighty chicken nuggets that went stale in the fridge.
Beth ate it up, her cheeks going pink as she giggled at Dean. Castiel immediately decided that he hated him.
“Like if the horses really wear golden armour,” Castiel said, a soft smile coming upon his face despite himself.
Castiel’s pulse pounded in his ears. He steadied his breathing, gentle and barely-there as he exhaled against the man’s finger. He was surrounded by him—warmth and soft fabric and a grassy scent that was distracting enough that Castiel didn’t even realize when the voices had passed until the man slowly took his finger off of Castiel’s lips.
and takes a step back, dips his head down slightly, extends a graceful hand (or as graceful as he can be with the buzz of champagne fading away with the dregs of exhaustion seeping back in) towards Castiel.
“Sammmy,” he drawled, pitching his voice to his top-notch annoying tone and turning his head to see his brother, who blinked blearily into consciousness.
“Um,” Maggie said, and ducked her head and smiled, small and sweet. “Yeah, actually. I’ve seen you around on campus a few times, and I just—I was wondering if I could get your number?”
"Well, up you go," Singer ordered, and Castiel obediently followed through the routine check-ups before the x-ray was fully developed. Afterwards, they crowded around the mosaic of monitors and watched as the results flickered onto the screen.
He stood there for fifteen minutes until a shooting pain made its way down his neck and he grimaced, rubbed it away, and was suddenly aware of the goosebumps all over his skin and the breath fogging up the air in front of him.
The horse nickered and drew to a stop, right near the entrance gates of the Winchester grounds. From outside the window of the carriage, Castiel couldn’t quite catch the castle: the peaks much too high to see from here, but even with the limited view he could already make out the extravagant paths and grandiose atmosphere.
Cas laughed again. Uncurling. He was getting up from the ground, pushing himself until he was sitting up straight, and then drawing his knees together, copying Dean.
So if there was a free coat in the middle of the library, hell yeah it was a free coat in the middle of the library. Dean strolled out of the library whistling.
Castiel took Dean’s hand two paces down the hall, and Dean squeezed it, feeling his heart kick up in a flutter that felt like freedom, flying and nothing like choking, nothing like the cloying rotten sweetness of roses scattered down the stairwell, nothing at all.
“Any,” Dean yelled back, glancing at the road and drifting the Impala slightly to the left so that there was ample space between the car and the guardrail. That would be one hell of a roadrash.
Her flats hit the floor at a steady, speedy clip that had Castiel hurrying to keep the pace. "Hanahaki, right?" she asked with no preamble.
"Sorry," Sam said, not sounding very sorry and sounding very grim. "It was alcohol poisoning. The doctors said he'll be fine."
No, Castiel thought, he really wouldn't. He couldn't, because if he did it would only make it worse (rejection speeds up the process, he remembered, a blurb from a webpage he had seen, and so did overt kindness and love from Dean to him, love that was purely platonic and would be nothing, never, more, because it did nothing but serve to drill in the fact that Castiel was hopelessly in love with someone that would never love him back, and the idea that Dean did love him, just in a way that was all wrong, made the flowers grow with a ferocity that blossomed tenfold).
Dean was just about to get up, maybe pretend like he was taking a call, and scamper away, shamed, when the man spoke.
“But, seriously,” Dean added, face relaxing once he saw Castiel’s smile, “it’s fine. Just don’t let it kill you, alright? And remember that I’m always here for you, no matter what.”
It’s been hours and hours. The balls of his feet are aching, complaining up to the nines and he’s sure he’ll have callouses tomorrow where the heel rubs up with every step. His eyes, closed, breathe an exhausted sigh of relief. They choose to remain closed, would prefer to stay closed, actually, for the rest of tonight. Preferably in a bed. With Castiel next to him. Right this instant. Dean’s not as young as he used to be, and he’s never felt it more acutely. But there are guests to politely chase away and leftover food to pack and store in the fridge for morning-afters and glitter to sweep off the floor, so when the song inevitably draws to an end, he counts to three before reluctantly pulling open his eyelids. Castiel gazes back at him, blue eyes hazy with the same thoughts.
Two weeks later, it was with a creeping hesitation and reluctant recognition that Castiel had to admit that his plan wouldn’t just need to be altered, but utterly revamped.
"I'll inspire your—narcissism—" Dean frowned, and then seemed to shake off the attempt. Instead, he dove towards Castiel, tackling him into the couch.
“Now isn’t the time to be a hardass, Cas,” Dean whispered back. He wasn’t rubbing Castiel’s back anymore, the worst of the fit ended; he was stroking, now, in long sweeping brushes of his hand from the nape of his neck to the delicate curve of his lower back.
She tutted sympathetically. "Don't worry—Dr. Singer will give you a quick x-ray, and we'll see how bad it is."
“Do you know this song?” he asks Castiel, who tilts his head to the side, listening for a moment, and then nods.
Dean looked closer. There, right on Cas’s pinky finger, at the first knuckle: a spot, swelling up and an angry red.
“Nevermind,” Dean said, and smiled as he heard Castiel humming some indistinguishable tune as he walked towards the kitchen. He stayed sitting for a few minutes, and then got up to chase down Castiel before he could fuck up the scrambled eggs.
Their noses brushed, glanced away. Dean waited, waited, until he realized that Castiel was waiting for him.
That night was a bit like catharsis and a little like therapy and a lot like a one-sided sob-story, but now that Dean had gotten it out and gotten over it, he was able to approach it with a clearer mind, analyze it like a Rubik’s cube, turning and examining every corner until he had reached the right method.
Dean's laugh was loud and carefree in a way that loosened something inside Castiel. "Nevermind, then. Can you do the dishes?"
He was still reading his book. He was only wearing a navy button-up, which was strange, but maybe he was one of those people who ran hot.
“The flowers were for you,” he said, and the words hung in the air like an anvil before crashing down on them both.
“Thanks again for letting me borrow this,” Dean said as he got up from the bench, putting the coat back on and feeling the warmth creep back into him (although he didn’t really need it now—somehow, he’d all but forgotten about the cold). “Oh, and, by the way—it does look pretty straight.”
“It’s fine, dude,” she said. “I get it. It’s pie. If I hadn’t had, like, five pieces already, I’d probably be demanding it right about now too.”
“Absolutely not,” Dean immediately said, face like Castiel just dropkicked a puppy. “And leave you at home alone? On Prom night? What kind of best friend would I be?”
and all of a sudden it was like he could hear it going by, each second a raindrop shattering against the pavement and dissolving into the dirt, each blink of his eye a day wasted.
Dean’s mother slowed, and then gently put down the knife on the cutting board before turning around and giving the two of them a long stare. “And why do you want to know? Has any one of you had the flowers?”
Dean himself didn’t see a colour until he was sixteen, and even then it was very nearly a mistake. In fact, it began with one—it wasn’t as if he was
Castiel inhaled and felt where the breath caught its way up his throat, snagging on a root, a branch, a blossom. He coughed, and Dean cursed, wrapping his arms around him.
Benny was purple, and Dean didn’t know he was into guys until he woke up in bed with him curled up on his chest. Dean teased him to no end about being a closeted cuddler, except frequent future tests proved that it was in fact
“Yes I can.” Dean’s voice was hard. “We’re not allowed to do that anymore. End of discussion.” His knuckles, white on the wheel. “Cas, Truth or Dare?”
Dean talked about how he hadn’t heard anything from John in over a year, and Cassie talked about how she wished Dean would stop drinking so much before bed—talked, and then insisted, and then pleaded. And Dean tried, but the harder it got the easier it got to drink the days away, until he woke up one day alone in bed with a nasty hangover and a signed note from Cassie on the bedside table with a tablet of ibuprofen and a glass of water.
“Remember when I asked you to the Halloween dance?” she asked him some year or so later, when both of them were in eighth grade and bright-eyed in pursuit of highschool.
“Oh,” Dean said. “That’s okay, Sammy.” He sat down next to him and grabbed the newspaper, rolling it up before setting it aside and turning back to Sam with a superior big-brother air. “You see, Sammy, Hanahaki is when you get sick, and you throw up flowers.”
and Hemingway and all the other girly books that were chock-filled with run-on sentences and dubious metaphors. Something about books was comforting in their binary structure: black on white and nothing more, never more. You’d never look at a page in a book and see anything other than black on white, no matter how many colours you could see.
Dean chewed on his lip and tried to think of the best way to respond to his little brother in a way that wasn’t, Maybe he doesn’t know that. Maybe he’s just a sad, sick person who misses his wife so hard he can’t think. Maybe Heaven isn’t real.
“He has bad taste, then,” Dean said, because he was staring at Castiel’s blue eyes and couldn’t think.
Cas smiled, softer now. His eyes weren’t just blue, Dean realized, but a bit of green, too, and a light, murky brown when the sun went behind the clouds. “That’s okay,” he said. “I’m getting better at ignoring him.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Come on, let’s go, we’re taking up the sidewalk,” he said, and they started down the road, side by side, shoulders knocking together.
“Nice to meet you, Katrina,” Castiel said. “How are you finding this evening? Enjoying all the art, I hope?”
absolutely,” Dean breathed, and Cas was right there again, not an inch of space between them and it was just the way Dean liked it, just what he needed, Cas kissing him hard and Dean kissing him back, feeling giddy and high and drunk on sunshine for the rest of the day.
“How is it? What did he say? What did he do?” Dean grabbed Castiel’s hands in both of his and forced them still, pressed them against their chests like a knot.
He remembered Castiel loving him. And when he let those floodgates open, when it was too late to go back, it was somehow safer, more okay, to remember even more.
There’s glitter on the floor; Dean doesn’t know how the fuck it got there since he’d veto-ed glitter a long, long,
"The usual. Coughing—it escalated to throwing up a few days ago. It happens a few times a day, now, I think."
Maybe he should thank him instead, though. Dean squeezes Castiel’s hand, gently, and tugs him in closer until their bodies are flush together; wraps an arm around his soft waist. In response, Castiel rests his head upon Dean’s shoulder, exhale tickling his neck. Wordlessly, they begin to sway, so delicately they’re almost standing still. Initially, Dean had thought that this—all of it—standing together, swaying together, not a single word spoken—would be awkward and uncomfortable as hell, but it amazes him at how wrong he is. Castiel fits in his arms like a puzzle piece slotting in place, and Dean can just close his eyes and hold him, revel and bask in the weight, the bulk, of his husband so close. He can hardly hear the music over the buzz of his own contentment.
He developed a cough the next morning. When Dean glanced at him with worry, squinting eyes and hedgehog hair from the couch (blanket falling down to reveal nothing but a too-loose t-shirt, sharp collarbone and freckles), Castiel drank a glass of warm water and shooed Dean away to his morning lecture.
Dean grimaced again. “Sorry. Again. Sometimes I say the wrong things at the wrong times. And sometimes I need to realize that someone isn’t flirting with me, and actually just wants his goddamn pie.”
Dean laughed, a little unhinged, but what the hell, fuck it all. “I can roll with that,” he said. “How ‘bout a pizza, too?”
“But before I tell you who I am,” the man continued, “How about you go first? I’m sure I haven’t seen you around this castle before.”
Castiel did, and something the new Castiel did differently instead. He stopped feeling a little like throwing up (again) and a lot like screaming every time he saw another tiny white flower fall out of his mouth. He stopped thinking of Cas as
Now apprehensive, confused, and unnerved all at the same time, Castiel watched as the man bent over himself, hands on his knees as he caught his breath, laughs bursting out every now and again.
Castiel’s eyes had slipped closed during Dean’s mini-ramble, but they reopened as Dean stopped at the side of his bed. “That sounds wonderful,” he said, and smiled again. “Thank you for taking care of me, Dean.”
Sam stayed quiet, but in that loud way where Dean could tell that thoughts were churning in that whip-smart brain of his faster than he could verbalize. Sam was really smart. He could probably get into university. Dean was lucky if he could make it to a GED.
Meg looked at Castiel, and then sighed. Stepped closer. Took Castiel’s face in her hands, and then tipped in to kiss the side of his cheek, just missing his mouth.
“Anything weird happens,” she warned, already sounding like she was regretting it, “and I’m reporting this to the principal. God knows I’ve made enough mistakes trusting highschoolers in the past. Don’t let this be another.”
Dean’s smile skittered at that, his eyes disobeying him to dart up at the rearview mirror and catch the flutter-flash of a tan coat, because—
that and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but—if you really don’t want to go, just tell me honestly. I’ll figure something out, maybe go half and half or something, I’m sure Lisa wouldn’t mind—”
Dean sucked in another breath of stale hospital air and let it out in an exasperated huff. He sat back down in his chair and jiggled his leg and resisted the urge to run to the corner store and buy another pack of cigarettes.
“Do you work here often?” he asked, watching Castiel move around the space with a careless grace, following him to where a frame was already set up.
A few short seconds later, the elevator lurched gently beneath his feet, and the doors swung open. Castiel stepped out, and, feeling anticipation building with each step, made his way towards the lobby. Maybe they had blueberry—that was his favourite. The cafeteria cooks were incredible with their pastries, and Castiel could feel his mouth watering by the time he entered the lobby. Was it just his imagination, or could he actually smell the pie?
Carmen was perfect until her boyfriend came to the restaurant they were at and punched Dean so hard he chipped a tooth before dragging Carmen—not really a nurse, turns out, although a night-shift nurse was what she told the other one—out the door.
“Cancelled,” Dean breathed out harshly, hands on his knees as he fought to catch his breath. He put one hand on the other’s shoulder for balance and felt Cas shift with it, felt him shuffle in closer to press a hand to Dean’s back, rub out a cough from the dust-addled air.
He snatched it away as soon as he realized what he was doing. Left the room with a pounding heart, eyes tightly shut as he tried to go to sleep, suddenly glaringly aware of Dean in the other room, breathing, with a blanket tucked around him and the shadow of his eyelashes sharp on his face.
—and nearly fell over trying to get the coat off of him. “Yeah, of course, sorry, I forgot I was even wearing it.”
“Done?” Dean said, shifting just the fraction of an inch and wincing as pins and needles shoot up his shins.
Dean was watching Castiel instead. Maybe Castiel could let it go, but it gnawed at Dean like nothing ever had before. Who could affect Castiel this heavily, this much? (Stage two, heading to three.) The thought nagged at Dean's mind relentlessly, made him oddly irritated.
"Oh," Dean said, waiting for the flood of disappointment to hit him, but, surprisingly, all he felt was a bit of resignation. "Well, that sucks. I'm sorry."
(And then plane tickets and phone calls and facetimes, late nights, sore eyes, headaches, inside jokes and new people and new worries, never this difficult, never this much, all whispered through a speaker in the dark. Diplomas and mortgages. Chapels.)
“I dare you to save this for when we get back to the Bunker,” Sam said. “And to make a stop so I can buy earplugs.”
It was always just them. All the girls Dean went through, that disastrous date Castiel went on with the cute guy from the coffee shop in Sophomore years, Lisa, Meg—it was always just the two of them in the end.
Dean laughed weakly. Looked down. “M’not wearing any mascara,” he said, so obvious of a deflection that even Castiel could tell.
The man turned to peer at Castiel over his shoulder, and again was that infuriating smile. “I could have let you fall,” he said. “I didn’t, though.”
Dean blinked. No way. The kid was seven years old, for Christ’s sake. “You mean you can—see it? Orange?”
“Cas,” Dean said again, throat pinhole tight and trying to hide the desperation in his voice. “Pick one.”
Slowly, carefully, avoiding the icy patches, Dean drove to the middle of the road on the street near the local schools, where the lights were most impressive, all the parents striving to prove themselves better. It was cold, the heating turned to a low rumble. Dean could just see his breath. He ejected the tape cassette of slow rock, and sat as the silence slowly engulfed them both: the Impala, bathed in shimmering red and green and sparkling with snowflakes, and him sitting quietly in the centre of it all.
“—I actually prefer graphite,” Dean heard the tail end of his sentence while answering a guest question. “I find it to be much more forgiving when dealing with mistakes, which I make more than I’d like to admit—which is, that is to say, rather a lot.”
He came to a rather unsurprising conclusion. Castiel resolved to end this, and end it quickly. It was a crush, that was all. After all, Dean was funny, and thoughtful, and caring, and devastatingly sweet when you really knew him—and excruciatingly off limits. Castiel was going to finish coughing up whatever flowers had grown in his lungs already, and then he was going to brace himself and firmly, soundly get over it.
There was another student sitting on the bench waiting for a bus. They were engrossed in a book, so Dean made his way to sit next to them, politely sitting one seat away. From there, he found himself with his hands in his pockets and staring at nothing in particular. A few halfhearted attempts at recalling the lecture earlier that afternoon resulted in nothing but a growing headache and he quickly ditched the idea.
Dean found himself going back to it as he paced the room, just to see that sleepy small cat curled in the corner again, dozing without a care in the world.
Dean was racing Kevin and Charlie back from the fields, running as fast as he could, his bright red sneakers squishing against the damp grass. It had rained this morning, but stopped before recess—thank god. Dean
Dean’s hand seemed to linger on Castiel’s forehead for a touch too long, and then it smoothed upwards to comb deft fingers through Castiel’s hair, mussing it up intentionally. Castiel swatted it away absently, spurred by muscle memory. Dean chuckled.
“Of course,” Dean said, and was halfway down the hall before he realized that Castiel had changed the subject. Not that he wasn’t grateful, but it struck a wrong chord inside him in a way that made him feel uneasy for the whole trip to the receptionist and back.
“What do you think, then?” Castiel asked, voice growing inquisitive. “Honestly, not reciting off of a panel.”
“And you’re mine,” Castiel said, the words like razor blades on his tongue. He tasted the blood in the back of his throat and welcomed the metallic sting.
“Jesus,” he heard Dean murmur, alarmed. “It’s alright, that’s alright, Cas, you’ve got it, just keep breathing.”
The crying stopped for just a moment. It was like Cas was trying to catch his breath before starting up again. Dean frowned harder, and before he knew it his legs were moving, striding towards Cas as fast as he could.
Dean chewed on his lip. “A lotta reasons,” he finally said. “Dad might be sleeping. You don’t want to wake him up, right?”
Castiel swallowed, stared, and had a moment of blinding epiphany. “I’m a mess, aren’t I? The whole time during dinner, all I talked about—” He cut off in a gasping inhale and felt shame, hot and heavy, on his eyelids. “I’m so sorry I put you through this.”
“Isobel has to eat dinner, too,” Dean tried to reason. “You don’t want her to be hungry, don’t you?”
Dean blinked at the non-sequitur. We don’t have enough money for Lucky Charms, he thought. “I’ll buy more tomorrow,” he said.
“Fine,” he said, and Dean whooped, loud and joyful. “But I’m getting first choice for movies and snacks for the next month.”
“Nothing,” the nurse said. The tag on her chest marked her as a volunteer; pre-med, maybe. “His vitals were all excellent. There were no signs of concern or resurgence.”
Castiel felt heat flush all the way from his head to his toes. He took a few steps back, hasty, his mind in a whir and unable to process, clicking all the way back to a few minutes ago, an hour ago, flicking through memories fast as a racehorse.
Lisa made Dean promise to call her when she was in Princeton and Dean promised, and never spoke to her again.
One of Castiel’s earliest memories was of her, smiling, eyes warm and cornflower blue. They were sparkling in some way that wasn’t quite like the shimmering plush of the moon and the stars dangling from his crib. Castiel giggled; snatched at them with a chubby fist, and nearly poked his mother in the eye.
