Dean had stopped being a normal human when he was four years old. He was never a child, never a teenager. Always the soldier. Not only because he was forced to be. But because he couldn’t live with what might happen to his loved ones if he wasn’t.
The lightbulbs gave a sudden burst of light, and the bedside lamp broke into pieces, scattering to the floor. They both stared at the now empty spot, wide eyed and out of breath. Dean looked down at the Angel, one eyebrow raised. “That you?”
Castiel actually blushed at this. “I have not told him yet. For some reason, having this conversation with Jack feels…”
Dean started to leave but was stopped by his father’s quiet voice. “I know I was hard on you. On both of you. But especially you, Dean. All the things that you and Sam have hunted since my death, are so much bigger than I ever imagined. I’m sorry that you got mixed up in all that.” John looked up at his son’s back. “I am so proud of you. And all I want is for you to be happy. If… If you want to do this… I won’t stop you. And I will help you in any way I can. I’m just… I don’t want to lose you again.”
More mumbling and broken voices. Dean closed his eyes and tried focusing inwards instead of on the confusing world around him. But his insides were no less confusing. It was almost as if he could feel the blood as it ran through his veins. And it was running fast, everywhere. But the noise of it slowly faded in time with his slowing pulse.
“That was the easy part.” Jack stated apologetically. “I need you to stand for the next part.”
And here he was now. Looking at his little brother for permission to do what would grant him peace. Because he knew his decision would disappoint his family. But if his little brother would be okay… then everything would be okay.
Dean continued. “We went on a few small hunts. Guess we couldn’t just quit from one day to the next. But things seemed to slow down when Jack took over. We had whole days as civilians. Finally went to see the Grand Canyon, and - Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Dude!” Dean put a hand on Castiel’s arm, stopping to face the Angel, eyes even brighter than when talking about Miracle. “We went to a pie festival!”
“Do you really need the spirits of the Demons and Angels to survive?” Jack continued, realising that they knew so little about this ancient entity. It did not seem lonely, but it had been alone for so long, probably never learning how to deal civilly with other beings.
With a snap of fingers, the wooden floor under their feet was replaced by asphalt.
Dean had not known how to answer his father. He was still not used to receiving praise from the man. And he was even less used to his father yielding so easily, actually allowing Dean to make his own choices. Maybe his dad had finally found some peace in Heaven. Maybe dying had cured him from some of his obsession.
Dean registered the bricks cracking behind him. He was thankful that he was no longer human, or his bones would most likely have received the same treatment.
“What happens now?” John had once again been quiet for most of their discussions. He was agitated. It might not be visible to people who didn’t know him, but the way he was rubbing his hands together and the slight growl to his voice, spoke volumes to Sam and Dean.
“That’s alright.” Dean answered with a smile. “Would you like to stay? I mean… Just to talk and stuff… Well, not
That left Castiel and Dean looking at each other. For all the times that Dean had imagined hugging the Angel again, kissing him again, they were now just staring awkwardly at each other. Dean finally grabbed Castiel’s arm and dragged him a bit away from the crowd, who were luckily kept occupied by Jack’s enthusiasm for seeing everyone again.
“They don’t weigh anything.” Dean tried stretching them, moving them around with his shoulder blades. He couldn’t feel if they moved above or through the bed. It was as if the wings and the room were two different things, existing at the same time but not really.
“Oh God, do we have to soundproof your room now?” Dean barely ducked the tea cosy that Sam deftly aimed at his head.
“No! NO! Go back to sleep! SLEEP! SLEEP!” The Empty started yelling at the appearing shapes. When they kept rising, it once again turned back to Jack. “Stop the noise! STOP! STOP! You are waking them!”
“Hello Dean.” Castiel straightened and started rambling off what was obviously a practised speech. “I’m sorry that you had to find out like this. It was never my intention to drag you in to this mess. I explicitly asked Jack not to-“
Both men huffed nervous laughter and seemed to avoid eye contact while stealing nervous glances at the other.
“We don’t know for sure. As you said, we are making this up as we go.”
“Yeah… Right…” Dean smiled tightly. He had completely forgotten about that. They were done. He was done. He could go back to being… dead.
“I’m so happy to see you.” Jack refused to let go, even though Dean tried to tap him out multiple times. Not until Mary walked forward, did the Deity change his focus and hug her instead.
Bobby raised an eyebrow at him. “I’ve got eyes, you know.”
Castiel studied the man next to him, but all he saw was nervous determination. “So, what are your questions?”
Without further ado - Please enjoy!
“Hey.” Sam unexpectedly dropped down next to him, and he jumped in his seat in surprise. Dean had been sitting alone on a tree log outside their house, staring into the wilderness surrounding them, caught up in his own thoughts. He was damn lucky they were already dead, or he might have had a heart attack. Sam eyed him with a frown. “Are you okay?”
“Exactly. We think that it might be because the Archangels were created in the Empty. God’s first creations, shaped from the energy in the void. For the same reason, we think that the Archangels’ abilities could extent to creations of the Empty. They are made of the same energy. But we are no longer in the void. We don’t have access to the same building stones. After the Big Bang, God had plenty of new energy sources for the Seraphim and other Angels. But not the right sources for more Archangels since he left the Empty.” Jack explained. “If I were to attempt to create a new Archangel or bring one back from the Empty, I would have to attempt to tap into the void. But as you can guess, the Empty is not really compliant right now. For the same reason, we hope that the Empty has not guarded itself and its creations against Archangels, because it is impossible for me to remake them.”
A moment of silence followed while everyone pondered this new information.
To the humans, he looked like himself. He was out of breath, fighting the remnants of pain that coursed through his body.
“Right now, I have to send everyone to the other side of the Gate to push the Empty back. So, save your domestic fighting till later.” Jack growled frustratedly at his fathers. In the same motion, he lifted an Archangel blade towards Dean. “I don’t think this will work on them. None of the Angel blades do. But it can hold them back if you cut of a leg here and there.” When Dean accepted the blade, Jack stepped away again to prepare to send all the Angels away.
“I, er… I… love him… And we, er…” The words were almost inaudible, but the smile on Dean’s face was accompanied by a pink tint to his cheeks.
The last question was aimed at Sam, a warning that he better have burned and salted Dean’s body instead of being sentimental about it like when Dean went to Hell. Sam quickly nodded. “Yes, I burned it!” The pain in Sam’s voice left no room for discussion.
Castiel relaxed with the touch. If Dean could change the subject when uncomfortable, so could he. “How do you like New Heaven?”
. Well, that was not true, but he had never dared to dream that it might actually come true.
Jack stepped forward, putting his hand on the door. The grace reacted to his touch and seemed to strengthen underneath him. The quakes subsided a bit. When he returned to Dean and Castiel, his eyes were crinkled with worry. “The Empty is much stronger this time. The souls from Earth must be strengthening it. It is probably very irritated with us killing its Reapers.”
The grip around the Demon’s feet loosened, and it stumbled forward. It quickly turned around and ran to attack the group of humans. But it was stopped by an invisible wall. It growled in frustration.
Castiel smiled. As if he could forget. He recognised the special mixture of humour and insecurity in the words that very much characterised Dean.
The Reaper looked at the wall, before quickly looking back at Dean again. “Thank you.”
“Yes, Dean. I very much want to be with you.” Castiel answered with a small smile. “And I agree to the small steps.”
“Then we’ll make it up as we go.” Castiel supplied with a sad yet nostalgic smile which Dean reciprocated. The smiles quickly disappeared again and Castiel looked at Jack. “But let’s at least wait until tomorrow. We can still look through the library. And Dean, though I know you are very stubborn, I still urge you to rethink this.”
When their lips met, they both hesitated for a moment, just touching lightly. It felt surreal. And yet it felt as if it had been a long time coming. And it felt right.
They still went to visit the family regularly. The deal with the Empty went smoothly, giving them more free time than what Castiel had ever had before. They had long evenings under the starry skies of Heaven, all-night parties at the Roadhouse and long, languid mornings in bed.
so much that it sent him back’. So, what if the opposite of the Empty isn’t ‘something’? What if it’s life?” Blank eyes turned confused instead and Sam rolled his eyes at his slow audience. “Think about it! Before God and Amara, there was nothing. When God and Amara appeared, they created life and left. Since then, all the Empty has known has been the dead spirits of celestial beings.”
Dean returned the hug. “Hey kid.”
It was odd. Death had always been an unwanted, devastating life event. But now, it almost seemed better than living. They knew that the people they missed would one day join them, that they would see them again, which eliminated the threat of an eternal goodbye. Of course, the living didn’t know that. For them, death was still the potentially finally goodbye to their loved ones.
“If you’re about to give me ‘the speech’, don’t bother.” The hunter smiled back.
Thinking about it… It kinda felt like the Mark of Cain. A pulsing power running through him. But it didn’t make him want to kill anyone. It was… neutral. It was his choice how he wanted to use it.

The energy burst, slamming everyone to the wall behind them. For a moment, everything was beyond white, beyond light.
Chapter 7:
Dean smiled against him and withdrew just an inch. “Yeah. It’s just been a while since I’ve done this. Been with someone where it wasn’t just about sex.”
Dean’s body.
“Please…” It was more breath than voice.
Before Dean could continue, he was interrupted by that very same little brother that he all those years ago had stuttered some half-bad sex advice to. “Are you two coming or what?”
Castiel told him that he could move into a heavenly room of his own and decorate it however he liked. “You wanted to move out from your parents’ house. This is probably not what you had in mind, but none the less, it will be your own.” Castiel blushed and avoided eye contact when he continued. “Or… you could move in with me. If you want to. I mean… We don’t really need a place to sleep, but a place to rest is nice. A place to just be… us.”
Castiel and Jack said quick, awkward goodbyes, and Mary assured them that they were always welcome to come back. But right now, they just needed time to let it all sink in.
“No.” Dean interrupted quietly. “I’ll talk to him.”
Dean winced internally at the pain still audible in Sam’s voice after all these years. When they had discovered that he had Demon blood in him, he had felt hunted for how he was born, despite it being of no fault of his. He wasn’t even born like that… but he had felt like it. Hell, Dean had even told him that if he didn’t know him, he would have wanted to hunt him. Those words made his throat burn, even so many years later. Dean swallowed. “You’re right. But we can’t risk the whole freaking universe for this. So, what do we do?”
“The Empty existed before even God. It is connected to the primordial forces of creation.” Castiel looked smaller than a child, shoulders heavy with guilt. This was all because of him, because he was brought back to life. “The only reason that it hasn’t been active before is probably because it has been left alone to sleep.”
Chapter 8:
“Yeah.” Jack smiled. “I’ve turned other humans into Angels. Only if they wanted to, of course. They have to be willing to serve. And it turns out that a lot of previous soldiers and police officers and similar spirits find it difficult to be at peace. They need a purpose in order to rest. Maybe you need the same thing? And even though some of the old Archangels might return once weighed or I might be able to create new Archangels now that we have a deal with the Empty, I don’t want to push my luck yet. It would be reassuring to have you on the team.”
“Never mind.” Dean shook his head. He caught sight of his body on the ground behind them, bringing him back to the real reason they were here.  “So, what do you need me to do.”
“Actually, you have a choice in that matter.” Jack said with a secretive smile. “I can cut the grace from your being and once again separate your soul from your body. You can go back to your afterlife just like before…”
He stood by his words and his feelings remained the same. But there had been something safe in knowing that he could profess his love without receiving an answer. In giving without waiting to receive. Being, not having. And not losing.
“Taken care of?” Castiel looked around but didn’t see anything. He guessed that he shouldn’t be surprised. If the Empty Reaper left a body, it would most likely still be invisible to him.
Dean couldn’t help a yawn as the events of the night crept up on him. It was just so relaxing lying here with Cas. “Don’t worry, Cas. Its fine, really. I’m just happy to be here with the family. And you.”
“Where did it go?” The Reaper turned and asked Castiel.
“Your father?” John asked, looking between the Angel and Jack. “An Angel is the father of… God?”
“Yes... Because it worked Dean. You’re… You’re an Angel now.” Cas couldn’t help the disbelieving smile that crept over his face. He couldn’t believe it. The hunter shined with the grace of an Archangel. It was beautiful, beyond what he could have imagined.
Castiel turned to look up at the hunter, still trying to catch his breath. “My apologies.”
“Only one?” Dean interjected with disbelief.
“And what, dad?” Dean cut in, feeling that old, lifelong anger taking hold. “Just ignore all the bad shit going on around us? Have a cold beer while we ignore every suspicious death we hear about, knowing that we could stop it? How exactly did you think it was going to play out, huh?” Dean didn’t allow his dad to answer. “This is what you trained us for, dad! All our lives. I didn’t even finish school ‘cause I was out there hunting monsters. What the hell was I going to fall back on? Sam, sure, he would have landed on his feet. He almost made it out until I pulled him back in. That’s on me.” Dean took a breath and continued quieter but more insistently. “Saving people. Hunting things. Family first. That is all I know. That is what you’ve drilled into my head since mom died. And right now, Cas and Jack need our help. So, you can disagree all you want. But I’m not going to just sit back and watch them die if I can do something about it.”
Since Jack brought him back, he had been busy with assisting in recreating Heaven in his son’s image. He had helped reassuring the other Angels that their new God and the New Heaven was for the better. The Angels recognised Jack’s power, but he was – or used to be – a Nephilim. And son of Lucifer.
“But not for the reasons you think.” Castiel immediately looked up as the hunter continued. “I didn’t love you like that because of anything to do with you, Cas. It had nothing to do with you. I… I guess, I never thought about the possibility. Like, at all. I think… I kinda gave up on the whole love thing a long time ago. After Lisa, it just seemed like more of a burden than anything else. So, I stopped looking. Stopped thinking about anyone like that.”
They didn’t get to sneak out in peace as Sam called after them. “Remember what you said about soundproof bedrooms?”
Castiel sighed. He had so many things he wanted to say to that.
“No. But I like it.” Mary smiled and absently stirred the food. “You know, this is what I wanted. The life I wanted for John and my kids. It makes me happy to finally live that dream.”
“Huh…” Was all Dean could answer. “Is that why everyone is shining?”
Eileen looked fondly up at Sam, sending him a wink. “Hopefully not all the details.”
He would have needed someone who actually understood him. Someone who could not let anyone else get hurt either. Someone… A hunter, like himself. Like Sam had found in Eileen. Or a soldier.
“Hell no.” Dean growled at the manic Jack figure.
Dean swallowed. “Always, Cas. You’re…” He cut himself off. This was the part where he almost fell into old habits.
Another Empty Reaper lashed at them, and Dean made quick work of it. But the blast was much smaller than the previous. He was clearly running low of energy. Looking around, all Angels looked to be in the same state. Wounded, loosing energy, quickly tiring because they had so few means to slow their enemy, and the Empty Reapers regenerated too quickly when Dean was the only one who could actually kill them.
“Keep looking for something that could help us win.” Jack pleaded. With a final nod to both Sam and Bobby, he snapped his fingers, sending himself and the two Angels to the very front door of Heaven.
“Where?” Dean turned away from his adventures in decorating.
Sam huffed out the breath he had been holding as his own smile broke free. He put his arm around Dean’s shoulders, reassuring and grounding. “Dean. This is a good thing. A really, really good thing.”
Castiel froze, arms still circled around Dean, body going rigid in disbelief. For a long moment, they just stood there while Dean slowly stopped crying.
First I have listed all the amazing songs that have inspired the titles of the chapters in this fic and then I have a long rambling with some of my thoughts behind his fic.
“Huh.” Castiel looked at the wall, appearing normal to him. He then turned back to Dean and smiled. “You did it.”
“You might have a point.” Castiel frowned. “It was very adamant about wanting silence and going back to sleep.”
Castiel was always comfortable, especially in his trench coat. Why did no one seem to understand that? He rose from the bed and looked at Dean. The hunter had dropped his boots and flannel, only wearing his socks, jeans, and black T-shirt. Castiel decided to dress down accordingly, removing his trench coat, blazer, tie, and shoes.
Somewhere music started playing, Bad Company filling the air. Judging by the enthusiastic ‘Rock on!’ that followed, it must have been Ash who had brought a boosted ghetto blaster.
“Something…?” Sam prompted, bending forward on the log, trying to catch Dean’s eye.
“Or?” Dean prompted when Jack didn’t continue.
The black figures around them slowly merged back into the floor. Looking at the Empty, it seemed to be using a lot of energy to put them down to sleep again.
“’By what it is not’?” Castiel parroted with a frown. Sam nodded.
And then he walked out the backdoor.
He received a heavily thrown couch pillow to his head in answer.
“No. They are made of pure grace.” Castiel explained. He couldn’t help but smile at the almost juvenile way that Dean was testing his new appendages.
“You collected them on Earth?” Dean looked down at the grace shining into the wound in his side, erasing cut, blood, and all.
Castiel’s smile turned sad. “I’m sorry, but I didn’t hear you. Prayers do not reach the Empty, and Jack has decided to be less hands-on, including shutting down communication between Heaven and Earth. For now, at least.”
“We’ve just received word that an Empty Reaper has appeared.” Jack sounded tired and irritated.
-.-.-.-
The atmosphere was heavy, the two of them just looking at each other. Too many times had they lost each other. Van Nuys, the Leviathan, Purgatory… Mark of Cain, Rocky Mountain National Park, Michael…
“Trial by fire? Because we haven’t been reckless enough already?” Sam raised a disapproving eyebrow.
What if Cas had told him earlier, or in a non-life-or-dead situation, what would he have done? Probably laughed it off to begin with. He would have pushed Cas away, been an undesirable ass. Before Cas’ sacrifice, he would probably not have been able to accept anyone’s love. He had long ago given up on that. After Lisa… Hunting and love just didn’t go hand-in-hand. But now? He could still not make himself say that he was actually worthy of this kind of love, or any kind really. But he could admit that he wanted it. And looking back, he could see how happy he had been with Cas. How they easily laughed together, how exciting it had been to introduce the Angel to the world of man. How he had often admitted things to Cas that he could never share with Sam or anyone else. But was it enough? It was hard feeling in love with someone when he had not been open to the idea at the time when he had the chance.
The Empty started rubbing its hands as it considered Jack’s suggestion. Jack looked back at his fathers to see if his suggestion was acceptable to them as well. Both Sam and Castiel nodded. Dean shrugged. He might be a temporary Angel, but he wouldn’t mind letting the Demons experience a little hell after they died.
“Yes.” Castiel answered, not meeting Dean’s eye. It was not like he was completely inexperienced anymore, but for some reason this felt different than with April. It felt important. He quickly added; “If you-“
“But who will decide. If you decide, you will take the spirit. If I decide, I will take the spirit.” The Empty finally spoke.
Chapter 19:
Castiel could take it no longer. We closed the gap between them and hugged Dean tightly. Dean finally let go and sobbed into the trench coat clad shoulder.
want? Really, truly want?”
The black mass didn’t seem to take Dean’s attack lightly. Before Dean could try to gather his control, it shot out its arm, sending out a black gooey stream that hit Dean right in the chest. It swung him back against the brick wall.
Dean stared at them dumbfounded. “But I heard you.”
Sam left with a grin. Dean buried his blushing head in his hands.
“Nah…” Dean tried to sound casual, though he was a little bit angry with his dad for kicking out what he considered just as much family as his blood relatives. “They know it’s a tough subject. But they need our help, dad. I’m not saying that this Archangel thing is the right thing to do, but they are my family. And I’m not just going to turn my back on them. And I’m pretty damn sure Sam feels the same way.”
“Exactly.” Sam said enthusiastically, but his face quickly fell. “I just don’t know what to do with it.”
Jack slowly stepped forward towards the Empty. It looked at him as if waiting for him to attack. “I am sorry that I have not shown you any kindness before. I guess I was too scared of you to consider what you might want. But I really just want for us to live in peace.” Jack stretched out his hand. “Will you accept my proposal?”
have too little faith in yourself.”
“Alright.” Dean answered truthfully. “A bit strange, but… alright.”
Every human in the room sharply turned their head to Jack with a look of disbelief before turning to Castiel, eyes wide and curious as to how the Angel was going to answer.
Castiel smiled and finally relaxed. “Yes, he will.”
Castiel raised a hand and put it on Dean’s arm reassuringly. “I know your childhood was anything but easy. But I have never doubted that your father loves you and Sam very much.”
“I prayed to you.” The words suddenly fell from his lips. He knew that Castiel would understand him
Dean nodded and clapped his hands together. “Sounds like a plan. Let’s do it.”
Dean’s musings were interrupted by the walking mountain that he called his brother, bursting through his bedroom door. “Get up, sleeping beauty. We are going to see Ellen and Jo.”
“Really?” Castiel frowned. “I admit to not knowing your father very well, but I would have guessed that he would not easily change his mind?”
The Winchesters were about to sit down for dinner when there was a knock on the door.
Dean frowned, looking back at Castiel who looked puzzled. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“So, what now?” Dean asked looking around at everyone. “We go find some Empty Reapers?”
When Jack didn’t continue immediately, Dean barked. “What?”
“No. Well, yes. I just… I don’t know how to respond, you know? I don’t know… what you expect of me…” Dean had rarely felt as vulnerable as right now. This. This was the essence of so many of his doubts about him and Cas. The Angel had so often complimented him, told him about what a good man he was. In return, Dean had slapped him on the shoulder and, on a good day, said ‘thanks buddy’. Dean had said ‘I need you’ or ‘we’re family’. Though these things meant a lot, it was not as eloquent or personal as what Cas always told him.

“Yes, that was quite an energy discharge.” Castiel studied the hunter with worried eyes.
/ ‘I Want You Anyway’ by Jon McLaughlin
“What’s a little partying between friends?” Dean shrugged.
Dean held on even tighter, willing the tears not to fall at the sound of Castiel’s voice right next to his ear. Everything was good. Cas was alive.
Dean was about to argue, but one look at Sam told him that he would not let this go. “Fine.”
Dean guided Cas to lie down on the bed and started unbuckling his belt while placing wet kisses on his chest and stomach. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so present during sex. He had always enjoyed sex. Done everything he could to make it good for his companion for the night. But it was often rushed, a chase for the high. A way to forget about all the bad in his life. A slightly healthier alternative to alcohol.
“Sorry sweetheart. It’s just you and me.” Dean stepped forward with more confidence than he felt.
He sat on something soft. He looked down. His bedsheets. Oh, it was his own bed.
“That doesn’t sound very comforting.” John looked at Dean at this statement.
“Yes, they always seem to be the exception that proves the rule.” Castiel smiled. He then remembered that he had been interrupted quite unexpectedly - and unwantedly – so he changed the subject. “Why did you call me?”
“Well, since I started creating new Angels, I have contemplated creating Archangels as well, or maybe ‘upgrading’ some of the Seraphim. But I have not been able to… crack the code, you could say.” Jack sighed.
The Demon had stopped laughing, cowering on the floor to avoid the blast. He could see how the demonic energy was torn and flayed.
“Well, I wasn’t sure he would show.” Dean admitted shyly.
Castiel sighed against Dean’s arm, a breath of hot air warming the spot-on Dean’s shirt. “The truth is, that I was never very proficient in hand-to-hand combat. Physical combat, anyway. I am much more proficient in controlling and using my grace. For most of my life that was enough. I have been non-corporal for millennia, after all. Against normal Demons my… lack of skill is not an issue, but Jack was certainly not holding back with his choice of opponent.”
“I know, mom.” Dean smiled reassuringly. “But we might have a chance to stop this before it gets completely out of hand. Before anyone gets hurt.” Dean glanced at Cas before he continued. “I’ll be honest; this is not something I want to do. Just the thought of me being an Angel… is insane. I mean, I’m the last person-“ Before Dean could continue, Cas kicked him underneath the table, stopping his self-deprecating ramble. Dean avoided Cas’ eye and cleared his throat before continuing. “But… if I can do anything to keep you safe, all of you, then I’ll do it. Even if it means that I have to strap on some wings. At least this time, it will only be me in my body.”
Castiel squatted down in front of him, holding his hands. “Dean. How are you feeling?”
“That wasn’t my vessel’s voice, Dean. That was my true voice.”
“What are you doing!?” The Reaper called from the corner.
“That sounds awesome.” Jack smiled. “It would be great to see them again, and Mary.”
Jack once again took over. “As I said, the Empty was not particularly happy with me pulling Castiel out... again. At first, it tried to attack Heaven again. But we anticipated the attack and warded Heaven in the same manner as we have Earth, making it so that the Empty cannot enter unless summoned. Adding the new Angels to the equation, Heaven stands much stronger than it did the last time the Empty attacked.” Jack swallowed before he continued. “But, then the Empty became… creative. It created what we call Empty Reapers.”
Eileen was greeted into the hunter family with yet another party at the Roadhouse. Everyone was happy to meet her, and to remind Sam of just how lucky he had been to marry a woman like her.
Jack smiled. “Yes. The Angels felt like Chuck left them, never giving them any answers or reasoning behind his actions. I wanted to do things differently. So, we have an information meeting every morning where I relay important messages.”
Dean turned around, looking for a beige trench coat. The seconds ticked by, feeling like hours. Sam saw the disappointed on his brother’s face when no Angel popped in.
Dean looked at Sam, expecting him to go away, give him some space, but his idiot kid brother stayed where he was. Instead, Dean stood and walked away a few paces, scowling back at his brother to make sure he stayed sitting on the log. Then he nervously wetted his lips. “Hey… Cas. Uhm, I know you’re probably busy, but, er… We talked about you and Jack coming by for dinner, and if you are still up for it, you could come by around seven-ish?…” Dean waited a second, holding his breath for an answer. Then he added; “Cas, no matter what, just give me a sign that you’re okay. That
When Jack had started creating new Angels, the first Angels had been ecstatic to welcome their new brothers and sisters. However, Jack had created them in the spirit of his fathers, giving them free will. Even though the original Angels were free to act as they pleased under Jack’s realm, it still created some friction between the old and the new, as the original Angels were still adjusting to the concept of free will. But the new Angels were as kind as their creator, soon gaining the acceptance of the original Angels.
Once everyone was seated around the table, Jack went through the books that he had brought. Despite at least twenty-five different books of considerable volume, they pretty much all said the same thing about the Empty; It is void, it is nothing, it is emptiness, it is dark. The first existence known. A being of the most primal of forces. It was forced to its own little corner of the universe once God and The Darkness entered, and God started creation.
Castiel and Jack joined in the eating. They probably didn’t have to, but they eagerly dug in. Maybe Jack had changed their ability to taste and enjoy simple pleasures? Well, Jack had always enjoyed food. It would be just like him to share the experience with everyone else.
A laughter rolled from one group of hunters. Jodi bullied Bobby into a dance, earning more laughter. Sam’s laughter was quickly quenched when Eileen dragged him onto the improvised dance floor as well. More people joined the gathering, a circle forming around the dancing couples.
“We need to defend Heaven.” Castiel stated. “The Seraphim may not be able to harm the Empty, but we can keep it away from the Gate.”
Dean opened and closed his mouth a couple of times before landing on: “So, ‘even out’, does that mean, like, ‘kill’? Can we kill the Empty by filling the void? I thought we talked about that and agreed that it was a bad idea?”
But now, they didn’t rush. They bathed in the warmth of each other, in the small urgent sounds and hitched breaths. In every careful touch. Dean couldn’t remember anyone ever touching him like this. Like he was fragile. No, not fragile. Valuable. Looking at Castiel, the Angel seemed to be in awe.
It took a long while before Dean pulled back. He kept the Angel at arm’s length, hands still holding on to his shoulders, not willing to let him go yet. But things were getting awkward. Words were getting stuck in his throat. He opened his mouth to speak, just to shut it again when what he was about to say didn’t feel adequate.
Castiel was pushed back by the power exploding from the middle of the room. He faintly registered that the humans next to him dropped to their knees and covered their eyes. His mind filled with Dean’s outward screams and inward prayers.
Dean stepped up to his brother, not touching – and keeping a reasonable social distance – but looking at him with all the faith that he felt for his little brother. “We’ll figure this out, okay? I know you. There’s nothing you can’t crack.”
Dean once again shuffled a bit closer, pushing his nose against Castiel’s collarbone. For a man who were so strict about personal space when awake, he had no boundaries when asleep. It was nice.
When Dean let out an unwilling growl, he forced himself to back away. He took a few heavy breaths, trying to gather himself. He couldn’t remember what he had been worried about anymore. Why he had thought that being with Cas might not work. It was clearly
“Well, good morning to you too.” Sam’s smile could not get any wider. “And good morning, Cas.”
“Uhm…” Jack looked back at Dean. His facial expression made it clear that he had not thought this far ahead. Of course, the Angels would sense the grace of an Archangel among them. The power must have rippled through Heaven. Jack seemed to make a quick decision. “Yes and no… I will inform you about the details at tomorrows information meeting. I promise. Until then, please return to your duties.”
The peace was abruptly broken by the bedroom door carefully creaking open, revealing the younger Winchester with a grin and a tall glass of water. Judging by the condensation on the glass, the water must have been freezing cold. For a fleeting moment, Castiel wondered what Sam was doing with this glass in Dean’s bedroom. He could not remember Sam ever bringing his older brother such a beverage before in the morning.
Dean tried to shake the ringing out of his head. “I’m coming too.”
“Dean.” Sam didn’t have to say more than that.
Sam saw right through him, and just clapped his shoulder with a smile and an exasperated headshake.
Dean swallowed and nodded his understanding. Well, he guessed that he understood what Castiel meant but how it was going to work in practice was still a bit foggy. Still, he remembered how Jack has wrestled with his powers when he was born, and how he had hurt people without meaning to. He wanted to avoid that at all costs.
Castiel rolled his eyes, and reluctantly reached out and grabbed Dean’s shoulder. There was no time for this kind of bickering. If he left Dean, he would surely try to use his wings and end up Jack- knows-where or worse, he could end up hurt.
“Yeah, but we found him right after…” Dean trailed off for a moment, clearing his throat. Castiel nodded in understanding. Dean still forced the words out. “Uhm… Right after you left. But before taking out Chuck. Seemed liked he had missed this one dog when deleting all living things on Earth. Turned out that he was just messing with us. Again. Giving us one small glimmer of hope before taking it away right in front of us. But the furball came back together with everyone else, so we adopted him. Called him Miracle.”
-stuff, but…” Dean ended with a frustrating growl, aimed at himself.
Dean caught Jack’s eye. “Information meeting?”
Castiel wanted to step forward to offer comfort, but he felt that the hunter needed the distance. So instead, he smiled and looked out at the horizon, the blue sky over dark green treetops. He didn’t know what to expect. For once, he found it hard to decipher Dean, all emotions masked by nerves. “Whatever you have to say, I will appreciate your honesty.”
But that’s not what Dean needed to hear. Of course, he valued Cas’ opinion, but… he had already made up his mind. He instinctively knew what felt right. So instead, he looked at Sam.
“Good. That’s good.”
But it was late. “Goodnight, Dean.”
There was an easy way to do that.
: Did a proofreading of this fic. It contained a lot more spelling errors than I feared. Sorry about that! Hopefully, I have cleared most of them now. No changes to the plot, but I have elaborated a little bit on some of the scenes and thoughts and feelings and dialogue here and there.
“How are you feeling, boy?” Bobby’s voice came from the back of the group.
The chaos disappeared. All Angels were suddenly back on the peaceful side of the Pearly Gate.
Dean looked at Castiel, who looked nervous and regretful, barely able to meet Dean’s eye. “Why do I sense a ‘but’ in there?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean thought he caught Cas squirming for a moment. It was probably nothing. He could ask about it later.
He felt drained when he stepped into his room. For a moment he had forgotten about his previous arrangement and was surprised to find the Angel waiting for him. The room was dark except for a single lit bedside lamp. The Angel stood dead still next to the bed, as if afraid to touch anything. Dean immediately smiled at the sight of him, though Castiel still looked apologetic. “Hey Cas.”
Dean shook his head disbelievingly. “Surprisingly well. Gave him a piece of my mind, I guess. Told him that he could disagree all he wanted, but that Sam and I were going to help you and Jack. ‘Cause you’re family. And… I think he’ll come around.”
/ ‘Far from Home’ by Five Finger Death Punch
“Yeah, he told us.” Dean grumbled. He couldn’t be angry with Jack for actually granting them free will. But damnit, he could have let them know that Cas was alright. Have let them talk to him.
What he hadn’t foreseen was that the Demon skated right to were Castiel was standing. It quickly got back to its feet and lashed at the Angel. Castiel blocked it but the Demon quickly followed with another blow that hit its target, forcefully throwing the Angel off his balance.
Castiel watched Dean throughout the night. It was rare that Jack didn’t call on him for such long periods of time. He started to wonder if his son had figured out where he was. It made him a bit uneasy. Dean had tried to explain to him that it was natural to feel this way when it came to family, that talking about relationships and sex with Sam was also awkward for him. But why was that when it was so natural?
Dean kissed the top of the Angel’s head, where Castiel was leaning against his shoulder. It was a silent ‘thank you’. He could feel Castiel smile against his arm. The mentioning of Castiel’s previous training made Dean think. “Don’t take this the wrong way. But how did the Demon get the drop on you? You’re back on full Angel power, right?”
-.-.-.-
Castiel looked down at the bed. “It has never been done before, so we can’t be sure. But our best guess for a worst-case scenario is that the power of the grace would implode, and you would disappear from existence.” Castiel looked back up at Dean. “And that is why this is not an option. It is not only your father who is afraid of losing you.”
“Hey you.” Dean smiled with relief.
Dean sat on the bed. He patted the spot next to him, and Castiel carefully sat down on the appointed spot. Dean looked so lost, letting his guard down in the safety of his room, in the company of only his Angel, so Castiel took pity on him. Dean had asked him to stay with him, to answer whatever questions he might have, not to chastise him. Given the choice, would he not make the same sacrifice for Dean? In a heartbeat.
“Between family.” Sam corrected, lightly shoving at his brother, earning him a smile.
He huffed a laughter at the typical angelic response. “Yeah, I did… I guess I just expected that you would let me know if you’d be coming or not. Didn’t think you would just… pop in.”
But Castiel cut him off, lights in the dining room flickering from the wrath beneath his short, simple words. “Jack.
“Angels receive millennia of fight training. We don’t have time for that.” Castiel frowned.
“A good idea?” Sam already knew that smile, but he had to ask.
Castiel nodded as much as was possible without breaking the connection with Dean. He was positively surprised by the small, affectionate gestures Dean had already given. Initiating their first kiss, accepting Castiel initiating their second kiss, allowing Castiel to hold his hand, and just now kissing him again. Yes, he had probably intended for it to shut Castiel up, but that was okay. He could feel Dean resting in himself in a way he had not before. Still, he could also feel the hunter holding himself back, taking it slow as earlier agreed. Castiel respected that… but he wanted more. More closeness, more time together, more... everything.
They entered what mostly resembled a warehouse building. If said warehouse was white,  brand new and clean. Jack gestured at the empty room; “This is one of our training grounds.”
Castiel laughed heartedly as Dean in detail told him about the day at the festival. He could hear that it was not just about the pie – though Dean in detail rated each tasting that he had had –  but had also been a step towards normalcy. Civilian life, as Dean called it. Doing something normal together as brothers. A day without monsters and worries.
“It is not their fight!” Castiel growled in return.
Immediately, the mood seemed to change. Both Jack and Cas looked down at the table, smile and laughter gone.
Of all things, the first thing Dean’s mind registered was ‘
Dean tried to ignore the feeling that the room gave him and just focused on the new door that had popped up. “So, this is the door to Narnia, huh?”
This small noise was enough to wake the sleeping hunter, trained through a lifetime to react to even the smallest of sounds and changes around him. First, his eyes snapped open. In less than a second, he registered Castiel’s tense body and how his eyes were glued to the door, and then he reacted by quickly turning towards the door himself, one arm roaming under his pillow for a gun that was no longer there.
“Now, we need to build Angel Heaven. It’s going to take a little time. And then, we will call upon Anubis to judge the spirits in the Empty, and the spirits deserving of Heaven will be transferred.” Jack proudly stated.
Dean stepped towards the Angel, looking earnestly at him. “This is why I went through this whole thing to begin with. I need to go see if I can… at least do
“It looks like you give me no choice…” Jack slowly raised his hand and snapped his fingers.
, remember?”
“Once you learn to control your grace, healing will work just the same.” Castiel smiled confidently. He leant forward, clearly with the intention to give Dean a kiss, but he stopped before he reached his target. His face changed from smiling to serious. “Dean?”
“Come on, Empty.” Dean smirked. “You’ve been cooped up here for far too long. Live a little!”
“Your room?” Dean asked for confirmation, an eyebrow raised in question.
Castiel knew what it was about, and his heart sank with it.
“Cas, I trust you. And I trust Jack. I know he will do everything he can to keep me alive. I mean, dead.” Dean frowned at his own statement and corrected it. “To keep me existing. It’s fine.”
Chapter 9:
“How nice of it to notice me.” Dean winced again when Castiel prodded at the wound. He tried to distract himself and pointed at the small bookcase. “What’s with all the knick-knacks?”
“Full.” Dean stated the obvious with a shrug.
“That’s what we need to talk about.” Jack stated. “This war needs to end. The souls of Earth belong in Heaven.”
Jack, kind-hearted as he was, had refused to force the Angels to do anything. They were free to leave if they chose to, or to remain without assisting in the daily work of Heaven. But he had kindly asked them to assist in his work, had expressed how much he needed them, their experience, and their input. He truly was good and just, as God should be, and the Angels responded well to that. Eventually, all Angels joined them.
Castiel raised his head, looking offended that his head’s peaceful resting place was shaking beneath him, even if it was from joy. “What’s so funny?”
“Don’t, Cas.” Dean answered with a small smile. When Cas was about to argue, Dean cut him off. “How much do you know about what happened with me and Sammy before the Angels came to Earth to bring about the Apocalypse?”
Dean stopped walking. Castiel stopped a step later, looking back at the hunter. “Cas…” Dean was fiddling nervously with his hands, looking up at Castiel for short moments before looking down, just to chastise himself for not looking straight at the Angel, then look back up.
Another issue for me was that I don’t think that Dean was in love with Castiel throughout the show. He loved him, yes, but he was not
“Yeah, that was amazing.” Dean ended dreamingly. He realised that they had started walking again.
Dean turned back to look at Jack, ready to make a sarcastic remark, but when he saw the expecting look on the kid’s face, Dean quickly changed it and awkwardly said. “That… sounds great, Jack. Good on you.” Sam nodded his agreement with a forced smile.
Human Heaven was not the only thing that had changed. The throne room was no longer a throne room, and it was no longer serene, cold, and white. It was now a circle of comfortable chairs, a warm, round wooden table in the middle. The walls were filled with bookshelves with old volumes of classical literature and tomes of long-lost history.
“Only have one.” Dean turned in his seat to better look at Cas. He suddenly felt nervous and a little shy. He looked down at his hands. “Uhm… This is not exactly how I imagined this. I… I know we talked about taking this slow. Because I needed time to, uhm…”
Dean looked at Castiel, who just nodded solemnly. Dean turned back to the Demon. “Bring it on.”
But then, he heard Dean pray to him. It was not unexpected, but Castiel had assumed that Dean would have wanted more time with everyone else before calling him. Yet, he was a bit relieved that Dean actively sought him out.
For a long time, Dean only felt the relief from the absence of pain. Something was ringing in his ears, but he didn’t really care. His nerves still felt as if on end, sensitive. But it was painless. It felt amazing.
Castiel leaned closer to Dean, offering comfort to the hunter as well as to himself. He felt Dean leaning into the touch. He knew that Dean was not only talking about his grace, but his previous experiences with the Mark of Cain. The Mark had truly fed on all the worst parts of Dean’s character. Enhancing his anger. His upbringing as nothing but a hunter, an instrument of death. The way that Dean saw himself as nothing but a killer. The grace did not work in the same way, but with the experience that Dean had just had, it must have felt like it. “Your wish to harm made your intensions muddled and impure. You just need to learn to control them. To focus on the purest form of your intention and embrace your grace. You have kept control of difficult situations all of your life. I am sure you will learn to control this as well.”
“Is everyone okay?” Dean finally had something to focus on, something not within himself. They had all seemed alright but-
“And we will keep it closed. Out graces will keep it strong. If you have a way to stop the attack, then go.” Camael stood strong. Angels gathered behind her, nodding their agreement.
Everyone ignored his false bravado, and Sam stepped forward and opened the door.
“Sam is right.” Castiel agreed. “No Angel who has performed his duty deserves to be stranded here.”
“Come on, Sammy. When have we ever worked with good ideas?” Dean turned to Jack. “We are going to need some transportation.”
Sam looked up at the confused faces of his peers.
“I’ll get it.” Sam jumped up from his seat. First, they just heard Sam’s steps moving towards the door, but as soon as the door handle turned, it was replaced by a loud, happy exclamation.
The Empty Reaper looked up at the Angels. Dean felt how it studied them. Then it stepped back, slowly moving away.
“We don’t know.” Castiel quickly answered before any sibling argument could break out. “We have theorised that they might be a natural evolution of whatever the primal force is. That would explain why they can partly manipulate the beings in the Empty but cannot control the being itself. They are only a small subpart of the void.”
Sam ignored him. “If nothing predates the Empty, then where did God and The Darkness come from? Did the Empty create them?”
“What’s going on?” Sam had run to his brother, holding his shoulder. Whatever happened, he couldn’t hear it.
The Empty Reaper was clearly visible to the Reaper, who desperately launched at the shadow with a small scythe. But the Empty Reaper just let the weapon hit and go right through it, leaving a rift in the blackness for a moment before closing again.
Tears started forming in Dean’s eyes again as he recalled all the emotions and feelings he had been analysing and deciphering over and over again, making it damn hard to focus on his words, when he also had to hold back the waterworks. “And then you were gone. And I didn’t know what to think. I was angry with you. Why would you throw something at me like that? Tell me, and then just leave me? And I felt sorry for you. Sorry, that you decided to fall for an idiot like me. Sorry, that I couldn’t give you what you deserved. You deserved so much better. You were always there for me when I needed you. You deserved to have that too. I… I wished you could have been happy. Before the whole Empty thing. I just wanted you to be happy. As happy as you made me. And…” Dean took a deep, shaking breath. “And that’s when I realised… That maybe I wouldn’t have minded… If we had been more. Just because I never dared thinking it, doesn’t mean it couldn’t have been something. I… I just know… I was always better when you were there, Cas, even when I was at my worst. You made me better.”
It was the party of a lifetime. Or deathtime? Is that a thing?
Eileen and Mary agreed to help as well. As everyone dug their noses into a book, Dean pulled Cas a bit to the side. “Cas, can we talk?” He didn’t wait for an answer but started walking towards the stairs. Cas quickly followed.
“Explains why you Angels are so uptight.” Dean smirked nervously.
After a moment, they pulled back and just looked at each other. Since they were caught in such a tender moment, Castiel decided to push Dean’s emotional side just a little bit. “I heard you talking to me in the alley when you were trying to wake me up. Some of it at least. The important bit.”
“You were wounded by a weapon created from the material of the Empty. To my knowledge, this is a first. They usually just push the Seraphs and Reapers away and take the soul. It clearly recognised you as a threat.” Castiel couldn’t keep out a bit of pride in his voice.
“Sam. You said you found something.” Castiel cut in, voice urgent with guilt from leaving his fellow Angels.
“Cas!” Dean pushed himself off the ground and tumbled to check on him. He had a bleeding wound where his head had met with the asphalt.
It was not the answer that the Angels had wanted to hear, but they nodded and slowly started dispersing down the hallway, but not without sending curious glances at the odd crowd behind their God.
For ten long seconds, they just stood there, looking at each other, a red tinge to both their faces. Castiel had never dared to think of Dean
“Dean, you haven’t mastered your grace yet. We can send a Seraph to deal with this incident.” Castiel looked at him pointedly.
Cas’ death had shaken him to his core in every way possible. Dean had always been thick-headed, but he was ashamed that it took his best friend’s ultimate sacrifice to finally make him listen to what the Angel said. Though it was the first time that Cas had told him that he loved him as more than family, the Angel had often told Dean how good and righteous he thought he was. Dean sometimes tried to take in Cas’ words, but it only lasted for about a tenth of a second before he remembered every terrible thing that he had ever done and then disregarded what Cas was saying with a laugh or a sarcastic remark. But he couldn’t do that now, not this time. Instead, he had honoured Cas’ words and done his best to live up to them. Be the man that the Angel had always believed him to be and, apparently, had loved.
“It should probably not become a habit, God and his Angels going to dinner with the inhabitants of Heaven.” Jack mused. “But I think we can make an exception for the Winchesters.”
Dean reciprocated but removed both the trench coat and blazer in one smooth movement. He then proceeded to remove the crooked tie, untying the knot, and sliding the tie slowly around the Angel’s neck. Castiel blinked at the movement. It was not the first time that his tie had been removed, but this time, it left tickling electricity in its way.
It finally hit Dean. He was the only one who could see the Empty Reaper right now. It must have hidden itself from the others when Cas arrived. Jack’s assumption had been right. Finally, something was going their way. He turned towards the solid shadow. “Hey! Ink spot! Get the hell away from them!”
Their first night was spent with only their parents. It was even better than the dinner they had shared during The Baozhu, with no deadline hanging over their heads where they would have to smash the dream. They talked, laughed, and cried all through the night, not going to bed until they had watched the sun rise together.
“Hello.” Jack greeted them with a quick wave and a small smile.
“How the hell did it do that?” Sam asked alarmed.
When Dean started talking about clowns, Sam cut him off. “Right, right, enough about that. What about you two…” He gestured at the celestial beings. “What have you been up to? How are things working with New Heaven?”
“Remove the Empty Reapers from existence?” Jack supplied with a shy, nervous smile. “I’m afraid not. Though I seem to have some limited abilities to affect the beings that end up in the Empty, like Castiel, it is still a force much older and more powerful than me. I have no power or control over the Empty itself, and not over its creations either. I guess the Empty and I are somewhat comparable to a human and an Angel. But in this scenario, I am the human.”
The Demon lashed out, but Dean easily avoided it. The Demon’s movements were easy to follow. He blocked a blow aimed at his head, barely feeling the impact on his arm. He followed through with a hit of his own and happily saw the Demon fall and skate across the floor at the impact. Oh, sweet revenge for all the times that had been him.
Dean had frozen when Castiel had gone rigid in his motion towards kissing the hunter again. He clearly feared that he had done something wrong, that Castiel regretted what they had just been doing. Castiel almost twisted his tongue in his hurry to explain what was actually going on. “Dean. It’s Jack. He’s calling for me.”
“And what about you, Cas?” Sam sat a bit restless in his seat. “I don’t know if I should ask, but… How are you even here? I mean, we’re really happy that you are here, but…”
“Awkward and embarrassing?” Dean supplied.
Dean let out a breath and kissed him gratefully. Cas always seemed to understand him, and he was overwhelmed by how much the Angel was willing to share with him. He got the feeling that Cas didn’t care one way or the other, but for their first time, this certainly made Dean feel a bit more on top. Pun intended. And Cas was probably right. He was back to full Angel strength, back to when Dean was the one getting hurt if he threw a punch at him.
“Uriel.” Dean choked out. At Castiel’s confused frown, Dean snaked his arms around him and held him close. He looked at his Angel with all the love he could muster in his amused state “Finally got my slice of full-on-grace angel food cake.”
He had to get his shit together before facing Sam.
“Seriously?” Dean asked.
/ ‘The Black Parade’ by My Chemical Romance
Okay. If he had to be honest with himself, he had been avoiding Dean. A little. Just a little.
Conversation revolved around old times. They ignored all the bad and focused on the fun and the quirky. Like the case with the rabbit foot, Sam’s, and Dean’s trip to a mental hospital, that time when fairy tales came to life and the case where a guy was killed by a freaking unicorn. The mood was warm and light, and the air filled with laughter.
For a moment, they just laid in silence. Castiel was watching Dean, and he knew that the hunter was not sleeping even though his eyes were closed. His breathing was relaxed, but not heavy with sleep.
Dean patted Sam’s shoulder.
“We need to talk.” Jack stated calmly.
“And that’s all thanks to you.” Dean interrupted seriously.
Castiel looked carefully at Sam. “Do you remember when I extracted Gadreel’s grace from you?” Sam nodded. As if he would ever forget. “In the same way, we believe that there might be leftover grace in the vessel of an Archangel.”
They entered a large room, just as white as the hallways. The uniform colour made it seem endless. In the middle, Jack stood, looking down at a body on the ground.
Dean smiled again. “It’s pretty good.”
The Demon finally acknowledged that escape was impossible. It turned around and stood tall to face its enemy. Its eyes turned black when summoning its demonic energies. It gave Dean a clearer view of the creature. It was all monster and darkness. No golden glow like what he could see when he looked at Sam and the others. “The poor bastard you’re possessing… He’s dead.”
disappointed. But he didn’t dare to call on the Angel again. He must be busy, running Heaven and all.
In case you want a bit of background for this story, here’s a few of my thoughts.
consider if it was even possible. Action before thinking. Castiel finally managed to answer; “No, there is no rule against it. Mainly because it has never been an issue before.”
“Of course. I will add a door in your room with access to our libraries. I just need to inform the Angels that you are allowed to enter, otherwise they might get cranky.” Jack answered. They got the feeling that ‘cranky’ was an understatement.
At that last statement, Dean finally looked up at him. “That’s not… We didn’t…”
So, I guess I just want to end this by sending a huge THANK YOU to a show that has followed me for literally half my life. It’s been such an amazing journey, and I’m going to miss it.
Dean barely registered what happened next. Maybe Cas zapped them somewhere. It didn’t feel as uncomfortable as when he was alive. Maybe this grace thing did have an upside after all.
The barrier breached.
Just like Dean had sensed Sam’s arrival, the rest of their family seemed to sense their approach. Their parents greeted them in front of their childhood home. It seemed misplaced out in the wilderness, and yet the surroundings fit so perfectly. None of them had ever wanted to return to Lawrence. They had avoided it like the plague. But the house, despite the bad memories it might contain, was still the closest thing to a home that all the Winchesters had ever known together. It was still
And now he was finally abroad, but still had a job to do. He only got a quick look up and down the street, seeing many colourful lights from shops and restaurants. The sky was almost pitch black, clearly late evening or night, but the air was hot and heavy. He suspected that he would have sweat through his clothes in less than two minutes, had he not been an Angel and now unaffected by such trifles.
He laid down on the bed, mirroring Dean’s posture, head propped up on his hand in a similar manner. Dean smiled at him and Castiel smiled back. This was nice. Intimate in a new way. It made him feel as if he could dare broach a sensitive subject. “How did things go with your father?”
“Dean, you are still heali-”
Castiel didn’t wince. He just closed his eyes for a second. In that second, golden light filled the small cut, and a moment later the skin was left unblemished. “There. All fixed.”
“You can hand them over, if you really want to.” Jack stated with more confidence than he felt.
Castiel jumped a little. It felt as if Dean had read his mind. He quickly recovered and answered as calmly as he could. “Not to my knowledge. But as you have discovered, I do not always know when Jack will call for me.”
“Yes. Dean, you must be absolutely sure.” Jack concurred.
“I’m alr-…” No, stop. Bad, old habits. “I… I don’t know. It’s all a bit fuzzy.” Dean blinked, tried to focus.
“I have to go.” Castiel untangled himself, suddenly realising how he and Dean had almost tried to melt together on the bed.
Oh, how Dean had deserved so much better and so much more in life.
It was an easy way out. Castiel felt slightly ashamed to take this route. But he had not lied. He had just not said ‘No, Jack, it wasn’t just pure luck. I have been here all night, watching over Dean in his sleep. We are romantically involved now’. He really did not want to have that conversation right now, in front of everyone.
Castiel now turned his regretful eyes to Dean. He couldn’t say it out loud, but Dean immediately understood the meaning.
Dean was not sure what he had expected. He had probably imagined something out of a cartoon; Large, golden gates. But apparently, he should had taken the concept of ‘Pearly Gates’ more literal.
“Oh, looky looky… The new Archangel… Pretty, shiny… Destroying my Reapers… You will be mine too someday, you know? Yes, yes, you will… Will rest for eternity here…” The manic smile stretched wider.
He smiled as he thought of Cas. Of course. It seemed so obvious now. Cas got it. Cas would be right there, next to him in the dark. And force him to eat and sleep properly. Make him stay in bed in the morning… Alright, this was not the place for that line of thought.
Dean stepped forward and aimed a hit to its head. He felt it hit, but instead of hitting something solid, his hand sank into the black mass. It had no temperature or real mass. The closest comparison he could think of was water, but dry, which was just a messed-up thought.
As soon as the light evaporated, everyone looked up.
Things calmed down after the big reunion party. Dad took Sam and him fishing. They all went hunting for non-monstrous game, like ordinary civilians. They visited old friends. He and dad took long drives in Baby, just for the enjoyment of the ride. They would tinker with the engine late into the night. Sam and he would sit out at night watching the stars, sharing a beer. They had family dinners.
“Which would bring us back to the Archangels being the only creatures we know that might actually be created purely from this primal force, and the only ones who might be able to fight it.” Dean concluded bitterly.
“You get used to it.” Castiel shrugged. “Let’s go.”
“No, the Empty is much too fundamental to be killed, even by myself. But hopefully an Archangel could stop the Empty Reapers and maybe assist in keeping the Empty at bay.” Jack answered. “Also, I am not sure if it would be a good idea to kill the Empty. Even if it is right now an enemy to us, it still serves a purpose. I have no idea what would happen to reality if we removed the Empty. Where would the spirits of Angels and Demons go when they die?” Jack sighed, and then continued more solemnly. “I would love nothing more than to send them to a happier place, but it is beyond my powers. If we remove the Empty, they might just completely disappear.”
was alright. He felt it, but he rarely accepted it, shoving it away as quickly as it came. But since Castiel was taken by the Empty, all his words had been resonating in Dean. Not replacing his guilt and anger but giving him something else to focus on, showing him that a coin has two sides. He is a killer, but also a protector. Angry, but passionate. Rough, but caring.
Dean’s head snapped as he looked over his shoulder. He could see them. Formed in blue grace behind him. There was more than two, layered around each other. They were weightless, and yet he felt the connection to them in the same manner that he felt his arms and legs.
Castiel’s eyes suddenly widened, and he fought to get up. “The Empty Reaper…”
Then, they went downstairs and were met with the rest of the Winchesters and Jack by the bottom of the stairs. They must have been waiting for them, or at least, waiting for Dean. They did not seem to have been expecting Castiel.
Did Jack know what they had been doing? It was not illegal or wrong. And yet, Castiel could not deny this uncomfortable feeling of being caught by his son during such an intimate moment. Was it normal to feel like that?
Castiel quietly closed the door behind them. He felt awful. He wished that Jack had never mentioned anything about the Empty, that they could just go back to dinner last night and keep exchanging stories and laughing. That Dean had never been told about this option, because of course the hunter would step up to the challenge and sacrifice himself. Again. He always did. Run straight into the arms of danger if there was just the smallest chance that it may keep someone that he loved safe. Keep Castiel safe. The thought made him heavy with guilt. It made him wish that Jack had never brought him back, if it meant that Dean would be paying the price for his life. “Dean-“
Dean sent an embarrassed but thankful smile at his sister-in-law.
Castiel realised he had not even asked about Sam, too caught up in talking to Dean about his life and… other things. “Dean seemed very well. I believe Sam is happy too. Dean invited us over for dinner.”
Something was different about sleeping, though. He didn’t dream. It was like closing his eyes, and just waking up seven hours later feeling well-rested. It might have worried some people that they didn’t dream, but for Dean, it was a relief. Not even overthrowing Chuck had taken away his nightmares. He was still haunted by the people that he couldn’t save, the wrong decisions that he had made and the friends that he had lost along the way. Sometimes it got so bad that Miracle would wake him in the middle of the night, worried so much about his distressed owner that he would crawl into the bed, even though he knew he was not allowed - unless Dean specifically allowed it, which happened more than he would ever admit.
But the hunter needed to breath, so he reluctantly rolled onto his back. Castiel quickly curled up next to him, and Dean opened his arm to cradle the Angel close to his side. It was a very human gesture that made Dean smile. He kissed the top of the Cas’ hair.
“Yeah, Cas. Really. Not happy about it. Pretty damned scared, actually. But fine.” Dean smiled.
“I’m not sure this is a good idea, Dean.” Castiel agreed.
“No, it isn’t. It actually seemed quite annoyed by-” Castiel was cut off by a piercing siren. He ducked his head and tried to cover his ears, but it resonated within his head. It was one of the most terrifying sounds in Heaven.
It was the first time they met Jo’s dad. Dean had exchanged nervous glances with Sam when their dad greeted him, but they had apparently forgiven past missteps. William Harvelle was a good man, and clearly loved his family more than anything. He ruffled Jo’s hair despite her protests and kissed Ellen’s cheek whenever he saw an opening.
“Remodel?” Sam asked sceptically.
“Shut up.” Dean hugged the older hunter.
“Hey, he’s running Heaven. Not just any regular day job, you know.” Dean grasped for straws.
John had been remarkably quiet during the whole exchange. Now, he slammed his fist down on the tabletop, making porcelain and cutlery rattle, and effectively silenced the room. He fixed Jack with a piercing glare and hissed. “Enough! I’m not going to listen to any more of this. I don’t care about your celestial war. Me and my family have done more than enough for this world. We have fought and died for the cause.” Now he pointed a finger at Dean, anger immediately replaced by something softer. “My boy… My boy already gave his life. He’s given everything! So don’t you dare come drag him back in just because you pissed off this Empty thing. That’s on you!” John pushed back his chair and stood. “I think you should say your goodbyes and leave.” He looked pointedly at both Jack and Castiel, then left the room. The backdoor slammed seconds later.
It started as a small tingle in his neck. Like a bug crawling under his skin.
“Dean... Who lives and who dies was not for you to decide, nor the preacher’s wife. You did the right thing and restored order.” Castiel hurt at the guilt that is visibly weighed on Dean. Despite his anger towards the previous Deity, Dean clearly blamed himself even more.
The Empty seemed surprised by the question. It gaped for a moment before answering; “Quiet. Sleep.”
The smile faltered on the Empty. With a sneer, it held out a hand, and balls of light started rising and detaching from the black floor beneath them. They rose first as black bubbles until the tar finally let go of them and they could soar freely. The black emptiness was illuminated by the power of all the souls that the Empty had reaped from Earth.
Castiel’s smile turned a bit sad. “We were worried that the added freedom could have these kinds of consequences. When people were just reliving their happiest moments, they didn’t contemplate their lives or their surroundings. Now, they can see all their loved ones, do whatever they want, have whatever they want. It allows for thinking and concerns.”
Dean frowned. “I… Uhm… I tried imagining my grace going to my hand, and… smite the Demon.” It sounded almost childish when put like that.

Castiel huffed out a laughter that turned into a deep chuckle. It was just like Dean to make a long, rambling declaration and
Dean had that small thoughtful frown. “How many Empty Reapers are there?”
The answer came with no hesitation, but with a radiant smile. “I love you too, Dean.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I just heard Sam.” Dean shook his head as if to clear his head.
. Though Angels were not the fluffy creatures that he had once imagined, they still represented something pure and good and powerful that Dean felt unworthy of. Especially Cas. He quickly broke the awkward silence. “Damn, I feel like a freaking teenager again.”
Castiel quickly strode past his son to stand in what would hopefully be a safe distance with the rest of the group. He pointedly ignored their smiles as well.
“And your Reapers?” Jack lowered his head, glaring at the Empty.
“None the less, the truth is that no one has ever attempted regenerating the grace of an Angel this way before.” Castiel explained plainly. “Jack will have to follow his instincts and adjust to the reaction of the grace when he manipulates its composition.”
Dean frowned. “What?”
They were later joined by Ash when the tech genius finally crawled out of his hole. And later Bobby, Rufus, Charlie, Pamela, Jody, Donna, Ketch, Kevin and his mother and many other familiar faces showed up. At first, he had been surprised to see Jody and Donna. But then he remembered that just like Sam, they had lived a lifetime while he had been taking a simple drive. Dean felt sad that he had missed all this time with their friends. But they were here, they were together, and everyone was happy. That was all that mattered. Seeing the friends that they had lost along the way was both painful and redeeming. They all seemed to forgive him and Sam for getting them killed. Well, at least on the condition that they buy them a drink.
“But I am glad that you still felt that you could confide in me.” Castiel smiled.
. “Well, uh… I had something I wanted to talk to him about… alone.”

All except Jack, who just smiled at them like any other day and said: “Good morning, Dean. Good morning, Castiel. I sensed you were already here. How lucky is that?”
“We did.” Castiel confirmed. “It was eliminated.”
Dean looked at Sam who lifted his eyebrows in surprise. Their shared thought was clear:
But now, he didn’t have nightmares. He still felt his old guilts and regrets, but they didn’t weigh on him in the same way that they had done when he was alive. He was accepting of them. At peace with his road through life, the good and the bad, if this was how it all ended; Sammy got to live his normal life in the end, and now they were all back together again. It was a good enough ending.
“Camael… We need to keep the Gate closed.” Jack pleaded.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, family has that effect on you.” When Castiel once again just frowned, Dean elaborated. “Talking about…. relationships and other intimate stuff, like… sex… can be difficult with family, ‘cause you don’t want to think of them like that or have them think about you like that… you know, romantically and… naked. I swear, when Sam hit his teens, having ‘the talk’ was…”
“I’m serious, Dean. In a fit of anger or despair you could risk sending out a flare of pure energy that could hurt someone unintendedly. You have to channel your intentions, and the grace will follow.”
“-Jack, you can’t ask this of Dean-”
“The common areas cannot accommodate everyone’s liking. Our individual rooms are personalised in much the same way as your Heaven.” Castiel explained.
-.-.-.-
The Empty lowered its hand, giving up its claim on the souls. Jack quickly snapped his fingers, sending them to Heaven where they belonged.
Dean nodded and avoided eye contact. He decided to change the subject before things got too sappy. “So, what do you actually do out there, protecting Heaven?” He tried to sound a bit flirtatious, and judging by Cas’ small smile, he was somewhat successful.
Mary would never know how fuzzy those words made her son feel in that moment. Dean quickly answered; “I invited him and Jack to come by for dinner some time.”
Chapter 16:
“I know, Sammy.” Dean smiled sadly, and then couldn’t help but add jokingly; “No rest for the wicked, huh?”
Dean laughed a little half-heartedly at Sam’s playful tone. Despite technically being an old man, his brother acted more like his younger self since arriving in Heaven; Playful and smiling. Carefree. He could share this with Sam. He should. Again, it was just this little problem called ‘
“That sounds very just.” Castiel smiled.
Jack looked at the people behind him. He once again snapped his fingers and everyone but him, Sam, Dean and Castiel popped back to Heaven. Sam smoothed down his hair after Eileen’s eager dancing. Dean casually sipped the beer that Ash had handed him.
Castiel nodded his thanks at his brother and then led them out of the library and down some long white halls. Dean had never seen this side of Heaven before. It seemed almost clinical, giving Dean some unnerving flashbacks to hospitals. Was this really the operation behind Heaven? What happened to the Garden? It was just hallway after hallway of white. Finally, Dean said: “You seem to have a colour theme.”
“Empty!” Jack called into the black void.
Cas smiled. “You have always put the people you love before everything else. I guess I should have thought of it much sooner. Of course, your motivation would be love. There is no purer intention in your heart than that, and you grace fully embraced that.”
Dean turned away from the enthusiastic God to look at his brother and his lover. Yes, lover was a good word. He finally found the right word.
John yielded, repeating his action of the previous night by leaving through the backdoor. Though Dean was saddened by his father’s reaction, it was much better than anything he had experienced when he was alive. His dad had never backed down but kept fighting until he got his way, no matter the consequences to his sons.
“No!” Dean yelled. He threw himself over Cas to shield him and raised his hand in a desperate defence against the coming attack. He felt a surge run through him and a bright light shot out of his hand.
Bobby stood up from a table that was buried in books. “Hey shuttlecock.”
Castiel sobered and looked thoughtfully at the hunter. “I appreciate your words, Dean. Truly. I could tell when you told me about Miracle that you have opened yourself up to love and kindness in a way I have not seen before-“
“We need to go.” Castiel stood up next to Jack, ready to leave.
He heard steps behind him and looked up to see the Reaper approaching. She looked confused, apparently still unable to see the Empty Reaper, even if it was just black batter sliding down brick. “Is it gone?”
“But we could wait longer. We are still holding our own against the Empty-“ Castiel started but was cut off.
“Why? Why is it doing it?” Dean felt a familiar desperation rising.
“Yes.” Castiel huffed frustratedly.
Dean let down his hand, returning his focus to the Angel beneath him. “Cas?” He was still knocked out, but his grace looked like before, so all angelic life signs seemed alright.
Castiel raised his hand, showing the familiar tape with Dean’s clumsy handwriting.
The question did not have to be said out loud. Dean nodded. “I know. And yeah, I have given that a lot of thought. You being a man – or possessing a male vessel or whatever – has probably played a factor in me not thinking about you this way before. But I’ve realised that it doesn’t matter. You are you, and that’s all that matters to me. You are the important part, the thing that makes me happy, not your ‘visage’. Sure, there might be a bit of… adaption…” Dean raised his eyebrows suggestively, making Castiel blush at the thought. “But I’m pretty confident that we can figure it out. If… that’s something you would want.”
Then a sudden thought hit Dean, and he pulled back a bit. “Unless it’s like illegal or something? I mean, you’re an Angel and I’m… dead. Is there like a rule against stuff like that?”
. He was almost disappointed that the Angel for once had chosen to appear right in front of him. Cas popping up behind him and putting a hand on his shoulder, just like old times, would have been a nice touch to their reunion.
“Seriously guys, I feel good. Great even. And the quicker we do this, the sooner I can get back to, well, being dead.” Dean tried to reason.
Dean pulled back, stopping himself. He smiled a bit shyly, clearing his throat. They stood a bit awkwardly, bodies still separated by just an inch. Before Dean could say anything, Castiel lifted a hand and caressed the hunter’s cheek, running his thumb over the defined cheek bone. “I love you.”
“Went on one last hunt, and that was it.” Dean finished quickly, voice lower than during his happy tales just moments before, thus confirming what Castiel has already figured out.
Dean frowned, thinking back to what he had said. “…’You’re my ride home’?”
“Stop right there.” Dean held up a finger in warning. “I can see the guilt all over those baby blues of yours. This is not your fault, Cas. Don’t you dare start weighing my life against yours. You know that I would do this a hundred times over if it meant keeping you and everyone else safe.”
Slowly, they had more days just to themselves. He actually had time to read books now. Like, actual books with fictional stories instead of heavy tomes in extinct languages. Old westerns were surprisingly good on paper as well.
With all the reruns of hunters they had met in the past, Dean only had time for fleeting thoughts of Cas. He kept expecting him to pop up, but he never did. Maybe he wasn’t allowed. But Dean found it hard to believe that Jack would keep him from visiting. Maybe he was just busy. They had just remodelled Heaven, after all. They were probably still working out the kinks.
“Why did you even keep sleep in Heaven? It’s not really necessary, is it?” Dean yawned again. “It’s annoying.”
They got dressed. Well, Castiel added his missing layers while Dean chose to change his clothes for something clean.
“Hey Cas.” Dean’s voice was thick with emotion.
“Now LEAVE!” The Empty yelled, sending ripples through the floor.
/ ‘Far from Home’ by Five Finger Death Punch
Silence stretched around the table.
When the Angels appeared, some of the figures turned away from the Gate and attacked them instead. Unlike the calculating Empty Reapers, these acted like wild beasts, attacking anything and everything they came into contact with.
Dean snapped his eyes open. The lights had faded. Instead, he saw his family in front of him. All of them. They looked concerned. Sam and Cas were kneeling right in front of him. The rest was standing behind them. Sam had a golden glow in him. Cas had blueish white running through him. And over Cas’ right shoulder stood Jack, shining white. So, who was touching his back?
“Yes.” Castiel simply answered. He was more worried about the bloodied hand that Dean was still pressing to his side than showing of his living quarters. “Do you need me to heal you?”
It was initially meant to be more or less a Destiel fic but turned into something more like a season 15 add-on. I won’t call it a fix-it fic, though I guess I do try to fix some specific points/answer some open questions. I’ll save most of my thoughts (rambling) about it for the afterword. But here are the basic ideas behind this story:
“I did not want to worry your family unnecessarily. And in case we need help from Jack, he is much closer to our current location.”
Castiel just looked at the hunter. It couldn’t be real. But it was. He could see it clearly in Dean’s eyes. Love. Dean might not have been in love with him before, had not been open to the notion. And maybe he felt guilt due to Castiel’s sacrifice, making him take this leap a bit desperately. But he could sense the change in Dean. His heartfelt wish to explore his feelings for Castiel. But Dean was scared. He feared what would happen if it didn’t work out. If he ended up hurting Castiel. His previous relationships had all ended in resentment. But Castiel could never hate him. And Castiel desperately wanted this and was willing to take the risk. He didn’t know what tomorrow might bring, but right now, right here, it was just them.
Castiel put down the cutlery he had been holding, the fork slightly bended where he had gripped it tightly. “Dean, please. This is none of your concern. You are here to be at peace, not to be caught up in Heaven’s affairs.”
Castiel felt the madras dip behind him and turned to find Dean laying on his side, head resting in the hand of his bended arm. He looked up, smiling at Castiel. Dean seemed to sense the tenseness and questions in the Angel. “If you want to, you can drop the coat and tie. Make yourself comfortable.”
“I’m sorry.” Jack said solemnly. “I know this is disturbing.”
Dean happily guided Cas. Every little response and sound that he drew from the Angel sent sparks dancing over his skin. Cas might be inexperienced, but a quick learner, and every touch was tender and filled with eager expressions of devotion.
Some time passed before Castiel again broke the silence. “You do know what this means, don’t you? You being an Archangel?”
Castiel looked guilty. “I’m sorry. I meant to come by sooner, but… There’s still much to be done in Heaven. We were not sure if we would be able to make it tonight. Everything is a bit… unpredictable.”
It hit Dean with a force of scorching arousal. This was real, and clean, and purifying. It was intention and emotion expressed in every tender kiss, every exploring hand. He felt undeserving of the loving, trusting being underneath him. That someone so powerful and pure would even let Dean come near. It made Dean want to worship him. Made him want to show Cas just how much he meant to him.
Dean on the other hand was surprisingly nervous about the fact that he had just talked about maybe, one day, to have sex with
-.-.-.-
“Fine?” Castiel asked with slight anger. That word brought back too many memories of Dean saying that he was fine when he was absolutely not.
Jack finally broke the silence. “Your father is right. It is my problem. And we are still looking for other solutions, scrutinising Heaven’s libraries.”
After a moment of silence, Dean stepped forward. He didn’t look back. Couldn’t. So, he just stepped up to Jack in the middle of the room. He quickly patted Jack on the shoulder to let him know that it was alright. “Let’s get this show on the road, kid.”
Dean walked away before Sam could say anything.
Dean quickly closed the distance between himself and the Demon. He grabbed the Demon’s head from behind, while it was still focused on the Angel on the floor. He had seen Cas and other Angels do this so many times before. Cas had said to stay in control. He took a breath and tried imagining his grace run through him and attack the Demon, repeating in his head; “
“No argument here.” Dean looked around, finding a lot of curious eyes looking back at him.
“No, no, no, no, no…” The Empty turned around itself. It didn’t seem to know where to start, who to look at, who to yell at. It ran its hands over its ears, trying to shield itself from the noisy surroundings. It finally decided to focus back on its main threat, hissing at Jack. “I will kill them all!”
Dean did as he was told, filling his lungs a couple of times. He realised that there were a lot of sensations that he had not felt when dead, simple breathing being one of them. He had been breathing, or something similar to it, but he had not felt his lungs this way. His old pains and quirks were another unwelcomed feeling. Years of hunting had left its marks on the human body.
He walked into the house to find his mom preparing dinner. He was surprised to find that so much of the day had past, considering how early he had left. He had not even had lunch! But then again, you were not hungry in Heaven if you didn’t want to be.
“Cas… I’m not good at this. And I don’t want to hurt you. And I have no right to ask.” Dean’s voice was muffled by tears and the trench coat. “But if you can find it in yourself to give me a chance… I wasn’t ready before… But I think I am now.”
And they took long drives through the green landscapes of Heaven. Only them and the roaring engine of the Impala. Dean was thrilled that Castiel was still willing to go on something as simple as a drive. But the Angel clearly had just as fond memories of the vehicle as Dean did.
They all moved to leave the white room. Mary was the first to reach the door, but when she opened it, she stopped in her tracks and turned back to look at Jack. When Jack stepped forward, she stepped aside to let him through first. Everyone else stretched and bended to get a look at what had stopped Mary from leaving the room.
“Cas…” Dean was doing this to keep the Angel safe. Was that so damn hard to accept?
Dean suddenly became aware of his own body. He felt tired, his grace somehow felt smaller, and blood was running down his neck from the small puncture wounds that the Empty Reaper had succeeded in inflicting on him. But he said: “Yeah, I’m fine.” Castiel raised his hand towards his neck to heal him, but Dean batted his hand away and nodded at the Angel’s own wounds. “Save it, Cas. Heal yourself first.”
Dean smiled. “Well, I guess it was short but sweet. Sammy and I stayed in the bunker. Not much changed on that front. Oh, except, I got a dog!”
“Huh.” Dean kept ruffling them around. Then he looked at Cas. He could see his wings too, but he had to… tune in on the right channel. The one where Cas was displayed in blue light, shining everywhere. It was odd, seeing the wings like this. Every time he had seen Cas’ wings, they had seemed corporal, even if only portrayed in shadows. He had always imagined them as white and fluffy, like in any movie or picture of an Angel that he could think of.
Dean laid down, hand still on Castiel’s waist and Castiel’s hand on his arm. “I might have to revise the whole ‘taking it slow’ thing.”
“Okay.” Finally, his own voice. Even if it was breathless and strangled.
“In here, Sammy.” Dean called back.
“Yes, you can.” A voice said behind them. They turned, and Dean recognised the Angel he had seen wounded out in the field. Her clothes and skin were bloodied, but she seemed to have been able to heal herself.
“Well, Dean.” Jack turned to look at the hunter, still a small smile on his face.
Dean stepped forward and placed a careful, lingering kiss on the Angel. Now, Castiel could feel a small shake in Dean’s lips. “Are you sure?” Castiel managed to whisper into the kiss.
“You did it, Jack.” Castiel squeezed his son’s shoulder.
Dean smiled at the distant memory of a young Nephilim learning how to drive and felt his shoulders relax. “Damn straight.” He looked back up at his family. Eileen was hugging Sam’s arm, stroking it reassuringly. Sam was just staring at Dean with eyes full of concern. His father was standing behind his mother, holding her shoulders. Maybe holding her back from running to her oldest son. Maybe giving himself something to hold on to. Bobby was looking at him in that fatherly, concerned, encouraging, proud way of his. And Cas. His eyes could only be described as begging. Begging for Dean to stop this, for Jack to be careful, for everything to be alright.
God, even in Heaven he couldn’t avoid that question.
Dean nodded in order to acknowledge that he had heard Cas. Every time the Angel praised him, he felt a comforting heat in his stomach, telling him that things were alright. That
“Yes. I still fear that removing the Empty would have a catastrophic impact on the universe and our reality.” Jack confirmed.
