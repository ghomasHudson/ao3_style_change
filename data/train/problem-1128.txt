John was hushed, his eyes downcast still, his fingernails bitten back to stubs and reddened around the edges. "We can't really...be together, like we want to be."
Sherlock whirled around, his long coat whipping at John's shins. "Finally, somebody who speaks some sense." He bit out, shoving past a blushing Molly Hooper who was shifting on her feet and mumbling, and stormed up the cobbled path leading to the lodge.
John cleared his throat, watery eyes skittering away from the young man's face, looking at anything but Sherlock. "Um, yeah-" He clenched his hands at his sides. "Lestrade's gone to check out, so-"
Greg interrupted before John could ask, however, stepping forward into the shadow of the ambulance. "Excuse me, I don't believe we've been introduced, I'm-"
John panicked, almost falling over with the speed in which he pulled himself away from Sherlock, envious at Sherlock's constant cool and collected exterior.
He never screamed, he thrashed, scratched, shoved, and bit as hard as he could. Nothing seemed to deter the figure of heavy black eyes and gelled hair. James' glowing white teeth held the familiar cunning grin of a wolf sizing up its prey, and his hands wandered. They never stopped. Sherlock grew tired.
Clearing his throat, Sherlock uncurled from his slouch against the wall. "I believe students and teachers have been excused from school until further notice. You should go home."
He allowed himself a moment of missing his mother, trying to block out the perfunctory  hand of his father's that rests on her shoulder. It was easier to pretend that he wasn't the reason the Holmes family was such a mess. Deceased parents and a pretentious, unrelenting older brother to deal with,
John stood in front of the car, gazing up at the thatched roof of the cottage, the ornate swirls on the surface of the glass, framed by heavy wooden shutters as if from Victorian ages. He was surprised by the quiet, the only interrupting sound was the flow of water, clearly from a nearby river, and the crunch of Sherlock's shoes moving around behind him. A hand appeared on his hip.
"Settling in alright then?" Stamford asked. He sat in his usual dipped chair that had held his weight for several years, in the almost empty staffroom.
Greg frowned down at his bare feet, his fingers clenching tightly around the device in his hand. "What work?"
I poured two cups of tea and set one down for him.  I felt disheartened and rejected, but did my very best to hide it.  Of course, we were still strangers to each other, and of course, we did not know each other's stories yet, not really, just the barest bones, and hardly that.  I wanted to, god knows, and that thought pricked at me.
“Of course I spoke with him.  He was not at all pleased to see me, I assure you, although his dog was in near ecstasy.  I made it only as far as the hallway; he would not entertain having me further inside his dump.  So we stood there as a couple of skittles and said all that we had to.  He was much angered by Pike's deception, and he made it very clear that he would stop at nothing now.  He has nothing to lose, John, you see.  He has no stability, no position, no family bond, for his dishonour has shamed his poor mother who wants nothing more to do with him.  He will not listen to reason.  He threw some charming insults in my direction, and that was that.”
“I am more resilient than perhaps you give me credit for,” I told him.  “Tomorrow I may wish to break a vase or smash a teacup, but right now I would like to take a bath and then, perhaps, some supper.”
I nodded in amusement at his unusual turn of phrase, finding the idea a pleasant one, for the day was bright and blue, the sun coquettish through the puff-clouds.  Observing my friend as he smoked his clay pipe, I saw that he was wearing his tie-pin, my gift.  I could scarce conceal my pleasure at this, at realising he admired it and had not been merely humouring my fancy.  That he was fond enough to wear it on a Sunday, best of all.
“Holmes, but this surely means you have him now?  Oh, but wait.  It was a 'C', not an 'E', on those other notes.  Could you have misread it?”
not.”  He tossed his head.  “I'd rather stay in here with you.”  He stopped abruptly, as if his tongue had bolted for the open stable door and left its groom behind.  “I mean to say,” he added swiftly, “what with the weather, and the cold, and all this nuisance with
I turned out all of his desk drawers in anxious search for the morocco case.  Yielding little but the usual desk detritus, the root extended to his bedroom.
We stayed, and talked awhile of other things: our busy London lives; the summer concert schedule.  We made plans to meet up later in July, to attend the programme at St. James's Hall.  I felt a thrill that Holmes and I were talking as a couple now – the royal 'We'!  I challenged him to Billiards, then.  He groaned, but acquiesced, and we stepped out into the hall.
“They say, nothing unusual,” he exclaimed.  “How can that be?  When I myself have observed the old woman, who stands by the gate and looks through with her dark, beady eyes?  And then there is the garden!  I ask about it, and all they can tell me is that this fellow popped up like some magic rabbit, and spent three weeks or a month doing all of these things.”
I pulled him close, inhaled the air of him.  “Remove that coat,” I whispered, and he did so, barely caring where it landed on the floor.  He shucked his jacket, too, as I did mine, and then, standing in shirt-sleeves, we embraced once more, the closer and the happier for that.
My lips trailed slowly up his neck, across his throat, under his chin, under his bottom lip.  His eyes were tightly shut, his breath erratic, and his fingers curled around my upper arms as if to sever circulation.
It is likely you will think less of me when I tell you what I did.  For I picked up the shirt and held it close against my face.  I breathed in his scent, the musk, the sweet...
I felt a flutter in my chest and puzzled wildly for the time it took to eat my second slice of toast, and finish off the eggs.  I thought that I should stay close to the fire today – the weather was quite filthy – and perhaps read some George Meredith.  I hoped that that might please my friend.  I was not sure as why the latter point seemed so important to me, therefore I opted not to dwell on it.
I sprang up, upsetting not only my chair but a small paper pile.  I hastened to the door where my receptionist was hovering.  I motioned her away.
I was touched by my friend's words.  Very few years ago such a kind gesture might not have occurred, as elevated as his mind was above the human state of feeling and compassion.  I could not help but smile, despite my sadness at the news.
I hooked an arm around him, pulled him prone upon the sofa.  He emitted a soft squawk.  I set to anchor him with half my body weight.
“Good heavens, man.  You mean to say that you don't know?  The news is all around the village now.  Mrs. Oaks died of pneumonia just yesterday!”
“For that infernal great brainbox of yours,” I retorted.  I jolted off the path into the tall grass, and the knapsack on my back set off a clamour in three-part harmony.
“Very well,” he said, turning away.  I was grateful for his discretion which no doubt I ill deserved.  I dived for my fireside chair and scrabbled for my pipe and matches.
“Holmes,” I said, “thank you.  Thank you, for... this.”  I paused and looked around again.  “I think.”
“Shhh!” I said, now laughing too, for this was so absurd; “Oh, shhhh!” – for they were being very loud.  I chanced to look behind me, and my heart dropped to my boots, for there was Holmes, stood in the hallway, frozen, rooted to the spot.  His face was stricken as his eyes set on the three of us; the doltish pair beside me, and myself – now extricating from the madness and taking several steps towards him.
He nodded mutely, sullenly.  He looked sharply to the door then, alarmed, I suppose, that the lady herself may have been standing there and fuming, having overheard his taunt.
“I--” he began.  He shuffled forwards, still wide-eyed and knee-bound, towards Sherlock Holmes, as if Holmes were some form of deity.  “I-- !”
It seemed that we spent many of our mornings in just this fashion, and the taller the mail pile then the richer the game.  Holmes's moods would fluctuate from one missive to the next, and his reactions unpredictable.  I thought perhaps it might be wise to retrieve the Newton invoice.  Mahogany and hinges, and all of those things that must do good the damage, may well be expensive, but I had scant desire for my own face or for that of my friend's to land into sharp contact with Newton's right-hook.
Holmes tapped at the newspaper before him.  “This report has little detail.  It is all frantic hyperbole.  But Talmadge was stabbed to death.  The housekeeper found him, and according to the
“When ma hadn't seen Augusta, only this other gentleman here,” – and he pointed to young Victor, who seemed much affected by the story – “well, I was worried and I felt even more upset.  So ma wrote another note for me, and late at night she came and popped it through the letterbox.  And now we're here, and I don't know what else there's left to say.  My mother's dead, and I feel as if it is my fault.”
, 'John can do that'?” I demanded, cross.  “Why do you always seem to take it for granted that I'll--”
“My boss has given me until the end of the week,” the young man replied.  “Tobias will be here for the weekend.  As for the servants, they are paid up to the month end, and after that I do not know.  I suppose that I should speak with them about it.”
“That's right,” said the fellow.  “That's just what you said.  We had saved up some money, so we sailed here on luck and on hope, Mr. Holmes.  Ma was able to remember some small details of Augusta, and it took a little time but in the end I tracked her down.  Then, of course, I was too skeered and awkward to say anything about it.”
“What a lovely day it's been,” he said.  “You will treasure all these memories.”  He settled in his chair, then, lit a cigarette, and beamed at me.
“Neither do I,” replied Holmes.  “Which is why, my dear boy, we have arrived at this impasse.”  He looked at his watch.  “In heaven's name, whatever
“It's quite all right.” I left and closed the door, returning to my room.  For a long spell there was stone silence, then a raised muttering, and finally, two voices at high decibel.  Who was coming off the worse for it, I could not tell, but then: “
He took a drink.  “You have me fair and square.”  His grey eyes fixed me to the spot.  “You have me, John.”
My friend went the one way while I went the other.  The house was quite still, not a footstep nor creak could I hear as I made my traverse to the study.  The door was unlocked.  I stepped inside and circumnavigated the rust-brown blood stains to the desk.  I replaced the address book just as Holmes had asked.  With a feeling of accomplishment, I made ready to leave.
He disappeared.  I heard his heels upon the tile, fading to silence, and I stood there like a statue, mossed and obsolete in misery.  I followed him, at length – or tried to, at the very least – but he was gone; the hall was empty, and the offices were locked.
Holmes nodded, and was quiet for a moment.  “Mine are too,” he whispered then.  “But not pneumonia.”  He paused.  “I rarely speak of them.  I don't know that I'm comfortable in doing so.”  An anxious movement with his cup that almost caused his tea to spill proved a distraction long enough to change the subject, blot the sentiment.
“Excuse me, please, if you thought it was gibber,” I said, with a fleck of annoyance.  “I vote we wait until six, and then go and see what is wrong.”
I mustered all the calm that I was able, which was barely half that of the frustration currently boiling at my tongue.
“My dear Victor and Gregson, I must ask you to allow me a minute.  How am I to carry on with my work if there is constant interruption?  If you could return to the sitting-room, please, and John and I shall join you there when we are able.  Thank you.”
A big thank you to everyone who has read, commented, and/or thrown kudos at this story.  It's my first “retirement” fic, so I was a little apprehensive, but perhaps without cause.  You've all been so lovely.  In which direction should I head next?  That's where YOU come in.  Which era of Holmes & Watson do you enjoy the most, and want to read more of?
I hailed a hansom and sat back inside the cab, in thoughtful mood.  It was a pleasant day, despite persistent drizzle; warm, at least.  We were held up for several minutes by an accident involving two large grocers' carts; the road had to be cleared, and we were on our way again.  At length we came to stop; the driver tapped upon the roof, and I stepped out and paid my fare.  The street that I was standing on was fairly well-to-do.  I looked around and found my bearings, and as the hansom clattered off I walked up to the door of 221B Baker Street.  I rang the bell.  I waited patiently.  There was some turbulence within; I heard the thud of boots upon the stair, and then a key turned in the lock, and the door pulled slowly inwards to reveal a stern-faced gentleman.
“I must get dressed,” said Holmes.  “I can't lay here like this with you.”  He sprang up from the bed, and rooted briefly in the wardrobe.  He disappeared behind the screen.  I heard him rustling and buttoning, and I mourned the loss of intimacy.  What a silly thing!  And not a loss at all, of course, but even so.  I'd rather we had stayed in bed together for an hour or two longer, talking nonsense, fond regard, or wrapped up in each other's arms.
A small misfortune, then, to have it almost knocked from off my shoulders by a charging bull with flaxen hair.  Inspector Gregson – for it was he – spun on his axis and held out both his hands to steady me.
Pike chuckled to himself.  His long fingers curled around his upper arms, as if in self-congratulation.
In coats and gloves and scarves we shut the front door fast behind us and walked out into the lane.  The air was still and very cold.
“Augusta Burroughs had a child when she was nineteen, out of wedlock,” said my friend.  “It was a son, and according to the correspondence the boy was given to adoption only a few weeks after birth.  Neither son nor mother attempted contact for over forty years.  The boy's new family moved to Cuba.  Now he has returned to England, perhaps due in part to a latent wish to locate his true mother and to meet with her for the first time.  Understandably, it took him a little time to track Lady Augusta down, and then – well, I think perhaps that story is better told from those who experienced it at first hand.  One thing we may be sure of: the son is unaware of his mother's demise.  I wonder if young Jane is here today?  I have another telegram to send.”
“Holmes,” I said, hesitating, disbelieving, “am I given to understand that you have made me a... a piñata... in the shape of a moustache... for Valentine's Day, and now you are expecting me to...” – and here I paused a fraction longer – “... to play with it?”
I groaned.  “I think they may have been.  At least we only signed with our initials.  We had some little saving sense, at least.”
NEW LETTER RECEIVED ADDRESSED TO MY AUNT STOP I BEG YOU TO COME HERE TODAY STOP TOBIAS WILL BE CATCHING THE TWELVE THIRTY TRAIN STOP VB
“I also deduce,” I continued, “that you are quite the handsomest fellow I ever did see, and I love you, and I want you.”
He shrugged.  “Families are complicated animals,” said he.  And then he spoke no more about it, so diverting us instead to music, violins, and orchestras.
I shook my head and made a mime of taking notes.  He might have countered, had the call not then rung out for us to hurry to our seats, as the concert was now imminent.  The stalls were crowded, but we found our places close to the main aisle, and listened to the parps and shrills of the large orchestra, its members tuning up and testing notes.  And the conductor tapped his baton on the stand, called to attention, and the first piece came to life.
“I consult with Scotland Yard,” said he.  “I am, in fact, the only consulting detective in the world.”  He paused to puff his chest.  He beamed.  “You would know my name, of course, but you have been abroad, so I forgive you.”
Stamford shook his head.  “It doesn't matter.  Just don't dare sabotage my wager, or my pal and I'll be having words with you.”
“How could you not be,” I reassured him – for he was currently more querulous princess than consulting detective.  “The handsomest fellow alive!  But playing you would drive
“I had a wonderful dream last night.  Oh!  And a telegram arrived from Victor.  You will never guess.  It is over there, I put it on the breakfast table.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a patient, long-suffering sigh.  “That is correct.”  He lovingly ogled the piñata.  “It took ages to build.  It was messy, too.  Papier-mâché is a horrible medium.  And I found out that I'm scared of balloons.”  He winced at the memory.
“You might have tossed it out,” I said.  Holmes made a noise of mild anxiety.  He kicked a box.  He eased himself out of his jacket, hung it neatly on the door peg, whence he turned around to look at me.  “Watson,” he said slowly, “I
My friend shrugged.  “I don't remember.”  He examined it more closely.  “Hmm.  A good year for single malt.”
“You were perceptive, and it made me feel...” Holmes tapered off.  “I had an impulse, and... I don't do well with those.”  He looked out of the window, nibbled crossly at a fingernail.  “I need to feel
We found two eggs inside the music room, and one tucked inside a billiard table pocket.  There was one egg, crushed and forlorn, under the hatstand.
My friend smiled.  “Overworked and underpaid, as he never ceases to inform me.  I rather enjoy his correspondence all the same.  We should pop in to Scotland Yard next week to see him, John.”
I nodded, stepped aside to let him bustle past.  The noticeboard now sported a typewritten memorandum, the first line of which read thus:
.”  He brushed my cheek.  “So you're the first.  That other fellow was just practice.”  And he smiled, and kissed me softly.
“A great many years have been packed into these boxes,” I said, with reflection.  “Our whole lives, more or less.  So much, into so little.”
Holmes sighed.  “He cared a little more for you than you for him.  Which really begs the question, are you nervous of commitment?”
”  He lost his patience with me then.  “Oh, do come in, for heaven's sake.  Quite why you're standing with that look upon your face, I've no idea, but it's annoying me.”
My friend might have replied, but at that moment the door swung open and we turned to greet our host.
There was no answer at Peregrine Way.  The door was locked, the windows shuttered.  A next-door neighbour kindly informed us that the housekeeper, being so traumatised by the recent sad events, was spending the weekend with a friend, but:
I reached out and pinched at his behind.  He squirmed sideways.  “That's too bad,” I said, laughing.  “But you may as well squeeze in beside me.”
“I was rather hoping that you might be keeping some of your own, Lestrade,” he said.  “A case that has you baffled, perhaps?  That would, of course, be most everything.”
“I wonder,” said he.  “I wonder.”  Then, with a sudden seeming realisation:  “The one place that I did not think to look!  John!  I am a fool.”
Holmes came to help me move the boxes, and we loaded them upon a hansom carriage.  We sat inside, the two of us, each contemplating just how far we'd come in such a little time.
Holmes leapt up and came towards me.  He set himself, a scant few inches left between us.  His scowl intensified.
The gentleman nodded.  He paused to brush his fingers down his trouser legs, as if in some plaintive, ineffectual attempt to further extend their length; for with the way that he was sitting, they curtailed quite abruptly at his shins.  His boot laces were tied in the most elaborate of fashions, with the tips of them low-dangling by his heels, and I wondered if they might have been the reason for his stumble.  I watched in fascination as our client straightened his spectacles, then changed his mind, removing them to polish with his tie.  He scrubbed each lens in turn with quite some vigour, before resettling the pair with a fine flourish on his nose.
The crushing feeling in my chest and the fluttering in my stomach was not my area of expertise, so I went to Mycroft. It wasn't his either, but at least together we had a better chance of figuring it out. He lived just across the street from his club in Pall Mall, two miles on foot from my home. I was there in half an hour. It was nearly one in the morning by this point, so the look I got from his housekeeper after a protracted period of waiting was positively frigid.
“No, you don’t,” Sherlock said, glancing out the window. “Thank you for the tour, Mrs Hudson, that will be all.”
John caved. The last trains from Baker Street were probably pulling away from their various platforms already, and he was knackered.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, hips jerking forward into John's grip. John flashed him a grin, all teeth, and brushed his thumb over the head of Sherlock's prick where it distended the fabric. Sherlock's mouth fell open and his shoulders hunched, all against his will. John's cock was nestled between the cheeks of his arse, the fabric of their briefs a devastating barrier.
“You put me down here,” I protested, sitting up, and caught him before he got away for another deep kiss.
Sherlock sighed heavily into the phone and glanced over at John, pulling a moue in apology and commiseration. "Mrs Hudson," he said, "it's not going to take a week." He waited again. "No, listen. I don't have—we don't have a week to wait. Restaurant week waits for no chef. We need that by Monday. No, no—" He had to stop again, and John could just barely hear Mrs Hudson speaking. "No," Sherlock said again, "I'll take care of it."
It is not a widely enough appreciated fact, I believe, that Sherlock Holmes has a tendency to giggle. He is a masterful man, able to demand the attention of a room full of Scotland Yard detectives, and on the scent of a case he can become almost inhuman in his focus and his intelligence. He processes information twice as fast as most people do, and sees meaning in every detail, and he takes his profession very seriously. Catch him off guard, though, with a particularly good witticism, or an affectionate admission, or a simple kiss on the neck, and he giggles like a schoolgirl. He does it unashamedly, too, his amusement all genuine, and so I strive to bring that giggle forth as often as I can.
poor man insane.  This actor would need to possess inner reserves of both courage and stamina.  And he might still go doolally.”
But good things come to those who wait.  At close of day, I filed the notes on my last patient, and I strode out to the waiting-room to find Miss Marsh and bid her a good night.
He turned upon me then, and backed me up against the wall.  His hands were in my hair, upon my nape; one leg thrust inbetween my own.  I gasped, the breath shocked out of me; my hands upon him too, then, at his chest, pushing his waistcoat up askew, pulling his shirt out of his trouser band.  We wrestled, almost violent, for a moment, faces far apart, but eyes, upon each other, burning holes, and--
“I feel quite bad about that wager now,” said Stamford.  “It started out as just a lark to pass the time.  I didn't mean for it to turn so bad.  I wrote as much to Holmes, but I suppose he'll never speak to me again.”
“Ah, Doctor,” said he, “well, you shouldn't have said that.  Victor heard the pair of you in the Blue Room, going at it like the clappers, or so he told me confidentially, bless his heart.  Keep the noise down, can you, eh, tonight, so that folks can get some sleep?  Ha ha!”
Mr. Parrow drew himself three inches taller – which was still not very tall – and puffed his chest in indignation.  “I am
“That is small comfort,” said the fellow, “but still, I thank you for your kindness.”  He looked across to Sherlock Holmes.  “What now, then?  Am I in trouble with the police, or what's the score of it?”
“Dear me.  Well, as I had mentioned, it is a curious thing to wear about one's neck.  Then I happened to recall having seen something of the sort only a few months ago, in an illustrated article on hypnotism.”
you were an invert?  Birds of a feather, my dear comrade.  If I had really cared to damage you, I might have done so before now.  That
I lost him very often and had to sprint to catch his shadow.  And from somewhere in the distance, Mycroft's voice:
,” he amended, with a nod in my direction.  “So what's this Goethe been up to then, eh?  Tell me all about him, Mr. Holmes.”
I brushed some small and clinging crumbs of treacle tart from off my waistcoat.  “Then where are we exactly with this problem, Holmes?  Your suspicions lie with Eldritch?”
Tired, self-defeated, I rose from my chair and reached for my book.  I intended to retire to my room for a while.  I could not think what to say, so resolved to say nothing.
I laughed with him, indulgent.  “That sounds fantastical,” I said.  “It would make for the most perfect story.”
He set down his cup and looked around – the room remained empty and discreet – and then leaned forward until my friend and he were almost nose-to-nose.
Holmes watched him go.  “Mycroft looks smug.  Smugger than usual, I should say.  He must be planning something heinous.”
“Shot through the forehead at close range,” I said.  “There's powder on the skin.  No other injuries, or signs of any struggle.  It
I promised that it would not, and escaped back down the stairs, somewhat perplexed by the event.  I stepped outside to take the air, and to look up at the house.  I wondered what might happen to it now Talmadge was dead.  Idly, I gazed up at the drainpipe.  I looked closer.  And closer again.  I returned inside the house.
“I believe that I shall miss them,” remarked Victor, as the front door closed much later, shutting out the dark blue night.  “I think that I shall write, or send a card to obtain their forwarding address, if they are really so intent in moving on.”
Holmes held up his hand.  “It was not my intent to offend.  I do apologise, Mr. Talmadge, but I hardly think that I can help you.  Do you really wish for me to interrogate a skull?  I can only advise you to relocate the object in question, or to sell it, and see then if the dreams might cease.  If there is nothing tangible I can work with...”
We scrambled up, surveyed the damage.  The bed's far leg had sheared away from its main fixing, and it was quite beyond repair.
Stamford looked at me, all sympathy.  “Well, once you've had a whisky soda, you'll feel better,” he replied.  “But why not tell me all about it, if it helps?”
“It is a sign of these times,” I said glumly.  “There are too many laws and for ridiculous reasons.”
Re-entering the Blue Room, I found the two beds separated and the pillows and the sheets arranged just so.  Holmes was dressed and at the window, looking out into the grounds.  The morning sun shone through and caught his face in bright, white light.  I joined him there, to gaze down at the garden.  My eyes strayed to the far front gate.  No-one.  No doubt too early.
He set to tinkering with the dial, his ear pressed to it most intently.  I sat down upon the bed and watched him work.  Victor and Gregson were hovering awkwardly in the doorway.  I motioned that they should be quiet, that they might not upset my friend's concentration.
The old woman stepped forward.  She gripped onto her bag as a means of defence; a kid-leather shield to deflect all of our scrutiny.
I hauled myself, and plumped back down beside him on the pillows.  We were both quite out of breath.  He turned to look at me.  “I think you turned me inside out,” he said.
“Oh, John, I am sorry, but that was just what I needed,” said he.  “I don't remember you using that precise turn of phrase before now.”
I held up my hand to halt the onslaught of words, for I was feeling much affected.  I was not well acquainted with the lady, but had found her, on our brief meeting, to be a kind and gentle character, and I knew she was beloved of her nephew, who was surely suffering the keen loss.
Oaks shrugged.  “Selling Macassar oils, most likely.  Ha!  Mrs. Donald from the inn told me his name.”  Oaks scratched his head.  “A Mr. Parrow, yes, that's right.  That's all I know.  Now, let me scrub these new potatoes and we'll get 'em on the boil, what do you say.”
“What in blazes do you mean, and what have you done?”  I edged into the room, now cautious for the booby-trap.  “What was the smash?”
nice to see you, Dr. Watson,” she said, rustling her skirts as we both tramped our boots up seventeen steep steps to Sherlock Holmes.
“Ah, Dawkins, do allow me to continue,” said he, smiling.  “You are confusing our two friends here.”  Stone addressed us: “It is a meditative session.  The skull is a very old and precious stone.  Mr. Dawkins hopes to tour with it, but for the moment it remains here where stone enthusiasts – like us – can share some space and time and thought.”
“Watson, do you recall the conversation a while ago with Mrs. Barker?  Yes?  Well, what struck you as odd about it?  Was there anything?”
“There is nothing to keep us in Surrey,” replied Chico.  “I have some gardening work in the village next but yonder, but it won't last for very long.  We could move around a bit or we might go back to Cuba, mightn't we, ma?”
He came, like that, around me, as I fucked him with my hand, his body shaking, eyes tight shut, ungodly moaning, jerking, reaching, blindly pulling at my hair.
We moved across, and sat.  Here Holmes seemed greatly ill at ease.  “You must be wondering what this is all about,” he said.  “Do you recall, a while ago, you declared you were unshockable?”
“Oh, it was murder.  Attempted blackmail on his part; the would-be victim was of sterner stuff than Ramsey gave them credit for.  I have political connections... as I believe I may have mentioned.  I was informed that our MP had played that game before, so he might supplement his gambling addiction.”
I climbed them on my tip-toes, and I did not know quite why.  The door to Holmes's sitting-room was open, and I paused there on the mat and peeped inside.
“That is a good job, then – and I hope you will not mock me, but I have been anxious these past days, and I heard you were a helpful sort of fellow, and I was in the area anyway, and so I--”
We kissed again by the front door, and softly, gently, took our time.  “Thank you for trusting me,” I said.  I snubbed his nose.  I pressed my lips against his throat, and tongued a line of butterflies up to his ear, which I nipped sharply with my teeth.  He whined a little, jerking, twitching.  “When can I see you next?” I asked.

He glared.  “That's really not the point,” he said.  “The point is, there's no coffee.  And I'd rather like some toast.”
“I think perhaps I might have met my match,” said Holmes, as he now dithered with the bacon dish.  “I have the

“It's just his way,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “When you come to know him better, then you'll understand.”  She laughed again on seeing my expression.  “Now, would you like a cup of tea, or have you other calls to make?”
“Holmes,” I said, “I admire how you remain able to contort yourself just so, but you are sitting in the dark.  Whatever for?  You are not, to the best of my knowledge, a
“I have less than no idea,” said Holmes.  His fingers flickered at my trouser front.  “Oh-ho, I can feel it.  How about if I.... hmm?”
My friend huffed, and flushed pinker.  He chivvied at the paper, and used his handkerchief to mop up the white residue.  He pounced upon the rubber as if it were a twitching mouse.  All of these things he thrust into the spacious pocket of his dressing gown.
For a moment I was fearful he might scuttle off in fury, for his brows converged, his eyes tightened to slits.
I shook his hand before he took his leave.  He stared at me, as if I were a puzzle he was baffled by.  I watched him from my window as he hurried down the street and turned the corner out of sight.
“Oh yes,” I said.  “That bird.”  I laughed.  “But still, I can't see how you lost the bottle in the lumber room to start with.”
“Well, that is what I do.” Holmes settled back into his chair and thrust two fingers and a thumb into the shag tobacco pouch.  A hearty pinch filled up his pipe, and now I watched him as he struck a match and took his first draw of the day.  He sighed in satisfaction, and burrowed down in the brocade and closed his eyes.
“Such as getting dressed,” I said.  I ignored his disbelieving snort, and made my way along and then inside the parlour, and so into the bedroom to my patient, who was sitting, smiling, propped against her pillows.
Holmes paid a visit to Lestrade while I lingered in the hallway, reading the bulletins on the noticeboard.  I paid little mind to Inspector Gregson who came sniffing at my heels, no doubt for tidbits on the case.  He rattled on for several minutes, but of what I could not tell, so deeply furrowed was my brain as I still rolled the facts within it.
Some few days later, I had packed all my possessions in the rooms above my practice at Upper Wimpole Street.  I'd still be working there, of course – at least, for the time being – but I was thrilled to think of 221B Baker Street as home.
Sherlock Holmes opened his mouth as if he were about to snap, but thought the better of his rudeness and pulled the drawbridge tight again.  He drummed his fingers on the chair arm.  “Very well,” said he, “I'll see what I can do.”
“There was a queue inside the bakery.  And then I rested on the green, and watched the ducks.”  I perched atop the bed and laid my hand upon his hip.  “Did you get very far with your job?”
“Ramsey takes the letters, hoping to torment his victim, whereupon they whip their pistol from their pocket and fire a bullet at his head, killing him outright.  And he tumbles back, like
“Perhaps she's now drowning herself,” said my friend.  He sat down by the fire and picked up a book.  I drew the curtains, and joined him, although not set for reading.  I fell into thought, of the day we had spent, and the days yet to come.  Such a series of firsts – our first meal, our first night, then the first dawning of day.  I wondered if there might be snow.  I hoped that I might venture out tomorrow, and explore the cliffs and beach, or even wander into Fulworth, the nearest village to our farm.  I said as much to Holmes.  “Well, I might join you,” he replied, “for we have unpacked all the boxes, and there is not much left to do except to tidy.”
Sherlock Holmes released a lungful of held air; he may have held it for the length of my sad speech, I could not tell.  He rose.  I looked at him in fear.
“Oh, yes, she is much better, Doctor, yes, thank you, after the course of treatment you recommended.  We really cannot thank you enough.  Elizabeth said to me – and yes, she truly did –
“Aha!” I exclaimed, as the light dawned at last.  “Holmes, do you really want me to hit this, when you spent such a long time on its construction?”
“I learned a little more without that idiot Lestrade,” said he.  “Why, Watson, whatever are you smirking at?”
I explained.  Halfway through my explanation, Holmes stubbed his cigarette and heaved himself to vertical; he smoothed out the slight creasing in his waistcoat, and cast a look out of the window.  “You barely know him,” he remarked.
“Watson, I'm ravenous,” said he.  “It must be all this country air.  I always knew there was a reason why I loathed it.”
, and to present a cup of tea.  I listened to the clatter of the typewriter; of a murmured conversation with our housekeeper, and the clicking of the boot heels as they tidied, swept and bustled round the house.
“It's best you make the break,” he said, with effort.  “It's the grandest opportunity.  Who knows, one day you'll have your own place, with your name upon the door.”
“One moment, please,” said Dawkins.  “I cannot do all things at once, and someone has to watch the shop.  Stone, I trust you, sir, here is the key.  Please do be careful.”
Gregson smiled and moved away.  “It is all right.  It shall be our secret.  Just as long as it doesn't happen again, eh.”
“Watson,” Adams continued, “do you mind if Mr. Dooley here swaps places at the dinner table later on tonight?  His place was next to you, you see, but there's an empty spot by me, and, well, we thought...?”
.”  Friends or lovers?  He had avoided my question.  I thought of him in the arms of a woman, and flinched, for the pain was acute.  Yet it must have been so; for he had answered as much to my question the previous evening.
The next morning, being Saturday, we set off for Pall Mall.  Holmes had been quiet the previous evening, retiring to bed at ten o'clock.  It had seemed to me a meditative silence, and so I joined him in his whimsy, staunching my babble and my questions.  And now with the spring air upon us, the sun bright in the sky, I felt my spirits rise once more.
“Yes,” Holmes replied, “but all the same, don't get carried away, John.  You and your hypotheses.  But, my goodness, these rural areas and their medics.  Should it really take such an eon to determine the cause of death?  And then there is the matter of the old crone who hangs by the gate, as Victor informs us.  What involvement might she have?  Well, it might be merely a curious local, but still – our man is on his nerves there at that house alone, and with so much to be done.  We had best take the next train to Surrey.  And I suppose we should pack for an overnight stay.  Our fellow's state might well wish for some moral support.”
My eyes, which had been closed in heady bliss now flickered open.  Holmes was gazing down, the sincerest expression on his face.
“Oh,” I said.  “I see.”  I raised my hand nervously and patted the curl.  It seemed blissfully unaware of the fuss it was causing its anxious owner.  “I am dreadfully sorry, Holmes.  I, er...”  I hesitated.  “Er, is there anything wrong with the curl?”
“How nice,” I said.  I left my room and followed Mycroft down the stairs once more and into the front drawing room, where a small group had gathered, talking, by the window.
“Oh!”  I followed the direction of his finger-point, and traced it to the table.  “Oh!  I didn't notice.”  On my own plate, a neat white envelope.  “I don't recognise the writing.”
“My name is Sherlock Holmes,” my friend replied.  “You may wish to sit down, sir, and you too, Mrs. Bruce.  I have some unfortunate news.”
With a free hand I roved his front, caressed his maypole through the twill, and decided that I should like to dance around it, if he were willing.  I said as much aloud, and almost broke the mood entirely.
"I'm fine" Sherlock blinked, still focused on the warmth of John's palm that was seeping through the material of his trousers.
"I thought you knew everything," Mycroft taunted in response and Sherlock marched over to the umbrella stand in the next room and pulled out said shoe horn, throwing it at his brother's head.
With the final decision of breaking back into the school and spending the day in the chemistry lab he packs his coat pockets full of some of his best test-tubes, not intent on making do with the chipped school-provided ones; and leaves through the back door.
"I think that it's none of your business" John snarled, his mind flashing back to the first time he had seen Mycroft Holmes, the cold demeaning manner he'd had with Sherlock, the condescending tone of his voice.
Dr Watson had shown unexpected caretaker qualities towards Sherlock, which threw his deductions off-guard. No teacher had ever asked him if he was 'okay', the thing that threw Sherlock off even more was that he wasn't even sure how to respond to that question.
“No, Holmes,” I said, touched beyond foolish words.  “You did nothing wrong.  It was immensely thoughtful, and such a lovely surprise.  Thank you, my dear fellow, thank you again.”
,” he said.  “But all the rest of me...”  Holmes shook his head.  “I've never had to answer to the rest of me before.  It's an odd feeling, and I'm not sure that I like it.”  He held out his hand.  I grasped it, and I held on for dear life.  “Watson,” he said, screwing his eyes tight shut, “I want us to continue, but I'm telling you, if anything like this happens again, then I--”
, and tramped her way towards the gate, we watched her tracking footprints deep and heavy in the pile.  We were alone again, at last, with no intention of poking noses out for the fear of being frozen off.
“Thank you,” I said softly.  There seemed so much more I could say, but I could not think what.  My tongue was tied dumb.  My friend seemed similarly affected; he turned to depart.  The door clicked shut.  I listened while he padded down the stairs, entered the sitting-room, and from there into his bedroom.  All was now quiet.
“I doubt it, Mycroft,” said my friend.  He hauled me upwards to the Green Room, where we set to with a bowl of soapy water and a sponge.  When we had made ourselves presentable once more, we traipsed back downstairs to the drawing room, where Adams was now sitting by the window, deep in thought.  We made him jump, a little, at our entrance, but he greeted us quite cheerfully.
My friend continued with his pencil work.  I plied him with a sandwich and a piping cup of tea, which he accepted.  I craned over his shoulder at his scribble, and saw a long list of addresses of the local antique shops.
The reading kept him busy for ten minutes, after which he became pensive and retired to his bedroom.  From within I detected the sound of dresser drawers opening, closing, a faint metal clatter.  I wondered what was happening.  I supposed that I should know before too long.
We drank the tea and ate the sandwiches.  At my request Holmes wound the phonograph, and we listened to the Hoffmann Barcarolle.  It was a pleasant interlude, and we talked of books and plays, and of a theatre trip to London in the not too distant future.  On our last visit we had called on Mrs. Hudson, and learned that she was still seeking lodgers for those 'light and airy rooms', and just how no-one did pass muster, how strange it was, and how she missed us.  “Just enjoy the peace and quiet,” said Holmes, “after twenty-two years of loud chaos.”
“John, mind your boots,” said Holmes, side-stepping.  He pulled his watch out from his pocket and frowned at the time.  “Well, we should get back to the task at hand – which is
“Mr. Talmadge did not leave a will, of course.  You were a faithful servant.  Had he made a written promise or verbal mention of your future being provided for, Mrs. Barker?”
“You tricked him, then,” I said, impressed.  “But Holmes, what will happen to Mrs. Barker now?  And what of the skull?”
“Last night you wanted me,” he snapped.  He swept a hand across his face and through his hair.  His features softened.  “And I wanted you,” he said.
I may have been mistaken, but a knowing smile relayed across that lady's face.  “I'll show you up,” said she, and did so without more ado.
I took two steps and pulled the door open a head's width.  A man was standing there, with duffle bag in hand.  He was so striking, so extraordinary, my heart beat upside down.  I stood and gawked at him, his eyebrows raised in question, as my own danced the quadrille.
“Please, Mr. Holmes, do read this letter.  It is of the same handwriting as the others, but I do not understand what it can be about.  It was pushed through the letterbox last evening.”
We made it to the dining room with five minutes still to spare.  Victor Burroughs was at table, albeit looking rather green.  He waved a hand in muted greeting.  As it dropped back to the cloth it made a lunge for a toast triangle.
“Well, yes, that's as it should be,” replied the older man.  “She loved you, yes, she did, and I see your gentle spirit for myself, with you having only spoken a few words.”
I found myself drawn to the jewellery display, an octagonal case to one side of the counter.  Holmes tutted and sighed (for he loathed most forms of shopping), and left me alone to my browse.  I was only five minutes, but his face was a pinched irritation by the time I rejoined him back out on the street.
“You were about to ask to have your stitches removed,” I told him – for otherwise, if not now, it would never be done.
“One more day!” he wailed.  He stopped abruptly then, seeing my face.  “I mean to say, that's very good.  Thank you.”
And then – this time, at last – a sign of life.  The light went out.  The house was dark completely now, and answer came there none.
I was fast about my travel, and I wound up on his doorstep before nine o'clock.  His landlady was pleasant as she showed me up the stairs towards his rooms which, as I saw, were large and comfortable and handsomely laid out.
“Mrs. Hudson with the tea,” said Holmes, his ears attuned to sounds from half a mile away, it seemed.  He sprang up, strode to the door and pulled it open.  Mrs. Hudson, with the tea tray, blinked up uncertainly, her boots about to set upon the landing, but her nose a-twitch in itching curiosity.  “Yes, thank you, Mrs. Hudson, very kind of you, most kind.”  Holmes drew the tray into the room and closed the door.  “Sandwiches
“Maybe as not, but I thought that you might help me find who the fellow is, and sort him out, like.”
We were shown into the sitting room, whereupon the maid scuttled off to find our friend.  I looked about in reminiscence.  Nothing had been altered, as far as I could tell.  The furnishings were still old and slightly tattered.  Such ornaments as had been placed upon the mantel and the shelves were rubbed and jaded; much beloved, I assumed.
“I would far rather we talk of the theatre now, or Goethe, or Poe,” said Holmes.  “If only to save poor John here from internal combustion.”
“I am an impossible man,” he said softly.  “You will see that in time, and you'll leave, just like everyone else.”
The smell of rotting eggs is hardly a pleasant one, even with the windows open.  With the lack of anything resembling a breeze to disperse the invasion, I flung open the sitting-room door.
“E..L..O..,” said he.  “I cannot think of any one whose first or second name begins with these three letters.  Can you, John?”
“Is Oaks still here?” my friend enquired.  “I meant to ask about the ladder to the attic.”  His arm released me, and he rolled up both his shirt-sleeves, and unfastened the top two buttons of his shirt.  “It's warm,” he said, by dint of any explanation.
He pulled me over to the policemen, two of whom were in plain-clothes.  I learned their names: Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade.  The former was a friendly fellow who engaged me in discussion on my history and more, until my arm was tugged and Holmes led me away.
Gregson all this time was eyeing each of us in turn.  His mouth was downturned.  “Are you busy, John?”
“Dr. Watson's here to help us,” Holmes replied.  “You don't mind, do you?”  He did not wait for a reply, but barrelled through to the large sitting-room beyond, a sharp tug on my sleeve to chivvy me along.  The room was bright, with an oppressive weight regardless – largely due to the dead body on the rug at the far side of it.  Lestrade had tagged behind; he watched us take in the strange scene before he uttered – rather pompously I thought: “We've had a thorough look, I doubt there's much left to be found.  It's suicide, of course.  I said so from the first.”
I mooned around the sitting-room, at a loss for what to do.  It was then I saw the tome upon the hearthrug, propped upright against the side of Holmes's chair.  I picked it up, glanced at the cover.  I confess I had not read it – for mental health was not my field – but my friend deemed it important, it was clear, by his twice-referencing today.  It had no marker, so I flipped past the title pages and acknowledgements to the chapter list.  I wondered which of these had fascinated Holmes:
John gave him a teasing look, taking a bite from one of the biscuits he'd laid out on a plate. "What, you mean you can't just deduce it?"
John felt his stomach drop immediately, and Sherlock was sitting up quickly, moving towards John with a hand on his shoulder and taking the phone from his hand. He blinked rapidly as Sherlock frowned down at the message, trying to dampen down a potential panic attack.
"It's okay," John comforted him, his hand going straight to the back of Sherlock's head. "It's okay. Let's go."
John had never been particularly unconfident with his body, he'd been in good shape since he was a teenager, knowing that he had to be if he were to be accepted into the army at 18. He knew he wasn't anywhere near Adonis or David level, but he was vaguely proud of how he'd managed to maintain his fitness over the years as he aged. Nothing, though, had prepared him for this.
"Everything you're doing clearly isn't working, so why don't you take the next step? If you think he's in Scotland, get up there!" A voice somewhere in the back of Greg's head told him that he was probably being a bit too pushy, but his conscience wanted to scream and shout at Mycroft Holmes for just
Greg felt sick to his stomach. He didn't know Sebastian, but he'd heard of the sly little rat. Skinny little thing in the lower sixth, clearly a trust fund baby chucked into public school by stuck up parents who didn't care for a trouble-making homosexual son tarnishing their reputation. Or at least that's what he'd been told by Stamford when he'd first asked about him.
"C'mere.." John motioned towards himself, not content on Sherlock being sat so far away. The genius lifted himself from his seat, settling in next to John with a familiar ease as if they'd been doing it for decades. "You're so thoughtful." John kissed his temple, consenting when Sherlock tilted his head backwards in search of his lips. The doctor wondered how anyone could have ever seen Sherlock as cold, distant and uncaring, if only they had taken the time to stop and learn and
John spun around desperately trying to locate the head of curly hair, but knowing he wasn't the tallest person there made it impossible, and his heart was panicking in his chest, beating wildly and palms sweating.  "I haven't seen him since lunch-time, he told me he'd be in Chemistry all afternoon" John croaked.
"Of course I do." John frowned in bewilderment, wondering how the boy could even doubt it. "In fact, I can't remember a time when I didn't feel so frustratingly and wonderfully head over heels for you, Sherlock Holmes."
"Of course. It's just...not a realistic situation." John shook his head, scratching his fingernails against the grain of the polished wooden surface of the bar.
"I had." Mycroft tilted his head. "I was hoping you would have stopped trying by now." he sighed, scrunching up a clean napkin in front of him on the table.
"I'm trying to keep us warm." John grouched back. He'd begun moving the covers from underneath their legs in an attempt to pull them over the two bodies, feeling the chill of the air on their naked legs.
"I'd estimate- about 25-30 years old, African Mahogany, going by the rich grain and colour, and-" Sherlock moved over to the nearest natural light source, examining the wood closely, "Yes. Definitely, it has a slight shimmer in certain light. Amateur craftsmanship, so- kept for sentimental purposes then. I'd say the carver had 2-3 years experience, but the wood is worn, it has scratches, dents over time- so, it's been kept for a long time, handed about. Here I would normally estimate a man in his late 60s to be the original owner, but infuriatingly, since I don't yet have enough data on male figures of your family, I cannot decisively say who. I would guess, however, that this was originally owned by your father or grandfather, and carved for a woman of interest, both of whom are now deceased, which must be why you now have ownership."
"My opinions?" John sighed, crossing his legs. "Well, they aren't particularly high ones, I'll say that. He's a known homophobe, for one."
"Mr Holmes?" a vaguely familiar voice sounded from behind him. He turned to face his newly appointed assistant. She'd only worked for him for about a week prior to his departure, but he found himself not hating her as profusely as he had all his previous assistants.
"You're not falling asleep, are you?" John asked, watching Sherlock's silent form, side profile glowing in the lamp-light, steepled hands under his chin as he lay still naked in the bed. John had returned with two tall glasses of water and a wet face-cloth, which landed on Sherlock's stomach with a slap and a hiss at the cold fabric. They'd managed to clean up quite quickly, cracking open a window to release some heat from the room and immediately returning to each other under the duvet.
John remained silent and waited for their drinks to appear in Matthew's hands. And if John felt the brush of the young man's suggestive fingers against his own, he didn't say anything. Because he wasn't interested in hands that weren't calloused from the strings of the violin, or hands without a scar on the knuckle of the left forefinger from where chemicals had been spilled without the care-taking that John had insisted upon. Wasn't even interested in the smile sent his way that John deemed as hollow because it wasn't full of the enigma that Sherlock's lips held.
Some of the most memorable being simple competitions of who could talk over each other the loudest to get their opinion across, or literally trying to lock Sherlock in his classroom so he would be forced to endure their tutor sessions without a way of escape. Greg thought himself quite clever after that one, that was until Sherlock pointed out there were 5 different escape routes he could have utilised during the entire meeting before strolling out the door, the tail of his coat disappearing round the corner.
"Why do you want to know something weird like that?" she said, clearly judging the suited man on the other end of the line.
He heard the sound of running water, followed by the zip of John's toiletry bag; and the doctor appeared in the doorway.
He lifted Sherlock's hips under his hands as he approached climax, his hot tongue sliding down the short stretch of flesh to place a final deft lick to Sherlock's puckered entrance, the final straw before the younger man was crying out, shooting stripes of come against his stomach, hand fisted tightly around his cock.
John smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling only slightly, revealing his age in contrast to Sherlock's flawless pale skin; and let his hand be trapped between Sherlock's fingers.
Surprised to be addressed, the teacher looked up to Sherlock, exposing the suppressed panic in his eyes. Sherlock had been driving for two hours before he noticed the sudden increase of shiftiness, John had been checking his phone, biting his nails, tapping his foot, glancing out of the window often, and a slight sheen of sweat had begun to form around his hairline.
"Plus I would probably be skinned alive by your brother, and he would have me ejected from the country for high treason or something equally ridiculous and terrifying-"
"Sherlock," she scolded, noticing the puddle on the floor where green liquid had seeped down the side of the bench. "The mess you've made"
"Sherlock, he literally just joined the school two hours ago. What has made you so detestable of him?"
"No, thank you." Sherlock said from where he stood, his voice another tone deeper, the gravel in his throat reminiscent of the times he would speak straight after a cigarette. John couldn't resist smirking.
"Do what?" Greg asked, uncomfortably perching himself on the edge of his desk, a hesitant hand hovering over his student's shoulder before clasping it encouragingly.
John looked up to the clock, only having just gotten into school himself, an hour before school even began. "Are you just letting yourself in now?" He challenged, sinking back into his chair and wincing at the twinge of pain coming from his leg.
"Come here," John pleaded with a mixture of affection and fear appearing in his voice. Sherlock stood stock still, his dress shoes scuffing against the floor and his hair blowing persistently in the breeze as he returned cautiously to John.
"As always, John, you underestimate me." Sherlock smiled crookedly at the confusion on the doctor's face, finally driving off down the road and turning onto the main road, putting his foot down.
Sherlock felt the coldness of the metal seep through to the skin of his back as John pressed him against the car one more time, hands strong and sure, yet managing to be careful, caressing. Sherlock never thought he would get so much enjoyment from running his fingers through the layers of John's thick hair, but couldn't seem to stop himself.
He noticed Sherlock's breathing becoming lighter, and stroked his hand over the ridiculously smooth warmth of his skin, marvelling at the infallible stretch of white, barely broken in pattern by a stray mole or occasional scar. He felt his pulse in the crease of his elbow, slow and at resting rate, and overall proving Sherlock's vulnerability, his human-ness. So many others, including Sherlock himself, appeared to believe he was something robotic, void of most hindrances such as human emotion.
"I am eighteen, legal to make my own decisions." Sherlock frowned at his former teacher, crossing his arms stubbornly across his chest.
"Soon I will know everything there is to know." Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes dancing like blue pools of excitement.
"Okay, maybe not to you, but you don't find anybody intimidating. I'm authoritive to others." John insisted, and Sherlock noticed the way Dr Watson's arms come to fold close against his chest to give the illusion of height and power.
"I can imagine you here," John admitted, looking up at the man next to him. "Running around with a tiny microscope, conducting your mould experiments and measuring the consistency of snail trails."
The sound of passing cars filtered through his consciousness as Sherlock remained silent, mirroring the position John had held moments ago, looking down at his hands. His own mobile buzzed in his pocket.
He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Okay." he agreed, wondering what it was he was even getting himself involved in, as Mycroft imperceptibly nodded back to him.
Sherlock scowled at him and pushed open the closest window, observing the people milling around on the concrete outside, as the remains of last night's bout of snow had settled in the corners and some surfaces. Sherlock supposed that they were about to do something completely mundane like start a
Mycroft sat back in his chair as the line went dead, turning his swivel chair to the large map of Britain beside him. He pushed a red pin into the title of Birmingham, and wondered at the vast possibilities with which he was suddenly faced with.
"There couldn't be a better time." Sherlock insisted from where he lay on the bed. "Don't think I can't see how the strain of secrecy attached to our relationship has affected your health."
"Colin." Dr Watson tipped his head to the teacher, watching in amazement as he waddled away from John down the corridor.
Molly nodded enthusiastically, as John seemed to notice she responded to most things with eagerness. "I love it there"
"I did offer." John raised his eyebrows, still smiling fondly at him, and traced his fingers along the seam of the sofa arm.
John pulled a face to himself, trying to think of an accurate word to describe Sherlock Holmes. "It's...different " he supplied.  "I don't really know what to expect if I'm honest, mate" John ran a hand over his face.
As soon as he entered the staff room there were eyes on him. He headed straight over to the coffee machine, brushing shoulders with Greg Lestrade who instantly asked him what all of the other teachers were probably thinking.
He huffed, taking another sip of his now cold tea. He glanced at the clock, which read 1.10pm, and decided to give the man until 2pm to call him before he sought out Mycroft's number and called him for a change.
"You are welcome." A small smile appeared as the tenseness drained ever so slightly from his posture, nerves melting away. "Now you can stop calling yourself ancient, I will not hear any more incorrect assumptions."
"John-" Sherlock frowned, glancing over to the man for the fifth time in the last two minutes. "What is the matter with you?"
Sherlock crowded John in under the porch as soon as they reached it, allowing himself to bare the weather whilst John stayed dry, fumbling for the key in his pockets.
Greg stood decisively, his feet heading towards the door automatically, he stopped himself, clearing his throat audibly and addressing Mycroft, "Where are we going?"
Returning to school on a Monday morning and being greeted by the usual slurs of 'freak', 'psychopath' and 'weirdo ' was to Sherlock, predictable and tiresome beyond belief.
After saving Sherlock's contact details, John decided to actually leave the car park, placing his phone on the passenger seat beside him and strapping on his seatbelt. He made it to a second set of traffic lights before checking his phone again.
Feeling the coldness of the wall seep through his shirt and onto his back, John realised how trapped he actually was by the cage of Sherlock's arms either side of his head, pinned in place by the determined look in his student's eyes.
"I haven't started it" Sherlock admitted, knowing it would infuriate his tutor to no end after he had asked Sherlock at least 20 times to at least begin writing it.
Sherlock smiled fondly at the sleepy state of the man opposite him. "We should stop for the night, we're both tired."
"What was that?" John said around the kiss, his hands reaching for Sherlock who was suddenly passionate, lips claiming John's with what seemed like the power and experience of someone at least 15 years his senior.
"Have you said goodbye to John yet? It was your last Biology exam, after all. I'm sure he'd appreciate a visit from you, Sherlock." Greg suggested innocently enough, his eyes trained on the groups of students around them.
"Good morning." he said after a short while, pulling back to survey John's equally tired looking face.
"I'm sorry, John. I never know what to do in these situations." John saw the thoughts racing behind Sherlock's eyes and a smile stretched across his face.
John tried not to make it obvious he was watching the young man and turned his eyes to the papers on his desk students had handed in at the end of class. Sherlock in turn bought his paper up and slid it onto the top of the pile, pursing his lips with a frown when John thanked him.
when John did that. It explained why he got up every morning to make John's tea and toast, it explained why he wanted John to have everything, anything he wanted.
"You took my skull" he pouted at her, staring wistfully at the head resting atop her box of bin-bags.
His eyes softened with Sherlock's gaze upon him, and he gestured for him to join him on the sofa. The lanky teen hauled himself up and deposited himself at John's side, pleased at how the teacher's arm automatically fell across his shoulders, pulling him closer to his body.
This also meant that Mrs Hudson had acquired the presence of the familiar gangly teenage form, who had been spending much more of his time in her company. She didn't seem to mind, considering she'd had no children, Sherlock felt like a son to her, or perhaps a grandson, considering the age between the two.
"Yes", Sherlock ended the call and tossed the phone onto the leather upright button-embellished sofa in Mycroft's overcrowded office.
"It's no problem at all, happy to help." John smiled reassuringly at her, and lifted a hand to wave her goodbye as she turned the handle and left.
"Closer, John." he gasped, pulling at the doctor's buttocks, edging his jeans and boxers down in the process, until the head of his cock was visible through the grey boxer briefs. The pressure in the room was unbelievable, both men sweating from exertion, pulling their bodies against each other, as John lined up his semi- clothed cock with Sherlock's, rutting hard against the hard and pliant body beneath him, spurred on by Sherlock's tense grip on his arse.
"No, no-" John insisted, his eyes searching for Sherlock's as the younger man began to turn towards the exit. "You should have- don't leave, please."
The teacher turned, facing an elegantly dressed younger man, minus the usual umbrella or cane. His tie-pin glistened in the centre of his attire, light reflecting from the luxurious chandeliers. "Mycroft."
John stood, his hands over his face, trying to take deep breaths and figure out how he could get his student out of his house before Sherlock's brother came knocking.
alone, not merely alone for the moment, for five minutes until Lestrade or Mrs Hudson came barging in, but alone.
He passed him in a huff when he rounded the corner towards the exit, resolutely ignoring Anderson's sly comment about
He heard Sherlock exhale through his nose as their lips moved against each other, pulling a sharp intake of breath from John himself as the heady atmosphere settled in, and John was suddenly aware of Sherlock's intoxicating scent.
"I don't care what people think-" Sherlock replied, his voice turning harder with the childish petulance John had come to recognise as the young man's sense of pride and stubbornness.
"Actually, I'm not sure you do." He replied, a mixture of good-natured joking and a hint of sorrow. John lead him to the next room with a hand on his shoulder, and decided to file the parents question away for another time.
"I mean- I would lose my job, and...you would be in so much trouble, probably expelled, because of your reputation. And the things people would think about me, probably about you too, I just- I don't want to ruin any chance you've got at a successful and happy life."
Greg Lestrade's frustration was at boiling point after being asked to go on duty at lunch-time, after a loud complaint to whomever of his colleagues were listening in the staff room that period, he had stomped off to his post to stand and watch over bratty children for an hour, the voice at the back of his head reminding him how much shit he was going to be in for being so behind on marking.
"Try one," Sherlock said after a moment of watching John sift through a few on the rack, kilts suddenly forgotten.
John tried so desperately hard not to let his eyes follow downwards when Sherlock's shirt lifts and exposes the tiniest show of pale skin, his hipbone jutting out from his skinny frame.
I sat there for many minutes, in heady bliss at this close contact with an article of clothing so freshly worn close to his skin.  I imagined us then, both upon the bed, without our shirts; in fact without any damn discretion whatsoever.  I was thus lost within my fantasy: of my manhandling him into some pliant tangle, where he might find himself – to his surprise – imploring me to breach him without mercy, when –
that you keep picking up?” I enquired, feeling by now somewhat frustrated.  “Do they have any bearing on what might have occurred?”
Inside our room, we sat apart and read, and smoked.  From time to time we read out passages that moved us, or impressed us, and we found an easy stillness in the inbetween.  The measure of good friendship is the value of the silence, after all.  We made no mention of the evening, or the coming night, but pondered it internally and privately.  And by and by, we set our books aside and dressed for dinner, knowing that before too long we would be bound – with all that that entailed.
“And I am Dr. John Watson,” I interjected.  “Mr. Holmes's trusted biographer and friend.  And I am off on a nice walk, and so I bid you a good day, sir.”
I took his hand, fair brazen from the freedom and the solitude we had found ourselves within.  I squeezed it, twice.  A silent code.
The water bowl was empty when we paused upon the outside step.  The terrier was nowhere to be seen.  We shook Victor's hand, made our promises and farewells, and left the cluttered gables for the swelter of old London.
Sherlock had never felt so possessive over something before. Never felt so vulnerable. Never felt like such a man. Never felt like he had the world at his feet. John Watson was the missing piece, the crucial part that Sherlock didn't even realise was absent.
"Look, he's a young adult himself now, you can't control his actions. There's nothing you could've done."
John squeezed his eyes shut from the sight of his dishevelled student stood before him, tamed down the wild arousal thrumming and buzzing underneath his skin and tried not to focus on the husky tone of Sherlock's deep voice.
"Sherlock-" John called again, only to notice that the student was cradling something in his arms, dropping down from the tree immediately to lay it out against the pavement. A tiny baby bird, entangled in a muddy plastic bag.
instead of previous observers whom Sherlock had noticed immediately, accusing them of having as much stealth as elephants in a library.
"We're alone." he said, his voice barely above a whisper, and John realised the truth behind his lover's words. They
Sherlock's final raised eyebrow was the end of the conversation, just as if he had been holding a gun pointed towards Mycroft, putting pressure on the trigger, Mycroft knew the danger that Sherlock was suggesting by threatening to run again.
He paused, meeting Sherlock's intense gaze. "That I am what?" he blinked, his voice deep in response to John's.
In fact, as hard as he tried to convince himself that Mycroft might be the tiniest bit interested in him, Greg was harshly reminded that he was but the smallest of cogs in Mycroft's enormous working machine, and was merely there as a tool to help him on his way. Not that he was surprised, all of his relationships had left him feeling insignificant. And lonely. And pathetic. And God he needed to get laid.
"Well...yes...maybe- but, not all of them." he scratched at the back of his head. "Dr Watson will be sad to see you go, I'm sure. We talked about you quite a bit when he first took over your class."
John turned back to Greg with a determined look in his eyes just before a roar of heat blasts glass from one of the large windows on the second floor, crackling with a hiss and a wave of heat.  John ignored the screams and continued to run.
"I'm British, it's what we do." Sherlock insisted with a small smile, which grew considerably at the answering giggle that escaped John's lips.
He had heard about him, through Lestrade, about how he was driving the tutor round the bend with his stubborn and impatient nature that only seemed to be amplified by the recent restriction he was being put under from having no access to the labs in-school.
Sherlock hesitated, which went un-noticed by Lestrade who was still insisting to the student to correct his unkempt uniform. "Perhaps."
He broke away from John's lips with a gasp, his head moving to the left, leaving John's lips at the space underneath Sherlock's ear, breathing heavily. "We should probably leave." he said.
"Are you seriously smoking right now, Sherlock? Seriously?" John scolded as soon as he rounded the corner, raising his voice at the man with the lighter in his hand.
He watched the man shuck off his suit jacket, revealing the matching waistcoat underneath that was still buttoned fully, the navy tie at his neck looking more like a strangling device. Greg had no idea how he survived in those suits all day, he counted his lucky stars that the dress code for teachers at work was smart-casual.
John wasn't sure if it was his tiredness convincing him that Sherlock's voice sounded so fond, nevertheless, he didn't have a chance to determine where the emotional haze had come from, as he drifted into sleep. Sherlock remained on the other side of the line until John's breathing slowed, eventually hanging up after the sound of what could only be described as a snuffle.
John pulled himself up, scrambling off the bed and towards Sherlock who looked as though he were being approached by a mass murderer. He held his hands out to request distance, and John paused, his chest rising and falling with short of breath.
"Just some nonsense threat, the usual." Sherlock shrugged. The longer he watched John, the more apparent the doctor's stress became. "He can't do anything."
John snapped instantly, zeroing in on his student. "Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're-"
He greeted her in silence as she handed him a travel-cup of tea and gestured for him to follow her to the car parked on the tarmac. "As usual, passport control will not be necessary. Would you like to go to Downing Street first? Or would you prefer to return home before your meeting?"
"It's going to die anyway," He ran after his student, noticing John in the distance turning away from the students that had gained his attention, "Sherlock!"
"What are you planning on doing when you're stuck up there with fear of coming down?" Sherlock teased.
Having stuffed themselves with packaged pastries and fresh coffee from a nearby petrol station, Sherlock had returned to the reception and handed in their keys with a flourish; thanking the irritated receptionist loudly in a broken French accent, effectively waking her from her peaceful daydream.
"You told me once that relationships were about sacrifice." Sherlock's voice broke through, and John found himself spinning back into his memories of the second time Sherlock had entered his home, they'd laid together on John's bed which was partly riddled with biscuit crumbs and Sherlock had tried to convince him to leave with him.
"You're gonna have to be more specific than that, love." John chuckled, rubbing his nose against Sherlock's.
John only just restrained himself from leaping at the boy, settling for curling his fists at his sides, his expression livid. "You watch your tone, boy." he snapped, and Sebastian laughed harshly, stepping around a lab bench and moving along the length towards the teacher.
Sherlock took a tentative sip from the hot drink, his lip curving over the edge of the cup. He wet his lips with a darting pink tongue after pulling away, and his eyes flicked immediately up to John's open blues. "Child's play." he smiled.
Sherlock folded the corner of his page, shutting the book and placing it on his lap as he dug through his mind for the memory. "I was frustrated...on paper you seemed so ordinary, boring, even."
"What does Stamford want?" the dark haired young man lay back on the bed, his long form stretched over the length of the headboard. John was just about to ask how Sherlock knew it was Mike from all the way over there when his phone chimed again.
Sherlock stares pitifully at the ceiling and wishes for something interesting to happen in the next five minutes. Of course, nothing does, and he stays there with his thoughts for the next three hours.
him." Sherlock replied, leaping up from his seat at once and gesticulating wildly in front of John's desk where he sat dumfounded.
"Doctor Watson-" Sherlock fumbled, berating himself at the blush reaching his cheeks. "What did you do? If you've threatened him, I swear I will-"
John placed the carving carefully back on the shelf, turning back to Sherlock's bright eyes, seeing the cogs turning in that incredible brain of his.
This last statement made Sherlock seem more angered as his face scrunched up in accusation. John shook his head, wondering if his face was such an open book or if this was the way that Sherlock generally communicated, forceful and intrusive.
John was quiet, tracing the leather of his arm-chair. "You shouldn't have to feel that way. I hope you don't expect the worst from me, Sherlock."
John looked around, knowing that his own regular parking space was quite secluded towards the back of the car-park, shadowed under the darkness of a large willow tree, creating flickering shadows in the dim light of the evening. Such a split-second decision made alarm bells ring in his head as he gestured for Sherlock to go around the car and come sit in the passenger seat next to him.
John was handing back past-papers, winding around the science benches and placing people's papers brandished with red or green pen, grades circled with marker.
He couldn't resist leaning over and pressing an up-side down kiss to Sherlock's open lips, lasting only a moment before he returning to his previous position. "Sorry-" he shrugged. "Couldn't resist the Spiderman kiss."
"Sherlock-" He gasped, hands at the younger man's hips now, feeling the roughness of barely-there stubble brushing against his own lips and chin, revelling in the dizziness of emotion and pleasure that plagued his senses, something he hadn't experienced in a long time just from kissing.
"Sherlock-" John's disapproving voice sounded from behind him, getting closer, while Greg stayed behind attempting to convince other students who were gathering round to see what all the fuss was about to return to their sampling.
"Hi, Sherlock" Dr Watson called out, chequered shirt tucked under thick oatmeal jumper and a sandalwood coloured satchel slung over his right shoulder, bulging with textbooks and ungraded papers.
"I haven't had time to think about it" Sherlock excuses absently, steeping his fingers underneath his chin.
"Good," Sherlock smirked to himself, pulling over the Biology textbook that John is using. "I'm glad."
Which is why he was sat at his kitchen table in silence, staring at the blank phone in his hand, with no plans whatsoever, waiting for it to light up with
"I'm still your teacher now, the circumstances work against us." He reached his hand across the void of the duvet, towards Sherlock.
A small smack of lips filled the silence as Sherlock pulled away, his eyes large and inquisitive, head tilted and reminding John immediately of some sort of curious woodland creature un-accustomed to its environment. John smiled, kissing the corner of Sherlock's stunned mouth, stealing one more kiss accompanied with the presence of his hand on Sherlock's angled face before moving away.
John shook his head, "No," he hesitates, and then jumps straight off the diving board and into the deep end. "You can call me John"
"What have you done?!" Sherlock growled in return, pushing harshly at Mycroft's chest again, until Mycroft retaliated, gripping Sherlock's arm in a sudden twist, putting pressure on his elbow. Sherlock yelped, bringing his knee up to knock Mycroft's arm away.
"Did you sleep well?" John said, pressing a kiss to the corner of Sherlock's mouth, smiling at the soft pull of Sherlock's hand in his hair which guided him back towards his lips in a proper kiss.
John's eyes fell to the way the creases smoothed out under his fingertips, stretched over solid chest muscles. He shook his head. "You can't do that," he insisted.
Sherlock had originally been awestruck by him, entranced. Immediately deducing James' age, he often found himself laying awake each night at the resort, staring at the ceiling and recounting James' gradual advancing actions towards him, recalling his elevated breathing rate and dilated pupils. Sherlock remained indifferent, himself.
"It's not you- really- it's..." John watched as the young man looked at the ground with what could only be described as a look of deep shame. "It's me."
"I just thought I'd let you know," The look on his face was a combination of thinly veiled disgust and suspicion. "This afternoon's meeting has been cancelled. I told Colin I'd let you know since I'd see you before he would."
"This is your class then?" Molly continued, happily jabbering on to herself, staring out the window at the passing traffic. "I have to say, some of them look so much older than eighteen. That one- Sherlock, was it? Strange name. Greg told me about him, I could hardly believe he wasn't a teacher when he told me, he looks-"
John watched him trail off uncertainly, and lifted one of his hands to card through his hair comfortingly "Okay," he said, kissing his temple. "Let's just take it slow."
John barely heard the voice speaking to him as he walked towards Sherlock, just nodded in Greg's general direction and tried to catch his breath. His eyes fell to Sherlock's hands, previously in his pockets or skittering along the splintered wood of the gate in front of him, now hanging loosely at his sides, fingers blocking the light of the setting sun.
John looked down at Sherlock's leather gloved hands, fiddling with the thick material of John's coat sleeve, which had been returned to him by Greg so he didn't freeze to death.
The servant opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by a new voice coming from behind Greg.  "Of course."
They were almost nearing the turn-off for Greg's neighbourhood when Mycroft heard a gasp from his left. "Shit!"
"Is it weird that I miss our Wednesdays?" John said tentatively after a moment, more light-heartedly.
The sound of the traffic and the clock ticking in the background became an absent buzzing in the back of his mind as Mycroft Holmes sighed, feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders. "If I am stable, I am in a better position to help Sherlock remain stable. Did he
John felt as though he'd been abducted again, like the time he was held captive once for 42 hours in Afghanistan. For some reason, Dr Watson felt significantly more intimidated sitting across from a gingery haired man wearing a full three piece suit, thin chain hanging from the pocket of his waist coat, and clutching onto a hefty black and metal cane than he'd felt with a masked Arabian man standing across from him pointing an AK47 at his head.
"You okay, mate?" he vaguely registered Greg's voice bringing his mind into consciousness and shook himself out of a daydream.
"Don't-" He starts, sliding his hand out of Sherlock's. "Just...Don't. I don't know what this is between us but-"
Sherlock hummed to him, his eyes flickering over a collection of taxidermy butterflies which contained rarer specimen than those he had in his case at home in London.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and ripped a paper towel off the roll on her trolley, bending and wiping it up in a single motion. "There, happy?"
Sherlock glared at him, mentally mapping out the 26 items that could be utilised for murder in the room.
"You have an irritating habit of underestimating yourself, John." Sherlock replied simply, taking the final bite of his biscuit.
"Allow me." Mycroft said and turned, his eyes on the ground, but hands outstretched to receive Lestrade's jacket.
"An adventure?" Sherlock drawled, his head pointedly turning to the drizzle of rain lingering in a mist outside their window. They'd been cuddled up on the sofa reading separate books for the last hour or two. "I'm not used to this adventurous side of yours. What happened to the John Watson who would find most of his excitement in Thursday nights' BBC dramas and miniseries?"
"Can't you get one of your... operatives, to do it for you?" Greg waved his hand absently towards the door leading to the collection of workers in the next room.
"Mycroft," he said, impatiently, moving to John's neck, seeking the location of the sensitive skin of his pressure point.
"Our mother." Mycroft looked away, out through the window onto the busy hustle and bustle of the streets of London.
"Do you really?" he asked after a second, pulling back to get another glimpse of John Watson's teary eyes.
"You've got Dr Watson now, right? He's a nice guy, good teacher too." Lestrade nodded to himself. "Have you driven him spare yet?"
"Trying to find someone who's desperate enough to fuck you, Sebastian? You've worked your way through most of the student body, gay and straight, so naturally now you're moving on to teachers, is that it?" Sherlock questioned, knowing he was right.
The head teacher watched the suited young man stroll out of the door in which he entered, his mouth agape, a deep frown creasing his face. He didn't even have a chance to formulate a response, before Mycroft disappeared around the corner.
"Well-" Mycroft broke off, checking his pocket watch. "I would make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you, goodbye Doctor Watson. See you
"Huh, what? Oh- sorry, mate- I'm just...not with it today." He blinked at the wall, shaking his head slowly.
That is until John intervened- again. ("Sherlock, out of all of us here, who is a qualified vet? Not you. So get moving, leave it to the professionals.")
Greg accepted the disc with grateful hands, sliding his thumb over the protective wallet, "Thank you." His eyes met Mycroft's in the dim light of the room, following the imperceptible nod that Mycroft responded with, with curious eyes.
John nodded, and Sherlock blinked back at him, before turning his head away and pushing down the door handle, stepping back out into the cold.
"I'm fine, John." Sherlock replied calmly, feeling his lover's thumb stroking at his temple. "Thank you." he said, a touch emotional at the extra care John was taking to ensure his happiness.
Greg watched as the other man tipped his glass to him, and they took their first simultaneous sips, the expensive whiskey burning the back of his throat as it slid down, ice clinking rhythmically in the amber liquid.
He slid off his suit jacket and unbuttoned his shirt in a haste, yanking at the zip of his trousers until he was stood in his boxers in front of the mirror, staring at the wide uncertain eyes in the reflection. His eyes slid down the pale expanse of his own skin, muscled in places, smooth and flat in others, smatterings of hair around scars, blemishes and marks of blush, the blush rising straight to his cheeks.
"We're close, Mycroft." he said, staring hard at him until the genius' eyes met his. "We'll find him."
"I- how do you do that?" John's cheeks began to fill with colour, his head shaking with confusion at how his student could seemingly read his thoughts with little difficulty.
John watched Sherlock blink down at his feet, the length of scratchy stubble decorating his jaw, creeping up towards the definition of his cheekbones. Already he felt like they'd changed. Not only on the outside, but the inside too, John knew they were more of a team now than they ever were. He knew he could lean on Sherlock as soon as he felt himself falling, and was desperate to be there to hold Sherlock up when he needed him.
Greg had estimated that Mycroft was at least 5 years his junior, despite the fact that he almost had the entirety of the British continent at his feet.
"And you-" Greg turned to the ambulance opposite, spotting Sherlock with his legs dangling, just out of John's viewpoint. "Why weren't you out as soon as the fire alarm sounded?" he cried, gesticulating in frustration.
He tried to steady himself, feeling like his head was spinning and crashing into unknown locations. Before he knew it, he was being pulled against John's solid chest, the wetness of sopping cloth not deterring Sherlock from pressing his face into his lover's shoulder.
"Maybe," John sighed. "Who knows anymore. But I can't take much more of this, being apart from you all the time. A few scattered minutes at school isn't enough."
His mouth snapped shut, and the light of amusement came into his eyes as he faced forward again, his mind steering towards thoughts that it was going to be an interesting end to the night indeed.
Mycroft spent the rest of the afternoon in his study, pouring over spliced final cut videos of CCTV recordings. It had become clear to him that Sherlock had replaced the number plate on John's car before departing from London, probably covered distinctive features of it too, just to make it more difficult for Mycroft to track.
John chuckled to himself, his biceps flexing as he tucked the loose towel in further against his hips. "Maybe..."
They curled down the stairs and then scattered once they hit the grass outside, "Tutor formation!" John called after the disappearing heads, moving as far away from the building as they could, reaching the swarms of other students gathered by the green wire fence in loose tutor lines.
Just as he was considering taking back his offer and apologising for overstepping, Mycroft Holmes stood. Greg rushed to mirror him, tucking his chair underneath his desk, slipping his hands into his pockets as Mycroft pulled out his pocket watch that hung on the end of a delicate gold chain at his waistcoat. "I have somewhere to be."
The doctor avoided his eyes, staring down at Sherlock's empty hands, remembering the feel of that cool skin against his own. Before he could doubt himself, he tilted his head upwards, slanting his lips firmly against Sherlock's.
Sherlock had the decency to step away, acting nonchalant as best as he could, and turning to tidy a stack of test-tubes which had been stacked haphazardly into their holding containers by a previous class.
"You're coming, Sherlock." John called from the other end of the classroom where he had gone to ram shut a faulty cupboard which persistently swung back open with a squeak. John frowned.
Sherlock knew it was a low blow, but seeing the panic rising in his brother's otherwise calm demeanour almost made up for it. He felt the weight settle in his feet again, clamped down on the unsettling nerves that he always kept such a tight grip on around his brother, felt himself gaining control.
"I've had your address stored in my mind palace for weeks now, John, do stop being so melodramatic ." Sherlock droned, moving into the living room where the T.V. was still on. "Ugh- dull. John, why do you fill your head with this rubbish?"
"Okay, so I'd like you to pair up, please. It will just make this next task easier. Anyone pisses around with the bunsen burners, you're out. Got it?" Upon hearing the general murmur of agreement, he sent a satisfied nod to the students and returned to the seat behind his desk, hovering but not sitting down.
"It could be infected or something!" Lestrade gesticulates, slapping Sherlock on the back, "Put it down!"
"Oh- yes, of course. Thanks, mate, I appreciate it." John nodded to him, having masked most of his crippling anxiety by now. "I'll, erm, catch you later, then?"
Sherlock frowned to himself, reaching for his phone deposited at the bottom of his suit-trouser pocket, thumbing the screen to open and compose a text whilst still focused on John.
John shivered, wondering how the hell a young virgin could be so confident and successful in turning him on every single time, with such little effort.
The only other time he'd became acquainted with Sebastian Moran was in the hallway outside his classroom, he'd given him a harsh word when he'd caught him crowding Sherlock into a corner calling him a 'psychopathic freak'. Unfortunately, finding Sherlock being teased wasn't such a rare occasion. But however hard the hit, Sherlock always merely straightened his spine, pulled his satchel back over his shoulder and marched away with his usual expressionless face. Not a crack in that wall.
"Sebastian-" John raised his hands to keep a distance between himself and his student, who had an alarmingly confident look in his eyes, and who was stepping over John's fallen chair with hooded eyes that were sliding appreciatively up and down John's form.
"What do you mean?" he hissed. "Sherlock- I can't just up and leave, I need to give at least a week's notice-"
"Sure-erm, just turn to the next page, guys, start on questions two and three, and we'll go over them when I get back."
But all of those details were melting into one, John gained tunnel vision as he sat fixated on Sherlock, struck by the sudden overwhelming amount of warmth that was building in his body, settling into his veins, engulfing his heart with a painful squeeze until there was just a rapid beating left in his chest, and butterflies swarming in his stomach
John emerged from his daydream, buttoning up the top few shirt buttons that Sherlock must have fumbled open in passionate haste. He caught his student watching him lazily as he tucked his wrinkled shirt back into his trousers, and immediately rounded on Sherlock, raising a finger to point at him.
"Oh no, please, go ahead. I'd like to see you try-" Sherlock threatened, gesticulating towards them.
As soon as the door closed, he peeled off his coat and watched John's small but sturdy frame standing off to the side looking back at him with hooded eyes.
"It's a necessity to access life's basic tools of control to circumvent unnecessary hindrances of human emotion." Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.
He snapped straight out of his mind palace to hear the impatient call of his name from the upstairs bathroom, and rushed to John.
There was an eerie quality to the scenery surrounded by the dark night on the other side of their car windows. John was silent as they slowed to a more tumultuous path, through the centre of vast hills and valleys, which broke up the indigo sky with their peaks, resting among the thin layers of clouds.
"John, you can't wear loafers on a hike." Sherlock stated, staring at the teacher's feet with disdain.
They trudged back together in silence, putting a significant distance between themselves when the vehicles came into sight, clambering onto separate coaches and settling into cold uncomfortable seats.
"I know you for real," he said softly, his eyebrows furrowing with the intensity of his gaze into Sherlock's hesitant eyes. He pushed Sherlock's curly hair out of his eyes, moving his hand to grasp one of Sherlock's that were hanging uselessly at his side.
They walked back to John's car in silence, neither of them acknowledging what could have potentially just happened.
He'd waited behind in the classroom for at least fifteen minutes, knowing even that was a push for Mr. punctual Holmes, to be more than 4 minutes behind schedule. Suspiciously locking the door behind him, he made for the exit, checking all smoking locations which Sherlock had absently mentioned to him before, including the corner they often 'ran into each other' on most days of the week.
"Hey," John said, moving his hand to stroke up Sherlock's back. "What's all this? You're not shy, are you?"
John hummed in response as Sherlock swung his satchel underneath his arm, pushed towards his back. "Who's the new girl?" John asked, referring to the lady who was gesticulating wildly to a confused Lestrade.
John shook his head in bewilderment, barely hearing the head-teacher's words past the ringing in his ears.
Greg rolled his eyes in return and stood, moving over to the window with his hands on his hips, looking out at the tarmac that was darkened with puddles of rain. "Any closer to deciding university plans?"
It's about  a minute later after screaming his student's name that he hears a weak croak from below him. "John?"
"I've been in a similar situation before." He admitted with some element of coldness or detachment in his voice. When John met his eyes, he wished so intensely he could enter the mind of the brilliant Sherlock Holmes. Wished he could climb in and walk around in it, know what it was like to live as the extraordinary man, someone so capable of so many things, though completely incapable of others, wished he could understand, wished he could know of his clearly troubled past.
"Not at all, John. I just wanted to ask you a few questions, if that's okay? It will only take a moment."
Sherlock nodded, his hands falling back to John's strong hips, moving to the small of his muscled back, shirtless and golden. He worked his way under the waistband of his jeans and boxers, hands resting fully on full and glorious cheeks. John groaned, feeling his way back to Sherlock's exposed cock, still slightly perturbed by the above average size
I cover his hand with mine and press it more firmly to my body. “Yes.” I cannot ignore how stiff and rigid his fingers feel; they are not made of flesh and bone. I find it doesn’t bother me. His voice in my ear is pure.
I switched my attention to the other nipple, and began to suck and lick it while with my fingers as I pinched and caressed the first. I could hold the entirety of his breast in my one hand; the perfect palmful of flesh. His short nails scratched at my scalp, and his other hand was gripping my upper arm, fingers flexing. His right knee was splayed wide. The smell of his arousal made my cock throb.
Hypothesis: he wanted me in return. He'd wanted me before tonight, before this past week, before we were married. Further hypothesis, although thinking about it felt like looking into a bright light: he had wanted me for quite a while.
John came back in, clipboard in hand. He'd taken their order himself, negating the need for their actual waiter, which was a ridiculous concession. Sherlock would have to remind him of the
Then John's hand was gone from Sherlock's arse, and it closed gently over Sherlock's hand on John's chest. John flattened Sherlock's palm to his body and disengaged gently from their kiss. Sherlock looked down into his eyes, trying to keep his breathing even.
I turn to stare at it. It reaches out toward the console, and music bursts forth all around us, like a gramophone is concealed somewhere. For a minute I think I've wet myself in shock, but it turns out the seat below me is heated from the inside as well. The machine fiddles with dials, changing the music, and settles on a violin concerto that I recognize.
The tightness in John's chest eased, and he found himself smiling at the bacon as it began to sizzle. "Good," he said. "Me too."
"And wouldn't you like to keep it that way?" John asked. "Actually, I think they're starting to like you."
I slept poorly that night, my brain confused by rejection and desire. I dreamt of Watson sharing my bed; of the two of us walking in Hyde Park in the daytime, arm in arm; of rolling with him under a bush at twilight and kissing him breathless, and then having him tell me the Yard were on their way. I finally slept deeply a little after dawn, but woke at a tug on the bell, disoriented and with my head aching.
Rub along, indeed, I thought, feeling my pulse jump. Leaning back on the settee, I let my one hand fall into my lap, where my prick felt heavy in my drawers. Guilt sat like a stone in my stomach, but it didn’t stop my hand from wandering, from smoothing up and down my thigh and over my belly. I kept the other hand high, resting on my collarbone, thinking about his touch upon my face. I wanted him to touch me like that all over. I could almost feel his fingertips running over my throat, plucking open my collar, unfastening a button or two of my shirt. I did it to myself, baring my skin to the air, and a shiver worked its way down my spine. My prick stiffened shamelessly, so I gave in and covered it with my palm. I heard myself sigh and, embarrassed at the sound in the silent room, sealed my lips together.
"Come here," he panted, reaching for my prick. The first touch of his hand had me groaning; his fingers were slippery with his own wetness. He shifted us so that our positions were changed, me on my back and he reaching over me to jerk my prick furiously. I clung to him, gasping into his neck; my cock felt huge in his slender hand. His breasts pressed against my side, and he draped his long thigh over mine to hold me tighter.
— gets a warning glare and makes no attempt to protest. He knows he has overstepped, and in such a place! A gentlemen’s club; not even that
Sherlock scoffed, waving away John's concerns like the steam over his tea. "Wrong," he said. "The kitchen is
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth a few times, as if he were trying to decide if John was having him on. John solved the dilemma for him by stepping into his space and sliding one hand up around the back of Sherlock's neck. He went up on his toes, steadying himself with his other hand on Sherlock's chest, and pressed their lips together.
Mycroft went, smirking with satisfaction. He lifted his umbrella to John in a little salute on his way out the door. John locked it behind him.
When first I had met Sherlock Holmes, I had been wounded, ill, and alone. My family had nothing to offer, and my friends had left London for better, or worse, situations. I had hoped to find a situation or join a practice by the time I ran into Stamford, but it was more difficult than I expected, and my health was not strong enough to sustain a full-time position. I was despairing, and Sherlock Holmes looked upon me with such kindness, and read my history and my suffering without pity, that it was impossible not to like him at once. He fascinated me, and becoming his friend had been both a pleasure and an honor.
"Okay?" John paused, looking back into Sherlock's eyes, searching his facial expression for any of the uncertainty or panic he had found before, the first time they'd shared a bed together.
All John knew was that Sherlock was a locked door, an occasional peek through the keyhole allowed some of his brilliance to shine through, but not knowing whatever was on the other side of that door made it difficult to know if Sherlock was ever being himself, ever being truthful. He shut out John's attempt at questioning him, about himself, about his work or anything that he deemed unimportant.
John sighed. "I don't know, Sherlock. I'd lose my job." he said quietly, his eyes on Sherlock's shoes.
He pushes the door-handle sharply up and then pushes down, the door springing open as he slides his tools back into his coat, heading straight for the hydrochloric acid.
"He was suffocating, not just to me- Harry as well, and my mum was a pushover, plus she feared him, so she never helped. I joined the army to get my independence, to get my doctorate and do my grandparents proud. They both died in a car-accident two days after I'd returned home from military service for being shot."
When Dr Watson returned his sight to the class, and was met with the intense eyes of the infamous Sherlock Holmes, he startled. Realising that Sherlock was the only student without a pair, he frowned, but said nothing and launched into the explanation of the experiment.
Sherlock stretched out against his lover like a cat, toes curling against John's calves, before retracting inwards and tucking his head underneath John's chin with a satisfied little grunt.
"No! No- Sherlock," He blurted, smoothing a hand down the back of Sherlock's neck, resting it there as they pulled up to a lull in traffic. "Good- very good." he pressed a kiss to the corner of Sherlock's mouth, thrilling at the way his head turned to the left as if a magnetic force drew their lips together.
He realised his hand had slid from Sherlock's thigh to the centre-console, just on the edge of his own seat, and lay limp. "What time is it?" He rubbed at his eyes, only just realising that Sherlock had pulled his hand away from his neck and that the car had stopped moving. "Where are we?"
"Yes," he said finally, and with a twirl of fabric, he descended down the stairs to the labs, leaving John to go his separate ways.
Mycroft stood, his slim form casting a shadow on the wall. "Believe it or not, Gregory, I do have other pre-occupations than spending my life running after my juvenile little brother."
John looked back over to the girl, seeing that she was now staring back...straight at Sherlock.  "Right...interesting."
"Mycroft?" John frowned, his eyes rolling back in his head on the verge of a moan at the feeling of Sherlock's insistent lips against his skin. He cupped the back of his head, his other hand returning to its place on Sherlock's thigh, which stuttered under his touch.
"Dinner?" John smiled, licking his lips, his hand moving to Sherlock's chest. He noticed the hunger in his younger lover's eyes, knowing straight away his hunger was not for food.
"Damaging your lungs by smoking, burning yourself with chemicals, getting trapped in fires, cutting yourself on bricks" John smirked, "You're a whole new definition of danger."
"I shouldn't have to push you into it, Sherlock. You're an expert Biology student, you know how poorly the body functions without any food source." John lectured.
He'd expected a text from Mycroft anytime soon, who probably knew Sherlock's thoughts from across the stupid wide world
The silence continued for two long minutes, before Greg stopped fiddling with the thread of his sleeve and lifted his head to look at the gentleman across from him.
John in fact was not sick, but had called in that morning with the fabricated excuse of a nasty stomach bug; and was now sitting alone in his silent living room, wondering what he should do.
Sherlock didn't reply, but nodded his head towards the building situated across the car-park that John hadn't noticed. The neon letters that had probably once worked flickered in the distance, and John was only able to make out three of them.
Sherlock shook his head against John's shoulder, almost clinging to him as John manoeuvred himself to lay on his back, allowing Sherlock to rest on his chest.
"Lestrade is not a problem, John. I have had his signature memorised since year eleven, it's really not that complex." he said simply, sliding out of his suit jacket and tucking in his shirt at the back, the deep purple fabric feeling cool to the touch.
John turned his head to the man before entering the other room, noticing Sherlock was still planted in the doorway, next to the coat-stand. "You don't have to stay there, you know." John's eyes relished the look of child-like wonder on his face. "Make yourself at home."
"Best to." Greg nodded, sniffing suddenly and then flexed one of his nostrils. "Well, I guess this is it then." he turned to his pupil, meeting his eyes.
"Shit, I've got the washing on the line at home-I thought it was supposed to be sunny today!?" Greg cursed, tutting at the grey skies above them, brushing a hand through his short and slightly greying hair. "I suppose that's England for ya" he grumbled.
"Do I embarrass you?" He asked, moving his hand to the back of Sherlock's neck, his thumb stroking the shapes of Sherlock's ear.
"Because I don't want to have to fly home on an emergency jet because you cannot control yourself for more than two days without being reprimanded for something or other."
"Have you seen Sherlock?" Greg asked, glancing back to the building, darkened smoke beginning to billow out from the windows of the second floor with the occasional crackle, causing frenzy amongst the students.
"I just assumed, you're here all the time. Don't think I've ever seen you leave, actually." His eyebrows pulled together.
Slowly bringing himself back into consciousness, Sherlock blinked sleepily against John's skin, his long eyelashes feeling ticklish. He pressed his ear against John's chest, content to hear and feel the continuous thudding against his flesh, enabling himself to do what he'd been wanting to for so long, what they'd been holding back from.
Kevin Lynch hummed in answer, fixing John with a look that said he would be seeking him out later, and turned to leave.
In fact, the closest to his mother that Sherlock could be now, was by sitting in Mycroft's office, staring into the beady eyes of the portrait above his brother's desk, silently seething that the artist hadn't captured the warmth in the flecks of amber that had once faintly encircled his mother's icy blue irises.
"Finished, sir." Greg whistled appreciatively, it had only taken him 10 seconds. Greg knew if it were him, it would've taken him longer than that just to figure out how to work the confusing looking keyboard. He wondered what Mycroft could want with him here.
Sherlock said nothing and merely raised an eyebrow, staring up at the library ceiling and counting the stains and smudges on the tiles.
Sherlock eventually grimaced, ripping the photos into halves and quarters, sitting down and saying nothing.
He was immediately distracted by an almost inaudible gasp from Sherlock when John moved his tongue into his mouth, meeting the softness of Sherlock's velvet tongue, caressing expertly and pulling away to meet Sherlock's bowed lips. Surprised to hear a soft moan escape his own throat, John gripped Sherlock's body in his hands, turning it over quickly and skilfully, falling to his elbows over him and feeling the fire that consumed his every nerve ending at the feeling of Sherlock's body pressed tightly and solidly against his own.
"Hmm?" John settled back against Sherlock's height, letting his head fall back onto his shoulder, feeling his large hand move to his stomach, hearing his feet shuffle closer. Sherlock pressed the key into his hand.
The surrounding workers were silent, waiting with bated breath as Mycroft moved closer to the screen, irises flickering quickly across the enlarged photo of the boy. Greg's eyes were drawn to the collar of the boy's shirt, noticing the lack of thin and prominent collar bones from Sherlock's gaunt form.
Sherlock glared at him and shut the textbook with a snap, "I'm capable of hatred, too, you know" he hinted.
"Wha-Oh, no thank you. I'm fine." he touched his stomach absently, fiddling with one of the shirt buttons that was poking through his jumper. "Actually, I- think I'd better be going, Sherlock. Lovely to meet you, Mrs Hudson- sorry I couldn't stay, I have piles of exam papers to file through." he smiled sheepishly.
Mycroft Holmes was silent in his demeanour as he seated himself once again, the carefully constructed mask that Greg recognised greatly from Sherlock was intact, not a hair out of place.
Sherlock waited until the elder Holmes had left the room before letting his gaze settle on his mother's dead eyes above the desk.
Sherlock looked up again, bringing his spare hand to John's chest, the weight of it pressing securely against John's rapid heartbeat. He watched his own fingers stroke across the wool of John's jumper, felt the stiffness of toned muscle underneath the fabric, took a deep breath as John's hand moved to the side of his neck.
He told John with as much nonchalance that he could muster that it had happened no less than 5 times, and resolutely told himself not to look at John's expression. He worried of the reaction of his new lover, not knowing what John would think of him, considering Sherlock had a false reputation of being promiscuous amongst the student body, though he was never quite sure of the origin of those rumours. Just as he was beginning the familiar process of trying to eliminate possible instigators from his list of suspects, he felt John's hand touch his face, it was shaking slightly.
"Get out." John growled, his anger coming off him in waves, and Sebastian had the decency of being startled by the shout from the undersized Biology teacher.
Sherlock paused at the stairwell closest to the chemistry labs, knowing that John would cut through the staff room to leave the building.
He reached around in his back pocket for his teacher's badge, staring down at the slow ticking of his watch. He looked back over to Greg, who was in discussion with a younger looking woman that John assumed was a new teaching assistant, just the same height as the students with mousy brown hair and sporting a knitted jumper.
Mycroft retrieved the file from his drawer, sliding the same photos he had shown John over to his baby brother, watching Sherlock's face go pale and taut when he laid eyes on them.
Molly nodded sincerely, her eyes glancing back to Mike who had started in on his second doughnut. "Any word from John, at all?"
Sherlock scowled at John's grin, letting his fingers trail the edge of the small plate sitting on the bed-sheets. "You know you're the exception."
John remained silent, his lips pressed together as if he were worried as soon as they opened all manner of things would come tumbling out with little control. Instead, he watched Sherlock carefully, watched his eyes which were unfocused but were attempting to land on John.
"Hey-" John snapped, tugging at Sherlock's coat at arm's length. "Watch who you think you're talking to."
"Don't be so tedious as to raise your voice, Sherlock. You are not three years old anymore." Mycroft droned from his office.
Greg wrenched open the solid door as soon as he heard Mycroft slam down the phone to its holder. "Impertinent woman." he growled under his breath to himself, before he turned to notice Greg in the doorway.
"In the paper sleeve of your hardback cover of Moby Dick, third shelf on the wall by the sofa." Sherlock provided with a smug undertone to his voice, and Mycroft pretended not to be surprised that Sherlock knew this already.
Sherlock settled back, then, and John had to stop himself from grasping the opportunity of turning this into some kind of interview to find out more about the enigma of Sherlock Holmes.
"Sherlock-" he pleaded, emotion evident in his voice as he stood off to the side, his hands and soul feeling empty with the lack of Sherlock's presence.
"I'm sorry for your...predicament, Sherlock. Sentiment is a dangerous disadvantage;" Mycroft frowns to himself, ignoring Sherlock's interruptions and denials. "The fact remains that you are young and available."
Sherlock was determinedly walking over to John and away from Lestrade, heading towards where he had left his bag when they'd entered the field.
John worried at his lip with his teeth and let his head fall back in his seat, trying to push down the panic swirling around in his stomach.
Sherlock fiddled with a loose thread hanging from his sleeve and focused on the direction of his feet until he heard an additional set of irregular footsteps behind him and turned.
"Seeing that he's Sherlock's brother, he probably was" Greg frowned, not taking his eyes from the tall man with the black umbrella despite the clear skies. "Oh here's your coat, by the way."
Mycroft glanced upon the teacher's attempt at a comforting smile and looked away again, turning his body to the door.
Instead, Sherlock now got to watch as the man he treasured blinked himself awake, sleepy and naked, in the bed next to him. He got to kiss the morning smile off his face, got to thread his fingers through the short hair at the back of his neck, the ones he would stare at as John turned to write equations on the whiteboard once upon a time.
He sat in the uncomfortable chair opposite, leaning forward on his elbows and running a hand through his hair as the head-teacher began to speak.
"Wow," Greg said, his eyebrows raising, unable to contemplate what the two young men must have gone through together, especially knowing the nature of their difficult relationship. "Sherlock said it was a crash."
"The stress of five subjects, Lestrade. It's completely overwhelming." he broke off into a quiet sob, his face angled away from his tutor.
"You can't expect me to stay away now-" he insisted with a confidence suggesting he knew just how to play John Watson.
"Biscuits!" Sherlock interrupted her, running to her trolley that was stationary in the hallway, as John shot the woman an exasperated look to which she clucked amusedly at.
Sherlock frowned with confusion back at him, watching the doctor lay on his back on his own side of the bed, turning onto his side and putting his hand under the pillow his head lay on. He looked up at Sherlock expectantly, and Sherlock joined him on top of the covers, lying on his back for a moment until he felt comfortable to face John on his own side.
"Apart from that bloody loud French accent, and the other one's annoying laugh, no. I wasn't really paying attention."
"You are still in fighting shape, John. Beyond fighting shape." Sherlock argued, evidence of which flashing tauntingly behind his eyes, the memory of John's toned stomach and chest as he exited the shower that same morning.
Mycroft's lips pulled into a thin line, clearly contemplating something, as he set off again at the sight of green. Greg gnawed at his lip, feeling guilty and idiotic and knowing that this must've just been confirming the thoughts Mycroft had already about him being worthless and stupid like he deemed the rest of the human race.
"Greg?" Another voice interrupted, another teacher exiting the school with her arms full of folders. "Aren't you supposed to be teaching now?" she questions.
"I'm going. Do try not to have a heart attack, we both know how high your blood pressure is from all of those fatty acids you've been consuming. Putting on weight again are we?" Sherlock grinned to himself as he climbed the small staircase to Mycroft's office on the top floor, sliding his hand along the mahogany hand rest.
"Right. Kevin. Anyway, he's an A grade tosser. Pretty sure he's had a sexual harassment complaint filed against him by one of the female Art teachers too. Always seemed like a pig to me."
He worked at his own shirt buttons, only to be slapped away and replaced by John's fumbling fingers, groaning as their clothed crotches met between them.
"Taking a leaf out of your book," he sassed in return, stepping in and onto the bear-skin rug sprawled out on the dark hardwood floor. He shut the door with a click.
Time passed by quicker than they had expected, the minutes of the hours of the days ticked by, without so much as a pestering neighbour interrupting their safe haven, tucked away into the corner of a rural forest, hundreds of miles away from the loudness and business of London. London, where everything seemed more stressful, more constricted, more lawful.
He filled a cup with black coffee, watching the steaming liquid pour from the nozzle, setting another cup up next to it and filling it with tea. He moved to greet the ladies at the checkouts with a charming smile, grabbing sugar, milk, and spoons and paying with a swipe of his card, carrying both cups over to Sherlock.
Sherlock glared hard at the wall, wishing not for the first time that his brother didn't exist to drive John away from him..
He'd rolled down the window as soon as they got in, and let his arm rest atop it, the cool air flowing in, and the light from the streetlamps glinting off the gold of his signet ring as his fingers tapped against the outer body of the car.
John smiled politely back at him, "You are a good looking guy, don't get me wrong, but I'm afraid I'll have to politely decline." He smiled one of his most charming smiles at the man who was obviously disappointed, lingering for a moment in embarrassment and then excusing himself.
Sherlock had also deduced that Dr Watson had only recently recovered slightly from a psychosomatic limp, associated with his injury in Afghanistan.
"It's nothing I can't handle," John rushed to reassure him, "We just won't ever get to spend any time alone with him lurking, I guess he's.. protective?"
"Not fine by me-" John demanded, his voice pushing more authority. "No one in my class is going to fail Biology. I won't allow for it. So
here with you this morning when I was planning on heading to the gym; yes. Yes, I am. And you'll shut up and like it,  because I've already had enough of these four walls, and I've only been inside them twice before."
"Intimate?" she looked confused. "Well, no... I don't know. Like I said, I wasn't really paying attention, I was hungover."
The kettle had just boiled by the time the doorbell rang. John shook himself out of his daze, biting at the skin around his thumbnail as he reached absently for his keys to unlock the front door.
He had a missed call from the prime minister’s secretary, and a thousand and one other things higher on his list of priorities and things to do.
Sherlock watched John turn to him in a gesture of familiarity, suddenly picturing their usual routine of 'hello' glances that spoke with so much hidden desire unable to be physically expressed.
words with John when he returns." The man sat back in his chair with his hands folded, seemingly satisfied with his defence.
John didn't even question that, "Still, your absences will go on your record" he threatened half-heartedly.
John sat back in his own seat, legs spread and fingers curled over the edge of the arm-rest. He licked his lips subconsciously, shifting slightly as Sherlock's eyes met his own. "What do you want to see?"
He'd crowded himself into the head's office first thing in the morning each day to try and weasel more information out of the fat bastard. Greg didn't understand how he and so many others were so quick to judge the person that they'd all worshipped at some point or another. John was a people pleaser, a true gent, everyone had always admired those qualities in him.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow without saying a word, and John turned so bright red he practically shrunk in on himself, hoping to God that Sherlock wouldn't point it out.
John turned for a moment at hearing noise coming from the back, letting his eyes fall on Sherlock who was sitting with his headphones in staring down at his phone, his curly hair falling over his forehead and onto his face.
Greg felt the words like the sting of a cold razor against his face, like nails on a chalkboard, scratching slowly and painfully ringing in his ears. "Mr Holmes." he gritted his teeth. "With all due respect, I know you're a man of a certain level of power, but if you think you can just walk in here an-"
Not meeting his eyes, Sherlock glanced nervously to the side and let out a breath, startling John with the sudden prominent appearance of his youth in one simple action. "Promise?" he asked, apprehensively.
"Can't tell if that was a compliment or not." he pressed his lips together in attempt to get to the trickier hairs under his bottom lip.
The two began to walk back to the general gathering of vehicles and scattered people, taped off by police. Sherlock ducked underneath and lifted the dividing tape up for John to walk under.
John knew right away that his lover had conveyed with one action more than he could have with any spoken words, and was grateful then and there for Sherlock's silent nature. Many had argued over the years that the young man was incapable of emotion, though John was only just beginning to understand that the truth was precisely the opposite; for some reason he'd just been the only one allowed close enough to see it.
Greg stared at the back of Mycroft's head, he hadn't turned when he spoke, hadn't even acknowledged him entering the room.
Sherlock pressed his ear to the gap of the slightly ajar door, recognising the voice of a year twelve student named - Sebastian, was it?
Only a couple of hours had passed since Sherlock had last seen John, and he was sensing that in order to avoid him longer, he should probably evade the science department. However, it was imperative that he checked his mould experiments sitting in Petri dishes on the windowsill of Chemistry lab number 3 before he left for home, which is where he found himself when John came storming in.
The blonde man who's name-tag indicated he was called Matthew, practically dragged himself away from the pair, flirty smile not gone from his face as he turned his back and bent over to reach the pint glasses.
Greg made his excuses about speaking to the head and left, whilst John focused on the direction Sherlock was heading, crossing the small field and rounding the corner to the bricked bike sheds away from view.
John blinked, keeping his eyes straight ahead and away from his student. "I'm just glad nobody was seriously hurt." he attempted to sound as sincere and professional as he could, feeling even more daunted by the older Holmes' looming stance and blank facial expression.
John huffed. "Where are you going?" He slammed the door shut and went around to the open passenger door to peer inside at Sherlock.
