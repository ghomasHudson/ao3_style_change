Mycroft smiles and closes his eyes. "Christ, I love you so much.. Have you thought about where you want the service?"
Sherlock swims over to him, smiling and shaking his head to dry his hair a bit.
It wasn't the best idea. Ultimately it solved nothing. Omegas were bought off before their first heats, he'd gone nearly 17 years past his first heat before meeting Sherlock. How many would miss out on happiness still, despite their best efforts?
He blushes and kisses him deeply.
Sherlock nods. “Which museum, ma’am? We... I can get it tonight.” He heads for the door as he pulls out his phone. *Will be late back. But I will be back. I’ll meet you at 221B. X* He quickly texts to John.
Greg groans and sucks on his tongue gently. He cups Mycroft's face in his hand. He presses their foreheads together as he breaks the kiss gasping for air.
“Always, My.” Greg smiles softly.
He scrambles out of his seat nearly tripping over himself to lock the door.
"To much?" Greg asks and raises an eyebrow.
"Which room is ours?" Rosie asks, looking at the numbers.
Udos chuckles. “It’s not me you should be telling.”
He blushes and whimpers. "John.. Please."
He blushes and nods, relaxing himself.
“Gonna come for me, baby?”
"So... You're leaving" John asks, suddenly feeling small and exposed he steps into his pants and sits heavily on the bed.
Sky moans and kisses him back deeply, whimpering as he sinks into her.
He moans loudly as he's filled.
Sky sits up and groans at the pounding in her head. She looks at them and immediately reads the situation. "I'll do it. I'll show him. But it's going to be a lot for him to handle. It's going to a lot of emotions. I can try and hold some back."
Sherlock gasps as the plug moves, pushing back against him.
“I love you, too.”
He nuzzles him back softly.
“Giving Mycroft something to do so he can relax and feel some semblance of control.”
Sherlock smiles happily and pets his head. "This is brilliant.."
He blushes brighter and kisses him back.
“I think I’m getting ahead of myself. I don’t even know if I can transform.”
Sky moans like a whore, Eli’s cock outline easily visible through her belly so they can watch him fuck her womb.
“I may even be able to get my stitches removed by then.” Sherlock hums, holding Thomas and Teddy against his chest.
She moves to hover over her, leaning in so her lips are just barely touching hers. "Would you like to join us? To be bred by the men in our family? To join our family?"
He sucks on his tongue.
Bending down he fishes around below the sink for his medical kit. Buried below all the gauze, bandages, and ointment is a disposable packet of a special deodorizer for Omegas. In itself, not rare to find in a medical kit. Should a doctor come across a wounded Omega, it would be commonplace for the doctor to use one of these wipes on the major scent glands before administering medical aid.
Mycroft came over and tried to calm him down. “Relax, John. Just lay back. You can’t get up yet,” Mycroft said, as he tried to gently press John back into the bed.
Mycroft smirks and does as asked. "I assure you, everything is ready."
He fakes a pout. "And they didn't invite us?"
"I wanna switch to dare. Can I?" Collin looks at Greg.
Lydia gets into the bed and pulls John on top of her, kissing him deeply. Bryan kneels behind John and kisses his back.
"Sky. Now." His voice turns stern and father like.
“Just the three rooms please, Mycroft.” Sherlock pulls a face as he says Mycroft name to him, but continues. “Will you show me to them?” They ask.
She holds him close and kisses his head. "Let's go.."
She closes her eyes, curling up against her.
He breathes heavily. “Thank you, sirs. Thank you for using me. My holes are always open for you to use.”
He smiles and hums.
He moves his finger slowly and eases a second into him.
She arches and her eyes roll back into her head as he gets even deeper inside her than John did.
He blushes and smiles. 'I love dancing with you..'
"I'm here, hun." Greg smiles and stands at the end of his bed.
She blushes and nods.
Sky nods, Turks confidence making her feel better.
He smiles happily.
He blushes and mewls a bit. “Yes, sir.”
"Come on, love.. You can do it.. Be a good boy.."
Greg just stands there, holding Mycroft’s hand.
He gasps sharply and pushes back for more.
John holds him close.
"I love you, too.." She presses her face to his chest. "So so much."
“Mm I bet. Sorry for invading your dream.” She giggles.
John smiles and nods, leading Sherlock out to the lifts.
He gasps and moans breathily.
After a moment of feeling the heaviness of Greg on his tongue, he began to move experimentally, forming a vacuum with his lips.
“Almost? Mm that’s to bad. Maybe you don’t need mine.” He smirks, pulling back.
He smirks and snaps his hips, aiming for his prostate knowing he can’t come.
"Five minutes of peace to have a cup of coffee. Is that to much to ask?" John signs and grumbles as he picks up his phone.
He tries to rock his hips back against Carol’s fingers, needing more.
Sherlock relaxes, easily falling asleep.
“Mm I know it’s your favorite. No one else gets to use it but you.” Sharon slowly pushes it into her.
He blushes and nods.
He frowns. "Sky?"
John holds him tighter. "I know, love. I love you, too. So much."
She gasps softly and aches back into him.
He leans in and kisses him.
“My..” Greg kisses his hip, slowly working his way to his cock. “Has anyone ever sucked you before?”
John snorts softly. "Thanks, I think." He muses.
“You’re right. Gotta keep up appearances.” John nods, knowing when he has to take off the ring it’s going to be one of the hardest things he’ll have to do in his life.
She giggles and follows him.
He moans and kisses her back.
“Mm.. someone did miss me.” He smirks against her lips.
Sherlock's hips twitch and he moans loudly. "Oh my god, Greg!" He tries to push his arse back against Greg's face.
Sherlock blushes as he sees how submissive John is.
He smiles softly, moving  to sit on the bed. "You.. You w-were talking about your daughter?"
Sherlock blushed.
He starts to thrust into her hard, holding her up.
He moans as he pushes in a third finger. “Yes, sir!”
"Very sure. She should have never hit Sky. Especially since she knows Sky is pregnant."
Sherlock frowns, looking concerned. "What's wrong with me?"
Sky fucks him with her tongue and strokes his sensitive cock.
"Look at you! Amazing." He smiles proudly.
“I love you, Mycroft.” Greg says softly.
He moans breathily against his lips.
“So it starts here. The first station.” He leafs Sherlock to the first stain glass. “Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. This is where God tells him he’s going to die for this sins of the whole world through out time.” John hums, seeing the sorrowful expression on Jesus’ face. “Jesus accepts his fate. Then we move to the second station. Between the first and second station Jesus breaks the bread and wine which is were Communion comes from. The last supper. I’m sure you’ve seen the paintings. So the second station.” He moves on to the next, holding Sherlock’s hand. “Judas betrays Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, the irony is not lost on the whole silver thing. That’s why silver hurts vampires. Because Judas betrayed Jesus for it so it is a holy object. It basically set in motion the death of Jesus so it can be used to hurt vampires because they have also sinned against God like Judas did.” John hums, squeezing Sherlock’s hand gently.
— Естественно, — ухмыльнулся Иванс, — с прошлым всегда так, но я брал только то, что могло погибнуть или могло быть уничтожено… а для всего остального я … заказывал копии.
Нервный тип, по правам Джамуэль Лорити, обитал в небольшом домике с обилием колон и карнизов. Жил он на втором этаже. Мик затормозил рядом с решётчатыми воротами и нажал кнопку охраны.
Снежана сняла рюкзачок ярко-голубого цвета с 3D логотипом MGM и сунулась туда.
— When you've turned into a guardian in a dimension Y, the Grail was expelled from the Holy energy of good. She entered our hearts and changed our force. Because it was the Holy Grail, and not escheat the product of a sick imagination foreign soldiers. If you remember, the power of the false Grail gave the Princess only for a while.
-And you thought that your disappearance everything will fall? There is no hope.
-But our Palms. Restaurant Kabashi - Sensei Shop   on it two large sushi and.
— Проехали, — Мик криво усмехнулся.
— Пытались подделать прошлое? — Шерлок приподнял левую бровь.
— В смысле?
Snezhana closely examined, but, unfortunately, such a thing as this locket was no more.
— Сонота! Принеси лоток с тем мясом!
— Нет. Если вы официально мне разрешите, то я буду работать с Максом.
— I... going back to my conversation at the restaurant... I'm not jealous of you. I'm just afraid for you, - Max sighed, - I lost my family and first partner. And that led me to a personal madness. ... I wandered lonely, restless... and didn't know why. I... longed for death and did not want to live. And now... you. And I want to live... for your friendship... — Max was silent, having no words to Express what he had accumulated for two years. Mick was silent. Bottom fought the waves, kicking up foam caps and crashing in the salty sea-spray of diamonds. To the horizon stretched the ocean. Changeable shining in the sun, shimmering blue, then black, then sapphire-green. The horizon was cloud. The ocean there was black. Max looked at the water and cursed himself.
— Понятно, — Шерлок разулся и прошел в комнату.
Mick opened his eyes and saw nothing, but heard. Spoke near two. Mick tried to learn Chinese, but he somehow was not given. Of all Mick knew the Chinese words for eight.
Ужин закончился в полном молчании, и когда гости поднялись из-за стола и направились к дверям, Ульриха жадно и жарко прижалась невзначай к Шерлоку и прерывисто прошептала:
— Меня зовут Джорджина, — сказала Джо, — можете звать меня просто Джо, а это мой друг Шерлок Холмс.
Max watched with interest on the nervous type and continued to eat.
— Ты же меня защитишь? — нежно улыбнулась Джо, — правда?
Дайсуке приглушенно хмыкнул и, пригласив своего попутчика следовать за ним, подошел к Мику. Они сели лицом к бару. Дайсуке протянул руку к чайнику. Мик кивнул и достал еще две чашки. После некоторого молчания Мик вновь спросил:
— «…в некоторых местах новых городов на Новой Земле находят некие артефакты, принадлежащие давно вымершей расе жившей на этой планете. Я был свидетелем того, как рабочие, строившие дом, выкопали из-под земли стелу метра два в длину и метр в ширину. Она была сделана из неизвестного металла и блестела так, как будто только что вышла из рук кузнеца. Я внимательно осмотрел её и увидел, что она покрыта неким подобием клинописи. Но в тот момент я не знал этого языка и поспешил передать стелу в музей „Исчезнувшие Цивилизации“. Через некоторое время я нашел способ прочесть надпись на стеле. И там была история о чудище Гу-ЧиЗхуЗай-Юйянь — Де-Хехинг или Куа-Хи-аан. И чудище это имело алтарь свой, до которого надо было пройти портал. И если от Новой Земли под углом 90 градусов провести линию, а потом от той планеты под углом 45 градусов еще одну, и от третьей — по 36 градусов третью, то четвертая планета будет та, на которой живет чудище. И имя ему — Пожиратель костей…».
Max entered the room and stood in the passage.
— Вот придурок, — пробормотал Дайсуке, моя посуду, — зачем мотать себя? Уж не знаю, какое у него задание было, но главное жив остался. Хорошо, что я за ним вернулся, а то, возможно, он бы там погиб, вступив в схватку с этими ублюдками. И этот шар… Что это такое? Хорошо, я этого не понимаю. Люпен отчалил в Женеву, немало не обескураженный неудачей. Теперь у меня задача — вернуть Мика обществу. Но перед этим мне надо будет съездить в Чикаго и разузнать. Газеты молчат. Информаторы встревожены; хотел бы я знать, чего они бояться? И Мика оставить боязно…. У него такое состояние паршивое….
— Друг моего друга сидел под кроватью.
— Да, — ответил Мик, внимательно глядя на этих странных товарищей, — мне кажется, что одного из них я знаю, но хоть убей, не помню, где я его видел.
- I know, -  murmured back.
- And what do you want me to say? – Mick taxied out of the garage.
— Ладно. Дядюшка Вонг — некоронованный король Триад. Если кто-то хочет что-то получить — деньги, оружие, наркотики, вид на жительство, девочку на ночь — иди к дядюшке Вонгу. Он расскажет, покажет и поможет…
Cube? — Max looked at her, — you did not specify what was stolen...
Шесть часов назад.
— What? SAILOR`s now does not exist?
Через некоторое время.
— Я не хочу говорить. Я… не знаю, … что я хочу, — Мик вырвал левую ладонь из рук Джигена и ударил ею по столу, — отстань от меня. Я — паршивый никудышный коп!
- Well. We promise that we will find the missing children, and now — view your statement and sign. Holography we'll keep to myself.
— Я — Катарина Джонс, мама Рудди.
Снежана бежала вперед, чувствуя сзади топот. Её преследователи пытались её догнать. Ага, как же. Снежана могла выступать в Олимпийских играх в марафоне, но ей это не было нужно. Она оставила преследователей далеко позади и вылетела на ближайшую улицу.
— Let's once back from the second victim...
— I woke up, what's next? — rude said Max.
— I... not going to do — disown Max, -  I respect your right to friends.
— Думаешь, Джо не знает, где ты и что с тобой? — поинтересовался Дайсуке, — бьюсь об заклад, что не успеем мы с тобой поговорить, как она позвонит в нашу дверь…
— Бывший напарник Мика.
Half an hour later.
— Хорошо. А теперь пойдем, прогуляемся, пока не звенит колокольчик на обед.
- Hello? Who says?
— «Это была чертова подстава!» — решил Макс, — «они хотели, кто бы это ни был, убить Мика. Но, похоже, у Мика очень хорошие друзья, да и хорошо стреляющие ко всему прочему». Джип стоял у поребрика, Мик сидел на ступеньке машины, откинувшись на дверцу. Лицо у него было белое. Глаза закрыты. Макс оставил на произвол судьбы труп и подошел к Мику.
— Хоть скажи, куда тебя ранили? — попросил Макс.
— Почему? — поинтересовался Макс.
- Thanks, Joe.
-  Is you found him? — near them there was a beefy fellow in a white coat.
Mick came home in this almost dead from fatigue, I didn't even hear what he says.
— And this isn't a call girl?
The girl from Honolulu!
— Ты ведь знала, Джо, ты ВСЕ знала! — Мик метнул на неё быстрый взгляд.
— А ты в курсе? — лейтенант посмотрел на своего бывшего подчиненного.
— Как так? — Джон настырно пытался докопаться до правды.
— Кто его бил? — переменил тему Макс, — кто это мог сделать?
— Семь часов.
— Присаживайтесь к столу и запоминайте, что я вам скажу.
— Надеюсь, всему этому найдется рациональное объяснение, — пробурчал Макс, выползая в комнату отдыха, — что нас еще ждет?
— Джен размером с меня. Худенькая, в отца пошла. Волосы каштановые, пострижены коротко. Была одета в синие леггинсы, синий толстый свитер, отец привозил с Норвегии, черные сапоги на платформе и черную куртку — дутыш. С собой — айфон синего цвета, кошелек черный. У неё — зеленые глаза, вздернутый нос и пухленькие губки. Отсутствует один зуб на верхней челюсти.
— Я тебе верю. Возвращайся к своему спутнику, а я домой поеду, — Мик двинулся к останкам некогда большой машины — фары разбиты, стекол нет, шины спущены, все в разводах и пятнах ржавчины.
— Да, — на том конце провода хмыкнули, — но уже посмертно.
— Хорошо, — Мик закончил свой десерт и поднялся, — я схожу, помою руки, а потом заплачу.
He smirks and slows his thrusts, letting Greg watch as Sky takes every inch.
“Mm fine.” Greg leans in and kisses John deeply as he holds him close.
He gasps and whimpers. "W-Want to come.."
“I’m not sure actually.” Sherlock thinks.
He blushes and nods, finally looking at him and taking his hand.
John moans and arches. Collin licks and bites at the back of Greg neck.
Sherlock smiles and closes his eyes.
Nina blushes and smiles shyly at the praise, still getting used to positive attention.
He giggles and hums softly, blushing as he feels Mycroft’s now naked body press against his back, kissing his neck.
Sherlock came downstairs slowly, feeling raw and fragile. “Mycroft,” he mumbled, going to the kitchen to make tea. He needed something familiar and calming.
He kisses him hard and pins his wrists above his head as he pounds into him.
"Mm you know they told me about you nickname. Three continents Watson." She smirks.
He moans and rocks with him, reaching for the lube to stretch himself.
"Sky.. You should be dead.. More than dead.."
Greg smirks. "He's done this to himself you know. H-he always liked the drink. More then he ever liked me." He smiles sadly. "S-some nights he'd come home completely pissed and angry. So angry. He tried to hit my mother. I-I made an excellent stand in for her." Greg falls into his memories. "When I first started out as a copper I worked in the domestic abuse division. It was so horrible. I-I transferred out over to homicide. Can you believe that? I found working domestic abuse cases worse then actual murder cases?" Greg laughs hollowly at himself.
Sherlock bit his lip and his face flushed. "Not ticklish."
Mycroft hums. "Hello, dear."
"Good." He smirks and nips at her neck.
"Not right now. That was very good though. Thank you." John smiles.
“Nothing about the occult?” Camille asks seriously.
Mycroft whimpers softly and curls up in his arms. "T-Take care of Sherlock.. He's desperate.. Look at him.."
"Sounds like a plan." He smiles as they go inside.
He smiles happily. "My sweet love."
“Sure.” Sky smiles and leads him to Zack.
He smiles softly and nuzzles him back, cuddling him in bed.
He blushes and nods.
They’re directed to a table for their group.
He blushes and smiles brightly.
‘Mm good.’ She whines as she arches, feeling how heavy and full she is.
She snuggles him.
John nods. “I’m trying to let him explore for himself, taking him new places, but it’s hard. He’s carrying my babies and he doesn’t know anyone, barely, or anything.” He sighs and wraps his arms around Morna’s stomach.
He groans and breathes hard.
“Ah.” John nods. “So you’re a consulting detective?”
He smiles. “God, I love you.”
Greg whimpers, getting close already.
“But that’s what it is. I don’t care what name it has.” Sherlock takes the box and pulls the handle and the projector screen rolls perfectly. “Excellent.” He takes it out to the living room and stands it up, unrolling the screen. He goes back to the table and unboxes a mini projector.
Michael smirks as he feels Sherlock’s cum land on his feet since his cum filled belly is pushing his cock down.
Carol kisses him deeply and puts a cock ring on him before sinking down onto his cock as Collin starts to open him.
"I may be starting to believe them.."
He gasps softly and moans, pressing closer.
Sherlock hums. “I still don’t want her to die.”
Sherlock whimpers and arches.
He continues to fuck her roughly, moving his hand to rub her clit. "Good girl. Make a huge fucking mess for me."
"You're welcome." He smiles. "Sky is probably done if you want to see her before we go see Sherlock. If you still want to see him that is. I could have Mycroft call him if you don't."
"Lets go take a nap.." He nuzzles him.
“Yes, sir,” he said, with a serious face. “You’re bossy when you’re playing protective flatmate,” John said, sitting down on the couch in his usual spot. Was this his usual spot?
He blushes brighter.
His hips buck into her mouth and pulls her hair as he comes hard down her throat.
She hums happily and smiles.
Sherlock soon comes back out, wearing tight black booty shorts.
John nods. “Your brother’s goon?” He asks. “You’re not a mob family are you?”
He relaxes against her lips, happy that she's comfortable.
“Like that?”
He nuzzles him.
He hums happily and nuzzles him.
“Hard already?” He smirks and opens Mycroft trousers as well, taking his cock out.
She kisses his hips as she slowly moves her finger. "I want you to talk. Tell me the dirtiest things you can think of." She smirks and adds a second finger.
He chuckles. “Don’t you have to go with Nina and Danny?”
Sherlock groaned softly and threw more than enough money at him to cover the fare and a generous tip, before spilling out of the cab, pulling John with him. "My room..." He rasps. "It's closer."
"Sherlock?" He asks, holding out a hand to stop his mate.
He stumbles a bit as he gets into the car.
"Why was he lying?"
Sherlock’s eyes roll back into his head with a low moan. “Oohhh..” He pushes back against him roughly. “I want you to be rough..”
He brings over the box and opens it, a large plug with a long ginger tail attached with an intricate chain that cradled his bollocks with a cock ring on the end.
They sleep peacefully throughout the night.
Sherlock closes his eyes and picks up his violin.
Veronica blushes brightly and whimpers breathily. "Mm you look like you could use a snack before going to round up the others." Sky purrs, spreading Veronica's legs wider.
She mewls and keeps her legs open a bit.
"We're going to fill you up over and over. Then you can come."
Sherlock nods. He leaves the room and searches for John’s bag. He finds it behind the reception desk and takes it back in for him. “I love you, one day you’ll be my King.” He promises, before leaving the room and The Diogenes to search for the local fish and chips shop.
Sky smiles happily.
Michael cries out and comes hard as he feels Jean come into him. Benny moans loudly and comes hard into Jean as he clenches around him.
“Hello, love.” Violet moans as she sees George.
"I guess that cat is out of the bag." Sky giggles.
Say what you want 'bout me
“Mm, hey Eli.”
Jake smirks and rubs his prostate teasingly. Benny smirks and hands Jake a vibrating dildo.
Greg kisses John’s back neck as he slowly opens him with his fingers.
“Just wear something comfortable.” She smiles.
“We can actually feed her if you want.”
“Mm on my chest. Over my heart.” Sherlock nods. “That’s where Camille taught Mycroft where to bite. It’s faster acting then the neck.”
“Yes!” She moans loudly, taking everything he gives her.
Collin blushes and takes a drink.
"I told you there was nothing to worry about." Lydia smiles happily.
He sighs softly, wishing he had said goodbye to Mycroft.
As they walk out, Donovan looks over Mycroft and she smirks slightly. "A bit mussed, aren't we?"
John eats happily, enjoying the polite conversation.
He chuckles and holds him.
Once they hear the door shut downstairs, Sherlock begins dashing about, muttering under his breath about "Anderson, I won't work with him."
She squirms as the car stops.
He whimpers and nods weakly. "Y-Yes, sir.. I can do it.."
He moves to suck on her clit.
He gasps in air and moans as he’s filled.
He blushes and giggles. "Might be easier if you did."
"Okay. So I guess we'll meet up for lunch?" Sky smiles.
He swallows around him again, pushing back against Morgan, wanting them to fuck him hard.
Mycroft hums. "Good. Greg and I will visit when you're both up to receiving well wishes, when you get home." He murmurs, already at his computer and typing in passwords. "Don't worry about Dr Stiers." There's a flat, emotionless tone to his voice, the tone of the Iceman. If there was one thing he couldn't stand, it was bigotry against same sex couples.
Дайсуке видел все это, отложив бинокль, взял снайперскую винтовку. Устроился и взял на прицел… Мика. Нападавший стоял так, что его сердце и голова как бы скрывались за телом жертвы. Но Мик прикрывал ПРАВОЙ стороной тела ЛЕВУЮ сторону нападавшего. Дайсуке выбрал точку, навороченный оптический прицел зафиксировал её. Нажал на курок. Дайсуке понабилось все мужество и вся сосредоточенность, чтобы рука не дрогнула и палец на курке не задрожал.
— Джо? Никогда бы не подумал, — удивленно уставился на Джека Макс, — и что она там нашла?
— Normal flight — 11 hours takes. Charter — 9-10, and paragliding — about five to six hours, and that if the first flight will have time...
— Как тебе этот воротила? — спросил Шерлок, собираясь мыться.
— Ясно. Ты их кормил? Снежана их видела?
But the hosts were not, and a tiny Chinese woman worked as a shop assistant in a small shop at the factory. Everything else she was very shy. Guys barely won from her the story of the factory. But the end of the conversation she ceased to be afraid and brought them a lot of meat products. They thanked her and went to the police station.
— And then?
- No no, don't be stupid, Mick. I'm your partner and your friend. And I'm not going to do anything.
— Пока не знаю. Но знаю, что скоро тут будет праздник и что-то в этот праздник произойдет.
The establishment of Kabashi was called "Hotel Campy" a Small two-story structure other staff wedged between the branch of a U.S. Bank and a beauty salon "Alpine rose". Mick was there, three years ago, and poorly remembered that in there. The restaurant was permeated with the smells of traditional Japanese cuisine.
— Они пропали, — ответил Мик, — сегодня утром нашли её, — Мик отложил голографию Рудди, — только в качестве… скелета. Освежеванного и свеженького.
— Это очень нудно, — жаловался Шерлок, носясь по космопорту и, с истинно британской вежливостью, отбирая сыпучие продукты.
— …а тут значит приходит неизвестный тип с серпом и — раз… Большой Билл валится на пол. Кровь хлещет, а голова откатилась, — увлеченно рассказывал бармен в ирландском пабе на Семидесятой улице благодарным слушателям, — и тут входит китаец и несет шар…. И вся кровь устремилась к шару.
Он сидел на огромной кровати в пятизвездочном отеле и в одном из самых дорогих номеров.
— Нет, почему же. Существуют. Просто они здорово изменились. Только пока они об этом не знают.
Only came out on a cloudy day, even to the car still did not come. Suddenly drew a man with a Thompson submachine gun. The first thing fired a burst over their heads. The people quickly ran away, fortunately the street was jam-Packed with all sorts of cafes and boutiques. But someone in fright fell to the pavement and froze in horror. After about twenty minutes there were only three type with a gun  Mick and Max.
— Это жутко, — признался Дайсуке.
- It does not matter - waved Daisuke, -  only you don't think that I'll leave you in the care of this guy. I have also become your bodyguard.
— Рожа у него знакомая.
— Wen Yang!
- I said that in this investigation have done a bloody abyss of errors. In a Black book challenge, part of which was on our maps, was clear note – "...if you have no key and no card, take the first figurines, put them in the row in front of the fading candle of Fabriano, and they will show you the way to the portal...". These are the containers, which contained a map and were the primary keys. But they opened the only entrance to the dimension Y, and the key that we collected, opened the door, which kept the power of the Black devourer.
He finally gets onto the bed. "I'm fine."
He hums happily and kisses him back.
"Let's go see." He leaves the room.
Lydia smiles and hugs John. “You got lost.”
John whines into his mouth, returning the kiss ardently, before opening his eyes and looking at him. "Fuck..." He breathes.
She blushes brighter and opens her mouth wider.
He gasps and moans breathily, pushing back against him.
‘I can’t leave them. I can’t even think about leaving them. It hurts.’ She shakes her head. ‘If he could bring something to eat and drink that would be nice.’
She whimpers and presses her face to the pillows.
John smiles and kisses his head.
She whimpers and arches as she feels him fill her.
"You're welcome." Sherlock replied, holding him close.
“I could’ve handled that. But thank you.”
He curls up against him.
“Buy the whirls then. But I can’t share with you meal time. Unless...” Sherlock shakes his head. “Would you allow me to have my blood in a wine glass? It would look just like red wine. I can drink it whilst you have your meal.” He asks, hoping John would say yes. He has also felt awkward not eating whilst other people do, it makes him feel out of place and a monster.
В машине Мик все-таки соизволил сойти до объяснений.
- Because I hired him. I paid him, so he became a bodyguard Mick`s.
— Твоя правда, — подтвердил Мик, — я поменяюсь с теткой. Она напугана.
— В прямом, — Дайсуке закурил, — вы совершаете покушение на нового главу, я — телохранитель. Погибаю от пуль. Ты, Джек, выходишь на него, и говоришь, что сможешь защитить и товар, и его самого. Но когда у вас встреча — я и Макс сидим с винтовкой на высокой точке и держим врагов на мушке.
- No. I know him well, and his voice seemed very anxious. I think it would be better if we meet him, eye to eye, - Mick singled out some words.
— Да никак, — Джо положила голову Шерлоку на грудь, — они уже пять лет это делают, но, увы. Расплодили истинных арийцев штук десять, наверное. А нового Гитлера так и не видать.
- While we're milling about, all the evidence will wash away, - said Mick, - we'll go in my jeep. There’s a raincoat.
- Have. Take, please, and then the visitor we already pass does not. And I helped you?
Шестого марта Джек следил за Самантой Джобс, а Фред Косторович разговаривал с Джоком.
Mick went, but somehow.
-Is on the other side of town! - Outraged Max,-cannot go?
— Мел прислал, — ответил Мик, — сегодня утром курьер привез.
Голубки были из белой эмали, сердце — из красной, а маленькое сердце — из какого-то самоцвета. Обратная сторона позолочена, но видно было, что медальон бывал во многих переделках. Держался он на серебряной цепочке, тип «Клеопатра».
- Max! Come see me! -  the Lieutenant opened the door of his office.
Ты носишь цветочную юбку
— Да вот какое дело, я тут услышал, что тебя ЗАКАЗАЛИ. Да и никому-либо, а Голго 13. Вот такие дела, Мик! Ты кого-нибудь узнал?
— Я убью тебя сейчас! — прорычал Харуха, пытаясь вытащить оружие, но вовремя увидел две точки от лазерных прицелов, заплясавшие у него на груди.
— Ты же сам сказал, что с ним лучше не связываться!
А еще где-то некий человек внимательно рассматривал свое новое приобретение — фиолетовый звездчатый многогранник. Это было плохое приобретение, но он еще не знал об этом.
— А никак, — отмахнулся Мик, — бери своего свидетеля и пошли ко мне. Пока никого нет.
— Конечно.
- No problem, Mick. Provide me with food... for about a day... and I'll do everything.
Type with the eyebrow again, raised one eyebrow and looked at Daisuke. He shrugged.
— Это что, такое, получается? — спросил Мик, — кто-то свежевал тела?
— А Вонг и Цубаса нам тут не помощники?
— Because you hurt Mick`s. It's not  fault that everything is simple at first glance, things turn mystical. If you don't want to work with him, tell the Lieutenant, and he you somewhere translate.
— Для всякой девичьей фигни?
— Он-то сам в порядке?
— А ты — Харуха Сигуми?! — предположил Мик.
На следующий день ребята отправились к дядюшке Вонгу. В этот раз старый хрыч не стал пользоваться дешевыми трюками и в качестве милости говорил с детективами по-английски.
— Вот и отлезь, — Мик внезапно закашлялся.
— Я телепортировался к Джорджине, а потом спрятался между мирами. Мне надо было подумать, что делать дальше, — ответил Мик, — проблемы были таковы, что я не мог вас бросить на произвол судьбы, но вернуться я тоже не мог. Я подумал, отдохнул и начал проводить расследование. И тот тип, похожий на китайца, вовсе не китаец. А кто он? Трудно сказать…
- Too late to go somewhere? Yes?
— Хочешь покалечиться?
— Нет, но те, кто сидел за соседним столиком?
— За что? — спокойно спросил Мик.
-Yes we seem to have new stuff! - Mick smiled at the Lieutenant.
— Не знаю, — растерянно ответил Джек, — и это мне не нравится. Ладно, — Джек принял решение, — всем внимание! Входим в ресторан!
— Ты права, — Шерлок поднял голову, вздохнул глубоко и задержал дыхание, потому что ему открылась массивная огромная пушка.
— Они мне все говорят, что Мик не работал в полиции, и вообще такого человека не существовало в природе, — всхлипывала Снежана, — ну как же так? Я же помню его прикосновения, голос, волосы, стук сердца и все, что мы с ним пережили, не может быть неправдой? Наверное, Мик погиб, если они так сильно уверены, что его не существовало.
Mick lunged towards him and closed his teeth on his wrist. Max ran up, whacked Chinese guy on the head and, grinning, said: — Stop him chewing!
- Simply stunning boutique "Moon Star", saleswomen are attentive. There I bought jeans, shirts, blouses, shorts, breeches and a bunch of shoes. As well as jackets for all occasions, shoes and hats. And one cowboy took. I have now set – jeans, a blue checked shirt, cowboy boots and hat. And another set of red cowboy shirt, denim swimsuit, shorts with fringe, and boots of the strips. Here. And I still bought the boots, and suddenly we're in the mountains.
— Почему?
- ....to pieces...
Только вышли в пасмурный день, даже к машине еще не подошли. Вдруг нарисовался человек с автоматом Томпсона. Первым делом дал очередь поверх голов. Народ резво дал деру, благо улица была забита всякими кафешками и бутиками. Но кто-то в испуге попадал на асфальт и в ужасе застыл. Через минут двадцать стояли только трое — тип с автоматом и Мик с Максом.
— Я связался с КБРовцами, — ответил лейтенант, — они сказали, что все нормально, никакой вины Мика в том, что произошло, нет. Этого и следовало ожидать, а этот тип, за которым Мик следил, не был столь важным свидетелем, потому что вскрылись какие-то боле важные факты. Они завтра придут к вам.
— Будем ждать. Ордер будет действителен до часу следующего дня, — Мик дико и протяжно зевнул, — а с этого места мы прекрасно видим всю фабрику.
— And this is your buddy, where he flies?
- Cut the poor...
Замок был шикарен. Темные камни обвивал темно-зеленый плющ, черепичные крыши сияли на солнце, умытые прошедшим дождем. Восемь башен гордо возвышались над основным зданием, а основное здание выглядело подтаявшим пряничным домиком.
— Something painfully unassuming lives uncle Wong,  - whispered Max.
— Ты просто скажи…
— Это был я. Я за жизнь Мика отдал бы всё, все сокровища мира, в том числе и свою собственную жизнь.
— Qù cānguǎn, kàn kàn shìfǒu yǒu bèi liú xià myaso.Esli zhuānjiā jiāng jìnxíng dì shísān jiè pàichūsuǒ. (Сходи по ресторанам и посмотри, не осталось ли мясо. Если осталось, отнесете экспертам в тринадцатый полицейский участок)
— Мик! Ты приехал!
— Вообще-то к тебе пришли, — ответил Макс, — лейтенант попросил меня сходить к тебе. Он, конечно, понимал, что после ТАКОГО известия ты вряд ли сможешь работать, но понадеялся…
Мик приехал домой, поставил машину и поднялся к себе в комнату. Весь вечер он ходил туда-сюда, и спать лег где-то в девять вечера. Разбудил его ветер, завывающий за полуоткрытым окном. Мик встал и вышел на веранду. Уставился на океан. С того места, где он стоял, океан был виден очень хорошо. Мик выпрямился и почувствовал, как у него растут крылья. Раскрыл их и взлетел. Прямо к небу, а потом прямо, касаясь кончиком крыла поверхности воды. Над океаном он развернулся лицом к своему дому. За дорогой, на скале стояла машина. Маленькая такая. Мини-Купер красного цвета. А в ней спал… Дайсуке. Мик знал это. Улыбнулся и штопором ушел вверх, пробил тучи и стал парить там наверху. Морозный воздух приятно холодил кожу и раздувал волосы…
— Но о нем волнуются?! — озадачено произнес Макс.
— «Знакомый голос…» — подумал Дайсуке и отключился.
— Нам пришлось поместить в отдельную камеру, — ответил на это Карл, — а у вас, как я посмотрю, тоже все удачно?
— Мик! Ты как раз вовремя! Садись, будешь слушать! — приветствовал его Карл.
- You all live close? — said Mick.
— Я закрою бар и предоставлю тебе помещение. Ключ за черепом, пить будешь?
- What?
— Только напарники?
Сказано — сделано.
А в это время Снежана была в той маленькой антикварной лавке, где она купила медальон. Хозяйка радушно приветствовала её.
— Роджер!!! — крикнул Мик из машины, — иди сюда!
— Прекрасно, — сказал некий представитель ЦРУ, почесывая реденькую бородку, — у нас завелась террористическая группировка. Ну, что же, мисс Скотт, придется вас послушать и начать с вами сотрудничать.
Мик выбрал мясо на косточке, чай и один пончик с черничным кремом. Макс ограничился парой гамбургеров, картошкой фри и кофе. Сидят, едят. Никого не трогают. Закусочная маленькая, народу мало. Обстановка не притязательная, фон что-то пищит за стеной, на визоре — новости. Сидят парни, только челюсти шевелятся. Жуют. И только Мик стал чай пить, а Макс свое кофе допивать, прямо в стекло витрины со всего маху ГРУЗОВИК! Неизвестно куда он целил и, вообще, куда водитель ехал, но эта огромная махина снесла полстены и пять столиков, что оказались на пути. После чего уперся в стойку и остановился. Но все, кто за столиками, погибшими под колесами, сидел, остались живы. Мало того, они сидели и жевали, пребывая в шоковом состоянии. Макс смотрел на Мика. Тот допивал чай. Грузовик пролетел за спиной Макса, и до сих пор там стоял.
— О чем лейтенант ДОЛЖЕН мне рассказать? — насторожился Мик.
Тип с автоматом близко к Мику подходить не стал. Он остановился, тетку кинул на асфальт, прижал ей ногу, чтоб не уползла, и стал копаться у себя в карманах. Минут тридцать он там ковырялся, все, лежащие на асфальте, кроме невезучей тетки, уползли в безопасные места. Наконец он достал клочок бумаги, расправил его и начал вдумчиво его изучать, поглядывая то на Мика, то на бумагу.
- You are right, mA'am,  - Mick sent the old lady a kiss and walked to the stairs.
-Have you put on today? -asked Max.
— Интересно. Когда?
- Mr. Francis live here?
Рейд Роджера в логово Большого Брата Бонзазы и Хитрована Хуана оказался не напрасным. Детективы узнали, что аукцион уже прошел, и хрустальный шар благополучно исчез из города.
А там…
— Почему Цубаса и Вонг? — спросил Макс, когда они выходили из ломбарда.
-About Florida listened! Now let's move to Hawaii. There is now warm and well. Meet Beatty Omit "The girl from Honolulu".
- And you, girl, it why? - the mistress, a stout young woman of about thirty, looked at Snezhana. Because of the nanomachines that were in her system, over time  Snezhana had no mastery. Now she looked like she was eighteen or twenty.
— What else can we draw from this case?! — angry Max — we have not the slightest clue?
- ...Maybe in a couple of days... BU-BU-BU-BU.
- Don't worry,  - the voice of Mick`s got the usual mocking tone, - both arrow's already dead, Phoenix called a patrol. They'll be here soon.
«Что такое случилось?» — с внезапной тревогой подумал Мик, — «похоже, что это он меня жалеет. А почему? Ладно, спрошу у лейтенанта». Спрашивать не пришлось, лейтенант сам зазвал Мика в кабинет.
— А вон он! Столик у окна. Только он сегодня нервный какой-то.
— Я рад за них, — устало ответил Мик, — все. Я ем и спать.
— А почему ты взяла медальон? Поездка в город у залива связан с ним?
— As you say, -  Mick beckoned Max and they walked out the door. Twenty minutes later they returned, carrying three full bag of food.
— Но, Мик, возможно — это твоя судьба… — протянул Дайсуке.
— Вроде погони не наблюдается.
— Хорошо, — ответил Дайсуке, — а то я сейчас не у дел, и мне реально скучно.
- Can try to get to my life before the others...
— На цикле. Он около дома. Я не знал, как ты отнесешься к моему предложению, и поэтому приготовился к штурму в одиночестве.
- Seven hours.
— Почему?
-And there's rain, wet, -snorted Bill.
— Мик вернется на работу. Он тоже будет искать то, что ищет его.
Дайсуке не загребли только потому, что он не лез в опасные места. Но информации он получил целый воз и маленькую тележку.
— Привет, Мик! — раздался жизнерадостный вопль Ре, — а мы к тебе едем!
— А это уже не моя проблема, это уже ваша, — и парень присоединился к остальным врачам.
— А где остатки машины?
— No. I came to ask, where did you get that locket that I bought you yesterday?
- A good sign..., - said Max.
— From what side to look, — said Mick, — the state pays us for that we had to clean the city from those whom the state does not pay for the dirty work. Although... there are people there, who also live in the contentment of the state, only one does not advertise it.
- Drove Snezhana...
- But Jen didn't call me. I was a little concerned. But it's been three days and Jen is not the hearing, not the spirit. I, naturally, called Catarina, and it turns out that the girls didn't come home, both of you. Then I met Katarina. We live in neighbouring streets and, after discussing the situation, went to the house where the party was being held. And the mother of Snoopy Laluka, the guy in the house, which all this was carried out, also do not know. He and Snoopy had disappeared.
— Ясно. Ладно, можешь идти. Глаз с Мика не спускай.
-Again under the rain! - Said Max, - I don't want.
Half an hour later both sat on the stairs and silently watched the men in white coats. Experts came later. While all the people ran here and there, Max went back to preoccupying his subject:
— Ведь твоя новая подружка живет где-то здесь?
— Конечно. Ты — умный парень и крайне перспективный. Твои связи с множеством людей из разных социальных слоев могут сослужить пользу и тебе, и нам.
Джо была согласна. Но она знала, ЧТО скрывается за фасадом.
To think failed. Type with a gun kicked out the aunt, ran up to Mick`s and tried to take him hostage. Mick butted type head, grabbed the barrel and jerked it on itself. Type pulled the trigger. Mick pulled away. Type stared off into the distance and fell face down. Max approached the body and turned him on his back. The hole in the right eye and in the forehead. One hole bigger, second smaller.
- How are you doing?
— На сутки…
— А тогда как они попали к нашим покойничкам?
— Как можно быстрее, мы идем по следу весьма непростых людей, и они не остановятся….
- So. Where did she go?
— I'm here — and led them into a room of psychological unloading. Max followed him. Women were three. First — complete with brown hair that gently fell across her shoulders. Her face wore traces of tears. Cosmetics it was not observed. Under the cloak of broken-in jeans and unknown color big men's t-shirt perestirannye and stretched. The second woman was thin, with a large knot on the back of the head, which knocked red curls. She was dressed in a long satin gown the color of overripe cherries. She gloomily looked at the police. The third spread a strong smell of Valerian and was like a well-fed cat of Persian breed, black in color. Small with petite features and a few rasplyvsheysya figure. It was the only silk dress in yellow little white flowers.
Mycroft whimpers and nods, kissing him again. "Love.." He mouths against his lips.
"What do you think?" Zack comes out wearing a pale blue v-neck, it hugs him perfectly and shows off his hard earned muscles.
“Everything alright?” Hank frowns.
“I..” Crystal thinks. “I’d never want to be without either of you. I’d never do anything to hurt you. I’d do everything to keep you from harm. I’d kill anything they even thought of harming you. I’d die before I’d let anything happen to either of you. That’s how I love you.”
He blushes and closes his eyes. "Toast and eggs."
“They like your new body as well.” John says softly. “If you’re not comfortable with anything they do, from touches to wolf-whistles just tell them and they’ll stop.” He promises as he helps Sherlock into the pool.
“Never thought of it honestly. Just thought you preferred the dark to make you look cooler and more mysterious.” John chuckles and smiles.
“Daddy..” She gasps and whimpers. She rocks back onto George’s cock and forward to lick Collin’s.
"Trying to get me drunk?" Turk chuckles softly.
He blushes. 'I might not mind that.' He grins a bit, his eyes flicking up to Benny.
Sherlock blushes and meets him at the stairs, holding Jared as he leans in to kiss him. “Welcome back.”
“Good boy.” Eli slowly starts to unbutton his shirt.
Greg and Eli pound into her. “Let her bring anyone. I’m sure Sky and Sherlock could use more cocks.”
John can feel his burned skin under the bandages. He tries to focus on Mycroft's monitor. He can see the heartbeats rise and fall and his respiration rate but he can’t hear the beeps. The monitors always beep. John tries to listen harder. He can't hear the monitor beep, he can't hear Sherlock and Greg sleeping breaths from the couch, he can't hear the sheets move under his bandaged hand. His eyes widen when he finally realizes it. He can't hear anything.
John pants as his body tightens, preparing to release his load over them both. He looks up at Sherlock, unable to speak, but hoping he can understand.
He bites his lip and holds him close. "I.. I love you."
John giggles breathily.
“I want it. I want it so deep. Give it to me. Give it all to me. My body is trying to hard. So very hard to give you babies. It’s desperate. Absolutely desperate for it. Why won’t you give it what it wants? Why won’t you give me more babies, Grandfather? I just want to be a good little breeding whore for you. Let me. Please let me.” She babbles and begs. “I’ll even let you pick how many babies you put in me. Any number you want. I carry them all for you.” She moans as her tits bounce, making a growing puddle of milk on the floor under her.
"We'll always come back. No matter what." Sky nuzzles him affectionately.
Leona nods. “A quill usually. Why don’t you teach me sigil’s when we get to Ireland.” She offers.
Tucker grins and sneaks up behind them, ruffling Zack’s hair and messing it up.
Sherlock smiles and closes his eyes as he waits for him to come back.
'I love you, too.'
"Turk, please be careful.."
Mycroft hesitated. "I... I was?" He whispered, unsure.
He smiles softly. “Can we cuddle?”
Michael keeps his hands on Sky's hips as they dance.
Mycroft smiles. "Thank you, love."
Greg smiles and pets his hair. "I'm here, love.." He holds him close.
He gasps and moans loudly, gripping Benny's hair and tugging as he fucks his face.
"Daddy please!" He begs sounding completely destroyed and desperate for Mycroft.
"What, bee?" Mycroft runs his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
“You should fuck him. Look how desperate he is already.” George smirks.
"I love you, too.." He turns him around and kisses him softly.
“Has Magdala read them?” Crystal asks softly. “You should feed from me. You’re looking weak.
He bites his lip and tightens his grip on him. "I.. I couldn't find you.."
He blushes and nods. "Yes, sir."
He smiles and pulls away, going downstairs.
Stunned slightly, Mycroft swallows on instinct, The bitter salty fluid rolling down his throat as he groans around the man.
‘Smelled like you brought some new people home.’
She purrs and presses kisses to his jaw.
“Good girl. Such a good little slut for Daddy. Letting Daddy fuck you anytime, even when you’re sleeping. Keeping your holes open for me at all times.” He smirks against her neck.
He strokes his cock slowly and eases a second finger into him.
"I promise. I'm fine. It's just a lot to deal with." He shrugs.
"My wife Marie did most of the decoration. I've never had an eye for that sort of thing." He smiles and shrugs.
He licks up the underside of Mycroft's cock with his wet hot tongue.
He moans and whimpers. "All for you."
He blushes and nods.
He smiles happily and holds his hand as they walk to their seats for Mycroft and Greg's wedding.
Sherlock gasps and moans. "Fuck. Yes, Collin. More, please.."
“Need you. Always need you. Haven’t had you in ages.” She whimpers.
Mycroft looks and sees them moving. “Oh my God.” He breaths. “How is this possible?” He looks up at Diōnē, a broad smile on his face.
Chloe smiles and nuzzles Zack.
He moans loudly, holding onto him tightly. “Yours, Daddy.”
Sherlock groans and kisses John desperately.
"No she's not." Sky sits Lucy on her head and she could up like a crown on top of her head.
“It’s all so good.” Greg nods enthusiastically.
"Oh god I'm going to come again." She whines as her pussy pulses around his cock.
“Mm, alright. I’ll see if I can find her.”
Eli pushes Sherlock’s hair out of his face. “Okay?”
"No. I saw you get flush and your hips rocking into her mouth. She had disappeared and you were fucking someone's face under the table. Wasn't to hard to figure out." He smiles softly.
After Lestrade has picked up Ryan and taken him away, Sherlock flounces out of his bedroom, dressed in his old, worn pajama pants and t-shirt, robe fluttering in the breeze. Slamming around the kitchen, making himself tea.
“Ask me again when you’re more than a week sober.” Mycroft hums.
He whimpers needy, submitting to him.
He bites his lip. "Is it okay if we don't fool around today while we're out? Unless I change my mind, I just.."
"Take me to bed and show me how much you're going to miss me."
Camille rubs Anthea’s back. “It’s okay. I can look after him now. I can look after you and Mycroft, that’s my job.”
She looks at him skeptically.
You’d be like heaven to touch
He smiles softly and washes his hair gently.
Sky moans and rocks back, fucking herself on Turk’s huge cock.
"I.. Wh-Why did we feel like that?"
Mycroft stands suddenly and walks out.
“I love you, too.” Sherlock holds John close, Margaret curled to his side.
“I will. I promise.” Morna whines, looking down at her huge belly.
John nods and stands, before reaching out for Sherlock’s hand. “Don’t leave me.” He whispers, hoping Sherlock understood how much he needed him.
“I want to lick you. Everywhere.” John licks his lips.
“My, that was the hottest thing I’ve ever experienced in my entire life.” Greg nods enthusiastically.
Sherlock smiles and looks to John. “Where are we going?”
She giggles softly then moans as the cock shifts inside her.
"What should I make for breakfast?"
Greg moans and kisses him back.
“Perfect.” Sherlock nods, putting the mugs in the sink.
Margaret whines. “Sorry, Sir.”
He bites his lip. "I.. Yes.. I wanted to say hi.."
They entered Mycroft's office.
Just being able to touch Sherlock again makes him feel like they're making progress.
"You've done an amazing job raising her.. You're a brilliant father.." He smiles softly and kisses him.
“I’ve never had a Joe before.” He blushes.
He kisses him back weakly. "I love you so much.."
"Mm I'll take such good care of you." He nibbles on his lip and rubs his prostate gently as he holds him closer. "God, I want to see that. Watch how you get yourself off. How do you do it? How do you make yourself scream and shake and shatter?" He sucks on his neck and slowly takes his fingers out of him. "I'll make you feel good, baby. So so good. You'll never want to be off Daddy's cock again. I'll make you come so many times that nothing will come out when your orgasm and then I'll keep going until you can't even breathe let alone think about coming again."
"Where next?" He kisses his neck.
Sherlock blushes and nuzzles John.
"Okay." She kisses him softly and takes him into his head.
"Fuck my face, Sherlock.."
"Please! I need it so bad. Can think without it. I'm no use without carrying your children inside me. Please give me, them."
"Mm." Greg sighs a curls closer. "Night, My."
"Come on."
"Okay.." She nods.
"Make Sky squirt." Veronica smirks.
John nuzzles down against Sherlock's body, whimpering a bit when Sherlock finally slipped out of him.
He whimpers, trembling. "S-Sky.."
He hums happily and nuzzles him back. “Mm if that was a preview I’ve no idea what the main event is gonna be like.” He chuckles.
"Oh, hello dear. I'm Mrs. Holmes, this is my mate...and our son, Sherlock." Mummy nudged Sherlock.
He studies Greg’s face. “You sure?”
Sherlock cries out and arches his back. Mycroft looks down at Greg as he pushes into him.
Greg blushes. "As are you, hun."
Mycroft yawns and hums softly. "Mm.."
Veronica purrs and sinks down to her knees between his legs. "Ohh you're in for a treat, Daddy." Sky sinks down between his legs as well. Veronica opens his trousers and pulls them down. They both mouth at his cock over his pants and look up at him from their knees.
"Of course, baby." He kisses him softly. "If you need to stop at any point just tell me and we'll stop. Okay?"
He kisses him back and hums.
John kisses him tenderly as he sinks deeper into him.
"Think you can take two in your arse and two in your mouth?"
"Mm thank goodness I have all of you to keep me sane.." He hums happily and smiles softly.
"Good boy. Touch yourself."
He blushes brightly and nods. "Y-yes.."
“Your hands belong on me.” John smiles.
"That was fun."
She pulls him in and kisses him softly.
“Definitely a mastermind.” Sherlock chuckles.
He continues to slowly massage her.
“Why in Lucifer’s name would you do that?” Mycroft frowns.
John slowly comes down, blinking up at Sherlock. “Sherlock.” He pants. “That was... epic.”
He blushes. "I believe you are."
Mycroft smiles. "I didn't think you'd have time to make it."
He groans, arching a bit.
"Are you going to come from just my words?"
Zack blushes and smiles as everyone gives them congratulations. He looks to his mum to see how she was reacting.
"Make yourself at home, don't wait up," Sherlock says, twining his scarf around his neck then dashing down the stairs.
“What happened?”
'Okay. Good.' She smiles.
He quickly finishes eating, thankful to have fresh food again. ‘I’m glad you found nice people.’
"Moriarty's husband. Well widower now.."
"Come on, baby girl. Give me what you've got." Turk smirks. Sky growls and does a flying kick to his chest, sending him flying backwards into the wall. "Rule one, never call me baby girl." She snarls as he pulls himself out of the wall, leaving a huge hole.
“Of course yeah. Go have fun with your visitors.”
He smirks as he watches her. 'God, you're fucking perfect. Made for this.'
She raises a brow and listens.
He cries out and arches his back. "P-Pull my hair!"
Greg turns off the alarm and kisses his forehead. He slips out of bed trying not to wake him. He smiles down at him and takes a picture of sleepy Mycroft wrapped in the blankets like a burrito. He goes about his morning routine and gets dressed.
Sabine stares through streaming eyes at first her own reflection and then at Irene's. She knows that the other woman is right, that she should be happy. She swallows hard around the lump in her throat. "I've tried to tell myself so many times." She mumbles. "It's hard to school yourself out of forty years of abuse." She let out a choked sob. "I'm sorry, I'm a bloody mess."
Mycroft smiles a bit. "Here I am."
Fitz wraps his hand around the back of Mycroft’s head.
He blushes lightly. "The feeling is mutual, Sherlock." He smiles.
She smiles softly and cuddles her.
Sherlock shakes his head and then stops. “Just now on the couch..”
He blushes and ducks his head at the compliment.
John hurries down the stairs, to Flat A. "Mrs Hudson! Mrs Hudson!" He knocks on the door.
He blushes and nods to a thick one. “That one.”
He blushes and leans up to kiss him softly.
Crystal smiles softly and nods, taking Mycroft’s hand and following him out.
He smiles and hums. "H-Hey."
He kisses him back happily. "Do you still want to go bowling?"
He smiles happily against her lips. 'I love you.'
Anthea gasps and only makes soft little noises. “That’s better.” Duke smirks and looks to Mycroft as his hand print starts to show on Anthea’s breast. “Have you ever slapped one before?” He asks Mycroft.
Mycroft blushes and clings to Sherlock’s arm. “Hi, er hello... Ma’am.” He whispers, not too sure how to address her, especially sitting half naked by her pool.
"Mm good boy.." He kisses him deeply.
"It's fine, darling.." Lydia smiles at her.
He wraps his legs and arms around him.
Sherlock smirks at the look of John's face.
She kisses her back softly. "Thank you.."
John bites his lip and nods. “He does.”
He smiles softly and rubs her back.
Greg reaches out for Mycroft but finds his side of the bed empty. He makes an irritated noise and rolls over onto Mycroft's side. It's still warm. Greg hears Mycroft talking on the phone and he sounds mad.
“Wanna be full. Wanna be so full. Please please.” She begs, relaxing around them so they can push even deeper into her. “Mm yes. Then we’ll plug her up. Make he use every drop. Make her give us huge litters. Make her have so many pups for us.” Darius groan as he pounds her pussy, making slick wet noises each thrust.
He hums and holds her. "Mm.. need a nap."
He pouts.
They pound into her, claiming her.
He blushes and kisses her back. "I.. I did?"
"Fuck, Sherlock. That's..." He doesn't end the sentence, rather wanting to kiss Sherlock some more.
“You just want to be so full of babies, don’t you?” He smirks, fucking her hard and faster.
Sherlock watches as John manages to calm Jared down, a bit amazed.
“Mm is that right?” He nibbles and sucks at her breasts, ignoring her nipples to tease her. “How many?”
John nods. “Okay sweetie. You’ve not had a contraction for a while. Do you think they’re moving lower? Or should we get up and walk around a bit?”
John smiles. “What are you looking at?” He asks softly, only seeing blank walls.
"She's quite good at it." She hums as she watches Sky schmoozing at George's side.
Greg raises an eyebrow. “What could you possibly learn from me?”
“It's not my fault, Daddy. You filled me up with so much cum and I didn’t want to waste a single drop. Plus I was so horny and turned on that makes me even more fertile.” Sky blushes brightly, letting that secret slip.
"Fish bit my toe, it tickled," he explained when he'd stopped laughing.
Mel moans as she’s pissed on, drinking whatever fills her mouth.
She hums happily and kisses him back.
Sherlock laughs softly. "I hope you won't be mad when your memory comes back fully..." He murmurs.
John pulls him close and rubs his back.
They follow him inside.
She whimpers and clenches around his fingers as she gets close again.
Greg's father George is reading the paper as he sips tea. "Morning." George hums as he looks up from his paper at Mycroft.
“Yup.” Veronica smiles. “Starving.” Carol giggles.
Greg turns and hides his face in Sherlock's shoulder.
"Maybe," John murmurs, holding him closer. "But it's worth it."
"You should get tetanus, and rabies shot, if you aren't up to date. You probably ingested some of his blood, and who knows if he's clean or not."
"Good. I'm going to hang up now, okay?"
Greg walks away from Max obviously annoyed. Max reaches out and grabs Greg's arm trying to pull him back. "You have no right to touch me!" Greg snaps and jerks his arm away freeing himself from Max.
“You’re never going to lose me, Sherlock. I won’t leave your side until you order me away.” John holds him tighter closer.
He smiles and nuzzles her back.
He closes his eyes and hums. "If you'd like."
"They're my favorite because they're so soft and warm. We're both still kind of sleep and it's a bit of a mess but it so sweet and I love it.."
Crystal pulls out the dildo, struggling to sit up. “I... I can do it.” She groans, not wanting any help.
"Sky? Yes, she's practically my daughter."
'I just wasn't expecting it.. I should've because I know that was a trigger for you. I should've remembered.'
"Talk to me. I love it when you talk to me." She purrs, starting to ride him faster.
"Mm.."
"So fucking needy. I love it." He kisses him hard as he starts to fuck him for a third time. He texts Sherlock. **Come upstairs. Bring John. Now.--GL** "Mm they're going to come up and see my cock buried in your arse." He growls and nips at his neck.
"Should we put them to bed?" Collin nods over to Mycroft Sherlock and now Greg all sleeping on the couch together.
He continues to suckle from her.
James slowly takes his time walking around Sherlock and inspects him as Jason does the same going the other direction. “Mm check list?” Jason smirks as he looks at the list on Sherlock’s back.
“Like it?” Sky nuzzles her.
John chuckles softly and smiles, squeezing Sherlock’s hand before letting him go. “I’ll see you soon. Fi în siguranță, dragostea mea.”
Sherlock cries out as he comes hard suddenly, squirting around Mycroft.
Mycroft smirked and continued to ignore him.
"Don't you sound put out, Greggy." Max chuckles.
She pulls down her sleeves subconsciously to hide her bruised arms. "About a year ago.. He said it wouldn't happen again after. He said it every time after but there is always a next time.."
He hums. "Come here."
Myropis frowns. “You remember him?” He asks.
They just walk around the city.
"What are they mad about? Me ordering that desk jockey around? That's his bloody job, to help Omegas like me. He messed up, miscalculated when I needed to swap brands."
"My files.." She hums and pulls out stacks of files and flash drives. "Everything I ever did for Moriarty. Every medical test I've ever been subjected to. This is me on paper and memory.."
“Last night, not much, but the night before, you said that...” Sherlock shakes his head softly. “I declared my love for you, you were asleep I thought it was safe, and then you replied with ‘love, Lock’. I started asking you questions and apparently you have... fantasies about me. One sounded like you would be on your knees.” He says softly, he buries his face into John’s hair, so John doesn’t have to look him in the eyes.
Everyone makes their way to the table.
"Please, Daddy. I want you in my arse. I want you and Eli to fuck me."
Sherlock's whimper turns into a small, broken sob as he drops the blade and scrambles into Greg's arms, clutching his shirt tightly. The blood from his cut stains Greg's shirt.
He rocks his hips, groaning at the sensation. "Oh my god.. This is amazing.."
He moans happily and swallows greedily.
Mycroft puts his phone down and rubs his eyes. He goes to get himself another drink before noticing the decanter is nearly empty. He sighs, too tired to pour the blood out into a glass and drinks it straight from the decanter. He leaves it outside his office door and retires into a secret room next to the bookcase where he lays down on his bed.
Mycroft slowly lets him go, licking his cum off his hand.
He blushes and nods, leaning back and smiling up at him.
"Will do." She chuckles as she gets her tears back under control.
Eli’s eyes drag over her as she mewls, smirking a bit. “Problem?”
He frowns a bit. “I know that Sherlock’s sleeping with Mycroft and everyone else has someone to sleep with and I.. I was hoping to sleep with James but I.. I don’t think he wants to. He left while I was explaining myself and I just.. I don’t want to be alone..” he blinks away tears.
“Good girl. I’m going to get you relaxed and I’ll set up the machine to fuck you. Then I’ll continue with the massage. Okay?”
“Well long story short you were under some mind control.” Sky frowns.
"Knowing you that won't be for long."
“Then that’s just you watching me eat.” John frowns. “Is there no restaurant for vampires?”
"I saw that." Greg whispers in Sherlock's ear as he takes a secretive sip as well.
"Never have I ever. Someone asks a question and if you have done what they asked then you drink but if you haven't then you don't drink."
“Okay.” John nods.
Kia strips immediately, her small perky breasts and soft curves on display as she gets on her hands and knees. “Your cock is so big.” She whines softly.
“Okay.” Cecil nods and kisses his forehead.
Udos smiles and pulls Sherlock pants down around his knees, before stripping off his own clothes. He growls as he nuzzles his thick cock into Sherlock’s hole. “I see why John like you, pretty boy.”
"Mmhmm." Sky nods.
He moans and kisses him back needy.
"Thank you.."
“That’s.. Thats amazing.” She grins.
“So handsome.” He smiles softly.
She moans into his mouth. "I really really really need you to fuck me."
"So you won't have Rosie tomorrow?" She asked.
She whines happily and bends over for him.
"Ta," John says to both Sherlock's words and the blanket. He replaced one of his thinner blankets with the new one, sighing as the weight settles around him
He cups her face, wiping her tears away.
“Mm, don’t bother with one.”
“How should we use you, then?”
"I love you, too.." She smiles softly.
"God, you're gorgeous. You know how to take cock don't you? Just a perfect little slut for us."
John moans and rocks up into Margaret. “Fuck, baby. You know how to make a man your bitch.”
He smiles softly and gets the dried off.
Jake smiles and leans against him, feeling a bit buzzed.
He takes a breath and nods, obviously relieved.
She blushes and smiles brightly.
He smiles softly and relaxes.
"Mm, should we get up?"
He grips his hips tighter and bites John's thigh next to his face over his shoulder. He thrusts harder and harder being spurred on by John's sounds.
"Of course." She nods.
He breathes heavily. “Fuck..”
He sips his pint. "Where do you want me to fuck you?"
She moans, riding him faster.
He moans louder, swallowing and gagging a bit around his cock.
He pushes it in deeper, smirking. “Mm. Ready for another?”
"So what are we doing now?" Eli smiles as the party starts to die down.
He leans in and kisses him gently.
"Of course." He nuzzles him.
“He is the god of creation but can’t create new gods.” John shrugs.
"Of course. I'm here for you. I'll even go with you tomorrow."
Michael pulls back to eat.
He kisses him back desperately, gasping as John pushes in another finger. “Please, Daddy. Want you both to use me.”
Michael moans loudly as he comes hard into Sky, biting at her neck.
She hums and follows him out.
“You’re okay. I’m right here.” Irene sits next to Sabine.
Mel whimpers and rocks between them faster.
"My mum never let us under her bed." John said after a moment's thought. "Harry and I used to play hide and seek, but we weren't allowed to hide under their bed."
"Oh fuck yes." She sobs as her cunt continues to pulse as he fucks her, dragging out her orgasm.
Mycroft kisses him. "I love you. I love you."
Mycroft smiles and wraps his arms and Magdala rocking into her.
Carol moans and her cunt throbs desperately, leaking everywhere.
Michael blushes as he feels Eli raise his arm.
He smirks and fucks him harder. “How hard?”
"Such a good boy." He praises and pushes his back against the pool wall, striping them of their swim trunks.
“Fuck... such a good girl.”
Kia drools around Morna’s breast, dripping milk down them both.
He smiles and nuzzles him as he relaxes.
Irene smiles softly. Soon they pull up to the hotel and Irene leads them out.
Sherlock smiles and caresses his face.
“Okay.” She grins excitedly.
You and I collide
Camille runs her fingers through his hair.
He whimpers and nods desperately.
Cecil holds onto him tightly afraid he'll slip away of he lets go. He presses against him and kisses him deeply.
Greg moans loudly as he comes hard into Mycroft.
The waitress drops off the check.
Crystal moans and leans into Greg.
She moans breathily and presses closer, her breasts rubbing against his chest.
"I love you, too."
His body still trembles a bit as he sits in John's lap, smiling up at him. "Thank you, Sir." He feels himself slipping into subspace, his mind going blissfully blank.
He moans and holds his hips to guide him, thrusting up into him as he comes down.
"She's right, John.. We're a family of freaks."
“You’re so good to me.” Morna whines as a powerful contraction makes her knees weak.
He blushes and cuddles against him. “Should we set up another swing for me, Daddy?”
He cracks a grin, remembering Sherlock's complaint the previous night.
He blushes and moans as his mouth is filled, swallowing slowly so Greg can feel.
Greg's earlier panic vanishes as they run and he can actually breathe normally again.
He blushes and holds Greg's hand. "Gregory and I are getting married."
Mycroft leans back against the bed. **You've made me like this. --MH**
Veronica blushes as Chloe comes to her, knowing how dominant Chloe can be when she feels like it.
He writhes on the bed and tips his head back, giving her more room.
“Mm don’t go.” John slurs a bit.
“Please, Mummy. Need it so bad.” Sherlock begs, whimpering.
"Alright watch me and then you can do it too. You take a bit of dough about this size and roll it between your palms like this till its in a nice ball. Then you drop it gently into the sugar and roll it around until the whole surface area is cover. Finally you like them up on the baking sheet like this." Greg does the process as he talks through the steps.
John smiles and kisses his head.
He whimpers and moans. "Yes, sir!"
Mycroft frowns, getting up to follow him.
“Mmhmm.” Sally smirks.
Lydia knocks on the door before they enter. "Good morning everyone." She smiles. John waves and Greg nods hello.
Sherlock smiles and kisses John tenderly. “Go back to sleep. We want you fit and well.” He says softly.
Irene finishes up her work with her client and sends him on his way when his time is up.
"You have *no* idea." Sherlock smirks. "Back soon." And he slipped out the bedroom door.
“I know. Thank you Di, it means a lot. But from what I’ve read, it seems more accidental that he found you.” Magdala frowns.
"Mm. You'll have to wait and see." He smirks a bit.
Collin knows George is watching him so he bends over and looks through the cabinet for the box, keeping his arse on display for George.
Greg chuckles and kisses his cheek.
He eases his fingers out. “Alright baby.. do you want me to use a condom?”
"*Et le plateau de fromages, monsieur?*" The waitperson asks, pen poised over their notebook. (“What about the cheese board, sir?”)
"Morning, My.. Coffee and breakfast are on the counter.." Greg hums and smiles softly.
They stay like that for another fifteen minutes before John finally suggests they sit back down and watch some telly. They curl up on the too small couch together, just enjoying being with each other.
Later that evening, Sherlock came out of his room, wearing a pair of sinfully tight leather pants and a snug fitting shirt. He grinned at John.
She blushes and hides her face in his chest.
“Good. I know you like being manhandled.” He chuckles.
"And you're going to love every second of it." She growls softly and sucks marks into his neck as she grinds against him.
He bites his lip and nods.
‘Only one other person.’
John leads Sherlock and Kia to the bunnyholes. “Now we’ve got to be patient, they’re probably in their homes right now, we need to wait for them to come out.” He explains.
"Did you think Mummy did a good job on the decorations?" Carol beams at her son as she watches him look at everything.
He blushes and smiles, tilting up to kiss him.
"Mm.. nap.."
He moans breathily and nods. "Christ, yes.. Please.." He whimpers.
"Good boy." John praises and strokes him teasingly. "I won't. Feels so good." Sky mewls, hard nipples so sensitive as she rubs against him.
“It did.” Violet hums, starting to feel the twinges if contractions.
She stretches up and kisses him back.
"I'll leave your door cracked, so when Gladstone needs to go outside, he can nudge it open," John said to Percy.
They laugh and smile as they tickle him.
She curls up with her and hums.
Mycroft frowns. “Gregory, Sky, and Sherlock were all taken and tortured. Sherlock and Sky more than once.”
“Okay.” Margaret smiles and follows him inside.
He spreads his legs more for him. “Please, sir.”
Sherlock looks to Mycroft and frowns. "Myc, how long is John going to be gone for?"
Michael groans. "Fuck, she's getting even wetter."
Sky pants under the strain, cum and slick dripping down her legs enticingly. “The shot me up with fertility drugs. As if I’m not fertile enough. I can’t stop leaking.”
He smiles a bit and hums softly. "I am now.."
John starts slightly, but relaxes again, putting a warm hand on Sherlock's ankle.
Francis hums. “Remind me to give you my number before you all leave.”
He whimpers and moans, arching up. "Please!!"
“Nothin.” She hums and stretches up, kissing his neck.
[Exactly. She seems to think you were using again and that's the reason I left.]
John breathes hard and his limbs feel like jelly.
John slowly twirls his tongue around her clit, rubbing her thighs as he sucks on it.
“If you really want jumpers, I can buy you them, but richer wool. Thicker and designer. More expensive.” Sherlock explains. “You’re giving me your blood so I want to give you the world.”
He groans. "Christ.. and she was right. I just needed to see your pretty pussy and my cock is rock hard."
John slowly deepened the kiss, taking his time.
John strips, leaving his clothes on the ground as he dives into the pool. "James should be out soon."
“God I love it when you make the desperate.” He smirks.
"He'll be at Veronica's party tonight. You can meet him then." He smiles.
“Ohhh fuck oh fuck.” Sherlock trembles.
Magdala sighs and shakes her head. “I’ve been researching it for the most of my life. I can’t... find anything that suggests breaking a blood pact, unless we have the person who originally created it, it can’t be a descendant.” She explains, “I’m sorry ma’am.”
“Sherlock… I can’t… I can’t… ” He looked desperately at Sherlock, not knowing what to do. He was a bloody doctor, why couldn’t he work out what to do?
Sherlock nods as John and Greg emerge from the bathroom. "L-look at you two.. T-thick as thieves." Greg chuckles and sits next to Mycroft. John frowns slightly at Greg's stutter buts let's it rest on the back burner.
"Thank you, John. I love you too."
Matt frowns and tries to relax. “Why is she asking? Where is she?”
"Oh." She takes the card and looks it over. "So your daughter's name is Rosie?" She's loitering around the blanket though she's now watching the two girls. "That's a lovely name for such a cheerful girl. And they should get on right as rain if she likes feeding the ducks. My Mina would take one home if she could. She used to visit a duck pond with her father before he passed away. It's why we moved actually. Too many memories." She put the card in her pocket, "are you...is Rosie's mother gone as well? It's only...you have a certain look about you."
"I know.." Jake bites his lip.
“I’m glad I have you back. I missed you.” Morna nuzzles John.
He holds him and dozes next to him.
He smiles shyly as she continues.
He bites his lip. "Please.."
‘Oh.’ She says shyly and nods. ‘Getting caught fucking me in animal form would’ve be good for the men.’ She giggles, dripping nonstop.
"Sleep love."
John woke the next day feeling relaxed and refreshed, alone on the couch, covered by a blanket with a pillow under his head. The night before was now a fuzzy, distant memory, but he thought he remembered Sherlock rubbing his head and shoulders. Or maybe he just dreamt that. He remembered making a bloody idiot of himself trying to navigate a bizarre conversation about Sherlock and a love interest. God, how had they lived together for a year and not talked about this before? As disappointed as John was, he was going to be as helpful and supportive of his friend as he could be.
Sherlock takes a breath and relaxes some. “Okay.” He nods.
Sherlock sighs as he replays memories in his mind palace of John, before imagining what he would look like as a child, playing with his sister and getting underneath his mother’s feet.
“Okay?” He asks softly and caresses his face.
She smiles softly and kisses her back softly. "I'd love that."
John groans, kissing him back.
“Mm, I’ll wait.”
Lydia nods and sits back down next to Luciel. “Okay, Locky.” She giggles.
"Good girl. Tell us what you want."
He smiles happily.
Mycroft frowns. "Wait, is that Tiger?"
She mewls and arches.
"Ready to go?" Eli smirks.
He smiles softly. "Wherever you are, we are."
He bites his lip and hesitates, not wanting to disappoint them.
“How about this?” He smirks and makes his hips to rub his prostate.
He smiles and kisses him back.
Turk looks up at Sky. “Yes, that’s right.”
She leans in and kisses him hard as she moves a bit faster. "Tell me how long you've wanted this. How long you've wanted to get me pregnant." She nips at his lips.
“So good baby. Feels so good.” She moans, close to coming already.
He blushes and smiles shyly as he watches her.
"I can try. I want to try."
Sherlock sits on his bed as he finishes the half empty bag of blood. He puts the bag in his hidden bin and wipes his lips before going into the living room. He sits in his chair and watches John for a moment.
Lydia nods. “Maggie is smart. She can help. And if she can’t then she’ll know someone who can. It’ll be okay.” She smiles.
He shrugs and pulls John closer.
“I love you, too..” He nuzzles him.
Cecil adds a second finger into him.
Michael closes his eyes, trying to relax.
John nods. “Whatever I can do to be of service, Ma’am. Just let me know.”
Sky hums softly. ‘What do you think?’ She asks dark and Darius.
"Mm hello there.." He smirks and holds his thighs.
She giggles and nuzzles him. "Don't wanna keep them waiting." She takes his hand.
Edgar smiles softly and holds him. “Is that your Daddy?” He asks softly.
She pants and whines softly.
He blushes and bites his lip. "Want you to fuck me.."
He rubs his back and cuddles him.
"I'll stay here, if you don't mind... butcher shops and associated smells don't agree with me..."
“Loral, you said we can help Sherlock have more babies yeah?” Kia grins and climbs into Loral’s lap.
He frowns and fucks her harder, biting her neck.
"Mm if you insist." He smirks.
"What we always do. Keep fighting."
He moans and nods as he starts to ride him. “Yes, Daddy.. fills me nicely.”
'Believe it, baby.' She smile and kisses him.
"Such a good girl for Daddy.."
Sky starts the car as the rest of them get into the back seat. She turns on the radio as she pulls away into the street. "Someone found a letter you wrote me
John chuckles slightly. "Your breathing catches just so when ever I say it. It's like you're surprised each time." He smiles.
He nuzzles him.
He blushes as he leaves the room.
"Need anything taken care of right now? You know how your beautiful husband and his big cock love to spoil you." He smirks.
He smiles brightly back at her.
“Like I said 95% of the vampires he’s met have tried to kill him.” John says softly. “I would think the same if that happened to me.”
She smiles and they’re driven to the estate. “Need to pick anything up before go to the estate?”
"Take out Daddy's cock and get on it then." He smirks.
“I know.” Cecil sighs. “Your mother has been locked away talking to sky for the past hour. I don’t know about what.”
"Clara and Amy.. I love it." She grins.
"Mm, okay."
“They will. They can’t get rid of me that easy.” Margaret giggles. “They can If they want to.”
"I really like spending time with you.."
Magdala rolls her eyes. “This prideful shit is hurting your kids.”
"Yes, Sir." She purrs and sinks down onto his cock.
He slowly sinks into him, letting his adjust.
He groans and rocks into him.
Jean gasps and mewls.
"Mycroft has my best interests at heart." Sherlock said quietly.
The cat eats eagerly and quickly.
He smirks as they make their way to Lydia.
"God, I wish I could get you pregnant.."
John moans and comes hard suddenly down Sherlock's throat.
"Do you want me to plug you?" He nuzzles him and rubs his back.
“Yeah that sounds good. I don’t have any supplies though. Mycroft’s guards took everything off me when I came in.” John hums, still inspecting Sherlock’s hands.
"I figured as much.. It's okay. You let me know even though you forgot."
He smiles and blushes a bit.
"Puppies. They're out in the stables with their mother's. There this one pup that keeps escaping and coming in to explore the house. I catch him out of the corner of my eye sometimes. It's like he's playing hide and seek." George says as he leaves the sitting room not noticing the puppy curled up happily with Sherlock.
“Oh okay.” John smiles. “I guess that’s good then.” He says softly.
He walks him back and presses him against a wall gently as he kisses him deeply.
He kisses his head and smiles.
She cuddles into him. "Mm we're going to be parents." She mumbles into his chest.
“I just.. He was the first human that I actually could stand after.. After..” Sherlock frowns.
He cuddles him and nuzzles him.
"It is someone I have encountered before."
“Neither did I.” She smirks up at him as they stop at the cell.
“Hardly. You’re the one that pushed out a new being.” Irene smiles, looking at Selene.
He frowns. “Sky?”
‘There’s a good girl.’
“Mm yes. You’re perfect.”
He holds her carefully.
He smiles and kisses his hand.
"Yes, Gregory..." He murmured.
He shifts so his arse is facing the camera, looking back at the camera.
He whimpers as he stretches himself. "Jake.."
“Higher.” Greg laughs. “Maybe around 60 each. So 120 in total. Poor babies. They won’t know what’s hit them.”
He smiles and goes to change them.
Mycroft mewls softly.
"Tingley." Mycroft smiles slightly. "Feels... Nice."
Mycroft carries Kia over to them.
"Christ.."
"I left him in a whimpering heap on the floor. Felt good. I don't think I broke anything other than his pride."
"You're so perfect. So perfect." He nips at her neck as he thrusts.
He smiles happily.
"Are you okay? You seem a bit on edge today."
"I don't feel free." She says, softly. "I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop." She took a deep breath and finally nodded. "I'll stay with you. Lord knows if I spend any more time in that house, I'll go barking mad."
He groans. "Christ, a bloody talented mouth. Such sinful things you used to say.."
“Run. Run while you still can.” Crystal says to Greg, voice rough and damaged sounding.
"Slut... Getting hard again."
He blushes brighter and smiles shyly.
Magdala frowns and follows John.
"Mm I think we have left overs from last night. Or do you want me to cook?"
'Mm, yeah. My hair's starting to go.'
"Good boy." John purrs. "Then, get up and go to the bedroom." He licked his lips.
“Whatever Jim did to them was very hard to remove. Some of them snapped, reverting back to what Jim had taught them.” He frowns, his entire body language changing. “What facility did your friend go to first?”
She moans and whimpers, starting to feel the pressure build. ‘Brian. Come here. Help me.’ She whimpers in his head, showing him a mental image of what’s happening.
She blushes and whimpers, rocking with them.
Magdala holds John tightly. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, my brave boy.” Magdala whispers. “I read in your blog that you injured your leg?” She asks softly.
'Oi, be more careful, yeah? Can't have you dying before I do.'
“We’re going to go get her back. I promise.” Sherlock says and takes the table from Anthea, looking at the video. “Let’s go.” He grabs John’s hand and drags him out the door to his car.
She holds him close as they fall asleep.
He starts to thrust harder.
Mycroft flicks a ball of lint from his trousers then looks up. "I'm not against some level of imprisonment, even if it is simply house arrest with an Omega tracking monitor attached to him. I
Greg nods. “I don’t think Sherlock is going to be happy either way.”
He blushes and smiles. "Hi.."
He smiles against him and kisses his chest again.
He hums and smiles, nodding.
He frowns a bit. 'Sky..'
Mycroft stands and offers his arms down to Sherlock. “How does it feel? Being pregnant?” He asks.
Margaret blushes a bit and nods. “I just want them to be happy.”
Mycroft rubs his back a bit.
“Smells great.” Greg smiles and sips his wine.
Sherlock blushes and whimpers as he rocks with him.
John is looking up at Sherlock, not sure how to respond because he's just as shocked Sherlock wants them to come back.
He rubs his back, wanting him to relax until it was time. "Good boy.."
“Mm old enough to know that wearing undergarments under a dress like this just isn’t done.” Crystal smirks.
“John! Sherlock! Thank goodness you two volunteered or else we would have had to call the whole trip off.” Gina smiles at them.
She holds his hair and mewls.
He laughs and gets up head to take a shower. "Still got it!" He winks and goes to the bathroom.
'I.. We've all been talking about if we want to start a family and you're a part of this now, so, I wanted to know where you stood with this.'
“John’s got a ring. He’s protected by it. It’s an extension of me. I anything happens to him they’ll have to deal with me.” Sherlock nods.
"Always.." He smiles and presses a kiss to his head. "You were so good today."
Mycroft looks so forlorn, but he presses closer to Greg. "Bastards." He muttered. "People can be utter bastards." He rested his forehead on Greg's shoulder.
Jean hums and smiles softly at them.
“I need to do some more research first to figure out exactly how to help you best. For now relax.” Crystal smiles down at him softly.
She purrs and cuddles into him as they lay down. 'Mm I think I figured out how we can tell the others I'm pregnant.'
He curls up against him, starting to drift off. "Mm, I like you.." He mumbles softly.
He presses a kiss to her head. "It would be better to have them following you than someone else. You can use them against Sebastian."
Cecil picks him up and presses him back against the wall, snapping his hips into him.
He whimpers. “Daddy, Mikey.. please. Need your cum. Push into my cunt and breed me.”
“Oh..” John nods, blushing more. “If I was talking about fantasies then that means I haven’t done anything with him.. Cause if I did it wouldn’t be a fantasy anymore. And there’s only one man I ever wanted outside of the army that I never did anything with.” He looks up at Sherlock, glancing from his eyes to his lips and back.
He puts his finger to his own lips, reminding Michael to be quiet.
"Clever girl." John muses as he looks up at the menu to decide what he wants to get. He rocks on his heels for a moment before finally deciding on a latte, a sticky bun and a black coffee for Gina. Then he waits for Sherlock to add to the order before paying.
He nuzzles him back.
"So then you must be Jean and Jake."
He smiles and holds his hand.
He chuckles breathily and kisses her neck. "Mm, yeah.."
“Humm.” Greg mumbles as he tries to sort out the paperwork on his desk. “None of them can do paperwork in this whole bloody office. I can’t even read this one it’s like child scribbles. A holiday doesn’t sound like such a bad idea.” Greg keeps mumbling to himself as he rewrites the reports.
He whimpers and presses against him.
He gasps softly, starting to get hard.
“That would work. After lectures get out?” Sherlock asks.
He smiles shyly. “Yeah. Very.” He nuzzles against him.
“Please..” He whimpers, rocking up against her.
He stays curled up against him, closing his eyes.
He hums as he falls asleep
He smiles and nuzzles him as they pull up home.
“Oh umm yes. I suppose.” Sherlock nods.
She blushes more as she presses closer into his hands.
“Mm want my tight little cunt again?” She purrs, rocking against him slowly.
She hums happily and smiles.
He helps her into position.
“It’s fine ma’am, I understand.” Sherlock replies, under his breath.
Collin wraps his arm around Greg and hums as John relaxes next to Greg.
He moans needy, rocking into his hand.
He frowns a bit. "I don't mean to. I want him to be able to be with others too, I just.."
"Mmhmm."
Sherlock reaches down for him, pulling him into a deep kiss.
“Hungry, hungry!”
“Poor thing. Nobody using your needy little cunt?” Tobias smirks as he watches Sherlock drip.
"He's a bit shaken up from today." He hesitates. "He said the man begged him to kill him."
"You're perfect."
Sherlock soon falls asleep
"Yeah of course." Benny moves back and Jean pulls out of him, laying him down.
He frowns and leans against him.
He gags and lurches forward, throwing up a bit around his cock. His own cock bobs heavily with each spank from Eric.
“Mm. Nap I think.”
Sherlock nodded.
John nods. “I just want someone to look after me after I’ve changed. Make sure I’m doing well.” He explains.
“Probably. These two are progressing faster than I expected.” She nuzzles him.
"No," John says firmly, kissing Sherlock once more. "No."
"Mm I'll take pity on you since you've been such a horny good boy today. Do you want me to use my hand on your aching cock? Or do you want to rut against my leg like a bitch in heat?"
Sky bites her lip and takes off both of her gloves. She wipes away the last few tears on his cheeks with her bare hands. She rests her palms on his cheeks. She breathes slowly and transfers get calming affects to him. "This is what you are going to do. You are going to take a breath. You are going to clear you mind. You are going to think of exactly what you need because you know this isn't working. You are going to get better.." Her voice is hypnotic as their eyes are locked together.
Mycroft growls softly and marks him.
He moans and ruts against him.
He moans and nods. "Please. Make me come. Please."
"Please." Sabine smiled. She came over to Molly's bedside. "Hello, Molly."
He smiles. "Love Kai!"
John looks at them and smiles. "Fine. Seems like you two are doing well."
“Mm fine. I think I should fuck his tight little pussy first while he stretches his area for me.”
“Let’s go find you someone, Mm?” He smirks.
He sighs contently.
She smiles and leads them in. "Where is David?" She hums to herself looking for the tall man.
He shivers in his arms, nuzzling his chest as he drifts into subspace. "L-Love you.."
He groans and gasps. "Oh.. Yes, please.."
Camille asks Sherlock to nod and he does so. They follow Mycroft to the unused rooms. Camille tells Sherlock that he can speak, “Sire, it’s... er Sherlock. Please forgive me for not telling you sooner. I didn’t know until I handed you the ashes.” He whispers.
‘Yup. We’re all kind of in one huge relationship. I’m married to Turk. But everyone is together and we all sleep with each other. We like to share.’ She smiles softly. ‘You haven’t met the girls yet at the estate but they’re all pregnant. We love it. Whenever we want another baby there’s a line of cocks to pump one into us. Just like there’s a line of cocks to fuck and be fucked with. It’s really nice.’ She hums happily.
He holds her and falls asleep
Sherlock greedily drinks Morna’s milk. He pulls away after a while and wipes the milk from his lips. “John, I want something... kinkier. I want to be tied up, maybe stood up, so everyone can get to all sides of me. I want to feel completely fucked as well as used.”
Sherlock gasps and moans. "Oh, Daddy.." He whimpers softly. "Can I suck you off?"
Greg rubs his thumb over his knuckles and smiles. "Morning, My.."
He blushes and mewls a bit.
“Mm yeah. Just about.” She turns and kisses his cheek. “Thank you.”
He moans as he starts to take his fist deeper, now at his wrist.
She rides him harder and rubs her clit as she gets closer.
He hums softly and nods.
“Mm, alright. That shouldn’t be too bad.”
“Ever dutiful.” Sherlock snorts.
Sky moans loudly as he fills her, squirting as she comes from the pressure.
“A human?” Mycroft raises a brow as he looks at the card, frowning as he sits. “Better help? From who?” He frowns deeper.
“No reason. Just curious. Quite a bit has happened recently.”
Sherlock's eyes widen at the stretch and he moans loudly.
Matt shakes his head. ‘His body is trying to protect him. He doesn’t have any energy to spare.’ Sky frowns.
He smirks a bit. "Come on, then."
She kisses him back softly.
He smiles cheekily.
“Mm it’s alright if some leaks out. I’ll just fill you up again later.” He chuckles softly and kisses his cheek.
“You mean you’re magic?”
“No. It’s too dangerous.” Mycroft states, “it’s for the safety of our race. You said so yourself that you’ve not looked at it or done anything with it. You won’t miss the broach.”
“I came to see he. She was scared and angry.” Magdala points to a bottle sized hole in the wall next to the door. “She threw a whiskey bottle at me and hyperventilated for a good twenty minutes. Then we talked. All night. I explained everything. She’s still angry at me but she knows now why I did what I did. She actually made me take her. She was sick of drinking and it was making her sick.” She pulls a bottle from between the couch cushions. “She was self medicating. See?” She holds up the vodka bottle, there were tiny particles floating around in it.
George moans as he looks at Cecil before pulling him into a kiss. "I need you."
John growls and fucks Sherlock harder. Sherlock cries out and moans as he bounces on John's cock.
"Yeah?" He blushes and smiles shyly.
"T-thank you, Sir." He whimpers.
John frowns and looks down. “Mm probably should have bandaged my hand but I was exhausted.” He hums and kisses Sherlock before getting up to change.
“Fuck.” She moans, getting wet as she leaks into his mouth.
“Oh fuck.. so fucking good.”
"Sherlock." John moans and kisses him.
He smirks as he finishes his drink.
Chloe hums and goes to put on her makeup once she's dressed.
Mycroft blushes as Greg watches him, his hand moving to adjust himself.
He covers his mouth. "This is beautiful, Mrs. Brix.."
He frowns and kisses his head.
“You want to be like me?” Sherlock blushes brightly.
They press kisses to his skin.
Soon, they made the circuit. Juliette stood by the car, waiting patiently.
He pulls him closer and kisses him back.
“Oh. I didn’t know that.” Margaret nods.
Carol smirks and gets off him, laying in her back and spreading her legs for him. Collin chuckles and takes his fingers out, slicking his cock.
John nods. “One,” he says, poking Sherlock’s nose. “Two and three.” He adds, poking the left and right of Sherlock’s stomach. “You’re carrying twins.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “It was a long time ago. It’s fine.”
“I’m sure she will.” Samuel smiles and rubs her back.
He groans, his hole relaxing around Mycroft’s tongue.
She whimpers each time his balls slap her clit, making her pussy throb around his cock. “I don’t want you to help it. I want you to fuck me however you want. As hard as you want. As long as you’re pumping your babies into me I don’t care.” She moans and pushes back for more, feeling his cock push deeper into her. “How many babies are you going to give me this time? How many are you going to make me swell with?”
Greg leans against John and Mycroft cards his fingers through Sherlock's hair adoringly.
"Mm unfortunately." Collin smirks and puts on pant after giving them a nice view of his arse as he bends to pick up his pants.
John blinks as he stumbles over his words, "oh...uh, yeah. Of course." It's clear from his surprise that he thought Sherlock was making a joke about fixing the sink earlier.
John stands up on the pedestal and let’s the tailor work, his eyes on Sherlock through the mirror.
"Are you going to race again?"
He hums. "Thank you."
Benny lays him in bed and holds him close.
"Yes, sir. She was just where you said she'd be. Running with the man in the park. Neither of them seemed to notice me, sir."
Sherlock kisses his head and holds him.
"Mm.."
Sherlock groans into John's mouth, hand tightening around himself. Leaning back, he pants. "Fuck me..." He groans deeply, still pulling at himself.
Greg kisses his jaw and holds him. "Mm good for you, Sir."
"Mm yes I think that's a very good idea. What do you think Maximus?" Greg smiles as Maximus yips happily and wags his tail. "I think that's a yes." Greg chuckles.
Greg nods and gets them in the pan.
He nods and smiles softly, letting Benny lead him out.
"Where do you think I learned it from, brother mine?" He nips at his lips and moves his head so Mycroft pulls his hair.
He smiles and kisses him back.
He moans breathily as Benny fills him.
She cries out and moans, her cunt throbbing already. “Want you cum. Your children. Want you to own me.”
He stalks to the bedroom in a huff, feeling too wound up to relax.
"Can I suck your cock?"
Morna moans, relaxing her jaw and throat.
Greg slowly deepens the kiss, pinning John’s wrists above his head.
He hisses a bit as his hip bruises press against him but not caring as he slides his tongue into his mouth.
Dominic nods. “Is there anything else I can do for you? Get for you? Anything to make you more comfortable?”
"Oh Michael.." She holds onto him and kisses him deeply.
"Mycroft.." He growls softly and pushes into him.
He smiles brightly.
“You’re the one who just had me fuck him over the hood of his expensive car.” He teases. “You like it when I’m naughty.”
The man starts to panic a bit, looking over John before starting to gather his things. “Right. This doesn’t need to be a big deal.”
"Mmm, I was allowed free reign of pretty much this whole town, until I presented." John sighs. Sherlock's scents help override the dull chemical scent used to deodorize the rooms between guests. The air purifier in the corner hums, which reminds him of something he'd been meaning to bring up.
John hums and looks out the wonder. He knows he should be nervous about going to a club full of vampires but really it just sends an adrenaline thrill through him. He mentally makes a shopping list in his head, knowing Sherlock doesn’t eat but that doesn’t mean he’ll stop buying his favorites.
His frown deepens. He wants to ask but he knows they don’t have time. ‘You’re gonna come back to us safe.’
"Sherlock." John's worried. Sherlock seems very aloof about the whole day.
John settles down and relaxes against Sherlock.
Mycroft moans in relief and tries thrusting his hips, trying to get friction on his aching cock. “T- thank you.” He moans.
“Mm I can tell that you taste different than before.” Sherlock kisses along his jaw.
John sips his tea, quiet for a while. “Is there anything you think I should ask?”
"Mm you like that do you?" Collin smirks and spanks him again.
He smirks and spanks her again, watching how much she drips.
“A steal really.” He smirks, already signing the check. Sky blushes brightly and licks her lips.
The moment their bonds are complete the three of them let out a collective gasp. Harry releases Mycroft's neck and falls onto her side, shuddering and shaking from the bond.
“Okay.” She blushes and nods.
Magdala kisses Crystal hard, not stopping as Crystal’s fangs nip at her lip and cut into it, making her bleed. She moans and continues to Crystal, just as passionately.
He smiles and hums softly.
John laughs and follows him out. He thanks the tailor as Sherlock drags him out of the shop and into a cab.
The others had gone back to the kitchen after watching the first round.
He frowns a bit. "From the bedroom?"
Ooh in the name of love."
"Mm I have the sudden urge to tie you down and fuck you silly." She nibbles as his throat.
"Mm who knew.." He hums softly and tilts his head up to kiss Mycroft.
He blushes and nods. “Yes, sir.”
He smiles softly and stretches a bit.
“Mm better than I imagined.”
"Such a good boy.."
“Want someone else?”
"Such a pretty slut.."
Mycroft smiles and walks with him back down to the bar.
"Remember who owns the gun in this relationship, Sherlock," John warns gently. "I'm in no mood to have doctors shove their equipment up my arse just because I'm an Omega. I'm going back downstairs. We still have a lot of work to do."
He giggles and kisses him back.
“Now I’m going to kiss you.” John kisses him. “And then I’m going to get the lube.” He kisses him again. “Then we’ll see if you can handle my fingers inside you.”
Sherlock frowns as Mycroft walks away. He likes being close to Mycroft, he feels safe. “Sire, please. I... I want to talk to you. But I don’t want you to think me insane.” Sherlock says softly as he stays where he is.
“I’m just glad we can move past this.” Greg smiles.
Michael blushes a bit as he looks up at him.
Sally moans and arches, really wanting Greg to come in her. “Mm I’ll let you pump me full of cum. Can’t wait.”
“Good boy. Fill Mummy up with your cum.”
She submits to him as they pull up to the estate.
He smiles and nuzzles against him. “It’s all brilliant..”
"This way." The tailor led John to the changing room.
Sherlock giggles as he sees John and Udos before taking a bite from the offer half.
He blushes and lets out a small gasp.
“Please.” Sherlock smiles and nods.
"You could have mentioned this earlier," John hissed though his words got caught in his throat when Sherlock whispered the monthly rent.
He smiles happily. "That you are, love."
John smiles softly and nods. "Okay." Jason smiles.
“Myc?” Greg stands, taking his hand.
He hums softly, rubbing his back.
Mycroft moans and pushes his ass back into John's hands as he continues thrusting into Greg.
Sherlock whines softly and nods. “A girl.”
**I just pulled three marbles out of this kids nose.--JW** John texts Sherlock.
She hums softly and kisses him back, wrapping her arms around his neck.
He breathes hard and leans back against the door. "Fuck you're perfect."
"I love you."
He smiles happily and holds her up as he kisses her back.
He relaxes into him.
He blushes and whimpers softly. “Always needy..”
Sherlock thinks, his brow pinching a bit. “I don’t think it was sudden. I think it was a slow progression but the moment you limped into my life it was never the same. That’s when it started.”
She smiles and follows him up to the shower.
He smiles and kisses his forehead.
“I love you, Daddy. Love that you let me give you babies.” She mumbles.
Mycroft smiles and offers his hand. "May I have this dance?"
“Feels so good.” He moans, holding him close as he fucks him.
He strips down and hums, turning on the shower.
He blushes and smiles, nodding.
“Considering your brother just saved my life I think it’s a valid trade-off,” Sherlock says, eating slowly so he doesn’t make himself sick.
“Want to take all of you. Want you deep inside me. All the way.” He whimpers, throbbing around him.
John bites his lip and smirks a bit. "Mm. You offering?"
“She’s like a mother to me, but I don’t know if I’m like a son to her, ma’am.” Sherlock whispers as he drinks the glass of blood quickly. “I just... I don’t know what to do. I love John but every time we argue he just walks away and let’s time heal wounds. He doesn’t have time.” Sherlock whispers.
"Okay." She hums and nuzzles into him.
"Mm exactly.." She hums. "I remember. I couldn't see you that well because of my black eye but I remember how much I wanted to run my fingers through your sandy blond hair." Greg laughs.
They smirk and agree.
Turk moans loudly as he feels their cum flooding her, soon coming into her.
He blushes and whimpers softly.
He smirks. "Mm, I'm afraid not. I already told Michael that he has to wait."
"Mm not forever then.. Maybe just this week.." He hums.
“Wherever you’d like.”
John and Brian deliver the twins.
“Feeling better?” Eli smiles softly.
He blushes and arches wiggling out of his trousers.
“Mm so structured.” Crystal giggles.
He moans and presses his face deeper, getting harder just feeling him come against his face.
“After you left we went for a run. We forgot our phones. And Sky was busy so she wasn’t focusing.”
“Brandon came down and tried to get Dad off Mum. Dad started choking Brandon. Millie grabbed the gun and fired. She was only ten. She was trying to protect us. The bullet hit Mum. She was dead before she hit the floor. Dad let Brandon go and went after Millie but she fired again and shot dad. She didn’t mean to do it. She was just trying to protect us.” Caroline sniffles. “She was our little sister and we couldn’t do anything but she saved us.”
He hums and follows him.
“Mm maybe we should stay inside her and make sure the other boys fuck her right.” George smirks and Sky blushes brightly.
"Christ, Sky is lucky. Having a cock like this. Fuck."
She moans and arches as she’s filled.
"He's out in the courtyard... seems to be trying to self combust, if the cigarette butts are anything to go by."
"Yes.. I need it.." He palms himself through his trousers.
Sherlock nodded.
She moans softly and kisses him back deeply, pressing close to him.
“Fine.” Molly turns and goes inside 221B, done with him.
He blushes and mumbles against his chest.
Soft little footsteps come up the hallway. “Who are you?” A little voice asks, belonging to the ghost of a small child.
He smiles and kisses him again.
Zack blushes and smiles, a bit distracted from the game.
“What? What is it?” Sherlock says in the background, coming into the living room from his microscope in the kitchen.
“Why not.” Chloe smirks.
"Mm then lets go tell ours and then go talk to John and them." She nuzzles him.
"I'm sure he'd enjoy that." Mycroft smiles.
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
“Mm. Come for me and we can get started.” He smirks, continuing his thrusts.
Sherlock nodded. "You're my bossy omega and I like it that way."
She collapses next to him, breathing hard
“Is there something I can help with?” She frowns.
He kisses his pout and smiles.
Sherlock nods. “I just don’t want her to take it negatively, that’s all. She may think that you think you’re better than her.”
Sherlock blushes at the praise and smiles a bit.
He whimpers and moans loudly, wanting the others’ attention as well but not knowing Greg wasn’t there.
“And you’re not going to?” Sherlock asks softly. “She is your child.”
“Such a good girl, baby..”
“There used to be a lot of us. People like me. I’m the last.”
Greg smirks as he starts pleasuring Maggie with the dildo.
John moans as his air is cut off, his cock leaking.
“Relaxing by the pool.”
Sherlock smiles and hums. "Mm.."
He holds onto her, pulling her close. 'I'd be willing to do anything for you.'
Sherlock wraps his arm around Magdala. “You raised him well. He’s so brave and clever.” He mutters.
“Oh I’m sorry. I don’t mean to probe. I’m really sorry.” She squeezes his hand gently.
John smiles. “Do you want to ride me?” He asks, “I can take care of you properly now.”
Mycroft realizes he's now trapped between the two men.
"Well we'll get the cancer cleared out so you can have that." She nods.
He swirls his tongue around the tip and sucks him down with one swift move.
“No. I stayed in the cellar alone.” Diōnē sighs.
Anthea holds up a £50 note to Mycroft, having lost their bet. “Don’t be a sore winner, Sir.” She laughs.
He drags his nails over his stomach and up to his chest.
Anthea shrugs.
Sherlock watches Greg, biting his lip.
She cries out and arches as Sky hits her g-spot. "Sky! Fuck!"
Michael hums softly.
He leans in and kisses him as he rides him.
"And which one are we starting with?" Sherlock smirks.
“Oh alright.” Sherlock kisses him before picking out an outfit for him to wear. Tight jeans and a low v neck shirt.
Sherlock blushes brighter and nods. “Yes. I’d like that. But... won’t everyone else stare?” He asks.
He moans loudly and comes hard, filling her with come.
He hums softly and relaxes with him.
He holds him and kisses his cheek softly. "Sleep.." He mutters against him.
He frowns and glares at the phone as he takes a sip of his scotch.
"Don't you two look cozy." Turk chuckles softly and smiles.
George follows him out. “Where are we going?”
He nods slowly, bringing his hands up to his head to check for bleeding.
“Go find someone to fill you, baby.” He slaps his arse again.
Sky nods. “So what would you like to know?”
John frowns, “Locky fun.” He says emphasising the last word. “Maggie fun.” He shifts in Sherlock’s lap until Sherlock’s cock is inside him. He moans loudly and giggles.
John whimpers and pulls against his restraints. "Again.."
(See the end of the chapter for
He hums softly and holds him.
He moans and leans down to kiss her deeply.
*We’re working on it. Hopefully we can start to get back to normal soon. A better more communicative normal.-SH*
He moans loudly, grinding down against him.
She smiles softly. “I love you.”
He blushes and smiles. "Yes."
“Go the fuck away.” He snarls at his brother and the lackey who’s accompanied him.
“You’re kidding!”
"Sky.." He sighs heavily and crouches down to her level.
Sherlock tenses as John holds his waist, waiting for him to wake up, because of how cold he is.
"Not really." Molly admitted. "But I suppose I should eat. Toast with butter will be fine..." She smiled softly. "Mmm... how did I get so lucky to find you?"
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
And walked for a mile or so
Sherlock burrows his way further into the blanket and into Greg's arms.
“I know.” Pythia smiles and nods. “Just don’t burn my eyebrows off this time?”
John smirks. He kisses him and bites his lip when he pulls away sure that Sherlock is breathless when he's done.
He moans and obeys Mycroft immediately.
She nods, licking them gently. ‘They’re so little.’
“Sorry I uh… fell asleep. You were…” John blushes and clears his throat. “Sorry,” he settles on, as he moves away from Sherlock to get off the bed.
Sherlock blushes and thinks about mentioning a certain kink to John but decides to hold off.
"Wherever you want to put them." Violet purrs.
“Mm?” Violet smirks, working his cock over with her dripping wet cunt.
"I've been thinking about you the whole time I've been in here. I couldn't help touching myself. Fucking myself on my fingers as I thought about your cock." He purrs, moaning like a slut as he feels George's cock slide between his arde cheeks as he rolls his hips slowly.
"Just fine. I don't need any personal space." She says sarcastically. "Good to know." Turk hums as he washes his hands.
He leans against him.
“I.. I’ve never had anyone in my arse before.” She blushes brightly.
“Yes please.” She smiles brightly.
He whimpers and moans softly, loving being told he can't come.
He kisses him softly.
Sky presses her face to his shoulder and moans breathily, riding his cock and fingers.
"Yes! Please! I need it! Use me! I'm your cockslut!" He cries out and begs.
"Why didn't he just kill me? The gunman during the race. He had the opportunity. Why did he give it up?" John frowns a bit as he looks into his glass.
He mumbles and hides his face, blushing.
“Good, Daddy.”
Sherlock cries out as he comes into his hand.
"I love you, too.."
Sky moans loudly around him and looks up at him, loving it.
She blushes and smiles shyly.
Greg groans, loving being made a mess.
"Sherlock?" John goes to him and holds his hand.
"I do like to give you what you want."
"You're so cute.."
“Mm, we’ve had him for a while now, always been a desperate slut, just had to break him in a bit.”
He blushes and nods.
He wraps his arm around him and holds him close as he kisses him back.
“Yes. Completely surprised. Good job.” He grins and nuzzles him.
Sky blushes a bit but stay exactly where she is in her lace bra and thong.
Mycroft licks his lips, slowly stroking Sherlock’s cock. “Mm. Let’s go find Mummy, then.” He smirks, letting go of his cock and pulling out of him.
"Beg." He swirls his tongue around his clit, smirking as his legs shake.
But, please don't take my sunshine away
"I love you, too.."
He blushes. "Y-Yeah, it is."
John blinks a bit. “Mm? What?” He asks, having zoned out to the feeling of Sherlock’s thumb rubbing him. “Oh sure.” He nods, finally registering what Sherlock asked.
They’re led to a small office. The plaque on the door reads “Mr. Brooks”
“No no, darling. Come in. I’m just enjoying Mycroft’s amenities.” Crystal smiles, still spinning.
“I.. Yeah alright.” He sighs and sits in his chair. “I’ll write it down you just tell me.” He picks up his note pad and paper.
"And to think I almost didn't see John that day."
“Always.” She mewls.
She looks up at Mycroft with a slight glare. "Fi-" She croaks and rolls her eyes at the loss of her voice. "He's fine. He had panic attack and couldn't calm himself down so I had to sedate him.." She signs.
He blushes as he fixes his pants and trousers.
Mycroft nods and continues. "Their security footage captured a man messing about in the vault."
Collin smiles and they go downstairs to the kitchen.
He holds him close, rubbing his thighs.
“Mm still haven’t built up the courage to take off my top?” She smirks, tightening around him.
He moans as he starts to drink from her.
“Daddy!” He whines and arches, cock throbbing.
Greg strips himself and kisses Sherlock's collarbone over his shoulder and to his back. He holds Sherlock's hip in one hand and his throat in the other pulling Sherlock back flush against him. He kisses his neck with his hand on Sherlock's throat tilting his head back. "See John. This is what a very good boy looks like." Greg hums and praises Sherlock whole teaching John.
