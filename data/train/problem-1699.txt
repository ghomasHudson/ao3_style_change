John takes up the mirrored oil lamp and leads the way down the dark hall, glimmering golden light reflecting off the walls and shimmering in his grey blonde hair. Sherlock trails behind him, running his fingertips over the wallpaper, tracing the top rail of the wainscoting. The well-oiled wood is cool and smooth under his skin, the draught coming down the stairs from the skylight next to John’s bedroom makes him shiver.
They fell in step together behind her, and Sherlock allowed himself a quick squeeze of John’s forearm. John grinned in response, his eyes alight with the same kind of fervor that overtook Sherlock on cases. He loved this as much as Sherlock did.
“No. You didn’t.” John’s looking at him with that expression again, the one that hurts. The one that’s so affectionate and sad that it makes his stomach cramp. He doesn't want John to look at him like that right now. He wants John's eyes full of heat, their bodies pressed together to a thumping rhythm, he wants to lick the sweat off John's neck in the muggy darkness of a club, he wants John’s hands inside his shirt where everyone can see, he
Sherlock's face was relaxed, but his eyes shone fever bright. His entire body mottled purple with arousal, blood smeared on his legs and somehow across his stomach, his cock standing hard and flushed, a bead of milky precome at the slit. John fought back the urge to lick it off, wanting to consume every part of Sherlock he possibly could.
“More.” Sherlock looked into John’s eyes, tilted his head, and John automatically pulled on his chin. There was a beat of recognition in their gaze, and then they were kissing.
The sun is sinking down orange below the lip of the window when Sherlock rouses himself, rubbing his face against John's belly and grumbling. "Dinner?"
Fall term had continued the same as last year, until one night, John just blurted it out in the middle of Sherlock verbally eviscerating a particularly inept physics professor.
John dove forward, thrusting his tongue into Sherlock’s willing mouth, their teeth scraping together. John bit down on Sherlock’s tongue, the inside of his lips. Sherlock cried out softly, but didn’t pull away, instead pressed three fingernails into the bite mark he’d left on John the week before, sending pleasure pain signals spiraling through John’s nervous system. He moaned low into Sherlock’s mouth, pulled back, breathing hard.
There’s a sudden fluttering of eyelashes against John’s, and he opens his eyes as Sherlock’s head shifts to the side. The only things he can see are the soft wave of Sherlock’s curls against his temple, and the out of focus edge of his nose as Sherlock -
They lapsed into a comfortable silence, sipping their tea and rubbing their feet against each other gently. John felt pleasantly drowsy, his eyes heavy. He set his chin in his hand, wishing half heartedly that there was a fire going, and let his eyes close.
John wiped at his eyes and took a long deep drag from the cigarette. He was at the door. The diner was run down, almost looked vacant. Through grimy plexiglass, he could make out a few strays, choking down greasy eggs and rashers too thick to be chewed properly. He wrenched open the door, hit in the face with the sickly smell of maple syrup and burnt coffee.
"No. I want the pipe. Olfactory input is key in sexual encounters, and most especially for me because of my hypersensitivity, and
specifically. Not by name. He handed me a number to call, said if I was looking for a way out. Of whatever.”
“What?” Sherlock pulls back, blinking at John with wet dark eyes, his mouth kiss swollen and red at the edges.
John laughs, still looking absurdly happy, happier than Sherlock’s ever seen him. It’s a good look on him. Sherlock wants to see him this way much more often.
- condom." Sherlock goes to push John's hand away, but somehow ends up just gripping his forearm, feeling his muscles tensing as he circles his thumb up and over the head, traces his foreskin softly with his index finger. Sherlock feels himself tightening already, warmth spreadly sweetly through his lower belly and back, his thighs going rigid.
"We will be. Later. Let's pick out your professor's jacket. I was thinking corduroy. Red. You look good in red." Sherlock draped himself over John’s knees to retrieve the laptop from the floor, and John’s hand was immediately snaking under his shirt, crawling fingertips up his spine. A tingle radiated through his nerve endings wherever John’s fingers touched his bare skin, and he couldn’t hide the shiver.
to you in there?” John whispers, almost to himself. He rubs a hand over his face, tugs at the corners of his moustache.
“Sure thing.” Lester reminded him rather disturbingly of a dog, pleased to have followed its master’s orders. He just crouched on the edge of the chair next to John’s bed, smiling, eyes fixed on John intently.
They have so little time before the world intrudes. Without allowing himself to think about it too much, Sherlock nudges his nose against the swell of John’s bicep, resting bare on top of the sheets. The answering grumble is quickly followed by John’s arm bending up to curve around the side of Sherlock’s face, knuckles resting against his hair. Taking this as encouragement, Sherlock parts his lips just slightly, brushes them back and forth over warm skin.
you do.” Sherlock whispered, overcome as he sometimes got. The connection between them so profound, so visceral, Sherlock felt it as a physical presence. He could taste it, see it. It had colours. John’s love was midnight blue. Pumpkin orange. Moss green. It smelled like tea and copper and wood smoke.
John pants against Sherlock’s cheek, twisting his hand round and rubbing himself against Sherlock without shame. Sherlock tries to kiss John, wants their tongues twined together, their hot wet mouths gaping against each other, but he gets a mouthful of short blonde hairs instead, John’s whole body contracting as he leaks and leaks and
"John." Sherlock twists around, the scars on his back pulling and stretching. John can't take his eyes off them. Sherlock turns and gets up on his knees, faces John so he can't see the scarring anymore. "Listen to me. It's alright - "
John's breath quickened, his fingertips digging sweetly into Sherlock's thigh. "I'll make you eat haggis in some -
“John, that - that really hurt.” Sherlock stammers hesitantly. He lives in fear of setting off the volcano, of triggering whatever fury John has yet to unleash, and a thrill of regret quivers through him as soon as he’s spoken.
Sherlock laid his head on John's lap, a gesture that he'd thought about so many hundreds of times since they’d met, imagined the comfort of it. John's strong hands in his hair, the warmth if his belly as he breathed. Sure enough, there was John's hand coming to rest on the curve of his skull, brushing his hair back from his temple. It was like a dream.
“Sit anywhere ya like. What’s that accent? Where’re you from?” She waved at him to follow her, hips sashaying purposefully, and tossed him a flirtatious smile over her shoulder.
John sighed, let his head tilt back, and looked up at the ceiling. He licked his lips, teeth dragging across the bottom one, in such a familiar gesture that Sherlock’s stomach clenched with the emotion of just being able to watch John do that again. He wanted to reach out and touch his face, but he restrained. He needed to hear what John was about to say.
“What do you -” John chokes out, stunned and overwhelmed, his eyes stinging with unshed tears, throat so tight he can barely swallow.
“Shhhh, I know, I know,” John gives Sherlock a few light strokes, making sure his prick is well coated, and then runs his palm between his own legs, slicking himself,  “There. Now get that beautiful prick inside me.”
They share a package of orange and milk chocolate HobNobs and sip strong tea. John kisses Sherlock with chocolate on his mouth as the sun sets orange in a purple streaked sky.
They move in perfect sync, a shiver of breath over goosebumped flesh giving way to the gentle roll of hips, the rustle of flannel hitting the bare floor, the whisper of skin against skin. John turns them on their sides, Sherlock’s warm naked body cradled in his arms. He peppers Sherlock’s neck and shoulders with kisses as Sherlock undulates and whimpers, digs his fingers into the soft skin above John's hip and rocks gently against him. Sherlock smells like bourbon and peppermints, wool and cold air and vaguely of that diesel smell that lingers in tube stations.
"You're beautiful." He bursts out, unable to hold back any longer the words that have been living right behind his teeth all day. John flushes, his cheeks glowing crimson, and those unearthly long eyelashes flutter as he looks down.
to. And I just don't want to wait anymore. I'm so fucking tired of holding back from each other. I want to start right now, just make everything right between us."
“Inexcusable, Mrs Hudson, as usual. I believe I shan't pay my rent this month if you're going to be so lazy,” I teased, very nearly as pleased to see her as I was to see Watson.
“I don’t even want it. God, that tastes like fucking arse.” He motioned for the tea still sitting by the bed from earlier in the day, repeatedly running his tongue over his front teeth and making disgusted noises.
” John touches his knee gently, but Sherlock shakes him off without opening his eyes. John takes the call. “Mycroft. He’s thinking right now. Well, you can talk to me.”
.” Sherlock husks out with his teeth at John’s neck, and he stiffens, nails digging sharply into John’s skin. John feels the wet heat rushing into him and then out, trickling down the insides of his thighs as Sherlock pulls out and leans his weight against John’s back, gasping.
A whimpering cry shuddered out of him, his fingers digging into John's waist. He ground his hips forward, the hard length of him rubbing against John's stomach. "Yes, yes, please. Oh, god, John, fuck me, please."
There’s only one person who would be sending Sherlock a letter from the Ministry in the middle of the night. Sherlock slips his finger under the flap to break the wax seal and unrolls the parchment. Sure enough, his brother’s narrow scrawl, just one line of text.
Eventually they’d wandered down to the Strand, and headed further east, crossing the river at Waterloo Bridge. Tired and hungry, they’d sunk down into this dark nondescript pub, the tables smudged with fryer grease, the ceiling fans hung with long strands of dust and cobwebs. A table of straggly American tourists are gorging themselves on sausage and mash. A few drunks sitting at the bar are the only other patrons.
"You thought it would be simplified after we established that you were the dom and I the sub, did you not?" Sherlock resumed rubbing his fingers over John's back, the rhythm gentling and hypnotic.
Lester came to visit. John barely tolerated him, breathing hard through his nose and gnawing his lip. Sherlock herded him out after a half hour, watching out the window as he walked to his car and drove away.
Jim laughs and turns on his side, eyes sliding away from Sherlock and back to the television. "Tell John I said hello."
Sherlock withdraws the needle from his arm, rubs a thumb across the small bead of blood that appears, and licks it off. He tucks everything back inside the little bag he keeps it in, winds the belt up, and sets it all underneath a blanket with a milk crate on top. He looks up at John, his stomach lurching at the openness of his expression, the tension of his neck, his back rigid, trying so hard to be accepting of this. There’s an ache inside him, desperate to erase this pain for John.
John rocks up on his tiptoes to whisper something in the bartender’s ear, calf muscles tensing into perfect hearts as he stretches. His knees spread just the tiniest bit, tendons standing out, and Sherlock’s mouth floods with saliva. He swallows hard, trying to regain some of his normal control over his body. Everything in him is pulled to John in a way that feels inevitable.
“None of my business. Don't need details. Just glad you have someone to help you out.” Looking distinctly ruffled, the doctor started for the door.
John doesn’t relax, but he doesn’t say anything either, and that’s enough. Sherlock glances at him; he’s chewing his lip, shoulders tight. There’s so much more to him than Sherlock could have imagined. He’s not fucking angelic. He a fucking mystery. He’s a paradox.
The kiss goes on and on, lasts until their lips are wet and raw, until Sherlock’s dizzy from sitting up on his own this long and absolutely has to lie back against his pillows before he tips right out of the bed. John helps him, standing up and holding his elbow, easing him back. His eyes are sparkling like July sunshine, cheeks flushed, his lips kiss swollen and pink. He’s radiant.
“Thinking burns calories. You know that.” John hands Sherlock a napkin, takes a bite of his own sandwich. “You’ve been working so hard, love. You must have burned thousands of calories today alone.”
“I do, I do. Just not in my bedroom. In the shower.” Sherlock swings them round at the top of the steps and they stumble into John’s room. Sherlock closes the door with his foot and pushes John back onto the bed, which is in the corner against the wall, and John lands with so much force he bounces a little and knocks his head against the wall. Sherlock climbs on top of him, breathless. ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry, are you alright?”
“Hit my head on the sink.” John allows his eyes to drift closed as he drags his mouth up over the hinge of Sherlock’s jaw, and behind it, where the skin is softer, pliable enough to pull just a little between his teeth...Sherlock makes a sharp mewling noise that ends in a gasp and John shivers, already feeling the heady rush of desire buzzing down his spine, making his scalp and the nape of his neck tingle.
"If you must know, I'm cataloguing your laughter." Sherlock was going for haughty, but it definitely came out as awkward and slightly embarrassed instead.
Since the texts had begun, though, there was a nagging doubt. John hadn’t been able to take Sherlock’s pulse for more than a few seconds before he was ripped unceremoniously away from him. He hadn’t actually seen his body afterwards. Mycroft insisted it would be too traumatic, and John had argued he was in the army, he’d seen damage to the human body that Mycroft wouldn’t begin to envision. Mycroft insisted this was different, because it was Sherlock, because of what they were to each other.
They belong to him, in a way that the rest of his life never has. Everything before controlled, directed by his parents, by Mycroft, by his brain and his talent. Nothing ever his choice. Until he left. Only then had he claimed some portion of  his own identity, been allowed to not be clever or brilliant or talented. Been allowed to just be, without demands being placed upon him.
He can tell the thread count of the sheets from how smooth they are against his back (M&S Egyptian cotton 230 count), predict when next the furnace is going to come on from the pops and squeaks of the radiator (thirteen minutes, give or take a few seconds), the make and model of the car currently rumbling past Baker Street (2012 Ford C-max, needs tires). The entire world is laid starkly bare to him, like it used to be, the first time they were together, before everything fell to pieces.
Sherlock's mouth had gone dry. He swallowed and tried to talk past the desire rising in his chest. "Y-yes. More than ever now, I think."
Sherlock says nothing, but squirms on the sheets, twisting them enough that one corner pops free of the mattress. His hair is wild around his face, a sweaty halo. "My fallen angel," John hums, almost to himself, sliding his hand up the insides of Sherlock's thighs and pinching the tender skin hard enough to make Sherlock cry out.
“Thank you.” John’s wine glass is empty. He’s feeling more than a little relaxed, and more comfortable with himself than he has, maybe ever. “This is good for us, you know. The dom/sub stuff. It just suits who we are. I
The old woman is already in the ambulance. “My grandson’s in a bit of a bad way, you know. Come on then,
"Mmmm. Tempting..." Sherlock slips a hand behind him, where John's now half on top of him, insinuating a knee between his thighs, and wraps his fingers around John's hip. "But I really do want to read this chapter at least."
He’s wearing a black leather coat that fits as though it was tailored just for him, and a purple turtleneck that would be garish on anyone else but looks posh as hell on Sherlock. Those languid curls John loves are mashed under a grey knit hat pulled down over his ears, glittering with quickly melting snowflakes. Sherlock pulls out the chair opposite John and sinks into it, folding his long legs elegantly under the small table.
"Oh, do I need to speak more slowly so you can understand?" Lip curling in a sneer, Sherlock leans in close to John's face until they're nearly nose to nose. "I said. Don't. Fucking. Talk. To. Me. Like. I'm. A. Child."
Sherlock could hardly breathe, John’s body so tight and flush with his own, their chests slipping sweaty against each other as John thrust into him just this side of rough. He said in a desperate sort of hush, “In Gaelic. Like you did before.”
He dug his teeth into his lip, fighting with himself. He hadn’t even meant to bring the fucking thing to this country, but now, with it here… He crossed the room in two strides and pulled it out of the trouser pocket, fastened it around his wrist. He’d never done that before, put it on.
. He’d stopped trying to date, because it had simply become farcical. There had been no room in his life for anyone but Sherlock, no room in his heart. He could still remember the peace that had settled over him that first morning after he’d decided, decided this would be enough. He had looked at Sherlock over the steaming mugs of coffee between them, knowing without a doubt that he could spend his life doing this every day and be happy. He could actually feel the love in his own eyes, and Sherlock had glanced up, looking confused.
Tears are dripping off John's chin, soaking the collar of his shirt. He's never felt so alone since he stood at Sherlock's grave all those years ago. He can't think of anything to say. "Should I make dinner?"
“Not liable to lose my shit and shoot you?” John laughs again, only half joking. He tucks the sig quickly at the small of his back and drags his cardigan down to cover it.
“This is not a discussion.” John strides over to him and takes Sherlock’s chin in his hand, forces him to look down at him. “This is not good for you, and I am taking you home. We’ll deal with the case tomorrow.”
"No." He answers far too quickly, sounds snappish again. He can feel his jaw working, stomach roiling. "Shit. I'm sorry. It's just. This isn't easy for me."
They sat cross legged, nude, facing each other on the bed. Their knees touching. John still half hard just from the constant pressure from the anal plug. Sherlock was soft, which John actually liked very much. He had a particular affection for touching Sherlock while he was soft, tugging gently at his foreskin, running his calloused fingertips over the velvety surface. He would do it in bed sometimes, reaching over Sherlock’s hip and slipping a hand into his loose pyjama bottoms, drowsily playing with him until they both fell asleep.
Sherlock's smoking a cigarette when John emerges. One foot braced against the brick, his coat drawn closed against the cold, hair whipping in little tangled tufts in the wind. He's peering down at his phone, thumb flying over the keys, smoke billowing out of his nose. Fuck, he is absolutely gorgeous. Singular. Wholly and incomparably unique.  Truly no one else like him in the entire world.
He pulled over, an ache blossoming through his chest, ran the car half up on a snow bank and yanked it into park. He lit a cigarette and texted back with just one thumb as he pulled hard on the filter. He felt like he was made of ashes, dissolving under his skin.
The emphasis on the last three words isn’t lost on John. He unscrews the lid of the carafe, pours, and stirs sugar into Sherlock’s cup, allowing his mind to drift back to that first night. The first - but not by far the last - time he was knocked nearly flat by the intensity of Sherlock’s changeable green eyes staring into his own. He can still recall with clarity the shimmering exhilaration of that night - the way it was as if suddenly the world had opened to him in a way it never could have without Sherlock Holmes at his side. The sky had seemed to grow until the movement of the stars had made him dizzy, the cobblestones in the narrow streets of Covent Garden had a lustre he’d never noticed, the white tile in the tube station at Baker Street had gleamed and shone like a wall of diamonds. John had never felt wonder like that before Sherlock. Life had been mostly a laundry list of have-to’s, and he’d drudged through, making the best of it. Sherlock had brought a magic into his life - into his soul - that had burrowed down and taken root and forever changed how he saw the world.
John had split open one of the wounds from the night before. Blood was seeping into the sleeve of his jumper. “You got any gauze?”
A pencil thin woman with a messy blonde ponytail approached him, cradling sticky menus in her arms. “Hey, sugar. Table for one?”
The door swung open and there he was - curls wild against the cold glass and metal of the walls, those lips just barely parted, a look of surprise and fascination in those changeable eyes He looked so. Untamed. A wild thing.
Sherlock blinks away the wetness shining in his eyes and inclines his neck down to put their mouths together. The kiss is deep and slow, Sherlock’s tongue curling gently into John’s mouth as his wet hair drips cold down his bare back. It feels new. A whole world opening to them; a world wholly lacking in gunshots and morgues, but filled with sleepy Sunday afternoons in front of the fire, and Tuesday mornings in Trafalgar Square, takeaway coffees and holding hands walking down The Strand, the sun glinting off the river in the distance.
He shook his head and leaned down, his mustache tickling against my forehead as he dropped tiny kisses along my brow. “Shush. Sleep, Holmes. I will be here when you awake.”
There’s a plastic straw pressed against his lips, and he opens up pliantly, drawing a cool refreshing flood of soda over his tongue. It tastes heavenly - sweet and peppery and calming - and he drinks and drinks, head resting back against the lumpy hospital pillows, until Sherlock tugs the straw gently away.
He retrieves the pillows from where they fell to the floor and puts them back on the bed as he slips under the sheets. They’re sticky and damp, but his body is suddenly leaden and exhausted and he can’t find it in himself to care. Sherlock rolls toward him until they’re nose to nose. John finds his hands under the sheets and twines their fingers together. They kiss sleepily for a few minutes, until Sherlock wriggles down and burrows into John’s chest.
He's already drowning in this moment, awash in sensation. He couldn't think right now if his life depended on it, couldn't deduce the most simplistic problem. Every neuron in his brilliant mind is focused on the sensation of his tongue between John's lips and the heat of his hand gently stroking down between John's shoulder blades.
Stop, Sherlock. Just stop. These conversations embedded in John’s frontal lobe, surging up when he least expected it. They nearly whited out his vision, the memory of Sherlock was so strong, the sound of his voice so clear.
Sherlock makes a noise that sounds a bit like whimpering, and it goes straight to John’s spinal column, trilling along his nerve endings until he feels like his entire body is buzzing, and he takes the tip of Sherlock’s cock between his lips and licks into the slit, and Sherlock definitely whimpers this time. His back arches beautifully and John tightens his grip on his hip to keep him still while he takes him completely into his mouth.
This time the guy smiled, and John nearly smiled back, anger slipping for just a moment. John Watson surfaced now and again, leaving him scrabbling inside himself, searching, wondering how emotionally dead a person really had to be to lose themselves completely.
“He would protect us. In fact, I’m certain Baker Street is being watched by his people round the clock. As it's always been."
They tramp up the creaking steps to the second flat, Mrs Hudson in the lead and Sherlock behind John in case he stumbles. He resists the instinct to actually put his hands on John's back and support him up the steps, but only because he knows John would hate it.
The blizzard had just gotten heavy when John left Lester’s and headed back to his hotel. He half thought he had finally lost his mind entirely. He’d made Lester read the texts, to make sure they were real, that he wasn’t just hallucinating them.
So different. Yet, the same John Watson underneath, starting to peek out from beneath the damaged exterior. Sherlock sighs and rubs his hand down his face. He's never been charged with the responsibility of John's heart before. His body, certainly. Keeping him from harm, protecting him from Moriarty and his goons, helping him shower and dress at the hospital - these are things he knows how to do.
He hadn’t talked to Mycroft since a few weeks after Sherlock died. He couldn’t bear it, the glancing resemblances, the expressions both of them made, a similar cadence to their speech patterns; it was a knife to the stomach every time he looked at him.
together. They'll say what needs to be said, and Mycroft will get exactly the information he needs with a minimum of extraneous material. Sherlock will only muck up the works. He'll stay in the background, be a ready hand to hold should John need one. This is what his role is now, John's backup. He finds he doesn't mind that at all.
Sherlock swallowed down the anxiety and followed John to the shower, watching his arse twitch invitingly under the rumpled tartan. Filthy and stained or not, John Waston had not seen the last of that kilt. Sherlock would see to that.
"I know." Sherlock's smile is so wide and warm it fills up his whole face, fills the space between them. He's so very different. Softer, more open, changed by what he went through. John is different, too.  He's gotten sharper, more prickly than he used to be, less apt to be polite just for the sake of it. While a lot of his anger had dissipated since Sherlock came back, he knows he'll never be who he once was. Both of them are so changed. Yet. Somehow they still fit together perfectly. All Sherlock's softness dulls John's sharp edges. They'll
“Oh god oh god. Oh god, John. John can you hear me? Fuck. FUCK.” He’s crying, can feel the tears dripping off his chin onto his bent knees. “Please don’t die, oh my god.”
"So. Being submissive to me, not just in bed, but all the time - your liking to shave for me and wash my hair for me and cook for me, all that - it makes you feel...what? I'm trying to really understand. I'm sorry I'm so thick." John takes a long warm pull of his wine. "Maybe it's the booze."
“Not really. Library, probably, work on my Potions essay. I still haven’t begun reading the chapter on nonverbal spells for Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
He’d sat in bed after, licking his wounds like a cat, shivering with chill. Then he cleaned them properly, dressed them, slipping easily into the role of his own doctor. Then he had cried. Cried like he hadn’t since the night he broke his phone. Cried until there were no tears left, just a raspy throat and snot running down the side of his face onto the mattress. He didn’t know what he was doing anymore. God, he didn’t know. Everything hurt and he just wanted it to stop.
to, because with John he couldn't not. Kissed him hard and desperate, promising to be back as soon as possible. John stroked his face, touched his hair, told him to be careful.
"John, this is all -- new, for lack of a better word." Sherlock snapped open a folded towel and rubbed his wet hair. He threw the Belstaff over the back of a desk chair and began unbuttoning his shirt. "This is going to be - different. Or I imagine it will be. This is very much like starting over."
"Yes. Both. God, I -- I never thought you'd look at me like that. It's amazing. So many years, Sherlock. I've loved you for so long." John puts three fingers under Sherlock's chin and pulls him up to kiss him again, more forcefully this time, and its messy and wet and beautiful, both of them grunting and sighing into each other's mouths like this will never be enough, and it won’t, John knows it won’t. It’s going to overtake them, it’s going to consume them, at least for a while, and John’s not going to fight it. Because he’s wanted and wanted without having, and now. Now it’s all changed.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock says stiffly. He forces a small smile and runs his fingers down over the curve of John’s bicep. “You’re all cleaned up. Let’s have dinner.”
It’s gentle, and soft, the way Sherlock nudges and nuzzles his way into all John’s hollows, the way he did all those years ago. They move together unhurriedly, sweaty under the blankets, cold noses and hot everywhere else. Sherlock gasps and bites at his lips when John rolls them over, crawls between Sherlock’s spread legs, rubs at him through his pants. They kiss more than usual, lingering touches on bottom lips, licking, tasting, Sherlock’s fingers scratching a rhythm on John’s scalp.
Sherlock balks at him, unable to find his voice in the face of John’s easy amusement. Finally he swallows and hisses through clenched teeth, “Of course I’m not asleep. And I don’t find any of this funny. If this is a joke, John, it’s failing miserably.”
Sherlock opens his eyes, able to only just make out the outline of the curtains at the window. The sitting room is dark, darker than it should be. Perhaps the streetlights are out. The room smells different too - smoky and woody, with an underlying scent of cherry tobacco that reminded him of his father’s study. The soft crackling of embers emanates from the fireplace.
The man flipped over and laid on his back. Looked at John approvingly. “I’ve never done it with someone from England before. I like your accent.”
“Shut up.” John grins, eyes sparkling again, the way they always should be. He leans back, sits on his heels between Sherlock’s legs, and lets his gaze wander all over Sherlock’s body, “You’re the beautiful one. And yeah, I have. With girls.”
“No. Well. Maybe I was a bit after it happened. I’m not now.” John searches for that sense of shame he felt last night walking home, but it's gone. “It was just. Very unexpected. I’ve never seen you like that.”
He watched the screen, expecting an immediate response, but there was nothing. Sherlock was likely on the tube, in a dead zone for connectivity. John was damn near crawling out of his skin waiting for this evening’s festivities to begin, but there was nothing for it. Sherlock was on a case, and John would just have to be patient.
John sighed and twisted, wrapping half of his body over half of Sherlock's, leaning them back into the sofa. Sherlock made a small startled noise initially, but reciprocated, tucking his arm behind John's shoulder blades and pulling him close. He put his mouth against John's hair. John crooked his leg over Sherlock's thigh and pressed his face into Sherlock's shirt, breathed him in.
“Christ,” he mumbles, lips sticking together, as he raises his head and watches Sherlock shake and shake and rub his hands frantically all over his own face and chest. John slides up his body and pushes, presses their hollows and swells together, fits shoulder against neck, hip into belly. John’s convinced no two people have ever fit together this perfectly. Their bodies are made to lie together like this, made to be entangled in sweaty sheets, made to curl into each other on cold nights under blankets, John’s nose in Sherlock’s neck.
.” Heat suffuses through him, his eyes rolling back, belly tightening with desire. His hips push up instinctively, rutting clumsily into John’s hand. “
“Waking up with you. Every single time, it blows my mind that I get to do this. That I get to have you. And I would really like to just continue to do that for as long as possible - just wake up with you. I don’t really need much else. Food. Tea. A hot bath. And Sherlock Holmes in my bed.”
"Yes, a very long time. I think it's the most effective solution. For us. Because of how we are. Men who need externally imposed limits, because we don’t give ourselves any."
But something was wrong. John had stopped, a metre behind them. Sherlock spun to look at him, and his face was ashen, fists curled tightly at his thighs.
, did you? That I haven't known where you were all these months? Come now, pet. I thought you knew me better than that. Tsk, tsk, tsk," Jim shakes his head exaggeratedly.
Sherlock keeps trembling, little spasms of his limbs that he's got absolutely no control over. And he's making
John laughs loud and deep as he reaches up to get three coffee mugs from the cupboard. “Harry, how did you even know we were here?”
John kisses fiercely, humming and sighing, nipping at Sherlock's lower lip and licking into his mouth with a hot wet tongue that tastes like...
“So your back is to me, my dear. Over the back of the chair, there you go,” John nudged at my leg, his hands caressing the backs of my thighs, sliding over my calves.
“Sherlock, yes, fuck, why are you even asking? I’m yours, I’m yours. I love you.” John’s fiddling at the hem of Sherlock’s tee shirt, pushing it up, and the touch of his fingers against Sherlock’s bare stomach is electrifying, shock waves shimmering through his every nerve ending. He can almost
"How does Mycroft know about Malvo?" The emotional honesty they'd shared so easily in Bemidji was less so here. Here it was real. Here they had to deal with the aftermath.
Something snaps inside Sherlock at John's being concerned about him. It's so wrong, so unfair, that he should be cared about like this by someone like John. It's so wrong that John should even be out here; that anyone has ever hurt John is anathema, and Sherlock is rapidly filled with cold rage at himself, John's parents, Jim, the goddamned goon with the knife. This is all so very very wrong.
“Fuck yes.” John growls, and sets his wine on the table clumsily, sloshing some over the sides of the glass. He flips and crawls up Sherlock’s body until he’s bracketed between Sherlock’s bent legs. Sherlock’s neck looks so inviting, creamy above his dark shirt collar. John finds his pulse and nips at it with his teeth, rubs his lips back and forth as the heat stirs in his belly. “I love you.”
needed that, would like that. You knew.” John threw the bandage wrapper in the wastepaper basket next to the bed, smoothed the adhesive over Sherlock’s skin.
Tears well up again, burning behind his eyelids. Sherlock loves him and they’re about to die. This is so goddamned unfair.
And he does. Sated, warm, and content, he lets himself fall asleep against the sturdy presence of John Watson breathing against him.
John’s bent over laughing, his hands against his knees, then one arm holding his stomach, guffawing. Laughing so hard he’s crying, as Sherlock rubs his shoulder and frowns down at him. “We can’t snog and walk, Sherlock.”
“He does now.” John’s eyes are metallic grey, flat and simmering. His right hand curls into a fist, uncurls.
“You didn’t have to do that.” John murmurs, pleased and surprised, and crouches down immediately to unzip the bag. He pulls out a thick oatmeal coloured cable knit jumper and grimaces. “I hate this jumper.”
“I know. Always are.” John mumbles, unable to hold Sherlock the way he wants to, unable to pry his eyes back open, not even sure of what he’s saying anymore. He’s aware only of the familiar warmth of Sherlock’s body dipping the mattress down, the quiet rustle of the sheets as they’re tucked around his shoulders. “Love you.”
By the time they’ve come full circle and ended up at the foot of the wide stone stairs that lead into the entrance hall, Sherlock knows that John’s gifted at Potions and terrible at Arithmancy, that he and Rose used to take baths together when they were infants, that he can’t stand pumpkin juice but could drink butterbeer until he pops, and that he’s a night owl, like Sherlock.
,” he grinds out between clenched teeth, hips jerking faster, fingering Sherlock harder and harder, fucking him with his fingers instead of his cock.
The shuffle of John’s newspaper precedes his words, “Ah, Holmes, I was wondering when you’d reemerge. You've been under nearly all afternoon. Did you sort it out?”
There hadn’t been any more mysterious texts since that one morning, now three days previous. John found himself wishing for them now. There was some glimmer, some spark that had ignited within him.
, and John clung to his neck, kissing down across his jaw until he buried his face against Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock responds by bringing the wine bottle with them into the sitting room. The mood feels ominous. John's stomach starts to hurt again. They take positions on opposite ends of the sofa, and it feels like they're even farther apart than the meter between them.
"Neither have I." John twines his arms around Sherlock's neck and pulls him close. "And I'll never say it to anyone else. Ever again. Just you."
“Missed me.” John smoothes Sherlock’s mussed fringe away from his forehead as he nods in agreement, and kisses Sherlock once more on the mouth, “It’s nice to be missed. I missed you too, so much. We just needed to touch each other for a bit, I think, before we could talk. Feel better?”
." Sherlock does turn to him now, and his face is so open, so receptive and sweet and yearning, that John can't help himself and reaches out, sweeps a hand over Sherlock's forehead and down the side of his face.
John takes a drag and exhales, keeps breathing out hard and long once the smoke is gone, and leans his forehead against his hand. He doesn't look at Sherlock. "I'm so sorry. I think I'm kind of a mess."
James continues calmly as though John hasn’t spoken. “Pureblood. Your father spent a lifetime toiling away at the Ministry, but never advanced. Your mother was gifted but troubled. She should have been a superstar, should have been Minister of Magic, but...never quite could make it, could she? Had a problem with - ” He mimes drinking, and makes a glugging noise. “Died in St Mungo’s when you were only eight, didn’t she, Johnny? Did you get to visit her? Cry on her bedsheets?”
“Sherlock?” His voice carries on the winter wind, and he turns his face into the buttery leather of Sherlock’s collar. “Can I ask you something?”
“It’s not traditional. That’s a difficult concept for you. You can get...stuck…on ideas about how things should be, as opposed to how things actually are.”
The rest of dinner passes companionably, Sherlock’s bad mood dissolving as they discuss their new classes, new teachers. The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Sally Donovan, is young, only having graduated from Hogwarts five years previous. She’s spent the intervening years travelling and learning from Aurors and Magical Creatures experts across the globe. She knows an enormous amount about the Dark Arts, and most importantly, she doesn’t treat them like children. Sherlock likes her almost immediately.
“Where?” Sherlock gets John’s drift, softens his pose and leans forward, runs his fingertips along John’s bicep, and lowers his lashes.
He twists his wedding band round his finger with his thumb, eyes falling on the fading scars on his forearm from where Sherlock had cut into him so many months ago. They haven’t revisited any blood play since then, somehow hasn’t seemed necessary. They understand how much they belong to each other; it doesn't need to be reinforced constantly.
John laughed. Fuck, was everyone in this city trying to pick a fight with him? Ah, he wasn’t in the mood. He took another drag and threw it on the ground, crushing it with his heel.
“Not really.” Sherlock pulls the canvases back in place and leads John down the cracked tile steps. The tube station is damp, being right next to the river, and a bit mouldy, but it’s familiar. Welcome. It’s been a hell of a long day.
She smiled at him and gave him an appraising sort of once over gaze lingering on his hips. "That's very true."
"Yeah, I dunno. Never had one. Thought I might give it a go." John stretched his legs out and yawned. The hand that wasn't in Sherlock's hair fell to his waist and squeezed. "You don't approve?"
“Don’t stop, John. Please don’t stop.” He stretches his hands behind him and sinks down into the bed, and John presses back into him, until Sherlock’s legs are resting over John’s shoulders with his heels in the perfect c of John’s lower back.
John sighs and chews his lip, looking regretful. “I’ve really got to go get a shower before lunch. I’m all - ”
"You've been thinking about this for a long time, haven't you?" John says fondly, taking hold of Sherlock's chin and turning his head to face him. Sherlock's green grey eyes are glowing like raw emeralds in the semi darkness, searching John's, imploring him to understand, to agree.
Sherlock murmurs something unintelligible that sounds like agreement, curls his legs up to bracket John’s hips, and pulls John’s lower lip tenderly into his mouth, sucking softly and running his tongue back and forth along the inner rim. John sinks deeper toward him, feeling as though he’d be content to just dissolve into this moment, their tongues languidly exploring each other’s mouths, Sherlock’s toes tracing a circle against the back of John’s thigh, their bellies already becoming slick with precome and sweat as they find a gentle rhythm together.
Blinking and trying to orient himself, John squints at the bedside clock. 4:14am. He must have dropped off around 6:00pm, about two hours after Sherlock. Christ, ten hours of sleep.
- what a lovely phrase. It’s no different, really, from how she’s always referred to them, except now they belong to each other properly.
John's breath ghosted hot over his ear, his small hands slipping down to knead at Sherlock's waist. He pressed a close mouthed kiss under Sherlock's ear and rubbed his nose at the lobe before pulling back. "Okay, no, you're right, love. Let's get the bags, and I'll find where the logs are stashed. We'll build a fire, have a drink. How does that sound?"
"Oh, sorry." Sherlock reaches into his jacket to get out a twenty, but before he can hand it over, Mrs Hudson comes rushing out the front door and raps smartly on the cabbie's window.
He double checks that he still has Lestrade's card in his pocket, the edges of it worn oily smooth by his constant rubbing of it. He checks his money, enough to buy a burner phone in an all night Sainsbury's, and flips through the steps of his plan in his mind like going through an old fashioned Roladex. So many variables he can't account for, so many ways this could go so badly.
John skids around the corner of the kitchen doorway, darts back into the bedroom and flips the light on. Sherlock squints and grumbles, waves a hand at him. "Turn it off."
He opens his eyes and John’s there, sitting in what Sherlock’s come to think of as his chair, left ankle crossed over his right knee, sipping coffee from a takeaway cup and chewing thoughtfully. Sherlock pushes up with his good arm, and John immediately reaches up to help him, pushes a pillow behind his back to support him while he sits up.
“Shit.” Fumbling, rubbing at his eyes, he parts the curtains and leans over the side of the bed to grab it before anyone else can be helpful and pick it up.
John tilted his chin up and Sherlock bent down, kissing him softly. John’s arms encircled his neck, pulling him closer, gently winding his fingers into Sherlock's hair.
To his very great embarrassment, he felt himself flushing. He was a world class flirt, or had been once upon a time. He supposed he'd rather stopped noticing when anyone other than Sherlock was flirting with him. There was no mistaking the look the bartender was giving him now, though. It was playful and heated and her own hips twitched as she turned around to put his card in the reader.
John smiles and pulls back, taking Sherlock’s hands off his back and squeezing his fingers. “I just have to change, okay? I’ll be right back.”
The flat is quiet when Sherlock creeps up the steps. He has a momentary wave of relief, thinking John must still be asleep. The flat door is unlocked. He swings it open gently, and is just pressing it closed when John appears in the kitchen doorway. He's still in the oversized tee shirt from the night before, his small bare feet and tiny statute incongruous with the fury radiating off of him. He looks ten feet tall. He fills the sitting room.
“No. No. That’s not...I didn’t agree to that.” Sherlock shoves at the man, fists against his sweaty shirt. He’s so skinny, why is he so strong? Because Sherlock hasn’t had heroin in almost twenty four hours and he’s withdrawing and weak as a fucking kitten, and trapped on his back against the door of a car. That’s why. Sherlock, you sodding fucking fool.
Sherlock can barely bring himself to say the word, not knowing what tomorrow will bring them. He swallows, jaw working against the waver in his voice, "Yeah. Tomorrow. Let's go to sleep, yeah?"
Lulled by the sweetness of that memory, John allows himself to fall asleep, one hand still twined in Sherlock’s hair.
There’s no time for explanations, no time to talk about this, to reconsider. John tears off his gloves and throws them on the floor, grabs Sherlock by the lapels as gently as he can manage, lining their bodies up, his knee sliding against the inside of Sherlock’s. Their hips bump, and even through layers of fabric, even when they’re seconds from not even existing anymore, it sends a shiver down John’s spine that he can’t cover up.  Sherlock’s looking down at him steadily, not pulling away. John tilts his chin, eyes still locked with Sherlock’s. Sherlock blinks at him, that endearing ridiculous habit that means he has absolutely no idea what’s happening or how to handle it, and John feels his eyes filling.
John rubs his hand up and down Sherlock’s spine, rhythmic, and he can feel his body giving in to sleep, his eyes drifting closed again and again until he can’t drag them back open.
The cab pulls to an abrupt stop at the kerb of grey stone house, black scuffed door with a crooked 221 hanging from it. Next to it is a shuttered cafe with a ragged burgundy awning that reads Speedy's. It's much shabbier than the rest of the block, the rest of the neighborhood. That suits Sherlock perfectly. Imperfect. Messy. An unfamiliar sense of -- comfort, maybe -- wells up in him, looking at this unabashedly ordinary house in the middle of fashionable Marylebone. He can envision their life here. For the first time in over a year, he sees himself playing his violin again, standing in the window looking down into the street while John sways behind him with his hands on Sherlock's waist. They're
“Christ, but you’re lovely,” John whispers, slipping under the covers and rucking up Sherlock’s nightshirt with both hands, kissing slowly over each bump of Sherlock’s ribs.
“It was just a little bit. Way less than last night. Just enough to make me not -- shake or anything.” He’s floating just a little, head suddenly light, skull disconnected from his spinal column. He feels himself swooning over to the the left a bit, listing, and puts a hand down on the damp tile floor to catch himself. “Just let me sit here for a minute.”
John kisses Sherlock's chest, and leans over the side of the bed, fumbles at the bag and manages to hook it with one finger while Sherlock runs his toes up the inside of his thighs, "I think we need these."
at resistance, my breath quickening, my entire being alight with emotion at the welcoming touch of his hands as we reacquainted ourselves with one another. Our separation had felt much longer than five days to me, and now, coming home to this achingly
Sherlock nods, pulls off enough that he can pull languidly at the head with his lips, lick into the slit. John shudders hard, and precome leaks salty all over the tip of Sherlock’s tongue.
“No, no, that’s not what I meant,” Sherlock says, alarmed, and pushes up off John’s chest to look at him. “I just - I didn’t know
"No. I just. I like bees." Sherlock tucked his hand under the blankets and gave John's arse a squeeze. "Right here."
- it was all there for John to act upon, and he never could allow himself to experience the vulnerability, to hazard the danger of what if.
Sherlock allowed himself to drift away from the inanity of the conversation, knowing John was doing exactly what John always did - jumping in at precisely the right moment with some nugget of genius that Sherlock would never have come up with. He looked into the doorway to their left, what seemed to be a music room. A black baby grand piano sat by the window, next to a neatly stacked mountain of sheet music and an empty stand with half a silver flute resting in it. Everything was coated in a very thin layer of dust, but there were fresh flowers in a vase in the window and the carpet had been freshly hoovered - a room tidied, but not used.
"I just thought...when I came home...no, shit, sod this. I can't. I just can't, I'm sorry." He's suffocating with the weight of this, with what it will mean for them. His legs aren't supporting him anymore. He drifts down onto the couch, putting his coffee cup on the table harder than he should have and coffee geysers out of the lid, splashes all over the wood.
Sherlock nods, unable to speak in the face of such unfailing kindness and understanding. He really doesn’t know how to handle John Watson.
“I’m not.” Sherlock climbs over John and moulds up behind him, cupping John’s small body entirely within the lines and angles of his own gangly one.
"Tell me," John whispers, watching Sherlock watching him as he finally slips his hand around smooth satiny skin, blood hot, and slowly drags the pliable skin up over the hardness underneath, "Oh, god, Sherlock. You feel so good."
"Okay." John turns and snuffles against Sherlock's shoulder, hums. "You're a cocktease bastard, but I love you anyway."
John’s arm over his waist, John’s breath soft at the nape of his neck, John’s cold bare foot tucked between his ankles. John
They kiss and kiss, Sherlock’s hands drifting down John’s neck, caressing over his shoulder blades and following the dip of his lower back. John leaves Sherlock’s mouth to trace the tip of his tongue over the perfect line of that jaw, up to pull gently at his earlobe with his teeth. Sherlock moans low and deep, digging his fingers into the barest hint of soft flesh at John’s hips.
Then he was falling back, pain radiating through his jaw, head bouncing against the edge of the mattress. As he fell, he thought incongruously how comical that must have looked. A bearded face loomed over him, black eyes intense.
Sherlock’s eyes snap open, and he would grab John by the jumper and pull it off if John wasn’t already doing it himself. After he has struggled his arms out of the sleeves and let the jumper drop on the floor with a soft thud, they both stare at his chest, searching for the single black dot.
There’s a single thorn sticking out of his chest, black and needle-sharp, the skin around it sore and red. While this is fascinating from a scientific perspective, he is soon alarmed; he can’t let John see this new stage of the curse. He would fuss even more, insist that he needs to inspect it closely, and Sherlock can’t bear any more of his touchꟷ
“Mm. Yeah, it was this. I tried to find some company at the bar but I just wasn’t feeling it, and then I realised I just wanted to come home. To you. Freaked me out a bit, to be honest, so I probably had too much to drink.”
With a last sigh into the crook of John’s neck, Sherlock dares to face him again. “I’m glad you did. Come home, I mean.”
Sherlock studies the dark blue eyes, so wide and intent, and decides to believe him. After all, he has already been wrong about John Watson once before.
However, because he generally sleeps little, having no control over the dreams hasn’t been a problem until lately.
John’s eyes don’t leave Sherlock’s as they abandon the rest of their clothes on the bedroom floor. It’s a fierce look overflowing with life, and it opens locked doors in Sherlock’s mind, allowing John to step in and walk the labyrinth without fear.
“Hang on, your neck,” John says suddenly, and the steps he takes are definitely in the wrong and oh-so-right direction as he reaches out and puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. Now that Sherlock thinks about it, there’s definitely something cold trickling up his neck, twisting and turning on its way, slowly beginning to constrict him like a python. John’s fingers feel hot against his skin, his thumb settling over Sherlock’s pulse point.
he looks, standing there framed by the muted colours of the night, making it almost impossible for Sherlock to remember his decision? He could never forget this man, but he must at least be able to let go of the more tender thoughts associated with him, for the sake of both of their wellbeing.
If he chooses not to trust his own senses, there is a theory that would explain some of it, yet even the briefest thought of it makes his stomach lurch.
, there’s the life that had been missing from his eyes. Sherlock finds he can’t look away either and fights to keep his expression neutral as the thorns twist and expand, quickly cooling his body. His stomach churns.
I'm back earlier than expected because apparently I just can't stop writing this? Now I really have to focus on school stuff for a while, though.
Encouraged by this, Sherlock smiles and winks at John before leaving the laboratory. As soon as the doors shuts behind him he lets a sheepish grin spread across his face. Perhaps it had been a little too much, perhaps the man won’t come tomorrow, but at least he had tried.
“Leave it, John.” Sherlock grits his teeth as his fingers fumble to catch the approaching hand, but John has already got hold of the sheet and pushed it aside to reveal the curse. Now it just seems like Sherlock is pressing John’s palm there, over his heart, and he quickly lets his hand drop and resigns himself to staying very still while John studies the black shapes. His little puffs of breath tickle Sherlock’s skin, and he shivers delicately.
He lets his body become very still, no longer resisting, and then he opens his eyes and looks at John, looks at him even as his vision is blackening, as he’s being lifted in strong, gentle arms, and loves him.
He stands to leave the room, but something about Hope’s next words manages to make him walk back to the table and snatch one of the bottles.
His heart jumping, Sherlock has to shut his eyes to make sense of the words, to savour them. As he listens to the endless echo of them, the deductions start to become crystal clear, organising themselves in his mind in ways that should have been obvious, and yet it took them months to get there.
“Yeah, I know,” John says, “I know we’re rubbish at it, but I don’t think ignoring it is going to work this time. So please, Sherlock. Tell me what happened twelve years ago.”
“Tolerable.” It’s true: the two-dimensional branches that started to spread around his neck have stilled for the time being, and he can breathe freely. Of course there’s the familiar dull ache around his upper body, but it’s nothing compared to the pain he has just experienced. He wonders what it would be like to be completely free of it, and if it would feel like a missing organ.
Sorry about the cliffhanger ;) Don't worry, it'll all be resolved next time! I hope you enjoyed the twists - either way, thanks for reading!
Sherlock falls, but doesn’t get the relief of waking up in the middle of the air that usually comes with nightmares.
John hums but doesn’t continue, his eyes dark and flickering with ideas, fingers stroking Sherlock’s sides absently as he tries to work out how to proceed. “Bedroom?” he asks then, his tone light and careful, the implications clear but easy to brush away if needed. As much as he seemingly needs to ask this and wants the affirmative, he’s giving Sherlock space, a chance to run for cover before the downpour if he so decides.
He doesn’t mention the protective poppet placed under his bed, complete with dark curls and long coat.
John beams at him and leans in so that their foreheads are touching, the hand cupping Sherlock’s face traveling down his neck and chest, brushing the scars left by the thorns. “Yeah?”
Judging from the playful tone, he probably means it as a joke, but Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat. He feels somewhat exposed and takes a long moment to gather himself before replying.
, was a punishment. Under no circumstances would he admit it to Mycroft, but he had been right. Sherlock was prone to addiction, too “sensitive”, he couldn’t deal with emotions. From now on he had to work harder, so he traded them for a sweet substance in his veins – finally, a distraction strong enough to hold his attention for longer than a few precious moments.
“Right, okay,” John says. His tongue darts out to wet his lower lip – a nervous tick? (Or a sign of attraction? Look out for others.) “You’re unattached, like me. Fine. Good.”
“Yeah, about that. I’ve been thinking.” John straightens his shoulders and sucks in a breath, but Sherlock interrupts him.
Sherlock swallows and looks at the small puddle his shoes have made on the floor and swallows again, but the lump in his throat won’t go away. “You really can’t see it?” he asks. It’s been a long time since he’s spoken so quietly in front of Mycroft, and it feels humiliating to show so much weakness, but he needs to be sure.
All that remains is to point out some of his own worst qualities in order to test the waters a bit, see if John Watson flinches and comes up with an awkward excuse to leave the situation, like most people probably would. But from his dumbstruck (though also confused and slightly annoyed) expression Sherlock can tell he’s not most people.
“Not long after you stormed off,” John glances at him sideways, “I noticed my chest hurt a bit. Went to the loo and noticed this little dot. I was so pissed off I tried to just ignore it, and that made me think. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t spread via personal contact. It’s more like an idea or, uh, a certain way of thinking.”
Two thuds, then John’s bare feet tapping on the floor as he walks into the room, his hair mussed and his eyes only half open. Even in his bewilderment, Sherlock can’t help but admire the way John’s boxers cling to his thighs, a pleasant memory making his neck flush.
In some ways, it’s easier to live without the mask. Still, although only light scars now remind them of the curse, the learned behaviours don’t magically change overnight, nor do the fears upon which Sherlock used to build his existence disappear in a flash. There are days he wakes up unable to ignore the phantom pain in his chest, unable to take a step closer to John. On those days, he can just barely make out the shadows of snowflakes on the ground even though there’s nothing casting them.
“Yes. You can carry me there,” he says, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders and pulling his knees up expectantly.
The sky is clear, all hints of the gentle snowfall of the morning gone. On the ground, there are naked grey areas where the snow has begun to melt, creating little puddles. When he steps outside, he can’t see his breath anymore; the temperature has risen at least six degrees.
“Kiss your boyfriend?” Sherlock asks with a half-serious, half-teasing face, for once allowing himself to be a bit ridiculous. It’s the endorphins, no doubt.
“No, no. You’ll be fine, just let me – let me help.” John’s voice breaks on the last word, and then Sherlock’s knees are buckling and John is placing one arm behind Sherlock’s back and another under his legs, huffing at the length of him.
“So,” John says, his voice gaining volume, “you’re a genius, I’m sure you have some kind of theory as to what made it appear in the first place.”
“So it would seem,” Sherlock repeats. He burrows his face into John’s shoulder and breathes him in, too overwhelmed to look at him right now. It feels strange, being this close, but entirely right in a way few things in his life have.
Eventually he had to let that go, too, as the layer of dirt under his nails got a little too thick, the days blurred into one another, and the thorns still wouldn’t disappear.
This finally silences John. Sherlock catches a glimpse of his hurt look as he turns away, and it’s just like he imagined: John’s mouth is a hard line and his eyes are burning. But there’s no other choice. Sherlock grabs his coat and scarf and tries to forget the gentle hand that had held his just a few minutes ago.
) gives him a small smile, which is brave of him and doesn’t seem to fit the situation at all. Sherlock ignores the pleasantries, rattles the address in a clipped tone and settles on the backseat. He flips his phone out of his pocket and is annoyed to notice his hands are shaking. He no longer remembers what he was going to do with the phone.
. If it’s really nothing, you can show me, right?” John steps closer and reaches out to him, brows furrowed. Always the concerned doctor.
“Oi, you git! I’m only a few years older than you. But cheers, I guess.” John raises an imaginary glass and flashes a grin at him. “You’re not so bad yourself.”
As suspected, there is now a second thorn pushing through his skin, a bit lower than the first one. If not for the pain and other consequences, he could almost be proud of the morbid sight. It’s like a partly three-dimensional tattoo; he’s becoming a living piece of art, though he suspects he wouldn’t be too keen on hanging on a wall for other people to stare at. Wondering if he could cut a small piece of thorn for closer inspection (he’d scraped a bit of affected skin and carefully analysed it when the curse had first appeared, but he’d found nothing interesting), he looks up to see Mycroft’s reaction.
John shoots him a glare and crosses his arms. “Why would having a friend make it worse? It doesn’t make any sense.”
For a few seconds, John’s voice seems far away, which is completely illogical because he’s standing right there and Sherlock can still feel the ghost of his touch on his chest. He blinks rapidly and catches his balance.
“Not until you stop pretending,” Sherlock growls, a bit of panic mixing with the anger despite all his efforts to keep it down.
Sherlock sighs; there’s no getting out of the situation. Should have just lied it was a tattoo. “It’s a curse.”
He sweeps past her ꟷ ignoring another hurt look he’s caused ꟷ and out of the front door, right into a snowstorm.
. After quickly dealing with Lestrade, he walks over to John, who avoids his gaze and appears nonchalant until Sherlock reveals that he has worked it out.
“John,” he says helplessly, staring at the thorns still sticking out of his own chest, heart throbbing with the knowledge that they might disappear if he could just summon the strength to say the things he’s been keeping to himself for so long. It’s utterly terrifying.
“This morning?” John manages to splutter. “When did I– Oh God, I didn’t… do anything in my sleep, did I?”
Blinking back unexpected feelings, Sherlock slides his hand out of the warm grasp, careful not to wake up John. Then he gets up and dresses as quickly and silently as he can, eager to get out of the room that seems to have become some domestic sanctuary overnight. John only stirs when he’s at the door.
John Watson, as he learns, is the anticipation of a lightning strike, the seconds before electricity surges through the sky, enough to make the hair on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand up. But the actual strike never comes and he’s left waiting, holding his breath, skin prickling. Desperate for something to change.
“I do, John. I do,” Sherlock says quietly, basking in the knowledge that he can actually say this without a sharp stab of pain. “Come on then, your back must be hurting you.”
“I see,” Sherlock says, even though John is already lost in thought and clearly not expecting an answer. He’s smiling to himself, eyes unfocused, giving Sherlock a chance to study him without trying to hide it. Frustratingly enough, he’s not able to figure out the realization John’s had. He wanted to come home, but why? Certainly not because of him; he has been sulking all day and ignoring John’s attempts at conversation for at least half of that time. The spilled beer on his shirt sleeve doesn’t tell much: there are no marks of a fight, so probably he was just clumsy due to his intoxication. He didn’t have company, otherwise he would have been too polite to excuse himself after only two hours.
The streets, once under a layer of snow, are now wet and glistening. Tiny clouds hang high above the buildings as if waiting for the wind to blow them away, their job already finished for the day. All in all, it looks like an ordinary morning in late March – or what those used to look like before the eternal winter the world has been living for the past few years.
“Okay,” John says. “That’s good. Tell me if it becomes too much. I don’t want you to lose consciousness again.”
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open and then settled into an stupefied grin. He ran his hands flat against John’s thighs and knelt up so their faces were inches apart. His breath smelled of coffee and cinnamon. “John Watson, you
John's getting so close, his arse tightening, thighs shaking so violently he can hardly keep up his rhythm. His stomach muscles begin to contract, a rush of endorphins making his scalp tingle and his shoulders quake. Sherlock has to come first, while John's still hot and hard inside him.
"So I'm not explaining this well, is what you're saying." A hint of frustration creeps into Sherlock's voice, his back muscles tensing under John's palm.
“Okay, but later. Please come here. If you make me ask again, I’m going to start thinking you want me to beg.”
John’s gaze flicks up to meet Sherlock’s, and all the breath leaves Sherlock’s lungs as swiftly as though he’s been punched in the stomach. He’s gorgeous, undoubtedly, but that’s not it. There’s something dark and complicated lurking inside those dazzlingly blue eyes, something Sherlock wasn’t expecting to see in the face of the wildly popular Quidditch team captain. He expected vapid and useless, and instead there’s real intelligence. Depth. Ferocity. Something darker.
“I love watching you come undone. So composed in public, so polished. But get two fingers in your arse, and look at you. Begging, desperate for it.” John shoved his fingers ever harder within me as he spoke, pushing me closer to my climax even without being touched.
However, when he walks into the kitchen moments later, Sherlock hands him a plate with a huge slab of lasagna oozing cheese everywhere, and holds up a bottle of wine with a forgiving smile.
Sherlock woke up with a start, the feeling of John’s fingers in his hair just out of reach. He ruffled his own fingers through his hair and sighed. Dawn was breaking, a pale shard of pink light drifting the the crack in the doors of the baggage car. He’d slept all night. Hadn’t done that in, God, he couldn’t remember when. He lived in a constant state of exhaustion and hunger, Mycroft reluctantly lending assistance only when Sherlock’s life was in imminent danger.
John drags him down another corridor, this one stacked with boxes of liquor and crisps, piles of burnt out spotlights and several rolling wardrobes hung with drooping feather boas and spangly dresses. There’s a tiny loo at the end, a hideous shade of green, the paint chipping,  and barely big enough for both of them to fit at the same time. They squeeze inside and John locks the door with a rusty slide bolt, turns to Sherlock and kisses him, pushing his sweat and come stiffened hair back from his forehead.
“Help you with something?” The manager was a gigantic woman, barely able to turn around between the counter and the wall, greasy hair pulled back in a tight bun, crisp crumbs on her shirt. He really couldn’t give a fuck what she thought.
“Seriously, John.” Sherlock raised his head, his cheek still warm from where it had lain against the comforting rhythm of John’s blood pumping through his aorta. He took John’s other hand, and covered John’s smaller ones with both of his. Cradled them. “Listen to me. I don’t want us to be constantly apologising to each other. We’re going to have moments of anger, of confusion, and frustration. We’re...not the same people we were two years ago, and we have both been through our own separate hells. But I love you even more now than I did then, and you’re all I’ve thought about, and I can’t bear for you to apologise to me anymore. I understand how sorry you are, and I hope you understand how sorry I am, and I just...we keep saying the same things and there’s no need. Please, let’s just
Molly doesn’t seem to notice his indifference to her company. She just steps aside to let Sherlock through the door and then falls into step beside him as he queues up at the counter.
“Do you - I mean to say, ask -” Sherlock couldn’t say it. He shifted, finally brought his arm out from behind John’s back, and templed his hands over his mouth and nose and rubbed. A comforting gesture, one that cleared his mind somehow, allowed him to focus on one thought, instead of the hundreds of words that were pummeling his neurons and trying to make themselves heard.
They dress in silence, a chill between them that feels unfamiliar and unsettling. Sherlock finishes first, wrapped in tissue thin flannel pyjama bottoms and an old Army tee shirt of John’s that stretches tight across his slightly broader chest. He throws his dressing gown on over top and leaves the room without saying a word.
She had said to him to wait for Harry, but he went out without her. She wasn’t coming anyway, he knew.
Just in time, the big ben bell ringed. He heard happy cheers. A month had passed, and he was not any near to recovery. He didn’t want to move on. He couldn’t just… leave him like he did. He couldn’t stop thinking about it.
“You couldn’t just do it out of” he shook his head, confused “nothing” he cried, his eyes watering. He rested his head is his hands, exhausted.
She had told him earlier she was going to head to misses Turner’s in the evening, and wouldn’t return untill the next day.
Losing track of time was usual for him after Sherlock's death. He couldn't care less. "Mrs hudson must have left" he realized./p>
"This is nosense" echoed in his head "Why am I even here?" His head hurt. There was no reason for him to be there, drunk in Bart's roof, sulking and being miserable. Frankly, everything he had done lately felt the same way. John himself felt that way: useless.
The cool air hit his face pleasantly, and he walked slowly to the border, closing his eyes, breathing deeply. He  Sherlock came back to his mind. Well, he never really left it.
Uncertainity flooded his mind, pressing the insides of his head, making him numb. He lost balance and  fell down to the floor before taking another sip of the bottle, the last one, to later tossing it off somewhere around him carelessly
“Oh, and John, dear” She had added before parting to her flat, with a charming pleading look in her eyes “Do me a favour, would you?”
All cool and mysterious, he recalled. The silence was infuriating, and the sound of Sherlock’s expert hands playing would be extremely alluring. In fact, anything at all would be.
John grabbed her hand and squeezed it softly. Mrs. Hudson has been taking care of him with motherly care. She putted her own grief aside to make sure he didn’t do anything crazy during those first, awful days. Of course, he had catched her more than once washing Sherlock’s usual teacup along with the dirty dishes even when it needn’t cleaning, or coming everyday in the morning with Sherlock’s favourite biscuits, knowing John disliked them. Even sometimes letting out a tear watching the violin that one annoyed her so much on some nights. But she had been strong for him, and he should be for her too for once. She deserved it.
Realisation hitted him hard. He tried standing up again, failing. He ended up with his arms on the railing, looking away.
He took a deep breath trying to calm himself, failing tremendously. Even the air in the flat reminded John of Sherlock. His annoyingly posh cologne and hair product, the smell of cigarettes (that John had been happy to notice had dissolved a little, but not entirely), the disgusting odor coming from the kitchen produced by the body parts on the fridge John refused to get rid off almost a month later, the relaxing scent of tea. Sherlock was everywhere. In the flat, in his mind, in London. Pain and guilt came along with his memory.
Slowly, as in physical pain, he went and grabbed one of Sherlock’s coats. Using them was probably very not good to his “move on” thing, if that ever was going to work, but he couldn’t go out otherwise. He needed something with him. He needed him around. But that couldn’t be, so a coat, his very symbol of his escence suficed.
“Such a coward" he mouthed, exhaling. His chest feel tight, and his whole body felt drained of energy.
For now, he thought, the Scotch should be enough. It wasn't, but John could tell himself so. He could easily lie to himself. Always could.
He was gone, and nothing was bringing him back. If moriarty had indeed been on this rooftop and made him jump, it didn’t matter because he was dead already. He had lost everything he had, and there was nothing he could do about it. He couldn't even go back to the army, and even that wouldn't be enough. Nothing would be. Defeated, he looked up the sky, angry. He pulled his hair, and let a sob escape his dry mouth.
The windows of the living room of 221b were always open. The curtains moved by the wind gracefully, and John, now sitting in his usual chair, could perfectly picture Sherlock playing his violin where he usually does.
To be honest, going out by himself wasn't that much of a problem. It's not like he could just kill himself. He had tried once, only to discover that, different from what he had believed, Mycroft still had an eye on him. He didn’t get why, being Sherlock… gone, he would still follow him everywhere. He vaguely guessed it had something to do with sentiment, not even caring to find out at this point.
Trying to avoid pitying himself any more, he wondered what  possibly could make Sherlock even consider doing this. Jumping. What could make him call him, lie to him, and make him watch.
He lied to himself, to his father while he lived, to his friends, to Ms. Hudson, to Ella, and, later on, he would lie to Mary. There was one, and just one person he couldn’t lie too. He couldn't hide things from. He had hated himself for it, for being too blatantly obvious and pathetic, at times. But right now, he wished he could have been more like that. More honest, more open. Maybe things wouldn't have gone the way they did had he just fucking talked. /p>
Sherlock knew John would be destroyed if he died. And he did it anyway. He hated him for it. But apart from any resentment and grief, John still found his suicide unbelievable.
He would have died for him. Would have given his life if that had saved him. He had already sacrificed himself for him back in the pool where Carl Powers died, and would do it again without a doubt.
He entered Barts from the backdoor, knowing the building like the back of his hand. He managed to get to the rooftop without being noticed.
He realised Sherlock must have had a reason way more deeper than just “being a fraud”which he wasn’t,  to do such thing. He knew he wasn’t. He knew the lightened gaze Sherlock made every time a case really got him, the silent guilt he felt every time he didn't solve the case in time and someone else died. He knew how terrified he looked when the girl started screaming when he saw him that die. He knew better that to ever consider Sherlock told him a lie. He was so alone, and he had helped him so much.
He took one last look at the exasperatingly empty flat and closed the door behind him, going down the stairs. As predicted, Mrs. Hudson was nowhere to be seen.
“Please do get out a little bit tonight, will you? Harry said she would pass to say hi by midnight, you two could go out somewhere and take a little air out of this place full of…"she trailed off. Receiving nothing close to a response apart from the sudden tension in his hands and a pained look to the floor, she continued, placing a gentle hand in his cheek “I know it’s hard, but I assure you, it'll help. Just for me, promise me you’ll try to, yes?”
Sherlock's reading a particularly interesting section about relocating hives for the winter months. He sighs heavily. "I love classical music. Not this...whatever it is."
John smiled, his cheeks flushed above his beard, glistening wet with saliva, lewd and gorgeous. He was the picture of debauchery, indigo eyes shining with lust, smelling like musk and sex. "You lazy sod," he murmured fondly.
to talk about it. He wanted John's breath and skin. He wanted his smells and his sweat and his shaking body underneath him. He wanted to touch every part of John with his mouth and his hands and forget that they were two separate people who sometimes didn't understand each other.
, and Christ, it’s glorious. He wants to be marked, be sore and aching for days, he wants to look in the mirror and see the evidence of John’s love scratched pink across his face. He claws at John’s head, and pulls him so close he can barely breathe, licks behind his teeth and under his tongue. Their teeth clack together and John pulls back, rocks their foreheads together and breathes hard.
“You’ve - you’ve no right to be so quick -” Sherlock gasped, half bent over and bracing his hands against his knees. “Your legs are half as long as mine.”
Sherlock considers that, his head tilting to the left the way it always does when he’s thinking. His eyes roam over John’s face, curious and sparkling.
Not that he much cared about himself anyway. Sherlock's entire focus was John. Make John well. Make John happy. Take John home.
John softens, the swell of anger subsiding. “I know that, sweetheart. And you’re very good at it. Amazingly good at it. It doesn’t mean you have to be perfect at it, alright? And the most important thing here is that a criminal’s been caught, yeah? Isn’t that the point of what we do? We get the bad guy. Well, the bad guy is gotten. No one else is going to get hurt, and I am certain that your deductions up until last night aided in that.”
Sherlock resumed stroking him slow, more just letting John thrust into his grip as he rode Sherlock. He thumbed at the slit, spreading precome in a slippery circle, pressed the pad of his thumb against the frenulum. John jerked forward hard, clenching tight around Sherlock's prick. Orgasm started gathering at the base of Sherlock's spine, heat spreading between his legs and up into his lower belly. He bent his knees against the weight of John's arse, let John lean back against the tops of his thighs as he rose up and down, rocked his hips from side to side and panted shallowly.
John’s fingers relaxed. He was trembling. “ Shit. I’m -- I’m sorry, Sherlock. I know you went through something awful, too. I just wish…” A long exhalation wracked him, and when he spoke again, his voice was shaking like the rest of him. “I just wish I would have been allowed to protect you. I always did.I took care of you.
Sherlock giggles, lilting and happy, and the sound of it lights John up from the inside out. He presses a hard kiss to Sherlock’s lips and throws a leg over Sherlock’s thigh. Heat blooms between them, slow, familiar. The tip of a tongue, a low exhalation, Sherlock dips exploring fingers along the waistband of John’s pyjamas. Promising.
John swallows and licks at Sherlock's earlobe, "Yeah. I just kept thinking - I couldn't stop thinking, even when I wanted to - if I could just -
Time stopped. John could hear Sherlock breathing, could hear the snow outside, the wind howling. There was a distant squeak of a nurse’s sensible shoe on the linoleum floor. His own heart was thudding in his ears deafeningly loudly.
The amused expression falls off John’s face at once, his lips setting into a tight line. “Alright, you’re really starting to worry me now, Holmes. I’ve never seen you so agitated when you come out of one of your traces,” Crossing the room decisively and kneeling down so he’s at eye level with Sherlock, John spreads Sherlock’s eyes wide with thumb and forefinger and peers into them. He shakes his head. “It’s no good, I need more light. I’m going to fetch my bag and another lamp. You stay right there and don’t move.”
John’s hands are on his wrists now, pushing his arms above his head and holding them there. He instinctively pushes back, and John’s fingers tighten momentarily and then relax.
“Show-off.” Mike grins at Sherlock and shakes his head. “I’ve been to a million practices and scrimmages, and I’ve never seen John play like this. I mean, he’s excellent, but. He wasn’t kidding when he said he was going to work harder to impress you. He’s at the top of his game.”
Blow jobs, hand jobs, snogging in the backs of cabs, John’s hand sneaking slowly up the seam of Sherlock’s trousers under the table at Angelo’s while Sherlock nearly gnaws his lip off trying to stay still, Sherlock’s tongue accidentally on purpose trailing hot over the helix of John’s ear as he whispers instructions to him at Scotland Yard...they honestly
He was tiny. So tiny. John was short, but not like this guy. He could practically slide through the cracks in the floor. Everything about him quivered with nervousness, with some kind of deeply embedded lack of confidence in himself. He could barely hold John’s eye, kept dropping his gaze to his lap. What could this little pussy possibly have done?
John burst out laughing and slapped playfully at Sherlock's stomach, wrapped his dressing gown ties round his fists and yanked Sherlock forward until their noses were aligned. "That wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but I'll give you points for creativity."
John grins and leans back into the sofa. "Too late now. I already had it in my mouth. No more condoms. Don't need em."
Sherlock's head snaps up. He looks into Lestrade's earnest chocolate brown eyes, solid and plain like the rest of him. Lestrade looks back evenly, a kind smile on his lips. Sherlock realises they may actually have an ally here.
My own body responded immediately to the touch of John’s skin, a deliciously tremulous ripple of pleasure that rolled down from my scalp and up from my thighs, coalescing like liquid heat in my belly. I felt warm all over, as though I’d been drinking - my limbs loose and hot, my head swimming pleasantly.
" Sherlock rasped, as with one final deep thrust he came, shuddering and digging his fingernails into John's skin. His nerve endings were on fire, white hot flames licking through his entire body as he shook uncontrollably.
"I think I need a nap." He mumbled, as Sherlock pushed him onto the bed by his shoulders and laid him back.
But I was already slinking out of his lap, my kiss-stung mouth filling with saliva at the thought of sucking him. He groaned in anticipation and spread his knees as I sank to mine. I laid my cheek against the soft furred inside of his thigh and nuzzled him, inhaling his scent, at its strongest here. He smelt of black tea and good tobacco, musk and clean cotton, the Sunlight soap which he’d used in the army and never broken the habit of buying.
John’s hand snakes around the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulls him down until their foreheads are touching, their noses aligned. His voice is a whisper, “I don’t care about any of that stuff. I mean. I do
“You can pull. My hair. You can pull it. If you want.” He licks into the slit again, and Sherlock groans deeply as John hollows his cheeks and sucks as he takes him in all the way.
Sherlock complies quickly, scrambling up off his knees and staring at John with wide eyes. The space between them is nothing, just a few feet, and John closes the gap quickly.
John was smiling, but Sherlock didn’t miss the touch of melancholy in his eyes as he turned and looked toward the loch and the village. Sherlock pressed his palm into the small of John’s back, and John leaned into him. They finished their coffee in silence, watching a cold autumn sun slowly burn the fog away.
“And then what? You have - “ John stops, gnawing into his lip. He throws a glance at DS Lestrade, who has averted his glance down to the phone in his lap and is mindlessly scrolling through emails, apparently allowing them to have their domestic in semi-privacy. John drops his voice low enough for only Sherlock to hear, and hisses, “You have
John laughed softly. "Aunt Aileen taught us a bit. I really only knew a few words. I couldn't string a sentence together to save my life. You liked it, though?"
“You shot the cabbie,” he says. It feels hopelessly inadequate, just a tiny fragment of his thoughts.
John raises a finger to silence him and takes a couple of steps towards the stairs, not exactly the epitome of gracefulness, but steady enough.
“Fine,” Sherlock says automatically; the need to cut off inquiries about personal matters is almost a reflex. He touches the real thorns on his chest tentatively – there are three of them now. The skin around them is itchy but soft, and there’s a faint smell of antiseptic cream on his fingers as he brings them to his lips.
Sherlock’s mouth has fallen open. It’s as if he’s been living in an upside-down world only to find it flipped around with just a few words.
He’s had more alcohol than usual, so much that his balance is somewhat compromised and demeanour quite mellow. Sherlock has been keeping a keen eye on his gait lest the limp appear again, but to his silent delight it has stayed away. This time, John doesn’t seem opposed to conversation, and the melancholy aura he usually carries home from the bar is nowhere to be seen.
John’s face goes through an array of emotions in a matter of seconds. Sherlock has to give it to him that he accepts the truth very quickly; only a tiny bit of disbelief escapes from him. Perhaps their lives are already so bizarre that a curse is simply a new mystery to solve. Unfortunately Sherlock has already solved the mystery, and the solution is both disappointing and unpleasant in the extreme.
John sighs. “I don’t think this is going to work. I can’t think of anything like that right now, Sherlock. You’re just going to have to trust me when I say I’m real.”
Next chapter should be up within a month, but I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis, so I can't make absolute promises.
The case of the pink lady provides an excellent chance to prove his deduction right, but somewhere along the way Sherlock gets too carried away and soon realises he has left John behind. John with his bad leg and undoubtedly dark thoughts, John who has yet to decide whether he wants to move in with him or not (though Sherlock suspects, endeavours to make sure he does). John who’s quite possibly hiding a gun in his drawer.
He mentions wanting a flatmate to Mike Stamford in passing, and already a few hours later Mike returns to Barts with an old acquaintance. Sherlock only needs to look at the stranger for half a second before his decision is made. He feels like a little boy in a bicycle shop: he sets his eyes on the perfect one and altogether refuses to consider the other options his mother points out to him.
It only takes one carelessly wrapped sheet around Sherlock’s body to change everything, and certainly not for the better. The lack of interesting cases in March renders him bored and lazy, and on some days he doesn’t bother putting his clothes on at all; instead, he walks around in a sheet. He’s always careful to hide the curse, but as all secrets, it finds a way to become known. This time it’s Sherlock passing by the bathroom one evening and the sheet getting caught in the door handle, causing it to fall off of his left shoulder, and John choosing just this moment to enter the same space.
and wraps his arms around him, holding him so tight he has to stifle a cry, or perhaps a sob, that radiant smile curing all of Sherlock’s ailments, if only for a little while.
Sherlock frowns. “I thought even you had a little more discretion, Mycroft. I’m actually asking for your help. Imagine that.”
When he blinks awake to the seven a.m. light, he groans and tries to cling to the edges of the last dream, but it fades away like they always do, leaving him vulnerable, drenched in sweat and painfully hard.
He has been keeping a certain distance after the dangerous closeness of their first evening together. It’s not entirely unbearable, but sometimes, when they join in laughter and the corners of John’s eyes crinkle just so, he longs to get up from his chair andꟷ
“I don’t know for sure,” he lies, “but I must have done something to make it appear.” Indeed, and he’s doing the same thing at this very moment, letting John in, letting him see and hear and sense.
Mycroft’s eyebrows rise even higher, and he returns to his files as if having lost interest in the conversation. Though he had probably lost it even before Sherlock stepped into the room.
Hope rises his eyebrows. “You don’t think I could come up with this myself, Mr ‘olmes? You underestimate me. They all do. Always.”
“You didn’t find any help on the internet?” John asks, when the last bit of naked skin is safely behind cloth.
It doesn’t take long for his body to become a battlefield for two very different sensations. The heat of his growing desperation manages to keep its own against the chill of the curse, and he does his best to remember every (blurred) detail of the dreams as he chases the wave of pleasure, like the sea chases the moon at low tide.
They’re breathing hard by now, eyes locked, both waiting for the other to turn away. John takes a step backwards and then forwards again, disbelief and confusion written all over his face. Sherlock bites his tongue and starts counting down from ten, telling himself he has to say something even harsher, something that will drive John away for good, and he has to say it in five, four, three, two–
On one January evening, when the grey mass of snow stretches across the city like a tired sigh, a single black curve creeps a few inches upward on its way towards his neck, just below his clavicle. Sherlock has been kicked out of his flat by a furious landlord
At first, it was just a tingling sensation in his upper body – easy to ignore, like almost everything about his transport. But gradually his chest started to itch and hurt, and one morning he awoke to find a curious black spot above his left nipple. As the day passed, the spot changed shape, thinning and curving, and through the sleepless night it continued to grow and had soon reached a form reminiscent of a small thorn branch. Along with it came the cold that would occasionally grip his body and steal the air from his lungs.
John grins at him, eyes bright. Sherlock counts his heartbeats, five rapid thuds, before John presses him flat against the sofa and kisses him. At first it’s just a taste, a shared breath and a brief meeting of lips, all fluttery feeling. But then it deepens, gradually revealing the underlying desire, their hands joined or wandering across warm backs and thighs.
“Are you all right?” he asks, surprised at his sudden and desperate need to know. “You have just killed a man.”
“Go away!” he croaks, then listens to the retreating steps, immediately regretting the outburst that had perhaps been more suggestive than anything his face might have shown if he had come out of the room when called.
A shiver runs through Sherlock as he registers the implications of this, the truth landing on his shoulders like a huge bird, the flutter of its wings tickling his neck.
As soon as the confession leaves his mouth, air rushes into his lungs as if he’d been holding his breath for the last few months. Years, even. Two of the three-dimensional thorns crumble to dust, and the black branch-shaped markings stretching across his skin start to fade slowly, taking the dull ache with them.
During the day, he is slowly becoming a walking wax doll, a close-enough replica of the real-life model but the smile on his face a little too stiff, the eyes hollow and unseeing. However, when he roams the streets at night and it’s snowing, he can make out the individual shadows of the snowflakes in the bright spots under the streetlights. The silent movement of the shadows calms his engine-like mind, and their brief existence is a welcome reminder of the shortness of life.
On some level Sherlock knows what John’s talking about. It has been haunting him occasionally, the image of a man who had lost his purpose in life going about his daily chores alone, hands shaking with the need to make a change but mind too numb to give the command. Sherlock had wanted to mend him, but he hadn’t anticipated John would do the same for him, fill a hole so unique in shape no one else could have fit inside it.
The taste of regret lingers in his mouth mixed with that of blood from where he has been gnawing at his cheek. For the first time in months he craves a cigarette, or, if he’s completely honest with himself, something much more effective.
Sometimes, though, the curse doesn’t even leave him alone in his sleep, but instead takes the form of amber and cerulean icicles piercing his chest. In these dreams, he often opens his eyes only to find a new darkness awaiting him; the thorns have spread all over his body, binding him in place.
Sherlock comes to with a gasp, a soft voice from the vast space between dream and reality he was just floating in still echoing in his ears. His eyes snap open and scan the dim room in a few quick sweeps. He’s lying on the sofa, his shredded shirt unbuttoned and a blanket covering his lower body, letting his toes peek out from under it. The fire is still crackling, but the storm has calmed a little, the roar of it now a gentle breath against the window.
While John prepares the tea, Sherlock wriggles out of his sheet, pulls on a fresh pair of pants and gets under the covers. After he’s settled, John comes back and offers him his tea, then sits on the edge of the bed. He shifts awkwardly for a moment, hands clasped in his lap, legs trying to decide on a position. From the way his body is angled away from the door Sherlock can tell he’s not going to leave, and his back is going to get stiff very soon if he’s got nothing to lean against.
“It’s not so simple”, Sherlock says quickly, torn between wanting to explain and wanting to steer the conversation well away from this topic. “You’re… It hasn’t been this bad. I haven’t let it happen, before. But now…”
If you had mentioned curses to Sherlock Holmes twelve years ago, he would certainly have scoffed and turned away before you got to the end of the sentence. Curses belonged to the world of children, as did magic and all the other ridiculous fantasies some people insisted on believing in.
“I thought it wasn’t.” His voice is barely a whisper, not carrying the defensive tone the words might suggest.
“You okay?” John asks softly, a smile tugging at his lips, but as Sherlock just stares, a hint of nervousness starts creeping back to his features. He squeezes Sherlock’s hand, just once, then lets go.
John rubs his knuckles against his thighs, breathing deeply through his nose to calm himself. “Sherlock. Please.”
The morning light has a strange quality. Sneaking into the room through the gap under the door, it feels warm and nostalgic, though Sherlock doesn’t immediately understand why. He gets up, breathing the combined scent of them, and leaves John snoring softly, his nose pressed into the pillow.
