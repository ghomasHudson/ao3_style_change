“Dean!?” Sam sounds even more panicked, “Are you guys alright!?”
He freezes and feels the world fade into fogginess once more. He hears his brother’s voice, screaming his name desperately, begging,
They’re going to die. This is the end of the line, they’re going to hit the ground and Dean is going to die and Cas is going to get captured and Dean feels so fucking bad for roping Cas into this.
The angel is distracted by Cas, it’s barely looking at Dean. It grabs for Cas’ trenchcoat, pulling him forward, and Dean takes that opening.
that they let Sam see him. Dean hears the sirens, sees the flashing lights, and hears the sound of a paramedic telling Sam to “stay still! You’re bleeding, you can’t help your brother but you can help yourself!”
Cas tilts his head slightly, and then slowly laces their fingers together. “He said that you might be a little confused when you entered, he wanted to let Bobby give you the explanation. So that way, when I saw you, you wouldn’t be as confused about what happened to heaven,” he looks out over the horizon. “He also wanted me to mourn your life on earth a bit.”
Dean cuts him off, and pulls him into a gentle kiss, cradling his face in his hands. He knew what Cas was getting at, that maybe after everything Dean had been through that he shouldn’t have gone out with a blade in his hands. But… he couldn’t care anymore.
He sits up and opens his eyes, to see Cas sitting on the corner of the bed just staring at him. He jumps back, and then glares at Cas, "dude that's fucking creepy," he says.
“You are a soul that died in 2001, for example,” Cas says, looking back at Dean. Dean nods, to ensure that he can clearly grasp the concept of when he died. “Your heaven was created with memories from your childhood, so for you, and the angel guarding your door, your heaven was in 1989 give or take. Considering that you were ten when your adoptive father, Bobby Singer took you in.
Castiel shakes his head. “That I can’t tell you, it’ll make it virtually impossible to remove your memories again.”
why it was wrong. But, of course, we only obey, we don’t question so we didn’t see that what we were doing was wrong.
“It’s my office, I can restore you there.”
There are flashes of light behind his vision and he can’t help but blink back at the feeling of
“Well, I don’t want you to remove my memories,” Dean says angrily, fighting his hold once again.
“Thanks,” Dean mutters and rolls his eyes.
“Hear what?” Bobby asks, catching the ball.
They shift into the back of the Impala, the world getting darker and quieter. They share long languid kisses, their hands tracing running over clothed skin. Dean doesn’t know how long they just sit there kissing, but the time doesn’t matter. What matters is how close he is to Cas, how much he desired to be closer.
“Dean,” Cas starts and takes a deep breath, meeting Dean’s gaze once more, “if I do this… If I help you, I will fall. There will be no Heaven for me to go back to, I will be locked away in Heaven’s prison.”
Dean looks over and notices the bloody handprint on his shoulder, and instead of replying to Sam, he lets out another choked sob.
He feels a hand on his shoulder and he looks up at Cas with wide eyes and Cas nods. "Dean, I need you to stand up, we're gonna have to jump for the door. I'm going to open it right now, and we're going to jump. We have to make it out before," he looks over the edge. "Before we get ambushed by two more angels." Cas' voice is being swallowed up by the wind, and he looks quite stunning, really, if Dean wasn't so petrified he probably wouldn't let himself think that way. Behind Cas, the ocean stretches out, and he's standing as a firm silhouette in the night sky. It's something Dean would definitely describe as angelic.
“A human soul that is filled with memories is much more powerful than a human soul that is a blank slate, like how yours was when it woke up. However, that makes the human soul that much more difficult to control and to funnel power through. For human souls to power the heavenly host they need to be docile. It allows us to continue our mission, while humans get to remain at peace, ”he finishes and leans back against the chair, undoing his tie slightly. Dean can tell that Cas is anxious, that this is something he definitely shouldn’t be sharing with Dean.
“On Earth, we can’t move time, not like in Heaven, just… it’s hard for your little human brain to understand that and I get it,” Cas says and opens the door to a heaven. “Just… know that when we get you out of here, I should be able to put you in a timeline that is ideally only a month or two after you died.”
After a few more moments, the pain slowly begins to subside and Dean is able to fully open his eyes and start to concentrate, but barely. He is still loopy and he lets his mind wander to the angel who is currently working over him.
The moment is cut short when the lights in the hallway turn off and a siren blares loudly over the speakers. Dean doesn’t even have time to think, his migraine feels like it shatters in his head, and he crumples, covering his ears. He hears Cas’ shout of concern in the distance, but he’s too busy trying to breathe through the blinding pain that flares behind his eyelids and fills up his mouth with static, and makes him feel like he’s chewing on tinfoil.
Cas sighs and the muscles in his jaw clench. “They will imprison me for the rest of eternity. I may stand trial, but rebellion is rebellion. I have turned my back on the Host, the same as Lucifer.”
“That doesn’t answer my question, Cas” Dean mutters but let’s Castiel start tracing his hands over his chest. “What are you even doing?”
“Hey, Cas, could you tell me why I’m in pain right now?” Dean asks, breaking the silence between them that was somehow made more oppressing by the weird music.
That’s why Dean is desperate to get out of this heaven because the angels weren’t lying. Dean has been running from this force that has been trailing him, and with each passing second, it gets closer. It causes the hair on his neck to rise and his breathing to get stuck in his throat. Whoever this angel was, Dean didn’t want to meet it.
He spits out blood, and he looks back at Cas. “Looks like they figured out how to catch us off guard,” he says and smiles, seeing Cas’ eyes widen and then the room goes black.
“I won’t let you fall,” Cas says softly, reassuringly.
Dean grips the guardrail tight when they are finally seated in the roller coaster. He takes a shaky breath and looks at Cas, who nods reassuringly and then looks down at the angels who are standing at the very bottom of the ride, looking up at them with glares. They are in the clear, and Dean tries to take solace in that, that they would be off this ride soon enough.
“Cas…” Dean chokes out. “Sammy… I…” he breathes, barely able to get two words out. He grips the phone tighter, trying to control the shaking in his hands. The room was so
Dean glares at Castiel and tries to get a read on him, he also struggles futilely against his grip.
When Cas looks back at Dean, he looks resolved, like this decision is what he’s sticking to and it’s not something he’ll ever go back on.
“You’re joking.”
Castiel sits down, adjusting his tie around his neck. He’s angry. He’s frustrated. He’s downright pissed. He should go down to the office and give Zachariah a piece of his mind about how ridiculous this change was. Castiel was a high ranking angel for crying out loud, he shouldn't be forced to travel down to Earth and gather the souls he'd be forced to clear of memories. There was enough work involved with trying to get the soul to rest at peace, he didn't need to also try and console the person he was working on.
“Not before you, old man.”
Castiel blinks and his look of incredulous confusion turns into one of outright disbelief. “Okay, so you’re on Earth, you find your body. Then what? It’s in the ground right now, it is rotting. You were killed in a car accident, and it wouldn’t do you much good--”
It’s like a burst of sheer energy like electricity is soaring through his head. He can’t even focus on keeping himself conscious.
His brain is riddled with confusion and he frowns, standing up. How did he end up here? What the hell was he doing just a moment ago?
Would it be even more attractive than the other angels he already met? Maybe it would be even more beautiful since it radiated so much more power? Or would it be terrifying to him? Like how angels are depicted in the bible?
?” Cas asks, and huffs a breath through his nose, glaring over at Dean’s hand. “I’m trying to put your soul back together, and I can’t concentrate.”
Dean stares at the wall blankly, at the sheer nothingness in the room. He feels nothing, all he can hear is his breathing. It was so loud in there, how could it be so quiet now? His mind is completely blank, and he can’t even begin to process.
“Shouldn’t we be focusing on the problem at hand here?”
Cas is picking him up, carrying him as fast as he can through an office door.
Cas’ annoyance growing. He looks back up at him to be met with angry blue eyes.
Dean swallows. “There are only three angels, you and I can take them on and easily find another exit.”
Cas huffs and turns around, pointing to the rollercoaster. “It’s at the top of that.”
It ends fairly quickly, he got a few punches in, and one graze of the angel blade but Castiel quickly catches him. He grabs Dean by his wrists, pinning him against the wall. It’s an awkward position, all things considered since Castiel and he was standing face to face.
Dean hangs up the phone and hangs his head. He presses his palms back into his eyes and he sobs again. His whole world crumbling around him.
As suddenly as the noise started, it stops and Dean tries to catch his breath. He slowly opens his eyes, meeting worried blue ones. Dean looks around the room, or tries, barely able to stop it from spinning. He notices what looks like blood in squiggly lines all over the door to the office and he coughs.
Sam was flipping through a college booklet his face beaming at the various photos. He had received a full ride to Stanford, it made Dean proud. They were driving out there to meet with his advisor and get the tour of the school so he wouldn’t be a total fish out of water when he was there attending.
“Can you repair bodies?” Dean asks, cutting Castiel off.
I do not have a beta reader so please forgive any mistakes!
Dean gasps for air and grabs his angel blade, Cas is gripping Dean’s shoulder hard, while simultaneously swiping at the angel in front of them. He’s cursing, and for Dean, everything is moving in slow motion. He forces himself to grip the blade and let go of the seat, making himself stand up straight.
He really was attractive, if Dean lets himself think about it. Cas has a manly jawline, but not one that is so sharp it makes him look like he’s carves out of stone. His jaw is covered in stubble, like no matter how hard he shaves he will always just have a five-o’-clock shadow. There was a small wrinkle in between his brow, something that Dean figured was from how Cas was always so damn confused. Right now, there was hair curling at his temples, and Dean considers how his hair is always so damn messy. He also has full, pink, lips, and although they looked chapped, Dean wonders what it would be like—
He has been running from angels for what feels like days now. He’s been jumping from personal heaven to personal heaven, trying to stay one step ahead. Right now though, he knows he’s messed up. This heaven is a bunch of long corridors that intersect and end in weird places. He’s assuming this person’s heaven involves living in some weird horror mansion. So he’s been running and having to constantly backtrack because he keeps hitting dead ends. More importantly and worrisome, he can’t find the fucking exit.
At least Sam knew he loved him before he died, and that was different, that was brotherly love. This pain? It was so much worse.
Cas groans and tries to force Dean to stand up, and Dean is pulled into what he can only assume is the free-flowing air by Cas' sheer strength of will. He feels the cart rock dangerously under his feet and he feels tears start to prick at his eyes.
Deep down though, Dean felt a strange connection to Cas. Which was a can of worms he wouldn’t even go near and look at.
“She was my superior, but also like my sister. She hated what we were doing to humans, in her eyes it was us harming God’s creation. We angels were made to obey, but you humans were made to
Along the hall were walls lined with doors, and that’s what Dean called the personal heavens or lowercase “h” heavens. They had numbers on them, and initials and Dean would often just run and quickly open the next door and hop into the next heaven. That way he didn’t have to stay in the corridor. It was eerie, uncanny valley type shit. It made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and he just couldn’t stay in there for long. He also knew that if he stayed in that part of Heaven he would be caught by the angels incredibly quickly.
He takes a deep breath and tries to feel the weight of the angel blade in his hand, to get more comfortable with it. He stands firm refusing to let his fear make him go down without a fight. He’s determined to at least try and get away from Castiel because at least that way he can say he went down while fighting.
Cas gives Dean a look, one that says 'You're an idiot'. “I mean, yes, that would be the most logical solution to this predicament. However, the issue is that exit leads directly into the heart of Heaven where a lot of angels reside. It is also heavily guarded, and we would be captured before we even got there.”
“Yeah, or you’re tipping off your rocker.”
Dean ignores the buzzing of his phone and waits for Sam to come.
“There!” Someone shouts from the distance and Cas huffs, grabbing Dean’s arm, he drags him into the crowd and Dean stumbles after him.
“You’re very observant,” Cas replies, leading them to a doorway. They enter into the corridor of Heaven and Dean ignores the creepy feeling that runs up his spine. “Time is… well, for one thing, a human invention so it doesn’t have use up here in Heaven. There is no point in calculating the passage of time for most angels because we are eternal. However, we can manipulate the passage of time up here as well, it doesn’t run the same as it does on Earth because it changes depending on each soul.”
“Please,” Dean hates that he’s resorted to begging, but he sees no other option. “I can’t forget him, he’s all that I have. He’s been the only reason I’ve fought for so damn long and I can’t lose my memories of him.”
He takes a deep breath and watches the lines in Cas’ back. He was walking fast, his posture straight, Dean considers how Cas had shared that he was a soldier and Dean could see it now. The way that he was walking with such a purpose, but also seemed to be on high alert as well.
“I won’t let you fall,” Cas repeats, still with that tenderness in his voice that makes Dean’s stomach twist weirdly. “Do you trust me?”
“I’m essentially carving warding into your soul, kind of like… writing letters in your name. It’s more metaphysical, as in, you won’t be able to see it, but most angels will know what happened. It’ll help hide you from the angels, and at the same time, prevent you from being weakened by the sirens and prevent you from tapping into our communications.
Dean swears he blacks out. “I’m sorry, what?” he chokes out, meeting Cas’ eyes.
Dean glares and shakes his head. “Fuck that noise, what will they even do to you?”
Bobby chuckles, “treat your elders with respect boy,” he says, throwing the ball back towards Dean.
Dean nods and stands up. “Run down the hallway, turn left, up the stairs to the fourth floor, and find your friend.”
He realizes he’s said the wrong thing when Cas’ expression darkens and he glares at Dean. “I will not help you, I will not rebel against Heaven.” Did he seem almost… scared?
Cas gives him a look of utter confusion and disbelief. “Why would our pants be down?”
Dean curses and looks around. “Okay, great, so we basically ran into a trap.”
Dean wakes up on the pavement.
Castiel was the one who was making the lights flicker.
“Instead, I would go see Sammy, I would tell him I’m sorry for calling him a geek. That I love him, because I’ve never actually told him that, and then make sure he’s set up for Stanford. I would sell all my possessions, and make sure that he gets to keep my beautiful 1967 Chevy Impala for the drive to his school. I just need to make sure that he’s set up, and then I would let you take me right back here.
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I can’t fantasize about it.”
“They’re my brothers and sisters Dean. I would rather not harm them,” he responds, meeting Dean’s eyes. “But, we have no choice, the only way I can get you out of here is to fight the ones who start coming for us.”
Castiel sighs and closes his eyes. “Your brother probably doesn’t care that you called him a geek, he probably cares that you’re dead. He is not your problem anymore Dean, it is time to go.”
“I won’t let you fall,” Cas says softly, reassuringly.
He hears screaming and the world collides back into him with the force of semi and oh god, oh god, is Sammy okay? The truck swerved into their lane… and then? Fuck Dean couldn’t remember. That doesn't matter right now though, since he hears his brother’s yelling, and he stands up, barely noticing how weightless he feels, and starts stumbling forward.
Dean nods and swallows as another wave of nausea threatened to cause him to throw up. This pain was different than the pain that he had experienced in the heavens. This was sharper, more intense, unbearable. He’s unsure if he could keep walking with it.
Dean sighs and nods. “Yeah, guess it’s time for us to get a move on. How much time has elapsed on Earth, anyway? For all I know, Sammy could be thirty right now. Time feels weird here.”
Dean doesn't even miss a beat and just nods. "Oh that's great, you don't sleep, so you definitely decided that watching me sleep all night was more fun. Again, dude, that's just fucking creepy," he mutters and ignores how he doesn't feel like his personal privacy has been that violated. He figures it's because once a guy has had his hand in your soul, what other line is there to cross?  Plus, Cas not being able to sleep might be a good thing, since he could keep watch all night and make sure Dean wasn't murdered by angels.
He’s rambling, but he’s trying to buy his time. Maybe if he distracts Castiel enough he can get out of his hold and escape.
Cas freezes and his shoulders almost get straighter, if that was even possible and he turns to face Dean. He’s squinting, but not the squint that Dean has been referring to his confused squint, and it wasn’t his annoyed expression either. This was a look of concern.
“Didn’t Lucifer hate humanity, though?”
“S’okay man,” Dean mutters, forcing his eyes open once more.
“After we managed to subdue the humans, she was imprisoned. She begged me to try and fight because she said she saw a spark in me, she saw my doubt,” he whispers and closes his eyes. “I told her I was not an abomination like her, and that I would never turn my back on the Host. That she deserved to rot in prison because she disobeyed God’s work.”
casually and Dean doesn’t know what to say to that. Instead, he is really grateful that Cas’ eyes are closed so he can’t see the blush that is forming on his face.
Cas is picking him up, carrying him as fast as he can through an office door.
“My specific job as a guardian is to ensure that the soul gets to eternally rest. That is why I clear souls of all memories. It creates a clean slate, like a… freshly charged battery. It makes the soul easier to control because it removes some of the fights that the human had on Earth involving their freedom of choice and their decision making. Moreover, a soul just tends to be calmer when it has happier memories fuelling it. But that is a double-edged sword,” Castiel pauses and looks up at Dean, which Dean assumes is to ensure that Dean is following.
Dean closes his eyes. “Okay, so what’s the plan? Just keep moving until we run into some angels?”
“They went that way!” A voice shouts through the crowd and Dean turns to the sound. People have started moving out of the way of three people walking through the crowd. They were dressed in suits like Cas, but unlike Cas, their suits weren’t rumpled and actually looked like they fit them properly.
“It’s dangerous, to be exposed to that frequency. I should have been more aware of how dangerous it was,” Cas murmurs. “So I am now piecing your soul back together, which is why I am touching you like this. I know you want personal space, but I have to touch you in order to fix this.”
While he sits there trying to figure out what to say, Cas stands up. He sighs and looks to the door, and Dean looks up at him.
He feels it wash over him over and over again, each sob coming out harder, stronger. He hasn’t cried like this in forever. Hell, he thinks the last time he cried like this was when Sam died the very first time. He had been so lost, so broken. This time it felt stronger, more difficult.
Cas nods and gives Dean a sad smile. “That is why I will be imprisoned here in Heaven, and not imprisoned down in the pit. It is a slightly better punishment, not as cruel.”
Cas sighs and sits back. “Done, you’re warded,” he mutters and hands Dean back his shirt. Dean considers how fast Cas got the warding on him versus how long it took to fix the pain that the sirens had caused.
Dean thinks about the injustices occurring in Heaven right now, and how everyone deserved to live in freedom. He thinks about how when Sammy ends up here… he didn’t deserve to lose his memories. Neither did his mother, or Bobby, or Ellen or Jo. They all deserved to be able to live in freedom and live with all their memories intact. He’s willing to help Cas make that a possibility for them.
He chuckles darkly and looks back at Dean, giving him a sad smile. “So, she planted this seed in me, but it never really grew. Instead, I would just hate what I was doing but never could put my finger on why. Then, I was forced to clear your soul. So, Dean, I would have to say that you’re a big reason as to why I am doing this.”
Whenever he exits one personal heaven, he ends up in the capital “H” Heaven as he likes to call it. It’s freaky, the main part of Heaven. It is nothing but hallways, and it almost feels like a hospital. It’s sterile and quiet, with gross fluorescent lights beaming down and doors on either side of the hallways. It echoed, too, and Dean could hear his breathing stretch on throughout the hall.
Cas smirks, and nods. "I am aware, you had a lot of memories about your father," he says and walks to the door, removing the warding. “We should get moving, we will start to be hunted by the angels now, considering that I haven’t come back with you and you’ve been hidden for a few hours. The angels will get suspicious of your whereabouts as well as mine.”
Dean drops the ball, being startled by the voice. "Bobby, are you sure you don't hear that?" he asks, feeling concerned and anxious. He walks around, not hearing what Bobby is saying in response. Instead, he begins to feel like something is off about this park, that it was too clean. Normally, it would smell like dog poop and there would be children crying nearby, but this was a perfect day. No smell of dogs, no children crying, just the sound of kids playing the smell of freshly mowed grass.
“I figured it was the right thing to do,” Cas says softly. “You’re also annoying, and your voice was getting on my nerves and I needed you to stop talking.”
Dean laughs softly, switching the cassette tape in the tape deck. He can't help but catch  Sam’s infectious mood. There was nothing he enjoyed more than driving on the open road with his brother. It was his happy place, and to see Sam so happy after so long of being so sad he couldn’t help but feel the joy bubbling out of him.
He hears a grunt and Cas stabs the angel he had been fighting, forcing the ride to rock dangerously and Dean swallows back yet another scream of terror. "Oh god," he whispers, "oh god I'm going to die... again."
But… on the other hand, Cas was helping him. He was rebelling and risking losing his whole stature and prestige in Heaven. He was in turn being hunted by angels because he was a traitor for protecting Dean. He was helping Dean because he felt bad for him and he wanted him to find his brother. Cas was trying to restore the free will of not only Dean but also of all the other human souls that rested in Heaven. Dean would never have made it even remotely this far if it weren’t for Cas helping him.
“Holy… holy shit, holy shit holy shit holy shit,” Dean says as he tries and catches his breath and looks up at Cas. Cas is gripping the exit handle, the door swung open in the middle of the damn night sky and shining light on his face, one that held a look of complete concentration. Cas is breathing heavy, gripping Dean tightly while trying to pull them through the door.
The hallways of the center of Heaven are long but dreary. Dean considers how they look like corporate offices, but the kind that he’s only seen in movies. He’s too blue-collar to actually have ever stepped foot in a place like this when he was alive.
It's a warm, sunny day. They had decided to go play ball because Dean had gotten caught making out with Jenny in the janitor’s closet and Mr. Pallipan was not impressed. He had called Bobby to get him, and Bobby decided he should do something he probably never really got a chance to. Maybe, in Bobby's words, it would keep Dean from trying to grow up so quickly.
“It’s not the only reason,” Cas says quietly, moving his hand.
Cas gives him a look of utter disbelief. “You’ve said that already,” he sounds out of breath and he’s bleeding from a cut on his side. “Also, I told you I wouldn’t let you fall, you need to trust me better.”
“He told me he’d be waiting for you. That man always waits for you,” Bobby says and smiles. “That’s love, isn’t it?”
“No, but I did bring us straight into the enemy's hands. This is the center of
“It won’t protect you from an angel trying to speak to you using their real voices, and it also won’t protect you from seeing a true form. That, I hope, you will try and avoid,” he mutters, his eyebrows once again furrowed in conversation.
Then he remembers how strange it is that Cas doesn't sleep. "You don't sleep? Like at all?"
Cas nods. “When she told me, I warned her that she should be careful, that it was rebellion to speak this way and commit the acts she was committing. She didn’t heed my warning, and went further than just leaving memories. She went into the human’s heavens and started waking them up one by one. Her idea was that if she woke up enough humans, we would
“All that pain,” Castiel says softly, “all that pain and suffering. You are finally free Dean, you can finally live for yourself and have peace. Don’t you desire that? Don’t you desire to be your own person and not let the people you think you have to take care of defining your worth?”
If he could find the exit, he could find Sammy. He doesn’t know what he’ll do then, but he’ll take it one step at a time. the first part of his plan and the most important though was to get out of this fucking maze of this person’s heaven.
Dean smiles and takes a deep breath. “I think you and I both were confused about our feelings for each other, you know that? I thought you couldn’t possibly feel the way I felt for you, being an angel and all. But fuck Cas, what you want? You can have it,” he closes his eyes and leans in for another kiss.
He hates himself for that. But there was so much happening, how was he supposed to process all that information in one moment? They had such little time, and Dean could barely grasp the fact that it was a goodbye.
Dean, this is real life. I’m gonna join as many clubs as possible, maybe get hired on as a research assistant. That would be cool, to help a professor with their research. That would definitely look good on an application to law school.”
The coaster begins to tilt back as it makes it ascent up the slope and Dean grips the seat. He feels anxiety swallow up his stomach and his heart and he's sure all of his other eternal organs as he is forced to stare up at the sky. He can't move now, he can't pay attention to where the angels were, because without the guardrail he is definitely going to fly out of the ride. Heaven or no heaven, Dean still could feel pain, and he didn't want to feel the pain of falling 200 feet to the ground.
Cas walks over to Dean and then very abruptly presses his fingers to his forehead, while also crowding into Dean’s personal space.
“Okay, so what do you suggest then Mr. Smarty Pants? You clearly don’t want to force me to come with you to get my memories wiped, so what do you suggest I do to get out of here and see my brother? I’ll figure it out myself, but you have to let me go.”
“Cas is here?” Dean whispers, looking at Bobby earnestly. His chest feels tight, which is strange, considering he’s dead. He knows Sammy is carrying on without him, and he prays his brother gets a good life down there. It was really his time, and now Dean, Dean knew that he was in heaven and he could get what he always wished for.
He hears the sound of fluttering, he can’t place it. It feels weird and out of place. He feels more confused. Was this it then? He was stuck to live on this lonely ass stretch of highway? He also feels relief wash through him because he is so grateful that Sam is alive.
“I’m gonna go for a drive,” He says softly to Bobby, putting down the beer and getting up and walking to Baby. She is as beautiful as ever, hell, she looks brand new. Like he had just driven her off the lot. She is really something, the only real constant in his short life on earth. He was glad she could follow him to the afterlife.
“You expect me to just sit here and go with this plan? Just expect you to fucking sacrifice yourself?!” Dean knows he’s close to yelling, but he thinks this plan is a crock of shit. He’s not just going to leave Cas to suffer alone, that’s despicable, after everything he has done for him.
“It’s a compliment, Dean. Your soul is the most beautiful one I have seen in the millennia that I have been existing,” Cas retorts. He says it so
“Very fucking helpful, Cas,” Dean deadpans, he wants to throw his hands up in the air he’s so frustrated, but Cas was still holding them.
He has a weird moment of recollection, as though he’s heard that name before. Maybe he found a book at Bobby’s that talked about Castiel, the angel. Which wasn’t all that far fetched considering all the weird shit Bobby collects in his house.
Dean swallows, and tries to open his mouth to speak. He needs to be strong, he needs to hold on for Sammy, for Jack, for the
It was strange, but Dean feels like he is missing something important. The sun flashes in his eyes again, and he blinks, hearing the sound of his name being screamed in desperation, and he remembers the sound of crunching metal.
The room is too warm, and Dean is starting to feel like he needs to crawl out of his skin and get the hell out of here. He wonders if it’s a side effect from the angel mumbo jumbo that Cas is currently doing to him. Or if it is the side effect of his own heart pounding in his ears and his mind trying to only focus on how close he and Cas were.
Then his phone starts ringing.
“I don’t care Sammy. I don’t care because the Empty took him, and he told me his true happiness was something he knew he couldn’t have and then he told me he loved me and I didn’t say it back Sam!” He screams into the phone. “I didn’t say it back because so much was happening and I couldn’t process that he was saying goodbye to me and now he’s gone Sam. He’s gone and he doesn’t know I love him!”
They sit in silence for a while after that, Cas’ breathing even and steady.
and cared for, something that he had been so desperately lacking. This was true joy to Dean, something he would cherish for the rest of his life.
These offices were different from the hallway he stumbled into when he was jumping from heaven to heaven. Instead, there was soft music playing over speakers that Dean couldn’t see, with flat, plain, grey carpet that made the hallways seem smaller. The walls were not white, but they weren’t beige either. They were that colour that sits in the in-between that every cheap apartment had. Along the halls were doors, but these were marked with numbers. Right now they were passing doors: 2-887 and Dean wondered vaguely wondered what was inside them.
“If I let you go,” Cas says, his voice firm. “It will disrupt the entire fabric of not only Heaven but humanity as well.”
all he could hear were the last words Cas would ever speak to him. He could only think about how he never got to tell Cas that he loved him too.
“Then I would find my body.”
The last couple that he’s run into he’s managed to take down. He thinks it’s sheer luck that he managed to do that, and he also assumes it’s because they were considered low tier angels. Or “guardians of the doors” as they call themselves. He’s managed to kill six so far, all of which were trying to capture him and take him who knows where. They also all had warned him that the angel that would find him would be very different, that it was one of the higher-ranking angels. Not as strong as an archangel, but strong enough that it would be Dean’s maker.
“Why are you turning your back on the Host in the first place? I mean, I know I’m persuasive, and charming, and pretty good looking but you can’t have done this for just me, man,” Dean says and crosses his arms like a petulant child.
Cas shakes his head, and runs a hand through his already messy hair, and stands up. He seems a little shaky but he looks at Dean. “Do you need help up? You seem pretty scared still.”
“Dean wait…”
Cas rolls his eyes for the hundredth time and goes back to pressing his palm against Dean’s chest.
"Oh god, I'm going to be sick," Dean mutters but forces himself to stay upright.
Cas furrows his eyebrows and looks over at Dean, pausing in his determined walk through the crowds of people. He lets go of Dean's arm and makes sure that they hold eye contact. “What do you mean? This is the easiest one to get to, and we don’t have that much time, why would we go through another one?”
It is slow and blissful and beautiful. How many times had he dreamed of this? Of soft “I love you” being whispered into each other’s skin. Of hushed groans, and grunts, and soft touches and lips trailing everywhere they could reach.
When they’re done, the Impala’s windows are fogged up, and Cas has his head resting on Dean’s chest. Dean is running his fingers through his hair, trailing his other hand over his shoulder.
When Dean comes to, it’s still with that fucking migraine.
“Well that’s bullshit,” Dean responds. “You have to wipe our memories, keep us docile, so we can power the heavenly host and then… what? It seems like a load of shit to me, like something just doesn’t add up.”
It’s like a burst of sheer energy like electricity is soaring through his head. He can’t even focus on keeping himself conscious.
Cas nods and takes a deep breath through his nose, closing his eyes again. He leans his head back revealing the long line of his neck and
Sam is silent, and he can hear his deep breaths. “Dean… Dean, you have to keep it together man, we don’t have time for this.”
“This wasn’t the ending I wanted for you Dean,” he whispers. “You deserved to live a full life, one with your dog Miracle, and Sam living a few blocks away. You deserved to have children, and a wife, and everything you convinced me to fight for. You deserved a fam-“
Dean smiles and nods, following Castiel back out of the maze of halls he originally got lost in. He feels like something monumental just happened, and he can’t put words to it.
He instead focuses on the plan, and that is to get out of Heaven and find his brother.
They were so fucked, because Dean was too goddamn human.
“You call being forced to forget my memories and live in some constant loop, freedom? Maybe I don’t have to worry about taking care of my family, and maybe that is a big amount of freedom I thought I could never dream of. But that’s not
“Where the fuck are all the angels?” he asks instead, pushing Cas’ hand off his forehead and looking down either side of the hall. “This place should be swarming with them, right?”
Dean nods and gestures for Cas to keep going.
Dean had been working extra shifts at the garage to save up enough money for this. It was the first time in a very long time that they had left Sioux Falls. Not since John died and family services dropped them off at Bobby’s door. There was something special about this drive reminding Dean of a simpler time when he was able to shield Sammy from the rest of the world.
He shrugs, looking back at the road. There are headlights heading toward them on the two-lane highway. He turns off the high beams of the Impala so he doesn’t blind the driver. He tries to ignore how they haven’t though and squints into the oncoming traffic.
He shifts his stance and gives Castiel a look. One that says, “try me” and winks.
Dean laughs softly and shakes his head, shrugging off the sound. “Okay, maybe I’m just tired, you never know. Could also mean I have a sound brain, ever thought of that Bobby?”
The man laughs and shakes his head. “No, I am an angel of the Lord. I am here to take you to your final resting place.”
The road stretched out in front of them, long and dark, with nothing but opportunity for his little brother.
Cas bites his lip and nods. “Yes, but the issue is that there are many exits… and I am unsure of which one we should take...”
He hears the flutter of wings and smiles. “Took you long enough,” he says, and turns his head slightly to look over at Cas.
Did he trust Cas?
Cas opens the door and walks out, his back taut. He is clearly on high alert, Dean admires that, maybe Cas was right and angels were actually soldiers. Which was strange to Dean, all things considering. What was the need for fighting if the only thing you had to subdue was human souls?
He sees a shadow step around the corner, and he stands up straighter. He glares at the angel, and from what he can see it is a man, wearing a long, tan trench coat and an oversize suit jacket underneath. He has a blue tie but it’s askew, and his hair is messy. Dean isn’t sure if he can accurately guess the expression of the angel’s face, but it’s not one of anger, instead, it looks like annoyance.
The sun flashes in his eyes and he nearly misses catching the ball again, he frowns, looking around, feeling like something is missing. His brain is firing of the sound of a semi horn and he glares, confused since they were nowhere near a highway.
“Human souls are quite powerful,” Cas says, simply, like it was a well-known fact. “They are created by God, but they are given something unique compared to angels, your free will. Your soul is much more powerful than my grace. It is concentrated energy and it can be used to run celestial plains, and give certain celestial beings power. The more souls a place has, the more powerful it is, and the better it runs.
changed
“Why did you stop moving? What's wrong?”
Cas frowns and tilts his head. “No,” he says, confusion in his voice, “we are not human creations. We are creations by God, his warriors.” He says it so matter-of-fact that Dean smiles and can’t help but snicker.
Then from the opposite direction, they heard more shouting and more footsteps and Dean realizes that the angels have cornered them in. He looks back at Cas with wide eyes, meeting the angel's blue eyes, and tries to get his hearing and breathing back. He personally, thinks it would be much better to face the angels head-on rather than go on that rollercoaster. Which is suicidal, but in his mind, it is more suicidal to try and go on that death trap.
He frowns and presses his thumb into Dean’s temple, it’s not hard, just a firm touch.
Cas is still gripping Dean’s shoulder, and Dean is currently screaming as his life depends on it. He feels the air rushing around him and sees the ground get closer as they plummet.
“I’m not done yet,” Cas says through gritted teeth, and Dean frowns. He doesn’t question it, but stops trying to fight him and forces himself to think about other things. Like how the hell they were going to get out of the mess they currently were in.
He looks around the scrapyard, and then back at Bobby. “Sorry Bobby, I must have started daydreaming there!” He shouts back and throws the ball, laughing.
"Cas," Dean says, his voice going higher the more anxious he becomes. He's watching as two angels climb up the side, seemingly effortless, and also very fast. "Can't you just use your angel powers and like teleport us to the door?"
The presence is looming closer, and Dean feels his breathing start to speed up. He turns a corner and meets another dead-end, he looks around, trying to see if he has enough time to backtrack. He can’t gauge how close the angel is, but he’s sure that it’s entering the hallway that he just ran through. The power the angel was giving off was enough to tell Dean how close it truly was.
"Whatever," Dean says and stands up, grabbing his jacket off the headboard of the bed. "Did you sleep at all last night? Or did you decide that watching me was the most fun activity you could do?"
He feels the world around him start to tunnel into silence, with the roaring of blood in his ears getting so loud. He looks back at Cas, trying to keep the panic from entering his voice. “Is there...” he swallows when his voice shakes, “Is there another exit?”
His plan is to try and find a heaven that will lead him to an exit. He figures it’s probably flawed, but he’s sure each heaven will lead him closer to what the angels called “the center of Heaven” and that’s where the exit clearly was.
“I won’t let you fall,” Cas repeats, still with that tenderness in his voice that makes Dean’s stomach twist weirdly. “Do you trust me?”
“I know,” Cas says. “I have questions, I have doubts. I question why I should have to stifle souls as marvelous as yours, but it is my duty to follow orders. Well, now it’s not, but that is an angel’s job. To take orders and do as they are told. To be a soldier.”
“That was in a
“Yeah, sure,” Dean says sarcastically and grips the angel blade tighter in his hand, “I’m not buying that. If you come any closer I will stab you.”
Dean frowns. “Why do you keep insulting me? Also, helping me because I annoyed you is not a good reason.”
“So, what are you then? You’re not a robot, you’re not Jesus…” Dean points at him, “which by the way was another joke. So what would you classify yourself?”
Dean chuckles, “you know… that sounds a lot like what my father used to say to me. Be a good soldier, take care of Sammy, stop asking questions,” he mutters.
There was the sound of kids playing nearby and Dean could feel happiness bubbling in his chest. This was fun, he never really got to experience this with John, because John was too drunk to even look at Dean half the time. This made him feel
Dean shakes his head. “Cas was my best friend Sam,” he whispers. “He was my best friend, and I think I’ve loved him for at least ten of the eleven damn years we’ve fought together…” his eyes filled with tears. “And at least Eileen knew you loved her.”
After what feels like too long, Cas pulls back, giving a deep sigh and leaning back against the wall. Dean sits up and faces him. He looks exhausted, like doing that took a huge amount of strength, and Dean wonders if that’s why he was being so damn grumpy.
Dean frowns, still confused as shit. “What does that even mean?”
“Hello, Dean.” A deep, gravelly voice says behind him and Dean jumps, turning around.
Cas snorts and shakes his head. “No, just a powerful and determined angel,” he mutters and looks around. “Come on, we need to get moving. We’re in the center now, which means angels are definitely tailing us. I need to find a place where we can ward ourselves in and I can figure out how to get to where I can restore your body and send you back.”
His eyes are a shocking blue and Dean feels the words he was about to say fall from his brain, he was too stunned to say anything. The man looks annoyed, frustrated even, and Dean furrows his brow.
Dean doesn’t pause when Cas gets them out of the way and he bolts through the door, he doesn’t pay attention to the angel’s shouts. He doesn’t turn at the light flashing behind him.
He gives Sam the side-eye and chuckles at Sam’s look of disapproval. “In what world is jumping off a balcony fun?” Sam deadpans, his voice disapproving but also teasing.
He manages to graze Castiel’s arm while evading Castiel trying to grab him by the arms to pin him. Dean wishes he hadn’t been backed into a wall because it makes the fight that much harder.
It plays in Dean’s mind on a loop, and he looks around the room, starting to come to his senses. He can’t get up, he can’t move. He holds his head in his hands, and begins to sob.
“It’s not that simple Dean, we can’t just overthrow the structure of Heaven. There are rules that must be followed, and I am unsure how to do it. We would need to get the help of an archangel… but we risk another war like the one with Lucifer. Angels won’t be as easily persuaded as you have persuaded me,” Cas says, but although he sounds reluctant, he doesn’t sound like he’s against the plan.
“Stop avoiding the question, I figure since I’m letting you walk into imprisonment you should at least tell me why you are so willing to be imprisoned.”
Then the rollercoaster stops altogether and Dean whimpers. The air is whistling through his hair, in the distance, he can hear waves crashing over the ocean, and as he looks, he can see the entirety of the fair.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
Castiel drops Dean’s wrists and shoves his hands in his pockets. He starts fidgeting and Dean frowns but doesn’t try to run. Cas was right, there was no way he was getting out of here without help, and Cas seems like he’s willing to help.
Cas runs a hand through his messy hair, and Dean thinks about how the motion is incredibly human.
Not to mention that with this rollercoaster they would have to get out at the very top, which to Dean seemed well over 150 feet in the air. He also can’t help but think about how they were probably also going to have to fight angels on their way up to the door and through the exit. There’s no way that he would be able to handle that kind of height and pressure.
Cas furrows his brow and gives Dean a look, one that clearly tells him to shut the fuck up.
Dean considers that for a moment. “Mainly my head, but my shoulder and back are also killing me. My main concern is the migraine I’m feeling though.”
“Isn’t that a good thing?” Dean asks, “considering there are so many souls here, shouldn’t I just blend in?”
Cas makes a non-committal sound in the back of his throat. “Don’t worry about it, although the fighting is annoying, it is not bad.”
Castiel furrows his brows in confusion, and steps back slightly, still pinning Dean by his wrists and shoulder. “That’s odd, most humans don’t remember me at all. I am Castiel, an angel of the lord, clearer of the souls. You know me Dean because I regrettably was the one who brought you to Heaven from Earth and removed your memories.”
Dean always was independent, and he always figured out shit on his own. He would figure this one out, too.
“Just fucking hear me out for a second,” Dean says angrily and meets Castiel’s gaze once more. “If you got me out… I wouldn’t try and live on Earth,” he says and he means it. “What’s dead should stay dead and that includes me.
“Uh… so… I’m not exactly a fan of heights…”
“Your observation was actually quite perceptive,” Cas says, and Dean basks in the satisfaction of feeling smart for once. “Which is not the norm for you, but you’re right, we should have been approached by a few angels by now.”
Dean realizes that was a sore spot because Cas flinches, and glares at Dean. Dean realizes that he’s implying Cas should rebel and fall like Lucifer to help. Which… he kind of was if Dean was being completely honest with himself.
The world shimmers around him and Dean is standing on an empty road. There is no sign of the Impala and no sign of Sam. "Sammy?" he calls out into the darkness, and he begins running, "Sammy!" he screams.
“Not to mention that this heaven is also heavily watched, considering how many souls are here. That means there are tons of guardians outside the doors but also within the limits. Otherwise it would be very difficult to keep these souls docile and asleep. This fair is an incredible power source, and from what I can sense, the door we entered through is now blocked off.”
Taking a sip of water, he rubs at his hands. They were still tingling from the power of Dean’s soul. He wondered how long that feeling would last for him.
Then Dean starts looking around and his eyes widen. They’re standing in a giant amusement park, in the evening because he can see the sun setting over what appears to be the ocean. Around them, there are shining lights, a huge Ferris wheel, rollercoasters, food stands, and so many people running around.
Cas squints and tilts his head slightly, “I am also not Jesus,” he responds, the confusion in his voice becoming that much more prevalent.
Cas rolls his eyes and frowns. “You’re insufferable, give me a moment to try and help work out what is causing your headache.”
The man shrugs, and a look crosses his face that looks like annoyance, but it is quickly schooled into a neutral expression. “You can’t help him anymore, Dean," he says, "your vessel is destroyed, you are merely a soul now."
“You didn’t answer my question, by the way,” Dean says, looking off at the door. “Why are you rebelling, because it can’t just be for me.”
Cas walks to the door and scrubs off the warding, the second he opens the door, ten angels swarm them. Cas is fast, he’s strong too, and he starts pushing them back. Cutting at them with his angel blade and throwing punches.
He swallows back a lump in his throat, the memories bringing up discomfort. His job was always to take care of Sammy, it was all he knew how to do. His brother was the only person he had for so long, even when John was alive. If it weren’t for Sammy, Dean would have never gotten his GED and started working at the garage full time. He was determined to put that kid through school and make sure he becomes some hotshot lawyer.
Dean assumes the last question is rhetorical because he has no answer to that.
He thrusts the angel blade forward right into the angel’s throat, closing his eyes against the flash of light that erupts from the wound and the angel's eyes and mouth. The sound is loud enough that Dean is certain he was going to go deaf.
“Then you can do whatever you want to me. You can erase my memories again, or you could send me to hell. I don’t care, but please just help me get back to my brother. I promise you I won’t cause any problems after that,” Dean finishes. He says each word with conviction because he truly means them.
Cas gives him a sad smile and nods. “You’re surprisingly smart for a human,” he says, giving Dean one more backhanded compliment. “Please find your brother, and don’t worry about me.”
“I’m doing it, and I lost Eileen, you
Castiel sighs, and tilts his head up, looking up at the ceiling. Then he looks back directly at Dean, and steps closer. “This does not need to turn into a fight, one which you will lose. Just please come peacefully with me.”
“So? Some things need to be disrupted Cas, it’s just part of the natural order of things. There would be no heaven and hell if Lucifer hadn’t rebelled right?”
“I saw it in a movie once. Seemed pretty fun for them.”
“So… you’re doing this for her?”
“Hey, Dean watch out!” Bobby shouts, and Dean catches the ball and blinks.
Dean laughs. “Woah easy tiger, you’re not even in your first year yet.”
Dean, it shouldn’t be this easy to get to my office. We should be fighting angels every step of the way because there is nowhere here that they can’t find us. I was just banking on us being one step ahead of them, and managing to avoid most of them by moving quickly, which, as I stated earlier is not happening because you are slow.”
“Dean?!” Sam shouts, panicked and Dean closes his eyes. “What the hell?! I’ve been calling you for over an hour, what the hell is going on!? Are you and Castiel alright?!”
Sam takes a deep breath. “Jack and I are coming, okay? We’ll be at the bunker, you need to snap out of this Dean. We have a world to save.”
Cas has a soft look in his eyes, it’s also a look that is filled with sadness.
Castiel meets Dean’s eyes and they hold eye contact for what feels like far too long. It’s intense, but Dean refuses to break. He is determined to make Castiel see that what is happening here is not right and that Dean deserves his freedom.
Cas sighs and Dean is starting to get really fed up with how easily the angel seems to get annoyed with him. It’s not like Dean can fully comprehend such confusing and broad topics about the concept of Heaven. Especially because Dean didn’t even believe there was a Heaven before he died.
He stops the car and parks it, turning to face Cas fully. “Oh? Why?” he can’t help the small smile that is spreading on his face, and he reaches out, gingerly taking Cas’ hand. It’s calloused but beautiful, and he thinks about how he wanted to desperately do that for so long.
Dean frowns and looks down at himself. He felt completely real, what was this man getting at? That he was just a soul?
which was only something God did. So in her eyes, you are basically God, and taking away the memories humans created was blasphemy.
Cas shakes his head. “Your shirt is kind of like armour over your soul, just like how clothes on Earth protect your skin. I can access your soul through your shirt, but it would be easier if I could just have direct contact. To you, everything looks physical, but for me, everything is waves of energy.”
As suddenly as the noise started, it stops and Dean tries to catch his breath. He slowly opens his eyes, meeting worried blue ones. Dean looks around the room, or tries, barely able to stop it from spinning. He notices what looks like blood in squiggly lines all over the door to the office and he coughs.
Dean doesn't say anything, he just looks at Cas expectantly, waiting for his answer.
He was used to feeling slightly mournful at removing any soul’s memory, but Dean’s hit even harder. It probably didn’t help that Castiel had to go down to earth and fetch him, something an angel of a lower pay grade should have done. But since Zachariah had cut down on the Reaper budget to improve productivity, he was forced to do the dirty work.
“Sammy?!” He shouts, running forward, feeling panic rush through him. He runs up to Baby, trying to see if Sam is still inside. Maybe he was being irrational since he could hear his brother’s voice, but god, this was a bad accident. There was no way that the kind of hit wouldn’t result in some casualties.
He chuckled at that, remembering Anna’s words.
Dean shrugs, smirking, “I figure I’m already dead, might as well take my chances,” he goads. He knows that this is just bravado and that he really was in hot water.
“I have no clue what the hell you’re saying,” Dean says and can’t help but smile at Cas’ annoyed huff. He leans back and takes off his flannel and Henley. “Okay,” he says, ignoring how he feels incredibly naked at sitting in front of Cas shirtless, “have at ‘er.”
“I wasn’t lying to you, or making a joke when I said that your soul is incredibly powerful. Think of holding a human soul like holding a small sun, some burn brighter and hotter. Now imagine trying to grab the solar flares of that sun while holding it. That’s what putting your soul back together was like, and you always seem to fight me along the way,” he murmurs.
