But he still has to ask. And he knows what Cas will say before he even says it. There is something in the flex of his jaw, something in the look in his eye. Something in the way Cas’ hand flinches, for just a second. As if he means to reach out and holds himself back at the last second.
“No. Joshua tried to push reaching out to European and African nations a while back. It didn’t end well, and Delphine got stuck on this side. She’s been here since she was sixteen.”
It’s everything Dean can do not to yell. Every hunter he knows in this part of the country is too far away to get to Claire quickly enough to help her. He could find Patience or Alex in Jody’s contacts and he’s sure they would head out to help Claire, but he doesn’t know what he’d be sending them into. Patience won’t be checking her phone in class, and Alex won’t have her phone on her until her shift is done, anyway. He’s only seeing one option here, and it’s pretty fucking grim. Still, he sends a message to everyone’s phone, Claire and Kaia included, explaining exactly what he heard over the call, and hoping someone gets on it ASAP.
“Kelly Kline is incredibly dangerous, no matter how she looks,” said Mary. “Do you know why they weren’t feeding her? Because they were afraid if they did she might find a way to overpower them. She is the result of intense experimentation about the limits of the human body and the human psyche, and if you knew the half of what she could do if let out into the world…”
“You said it, not me,” Sam mutters. Dean grimaces, but doesn’t make a deal out of it. Likely he knows his best shot at getting Sam to stop worrying is not to get into it and tear out his stitches in the process. Or maybe he’s just tired from whatever they’re giving him, and doesn’t feel like working himself up about it. Either way, Sam knows Dean isn’t going to agree to as much recovery time as he’ll actually need. He’ll want to be up and out there again in no time, despite the fact he very much is not twenty six anymore. As soon as he can walk around on his own, he’ll be itching to take on another hunt.
Benny and Jo had to attend an emergency late night meeting, and Sam was likely there too. The door at the end of the hall by the stairs was still closed, and Castiel hadn’t bothered it. He wasn’t in the business of discovering secrets anymore, and despite evidence to the contrary, he did know when to leave well enough alone.
“Then the suicide mission,” said Cas. “All these blankets over my eyes and I just didn’t want to feel like this anymore. So I shot Anna, and then I tried to shoot you. But I couldn’t. You knew I couldn’t.”
On the one hand, Castiel was frustrated with his instructions and their seeming futility. On the other, Naomi might soon realize he was entirely the wrong man for the job she had given him and kill him, so there was that to look forward to.
It’s like someone took a brick to his face. He stops moving, stops struggling, stops thinking. It’s Cas. The inflection, the fond fucking upturn of his voice, every bit of it is as familiar as the back of Dean’s hand, and for a moment he’s so happy nothing else really matters. He hoped maybe he was right but he didn’t know, and oh fuck he has no idea what he’s going to say and…
“Yeah, is cocaine boy really God? Because I have multiple problems with that,” says Kaia. “I can alphabetize them.”
Jack closes his eyes, trying to hold in angry tears. An atomic kid ready to blow any second, and Dean doesn’t know how to stop it. Doesn’t know if he has the words to defuse the bomb building inside Jack. All he can do is keep talking, keep hoping, keep being in the moment and believing it’s not his last. If not for himself, for Claire and Cas. For Sam and Eileen and Patience, and hell even Amara. For everyone else.
By the time he’s worked through his momentary internal crisis, the news has moved on. Dean looks back at Sam, who is laughing at some joke or other in the French new wave movie (or some joke Eileen texted him about the French new wave movie). So he didn’t notice, Dean guesses. Good.
“And you got angry,” says Cas. Jack contemplates this with growing horror. “Unfortunately for you, your emotions tended to have something of a… physical manifestation.”
Lydia wasn’t quite so gifted, but she also exuded a sense of belonging to the environment that Castiel tried to mimic. His method of hiding was usually to stay to the shadows and avoid being seen rather than to act so innocuous that no one took notice. He could definitely see the merit in the latter.
Cas reached out to Dean instead, pulling him close. His hand rested on the back of Dean’s head, his fingernails digging into Dean’s scalp. It was meant to be gentle and soothing, and Cas released a sigh of relief when Dean relaxed against him, his head now buried at the side of Cas’ neck.
It was a twenty minute walk to the edge of town. On either side of the border that was lined with bombs were soldiers under Zachariah’s command and the men and women whose loyalty lay with Dean. Castiel spotted many familiar faces, including Sam, Jo, and Selma. Not one of the people present was in any way related to Sanctus, and Castiel supposed that helped sell the story that Sanctus was an unwilling host to their presence.
Somehow, Castiel doubted Azazel would have an issue sending soldiers to kill the both of them, even if he still wasn’t sure whether he wanted to take Naomi’s side in the war. He wouldn’t even have to risk attacking the resistance outright. Just send the right whispers to the right places, and Castiel knew more than one person that would tie him up and hand him over for slaughter. Gordon would do something like that with a grin on his face.
And with that she turned away from Cas, curling up in her mattress. Cas went back to staring at the ceiling, quietly contemplating what Charlie had said.
“Alright, you got all that?” said Risa, after having gone through an exhaustive list of ways in which they could embarrass her, some of which had examples so specific that Castiel had a strong feeling they had happened before. Trisha looked like she was trying a little too hard to be innocent, as well. “Great. Food’s down the hall. Cas?”
“I know,” says Cas. He glances at Dean and then very casually puts his hand down on the table facing up. Dean takes it. “And about the other thing… Bobby and Mary, would they mind? That you like men?”
“Me neither,” Rosali said, nonchalant as you please. When she saw the surprised look on Cas’ face, she elaborated. “Like I said, I’m not interested.”
“There’s a certain Slant of light— Winter Afternoons— That oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes,” reads Castiel softly. “It makes me feel sad.”
“Last time I left you in a room alone, you ditched me,” said Dean, his eyes still closed. “Someone has to make sure you don’t go off to do something stupid.”
Then again, he wasn’t quite so swayed into thinking along the resistance’s side. As far as he could tell, their plan was to tear down the system’s in place without a thought for how they should be replaced or what values should influence a new system aside from the all too complicated and vague concept of freedom. They wanted out from under the state’s thumb, but what could be expected after that? A military state under Mary Winchester? And who was going to be punished for the crimes of the state? When the power swung, the bloodthirsty would cry out. Did men and women that Castiel had worked with, who honestly thought they were defending the people of the state, deserve the vitriol that would be directed towards them?
“We’re still locked out from communicating with them,” said Charlie. “Jesse and Cesar were good guys. I can’t see them just… closing off Libidine like this.”
He was still lost in thought when he ran right into Harriet, who was walking down the hall toward where Cas had just left. Garth had gone home for the night, and Cas passed this along to Harriet.
Waiting for news of what had happened in Invidia while planning a full scale invasion of Naomi’s headquarters to happen ahead of the planned resistance invasion had not done wonders for Castiel’s sleeping schedule. Jo had taken to offering him sleeping pills and more than once tore him away from planning with Gabriel and Kali to force him to eat. Meanwhile, she roamed the streets and found those she knew to be sympathetic to the resistance cause and with access to soldiers (who had to be housed in some civilian homes due to the influx of garrisons to Superbia). If all went well, a large portion of the army would be somewhat softened towards Castiel’s point of view, or at least willing to consider it.
Dean doesn’t know what to do with that. He knows he should be fighting but he can’t muster the energy. He’s tired.
Amara considers this warily, her eyes flitting between Sam and Dean. Which is fair enough considering they made up a plan that nearly got her killed last time around and conveniently forgot to mention the getting killed part. Something Sam does feel bad about, for the record. If there is a record anymore? It’s odd to be free of that silent eye watching, malevolent or benevolent. Sam’s not really sure who he is without it. But there’s no time to get into that now.
“Three weeks,” said Dean. “Or we might let you off with good behavior if you help your grandparents clean out the storage room this weekend.”
“And what’s the point if Azazel continues trying to kill all of us?” pointed out Mary. “I’m responsible for everyone, do you boys understand that? I have to go to the funerals of the people who die and tell their loved ones that I’m sorry for their loss and know every second that if I did something different, they might still be alive. We need this ceasefire.”
“If it isn’t Mary Winchester Jr.,” said Zachariah. “You really are an incessant thorn in my side, are you aware of that?”
“They said the same thing about you,” she says. There’s a moment where Mary can feel the both of them sizing each other up. She feels like she’s passed a kind of test when Tasha smiles at her. She nods back at her, understanding. There is always a kind of kinship in being a mother, even if Mary’s experience with motherhood isn’t exactly traditional. Then again, she suspects Tasha wasn’t exactly a housewife either, and unlike Mary she did that on purpose. “So do you know?”
Launching himself out of the door, Dean makes a break for the treeline where he sees the slight motion of someone who has quickly hidden themselves. He doesn’t move from his hiding spot until Dean is a good ten feet away, and then Kevin Tran’s head pokes out from behind the bushes.
Castiel did his best to keep his nausea at bay. Two lives he thought to himself. Two lives he’d taken ever, and this time he hadn’t even hesitated.
“And that right there is what I’m talking about,” said Benny. “Your life is worth something in the same way everyone else’s is. People who are better and worse than you. My best friend in the world cares a hell of a lot whether or not you’re breathing. I tend to trust his judgment on things like that. I know you behaved the way you did today because Dean was in danger and you’re hardwired to feed off paranoia. Especially considering what I know you went through at Nowhere Pass. I’m not blaming you for that. I’m asking you to consider what you do next, now that you’ve got the chance to make a decision when you’re not so panicked you can’t see straight. Because if I’m right about you, your head has gone one of two places. The first of which I won’t mention out of politeness.”
Cas pointed to the thick beard he had been growing over the past few weeks, and his longer than normal hair. He’d been planning for this argument as soon as they had started getting reports of bands of ex-soldiers wandering the desert to turn away refugees.
That was probably true. Or at least would be if Castiel had any practice being able to identify these types of relationships. He had assumed, upon his initial realization that Charlie and Jo were sexually involved that they were also in a relationship. It had only become obvious that that wasn’t the case when Jo had attempted to proposition him. Jo had been sure not to mention that to anyone and Castiel had done likewise, however.
“There’s some expression about a pot and a kettle that comes to mind with that one,” said Benny. Cas pressed down harder. “Is this what gratitude looks like from you?”
Dean nodded and then walked off to the elevators, shoulders looking as though they were slumping under sudden weight, and Cas tried not to think about how much of that weight he put there by placing Emma in danger.
Dean wakes up feeling like he’s too nauseous to actually hack anything up. The last few hours are fuzzy, but he vaguely remembers he’s supposed to be doing something. Something important. He tries to open his eyes, but there’s something heavy and rough draped over them, keeping him in the dark. When he tries to move, he realizes his hands are tied behind him around some kind of support beam. He struggles to claw his way back to proper functioning, but his thoughts are sluggish and incoherent, and every muscle in his body aches, and he can’t quite put together what’s going on-
Someone clears their throat. Dean nearly jumps out of his skin when he turns and sees Billie sitting on a dark purple velvet settee. Her finger rests between the pages of a copy of MacBeth, and she smiles at Dean with an amused malice. He stares back at her, itching to run.
“Not a compliment,” Jo said, though she nudged his arm with a degree of affection. “If anyone can do it, though, he can.”
“My name is Duma,” she said clearly. “Welcome to Nowhere Pass. Prepare yourself to meet the supreme leader.”
“Curfew is in ten minutes,” Charlie called after him. Cas didn’t look back as he slammed open the door. He was a little surprised to see Dorothy on the other side, who jumped back two feet when the door swung past her. They looked each other in the eye for a moment before Cas watched past her. Let her spy on him. Fuck them all, anyway.
Castiel was bouncing off the walls as more days passed. Dr. Newman started to give him a modicum more freedom of when he could move about and suggested basic exercises that Castiel could do to begin to get his strength back (but also left strict instructions not to overwork himself).
Selma, apparently didn’t think gambling was good for the soul, and just liked to watch. Or that was what she told Castiel when he sat next to her.
Scenario after scenario runs through Patience’s head, ranging from catastrophic to horrible to manageable to completely fine and back again based on the smallest of variations in an infinite number of variables. She snaps at Claire at one point not to put sugar in the coffee she’s making for herself, and Claire just stares at her before putting the box away. One choice ripples through the visions, and Patience groans, leaning forward as her pulse pounds against her forehead.
Dean followed her shortly, letting out a little yelp of surprise when his foot sunk into the floor. Stifling a snort, Claire took another step forward, and then another. The blackness didn’t lessen, but Claire continued to walk straight, assuming they had to find something at some point. Dean followed behind, keeping close to Claire’s side. It was reassuring, knowing he was there and Claire was infinitely grateful she did not have to make this journey alone. She wasn't sure she would have been brave enough without her dad standing behind her, ready to follow her lead.
Cas recoils at the accusation. Dean isn’t sure whether or not he means it, he just knows there’s a pit of something dark and ugly that has been building inside him so long. He guesses Cas is just the lucky guy who gets to hear it all. He’s not even sure what he’s saying after a while, he just knows that Cas’ expression grows more and more thunderous and by the time he’s done, Cas has gotten out of the car and slammed the door behind him as hard as he could. Dean sits dumbfounded for a while before getting out himself.
It wasn’t long until he ran into Sam, who was also helping people. He looked less affected than even Castiel did, and even in the middle of the urgency Castiel now felt he took note of it. Hallucinations didn’t much slow down Sam Winchester.
“What changed?” Castiel asked. A bit of the mirth left Gabriel’s expression, and for a moment his face fell into a quiet rage.
“There wasn’t a rescue mission,” said the woman, though she sounded far less confident now. “There’s been no movement into the city since Naomi’s offer.”
“Did Sam tell everyone to watch me?” asked Cas, because Naomi or not, there was something in him that was hardwired not to accept anything nice in his life. Charlie was his friend, of course. But she was more Sam’s and Dean’s than she would ever be his, and that meant she would lie to his face if it meant keeping them safe.
The first round would be a sober attempt to match Selma’s terrifying accuracy, which no one had managed to even come close to. After that, Selma would ensure that no one injured themselves as the rest of them became increasingly intoxicated and competitive. Castiel had offered on more than one occasion to join her in sobriety and assist with keeping everyone in check, but she always waved him off and told him she was glad he was having fun.
Castiel was incredibly confused as to just what was happening, or why Jo looked like she wanted to cry. He only got more confused when Jo unzipped his coat and pushed it off his shoulders before doing the same thing to hers. She was standing to close to him and Castiel was confused and had no idea what to do or what was happening. Why did Jo look like she wanted to cry?
“How do we know it’s not a bomb? Or a tracking device?” asked Krissy, still stubbornly suspicious of him. Cas growled in frustration.
“Well I guess that just leaves one question,” says Billie. She prods Dean’s side with the blunt end of her scythe, causing him to groan in pain. It is all Cas can do to keep himself from snapping at her. He needs Billie for now. As long as she can heal Dean, he will hold his tongue. So he lets Billie frown down at Dean, watches as the love of his very long life looks back up at Death, defiant as ever. “Do you want to live?”
Naomi knew he was coming, and Castiel knew Naomi knew he was coming. That had been the trade off for sending secret messages among the soldiers. Since Naomi knew they were coming, her headquarters had unsurprisingly been fortified even further than it had originally been. Because of this, the plan was to draw as many soldiers as possible out with a distraction led by Jo. Then they would make their way in via a side entrance and a series of spies that Kali had been in communication with. Once Castiel was through Naomi’s door, all he had to do was point a gun in her direction and ask for access to the citywide communication system at her disposal. Simple.
“You’re going to pay for that,” he said simply. Michael had never before been afraid of his little brother, and he wasn’t going to start now.
‘Death says no more second chances,’ Eileen signs. ‘Bad development when your boyfriend’s hobby is dying repeatedly.’
Cas turned around to see Dean and Jo wearing very similar expressions. Both seemed amused to have caught him off guard speaking to Balthazar. Clearing his throat, Castiel introduced them, realizing he had yet to explain who was who.
Even convincing resistance leadership that he needed to go back to Superbia and attempt to salvage his position there had not been easy. Charlie had been worried about his safety, while Sam and Dean clearly didn’t want to lose someone that had even the smallest amount of information on whatever threat Zachariah would be posing to Invidia’s local resistance. They had all argued that Castiel had played his hand, and it was clear that his loyalties had switched. Their insistence on the matter might have been funny for who incredibly wrong they were, if it weren’t for the guilt Castiel still felt.
After that he won a few hands in a row to the increasing annoyance of mostly Cordelia, who Castiel had a feeling was close to accusing him of cheating. The truth of the matter was that he had had a few lucky hands. He guessed she would be happy to know about the awful starting hand he had for the next round. The chances of his winning were slim if he played the cards, but this might be an interesting opportunity to play the people.
“Jo!” Dean called out to her. Jo sighed and pointed towards one of the more affordable knives. The man gave her a receipt and pointed her towards the blood bank a few tents down. Dean accompanied Jo as she walked there. “I got something for you.”
It was an hour later that they cleared everyone to leave their rooms and report to whoever was in charge of them. Castiel remembered what he’d learned in Guttur, and decided then and there that he needed to find Dean and tell him what Mortimer had offered him and warn him that he suspected he wasn’t the only one who had received such an offer. They let him go too easily without trying harder to win him over, and Castiel was certain they wouldn’t have done so unless they had a backup, if not multiple backups.
“Why don’t you have any real food?” Claire complains loudly in response, watching as Jack gets his cereal. “Can’t a girl get a sandwich around here?”
He did his best to ignore the disdainful looks from some and the curious whispers from others. It wasn’t as though he weren’t expecting to be looked at differently after he had abandoned his position for two months before being forcibly brought back into the fold. Then again, he had always figured that if he got caught he would be dead soon after and he wouldn’t have to see the looks of betrayal on the faces of those he was supposed to serve.
The look on Charlie’s expression fades into one of shock and a little awe. Which, hey, could be worse. Not that it makes Mary all that comfortable. Though she supposes they’re pretty even in that they’ve only ever heard about each other. And Dean had spoken about Charlie rarely, but when he had it had been impossible to mistake her importance to him. The new Charlie, meanwhile, Dean avoided looking at too long. Like it hurt.
Gabriel drove a circuitous route into Superbia, expertly avoiding state checkpoints and ditching the car on the outskirts of the city. Afterwards, he and Castiel carefully picked their way across the heavily patrolled streets to the bar where Castiel had first met Jo. They went in through a well hidden side door and then waited to be let in from a small antechamber until someone came to get them.
“I could say there are a lot of people that would argue you do,” said Garth with a shrug. “And sometimes we need to forgive ourselves.”
“Marital dispute,” he said quietly, catching Metatron’s gaze. The man’s eyebrows raised in suspicion.
“I’m sorry,” said Castiel. “I need to find Jody. Or Ellen or Bobby. I have a message I need to deliver.”
And there it was, the weight of it all crashing down around them again. Not that Dean had needed to breathe normally ever again. It was the end of the world for Christ’s sake. The Apocalypse with a capital A. And there was Sam, a fucking sacrificial lamb to make it all go away.
“You’re quiet today,” Selma commented as Castiel’s eyes scanned the trees that were close to the perimeter of the camp. The road they had used to get here was on the other side of camp, and more people were keeping watch there, which meant Selma and Cas had more area to cover, but there was likelihood of any sort of attack. Then again, any attack at all should be unlikely, at least not without Charlie picking up on it first. She truly was in many ways their greatest asset and would be if that was the only thing she could do for them.
“Can we get back to signing our souls away on the dotted line? Didn’t know my love life was up for discussion.”
“You said you were the only one left after that first summer,” Castiel prompted softly. Dean looked a little surprised.
For the first time since the conversation started, Dean glanced back at Cas. And there was doubt, clear as day.
“Nope,” Dean says popping the p. He doesn’t actually feel like going out, but he does enjoy how uncomfortably conflicted Cas looks about the whole thing. “Actually you know what? I should be good to drive back. I’ll only have a few drinks so-”
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” she asks, opening her book and settling back into a more comfortable position. Entirely relaxed, as if Dean poses no more of a threat to her than a feather floating through the air. Which, considering Dean is dead right now, probably isn’t that far off. Not like her scythe is anywhere in the room, so at least she learned that lesson. A little too late, Dean thinks with a kind of vicious satisfaction. “You see part of that deal with Jack… It specified a lack of interference on my part in Winchester adjacent affairs.”
Cas looks up at Smash from where he’d been trying to scrape of glitter from his arms. Charlie’s fault, of course. Cas’ only affectation for the parade they were coming back from had been a plastic rainbow bracelet. Dean had told Charlie his gay accessory was Cas.
Well, Dean guesses he can’t blame her for that, then. Not like he hasn’t gone searching for missing pieces of his own father, trying to figure out some way to make his dad whole again. To justify the shambles his choices left Dean’s life in. Then again, Dean never read any of Chuck’s books, except the first couple, even for that. Snooped through what people had to say about them sure, looked up the gist of a few that stood out but… The thought of reading any more of Chuck’s shitty writing makes him want to vomit. Even more so now.
“What a burden for you,” Selma said, eyes twinkling mischievously. Jo turned bright red and Castiel tried to puzzle out why that might be, but was distracted when Jo responded to Selma’s teasing with a rejoinder of her own.
“You want to live?” Billie repeats. Making Dean say it, Cas supposes. Which would be a kinder thing if Dean weren’t struggling to breathe, as it were. Except, as in all things, Dean rises to the challenge.
“I’m sure I’ll be fine,” said Cas, eager to leave. Dr. Newman frowned but seemed to come to the conclusion Cas had heard similar speeches before and would do as he saw fit. He would be correct on both counts. He’d been shot by resistance forces three times in his ten years under Anna, and he hadn’t had a problem before, and he doubted he would have one now.
“Nice try,” says Tasha. “I’ve still got my kids down on Earth. I’m not letting anything take them before their time. So if I have to fight, fine. Beats whatever we were doing before.”
“Just shoot him,” Castiel said. He got his head yanked back painfully for the effort. “You can’t capture him, someone please just-“
“I’ve come to realize that I can’t shut the lights down here entirely,” she says. “Much as I might want to, there needs to be a spark alive in Heaven. I thought a nephil might have enough power on his own to keep the Emptiness inside him at bay, but if I’m wrong… I worry about what might happen if Heaven is completely gone and there is no recourse.”
“It’s not funny Sam,” she says, but he can tell she’s messing with him now. “I got blood all over my favorite jacket. That’s never coming out.”
Billie was in charge. If she said something could or couldn’t happen, that was the final word on the subject. Because of this, no one ever went to her with any questions. Dean was the one who handled the day to day running of everything from food to weapons to the chances of a surprise attack. Sam was who you went to if you had an idea you knew Dean wouldn’t like and Billie would laugh in your face if you brought up. Sarah, Kevin, and Frank were who you went to if you wanted an obscure piece of information found quickly, and for apparently obvious reasons you went to them specifically in that order. Benny, Rufus, Gordon, Risa, Tamara, and Linda were each in charge of a section of the camp. Everyone had to be proficient with a weapon, but it seemed not everyone was involved with the attacks on state resources that Castiel remembered having to defend against when he was still working with his garrison.
Unlike Ira, most of the taller buildings in Guttur weren’t functional, and were slowly being taken apart as needs for materials arose. The ability to cannibalize the city itself meant that there were surrounding areas that still had surviving relics of previous suburban areas, abandoned for the most part now. Anna had once made them do a training exercise in an abandoned street. It had involved each of them attempting to sneak up on each other and make a “kill” until only one person was left. Castiel remembered how unsettlingly quiet it had been.
“No. It’s not stupid, okay? I watched my parents burn. I heard them screaming, and I couldn’t save them. I have never stopped being scared. I’m still not okay and I don’t know if I ever will be. If Jo couldn’t wait for me to figure that out, that’s fine. But you were supposed to be my friend, and you were supposed to want to hear my side and you didn’t.”
It annoyed Cas enough that he stopped trying to be careful. He didn’t want to have to think about his words, or tip toe around Claire’s feelings, or second guess what she might want from him. He just wanted to know.
“Dean wants you on his recon mission. Now, I don’t think that’s a good idea for more than one reason, but I figured I at least owe you the chance to prove me wrong,” she said. Castiel blinked. “You’re a well known name, especially among some of the refugee soldiers. You’ve disobeyed direct orders from both Naomi and Dean while claiming to be working for them. And you’re also a few pickets short of a fence.”
Castiel stood at the corner Jo had left him at for half an hour before he noticed her car slowly glide its way towards him. He felt a degree of relief that he wouldn’t be forced to wait any longer. Every face he saw in this part of town was unfriendly to him, despite the fact he didn’t wear the insignia of a soldier anymore. Perhaps it was the way he held himself that made it so obvious who he was. Or perhaps survival required being able to recognize soldiers on sight. Either way, Castiel had a feeling he was one wrong move away from a stranger attacking him, and he was glad to not have to be on constant alert when he got into Jo’s car. When he walked up, he was surprised to see Charlie had accompanied her.
Max, Alicia, and Krissy stepped forward, ready to mount an offensive at a moment's notice. They all seemed to have been relatively well cared for. Cas felt another nudge in his brain, telling him that something strange was happening in Libidine, and they still didn’t know what exactly. It made sense to imprison Resistance people who were standing in the way of your goals (of a much more violent and awful revolution than the Resistance condoned). But considering how the soldiers had been treated, it didn’t make sense to keep them caged but also well fed and taken care of. Cas had to remind himself there wasn’t time to ask the wrong questions. The power would be back on soon, and they would lose whatever hope they had of keeping the prison break a secret. They had knocked out most of the guards, but he was certain someone in the building was hiding in wait, biding their time to call reinforcements. He could be wrong, but it was a risk he didn’t want to take.
She snatches Sam’s emergency phone from the glove compartment, and starts it up. Her fingers hover over the messaging app, wondering what the hell she’s supposed to type.
Dean doesn’t say anything. Bobby stares him down. In retrospect, Dean will realize this is Bobby giving him a chance to defend himself. But as they say hindsight is twenty twenty, and what Bobby says next hits Dean like a brick to the face.
Definitely Jessica. Cordelia wouldn’t have acknowledged him, whether he’d saved Charlie’s life or not.
“Yeah, alcohol wasn’t the problem,” said Jo, leaving Castiel to wonder what exactly was. Nothing good if her grim expression was anything to go by. “But enough of that. Tonight is going to be a blast. Boris and Harriet helped Kali fix some furniture that was broken last time they drove with me into Superbia and that woman is a goddess when it comes to paying back favors.”
“Jo and Charlie aren’t speaking,” said Castiel, because that at least was something he could talk about out loud. “I don’t think Charlie knows why.”
And in the end, it is memories. Always memories. The closest thing to a perfect reward God could imagine.
Murmurs started going through the crowd. Cas looked to Eileen and Sam who seemed unsurprised by this statement.
“It’s good to see you again, James,” says Missouri. He takes her hand to help her up the step. Missouri looks back at her granddaughter, and Patience can see the love shining in her eyes. It’s too much to bear. “The both of you.”
That, Castiel decides, is probably more the pain medication talking than anything. So instead of dignifying anything Dean just said with a response, he reaches and lays a hand on Dean’s chest. It surprises him that Dean doesn’t react poorly after what the crocotta did to him, using Cas’ voice as a weapon against him. But Dean just looks up at him guileless and confused as his bones mend themselves together and his concussion fades to nothing. Cas takes the edge off the medication Dean is on while he’s at it, and hesitantly removes a small kidney stone Dean doesn’t know he has. He knows it’s not necessary, and in fact is actively dangerous because it requires a little more of his grace than he planned on using, but before he can second guess himself it’s done.
Curious despite himself, Cas sits up. When still nothing comes from the hall, he stands and ventures out himself.
Neither of them said anything for a minute. Dean was clearly out of words, and Cas could feel tears threatening to spill over. To think, he hadn’t expected any of this. He’d been happy to finally let Dean know how he felt, and now… He looked down at their hands on the table and rubbed his thumbs over the back of Dean’s hands. He let out a short laugh when he felt Dean’s grip on his hands tighten.
Ziggy sighed, which Dean wouldn't have thought was possible for a computer to do. "I really shouldn't tell you," she said.
"Thank you," the man said, rubbing his neck uncomfortably. "My name is Al Calavicci. I helped develop Project Quantum Leap, which was looking into the process of time travel."
By the end of the day, Dean was spent. His body didn’t feel like it was his anymore. He was broken, and he was bloody, and he was numb. He had tried to fight his bonds, and he could feel the exhaustion in his bones when the demon finally left him alone.
Dean opens the door a crack and steps half through it. “’Morning sunshine,” he says. His voice is soft, in volume and texture.
Castiel fought, as he’d been trained. He forced himself to ignore the souls on the racks, even as the fighting inevitably forced him to harm them as well. It pained him to do so, but he couldn’t think of that. He was a soldier. He had the mission to focus on. These were the souls of the damned. There was only one that was destined to make it out intact.
Into his room. His bed in front of him. The nightstand with its dated lamp and alarm clock he’s never set and the tape Dean made him. It’s perfectly ordinary.
Dean’s expression is more fond than Cas has ever seen it, and Cas distantly thinks that this must just be how Dean looks at him now. “Because I want you, Cas.”
"Awesome," Dean said, walking over to them. He went to reach out to Sam, meaning to untie his arms, but his hand went right through Sam's arm.
“It isn’t… easy, if that’s what you mean,” Cas said. How long had he not said anything? Once the words had started to have real weight, and he’d started to really understand the implication, he’d gone so long without wanting to stir up trouble. He’d come off the line with a crack in his chassis, wasn’t that what Naomi had said? What if it was something wrong with him? Something that would only make things worse? And he’d gone so long believing that Dean couldn’t love him back. It had taken a deal to
They stood there for a while - Cas wasn’t sure how long. Long enough that it was Sam’s voice talking to the children they’d saved that made Dean jump back. Dean’s eyes were wet, but he quickly scrubbed his hands over his face and steadied himself.
He wished, not for the first time, that he could forget the day Cas had saved him. Remembering that day always lead to remembering the other days, and Dean’s jaw tightened when the image of his first victim flashed across his mind. He hadn’t deserved to be saved, he knew that. Sure, he’d stopped the apocalypse, but he still wasn’t sure that made up for all he’d done to the poor souls in hell.
“Good,” Dean says. He pushes himself up to sitting with visible reluctance. “How about something to eat?”
In an effort to not look overeager, Dean let Miracle stray off the path once or twice as she followed her nose. It still wasn’t long before they caught up to Cas on the hill.
The way that grin grows across Dean’s face is something like poetry in motion. His whole face lights up and his eyes are bright. He holds out his hand. “Come home with me?”
Alastair trained him himself. Dean could feel the demon’s presence, so close to him in that room, directing his moves, until Dean could inflict new pains on new souls every day.
Cas looked like he wanted to vaporize Beckett, but he restrained himself. "Yes," he said, his jaw clenched.
That was a good question. Cas knew the answer, of course. He’d considered it when Jack had asked him a similar question just the other day. No, the real question was, was it an answer Dean wanted to hear? “What do
She had been in trouble. Sam had said so. She’d been about to answer him, but then everything was dark.
Al was a little worried by this sudden change in demeanor, but he continued with his explanation. "The only way you get out is if you stay in this room until Sam leaps to someone else."
"Do you mind letting me down?" the man asked, his voice strained. "I'll explain, but it's a bit difficult to breathe."
So when Sam had graduated from law school, the first thing he did when he was settled in his new apartment with his new job was get a dog.
"And killed how many of us to get there? I'm all for the world spinning on uninterrupted, but I don't feel like being sent to Purgatory," the first one snapped.
"Not particularly," Beckett admitted. "I've done martial arts in other lives, but I haven't done much with weapons."
"I'm not sitting around waiting for the end. It's not my style," Dean said. "Besides, you know where I am. As soon as he's done, I go back and get in the room and then back to my own time."
Sam shook his head and looked up at Cas. “I know you’re trying to be cautious, and I appreciate it, really, but I think it’s her.” Really, would that be the weirdest thing that had happened in the last day and a half? It seemed pretty tame compared to the last several years, honestly. He finally managed to type a response, a quick
The second day Cas wasn’t there, Dean wasn’t worried, per se, he was just concerned about being able to see Cas again. He was running out of days until Sam got back, and then he thought it might be weird to just… keep coming to the park in the mornings if there wasn’t an actual established reason. What would he say to Sam?
Cas takes a deep breath. He nods, but knows better than to trust the feeling. “You came to get me?” he asks. When Dean confirms, he says, “Tell me how.”
“Don’t tell me you didn’t know,” Dean says softly. His mouth is turned up ever so slightly at the corners. “For a long time, Cas.”
Sam gave him some kind of smirk that Dean didn’t feel like decoding and disappeared down the hall with the most fake nonchalant stride Dean had ever seen.
"Yeah, sorry to bother you, but my brother and I were on our way to Oklahoma City and we seem to have lost our way," Sam said smoothly. "Would you mind giving us directions?"
Dean flinched at the mention of the room. They’d never spoken about that room before, and Dean had hoped it would stay that way. “I’m sorry. About what I did,” he said, dropping his gaze.
“Come back to the bunker with me,” Sam said. He knew everything was all over - all the heaven and hell, the light and darkness, the fate and destiny. They’d made it to free will, and there was nothing coming after them. He knew Eileen wasn’t going to go anywhere, and if he left, she’d still be right here when he got back. But he didn’t want to leave her again.
Cas sighed. "I can't help you," he said. He held up a hand to halt Dean's protest. "You aren't in your own body, and you aren't even in the same time period as the person who is.
"Noted," Al said. "Anyway, Ziggy says Sam was overpowered on this hunt. And...turned, I guess. If that's how you'd put it."
"You don't seem to get it," Al said, stepping closer. "If you aren't in that room, Sam can't leap. He can't get out of your life. So I suggest you get back there so the second he does what he needs to do, you can get home. Lord knows I want you there."
“It’s okay,” Dean says quickly. He crosses what little space there is between them and kneels beside Cas’ chair. He rests his hand on Cas’ forearm. “Take your time.”
He slips his feet in the slippers and takes his suit and coat to his room. He drapes them over the back of the chair at the desk for lack of any better ideas.
Castiel reached it first, fending off demons with every trick he’d ever learned and several he’d improvised. The other angels kept the demons at bay as Castiel reached out for the soul, clutched it tight to himself, wrapped his wings around them both as shields, and rocketed toward the ceiling high above them.
“Not to hell, no.” Cas can pinpoint the exact moment a bit of the suspicion drains from Dean’s face, replaced with a bit of his old humor.
Sam raised a brow at him, but said nothing. He pulled his phone out to do the preliminary search for anything out of the ordinary and paused after a moment, glancing back up at his brother. “Is it your birthday?” he asked.
Dean’s presence was calm and reassuring, and the effect was immediate. People listened to what he said and hopped to it, guards and prisoners alike. They wanted to survive and Dean Winchester sounded like he knew what the hell he was doing. For a second, Cas believed that too.
“I know you’ll be sending Benny because you don’t trust Dorothy completely, and you have to send her,” said Cas. “And Jack because he looks fourteen and he’ll make a good spy-“
“No one wins,” Cas said, feeling the crushing weight of it fall onto his shoulders. “Then what’s the point? If all there is is anger and sadness and revenge and hopelessness, then what is the fucking point?”
“Is something wrong?” Castiel managed to ask, trying to bury the feelings of hurt when Dean turned away from him to sleep off the post orgasm haze. They used to talk, when they were intimate. Castiel looked forward to that, more than he would ever look forward to the act itself, which while pleasant was not something Castiel ached for, even now. He wanted closeness and intimacy with Dean, but he was increasingly realizing two people could have sex without either of these things.
“Right,” said Castiel, feeling the slightest bit unwelcome. “Well, I’ll leave you all to it. Sorry for… interrupting.”
‘What did I say?,’ Eileen signs, innocence stamped into her wide eyed look of confusion. She grins when Sam pulls her into a hug, kissing the top of her head and then lifting her chin up to look at her. She looks back, and Sam can’t shake the feeling that she really sees him when she does. Good and bad, even the parts he still kind of wishes weren’t there. “What scares you?”
“Yes?” Castiel asked, patience starting to wear thin. Dr. Newman rolled his eyes at this, and it struck Castiel that many of his patients probably treated him like this. It wasn’t a sobering enough thought to convince Castiel to stop.
“Very well,” he said. “My name is Metatron. I’m the leader here. Remember that before you get on my bad side.”
“I think what Charlie means,” said Selma carefully. “Is if you’re in pain, you don’t have to act like it’s unimportant.”
“Dean gave me the night off for a discount on my mom’s beer,” Jo said. “Besides, I want to see their faces when you show them that thing you can do.”
“No,” she said shortly. “The only reason you’re still alive right now is I want to make sure of something before I put a bullet between your eyes.”
Because they were occupying a State building and no one had told them to learn how to operate it properly, Castiel thought to himself, a manic terror ripping through him. It was almost funny. All this time spent on being certain he never underestimated his enemies, and it had never occurred to him that he might be killed for his inability to predict sheer ineptitude. And not even his own, for Christ’s sake.
Finding the stairwell was easier than planned. There was a path of dust that went unnoticed by the busy people milling about, but was obvious if one had the eye for it. Two sets of footprints coming from an unguarded corner, which Castiel slipped behind and made his way through the whole that had been knocked into the wall by Eileen and Sam before him.
“And what’s that?” Castiel asked, not without resentment. Anna sat up and looked down at him. With a touch, the chains keeping him still disappeared and Castiel was free to stand. Anna was bleeding again. Castiel hated himself as he caught her when she began to fall. Lowered her down gently, despite knowing how she had betrayed him. Not him, the state. Betrayed the state. Personal feelings had no place in this.
“Don’t fight,” he says. He tries to come up with an answer for Dean’s question, but fails. He doesn’t know what held him together, what filled the pieces missing inside him. He just remembers a sudden warmth, a release from the sickening feeling of his entire being drawn inward towards emptiness. Wholeness, in a way he hasn’t known since years before. And something warm, like the sound of his mother’s heartbeat, but new. Something like love. “Cas?”
Castiel walked into the Naomi’s building instead of further engaging Meg and she walked in beside him. The two took the elevator up to Naomi’s floor and Castiel walked up to Ambriel without so much as stopping to see who was staring at him this time.
“You’re not negotiating with Cas, you’re negotiating with us,” Dean broke in forcefully, obviously trying to redirect the conversation. “So we need to-“
Claire looks up straight at Patience and mouths a silent “What the fuck?” that Patience ignores. They don’t have much time, and there’s still more to get through before the big one hits. If they want to survive that is. So Amara is a former primordial being, they can roll with that. Patience had been wondering why she wasn’t being much help in her visions. Then again, as long as she helps enough.
“Well, I guess that means I have nothing to lose,” she said. “Good thing these morons don’t know a home made bomb when they see one.”
“Shut up, you sarcastic bastard,” said Jo. “Just so you know, I had to do a lot of favors for Charlie to get this, okay? Like a lot of favors-“
“Maybe Dean should get a pet,” signs Castiel. “He was upset when Jody found Miracle’s owners. He wouldn’t say it, but he was.”
“You love him,” Castiel said, causing Jo to suck in a sharp breath and jab her elbow into his side. Benny’s expression didn’t change.
Jason didn’t look thrilled to be meeting Castiel. Castiel offered him a short nod, which the boy ignored.
“Got another one, huh?” he says, kneeling down to peer in at the hissing creature. “No more balls for you, dude.”
“I think you see the parts of me you want to see,” said Cas. “And you ignore the rest, because you can’t justify liking me if you admit to yourself what I am.”
“Oh, that is hilarious,” Charlie said, laughing a little. Dean joined in with her, and a couple of others in the group managed to fake a giggle. “No, I am so not into dudes. Dean, you must have been sleepwalking through writing that.”
Jack went back to looking disappointed. Castiel thought perhaps he should start getting used to it, because life was full of disappointment.
“Maybe we are just a pair of dumbasses,” he said. “I still haven’t thought of an apology for Charlie.”
Risa backed off, especially when one of the bigger guards started glaring at her and making threatening gestures. She turned back to Aaron, clearly unpleased.
“Tell him,” said Cas, and Charlie’s eyes widened. “None of you need me here. None of you trust me. All I am is an inconvenience. That’s all I’ve ever been to any of you. You said if I couldn’t see a happy ending with Dean, I should leave him. Maybe you were right. Maybe it’s best for everyone if I disappeared and let the rest of you fix the world, because I clearly don’t know how.”
“Charlie and her people, the good Dr. Newman and his family, Lydia and some of the kids, the Patels….”
Cas saw Dean collapse on the ground seconds before a loud series of clicks announced that the door was no longer locked. Then Benny opened the door, and a mad scramble to reach it began. Feeling himself being pulled along by the crowd, Cas tried to dodge out of the way, but found he wasn’t much match for thirty people all desperately trying to escape the smoke filled room. So instead of fight, Castiel curled up on the ground and protected his head, letting the others crawl over him to get to safety. When the crowd had thinned somewhat, he leapt to his feet and pushed anyone still in front of him towards the door, both directing them towards safety and gaining momentum towards his objective: the crumpled silhouette of Dean Winchester lying unconscious on the floor.
Because Cas knows this, he knows Jack does too. Except God doesn’t say anything more for now. Instead, he will wait for Castiel to damn himself. As it should be, Cas supposes. With free will and all.
“Thank you,” he said to her, unable to help feeling a degree of warmth for her willingness to show him kindness despite her misgivings.
“My, my, is our resident robot blushing?” asked Benny, all worry instantly gone. “So less conversation, then.”
“And that’s what I want too,” pleads Dean. He sees Cas’ hands clench at his side and he knows already that he’s won.
“Sam,” says Dean. His voice wavers, doubt breaking through. Sam remembers that a long time ago it used to bother him that Dean always told him what to do. Then after a while he just… he gave up being angry about it. Because, as if by magic, no matter what Dean always ended up being right. And Sam had never really gotten that independence he’d spent so long craving, only pieces of it. Leading the Apocalypse hunters in those months Dean was gone, possessed by Michael. Running over a dog and trying to build a life for himself that he’d kind of liked, even if it hadn’t been the right one in the end. And all that running away he’d done and almost done as a kid.
“Uh, what about the rest of us?” says Chuck, finally daring to speak again. “I kinda like the part where you were going to let us go?”
“Alright, fine. Be a smartass about it and see if I care. Hope you enjoy all the shitty jobs you’re gonna get for disobeying orders.”
“You shouldn’t sound so happy about that,” said Dean, who’d caught sight of Jo’s vicious excitement. “I’m a dead man, Jo.”
“Hallucinations are waking dreams. In what world would I ever be involved in your dreams, good or bad?” he asked. Benny considered that and at last he seemed to catch on to exactly what was happening.
Sam has dragged in another chair so there’s enough for everybody. Amara has taken her seat at the head of the table, which Castiel shouldn’t be surprised by but it still rankles him. Then again, it’s not as if it has any significance outside of what humans give it. She probably just decided to sit where she would be least unwelcome. A part of Castiel understands that dilemma and he feels a moment of contrition for his original annoyance.
“Just… different,” he said. “I can actually… wanting to be with him makes sense. It doesn’t repulse me the way imagining myself like that with most people does. It doesn’t feel wrong.”
“Did… did Charlie do something?” Castiel tried, still bewildered by exactly what he was supposed to do in this situation. Jo didn’t say anything, but if the way her shoulders went taut, Castiel had guessed correctly. “How is this supposed to help?”
“It’s the same for me,” Cas says. Because his entire worldview has shifted about two inches to the left and three degrees counter clockwise, and it’s the first thing he can think to say. “I mean, not about Anubis. He’s irrelevant, but about-“
“Mom might have asked me to pick some things up for her. I’ll get going,” said Mandy. “Hey, handsome? Make sure you get out safe.”
“I’m sure there’s a compliment hidden in there somewhere,” said Cas. “Beneath the assumption that I don’t know what I want, or don’t know what I’m asking for. And the fact you think I’m stupid.”
They had made real progress as late afternoon started to sink in. There were only a few boxes left to go through, and Claire was already discussing things they could do later as a reward for all the hard work. Kaia had half convinced her to stay the night at Jody’s so they could stay up late and watch horror movies without Mr. Winchester quoting every line. Alex hated horror movies, which was enough reason for Claire to be on board with the plan.
Or Kelly might have been lied to. He couldn’t discount that possibility, and it made bringing up the topic harder. He knew that even his close friends viewed him as something of a wild card, and he didn’t want them to be wary of him switching sides again. He knew who his loyalty belonged to at the moment. For better or worse.
While he waits, Sam let’s himself come to a decision. Dean’s gonna be okay. If the thanks Cas wants for that is not getting credit, then that’s the thanks he’s gonna get. Even if Sam thinks maybe both Cas and Dean would like it a little better if Cas bothered to show his face again. Not like it’s his job to explain that just because it’s complicated doesn’t mean Dean doesn’t want the guy around. Cas is still Dean’s best friend, if nothing else. Hell, he’s Sam’s best friend too, not like Cas ever seems to remember that part. Still, Sam knows Dean well enough to know that nothing could make that just go away.
“When people lie to you, it’s usually a red flag. You told me she, uh, he was lying to you,” says Sam. “I wanted to make sure nothing shitty happened. I didn’t want you to get kidnapped, I wasn’t listening for some kind of secret coming out message. You’re like the straightest person I know, how was I supposed to guess-“
In time Cas came across Bobby Singer. To this point, Cas had kept himself hidden from the souls he’d come across, but something in him ached to say hello. Sentimentality, perhaps.
“The spell might be difficult to change,” Cas continued, still thinking out loud. “If her soul is still out there, we might be able to lock onto it and figure out a way to get her back here.”
Al hesitated, seemed to debate lying. He sighed, figuring it would be better to just say it. "Sam Winchester. Your brother. He gets hurt."
When Dean was cut off, he slammed his hands down on the keyboard. The static remained for a moment before dissipating.
had wanted him to die, right? He’d managed to claw his way out of this ending, take away Chuck’s power to finish him like this, but still here he was. As angry as he was over it, he felt terror clawing back into his heart; it didn’t matter how many times he’d done this, the thought of dying still got to him.
Cas pushes his chair back and stands. Everyone just watches him. Wishes him a good rest. He thanks them. Hesitates. Watches Dean. “Will you come with me?” He isn’t ready to step into darkness, though he’s sure he will. He hopes Dean coming with him will grant him just a little more time.
This being decided, Catriona consumed the remainder of Abel’s grace, restoring herself to a youthful beauty and her full power. She tied her maroon velvet traveling cloak around her shoulders and bid her brothers farewell, then began to walk in the direction the star had fallen.
“And you’d like to go to the community college in Sioux Falls?” asks Cas. He knows Kelly has suggested other places, but Jack has remained firm on this point. He checks anyway, that Jack is doing as he pleases, not what is expected of him only.
Castiel tried to ignore the feeling of tethers within him snapping as he tried to think of Anna as a traitor to the state. Anna wouldn’t…
“How can you all think it would be at all strategic to present yourselves as an effective threat?” Castiel said, not caring for a moment that they were staring at him. “Sending three factions to various points around the city? You have to know that looks like you’re moving to attack.”
And out of all the times Cas had tried to hurt Dean, this was the first time he felt like he’d truly succeeded. Most of the time, Dean would let whatever Castiel said roll off of his shoulders, responding with rolled eyes for lesser offenses and anger for the more serious. But this time… For a moment, Dean looked broken. And of all Castiel’s various crimes, he couldn’t help feeling that this was one of the worst.
Kali raised her hand a moment to catch their attention and then pointed to a screen in front of her. It was showing a circle popping up indicating incoming communication.
“We’ve got company,” Claire said solemnly. Behind her stood Meg Masters and Charlie Bradbury, the latter of whom was looking a little worse for wear. Cas lunged forward, placing himself between the two and pushing Meg away hard enough that she stumbled to the floor.
“Since you’re so interested, I should let you know that in your official report to Mary Winchester, let it be noted I no longer use too much teeth.”
“Fine, but you should still go,” Jo said. “Betty might stop by, and I need someone to stop me from saying something about it.”
That night Benny still seemed to be in an incredibly bad mood and determined to take it out on Castiel. So, despite the fact Castiel was almost certain it was Lizzie and Boris’ turn to take to wash dishes that evening, somehow Castiel and Selma had been assigned.
“Same difference,” says Dean. “And it’s not- It’s not dying I’m afraid of. Just losing over and over again and having to live through it, because even when God’s fucking dead I’m stuck doing encores.”
“Sam’s got everything under control,” Dean defended himself easily. He clearly had a good rapport with this Jody.
“Drop it,” said Cas as they arrived at the new med hallway. It was dingy and obviously chosen for its easy access to the exits, so at least they’d learned their lesson there. “You can go now.”
“That went about as well as I was expecting,” she said after they’d gotten out. “I think Dean might be coming around on you. Maybe. Sam’s going to take a while. Billie trusts no one, so… good luck there.”
Cas hadn’t wanted Jack to come along for the mission. When Dean had suggested it, he had all but threatened to all but sabotage any attempt at recon Dean would make. Unfortunately, Dean was smart enough to inform Jack that he wanted him along, but wasn’t sure if he was ‘mature’ enough, and that had lit a fire under Jack until it was the only thing he spoke about. Gadreel, who obviously considered himself something of a father figure to Jack, had nearly broken his rock solid composure and threatened Dean when he learned of this, but there was no stopping an intrepid (read stupid) teenager with something to prove. It was made doubly worse, in Cas’ humble opinion, because Jack looked up to Castiel. Why he couldn’t fathom, but it made him feel like all of his actions were under a microscope, and whatever stories soldiers had been trading had created expectations entirely too high for him to meet.
After he was finally released from the meeting, he decided to put off finding Selma for a little while longer by stopping to see Charlie. He hadn’t had much contact with her since arriving in Ira. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but seeing Charlie in an impassioned argument with a more passive aggressive Ash on whose method of breaking down city defenses and decoding intercity messages was better was not what he expected to see.
“Okay,” he says. “Let’s make a plan. For the hunt, tonight. And then when we finish that, we’ll tackle Chuck.”
“I know a lot of you see my mom and I as running separate operations,” said Dean. “And in effect, sure that’s pretty much right. Unfortunately, that’s not going to work if we want to take out Invidia and Superbia, which are next on our hit list.”
“Dean. The hell does he think he’s doing making a deal like that without running it by me. This is my city,” said Gabriel. “He better hope I shoot him somewhere lethal too, because Kali-“
Castiel was glad to be assigned to a cabin with Selma, Jo, Rosali, and Carl. It meant that while the approval process for the mission Dean had proposed to his mother was occurring, he would be among friends. It also meant Jo had been officially demoted, something she took with more grace than Castiel had been expecting.
“Jason’s birthday is coming up,” she said, then went back to knitting. “And Kevin’s is next month. I’m going to make him socks.”
“Castiel made his choice,” she says. There’s no malice in her voice, no jealousy or anger. She doesn’t hate the angel or love him or particularly care about him either way, except as it pertains to the fact that Dean cares for him. There is still a thread of her that will never be able to harm Dean, that is connected to him intimately. Still she is as close a thing they have to an impartial judge in this room. “And I think we have bigger fish to fry right now. Because the souls aren’t happy. I can feel them graying at the edges. Squirming. Not the most relaxing sensation.”
“Heaven is different for everyone,” Cas replied. “So everyone gets their own heaven. With the exception of soulmates.”
Al watched Sam from the present day, appearing as a hologram tuned to Sam's brainwaves, so only Sam (and a few minor exceptions) could see him. Al always brought along Ziggy, the parallel hybrid computer with an ego. That's what they called her anyway, though not to her face. She could usually find what Sam needed to change in any given scenario so he could leap again. Usually.
On the way into town, Sam turned possibilities over in his mind. Dean had the anti-possession tattoo, so he wasn't a Demon. There hadn't been signs of a struggle in the motel room, so it was unlikely Dean had been attacked by anything. Besides, Cas had been there with him at least most of the night, and if something had gone wrong, he would have come to Sam first.
No one was up by the time Dean walked into the kitchen, and he was still alone by the time he’d fed Miracle and had breakfast. Just as well. Let them rest. Dean scrawled out a note that he’d taken Miracle for a walk, and grabbed a leash, Miracle very patiently
Perhaps it could. Dean was staring at Castiel, wondering if he’d actually died and gone to heaven and had simply not been paying attention. Cas didn’t seem any worse for wear, anyway. He was missing his trench coat - but of course he was; the coat was in the Impala’s trunk - and the blade he held in his hand was soiled with vampire blood, but other than that, he seemed just like himself.
“I told you to stop by whenever you wanted,” Cas pointed out. He stepped aside so Jack could enter. He turned and called Dean over his shoulder.
As he left the grave, still reeling from what he had felt, Castiel called out to the other angels, something a little like glee still trailing its way through his grace.
Cas nods. He could swear he hears the Empty behind him, but that could be the roaring in his ears. He can’t be sure of the difference. “It never ends.”
Dean had tried to prepare this year, he really had. He didn’t think about hell so much when he was awake anymore. He’d actually gotten pretty good at ignoring it in his waking hours (he had more important things to worry about). When he was asleep – that was a different story.
Sam laughed, a short surprised sound. “Well I’ll just take Miracle and get out of your hair. Unless you want her to come be your wing-man some more.” At the sound of her name, Miracle came trotting over. She sat when she saw her leash in Sam’s hand.
Cas’ expression tightened. He looked like a man overwhelmed. His eyes welled with tears, and one spilled down each cheek. He tried to say something, but no words came out.
“’Morning sunshine,” Dean says. He closes the space between them and wraps his arms around Cas like a vice.
Her phone was on the end table beside the couch. She tried to unlock it, but the screen stayed blank. Dead.
Dean remembered the hellhounds. He remembered the blinding pain as their claws ripped into his mortal body, and then something entirely worse when their claws and fangs sank into his soul as it tried to escape and started to drag it with them. He remembered wondering why the cliché was to tell people
the spell and using his grace. It’s the only truly complete memory of a rescue he has. “Why did you come get me?”
He expects the portal to open up and drag him away again. He expects the whole scene to melt away before his eyes and leave him alone and broken again. Already, he feels alone and broken again.
Dean could feel the goofy look descending on his face again, but he didn’t bother to stop it. “You came just because you wanted me to flirt with you?”
A walk was good. The morning was crisp, the eastern horizon just turning pink. Usually they took a loop that lasted about half an hour. Today was not usual.
Dean stopped scrolling, since he’d reached the picture of his own face. He didn’t have many pictures of himself, and this one really was very good. “You’ll keep this one?”
Dean stared at the man, uncomprehending. "Sorry," he said sarcastically. "Mind running that by me again? I must have misheard you." He pressed his forearm harder into the man's Adam's apple.
Mostly Dean saw joggers. One said, “Good morning,” as they went past, which Dean answered with a polite smile and nod. One person was sitting on a bench, reading something on their phone.
He needn’t have worried. As soon as the incantation passed his lips, there was that familiar rush of power, a sense of free-fall, and then the comfortable atmosphere of the bunker’s library.
Second, Jack had taken over for Chuck. That part was pretty cool, and the thought of his son (“Jack’s our son, isn’t he?” Dean had asked Sam at one point, when he’d had a little too much to drink. “The three of us, you, me, and Cas. He’s our son?” Sam had given him a strange look and said something about Jack being family. Dean couldn’t remember the details at this point.) being the one in charge of just about everything was pretty gratifying. Even so, Dean found himself looking for Jack around the bunker, in the rear-view mirror. Life was just, quiet. Lonely.
That feeling of happiness is back, and it aches. Cas expects the Empty to reach out and reclaim him for it, but nothing happens. Dean just keeps looking at him. “I can be happy.”
“It’s the Empty,” Jack says, with more confidence than Cas would have expected. When Cas looks over at him, his expression isn’t one of understanding, but it is the expression of someone who has an inkling.
of emotion. There was pain there, and a deep sense of longing. Pride and ambition and duty and humility. Loyalty and rebellion. And suddenly it was no wonder to Castiel why the souls sang such beautiful chords; anything that could hold this
Sam dropped the note back to the desk and went back to the bedroom, looking through the duffel again, hoping for some kind of clue. He didn't find anything that was immediately helpful. What he did find was a stash of fake badges, a flask that was filled with something that Sam determined was water, and a box of salt. So that wasn't helpful, though it was weird. Next he searched the closet, but his finds there weren't any more helpful: a suit, a couple of dress shirts, a few ties, and an outfit that looked startlingly like a Priest's.
The walk back was more straightforward than the meandering path they had trekked to the lake. And the whole way, Dean felt butterflies in his stomach. He almost scoffed at the idea. Dean Winchester did
. Sam didn’t even want to think about when Dean was in purgatory. He’d been running from his pain, and it didn’t matter how hard he’d worked at it, he hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that that wasn’t where he was supposed to be, no matter how much of his childhood (hell, even part of his young adulthood) he’d spent dreaming about not having to deal with the monsters. No, he’d grown into the role that he’d carved for himself here without even realizing it; the monsters and hunters were going to be a part of his life, and he was going to make sure anyone who needed the information he had was going to have it.
"Look, Al, I'm sure you mean well, but bad things have happened to me since I was four. Your friend is a little late with the whole 'stopping something bad.' In fact, he picked probably the worst time to jump in. Things have actually been going
Dean took what he thought would be a steadying breath. It wasn’t, but he started in on what he was going to say anyway. “I thought you were dead,” he managed. And dammit, even staring at the table, he could feel Cas’ eyes on him. “Dead for good. I had started looking for a way to get you back, but I didn't have a chance to get everything together.”
Sam mentally kicked himself for leaving her things at her place instead of taking them with him. It had seemed like a good idea at the time. “Not on me. I could get something.” An idea occurred to him, and he pulled out his phone to text Dean; maybe if Dean was nearby, he could just stop at Eileen’s while he was out and grab something.
“You were knocked out when I left,” Dean says. He’s sitting diagonally from Cas, leaning forward and down over the table to try to catch Cas’ eye. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
“How’d you come back?” Sam asked when he broke the hug, staying at arm’s length and looking Cas over carefully, as if he could find the answer written on his suit somewhere.
Cas tries not to. Looking means this scene will end. Looking means the countdown starts. He looks up anyway, and finds as much concern as he’s ever seen on Dean’s face.
“You were out a long time,” Dean says. He reaches along the wall beside the door. “I’m turning the light on.”
“How did you do that?” Now that he was focused and his grace had settled, Cas could almost hear the hum of power coming off of Jack.
Jack stepped up to the door of the bunker. He hadn’t told anyone he was coming today, but it seemed as good a day as any.
"Yeah, I gathered that part," Beckett said. "Apparently we're here to investigate one, but I don't know Al. These guys use fake badges and have more guns than I've ever seen in one place outside a range. This guy, this Dean guy I'm in, he sleeps with a knife under his pillow."
Maybe she’d been knocked unconscious by whatever Sam had been worried about? But she was still at home. If she’d been in danger, she would have been dead. Or if Sam had found her unconscious, he wouldn’t have left her there. And he would have come to find her, right?
Cas turned to face forward in time to see Dean hold something out to him from the front seat. His coat. Cas thanked him and sank his fingers into the worn fabric. It’d been cleaned recently. He studied it as the Impala’s engine roared to life, but decided against analyzing it for now. Instead he spread it over the kids next to him to keep them warm.
Cas shrugged. He scratched Miracle behind her ears. “It gets dark enough here I wanted to try some long exposure shots with a new lens.”
Dean turned around, expecting to see someone standing in the doorway. When he saw no one there, he turned back to the computer, pressing a few more keys to test the machine's reaction.
No. “How did I come back?” Cas asks. He leans forward, elbows on the table where his plate was just a moment ago.
The demon chuckled, and the sound reverberated around the room. It turned toward a table off to the side and ran a hand over the weapons there. “My name is Alastair,” it said, almost conversationally. “We will be seeing a lot of each other.”
After a few minutes, there was silence from the werewolves, save for a bit of light snoring. Sam carefully dropped the rope, his eyes trained on the shelves, waiting for a wolf to come after him. Beckett followed his lead, moving slowly to retrieve his silver knife.
Cas shakes his head, at a loss. “I don’t know.” But he does. The Empty sent Dean to torture him. Because this isn’t Dean. It can’t be.
He couldn’t figure out why at first. He kept pacing. His hand went to his pocket and pulled out his phone, almost of its own accord. The lock screen was free of notifications. It wasn’t even that late. But something made him unlock the phone and open his texts. He suddenly went very still, and sat on the bed again.
“You waiting for more vamps to show up?” Dean countered. He hoped his tone cut off whatever sentimentality Sam would try to pull.
"Well it's definitely the werewolf pack," Sam said. "The body wasn't there anymore when we went to investigate, but there were claw marks on the windowsill and around the room. Looked like a nasty fight."
“Well I’ll be walking the dog for him this week, so maybe I’ll see you again?” He was sure he managed to keep the hopeful tone out of his voice.
“No need to explain,” Dean cuts him off. His face is carefully neutral. He steps forward, just a little. “Why don’t I talk?”
It isn’t hot, not yet. It won’t be fully summer for a few weeks, but the sun is out and the breeze is minimal at best. Dean sits back on his heels and removes his gardening gloves to wipe the sweat from his forehead. “I could go for some lemonade,” he says. He rests his hands on his thighs and looks over at Cas. “Want some?”
Nearing the end of the hall, Cas can hear voices up ahead. He slows, unsure of what new torture will follow his interruption.
“I…” Cas didn’t seem to have any words. He reached out tentatively and touched Dean’s shoulder, where the hand print was covered by Dean’s clothes.
He was happy for them. It might take some adjusting if anything actually came of it, but it would be natural, in time. Maybe it was natural, now, and he’d just never put all the pieces entirely together. And Sam loved them both. And wanted them to be happy.
Cas watches him. Cas memorizes the way Dean moves to the bed, the way he fidgets like he can’t remember how to sit down, the way he finally orients himself, sitting stiffly beside Cas.
Those words had played and replayed in Dean’s head since Cas had spoken them. He’d been stunned. He’d wanted to respond, and when he replayed the scene in his mind he would sometimes change the ending to one where the empty hadn’t grabbed Cas away from him, and he’d been able to cross the space to Cas and hold him and assure him that
Jack nodded, turned his attention to the barrier in the distance. “I think people want to be together.”
“What’s the matter?” Dean asked, his brow furrowing ever so slightly. He studied Cas’ face, trying to parse those features he’d learned so well. He removed his hand from Cas’, reached out with both hands and cradled Cas’ face as he’d wanted to do the last time they spoke. “You don’t think you deserve to be saved?”
"He was normal," Cas said. "I had to leave early. Without Michael, there's fighting within Heaven, and I needed to go make sure the others weren't killing each other. Dean was fine when I left."
“Cas, can you hear me?” There still wasn’t an answer, but something about the stillness around him did seem to change. It was probably his imagination, but he decided to keep talking anyway. “Cas, you know you aren’t supposed to spring that kinda thing on a guy if you aren’t gonna stick around, right? You’re supposed to confess your love for someone and then give them a chance to react.” Dean took a steadying breath; if he stumbled over that last sentence, well, it’s not like anyone was listening anyway, right? He kept wandering. He kept rambling. “How long were you sitting on that anyway? How many times were we alone for a drive, or a movie, or a case, and you could have said something and let me answer you?” Okay, so he was definitely stumbling over his words at this point. He told himself it was because he was wandering through a void and his instincts were on high-alert for some kind of threat, and not because he was definitely thinking about the answers to his own questions - about how many times he might have had something to say to Cas if he’d only been a little braver. “It’s a lot, Cas. There were a lot of times.” Why the
The chains whined again as Castiel strained against them. “This is not your destiny, Dean Winchester.”
“I’m glad you’re back,” Jack says. He presses his face into Cas’ shoulder, and Cas’ heart breaks open.
“Bullshit.” Dean’s leaning further forward now, the concern on his face mingling with frustration and hurt. “You told me the Empty would take you when you were truly happy, right? Then you told me-” Dean cuts off and has to visibly reel in the emotion on his face. When he continues, his voice wavers, a vibrato so slight Cas only notices because of how much he’s listened to Dean speak. “You told me you love me. And you died for it. And now you can’t decide whether to look at me.” Dean shakes his head, but his eyes are locked on Cas’ despite the misty look in his eye. “What the fuck
While Sam prepared the mixture - he really had developed a knack for it since working with Rowena - Dean said his good-byes to Jack and Eileen. He’d never been good at that part, and he did like to think he’d be coming back with Cas in tow, but he figured he might as well cover all his bases, just in case.
“I’m not,” he said, perhaps too quickly if Selma’s expression is anything to go by. “I ate lunch with her two days ago.”
“That’s what I’m thinking,” Dean confirmed. “We’ve always had deals with Rowena and most of the time either Billie or Jesse handled it. But Libidine’s cut off communications and we can’t call Guttur out on their bullshit without risking losing their support. So instead we’re stuck outside city walls waiting for Naomi to realize we’ve lost the numbers and make her move.”
“What do you think?” Jo asked. Castiel knew she meant various raids that soldiers needed to defend against. They rarely ended well for resistance members. Jo’s dark expression let Castiel know that skilled as Dean’s people seemed to be, they weren’t immune to this phenomenon. “We’ve lost good people scrounging for food. We’re lucky that Dean talked us into a deal with Canada. Trust me, it hasn’t always been this easy, especially when even some of the rural areas aren’t exactly sympathetic to your cause.”
“She fell asleep. I think that’s a good sign,” Castiel said slowly, doing his best to keep the anger out of his voice. “I’m going now.”
“Your reputation as a light weight?” asked Jo, jumping up to dodge Charlie’s attempt to smack her arm. Jo grinned in triumph. “I’ll see you two tonight then. I should go make sure Dean’s not murdering anyone for being annoying.”
“You’re a miserable son of a bitch,” she said, letting go of his sleeve as she grew more and more lucid.
Dean’s face went quickly through a series of emotions, surprise being chief among them. He really thought Cas wouldn’t bring that up. That they were still playing a charade in which they acting like nothing was wrong.
Sometimes he recognized the voices. He heard Dean’s more than once, taking on a cadence that reminded Cas of when Charlie had spent the afternoon reading Harry Potter to him, and his words filled Cas’ mind with monsters and oceans and being a long, long way from home.
Dean had responded the same way every time: turn the music up a little louder. That didn’t change when Charlie was the one asking.
“Sure do, Sammy. Sure do,” says Dean. “I’m gonna go make sure Cas is doing okay with Claire and check in with Patience, if you wanted to-”
Sam swallows. He hadn’t really thought about Eileen having exes. Or dead exes. He doesn’t know why. It makes sense that she does, and hell knows he has his fair share (of the dead variety, too), but- Huh. It doesn’t bother him or anything, it just reminds him that, crazy as he is about her, they don’t know everything about each other yet. There’s a lot left to discover. And time to do it now, too. Which is why she won’t be dying any time soon, not if he can help it.
“So what you never thought about it?” Dean asks, still staring at the wall. Cas hates that he won’t look at him. “No best case scenario before you traded your life away to the fucking Empty, and never told me about it, in case you don’t remember that part.”
“My apologies,” Castiel said tonelessly. He tested the strength of the chair he was handcuffed to and was unsurprised to find it was metal. And bolted to the floor. “I didn’t mean to be an inconvenience.”
Cas felt a wall at his back and Dean’s fingers curling up into his hair, while his other hand rested on Cas’ uninjured hip. Cas awkwardly wondered if he should put his hands somewhere, and settled on copying Dean for lack of knowledge of how he was supposed to be doing this. Just as he felt he was getting a sense of how kissing was supposed to work, he felt Dean’s tongue press against his lips. His jaw dropped in surprise, and Dean stuck his tongue into his mouth.
“Hi Cas,” Kaia says, raising a hand in a small wave. Cas smiles back at her, though he knows from the stretch of muscles on his face he looks too tired to be very reassuring. He is a little surprised when Claire goes to him to pull him into a short hug.
Castiel looked up in vague confusion. Risa tended not to call him out unless he was doing something that needed correction.
They don’t kiss the first time it happens. Mary and Bobby are gone for date night, and Dean looks over to see that Cas missed a spot of grease from the shop when he took a shower earlier. He thinks about saying something, but he doesn’t, just keeps staring at it every once in a while. Cas is absorbed by the penguin documentary they’re watching.
“So you… You went to college in a brand new country for a guy?” Dean asks incredulously. Cas nods seriously.
“I feel like I should be offended by that,” muttered Anna. She tied another little figure into knots and let it walk on her hand, solidifying into a smaller version of herself before crumbling into dust. “Always a puppet, never a real girl.”
“He really was,” Cas said, stressing the pronoun slightly. The man in front of him visibly relaxed, and then sent Duma to settle them. There was something sick in the way that one detail had apparently made Cas so thoroughly unthreatening to Metatron. In the space of a few seconds, Cas had been able to track a shift in the man’s assessment of him. The idea that he was somehow less than a man because of something as simple as liking other men made him feel angry in ways he hadn’t been expecting. Sure, he had played into this to manipulate Metatron, but it didn’t change how restless the dismissal made him.
Balthazar followed Jo hesitantly, looking back at Cas as though to say he too was only going along with this because Cas had asked him to.
“Right, so Charlie is going to make sure you don’t do anything stupid,” Dean repeated at him. Jack crossed his arms a little petulantly, but nodded. “Rosali, you know what you’re doing right?”
“Anyway,” says Patience, tossing another wrapper onto the growing pile of discarded plastic between her and Claire. “We’ve got a few hours to kill and no functioning wifi so… let’s play twenty questions.”
She decides to opt for speed rather than stealth. Walking right past the stairwell, she takes the thankfully empty elevator down to the first floor and readies herself to make a break for it. As soon as the elevator doors are open, she sprints for the door. Halfway through the lobby her phone falls out of her pocket and for a split second she debates stopping to pick it up. Then the first shout comes from whoever is sitting behind the check out desk, and she books it, slamming herself through the front entrance at full speed.
“You’re saying I should get a little blood off mine too,” says Dean tonelessly. “Drop in the bucket, man.”
“Regardless,” said Mortimer. “I’d like your help in this matter. Anael did mention that you had a great desire to do what’s right. Somewhere, you must know that someone needs to clean up the mess when all is said and done.”
“Benny,” Castiel said, standing in front of him. He had to resort to shaking the captain to get his attention. Benny’s eyes finally focused on him, though the grief didn’t fade. Castiel knew the hallucinations didn’t go away once you realized they were hallucinations, but they certainly lost their power. If you could convince someone that their eyes were lying to them. “It’s not real. Whatever you think happened, it isn’t real.”
“Security clearance needed from the first floor,” said an automated voice. That was when Cas’ blood ran cold, and he let go of his hostage in shock. He barely even registered when she kicked him as she scrambled away. “Lockdown initiating.”
Dean winked at him and then went off to face Trisha in a wrestling match. Castiel missed the target completely on the next throw, and glared at Selma when she had the gall to giggle at him.
“I was under the influence of powerful drugs,” said Cas. “And actively fighting against their influence, and I still managed to get the upper hand.”
“Yeah, and I think he hated us too. Haven’t heard from him since I was sixteen. He turned up out of the blue to say he was proud of me for taking care of Sam and Mom, and then he disappeared. Someone’s still out there setting fires though,” Victor starts calling him again and Dean hangs up. Cas takes the phone from him and puts the ringer on silent. Dean pretends he’s not grateful. “You know this stays between us, right?”
“I’m assuming Gordon hasn’t heard this story,” muttered Kevin. “I don’t think he would like hearing you let his sister do anything in the realm of dangerous.”
“It’s kind of admirable,” says Sam, which lurches Dean out of his thoughts. “I wish… Eileen and I were taking things slow, y’know? After what happened with Chuck, we wanted to make sure. There were so many times I wish I had just… told her how I felt. Everything I felt. I wish the last thing she’d seen was that I loved her, and not me just asking her to fucking wait for us to get there.”
“C’mon babe. You gotta figure that one out for yourself,” said Dean. A mischievous glint lit up his eyes as he leaned forward to peck Cas on the lips. “But hey. A kiss for luck?”
Dean knows Michael didn’t have to protect Adam. Didn’t have to befriend him and care about him when Dean and Sam couldn’t (not because they didn’t want to, but because the world just never stopped ending). It should make him like Michael a little more, that he did that. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. There isn’t enough time left to figure that out, anyway.
“The one where Viola totally had a thing for Olivia. And Antonio definitely put the moves on Sebastian. You know, the way Shakespeare intended Twelfth Night to be seen,” said Charlie. Dean snorted and Charlie glared at him. “If you want to argue about this, I can go and get Wendy.”
“Don’t,” says Cas. His voice betrays more emotion than he probably meant to, which is what Dean is looking for. “You will not make me feel ashamed. Not of what I did and not of what I said.”
“Dagon,” Azazel spoke up, causing the woman to instantly pause. “You’ll have time to play with the mouse later. I’m finished with you for now.”
They took their time eating him alive. They started with his stomach, and worked their way out, leaving only his throat in tact so his screams never stopped.
“I know you regret what happened to Mary. I know it was an accident and you want to take it back,” says Cas gently. “If that’s the choice you’re making I’m happy you’ll get the chance to right something that weighs on you. But it’s not going to- You can’t win forgiveness like that. You’ll hurt yourself trying.”
“Never gonna do that, sunshine,” he agrees, leaning forward for a long lingering kiss. It sparks something in Cas, a moment of experiencing, of living. It is gone the next second, out of reach for now, but it was there. And he’ll keep looking for it, as long as he knows how. He still finds in Dean everything he wants in a person, in a partner, in a home. It is only sometimes he finds himself too far away to feel the warmth of it. He hopes one day whatever it is that takes him, that keeps him from his happiness will have fled and he can bask in the life he wants without interruption.
Patience had pretended to fall asleep about three minutes ago. Claire guesses she’d probably seen this coming. The attempt at giving Claire a little privacy is worth something, even if it’s not so convincing. Still, she has to talk about it some time or other. Better with the idiots in the back seat than dumping her baggage on Jody. Again. Not like she only just got through what losing Kaia did to her, and only because Kaia came back.
“There’s an easy and a hard way to do this,” the older one pointed out, taking out what looked to be a taser. Castiel looked at it, then back at the soldier.
Castiel decided he couldn’t make sense of it, and since it wasn’t relevant to his mission there was no reason to put as much mental energy towards it as he was.
Rowena joins Sam where he’s sitting, her eyes averted. It’s unlike her, waiting for him to get the first word in. He knows what she wants him to ask her.
Dean frowned at him, eyes squinting as though he didn’t quite know what to make of Cas, and he wasn’t sure whether or not that was a good thing.
“Not in most people,” she concedes. Both of them spare a glance for Dean at the same instant, and Sam can’t help the laugh that he barks out at that. Not least of all because Dean is so focused on Cas he doesn’t seem to be following the conversation.
“I don’t like him either,” said Jo. “Not a ton of people do. Well, except Kubrick, not that that’s much of an endorsement. The thing is we do need him.”
“That was before I got mixed up with the resistance outreach in Acedia. I was fifteen and Dad made it pretty clear after a while that he expected me to get involved. And hell, I wanted to. I was itching to finally do something, be someone, die for the cause. It was better than dying in one of those tiny rooms,” said Dean humorlessly. “But instead, by the time I was eighteen my old man ended up taking a few rounds in the chest and I ended up in a state prison. I thought I knew what summer was like. Knew it inside and out, but that was before I was shoved into some hole in the ground with twenty people to a cell and maybe water every couple of days. If the guards liked you.”
Corbett chewed his lip nervously, cast glances around and then nodded slowly. Maggie breathed a sigh of relief.
Once he reached the door, Benny helped drag Dean to his feet and pulled an arm over his shoulder. Cas did the same on the other side, finally understanding what was happening. Or at least understanding enough to keep putting one foot in front of the other. He needed to get Dean out of this basement. The objective hadn’t changed, it had just grown a little more challenging. Like one of Anna’s obstacle courses. Castiel could do this one damned thing. He could get Dean Winchester out of the basement.
