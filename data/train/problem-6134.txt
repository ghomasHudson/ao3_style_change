Silence hung between them, waiting for something to give about the raft. Either for Ross to pull out concrete evidence that Tony had knowingly denied the call to help Rogers and them get away, or Tony was going to reveal Rogers gave him means to contact him. Nothing happened, and Tony just raised his eyebrows, waiting for Ross to move past the bullshit and just accuse him or move on. Fortunately, Ross moved on.
“Yes.” Sherlock had reached his decision before this whole mess. And while said mess had disrupted the overall plan, it didn’t change his mind. “But the matter is far less complicated than yours…”
Perhaps, had he had alcohol or had he not been so fucking desperate, Tony might have been suave about it. But he just stood, blocking Steve’s path, swallowing hard. “Fuck me.”
Sleep soon overcame him, and it had been the first night Tony slept without morning sickness waking him at odd hours of the night.
“I’m. Sorry,” Tony opened his eyes, pining the older man with an intense gaze now. “What about me implies I want to help the son of a bitch who kicked my ass the day I learned my
“Alright. Now leave me the fuck alone, Rhodey’s coming home soon and I need to have his leg braces ready. And
“Summers wouldn’t let him.” Tony told him. “X-Men are peaceful, they’re keeping things… civil. Using the court to fight back. And Summers knows Logan’s wanted right now, so he wouldn’t risk him coming out of hiding.”
Leaning back in his chair, Tony laid an arm across his waist and covered his mouth with his free hand. It had become a staple position which served as protecting himself and the child. His child. God, he had to stop playing the disassociation game if he was going to keep it. What was the saying? Fathers didn’t become fathers until they hold their child? Guess Howard never learned to pick him up. Wincing, Tony shook his head. No, that wasn’t fair. His hormones were acting up; he was throwing aggression to anyone. To dead people, mainly. Because they couldn’t fight back. Yet Tony was the one feeling the blows, the one forcing air in and out of his chest as he tried to block it out.
they didn’t need to. As they both turned for another visual sweep, both suits began to beep, flashing a warning in front of the occupants eyes.
Another moment of tense silence, Steve’s blue eyes flicking between Tony’s trying to find the lie, the joke. But it wasn’t there. Holding his breath, Tony watched his past self and Steve, watched as something shifted in Steve’s gaze and he pushed Tony down onto the bed, climbing on top of him. He should stop, he should shut it down, turn the glasses off. But he couldn’t. Just
Pocketing the phone, he jogged to the stairs, moving down to the workshop and waving his hand to clear the smoke that billowed out of the open doors. Vision was already inside, handing a mask to Sherlock so he didn’t asphyxiate. “Sherlock!
hit him. Hard. Hard enough to send him across the room, toppling over the chairs. It would have been perfect and bitter sweet if
. Water was running somewhere, and it didn’t register Sherlock had turned the shower on before a cold towel was wrapped around his entire chest, water rolling down and dampening his pants. But it brought him back. Finally managing to sit up, knees pressed to his chest, Tony pulled the soaking wet towel around him, shocking himself out of the attack. “This isn’t going to be a constant thing, right?”
Whenever either Stark made to fire a flare or a gun, the metal restraints tightened, taking out the weapon systems on their arms. The metal around their necks began to tighten as well, both suits sparking under the pressure.
Steve tried to kill him. The words, a product of his anxiety twisting and morphing the situation into the worst possible scenario, echoed in his head now; it burned there in the forefront of his mind. Steve went for the kill. Steve wanted him dead.
“I told you before that I would leave your ass on hold because I like to watch the light blink.” Tony reminded him, getting up now and facing the Secretary at equal level. After everything, Tony was getting sick of people talking down to him. In any respect. “Unless you have some substantial evidence that I
After a low grumble and something that sounded like an insult, Tony sat down and stared at his food with a grimace. Sherlock watched him, lips pressed together as he began composing a list of possible arguments he could use to get Tony to resort his eating habits. If he had to rethink his eating habits. Blinking, Sherlock moved around the counter to take the stool beside him, expression softening as Tony hesitantly began to eat.
, where Steve’s whole bedroom was still left, pristine as the rogue boy scout left it. But his options were limited and at least here he could spend time with Rhodes. And tell him. Sherlock had been flown to the compound shortly after Pepper had texted him, and the younger Stark had little trouble settling back into the living arrangement. Tony had made the mistake of forgetting Sherlock had practically lived with Logan two floors up. “Abso-fucking-lutely not.”
“And if Logan ever knew, he’d have my ass on a pike.” He returned to eating his salad, shaking his head.
The mutant moved closer, and Sherlock struggled against the restraints, breath coming faster and faster as the outlook began to look more and more bleak. He wasn’t going to escape, the mutants were going to tear him apart, tear his child apart for defending a cause he didn’t even
Steve reflects on his and Tony's tumultuous relationship and what Tony really means to him in the face of disaster.
“An’ before you shut me down, as you so… often do, we’re in your bedroom. Doesn’ get more private than this. Well, until you figure out I got a camera up there.” Tony gestured with that sly little grin, soon followed by a playful giggle when Steve tossed his shirt at him. “I’m joking. I would just hack your webcam whenever you visited a porn site. What do you use? Pornhub? Tube8? Don’t tell me Spankwire, Rogers, or--”
Circling around, the present Tony moved to the other side of the bed so he could see over his own shoulder, wanting to see the pictures again. Waiting rather impatiently until his memory self found the exact thing he wanted to see again. A drawing of himself, towel hung low enough on his hips that dark curls and the base of a slightly erect cock could be seen. Both Tonys blushed, and the one on the bed snapped the book shut before both sets of eyes were on Rogers. Of course the man was avoiding Tony as he grabbed a fresh towel from the closet and moved towards the door.
Silence fell between them, and was slowly broken by Tony returning to his breakfast. Sherlock didn’t expect his brother to have an answer, but they did have a limited time to consider all options. He simply didn’t want Tony to get four months into this, six months, two years, however long, and regret it. But he didn’t push. They had a few weeks still. Tony cleared his throat, pushing a mostly empty plate away and checking his phone. “I have a meeting with Ross today. Might go to the compound after, check in on Rhodey and Vision.”
fault. Clint had a family to think of. Wanda didn’t deserve to be locked up. Sam just followed Steve into the worst of it. He couldn’t punish them for Steve’s wrong doing.
“Mr. Holmes was callibratin’ his weapons system in the lab, sir.” The woman explained over the intercom, and Tony ignored how he had sprung for the phone at the first thought of trouble. “Deploying fire extinguishers now.”
“Think you can figure it out? See, you gotta put that on your fingers and then--” Before he could finish, Steve dragged Tony back to the bed, straddling his legs as he sat up and ripped the lube packet open after some trouble. But soon slick fingers were pressed inside of Tony, and both versions of himself let out a soft gasp, but the one on the bed was dragged out into a harsh, wanting moan. Begging for more. “
That was it. Those were the words he needed more than he had realized and Tony sucked in another sharp breath. Sherlock had won. The bastard. Sighing, Tony just nodded and returned to eating his salad. “First sign of a situation turning bad, you get the fuck out. You
you have no idea where Rogers and Barnes went? We worked too fucking hard to let them get away this easy, Tony.”
I still love this story. I'm still writing this story in my pockets of inspiration. Thank you so much for your undying patience.
to have something ready for you when you woke. It’s not bad; I’ve already had a plate. You need to eat, Anthony.”
Steve? Before Lagos? Before the airport? What if he had just come out and said it, would this have gone differently? Maybe. But then it would have gone differently because Steve would have felt bad for the damn fetus and it still would have nothing to do with Tony.
” Erik announced, hovering above Tony and Sherlock. “They create suits to be like you, and the world cheers. Yet you were born with these gifts, these powers, and they would rather muzzle you! Register you and watch you. Strip you of your freedom. You are the danger, while these two men with their fully weaponized suits protect the
That granted him a small huff, some of the tension dispelling between them, but Sherlock knew it did little to help Tony. “Got a whole fucking lists of reasons
When the kiss broke, Tony stood across from the two of them, breath caught in his throat. He knew what happened next, but he was living in the moment again, taken with Steve as he so often was in their moments alone. His memory broke the silence, but tripled the tension as those words reentered the air, but this time they were vulnerable, pleading.
?” Tony rolled his eyes, forcing himself to sit up and closing his eyes as if that would stop the wave of nausea. “You’re the one who pulled me out of a well-deserved nap, sir. If this is about the reception at the base, I’m having it looked at, but you know how the internet companies are. Between the hours of eight and eight.”
Oh, fuck. Steve was from a time where terminating a pregnancy was seriously bad. Fuck, and if Steve ever found out Tony went through with that without even telling him… But how would he
Wanting to argue, but understanding there wasn’t time, Sherlock just lifted his hands and targeted the device as it swept into view. He had gotten off a repulsor blast just before one of the metal barricades was rushing towards him, knocking him off balance. Around him, frightened mutants and protestors began to scatter, while some were emboldened by the attack on the armed peacekeepers and took the advantage to rush a fallen Sherlock. As he moved to get up, the same metal barricade splintered, long bits of pipe wrapping around his wrists and ankles, slamming into the ground and keeping him there, spread out for any attack.
this kid, I’m still up in the air about mine.” When Sherlock didn’t respond, Tony looked at him again, brown eyes boring into him. “
“You can’t have coffee.” A cup of tea was put on the island bar beside Tony’s plate, soon followed by a fork. “I haven’t exactly ever made my own food before, but I was
“Get a fucking condom.” Tony huffed from the present, knowing it would do no good. The damage was already done. As if in retaliation, his stomach cramped, nausea washing over him. The kid didn’t like to be thought of as damage. Cheeky little shit…
he had done it. The moment they arrested those sided with Steve, he had blocked Logan’s number and deleted it. If there was any contact, if there was
Logan expertly, or perhaps daftly, ignored that. His tactic had been annoyance and pestering, and he ended his troubles with a grin and a kiss followed by a quiet ‘You can’t annoy a machine.’
“Watson.” Sherlock panted, eyes wide in terror as he looked around at the oncoming mutants, powerless. “Watson,
was, still pregnant by that very same idiot. He had known a few weeks before Lagos, before this whole mess but he had said nothing. After so much time, however, he was certain Logan would also question his hesitance. Why breech the subject when he still hadn’t an explanation?
, he thought dryly, turning his head to rest his forehead against the tile. The door to the master bathroom opened and Tony barely had the energy to roll his head back the other way to see who it was. Not like there were many options. Pepper had left after Tony had admitted to his one night affair; Vision stayed at the compound to wait for Wanda to come back; Friday would have announced Rhodes’ presence. His brother stood there, his ex-partners shirt hanging limply from his frame. A second Stark child must have been too much for their parents, Tony didn’t sit around and try to understand their reasoning, but the fact of the matter was Sherlock had been sent to London and adopted by a mildly wealthy family. After observing the plentiful news resources regarding Tony and the Avengers, Sherlock’s uncanny likeness to the billionaire couldn’t be ignored. So there he was, and Tony was in no state to turn people- to turn
had managed to hit him hard enough to cause a miscarriage. Maybe the fact the kid was resilient enough to survive something like that was a reason to consider going through with this. Fuck, what if he had
The older brother laughed, a shiver beginning to rock his body. He was coming down from the fever. Rapidly. Sluggishly, he pulled the towel off of him, dropping it in the corner of the shower with a sickly wet ‘slop’ sound. Sherlock was already there with a dry towel, gently working it over his skin as Tony sighed. “What are we going to do, Sherly?”
His hand moved to the phone, eyes staring at it without really seeing as he spun it across the surface of his desk. The words were almost too sweet to be true. And Tony was so far gone, so beaten that he knew better- he
Lifting his head from his salad, Tony threw his younger brother a look. He didn’t want to go back to Malibu, not when Pepper had texted him saying she was coming in and moving her things out. And he really didn’t want to be
“Maybe,” Tony took the tea mug as he stood just to appease the other man. “I’ll call ya when I get to the compound, see if there’s anything you can do to help. You okay here by yourself?”
Their sounds of pleasure were now completely filling the room and Steve was distantly glad that it was sound proof, because neither of them were holding back one bit.
Acceptance is the most peculiar of feelings, time suddenly slowed and a strange sense of calmness overpowered the fear and pain that previously had hold of him.
The transmission then went deathly silent as the team stood unmoving in stunned apprehension while the second ticked by. All of a sudden, the camera slowly started to pan right, and Steve drew in a harsh shaky breath at the view it brought.
“Finally, decided to join us again have you sleeping beauty?” and for a moment, Tony couldn’t place the voice, couldn’t recall where he was... Then he heard the unmistakable crack of a whip just a millisecond before he felt it connect with the skin of his back.
“We’re very close to tracking this signal now,” Fury said from the screen with confidence, “We've narrowed the location down further with each transmission, hopefully this one will give us a lock.”
Now laying on the ground once again, Tony took the opportunity to curl up as small as possible in a subconscious effort to disappear all together. The drugs he was just pumped full of appeared to take effect and be began to feel light and dizzy. Tears suddenly came unbid to his eyes as he lay there wishing he was home, wishing with all his heart to be far away from this place, safe at home, safe with Steve...
Steve held on tight to Tony and poured all the emotion, all the feelings he held for Tony into that first kiss, and
so here's the deal, I'll give you just enough time to say your last words to him, and that's just about all I can manage... alright?” his captor said, right before sinking the blade to the hilt into Steve's side.
It took time, and it took a lot of adjustment, but Tony slowly became less jumpy, less drawn in on himself, began to smile and laugh and joke again,- that's not to say there wasn't still healing to do, but Tony was making leaps and bounds where that was concerned.
And that instant, Steve grasped Tony's shoulders and gently drew him back to look straight into his eyes. He placed his hands softly to the sides of Tony's face and carefully wiped away the tears that were there with all the affection he could pour into the gesture, “it’s real darling, I'm here, I'm right here....” Steve whispered, heart clenching from the pain and sadness he could see displayed so clearly on Tony's face.
Tony still hadn’t appeared even a few days after that night but when he eventually did, he was in full Stark reset mode, strutting into the common room all smiles, pleasantries and emotional guard right up as it happens.
“Talk to me Steve,” she said shaking her head and placing his hands into hers, and how does she do that?! Somehow she has such a calming effect and Steve couldn’t help but smile just a little at knowing how lucky he was to not only work with such a formidable woman, but to have her as his friend.
Tony begged as his legs finally gave out underneath him and he fell crashing to his knees. Steve was there,
Your Captain is clearly the driving force of the Avengers, he holds your group together and he’s damn good at it... too good. But I'm going to shatter him and end the Avengers once and for all, I'm going to destroy your Captain by breaking the thing he loves most, I'll make him watch as you suffer, as you slowly fall apart, as you beg and plead for mercy... I'll make him see the second you snap and he fails to save you, I'll make him watch helpless to stop me, I'll break his heart by crushing
“Guys I’ve got him, we’re coming out now- Clint, Natasha can you cover our exit, we’ll take the front side entrance, Bruce set the jet down ASAP – Tony needs medical attention, Clint can take over with flight once we’re on,” Steve commanded with urgency. He heard no response through his comm but he was certain that that his instructions were heard and he was completely confident that his team would follow them, he trusted them with his life- but now he also had to trust them with Tony's.
he loves you Steve, and you love him, it’s the only truth that matters, and it’s not too late. We’ll get him back and we’ll guide him to recovery,- we can do this Steve, we’re his family – and we’ll help him through this.”
it’s ok- you’re safe, you’re in the S.H.I.E.L.D medical, you’re safe now,” Steve said thinking to reassure Tony as soon as possible.
The next time Tony had woken it was with an abrupt cry as he instantly attempted to scramble way from the nurses who were checking his vitals,- but Steve was right there, talking to Tony, holding him close and bringing him back from his nightmares. And this happened many times through Tony's recovery, and each time Steve would be there, right there with him to ground him- as he vowed to
Again, he looked toward the steady red light glowing at the side of the room and decided he might as well get this cluster fuck of a show on the road, you need to know who you're dealing with and what they want in order to plan how to get away from them.
he was alive, and Steve would help him through this, help him heal and help him to be happy. Steve would be by his side- every step of the way.
Steve exhaled at the flood of emotions and tried to concentrate on cleaning up Tony's arm, it would do no good to slip now and cause more damage. He removed all the shards of glass and proceeded with cleaning and bandaging up the wounds which thankfully were not bleeding too heavily now.
After the feed showing Tony being submerged in the water had gone dark, there was no contact from the captors till the following night, a whole 26 hours of not knowing, only hoping that he’d survived till they decided to send the next transmission.
Steve knew this relatively quiet spell the city was going through wouldn’t last long and as if his thoughts had jinxed that calm, the Avengers received news of an attack.
or some sort of excuse leaving Steve to wonder what was going on with the genius, he had gotten so used to Tony actually being around that he keenly noticed this strange absence.
“This is not a joke Tony, and if you’d followed my orders in the first place this wouldn't have happened!” Steve couldn't hold back, recalling how he’d ordered Tony to fall back during the fight, though the second it left his mouth be knew it was the wrong way to go about this.
Steve emitted inpatients clutching the table behind him to steady himself. Another screech of pain suddenly flooded through the speakers and the tension in the room hit unbearable,- Steve could feel the blood rush to his ears and his breathing quickened in fear because- that was Tony's voice, dear God that was
Steve smiled as he felt the usual warmth and affection that would blossom in his chest each and every time he looked at Tony. He was so absorbed in his work, tongue adorably poking out in concentration that he hadn't even heard or seen Steve approach. All of the bruises and cuts Tony sustained had healed and faded away nicely, though the damage caused by the whip would most likely leave marks that may be permanent, - Steve was just glad that Tony couldn't see those so easily, not if he didn't want to, the last thing he needed we a constant reminder of what he'd been through.
He looked across to where Tony lay, and God he looked so pale, so hurt. He was attached to another IV drip and various other bleeping machines monitoring his progress. A nurse was just finishing up with the equipment and walked over towards them all standing at the door.
Whilst Tony was clearly out from being drugged, his captors had managed to hall him up and he was once again suspended by the arms and forced to stand on unsteady legs.
Steve’s whole body jumped when suddenly he heard his name called in the most painful of cries,- looking up again through worn out eyes to the screen he loudly released another sorrowful sob, the Steve on the screen was now clearly dead, and Tony’s cries were more than he could bear, those cries would stay with him for the rest of his life.
Tony was now fully panting, licking his lips he shook his head and studied the water closely in front of him. The man in front of him then stretched out his arm bringing the bottle within inches of Tony and started to slowly tip the water into the floor.
it’s honestly me- you’re not dreaming, I didn't die Tony, that wasn't me- that other guy the captors killed- it wasn't me....!” Steve told him desperately. Tony breathed long and deep and just stared brokenly into Steve's eyes, and Steve- for the life of him, couldn't even guess if Tony had understood, let alone heard what Steve had said, he just stared as if he was still caught in that moment when Steve had died in front of him. Tony then suddenly looked away as his eyes slowly closed and he began to slip into unconsciousness.
“I knew you would understand this dichotomy, I suppose I could call it,” Bruce says. “Feeling like you’re something more than yourself but cursing it because it isn't always something you want.”
If anyone was watching this from the outside they might have mistaken them for a team, but nothing could be further from the truth. They’re all standing next to each other but they’re not together at all.
His right hand is holding his phone up in front of his face, camera pointed at the natural show happening in front of him, and he’s fiddling with the camera settings of his Stark Industries prototype phone trying to find the best exposure and angle to take a picture.
He’s doing a valiant effort of petting all of them while at the same time trying to salvage his t-shirt from the firm grip U has on it, but he quickly gives up on the second task and just lets the bot stretch it as far as it will go.
There are a thousand thoughts, and a million contradictions, and a hundred voices, and a billion feelings. Tony can hear Rhodey’s voice encouraging him and Natasha unknowingly begging him to do better than her. Tony remembers a dozen failures he made with Pepper and he tries to suppress the memories of every time he’s been let down or has disappointed someone himself.
Steve is still looking at him like this is the first time he’s seeing him, like Tony is a stranger he doesn’t recognize.
Steve and Pepper go silent again as they start eating their food and Steve’s grateful for the break in the conversation because it gives him time to order his ideas and make sense of what he has heard Pepper say.
Steve looks almost glowing with the sun shining from in front of him, but his face is anything but peaceful or content at the moment. There’s a deep frown set in his expression, harsh lines he didn’t use to have when Tony first met him grooving his face.
Steve can’t say life gets back to normal after that because the old normal used to mean not having Tony with them, but little by little they all start building a new normal together.
It’s only when they’re already standing in front of Steve’s door that Tony notices they haven’t stopped holding hands since they got up from the couch. The realization makes Tony hyper-aware of the feel of Steve’s hands on his now. Steve’s palm and his fingertips are surprisingly soft and Tony feels a pang of self-consciousness. His own hands are rough and calloused from years of manual labour and it’s been a long time since he’s made efforts to pamper them or anything resembling a care routine.
He turns his head towards Steve and Steve still can’t look away from him. There’s a glint in Tony’s eyes and Steve thinks it might be tears.
“That would just mean I’d make things more interesting, then,” Tony tells all of them. “I’m honestly feeling betrayed, Honeybear.”
Feeling like it’s what he has to do -and too full of pent-up energy to go to sleep- Tony waits up for Pepper doing some idle work on his tablet. He’s got three different projects open on his device: one for Steve, one for Natasha and another one for Bruce.
But Tony’s complain gets swallowed by Steve’s mouth, proving to be the most effective distraction. Tony’s hands rest against Steve’s back and take a fist of his own t-shirt (the one that the soldier is wearing) when Steve bites his lips particularly hard and makes him see sparks under his eyelids.
“No, I meant the comment, I didn’t—” Tony stops himself in the middle of the sentence, opting to move on from the explanation he was trying to give. He wishes there was something else he could do but he knows there isn’t any escaping this conversation or this situation now. The time has come to face it head on. “I’m sorry”
“Stop it!” Tony begs in between breathless laughs once Steve has introduced tickling him into the equation.
“Clint, man, this is not something we can just make go away,” Tony explains from his position on the couch next to Steve. “And we all know this is just a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit, anyway. I doubt it will have strong, negative repercussions. But it can’t be swept under the rug, not even with the world in this state.”
Just as a waiter is bringing them their first dishes both Steve’s and Tony’s phones ping with an Avengers’ distress signal and they leave the place after paying but without actually having been able to eat anything.
Tony wakes up to a full-out screaming match between Natasha and Clint. Tony has never seen Natasha raise her voice so much even if he has seen her raging in anger and quaking with fear. He can’t make out her words from behind his closed bedroom door but she sounds desperate and on edge.
Steve’s the last one to exit the building so he’s the one closing the door behind him. He then turns back to Tony and looks on as Tony blows into his hands, trying to warm them up with his breath.
“I thought you had a group session,” Tony says, moving his gaze away from Steve’s figure when looking at him becomes too much, but his eyes can’t find a point in the room to settle on.
“You don’t need to build me anything because I can very much just buy it,” Steve counters back, extending his arm and placing his hand on Tony’s cheek. He uses his hand to bring Tony’s face closer to him and kisses Tony softly.
“Okay, smart ass, whatever.” Bucky sat on Steve’s bed while Steve rummaged through his closet for some jeans and a thick, wool sweater. “We’re having a snow war!”
“But there is another reason I haven’t visited him. The same reason I hadn’t talked to you about any of this and the reason I close up every time my therapist wants to talk about anything that has to do with the Decimation. I thought if I didn’t talk about it maybe it wouldn’t come true,” Steve confesses. “It seems illogical because it’s always been true but… If I didn’t say it maybe one day I’d wake up and everything would be back to normal.”
He’s never talked to any of them about this before but he knows this is one more thing all the Avengers carry. It’s one more thing they all share. They’ve built themselves up from everything they’ve ever had to see and do and think, and most everyone thinks them strong for it but in the end it also makes them more vulnerable.
“I’m glad I have the others,” Steve clarifies. “I’m glad none of us are alone but… You’re my rock, Tony. Maybe it isn’t fair to put that on you but I needed you to know. I needed to thank you. I’ve learned my lesson about being open about my feelings and doing it at the right time.”
Tony nods and almost lets out a sigh of relief. He would have talked if that was what Steve needed but it feels good knowing he can forget about things a little bit for the night. Everything will still be there in the morning tomorrow so a little overnight avoidance won’t hurt anyone or change anything for the worse.
Steve’s not shouting, he hasn’t even raised his voice above a normal tone of conversation, but Tony can hears his voice clearly and perfectly. Maybe if there had been any other sounds he wouldn’t have been able to but the Compound is eerily silent these days, especially at night, when Tony sometimes swears he can hear everyone’s breaths as they try to futilely fall asleep because that’s a thing they all perfectly share nowadays, the crippling insomnia.
They’re still so close they’re almost breathing into the other’s mouths but Steve doesn’t feel strong enough to separate just yet.
His eyes are trained forward on some indistinctive point across the lake where a slight breeze rattles the leaves of some trees. His attention is trying to memorize Peter’s face as it smiled at him in his latest dream and simultaneously trying to erase any and every image of it.
He knows he won’t die and yet he thinks he will. He knows it’s not real and yet there’s never been anything more real than this.
And it speaks about his situation and his relationship with Steve that that is nothing but the complete truth.
Steve shakes his head, amused, and gestures magnanimously towards the ice cream, letting Tony continue eating from it first. The ice cream is a little more melted now, not as perfect in density as it was before, but Tony doesn't even notice that much. And the part of him that does notice doesn't care. He’d even consider saying it was worth it, if pressed.
It’s incredible how this is the first time Tony has seen Steve look so still. Of the two of them no one would think of Steve as the restless and anxious one, but the truth is Steve has just as much of a problem with being motionless as Tony. His eagerness is less obvious than Tony’s and it sometimes just comes across in the micro-movements of his face.
He only needs to look at the three people in front of him once to know that they’re all aware already of what he’s going to so. It’s written plainly in their expressions, in the way Bruce’s smile is sorrowful, in the way Natasha is biting her bottom lip to stop it from trembling. It’s quite obvious in the way Steve’s face looks soft, almost sweet. He’s not radiating pity, or sadness back at Tony and that’s probably what gives him strength.
His psychologist would be proud of him for being able to recognize that he was just in as much need of support as Steve was. But life-long instincts to ignore his own feelings and hard-wired desire of helping the ones he cares about above everything else are hard to get rid of.
“You know it isn’t fair how well you look when I look like this.” Tony gestures vaguely to his own body.
Only a few weeks ago Rhodey gave him and uncomplicated answer: Yes. And for a little while Tony  believed him. He wants Steve. At this point, he knows Steve wants him too. It was better to try and fail than never try at all. And oh, what they could become if they didn’t fail….
Since the Decimation happened, the Avengers -or what’s available and left of them- haven’t been needed to fight or protect the Earth, too damaged and affected to really be a beacon for any kind of show of strength or power, and whatever little troubles they’ve gone through have been easily handled by official authorities around the world or small-time superheroes that Tony trusts and has let be during this time.
They’re supposed to help each other. And that means that, some times, things are going to get ugly and difficult for one of them and the other will have to dirty himself up to push the other one through.
He kept in touch with all of them one way or another and Steve still, at times, consulted him in certain aspects of their roles, even if in the end he mostly went with his own pre-set decisions instead of taking many of Tony’s indications into consideration.
Clint doesn't stop by the living room when he exists Thor’s room, and FRIDAY informs them all that he’s made it back to his own room and has asked not to be disturbed.
Tony wonders in amazement if there will ever come a day when this man won’t manage to surprise him anymore. He’s not perfect, Tony knows he’s nowhere near that, but he tries so hard, and he gives everything he’s got to the things he deems worthy. Tony can’t quite comprehend the luck he’s had that Steve’s decided he’s one of those worthy causes, but he won’t ever take it for granted.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can, I’ll just shower and make a couple of calls and then I’ll be back,” Rhodey repeats.
He feels mostly like a third wheel seated across from both Pepper and Rhodey -as the man asked Steve to call him- and he doesn't contribute much to the conversation. It’s so obvious they both have know each other for such a long time and that they have a deep and true bond, and above all it makes Steve sadder and lonelier to watch them.
There’s no other way to say it but by saying that Tony simply gives up. He gives up his stupid anger over being known and understood and recognized. He gives up trying to pretend he hasn’t grown to need Steve again. He gives up trying to pretend like he ever stopped needing him.
It’s something that has stayed unspoken for a long time and finally starts to whisper its way to life.
Steve thinks it’s funny and sweet that Tony is always so excited to share Steve’s little hobby with him even if he knows there’s a certain air of ridiculousness to it, as Bucky and Sam always make sure to remind him.
Steve pays attention to the movies playing from second one of the first one until the last of the credits rolls on the second one. He’s sitting right next to Tony, sharing a beanbag with him that Tony thinks must be very expensive in order to be this comfortable.
His knees shake a little as he gets out of bed but Tony pushes through it, desperately needing to leave this bed, this room, this space that only suffocates him.
Tony shakes his head a little bit as Steve responds to his comment but he hasn’t heard what Steve has just said and Steve is looking back at him questioningly.
But just because he goes to bed earlier than he’s ever gone to bed before except for his early childhood doesn’t mean his sleep is better. It doesn’t mean peace finds him as his head rests on the pillow.
Tony’s also pretty well acquainted with ending things that are meant to be over, so he only nods and accepts her answer.
As the number of tears become impossible to count Tony’s touch becomes more purposeful, soft caresses that run through Steve’s blonde hair and that serve to remind him he’s not floating away. This touch is the only useful thing he can provide right now, a slice of comfort, a glimpse of peace.
Tony moves his right arm to wrap it around her shoulders and Pepper uses one of her legs to move it over his.
Natasha’s voice is commandeering but somehow it is also soft, affection clinging to the edge of her words.
Steve looks earnest and in the early morning light the compliment hits Tony a little more intensely than it normally would. Knowing Steve felt comforted by his mere presence -even when he wasn’t actively working to help- is an honor Tony never knew would be this great to hold.
“Tony, I’m going to need you to focus…,” Steve demands and Tony’s anger starts making its way through the grief, gaining more and more space in his brain until all he can see are images of before, of a red, white and blue suit, of a shield headed his way.
Steve and Rhodey are able to spend less time together but they quickly create a connection in the way only people with similar experiences can, in a way that Steve’s only been able to create with fellow soldiers. They spar together and Rhodey never minds the fact that Steve can always beat him, saying it’s improving his skills better than any other kind of fighting could. They drink and laugh together and, every once in a while, they whisper to each other about the sleepless nights and the memories.
Natasha is trying to hide her crying face but her proximity to Tony and the desperate grip her hands have on the back of his suit jacket mean she’s not trying to hide completely from him.
Tony doesn’t hesitate before doing so, knowing that his body has been particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures since his trip in space.
Steve tries to smile reassuringly but he can feel how weak the smile he’s showing really is. His lips are trembling and he feels a twitch in his right cheek from the awkwardness of it. He winds up biting his bottom lip to stop it from showing his nerves.
“I knew Tony better than anyone in the world except maybe Rhodey,” Pepper starts and Steve frowns lightly in confusion. “This past few years… Being Iron Man... It meant the world to him. He finally felt like he had found his calling.”
There’s nothing else to say between them for now, at least not for a few more minutes. The moment has pretty much spoken for itself.
The potential was always there, simmering under the surface and just waiting to be set free and explored. Steve believes they all felt it in their veins, that current that connected them, but none of them knew exactly what it meant.
Tony’s never been big on celebrating Christmas, not even when his parents were alive, and it hasn’t been something that’s ever troubled him. Yet this year it feels like something inside him is ripped apart at the idea of not being able to do so. It feels like he’s being stripped of something precious: the opportunity to share the day with all the people they’re missing.
“The world is more complicated than ever. It’s also sadder than ever,” Steve keeps talking, oblivious to the way his words are causing an unraveling inside of Tony. “But we mustn’t forget that it is still a world worth fighting for. It’s a world worth living in and I want all of you to remind yourselves of that every day. It’s been a year since the Decimation, a year of very dark days and nights. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, we just have to keep pushing through. Thank you everyone for coming. Let’s share a minute of silence for everyone we wish could be here with us today and who, hopefully, will be here with us again.”
The action proves to be irrelevant when Tony turns to look at Rhodey and it’s obvious he’s not entirely aware of his surroundings yet. He’s still more asleep than awake and he’s squinting his eyes in the direction of the now blank screen.
“So what is?” Steve asks. He sounds resigned, like he already knows the answer to his own question but he doesn't want it said out loud.
Thinking back on it brings a deep nostalgia to him, a sense of bewilderment at the thought that he never could have predicted caring this much about a kid that he met almost by accident, simply because he was so very bad at hiding his secret identity.
Although that might not be the reason why the others are staring quite so intently, because Steve’s shirt is actually
because “I think you’re going to love it, Steve, I really do” he had been so sure that he’d finally best Steve as he had refuted his choice by nominating
It’s getting to show Tony his favorite things from his own era without feeling like he wants to rip his heart out of his chest.)
Steve’s voice is interrupted by the recovery room’s door opening and the sight of Pepper walking through it, a tablet in her hands.
Steve points to the kitchen. “You take the pizzas to the living room and I’ll get some drinks and napkins.”
There’s been something plaguing him for weeks now, something he’s grown more and more desperate to do. It’s consumed his every waking moment and he’s embarrassed to admit that it’s even made it into his dreams once or twice during the past month. It had been something he had thought of before but in the past few weeks it’s grown so unavoidable that he wonders how it’s possible that Steve hasn't picked up on it before.
This doesn’t mean Tony has found himself able to lay to rest and not do something, anything, to prepare for what might come. He’s got folders with works half-finished for every one of the people he would consider part of the team now-a-days -and that includes both Thor and Clint and everyone who’s planets away but he knows would come if they ever called them- and he keeps redesigning his own devices and suits. This all on top of the work he keeps doing with Bruce constantly.
Steve nods but he doesn’t tell her that, apart from the glimpses he’s got of them throughout the funeral, he hasn’t seen or talked to any of the other Avengers since the Battle of New York.
Tony intercepts Steve as he is making his way out of the Tower for a training session with some SHIELD recruits. Steve is about to walk out of the doors when Tony suddenly appears in front of him, physically blocking his exit. Steve could pick him up and move him aside but even quickly realizes how over the top and inappropriate that would be so he just stops dead in his tracks and waits for Tony to move or do something.
His voice sounds gravelly as he speaks and he wishes he didn’t need to move to get a glass of cool water.
He walks into the room quickly, FRIDAY opening the sliding door for him without him even having to ask. Steve turns around, closing his book and depositing it on his desk as he turns his chair towards Tony.
Every day for weeks he barely makes it to his bed before falling into the deepest sleep his body can muster. The few times he’s had to stay nights in California or New York City things are more complicated for him. He sleeps fitfully and intermittently, missing his bed, missing his pillows, missing the familiar smells and sounds of his home.
The three pictures look almost identical so he randomly decides on the second one being the best choice to send to his boyfriend, who’s been holed up most of the day in his workshop and who Steve very much wants to see and have dinner with as soon as possible.
Tony is deep in concentration while reading an article from the New York Bulletin from a journalist called Karen Page about the closing of various establishments in the Hell’s Kitchen area when two soft taps are applied to the recovery room’s door.
“I know, baby,” Steve confirms. “But why aren’t you saying anything to anyone? Natasha would drop the plans in a second.”
A lone tear escapes from the corner of her left eye and although she quickly wipes it away with her ring finger Steve catches the short path it walks. Pepper presses her lips together until they turn white and she rests the tips of her fingers on them, like trying to control a sound she doesn't want to escape her mouth. Maybe it’s a sob, Steve thinks as more tears start gathering in her eyes.
If anyone had asked him a couple weeks ago, he would have sworn that there was no such thing. He didn’t wear Steve’s clothes and much less wear them enough for it to be considered an obsession. Now though, he’s been embarrassed to find out he
“You wish, Stark,” she refutes. “I’m just here so you don’t think I bailed on our rematch. It’s not honorable to do that.”
“We need to talk to Steve and Bruce,” Tony establishes. “Who we are now, this team… No more secrets. And no more not working together.”
The silence is still surrounding the team when Steve finally addresses the issue and asks, “What’s going on?”
His legs dangle off the table and with the index finger of his right hand Tony beckons Steve closer.
When they’ve all finished eating Tony notices Steve giving one of FRIDAY’s cameras a very conspicuous look. He’s trying to be subtle and sly about it but when he turns his head to look back at Tony he blushes as he sees Tony with one of his eyebrows raised in enquiry.
But Clint is different. He’s combative, violent even -at times-. He’s snappy with everyone around him, even with Natasha. Maybe even more so with Natasha because of how much trust there is between them. It’s like he’s put on this hard-shell around him, an armor he won’t take off, an armor that is slowly becoming all that he is.
Natasha’s door is still open when they make it to her room but she is nowhere to be found at first glance. Steve looks at Tony, who gestures with his head towards the wooden door. Steve understands and, with a short nod to signify it, knocks rhythmically on the frame of the door.
more accurate question that Steve should have probably asked is, now that they have time, are they willing to use it on each other? Does Tony feel ready to gift Steve a part of his life so they can work on everything they let separate them before?
“Trying to cope by drinking his weight in alcohol? Yeah, I know a thing or two about that,” Tony says.
His toes curl, his back bends and rises from the mattress, his lungs stop working for a few seconds.  He’s falling, falling, falling. Fortunately, Steve is there to catch him.
On the days where his frustration gets him and he feels ready to explode after an entire day of no  fruitful results on his work with Bruce, he searches for Steve. Sometimes they sit in silence and sometimes Tony will talk until his voice goes rough and his mouth feels parched.
The bots really help make things easier between them and Steve gets Tony to tell them the stories of how he built all of them.
“It’s just that those pants look awfully long on you.” She moves her hand to take the waist of them and stretches it before letting it go to snap against Tony’s skin. “And also that shirt,” Tony looks down at his chest and straightens the grey material, confused about Natasha’s comments. “It is a bit too big, don’t you think?”
It all started with that footage with the kids but after that it’s like the dam’s been broken, like they were holding so much in too and now it’s spilling out of them steadily.
“C’mon,” he says as he starts to move towards the bed. He climbs into it, discarding some of the throw pillows and kicking them to the floor. “Get comfortable, Captain.”
But as Tony kisses Steve, just a quick peck on the lips, Steve doesn’t promise him a thing because he can’t bear the thought of Tony not having the birthday he wants and deserves, the birthday that will make him the happiest.
He’s always either been God or Lucifer himself. A savior or a sinner. The solution or the actual problem.
“I’m sorry for crying on you,” Steve clarifies. “And I’m also sorry for falling asleep on you after crying on you.”
“So many times I’ve thought that we could turn this around, that we were meant to,” Steve explains. “I mean, we’re still here, Tony.”
A lot more shocking is how much more involved Clint becomes in Compound activities after Steve’s and Tony’s relationship goes public. He still carries his darkness with him, but the sarcasm he used to be known for has made a return, replacing the haunting silence that he had cocooned himself in.
It took Steve a really long time to come to terms with his new reality and the benefits of it but he’s learnt not to blame himself for it.
Tony’s voice sounds combative and it’s a relief that he doesn’t have to work for it. The anger, the hurt, the disappointment, the sadness…; they’re all there, and Tony wouldn’t be strong enough to call upon them if they weren’t already floating to the surface.
Before she leaves Tony utters out a “Thank you” and although he doesn’t say anything more her small nod lets Tony know she understood the meaning.
There’s something stuck in Steve’s throat, his heart most likely, trying to make its way out of Steve’s body and into Tony’s hand where it knows it belongs.
“I know we’re not doing the gift thing but I just had to,” Steve pronounces. “It’s not much but… I actually hope you don’t mind that I did it.”
This is Tony sexting him. (And yes, once again, some people would be surprised at the things Steve knows because he’s not just their made-up version of Captain America.)
Now, Tony wonders if those are the same type of things Steve has been asking himself during therapy. Or if, perhaps, even in the safest of spaces Steve could have found, he had still been living in that nebulous nothing, in that standstill of a life.
“I was serious,” Natasha says when they’re all positioned. “You didn't need to come here. I’m fine.”
He immediately stops guiding Steve’s hips but he doesn't move his hands from his ass. He starts massaging Steve’s cheeks through his sweatpants and Steve’s cheeks get redder as he bites his lips and half-closes his eyes.
Pepper reaches over and brings her glass of water to her lips. She sips slowly and Steve knows it’s a way to gain a few seconds to compose herself. She places it back on the table and gives him a sad smile.
He’s tired from the aforementioned insomnia, he’s tired from all the fruitless work he has been doing with Bruce, he’s tired because it’s not even 6 in the morning, he’s tired because he can feel Pepper and him pulling apart once again no matter how much they both try to ignore it, he’s tired because although it’s been a month he still feels his body’s resistance after his endeavor in space, he’s tired of not having seen Rhodey in more than a week and he’s especially tired of fighting.
His breathing still has not gone back to normal but maybe it’s not because of the surprise his abrupt awakening caused in him, maybe it’s that breathing through grief is one of the hardest things humans have to learn how to do.
Tony opens his mouth to say something but no sound comes out of his lips, his mouth staying halfway open and his eyes wide from the surprise.
Even though the sun hasn’t even come out yet the air is warm already, characteristic of a New York summer night, but a little colder than it would be in the City, where the buildings and sidewalks and cars and people boil everything over until you feel like the only thing you know is the heat of its streets.
Tony shakes his head a bit and smiles, getting close to Steve again and hating the fact that the soldier is now wearing a t-shirt. Tony always loves the feel of his skin against Steve’s.
Steve turns his body slightly to the left so he’s facing Tony better instead of just laying next to him.
Sliding the notification from the text away from the screen Steve finds himself staring at Tony’s lock-screen.
“Okay, wait,” Tony demands. “I don’t know if it’s me that’s having trouble processing this information or if it’s you doing an awful job at explaining it so, please, please, just… Can you tell me everything?
Looking at Peter’s face Tony realizes he doesn’t even know if Peter liked Christmas. Just one of the millions of things he’d make sure to learn if he ever had the chance again.
Tony’s knees fail him once more and he’s about to hit the floor harshly again when Steve grabs him by the armpits and picks him up, bringing him to his feet. Tony’s back is now to Steve’s chest. Steve’s hands move to Tony’s hips and they help him find his balance.
Steve visibly relaxes and goes back to sitting in his chair. He grabs the spoon Tony was using and places it inside the now empty ice cream container, next to his own.
Pepper’s laugh is nothing more than air leaving through her nostrils and the corners of her lips curling up but it’s the first glimmer of hope Tony has seen in weeks.
Steve has most definitely made his all of these things -the Decimation, the devastation, the losses, the hope, the reversal- and it has crashed and burned around him. But he won’t be able to let it go. It will just become one more layer of who Steve Rogers is and he will carry it forever.
As Tony turns around he sees Natasha through the glass doors wearing her usual all black ensemble. One of her hands is pressed to the glass and the other is ready to knock again on the door, but when she sees Tony looking at her she brings her arm down.
Steve’s eyes keep moving back and forth from the shield to Tony’s face, never holding eye contact for long. It’s a second on the shield and a second on Tony’s eyes, two seconds on the shield and half a second of Tony’s lips.
Steve took another sip of his hot chocolate and enjoyed the rich taste of the drink. The mug was pleasantly warm in his hands, emitting a strong and sweet aroma. Steve drank and drank until the mug was empty. He was making his way to the kitchen to fill his mug again when his apartment door opened and Bucky walked in.
“But what if I have him and then I lose him?” Tony asks, his words coming out a little desperate. “What if maybe having him means not pursuing this at all?”
“I know,” Steve chuckles. “And I think you can tell I’m not okay either. I mean, the dramatic and hysteric laughter might have given it away, maybe.”
Steve has to clear his throat a couple more times until it feels normal again and he can swallow without it feeling scratchy again.
It’s only been for days of them staying in Rome but Steve thinks he could make a life of being here with Tony and although he knows it’s a pipe dream at best he also will miss the indulgence of imagining it be true as they head back to the States.
This morning, the rest of the team are already there and they all offer their greetings when Tony joins them.
Tony finishes eating his cookie and he picks up a second one without hesitation. He concentrates on it for a while, savoring its taste and texture, even going as far as closing his eyes to hone in on his sense of taste. When he has eaten it he wipes his lips with his fingers gently and licks them to clear them of any residual crumbs.
This is not something Steve has always been able to recognize and it is not something he’s always been able to appreciate properly.
They’re both giving each other bunny ears and stupidly that’s the thing that prompts Tony to start crying.
Her face shows an expression Steve has only ever seen her wear around Clint before, one that feels a lot more
“I don’t know,” Steve says. “I’m not sure what it was that I felt back then. I think I did start falling for him when he was gone but it wasn't as real as it is now. I’m gone on him, Pepper.”
There’s been something about their stay here that has made them more sharp, more in sync, more aware of the other. They’ve grown into each other and themselves, flourishing and thriving. It’s like they’re more Steve and Tony here, both separately and together, like Rome was always the place meant to watch them love each other, like for generations each corner and crevice of the city had been waiting for their presence and both the city and them had finally been made whole.
He should have known Tony would be the one person to make the dream come true because of course it’d be Tony.
The video-conference finishes and not much progress has been made, so a date for a second meeting has to be set. Tony’s right leg bounces up and down as possibilities are discussed and finally an agreement is reached. He’s going out of his mind, his heart trying to leave his chest, as if desperate to go in search for Steve.
Her hand finds his again and although they don’t intertwine their fingers they hold on to each other, they hold on to each other tight. Maybe too tight.
One of his hands grips Steve’s shoulder tightly almost to the point where he knows it has to hurt but Steve is still looking intently at him, not moving an inch.
But it’s also heart-wrenching. It’s one of those unexpected reminders of what the Decimation did that hide under beds, in tight corners, behind curtains and in plain sight. They're always there, those reminders, but sometimes they’re easy to miss because they’ve become part of every day life.
Winding up in the twenty-first century allowed him to love Tony and to show him his love and to show the world his love for Tony.
There is no finesse to Steve’s technique, no real rhyme or reason to his actions except that it is obvious that he’s going by the noises he can get out of Tony.
“Will you please just stay there for a while?” Pepper practically begs him, and he’s defenseless to deny her this one thing.
He places a gentle kiss on top of Tony’s head, catching a trace of Tony’s natural scent, his cologne mostly gone after hours of walking around and gentle breezes accompanying them during their explorations.
“Look, it’s my time to apologize, okay?” Tony interrupts him before he can continue speaking. “ I’m sorry about what happened, about the way I reacted. I wish I could say I didn’t want to hurt you or Barnes but it wouldn't be true. At the time I really wanted to hurt you. I wanted you to hurt as much as I was hurting. I’ve never known that kind of rage before. But it wasn’t seeing Barnes, or the Winter Soldier, kill my parents that did it for me and you know it.”
“You know I…,” Steve clears his throat. “I’ve also been thinking lately that I could use some help. I’m pretty sure at this point everyone could use some professional help. Hell, the professionals might need some professional help themselves.”
Carol is back onboard before Nebula is fully out of her seat and between the two of them they pull Tony up and help him stand. He’d feel embarrassed about how much he has to rely on them to take one single step if he still cared about trivial things like pride in his situation.
Steve turns to look at him with his free hand already turning the knob. By the confused frown that has appeared on his face Tony knows he must have felt the way Tony’s hands has started twitching in his. Feeling awkward Tony disentangles his hand from Steve’s although Steve holds on to it a few seconds too long after Tony starts trying to pull away.
There’s still a part of him that resents Steve for the way he handled things and the choices he made but that part is irrevocably entangled with the part of him that resents his own choices and decisions.
“I was also not in a good emotional state,” Tony confesses. “And part of it had to do with the Accords, with why I thought we needed them. That’s why things got ugly in the end, I think, because it became personal.”
Tony knows it’s no one’s fault, really. They’ve both been so busy and in need of putting their attention on other issues that they haven’t been working as hard on reestablishing themselves, on remodeling their relationship after trying so hard and so long to fit in all the wrong ways.
Steve’s second question snaps Bruce out of it and he clears his throat, taking the lead of the situation. For a moment, Tony is glad that it’ll be Bruce talking, him being the most sensitive of all of them, but that moment comes and goes as soon as he is reminded of how his team is composed basically of assholes, even sneaky, intelligent, yoga-loving ones.
It’s like the exhaustion is exposing all of Steve’s weakest points to the world and Tony is growing compelled to act as a buffer between him and the rest of the world so no one can take advantage of him in this situation. He’s had this kind of thoughts before, thoughts of not wanting Steve hurt or wanting to protect him but there is a depth to them in this moment that is a little unfamiliar to Tony.
Tony surged forward with almost inhuman strength as he desperately tried in vain to break free of is restraints and reach the now forward slumping man in front of him. He twisted and yanked with everything he had left- screaming as he failed to pull himself free.
Tony look at me,- come on Tony open you eyes!” Steve’s blood ran cold the second he saw Iron Man hit the pavement below, he knew the suit kept him well protected, but that was one hell of a nasty hit he took.
this to all be real. And that's when Tony suddenly broke down, he crumpled forward in a fit of wracking cries but Steve was right up by his side before he could fall, he took Tony into his arms and the inventor grasped back, holding on as if for dear life.
Completely sated and physically worn out, Steve collapsed backwards into the sofa gently pulling Tony with him into a loose and sprawling hug.
“No time Cap, this thing appears to be on course towards a section of the city which hasn’t been evacuated yet, Jarvis- find me a weak spot and we'll blow it to Kingdom come”.
Tony was struggling anew against his restraints, clearly hurting himself in an attempt to get to the fake Steve who was now bleeding out rapidly.
“Oh, are you thirsty? It is rather warm in here, there let me take this out of your mouth,” the man said whilst removing the rag from between Tony's abused lips. He then stepped back from Tony and  proceeded to open the bottle of water bringing it up to his own lips drinking long and deep. Steve could see Tony tremble as his eyes tracked the bottle of water closely, surely they couldn't have deprived Tony of water for this long, he knew that humans could cope without food for a long time, but
“Well I’ll be damned, that’s one huge ass bug, relative of yours Nat?”, Clint deadpanned through the comm and unsurprisingly received nothing but a short growl in reply.
“They won't give it to you, what ever it is you want- you won’t get it,” Tony started with confidence still unwilling to show any weakness.
“My dear Captain America, risen from the dead?! You are truly a man of many skills,” and Christ Steve would now recognise that voice anywhere, the man who took his Tony, who tortured and abused him and
Steve hadn't left Tony's side for more than a few mere minutes since he’d first sat vigil by his side in the recovery room. He'd only left to hurriedly tend to washing and changing out of his suit into a clean set of clothes, he'd barely eaten since he didn't think his stomach would hold it down, but Bruce had forced him to at least drink some water.
this has to be it... “Guys I think I've found his location, head to the lowest level, things may get a little noisy down here so I may need some backup in keeping any other attackers at bay whilst I grab Tony,” Steve commed to his team. Just as he was lifting his hands to the locks he was struck round the back of the head with something blunt and rather heavy.
Tony made to bring his fingers to his temples to massage away some of the tension caused by his splitting headache when dread suddenly flooded his system, he found that he was unable to move his arms even an inch from where they were seemingly secured by his sides to the surface he was laying on.
“We need to bring it down fast, Stark could you try knocking it off balance with a blast to its legs and we’ll look for a weak spot once it’s down?” Steve called whilst dodging the rather sharp looking pincers of an attacking ant.
Tony had fallen for him hard, and in his drunken state his confidence had been above where it should have been.
I think I always have and I'm so sorry it took me so long to realise, I was so blind and stupid to not see it, I'm just so sorry.......” Steve panted for breath at his confession and desperately searched deep in to Tony's eyes for understanding, for having at least
‘ “Speak to him Tony, and be quick about it, that wound will bleed out soon enough...” ' the captor spoke on the screen before walking out of view leaving Tony and fake Steve alone.
Thankfully, Tony had caused no more damage other than to rip the IV from his arm which had now been easily reattached. Bruce and Clint had returned to the room at the sound of the commotion, and one the medical staff were happy with Tony's status, they left the room leaving the four remaining Avengers to keep watch over Tony again.
Now being upright, Tony could make out that the room he was in was not particularly large, it was stone walled, no windows, one door and a grated vent just to the left of it up around 7 feet high. His arms were lifted above his head and stretched uncomfortably high where they were cuffed to a rope extending down from the ceiling. The sudden transfer of position in addition to the new dose of drugs had Tony reeling to hold back the wave of nausea that hit him. He wobbled on unsteady legs, torso stretched harshly to accommodate his restarted wrists and miserably his arms had already started to tingle and lose feeling from above his head.
