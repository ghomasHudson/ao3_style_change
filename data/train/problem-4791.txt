Reid froze. So the older Winchester believed he was under a truth spell. Interesting. Reid wondered why Dean’s delusions chose that particular spell and not another. If Dean believed he was under a truth spell, he would only tell the truth. Maybe Reid could use this to his advantage.
“Well I was handcuffed to a bed at one point. And his brother, Dean, did hit me and dislocate my wrist. But I’m fine,” Reid said before smiling. “Other than that, I spent most of my time locked in a room. But Sam did give me a few books so that was nice. The encyclopedia on the Loch Ness monster was interesting.”
“Right,” Sam said awkwardly. “I’m gonna go now.”
Sam grabbed his phone and called Rowena. He listened to the ringing before hearing an answer.
“The tattoo artist is coming by later, so eat and drink water,” Sam said before he left the room.
Everyone froze. They gave each other looks, all of them worried. Reid had just said he didn’t care that Sam Winchester was a serial killer.
Dean stepped back before Sam came into the room with Rowena. He watched as they started pouring in ingredients. Dean glanced at Cas walking into the room and smiled.
“Let’s go,” Dean said as he dragged Reid down the hallway.
“Do you know any self defense?” Dean asked.
“Yeah, yeah. We’re just…shared hallucinations from school food, that’s it,” Dean said before they heard a car pull into the driveway. “Shit. That’s him.”
“They’re not coming off,” Peter said as his breathing started to turn into hyperventilating.
“No,” Reid said. “No. I’m okay.”
Peter smiled and ran into the other room. Dean glanced at the doorway and sighed.
Everyone jolted up and turned to look at Reid. Derek immediately hugged him while Garcia stumbled over.
“This is your room now,” Sam said with a smile.
“Look, I’m okay. The witch’s curse messed with me but I’m good now,” Dean said. “It’s fine. I’ll tell a lie. Um…I hate cheeseburgers. See? I can lie. I’m all good.”
“Is Reid alive?” Hotch asked.
“Sleep. I need sleep. God, I need sleep,” Sam mumbled to himself as he walked into the house.
“What?” Sam asked as his eyes widened. “No. No. He’s not…”
“Hi,” Reid said awkwardly.
“Hey, I got a question. Do you still have that position available?” Sam asked into the phone. “Is or something easy, like you can’t screw it up no matter how hard you try?”
“Dean wasn’t answering his phone,” Castiel said as he walked inside. “So I was worried.”
Sam glared at Dean. Of course he locked their now hostage in the dungeon. Why didn’t Dean put him anywhere nicer? The dungeon is freezing. Sam definitely planned on moving him out of there, if not for their hostages benefit, then for Sam’s. If Sam would have to keep going in there, and he probably would, Sam would be dreading getting a PTSD flashback to the cage because of the cold. Sam twitched at the thought.
“Jimmy is gone now. Now it’s just us,” CAS said.
Bobby put his phone in his pocket after seeing the text went through.
“Sam, it’s the witch’s curse. It’s making Dean angry too,” Castiel said.
“Alright, brother, let’s get you in the chair,” Benny said to Reid.
“What?” Reid asked quietly.
Reid didn’t know whether to be honest or not. He decided to lie. Reid nodded to tell he was fine. His mind was still working up the courage to talk again.
“A bot. A robot,” Sam explained.
Dean had locked him in the trunk when he kidnapped him. When Reid had woken up, Reid was locked in there for at least a few hours. So he was starving and he needed water. So he took his chances with the food.
Reid’s anxiety was absolutely screaming. He had just been walking home when he saw the Winchesters impala. He looked at it and saw the nice condition of the car. You don’t get to see cars in good conditions, and Reid’s mind wondered what the owner did to keep it in such good condition, especially in a city.
“Out of all of your stupid ideas, this one is in the top five,” Castiel said.
“I’ll need another plate,” Dean said to Rowena. “It’ll be for our…guest.”
“Is Bobby a serial killer?” Dean asked Sam.
“Call Rowena,” Dean said. “Because you’re never this tired, ever.”
“Sammy. Sam went upstairs for a paper clip last night and never came back,” Dean said as Cas and Crowley helped him off the floor.
Sam immediately tried to curl into a ball as best he could with being restrained to the chair.
“I needed to do a spell today. I needed to knock someone out with a hex bag,” Sam said.
Dean froze when he saw Jack and Peter handcuffed together. He tried to hide his smirk as he put the boxes of pizza on the table.
“Aw, you think we wanted to kill you? No. We want Bobby. See, Bobby killed a friend of mine years back. And now that he has you and your brother and actually cares about you two, what better bait?”
“Yeah,” Dean said before noticing Sam smiling as he played with the fidget spinner. “Anytime.”
“Why are we even doing this?” Roy asked.
“I’m Walt. He’s Roy,” he said before Sam got dragged into the abandoned house.
“He…He raped me, Jack, repeatedly,” Peter said, his eyes watering.
“I’m fine,” Sam said quietly. “I’m just glad to be home.”
“I don’t know,” Reid said.
“I swear if you’re making this up just so I text him,” Dean threatened.
“What’s the name?” Crowley asked, his smirk now gone and replaced with seriousness.
Cas called Dean again before Dean answered.
“Well then I need to make them more than all the time,” Dean said.
“I can explain,” Dean said awkwardly.
“Onto what? A chainsaw?” Castiel asked with a glare. “You’re covered in blood, Dean.”
“Dean will be fine once the curse is gone,” Castiel said.
“Hello, Dean, it’s me, the bees,” Jimmy said.
“Kid, alright, what’s going on with you?” Bobby asked.
Dean struggled to open the door but found it locked. He froze.
What Reid didn’t expect though was Sam to start unlocking the restraints around his wrists. He froze as Sam undid the ankle restraints.
“Yeah, I got the files in my office,” Bobby said before he left the room.
“I don’t know,” Hotch said quietly. “I just don’t know.”
“I’m never walking home alone again,” Reid said, Derek snickering.
“His name is…CAS-TL. What the f…” Dean said to himself before he rubbed his eyes. “Whatever. Money is money.”
“I swear to god if you two woke me up because of some dumbass argument, I’m gonna shoot you both,” Sam said with a death glare.
“Sp…Spencer…Reid. Spencer Reid,” Reid said anxiously.
“Oh my god, I’ve been texting bees for a day,” Dean said before he ran his hand through his hair. “I gotta sit down.”
“You sure about this?” Dean asked Sam. “We can just wait. You’re exhausted.”
Sam knew Reid was lying. Who would be fine after being kidnapped? No one. Sam got up from the chair he sat down in and walked over to the table.
“It’s so…normal,” Dean said awkwardly. “Man, this is such a let down.”
“Oh my god. This is bad. I’ve never slept that long, ever,” Sam said.
“At least Bobby’s not a serial killer,” Sam said quietly.
“Keep your pet fed in there, Sam. He’s not leaving that room,” Dean said as he walked away.
Sam awkwardly grabbed the blade from Cas’ hand.
“I brought you breakfast,” Sam said before he ushered to the table by the door.
Peter sniffled.
“Yeah, I don’t wanna get kicked,” Dean said.
Castiel rolled his eyes before hearing a sound from the other room. He gave Dean a confused look before they followed the noise to the library.
“Hey,” Sam said calmly, pulling Reid back into the room he was in.
“N-No,” Reid stuttered.
“How was the store?” Sam asked awkwardly.
Dean nodded as he closed the basement door.
“But the fact that there’s a chair bolted into the floor with a weird ass pentagram shape on the floor too,” Dean said. “This is so weird.”
“I’ll tell you later,” Dean said to Cas after glancing at Peter again.
“Fine. You have until tomorrow,” Dean said before hanging up.
“You sure you wanna do this?” Sam asked.
“I bet,” Dean said. “Waffles?”
“Is everything alright?” Castiel asked.
Dean closed the door and walked away. Reid slowly walked towards the plate and grabbed the waffles.
“I’m having a problem with a guy,” Dean blurted out.
“Come on,” Dean said as he unlocked the restraints.
Sam nodded. They both walked out of the room and closed the door.
“Stay quiet, okay?” Dean said.
“It’s Derek Morgan, basically your older brother,” Derek said. “Just take a breath.”
“I can stay the night if you’d like,” Castiel said. “Dean and I are about the same size, body type wise. So I can just borrow some of his clothes for the night or stay in my own.”
“I need proof that Reid is alive and unharmed,” Hotch said hesitantly.
Cas held his hand over Dean’s shirt, causing the blood to vanish. He smiled before he kissed Cas again.
“Stay safe, pretty boy, and remember to not stay up all night working this case,” Derek said.
“Hey,” Sam said calmly as he grabbed Reid’s hand.
Reid felt his stomach turn as he thought of the fact that he was now one of their victims. He tried to take a deep breath to calm down but struggled because of the gag. Nothing dangerous or life threatening, but between the gag and the air quality in the room he was trapped in, along with the anxiety that he was dealing with, he was gonna have a difficult time breathing. And he was gonna have a difficult time calming down.
Sam squirmed against the guy’s grip and tried to yell but only muffled noises came out.
“Okay,” Derek said slowly with an anxious tone.
“Night, Dean,” Sam mumbled as he fell asleep.
“I…” Dean said before hearing the fire alarm go off. “What the hell?”
“No you don’t. I remember you saying how rooming with Adam and his two roommates was hell so be glad you’re stuck with me,” Dean said.
“Is this exhaustion?” Dean asked with a concerned tone.
“The feds said you died,” Dean said as his eyes watered.
“Okay, bot. I’m ready to talk to you,” Dean said to himself as he looked at the laptop screen.
“Let who go?” Hotch asked.
Castiel rolled his eyes and walked away. Dean snickered as he finished drying his hands.
“So?” Reid asked.
Reid went to say something but decided not to risk it. He didn’t want to piss Dean off, or risk getting locked in that room again. He hated that room.
“So bring up Dean Winchester and see how he reacts. Rossi, go with JJ,” Hotch said. “The rest of us will work on studying the Winchesters’ profile. Garcia, get me footage and find out when and where Dean got Reid.”
Dean watched as Sam and Rowena left the library, along with Cas also leaving. Dean stared at the bowl awkwardly.
“You doing okay?” Dean asked with a concerned tone.
Sam often dealt with people, victims, freezing up. Their bodies would freeze and that wasn’t their fault. Sam sighed. This was going to take a little while.
“Your choice. Chair or chains on the wall?” Dean asked nonchalantly.
“Hey, we’re back,” Dean called out as he walked into the kitchen. “Sam ditched me for the library so he’s not eating dinner. I’ll bring him food later since he tends to forget to eat food when he goes all nerd.”
“I had a feeling someone would kill him when they found out,” Peter said quietly.
“He’s your son?” Hotch asked as he tried to stall.
“I’m bisexual,” Sam blurted out.
“When I was…when I was a kid…I had this babysitter. And he…he made me do…things,” Peter said quietly.
“Nope,” Bobby said. “You two done questioning me?”
“Yeah,” Jimmy said.
“What happened?” Dean asked.
“I don’t know,” Jack said with a weird tone.
Then they ended up finding him pretty quickly, and made his death extremely painful and extremely slow. The Winchesters had been gone all night and had just returned to the bunker that morning right before everyone woke up. They buried the body, but that only took like half an hour at most. They spent the entire night with Skip. Dean, and of course Sam, had a policy. You don’t hurt kids. Ever. Skip had broken that rule.
“That’s it. Call him and invite him over for dinner,” Bobby said.
“Last night, you passed out. You hit the floor,” Sam said awkwardly. “You can probably blame stress and low blood sugar for that.”
“The feds wouldn’t say that unless it was true!” Dean yelled before punching the wall.
“Of course,” Castiel said as he rolled his eyes. “How’s Sam doing? It’s been a few days since…since the kidnapping.”
“Who?” Dean asked.
“It’s cute, you know, you two having matching tattoos,” Dean joked.
Reid jumped when the gunshot went off. He looked at the bullet hole in the wall next to him before he turned back to Dean. Reid decided to stay quiet as to not risk pissing Dean off.
“Nothing, just…living with Adam was fine. It’s one of his roommates that caused problems, in more ways than one,” Sam mumbled. “I don’t wanna talk about it. Please don’t make me.”
“Kid, talk,” Walt said as he ripped the piece of tape off.
“A what?” Dean asked.
“No,” Peter said quietly as he stared at the floor.
Reid felt his body go numb as the feeling in his limbs still didn’t come back. He noticed the symbols on each of the doors.
“Why do you have handcuffs?” Peter asked awkwardly as he stopped looking through random drawers in Jack’s house.
Jack’s voice brought Peter out of the flashback, making him twitch.
“Um…” Hotch said. “Jack…he’s a friend of yours.”
“True,” Dean said as he walked into his room. “Crap, now I gotta text Cas. I don’t wanna. You text him.”
Sam didn’t seem upset or angry or pissed off. He seemed like he cared about Reid. And the part of Reid’s brain that did care for Sam hated this. If Sam didn’t like Reid, maybe Reid’s brain wouldn’t be like this. Maybe he wouldn’t be in love with-
“What is it?” Rossi asked.
“Fine,” Dean said. “But we obviously can’t break into the basement now with Bobby in the kitchen. We’ll do it after dinner.”
“I wanna go back down there,” Sam said.
“Good choose,” Dean said with a smile before losing it. “You’ll be okay, kid.”
“I need a drink,” Dean said.
“Jerk,” Sam said.
Reid often studied cases when he couldn’t sleep. He found his mind going back to the Winchesters quite a few times. He found their story interesting to say the least. The best story he could come up with was that after their mother died, their father snapped, probably aided by PTSD from being a marine. And he raised Sam and Dean into killing. Or maybe he abused them and then they both snapped and killed him. Reid often got a headache from reading their case file.
Hotch listened to the silence on the other end of the line.
“CAS-TL. He’s the bot I’ve been talking to since you left for work yesterday,” Dean said.
Dean looked over at Sam, who was staring at the ceiling with a pair of tired eyes.
Sam quickly went down the hallway and ended up in the library, where he saw Dean and Cas arguing. He groaned in annoyance, which prompted Dean to turn around.
“Rowena? Hey,” Sam said before he glanced over at Cas.
Reid frantically looked around the room he was in as he struggled against the restraints. He quickly gave up as he realized he was chained up and not tied with rope or tape, which he probably could have managed to get out of.
“Okay. At least they’re not starving me…yet,” Reid said to himself quietly.
“This has to be the witch’s curse messing with his head. Even my brother wouldn’t have this bad of an idea,” Sam said to himself.
“What is it?” Sam asked as he looked up from his computer with a glare. “I’m busy.”
“Sweetie, get some sleep. You need it,” Rowena said. “I’ll keep an eye on Samuel.”
“Oh, what kind?” Dean asked.
“Oh. That’s not very nice,” Jack said.
“Did that give you closure?” Peter asked.
“What?” Reid asked as he looked around the room.
“Fine with me,” Dean said before he took a sip of his beer.
Dean dragged Reid down the hallway and into one of the many rooms. Reid had noticed that all of the doors he’s seen have had a unicursal hexagram on them. Maybe he’s in a bunker or warehouse or something. He wondered what the symbol meant to the Winchesters.
“But breakfast,” Jack said with a sad expression.
“Yes actually,” Sam sassed.
“Interesting,” Crowley said awkwardly before he stopped outside Dean’s house. “Here you go; Flannel Central.”
“I know,” Sam said quietly.
“My back,” Castiel said. “It’s a pair of angel wings.”
“The second thing,” Dean said quietly as he focused on washing the blood off of his hands.
“So where is he?!” Dean yelled before getting dizzy. “Woah, woah. Dizzy.”
Reid forced himself to take a breath to try to calm down, but nothing worked. His anxiety about the Winchesters was overriding any sense of calm he had left.
“Look, I panicked,” Dean said. “And now we’re training him to be a hunter. Can you help with the tattoo or not? It’s not exactly like we can take him to a real tattoo place.”
“How much witchcraft have you been doing lately?” Rowena asked. “Has it been a lot?”
“Teaching him how to use his powers,” Sam said with a smile before he chugged his drink.
“Of course. Is there any reason why we have to distract him?” Castiel asked.
“The Winchesters killed Reid, you know that,” Derek said as his eyes watered. “Reid’s dead. I wish I never hung up the phone.”
“Well if you ever want to skip school, you have my number,” Crowley said. “If you’re not skipping, why are you seeing Dean?”
“Sammy, can you go get the kid please?” Dean asked.
“Alright. Relax. I got a key,” Dean said as he went into the drawer next to the one Jack and Peter had dug through.
“And he did,” Rowena said before she looked at Cas. “But sweetie, I could have gotten here quickly.”
“I really wished I slept through this entire car ride,” Sam said to himself.
“Kid? What are you doing here?” Bobby asked.
“Ah, Squirrel, what can I help you with?” Crowley asked.
“I’m good. I’m good,” Sam said awkwardly.
“The bot?” Sam asked.
As Reid’s mind filled with questions for their mystery John Doe, he didn’t hear the footsteps behind him. He got startled when he got locked in a chokehold from behind, a hand covering his mouth too.
“I know,” Derek mumbled.
“Dean got extremely super protective of him after you died,” Sam said.
“I’m still in my scrubs,” Sam said.
“What do you want with me?” Reid asked anxiously as his breathing got heavier.
“Can we get rid of our hostage now that Jack is back?” Sam asked Dean.
“Why?” Reid asked.
“No, don’t-” Sam said before getting cut off by Reid jolting awake. “That’s what’ll happen if you burn it.”
“Kid, what the hell?” Bobby asked as he ran over to Dean and started unlocking the handcuffs.
“Hotch, we have no leverage now. What do we do?” Derek asked.
“Agent Rossi. It’s Dr. Smith, the coroner. You said to call if any more information came up on Jack’s body,” he said.
“If you two wanted beer, you could have gotten some. Stop taking mine,” Bobby said.
Sam groaned again when he heard yelling. And then something being thrown. Sam fully woke up and grabbed his gun from underneath the pillow. He quickly slipped on his shoes and headed out of the room.
“Skip Westcott,” Dean said.
“Reid it is. Okay. I’m Sam,” Sam said calmly with a smile.
Sam liked people for who they were. He had experimented in college, but nothing too major. A hookup here and there, way before he dated Jessica. And that’s when he figured out he liked people for who they were inside. He never told anyone that. Ever.
Reid tensed up. That meant Sam had looked into him. Reid wondered how much Sam knew. The self conscious part of his brain felt slightly violated. The profiler part of his brain felt worried that if Sam knew information on him, he could use it against him. And the part of Reid’s brain that had feelings for Sam…that part he didn’t know how it felt.
“Yes,” Reid said. “Why is everyone acting so weird?”
“Obviously, Dean. I’ve been telling you that for two years,” Sam said sarcastically. “You can’t hustle pool forever.”
“I’m gonna…I’m gonna go,” Sam said awkwardly before slowly leaving the room. “I’m sorry.”
But he couldn’t think about that right now. He needed to answer Sam’s question. Was he okay? Reid didn’t even know how to answer that if he was being honest with himself. He was kidnapped, but…Sam was…
“A robot? What the fuck, Sam?” Dean asked, his eyes widened.
Reid nearly jumped out of his skin when Dean had walked in. He was already on edge and Dean bursting into the room like he just did didn’t help at all.
Dean left the room and made his way down the hallway. He stopped outside the door before opening it. Dean took a breath before he moved the shelf, Reid now trying to turn around to look at him.
“Reid,” Sam said calmly.
“Come on,” Dean said.
Peter rubbed his eyes and sniffled again. He closed his eyes as the memories of Skip flooded back to him.
“His car isn’t here,” Castiel said.
Reid nodded as he tried to not make Dean anymore upset than he already was.
“Come on, Sammy, what the hell?” Dean asked as he glared at the handcuffs around his wrists. “What’s taking you so long? It’s just a paper clip.”
“I can show you right now if you’d like,” Castiel said awkwardly.
The dungeon was freezing. It was incredibly freezing. This room though, it was warm. There was a bed with thick blankets on it. And there was another door in the room.
Almost like a switch, Reid started freaking out. The hex bag Sam had been using worked, quite incredibly. The second Reid let go of his hand, it caused him to freak out. Dean pushed Reid into the chair.
Dean gained a confused look as he stared at the screen. He did a double taking thinking he read that wrong.
“I’m good. I’m good,” Dean said as he rubbed his eyes. “I’m good. It’s just bees. I’m taking to bees. I’m having an actual fucking conversation with a hive of bees. What the hell has my life come to now? God, I wanna go back to hustling pool.”
“No, I’m okay,” Reid said as he walked down the empty street. “I’m enjoying the walk. Plus there’s street lights so I’m okay because it’s not completely dark.”
“Where?” Dean asked, Sam hiding his smile.
“Thanks,” Sam said quietly.
“The bees talk to the computer and the computer tells me what they’re saying. So now I’m talking to you,” Jimmy said. “Hello, Dean. It’s nice to meet you. I have quite enjoyed our talks. Thank you for letting me talk about honey. No one seems to care.”
“De…” a voice called out as someone ran over to him.
“For a tattoo,” Sam said quietly.
“Right now, we need to worry about fixing Reid,” Hotch said.
“Dead,” Dean said. “When I got older and was on my own, I tracked him down again.”
Reid noticed Sam often asked if he was okay. He wondered why that was. What Reid would probably never figure out is that the reason why Sam was doing that is because Sam knows how bad anxiety is. And he doesn’t want Reid dealing with that too. Sam has been through enough mental health issues in his life. No one deserves that. So he was checking in with Reid to make sure he was okay.
“The Winchesters are a piece of work,” Derek said.
“I get that. But he’s a kid,” Roy said.
Sam pulled Reid into a room. Reid’s eyes adjusted to the light. The hallway lights were bright but this light was…nicer for a lack of words. It wasn’t as harsh.
“Let’s train him to be a hunter,” Dean said.
Peter snickered.
“Flowers and honey?” Dean asked with a confused expression. “What the fuck did I get myself into?”
“Damnit, Dean,” Castiel said with a glare.
Rowena froze and stared at Sam. Sam nodded slowly before he sat down.
“Yes, I’m aware of that since Dean just said that, but…you consider Jack your son?” Castiel asked Dean.
“What the hell?” Sam whispered.
“Yeah, Dean, a robot,” Sam said as he glared at his brother.
Sam closed the door as Reid broke down in tears. Reid wanted to leave so badly. He hated being here. He hated being anywhere near the Winchesters. The pain from the tattoo was so much. Reid’s pain tolerance was so low, despite being bullied his entire life.
“Wait, what about…what about CAS?” Dean asked as he sat up in the hospital bed.
Reid blinked. He often got wrapped up in his own head and had to be brought out of it. Morgan often flicked him in the forehead. Hotch had to hit Reid on the back of the head once. That hurt. Garcia even flung a rubber band at him and hit him in the lip by accident. He was bleeding and Garcia kept apologizing.
Dean knew this reaction. It was anxiety. Dean had seen how bad Sam’s anxiety was in the past so he knew anxiety when he saw it.
“Baby girl, don’t doubt yourself, you got this,” Derek said as he tried to reassure both himself and Garcia. “We’ll find him.”
Sam blinked his eyes before he rubbed them. He looked around and realized the impala was parked in the garage.
“The guy in the trench coat,” Sam said.
“Being kidnapped by the Winchesters, I remember their files. It was bad. His brain could have snapped because of all of that. I wouldn’t put it past Reid to have investigated their cases. All of that information in his brain, he could have snapped. They could have brainwashed him too,” JJ suggested.
“Sammy, we got a problem,” Dean said.
Sam and Dean made their way to the basement door and opened it. They slowly walked down the stairs and went towards the wall. Sam pulled the coat hook and watched the wall click open.
Sam blocked the door to the basement as Bobby grabbed the trash bag.
“Cas?” Dean asked as he got up from the chair and stumbled onto the floor.
“If you need anything, let me know,” Sam said sincerely.
“It’s fine, Dean,” Sam said as he got up from the chair and left the room with his brother.
“Thank you,” Rowena said with a smile.
“Is everything okay?” Sam asked as he ran over to Dean in the hallway. “I heard a gunshot.”
“Have at it. I’m white but I’m not that white. I’m not trying to get killed by a serial killer,” Sam said as he got off the floor.
“Alright,” Dean said as he pulled out his phone. “Stay quiet unless I tell you to speak. I’ll let you listen but you’re gonna keep quiet, or I’ll make you keep quiet. Okay?”
“How did you get his blood?” Sam asked as Cas handed him his angel blade with blood on it. “Oh. That’s how.”
“Huh?” Dean asked, his eyes widened.
“Can you explain now?” Castiel asked.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said tiredly. “Just tell me where Sam is. Please.”
“Same here,” Rowena said.
Reid noticed Dean’s reaction. Dean was getting pissed off. Reid dreaded annoying the Winchester but he needed information, so he had to keep pushing.
“I slept. It felt so nice,” Sam said tiredly with a smile.
“The same Dean Winchester who’s legally dead?” Hotch asked as he tried to stall for time.
Dean caught Sam, who’s face was extremely pale now.
Sam and Dean froze.
“I’m calling him,” Castiel said as he pulled out his phone.
Peter had walked in on one too many weird conversations with the Winchesters. He talked to Ned about it, and Ned suggested they were in the mafia. Peter thought that was absolutely stupid, but Ned wasn’t standing in the same room where Dean was just casually washing blood off of him. Now Peter was starting to agree with Ned’s crazy theory.
Reid nodded slightly as he stared at the wall. He felt the rag around his mouth get untied and taken off.
Reid twitched when he heard the door clatter behind him. He watched as the silhouette of one of the Winchesters appeared on the wall because of the light from the hallway. His breathing started getting erratic as he listened to the footsteps get closer.
“I think so,” Sam said before he yawned.
“Jack’s dead,” Dean said quietly as he walked past Sam.
“Dean’s resting. The potion does take quite a lot out of you so he’ll be tired for a few days,” Rowena said.
“Oh, okay,” Sam said awkwardly, his face getting slightly flustered.
Reid nodded. He didn’t want to pry any more. He learned that lesson when he ended up pissing off Dean.
“This one is like an encyclopedia on the Loch Ness monster. It’s really interesting actually. This one is about demonic possession. And this one is about zombies,” Sam said before handing the books to Reid.
“Jumpy much. Jeez,” Dean said before putting the plate and bottle on the table by the door.
“Oh. Yeah. These. Don’t touch these. They have magic in them. They do that. Trust me when I tell you Cas and I learned that the hard way,” Dean said awkwardly. “That was a long six hours.”
“We’re friends of Bobby’s,” one of them said.
made me bring him all around the world on a month long vacation,” Castiel said as he glared at Dean.
Dean made his way down the hallway. He opened the door and saw Reid scrambling away from him and bumping into the wall.
“I…he was arrested for decapitating six people,” Reid managed to say.
“Are you sure?” Castiel asked with a concerned tone.
“Can I sleep? I just got off of a 28 hour shift and I didn’t even get a break,” Sam said tiredly.
“Hey, relax,” Sam said calmly. “Are you okay?”
Dean turned on the radio and let the sound of classic rock fill the quiet car ride. He sighed and looked out the window.
“That’s it. I’m going into the bathroom in my room,” Sam said as he walked out of the kitchen.
“I’m calling him,” Bobby said as he pulled out his phone.
Everyone looked at Reid, who was playing with a fidget toy and smiling. The same fidget toy Sam had given him earlier that day.
“You can sleep in the car. Come on,” Dean said as he dragged his brother off the couch.
“Thanks,” Reid mumbled.
“Jimmy has been working on a way to upload our consciousness into his own,” CAS explained.
Derek wanted to know who Sam was. At least if they knew who this Sam girl was, then she could maybe answer the questions. Why did Reid leave and not respond to texts or calls? What was going on?
“No. No. No. No,” Sam said anxiously as he struggled against the ropes.
“Yeah, you are,” Morgan reassured. “Listen…you’re dehydrated a little bit and there’s bruises on your wrists and ankles.”
“I’m fine,” Sam mumbled as he walked into the house.
“Can we talk?” Dean asked hesitantly.
“How are you…” Sam asked.
“Where is he now?” Jack asked.
“Where are we?” Reid asked hesitantly.
Dean sat next to Sam on the couch. Cas sat next to Dean and grabbed his hand.
“I am utterly indifferent to sexual orientation,” CAS said.
“Well you kinda need to know self defense,” Dean said.
“I’ll be waiting for her,” Castiel said before he left the room.
“Sweetie, you look awful,” Rowena said.
“You vanished and we couldn’t track your phone or anything,” Derek said.
“I kidnapped someone,” Dean said quietly.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said as he walked into the room.
“Man, I hate having conversations with you when you’re sleep deprived. You don’t remember a thing,” Dean said to himself before rubbing his eyes. “Look. The bot is alive or something, so we’re going to check it out. I already talked to Jimmy about it and he’s fine with us stopping by.”
“Okay. We’ll just…we’ll get it back,” Sam said.
“You should rest, sweetie pie. Teleporting and using your powers like this is exhausting,” Rowena said after noticing Cas getting up from the table.
“Great. Yeah. My brother needs a job,” Sam said. “Yeah that brother. No, not the one who lives down south with his two roommates, but the one who…yeah that one. I’ll give you his contact information. Thanks.”
Sam escorted Reid out of the room, mostly by pulling his arm. Sam could feel how numb Reid’s arm was. Restraints did that. He pulled Reid out of the dungeon and into the storage room.
“Alright, come on,” Dean said as he dragged Reid over to the chair.
Reid hated doing this. He knew something was gonna happen by him asking questions but he needed answers.
“Don’t do what?” Dean asked as he picked the lock on the door to the basement.
Reid rubbed his eyes and sat up on the bed. He was covered in blankets, which honestly felt nice compared to the chilly bunker. Or maybe it was the compression of the blankets that made him feel safe. Either way, he stopped shaking, even with Sam in the room. Not shaking constantly from fear and cold temperatures felt nice.
“I will drag you by your ankles if I have to,” Dean said to Sam with a glare.
“I hope the kids okay,” Dean said to himself.
“Bobby’s gonna be pissed,” Sam said.
Dean nodded. He dragged Reid over to the chair and put him in it. Sam and Dean started to restrain his limbs.
“I’m sorry,” Jack said.
“I’m good, Rowena. How are you?” Sam asked tiredly.
Reid just looked at the sandwich in his hand and took a bite. Just focus on eating the sandwich and forget about your problems.
The hostage nodded. Sam slowly untied the rag around his mouth, the person now coughing slightly, probably from being able to fully breathe now.
Jack nodded and left the kitchen. He headed upstairs to his room and walked inside. Peter was on the bed and wiping away his tears.
“What? I’m not an idiot, Dean. I saw the way you looked at some guys in high school. It was the same way you looked at girls,” Sam said.
“Tell me everything, Samuel, about this love,” Rowena said with a smile. “Who are they?”
Dean felt a blast and fell on the ground. The sound of ringing echoed through his ears as his vision became extremely blurry.
“I’m not playing around,” Sam said anxiously. “My phone’s in the basement.”
“What?!” Sam yelled.
“Or what?” Sam asked.
“I love you too, despite you being a stupid idiot sometimes,” Castiel said.
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked.
Dean immediately left the room and slammed the door behind him, Reid flinching when the loud sound of the door echoed through the quiet room.
“That part I’m confused on as well,” Castiel said.
“Gotta love that serial killer protective instincts I guess,” Dean said to himself.
“Anyway,” Dean said awkwardly in a panicked voice. “Sam, a word.”
Dean dragged Sam into the other room.
Reid nodded.
Sam froze. Dean noticed Sam’s body language change from joking around to full on alert.
“Um…I don’t know,” Castiel said awkwardly. “Sam, I know we’re best friends but that’s a weird question, even for you.”
“Sam has been known to show more sympathy than you, Dean, so I think Sam should go talk to him,” Castiel said.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asked as Dean blinked his eyes.
“I tripped,” Dean said awkwardly after glancing over at Peter.
“Why don’t you sit down?” JJ said as she ushered for Reid to sit.
“You are?” Reid asked as his mind tried to process that.
“I was a teenager. My dad wasn’t the best guy, like ever. He’d leave us with barely any money. When that got low, I’d have to come up with…creative ways to get money. People go for teenagers,” Dean said before staring at the floor. “Some guys just don’t take no for an answer, or stop.”
“Oh my god, Dean,” Sam said as he glared at his brother. “Are you serious?”
“Teaching him how to drive,” Dean said with a smile as he looked back at his brother with blurry vision. “That was fun. He really liked it. You?”
“What? No. Why?” Dean asked.
Sam saw the two men whisper something to each other. He couldn’t hear what they said but he felt his heart drop when one of them smiled at him.
“Damn, never doing that again,” Dean said to himself.
“I know,” Sam said.
“You knew and never said anything?” Dean asked, his eye wide.
“Yeah, I wasn’t gonna change your clothes or anything, dumbass,” Dean said. “Plus, chicks dig doctors so who knows, maybe you’ll find a cute girl while we’re there.”
“Oh my god, I’m losing my mind,” Dean said.
As much as his reassurance was for Dean, it was also for his own benefit. He hated thinking about his time in the cage.
Sam glanced over at Reid and watched his chest move up and down. He almost found it calming watching someone breathing. It was so relaxing. The breathing had a pattern to it too. Breathe in. Breathe out. Repeat. It was relaxing to watch. With how bad Sam’s anxiety got, he often found small things that helped him calm down. And this seemed like one of them.
“Reid’s said that to me before,” Derek said before he sat down at the table.
“I can talk to people,” Dean said with a smirk.
Dean watched as letters appeared on the screen.
“Find who?” Reid asked from the doorway.
“Thank you,” Dean said before grabbing a bottle of syrup and leaving the room.
Peter never wanted to assume. But Dean saying he understands the feeling, it made Peter wonder if…
“Great. I gotta get to the hospital now for my shift. Don’t get drunk and trip down the stairs and dislocate your arm, again. Please,” Sam said as he got up from the table.
“Just…let me handle this,” Dean said to Cas. “Wait here.”
Thankfully, the way the dungeon was designed, the chair was bolted to the floor so whoever was tied to it was facing the wall. That wasn’t a positive for the person in the chair, not knowing who was behind you, but it provided a way for Sam to mentally prepare himself without getting stared at.
“Yeah, you kinda need to be able to talk to people to hustle pool,” Sam said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Reid didn’t want to try and turn around to see Sam. Sam was just outside of his view. If he turned, he could probably see Sam out of his peripherals. But then again, he didn’t want to risk pissing off the Winchester. So he stayed still. Well, he stayed as still as he was gonna get. His body was both frozen with fear and shaking because of the terror and the cold.
Dean froze and stared at his brother.
“Uh huh,” Bobby said. “Look, if you’re gonna make out, do it in your room. I don’t wanna see it.”
“Your car is gone and Sam isn’t here,” Crowley said.
Sam hung up the phone. Dean kept on tapping his leg as Sam typed on his phone. He stared at his screen before putting his phone back in his pocket.
“Thanks,” Reid said quietly.
“I am now,” Dean said. “Years later.”
Sam turned around and looked at his brother with watering eyes. He ran his hand through his hair with a shaky hand. Dean noticed this. A panic attack. Dean knew his brother, so he knew when Sam was having one. He recognized them ever since he first had one as a kid.
“Samuel, you’re as ridiculous as your brother at times,” Rowena said.
Reid’s anxiety screamed again. He couldn’t see what was Sam doing. He heard something clatter on the table. Reid’s mind automatically went to a table filled with torture devices and knives and guns. He didn’t know what to expect.
“Cas!” Dean yelled in between the coughs as smoke filled his lungs. “Cas!”
“Why?” Reid asked.
“What’s the plan?” Dean whispered.
“Do we have to go to school?” Dean whined. “I still have a concussion from knocking myself out. And he got kidnapped.”
“I bet,” Dean said before biting his tongue to stop talking.
Sam wanted to make sure Reid felt safe, so he put a hex bag into his pocket. The hex bag was supposed to help calm anyone who’s hand he held. So Sam was keeping the hex bag in his pocket and would just hold Reid’s hand. Plus Sam wanted to calm himself down so it worked for both of them.
“Yes. Yes,” Dean said with a smile as his eyes watered. “It means I’m happy.”
“Okay,” Reid said softly, in almost a mumble.
“How can I not?” Reid asked into the phone. “Our John Doe was found holding a machete over six bodies. My brain keeps on trying to piece everything together and nothing is making sense.”
“Sammy,” Dean said anxiously as Sam reached out to grab his brother’s arms for stability.
“Why would I?” Sam asked. “It’s your life. Your coming out. And besides, if I did say anything, I’d risk dad overhearing and…I couldn’t risk that, Dean.”
“Cas, can you…” Dean said before ushering to Reid.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.
“Kidnapped? By who?” Dean asked with a glare.
“What do you mean Jack is dead?” Castiel asked.
Reid could only hope they wouldn’t hurt him.
“Where were you?” Hotch asked.
“You choose. I got all the classics, black and white edition,” Dean said with a smile. “Dracula. Frankenstein. Invisible Man. All of those.”
“Dean Winchester,” Dean said.
Reid slowly made his way to the other the door in the room. He hesitantly grabbed the doorknob. The feeling in his hand hadn’t fully returned yet but it was enough that he could grab the handle. He opened it and saw it was a bathroom.
Sam struggled against their grips but had almost no strength from being cramped in the trunk, apparently all night given the fact that it’s daylight.
“Okay,” Sam said tiredly.
Reid looked at Sam, his breathing turning into also hyperventilating.
Dean nodded and got out of the impala. Sam followed and yawned, him stretching.
“I haven’t slept since I got kidnapped. Anyway, not the point,” Sam rambled. “So Jack Vaughan, that’s not his real name. No one knows his real name. But his serial killer name is actually something I know.”
“Yeah, we’re done,” Sam said awkwardly.
“Oh,” Peter said as he quickly put the handcuffs back down. “There’s a lot of handcuffs in here.”
“Please be okay, Jack,” Dean said to himself. “Please. I already lost Cas. I can’t lose you too.”
“Yeah, that’s usually how tattoos are,” Sam said sarcastically.
“The talk?” Reid asked hesitantly.
“The call isn’t going through,” Hotch said hesitantly.
“Are you okay?” Reid hesitantly asked Dean, who did a double take. “Losing a…losing a kid…is difficult.”
“You can pay me back by telling me who you’re in love with,” Rowena said.
Reid’s mind instantly started to panic. He was being forced to get a tattoo. Reid hated needles. And he hated pain. And he hated being touched. This was not going to be pleasant.
“Oh my god, you’re okay,” Sam said as he sighed in relief. “My anxiety couldn’t handle that. You were out for a while.”
“Thanks,” Roy said.
“Well I don’t care who
“My phone isn’t in my pocket,” Sam said as he felt his pants. “Oh my god, it probably fell out when I fell in the basement.”
“You were getting Sam’s phone from your basement? That’s why you needed to distract your uncle?” Castiel asked.
“You look like you live under a bridge,” Bobby said.
“What do we do?” Rossi asked.
“What is that?” Sam asked.
“His name is…was…Skip Westcott,” Dean said quietly.
“Because Bobby deserves to die,” Walt said.
“These Winchesters give me a headache,” Emily said to herself.
Dean nodded. He got up from the chair, Sam doing the same. Sam stumbled and held onto the table, Dean’s protective older brother instincts kicking in.
“I’m alright. Is everything okay, sweetie? You sound terrible,” Rowena said with a concerned tone.
“Did something happen, with handcuffs?” Jack asked hesitantly. “It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.”
Sam started snickering. As much as Cas’ zero filter policy was a hit to the chest at times, it was definitely amusing to watch. Especially when Cas was talking to Dean.
Sam rolled his eyes before Dean pushed him out of the way. Sam stumbled and bumped into the wall. He grabbed the coat hook on the wall and fell on the floor when it moved.
Reid closed his eyes. He heard Dean leave the room and close the door.
“We solve the case and figure out how to fix Reid,” Hotch said.
“Come on,” Sam said.
Reid felt his stomach turn. He was definitely in trouble.
“Good. You’re home. Listen,” Dean said before noticing Sam on the couch.
“I don’t care who you date,” Sam said.
I hope you liked the story though!!! I did enjoy writing it until the ending stressed me out. But it was fun to write regardless.
Reid was freezing. He was shaking. He was terrified. He was anxious and scared. Being at the mercy of Dean Winchester, and now Sam Winchester…that terrified him. He would never see his team again.
“So…your face is really red,” Sam said with a smile.
“I want proof he’s alive,” Bobby said with a glare.
“We’re not gonna be sleeping. We’re gonna be breaking into the basement,” Dean said as he rubbed his eyes. “But I still wanna see your tattoo.”
“Oh. Alright,” Castiel said as he continued eating.
Dean smiled before grabbed a towel to dry his hands. He froze when he noticed all the blood on his shirt.
“What the hell?” Rossi asked as him and JJ ran over to Jack unconscious on the ground.
“Look, I need a job. Can you help me or not?” Dean asked.
“So, what do you think it is?” Sam asked.
Sam started kicking the side of the trunk but gave up after realizing how tiring that is. He felt his breathing getting erratic and forced himself to calm down.
“Maybe there’s a key in here somewhere,” Jack suggested as they searched through the drawer.
“Because it’s a nice color,” Bobby said slowly. “Are you okay, kid? You’ve been acting weird ever since I got home.”
“We don’t have a choice, Sammy,” Dean said. “They have Jack.”
Sam heard the car stop and froze. He started panicking as he heard the car doors slam shut.
“He’ll be contacting you,” Sam said.
“Their uncle has a secret torture room in the basement of their house so Sam and Dean were wondering if he was a serial killer,” Castiel said.
“Thanks, Dean,” Sam said quietly.
Dean pulled out his phone and called one of the numbers. He impatiently waited for the ringing to stop.
Reid looked down at the symbol again.
“Excuse me,” Bobby said.
“Forget it. Let’s go. Bobby’s gonna come for him, we don’t need his brother,” he said before Sam got dragged out of the house.
“Dean kidnapped him and we’re now holding him hostage in the bunker and brainwashing him into being a hunter,” Sam said tiredly.
Sam got up and left the room, leaving Reid alone to his thoughts. Part of Reid wanted to be alone so he could think through everything. And part of him wanted to be with Sam.
Dean smiled at Peter’s awkward rambling.
“This room is so weird,” Dean said as they walked inside.
“Reid, I’m gonna hang up now because you need to get to your apartment and then you need to sleep. Okay?” Derek said. “Worry about the case tomorrow.”
Reid froze and stared at the chair. It looked comfortable, but it also had restraints. Reid looked at Benny with pleading eyes.
Peter had spent the night at Jack’s house watching Star Wars movies all night. And granted, they had popcorn. But Jack was part angel, which meant his metabolism was different. He had an iron stomach at times. He could eat all day and still not be filled. Him and Peter tended to bond over that. They would both order a lot of food when they spent time together. At least Jack had money because Peter was extremely broke. His stomach tended to thank him being friends with Jack because Jack’s dads would pay for the food.
“Very bad,” Dean said.
Jimmy glanced over at the bees before he turned back to Sam and Dean.
“That was a gunshot,” Garcia cried. “Is Reid…”
“Let’s go inside then,” Crowley said as he turned off the engine.
“As much as this plan is terrible, humans react adversely to things that are unknown to them,” Castiel said. “So how do you know this’ll work?”
“For about two minutes. And then you feel like crap all over again,” Dean admitted. “Alright, enough questions. Let’s watch some movies.”
“I know when your anxiety kicks in, Sammy,” Dean said after Sam gave him a confused look.
“I’m gonna give you two a…whatever,” Sam said awkwardly before he quickly left the room.
But then when he started breaking down last night after Dean had asked him if he liked Reid, Dean finally understood it. Sam did like Reid. Sam had told Dean it was because he reminded him of himself.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asked as he looked at Dean.
“So what’s the deal with the bot?” Dean asked.
Sam got pulled out of his thoughts when they walked into a room in the bunker. Sam felt Reid twitch and tightened his grip slightly to make sure Reid didn’t run away.
“Somethings wrong,” Dean said before walking to the door and trying to open it. “Damn, doing things with handcuffs on is difficult.”
“Dizzy, probably from stress,” Dean said before he sat on the floor and noticed a pair of handcuffs on the floor. “God, this whole place is…”
“Please close,” Dean said as he closed the door behind him. “Thank you universe.”
I’m always open for comments because they really do help me feel better thinking I wrote something good lmao. Anyway I hope you enjoyed the first half of the story.
“Do you think Bobby will show up?” Walt asked Sam with a smile.
“Woah, hey,” Dean said from next to Sam. “Relax. It’s me. The extremely handsomer brother.”
“Want me there?” Sam asked.
“Teaching Jack how to make a potion,” Rowena said as she smiled.
JJ and Rossi left the conference room.
“Reid. Reid. Relax. It’s me. It’s Derek,” Morgan said.
“Jack Vaughan is a fake name for the serial killer Yellow Eyes,” Sam said slowly.
“I’m gonna be completely honest with you,” Sam said tiredly, Dean nodding. “I barely caught any of that.”
Sam wanted this whole situation to be over as soon as possible. He was tired of it. So he agreed to take the easy way out. Which would be a big mistake.
“I assure you I cannot harm you. I will not hurt you, Dean Winchester,” CAS said. “I love you.”
Sam gave Cas a ‘help me with this’ look. Castiel turned to Dean.
Sam scrolled through his contacts and stopped at one of them. He clicked on it as Dean waited impatiently. Dean stared as Sam called the number.
“What about?” Sam asked anxiously.
“He isn’t here, and my dads wouldn’t hurt you. Sam is dating a woman named Eileen. And Dean only likes Cas, even though he’s bisexual. And Cas, Cas’ sexual orientation is ‘Dean’ according to Sam,” Jack said.
“Come on, let’s get this over with,” Sam said. “And then we give you the talk.”
Reid never wanted to turn his back to either of the Winchester brothers. He was too terrified that they would come up behind him and slit his throat. Well, he was more worried that Dean would do that. With the tiny amount of time he spent around Sam, he didn’t think Sam would hurt him, not unless he set him off.
“Kid, where are you?” Bobby asked.
“Hey,” Sam said softly. “Are you okay?”
3:01 AM.
“What do I do?” Dean asked anxiously.
Sam made his way out of the kitchen. He listened to the conversation that Dean and Cas were having. Cas called Dean a dumbass, Dean agreed and tried to apologize. The usual.
“CAS-TL. Computer Augmented  Superorganism Translation,” Jimmy said as he walked into a lab, Sam and Dean following.
“Well if we talk to Cas about Bobby then maybe he’ll give us a different perspective we haven’t considered. Cas doesn’t watch horror movies so he isn’t gonna think that Bobby’s a serial killer,” Sam said.
Sam nodded before Dean slid his plate over to Sam. Dean got up and grabbed a plate.
“Hey, Bobby,” Sam said as Bobby walked into the house.
“Thanks for always being there for me,” Reid said with a smile.
This made Sam stop in his tracks. The truth spell made sure Dean couldn’t tell a lie. And since Dean was currently telling him that it’s okay to have these feelings, it meant that he hadn’t inherited their father’s homophobic beliefs.
“The store was fine,” Bobby said as he ignored Dean. “I got beer and pasta. We’re having pasta tonight.”
Reid was speechless. His body was frozen but his legs moved, which Reid was thankful for. The more Reid got pulled down the hallway, the more he felt the feeling return to his arm. Sam’s grip was gentle. Reid threw that off as the feeling having not 100% returned yet.
“You’re not leaving, so get comfy,” Sam said before he left the room.
“Since I’m bisexual,” Dean said slowly.
“Let’s wait a little bit,” Dean said quietly. “I don’t wanna deal with him freaking out when I take the gag off, because I know feds and they’re gonna want to have proof of life.”
“Well I was with Sam,” Reid said.
Dean hit the door with his shoulder, him groaning in annoyance from the pain now shooting down his arm.
Reid tried to calm down but failed miserably as his mind ran through scenario after scenario of what could be going on. He froze when it clicked that he recognized his kidnappers.
“No, she won’t,” Dean said with a serious tone. “Look, I get it. Trust me, I understand that feeling.”
“Damn, he’s still out. How powerful is that hex bag?” Dean asked as he looked at Reid peacefully asleep.
Reid moved as far away from Sam as he possibly could. Reid was still on the bed, but the bed was against the wall. So he couldn’t move very far.
“Dean? Is everything alright? You sound awful,” Castiel said.
“What happened?” Sam asked Cas.
“You sure you don’t want a ride, Reid?” Derek asked from over the phone. “It’s not any trouble. I know how you feel about the dark.”
“Yeah, the hospital,” Derek said.
“Listen, I really do care about your exhaustion and I would usually drag your ass to your room so I would force you to sleep, but we need to talk right now,” Dean said.
“Hey, Cas, what’s…what’s up?” Dean asked as he tried to hide the fact that he was washing blood off of his hands.
“My powers aren’t at full strength after
Castiel and Crowley climbed out of the car and walked to the door. They knocked before Bobby opened it.
“Actually Dean should invite him over,” Sam said before giving Dean a look. “Cas is really smart and he figures stuff out quickly.”
“Anytime, pretty boy,” Derek said with a smile.
“The FBI agent we kidnapped,” Sam said.
“Yeah,” Derek said. “Someone has to keep an eye on your skinny ass.”
“Have you been here the entire time?” Reid asked.
“I have a bad feeling about this,” Castiel said.
“I would make him forget but I feel like I’m not at full strength to do that,” Castiel said to Sam. “And besides, his mind is…it’s incredible to say the least. It’s quite impressive actually. I doubt my abilities would work on him.”
“Hell yeah. I’m broke. I’ll take any money I can get,” Dean said before replying.
“How are you an FBI agent then if you don’t know self defense?” Dean asked.
“I’m glad you don’t stay dead,” Dean said.
Dean immediately choked on his beer and started coughing. Sam and Rowena froze and stared at Jack as Cas healed Dean.
“God I wish I was, just so I could forget this conversation,” Sam said.
“I’ll get him back,” Bobby said as he left the basement.
“You knew?!” Sam yelled.
“I’m not going to the hospital, Bobby. Where’s my brother?” Dean asked with a glare.
“Come on, not even us?” Dean asked.
“Where is he?” Peter asked.
“I wanted to yell at the tv and no one pisses me off like Dora. I gotta let out some of that anxiety about finals,” Dean said as he walked into the kitchen with a bag of chips.
“Well anyway,” Sam said awkwardly. “Yellow Eyes was a serial killer who kidnapped and tortured women mostly. It was his thing. He was never caught though. He actually owned this house. Isn’t it amazing that we found his actual torture room? That’s like…a once in a lifetime opportunity.”
Sam glared at his brother. Dean tended to do stupid shit a lot. Not that Sam didn’t also, but at times Dean tended to be the worse of the two.
“Cas, I’m fine,” Dean said as he grabbed a bottle of beer from the fridge. “Really. I am.”
“But kidnapping a kid isn’t worth it,” Roy said before the sound of gunshots echoed through the house.
“Hello?” Reid asked.
Reid wanted to stay on Sam’s good side. He was already on Dean’s bad side, that was proven by the events earlier when Dean dislocated his wrist after pissing him off. He didn’t want to get on both Winchesters’ bad sides.
“How long have I been out?” Reid asked.
“Hey, listen, it’s okay,” Sam said calmly. “You’re gonna be fine.”
“What’s your name?” Sam asked as he put the rag in his pocket.
Dean flipped off his brother, who reciprocated by also flipping him off.
“Well okay then,” Dean said awkwardly.
“Awesome,” Dean said sarcastically. “What now?”
“Um…did you…did you…why am I not in pain?” Reid asked anxiously before flexing his wrist.
“What?” Castiel asked.
“Is that good? I think that’s good,” Dean said to himself quietly. “God, this is so freaking weird.”
“Well too bad,” Sam said. “Look, I know that it’s not ideal, but it’ll stop you from getting possessed.”
“The dungeon,” Dean said hesitantly.
Rossi pulled out his phone after hearing it ring and slowly answered it.
“After the spells over, we’ll drop him off at his apartment,” Sam said.
Sam and Dean quickly ran out of the room. Dean closed the door as Sam ran up the stairs. Dean ran after his brother and into the kitchen.
“Okay. I’ll invite him over,” Dean said before dragging Sam out of the room. “Dora? Really?”
“Okay, so,” Dean said, Reid quickly turning around to look at Dean.
“Any luck finding Reid?” JJ asked as she walked into the conference room with a worried expression.
Reid froze. His wrist. His wrist was fine. How is that possible? They could have popped his wrist back into its socket but that didn’t answer the questions he had about not being in pain. Reid dreaded the Winchesters having given him pain medication. Even when Reid was in pain he never took anything, not with his history. Reid didn’t want to ask Sam if they gave him something for the pain, but he needed to know.
“Why does that name sound familiar?” Sam whispered to himself.
Crowley pulled the hook down and noticed the wall pop open. He slowly opened it and went over to Dean, who was leaning against the wall tiredly.
“Yeah. I’m good,” Sam said. “The anxiety kinda calmed down a little bit. So now I’m just freaking out a little bit.”
“Jack?” Castiel asked.
“I’d love to but he hadn’t talked since he got here,” JJ said.
“What just happened?” Peter asked as he tugged at the handcuffs.
“Okay I’m invested now,” Sam said as he jumped off the counter, Dean snickering.
“Oh I like him,” Bobby said to Dean, Sam snickering.
Sam reached into his pockets and froze. His eyes widened before Dean noticed Sam’s expression.
“Damn you have some lungs on you,” Dean said after twitching from the yell. “Yes, dumbass, we’re in California. I told you we were going.”
The food was good.
“Cool,” Dean said. “Cool. Cool.”
“No, she won’t,” Dean said. “I promise you. She’ll just be worried about if you’re okay.”
Sam helped Reid out of the bed and brought him into the hallway. He still kept his grip on Reid’s hand, firm but comfortable.
“Okay. And?” Dean said.
“It’s what?” Rossi asked, everyone looking at him now. “What do you mean?”
“Well we just got into Stanford a few minutes ago,” Dean said.
“I’m okay,” Sam said. “I’m okay.”
Derek walked closer to Hotch.
“Ever heard of, oh I don’t know, telling him you like him?” Bobby sassed.
“Get a room you two,” Sam said as he rolled his eyes. “Look, I appreciate you wanting to stay Cas, I do, but we gotta figure this out ourselves.”
Dean grabbed the beer from the table and chugged it.
“This is Jack?” Castiel asked.
“And what’s up with talking about Cas?” Dean asked.
Reid struggled against Dean’s grip before Dean grabbed both of his arms and pinned them behind his back. Reid started hyperventilating as Cas got closer, him immediately blacking out and collapsing on the floor.
Dean pulled out his phone and called a number.
“Isn’t that dangerous?” Castiel asked.
“I never should have let you do that,” Dean said.
“Anytime, brother,” Benny said with a smile. “So you mentioned a new hunter in training. I’m glad I can help. I’m assuming a regular anti possession tattoo.”
Reid immediately covered himself in the blankets as his eyes watered.
“What are you two doing?” Bobby asked as he watched Dean on top of Cas and straddling his waist
“Are you drunk or something right now?” Sam asked.
“Enough with that term,” Dean whined.
“Sweetie, it’s perfectly alright to care and be protective of someone,” Rowena said. “And it’s perfectly normal to doubt yourself after something happened.”
God his brother could be so stupid. It was just a simple witch hunt that Dean decided to go on. It would be quick. Sam decided to stay at the bunker because of his sleep deprived state. So Dean went alone. And that was obviously a big mistake.
Sam mumbled something as he woke up. He blinked his eyes and jumped slightly when he realized he wasn’t anywhere familiar.
“Jimmy? Hey. You okay?” Dean asked in a slightly weirded out voice.
“Um…” Sam trailed off.
“Sammy, hey, breathe,” Dean said calmly. “I’m not gonna judge you or anything, I promise. I’m the last person to judge you, especially since-”
“I know that,” Dean said with an irritated tone. “That doesn’t mean I don’t want him back.”
Reid blinked his eyes and saw bright lights all around him. He jumped before hearing a familiar voice.
“Six?” Jack asked.
“Next time, tell me when you’re going to leave and go kill someone. I’d like to know so I’m not surprised,” Castiel said.
“Anyway,” Walt said as he turned to Roy. “I grabbed today’s newspaper and there’s a crossword puzzle. I figured you’d want it.”
If the Winchesters believed this symbol stopped possession, then that could mean they want Reid safe. That could also mean that they wouldn’t hurt Reid.
“I get that but…” Sam trailed off.
“Nothing,” Dean said quickly.
“No, you’re not. Rowena said to take it easy. This plus your anxiety, you’re not going in that room. I’ll be calling his team,” Dean said.
“So Sammy just whispers stuff into this bowl and it’ll be in his head? Freaky,” Dean said to himself.
“Alright then. I gotta take out the trash,” Bobby said as he left his office and went into the kitchen, Sam running after him.
Sam nodded and rubbed his eyes.
“I need a drink. You want a drink?” Dean asked.
“Because of the bot,” Dean said.
“I’ll call Bobby later,” Walt said.
“There was a fire. It hit the natural gas line, blew up the wall to the lab,” Sam said as he rubbed his eyes. “Luckily I dragged you out of there before any serious damage happened. Your arm is burned a little bit, well your upper arm. It kinda looks like a handprint. Anyway, you’re probably gonna stay here for a few days with all the smoke you inhaled-”
“-wants to know if somethings wrong with me,” Sam finished before he rubbed his eyes to stay awake.
“Oh my god. You dragged me to California for this?” Sam asked with a glare.
“If you yell, the gag goes right back on,” Dean said from behind Reid. “Got it?”
“Do deer need chains and handguns?” Sam retorted as he looked at all the weapons lining the walls.
“It’s not my blood. Chill out,” Dean said.
“You understand?” Peter asked slowly.
“Oh. Well I wanted to bring Castiel back to life because you missed him. So I figured that if I was going to spend the rest of my…ever, in that box, I would wanna do something nice for you. You were so sad without him here. And then I blacked out. I woke up in this strange room covered in a sheet. And also without any clothes on so that was weird. But I’m okay. I got my clothes on and teleported out of there. It was my first time teleporting. It’s very exhausting actually,” Jack said before getting tackled in a hug. “Does this mean you’re happy? I think it does.”
“Whatever works I guess,” Bobby said awkwardly.
Dean felt his stomach turn as he looked around the room. He got dizzy and stumbled, Sam catching him.
“His body is missing,” Dr. Smith said.
“Is this real?” Dean asked.
“What’s with you? You’re exhausted,” Dean said.
Sam quickly walked past Cas and walked towards the room. He opened the door to the bedroom Reid was locked in and saw Reid waking up.
Sam heard Reid mumble something. He slowly blinked his eyes open and froze when he saw Sam sitting there.
Dean jumped when he saw a glass box filled with bees. Sam snickered at his brother.
Dean jumped and turned around to look at Peter.
“What’s Sam’s name?” Derek asked.
“Samuel will be alright. I’ll make sure he doesn’t do any witchcraft until he heals,” Rowena said.
“Your eyes are really blue,” Dean said with a smile.
“Holy crap, $20 bucks an hour, for texting,” Dean said before looking at Sam.
“Come on, we don’t have much time,” one of his kidnappers said to the other as he got pushed into the trunk.
“It’s Sam. Come on. We gotta get you out of here,” Sam said as he dragged Dean out of the room.
Dean stared at Sam, who was staring at his computer while sitting at the table. He snapped his fingers to get Sam’s attention but failed.
Sam woke up slowly. He glanced over at the clock on the nightstand and saw the glowing red symbols start to form actual numbers.
“Hey, I thought you were being nice to me,” Dean said as he ran out of the room after Sam.
“I am glad as well,” Castiel said.
“Now that breakfast is done, you sure you wanna do this?” Sam asked.
“Great,” Dean said.
“What?” Benny asked. “Brother, you are a different level of stupid, and that’s just a fact.”
“No, he didn’t. His wife died and his daughter ran away at a young age. We were all he had,” CAS said.
“That too,” Dean said before smiling at Cas.
“CAS-TL is a hive of European honeybees connected to a computer, which is designed to monitor their needs,” Jimmy said before he ushered to the hive of bees behind him.
“He’s waking up,” Castiel said as he walked into the kitchen.
“Where is he?” The other man asked.
“I can explain,” Dean said awkwardly.
Sam rubbed his eyes and noticed his clothes.
“Hey, Jimmy. How have you been?” Sam asked with a smile.
Derek looked at Hotch, who was frozen. Hotch didn’t know what to do. Neither did anyone else. Reid had been gone for a few days with no answer to calls or texts. And now he comes back saying he was with a serial killer, and is fine. And not just fine. He was smiling.
“You already gave it to him? He’s gonna be okay though, right?” Sam asked in a worried expression.
and when I say extremely I mean extremely, detailed explanation of how honeybees work. If that wasn’t a red flag, I don’t know what is. And it ended up talking about bears at one point, which is fucking weird. And it talked about pollinating flowers for like 3 hours. Like this was the weirdest shit I’ve ever seen, and trust me, I’ve seen some weird shit on the internet. But this has to be in the top 3,” Dean said.
“Cas, sober me up. I can’t even see straight,” Sam mumbled.
“Hello, sweetie, how have you been?” Rowena asked in a sweet and calming voice.
“Your kid?” Reid asked hesitantly.
Sam nodded. He got up from the table where he was reading a book and went down the hallway. He went into Reid’s room and saw Reid curled into a ball on the bed.
Sam looked over at Cas.
“I just touched them. It’s like they locked onto me,” Dean said as he tugged at the handcuffs.
“Are you serious?” Dean gritted through his teeth.
“It’s true,” Castiel said with a glare as they walked down the hallway.
“Um…Dracula,” Peter said with a smile.
Sam loved the bunker. He really did. But he hated how much sound traveled throughout it. It was ridiculous. With how much warding and magic and everything that was put into this place, the least they could have done was put up magic to stop even a pin dropping from being heard from down the hallway.
The Winchesters torture room made him want to throw up. Chains hanging from the walls. The chair facing the wall so you never know what just walked in and what’s behind you. The darkness. He imagined all of the victims who could have been in that room before him. He probably wasn’t going to be the last either, given how many times the Winchesters have escaped custody and faked their deaths.
That’s what Dean had said they were doing. But training for what?
“You’re gonna help us with something, kid,” he said.
“Oh, okay then,” Dean said awkwardly.
“Dean, are you alright?” Jimmy asked.
“Um…what?” Reid asked with a confused look. “Why are you yelling at me?”
“Unless you got any other ideas, we’re doing this,” Dean said.
Reid flicked himself. Snap out of it. He’s a serial killer. Reid tried to push down the feelings he had but he couldn’t.
“Reid,” Sam said again.
Hotch immediately called the number back. Everyone impatiently waited for an answer but only got a scared expression from Hotch.
“Jimmy, hey, you alright?” Dean asked as he shook Jimmy awake.
Jack smiled and quickly grabbed the pizza box from the fridge. He followed Peter out of the room.
“You have to chat with a bot,” Sam said.
“Don’t ever try that again!” Dean yelled as he got closer to Reid.
“Remember, Poughkeepsie means everything’s okay,” Dean said.
“It’s going fine, I assure you,” Castiel said. “I was surprised that you invited me over because whenever I try to talk to you, you end up running into the nearest wall. I was wondering if your field of vision was damaged after a few walls because you’re very clumsy.”
“What happened?” Dean asked.
“Morgan, it’s not your fault. Dean Winchester probably would have grabbed him anyway,” Hotch said.
As much as Sam looked up to his brother, which he would never admit to anyone, Dean was a dumbass at times. Sam rubbed his eyes to try and wake himself up more, and to try and get rid of the stress headache he was currently getting.
“Me too,” Peter said with a smile.
“I wanna see a body,” Dean said as his eyes watered. “It’s the only way I’ll believe my son is dead.”
Dean slowly walked into the room and froze. He felt his heart drop before Sam came into the room.
“Do you think Sam Winchester could have…stolen the body?” Emily asked as she tried to keep herself composed.
“But she’ll think I’m disgusting,” Peter said.
“He considers you his father more than Lucifer too,” Dean said to Cas.
“I got it,” Dean said as he stumbled out of the basement.
Dean walked to the door and opened it. He saw Reid on the bed and moving back away from him.
“Of course,” Jimmy said.
Reid glanced down and noticed his wrist handcuffed to the bed frame. He froze and looked at Sam, his eyes widened.
Before Sam knew it, he was outside the dungeon. He opened the door and walked inside. And then he made his way over to the shelf. He moved the shelf and saw someone restrained to the chair.
“No. I’m not,” Sam said as he bitchfaced his brother. “I’m just saying that kidnapping a federal agent…it’ll get us back on their radar. They already think we’re dead. I’d like to keep it like that.”
“Yeah, come on,” Sam said.
“I’ll distract Bobby while you break into the basement,” Sam said.
“That is easy for me,” Sam defended.
Sam smiled when he found a paper clip. He turned around and got startled by someone standing behind him.
“Is that blood?” Dean asked as he looked at the dried blood on the chair in the center of the room.
“Thank you,” Reid said quietly.
Dean threw his phone at the wall, Sam flinching slightly when it shattered.
“Your what?” Castiel asked, everyone awkwardly quiet.
“Do you want me to finish cooking the dinner? I’d be happy to do so,” Castiel said to Bobby.
“Thanks for coming, Benny,” Dean said as Benny walked down the metal stairs.
“I know there’s nothing wrong with it,” Sam said before stopping himself.
“Don’t do it,” Sam said to Dean.
Sam held out his hand. Reid slowly grabbed it and instantly felt a wave of…calmness. It was weird. Holding Sam’s hand made him feel calm.
“Reid,” Reid choked.
“I started to realize the limitations of communicating through chat. So I created this headset,” Jimmy said before grabbing an earpiece and putting it on.
Dean grabbed Bobby’s beer and chugged it. Bobby rubbed his eyes.
“Dean?” Hotch asked before the sound of a gunshot went off, the line also going dead.
“Are you doubting your witch boy skills?” Dean retorted.
“Other than the way you dress, I mean yeah I knew. It’s obvious,” Bobby said.
“You’re not in here, Squirrel,” Crowley said as he looked around.
Dean glanced at his little brother again before eyeing the road. Sam leaned back against the seat and sighed.
“I need a job,” Dean said hesitantly.
“There goes our only lead,” Rossi said.
“Angel, want a ride?” Crowley asked with a smirk as he pulled up next to Castiel, who was walking down the sidewalk.
Sam rolled his eyes. Dean looked at his little brother with a worried expression.
Dean did a double take. He looked at Sam with a confused look.
“I didn’t do anything, yet. I’ll text an address. Meet me here or I’ll skin him alive,” Walt said.
“Guest?” Rowena asked.
“Invite Cas over,” Sam said. “Because then someone can distract him while the other two go into the basement and get my phone.”
Cas turned back to Sam.
“Hilarious,” Sam said sarcastically as he stretched as best he could in the impala. “Where are we?”
Sam would date someone who liked to read books, who could talk about facts for hours at a time. And that was what Reid was like. But he doubted wholeheartedly that it could never, ever work out. Ever. Sam and Dean had kidnapped him after all.
“Sammy! Hey, you alive?” Dean asked as he hit Sam’s arm repeatedly to provoke a reaction.
Reid messed up.
“Sleep tight, Sammy,” Dean said as he covered Sam with a blanket.
“Where’s Sammy?” Dean asked tiredly.
Dean fumbled for his phone from his pocket, him struggling a lot due to the handcuffs. He stumbled and dropped his cellphone, along with falling on the floor and knocking himself out.
“I’m good,” Sam said as he got up. “I’m good.”
“Dean and Cas use them,” Jack said awkwardly as he tried to think of an answer.
“Thank you,” Rossi said before hanging up. “Jack’s body is missing. And the cameras in the morgue are destroyed.”
“Morning, sweetie, how’d you sleep?” Rowena asked with a smile.
“Would they let Reid go?” Garcia asked.
“Yeah. Let’s go,” Dean said as he grabbed Reid’s wrist.
Cas listened to the ringing echoing through the car before he hung up.
Reid froze as his limbs got freed. He felt Dean harshly grab his wrist and drag him out of the dungeon into the hallway.
Sam ran over to Dean as he struggled against the handcuffs.
“You okay?” Sam asked.
“We need to go visit your friend because the bot is alive or something. I don’t know but I need answers,” Dean said.
“Can we just go traumatize Spencer Reid now?” Sam asked. “I wanna get this over with.”
“Well somethings not right here, man,” Dean said.
“I’m not okay but Jack seems to help me,” Peter said with a smile. “I feel…safe around him, and you of course! You and Sam and Castiel! I feel safe around all of you-”
“What is it?” Sam asked. “What do you want?”
“You should tell your good looking aunt,” Dean said.
“Are you serious?” Roy asked.
Reid looked around and saw everyone staring at him.
“Get it yourself,” Sam said before walking out of the room.
“Go talk to him,” Dean said.
Reid looked at the plate from the bed. Waffles? He hadn’t expected to be fed. But then again, if the Winchesters wanted to prolonge this, they had to keep him alive. And being alive meant you needed food. Reid also noticed the water bottle next to the plate.
“Hello?” Dean mumbled.
“Sam Winchester,” Hotch said slowly.
“The coat hook on the wall. Pull it down,” Dean said tiredly.
Sam and Dean froze. They looked at Cas and Crowley, who were equally confused.
“Where am I?” Reid asked as he looked around the room.
“I did not…” Sam said slowly. “My phone died. It’s charging upstairs now.”
“Of course,” Rowena said with a smile.
Sam froze and looked at Rowena.
“Yeah, I need to get my eyes tested from all those concussions I’ve gotten,” Dean said awkwardly as he continued eating.
“Are you fucking stupid?” Sam asked.
“No,” Sam said with a glare. “Just…Poughkeepsie. That’ll be the code word. If we text you Poughkeepsie, it means we’re fine.”
“It’s permanent,” Reid mumbled as he looked at the tattoo on his ribs.
“Sam Winchester is a serial killer,” Hotch said hesitantly.
“Reid,” Hotch said from behind him.
“I killed their friend because their friend tried to kill me,” Bobby said. “It was years back and he lost it and went psycho. He just snapped.”
Dean didn’t want to bother Sam because he knew how hard that was, to keep something so hidden from everyone. So he just let Sam be in his room. He’d talk to Dean when he was ready. Whether that be in an hour or a month, when Sam was ready, he would talk to Dean.
“Maybe they…Stockholm syndrome maybe,” Derek whispered before he looked at Reid with a worried expression.
I hope you enjoyed it and I’m always open to comments and fic ideas.
“Best memory of Jack?” Sam slurred as he looked at Dean.
“I’ll tell her,” Peter said with a slight smile.
Reid nodded.
“Secret room, yes,” Dean said with an excited tone. “I call dibs on going inside first.”
Dean ran his hand through his hair with a shaky hand.
Reid felt his gun pulled from the holster, along with his phone from his pocket. He saw both carelessly tossed into the trash can a few feet away.
“Oh, um…” Jack trailed off slowly.
“There’s still some left over pizza so if you guys want that for breakfast, have at it,” Dean said.
“Maybe we’ll have better luck,” Hotch said.
“So, why do you need to see the boyfriend before school?” Crowley asked. “Skipping school with him?”
When Sam had explained the hex bag to Dean, Dean froze for a second. Sam had asked him what was wrong, and thankfully because of the truth spell Dean answered honestly. The answer wasn’t what Sam had expected though. Dean asked if he liked Reid. And Sam…Sam couldn’t answer that.
“Oh, then I’m good. I’ve done three spells…a day,” Sam said awkwardly.
“Focus on the wellbeing of the bot,” Dean said to himself. “Okay.”
But Reid couldn’t exactly say no. He could, but the Winchesters wouldn’t listen. They’d probably just tie him down and knock him out. Or maybe they wouldn’t even knock him out. Maybe they’d enjoy watching Reid suffer through the pain.
Sam ran up the stairs and out of the basement. He closed the door behind him and searched around for a paper clip.
Sam squeaked as he looked to Cas, who hid his smile.
“It’s just a question. How about you, Bobby? What would your M.O be?” Sam asked, Dean’s body tensing up.
“You’re a serial killer, Bobby,” Dean said hesitantly.
“Go to hell,” Sam said before getting punched in the face, him now coughing. “Bobby! No! It’s a tra-”
“I already do have a tattoo,” Castiel said, Dean coughing.
“Great. I’m gonna have a monster movie marathon if you and Jack wanna join in,” Dean said with a smile.
“Thanks, Rowena,” Dean said.
“Dean,” CAS said as he touched his shoulder.
“Whatever,” Sam said before yawning. “How long was I asleep?”
“I got them in the other room. Come on,” Sam said before he got up from the chair he was in. “Cas, can you go get some of Reid’s blood? We kinda need it for the spell. We only need like a drop though.”
“I just turned on the tv. It was the first thing on,” Sam whispered as they walked up the stairs.
“Sammy, it’s okay,” Dean said.
“I know,” Dean said as his eyes started watering. “I know, Sammy.”
“Kline. Lucifer’s kid,” Dean said. “We took him in and…I became so protective of that kid…and now he’s…”
Sam looked at Rowena with a pair of watering eyes.
“He’s locked himself in his room a lot,” Dean said sadly. “I keep checking on him. He’s researching something on his laptop.”
“I’m…I’m okay,” Reid said as he took a deep breath.
Reid remained frozen. The Winchesters were delusional. That could explain why they killed people. Maybe they thought they were monsters.
“Still!” Dean yelled. “You’re bees.”
Crowley smiled before he drove off.
“Can we just…do something that doesn’t involve handcuffs?” Peter asked awkwardly.
“Possessed?” Reid asked.
“Was he a monster?” Castiel asked as he tilted his head slightly.
“I panicked!” Dean yelled.
Sam grabbed the books and turned to Reid. He smiled when he noticed Reid’s expression change from worry to a slight smile.
“No,” Dean said with an offended tone.
“Samuel!” Rowena yelled, making Sam, and also Dean, flinch. “I said take it easy with the witchcraft!”
“No. No. It’s…It’s…I can talk about it…until I can’t,” Peter said.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.
“Where are we going?” Reid asked hesitantly.
“He can take care of himself,” Rowena said.
“I brought you a few books,” Sam said as he turned around in his chair to grab the books from the table.
“No. No. I’m good,” Sam said before yawning again.
Jack looked at Dean with a confused expression. Dean reciprocated before going back to unlocking the handcuffs.
“Yes, I’ve noticed that, thank you,” Castiel said.
“Progress,” Dean said.
“You’re possessing him,” Dean said, his eyes wide. “Cas, man, this is wrong. Jimmy was a real person. He probably had a family.”
“JJ, talk to Jack and see if you can get any information about the Winchesters from him. Who knows, maybe he’ll tell us something.”
“Cas helped you,” Sam added.
“Yeah, I do,” Dean said. “You’re gonna regret not telling anyone. Granted, your problem is dead now so that’s a plus. But I’m telling you, you can’t bottle that crap up. Not this.”
“Bobby’s asleep. It’s now or never,” Dean whispered as they walked down the stairs.
“You gonna do it?” Sam asked.
Castiel nodded as he left the room.
“I thought I was gonna die,” Reid mumbled.
“It’s okay. It’s okay,” Sam said calmly after noticing Reid’s reaction. “It’s okay. I only handcuffed you to make sure that you stayed in bed all night. Trust me when I tell you I’ve had my fair share of passing out and I didn’t want you walking around the room and possibly hurting yourself even more.”
“If you were a serial killer, what would your M.O be?” Sam asked Cas, Dean facepalming.
Dean looked at his shaking hand, which was now bloodied.
“How are you?” Sam asked.
“Yes, if he actually lets himself rest up, he’ll be fine within a few days,” Rowena said.
“I’m fine,” Sam mumbled as the exhaustion kicked in.
“Cas? The bot? Is alive?” Sam asked.
“Don’t piss off Sam and Dean Winchester,” Crowley said to himself before hanging up.
“This argument isn’t dumb or ass,” Castiel retorted before he looked at Dean. “Dean, in his infinite wisdom, kidnapped someone.”
Cas looked like crap. He was sitting at the table with a nosebleed and looked exhausted.
“They’re dead, Dean, it’s okay,” Bobby said.
Everyone froze and gave each other a look. Half of the expressions were confusion, half were just even more confused.
Dean took a step back.
“That would be a fire alarm, I’m assuming,” CAS said as he looked around the room.
“Let’s train him,” Dean said.
“Didn’t he have a brother?” Emily asked. “Dean I mean.”
“Okay so I need to distract my uncle,” Sam said to Cas. “Can you help me?”
“I like pink,” Bobby said.
“I know,” Sam said as he looked around.
“You can come out now,” Dean said.
Peter grabbed another pair of handcuffs at the same time Jack grabbed them. They both got startled when the handcuffs clicked together around their wrists.
“Is he okay?” Sam asked as he looked at Reid asleep on the bed.
“Goodnight, pretty boy,” Derek said before hanging up.
“Are you okay?” Sam asked with a concerned tone.
“It’s a long story,” Dean said before hearing the door open.
Reid could barely feel his arms as he got restrained. His brain barely processed the rag getting tied around his mouth too. Reid’s vision finally disappeared when the trunk of the car got slammed.
“Sam, I texted you earlier and you didn’t respond. Did you get the message?” Castiel asked.
“What do you mean Dean Winchester?” Derek asked.
“CAS,” Dean said.
Peter took another deep breath. He rubbed his eyes again before looking up at Jack.
“I’m a little calmer, so that’s something,” Peter said with a slight smile.
“Get in,” Crowley said.
Sam stumbled into the house. He got pushed into a chair and felt his limbs tied to it. Sam bitchfaced his kidnappers before one of them put a piece of tape over his mouth to keep him quiet.
“I can show you later if you’re so interested in it,” Castiel said.
“Very powerful actually,” Sam said as he rubbed the back of his neck. “Rowena said that I’m one of the most powerful witches she’s come across.”
“Hey, I’m listening to you now, man,” Dean said.
“What were Moose and Squirrel doing?” Crowley asked.
“I texted Rowena and she’s making a potion that’ll work for this. She’s gonna stop by when it’s done,” Sam said.
“I mean Dean Winchester,” Hotch said. “He wants Jack back.”
“Sweetie, I’ve been seeing auras for years. Yours is quite obvious that you’re in love,” Rowena said.
“Everything’s blurry,” Dean said tiredly. “Definitely another concussion. At least I didn’t get it walking into the wall after seeing you.”
“I’m fine,” Sam mumbled from the infirmary bed.
“Got it,” Dean said before kissing Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Listen, you let Jack go, and I let your friend go. Simple enough.”
“I never should have hung up the phone last night. I should have stayed on the line with Reid until he got back to his apartment,” Derek said to himself. “If I only stayed on the phone…”
Reid smiled. He got dizzy from the anxiety and leaned back against the pillow.
“You smell like waffles,” Jack said, Dean snickering.
Sam dropped Reid’s ankles and opened the door. Dean dragged him inside as Sam moved the shelf to reveal the dungeon.
“I could go for a beer,” Dean said before smiling at Sam.
“Both,” Sam said. “Neither. I don’t know. I just…look, we won’t know anything if we don’t investigate.”
Dean walked out of the library before Cas ran after him. Sam rubbed his eyes again. He tended to do that when he was stressed. That and biting his nails.
“No promises, bitch,” Dean said as he continued typing on his phone.
Reid turned back and stared as he watched the shelf get closed up. Even if anyone did find this place, they wouldn’t find Reid there. Their own perfect torture room. Reid never wanted to go in there again. Sam gently grabbed Reid’s wrist again and pulled him out of the room.
“Oh my god, Dean, they’re bees!” Sam said loudly with an almost dumbfounded look on his face. “Are you fucking dumb?”
“That’s good,” Jack said with a smile before Sam hugged him. “This is nice.”
“God, sometimes I wish I was still roommates with Adam,” Sam said to himself.
“There’s nothing wrong with being bisexual. I actually read an article recently that 1 in 6 Gen Z adults are lgbt,” Castiel said.
“What did you do?” Bobby asked as he left the room.
“I’m exhausted and Dean, being the protective brother he is-” Sam said.
Dean ran his hand through his hair. He glanced at his hand and saw it shaking.
“I’ll tell you later,” Sam said.
“You look like crap,” Dean said with a smile.
“You could just text me help or something along those lines,” Castiel said awkwardly.
“Oh, yeah, we took your brother’s car. We figured that, hey, if your brother sleeps in and Bobby doesn’t know, he’ll think you’re at school. It’ll give us more of a window for time,” one of the guys said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you completely stupid?” Dean asked. “Or are you just trying to get out of finals this year?”
“I’ll be ‘resting’ when I’m watching over Dean,” Castiel said before he stumbled out of the room.
“You killed their friend,” Sam said tiredly. “That’s why the tried to kill you.”
“There is?” Jack asked as he walked closer.
“No but you are,” Dean said.
“Sit,” Hotch said sternly.
“What about the torture room?” Castiel asked.
“I want,” Dean said before touching Reid’s shoulder, making him whimper slightly. “I want my kid back.”
“Your son?” Castiel asked.
“Fine. I’ll just skin your friend alive,” Dean said before grabbing the knife.
“Are you really bisexual or was that a lie meant to distract him like you said we were doing?” Castiel asked.
“I…I don’t remember passing out,” Reid said.
Dean glanced over at his phone and saw the notes he quickly typed up during his texting with Sam’s friend that hooked him up with the job.
“Goodbye, Skip Westcott. You will not be missed,” Dean said to himself as he watched the last bit of blood go down the drain.
“Not much. I’ve had a pretty boring life,” Bobby said.
“I don’t know,” Jack said.
Dean woke up slowly to a beeping noise. He blinked his eyes and saw Sam sitting next to him in a chair.
“Why would I…” Reid trailed off.
“Can you uncuff me now?” Reid asked hesitantly.
Before Reid could even react or apologize to Dean for pissing him off, he got knocked on the floor. The sound of something popping echoed through the room, Reid’s wrist now screaming in pain.
“Wait. So…So you mean I’ve been talking to a bunch of bees this whole time?” Dean asked.
He stumbled into the room. Reid looked around and noticed that he was in a bedroom with another door in the room. He jumped back when he saw Sam in the room scrolling through his phone.
“My phone wouldn’t be in the basement if you hadn’t pushed me. And it also wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t break into the basement, so you’re getting it,” Sam said.
Sam and Dean Winchester.
“I get that, Dean,” Sam said with a smile. “I mean why are we in the impala and where are we going?”
“The second thing,” Dean said before running his hand through his hair. “I just…I…I like Cas and he certainly likes me, I think. Crap now I’m doubting it. Anyway, what do I do?”
“Yeah,” Sam said tiredly. “I had to stay late. A multiple car pile up happened and I got stuck at the hospital.”
“What’s your favorite color?” Castiel asked.
“I’m gonna kill these Winchesters,” Derek threatened quietly.
Cas. That name again. Sam mentioned him before. Was Cas a doctor? Maybe the Winchesters had kidnapped him years ago and created a Stockholm syndrome effect on him.
Dean glanced at Sam holding Reid’s hand. He didn’t say anything. He wanted to talk to Sam about him coming out last night but never got the chance before Sam bolted out of the kitchen and hid in his room all night.
“Sammy. Sammy. Slow down. What?” Dean asked.
“Jack’s body is missing,” Dr. Smith repeated. “As in he’s not here. The cameras are destroyed, they’re all fried. Someone stole his body.”
“Alright,” Dean said.
“Because I’m not obsessed with serial killers,” Dean said with a glare.
“It’s me, Dean, it’s CAS-TL,” CAS said with a smile.
“Can you just leave him alone?” Roy asked. “He’s just a kid. He doesn’t deserve this.”
“I already have a tattoo, Dean,” Castiel repeated.
“I read his file. He can barely shoot,” Sam said. “So I don’t really think he’ll be any threat.”
Dean grabbed the key and unlocked the handcuffs on Peter’s wrist. Before he could even get to unlock Jack from the handcuffs, Peter had run out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
Crowley froze and looked at him weirdly.
“How do we get them off?” Peter asked anxiously.
“You ready to do this?” Dean asked. “I can handle it myself if you want me to.”
“Oh thank you, phone. I’ve missed you,” Sam said as he grabbed his phone. “Thanks, Dean.”
Walt scoffed. He rolled his eyes and grabbed a glass of whiskey from the counter.
“Yes,” Dean said quickly.
“What is this, the 1980s?” Dean asked.
“You mentioned your uncle was a hunter in the past so it’s probably that,” Castiel said.
“Yes,” Rowena said.
“Hey,” Sam said before stumbling.
“Protect me from what?” Reid asked.
“Dean, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Sam said.
“They’re probably at school, where you should be,” Bobby said.
“So you can protect yourself,” Dean said before silently yelling at himself for the truth spell.
“No,” Dean said. “I…I think CAS is alive.”
“This is the part of witchcraft you’re going to have to accept. It’s called taking breaks. Don’t overwork yourself. I’m surprised you haven’t passed out,” Rowena said.
Cas glanced at Jack and Peter as they walked into the kitchen. He turned back to Dean and noticed the blood.
“Am I interrupting something?” Dean asked with a smirk.
Reid felt his body lock up and freeze as the thought of Dean Winchester being behind him filled his mind.
“I wanted to spend time with yo-” Dean said before he quickly covered his mouth to stop himself from talking.
“Nephilims aren’t supposed to exist,” Rowena said. “Maybe that just…caught up with him.”
“Now that they’re out of the kitchen, who’s blood is that?” Castiel said quietly.
“No,” Dean said with a glare.
Sam landed on the floor with a thud. Dean rubbed his eyes before hearing Sam snoring slightly.
Peter nodded.
Sam quickly left the bedroom. Dean rubbed his eyes.
“If you’ll give me a ride to Dean’s I would appreciate it,” Castiel said.
“I don’t wanna talk about this,” Sam said before he got up.
That wasn’t a lie at all. Dean and Cas do use them when hunting. So Jack was fine with saying that.
“Kid, hey, you’re okay, you’re okay,” Bobby said as he ran over to Sam.
“Sweetie, I need a hug too,” Rowena said before Jack hugged her. “Thank you.”
“Cool,” Peter said with a smile.
“Of course. I’ll be expecting your texts tomorrow saying everything is fine,” Castiel said.
“Do what?” Rowena asked.
“It’s been days since Reid disappeared,” Garcia said sadly.
“I am. I’m not trying to have finals in a few weeks,” Dean said.
“Deal,” Reid said tiredly.
“Please. Please. Don’t do this,” Reid said anxiously. “Please.”
“Dean and I are not dating, I assure you of that. And no, I’m not skipping school. I’ve never found the point in skipping school because when you miss one day of school, you miss quite a lot and that can get overwhelming,” Castiel said.
“Sammy!” Dean yelled as he ran over to Sam and hugged him.
“You’re so bossy…and short,” Sam mumbled before he fell asleep.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sam asked as he walked into the kitchen.
Reid made his way inside and anxiously grabbed the handle on the sink. He turned the water on and felt the warm water hit his body. His hands were freezing. He needed to warm them up.
“Okay,” Reid said before he sat down.
“Dude! The bridge is right there! Blind bitch!” Dean yelled at the tv.
“Reid, what were you doing with Sam while you were gone?” JJ asked.
“The job consists of talking,” Sam said.
Reid twitched when the chair Sam had set down hit the floor. He turned to the Winchester and froze. Sam was smiling. It wasn’t a ‘I’m gonna enjoy torturing you’ smile. But it was a genuine smile, and it was also filled with worry.
“If you were to have a tattoo, what would it be?” Dean asked.
“Dean…Dean killed him?” JJ asked as tears filled her eyes. “Dean killer Spence?”
“I think we better go somewhere else that’s not here,” Peter said awkwardly.
“Fine,” Dean said before ushering Reid to speak.
“What is it?” Sam asked before seeing Dean struggling against the handcuffs now attached to his wrists. “What the hell did you do?”
“He recognized me as Dean Winchester. I didn’t think of anything else, I only thought of kidnapping him to make him stop recognizing me,” Dean explained.
Reid woke up slowly. He twitched when he realized he was in the room Sam had put him in.
Hotch froze as Garcia started typing on her tablet. He knew the name. Sam Winchester. Serial killer. Legally died after him and his brother went on a killing spree and died in police custody. They we’re going to investigate the case but they never got the chance. After the Winchesters died, they still had open cases with actual alive unsubs. So they never looked into it.
Sam snickered while Dean glared at Jack.
“Your Winchester stupidity strikes again,” Rowena said with an eye roll before putting a plate in front of Dean.
Sam often couldn’t help it when the Winchester sarcasm and sass came through.
“Jack passed away yesterday,” Hotch said, Dean freezing. “The coroner couldn’t come up with an answer as to why but…Jack’s dead.”
“I can’t believe this,” Castiel said as he glared at Dean. “Actually I can because of Winchester stupidity.”
Dean sniffled and rubbed his eyes.
“Making sure Reid believes us with hunting. It’s a spell. It opens his mind so it’s more suggestive,” Sam said. “All we have to do is whisper stuff into the bowl and it’ll be in his mind.”
“Come on,” Sam said as he grabbed Reid’s wrist gently and pulled him out of the chair.
Dean started typing on the keyboard.
“Wait. Wait. Wait,” Hotch said quickly. “I…I need to talk to my boss. It’s not up to me to release your friend.”
“Listen, just hear me out. The bot talked for like 6 hours straight about honey. And it gave an
“Aw, I hope the sweetie pie angel is alright,” Rowena said. “I’ll be coming by immediately to help.”
“Do you think Peter’s okay?” Jack asked.
“I get it,” Sam said with a glare.
“Oh are you a doctor now?” Sam sassed.
That’s when Dean showed up. Dean Winchester. He recognized him instantly. The same Dean Winchester who has legally died repeatedly. The same Dean Winchester who went on a killing spree. The same Dean Winchester who has a brother, who is also like him.
“How are you feeling?” Sam asked calmly with a concerned tone. “You hurt your head pretty badly.”
“You should relax the rest of the day though. It might help you feel better,” Sam said before he handed Reid a plate with a sandwich on it.
“You okay?” Dean asked.
“Ready?” Sam asked Rowena.
“Where have you been?!” Derek yelled.
“We need to call his team to make a trade for Jack,” Dean said as he got up from the table.
Sam nodded as Dean dragged him down the hallway. Sam pushed open his bedroom door and fell on the bed.
Reid looked up at Sam, his eyes puffy. Reid had been crying. Sam didn’t blame him. Reid seemed like the type to cry when stressed. And this definitely was a stressful situation.
As the water hit his hands, he started crying and breaking down. He was never going to see his team ever again.
Dean didn’t exactly want Peter to know that he had killed Skip. He would bring up too many unwanted memories. Granted, last night didn’t bring fun memories, but knowing Skip was dead would bring back all of the memories. He never wanted to have Peter deal with that.
“I don’t know. And…I don’t want to know actually,” Peter said, Jack nodding. “His name was…Skip Westcott. And he ruined my life.”
“Dean,” a gruff voice said from behind them.
“Sammy? Is that you?” Dean called out from the other room.
“I…I can’t…I can’t breathe,” Sam said anxiously before he ran after Dean. “Dean!”
“Would you rather me have left you at the house?” Dean asked.
“His name is Sam Winchester,” Reid said.
“Did someone own the house before you?” Castiel asked.
Sam panicked as his mind raced for a lie to come up with.
“Why?” Rowena asked.
“What’s going on here?” Dean asked as he saw Sam pouring ingredients into a bowl.
“Special Agent Aaron Hotchner,” a stern voice answered.
“Yeah, by demons,” Sam said nonchalantly.
“About two days,” Derek said hesitantly.
“Me too,” Sam said quietly.
“Cas?” Dean asked as he tried to focus his eyes.
“And our only leverage,” Derek said as he tried to stay calm. “I’m gonna be sick.”
“Get Dean to the hospital. I’ll be back,” Bobby said.
“How are we gonna do this?” Sam asked.
“Come on. It’s Bobby,” Sam said anxiously. “Bobby can’t be…there’s no way.”
“Okay,” Sam said awkwardly.
Reid had blacked out before he could even pull out his gun.
“Stop hitting me,” Sam mumbled.
“I will be,” Peter said from the doorway.
Sam and Dean Winchester. He felt his heart drop to the floor. Sam and Dean Winchester, the serial killers. The same brothers who have killed countless people, went on a killing spree across the country and died…multiple times. The same brothers who were on the FBI’s Most Wanted List, repeatedly. The same brothers who don’t have an M.O that he could find when he studied their case files late at night.
“Oh,” Reid said awkwardly. “I was fine.”
Hotch nodded.
“Alright then,” Benny said.
“Look, if we train him to be a hunter, then we don’t have to worry about him being a problem,” Dean said slowly. “This could work.”
Reid’s eyes adjusted to the brightness of the hallway, allowing Dean enough time to close the shelf. Reid froze as he realized that his team probably wouldn’t ever find him in that room.
“Of course,” Castiel said.
Before Sam or Dean could say anything, Rowena hung up the phone.
“Sammy,” Dean said as he walked into the kitchen.
“Not quick enough,” Castiel said tiredly.
“Sammy!” Dean yelled.
“Where is our hostage?” Sam asked as he bitchfaced his brother.
“It’s the hex bag I made,” Sam said tiredly. “It took a lot of energy to make that.”
“Your friend Jack was arrested for decapitating six people,” Hotch said.
Reid got brought back to the situation at hand when he heard Dean opening a door. Reid got pushed inside the room before the light turned on.
“Oh. Right. That. I’m fine,” Dean said nonchalantly.
Sam and Dean pulled away from the hug before Jack stared at Cas.
“Of course, sweetie, I’m always happy to help,” Rowena said with a smile.
“Where’s your brother?” The other guy asked.
“Being touched again after…after him…it took some getting used to,” Peter admitted. “But I can be touched now, so that’s some progress. He did…Skip did…handcuff me…once. I can’t…not again.”
“I pissed off Dean, and I shouldn’t have,” Reid said as he stared at the bed.
Reid nodded anxiously before Dean left the room. Reid heard running getting closer to him and saw Sam and another man, the one the tattoo artist told to knock him out. Reid just curled into a ball on the floor before he passed out.
Truth is, Dean had gone to Jack’s room last night to check up on Peter and had overheard the conversation while outside the door. He didn’t want to intrude, but he did overhear...everything.
“But…But that isn’t a thing nowadays,” Dean said. “We stress ourselves out by worrying if the other person likes us until eventually the problem sorts itself out.”
That’s when he heard it. The noises. The noises coming from down the hallway.
Sam facepalmed before grabbing Bobby’s beer. Bobby didn’t even try to stop Sam from chugging his drink.
Sam got cut off by a piece of tape over his mouth again. He glared.
“I wouldn’t tell anyone,” Bobby said.
“Now he’s locked in there,” Sam said quietly before stumbling.
Reid’s limbs kept shaking the colder it got in the room. He tried to look around for any details about the room but only got met with darkness. He saw the vague outline of a symbol on the floor but couldn’t make out what it was. He felt his stomach turn again when he noticed that there were chains hanging on the wall.
“If by you seeing me alive then yes,” Castiel said before looking at Sam and Rowena. “Is something wrong? You drink but not this much. You only drink like this when somethings wrong.”
Reid felt his heart skip some beats when he saw Dean dialing a number. He put it on speaker.
“Things?” Jack asked with a confused tone.
“I can train you from now on,” Sam said before smiling at Reid.
“I don’t even know what the fuck I am,” Sam said as he walked away.
“Um…I’ll find a paper clip upstairs,” Sam said before he quickly left the room.
Dean started pacing back and forth across the room.
“Thank you. What is this job anyway?” Dean asked.
Reid flinched when the door unlocked and opened. He was still covered in blankets, which was kind of a blessing in his opinion. The Winchesters would have to rip off the blankets to get to him.
“Oh, and I brought you this too,” Sam said as he pulled out a fidget toy from his pocket. “It helps with anxiety for me so it might help you.”
What had happened?
“Shut up,” Dean said to Sam.
“Those are probably from when I was restrained,” Reid said quietly before looking at Derek. “What happened?”
Sam stayed quiet. Dean noticed his hand shaking before he went into the glovebox and handed Sam a fidget spinner.
Cas nodded and got closer to Reid before he touched his forehead. Reid instantly saw darkness before he could even process what was going on.
“I wasn’t planning on it,” Derek said.
“I am too with that scoff. So what if he’s just a kid?” Walt asked.
He hadn’t expected to be asked that. Maybe that was apart of the Winchesters tactics. Be nice. And then the torture. Maybe they liked creating a Stockholm effect in their victims before they killed them. Reid dreaded being a victim of the Winchesters, especially one who’s succumbed to Stockholm syndrome.
“I…I remember he said something to me…during the fire,” Dean said quietly as he thought back. “He said…he said…goodbye, Dean.”
Sam quickly jumped on the couch and turned on the tv as the front door opened.
“Love you,” Dean said with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Reid still remained frozen. As much as he wanted to do anything the Winchester had told him, he couldn’t. His body wouldn’t cooperate. His body locked up and froze. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t breathe. He was absolutely and completely frozen.
“Sams a little busy right now,” Walt said with a smile.
“I teleported to Rowena after I left you and our hostage,” Castiel said gruffly. “I needed to get the cure for Dean quickly.”
Cas went over to Dean and touched his forehead.
“You’ll never hurt my brother, and you care about him, a lot,” Dean whispered into the bowl.
“No,” Sam said in a hushed yell as he turned his pockets inside out. “Look, Dean. No phone.”
“Waters good for you,” Sam said awkwardly. “Plus you’ll need to be hydrated for this.”
“Can he what?” Reid asked as he alternated looks between Dean and Cas.
“Because Jack got arrested by the feds,” Dean said. “And we’re trying to get him back.”
Reid felt his heart drop. They were keeping him. For how long? Reid’s anxiety told him that would be forever.
“A pedophile,” Dean said.
“Unfortunately,” Sam said before he bumped into the wall.
“What happened?” Castiel asked as he ran over. “Are you alright?”
“Jack? That’s his name?” JJ asked.
Sam stayed quiet.
“I can’t believe you actually believe that,” Sam said as he rubbed his temples.
“Why stop asking you questions? Do you not like answering my questions?” Reid asked.
“I still don’t believe you, because now you can actually lie again,” Castiel said dryly.
Dean watched as Jimmy sat up and smiled at him.
“Sammy,” Dean said as he nudged his brother awake.
Hotch froze.
“It’s okay,” Jack said as he tried to reassure Peter.
“I like your tattoo,” Dean said with a smile.
“So what do we do?” Sam asked.
“Thank you,” Sam said. “If there’s anything you need, I got you.”
“Please don’t leave me,” Reid mumbled.
“Me? It’s your phone,” Dean said.
“Why is everyone looking at me weirdly?” Reid asked.
“Maybe a pair of horns,” Dean said with a smile. “Or my car.”
“I love you,” Dean said with a smile as he grabbed a plate. “I really do.”
“You sure you’re okay?” Dean asked.
“You’re anxiety plus not sleeping for well over a day made you sleep that long. Chill out, Sammy, you’re fine,” Dean said.
“Okay then,” Dean said slowly.
“Sammy, I can handle this,” Dean said. “Why don’t you go take a nap or something?”
“Monsters?” Reid asked.
Dean took a breath and sighed. He looked at Peter again.
“I don’t like answering questions while under a truth spell,” Dean snapped before realizing what he had said.
“I know why he hasn’t let us down. It’s because there’s alcohol,” Sam said as he pointed to the alcohol on the shelf.
Dean bit his tongue to stop himself from talking before glaring at Reid. This glare was far more intense than any of the glares he’s ever gotten from Dean before.
“Does anyone else know?” Dean asked hesitantly.
“I’m worried about Jack too,” Dean said.
“Are you okay? What’s wrong?” Reid asked as he noticed their expressions. “Is everything okay?”
“Sam and Dean were going to be doing something incredibly stupid that would be potentially life threatening. So I want to know if they’re alive or if I have to call the police,” Castiel said.
