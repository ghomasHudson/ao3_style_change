Cas turns to face him. “Say goodnight, Jack.”
Dean doesn’t remember kids being this exhausting.  Hell, he was barely more than a kid himself when Sammy was Jack’s age, and they handled it just fine.  But it’s only past one and Dean’s ready to throw in the towel.
Jack pours him some imaginary tea and spends a good long while making sure Dean holds his teacup to Jack’s exacting specification. “No! You hold it like this!” And proceeds to demonstrate.
“Shit!” Dean hisses, making a grab for him before he tumbles off.  Who knows if the kid’s capable of cracking his head on the floor or not but Dean’s not gonna risk it.  Add that to the list of things he’s gonna have to pry out of Cas when - if - he gets to it.
“He’s not
Dean finally notices the woman holding Jack’s hand.  She’s got a full face of make-up on, immaculate hair, a whole bunch of jewelry and an expensive yoga outfit.
“Takes one to know one.”
Dean feel the tears well up. He can’t have come so close only to lose everything all over again. “I want to try. Will you let me?” He reaches out, instinctive, but stops himself. It surprises him when Cas reaches back, grips his hand tight where it’s resting on the counter.
He hears Cas call out softly for him but he ignores it and walks out the front door.
Jack giggles.  “You’re loud!”
“You forgot to hold my hand in the store and that’s why you got losted!”  Jack smiles up at him.  “Don’t forget next time.”
Kept themselves safe.
In the silence, Jack’s sobs are as loud as gunshots.
Jack shakes Dean’s hand in exasperation. “Dad!”
he texts back even though he’s already 3 blocks from Kelly’s apartment.
She looks him up and down, frowning. “You better.” She gets up and brushes off her dress. “C’mon, I need help finding Anna’s book - we’re gonna need to pull out the big guns for this.”
“I’ll see you at the house tomorrow, Agent Page.” Castiel holds open the shop’s front door for him.
“I’m thirsty,” Jack says.
For sure, Cas totally understands, standing there staring dumbstruck at the handsome man singing his baby to sleep.
Jack wedges himself between two prominent roots and whispers his secrets into one of the knots, as is his habit. Castiel smiles, content, and thinks he feels a little less of his habitual loneliness.
Jack smiles up at him.  “‘Kay!”
“No naps!” Jack sing songs, bouncing in his seat.  “No naps!”
“Daddy says stop when the light is red, when the light goes green, you can go ahead,” Jack sings absently over a smeared mouthful of ice cream.  “Hold my hand and look both ways, then we’ll be safe wen we cross today!”
“I’m done!” Jack says and thrusts the badge back at the agent.
“What!” Dean rolls out from underneath a vintage Porsche, frown slowly melting into a smile when he spots them. “Hey, blue eyes.” He wipes his hands on a grease-stained rag as he gets up. “And baby blue.”
And while he’ll admit the closest thing he’s had to a date in the last half decade has been Dean pureeing carrots and apples for Jack in the kitchen of the Winchesters’ shared apartment, there are some things he keeps just for himself. Like the idle daydreams of absconding with Jack and hiding away in aunt Amara’s villa on the Amalfi coast.
“Just a little headache, buddy,” Claire reassures, throwing him a wink, while gingerly leaning against the kitchen counter.  “I can take you to school.  I don’t want your dad flaking out on work again.”
and I have a couple of things we need to discuss.”
“The hell!” Dean yells, startling both Jack and the cat.
It’s the ass end of dawn when Dean finds himself clinging to the edge of the mattress, Jack’s foot pressed firmly against his kidneys, but it’s the best night’s sleep he’s had in a long time.
“You’re okay,” she whispers, running soothing hands up and down his arms. “We’re okay. Just let me do all the talking and we’ll be in the clear before you know it.”
“Glad you had fun, kid,” Dean says as he works the straps of the car seat.
“No, you may not,” he replies, longsuffering.
“What?”
He looks back and Jack’s hitting himself on the chest.  “I was bad.  I was bad.”
They get to the beach eventually.  But first, he promised the kid ice cream.  They stop by a quaint-looking tourist trap of a bakeshop and Jack gets a couple of scoops of caramel crunch the size of his head.  The middle-aged lady behind the counter is a sweet doting motherly type and she smiles fondly at Jack as she hands it over.  He thanks her exuberantly and dives in.  Dean bites back a smile.
He’s gonna handle it.
Cas considers him, careful.  “I’m sure you’re very capable.”
is going on here?” he roars.
have to work with me. They’re sharks, they can sniff out weakness. Don’t be weak, Castiel.”
“Mighty presumptuous of me when they haven’t asked me to.”
He takes out the linens, plates and cutlery, silently hands them to Claire as he gets out the cups and condiments. They make their way out into the garden where they set the wrought iron dining table. Claire has a contemplative look on her face and Castiel lets her work her way to articulating whatever it is she wants to say. Regardless, it will be mortifying.
Dean hesitates. It shouldn’t be this easy. His conscience eats at him. “I’m sorry I wasn’t always a good dad to you and I’m sorry that I get angry and scare you.” Jack scoots close and puts a hand on his shoulder. “I want to be a better dad to you, Jack. I’m still learning, though. I’m not gonna be the best at it, but I want you to know that I’m gonna try my best, okay?”
Cas takes the bandaids from him and shuts off the tap. His shoulders are stiff and his movements are jerky and he’s glowering but his hands are soft when they cradle Dean’s arm to inspect the scratches.
“So, y’know, see you soon.  Hey, Jack, tell Cas that we’ll see him soon.”  He holds the phone out and Jack obliges.
Claire, of course, blazes along. “Do you drive it fast like Bullitt?”
The emotion follows him all through to dinner, where he’s content to sit and listen to Jack and Cas talk about their day, only speaking up when prompted. He volunteers to do the dishes, just for something to do that isn’t sitting around basking in the reflective warmth of family.
“You were out drinking,” Cas says as a statement of fact.
“Doesn’t matter. He didn’t even want us knowing he wasn’t dead - ”
Castiel snatches the candle out of his hand. “Please leave.” He tries to herd Agent Page towards the door.
“It was the only way he would leave the shop,” he reasons, fiddling with her quilt. It’s one of the very first ones he’s made and it comforts him to know that she’s kept it all this time. It makes him believe that they’re still in this together, no matter what. “He was making a scene.”
He can see him shrug from out the corner of his eye. “What can I say? The early bird gets the worm.” Agent Page runs a finger over a goldenseal leaf and makes a contemplative sound. “I thought I told you to call me Dean.”
Anael squints at him, considering. “Well, we could always add in a banishing potion to the mix.”
Dean grunts.  There’s the mother of all headaches jackknifing its way across the left side of his skull.  The morning light’s coming in at an angle through the flimsy lace curtains over the window that says it’s this side of too early.  He’s gonna need a shitton of coffee before he can deal with this.
Jack giggles at him, doing that thing kids do where they laugh because someone else is laughing.
She blinks. “Fine. Lead the way.”
“You know what?”
Jack sighs impatiently, grabs Dean’s hand and tries to pry his pinky up and out.
Cas’s expression softens. “Of course.”
He resolves to concentrate on the chicken rice dish he’s making.
“We’re headed home now, don’t you worry.”
.  His vision’s blurry and he’s been on the constant edge of a ruined sneeze since he woke up.
“Jesus,” Dean mutters, half-disgusted by the alarming display of West coast suburbia.  He makes his way to the bar where he’s relieved to see there’s at least some poor schmuck in a suit methodically working his way through a basket of onion rings and smelling like a distillery.  Some things remain universal.  It’s almost comforting.
She crosses her arms and rolls her eyes. “I peeked out the window first!”
“Do you have a gun?” Claire asks, looking skeptically up at the agent.
“That I can do.”
“I’ve decided to be helpful and call the school and let them know Jack’s not showing up so the teacher’s assistant - who thinks she’s BFFs with Cas, by the way - doesn’t put out an Amber alert.  You’re welcome.”
“See you tomorrow, Cas,” he smirks, and finally leaves.
“Is he your special friend? Kevin Tran’s mom has a special friend and Kevin thinks he’s gonna be his new dad.”
Jack squeezes his arms around Dean’s neck in a hug.  “Thank you!”  He presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek.  “I love him so much!”
“Agent Page,” Castiel responds curtly, refusing to make eye contact, busying himself with taking the herbs from his basket and sorting them into piles on the kitchen counter. “I thought we agreed on 11.”
“I don’t know,” Cas says, clearly holding back his amusement. He turns to Dean. “Do you want to play tea party?”
Jack tugs him along and they reach the sandy shore.  “Birds!” Jack says excitedly, pointing at some gulls flapping around in the water.  He does a little anxious dance and drops a scoop of his ice cream into the sand.  He looks down, stops for a second.  “Oopsie-daisy.”  He thrusts the rest of the melting cone at Dean.  “I’m finished.”
He gives her a considering look.  “Gonna talk.”
Claire, having finally tired of wrestling the gourd into submission, comes to stand in front of him. “Can we see your gun?”
“Mwah!” Jack smacks a kiss to his open palm and waves. “Bye!”
Cas smiles conspiratorially down at Jack.
And so it begins.
“But…but…but… birdies!”  Jack pouts up at him.
He and Cas have an argument - because of course they do - about Dean taking the couch. He’d been too hungover that first night to realize he’d kicked Cas out of his own bedroom so they have a fight over Dean offering to sleep on the couch that Jack curtails by declaring a sleepover.  He spends that first night in bed with Cas, Jack cuddled up between them.
“And then Bluey and Bingo danced to the lollipop song!” Jack says.  “It goes like this: LOLLIPOP LOLLIPOP, YUMYUMYUMYUM!”  Jack stands on his chair and starts dancing.  “LOLLIPOP, LOLLIPOP, YUMYUMYUMYUM!”
The Impala’s not really built with child safety in mind, for a start.  He eventually manages to jury rig the thing on using some rope and the lap belt with Cas standing on the front porch, very pointedly silently judging him.
He tells himself he can do this, that the worst’s already happened, that he’s got nothing to lose. He picks up the bouquet of flowers and the box of See’s nougat candies he’d picked up at one of those roadside tourist traps, takes a deep breath, and gets out of the car.
“How much of an asshole you are,” Jo says with a sweet smile.
Dean shrugs, helpless. “Not sure I know the rules.”
He’s used to sneaking in to places, is the thing, but that fucking cat comes out of nowhere and attacks him. He smacks it away on instinct, tripping over a potted plant. The cat lands on an end table, keys and knickknacks crashing to the floor. It yowls and hisses at him.
“Sorry, I don’t think my finger knows how to do that,” Dean says, biting back a smile.
“Yuck,” Jack says, making a face, but obligingly tilts his head back as Cas uses a scoop shaped like a whale to rinse shampoo from his hair, Cas’s palm cupped protectively over forehead, careful not to get water in his eyes.
“Two harps and I got you a platter of the nachos you like, Claire,” Alice interrupts, serving up their beers.  She smiles, waiting for acknowledgement.  Claire lets her dangle for a bit.  Oof, that hurts, Dean thinks and tries to remember if he’s ever done anything this side of vague  assholery.
It’s a good start.
Cas’s lip trembles. He closes his eyes and breathes out a quiet surrender. “Yes.”
“I’m not asking you to choose,” Dean says, mouth dry.
Jack scrunches his face up, thinking.  “Uh huh.”
She ignores him from where she and Jack have clambered onto the window bench and have their faces pressed up against the glass, trying to see into the garden.
“Don’t give me that!”
He doesn’t wait long.
Jo shrugs. “Suit yourself.” She nudges them towards the break room and rifles around the fridge while Cas tries to prevent Jack from putting a straw he’d somehow appropriated from who-knows-where up his nose.
“Auntie Anael’s awake!” she argues.
And if that’s always been the major driving factor that’s pushed her out of the house and into the world fighting her lost causes…it’s never been a secret between any of them.
Castiel smiles, amused. “No, we’re not.” He crowds Agent Page up against the stove. The agent looks around helplessly, looking for an escape. “If you could move out of the way, I need to get started on breakfast,” Castiel says, pointedly looking at the stove.
So when two FBI agents rolled into town in their big black car looking for her, Amelia Richardson had never felt more vindicated in her life.
“Dean,” he says, trying to wiggle off the counter.
“Daddy, what does that mean?”
Claire makes a face.  “Gross, Cas.”
Jack accidentally whacks Dean in the side of the face as he waves goodbye to Mr Gallagher, yelling a ‘thank you!’ directly into Dean’s ear drum as he does so.
He holds up his hands in mock surrender. “I’ve got pancakes and bacon,” he says, a peace offering.
Jack doesn’t seem to hear him.  “I’m sowwy.  I didn’t mean to.  I’m sowwy.”  He’s hyperventilating and it sounds like he’s close to dry-heaving.
Cas smiles to himself. He appreciates having thoughtful and efficient colleagues. Jack’s whereabouts firmly established, he gets back on his bike and cuts through the park, thankful that he doesn’t have to get on public transit at the height of rush hour.
, Samuel. They don’t mean anything to people like you and me”, she said, with a dismissive hand-wave. “I meant it when I said you are the closest thing of a seasoned witch I’ve seen in a while, and you could be good at it, too.”
“Last time, it was around here”, Ash said, pointing to an area full of green pins. “Near where we found Charlie. We could take this route here, skip through most of the B’s, but then –”
“I have to.”
“What exactly are we supposed to be looking for here?” Rufus asked, pushing a couple of books off the shelf. “There’s no doors here.”
“Sure, but we also don’t have Chuck to keep your liver from failing, so…”
“Not enough juice. Hell, I can’t even keep one measly little angel asleep, much less fix this up. And why should I care, really?” it shrugged. “I was the only thing keeping those things out there from coming to this side and eating you people up for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but you have no respect! You think you can stroll in and out, disrespect my sleep, whenever you want! I just wanted to sleep, Castiel! Why couldn’t you just.
“I think I need a drink”, Ellen said, massaging her forehead.
That left the handful of reapers awakened by Castiel, led by Tessa and Billie. The two had crossover back into the land of the living – dead but also not, thus prime candidates for the role of Death after the demise of the last one; though which one of them had stepped first was unclear, as both donned a version of the Ring on their finger.
“Yeah, but they’re – they’re
And with a snap of her fingers, they too were gone.
, you mean.”
Dean pulled him out, cradling him close to his chest. “Hi, buddy.”
He was the first to fall through. The others came, one by one, with Sam being the last – he had to give a boost to some of them so they could reach the ceiling, which for him was the least humiliating thing that had happened that entire afternoon (but certainly not for Rufus).
“He did, but… she
“It doesn’t matter”, he said, turning back to the Shadow. “You have to let us out now. If one angel awake was bad, imagine a legion of them. We’re never going to give you peace.”
“Only died because of your brother’s bad writing”, he filled in, quickly. “Don’t you think they deserve a second chance, now, without the burden of Chuck’s decisions controlling them? Don’t you think
Sam hanged up first, while Dean held back for a moment, staring out of the window of the bedroom and into the beach just outside his door. Cas was outside, sitting on the sand, his purple linen shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a straw hat barely hanging on his head as he tried to build a castle with Jackie.
. God, you’re always in such a hurry, aren’t you?!” she hassled, getting up from her seat. “Now, I heard through the grapevine that a while back, the Empty invaded Heaven, isn’t that right, lad?”
“What happened here?” Cas asked.
“What do you mean, not anymore? What happened?”
“But you’re the Goddess, you have the power, you
And then a head popped out of it.
“Aw, that’s romantic”, the Shadow interrupted, rising from the ground. It had, once again, tried to take on Cas’ form, to unfortunate results. “Told you he was gonna come for you! And now that he cleared the doorway to the other side, I can pass through and eat my way through the buffet. And I’m starting with you two lovebirds.”
“It’s okay. You made a mistake. It happens.”
Sam laughed. “Jody thinks he and the girls can be a good influence on each other.”
“The angels told us… when Jack tried to bring you back, that you were happy. That you were in a shared heaven with dad.”
“I – nothing, Rowena. I’m not exactly a witch.”
“What did you expect would happen to me once you let them drag me here?” she asked, coming closer.
“She made you a demon?” Sam asked.
“What is that exactly?” Dean insisted.
“I know what
“Missed you too, kid. All of you. Is that your
“Apparently it just… came up during the after-party, all on its own.”
boy. As he ought to have been.
“Can you take us to her?” Jack asked. He had mostly been observing the place – he had never been to hell before. It was not like he imagined. He figured there would’ve been a lot of more…extra-dimensional torture aspects, instead of some old caves.
Jack paused. His hands were shaking. “Okay. Okay, let’s do it.”
“It’s… it’s not going well. Bobby’s bunking with Rufus – they drop by every other day. The Harvelles are reopening the Roadhouse. Ellen promised she’s gonna include some non-alcoholic options, if you ever want to drop by.”
”, he corrected. “We’ve been relocating people, providing food supplies, helping during the full moon… we started out on Kansas City, cleaning up the mess Michael left, but Garth’s been getting in contact with some people he knows, and I got in touch with Mia, that grief counselor we met… We’re trying to figure out ways we can help each other thrive, even studying the possibility of using vampirism or lycanthropy as a way of curing disease, providing the person takes the cure right after…”
“The Empty? What’s that?” Jo asked.
“Or the guys, when he was soulless”, Charlie added.
Castiel picked him up, wrapped on the clothes of his former self, though he didn’t understand quite what had happened. “Why is he – why is he like this?”
Rowena took a deep breathe. “That means it had to get to Heaven
“What about Rowena?” she suggested.
It was the Roadhouse again, as it had been the last time, and Ash was there again, passed out on a couch, but it was not a memory; there were other people, people who he’d definitely never met before while alive.
“No, I –” he hesitated. “I can’t see him.”
“No! We’ll work something out. We’ll find another way!”
“You… took care of it? How?”
would want that?”
“Seems to me like both of you did”, Amara said, leaning back.
“It wasn’t… my fault”, Cas said, struggling to stand up.
“Ehh. You say tomato, I say potato.” It shrugged. “At the end of the day – do you really want to stay awake, thinking about all the misery you caused, when you could just spare us both and take good, long, forever nap?”
“Without the angels, the place isn’t as strong as it used to be”, Mary explained. “The walls… they were thinning out. Your friend there, Ash, he started going through heavens, pulling people along. He found Ellen and Jo and Bill, and they found Bobby, and he found Rufus and me, and I found Charlie and Kevin… Mostly by accident. I thought they were the other ones. From the other universe.”
“Can’t you stop it? Can’t you
have God’s powers. I can sense it all over you. Yeah, I think we can make something work.”
“Dean, he… he’s gone.”
Followed by a body, and all of the respective libs.
“You okay?” she asked.
“Should I bother to ask what you’re doing here?” Amara asked.
“Well, reality is safe. You can get out now, right?” the Shadow asked, making a gesture for them to leave with its hands.
“It was
“And why would you want to do that for?” she insisted.
. You had to rescue some guy and then go back in line, but then you… fell. And for what?
“Then I’ll give it to you. All of Chuck’s powers, I’ll give them, and you fix it.”
“Of course I can give you the spell, darlings, it’s not even that complicated”, she said, lounging on her throne. “Just a little myrrh, little something or another – nothing that you don’t have on that old bunker of yours. The problem is, if Jack himself can’t open a rift, why do you think some magic spell can?”
Michael held back. He had been the last to arrive at the Empty, and for him the situation was a little more complex. “Is Adam alive?” he asked Sam.
“I’m – I’m not – I don’t –” Sam babbled, looking from Dean’s shit-eating grin to Eileen’s crooked eyebrow.
“Not really, I don’t think so”, the boy scratched his chin. “And the reapers can’t let them stick around anymore, either. That’s the new order of business. It’s not good for anyone, right?”
“Donna’s betting it in a week, but I believe they are mature enough, so I’m giving it two.”
“Just the two of them is enough”, he said. He rubbed the palms of his hands against his pants, following Anael down the corridor.
“Hard to say. But to me, he looks… human. Maybe it will regenerate over the years, maybe it won’t. If anything happens, we’ll help. Now…” she smacked her lips. “I think it’s time for you to head home.”
“The Queen of Hades it is, then. Come on, Persephone, lead the way”, he said, gesturing to Sam, whose ears perked up.
He turned around. The Shadow was there once again, its arms folded against its chest; it had taken Cas’ shape, except not…quite. The cracks seemed to have reached it as well, and half of its face kept switching between Castiel’s and others – Gabriel’s, Michael’s, Meg’s, Ruby’s, Hannah’s, Billie’s. Either it could not decide… or it could not stop itself.
He laughed. “I’m a
In a second, the room around them blipped in and out of existence, and in the next, the group had left the Roadhouse. They were standing in a small, cozy study: there was a red armchair next to a tall lamp by a window, whose view kept changing outside. There were bookshelves covering each wall, but all the books looked the same – nameless, blank, only there to fill space. Most, anyway; there was also a collection of
“Yes, please!”
“I shouldn’t condone this but, yes, he is a little strange.”
“Huh,” he eventually says.
“I’ve wanted you even before I knew what it was to want,” Cas finally says into the still quiet in the kitchen. “I’ll always love you. You’re an inextricable part of me, how can I not? But these months with Jack - I’ve come to realize all over again what it means to be a father and all the joy and heartbreak it entails. I’m his
“From his bag,” Cas says blithely.
“Whatever,” Dean bites out.
Dean’s running his hands through his hair, clearly frustrated.  “Fuck.”
Dean smiles to himself.  The kid’s got an easygoing nature.  Always has.  Good to know that hasn’t changed.  He turns on the radio and puts it on low, keeping an eye out for the turn onto Wilson.
“Claire, do you have an owie?” Jack asks, eyes wide and concerned.
“Bacon!” Jack cheers, sniffing the air theatrically.
to try to love Cas and make him happy, he wants to work towards absolution.
The old man tells him and Dean pulls out some cash - no sense in using any of the fake credit cards.  Jack kicking his legs while he tells Claire just how much he loves her and will miss her makes paying a little challenging.
“Claire!” Castiel scolds.
“No,” Dean says, sudden and harsh. “No.” He moves closer until there’s just the kitchen counter between them. “It shouldn’t be that easy. I’ve done some pretty unforgivable shit to you - ”
They finally make it home and he carries Jack up the steps to Cas’s house.  They’re both covered in what’s left of the marionberry pie that Jack somehow managed to get both on himself, the car floor and on Dean as well when he went to clean the kid up.  Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been as exhausted as he is now - not even fighting for his life every minute in Purgatory.
Jack happily claps along to the beat.
“You heard me,” Anael sneers. She turns her back on him. “Castiel, take the kids inside.
Happy endings are relative, after all.
It lingers in the air between them, palapable.
Claire shoves Jack with her shoulder and he falls face first into Agent Page’s chest.
“Aw, Claire, five more minutes, please?” Jack begs, making with the puppy eyes, hands clasped under his chin.  Beside him, his friends do the same.
He’s got a handle on it.
“I won’t poison it,” Castiel says, tilting his head and looking up at Agent Page through his lashes. “I promise.”
Claire wasn’t too sure how to feel about being the ‘normal’ one in this ‘family unit’ but if it stopped people from trying to call Child Services on Cas and Jack, she could roll with the punches and take one for the team.
“There he is!”
“Huh?” she says, trying to keep her hold on him as he does his level best to dive under the passenger seat.  “Marvin who?”
“Hey, this is different.  Jack’s got permission from an adult.”
“Enough.” Castiel crouches down and looks at Claire, stern. “Claire, we don’t hit people. Apologize to your brother.”
Cas bites his lip. “Hello, Dean.”
They make their way through the garage proper, Jack waving an enthusiastic hello at everyone they meet.
“Yeah,” Dean says, flustered.  “Spaghetti and some pie.  Most of it ended up in Baby’s backseat but I ain’t complaining.”
“Tell your father I said hello! And don’t forget about Sunday school!”
Jack holds up his hands. “I’m all wrinkly!”
“If you go away, maybe he’ll show it to me!”
But the sun shines kindly down on them, gilding them in an almost blinding halo.  They’re happy, they have each other, angel and god-child.  The grass is still green, the flowers are still in bloom and the insects buzz gently overhead.
“Anael,” he says, stopping her with a hand to her shoulder. “I wouldn’t intentionally put my children in danger.”
“Eh,” Dean says, flippantly.  He finds the antihistamines and scans the shelves for the brand he likes.  “A little truancy never hurt nobody.”
Castiel sees Jack and Claire run out of the room. He stands up and goes back to his busywork. “You said you had questions. Ask them.”
Claire groans and heads for the coffee machine by Dean’s elbow.  “Kill me.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Oh, of course, why didn’t I think of that.”
If you stay you won’t be sorry - Kooks, David Bowie
They’re quiet for a long while.
Jesus.
“So, Mia?” he broaches, watching Cas reach for a ceramic pitcher on one of the kitchen cabinets. He has to stand on his tiptoes. Dean can’t help but find it absurdly charming. He’s embarrassed for himself.
Jack’s tracing the patterns on his teapot with his finger. Dean waits him out.
Cas sighs, knowing where this is headed. “Yes, I did.”
Dean decides that that’s another existential crisis he’ll have on another day and braces Jack against one arm, navigating around the hissing cat on the floor to the door.  There’s a framed photo of Cas, Claire and Jack hanging on the wall.  They look happy.  He smiles to himself, cups the back of Jack’s head unthinkingly.  Jack snuggles closer.
Dean grimaces. “Christ, Sam, what did I say about the Hallmark moments?”
“Dean’s staying anyway!”
“Hey, buddy, it’s time to go home.”
Cas nods. “Mia’s pleased with the progress they’re making.”
“Thanks,” Dean grins, settling into a seat across the table. “It got a little dicey there when Jack wanted them shaped like frogs but it turned out alright, if I do say so myself.”
Dean clears his throat. “That’s, um, that’s good. Good for Jack.”
Castiel comes awake slowly. He’s warm and comfortable, buried under his quilt, and there’s a pair of bright blue eyes staring right at him.
Dean grits his teeth, clenches his fist and tries to keep the anger at bay.  He’s had almost a year of practice - funny it hasn’t gotten any easier.  Better to be angry than to let the overwhelming nothingness take him.  Right now he isn’t sure what to think let alone parse what he’s feeling.  He wants to run back to Cas, grab him by the shoulders, as if that would be enough to tether an angel to the earth, never let him out of his sight, have things be like they were before, to just
By all accounts, Jack was a bright and happy child, prone to the same fits of daydreaming and flights of fancy that afflicted every other child his age. He made friends easily, both in daycare and with the neighbourhood kids and, as such, had an overly full social calendar to the utter bewilderment of his flighty father, who already had such a nebulous relationship with the concept of time under normal circumstances.
Gabriel Milton, surprisingly enough, became a somewhat respectable businessman.
“What’s an agent?” Jack asks.
He gets up and gets started on breakfast - puts the coffee on and makes pancakes from scratch.
“You tell me,” Agent Page says, the corner of his mouth twitching - in amusement or frustration, Castiel can’t parse. “Look, he was last seen with your sister before he up and disappeared. You can understand my skepticism - ”
“Just get in the car.”
As tradition dictates, they save their visit with the large oak tree on the edge of their property for last. It’s breathtaking and incongruous, with its immense trunk and large pendulous branches curving toward the earth. It should be humbling, to be faced with something so ancient but Castiel has always found comfort in being close to the old oak tree. He lays a palm against its trunk and closes his eyes, feels the hum of connection, of belonging.
“You followed me?” she hisses, incredulous.  She tries to step out onto the porch, shut the door behind her, manoeuvre him back, but he’s one step ahead of her.  His boot’s on the threshold, palm spread wide pushing back.  He may be an old guy but he’s still stronger than she is.  “Seriously?” she glares up at him.
“What do we say, Jack?” Castiel prods gently.
“Now,” Dean says, drily. “
He makes a face.  Claire catches his expression and they laugh.
“Agent Page is coming by tomorrow to ask me some follow up questions.” Castiel’s feeling lightheaded at the thought of seeing the man again. He collapses onto Anael’s bed.
Agent Page looks like he’s praying for strength before he snatches the spatula away. “Outta the way. I got this.”
“It’s so serious out here!” Anael breezes out of the house, screen door slamming shut behind her. “Oh! Agent Page, are you joining us for brunch? How nice!” She seats herself unnervingly close to him and smiles winningly. “Coffee?” She holds up the carafe.
“You’re a mess,” Dean chuckles.  He looks around for something he can use to clean the kid’s face before he resigns himself to using his shirt.  Hell, it’s damp already where Jack had pressed his face against it.  He grabs the hem of his shirt and puts it up to Jack’s nose  “Okay, kid.  Blow.”
“Uh, good. I’m glad for him.”
“Oh,” she says, waving her hand in the air.  “You know how children are, always getting into trouble.”
Speaking of.
She says she is all the better for it but Dean sincerely doubts that.
“Hm.”
“Look, I don’t know what you’re trying to pull here - ”
Claire sighs.  “Look - ”
It’s a reflexive unthinking gesture, unbearably sweet. For some reason it flusters Dean.
“Yeah. ‘Course.”
“That’s good.” Cas crouches down and touches Jack’s hand. “Dean is here. Do you want him to come say hi?”
Claire makes a show of checking her watch.  “Sorry to interrupt, but we’ve got to head on home now.  Got to pick some things up from the store for dinner.”
Jack jumps, startled, and almost falls off the bed.
Jo smirks and toasts him with her soda.
Jack beams right back at her.
“Who’s saying that?” Dean replies, affronted on behalf of his Baby.  She isn’t
He doesn’t know how long he stands there, unsure of what to do next when he hears Jack say, “Dean?”
There’s a beat where Dean thinks he’s going to be left hanging but Cas eventually takes the gifts, smiling in bemusement. “Thank you, Dean,” he says sincerely.
“Excuse me?”
“Oh, right,” Dean says, returning to reality. He takes a step back, watches as Cas pulls out his phone and shuts off the alarm.
Dean fights back a smile, pats him on the back.
He pulls his arm out of her grip. “
Cas smiles, hefts Jack’s diaper bag over his other shoulder. “Goodbye, Bobby.”
“Cold,” Cas hisses, when Dean runs his hands up and down his back.
Jesus, the kid’s
Fuck, it’s breaking Dean’s heart to see him like this.  All of three and he sounds so scared and confused.  Dean gets out of the driver’s seat and gets in the back next to him.  He puts a comforting hand on Jack’s shoulder.  “Don’t cry,” he begs softly.
Jack giggles.  “You’re funny, Claire!”
Castiel laughs and they make their last stop before heading back into the house, Jack sneaking strawberries into his mouth the whole way.
He’s an intruder here.  Clearly unwanted.
“That’s…nice,” Dean says, at a loss for words. God needs therapy. Huh.
Claire looks at him mutinously for a moment but ultimately decides against arguing with him. “Fine,” she says and turns to look at Jack. “I’m - ” she stops and gasps. “A star.”
Jack smiles.  “But it’s okay now.”
Jack and his friend Andy look up from where they’re busy burying their other friend Shawn in the sand.
“Ain’t nothing,” Bobby waves him off. “The rugrat’s growing on me. Dean’s out back - I’ll let him know you got Jack.”
Jack swings Castiel’s hand back and forth. “Claire’s still ‘sleep.”
So of course they have to go get lunch.  They go to a bar and grill next to the bakery and Dean learns the hard way that you do not let kids order spaghetti off the menu and that three year olds don’t have the manual dexterity to eat pasta without assistance.  Dean’s flannel is sacrificed to the cause and he tips the server extra for being patient with them while he hauls Jack off into the bathroom to get cleaned up.
“Gross,” Jack says, inspecting his own snot.
“You’re supposed to chop those,” Castiel says helpfully. He flicks an idle finger at the cauldron and the concoction stirs itself counterclockwise.
“I’m pretty sure he’s a hunter.”
“Are you okay with that?”
Castiel has to turn away to hide his amusement. He busies himself with stripping the herbs from their stems.
“Thank you, children.” Castiel pours batter into the pan and pokes it into shape with his spatula.
The man laughs.  “I don’t think I’m the one you should be thanking.”
“What?” he blinks a few times in confusion.
“Down right hospitable of you.”
She’s less inclined to be indulgent with him, which, fair, he
Dean opens his mouth to argue but Cas has already closed the door.
“Lost a bet in high school,” Agent Page says, self-deprecating, gently prying Jack’s fingers off his t-shirt. “You know how it goes. I’m just glad it’s not a tribal tat or a tramp stamp.”
Sam’s quiet for a while, clearly processing.
“Me first, please!” Claire says, climbing over the table and making a grab for the syrup.
Jack reaches out hugs him tight around the neck.  “I miss you!”
Dean manfully tries to ignore all this as he pushes out into the sidewalk.  “Call me if you get into any trouble,” he warns.
He eventually gets up, hot and sweaty and thirsty and unscrews the cap on the bottle of whiskey. He goes to take a drink but stops himself.
They stand there awkwardly. Dean scratches the back of his neck.
“You got any better ideas? Please feel free to share with the class instead of moping around like a consumptive Victorian maiden.”
“You’re missing normal school today but I’m gonna introduce you to the most important school of all: the school of rock.”
Well, Dean’s very pointedly judging him back for having a car seat with hot pink flower patterns all over it.
Dean feels something approaching paternal at that.
Jack jumps to his feet.  “Okay!”  He grabs Claire’s outstretched hand and pulls her in the general direction of where they parked.  “Bye, Shawn!  Bye, Andy!”
“Oh, shit,” Sam says. “I gotta get going. Eileen says she just managed to book us some face time with the head pathologist down at Northwestern Memorial.”
They’ve barely managed to set their bounty down when Claire bursts into the mudroom.
Cas picks him up, tucks Jack’s face into the crook of his neck and shushes him gently. “I’m going to put Jack back to bed.”
“What’s in it?”
It’s not a new thought. He’s often wondered about it, especially on those days he’d been able to try with Jack. It’s not surprising; Bobby’s the blueprint, after all.
“Oh!” he yells.  “Marvin!  I found Marvin!”
- for what, he doesn’t know. What he does know is that it subsides, if only for an instant and then only marginally, when he comes and sits by the oak tree.
“He started it!”
“Jesus,” Dean says, as they walk in.  “You’re burning the bacon, Cas.”  He hip-checks Cas out of the way, swiping the spatula from him.  “We got coffee?”
He finds her in what was once intended to be a sitting room but has long since been repurposed into an extra pantry-slash-drying room.
When he’s as clean as he’s ever gonna get, Claire picks him up and buckles him into his car seat.  Jack pauses his storytelling when Claire starts the car.
“I’m gonna be just like Claire when I grow up!”
Sam hums thoughtfully.
“Hey,” he says, accepting the call and starting Baby up.
Sam huffs. “Dean…”
Dean snorts.
He takes a sip as if to prove it to himself.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Agent Page says, patience clearly wearing thin from the tone of his voice.
“My sentiments exactly.”
Dean rolls his eyes.  The kid’s going to day school, not war.
Cas splutters. “Excuse me?”
Jack’s carefully putting Dean’s cup back on its saucer. “Hmm?”
Cas huffs out a laugh, making his way down the hall. Dean gives in to the urge to go after them.
Jack face scrunches up - he’s thinking about it. Dean waits and hopes. Jack eventually nods his permission. “Can we play tea party?”
“Will do,” Dean says, shooting her a thumbs up as he makes his way to the checkout counter.
Jack’s stiff in his arms.
The very same stories Castiel tells his own children when he tucks them into bed.
“Daddy,” Jack says patiently, “they got yucky.  I threw them in the ocean.”
“Claire,” Cas says, patient, while he cuts Jack’s bacon and eggs into bite-sized pieces.  “If you’re feeling unwell, I can ask Albert to open up for me.”
He would know when. He isn’t like his old man.
He pulls up to the blue house a little past five and parks next to Cas’s beater. He’d driven up and down the coast, psyching himself up, mulling over what he’s going to say, worst-case-scenarios playing out in his head. He’s glad he’s timed it right, that Cas and Jack are home - any later and he’s sure he’d have talked himself out of this.
He hurls it down the beach, listens for the satisfying crash of glass as it shatters against the rocks.
Agent Page gets to his feet and Castiel can feel the weight of his consideration. “Orangeroot,” he observes, watching as Castiel separates leaves and fruit and root from stem. “Those are poisonous, aren’t they.”
She tries to kick him and he dodges, laughing.  “Wow, my hero,” she says sarcastically.
Mariah Careyoke.  The universal equalizer.
“Claire?  Can I get Camel Cwunch?”
“The whole point is to keep him from looking too closely at my children, Anael!”
Castiel closes his eyes, takes a deep breath in and tries to center himself.
Dean shrugs. “Needed to clear my head.”
“Shiny,” Jack breathes, running his thumb over the gold insignia. “Birdie!”
And He was Jack again. Three years old - almost four! And because fixing everything Chuck ever did wrong was tiring work, he decided to take a nap on his father’s lap for he had concluded before gifting his Grace unto the world that he deserved one good thing just for himself and that one good thing would be his father, the angel Castiel.
“It’s okay, baby,” he says, settling Jack in his lap.  “It’s okay.”
She stops and boggles at him. “You left that pig with the kids?”
“Uh huh,” Claire says, fiddling with the cup in her hands. “He also says to never poach a bull from the front or a horse from the ear or a fool from any reaction.”
He finds himself abstractedly pacing in the living room, unconsciously cataloguing areas where a little improvement is warranted; where the floor needs sanding, places on the wall needing some patching up, the rusty hinges that should be replaced on some of the windows. Not to say that the place isn’t well cared for - almost every surface either has a succulent or an air plant on it, mismatched, scavenged vases hold a veritable plethora of flowers and the sofa is in good shape, what he can see of it from under a mass of cozy blankets and throw pillows - it just needs a little bit of maintenance.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” she growls, putting herself in between him and the house, pulling the door halfway shut.
Claire nods politely, hefts Jack’s Star Wars backpack over one shoulder, and makes her way to the sandbox at one end of the park.
“It’s an eagle,” Agent Page corrects gently.
The redhead, Alice, does a double-take and recovers admirably.  “Claire, hey!  Didn’t know you were back in town!”
“I’d like that,” Dean says, suddenly shy.
Cas ducks his head. “Say goodbye to Bobby, Jack.”
“Goodbye, Jack,” comes Mia’s voice from the laptop speakers.
“Are you older than Daddy?”
“Uh, thanks for holding on to Jack for me.”
…he’s never resented her that either, even if he’s often been envious of it.
Cas looks at him, considering, squints and tilts his head.  It’s a gesture so familiar, it almost makes Dean’s knees buckle.  “Did you feed him lunch?”
“I found an interesting book detailing the evolution of traditional American dishes,” Cas says, carrying the roast chicken plated on an equally hideous serving dish to the table.  “In the 1950s, they were quite obsessed with jellied dishes.  I had planned to try one of the recipes tonight - shrimp and olives in jello - but this is nice.”
A beat.  He looks away.  Grunts.  “I need a drink.”
Dean looks around him, scans the aisle.  “Jack?” he says, louder this time.
Cas smiles serenely at her.
Cas looks at Bobby and has to bite back a smile. Bobby’s beard is threaded through with daisies - Cas hadn’t really noticed it in his initial haste to see Jack again. Bobby grimaces and rubs a hand over his jaw, dislodging some of the flowers from his beard.
“I’m sowwy,” Jack sobs, still hitting himself.  “I’m bad.  I’m sowwy.”
Dean turns stony. “A few beers never hurt nobody.”
candle - my brother’s gonna go nuts for that.”
Jack’s hair is spiked up in a sudsy mohawk, the tub’s filled with half as much floating ducks as it is with bubbles and Cas is pressed up against him.
“Evening,” says the redhead tending bar.  “What can I get ya?”
He’s fought for free will, for the chance of being able to make
Jack smiles up at him. “Okay!”
Dean sneezes five times, loudly, and in quick succession.
“Dean? Where are you? What’s going on? Is Jack there? What about Cas?”
“I promise I won’t be mad if you don’t wanna,” Dean eventually says.
Dean grunts and turns to Cas. “You ready to get outta here?”
“It’s nothing.”
“That hunt last week.  You had a teddy bear wedged under your passenger seat and Sam found a baby car seat in your trunk when he went to grab the rock salt you keep there,” he says, with a wry twist to his mouth.  “You ain’t slick, kid.  We thought you’d gotten yourself in the family way.”
“‘Kay.”
Jack inhales sharply, presses his face against Cas’s hip.
“Just so you know,” she says, deliberate.  “This is for my own sanity than it is me enabling your alcoholism.”  She downs the glass, barely winces afterwards.
There’s a lengthy silence, both of them trying to wait the other out.  Dean’s decided to let her win this time, seeing as she’s got all the answers.
“You can’t
Jack startles visibly then, in the blink of an eye, he ages fifteen years.  He sobs, burying his face in Cas’s neck.
“It’ll be perfect, daddy!” She puts her hands on his shoulders and continues, very seriously, “Dean likes things that I like so we can watch movies and go mini-golfing and other stuff I like when you and Jack do your things! Even Steven!”
“Hey, I could be here looking for…” he looks around and grabs a mason jar candle off a shelf. There’s a beat as he boggles at the price. “A fucking
“Ain’t no thing,” Jo says, and walks with them to the far end of the garage, where most of the specialty work is done. “Yo, Dean!” she yells over the sound of Blue Oyster Cult blaring from the old boombox in the corner.
He presses Cas up against the counter, deepens the kiss, coaxes Cas’s mouth open. Cas buries his hand in Dean’s hair, tugs, and Cas is in charge now, kissing Dean back with a ferocity that takes his breath away. With a little coaxing, he gets Cas on the counter, legs coming to wrap around his waist and they’re necking like teenagers. It’s the happiest Dean thinks he’s ever been.
Anael rolls her eyes. He thinks she’s going to argue but she dumps the wild celery onto a chopping board and proceeds to hack away at it.
“I’m going to call her Sophie!”
Dean looks at the gentle curl of Cas’ hair, his exposed nape, his graceful fingers as they clean Dean up. Cas is barefoot. It makes him jolt with surprise. His feet are elegant, long toes and delicate arches. He realizes he’s never seen them before, never seen Cas this vulnerable, not even the first time he lost his grace.
“Jack!” Claire scolds.
He notices movement out of the corner of his eye and he looks up to see Cas leant up against the doorway, beaming down at them.
Jack pulls on his pink rain boots while Castiel throws on a heavy canvas work coat. He makes sure Jack’s sunflower hat is snug on his head and then they’re off to check on the bees.
“The big and black and shiny one!” Jack adds.
Cas huffs.  “I am not - ”
“Brew it correctly?”
“Claire would’ve given him the what-for if he was bothering her.”
“Two, please!”
“Daddy?”
“I told you,” Agent Page says, planted firmly half-in and half-out of the shop, “call me Dean.”
Somewhere in the back of the bar, someone starts doing karaoke.
“Agent Page.”
Dean has Cas’s face cradled in his hands, gazing so intently as if to look away would be to lose him completely.  Which, to be fair, has been the case in previous occasions.  Cas, for his part, is clutching at Dean’s wrist, thumb stroking soothing motions while a spatula drips water onto the floor, forgotten, in his other hand.  His eyes are closed and his smile is beatific.
“I know.” She rolls her eyes.
Agent Page squeezes out from between Castiel and the stove, beating a hasty retreat to the other side of the island.
Cas narrows his eyes and wraps himself even tighter around Dean, pulling him down in a punishing kiss. Dean smirks into it. Personally, this is the complete opposite in terms of incentive for him to behave.
Fuck.
He shivers.
Dean startles awake, hand automatically reaching under his pillow for a weapon that isn’t there, eyes wide and immediately assessing his surroundings.  He’s in an unfamiliar place, on a queen size mattress, tucked under a quilt so ugly only a grandmother with glaucoma could love it, in a homely lived-in bedroom, carpet and furniture just this side of well-worn, lush green plants in hanging pots nailed to the ceiling and walls.  Two pairs of eyes peer up at him from one side of the bed.
“Here you are…” Alice trails of, smiling awkwardly.  She glances between Dean and Claire.  “…I’ll be right back with those beers for you and your dad.”
“Any plans this weekend?  I thought we could maybe head out to the botanical gardens, maybe hit the zoo after.  Jack’s been going on nonstop about lions and tigers and bears, oh my.”
listen in on Gabriel and Anna conducting their business late in the night when they were younger. He’d expect nothing less from his own children.
“Hm,” is all Cas says before he hangs up.
He climbs up onto Baby’s roof, sunglasses on, a bottle of Jack next to him and just lies there.
“So,” Claire says.  “What made you decide to stalk me in the first place?”
He’s been too transparent, though. He’s shown Cas that he’s an endless pit of need and want. Can’t really play that off once it’s been brought out. What he can do is make sure that he leaves them as untouched as he’s found them. The last few years, everything they’ve been through… If this is what Cas and Jack want, if this brings them any measure of peace, Dean will do everything he can to preserve it.
But that’s all for later.
“Okay!” Jack says. He gets up and obliges but his eyes stay fervently glued on the squash.
“No, I’m serious. Jack’s more or less depowered, Cas got out of the Empty so he most likely doesn’t have his Grace anymore…his priority’s always been keeping Jack safe. We don’t exactly have the safest lifestyle, Dean,” Sam says. Dean almost hates him for sounding reasonable. “Maybe he was waiting ’til they got more settled before reaching out.”
“Did too!”
“His -
Castiel smiles politely at Tom Jeffreys and pays halfhearted attention to his romantic woes. He tracks the FBI agent’s movement through the store, watching as he inspects a vial of calming draught, uncorks and sniffs it before making a face and putting it back on the display table.
Currently, the big Victorian house on the edge of town is still occupied by Miltons. Quiet, respectable Castiel Milton, the current proprietor of Milton’s Apothecary, and his children, Claire and Jack. Castiel has lived there his whole life, raised by his Uncle Gabriel and Aunt Anna - yet another set of siblings named after the first Miltons that had settled in town, as was their tradition - and if you believed Garth Fitzgerald’s nana, she swears up and down that these were the exact same Gabriel and Anna Milton from 200 years ago, but no one really pays much mind to the ramblings of an old lady with dementia.
From the kitchen, he can hear Cas ask Claire how she wants her eggs and her mumble-response.
After a whole hour of building sandcastles for Jack to hop onto and knock down, Jack suddenly decides that he absolutely cannot stand that sand’s getting in his shoes and he promptly takes them off and throws his socks into the ocean while Dean’s busy trying to keep some gulls from stealing one of Jack’s abandoned shoes.
Dean pushes quietly out into their space.
“Close, but not quite,” Agent Page argues, amused. “You need help with that, buddy?”
“Do I want?”
They wait with bated breath for her to continue.
Fuck.
He sniffs, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. Well, nobody ever accused Dean Winchester of being a chickenshit.
Castiel looks sternly down at Claire. “Please don’t tell me you answered the door by yourself.”
It shocks them both into laughter.
“Thank you for watching him,” Cas graciously says instead.
She mulls that over. “You obviously can’t be left alone with him.”
“Bourbon.  Whatever you have.  Make it a double.”
And that's it!  I hope y'all enjoyed it and thank you so much to everyone who's followed along and commented! I genuinely treasure each and every one!
When he can’t take the quiet anymore, he checks in on Claire, bites back his amusement as she calls him out for hovering and then
He lets out a breath, closes his eyes.  He mutters to himself.  He almost looks like he’s praying.
“Will do,” Claire says, not looking back.
“There’s a bar a few miles down the road thataway,” she says, with a tilt of her head in its general direction.
Dean chooses his words carefully. “What do you think about me staying here with you and Cas?”
“You’re always welcome here.”  There’s a pause and Claire meets Cas’s eyes.  “I hope you think of this as your home too.”
“I still really don’t know if you’re trolling on purpose or not.”
“Ugh.”
He’s plagued by nightmares. He dreams of Jack’s face, the hurt he was too young to hide, every emotion on blatant display as Dean spat curses at him, tried to kill him, sacrifice him, more times than he’d like to admit. He dreams of that house in North Cove, of kneeling before Cas’s body, the ashes of his burnt out wings spread across the sand.
Castiel lets go of the door and curses its spring hinges from denying him the satisfaction of having the door slam shut behind the most infuriating creature he’s ever met.
Ah, so that’s what this is all about. Finally, they’ve arrived at her endgame.
Anael regards him coolly from where she’s sitting cross-legged on a yoga mat. “Which one?”
Claire rolls her eyes. “Don’t be silly, daddy! Are you gonna marry Dean?”
Eventually, Sam breaks the silence. “So, are you staying?”
Castiel bites his lip in amusement. If flirting back is all it takes to catch the man off guard, then they’ll run these agents out of town by lunch.
“Dean, why are multiple sources saying that a large, surly drifter driving a large, loud car has absconded with my son?”
He ends up in Gold Beach. He snorts to himself. These aren’t the kinds of beaches he was wishing for in the rare moments he’s thought about retirement. He idly thinks about driving down to Mexico while he gases up. He’s got time now. He’s got nothing but time.
“Do you like pancakes?” Claire asks with a squint. “You can stay for breakfast.”
“I can take him,” Dean scowls.  He turns to Jack, who’s humming that lollipop song to himself and dragging a kiwi slice through some ketchup on his plate.  “Hey, buddy, you want to ride in the Impala with me?”
“Sorry,” Dean mutters, glaring at the cat. “The fucking cat.”
“Daddy misses you too,” Jack says, softly.
Dean laughs. He pulls Jack into a hug and Jack’s arms come up and squeeze him tight around his neck. “You’re a good teacher.”
He sleeps in the Impala that night.
Agent Page groans. “You’re killing me here, Cas. First of all, that batter’s too runny. And B, you gotta use a mould or a squeeze bottle to get them to come out good.”
He unbuckles Jack from his carseat and goes to set him down on the sidewalk but Jack absolutely refuses to lock his knees and, after a minute of trying to put him down, Dean gives up and hitches him up under one arm.  Jack lays his head on Dean’s shoulder while Dean locks up the Impala one-handed.
Cas chuckles and heads back into the kitchen.
Another casualty in the long list of Dean’s failings.
Dean pushes away from the sink, pushes Cas away, and stalks out the door.
He drives back to the little house once he hits that fuzzy sweet spot of clarity that three beers and some whiskey bring - he’s done this long enough to know his limits. A little bit more and it becomes a downer.
“Claire,” Castiel says, pinching the bridge of his nose. “How many times do we have to tell you that you shouldn’t answer the door without an adult - ”
“Did he now?”
Jack’s been quietly nodding along to whatever Claire’s saying to him but when the cashier scans his toy into the point of sale, he cuts in.  “Claire, I have a new stuffie!”
“Yeah.”
“Dean…”
There’s blessed silence for a few minutes as they dig in, just the occasional scrape of cutlery against plates and the pointed silence from Claire at one end of the table as she drinks directly from the coffee pot.
“Just like Bullitt!”
He looks down and Jack’s got a plastic tea set on the table and a bunch of stuffed animals sitting on the chairs.
“Relax, Samantha,” Dean says, long-suffering, but proceeds to tell Sam a truncated version of the last couple of days.
“A lot older than eight. And wayyyyy older than four.”
“Not a baby!” Jack crows, rolling away from Cas and continuing to roll into a patch of tulips.
Jack looks up and breaks out into a wide smile. “Cas!” He holds out his arms and makes grabby hands.
Cas sighs, exasperated. “Dean.”
“Stop being blithe!”
He stops.  Turns to look at her.  She feels the hairs rise on the back of her neck.  She forgets he’s dangerous most times.  He’s always been good to her, sweet to kids, does his best.  A goofy uncle of sorts.  Makes her forget he’s a Winchester.  All the stories hunters and monsters and ineffable creatures alike whisper in warning in the dark are about Winchesters.
“Yes,” Cas says absently. He’s at the sink, filling up the pitcher with water. “She calls every Friday and she and Jack have a good session together.”
“Claire!” Anael hisses, as Claire snatches away the syrup.
“I still love them very much,” Jack says, coming to his defense. “I love your droopy star pancakes a lot, Daddy!”
“And do you?”
“Excuse me?”
“My point exactly,” Cas deadpans.
“You gonna refuse to cooperate in an active federal investigation?”
“Uh huh,” Dean says absently.  The hallway’s filled with more of the same.  Photos of a smiling Jack make up the majority, though Claire and Cas do make occasional appearances.  There’s one of Jack and the fucking cat in matching bear costumes that makes Dean laugh.
He unbuckles Jack’s seatbelt and gently picks him up from his carseat.  Jack curls into a small ball, face pressed into his knees.  Dean’s never been good at this but it’s Jack.  No matter what happened there at the end, this is Jack.  He can try for Jack.
She dumps the cat in the entryway, shutting the door behind her, cutting off the sound of Jack’s whimpers and Cas’s soft assurances.
“I’m coming!  Hold your horses!” she grouches, pulling the door open, ready to rip into David Choi for being goddamn rude, only to find Dean fucking Winchester on the porch.
“I wouldn’t call it de-aged so much as the outside matching the inside,” Dean replies.
“Hey, hey,” Dean says, turning back and reaching a hand out to him.  “You’re okay.”
Dean hums, thoughtful.  “So, are you?”
“Sure,” Dean says and puts them both out of their misery and hangs up on him.
“A star!” Jack breathes out and runs to his sister. They whisper excitedly between themselves but the adults in the room ignore them.
Castiel frowns, irritated. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a business to tend to.”
“It isn’t a social visit,” Castiel responds, stony.
Dean being amazing with Jack is just the final nail fixing him to the cross of unrequited pining.
“Look,” she finally says, after Alice’d come round and brought them their second round.  “I don’t know what you think coming here with guns blazing will accomplish but don’t mess this up for them, alright?  They’ve got a good life here.”
Claire glares at him.  “Like you’re one to talk.”
He’s seized by another sneezing fit right then and he’s never been more grateful to have allergies in his life.  “Thanks for getting him back to me,” Dean says, thickly.  “We gotta go, I need to take these antihistamines ASAP.”
“He’s missing his shoes.  And his socks.”
Castiel sits up and graces her with an arch look. “You know it’s not very effective against the strong-willed. Unless you want to bring Gabriel into this, I very much doubt it’ll be powerful enough to keep those federal agents away for long.”
“Yeah, okay, bud.”
“So, um, about last night…” He trails off, anxiety coming back tenfold under Cas’s patient gaze. He coughs, nervous. “I wanted to say I’m sorry.”
Try as he might, for all their sakes, he can’t resist.
She pinches the bridge of her nose, cigarette ash falling all over the windowsill. “Shit, you’re right.” She takes a deep puff and blows a cloud of smoke in his direction. “Fuck,” she mutters under her breath.
Uh huh.
“Dean likes frogs,” Jack cuts in, bouncing a little in his chair.
“Whoa, Sammy, slow your roll there.”
“Whipped,” Dean mutters into the phone.
Dean’s in the bathroom, running his arm under hot water and rifling through the medicine cabinet for some antiseptic and bandaids when Cas walks in on him.
“Here,” Castiel says, thrusting a jar of salve at Tom. “Apply this to the affected area a half hour before bed. You should see results within the week.”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean puts the plastic cup down on the table, movements stiff. “Hey, Jack?”
“How old are you?” Claire asks, rudely.
Claire jumps to action but Cas is faster.  He’s picked Jack up, incognizant of his own bare feet.  “You’re okay, Jack,” he breathes repeatedly into Jack’s hair.
“The handsome one,” he says, fidgeting with the headphones.
Cas swallows, looks away.
“Where would I have pulled an extra pair of baby socks from?”
“You got losted,” Jack shrugs.  “Mrs Andy’s mom helped me find you.”
“Gotten attached, Dean?” Bobby chuckled on his way out the door.
“Even with the madness,” Cas added. “Remember, they suffered from paranoia and hallucinations.”
You can probably tell I'm not a fan of fur. It gives me the shivers. I'm not a vegetarian, but even sheepskins give me the ick. Anyway, the coat I was thinking of looks
Sam gives him a disgruntled look, but says he did it the next time he visits.
At the door, some of the patrons waiting to get into HELL parted the line and someone choked out, “Oh my god, what the fuck
Abram! Benedikt! You brothers are nothing but trouble! Why are you taking this outsider to the clinic? We don’t need help from people like him!
, but he
“Well, that’s true.” Dean wanted to whine about the showers and baths. It was cold and he liked getting warm with a long, super-hot shower with great water pressure. The hot water Cas heated in the water heater lasted maybe twenty minutes, tops. He knew he was being whiny, but…
“Good evening, Mr. Novak! How was your flight?” Stuart had been a chauffeur for the Novaks since Castiel was a child. His gray eyes were kind as he looked back to the passenger’s seating.
Sighing at his own imagination, he sips at his drink, determined not to get sauced tonight. God knew what would land on his desk tomorrow. He doesn't want to be hung over while investigating again.
There was a brief shuffle as Dale actively tried not to be a dead weight, but his eyes were drooping and he looked moments from passing out. For a huge guy, he was a lightweight drinker, and Mark knew that Dale was going to just fall over and sleep wherever he landed. He was a ticking time bomb of dead weight.
weapon, but I’m not good with spells. That’s Sam’s thing.”
Castiel felt the heat surge over his feathered face, something he knew Dean and Bobby couldn’t spot, but Gabriel was something else.
. “You must have had your First Communion and be chosen to serve.” He looked up at the older boy, who was scowling quite fiercely at him. “You also have to be under the age of eighteen.”
: Technically, there are very few "daitengu" (great tengu), and King Sōjōbō is one of them. He rules a specific territory and the smaller/younger tengu around him bend to his will. He's familiar if you watch anime or read manga. He's one of the most powerful tengu, so he's mostly in human form.
, his Omega helpfully provided,
Another huff. “Boy, you better not think this is pretty princess emotional moment. Just watch yer ass, and the ass of that boy of yers.”
Gabe leaped up like he had won something, pumping his fists in the air, strutting in the two-foot strip of room they had for their feet, and bowing his head to everyone. “Yes, thank you! Thank you!”
—when Crowley stopped him.
“It’s fine,” he grinned, pointing at himself. “I’m hardly model material, and that’s who the killer is taking!”
Unwilling to get in the middle of the fight, Dean turned to Cas for the paperwork he'd hopefully pilfered.
Sam looked smugly back at Dean, who rolled his eyes, and shrugged like he didn’t care. Because he didn’t. All this religious hoodoo voodoo BS was for the birds. Sam stuck out his hand and smiled at the guy. “My name is Sam Winchester. I’d like to be an altar boy.”
The receptionist (the little black nameplate with gold lettering on his desk said ‘Inias Chapel’) nodded and asked, “Your name?”
He hung his head and admitted with a small sigh, “He is very tiring, but, again, powerful. He may be the ally we need.”
“You can’t hide here forever, you know?” Michael finished off his coffee, and Jo reappeared to refresh both their cups.
Another shared look, and Benny said, “I think it was Daniil or maybe Yevgeniy.”
A lot of battling.
“And yet I put my pants on exactly as you do, Stuart,” he said firmly. “Also, please remember I’m not your Pack-alpha. That’s Michael.”
The door banged open, and the guy with dirty-blond hair and ridiculous goatee walked into the room, his baby-blue flannel pajamas stuffed ingloriously into his wellingtons, a brown fur cap pulled roughly over his head. “You,” he said, catching sight of Dean, his Russian accent more obvious than before in his sleepy agitation. “It is
like a pie, except they were small and smelled deliciously like meat. “Uh, Cas,” he murmured, ignoring the amused looks he was getting. It was hard to speak with a watering mouth. “What are those?”
Dean leaned back in his chair, pushing it onto its back legs, and asked, “Bobby, you got any holy weapons?”
He quickly dialed on the elderly black office phone and settled himself better into the desk chair, drumming his free fingers on the wooden desk nervously as the phone rang.
He had stuffed his feet into the slippers that Bobby had offered, getting a hard eyeball and the information from Bobby that the proper shoes were outside the door and he was NOT to touch the inside floors with them. Dean had hastily agreed since the threat of pain of death was hovering over his head, if the slitted-eye glare he was given by the older man was any indication.
floor, pulling back with a curse when it sparked and shocked him. Dean ignored Gabe’s resentful eyes, and focused on the battle to come.
Benny added, “Then Daniil died. He was already weak, but then he started refusing to drink anything, and he just died in his bed, his body already stiff. Then we knew there was trouble in the village.”
They drove away and Abram sighed. “Benny, for once, could you act as if you are three years older than me?”
The doctor’s office was obviously set off to the right. Bookshelves dominated the walls, except for the huge bay window behind the desk that would have looked out into the garden, but they were shuttered closed. The desk was small and covered with books. He eyed the pile wearily. “Ugh, research…” he muttered.
On the counter was a huge basket with candy in it.
Cas tried to mimic Dean’s motions, as just seeing the relief on Dean’s face was fascinatingly human, but it did nothing for him at all. At his core, the Flame of his life throbbed fitfully, and he stowed his new thoughts of impending mortality to follow along behind Dean.
“I don’t want to, but I will if Sammy wants to do it.”
how many hopeful folks were chewed up and spat out like old chewing tobacco.
scent was hidden from Sam was ridiculous. Sam had never smelled Dean
“So what’s your solution, Cas?”
Michael had called a few times, and Dean had spoken to him monosyllabically, spitting out responses to get the man to leave him alone, but just enough that the Alpha didn’t think about dropping by unannounced again. And Michael did leave him alone, since he knew Dean didn’t feel good, which seemed like a miracle.
He shifted his gaze to Dean, making a hand movement to indicate he needed a moment, leaving Dean alone with the skeevy tailor.
Benny looked over at Abram and said, “Well, there’s no doctor, and there is nothing valuable in there. I would imagine so.”
say. Damn magical birds and their magical bird secrets!
Abram eyed him with doubtful gray eyes. Dean finally asked, “How many people have died now?”
Cas was feeling rather frisky, it seemed, and without so much as a “Good morning, Dean” straddled his lover carefully, trying to avoid knocking his head on the low ceiling.
He needed to go. Get out. Get
different,” he said slowly. "However, I'm not sure what it is."
“Dean is very handy,” Sam said, watching his brother strip the outer casing and blow into the guts, making black particles fly. “Our Uncle Bobby showed him a lot, but he’s always been smart like that.”
“WOULD YOU PLEASE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ELSEWHERE?” Frustrated, Castiel reached up and snagged his pillow, slamming it over his head and hoping he would suffocate than deal with the twins a moment longer.
case was…” He whistled in awe. “Wow… 1937.”  The doctor made a humming noise and added, “Well, it seems most omegas just kill themselves than deal with the social stigma.”
Not a happy beginning, he thought as he fought to keep his eyes open after taking his morning dose. He had hoped it was a one-time thing, passing out like that.
As usual, Dean decided to stay out of temptation’s way and leave Sam at the doorway. Dean tried not to pout but stepped back as Sam hopped gleefully up the final steps and was let into the warm, glowing house. He turned on his heel and meandered to the garage where the Lark was waiting for him.
a nice suit, with a gun metal silver jacket that had black satin lapels, the faintly metallic shirt with the black satin tie, the black vest with silver embroidered puffs of wind and snowflakes, and black suit pants and shoes. It was just barely on this side of masculine; the jewel-colors he was expected to wear being replaced by the glossy silver sheen. Perhaps it didn’t matter that it wasn’t jewel colored: it was so form fitting it showed off his every nook and cranny. He was technically clothed, but still felt like he was on naked display.
Frowning deeply, the woman sharply said in her clipped British accent, “I warned you to stay away from him! He’s
It was… enticing. Being that close and intimate with Dean had been something he had never known before, except, perhaps, when he first felt the Call to God.
Perhaps there were good points to Michael?
He swallowed his huff and took a moment to really look up into the wet, pulsating gray and finally notice what had been eating at him: there was no sun. The cold here was thick with dull magic, with ancient magicks and spells that wanted to lull him to sleep. It sucked at his spirit’s core and he swore lowly when he thought about how he was going to die from a lack of sunlight here.
Changed, he came back out wearing a proper t-shirt with KISS on the front and a maroon flannel shirt over his worn jeans. He was in his socked feet, but he didn’t want to bother with boots, not when he didn’t know when Akira was just going to drop in.
Grimm, I sure as hell wouldn’t have been caught this easily. My dad sure as hell wouldn’t have been caught this easily.”
Abram nodded. “He is gay, but it is not permitted in the Orthodox Church. He moved to Anchorage, so he is not too far away.”
in our bed.
Cas walked away from Dean’s back and towards the river. Dean watched him out of the corner of his eye looking at the edge and picking up things. He noticed the young woman’s slight relief and the bevy of curious youngsters watching Cas.
Don't shoot me, please.
But it didn’t matter, because Dean twisted and gave the frothing one a punishing left hook, followed by a kick to the gut in quick succession. The frother curled into his heaving belly, at which point the scrawny one got with the program and made a run at Dean.
But now… she required safety, a place to regroup and hide. The luck she had stolen from that bright soul simmered inside her, the curse placed on him slowly pulling on his life and his luck. Even if he didn’t die in 108 days, he would most likely die of bad luck within the next fifty-four.
Her clawed hands grew longer and she threw herself at Dean in a fierce attack that, again, he could barely counter. She managed to get a strike through at one point, and he ignored Sam’s cry as those claws ripped through his hand and chest, knocking the sword from his grip.
Castiel hopped a little nearer to eye it. "I believe if you try saying 'ideyō' he might appear..."
One of them speaks Russian.
“What? Stop mumbling, for fuck’s sake!”
My friend doesn’t speak Russian. I prefer to speak in English.
It was right then that Sam’s stomach let out a tremendous growl that caused him to flush in embarrassment and Dean to look concerned. Castiel smiled at them, not sure he wanted them to leave yet, the charming Winchester boys, and said, “I have the ingredients to make sandwiches, if that’s amenable.”
Gabriel shrugged. “He’ll live. Go take that off and I’ll get you a new shirt.” He reached up and ruffled Castiel’s hair affectionately. “You can do this.”
When Dean came to, it was to the scent of moist, dark earth and the confined stink of his own heavy pre-heat funk, while wrapped inside a white, canvas-like blanket thing that was almost too warm. His jacket was gone, though,
Shaking his head, Castiel came to himself to find, one, Gabriel had backed
Very suspiciously.
He pushed the bird off his shoulder and snapped, “Okay, look! I don’t know shit about Buddhism, Japan, or whatever else other than what I’ve seen in movies or fucking anime! That does not mean you get to talk down to me! I may not know that Ah-bay dickbag, but I sure as hell know how to operate in this modern world.”
A shower later — where the hot water suddenly ran out in the middle of his ablutions — a disgruntled Dean wandered downstairs. He glared at the raven sitting in the middle of the table, eyes closed, feathers ruffled.
touches you like that, report it immediately. No matter what they say to make it acceptable, it’s not.”
Sam said, tentatively, “I’ll, uh, go make some coffee.” He gave Dean a concerned look that Dean hated, like he was made out of crystal or some shit, and he waved his little brother out.
Dean nods, oddly unwilling to let Cas go. They hide in the alley next to the diner to say goodbye, Dean promising to be there tonight, and sharing a short, chaste kiss that they both want to evolve into something more.
I'm not at all cool, but I like to talk about ABO stuff! (I really only post about this stuff and update. Ch 7 is driving me somewhat mad.)
“Stuart, please just call me Castiel. You’ve known me since I was a child.”
With that in mind, he said, pityingly, “You need professional help.”
Dean stifled a groan and ripped open the envelope.
. She tried futilely to swat at the smoky bat-shadows, shrieking, “What’s going on? Who are you?”
Either dead or paralyzed, it fell silent, and the pixies flew around it victoriously.
She grinned at him, all serrated teeth and blank, black eyes. “You see yourself a hero? There are no heroes here amongst the filthy meat beasts. Might as well proclaim justice among the pigs you eat, stupid human!” She laughed. “Might as well think of a cow defending its brethren from the butchers!”
He had endured a haircut, a facial, a shave, an all-over body exfoliation, a shower (he managed that on his own, thank-you-
Dean sat up, rubbing his eyes, and the raven scooted back, nearer to Bobby. Ah so the tengu has realized...
From outside himself, he thought he heard the omega spit out, “Pureblood!” like it was a curse, and getting out the word hurt him.
Are you Ukrainian?"
Dean’s breath caught as Cas nuzzled into the junction between his shoulder and throat, the tip of his nose cold against his skin.
Cas's thumbs wiped under Dean's eyes as his hands cupped his jaw. "And that's why I'm sorry..."
“I believe that’s it.”
Behind them, Michael looked amused, but it turned into a frown as his phone rang.
(河童 "river child"): [CREATURE] This is a water-demon. They have these little plates on their heads that, if they dry out, the kappa will be helpless. If it's broken, they'll die. Their favorite food is cucumbers. They are a symbol of clean water, and one of the sake breweries in Japan has kappa as its logo.
Sam didn’t look mad but more confused by the pain. Castiel started to apologize when Joshua stepped into the small room and pulled Sam back. “Let’s get you some cocoa, huh? Let Missouri and Castiel speak for a moment.”
He stepped out of them, turning to face an already-naked Cas. “Oh so that’s how you were keeping the bed warm?”
Sam waited around the table to see if Dean was going to come out at all, but apparently not.  So, Sam checked on Dean at like 9 am and saw he was still passed the fuck out, and then quietly snuck out of the Bunker to visit Joshua.
There was some artful, pretend gagging, and Dean one-finger saluted him again.
Michael smiled indulgently, pleased with the efforts. “I do apologize, Vincenzo. My requests were rather unorthodox.”
“Dean Winchester,” he stutters out, preventing himself from stroking the hand, and releases it nervously.
Before the altar stood the Baku, chanting loudly and rhythmically, while bright blue balls of light danced around her like butterflies. Every other beat of her chant, one of the balls of light was sucked into her abdomen, and it sent off a small shock wave that felt icky on Dean’s skin.
Dean huffed and pushed away from his overbearing boss, straightening his faux tie with one hand and picking up his drink tray with the other. “You have like twenty omegas out there, and you’re going to make
Dean vehemently shook his head.
Castiel liked Sam off the bat. He could tell already that here was a young man with drive and, if the look in his eyes are anything to go by, intelligence. “Nice to meet you, Sam. My name is Deacon Castiel Novak.”
It was a small jewel that just needed a shine, from its bald tires to its slight rust issues, what with her cracked upholstery and dead battery. The white paint was faded in places, sure, and the chrome needed polishing, but her frame was good and undercarriage solid.
The smell of caramel apples haunted him, and the scent of satisfaction he had gotten from Dean coiled around his memory, begging to be petted and touched.
Because, for an Alpha, Castiel had a steel grip on his desires. Most alphas couldn’t control themselves around omegas, especially when they were in heat, stating omegas enjoyed it and that was the natural way of things. Omegas were meant to be knotted, so the saying went, and the alphas’ behaviors reflected that.
: So I just found out that Deacons cannot say mass, but it's my AU so I'm sticking with transitional ones can. Layman ones cannot. That's what I thought when I was originally writing this. Oops. Well, there will be more Catholic "rule" breaking as we go on, although I will try my hardest to be (HA HA) faithful. Castiel will not be taking confession because Deacons cannot, which means a few things... but yeah. RULE BREAKING: Transitional deacons can say mass! Look at me rebel!
Dean is just grateful that's one case off his desk when there's a call from his captain about some stinky apartment and they’ve got to go with the bulls to make sure it ain't more murdered folk.
Both bird and man looked down at the tiny bead. It was shifting on its tiny legs, looking impatient. “I would like to conserve as much energy as I can for the coming battles,” it said, all reverent to the giant bird.
He stretches out his hand to Dean and says, “Castiel Milton.”
The omega must have seen the red bleeding into his eyes, because he growled back, baring his teeth and not backing down. But, like a fog, the scent of arousal had curled into the scent of anger and rebellion, like hot chocolate with a hint of cinnamon. The omega’s hands were clenched at his sides, shaking, as if he were forcing himself to stand his ground.
Sam even pulled out a small tome he had written up to give Bobby a chance to review the situation as it occurred, with interviews and witness accounts properly documented by Dean and Sam.
The first dose of Thrall knocked him out like solid punch to the jaw.
“Yeah, ya stupid bird! Bobby!”
He sensed Cas’s shrug more than see it. “
Sam scoffs, while smiling a bit (albeit watery). “You jerk. Scaring me like that. I missed tests to get here!”
Abram said, “What’s this about rabies?”
“According to the doc’s notes, the disease is viral. That means there are a lot of ways to get sick.” He shook his head. “You guys are keeping the sick in closed rooms. If it’s like the flu, it probably concentrates it in one spot. You should open the windows and air them out.”
He finally just stormed out and waited by the car. It was better than Michael thinking Dean enjoyed his being handsy.
The two bulky bodyguards moved forward to go out first as the door was opened, and the bright popping of lights redoubled in an instant.
He got down on his knees between Cas’s legs took him into his mouth. He rolled his tongue around the head, tasting the angelic precum as he heard Cas moan in response. He licked his cock from base to tip, his tongue making a wide swath over the shaft. He suckled the skin between his balls and his shaft, enjoying the gasp he wrung from his mate.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m the special leaf on the tree,” the fox said, throwing itself at Castiel and poofing into his second form: a white fox the size of a Boxer, wearing a small, pure-white shrine outfit with wooden sandals. He hugged Castiel hard and Castiel felt all the air squeezed out from his lungs in a strong whoosh.
Gabriel gets back on stage and says something about his kid bro, Castiel, being there all week.
He also realized there were some giggles and stares, and that he hadn’t noticed that, when he stretched, his t-shirt had risen, revealing his abs and hipbones. He blushed, but managed to smirk and a wink at them, internally groaning at the bright burst of feminine giggles it got him.
Dean knew better than to ignore Bobby when he was looking at him all stern and stuff under those eyebrows, and slinked off to his room. He didn’t even bother to turn on the light as he shifted the bird off his shoulder.
Dean shuddered as Cas mouthed across his jaw and then moved so he could stare into Dean’s eyes. His own eyes were sorrowful and tempted, he swallowed hard and pushed his forehead to touch Dean’s.
Dean stiffened and immediately posed to go on the defensive.
Arguments had broken out about whether or not a full-scale assault should be immediately attempted, since it seemed things were too quiet, and seemed to be quickly coming to a head. Others vehemently insisted that locating the missing hunters was the most important thing, and fuck the frontal assault when their numbers had already been pared down by a quarter.
“Say what?” Dean made a ‘what the fuck’ expression at Gabe, but then saw Cas out of the corner of his eyes and hissed, “Oh my god! CAS!!”
Flustered, Castiel flailed off his seat and awkwardly snagged the box away.
They apparently all had caught wind of him, because they stood panting and sniffing at the driveway entrance, apparently still together enough not to just break into the garage. Not that Dean wanted them too because there wasn’t a lot of room and he’d be easily pinned in the garage.
Bending to look at the body, he recognized the tiny torso as a toddler’s, the clothes ripped off, the bowels torn into. He didn’t know whether to be thankful that her head was missing, or be sick over the small pink pony still tightly clutched in her baby hand.
Dean blinks and looks up at Cas, nodding groggily and rubbing a hand over his face. “Yeah, sorry.” He realizes who it is and jerks, yelping, “Did I miss your show??”
He hadn’t slept, his body ridden so hard by his heat that he had almost staggered out to get Sam to call 911. He knew it was midday because of the way the light slanted into the trailer, but he didn’t know precisely what day it was in his delirium, and he just couldn’t relax. Although exhausted, Dean was still grateful to find a tray outside his door with bottled water, an apple, and a note from Sam saying he was going to church on it.
She looked moderately surprised when suddenly, in a strong voice, Sam snapped out the hand motions, smoothly running through the mudras, and shouted, “
He looked back up to find Jeffery staring at him from the open window, only to squeak when he realized Castiel had caught him. It was a familiar squeak and generally part of the designation awe. It was simply fatiguing to think that—because he was the pureblood Alpha—they all expected him to throw away everything he wanted to serve the Clan.
Marv gave him a condescending look from under his lashes, but said, “Of course, young omega. I will be more careful.”
you?” Dean felt a tinge of panic and started to run his hands over his angel. Admittedly, that was the first time that the grace has lit them up like Chinese lanterns, but surely it wasn't anything bad?
. Following that was the aching hollow that ballooned up and out from his core, the usual heat stored there simmering lowly as if conserving itself.
The bird gave him a look and just flapped-hopped up and onto his shoulder. “We should leave before the family awakens.”
Although they had had… whatever that was? A fight? Cas had still been sitting quietly on Dean’s bed when he went to sleep. Apologies were not given. Excuses were not made. Dean had simply gone to bed with Cas sitting like a stuffed bear in the corner of his bed by his feet.
Gabe hummed and added. “I hadn’t realized he was a second-level. He’ll be able to give Mikey lots of pups. After all, that’s the point right? Cement the succession before Cassy here decides to change his mind and be the new pit boss?”
PS: I suck at sex scenes. GOMEN!!
Omega.
The neck had been snapped with one hand, the livid marks on the corpse’s neck nearly black. The victim’s left breast had been partly ripped off, the meat under it chewed through, while the rib cage had been snapped to reveal a hole where a heart should have been. She was missing a leg, which looked like it had been ripped from the socket. There were clean streaks through the blood splatter, as if it had been licked, and even a seasoned hunter like Dean felt ill looking at it.
Trapped in the storm and with nowhere to escape to, Dean and Cas finally talk.
“You seem awfully accepting, seeing as it is against your religion,” Dean said slowly.
He closed his eyes, weary of all his thoughts, of nephilim and The Garden. Those were issues of the past.
” he pushed back into the bond, pulling Cas’s hand over his shoulder where their mark burned between them, snapping it firmly into place as Cas finally pushed in and completed the circuit.
, Castiel thought,
He had come home after his short stint in the Perch feeling proud of his giant tip and trying not to think about his being groped like he was tomato being squeeze-checked for ripeness. Dean had just tucked the roll of bills into his mattress and patted it happily. He was five thousand closer to getting Sam to college!
After hefting his precious duffle and Cas’s army-green barrack’s bag, Dean cautiously stepped up the steps and onto the small deck, feeling it groan as he put weight on it, but it held and he counted it a win. He unlocked the door with his lock pick, the elaborately carved and heavy door creaking just a bit as it swung open. The interior was, if possible, colder than outside. He shivered again, and looked around. There was furniture, it looked like, all of it covered in dust cloths. There was a giant stone fireplace in the wall, facing the small living room, a small collection of logs next to it. There were, to his disconcertion, a mounted deer head and what looked like a stuffed moose head. A large split log breakfast bar separated the room from the small kitchen. He dropped the bags and wandered over to the kitchen to take a look, and it seemed, to his relief, the stove was gas powered. The small refrigerator was off, and the cabinets were also of rough-hewn logs. It was a two-butt kitchen. Two
Bells jingle to announce their entrance and Cas looks enthralled already. The diner is all red and white colors with shiny chrome accents, doubling as a soda shop after three, when the kids get out of class. They slide into a booth and continue chatting about things. Cas likes reading and music. He's been reading some fancy foreign authors and John Steinbeck. Dean admits to checking out some guy named Mickey Spillane because his little brother thought he might like it. Mostly, he reads Asimov and Jules Verne, although recently his partner had given him a book of short stories by a guy named Ray Bradbury that seemed interesting. He doesn't admit to his Astounding Science Fiction magazine addiction because he's not a dope.
Dean looked over at Akira, and she was sweating heavily but looked okay.

While he lights his Lucky Strike, his leg bouncing impatiently, Cas (as he's now somehow permanently etched in his brain) strolls on the stage, tonight in dark gray with pinstripes over sky blue and a navy blue tie.
in the street. He sure as hell had never expected to find one at a church in the suburbs. Even the two he
“Yeah, yeah, for the forest. Gotcha.” Dean smirked, stretching as he stood.
. She said you were working HEAVEN last night as ‘Rocky.’”
“My little brother.” Dean couldn’t stop the pride in his voice as he said, “He’s gotten away from this life. He’s at school; got himself a full ride at Stanford!”
He then wants to slam his head on the table because Mr. Big Bad Homicide Detective, a guy who can make men sing like canaries, is tongue tied by a pair of blue eyes and a bright smile.
Cas gaped at him, shocked. He sputtered and shook his head in denial.  “I couldn’t help it! I had to think!”
Startled but trying not to show it, Dean paused in his perusal of the menu (and in trying to think back to his one month of French like two years ago… he vaguely remembered something about
“Yeah, I see it.”
“Dean,” Cas groaned, his voice rough and wondering.
Cas grinned and disappeared. Dean blew out a relieved huff.
Baku tilted her head quizzically, not sure what to make of the hostile tone, and replied mildly, “Eve. I am called Eve.”
“Yes, Bobby.” This time, more subdued. “But do you know anything about Wesen-specific illnesses?”
Omega was safe. It strained at the imposed limits, snapping and frothing to get free.
Joshua smiled softly and shook his head, leaning in conspiratorially. “Sam, I’m going to tell you something. Do you know what ‘true mates’ are?”
Apparently there had been something in Dean’s gaze that scared Sam because he shuddered and backed off fast, his hands raised in surrender. “Capiche, capiche!”
Dean smiles back, exhausted to his bones, and mutters, “Bitch,” before passing out.
) until the Alpha pulled Dean close and slid his nose into Dean’s collar, taking long sniffs there. Dean threw Jake an annoyed look and waved for a bit of help before he gave into the urge to knee the man and crush his junk.
Everyone kicked in and there was everything from General Mao’s chicken (although they didn’t call it that) to onigiri, the seaweed wrapped rice balls being tucked away into pockets and bags for later snacking.
Shaking his head, Dean brings his good hand up to cover Cas’s. “Go on, then…”
“No,” he groans out, even as Sam accidentally kicks his good shin with his moose foot. “Not okay! Help! Get. This. Sasquatch.
Somewhere behind him, he heard Akira chanting something.
… with the host dead, what can they do?”
It was embarrassing.
Sam had attempted scrambled eggs.
price and set up for their temporary home.
Dean and Sam exchanged looks, and Sam said, “She made us. She didn’t do anything, but mock us that it was too late.”
Asshole.
Dean, meanwhile, had grunted when the huge foot had caught on his shoulder, holding in his yelp of pain as he felt the bruise bloom under his skin right where his shoulder met his left arm. It was better, though, then getting the shit kicked out of him with a Caddy-sized foot.
A lot of battling. A lot of feels. Insight into Cas's situation. Gabe offers a lot of advice all around.
Then again, those holes could have been intentional.
“Hell if I know, kid. Hell if I know.” Bobby pointed to the map on the desk that he and Akira had been looking at. “But according to Akira, if the Baku is playing by the rules, she should have a nest around here, where the ley lines create a box at the center of a pentacle shape for calling shit up. That’s why there were specific yōkai kills in those specific areas, to activate the main points.”
“I thought…” Joshua pointedly looked over at the boys.
Even when Joshua had interviewed Castiel’s family about his temperament, they had all stated unanimously that Castiel rarely lost his temper and that they had never seen his Alpha appear other than during his ruts. A couple of his older brothers even said this with some measure of disgust, making Joshua think they had probably played pranks on the poor guy. So something about the Omega was hitting his buttons in a way that had never been seen before.
“Sam is?”
“So, strangers,” Benny said. His voice was husky, and he had a small wheeze. Dean wondered if he had asthma. “How long do you plan to stay here?”
Dean made breakfast, yawning his way through it, and missing his little brother’s concerned looks. “Di-Did I wake you up too early?”
Having wedged the flashlight between his shoulder and jaw, Dean grimaced into the fireplace, pulling out his lighter and lighting the wood. “Says you. Sounds plain disturbing to me.”
was a saying that Dean often used in his head where it was okay and didn’t sound dorky like an old man. But, fucking hell, it was
Cas watched with concern but did nothing. Dean got more saliva going, coughed again and sighed. Rubbing his face, he said, “I'm sorry, Cas. I swear, it's not what it looked like.”
Michael kept him tucked a bit behind him, leaving Dean to observe the guests.
Nikolai reared around, woging in the process, only to look Dean in the eyes and fall back in shock.
The feeling doubled as Cas followed soon after, his orgasm ripping through Dean as the bond transmitted it him to enjoy second-hand. Cas cried out, “Dean!” while the grace curled around them and caused their skin to glow for a moment.
“Hey, Jake. How's it looking?" He dropped the serving tray onto the bar to be filled.
“What the Sam Hill?” He sputtered, hoping vainly that his face was less vivid than Sam’s.
“Emotional growth of a half-dead sponge,” he mumbled, but replied much louder, “I’m not sure. Cassy has been rather… upset lately. You know that.”
Joshua had given Castiel permission to go for a couple of nights, as it was Clan Business and not just pleasure. Not that practicing being a burrito—all wrapped in his duvet in his bed—was exceptionally pleasurable, but it beat walking around not knowing what to do about His Life.
He doesn't even know the guy and the idea burns at him. Because (and maybe it's the booze talkin’ here), he looks like an angel under the spotlight. Who could hurt such an innocent-looking man?
Yana caught Dean’s arm before he could scoot out the door, and he didn't miss the wiping off of emotion from Cas's face. It didn't stop the storm in Cas’s eyes, or the low, stinging sensation of possessiveness that trilled down their bond. “Are you leaving so soon? Without dessert?”
He hung up the phone and for some reason dread crawled into his gut and stayed there.
As he began to lose hope, a tall, dark shadow emerged from the trees, barely visible in the snow flurries as it approached. Dean had resorted to clutching his upper arms and rubbing them with his numb hands as he watched it. Its eyes glowed in the snow’s glare, and it moved on huge padded feet the size of dinner plates until it was almost in front of him.
, he thought, stretching his shoulder minutely. The church looked pretty well off when they walked past it. He wouldn’t be surprised if a few of those alphas visited Purgatory regularly. After all, that’s what people do: sin.
“It's okay, Sammy,” he tries to soothe, trying to reach out but finding his left arm painful and unmoving, while his right has a tube attached to it that makes it hard to move.
Two things happened.
All of them stared at it, and Dean realized that he could hear chanting from the entry and feel a low-level buzz that was making the hair on his arms stand up.
For those who need more visual stimulation, I see the building as something like
“Imagine the energy flowing through them like a waterfall, lighting up each ball of light in turn,” Cas would murmur at his side in his big bird form.
Cas laughs as he ends the song, the band behind him laughing with him, and he casually, breathlessly, introduces them with a huge, gummy smile.
Creeping past the twin’s rooms and into his own set, Castiel did something he had not done since he was sixteen: he gently closed the door to his bedroom and flopped face first into the sage-green duvet.
And he did move because even if he were curled in bed, miserable and
Dean doubted Michael heard “no” very often.
Unable to help himself, he squinted uneasily at the painting, thinking it really was a bit…much…for a doctor’s office, when a pleasant voice asked, “Can I help you?”

Come talk about it on my fan fiction Tumblr!
And this is what Dean wanted, needed, the feeling of completion that blazed through them like a lightning strike. It sizzle through his nerves, and he gasped and panted as is sank entirely through him, Cas’s grace like the greatest estim machine ever made. It tingled beneath his flesh, and, even better, he could feel everything Cas did: how warm he felt inside; how Cas loved the pressure that surrounded him; how every breath Dean took made it difficult to concentrate. Dean whined in his throat, and pushed up, trying to fuck himself, but Cas took the hint and started moving, each movement a symphony of receiving/giving, heat/pressure, wet/hard.
All three faces twisted, alpha rage oozing off them in waves.
“Is Yevgeniy still alive?”
The formal dinner party, primarily family, was going to take forever, and Castiel hoped he would be seated next to his sister, just so he could play catch up while his family fawned on the prospective mate.
“Oh yeah.” Sam hid his face with his hands.
see it. He could see himself coming home to Dean and any pups they might have. He could see himself having a whole pack of pups with green eyes and freckles; little girls with golden ponytails; little boys with tousled dark brown hair.
The group of super pale Japanese dudes in those pristine white outfits like Cas had worn in his dreams, with the wide sleeves and touches of color, were watching them with some amusement. They shouldn’t have been so amused in Dean’s opinion; they were wearing those fugly ass hats that looked like meshy shark fins.
“Yeah, saw the pics from the Christmas Party! People were dying to know the deets and if you were going to make an honest Alpha of my oldest brother.”
Dean laughed at him. “Never,” he crowed, breaking his egg over the pan.
He had taken his eyes off the Baku to check on his teammates. Now, while she was absolutely upset about Sam banishing the souls she had collected, taking his eyes off the bitch was a bad idea since, really, she’d been aiming for Dean’s life force the whole time.
Dean was being optimistic and had forgotten about his bad luck, because there were
“Our Dad’s a bounty hunter,” Sam piped up from across the room. “He’s trying to track someone down right now, so we’re on our own.” He paused to think for a moment, and he added, “Although Missouri does keep an eye on us, Dad decided Dean was old enough to take care of a place for a while.”
Dean grinned. “She’s just a kid. She’ll get over it.”
'Shoot a bear, skin it and place the skin under the pillow of your successful hunter,' advised the shaman.
Sam groaned out a muted and mumbled, “Yes!”
Gabe had stayed away, complaining from where he was in the hallway about the stench. Dean ignored him, and poked around in the hall closet.
“Sickness,” the Alpha finished.
, just like his old man.
“It’s fine. I wasn’t meant to be here. I wasn’t meant to meet him. I… I wasn’t meant to feel this way.”
Dean disregarded them and, his hands clenching and unclenching, he uttered, “Cas is gone.” The incredulous look on Bobby’s face and the worried look on Sam’s did nothing to ease his distress.
Even worse, his work boots had disappeared, and some dude with an earpiece had appeared with sparkling new shoes for Dean to put on with his suit. He loved those boots, damn it!
Dean shook his head and sighed. The fools were going to go for it, and, really, Dean was a bit grateful they were trying it on him and not some poor omega who couldn’t take care of themselves. He looked down at his hand for a second, shifting the oil-heavy spot on the cloth to the center so it would fly better.
Another bitchface, which fell into a sulky expression. “I only burned one. I was afraid to do more than that.”
As they watched the group only 10-feet away, Michael’s hand slid over Dean’s back to settle in the curve of his waist, subtly marking him. Dean didn’t lean into it, but he didn’t dispute it being there either, his scent the sweet caramel apples it had always been.
Dean started laughing. He had forgotten that Benny was the older brother. “I hear you, Benny. I’m the oldest, but my little brother acts like he’s ten years older than me!”
She left the woman’s dreams alone, but stole her clothing instead.
Why can you not understand there are some things humans do not want to wake up to, one of them being
The brothers nodded. “Sad times. Too many dead, not enough spirit.”
The beautiful young woman with the luminescent skin and the gorgeous long dark hair reared back as if she had been hit, hissing like a serpent, revealing a mouthful of ragged shark-like teeth. A few of the barbed hairs had still gotten to the redhead, and he was blinking stupidly now while plucking at one of them like a taut guitar string. “Huh?”
Blushing from head to toe, Castiel dumped the water over his head, and tried to think blessed thoughts.
“Cas, where’re my clothes?”
, Castiel had been taken aback. Even more so, the sound had curled around his heart and taken root there, a small feeble desire to hear more growing within.
Michael chuckled. “Your boss is quite the businessman. He had demanded a huge deposit to get you back.” He flashed his pearly whites at Dean. “As if I would hurt you…!”
Out of sheer discomfort, Dean was glad when dinner ended. People were standing and talking pleasantly, somehow ignoring the odoriferous elephant in the room. Dean didn't even know how they managed it, but he supposed it was so-called "superior breeding."
He looked up to find the woman putting their tea down, along with three tiny silver serving dishes, of which he recognized sugar and lemons. The cups were glass sitting in metal bottoms. He gingerly picked it up and found the metal not hot.
Cas seemed to get the idea and Dean panted as Cas pushed into Dean for the first time. Both of them groaned as Cas got fully seated and his hips stuttered against Dean’s.
Castiel scowled as his Alpha roared inside him, demanding to be let out and make sure
Michael shook his head. “You didn’t leave me anything I didn’t want.”
Sam gets some ideas. Dean deals with things. Maybe Michael isn't that much of a douche... maybe?
Until now, of course.
Cas smiled sweetly, and Dean grumbled as he flipped through the documents. “Hmm… it looks like his donor is from a place called Birloga.”
As he awkwardly stood there, feelng uncomfortable as fuck, a handsome man looking somewhat frazzled started to sweep past him. Dean opened his mouth to ask for help as he sailed passed, when the guy paused mid-step to turn and stare.
(送り犬 "sending-off dogs"): These are the same black ghost dogs from other countries. Which makes you wonder, doesn't it? They follow travelers home at night, waiting for you to trip or fall. The name refers to how they keep watch over a traveler like they are "seeing them off" safely.
“That powerful thing,” it intoned, “is my ass.”
“I have four older siblings, and a bunch of cousins who I grew up with, although I was really close to only three of them.” He smiled fondly at the memory. “My family was very religious, but not oppressively so, if that makes sense. I mean that in, Michael, Hael, and I love being Catholic, whereas Gabe and Luke have been rather… lax… about it.”
killing that Baku,” Dean gritted out before the pain got the better of him and he passed out.
I use “sin” because it was easier than explaining Buddhist stuffs. It’s fiction. Forgive me. [
“Ee-day-yo?”
Which was all to Castiel’s benefit.
Cas. The rich tones of apple pie and brown sugar, the clean smell of linen and freshly wet earth. He shuddered as his body throbbed with
Dean tried to get out of it again, protesting the cost and his discomfort as politely as he could manage without beating the Alpha with a nearby mannequin. But Michael not only insisted, he bought Dean a camel coat to go with his suit, forcing it on while Marv looked on with sad, pouchy eyes. The situation escalated briefly when Michael tried to get rid of Dean’s own clothes by telling the tailor to just throw them away, and Dean hissed and spat until Marv promised to send them and his leather jacket back with the ordered wear.
More cackling ensued as the bird flew off.
Michael grinned charmingly, dropped a kiss on the man’s knuckles, and pulled a handsome young Omega, with dirty-blond hair and bright-green eyes, into the room. The Omega looked uncomfortable although the tuxedo fit him perfectly, the peridot-green vest and tie glimmering faintly.
Dean ignored the burning in his cheeks and thanked Lucifer for his help. “I was told to wait for Michael, so I guess I’ll meet you downstairs?”
being the second choice.”
But worst (best?) of all, the scent coming off Cas was mesmerizing and Dean took a lungful, the rich aroma of molasses sinking into him.
: Alphas are generally hot-headed and sadly more short term thinkers. They take orders only from alphas more powerful from themselves. They are self-involved to a large extent, but that pure belief in themselves tends to carry over to their teams and/or companies, so they tend to make successful managers and entrepreneurs, if they have the people to back up their enthusiasm with common sense. Females CAN breed, but generally don't because of their genetics being messed with to breed out the more "feminine" traits for war and heighten their strength and stamina.
