Okay, that’s not useful at all. “Think harder, man,” Dean says, not unkindly. “Is there
Sam comes back into the room a short while later, wolf whistling at the shameless display, Eileen and Jack in tow. Dean flips him the bird behind Cas’ back without letting him go. His heart is soaring. They’re all together again, Team Free Will, a family he’d never thought he would be allowed to have.
battle to fight, Amara,” Chuck says. “My mess to clean up. And it’s a big one. But,” he smiles out at the field around him. A small yellow dog bounds by them, pulling her tired-looking owner along with far more strength than a tiny thing like her should have. He watches the two shapes disappear into the trees. “I think I owe them this much.”
“Nah, I insist. Besides, it’d be good to have company for a change.” If Cas were a human male, Dean would have had more of a problem with how desperate he might be coming off. It’s not cool. “I mean, if you need the place to stay - seems like you do, gonna be a bit suspicious if you just hang around where people can see you, y’know...”
Now if only this shell could do as he was told so Chuck can move on already.
“Dean Winchester,” Chuck says suddenly, startling him. “Y’know, I always liked Sam better. Thought he was easier to work with, better personality and all.”
“What?” Barachiel cries, stunned. “Where are you going?”
“I’m doing the best I can,” Castiel huffed, and felt his way to the other leg. The pain was significantly milder, but still made Dean hiss and clench his teeth in discomfort. His companion gave him a sympathetic glance and released him quietly.
“Oh, sure.” Dean heads into the hallway, a gleeful expression on his face as he goes to grab his keys. This is
“Where’s the kid?” he asks instead.
This poor guy just fell out of the sky, blue eyed amnesiac meteorite that he is, and Dean’s going and kicking him to the curb
“Y-you need help getting that off?” Dean asks warily. He really doesn’t feel like getting any closer to the guy than he is already. What if he has rabies or something? Dean doesn’t want rabies.
Dean growls. “Your point being?”
The guy laughs, a deep and husky sound. “My translator is universal. It works to translate your speech into mine and my speech into yours. Thank you for helping me, by the way. My name is Castiel. Or at least, that’s the closest approximation your human tongue will allow.”
“I…” He seems to think hard for a moment, face screwed up in concentration. “I don’t recall much of my life back home, either.”
“Really?” Adam quirks a brow. There’s a bit of both Michael and Adam in that look. “Sooo… you crying on angel radio for everyone to hear begging for Castiel to come back was, what, a dud?”
Dean looks at him. Like,
It’s time to get over this rut he’s put himself into. He’s got to be a man, and pick up the pieces Lisa left behind. That everyone left behind. With him.
Dean leaps back instantly, aiming the gun at the guy’s head in case he tries something funny. Curious eyes open to peer at him in confusion. His mouth opens and closes a few times but nothing comes out.
“It’ll be quiet again?” The beginnings of hope, childlike and unfamiliar.
— is chasing him might be even worse than him. Something powerful. Something mean. Dean thinks of the time he read that sci-fi novel Sam lent him about a baby alien running away from its home. How a whole fleet got sent after it to track it down, laying waste to the environment around them. What if it’s like that? Clearly anything’s possible after what went on today.
“Besides, you just got back today,” continues Sam, circling around the edge to sit across from him, his own bottle in hand. “So it’ll be like a reunion party for the both of you.”
“I should go.” he says, avoiding Dean’s eyes, and Dean really shouldn’t stop him, should let him go so they can both once again avoid this thing which they’ve been dancing so precariously around for years,
Dean pales. “Cas, it’s not like that-“
Dean snorts. “You gathered correctly.”
“Yeah, well, forgive me for not being too thrilled about it,” spits the elder Winchester, but there’s no real bite to it, not anymore. So many losses have taken every last ounce of fight left in him, leaving nothing but a shell behind.
Chuck sighs. “I’ve been thinking about some things, and I’ve made a decision.”
The ghost of Castiel’s disapproving expression haunts him, and he blinks rapidly to get the stinging burn away. Dean looks up again, forcing himself to make eye contact with Michael — no, Adam, who looks more vulnerable than he’s ever seen him.
He had a point. Dean’s father had always told him, when him and Sam were still moving from hotel room to hotel room like a bunch of vagabonds, to never move someone who’d broken something. It’d just damage the limb further, and cut into vital regions.
Dean’s back touches the wall and he sinks to the ground, hitting the stone with a muffled
Cas nods in affirmation. “You know what I think, Dean? I think you’re frustrated,” he murmurs casually, bringing the angel blade to Dean’s cheek, pressing into the skin gently. For a blinding moment, Dean thinks he’ll slash him open, right down to the bone, and finds that he wouldn’t mind it all too much if Cas decided to do just that. But the angel just holds it there, grip firm and blade tip digging into the meat of his cheek.
He doesn’t expect the responding welcome to be pleasant by any means.
And now what am I supposed to do?”
Maybe he could see those blue eyes again, that wild, mussed-up hair. Say back the words that he couldn’t say then, when an angel was in tears before him, telling him those three little words, smiling as he sacrificed his life, once again, for someone who would never deserve it.
“Your brother’s heart is too big, even for that giant frame of his.”
A note of desperation has begun to creep into Dean’s voice. He’s not sure if Cas can hear it, but
“I didn’t expect to see you again,” Castiel replies honestly. He still hasn’t let go, his hand resting against the back of Dean’s head. If he keeps this up, then Dean might just start to get too comfortable, maybe even start to think he’s allowed happiness in this miserable life of his. “I needed to speak my peace so that the Shadow would take us and spare you. I’m sorry.”
Dean flinches backward, but Castiel is still holding him in place. “Cas, I think-“
Castiel deepens the kiss. Dean’s lips are soft and taste faintly of cherry pie, mingled with the sourness of morning breath. He wrinkles his nose and pulls away, ignoring Dean’s soft growl of protest. His soul is practically blinding, now, almost like the sunlight filtering in through the shutters of their room, flashing intermittent shades of inviting pink and that soft green Castiel has come to greatly prefer.
“But —”
“I don’t trust you,” she sneers through tears.
The sun beat down on his back in waves. His shirt was soaked with sweat and gritty seawater, and his trousers itched, uncomfortably stiff. Dean pushed away the urge to strip completely, instead lying there prone, facedown on the heated softness beneath him.
Castiel gazes up at him in admiration. It turns out that the residual power Jack had absorbed in the Empty was a temporary, one-and-done thing. Sam had told him as they were still catching up that it had dripped off of him in the days and weeks afterward, slowly siphoning his own archangel grace along with it and leaving only a whole, healed soul behind.
He tries to think of a witty one liner to say,
“I reeally hope you’re not dead...” he mutters under his breath as he prods it experimentally with the stick. If he was alive at all, he makes no indication that he felt the jab.
“That’s fine, I just need to get you away from the shore.” Dean felt his face turn toward him, hot breath ghosting along the side of his face. It took away from the pain for a few moments, but every time his limp foot parted the sand as his companion dragged him away from the water, it sent electric shocks shooting up his spine. It took everything in him not to collapse right there.
They’re both in their boxers now, hands roaming and lips kissing wherever they can reach. Cas licks Dean’s lips open and gently but insistently probes the inside of his mouth; Dean recoils briefly at the intrusion but then allows him in.
“Do you think you can get up?” The stranger asked. “Is anything broken?”
Same old quiet house, same old empty feeling way down deep in his chest. He’s alone at home now, has been for a while — Sam’s just gone off to college, not three weeks ago, everyone else is dead, last time he checked  — and his girlfriend’s familiar, comforting warmth won’t be there to help get him through it either.
Indecision blooms on his brother’s face, and seemingly out of habit, he pulls his jacket closer around him. It occurs to Dean that he has their father’s eyes. He’d never thought to look before. Never thought it would be so important.
Castiel crawls back on top of Dean, this time with the angel blade drawing across the wide expanse of his chest, tracing his nipple with its tip and scratching the skin around it. It makes Dean shudder and sigh, but the angel is undeterred, continuing his ministrations.
“My grandfather won’t be back.” There is a strange, sad twist to Jack’s expression, one that Dean and Sam recognize all too well. Then, in the same heartbeat, he brightens, like he’s already put all of the hardships in his life behind him. “We should go see how everyone’s doing.”
“Wait, you can’t just — “ Dean starts angrily, but Chuck has already disappeared. He throws his hands up in the air, running his tongue across his teeth in frustration. “
Dean winces at the mental image. “Jesus.”
And damn, if that’s not the most arousing thing he’s heard today, Dean thinks, shifting uncomfortably. His jeans are the tightest they’ve ever been, ever since Rhonda Hurley and that one night they spent with the pink satiny panties.
“Thank you, Dean. Though…” Castiel starts to look more troubled. “It has just now occurred to me that this can’t be my ship.”
The framework had already been there. Everything he’d ever made all cobbled together into one realm.
you remember?”
“Chuck came to the Empty to rest,” explains Castiel, squinting slightly, “and I suppose this was his way of trying to make things right.”
Amara says nothing, so he takes a deep breath. “Before I go, I just wanted to say I’m sorry, sis. Again. For everything I did to you. For locking you away with the Mark all those years ago, for leaving you alone, for —”
Cas looked as he thrust his weapon into his doppelganger’s body, and Dean is reminded of how he had yet again chosen Dean, chosen
Be sure to leave kudos and/or a comment if you liked :)) thanks for reading!
He usually accepts that they’re not on speaking terms anymore, but some part of him still remembers holding her in his arms in their shared bed, Ben nestled comfortably between the two of them like a sleepy, contented kitten. To think he’d had a family, just up until a week ago. To think after all he’d done for them, he’d been thrown away like it was nothing.
Chuck seeks out that old, rickety bench just beneath the shade of a large grove, where she liked to sit in the afternoons and drink tea to old showtunes. Then he closes his eyes. From out of his outstretched fingers comes the thick, cascading black smoke, wisping at the edges and pouring out into a human shaped mold. She’s wearing the signature black dress, her default style, dark hair cascading about her shoulders.
“Is that what we are?” he can almost hear the squint in alien’s voice. “Friends?”
He spreads his legs even more and moans, loving the way Cas is ruthless and efficient with him, the way he fucks the hilt of the angel blade into Dean’s awaiting, receptive asshole.
“Sorry if I’m not as thrilled about this as you are,” Dean spits, looking like he desperately wants to be. “He, what, just changed his mind like
Everyone except for Michael, who gives no indication that he’s even heard. Never Michael, who would have once laid down his life for his beloved Father, the one who told him to obey and love his creations as if they were God himself. Michael, who never once questioned his faith, even after all those centuries in the Cage, says nothing.
Dean’s peripherals are still swimming. Dizziness overtakes him and he sways, but thankfully doesn’t fall over. “T-that’s okay. Did it work?”
One that they had been made to break in the first place.
demons left on Earth,” Dean says, then the realization dawns on him as the crow’s feet around Castiel’s eyes crinkle in response. “Son of a bitch.”
He doesn’t realize he’s on his knees until his spine jolts at the contact between them and the ground. His vision is blurred, and there’s wetness on his cheeks. He doesn’t know how long he sits there, shuddering hiccups growing into all out, heaving sobs. The dust beneath his arms is gritty and sticks to the skin; there’s nothing quite as miserable as this, cold and alone and hurting in a way no spirits can heal.
“Adam’s in there too, isn’t he?” God asks, squinting at the vessel’s face, both youthful and impossibly old all at once. It’s partially his fault the kid was left in the Cage for so long. “Send him my regards.”
the one who’s been burned.
“He thought we could, I dunno, talk it out,” Dean shrugs. “I told him this was gonna be a one way trip to the slaughterhouse, yet here we are.” His gaze shifts sideways, and his expression is taut and wary, poised like a cut bowstring. But his body is relaxed — limp, almost, like he’s accepted his fate.
“Maybe I don’t.” Chuck will play devil’s advocate, for the man who had shot him in the shoulder and wished him dead. “But please, educate me.”
He’d stripped his boxers off, and his erection stands proud and at the ready. It’s pretty, just like the rest of Cas, and veined with a slightly purpling tip, a swath of curly hair wreathed at the base. Dean takes the opportunity to gaze lustfully at Castiel’s body, marveling at the tanned skin over lean muscle and the five o’clock shadow cast on his handsome face. He shucks his own boxers and waits, mindlessly palming his own length.
He’s got a point. Both of them know that with this new development, things have definitely changed, and arguably for the worse.
“Hey, wait.” Dean moves to stand in front of the doorway, blocking the alien’s path. “Cas.”
and tiptoes out the front door, keeping it ajar behind him just in case he needs to make a tactical retreat.
He’s shown his new friend the house, bedrooms, bathrooms —he’s got no need for those, apparently — the kitchen, everything. Then Dean gets this far off, starstruck look on his face.
He forgets he’s staring until the stranger makes that same weird clicking and hissing sound again, gesturing to the weird device lodged into the side of his neck. His eyes bug in frustration.
When Dean died the new Death would appear to him, whoever they might be. Billie had been a reaper of tradition. She would have done exactly as she’d promised in the name of keeping order, and then maybe he might’ve seen Cas again. Though in the end she had been swallowed up too, eaten by the Shadow, what was to say that her successor wouldn’t be as merciful?
His brother and his wife - those two little kids of theirs — waiting all the way out in another country, anticipating his visit — they’d be in for a disappointment, now. He’d never see Sam again. And to think they were only just making amends for the things they had done, the things they’d said to each other.
“Right again! And that’s not all.” Chuck’s grin is as dazzling as the curtains of afternoon sunlight filtering in through the trees. “You’re missing the best part.”
Cas smiles at him, interlacing their fingers. “Dean,” he murmurs, eyes sad, “What happens next?”
Castiel is shaking his head before Dean has even finished talking. “No, Dean. I appreciate the offer, but this is too much of an intrusion into your personal space. I have already spent too long at your dwelling.” He makes to leave, but Dean’s presence in the doorway stops him.
“Yeah. I did.”
“What could
The smile on her face is too wide, pained and mirthless. A look of pure suffering. Once again, he feels the sympathy take root in his core, his smile vanishing, and tries not to flinch away at this open display.
“What was that for?” he asked when he could see again.
shot him, after all.
matter. All of us.”
“Cas, please…” Dean begs, but the angel ignores him in favor of chasing his own orgasm, pulling out all the way and then slamming into him one final, devastating time with a groan. A hot pulse of come splashes Dean’s insides and he shudders.
“And you are getting inebriated to the point of collapse.” Michael cuts in, his tone clipped. “To...celebrate.”
. Dean feels his arms, warm and hesitant, circle his waist until they’re wrapped around him tight, and his hands begin to rub soothing circles in between his shoulder blades. As if that weren’t embarrassing enough, he’s crooning into Dean’s ear, something soft and low and grounding. Dean just lets it all go then, his shoulders shaking as he breaks down, and if Castiel cares that he’s getting his trenchcoat wet he doesn’t mention it.
The man sits up and inclines his head at Dean. A weird hissing sound oozes out from between his lips, a noise that puts Dean on edge. And there’s more to this guy that Dean couldn’t see before. He looks human, or at least he did before, but now that Dean’s seen the pointed, tapered ears that hid behind the shock of brown hair and the weird, gill-like ridges that run up the sides of his pale, blue-tinted neck, he knows that the man is anything but.
“I .. I was too disoriented to be able to discern it when I first emerged, but… this isn’t a vessel.” Castiel flips it over and gives it another once-over, clicking his tongue in dissatisfaction. “According to the inscriptions on its base, I am currently holding an
Dean woke up to searing, flashing pain in his legs. A throbbing ache, a million times worse than any hangover he’d ever had the pleasure to experience, shot through his head like a bolt of lightning. Coarse sand coated his rough, bloodied fingertips; when he put his hand to the back of his skull it came away sticky and red. His arms were sore. A cut just above his cheekbone smarted unpleasantly, oozing blood in bright red rivulets down his chin.
..~*~..
“I don’t understand,” says the Shadow, face twisted in confusion.
“Kind of like bees, then,” Dean muses. An image of Castiel, wide eyed and in a striped bee costume comes to his mind and he brushes it aside with a quiet chuckle.
“You aren’t going to die,” the stranger said sharply, “not on my watch.” He lifted two unsteady hands. Dean watched as they hovered over his left leg with disinterest. “Hey, tell me if I’m getting warmer.”
It’s a quiet afternoon, all things considered. The trip to the woods isn’t far enough that they need to take the car, but it’s enough of a walk that it leaves Dean winded and reminded of how much he'd let himself get away in just two weeks. He’ll have to start working out again, get off his ass and live a little like he’d been meaning to.
Castiel’s softening cock slips out of Dean’s ass and he gets up again, leaving Dean cold and alone on the mattress. Dean stifles a sob. His dick leans against his abs, hard, unattended, and purpling, a thin dribble of semen pooling at the dip of his belly. He moves to take care of it, closing his fist around its length, but Cas stops him, his voice sounding distant and stern.
to say it,” Dean whispers against heated skin, because there’s no longer any reason to keep it in. He’s free. They all are. “I love you.”
Once fully manifested, Amara sends him a confused look. “What’s wrong?”
As much as he hates to admit it, something in the Winchesters’ words have stirred something inside him. They’re right. He
The house is too quiet now. Every creak of the floorboards that isn’t made by the ones under his own feet make him jump, and he thinks he might be seeing faces in the mirror behind him when he’s brushing his teeth. Funny, how loneliness can turn you kind of insane after a while.
“Jack, listen to me — “ Dean is saying.
Dean opens and closes his mouth, not for the first time that morning. He chooses to backtrack, inhaling deeply. “Look, Cas, if you need a place to crash… uh, sorry, wrong choice of words —“ The alien tilts his head. “If you need a place to
Aliens exist? This is
Adam starts, but he gets dragged back into the body they share, and it’s too late because that sets off something in Dean, too. The archangel’s face is positively thunderous.
God sighs, snaps his fingers, and that white, blinding aura surrounding him shuts right off. It doesn’t have the effect he’d hoped, because now they deem it safe to get even closer, flanking him on all sides and nattering away about “how good it is to finally meet you, sir!” and “I
I am just going to ignore 15x19 because it was also a travesty. Holding out hope for episode 20 to make it right, but if not then I'm going to consider my own ending canon :')
That’s the way all good tales come to a close. He ought to do as Jack asks, end him and then them, once and for all right there in front of the pulpit so he can revel in the sweet victory, one that has taken countless repeats to secure.
Father’ thing, but he affords Michael a pat on the back, a warm glance. “It’s on you now. Whatever you want to do.” His gaze sweeps across the crowd. “All of you. You are free to do as you wish from here on out.”
“What are you gonna do to me?” Dean’s breath is uneven and ragged, and his voice is shaky, but Castiel doesn’t seem to notice.
And now Cas is dead. Jack, happy as he is,  won’t look at him with anything other than a meek sort of fear, and Sam…
Overhead, the stars wink at him, as if in mockery. He wonders if Castiel is out there somewhere. He’s not, but it’s still nice to think about.
“I thought you weren’t coming back this time.” admits Dean, because something in him, a dam he’s spent his whole life building, has broken, and now decades worth of emotions are rushing out to the forefront. Maybe it’s about time they did. “I was so scared, man.”
Outside, Miracle barks twice. Dean shifts his gaze away in the direction of the door and groans.
He felt a tiny, warm hand wrap around his fingers, staining them with the mystery stickiness of a child at play.  “Come have tea with us, sir!” she said to him affecting a British accent.
“No, baby,” Dean kissed his hands again and looked at him, “I don’t want you to do anything, just because my body has a mind of its own.  It’s okay if you’re not ready.”
Dean grinned, “Alright then!  I can work with that.”
Castiel closed his eyes and sighed, unsure what emotion he was trying to release: relief from the fuzziness that had invaded him, loss at not feeling Dean anymore, joy that he wanted to kiss him, or sorrow that he would never feel the press of his lips.
Castiel turned in the same direction to see what they were looking at.  Dean was waiting for the doors to open and seeing him, Castiel felt that pang to his gut again.  But it was better this way.  Better for Castiel, and better for Dean.  He would be able to go on with his life and Castiel would just become a strange memory.  The doors opened, and Dean stepped in without a backward glance.
A splash of bright yellow and a familiar name caught his attention and he pulled it out of its snug spot on the shelf.  “Passing On: Brick Holmes’ Guide to the Afterlife” was just the book for him, he thought as he scanned the front cover.  It had a picture of the star quarterback about to throw a football pass.  Dean nodded to himself, if Brick Holmes had something to say on the subject of ghosts, then maybe he didn’t have to feel so foolish about it.
“I guess!  You tell me.”
“What if this… ghost… appears in the shape of an angry dude in a trench coat that wants me to leave my apartment.”
,” and he shook his head at his brother’s constant joking, even in the current situation.
“Whatever you have must be contagious because yeah, I’ll help you.”
Castiel looked away, confused, “No.  It’s a good idea.”
“You doing alright, Dean?”
“A little to the left, Padre,” Dean said shaking his head.
“Um, Dean?  Mind telling me what the hell is going on?”
Dean jumped out of bed like he had been electrified, drawing Castiel’s frown.  He fished around at his feet and picked up his discarded jeans, sticking his feet into them and yanking them up with a couple awkward hops.
“It’s Crowley.  He’s the one who’s going to turn off the machines,” Castiel said.
“Don’t you dare!” came the deep gritty voice from where the man in the trench coat had suddenly appeared on the other side of the low table.
“I don’t know, I just do.  Just push in the knife.”  Castiel watched as Dean struggled with himself, his hands shaking.  “Harder, Dean!” Castiel barked at him.
“Can you feel his ribs?”
“Tell me.”
“If you want me to.  I don’t really have anywhere else to go.”
.” Castiel said under his breath, lost in his contemplations.
“What’re you thinking about?”
“How long have you been on, Crowley?”
“I am not dead!” the man yelled, a terrifying glare lowered on Dean and lancing him right through the gut.
“Cas,” Dean whispered against his lips even as he tried to put a little distance between them to recover.
“I don’t understand that reference.  And I worry about the noise coming from your engine… should it be that loud?”
Gabriel walked around Dean and crouched down beside the table where his daughters had pulled out more paper and were busy drawing.  Dean turned to face Castiel again, feeling that hope fan into excitement.
They wheeled the cart down the hallway.  Castiel disappeared and reappeared nearly instantly. “There’s an empty gurney in the next room.”
“…viral pneumonia…”
“Somehow, I doubt that very much.”
“Are you sure?  You can come back with me.  It’s fine.  I mean… it
Castiel spent the rest of the day devising new ways to make sure Dean didn’t have a moment of peace and quiet.  Dean was too stubborn to do anything but dig his heels in and show the insufferable dickwad how impervious he was to his childish tactics.  Didn’t stop him having a mild heart attack though every time blue-eyes appeared out of thin air right where he least expected him to be.
Castiel watched the exchange tumble out of control and all he could feel was horror.  This could not be the only clue that meant anything.  Not this man afraid his wife would discover a secret of his that involved him.
“Of course, you won’t mind if I confirm with Dr. Shurley?”
“Watch me,” Dean said, and he took another swallow of his poison, his face stretched in a wince as it undoubtedly burned down to his stomach.
“Dude, come on, seriously?” she said, looking up at him like he had just insulted her, her parents and all her ancestors.  “We’re friends.  I’m not charging you here.  Besides, helping damsels in distress is kinda my thing.”
Dean’s frown disappeared from his face again as he looked away and he smiled and started to laugh softly again.  “Hey, look on the bright side!  At six, I’m coming into some money!”
“This is my apartment,” continued the man, coolly, rationally.  “This is my bed.  That’s my picture.”  He looked towards the dresser on the other side of the bed and suddenly stood up stiffly, turned towards it with closed fists.  “What did you do with my picture?”  The man’s eyes were suddenly flitting around the whole room, landing on certain things and staying fixated before moving on, maybe taking stock of what else had gone missing.
“New leads, that’s what!  We’ve got a dry cleaner’s ticket and a book of matches.”
He stood from the couch looking for more changes so he could collect clues and piece together what had happened in his absence.  As he moved closer to the hallway, a draft blew into the room carrying with it the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers.  Bright light was coming from the normally dark hallway and he moved towards it to find that the door to the roof was wide open.  He didn’t remember it being open when he came in.  Maybe Gabriel or Rowena had opened it when they left.  That didn’t explain why the air smelled of flowers though. There was nothing up there that should smell like that.
He turned back towards the couch and the mindless TV as he cracked the tab on his beer.  He stopped dead in his tracks when he looked up to find a man in a tan trench coat standing with his back to him in the middle of the room.
“Dean?  What are you doing?” asked Charlie in a strained voice.
“Sarcasm doesn’t become you, Castiel,” he said without looking up but catching the scent of burning paper, knowing the jerk wasn’t even making it up.
With an endearing chuckle, the man looked around with a smile on his face, “Yeah.  I know.”  He paused looking around at the bookshelves, “I grew up with this stuff.  My dad owns the store, and his dad before him.  My grandfather dedicated his entire life to the research into everything supernatural.  A true man of letters.  This is his legacy.”
“Um… laundry,” he answered feeling foolish.  “Why are you here?”  Dean realized his tone sounded a little harsh when Castiel’s shoulders dipped slightly and he looked away.  Dean scolded himself, feeling like the world’s biggest ass.
“Excuse me.  Could you go to the third-floor nursing station?”
“Yeah… and what’s option two?”
“I need to take his body.  Get him as far away as possible so we can have more time to figure out how to get him back in there.”  The silence was thicker than the summer morning fog as Dean begged Charlie with every microscopic particle of his being.  “Say something.”
Castiel nodded at him, feeling almost feverish with purpose and direction.  “Good,” he said, “Let’s find out who I am.”
“No.  It’s not really something that ever came up.  You know:
Another turn, and Dean spotted the bank of elevators that would take them down to the parked van.  He pushed harder, seeing the doors open.  Another security guard, talking into the radio receiver clipped to his shoulder, spotted them and broke into a run to intercept them.  Dean had no choice but to dig in his heels and use his weight to bring the gurney to a stop pulling back so he could change directions again.
“Me, or my closet gay lover,” he grumbled.  This whole day had only revealed to Castiel the sad lonely truth of his existence and he’d had enough of it.  He didn’t want to keep digging just to find out how useless and dull his life had been.
He had woken up that morning feeling like a thousand pounds had been lifted from his shoulders.  He was loath to use words like “catharsis” because that was the kind of word Charlie liked to throw around, and like hell was he going to suddenly start spewing that head quack mind stuff.  All he knew was that in that moment, he found himself
“What is happening to me?” he uttered, all the anger drained away and leaving only a terrified whisper.
Dean suddenly sat up and glared at the apparition, the room neither dark nor bright, illuminated as it was by the outside lights.  He noted that the man was wearing that same tan trench coat as before.  “It’s you who’s in here!” he told him angrily, tapping the side of his head with his finger.
“Yeah, great, let’s get the hell out of here!”
“No,” he said with a frown, but then he looked off behind Castiel and a goofy grin crept back onto his face as he drank again, making him think that Dean’s mind probably was set to that single track.
“He’s kind of hostile, isn’t he?” Sam said calmly even as he swallowed visibly and glanced around.
Looking like the last thing he wanted to do was feel some dying man’s chest, Dean turned and pushed through the gathered people.  “Move!  I need to feel his chest.”
“The couch?  What?  Why?”
He pushed open the gate and gestured Castiel to go ahead of him so he could watch his reaction.  He did not disappoint.  As he walked into the estate’s sprawling gardens, Castiel went from a regular walk, to slow motion, to a full-on Dorothy “We’re not in Kansas anymore” open-mouthed, slow turn.  Dean felt himself glowing on the inside seeing Castiel so captivated by the beauty all around him.  And just as Castiel took in the garden, Dean took in Castiel.  He couldn’t take his eyes off him, although he would have loved to lose the damn trench coat to get a better look at what he could only guess was a trim physique.  Still, he liked the shape of him, even with the stupid coat.
.  He read on and found other words that together made the flyer even more interesting: Furnished.  Hardwood.  Mason St and Green St.
“I’m not doing anything.”
A slow steady thump sounded in his ears, mirrored by a beeping that resonated in his head before it faded away and then the thump again, and another beep.  Castiel looked down at his hands, at least where his hands should be, but found only darkness.
Castiel was mortified for a half-second after the words escaped his mouth, but it quickly turned to relief and amazement when Dean’s face morphed into a goofy, lop-sided grin.  “Oh!  Thank you.”  Castiel couldn’t help but smile with him.
Castiel looked from Dean to his shell on the bed and back again.  “I don’t know.”
Castiel made eye contact with Dean, willing him to believe that he truly was sorry for how he had behaved before.  Dean looked away; his body language uncomfortable as he sat up on the side of the bed opposite from him.  “Alright, fine.  But can you get out of here?  I need to shower and get dressed and if it’s alright with you, I’d like to do that alone.”
“I’m here, Dean,” he said softly from the corner where he sat on the padded recliner.
Dean felt him moving away again and he cupped either side of his face to keep him close.  It was only when he heard the soft rustling of Cas’ overcoat, followed by a rich fabric thump on the floor that Dean opened his eyes and drew away, startled.  Castiel’s coat and jacket lay crumpled on the bedroom floor and as Dean’s eyes lifted back to Castiel’s face, it was to see him pulling at the knot in his blue tie and discarding it to join the heap at their feet.
Castiel didn’t answer, keeping his own uncertainty to himself.  The next person to open their door was a woman: middle-aged, ash-brown locks from a bottle and brown eyes that looked at her visitor suspiciously at first, but warmed up quickly enough when Dean explained the reason for his visit.
Sam from the bookstore straightened up and rubbed his hands together as he looked around, checking his set up.  “Spirit boards can be used to communicate with those who are caught in the veil between worlds; between being alive and moving on.”
“It was new,” he said lamely, sensing before it was out, that Gabriel could see right through him.
“Not you, Charlie,” Dean said, his face contorted in confusion.  “I wasn’t talking to you.”
With his lips half-cocked into a smile he knew Jody found charming and irresistible, he pushed the door open with his back and joined the mixed crowd of doctors, nurses, attendants, patients and visitors that kept the hospital milling like a busy anthill.  With a surge of adrenaline and a much-needed boost from the hot coffee, Castiel joined the fray.
“Oh, this just keeps getting better.”
Castiel glanced at him, but didn’t dare linger, “Maybe the dry cleaner was right about me.  Let’s go.”
Dean considered the question a moment before leaning forward and pulling the paper out of his back pocket.  “For the same reason that I kept this.” He unfolded the drawing that Castiel’s niece had drawn of them holding hands.  “I wanted something… to remember you.  Something I could have in case… you go away.”
Dean glanced back towards the open part of the van where Castiel was sitting in a jumper seat barely affected by the van’s wild rocking.  Charlie, however, was plastered to the passenger door holding on to handle and dashboard and looking a little pale.
Castiel turned back to the stillness of the room and took his wallet and keys out of his blazer pockets and put them down on the table in the dining room.  He smoothed his hand over the wood feeling a twinge of discomfort.
“Oh my God!  Dean!”  Charlie exclaimed, drawing Dean’s eyes momentarily to see that she was looking down at Castiel with a look of total shock.
Castiel looked around again.  “I dreamed of this place.  These flowers, everything.”  Dean’s skin crawled, aware on a subconscious level of the forces pulling on the strings of their destinies.  “It’s beautiful,” he said, turning his attention back to Dean and stepping closer, standing just within reach.  “And you made this.”
Castiel scrambled at the glimmer of memory but it was gone again before he could grasp it.
“Are you almost done with your third grade science presentation?  I’d like to get back to—“
“Uh, yeah.  Everything’s great.  I’m just… curious.”
“That’s really not…  I mean, I don’t want anyone dead…  I just,” Dean stammered, trying to maintain the conversation while his brain was going a mile a minute adding the new information to his understanding of the situation.  If the guy had died, then he really was dealing with his ghost.  What was he supposed to do about that?
Dean leaned in towards him.  “That matchbook had more than some random address as a clue.  It came from somewhere, which means maybe you were there too.”
Dean’s eyebrows shot up again and he licked his lips absently.  Castiel rolled his eyes.  “She’s not exactly subtle,” he said, taking note of her posture and of her needlessly low neckline and exposed cleavage before shaking his head.  Her eyes were moving all over Dean, lingering on certain parts of his anatomy, like his plump lips, the splash of freckles across his nose, the long dark lashes around his eyes, his wide shoulders, his long legs, his…   Castiel looked away again.
He heard Dean huff after a rather drawn-out breath. That was his cue.
He saw a flush creep up Dean’s neck as Cas shivered slightly from the chill of the morning, despite the fact the kitchen was warm with family and the stove.
He smiled as he continued to suck him down, drawing himself back up and sucking on the head at the top, letting his jaw slack as he went back down to the root and repeated the motion as Dean’s hips slowly began to rise in time with him as if asking him to take more.
I wanted to continue where the boys left off and I thought this might do the trick ;)
Cas looked up at Dean, notching both of them were still naked under the covers. “Uh, one minute!” Dean called, watching the door intently. Cas certainly hadn’t locked it after coming back to sleep last night.
“That’s abusing his powers,” Cas frowned, looking at Jack who looked excited at the suggestion for a moment. He hesitated, taking a deep breath. “But perhaps it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. Besides, you have to practice using your new abilities somehow, right?”
shirts, seeing Dean watch him closely as he pulled it over his head and smoothed out the folds.
“We need to get up.” Dean sighed, removing his hand much to Cas’ disapproval and throwing the covers off both of them. “Think Sammy will mind if we show up in pajamas?”
He felt Dean hesitate with tension as he promptly decided to bite where his shoulder met the base of his neck and moving to a drawn suck when Dean moaned lightly at his teasing, raising his hips to press against Cas’ and the former angel feeling the heat and hardness of his cock pressing against his own.
“Yeah,” Dean scoffed, “the dungeon.”
he signed back, tugging on the hem of his shirt as he stood outside the door.
Dean’s eyes widened as Cas moved into their bed, drawing the covers up over his hips and caressing Dean’s jawline, and moving his thumb down to hold his jaw against his knuckle.
“You hold me together, Cas.”
“Let me hear you,” he told Dean as he reached over to the bedside table, pulling out the drawer and feeling carefully for the bottle he knew was kept there. He found it and uncapped the lid with a sharp
“You know, Sam will be expecting us in about an hour,” Cas murmured. “If I’m awake, he’ll be up soon.”
“I’ll be right back,” he whispered, shuffling across the room and opening the door as quietly as possible. He turned around to shut it, turning the handle before pressing it back into the frame to avoid a loud click echoing through the hallway.
he paused, pretending to hold a toothbrush and making a motion across his mouth.
“Here,” Cas whispered, lacing their fingers together in one smooth motion and leaning into him, pressing his lips against Dean’s.
What does breakfast look like for Cas' little family? I've got an answer
Cas bumped his hips to Dean's, scraping off the leftover syrup and pancake bits from the rest of the plates and opening the dishwasher. “You sure you don’t want to come?”
He smiled, looking to Sam’s room where she’d emerged from, and noticed she was wearing one of his shirts which fell down to her thighs, and a pair of loose shorts that accompanied her makeshift pajamas.
“We’re all happy here,” Dean said, feeling Cas’ thumb brush back and forth across the back of his hand and an ache of adoration travel through him. “Things feel right.”
“That’s Dean’s shirt!” She said in what Cas wanted to believe was a whisper but ended up being far louder than she’d intended. Or maybe she hadn’t intended to be quiet at all, which he realized later was probably more likely.
This caught Dean’s attention as Jack waved his hand, a faint golden light emitting from his palm as he hung a blanket over what seemed to be an invisible corner, pulling the edges taught. “Really now?” He asked his brother, eyeing him, unable to hide his humor.
She nodded, proceeding to make a similar gesture using her index finger instead of pretending to hold a toothbrush.
Cas pressed a final kiss to his temple, resting his head against the pillow and letting sleep catch him in a promise that he’d wake up in a few hours with Dean in his arms.
“But-”
“You like that?” Castiel purred, and if he added another finger Dean didn’t seem to notice.
Dean broke their kiss, his eyes still closed as he pulled away slightly, taking in air before learning back in and kissing Cas’ neck and the scratch against his hand surprisingly pleasant as Cas tilted his head back, his eyes closed as he sunk down into the blankets, Dean moving so he was above him, planting gentle kisses one at a time onto this reverent creature giving himself so freely.
Castiel would emerge from his designated room about half an hour after the Winchesters awoke once he was certain a conversation would be feasible between the three of them. He’d learned more often than not it was pointless to talk to either of them - but more so, Dean - before they were properly caffeinated. Castiel never slept, but rather would meditate on his bed into the early hours of the morning reflecting on far too many topics to discern. He would think most often about his little family that had managed to find each other after many,
Humanity had given him more power than Grace ever could have. Humanity had given him the freedom to choose. But with humanity, there were some differences he’d forgotten since the Great Fall of Heaven’s angels those many years ago.
“May I?” Cas asked, his voice coming out rougher than he’d anticipated.
Cas tilted his head slightly, looking up at the sturdy wooden and metal beams overhead. “Is the bunker not adequate to keep us safe?” He asked, resting his hips against the table.
If the world had gone still in the moment before, everything seemed to rush back into place as Dean realized what was happening, the graces cooling and burning on his skin once more as he kissed Cas back, the rough sensation of his chapped lips complementing the scratch of his stubble on Dean’s hand which was caressing his jawline ever so gently.
Cas reluctantly pulled himself from the comfort of the bed and put on his own pants, but walked over to Dean’s dresser and pulled out one of
Dean pressed a kiss to his forehead and sat up, Cas resting his head on his thigh, still aware that neither of them had clothes on. He ran his hand through Cas’ hair in soft strokes, twisting his fingers gently around the ends that curled slightly from being unkempt.
His certainty wavered and he laid his hands on top of hers stopping her in her attempt to remove his pants.  “Wait,” he managed to get out before she covered his mouth with hers again, her arms wrapping around his shoulders as she pressed herself against his bare chest.
“You’re no fun.”  He took another sip of his drink and Castiel wanted nothing more than to grab it out of his hand and drag him out of the bar.  He reached for the glass, and Dean jerked it away from him before answering. “Yeah, I’m sleeping.  A good eight hours most nights.”
“Are you done?” Dean asked him feigning boredom.
He scrambled at his boxer briefs one handed while he clung to Castiel, refusing to stop kissing him, desperate to keep touching him.  It was Castiel who relieved him of his cumbersome clothing and as soon as he had, Dean stretched himself on top of him, lining his cock up with the fold of Castiel’s leg.  He thrust against him, burying his face in Castiel’s neck as he writhed and worked towards his own release.  He could feel the quickly mounting pressure at the base of his spine and he gasped and moaned.  Castiel held him tightly, one hand in his hair making his scalp tingle, and Dean rutted against him, the pleasure growing ever more intense until everything fell away and all he could feel was Castiel’s skin, that scent of thyme enhanced by their sweating bodies and mingling with the rose petals’ sweet perfume.  The feel of Castiel’s hands on him was almost too much, the scratch of his facial hair against his temple, the man’s firm body under him, his arms holding him so tightly.  Dean felt the orgasm overtake him as the tingling travelled from the roots of his hair to the base of his cock and he released his come onto Castiel’s stomach with a groan of relief.  He moved against his body until he was spent.
Dean looked at him and slowly nodded, before looking away again.  Castiel was moved by how deeply Dean felt.  He found himself wishing he had met someone who would have cared about him that way.  Who would be left to cry for him when they unplugged him?  Gabriel might miss him for a while, but he would move on quickly.  He had to for his family.
“Who?”
Castiel should have been comforted by the pull of Dean’s lips into another wide smile as he drove through an intersection, but he wasn’t.  He had gone completely insane.  This venture was far from guaranteed, and it would have some serious consequences should they fail.  Castiel had nothing to lose, he would be dead at noon if they did nothing. But Dean, his life would be forever changed if they tried this and failed.  So many things could go wrong.  And yet Castiel found himself desperately hoping he would succeed as they sped towards this unknown individual who would risk it all to help Dean.
A grin plastered on his face, Dean thanked Lydia who gave him a wink and blew him a kiss before closing the door.
“Listen, Dean?  This is sweet and all, but I don’t understand what you’re doing here.”
Castiel turned to find that the bed was jackknifed with him in the middle; the girls had found the controls.
“I offered to carry those up,” Castiel reminded him.
“Oh yah… You betcha!”
Castiel hung up as Gabriel had another outburst, backed by mad giggling, this time something about Rainbow Dash being in the pasta.  As he turned a corner in the hallway on his way back to the main desk, he spied Crowley walking in the same direction and chatting with Raphael, one of the surgeons from the fourth floor.
“Oh! That’s so odd.  For a moment, I was certain your brother was here.”
“Alright, enough stalling, dude.  Spill.”
After the initial outburst of passion, they had spent the night sitting at the little bistro table Dean had set up amongst the garden he had built for Castiel.  He had leaned back against his chest and Dean had wrapped his arms around him and they had watched the evening fog roll in over the city from the bay.  They had decided to take it slow.  This was all so new to Castiel, who had told him he had never felt that way about anyone and had never known a man intimately.  Dean wanted to respect his pace.  There was nothing he wouldn’t do for him.
"Stand up for me."
Lailah shouted, stumbling back and cradling her arm to her chest. Castiel looked back to where the soul was and saw nothing. The soul was gone.
"No more than usual," Castiel frowned at him, "but Cas, I need to talk to you."
Castiel frowned. “Then why didn’t you want to talk about him tonight?”
The three of them watched as the last bits of sunlight washed away, the stars finally coming out. They littered the clear night sky around the very visible milky way. The view was one of the main reasons he had put his stamp of approval on the house. Just close enough to town to not be a hassle but far enough to avoid what Sam had called “light pollution”. He knew, of course, that there were millions more things to see in the night sky, but his human eye would never be able to perceive it. A sinking feeling filled his gut at the thought. One more reason to feel miserable.
"Cas?"
Or visit me on twitter!
“True, Ishim.” His voice involuntarily went tight. Although it was still early, Castiel could feel his rut sparking just below his skin. It itched in a way that drove him mad, or at least madder than this stubborn alpha already made him. If it wasn't for Lilly's strong flowery pregnant omega scent that filled their hut, Castiel feared he may have given into his rage by now and fought the demanding alpha.
“I didn’t tell her everything, but I did mention Jack.”
Many of the trees were starting to shed the colorful leaves they had bared, piles of colors lining the opposite side of the road where the shoulder became over run by bushes and trees. The power lines that stood before them, as if a wall keeping the earth away from traveling humans. The lake that sat at the right, view blocked by the line of trees between him and the railroad tracks that were gradually lifting the closer they got to their destination.
“I don’t understand?” Tanya stated. “How are you here? How am I holding you?”
She kneeled down next to the tracks, hand reaching out to touch. “It’s weak. Definitely was here but it’s been a few days.”
Castiel removed his hand as the nephilim slowly turned more before walking back towards the tree line. The two angels followed silently, uncertainty pulling at Castiel’s own grace. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe the nephilim, he just wasn’t sure what to make of the new information. Jack being able to sense more than him concerned him. How was he supposed to help the nephilim navigate his powers if he didn’t know what the nephilim could sense?
Eventually Dean looked away and grabbed Castiel's coffee mug out of his hands and set it down on the counter. “Well, maybe you should lay off the coffee and take a nap?” He offered, eyes round with question as he met his gaze again.
He heard himself start to say.
He allowed himself to be pulled away and maneuvered to look her in the eyes. She caressed his cheek once again.
“You didn’t do anything, Sam.”
Once they were all the way in the kitchen, the hand still on his shoulder pulled, a sign that meant he wanted him to turn around.
With wobbly knees, he made his way to the desk chair and sat down. Awkwardly, he moved with the chair to be next to Michael then sat up straight. His cock stirred again at the suspense but wasn't fully hard yet. Michael reached into his pocket and slipped out a small bottle of what Castiel assumed was lube and popped the cap. He dribbled some over his fingers and began rubbing them together, likely to warm it up. A drop of sweat rolled down the back of Castiel's neck as he watched. In a few short seconds, those fingers would be wrapped around his cock. The first fingers, besides his own, to ever do so. He chubbed up at the thought alone, his heart now pounding in his chest.
They sat in silence for a while, both men trying to gather their thoughts; to say things out loud they never had before.
“You shouldn’t have run off like that.” He chastised the nephilim. Jack dropped his head. Looking up at the woman, Castiel gave an awkward half bow. “I apologize if he has scared you.”
Castiel turned to head back to his thinking spot just outside the clearing. The fruit in his bowl would get mushy if he didn't start actually eating them and he'd learned pretty quickly to avoid that at all costs.
"Fuck you," Dean growled.
"It's hard to explain-" Castiel paused. In a sense he knew exactly what had happened and why he had acted as he did, but in an other, what if it had all been fake? The depressed imaginations of a fallen angel grieving his son? Where could he even begin?
“Bathroom” He shouted, hoping a response would calm the man now running down the hall.
Jack didn’t have control of his powers yet and using them always came with a risk. Castiel started to fear that, if they didn’t find him soon, something may go wrong. If they could just find the soul...
Dean nodded. “Sort of. He’s a little hazy on the specifics. All he could remember was mates, three, and garden.”
The nephilim lifted a hand towards his chest. “I don’t know. It’s like I knew her.”
"Are you okay?" Dean asked, not moving an inch.
“Are you okay?” Tanya asked, hands touching her face, arms, hair, as if she was checking for scraps and bruises.
He chuckled at the grimace that fell across Sam’s face. “Well, thank god I left early then.” Shucking his boots at the front door, he headed towards the two men still sitting in the kitchen.
Okay so we're finally here! The last chapter of Part 1!
Castiel looked down at his hand. “I stubbed my toe.”
“Look, the two of you never talk about him! Jack was important to you, Cas. He was the reason you had gotten mixed up with Kelly in the first place.”
“Haley?” Castiel tried, desperate that he was wrong.
“I know, Cas.” Sam said.
Dr.Adler grinned. "Fine. Take the bitch to his knot. He can have a few more nights of fun. They don't have long anyways."
That got Castiel's attention. He looked up and met Sam's gaze. He was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes.
Jack stepped closer again. “She wants you to know that she doesn’t blame you for anything that happened. It was a medical accident and it was not your fault, no matter what he tells you.”
"Dean," Castiel's deep gravel voice soothed the remaining tension in Dean's gut. A wave of sadness washed off the alpha nearly doing him in. "Are you alright?"
“Haley?” Lailah asked.
Dean stumbled as they hauled him off the table. Fear surged through him. Anything called “The Pit” wouldn’t be promising and, after his time spent in the hell hole of a prison, he knew nothing good was about to happen. Dean tried to struggle in the guards hold as they carried him towards the door.
Castiel sighed, giving Dean a half hearted smirk. “Maybe tomorrow.” That made Dean smile.
“My daughter? Lynn?” She asked, nervousness present in her tone.
A kiss placed on his broken hand pulled him out of his thoughts.
Slowly he climbed out of the bed, grabbing his trenchcoat off the desk chair. There really wasn't any time to be sleeping; heaven was just starting to get back on its feet and the angels needed his help.
"Alright, alright." They slowly stood up, whipping their legs free of dirt. Castiel reached out his hand before Dean could walk away. Grabbing his arm, he lightly pulled the omega back around. Dean stared back in question.
Things looked strange, being red. Less detail, less life. Less distracting.
"Castiel?"
He tilted his head in confusion at Sam as Dean lightly gripped his thighs.
“Jack.” Castiel called, walking up behind him. Jack turned to look at him and frowned.
"Always, alpha." Inias purred. Castiel watched as the boy shifted and sniffed at Castiel's wrist. "You smell good."
“Leaving already, Sammy?” Dean asked, his arm wrapping around Castiel’s shoulders.
Jack nodded, deep in thought. “Did he give the angels, you, specific jobs?” He turned to look between the two angels.
Glancing over a Jack, he gripped the steering and cleared his throat; something he didn't actually need to do but did anyways. “It can be hard to lose a parent, no matter the circumstances.” He looked away as Jack made eye contact and was now watching him closely now. “Losing two must be very hard. I don't wish to upset you unnecessarily.”
The two men just sitting and watching the stars as the fire crackled in front of them. He didn't want to admit it, but Dean had been right. Knowing that Sam felt similar to him, that he wasn't alone in his feelings, it helped.
So looks like I just refuse to keep a schedule. 7 of the 8 chapters are fully complete so I guess i'm just ready to get Part 1 completed and posted.
Michael chuckled and stepped away from the door. There was nothing outwardly intimidating about him; under his plaid shirt was a white undershirt, he wore ripped dark jeans and socks with smiling pizzas on them. However, there was something about the way Michael carried himself and held Castiel’s gaze that made him want to drop to his knees and do anything Michael asked. It wasn't the first time he'd found a man attractive. Still, it was his first time feeling aroused by a man he was going to be intimate with--especially someone as ridiculously hot as this man who he had literally paid to do things to him that he’d only ever fantasized about.
Lilly nodded behind Ishim, who simply frowned. “Thank you, alpha.”
The guards took a sharp left and pulled Dean into the same room they had been ever since his heat had started. It looked like any other doctor's office, but that table in the middle of the room was far from as welcoming as his actual doctor's had been. A nurse was inside, slipping gloves on and directing the guards on where to put Dean. He barely had time to process what was happening before the guards threw him face down, legs spread, and presented onto the freezing examination table. The nurse's unfriendly hands violated him in ways he tried to convince himself was okay no matter how many times he'd gone through the examination. His legs and arms trembled uncontrollably as the nurse shoved some sort of tube up his ass and cringed at the familiar burn as they were never careful. His heat was done, it had been sometime during his and Cas’s last romp, but there was still anxiety bubbling up the longer he was stuck in the room.
Dean didn’t move or say anything for a few seconds.
Castiel swallows at the notable depth of Michael’s character, and his nerves begin to calm. "Okay."
"You gonna come, Cas?" Michael whispered right up against his ear.
Castiel sighed as he massaged his temples. The sun beat down on his shoulders through the glass dome above as the industrial fans along the perimeter pushed warm air around their small village. Branches on the trees around them swayed with the gust and leaves gently drifted down around him. Castiel always enjoyed the echoes as they filled the morning atmosphere with their symphonies. With his eyes closed, he could almost imagine he was on vacation or celebrating a birthday or anniversary, promotion, anything other than the reality itself.
“Swayze… Ghost… It’s a movie.”
“Yes.”
“Well that depends.  Is it later yet?”
“Gee, thanks for letting me know,” Dean answered with a roll of his eyes.  He pulled out the matchbook that had the address scribbled in the flap.  “This is the place,
“Oh my God, Max!” cried the girl behind the bar.
“He gave away my pants?  They were expensive!”
“Are you kidding me?  Start with THAT next time!  Come on,” Dean half laughed.
“Castiel?”
Dean laughed. “He does that.”  He moved past Charlie, walking up to Castiel and standing right in front of him holding up his left hand.  Castiel lined up his palm with Dean’s and held it there.  Dean leaned forward a bit until he could feel the gentle prickling of Castiel against his forehead.  He closed his eyes, just trying to hold on to the feel of him.
“Oh! Sorry.  Exorcisamus te…”
Much as he tried to slow the wild beat of his heart, and subdue his impetuous cock, his was finding it impossible to deny his deep desire.  He lay another kiss on Castiel’s neck, this time against the soft skin under his jaw, his five o’clock shadow making Dean’s lips tingle, just like they had when they had spent that first night together lying in bed, Castiel no more than a body of energy – a soul without a vessel.
The apartment building’s hallways smelled like all such hallways: a meeting of the worlds.  Knowing what goes on behind closed doors is not given to everyone, but a quick run through the smells of close-quartered living in an old Victorian building and you can guess fairly accurately which neighbour likes to fire up the bong, who has too many cats, who can’t be bothered to bring their trash all the way to the bins in one go, and who has a penchant for curried foods.
“He might not be crazy after all,” Castiel said smugly.
slightly off key as he watched the heat rise from his creation in delicate tendrils.
“Oh no!  Don’t look at me, bud.  You’ve been nothing but a curse on my life from the moment you popped into my space.  Like hell am I going to help you now!  Are you kidding me?”
Dean was looking right at him and Castiel focused on him too, trying to use Dean’s calm energy to soothe himself.  Before long, Jess was back, and Dean turned around to face her when Castiel pointed her out.
“What the hell?”  Dean said, the lights in the room suddenly started flickering and his beer foamed out of the can, spilling over his fingers.  He dropped it, shaking his hand as he stared at the mess on the ground.  Then the man turned, and his wide blue eyes locked with Dean’s and the air was forced from his lungs like he’d been punched in the gut.  “What’re you doing in my house?” Dean burst out angrily.
“What?  Why not?  Castiel’s gay.”
“Get out of my house!”
“I live here.  This is my place.  All of this, these are my things.  So, what are you doing here?”
“Right.”
“No problem. Good job with the garden.”
“What do you mean strange?”
Jody gave him a sympathetic smile and let the door close behind her.  Castiel turned around and took a closer look at the windowsill.  There were a few picture frames and flower arrangements and every space in between was covered in drawings and crafts all labeled with Uncle Castiel.  Some were clearly meant to be portraits of him; generic round faces with black hair and blue eyes all done in bright wax crayons.  Castiel smiled, warmed by the love of his nieces, memories of them rolling through his mind like a strange montage of family videos.  He remembered their mother with the hair like fire and their father; his brother.
“All right, but seriously, dude, even if this is all really happening, do you have any idea what you’re risking for this guy?  Come on, what the hell?”
Castiel frowned, stopping himself from asking him how he thought he would do that considering his current disembodied state, but he thought better of it, accepting that though physically it may be impossible, the desire to do it was genuine enough to give him pause.  “Okay,” he finally said, turning away from Dean to look at the view once more.
The man suddenly looked behind him at the hallway and then stepped out, holding the door partly shut and leaning out towards Dean who took a step back, surprised.
“He’s breathing!” yelled out Dean, his eyes round and his mouth agog.
Castiel turned to look at his brother for an explanation.  “It’s Dean,” Gabriel told him. “You don’t remember Dean?”
Back at the apartment, Dean pushed open the door with the number nine, pulling his key out of the lock as he looked around cautiously in case the apparition was waiting for him.  But he wasn’t.
Castiel rolled his eyes.  He felt that pang again, like he had food poisoning, only he hadn’t eaten anything on account of him being… not all there.  “What’s stopping you?  Get it out of your system and we can get back to figuring out who the hell I am.”  Dean stopped his foraging and turned, giving him a calculating look that he did not appreciate.
“Yeah, of course.  Come on in.”
“We got this!”
“I figured you’d rubber band your way back to being a pain in my ass.”
The look of pure dumfounded confusion on her face would have been funny under other circumstances, but Dean was having a hard time finding humour in anything at the moment.
“You know them!” Dean said, turning on the seat to face Castiel.  “You’ll be right there to help me.  You can tell me everything I need to do.”
“I have?” Dean asked, feeling the man’s earnestness so completely that he began to doubt himself.  How could he be sure of anything anymore?  Wasn’t what the man was saying just as likely as him having conjured him out of some dark recess of his mind?
Dean couldn’t even bring himself to think the word it was so outrageous, and yet, hadn’t he seen it with his own two eyes?
After Dean ripped open the man’s shirt, sending buttons flying with his stiff movements, Castiel guided him through a basic examination of his chest, asking him questions.
It was Castiel’s turn to look surprised.  Blood?  Why would he have blood on his suits?  Castiel looked down at himself, his blue suit as pristine as if he’d just put it on, even though he could no longer remember wearing anything else.  His trench coat had no visible stains on it either.  Blood?
“Go away!  This is just a dream,” Dean whined between the pillow and the mattress feeling like his head was going to burst.
“And what if I hadn’t?  What if I had stayed stuck back there?”
Fear gripped Dean as he looked down and realized that it was true, there was nothing left of the breathing apparatus that had been forcing air into Castiel’s lungs.  In his attempt to save him, he had unplugged him as surely as if Crowley had done it.  He felt his heart squeezed, and he could barely breathe.
“You are clearly in the middle of a psychotic break.  You’ve created this fantasy in which you have rented an apartment that in fact belongs to someone else.”
“I’m not good at this stuff, okay?” Dean said, defensively.  “What do you want me to say?”
Castiel frowned at him, but before he could say anything, Dean raised his fist and knocked on the next door.  When had they left the other one?  Almost immediately, they heard the bolt slide free in a sharp clunk.  The man didn’t open his door completely, though, leaving the chain latch on and glaring at Dean through the crack sizing him up from toes to scalp.  “I’m not telling you anything unless you got a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue, son.”  And the door was slammed closed.
Dean smiled as he came to stand beside him at the centre of the spiral.  “I made this.”  Castiel turned his wonder-filled eyes on Dean as he continued.  “You asked what I was like… before.  This is what I did.” Dean gestured with his arm wide to the whole of the carefully planned garden.  “I was a landscape architect.  Even had my own company for a while.”
He was surrounded by people and yet had never felt so completely alone.
“I’m friends with his brother, Gabe.  We were kids together.”
Castiel started walking back out to the street, but Dean stopped him. “Are we just leaving him like this?”  Dean was gesturing towards the assembled group of bystanders still standing around the man with the hole in his chest.
“I wasn’t always like this, you know,” Dean added after a moment, his face settling back into looking forlorn.
Castiel’s eyes bore into him and he nearly forgot to breathe from the intensity of that stare.  It went so much further than just looking into his eyes, it felt like Castiel was looking into his soul and it was setting off all sorts of delightful signals.  It was terrifying.  It was wonderful.  “If I could right now, I’d kiss you,” Dean said, the moment for half-truths and embarrassment long past and he wanted, more than anything, for Castiel to be open and honest with him too.
Castiel stopped and turned back fixing the man on the window seat with renewed attention while Dean’s eyebrows scaled his forehead.  “What else do the cards say?” he asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
With a determined set of his jaw and a frown in place, Castiel raised his hand and stuck it through Dean’s head.  His reaction was instant as he stood up from his stool swatting at him like he could bat away his hand.  Castiel jabbed at him again, ignoring the numb tingle in his arm as it passed right through Dean again.
Dean grabbed a burgundy shirt from the closet and threw it on over his black t-shirt, One arm through, he struggled with the other for a moment as he said, as calmly as one would ask to pass the butter, “I’m gonna steal your body.”
Castiel looked up to see the man with the rich brown hair and neatly trimmed beard who ran the hospital.  As he turned his light blue eyes towards them, Castiel noticed Crowley squaring his shoulders, a self-important smirk on his face.  Castiel stood beside him, shoulder to shoulder.  Dinner would have to wait; he would not be seen stepping out when lives were at stake.  Dr. Shurley looked at them both in turn, his sharp eyes veiled, revealing no hint of emotion or thought.
