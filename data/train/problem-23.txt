?! Oh good gracious... But that's never... So many! All in one pregnancy! Oh, my dears..." she beamed at them, pressing her hand on Sherlock's forearm in congratulations, knowing better than to touch a pregnant Omega without his Alpha's permission. John saw the knowing look in her eyes and blushed a little deeper. "We still want to keep renting Baker Street, but obviously with this many babies we'll need to move to a larger home. We'll keep Baker Street as our bolthole and crash pad, and of course you'll be welcome to come and visit us whenever you like," he smiled warmly as he reassured her. "We're going to tell everyone else today, so please don't tell Mrs Turner until we get back, alright?" he said sternly but with obvious affection. She nodded her agreement, dumbstruck by the sheer number of pups Sherlock had put in him.
madhouse." He snuggled further in to Sherlock's warmth, stretching and shifting to encourage his Alpha's hands to pet and stroke him. "You love me like this, don't you?" he whispered softly, kissing his neck. "So obviously fresh from birthing a large litter. Already beginning to prepare for the next ones. I'll swell quickly, with triplets... I'll be showing again in three months. But this time... please, no forced swelling? I want the full nine months with these ones... On the plus side, you'll have longer to worship my big, round belly," he added seductively, suckling Sherlock's scent gland before pillowing his head on Sherlock's chest. "I'm sleeping like this," he declared obstinately, making himself comfortable.
," he snarled, and with the final declaration, shoved his knot hard into the Omega, shuddering and moaning as he felt John clench around him, his partner's body milking the knot as Sherlock spurted hard, filling him.
he pushed through the bond,
the auburn-haired pup insisted, looking pleadingly at his astonished uncle. "
He kissed his mate and moved back behind him, returning to parting the Omega's tender hole wide with his fingers.
John gasped softly in surprise as Sherlock revealed it was the exact blanket he'd coveted, grinning and nuzzling his mate in thanks. He leant against Sherlock as he opened the next gift, pleased by the squashy texture, and his breath hitched as the jumpers came into view - creamy cable-knits, ones he'd be able to wear as he grew. His hands trembled slightly and his eyes grew wet as he thought of how upset he'd been that his body would change out of all recognition, despite how much he loved the pups and his Alpha; Sherlock had provided him with something that would give him a point of constancy, he'd still look like himself instead of simply an enormously pregnant Omega. He burst into happy, noisy tears and pushed against Sherlock, hiding his face in his Alpha's neck as he sobbed and rubbed his mate's chest submissively, gripping the jumpers tightly with his free hand.
Sherlock quietly considered the comment as he continued to pet his mate, purring lowly at John's obvious pleasure and comfort. "I suppose I am," he murmured, a soft smile playing across his features as he observed his Omega. Lestrade was completely right; with John, the Alpha was calm, focused, peaceful. There was no need to distract himself, or 'climb the walls,' or deduce the background of every little thing in sight. There was just John. John and their pups. And that was more than enough. The Alpha's purring increased in volume as he leaned down to kiss his mate.
, the Alpha hummed quietly, disappointed at the sudden loss if the more glorious reveal he'd anticipated, when the fabric of the gown finally gave way from the sheer size and motion of the Omega's teats, and pinged back to frame them pornographically. But John on top of him now could only have looked more like an Omega porn star if he'd been heavily collared. The Alpha wanted nothing more than to take him, to watch him moan and writhe, his breasts pressing heavily against Sherlock's flat chest - he couldn't help but hesitate, his heart sinking with guilt.
John crooned as Sherlock cupped his bump, wriggling happily in his lap, humming in agreement at Sherlock's plan. "We can give you the shortlist of places we're looking at," he added. "We're looking at some tomorrow. We might also need some assistance smoothing out any... Issues... With planning permission, since we may need to convert some rooms into a large nursery, that sort of thing." He nodded and took his leave, starting to get a little cold since he was still naked. He went and dressed himself, choosing a jumper which showed off his bump, and slipped into his tracksuit bottoms, rejoining them and going straight back to Sherlock's lap, nuzzling his mate. He tuned out as the Alphas talked, humming vaguely as Mycroft left. Wordlessly he took Sherlock's hand and led him to the bedroom, hooking up the scanner. More of the pups were moving and he wanted his mate to see. He slicked his belly with the gel and pressed the wand to his stomach, showing him the first pup that had moved, waving its little arms. One of its siblings had joined in, another was kicking its legs a little. He couldn't wait until he found a nest and could find out how many boys and girls they were having. "Look at them," he sighed happily. "Our pups. Starting to move already..."
John emerged from his burrow of Sherlock's shoulder as he recognised the scent of his pack Alpha and clung to Sherlock, mewling loudly for attention.
Feeling a stab of discomforting emanating from his sibling, the young Alpha peeked up from his parent. "My?" he asked softly.
John grabbed his breasts and squeezed them hard, causing twin jets of creamy milk to spray all over them both, splashing onto Sherlock's chest. He grinned cheekily and dipped a hand into the cushions, bringing out the camera he'd hidden there, pressing it into his Alpha's hands. He could feel his mate's erection pressing wetly between his cheeks and lifted his hips, impaling himself on it as he dropped back down and moaning slightly as he began to bounce on it. "Ohhhh. Sherlock... So big... So full..." he teased his own nipples, leaking more milk, smearing it over his perky breasts until they glistened, kneading them until they were leaking steadily, soaking his belly too. "Ah... Feel so
"How's your head, love?" John enquired , brushing some stray curls off his mate's forehead.
Sherlock purred deeply.
A small, niggling feeling in the back of his mind reminded Sherlock he was supposed to roll on a condom before lying with his mate, but the Alpha hesitated. His Omega had just given him an incredible litter of thirteen; why not breed him again? He growled low in his throat. He could have his mate swollen with another litter in no time, his belly already big and round by the time the pups were hardly three months old. To see his Omega waddling again, so heavily pregnant while taking care of his litter of thirteen already... His mate was so fertile yet. They had a pack with enough adults to help care for their pups. The Alpha was not struggling to provide. There was no reason he shouldn't fill the Omega again.
, his Alpha, the father of his babies, who would keep him full of pups and destroy anyone who dared to touch him. He was helpless beneath his husband, his guileless expression and parted lips begging his mate wordlessly
... he breathed, as he watched John's cheeks flush and his pupils dilate wide; if they had been sitting on the bed, the Omega would have already leaked a large puddle on the sheets.
Sherlock gave his brother one last thunderous glare before offering John his arm and departing. It had taken all his self-control not to lunge at his brother for the words he had said, and all the unspoken ones he'd implied - but John had taken the reins so well, his cleverness and veiled insults better than anything Sherlock had come up with. He was so proud of his Omega's capability and evenness. "
Sherlock kept up a low, steady purr, beginning to lick John's cheek gently, lovingly cleaning the sweat from his mate. He paused to gaze down at his Omega spread out underneath him, his eyes roaming adoringly over the mounds of John's breasts and the heavy swell of his belly, taking in his position. He smiled and began to rub John's rounded abdomen in large circles, moving slowly inside the Omega as he did so. He lavished John with attention, making sure to flood the bond with his care.
John leaned back into Sherlock, loving how protective and possessive he was being. He made a small hum of agreement at Sherlock's declaration, his gaze daring them to say another word against his Alpha. He was immensely pleased when they both left. He turned his head slightly to nuzzle Sherlock's cheek. "Didn't you have some answers for Lestrade?" he reminded gently, still clenching his fists, the urge to rub his belly strong after his Alpha's display.
was not his idea of a pleasant afternoon - but he was getting used to having friends, and was glad of Lestrade's company. The pack Alpha managed a smile and a nod, and the two Alphas stepped out into the sunshine together.
that on any person, it can only come from the strength of a bond, the body sensing an absolutely nurturing Alpha. It can only come from love, which, despite what you may think, is a concept I well understand when it comes to John."
, Sherlock growled suddenly,
Sherlock knelt behind him and regarded him darkly, the Alpha's enormous cock jutting obscenely from between his legs, fat and dripping precome. He stroked himself languidly with one hand, considering his mate in front of him, still not in any hurry to carry out his intention. "I did just say," he murmured so John could hear him, "that you were entirely too polite, for a whore. You haven't done much to rectify that." He continued to touch himself, shifting just a little so John could see the gigantic cock that wasn't inside him. "I want to know you want it, Omega," he said, cupping his balls and moaning softly, "I want to
"I'm glad we're doing things in the wrong order," he grinned knowingly. "I'm
"I wanna be a painter," Viola said thoughtfully, which drew an excited start from her brother. "I wanna draw!" Benedict chimed, nodding his head, "I wanna draw story books! With knights an' cassles!"
John keened and writhed, clenching around his Alpha, working his internal muscles as if he was trying to force his mate's cock out of his slick hole.
"Yours," John agreed softly, kissing his mate's lips. He rolled his hips back against Sherlock's, dipping his head to kiss and lick at his chest. "I love it when you claim me like that... Hearing you say
When Catherine drew back, John invited Beatrice forward, but she took only a few mouthfuls before drawing back; she wanted to be part of the shared experience, but did not feel the need for reassurance, it was enough for her to be allowed to caress his belly, to see both her sons happy and fulfilled. Mycroft took her place, wanting more now that he knew he would not be chased away for taking longer than absolutely necessary. He latched on with a soft sigh, feeling relaxed, the milk sweet against his tongue. Remington finally finished nursing, secure and happy, and joined the two female Omegas in caressing and kissing John's belly, worshipping his enormous stomach as Lestrade took his place. John mewled softly; the two Alphas suckled more strongly than any of the Omegas had, they suckled him like Sherlock did, and combined with the loving attentions to his belly and his mate's cock up his arse, he needed movement. He rocked his hips more insistently, pushing his lust through the bond. He wrapped his arms around the two Alphas' shoulders, holding them as they nursed, and tilted his head back to kiss and lick his Alpha's jaw, whimpering a little.
John tilted his head up to gaze at his mate, smiling adoringly at him, purring, seeking kisses as he clenched around his knot.
The Omega crooned to his mate, hushing and reassuring and praising, as the Alpha suckled meekly. He wiped the tears away, rocking him, holding him, sending love and forgiveness through their bond. When the first breast was empty he transferred Sherlock across to the other and smiled encouragingly as he latched on. "That's it love, good boy," he murmured softly, stroking his hair. "No need to be sad. You're not a bad Alpha, you love me too much for that to be true. You haven't even questioned or protested my decision that we'll sleep in our bedroom, have you? Even though it's your right as my Alpha to demand that we sleep in the nest? You'd do anything for me Sherlock, we both know that. You love me too much to want to risk upsetting me by saying we'll sleep in the nest, even though that's what you want. I couldn't ask for a better Alpha. Yes, you got a little rough, but I'm built to take that. I know you needed to claim me, I
Sherlock took the collar, but first placed his other hand in John's hair, stroking it with reverence. He purred lowly, looking into the Omega's eyes. "You... are the most perfect, most loving, most gorgeous Omega I have ever laid eyes on," he said, his tone full of an infinite tenderness, "And I count myself so
"It might, but remember that not every pregnancy has every complication," he smiled affectionately. "Want to have a read while I book us dinner? And see if I can find a decent, presentable outfit?" He kissed his Alpha's nose and went to look through his wardrobe, choosing a roomy plum-coloured paternity shirt and navy trousers cut to accommodate his large belly. It flattered his figure without being clingy or revealing, and he thought Sherlock would approve. He set them aside for later and booked them a table at Angelo's, sauntering back through to the lounge to snuggle with his Alpha. "Found enough data?" he smiled, kissing his forehead.
, to be floating like this on a cloud of his Alpha's approval. He'd waited so long, been so ready for his orgasm that he didn't seem able to stop; he writhed and thrashed on his mate's cock, his screams subsiding into breathy keening sighs as it finally began to subside.
John smiled encouragingly. "You're a natural with them," he said kindly, "you'll make a great mother. Bit of advice, though? Don't rush into it. Sherlock and I have a great relationship, and we respect each other, because we both know who we are - I am my own person, I don't just do whatever he wants. Being an Alpha doesn't make him a god, we're equals, and love based on equality and respect is the best feeling in the world." He looked carefully at Remington, wanting to see if the boy understood the point he was making. "You're still so young - you've got so much time to start a family. The world is a huge, exciting place - take some time to explore it, find out who you are, discover what you want, test your limits. You could go to university, if you wanted, or train to be a chef or a pilot or a plumber or a hairdresser or anything at all you like - and you don't need an Alpha for any of that. Before Sherlock, I never had an Alpha - I dated Betas, found my limits, what I liked and didn't like in a relationship. Do you know what you'd
, he murmured seductively though the bond,
"It's gorgeous," Sherlock replied gently, "you have marks, yes, but they look beautiful on you - they show off the contour of your belly just so." He could hear the apprehension in his mate's voice, but didn't see what he knew John feared. "They're pink, not red. Pretty. Even if they were red they'd be pretty. And there aren't too many. Don't be so nervous, my Omega. You look amazing. When we get out of bed, I'll show you in the mirror just how much." His fingers traced lovingly over the pinkish lines, following their progress under the curve of John's gravid abdomen.
John giggled playfully and clenched around him, still in his Omega but much more coherent. "You like it? Got it for you. Know you like being able to see my rosy nipples dripping with milk for you, know you like having access to my tight wet hole all the time... Mmm, yes... oh, my Alpha, feels so good, oh..." He writhed decadently, grinning wickedly at the sensation of the massive hard cock impaling him. His breathing grew louder, giving little keening whines, starting to mewl for his mate to come inside him, take his pleasure. He twisted his head to lick Sherlock's jaw and nuzzle him, utterly submissive and Omega, totally contented and eager for his Alpha's pleasure, shuddering as his attentions brought him to his own.
he hummed,
(See the end of the chapter for
Remington lifted the lid timidly, his gaze continually flickering between the gift and his half-brother, as if he were afraid it was a trick and Mycroft's gentleness would suddenly to anger. But Mycroft remained kind, and the bracelet was just as beautiful of a green as the collar. Remington thought back to Lestrade's words again, of how his pack had gotten him a job, and more respect. Remington felt it could do that for him, too, and promise any interested Alpha - if, maybe, there was one out there - that he had family who would be supportive and who would help care for their pups if he was bred. He lifted the leather slowly from its silken pillow and offered it to Mycroft, submissively holding out his wrist for the pack leader to fasten on the token.
Mycroft snarled as Siger lunged again, parrying the blow and finally drawing first blood with his next attack. He hissed in triumph as Siger bellowed in rage and shock, a trickle of blood appearing on the older Alpha's neck. "First blood," the ginger Alpha snarled. "Do you submit, or shall we continue?"
"You naughty girl," Mycroft said smoothly, "trying to rile up your Alpha... you know exactly what it does to me, seeing you so big with my children." Completely in control, he walked with a perfectly measured stride over to his mate. "I think I'll have to tease you a little as payback, darling." He tugged off her trousers and pants and flung them aside. "Lean back for me, my love." Persephone keened softly and obeyed, shivering a little as Mycroft sank to his knees in one smooth motion and began covering her sex in open-mouthed kisses. "I want to hear you, my treasure. Let me hear those beautiful noises you make for me," he murmured, smoothing his hands over her thighs. His cock pulsed, struggling against the confines of his trousers, but he ignored it in favour of lapping hungrily at his Omega's delicious juices.
he rumbled softly,
"All sorted," Lestrade said cheerfully. "Are you two alright now?" He looked at them fondly, paternally, visibly relaxed to see them nesting, scented and safe.
he growled, willing John's body to feel the sensations he was projecting,
"So did we," Sherlock answered with a smile, inwardly a bit surprised by the ease and truth of the statement. He placed a soft kiss on Enora's head as he rubbed slow, soothing circles over her back. "I'm glad you came - both of you." He stood to help show them out, keeping the pup tucked lovingly close, minding her every movement as if he'd been made just to be her father. "Please, do let us know when you're free again. We'll set another date - and perhaps someday a play date, after these next pups are born," he said, smiling at them both.
was suffering until I was sure I could beat him. I did what I thought was right, but I - I am so sorry." By the time he finished speaking his cheeks were wet with tears and he turned his face away, ashamed, his chest heaving with the effort of holding back the sobs that wanted to come. He
Sherlock finished filling the kettle in the sink, closing the lid and placing it on its electric base before flipping a switch to set it to boiling. His robe hung open - thrown on as a second thought, since the flat was a little chilly - the part in the material exposing a large swath of his pale, naked body beneath. He set out two mugs, and turned an ear towards the bedroom. John had been sleeping significantly more lately, the Omega's body adjusting to carrying the thirteen children had put in him; Sherlock had slipped out of bed as quietly as possible several hours earlier, letting his mate continue to rest.
Mrs Hudson, who had absented herself when Sherlock had emerged, bustled back through with a large tray laden with a fresh pot of coffee, more tea, and a small mountain of cupcakes Remington had baked with the aid of Beatrice and his mother. John perked up at the smell and sat obediently still in Sherlock's lap, hoping to be offered one, but making no move to take one without his Alpha's approval.
"Good," John groaned, hissing with pleasure as his Alpha entered him. "We won't always agree about everything, and I won't always do what you want unless it's an order... Sometimes I'll do things you don't want me to do because
Sherlock inhaled sharply, looking to the pup that could have been John's double in miniature. He set down a gleeful Enora, who was more engrossed in the squashiness of her blue foam block than in her father's attentions. "Mama," Blake whined as Sherlock lifted him. He kicked his legs unhappily at his Alpha parent, beginning to fuss more loudly.
A deep blush spread across the Alpha's cheeks and chest, his hormones surging just at the thought. Sherlock pressed his hands to his mate's round belly, growling in pleasure as he felt John contract. His already erect cock had grown harder and larger. It throbbed between John's legs as he pressed himself against his Omega, clear fluid leaking from the tip. "I want you pregnant all the time," he groaned, "You won't get more than a few minutes' break between litters, I can assure you." He rocked his hips, making the motions of mounting his mate. "I'll take you at the first faint scent of your heat, pound into you to make it come on faster until you're an animal for me, thinking of nothing but my cock, pleading for more of my pups to make you swell out again." He could feel John's belly tighten harder, grinning at the low moan it squeezed from the Omega. His hands rubbed and caressed his mate's oblong middle, providing what little they could in the way of relief. "I'll pound into you so hard you won't be able to form words to beg for more, and when I plug you with my knot, it will be so huge you'll think you're whelping again. And I won't stop. I'll knot you over and over, even when I know you've been bred, until your womb is full with my pups and your belly swollen with my seed." He groaned when John howled at the next contraction. "These pups are far larger than the first," he purred, "And you're more lucid. You're going to be begging to get them out once you begin whelping in earnest." He felt the lowest curve of John's middle and grinned, knowing full well the other side of Omega labour. "You'll also be begging for it never to stop."
A faint pressure against his hand, a small flutter against John's womb. And then another. And another. The Alpha gasped and groaned, and with one hard thrust his knot had breached John's entrance and he was filling the Omega completely. His fingers still splayed over John's gravid middle, he could feel their children shifting excitedly inside his mate, their movements feeling like small vibrations under his hands. He shuddered, feeling proud and overwhelmed, moaning lowly as his cock continued to pulse and spill inside John. "Oh Christ, John, my Omega- I can feel them- so many I've put in you- so full of my pups--" He peppered the skin of the Omega's back with kisses as he rocked them together. "Mine. Such a good Omega. Love you."
"Then see the bridge we shall," Sherlock smiled easily, breathing a sigh of relief as he relaxed after the pressure of making conversation. It had been difficult to get by without his mate's social graces - just as it had been difficult at uni without Victor by his side. It would take time to regain his old comfort with the other Omega again - things had changed so much between them; he'd need to find his footing again. But the fact that he'd allowed himself moments of vulnerability with his old friend spoke volumes. He nuzzled John as the procession began to move forward once more, "Since Iris has never seen the bridge before, I rather think it's Mum who's looking forward to that portion of our journey."
Sherlock groaned loudly, resisting the urge to thrust into his Omega, letting John work both of them to another climax. His hands worked the lotion over John's taut skin, slicking the enormous mound. He licked his lips and moaned luxuriously as he watched his mate ride him, round enough that he was beginning to look overdue with one baby, his breasts beginning to leak thick, creamy streams of milk between his fingers as he squeezed them sensuously. "Rub your belly," the Alpha commanded darkly, his hands moving to John's hips, thumbs resting in the curve between the Omega's gravid stomach and his widened pelvis. "I want to see you completely in your Omega- I want to know what it looks like when you can't stop holding your belly, when your only thoughts are about growing large with my pups and how much you want my gigantic Alpha cock. I want you to come just from touching yourself and displaying yourself to me, thinking about how many pups I've stuffed in your womb, how helpless and big you're going to become, how you're going to lie on this bed like an animal, lowing and panting and begging for me to tug them out of you as you birth one after another, after another..."
The dark-haired Alpha purred deeply at his Omega's breast, releasing John's nipple with a soft grunt to turn to the detective inspector. Keeping one hand on John's form, he wrapped an arm around Lestrade's shoulders, pulling him closer to rest his head affectionately above Remington's on the grey-haired Alpha's chest. He nuzzled the older man, giving a soft lick to his collar bone before rubbing his head under his chin as a pup would do to their father. Sherlock purred louder as he felt Lestrade's large hand carding through his curls, accepting the gesture.
"What, no congratulations from my brother-in-law?" John smirked, loving the jealousy on Mycroft's face, knowing it would please Sherlock and imagining how much sweeter it would be when he found out John was carrying thirteen of Sherlock's babies. He waited for Mycroft's next snide remark, suddenly determined to irritate him as much as possible.
There was no nervousness from him this time; he watched approvingly as Sherlock attached an emerald-stickered tag reading
John sighed, sensing he'd need to visit the subject again; he knew their marriage wouldn't work if Sherlock continually pushed his own wants and desires aside, made a martyr of himself to please the Omega - it would only lead to Sherlock resenting him, and he'd fallen in love with the sulky, impossible, fiery detective, exactly as he was, John didn't need to be pandered to in order to be happy. Now wasn't the time to push it, though, so he spread his legs wider, opening himself completely and without reservation for Sherlock, and moaned into the kiss as he felt the Alpha's enormous cock slowly breach him.
he asked, deferring to his mate.
Felix hummed at his mother's closeness and reached out a chubby hand to grasp John's sandy hair, trying to pet it. John chuckled and kissed his son's arm, relaxing slowly.
... he said,  beginning to pant lightly as his hand moved faster over his cock. He would keep that in mind for later.
make it tonight because he's not had to do overtime," John smiled at his mate reassuringly. "So Papa Greg and Auntie Molly will be here to spoil you rotten as well! Lucky babies..."
, he growled, picking up the leash from where it lay half-forgotten on the duvet. He stroked the braided leather in his palm, admiring it for a moment before clipping it deftly to the front of his Omega's collar. He felt another surge of power blaze though him.
Sherlock was at first tempted to immediately call his Omega back, but his expression softened as he regarded his old friend. He returned a small smile. "Who would have thought?" he said quietly. "It suits you as well, I believe. Your body language when you regard your partner and your soon-to-be four happy children tell me you've found a worthy bondmate - though it doesn't take a detective to deduce that. Anyone with proper vision and a basic knowledge of human behaviour could see it. You've fared well."
. In the nest John stirred sleepily, humming a little and calling for his mate through their bond. He had not yet fully woken, but it had become a reflex as the days passed and his belly grew larger; he needed to know his Alpha was nearby.
John smirked, thrilled he was pleasing his Alpha so well. He moaned in agreement, sending vibrations up his shaft, bobbing his head a little faster and caressing his balls again, wetting a finger and teasing it across his perineum and hole, pumping his other hand in time with his mouth. He arched decadently, pushing the curve of his bump against Sherlock's calf so he could feel the full shape of it, his small cock rubbing him beneath it. He could hear Sherlock's gasps and growls, hoping evilly that he was still on the phone making his brother uncomfortable. He peeked up at him, giving him an absolutely filthy wink as he swiped his tongue over his fat cockhead again, swallowing as much of him as possible and hollowing his cheeks, bobbing fast, pulling off to let Sherlock watch him lick every inch of him before taking him in his mouth again, encouraging him towards his pleasure, loving the pleasured sounds his Alpha was making.
"I'm ordering you not to restrain yourself. Your choice is your own," the Alpha rumbled, stroking harder, his scent becoming even more irresistible as he caught a whiff of the Omega's increasing arousal. A part of John's plea cut through the haze, however, and Sherlock blinked in confusion. "Why on earth would I hate you?" he asked slowly, before dismissing the matter and increasing his pace, making pleasured noises for John to hear.
, he added softly, boldly propping himself up on one elbow so he could steal a long, slow kiss from his Alpha,
John whimpered as quietly as possible and clutched at Sherlock's coat, beginning to sag a little under the weight of his huge belly. The hostess slipped into the manager's office briefly to hang Mycroft's jacket and leave his cufflinks somewhere safe, bringing back a chair for John, unnoticed by the two Alphas. John sank onto it gratefully, clinging to Sherlock's hand as he pressed his face into his mate's side, watching nervously as Anthea handed her employer his own umbrella and Mycroft withdrew the shining sword.
"Thank you," Molly was whispering again. "For - for making me feel better. You can let - you don't have to - " she trailed off and bit her lip. Uncertainty and need rolled off her in gentle waves, her scent vulnerable, and the truth was she didn't really want to let go; it felt so lovely just to be holding hands, to feel connected, to feel like an Alpha wanted to touch her.
Sherlock had whined softly when John took care of the afterbirth and cleaning all on his own; he tended happily to Enora, but also wished he were the one taking care of his weary mate. Now, his heart swelled further with pride as he watched over his large family. The Alpha purred deeply, the vibration of it rumbling through the Omega as well. The sight of John's swollen, tender entrance presented to him pleased him immensely, and only caused his purrs to drop another register, the low sound filling the nest with a steady hum. Sherlock's hands snaked around John's middle to rub the soft, pudgy flesh of his Omega's belly lovingly, the pounds of baby weight the last evidence of how gigantic John's belly had previously been.
Mycroft instantly pressed his advantage, stepping forward as he pushed the tip of his sword into the soft skin of Siger's throat, his chest heaving, sweat beaded on his brow, his elbow raised behind it and ready to drive the blade home. "On your knees," he growled, his eyes cold in his triumph. There was a long pause, but slowly the grey-haired Alpha complied. "To the death, indeed?" He paused, his sword still pressing against his sire's jugular vein, catching the hatred and haughty pride in his eyes. "I think not. I want you to live with your shame," he spat, "I want you to live with your defeat. You will stay on your knees until I have left, then you may do as you wish. You will never come near any member of
John emerged fully dressed and no longer looking quite so obviously well-shagged. He kissed Sherlock on the cheek and hesitated, noticing his dark expression. "I know you don't like it, love, but we need as much money as we can get," he pointed out gently. "Besides, I've been a doctor for years, I've got a very strong immune system because I've been exposed to so much illness already. The babies won't get hurt, I promise. It'll only be another couple of months anyway and then I'll be so pregnant I won't be able to move around as easily and I'll have to stop working. Of course... it is your right as my Alpha to insist that I stop, but until you do that I'm going to keep working as long as I can."
and flash corresponding to each brush of their lips. Close-up shots were taken, too, of their hands together, and of their hands closed over John's swollen belly, wedding rings clearly visible and gleaming. By the end of the whole thing, there were plenty of outtakes  - bumped noses, pinched bums, and a particularly memorable moment in which the photographer had unsuspectingly asked them to "say anything," for a particular shot, and Sherlock had retorted with something inaudible to the crew, but which had the couple doubled over in giggles for a full five minutes afterwards.
John looked up when he heard the moan and purred loudly to greet his mate. His eyes dropped to the bowl when he caught the scent of the strawberries and he licked his lips, smiled, gave a soft moan of want. His hands never stopped moving over his belly, rubbing loving circles into the flesh he could still reach. His purring grew louder as Sherlock gingerly moved towards him, constricted by his very tight trousers and desire not to spill any of the fruit, and as soon as he could he nuzzled his Alpha, purring as loudly as possible, rubbing his cheek against his neck. His head was pleasantly swimming, his Alpha's pheromones thick in the air, surrounding him wonderfully; he began peppering kisses along his mate's neck and jaw, whimpering submissively to ask for the strawberries. He had fought his Omega for so long that he had dropped into it deeply, barely capable of forming anything so evolved as speech. The small beads of milk on his nipples grew larger, quivering and ready to drip, his mate's proximity boosting his production to please the Alpha. John mewed quietly and butted his face against his mate again, rubbing and purring, begging without words.
Sherlock swallowed and nodded. "Yes, quite close in fact." He fidgeted a bit, drumming his gloved fingers inside his coat pockets as he tried to find his words. Deducing someone was second nature, and conversation with John was easy. It had been easy with Victor, too, all those years ago. But asking for something so horribly
moving again, he purred, lapping Sherlock's scent gland.
Sherlock kept his partner at a small distance, not allowing too much contact just yet. He had a thorough idea of what he wanted, of
The Alpha placed a soft kiss on his mate's cheek, wrapping one arm around John to cuddle him close, stroking the Omega's stuffed belly with the other.
but feeling that the question was entirely too infantile.
"Yes, yours," John whimpered, mewling happily at the praise. He began panting lightly as Sherlock fucked him, whining breathily, gripping the sides of the tub. "Oh, Sherlock... ngh, can you feel that resistance when you bottom out?" He licked his lips, his panting increasing in pace. "That's this big belly you've given me being pressed into the floor of the tub," he moaned happily. "Just a little, with every thrust... oh, feels good," he cried out softly, rocking back against him. "Fuck, yes, that's it,
John closed his eyes and breathed slowly through his nose. He knew Sherlock hadn't wanted to let him go. He knew he'd let him because he sensed his sadness through their bond, and wanted to give him space. He knew that it had grated on his Alpha instincts to let his pregnant Omega go shopping alone, and yet he'd done it anyway to make John feel like he had freedom and choice. If that didn't prove how much Sherlock loved him, the thirteen pups in his belly certainly did. He stroked the bump and smiled softly to himself. Sherlock might never have stepped forward to claim him openly, but... in his position, he didn't know if he'd have done anything different. Sherlock was right; the risk of making an unwanted advance that might drive the other away was too great to overcome from a cold start. There would always have been a trigger. He thought intently about Sherlock, trying to send him a wave of love and acceptance and happiness through their bond.
, but tinged with sadness that Sherlock would never have claimed him properly. He stroked his bump, felt their pups moving, real tangible proof of their love in his belly, and felt a rush of gratitude that they were there at all.
It's a little over four weeks to go until Christmas day... so have some Johnlock quiet time Christmas to get you into the festive spirit :D The afternoon is being written at the moment so please don't hate us too much for the wait for the next instalment! <3
"Mmm, you keep saying that," Sherlock hummed, "but I think it's wonderful." He wrapped his arms around his mate's soft waist, wondering if it was his imagination or if John felt just a little bit plumper already, his womb thickening and swelling and his body filling out in preparation for the growth of the triplets. "And it's going to be even more wonderful when you give me these next three, and with each successive birth after that," he added, pressing light kisses to his mate's face. One hand trailed down his Omega's back to cup John's plump arse, and Sherlock purred in satisfaction. He loved John like this, soft and full; he hoped his mate would keep the baby weight - though at least for this pregnancy, John did not have much choice. Mothering thirteen pups as he swelled with another litter did not leave much opportunity for exercise.
The criminal barely had a split second to react - the moment he thought to reach for the gun he was tackled off the bed, the enraged Alpha barrelling into him at full speed with an unearthly roar. Lestrade had not fully succeeded in restoring Sherlock's wits; at the DI's request, the detective had at least removed his shoes for a silent entry, and agreed to hold himself long enough to formulate a plan of attack. He'd nearly lost his friend the second Sherlock heard Moriarty's voice; it was only a well-timed hand over the mouth that had kept a loud snarl from tearing from the young Alpha's throat, though the Detective Inspector had paid with a fresh wound in the shape of Sherlock's canines. He himself had opened the door just a crack, just in time to clearly hear the comment about the injection, and to watch as the criminal set the gun upon the chair. He'd made the detective wait another few seconds before setting him loose; it was the best opportunity they would get. Whatever happened next was in Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock suckled needily, making soft, eager sounds around John's nipples as he nursed. But something wasn't right, he felt; his big brother was still aching. "My," he beckoned quietly, latching off for a brief moment and tugging on the pack leader's sleeve. Neither of them could have the comfort of nursing from their mother again, but he could share the soothing benefits of suckling from his own Omega instead. He cupped one of John's breasts invitingly, squeezing to begin a trickle of milk for the pack Alpha. "Come. We can share."
Giving another plaintive moan of pretend pain, John bucked his hips and whimpered gently. He allowed himself to slip further into his Omega state, calling up the memory of his labour with their first litter; he sent his feelings and sensations from the birth through the bond, almost able to feel the pup slip into the birth canal, heavy and low inside him, opening him wide as he grunted and strained for his Alpha.
John pushed back, purring and nuzzling his hair.
"Mmm, yes, you're so round, my Omega, so gorgeously big. You've been so good for me, now you deserve all the attention I'm going to give you," Sherlock's Alpha was not far beneath the thinning veil of his rational mind, and he could feel it coming to the fore as he saw nothing but Omega in front of him, wanting his approval and his cock, swollen gorgeously full with his pups at his command. It was immensely difficult not to lay his mate on the ground right there and mount him while he pushed his belly into the Alpha's hands. "You'll need water first," he said huskily, his eyes dark as he greedily cupped and stroked the swollen flesh, "And you should finish my portion of food. You and our pups need the sustenance." He smeared the new milk around John's breasts and over the curve of his stomach, making the taut skin glisten and shine, the scent of pregnant Omega heavy in the air and growing stronger by the minute. Dipping down to press a kiss to the farthest curve of John's round belly, the Alpha scooped his Omega up in one smooth motion, easily carrying him across the kitchen and through the door of their bedroom. He laid the gravid man on the bed gently, pressing a kiss to his forehead and leaving him whining as he went to retrieve the leftover takeaway, a glass of water, and the bottle of special lotion. "Eat. Drink," he commanded when he returned, handing the meal to his Omega and cracking open the bottle of lotion, warming it between his palms and beginning to rub the heavy swell reverently, growling and moaning approvingly and placing gentle kisses along the skin as he worked.
The list of virgin Omegas did not get more than a glance at the heading before Sherlock turned the page. His fingers lingered slightly longer on the glossy photographs of currently unbred playmates. Those who were looking to be impregnated earned the greater share of his time; he traced the soft curves of their middles thoughtfully, calculating their average litter size, how they would grow, how heavy and shapely their form would become. But their pleasures were not to be his; he was not looking to breed. He licked his lips as he turned to the third section of the menu, greeted by the sight of an enormous Omega with voluptuous teats, pinned helplessly to their bed by a belly nearly full to bursting with an enormous litter. He glanced down at John for a moment. "Could be you," he echoed with a grin. "What do you think - another companion after this? You played so well with your first..." His grin widened at the soft, primal noise that emerged from John in response.
John felt himself grow wetter at the thought, and ran his hands down his mate's back to grab two handfuls of his lush arse, encouraging him to go faster, deeper. He began to whine needily, grunting softly as his mate thrust into him and their lovemaking pushed him closer and closer to the brink of pleasure.
John smiled, watching as Mycroft smoothed his hands across the swell of his mate's gravid belly. Greg was scenting Molly as well, blissfully unaware that he was growling under his breath. The sight made John want his own Alpha, and when Jasper and Percival had finished nursing he brought them both into the nest, settling close to Sherlock.
Sherlock let out a slow breath of relief. T
, pulsing come up as far as his own chin. "Sherlock! Ahhh... thank you, love," he purred, sated. He let his Alpha drain his milk, stroking his hair softly and murmuring praises, feeling utterly content. This, surely, was what he'd been born for. Not the army, not being a doctor... just this, securely knotted to  his Alpha, pregnant with a huge litter of his pups, letting him suckle his milk from his breasts. He clenched around the knot, gratefully, letting his mate know how happy he was to be knotted. "I'm full here, too," he joked, running his Alpha's hand over his belly.
John chuckled and kissed his forehead softly. "Enjoyed that, did you?" he asked gently, stroking his cheek. "Alright then, help me up..." He grunted and swayed as Sherlock helped him to his feet, his belly still high and firm despite its massive weight, and purred as Sherlock helped him dress in loose flannel pyjamas and a thick dressing gown, balancing with one hand on his mate's shoulders as Sherlock put his slippers on for him. When the Alpha was satisfied that the Omega was warm enough he dressed himself quickly and John smiled affectionately over his shoulder as he made his way to the living room, where they'd set up a real fir tree with lights and tinsel, a thick nine-foot Norwegian which filled the room with a pleasant pine scent. Underneath it lay the gifts they'd bought each other, wrapped neatly and tied up in bows, John's gifts to Sherlock covered in sleek silver and black damask paper. He was least sure of the only present he'd made himself; Sherlock didn't know he could knit, but he could, and very well - he'd spent three weeks knitting in secret when Sherlock was off on cases or at the lab doing experiments (when he could be persuaded that John was fine on his own) and objectively, he knew that the matching scarf and gloves he'd crafted in a cloud-soft lusciously thick gunmetal grey were well-made gifts, he wasn't sure how Sherlock, a man of Savile Row and Italian shoes, would receive home-made knitted items.
Mycroft took it from her and fastened it gently around her neck, pecking her affectionately on the cheek as he drew back. "You are in no way obliged to wear them anywhere," he said earnestly, "and I will never be angry with you or discipline you for taking it off, or not wearing it, or losing it. But if it brings you comfort, until you get used to freedom, then I am glad, and if you wish to continue wearing it then of course you may." Catherine came forward next, eager and purring quietly, baring her neck demurely and cooing with delight when the ginger Alpha buckled the collar into place. She leaned forward and rubbed against his chest, catlike, mewing softly to thank him, and he chuckled, stroking her hair.
scent. "It'll make a nice change from me feeding you..." he murmured playfully, carding a hand through his Alpha's hair. "Have I told you how much I love it when you're nursing from me? It feels so
out for dinner tonight - nice place, nicer than they usually go, because she's planning to finally reveal her gender before she goes into her next heat in, oh, about four days’ time."
, he moaned, rubbing his belly in slow circles. He picked up a fork and scooped some of the chicken noodle dish onto it, offering it to his mate. "Come on then, your turn..."
John purred and crooned to his sleeping mate, petting him fondly. He felt utterly secure,
... Sherlock like this was something out of every romance novel ever written; dark curls wet with spray, chest heaving, muscled arms flexing to hold him in place, dominating and pressing him against the wall, his cock throbbing and hard, and suddenly John grew even wetter at the knowledge that he was carrying this man's pups. He wrapped his legs fully around Sherlock's waist, squeezing him, letting him feel how wet he was to ensure his mate got some enjoyment out of this position too as the kiss segued again, becoming a little more hot and feverish, more laced with need.
his own Alpha's arousal and possessive need coursing through him. His mate was so deliciously hard for him, was touching his pup-stuffed belly with a firm hand and groping his milky breasts, and it made the Omega part of John writhe in glee.
John purred loudly, smiling as the babies recognised his scent and voice and burbled in greeting, flailing their little arms. Miles and Lucy seemed fussiest, so he scooped them up first, crooning softly as they both latched on and settled against him with a hum. He couldn't help but sigh in relief as they eagerly drank his milk, the ache in his breasts finally relieved; he watched approvingly as Sherlock held and played with their other children, sending warm love through the bond towards his mate.
John clung to his mate and swayed a little, his knees going weak at the way Sherlock was kissing and holding him; it felt so possessive, so protective, so accepting, he couldn't help but feel utterly cherished. A tiny keening gasp escaped him as he felt Sherlock's tongue slide against his own and he surrendered instantly, unable to stop the kiss, unable to want to, warmth blooming between his legs as he felt his arousal build and the scent of his juices began to fill the shower.
again and again as he begged through the bond.
John panted lightly as he trembled, Sherlock's kisses and licks to his swollen belly only adding to the heat coiling in him. He wriggled desperately, gripping the sheets and keening, unable to speak but mouthing
John whimpered in reply, the scent of the cooling takeaway food suddenly becoming irresistible. He bounced more fervently on Sherlock's cock, desperate, getting closer and closer to orgasm. "T-two weeks should be enough to let you see the swell... I'll look five and a half months gone... Three weeks, I'll look six months pregnant... I... I don’t care anymore if I can barely walk down the aisle, I'll waddle clutching my best man for support if that's what you want, oh fuck, Sherlock... rub my belly, feel your pups making me swell..." he gasped, knowing he wouldn't last much longer, thrilled by the idea of Sherlock forcing him to grow and swell even faster. "We won't be able to hide it anymore if you command me to swell for you... everyone will know in just a few days..." he gasped and cried out breathily, rapidly approaching his climax, bouncing faster. "Oh god Sherlock, I fucking love having your enormous cock in me! Oh.." he inhaled a sharp breath as he realised something. "I wasn't thinking straight before... I was thinking about what happens when an Alpha commands his Omega to swell with one baby... with multiples, it's different, because they're smaller than single newborns... when commanded to swell, the Omega is still pregnant for nine months because the multiples simply grow to the size of a single newborn instead of staying smaller to avoid fighting for space... fuck, I don't know if I can fit thirteen full-size babies in me..." he panted, coming across Sherlock's stomach with a scream, grinding himself down onto Sherlock's cock as far as possible.
John whined in apology, grunting high-pitched as his mate continued to drive into him. He had been rapidly losing coherency, but now it abandoned him entirely, leaving him with a vocabulary of squeaks, moans and cries he could barely force out. He jerked forward with each rough thrust, the sound of skin slapping harshly against the back of his thighs filling the room. There was no question that he was being
Sherlock didn't need to stroke himself to hardness in preparation for entering his Omega; he was already fully erect, just his hands on John's belly enough to interest his cock. The Alpha purred as he draped an arm over his mate, caressing John's gravid middle once more. A breathy groan escaped his lips as pressed inside John's tight heat easily. He began to rock them both together in a gentle, slow rhythm. "It was nothing," he murmured as he pressed a kiss to the hollow behind John's jaw. He suddenly felt embarrassed of his mate catching him in such a moment. "I was... teaching them about the outside world. Explaining winter and snow ...," he cleared his throat gently, blushing, "And how they have such a brilliant mother."
"Have you thought about names yet?" John asked her kindly; he'd scented her pregnancy the moment she walked in the door, since his senses were heightened due to his pregnancy and he needed to be able to prepare for any competition for resources his own new litter might face. He could tell that Molly was still early in her gestation; she must have conceived the night she bonded with Greg, John thought to himself, and he felt a burst of happiness as he scented that she was also having triplets; their litters would be packmates, as good as cousins, and each in their own special group of three.
John purred as Sherlock worshipped him, stroking his mate's hair. "Have I pleased you, my Alpha?" he murmured seductively, spreading his legs, his hole slick as Sherlock teased it with his fingers and his scent deepening, curling around him in sweet tendrils drawing the Alpha in, addictive and heady. John mewled and whined as Sherlock touched and tasted him, his exposed navel sensitive and tingling, his entrance preparing for a thick cock and knot now that the nest was built. "My Alpha," John purred again, displaying himself shamelessly, feeling voluptuous and wanton, slowly kneeling, allowing Sherlock to continue worshipping his gravid form, before his instincts demanded submission to encourage a knot and he pushed tentatively at Sherlock to roll him onto his back. "It's my turn to worship you," he crooned stroking his Alpha's cock and kissing his balls. "I want to suckle on that magnificent cock that put so many babies in me... Get it nice and wet for you to mount me and slip it into me... May I kneel for you?" he smiled, lying beside him.
Remington sat stiff as John pet him, his eyes narrowed in thought. His uncertainty had been replaced by sadness, then by anger as John had continued to speak. "Y-you make it s-sound so e-e-
the Alpha queried, kissing him just as headily.
"You're mine, and mine only," Sherlock rumbled, echoing the sentiment and asserting his own claim, "You seemed half drunk on my seed - it was nearly as intoxicating to watch your pretty mouth on my cock, watch you make a mess of yourself as you tried to swallow my come, then gave in and let it mark all over you as you rubbed your belly against me." He tilted his Omega's head up to kiss him headily, "I would not be opposed to letting you do it again, whenever you like, since you seem to love it so much," he smirked.
edge to his scent to reassure his Alpha. "Your knot feels bigger," he moaned whorishly, wriggling on it again. "Tell me... how
Sherlock's eyes widened in arousal. He purred and set down the glass. His fingers traced the nub reverently, and then he thumbed over the protrusion, smirking at the low moan it drew from the Omega. "Gorgeous," he rumbled, replacing his hands with his mouth, closing his lips around the newly-exposed mound and swirling his tongue around it. He cupped the swell, rubbing the stretch marked skin greedily.
me," Moriarty purred, holding out two slick fingers in invitation while he pinched his nipples with his other hand. "You've wondered what I'd taste like before, haven't you? Be honest, now. Won't it drive you
Sherlock continued to thrust, using all his willpower not to break his rhythm and remove the condom. His eyes were heavy-lidded as he suckled dark marks into his mate's neck, trying to communicate his pleasure and approval despite the thin barrier over his cock.
Remington perked up as Alistair and Blake paused their cooing to watch their sibling intently. "Cay...ke...," Viola continued, the second sound coming out as a tiny sneeze, "Cay..ke.. Cay-ke.. Cake... Cake!" she exclaimed, knowing she'd succeeded when more adults turned to look. "Cake!" She flailed excitedly, her chubby fists making grabbing motions at the treat on the table.
Sherlock's breath caught in his throat. He could feel himself hardening quickly in his trousers, but couldn't bring himself to stop John's hand from its playful touches. "I... I can," he murmured, wanting to impress and satisfy his Omega; John was beginning to become too large for Sherlock to drink
"John, in case you've forgotten - and I do hope you haven't considering the rather spectacular results - you've recently lost the ability to move," he answered simply, his eyes remaining fixed on the file in his hand, "The side effects being, of course, that you need my help for any activity that requires moving even mere feet from our nest. I don't think it would be best for me to leave here for any extended length of time." He gave his mate a gentle, apologetic kiss on the cheek, "Lestrade can Skype me in, and I can have one of Mycroft's lackeys pick up the pies. It's best if I stay here to protect and aid you."
Mycroft had located an unoccupied on-call room, locking the door behind them as Persephone waddled laboriously to an open bed, her jumper already pushed up over her swollen middle. Spreading her legs and holding the pole of one of the bunks, she lowered herself down with a heavy groan, stifling a grin as she saw Mycroft frozen in the doorway. "You like this, big boy?" she cooed, her eyes dark as she pushed the straining band of her trousers lower. Her gigantic belly sat low and ripe, the furthest curve of it pushing past her knees. "You like how big and swollen I've become because of you? Look at what you've made me, Myc," she moaned, caressing her full womb. Persephone's scent had changed, her usual floral notes becoming honeyed and inviting. "I'm so wet for you, my Alpha," she purred. "Please, I need you to take me now."
John mewed softly as he was filled but did not wake. He gave a contented little hum as Sherlock began to thrust, gripping the sheets a little tighter, his body rocking with the motions, his breasts rippling in time as his Alpha fucked him. He made a confused but approving noise as he began to wake, beginning to push back into the thrusts. His face registered his steady rise through sleep to waking, pleasant confusion as the huge cock inside him registered, a fluttering of his eyelashes, and sudden wide-eyed delight as he realised his Alpha was taking him. He beamed, purred, covered as much of Sherlock's face as he could reach in tiny kisses, moaned, arched, pushed his chest forward. "Full," he breathed, "please." He mewled happily as his mate growled and began massaging his breasts in earnest, milking him, spraying jets of creamy milk across the bedspread. "Mmm, yes, better," he sighed, spreading his legs as best he could to give him better access. "Ohhh, god, yes... I love it when
Collecting himself a little, he gave another tug to the leash, guiding John's body forward. He remembered now. His last command involved release for both of them.
John whined in apology, moaning as his Alpha fingered him; he was so slick and open it was doing little more than tease him. "Ngh - you wanted - ah - hear me... spoke for you - can't... don't want to... demand... I -
Gradually Mycroft's suckling slowed, until finally he was sated and he latched off with a blissful sigh, purring deeply as John carded a hand through his hair. He squeezed his brother's hand again, sending love and gratitude through the pack bond, before crawling back across to join the rest of the pack, nuzzling and scenting them, occasionally muttering "Mine" to himself as he did so. Once Sherlock and Remington had finished nursing, they could open the final few presents and then have lunch - Sherlock and the Omegas had spent several days preparing portions of the meal for the entire pack in advance. Two turkeys had been in the oven since the morning, and several more items made fresh with the help of Beatrice and Mycroft in the early hours after Sherlock had woken.  Whenever the pack was ready to eat, the food would be on the table within minutes.
" he hissed, thrashing, trying to throw him off.
He knew exactly where Alistair had picked up that word: in a gently lit nursery, late at night, when he was meant to be asleep. Sherlock knew because it was at that time, after the whole house had gone to bed, that he snuck out from underneath the warm covers, kissed his snoring mate on the cheek, and went to visit each of the pups in their cradles, scenting each of them in turn. He would lift them ever-so-gently, holding their warm, soft little bodies lovingly in his arms as he placed his cool nose to their developing scent glands and nuzzled with care, purring as he inhaled and imprinted on the scent of his pup. "Mine," he would whisper tenderly to each before tucking them in again. John was saved for last, when the Alpha could hardly keep his eyes open, and draped himself over his mate to sleep.
"I will, I'll tell them, I promise. Such a strong Alpha, always protecting us..." he mewled submissively, nuzzling into Sherlock's neck. "I know you'll keep our family safe. What genders do you think the pups will be? A mix of Alphas and Omegas? Harry's a Beta, so I know I have Beta blood in my family somewhere..."
"Either sounds fine with me," Sherlock smiled, "and I agree about the cake, if it will agree with your stomach." He couldn't stop himself from grinning wider at the double meaning. "I'd like it to be tiered, of course, but frosted simply - nothing too ornate or complex. Perhaps white, with a cascade of orchids on one side? We'll have to choose colours for the theme, and find a suit or dress to fit you around the time we plan to hold it..."
to - to behave," he explained miserably, disappointment sharp in his throat and tears threatening to sting his eyes. He'd only managed such coherence because his Alpha had demanded to hear him; he hardly dared to demand anything from his owner, he was meant to be ordered, not the other way around. "Want your cock,
Sherlock snarled, feeling a knot readying at the base of his cock. He was going to claim John thoroughly, be every inch of the incredible Alpha his mate wanted. The next growl was louder, a powerful rumble like thunder that enveloped them in its sound, seeming to become part of the space itself, both surrounding them and moving through them simultaneously. The pups stirred and mewled in excitement, stretching and yawning and then settling easily, their tiny bodies vibrating pleasantly with the noise; they felt more secure, and as it passed, they drifted off again.
"Anything is going to feel fast after having thirteen pups at once," Sherlock pointed out reasonably. As John shifted in discomfort, he placed his hands under his mate's back and began massaging gently. "And you'll be fully conscious for this round, unlike the last. You're going to feel everything in full force. Makes me a bit glad it’s going to go quicker."
Sherlock interrupted, staring hard at Donovan as he enveloped John in a protective embrace, lapping gently along his Omega's face and stroking his back soothingly, "My Omega is carrying thirteen of my pups. You cannot
"Ngh - ah - Sh-Sher -
"Oh fuck," John moaned weakly, losing himself to the pleasure.
. He balanced his soft reprimands with kind petting, roughly stroking John's hair and shoulders as his mate worked.
But then he'd taken that second step forward.
John was sinking into his Omega again; Sherlock could see it in his face and smell it in his scent. "You like it too," the Alpha rumbled, his eyes flashing hungrily. "Perhaps just as much as I do. Christ, you sexy, wanton thing- Does it feel good to eat so much while you bounce on my cock?" Between muffins, he pulled John down into heady kisses, massaging the Omega's breasts and caressing his expanding middle. "You're already swelling out again, gorging yourself on pastry. Keep this up and you'll gain a whole stone before the month is through."
"You've dropped at least another five already," Sherlock growled, "I can smell it on you. You were made for this, made to waddle around with a big, ripe belly of my babies on your front, made to swell and birth and then swell again for me." The bed was shaking with the Alpha's thrusts. His thighs were trembling with the exertion as he felt another release building, his nearly-spent cock filling with a third wave of seed. "I'm going to give you another full litter, breed you until your belly's spilling past your knees again, remind you what it's like to be
Sherlock panted, picking up his pace, John's dirty talk urging him on. "Christ, John, so good," he groaned, "Mine ... made you like this ..." His cock slid easily between the Omega's wet breasts, the pressure of them perfect around his length. He keened softly whenever he felt his Omega's tongue at his balls. "Won't be able to do this for very long... soon you'll be too huge with my brood to even lie on your back ..." He moaned again at the thought, beginning to fuck John's belly button with his mouth and tongue.
is very protective." He offered Mycroft a small polite smile, saccharine in its insincerity. "Let us not argue... We are brothers now," he deliberately misquoted Austen, knowing it would irritate Mycroft both for the mangling of the original quote and the fact it cast Mycroft as George Wickham, giving him a wide, cheeky smirk, bursting to tell him about the massive brood he was carrying.
have to leave the blanket eventually, but for now, they could hold off the consequences as long as possible. The Alpha could feel his mate's apprehensiveness through the bond, and surprisingly found himself sharing his dread; it would have been easier had Molly seen John recently, had they not had to reveal the Omega's massive growth so suddenly on Christmas. He smiled kindly at the pathologist as she sat down. "Bart's is still the same, I suppose," he tried conversationally.
Lucy (orange) has dark curls and light blue eyes, and an oval face.
scent markers as he mewled encouragingly, too exhausted to push back into the thrusts even in his sleep, moaning shakily in pleasure as his Alpha thrust into him. He sent nothing through the bond, however; he needed his conscious mind for that. He clenched experimentally around his mate and wrinkled his face in distaste at the feel of the rubber covering his mate's cock. His instinct demanded skin, the feel of his mate's seed filling him again. His little cock was hard and leaking, begging for attention, and his cries gained a note of needy want as he tried to beg his mate to touch him, fill him, satisfy his biological imperative.
"Yes, such a slut for me, my gorgeous pregnant Omega whore," Sherlock hissed, "Perhaps the more I spread your legs and fuck you, the quicker and larger our children will grow." He nuzzled his mate more before passionately kissing his Omega's bruised lips, thrusting faster and harder, feeling John's hips keep time with his own. "Given time, our pups will make you swell so big I won't be able to reach my arms around your enormous womb," he groaned, gently pressing against the bump, "You'll need me to hold you back just to counterbalance its size, until it’s so large you can no longer walk or stand under the weight of it. You'll be more belly than man."
John sighed happily as Sherlock rubbed his belly, knowing he wouldn't get bigger for a fortnight but still proud of his small swell. "And I wouldn't change you for the world either... Possessive, protective, but you don't treat me like I'm made of glass. You know what I can handle..." He leaned on Sherlock's shoulder and dozed, smiling, until they reached the Diogenes Club. Rousing and smirking, imagining the look on Mycroft's face, he followed Sherlock inside.
what we were doing?"
John's breath hitched as his Alpha rutted against his belly, tilting his face up to seek more attentions - but his belly was too big for his mate to reach. Mycroft met his brother's eyes and waited for assent before he carefully reached out and began carding a hand through the Omega's hair, soothing him. John sighed happily, keeping his eyes fixed on his mate but leaning in to his pack Alpha's touch. He let out a tiny, tentative purr, increasing in volume when his mate rewarded him with faster, more frantic thrusts.
, he sent through the bond.
"I want
The rest of the meal passed in a haze of chatting, smiling and laden dishes being passed back and forth. Mrs Hudson insisted on helping to clear the table and when Sherlock brought out the Christmas pudding, flames from the brandy flickering happily, there was a small round of applause and John beamed at his mate. The dessert went down well, dishes scraped clean, and soon the little party were back in the living room, all seated in the squashy armchairs and sofas while Sherlock retrieved the presents from under the tree and made a small pile next to each recipient. "Guests first," John reminded Sherlock softly. "Go on Mycroft, you go first," he called, grinning, eager to see what the others had got him, hoping he'd approve of the bottle of vintage Calvados that he and Sherlock and bought him.
Sherlock passed his mate the laptop, before resting his head against John's full chest and stomach. It made for John having to rather awkwardly adjust his arm around him as he typed, but the Alpha knew his mate didn't mind
He intensified the pressure of his caresses just a little more, purring louder as the Omega mewled.
Through the haze of urgency and anger, the Alpha suddenly felt a calming wave of love roll through him. In the back of the cab, his hands came to rest over his heart, and he swallowed back tears. John. Wherever he was, John was feeling love for him, so intentionally and strongly as to send it to Sherlock; it was as if he was sending him a message on a mobile phone, but one of emotions rather than words. They were still connected, Sherlock thought, and they could use that, no matter what. The Alpha focused hard, sending a mixture of concern and love towards his mate, hoping for a response that would tell him more about the Omega's current situation.
Several steps before reaching the front door, Sherlock could smell the familiar scent of the Alpha on the opposite side of the portal. There was always a hint of spice to Lestrade's scent, a highlighting the otherwise solid fragrance of earth, metal, and black tea. He opened the door to find the grey-haired inspector with his hands shoved deep in his pockets against the chill, staring thoughtfully up at the large house. "It's funny, innit?" he mused, "Had anyone told me five years ago that Sherlock Holmes would be bonded, with thirteen pups on the way, inviting people over for Christmas dinners, I would've told 'em they were barking mad." He turned to look at Sherlock, waiting for the other Alpha's nod of assent before approaching the door. "Hell, all those Christmases I invited you over, couldn't get you to come to a single one... and now look at you." The Alpha merely gave a small smile. "Touch my mate without my consent, and I may attempt to kill you where you stand," he said conversationally, lightly barring the entrance with one hand. "Fair enough," Lestrade nodded, "
The door burst open with a loud
John arched and yelled in bliss as the knot breached him, accepting it greedily, the feeling of Sherlock's come spurting into him sending him over the edge and his cock jerked and pulsed untouched with his second orgasm. He purred at Sherlock's hands on him, getting louder at Sherlock's telling him he could feel their pups. "Yes, Sherlock, so full... Mmm, feels so good," he moaned happily, tilting his head to encourage more kisses, letting Sherlock rock him through the aftershocks of his orgasm, whimpering a little each time he felt a fresh wave of Sherlock's semen. "Can you feel them all, Sherlock? Your pups wriggling in my belly?" he purred, almost delirious at being knotted. He let Sherlock shift them so they were lying on their sides, Sherlock's hands still splayed protectively over his belly, John guiding his hands to where the movement was strongest, letting him feel all of their pups. "I love it when you've got your hands on my belly... so protective, marking us as yours... They know their daddy loves them," he breathed, feeling the pups move more at Sherlock's gentle hands. He smiled and turned his head back to kiss his Alpha, utterly contented at being knotted and stroked.
John sucked in a breath paused for a moment in surprise, just managing to guide a nipple into Ellie's mouth. The Omega sighed gently but said nothing. Now was not the time. The pups fussed as they nursed, and from the sounds of crying in the nursery, the others were just as upset. "Will you bring me the next two?" John asked quietly when the first two were as sated as they could manage.
Sherlock climbed slowly out of John's lap to sit next to him, fastidiously making adjustments to his mate's clothing to make sure John would be comfortable and well-covered. He hummed, tucking a bit of John's shirt into the Omega's trousers, "It was as you said - the interior was horribly decorated, and would need work- too much work for my liking. While the floor plan is wonderful, I don't think we want to wait as long as it will take for the walls to be stripped and repainted- if that would even be allowable. The other home still feels better to me, regardless. We'll have to see something truly spectacular for me to change my mind about it." He pressed a gentle kiss to his mate's jaw.
Sherlock smiled and nipped his earlobe playfully. "I couldn't resist - my wife simply looked incredible this morning, so gravid with my pups, his breasts so swollen and large just for me, and then of course,
"Mmm, and I've fed you up as well. All of those extra portions have only made our children heavier and stronger. I told you it wouldn't be easy getting them out," Sherlock purred, rubbing his erection against John's backside. His long fingers massaged John's soft hips as the labouring Omega strained. "You'd be the envy of the club if you'd chosen to birth at Pendleton's," he growled, "But this stunning scene is for my eyes only." Kissing the small of John's back with pride, the Alpha purred as he felt his mate give another hearty shove. "That's it, gorgeous," he hummed, licking his lips in anticipation. "You're feeling every ounce of that enormous pup I've got you with." As the skin around John's hole began to bulge, he cupped a hand over it, the hot flesh pressing firmly against his palm.
. He began to rub his belly nervously, as if uncertain of the reaction to the words he was about to say.
The Alpha's eyes gleamed at the prospect, a pleased flush spreading across his cheeks and chest. "Mmm... Several things come to mind, yes," Sherlock purred, pressing a kiss to his mate's damp hair. He shifted to reach a hand beneath John's legs. "You know, I just love to watch you in pleasure," he whispered, grinning against John's ear as his long fingers closed around the Omega's small cock. He began to stroke delicately, moving over his mate's member in soft, lazy pulls; John was already so sensitive and desperate that it didn't take much. "You're right..," he murmured, watching hungrily as John's face contorted in bliss, "I've made you so gorgeous and plump, so heavy with my children... I've never seen an Omega more beautiful. And of course I'll feed you more, my love... Keep you properly large and sated even before you show with our next litter..."
John's obvious submission encouraged Sherlock deeper into his own instinct. The Alpha gave a low, guttural growl. He let his eyes roam over his mate, the Omega as still as a picture in front of him perfectly obedient, only waiting for his next command. Sherlock knew that anything he wished John to do, his mate would soon do without question. The silk was now piled elegantly on top of the exposed roundness of John's belly; he didn't even need to hold it there, his Omega was so large. He began to grin, baring sharp, white Alpha canines, the sense of power beginning to flow through him like heat. He circled his thumb around one of John's large nipples, still only touching, exploring. He admired the gentle curve of the lace struggling to push up John's massive breasts, the full curve of his belly, his small cock perfectly framed by the black panties. He caressed the Omega's erect member thoughtfully, as if he were a judge and John a prize specimen at a show. "Touch yourself," he commanded at last, "Display yourself for me."
Sherlock's orgasm was torn from him as John clenched violently around his cock, and he came with a long, loud groan, bucking erratically as he fucked them both through their releases. "Christ, John..." he moaned reverently, when they were spent. He rubbed John's girth reverently, fingers tracing the hanging swell of the Omega's belly. He groaned lightly and sighed, at a loss for words, his mate's panting and the sound of milk spurting into the bottles filling the quiet.
, he praised,
Just as it had at their wedding, John's scent changed as Sherlock suckled,
Sherlock nodded, quietly taking the Omega's hand in his own as he climbed off the sofa to kneel on the floor in front of John. Ever so gently, he slid the band onto John's left ring finger, exhaling as it moved over the Omega's skin with ease, coming to rest comfortably snug above he bottom most knuckle - an unmistakeably perfect fit. The Alpha kept his hold around the band, holding John's hand in his own as he met his mate's gaze. "I know we have not been the most traditional of couples," he began slowly, "But I ... I feel like I owe this to you ... I ...." He paused, swallowing, "I ... You ... You are an incredible man, a brilliant mate, and I ... I love you. So much so that feels paltry, so incredibly insufficient to put it into words. You are more than just an Omega, you are my partner, and...," he drew in another deep breath, trying to find the words. "You deserve this," he said, almost pleading, as if the statement somehow explained everything, "you deserve this, and so much more. And I want you always to know how much you mean to me, how I am indebted to you ..."
he sent his pure adoration through the bond, enveloping the Omega in utter bliss and unconditional love.
Sherlock's eyes lingered on the tray for a moment before he took the card. He held it between his fore and middle fingers, examining both sides carefully, as the Beta remained in attendance for his answer. The Alpha's silent deductions were punctuated by soft, audible moans as John tended perfectly to his erection, and the sound of his pleasure blended easily with similar noises being made around him. Several chairs down, an Alpha around his age was thrusting vigorously into a pregnant club Omega's mouth, his grunts growing louder as he neared climax. Sherlock hummed in thought and arousal before pocketing the card, and neatly drawing out one of his own in its place, setting it delicately on the offered tray. "Please thank Mister Eastlake and extend my invitation to join me here. And inform him and the bar that his next drink, any drink he chooses, is to be placed on my tab," he smiled cordially, before moaning and fisting his fingers in John's short hair. "That's it," he growled as John swallowed him deeper, "
Benedict (cobalt/azure/bright mid blue) has auburn curls and blue-green eyes. He looks a lot like his Uncle Mycroft.
a drama queen," he grinned, rubbing the Alpha's chest and belly, petting him like he was an overgrown kitten. "When I'm ready to let you collar me again - and I will be - I don't want a new collar. The one you bought me is
John purred softly and kissed Blake's forehead as the baby settled against him, clinging to his jumper and cooing.
John keened loudly, a long open-mouthed moan that could not be mistaken for anything but the pleasure of an Omega being thoroughly taken. As Sherlock thrust into him hard and fast the Omega grew all but breathless with lust, watching the feral dominance and aching need on his mate's face, sparks of desire shooting up his spine at the sight.
Sherlock carefully worked the cloth over John's neck and shoulders, down his arms and up again to move over his back. Under the water, he cleaned around the Omega's abused hole with the utmost gentleness "Tonight, then," he agreed, a grin spreading across his face, "I'll make an exhibitionist of you, yet."  He let his hand move to John's front to wash his small member, humming as he watched John unconsciously begin to cup and rub the swell of his belly. "I'll take care of that," he murmured, holding his mate's gravid abdomen in both hands before beginning to wash his Omega's round middle and breasts with absolute reverence, leaning in to kiss John lovingly. "You do realize this defeats half the purpose of our bath," he murmured seductively against his Omega's lips, "Washing some of my scent off you like this - I'll need to mark you again, make sure he knows exactly who you belong to when you're naked in front of him, rubbing your swollen womb."
John squealed happily when he was knotted, coming untouched and pressing back against his Alpha as closely as possible. He beamed at him, lapping at his jaw with a low purr. He pushed his feelings through the bond;
"Yes, Sherlock, I'm ready, please, god, please fuck me... I need it," John moaned whorishly, panting lightly as his mate's enormous member filled him. He began to rock on it, grunting with the pleasure. "Oh, fuck, yeah, that's it...  ngh, fuck, yeah... god, your cock feels fantastic... bite me Sherlock, bite my bondmark," he begged, giving a long drawn-out groan when his Alpha sank his teeth in, almost holding him in place ready for a thorough fucking. "I want to suck your cock later," John ground out, "I want you to fuck my mouth, nearly choke me with it. I want to see your face as you come all over mine. I want you to stand above me and wank over me, cover my skin with your seed, mark me with it," he breathed, trying to bounce on Sherlock's cock with limited success. "Mmm, yeah, that's it, oh,
bonded, it's going to be hard adjusting to the reality that we're having so many babies, the final proof this bond is for real. I know it doesn't make much sense, but... Where feelings are involved, people tend to cling to any hope they can get," he explained gently. "With Lestrade we can be proud, with Mycroft we can be smug, but Molly has been good to us and we have to be kind to her. I don't think she'll want you to see her disappointment. She'll get over it soon enough, I'm sure, so don't worry about her. Anyway, just think, if we tell everyone when I'm six weeks gone we'll only have another two weeks until we can get the scan to find out how many boys and how many girls we're having," he smiled warmly. "Want to place any bets?"
“Fuck, yes, yours, all yours, oh god,” John keened, all but vibrating in ecstasy at Sherlock’s hands on his gravid belly, "my Alpha, my husband, my babydaddy... Christ, I love you so much Sherlock, I've always loved you, always wanted you, you - ah, fuck, fuck, just like that - you've always been my Alpha," he gasped, right on the edge, needing the knot before he could orgasm. "Ah, haaah, kn- knot, knot me please, please, oh god, I need it, please knot me, pleasepleaseplease, let me feel it, want you to knot me, come in me, make sure I smell of nothing but you, oh god Sherlock, fuck, please, please knot me!" he begged desperately, happy tears filling his eyes at how badly he needed it; he knew he sounded like a wanton slut but couldn't find it in himself to care.
he begged through the bond,
than he ever had before; the blissful glow of subspace warmed him, made him feel inexplicably joyful, and he suckled reflexively on Sherlock's knot, his Omega mind wanting to make the experience as pleasurable as possible for his Alpha.
, he purred,
John purred lazily, smiling into their kiss and wrapping his arms around his mate's shoulders.
, let alone me. If they'd told me that we'd have one or two pups, conceived when we lost control during a heat, and that we were making the best of it, I might have believed that, but this... this
Just as John thought Arthur was going to need a new nappy his expression cleared and the dark-haired baby blew a small raspberry. John smiled, nuzzling Adam's forehead as the pup kneaded his breast with his small fists, and sent more love and contentment through the bond. His first pregnancy suddenly seemed like a lifetime ago; the hazy memories of those months when he'd slipped into his Omega, mewling to be fucked and fed and petted, seemed oddly disconnected from the scene before him, a bed full of wriggling, active pups, nuzzling closer to their parents and cooing softly.
and John couldn't help but chuckle at how like Sherlock the sound was.
John blinked stupidly as Sherlock left, his Alpha's sudden departure bringing him out of the scent cloud and back to his senses. "Greg," he acknowledged warmly, glad to see he already had a drink in hand. "Been a busy festive season?"
Sherlock's features had settled once again into a cold mask as he'd approached the table. After sharing such an utterly loving, intimate moment, John's mortification had been no less than a knife to the Alpha's heart. While Sherlock had been shocked at their being caught out, he was in no way embarrassed. But John had been so utterly
Sherlock sighed. If he hadn't been there, hadn't heard John's words to the other Alphas, he would be eagerly taking his reward, indulging them in John's every suggestion. It might have taken him time to warm to it at first, as confirming the bonds and its reminder of the way he wronged John was difficult, but he could have come round with a little coaxing. Now, he felt mired in his depression.
We hope you enjoyed this chapter :)
Sherlock moaned, his hips moving in time with John's as he angled his cock to rub more heavily against the Omega's prostate with each thrust. "Mmm, fuck... I know I'm bigger. Do you feel what you've done to me - how your fertility has encouraged it to grow? My hormones changed with yours during the pregnancy. I grew because you did, because I wanted to give you more pleasure, because my body wants to reflect the number of children I've sired." He groaned as John contracted around him, "And you, you're still as tight as ever..."
"I'll finish more of it when we get home," he promised meekly, peeking his head into the lounge so they could greet Greg and Molly properly before leaving. "Hello you two," he smiled warmly, "sorry to love you and leave you, but you know how it is... We still on for fondue night next week?"
, his instincts supplied,
Drawing himself up a little without leaving his mother's arms, Mycroft nodded, his face achingly young and vulnerable; it had been years since he had allowed himself to need other people like this, to admit that he wanted closeness. He quickly realised the whole pack would not fit on the sofa so he tugged at Beatrice's sleeve to get her to shift onto the floor, Sherlock still wrapped in an embrace; John shuffled out of his chair, carefully cradling the pups he was holding, and snuggled up to Sherlock's other side with a warm purr. Mrs Hudson motioned to Catherine and Remington to hand her the rest of the babies and in no time the pups were all snuggled against each other on the sofa, slumped next to their parents with the rest of the pack cozied together on the floor, with Mrs Hudson watching over the pups. John nuzzled Sherlock's curls and licked his cheek affectionately, purring as he watched Beatrice's contented smile at having both her boys in her arms.
He should have never allowed him to go out alone. He should have never allowed his Omega out of his sight. But John had been so upset, and Sherlock desperately wanted to give him some time to process and mull things over - and he wasn't a child to be coddled and kept at home - the last thing that Sherlock, not his Alpha, wanted to do was to make John unhappy by encroaching too much on his freedom. But that didn't excuse the fact that he had let John walk straight into the hands of Jim Moriarty.
It had not surprised Mycroft that Sherlock sought him out like this; the rest of the pack all had some sign they belonged, either a collar or a bond bite, but Sherlock only had scent as a mark of belonging. The pack Alpha gripped his brother's hips and ground his erection against his arse, growling his dominance as he deepened the kiss. "Yes... mine now. Mine always," he murmured against Sherlock's lips, wanting his little brother to finally feel completely secure - and suddenly, he knew what he needed to do. He brought his hands up to Sherlock's chest and made quick work of his shirt buttons, tugging the garment off him and flinging it aside before nudging him to the floor and flipping him onto his hands and knees. Draping himself along Sherlock's back, Mycroft gripped his hips and began rubbing his hard cock against Sherlock's arse again, pushing just enough to part the younger Alpha's cheeks a little. "Going to bite you," Mycroft growled, nuzzling a spot on Sherlock's shoulder, right where epaulettes would go on a military uniform. "Going to show everyone you belong to my pack, belong to me."
in front of everyone, now can we?" he smirked, rocking gently on Sherlock's huge still-inflated knot. "Ohhh... Fuck, it’s so good... You've filled me with more of your seed than usual as well, haven't you? I can feel it filling me completely, almost like a water balloon," he blushed, smiling and nuzzling into his mate's chest. "Which house are we looking at first this weekend?"
Leaning forward carefully over John's enormous belly, Sherlock couldn't suppress a loud purr as he captured John's lips in his own, drawing the Omega to him and wrapping his arms joyfully around his mate. Where the couple's stomachs made contact, the Alpha could feel the pups kicking excitedly, stirred by their parents' shared joy. The kiss was deep and tender, suffused with incredible bliss. Sherlock purred louder as John's hands clenched needily into his suit. "I love you," he breathed as he pulled away, dipping his head once more to kiss the reply from his mate's lips before helping John to his feet.
He was confident that Sherlock would like the beehive he'd bought, and be eager to fill it with bees as soon as possible; the garden was certainly big enough. The box looked stupidly massive next to everything else but it couldn't be helped. He knew that Sherlock would be pleased with the thirteen little romper suits he'd bought with "I <3 Daddy" on them, the writing a different colour on each to match the colours they'd chosen for their pups; he'd put it at the back to be opened last, in case the scarf and gloves proved a let-down. Above all, though, he was most proud of the coup he'd pulled off with the aid of Lestrade; a treasure hunt across London, with the prize of thirteen of the most bizarre, apparently unsolvable cold cases they'd been able to get their hands on. The first clue was tucked inside the Christmas card he'd bought his mate, a simple photograph of a tree with an orange ribbon pinned to it, buildings visible in the background. "Open the big one first," he murmured softly, holding out a hand as Sherlock assisted him onto the sofa.
Siger's rage was coursing clear across his face, but as Mycroft predicted he made no move to attack. The ginger Alpha turned to face him, sliding his jacket off his shoulders in one fluid movement and handing it gracefully to the still-nervously-hovering hostess, as if she was a coat stand placed there for his sole use. His every move radiated certainty, calm authority. "I cannot imagine what damage you mean," Mycroft spat coldly. "The fact that your son has managed to father thirteen pups with Doctor Watson should have informed you that their bond is strong and nurturing and loving and only the best Alphas are capable of producing such litters. You yourself only managed two pups with seven years between them with our mother." He paused to savour the rage and indignation on his sire's face before continuing. "There is no shame in anything Sherlock does. He provides for his Omega from his wits rather than relying on inheritances and estates." He unfastened his cufflinks and handed them to the hostess, starting to roll up his shirtsleeves meticulously. "Sherlock will be an excellent father and I will not allow you to harm him or poach his mate." He held out his right hand expectantly, waiting for Anthea to hand him something. She retrieved the leather glove from his briefcase and handed it to him. Without flinching, he stepped up to his father and slapped him smartly across the face with the glove before throwing it at his feet defiantly.
Panting, Sherlock looked down at the fat, helpless Omega between his thighs, John's mouth still stretched open wide around his knot. "Good boy," he praised, reaching down to trace John's wet lips with his thumb. He smirked at how they were pulled so taut. "Like a prize hog in a shop window," he crooned proudly, "mouth stuffed with a big, juicy apple. What a delicious sight you are. Fat and full and ready to whelp, and still such an eager little whore for me. Still so addicted to my cock shoved in you every way you can take it." A low moan of approval rose collectively from the other Alphas, and Ms. Howard thrust her knot harder into her writhing Omega. The woman cried out, her pants and groans increasing in neediness and volume. Her belly had dropped dramatically, and her hands wouldn't stop moving over it, the pups obviously ready to come.
. To help, he gently began to shuffle them both backwards, until John was braced against the shower wall.
He rubbed his mate's back gently, smiling fondly when a soft burp followed, watching Sherlock's eyebrows furrow slightly before he nuzzled back in to continue nursing.
he purred,
The name written on the sticker
, he chided gently, whining softly as if to plead for it again.
"Yes, ah, such a little whore for you..." John moaned agreeably, curving his spine as he rode his mate so his belly rolled more obviously with each movement, swaying and rearing above the Alpha. He pressed back against Sherlock's finger, trying to get more of it inside him, as he concentrated on rubbing himself more vigorously against his mate's huge cock, picking up the pace. "Want you all the time, want your thick cock stretching me out, filling me," he mewled as he panted and gyrated, pulling the cups of the babydoll aside and pinching his nipples, spraying his milk over his Alpha's chest and face. "Look how much you've given me," he groaned lasciviously. "Such a full belly, having such a massive litter of your pups... you've made me so ripe, so milky... so pregnant I had to have this custom made to fit around my swollen middle," he breathed, holding the bump with both hands to keep it steady as he rubbed them both towards completion.
John gave a soft, satisfied whine and began licking his Alpha's jaw like a kitten lapping at cream, encircling him with tired arms and clinging to him with a contented smile.
... My maternity tops won't be able to cope, they'll barely be able to stretch over my breasts, swollen with milk to feed over a dozen of your pups," he mewled desperately, displaying himself utterly shamelessly, undulating his hips as he bounced on his Alpha's cock, milky and wet and lustful.
and would
Sherlock could feel John's responses pulsing through their bond, filling him with strength and warmth. The scent of the other Omega in heat, which at first smelled off, was now absolutely repulsive. Easily, the Consulting Detective reached into his pocket and flicked out his phone, reading the messages there. John was safe. Lestrade was near. He met the consulting criminal's gaze again with a hard stare. "Get out of my sight," he growled, "My mate is more than an incubator. All my pups are more than interesting. I could breed you, satisfy you, yes- but you repulse me. You are not John. John is incredible, loving, grounding-" With each word, he sent a stronger pulse of love back through their bond, and seemed to stand imperiously taller, "There is a reason I was able to conceive thirteen pups with my Omega. I don't think you've truly thought about the implications of that, about what it says for the strength of our bond - that John dropped thirteen eggs for me, and all thirteen his body accepted to be fertilized. I think that says his Omega knew I was rather suited for domesticity, after all." He stared down the offending Omega, projecting his best Alpha authority, "I do have an enormous cock. My knot is so large it would nearly split you open. But it's not for you. I could fuck you, fill you, give you everything you want - but I'd sooner kill you."
" he breathed, coming deep inside his mate, giving a long, low moan of ecstasy as John's breasts and belly were displayed fully before him. He continued to rock, milking both their pleasures, unable to stop as he sent them both careening into a third orgasm that seemed only an extension and amplification of the second. The Alpha cried out as his knot swelled larger, clutching at his mate's swollen belly in white, heady bliss, as he filled John again.
They remained in their instinctive states for three days, nuzzling and purring, doing nothing but fucking and sleeping, stopping only to wolf down the food their pack members left at the door to the nest. They all but merged into one being, constantly connected by Sherlock’s cock inside John, their hands entwined, their lips pressed together in a blissful haze, further cementing their bond.
Something gleamed in Sherlock's eyes at the words. The Alpha was thoroughly taking his Omega now, pursuing his pleasure with his cock shoved wholly down John's throat. "Fuck, I'm close-" he gasped, "
"Oh, well now you've spoilt it," Sherlock teased, his eyes sparkling bright as he stole a kiss from his mate. "If I'd known we were going to use the words 'husband' and 'wife' to one another before the dinner, I would have proudly re-informed my
The whole pack gasped softly as they witnessed the pup's first word and John felt his eyes fill with happy tears as he watched his mate care so lovingly for their daughter. Snuggled against Sherlock's neck Imogen cooed happily, clinging to his shirt as tightly as she could and revelling in the attention. "Dada," she sighed happily, rubbing her cheek across his scent gland, sounding for all the world as if there was nothing better than Sherlock in existence.
John nodded, then whimpered in relief as Sherlock latched on and began to suckle, carding a hand through his curls and crooning encouragingly. He sighed happily as Sherlock took the edge off and switched to the other one, draining him enough so that it didn't ache any more. "Want to finish milking me in the shower?" he murmured, stroking his mate's hair, knowing his stomach was already full from the meal. "We'll have to buy a pump tomorrow, I think... if you're good I'll even model it for you on my hands and knees, belly heavy between my legs, breasts swinging underneath me as my milk is drawn out, spurting into the bottles..."
he sent honestly,
for it." He grit his teeth and moaned as he came again inside his mate, spilling hard and filling John full.
insisted on boarding school. I'm so sorry, my darling. I love you so much, I won't ever leave you. Hush, now, it's alright. You've got me, I'm here, he will never separate us again, not ever."
The other Alphas purred in admiration, eagerly watching the struggling Omega writhe on her mate's cock. The redhead's scent deepened and bloomed, the markers familiar and unmistakeable to everyone present;
If you would prefer to read the original version, skip the next chapter then continue as normal.
John stroked a hand through Sherlock's dark curls, petting him like a kitten. "Oh, love, you've not ruined anything and you're not a monster," he sighed, rubbing his Alpha's back as he cradled him. "You're not a bad Alpha, my darling. You didn't mean to hurt me, you just needed to claim me, and it wouldn't have been so bad if there hadn't been two other Alphas here all afternoon, if you hadn't talked with Mycroft about your parents... I know you don't want them near me. The threat of them was in the back of your mind, your brother's scent and Lestrade's would still have been lingering in the air, maybe in the fabric of the armchairs, and you felt like you needed to make sure that I was still completely yours. I should have realised," he murmured softly, regretfully, "I should have realised how much of a strain it would be for you to have two other Alphas here for so long, so near the nest. You've not ruined Christmas, love. Can't you scent it on me? I feel absolutely secure, I know you'd murder anyone who dared touch me. I know you'd fight for me. There, there, it's alright." He felt the last of the knot deflate and didn't try to pull away, simply letting his Alpha stay buried in him, knowing he probably needed the reassurance.
he encouraged, his hands gliding over John's full form,
Carefully, the Alpha unclenched his fingers from the plush, downy duvet and curled one trembling hand around his thick member. He knew John could last, until given the command. Besides, this show was even more spectacular than the last.
"You're not at all done yet. I haven't even begun to touch myself," Sherlock murmured, "That's it... Caress, explore - my Omega is a virgin when it comes to this. I want to feel like you are both exploring one another for the very first time. Lifting one another's bellies, playing with your breasts, making your wombs rub together... You've been doing well. Keep going, though don't just do what actions I tell you. Your most interesting attempts are purely organic. I want to see you enjoying this, like it's one of the most fascinating, arousing experiences you've ever had..." He sent a pulse of love and reassurance through the bond, wanting his Omega to know he was doing well.
He eagerly drank down the milk flowing from John's large breast.
the most interesting he'd had in a good few months, and Sherlock
, he remembered, nuzzling the pup. Benedict nuzzled against his cheek, purring happily.
The Omega nodded as best he could, crying out in bliss. "Yes, fuck, please, want it, want... mmm, yes, use me,
, his posture said, and the Omegas smiled tenderly, placing traditional good-luck kisses on John's forehead and belly as they left with the last of the babies.
, he said quietly,
Sherlock smiled back at him, sadness tinging his features.
Sherlock chuckled, "It will be perfect. I couldn't picture you with any other kind of nest, John." He gently wiped the tears from his mate's eyes, pulling out his phone and dialling his brother. "Mycroft?" he immediately rolled his eyes at the knowing response; he shouldn't have expected any less than for his brother to deduce the exact place they'd chosen, "See that we have it, please. We'll want to move in as soon as possible. Thank you." He hung up, receiving a text not a few minutes later with the confirmation. The Alpha beamed brightly, pulling his mate into an excited kiss. "We have a new home, my Omega," he grinned, "We have a home." It was Sherlock's turn to tear up more, his Alpha overwhelmingly proud and satisfied of providing the shelter for his mate and their pups.
, John purred in reply,
John smiled as he passed the sunroom, the three female Omegas knitting and chatting happily as Lestrade, Mycroft and Remington watched over the pups, some cuddled against the pack members, others snoozing in their Moses baskets. He snuck up behind his Alpha when he found him in the kitchen and purred quietly as he reached out a hand to stroke his back. "Come with me, love," he murmured, "I want to show you something." Gently, he took Sherlock's hand, leading him through the lounge and past the door of the nest - up the stairs, to their official bedroom. The pups had got better at sleeping through the night - Arthur had managed it aged just seven weeks, and John had panicked and thought he was dead - but with thirteen babies to look after, they still hadn't quite been able to bring themselves to make the move to sleep upstairs. As a result, between having to be quiet to avoid waking the babies and the exhaustion that came with the near-constant cycle of feeding, burping, changing and bathing them, they hadn't had a great deal of time to be intimate; with the colder weather beginning to creep in, and a particularly wet and chilly autumn, October had arrived without John having the chance to show Sherlock something very important. "Close your eyes," he smiled gently, pushing his Alpha down to sit on the end of the bed. "I want to see if you can guess what it is before I let you look." Sherlock would know the instant he touched it, of course, he just wanted to throw the Alpha off the scent a little. Silently, he lifted his thick jumper and his shirt, and stepped forward, pressing the little bump of his stomach, curving outwards with their triplets, into Sherlock's hands.
John moaned in relief as the pumps began to work, his nipples sucked rhythmically futher into the shields, milk spurting into the bottles. "Better," he agreed breathily, fluttering his walls around Sherlock. "God, Sherlock... my belly button is just touching the sheets," he whimpered, pushing back against his mate's slow, gentle thrusts. "You've made me so big... made me need to be milked like an animal." He licked his lips and closed his eyes, mouth hanging slightly open and he exhaled blissfully. "Can't wait until your pups are here, suckling on my plump nipples as I feed them..."
John purred quietly in acknowledgement, not as warmly as he'd purred in greeting for Lestrade, but genuinely nonetheless. It was the Inspector's turn next, and he received the new tie and desktop golf with a wide grin, thanking Sherlock and John separately as Mycroft had. Mrs Hudson was equally delighted with her new dress, beaming at them. "Oh, boys, how on earth did you know my size? And this is one of my best colours!" She patted Sherlock's hand fondly, offering John a knowing smile. He returned it, aware that she would have loved to touch his belly, feel the pups move, but after that first time John knew Sherlock wouldn't allow anyone's hands on John's belly but his own (excepting doctors, of course, medical necessity was a grudging exception). "Your turn, Molly," John smiled kindly, hoping she would like the vintage enamelled compact mirror they'd bought and had her name engraved on the back. The top had a pretty art-nouveau style design with irises and crocuses, purple and white and yellow on a red-and-pink background; the cursive
, John returned huskily, sensing his mate's feelings through their bond.
Mycroft and Lestrade shifted awkwardly; they wanted to apologise to John for what had happened, but had no idea how to begin. The ginger Alpha half-cleared his throat and steeled himself to be brave. "As pack Alpha..." he began softly, but he got no further.
John had looked up sharply when the pressure cooker exploded, but he hadn't flinched, too accustomed to explosions both from Afghanistan and living with Sherlock generally. He stuffed the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and tugged at Sherlock's sleeve, cooing as best he could through his mouthful of chicken sandwich to calm his Alpha, until his mate allowed his burned arm to be examined. John reached out and turned on the cold tap, pushing Sherlock's arm under it and giving him a glare that clearly said
Sherlock rumbled deeply, massaging his seed into the Omega's taut skin. He kissed the next long moan gently from John's mouth, his touches to his middle growing more firm as he tested his mate's response. The Alpha purred lowly, observing his mate with hungry eyes as he stowed each reaction in his memory for future reference.
John asks Sherlock for a divorce
Sherlock purred. He quickly shifted onto his knees again, towering over the Omega, and was mindful to give John a soft kiss as a reward.
"It is completely your choice as to whether you wear them or not; if you choose not to, I will not be in the least offended. But if they are something you might want, you may have them, since I am proud and privileged to have each of you in my pack and would be happy for you to have a symbol of that bond."
John stood beside the chair, rubbing his belly and purring quietly to himself as the Beta took their drinks orders. He was too deep in subspace to follow the conversation; he was simply happy to know his mate was nearby, and rubbed his gravid middle proudly, as if to show off that he belonged to this handsome, virile Alpha, that Sherlock had bred
Sherlock was buying time, too, giving a few more minutes for the additive in the bath to begin taking hold of his partner. He'd already noticed a small spike in temperature; the rest would be soon to follow. The harmless aphrodisiac would also loosen John's inhibitions just a little - as his libido spiked, he'd be carried further into subspace, and relax more about their upcoming activities.
He slid one hand down John's back, pulling aside the black thread of the thong to slowly insert his finger into John's hot, wet entrance.
"Yeah, you did this to me, you made me so ripe and round... your pups Sherlock, I'm having your pups... You gave me thirteen babies, made me grow, all yours..." He kept his slicked breasts pushed together, loving the friction as he felt his mate's thick, heavy cock press along his sternum, lapping at Sherlock's balls as best he could manage. He whimpered at the attention to his sensitive exposed navel, trying not to move or release any of the pressure. "Soon I'll have to lie on my side all the time, huge and pregnant and helpless, relying on you for everything, unable to do anything but eat and sleep and beg to be fucked... too big to move... God, Sherlock, when you come, you'll come all over this big swollen belly you gave me... will you rub your seed into my skin, claim me with it?" he whispered shakily, feeling Sherlock pant and groan above him, squeezing his mate's cock with his breasts.
John began to slide down the stairs, gripping the bannister so hard his knuckles were white. "You don't
Sherlock sent quietly, sighing fondly and closing his eyes as he nursed, settling safe and warm against his mate. He purred as he felt John's hand in his curls.
Sherlock grinned and rolled his eyes. "Please, John. As if I could possibly turn down the opportunity." He began to rub large circles over the Omega's oblong middle, keeping his touch feather-light at first, then adding just a slight, soothing pressure. "If it's any comfort, you were fantastic," the Alpha murmured, nipping gently at his mate's ear. "I'm sorry, however. I did not mean to hurt you." John had seemed fine, had shown no signs of anything worse than a belly ache in his blissed-out, post-orgasmic haze. In fact, the Alpha had been proud of what he'd done to his mate. But ever since the Christmas incident, there was always a niggling worry in the back of Sherlock's mind, an anxiety that he would forget himself and harm his Omega in his eagerness. He sighed softly as he remembered when they had first been looking for houses, how he had denied his mate relief and John had chastised him for the pain it caused.
"It sounds wonderful," Sherlock said, giving his mate a kiss on the cheek. He turned his own computer toward John, revealing a large white house with plenty of windows and a blue-grey roof. "This one has a large kitchen and garden, just as you wanted, though I am not sure there is a perfect room for the nursery." He clicked over to a different choice, a large Victorian Gothic home, made of reddish brown brick. "This one is in Wimbledon. Seven bedrooms, an extremely large kitchen and garden. We could easily convert one of the living areas into a nursery." He watched John's face as he explained, curious as to how his Omega felt about his choices.
