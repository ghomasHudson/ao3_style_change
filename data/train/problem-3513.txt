So, after a few shots of liquid courage, Dean wandered over to the shop, went over Castiel’s file and reviewed the progress on the old Lincoln. With a heavy sigh he picked up the phone and dialed the unfamiliar number listed there under his name.
“Bobby likes to read legends and stories that are likely untrue and just as old as he is.” Dean whispered across the table behind his hand.
Dean held up his hands in surrender, though he was still grinning. “Whoa, no, of course not man. I just…I’m poking fun at an old memory is all, it’s nothing against you.”
Castiel and his friends spent the next 45 minutes touching up on each other’s makeup, taking group photos and downing more shots before they decided it was time to head out. The house wasn’t too far from campus, maybe a 15 minute walk, but since it was cold, Becky begged to call them an Uber. She got her way and the stood outside to wait.
Dean shook of the feeling and made his way to the open seat beside his friend, which also happened to be situated in front of Castiel. Great. Now he’s going to have to deal with the weirdo staring at the back of his head all morning.
“Yup.” Dean sat back down on the couch, slouching in his seat. “So, Mr. Casanova, what are you majoring in? I don’t think we had that conversation.”
Gabriel rolled his eyes a bit too dramatically. “Cas, c’mon! You’re a full-time student working two jobs AND you’re tutoring other students. If anyone needs a break, it’s you.”
As he continued on down the road at a steady pace of 30mph, something, or rather someone, caught his eye off to the right. Castiel looked over and his heart nearly stopped, his breath catching in his throat. It wasn’t just anyone stepping outside of a small, locally owned textiles shop, it was – “Mathew..?” His gaze remained steady on the man he once called his mate as he drove past. Memories of them together quickly flashed together in his mind, all the while his heart raced. What the hell was he doing back in town? As far as he was aware, Mathew had left town altogether.
Dean watched as Castiel began to plate their food, beyond embarrassed by his actions. How could he have allowed himself to stoop so low and make a fool out of himself? “Shit, I’m sorry Cas. I didn’t mean to, I mean, I don’t think I meant to. I don’t really know what I’m liable to say when I’m drunk, I – “
So that happened. For months. We currently have a fic in the Hannigram fandom in the works, but we have yet to post anything. Which means, in the mean time, I am getting reacquainted with this fic! Ive never given this one up, I have come too far to just...forget about it. For a brief time I thought that I could easily just run with a new prompt, flesh out a new fic, but...I really cant do that without finishing this one. And dont worry!!! I have plenty of chapters planned out! I know where I want to go with this. So just, bare with me. ^^;;
There was still that undercurrent of, well, lust between the two. They flirted a lot in the past, shared photos and that one video Cas dare not speak about.
Nothing. He didn’t pick up. Shit, was he being ignored? He was going to try one more time and if there was still no response then Castiel was going to stop trying.
Dean laughed. “Naw, you know how I Like dressing up for Halloween. I just figure with your meager photography skilled you could help me out.”
“Naw.” He brushed it off with a wave of his hand and a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “It’s not a big deal, you don’t need to apologize. Besides, what are families for other than spending most of their time disappointing you and expecting a shit ton out of you at the same time.”
They couldn’t possibly start over. Not with what was inside of Cas. He needed fixing and who knows how long that would take.
Castiel did and was thus hit with a barrage of information about the engine and all the different belts and doo-dads and all the other shit Dean did to the car to restore it into tip top shape after it had been totaled. Most of which flew right over Castiel’s head, but he was content to simply listen and admire Dean’s tenacity and enthusiasm he had for the nearly fifty-four year old car.
Which also reminded him that the dude’s car has been sitting in the shop for three days, waiting on parts and as much as he hated the thought of having to see him again, he was gonna have to. Dean was also going to have to give him a call, update him on what they found.
“Dude, what took you so long?” Sam asked from his spot at the table, his laptop open and his school work laid out in front of him. Dean handed him his coffee and sighed, plopping down in the chair opposite him.
“You can tell your agent you have a place in mind for repairs. Tell em you’ll have it towed to Singer Auto-shop and they should be totally okay with it.”
A moment later Castiel received yet another photo from his mystery friend. This time the man’s cock was free from its confines, strong fingers wrapped firmly around himself. The tip leaking and the sight of that alone fanned the flames within him. He had to – albeit reluctantly – stop stroking himself before it ended too soon. Before he could formulate a reply, Posse Magnet sent him another message.
“This okay…?” Dean breathed, his voice low and husky, and it went straight to Castiel’s groin, desire pooling low, hot.
“You too Cas. Can I call you Cas?” Castiel shrugged in response. “Alright, well Cas, I gotta apologize in advance. Sam’s a huge boring nerd
The whole room burst into cheers, everyone clapped as Dean walked off the stage and weaved his way back to the table, a huge shit eating grin on his face. The next person was called up but they were clearly not as good as Dean had been. Perhaps Castiel was just biased in his opinion.
The phrase replayed over and over in Castiel’s mind. Despite the alcohol keeping him going for the remainder of their stay at The Roadhouse, it still put a bit of a damper on his mood. Even as many went up on stage to sing karaoke, he wasn’t that interested in watching. He pulled out his phone and sent Charlie a few texts.
Dean shrugged his shoulders and slid a hand up Castiel’s chest. He whispered then and nuzzled into his neck, “Yeah, well you smell really good.”
Dean sat down and plated himself a couple pancakes and some bacon. “I don’t see what the big deal is, it’s not like you and I are dating. And, I might add, it’s not like me and Cas dated either. So…” He drizzled syrup over his pancakes.
He thought about it a lot that first night, and refused to talk about it until he could fully process everything. The fact that Dean was in town, has been for an extended period of time it seemed was just beyond his comprehension. It was bound to be a difficult conversation, one he knew Charlie was going to be up in arms about. But he had to tell her, she would want to know.
Charlie looked at him with such sympathy that it made the emotions that were bubbling up inside of him almost too much to bear. She reached out and took his hand. “I understand Cas. What your uncle did, it’s unforgivable.”
He glanced over at his alarm clock, reading the time at 10:23AM. He had auto-shop class at 2PM and God how he really wasn’t ready to deal with all the noise that came with it. He rejoiced when he took notice of the glass of water sitting beside the alarm clock and two Advil pills. “Oh, thank God.” His voice was raspy from lack of hydration, an unpleasant aftertaste of alcohol lingering on his tongue.
Oh yeah, his voice was as smooth as honey. Castiel had almost forgotten just how smooth and deep it was. It took him back, reminded him of their last conversation over the phone…Of the brief video Posse Magnet sent him…Castiel was turned on just thinking about how he sounded just before he came. His body responded with an almost violent need at the memory.
Dean [9:46AM]: Yahh, you’re probably right. Lol So, took me ten minutes to drag myself out of bed and downstairs…Wanted to shower but I don’t know, later lol Too much work to think about.
Castiel watched while Dean pulled up the correct classroom file just before the phone was shoved in his face. “Tell me what you think.” Dean said, a grin plastered on his face.
“Yeah, about that..” Castiel glanced over at Dean to see him idly flipping through his phone. He glanced up briefly, grinning when he caught Castiel staring. He looked away, cheeks flushing pink. “I sorta got in an accident on the way home.”
Dean popped a few of the remaining fries in his mouth. “Well, I gotta hit the head.” He made to stand but completely misjudged just how drunk he was and stumbled.
Becky pressed on. “Give Dean an ultimatum. Find him tomorrow or when you can and tell him he has X amount of days to tell Cas the truth or you do it for him.”
“You know, he told me he wishes he can be with you more than anything, but he can’t be responsible for your happiness if he is not well.” Dean allowed the words to sink in and boy was it unpleasant. He understood, truly he did, but it didn’t make it any less painful. Sam’s next words, however, were like a knife to the gut. “I think you should leave the heavy lifting to his closest friends. Step back, perhaps move on.”
The third however was the one that caught Dean’s breath. This one was a selfie that showcased the masquerade mask he found. It was a bronze color, with an angled cut that covered everything but his mouth. It was fairly simple, but it certainly did the trick.
CasaNova36[9:45AM]: Honestly? I’m not doing all that great. I usually take a shot in the morning before I head out and I’m usually pretty okay. Since I didn’t do that this morning, I don’t know, it’s tough seeing him.
The guy was clearly conflicted over what he wanted and so after sitting on it over-night, Dean decided he needed to inform Sam of the newest developments. “Your omega doesn’t want you.” He blurted out the following morning at breakfast as he shoveled a spoonful of cereal in his mouth.
“You mean to tell me that the alpha you rear-ended is your heat partner’s older brother?” Gabriel questioned, absolutely dumbfounded as Castiel retold the tale the next morning at breakfast. His brows rose in surprise when his brother nodded in affirmation, but a salacious grin quickly stretched across his face. “Oh man, well if this Dean guy happens to look anything like your partner does then…Whew! I’d loooove to be in the middle of that sandwich. Cassie, you lucky duck you.”
Besides, Dean needed to focus on taking care of Sammy anyways. His brother was much more important than a crazy infatuation with some guy.
A calm sort of silence fell between them as they munched on the leftover fries. Castiel could very easily get used to enjoying nights like this. “So, I heard you made out with Lisa at Gabriel’s party.”
After receiving the notification on his phone, Castiel quickly booted up his laptop and plopped down at his desk. He waited with baited breath as the email took its time loading on the screen and when it did he scanned over the pleasantries and clicked the link that was to take him directly to his results. As it turned out, Castiel matched well with three alpha males in the clinic’s registry. He was given brief descriptions of each of his matches down below.
They both laughed and Cas sighed happily, content. He was about to speak up a moment later but Posse Magnet beat him to it.
Well that grabbed his attention. He sat up straighter, focused in on Charlie. “What about Dean?” They were interrupted, however, by the sound of his uncle knocking on the doorjamb, effectively grabbing everyone’s attention.
Dean leaned in and pressed a kiss to the top of Castiel’s head, his eyes shutting tight at the waves of emotion coursing through him. Much to Dean’s surprise and relief, Castiel didn’t pull away. Instead he grabbed a hold of Dean’s wrist and just held on tightly, leaning into his touch.
Nervous energy bubbled up to the surface, causing Castiel to let out a chuckle. There was no way he got the wrong impression. Castiel was straight forward, he had leaned into Dean. He even nodded his head when Dean asked if he could kiss him. He gave Dean all the right signals. But he understood. Dean was clearly embarrassed too and he was trying to play it off like it was all him. He took the blame.
“Yeah, that might be for the best.” She sat up with him. “I uh, Dean, this may not be my place, at all, but I’ve had my share of encounters with men who were, you know, otherwise emotionally preoccupied. Physical release is amazing, you were amazing.” She chuckled at the brief memories they shared together before continuing. “But you should probably go after what you really want instead of distracting yourself away from it.”
Dean shook his head in denial, desperate to get Castiel to see reason. “You can’t decide that for me Cas. What is so bad about you that you think I won’t accept?” He wanted to step closer, to reach out to comfort him in any way he would allow, but uncertainty kept him in his spot.
Castiel[4:22PM]: I’m definitely not the boss here lol. I just go over the numbers and make sure no one is hiding money anywhere.
“Ah, it’s okay. You know how it is. Sometimes shit just happens.” Sure, shit happens, but this was so much more than that. “Well, hey, I might have…You know...Made some comments earlier tonight. I uh, I’m still…” Oh? Dean looked a little embarrassed now. He looked at Cas sincerely, the lines around his eyes softening. “It’s almost been five years man. Seeing you again, here, It’s…I don’t know. I shouldn’t be angry anymore. So…”
They hadn’t said much to each other, a few basic pleasantries, a couple thank you’s and a brief announcement from Mathew that he was planning on selling the house they had once called home and leaving town. To where, he didn’t say, not that Castiel cared.
In a few minutes time, Castiel received a series of three photos in quick succession, each one more breathtaking than the last, the third being a collage of multiple shots. There he was in his Red Hood costume, with the brown leather jacket and black leather pants, exuding raw masculinity in his poses. Whether aiming his two hand guns or simply crouching down on the train tracks. The man was stunning, gorgeous. It was just a shame that his face was covered in all of them, two by a laughing emoticon and the rest by his actual Red Hood mask. The emoji’s made Castiel laugh.
He cranked the engine to life knowing full well he probably shouldn’t drive, but he didn’t care, he needed to find Cas. Thank God he didn’t have to drive for too long as he spotted him fairly quickly, seated on the edge of the curb about a block away. He looked so vulnerable, broken…Dean had done that to him.
Castiel’s smile widens a bit more at the idea. “I do like that sound of that. You’re a great friend Charlie, I don’t know what I would do without you.”
“Apparently you do, otherwise you wouldn’t have stalked me for two days.” Castiel grinned. Satisfied with the dumbfounded look on Dean’s face, he moved to make his way back out onto the sidewalk. A firm hand on his shoulder stopped him from taking another step.
Charlie laughed with a shake of her head. “If you say so.” She helped him bring his bags in and shut the door. “But seriously, a mullet? Last I saw you; you weren’t sporting one.”
“Well then you explain it to me Dean. The fact that you met a guy online who you didn’t know was your tutor until wayyy later is uncanny. Of all the people on that app you could have picked, you happened to pick Castiel, the one person who turned out to be the catalyst for your coming out. Sure sounds like fate to me.”
“Truce.” The corner of his mouth twitched upwards in an awkward smile that he was powerless to stop. He let go of his hand after a moment, the warmth of it lingering there for a bit before it finally faded.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’m sure it was. What I’m actually curious about is how you rear-ended this dashing, older brother.” Gabriel wagged his eyebrows, resulting in yet another eye roll from Castiel. “But seriously. You are literally the safest driver ever Cas, what the hell happened?”
Castiel beamed, his heart suddenly so full. He felt amazing, free, for the first time in a very long time. “You’re incredibly…Sexy.” He commented, his cheeks flushing as he took another step closer, leaving mere inches between them. “What about me? Am I everything you expected.”
Castiel sighed, running a hand over his face in irritation. This wasn’t good, being stranding out here like this. It almost felt like a bad omen of sorts, not that he was a huge believer in anything mystical of course. Anna continued on.
God, this was all too much. The memories rushed back at him, memories he had long since tucked away and move on from. How and why they seemed to affect him all over again as though it only happened last week, he didn’t know. What he did know was that he needed to leave before he did something he was going to regret.
“Jesus!” Dean fumbled the shot as a result. He laughed though. Certainly was a good thing he wasn’t hustling pool right now, otherwise he might have to strangle his best friend. “Damnit Benny!” They laughed as they clapped each other on the shoulder. “I’m good though, I’m good.” He waved to Jo, motioning to Benny a beer and a couple of shots. She nodded in acknowledgment and got to work on their order.
He added the last part as an afterthought, a bit unsure of whether or not he should have mentioned it. But he thought, what the hell, he was feeling good, why not extend a sort of invitation to him? That’s what friends did anyways, right? They got together and hung out.
By the end of the trip, Cas and his brother had a basket full of fake blood, Castiel’s wings and halo, the mask and a few other accessories for Gabriel’s Loki costume. They were ready to wait in the checkout line when something caught Castiel’s eye.
Dean grabbed his food from the cafeteria and found a table, contemplating making a reply to the stranger but opted to send one to Casanova instead.
Posse Magnet grinned at the comment, his tongue briefly swiping over his bottom lip, wetting it. “You’re so much more than what I expected. Seeing you in person, finally, being this close to you…” He placed a couple fingers under Castiel’s chin, lifting it just a little and leaning in close. “…Kissing you back there…I feel the same connection. And I don’t normally do guys, at all.” They laughed quietly together at that.
There was so much he wanted to say but he couldn’t get it out. He couldn’t tell her or Dean how he felt, how what they did was wrong, Cas had no right. They were both consenting adults, they could do as they pleased. Besides, it wasn’t as though Cas and Dean had ever dated, no, not even remotely close.
Castiel chuckled at that, adjusting himself so that they lied a bit more comfortably on the bed. Dean continued. “Her and my dad were really close, they’d have done anything for each other. He changed after it all happened.”
Castiel smiled widely, nodding at the idea. So the pair did exactly as Dean suggested. They went bobbing for apples, which was a bit difficult where their masks were concerned.
And then the get the photos I edited myself? I had to halfway post em on my deviant art XD (I didnt wanna actually post em, just needed the address.)
Uncle Zach sighed and took the set Gabriel had previously occupied, unbuttoning his suit jacket for comfort. He turned to Cas then, observing him, which made him extremely uncomfortable under his scrutiny. He hated when his uncle sized him up like this as though it made matters any easier. “You look like hell kid.”
“Ah…” Cas shoved his hands in his pockets awkwardly after walking her to the door. “Well, I hope you have fun, and be safe, please Anna?” He gave her a pointed look.
As you already know, I was sixteen when I was caught with Alfie in my bedroom. I was living with uncle Zach at the time, shortly after my parents’ passing. My uncle, as furious as he was, lectured me after throwing him out of the house. His voice, I still remember the absolute authority in it. The anger, the hatred. He was a man to be feared; still is…”
“Oh of course! Always.” He took a large swig of his beer. “Do you have any other siblings besides Gabe?”
Castiel stabbed his fork into the last bit of eggs on his plate and shoved them in his mouth, chewing quickly. “It’s fine. You don’t have to worry; I can take care of myself.” He stood and brought his empty plate to the sink to rinse it off and place it in the dishwasher.
I know I havent posted an update in what feels like forever. I went to my best friends place at one point and ended up leaving my notebook over there for a few days before I could go back and get it. Then! I found a fanfic that took up like, three days of my time reading and Im still not finished reading it lol
“Sure as shit he is!” Dean was pretty sure that’s exactly what Cas was doing, or he was just simply rubbing it in his face that he was able to keep a lot of things secret from Dean because of his negligence. Either way, Dean was drunk and was more than likely reading too much into things.
CasaNova36[1:30PM]: I think I found the perfect costume. I couldn’t really find anything angel specific that wasn’t marketed as sexy and I can promise you, you won’t want to see me in a skin tight dress. Lol
He glanced over at Dean who was leaning against the hood, arms crossed over his chest and grinning from ear to ear. “Aint she beautiful?”
Castiel nodded. “Uh, yeah, my sister. Uhm, ignore the mess.” He chuckled awkwardly. God, this was so weird. “My whole life is in that car…So uh,”
Sam let out a breath he didn’t realize he held in. Despite the good news that he wasn’t in any way physically ill, Sam was still very much concerned for Castiel’s wellbeing. “Have you…Uhm, you know – “
Just as Charlie mustered up enough courage to even reach for her door handle, poised and ready to step out of her car, she saw Dean’s door open. She paused and was stunned as she watched Castiel follow Dean out of the apartment.
Dean was at a loss for words, he wanted to try harder here, to convince him to stay, but what else was there to say? Dean was guilty, completely. He had broken his trust, kept Castiel all to himself, selfishly. He had known all along that this would be the outcome of his choices, but being face to face with it, here and now, at the beginning of his recovery…? He couldn’t bare it.
Castiel nodded because yeah, that’s exactly how he felt. “How did you manage to get the okay to fly out?” He asked his sister.
Castiel sucked in a shaky breath, his chin trembling as he choked on the emotion. He shook his head, a tear escaping and sliding down his cheek. He quickly wiped it away. “N-no. I uh…I don’t think it would be wise. My feelings for you, they would just get in the way of any progress.”
Jo took that moment to visit their table, a huge grin on her face. “Dean! Look at you socializing and making friends.” She teased.
“Hey, uhm…So I think I’ll leave you two to it.” Sam stood and crossed the room. He pat Castiel on his good shoulder before taking his leave.
Instead of going home to study or hanging out at the Starbucks before his shift, Castiel sat on a bench in the atrium of the school campus, with his books open in front of him. He found it a little easier to focus on his studying while here on campus, surrounded by other students milling about. The background noise kept everything else at bay, the noise in his head, the constant worries.
Castiel looked away, his free hand wiping away at the unshed tears. Not in public, God, please not in public. If only she really knew the extent of what happened, what he was made to endure at the hands of their pastor. The sick way in which Castiel was made to believe he was inherently evil, that the demons inside him needed to be purged.
“Jesus Charlie!” He laughed. “Uh, well yeah. I needed it. You?” His phone buzzed again and the message left there had him blushing and grinning like an idiot.
There was no backing out now. She needed answers, Cas needed answers. She exchanged looked between Ash and Becky and nodded her head finally. “Yes. Let’s do it.” She scrolled the cursor over to the execute button and clicked it, the screen lighting up and filling with a bunch of code as it filtered through information. Charlie watched it intensely, filled with such determination. She was so close! “Alright Posse Magnet, let’s find out who you really are.”
Charlie watched as Dean yanked the driver door open and climbed inside and from her vantage point, she saw him just crumble and fall apart. He ran his hands through his hair in distress, the look in his eyes full of pain and confusion. He slammed his fist on the steering wheel a few times before coming to rest his forehead against it, knuckles gripping the wheel so tightly that they turned white.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I’ll be back in a moment.” Castiel left for the restroom, thankful of the few minutes he had alone. It was much needed indeed.
The scent of concerned alpha mixed with the sweet scent of freshly baked goods wafted out into the foyer to greet Castiel. Such a mixture usually calmed him on any other given day, but today it barely scratched the surface. He kicked off his shoes and wandered through to the kitchen and plopped down on one of the bar stools at the island counter. He remained silent, all the while his brother Gabriel stared at him questioningly. His brother arched a curious brow, impatient. “You gonna share with the rest of the class as to why you reek of homicidal intentions?”
Sure, he could tell himself over and over that he enjoyed the mystery; and in some ways he did, but was there any real reason why he should continue to drag this out? Especially when certain feelings were reciprocated? They were reciprocated, right?
God, he was gorgeous…So much more so than in his photos. Cas watched the way his lips wrapped around the mouth of the bottle…It was damn near seductive.
Castiel shrugged his shoulders. “I’m not properly dressed for a walk. I just needed to get out of there.”
The minutes continued to tick by and the longer she waited, the more anxious she became. She just wanted to get this done and over with. Just when she was about to give up and drive on home, Dean exited the doors at the main entrance.
Even now, as he spotted the guy sitting under a tree in the courtyard, the leaves above changing colors and breaking free in the gentle breeze, his books splayed open before him; Dean couldn’t resist the urge to go over there and join him. He may have made peace with forgetting anything happened between them, and though there may be a darker side of him that wishes for another chance, he’s actually more than okay with just enjoying the man’s company.
“What do you mean?” He asked, still carding through potential outfits. “Ew, God, who would willingly dress up in that God-awful suit?” Gabe balked, holding out a hideous, rainbow pinstriped suit for a better look.
“Benny! Hey, I thought I saw you come in.” She hugged him, an arm wrapped around his waist, her other hand holding an empty tray. “What brings you into town?”
Castiel smiled and nodded. “Thanks Dean.” And with that he turned away and headed to the customer chairs, his hands shaky as he went to text Anna, hoping she’d be there soon.
Shortly after his conversation with Gabriel, Castiel mustered up the courage to call the Heat Clinic in question. Despite being riddled with anxiety over making the call, the woman on the phone was really helpful in giving a brief overview of the clinics amenities and their mission statement. She was even able to schedule him to meet with their lead Heat Coordinator in two days’ time.
Dean would watch him laugh; watch how his eyes would crinkle at the corners. He tried his hardest to ignore the flood of warmth in his chest as he observed quietly. He tried tamping it down, extinguishing it, but with each laugh and each smile it came rushing back.
He thought about how their first date was going to pan out as he hopped back in his car outside of the Whole Foods Market, all of his errands finally complete, an afternoon well spent being productive. Sam had suggested they keep everything pretty casual and suggested a bar he hadn't been to in a very long time. They could bond over a few beers and some classic bar food. And even though they weren’t dating in any sort of traditional sense, Castiel still felt the fluttering of butterflies in his stomach.
Others joined, people cheered and just as Cas thought about where Posse Magnet might be, he felt a firm hand on his shoulder and warm breath against his ear. “Hello there stranger.”
“Okay, gross. But, yah, well you do make a point there. That’s tough. Just tell him Dean. The sooner the better.”
CasaNova36[8:10AM]: Sounds like you had a lot of fun. I imagine you’ll be pretty hungover this morning.
“You’re telling me!” Castiel chuckled lightly and ran a hand over his face. “It’s fine. I’ll get my car back and that’ll be the end of it.”
He could feel Dean’s fingers twitch slightly against his shoulder a moment before his hand slid to his neck, those fingers playing with the hair at the back of his neck. Castiel licked his lips, itching to touch Dean, to grab onto him too, but he was rooted in the spot, waiting and relishing in the moment.
“I mean, I wasn’t really going to say anything…” Castiel teased, smiling to himself. “It’s okay. I was just, I don’t know.” He let out a long sigh. He better come out with it, get it over with. Otherwise these questions were going to eat away at him. “You uh, you don’t regret what we did last we spoke over the phone, do you?”
Castiel flushed the toilet and when he opened the stall door he was immediately pulled into a tight embrace. “I’m sorry Cas.”
“I need to talk to Dean, right now.” Charlie pushed out of her chair and went to grab her things. She was angry and she was damned if she wasn’t going to do something about it.
So Castiel tried but failed miserably and of course, his friends laughed at his failure. But hey, it was challenging. He couldn’t quite get the whole slurping it down in one go right, so he was left with essentially snacking on the damn thing. This was a bit awkward as he had to maneuver the Jell-O with his tongue in his mouth.
“Don’t worry, she won’t say a word. I made sure of it, so your little secret is safe for the time being.”
He didn’t care if Dean wasn’t yet awake. The man wasn’t quite out of the woods yet, anything could happen and Cas would be damned if he didn’t go to see him one last time just in case.
The sound of keys being shoved into the lock on the front door grabbed their attention. “Shit, Sam.” The door flew open and Dean immediately scooted back and away from Castiel.
Their gazes locked again, the air between them charged once more. There was no question, Dean was really looking at him. “Yeah, I think I might be.” Once more his gaze dipped down to Castiel’s lips and Cas, God help him, Cas wanted Dean to kiss him. Right there in the parking lot on the hood of the Impala.
Afterwards they played a couple rounds of darts, beer pong and they were offered more Jell-O shots. Watching Cas attempt to figure it out was actually quite hilarious.
“I think that just might be wishful thinking. Look, I don’t know how it’s going to turn out when you do talk to him, but Cas likes you, right? Maybe if you explain it to him, he’ll find it funny; kinda like I did.” He took a sip of his coffee. “I mean, seriously Dean, what are the chances here? Sounds a little bit like fate if you ask me.”
Was that selfish of him? Wanting desperately to save face and give up on something he deeply wants in the name of self-preservation? Dean didn’t know what the answer was.
Crossing state lines from Kansas and into Nebraska a few hours later was a pivotal moment for Castiel. He was finally out of Kansas and far away from all the bullshit he endured for much of his life. Sure, it was painful leaving it all behind, as starting anew is always bound to be. His whole life was back in Kansas, all of his triumphs and heartbreaks, all the memories he shared with friends and family. He was leaving it all behind to live in a brand new state.
CasaNova36[3:59PM]: I’d be lying if I said that I didn’t. You look amazing. Why did you unbutton your pants?
But what if Castiel took it all in stride and laughed about the whole thing? What if he actually agrees to hear him out? Shit, who was he kidding? Dean never had such luck.
Posse_Magnet67[3:12PM]: Eh, fuck it. Screw the rules. I uh, I don’t know, I kinda just wanna hear your voice.
So, she went back to her dorm room and pulled open her lap top. A sigh escaped her as she checked her email.
“Yes! Sweet, okay, let’s find you a set of wings then shall we?” Gabriel darted off without another word, searching high and low for the perfect set of wings.
Castiel [9:53AM]: If I remember correctly, years ago, someone sent their brother to get me food because I was terribly sick. I really appreciated it Dean. I want to return the favor.
“Yeahh, think I’m drunker than I thought.” He paused then, noticing the arm wrapped around him. He grinned at Castiel. “You’re warm.”
Something significant must have happened to have triggered this reaction out Dean. She had to go see Castiel, get the story from him. She could only imagine how he was feeling at that moment.
“Okay okay, I’m sorry.” Sam wiped the tears from his eyes. “I don’t mean to laugh, but dude, how the hell did you end up talking to Castiel well before actually, you know, started talking to him? It’s, wow. What a mess.” He chuckled, scratching his head. “Charlie is right though, you know?”
There was a brief moment of silence before Benny erupted into fits of laughter. Dean raised a brow at him. “I’m sorry, I was under the impression that coming out shouldn’t be a laughing matter.”
Castiel – err – Casanova nipped at Dean’s bottom lip and all but growled. “….I want you.” His voice was hungry, needy and damn it if it didn’t turn Dean on something awful. The way his voice deepened with need…Fuck…
You could say that Gabe was the black sheep of the family, but the opposite was actually true. Castiel was the black sheep, his secondary gender being the determining factor from the start. His parents were very old fashioned that way and maybe that was why he felt so strongly about wanting to raise a family. It was bred into him, it was his duty. Anyone smarter would probably have thrown such notions out the window and pursued other ventures in life, but not Castiel. Regardless of whether or not said upbringing was a factor, he still felt the longing deep in his gut, that child-bearing instinct ever pressing the older he gets.
Jo took her leave then to take care of a few customers at the bar, leaving Dean in a sour mood. Perhaps a few shots when Benny finally arrived will do him some good. Jo meant well, she always did. It was just…God, cant everyone just leave him alone about all this? He was pretty sure Benny was going to say something too, tell him to ‘be careful’ like he hadn’t heard it already.
And he had been talking to Castiel this whole time. Did Dean know who he had been talking to? God, if he did, then did that mean he was purposefully playing games with Cas? There were suddenly a million more questions Charlie wanted answers to and only one thing came to mind.
“Well it’s a little late for that now isn’t it? Cas has to know, for his own good.” Charlie let out a dry chuckle. “You’re lucky I found you before I went to him. I would have told him already. But, since I found you I’ll be nice. I’ve giving you three days to tell him. And if you don’t in that time frame then I’ll do it for you. Be smart here Dean, if you love Cas then you will tell him the truth.”
CasaNova36[11:29AM]: It’s not so bad, I keep myself busy. Well, until you came along anyway, it wasn’t so bad.
So, I'm honestly I was able to get this one out as quick as I did. Ive been pretty moody lately and irritated at my boyfriend...for no reason...lol Must be the Mercury retrograde shit going on.
Shit, there was no way he could possibly deny it; he would look even more like an asshole if he did.
Dean checked his phone for probably the fifth time that day, waiting for a message from Casanova. But there wasn’t any. With a sigh, he plopped his book bag down on the couch and slumped beside it.
“Oh whatever!” Dean scoffed at the joke. “Grab a beer, I’m gonna order pizza. You two bond, or, whatever.”
“Alright, fine, so what, the guy happens to be really hot, doesn’t mean I’m interested in all the gross scent bonding and building foundations crap.” He visibly shuddered just to get the point across. Okay, so he was trying to save face here, who cares? It wasn’t that he was against scenting others cause’ he has done it countless times before, but never with the intention to bond with that person, to mate with them. Sometimes scenting another person can act as a high in the heat of the moment, especially if their scent was more than pleasant on the senses. And let’s face it, Castiel’s scent was divine.
Castiel sighed, contemplating his outfit for the fourth time that afternoon. He adjusted the collar on his black button up shirt and ran his fingers through his hair, hoping to tame some of the stubborn curls. “It’s a lot to consider. My people skills are a bit rusty. I – “
Castiel looked so much older, the lines at the corners of his eyes were more pronounced, but nothing more than what was normal for his age…Which, God, how old was he now? 28? 29? He wore the barest hint of stubble as he always had, his hair also styled in the same unkempt, near sexed-up style and he was dressed simply in a dark T-shirt and jeans, a pair of sunglasses tucked into the collar.
He knew Dean was hurting, that he was confused and left in the dark, but it was better this way. He would come to see it eventually, Castiel had hope. It was all for the best.
“What about Dean?” Charlie beat him to it, knowing exactly what the heart of his problem was. Castiel knew he had to face it, but he just didn’t know how. “Cas, I know you’ve had a crush on him for quite some time and I’m telling you, he’s definitely into you. You have this great opportunity to go after something you’ve always wanted, but this other guy…Cas, you said so yourself, he wants to remain anonymous.”
Sam huffed a laugh. “No, Dean. We didn’t meet on a dating site. And we are not dating either. I’m just uh, like I said, helping him out.”
Castiel chuckled to himself and typed it in, writing Dean’s name on both cups. He glanced over at the prep station and motioned to the guy who just finished a few drinks to take over at the register. Castiel took his place and got started on Dean’s drinks.
“It’s fine Dean, don’t worry about it. Take care man.” He slapped Dean on the shoulder and stood to leave, walking away without a backwards glance.
The pair grew silent, Sam at a loss for words. He bit into his burrito but it no longer held much interest for him. Before he could think of anything else to say, Castiel spoke up.
“Naw, its fine. I wanted to.” Dean pressed his shoulder to the door frame, leaning comfortably against it. He wasn’t ready to leave just yet, and if he was reading Castiel correctly, he didn’t appear ready to part either. “I had a really good time last night Cas. Even if I don’t remember a few bits and pieces.”
Dean should hang up. That’d be a dick move too though. Whoever Casanova was, whether it be Castiel or someone else entirely, he needed a friend.
Castiel smiled at the message and pocketed his phone. He finished his Jell-O shot by the time they made it to the kitchen where all the liquor was open for free use. Becky quickly poured them some vodka and orange juice and Castiel took it gladly, the rush of the alcohol as soon as he took a sip rushing through his veins.
Dean’s stomach dropped, dread filling him. “Cas, c’mon man. I hadn’t known it was you…I…I know I should have said something over the phone about it…Cas, please we can fix this. Just give me a chance here.”
“Yes. I’ll only add that in my experience, family isn’t all its made out to be…” He paused as he watched Dean turn back towards him, his body shifting almost imperceptibly close to him. Their knees were pressed more firmly against each other and the warmth was all that much more noticeable, distracting.
The following chapter was a freakin beast to write. I was struggling so hard, but I finally finished it. It was also super freakin long, so I had to take a chunk from the beginning of that chapter and tack it onto the end of this one lol Theyre about the same length in words so that makes me happy.
Castiel shook his head, unsure. “I don’t want to impose. I was just told to come over and say Hi.” Ah, so his friends really did coerce him.
“Yes. I did. I knew if I attended the classes I would be one step closer to them, I’d feel more connected even though they were no longer on this plane.
Dean couldn’t quite fathom his level of confusion. Had someone found out about his account on the chat app? But how? He made sure nothing in his bio would give himself away, right? He searched his profile just to be sure, and no, there wasn’t anything at all obvious there. Hell, even his icon photo was pretty ambiguous.
“You okay Cas?” Charlie asked him, effectively interrupting his thoughts. “You look a bit lost there.”
“Oh he’s great! The little twerp flew off to California to study law at Stanford. Full ride too. He’s got a lot of promising prospects for the future, but damn is he gonna be boring now.” He laughed as Jo returned with their shots, Castiel’s second beer and a few menus.
Castiel was already in class when Dean finally arrived. He spotted him instantly, slouched in his seat with three water bottles set out in front of him. He looked, well, hung-over if the bags under his eyes were anything to go by and it concerned Dean to see him this way.
Castiel sighed. He wanted to tell him not to pry but he honestly didn’t have the energy needed to tell him to butt out. Gabe was his brother and he deserved to know what was going on. Especially after this accident. Cas could have easily died, but shit, Dean still could. He wasn’t out of the woods yet.
He’d sobered up some by the time they walked outside into the cool night air. Anna said her goodbyes to Dean and Cas, well, he wanted to say bye but he was still tongue tied, unsure of what to say or even how to speak. So he opted to follow Anna to the car.
“You haven’t even left yet and I can already smell the confliction rolling off of you. Cassie, you’ve got to relax.” Gabriel grasped onto his brothers shoulders, kneading the muscles there as he looked at Castiel’s reflection in the full length mirror in the hall. “Just meet the guy, go out on a few dates or whatever and go from there.”
With a shrug, Castiel disagreed, his beer poised at his lips. “I don’t know, you don’t look so bad now.” He caught Dean’s gaze as he drank from the bottle, a sizzle of awareness rolling pleasantly down his spine.
Charlie and Becky came back in a moment later, both clearly concerned. “Was that your uncle?” Becky asked him.
Except Castiel was standing in the middle of the living room, having just gathered all of his things. Dean stopped short, disappointed to see the other man so ready to leave.
“Yeah, he’s just in the shower. He should be out soon. Would you like a beer?” Sam asked as he wandered into the kitchen.
On the third day of their cat and mouse game, Castiel was wrapping up his shift at the local Starbucks. He grabbed his things from his locker, clocked out and said goodbye to his coworkers before leaving. He was walking down the street when it happened. A pair of strong hands grabbed him from seemingly out of nowhere and pulled him into an alleyway. He was shoved against the brick wall and a warm body pressed in close to him.
After a few quiet moments to himself, Dean opened his phone and logged into the chat app. He opened the conversation between him and Casanova, his heart hammering in his chest at the thought of pressing that call button. Was this moving on? Calling another guy just to hear his voice, and so soon?
Oh, how Castiel wished it could be true. He wanted Dean with every fiber of his being. But damn it, it wasn’t right. If his uncle ever found out…
That message from Posse Magnet was still there, having been burning a serious hole in his pocket all afternoon.
They reset the table and begun their second match. A real one this time, one that required a level of concentration to play and play well. And that meant no distractions from a certain text conversation Dean wanted to get back to. Apparently he did well because he won the next two rounds. Which was honestly quite surprising considering how preoccupied his mind was. After the end of their technically third game they decided it was time to order some food and chill for a bit.
It was quite cliché really. Castiel had been studying under the big oak tree in the courtyard on campus May of that year, minding his own business when a soccer ball bounced his way and rolled all over his school papers, effectively interrupting and breaking his concentration.
Castiel blushed with embarrassment, but Sam flashed him a brief reassuring smile. “You could say that.” Was all he was willing to elaborate, which was perfect really. Castiel didn’t want his personal business getting out there and becoming common knowledge amongst everyone, regardless of gender and understanding. “Jo, this is Castiel, Castiel, this is Jo Harvelle, Ellen Harvelle’s daughter and my cousin.”
“Wait, you didn’t meet him online, did you?” There was that suspicious look again. Castiel knew she wasn’t judging him for any of this, she just cared about him and his safety. Still, though, Castiel couldn’t help but feel a sense of guilt.
“It’s a really nice gesture, I appreciate it. Thank you Dean.” He opened the driver door and went to climb in. Though before Cas could sit down, Dean came forward and placed a hand on top of the door, stopping him from closing it. Castiel looked at him curiously but they just gazed at each other for a moment that seemed to stretch on forever.
For what it was worth, Dean hoped Castiel found the happiness he deserved; whatever that entailed. Dean wasn’t going to wait; he’s going to move on.
If only he hadn’t rushed things, hadn’t kissed Castiel when he did, maybe then he could have enjoyed his friendship that much longer. “This is really it then, huh?”
CasaNova36[5:03PM]: Almost, about halfway. Joe is, well, he’s insane. But he plays everything off so well.
Castiel wasted no time in taking the photo. It was perfect too, his pants splayed open, revealing a pair of orange colored boxers. His thumb hooked underneath the waistband, pulling the fabric down ever so slightly to hint at what was underneath.
Castiel really did like Posse Magnet though. He was a great guy and he was excited to meet him at the upcoming party, finally, after all this time.
Those eyes though…The piercing blue, even shadowed as they were; they were beautiful. It’d be far too easy for Dean to get lost in them and he wanted to.
“Well that’s a damn lie if I ever heard one.” Gabriel laughed and nudged Dean playfully with an elbow. “C’mon Dean-o. Look, it’s not often that I’ve seen ol’ Cassie smile like he has since knowing you. Whatever you did, you made him happy and that means a lot. To him and to me. Whatever Cas is going through right now, you gotta trust him. He’s a pretty private person and he likes to keep it that way. Like I said, the kid has been through a lot, just be patient with him, Dean. He’ll come around.”
If he just focused his attention on his mystery man he could relax. He could also flirt – albeit horribly – without any real repercussions. Maybe that way he could keep quiet the thoughts that told him wanting Dean was wrong.
(785)555-9201[1:29PM]: It’s Castiel, sorry for the late text. I was busy. We can start your tutoring today, if you like.
Dean [10:08PM]: Oh! I see lol I was wondering…The descriptions confusing. Looks a little raptor like.
But then came the pain; physical pain that tore at his body. His head ached, the side of his skull throbbing, his left arm near immobile and wet withy blood. And his ribs…Fuck, it hurt to breathe. Why did it hurt so fucking bad? There were people surrounding him, at least he thought they were people. Were they angels? Were they going to save him?
Charlie waited until Dean reluctantly pulled out of the parking space, his tires squealing as he floored it. She was ready to leave her car then, ready to race up to see her friend when her phone rang, the caller ID reading “Castiel Novak”. She answered it immediately.
“Tell me about her. What was she like?” He asked him after a while, fingers stroking through his hair.
Benny laughed at the dumbfounded look on Dean’s face. “Shit, sorry man, I’ll pay attention.” Dean chuckled, just a tad embarrassed.
“Sure, but does it matter? Once I’m in the midst of it I don’t think any of the smaller details will matter very much. All I’m going to want is, well, you know.” Castiel received yet another eye roll.
“Did Dean send you over here to question me?” Castiel blurted out as he turned to look at Sam who was now flustered and apparently nervous if his expression was anything to go by.
Dean posed with the gun, pointing it outwards with two hands in one shot, and in another he had it hanging down at his side. “Yeah, I sent Sam over to him with some good ol’ hangover food. Guess I hoped to get more information but there wasnt anything I don’t already know. I don’t want to screw up any of his progress so I’m taking a step back.” At least that’s what he should be doing. And technically he kind of was. He would be anyway if Casanova wasn’t actually Castiel.
CasaNova36[11:16AM]: Idk, I’m in class and I’m trying hard not to focus on the guy I’ve mentioned to you.
Sam shrugged as he dipped a garlic knot into the little ramekin of ranch. “Your calling doesn’t have to be anything work related. It could be volunteer stuff, traveling, it could be painting. Some may even be perfectly content raising a family.”
“Yeah yeah, if I need to yell at someone I will.” Bobby walked through the door, leaving Dean and Castiel alone together. Which, Lord, it was awkward. It was almost five years ago that they last saw each other, neither expecting this sort of reunion at all.
“Well, I’m sorry I’m such a disappointment.” Castiel’s voice dripped with sarcasm. He wasn’t sorry at all. How dare he come in here to visit and instead of inquiring about his injuries he decided to turn this into a teachable moment? Please…
Connecting with Sam had really been a breeze and by the end of it, after they exchanged phone numbers and set a day for their first official ‘date’ – in two days time that Monday - Castiel wondered why he had been so nervous to begin with. Sure, there were plenty of unknowns going into this first meeting and sure, there were many more unknowns he would come face to face with during the following month, but his gut had told him he made the right choice. His other matches would have paled in comparison.
So, he did. He took a large gulp and nearly blanched at the intensity of the liquor. “Yeah, definitely too much vodka.” He coughed.
A crooked grin stretched across his face when he cranked the engine on in his crappy car. There was this new notion of “Fuck It” that he was slowly adopting as he his new mantra and he kinda liked this. This was good, right? It certainly felt good.
Cas nodded and sipped on his whiskey, his mind a whirlwind of complicated thoughts. Although, he will admit that bumping into Dean here, again, was a welcomed distraction, even if it caused more problems to the contrary. He never would have thought Dean worked at Harvelle’s, and yet it seemed to make a lot of sense. Watching him now, the alpha exuded charisma and charm. Everybody loved him and he wouldn’t be surprised if he was tipped exceptionally well.
Then there was when Castiel couldn’t keep his eyes off of him as he played against Benny a few rounds. The few times he glanced over he swore he saw desire in those cerulean depths. Unless that was just the alcohol clouding his judgment. Shit, he had been half tempted to follow him into the restroom and ravish him there in one of the stalls. But he hadn’t and it was probably a good idea too.
“Yes, Castiel, you are a disappointment. I’m beginning to think all we taught you was for naught.” Zachariah spat. He stood to his feet and buttoned his suit jacket. “We’re not done with this conversation.” He added before finally taking his leave.
Charlie still didn’t believe him though. “Yeah, sure. If that were true then why didn’t you stop talking to him the moment you recognized his voice? You should have told him who you were, you shouldn’t continue to string him along Dean, it’s not right.”
“No but I want to…So bad. God, maybe I am drunk.” Castiel laughed, his hips undulating a little with the imagination that Posse Magnet was there, above him, matching him thrust for thrust.
With Dean having left campus at nearly two, Charlie decided it was time to head home herself. She knew Castiel was planning on studying at Dean’s, so it was unlikely he’d be out and about anymore that day. Plus, it was getting cold, autumn was officially in full spring and Charlie wasn’t about to hang around in the cold all evening.
CasaNova36[3:55PM]: Well, when you’ve been through what I have I suppose you kinda have to, or at least try to. Which is incredibly difficult enough. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like quoting what every other ‘positive’ person says is helping much.
She turned to Gabe then, her eyes alight with wonder. “Oh my God, it’s Loki! Huge, huge fan!” She shook ‘Loki’s’ hand vigorously.
“But I don’t really know how to play.” There was that dear in the headlights look again. “And my friends, I should really get back to them.”
Castiel’s brows knit together, concern written on his face. “I said there’s a few chairs near the back we can sit in. Are you okay?” He tilted his head to the side a bit as though it would help him read the other man better and okay, if that wasn’t the most adorable fucking thing ever.
Posse_Magnet67[1:19PM]: Oh! Okay, had me worried there for a sec, lol and sure you can! What’s wrong with Posse Magnet?
Though it was more or less along the lines of what Castiel was going to say, hearing Dean speak them himself broke his heart a little. A sense of guilt welled up within him as he tried to think of something to say in protest, but he came up short. So instead, he offered Dean an apologetic smile before unlocking his car and climbing inside.
“I didn’t realize you were such a stereotypical alpha dick too.” Sam muttered before tossing the remote in Dean’s lap and rising to his feet.
It was fine though. Castiel had crawled into bed and fell asleep soundly and thankfully he went the whole night without a repeat dream of Dean and wandering hands and lingering caresses. A part of him might have been disappointed at the lack thereof if he were totally honest. But, he wasn’t going to be honest, not today. He’ll just chalk it up to the late evening getting to him and making his mind wander to places better left tucked away.
“Okay, well, we’ll just play a practice round then.” Dean grinned. “I won’t get all competitive on ya.” So, Dean went to show him how to line up a shot. He bent over, lining up the queue between his fingers before striking the white ball into all the others. They scattered across the table, a few having rolled into a couple pockets.
“I understand that, I needed the same. But the fact of the matter remains, he continued to pretend to get close to me…I opened up to him, flirted with him, we…We shared photos…All of it.” Perhaps Castiel wasn’t entirely innocent himself. He ended things with Dean on the pretense of focusing on his mental health, but he chose to put it off for some guy on the internet. However, it was still beyond his comprehension that Dean had been the same person. “I can’t possibly trust him ever again, as much as I’d like to try…I need to move on. Perhaps switch schools.”
“What, and miss out on a chance to fluster you? I don’t think so.” Dean shoved a few more fries in his mouth.
Dean [9:54AM]: You still remember that? Okay, if you insist. I’ll take a chicken quesadilla and a quesarito.
Dean was floored. His eyes scanned over the messages, rereading them and even when he was finished, he was still very much in disbelief. There was no way, did people really do that still? It can’t be legal. He sat back in his seat; his food shoved away on account of losing his appetite which didn’t happen very often.
Castiel shrugged. “Last I heard they had him in a medically induced coma. So…Brain trauma. Gabe,” He turned to his brother again. “Could you go visit Dean? Check on him? I won’t be able to…They want to take me in for a CT scan later today.” He hoped it all will check out okay and he’ll be discharged soon after, God willing. Besides, he wanted to see Dean; he needed to see him to know he was still alive and breathing. He just hoped Dean would recover well enough so that they could talk.
Bio: The name’s Arthur Ketch. I’m the oldest of five siblings with a huge family full of aunts, uncles and cousins. I’m a lawyer at my own firm I built with the help of my father.
Despite everything, being in that car accident shifted things. A part of him really wanted to go back on his word and work things out with Dean; seeing him beaten and broken made him feel all sorts of things and for a moment while he was stuck in the crumpled Impala, he wanted to forget about all the shit Dean has done and forget about his betrayal, patch things up.
“You know Sammy, if you don’t mind your own business, I’ll tell all your friends you didn’t stop wetting the bed until you were twelve.” The look on Sam’s face fell.
Tentatively, Ash clicked the Facebook link and they were instantly redirected to the page’s owner. There he was in his profile photo, Dean Winchester, leaning up against his precious Impala. It was the very same profile Charlie had found before getting Ash involved.
“Uh, sure.” Cas went to fish the keys out of his pocket when a loud, irritated voice grabbed his attention.
A part of him hoped that maybe he could apologize and start over with Dean, pretend as though nothing happened. Maybe Dean would agree to take it slow.
“Yeah.” Dean scoffed. “So everyone has been telling me. I just thought, I don’t know, maybe you could tell me something different.”
Castiel glared at her, defensive. She apologized instantly though, because yeah, it was a little uncalled for, even though he knew her to be absolutely right. But still, it was a Halloween party, Castiel was supposed to have fun. He was going to have fun. “I’m sorry Cas. I just worry about you, you know? And hey, if you need any backup when you do meet this guy, if he turns out to be a creep, I’ll be there.” She smiled at him reassuringly, which actually helped a little.
Benny blinked a couple times, confused, unsure whether or not he heard correctly. “Wait, wait. Come again?”
She was right, there was no question about it. He needed to do this, tell him everything before he found out from someone else. But what about the outcome, how would he react? Dean already knew the answer to that but accepting it was a whole other issue. “Can you give me until the Halloween party?”
“No. I need to work on myself; I need space and a therapist, a good fucking therapist if I’m to find my peace again. I’ve distracted myself for far too long.”
“Huh? Yeah, no I’m fine.” He fixed her with a reassuring smile but it didn’t exactly fix the warring emotions on the inside. Charlie for the moment looked as though she was going to say something else, the look on her face a bit serious, but Becky and Gabriel interrupted her with a photo request.
Sam asked, if a bit warily. If Dean had to guess, Sam was hoping for a ‘no’. Whelp, unfortunately for him, that wasn’t the case.
Dean ran his fingers through Castiel’s hair and he pressed himself close. Oh, how he didn’t want to part, not yet, not while his response to him was so intense, real. Who would have thought he could kiss like this?
A part of him was a little disappointed that Dean wasn’t a volunteer at the heat clinic and another part wondered then that if he were, would he and Castiel have matched at all?
Castiel snorted at the claim. “Oh, right, cause’ I claimed that you were the last time. For the record, you actually were stalking me. For two and a half days.”
The sexting that he had initiated was without a doubt, insanely arousing. He never thought in a million years that he’d ever involve himself in such a thing. Fuck, and he did, with a man he never met. Any other normal, rational thinking person would be more inclined to know the other person in real life, trusting them before engaging in that sort of activity.
Dean continued to think on it on his way to meet Benny for his Halloween photo-shoot, already dressed head to toe in his Red Hood costume. He knew deep down that none of this was going to last, this thing with ‘Casanova’, that someone was going to get burned once everything was revealed.
“I don’t think that’s really a…Hey! Maybe if you ask Ellen really nicely she’ll let you into the back and show you the CCTV footage herself. Told her to bookmark it…Hope she did.”
Castiel finished his meal and tossed the empty wrapper in the bag, relaxing then on the couch, full and satisfied.
Charlie shrugged as she typed away at her keyboard. “As serious as a heart attack. Besides, he owes me one.”
Hell, even seeing Dean and serving him his coffee the previous morning had affected him more than he though it should. Talking to him brought back everything he had felt for the man and it was all just so conflicting. Castiel’s head was swimming and he just needed something to hold on to so he wouldn’t drown underneath it all.
Dean nodded. He went for another chicken wing and dug in. “I think so.” Damn if this place didn’t make the best fucking wings ever. Their waitress returned a few minutes later which he tore into that too, gulping it down as though he were dying of thirst.
“Do you…” Dean took a moment’s pause, gathering his thoughts. “Uhm, tonight was fun. We should hang out more often.”
While Cas, Charlie, Becky and Ash were taking everything in and getting their bearings, a girl in a skimpy nurse outfit walked up to them with a tray full of Jell-O shots in the shapes of brains and real hearts.
“That’s true. Gabe is a Godsend. If it weren’t for him I…Well, never mind. Long story.” He offered a sheepish smile and only then did he realize just how close they were. They faced each other, both with a leg curled up on the couch, knees touching. Castiel could feel the warmth through his jeans from the small bit of contact, the heat travelling up the length of him.
When Castiel didn’t say anything, Dean continued. “I couldn’t save her…I tried to, but I was shoved…Hit my head.”
“Well,” Ellen began. “I had hoped for some grand babies, but all can’t get what we want, now can we?”
“Is there a reason why you’re here? I’m in the middle of studying right now.” He turned to Gabe, a look of pure annoyance on his face.
Castiel hung his head. “Right.” A casual fever to start, mild mood swings, haphazard nesting with zero finesse and the sexual bit was no more intense than when Castiel regularly felt the need to masturbate. A simple means to an end really.
And Charlie first needed to formulate her own message to attract his attention, which she hasn’t done yet. She wasn’t even sure what she should say to begin with. Moreover, she was nervous going forward with it for Castiel’s sake. She hadn’t told him about any of this, about discovering who Posse Magnet was.
“My car!” Dean laughed. “Besides, I’m pretty sure you have some apologizing to do, what with you hitting her and all.”
“Gabe, I get you want to help, but I want to pick out my costume. Besides, nothing here looks good. Its either too unrealistic or, well, like that suit there; God awful.”
“One hundred percent positive.” Dean took his shot, shooting it back with minimal effort. Benny followed suit.
He sent the text and went about his morning. He flipped on the water in the shower and hopped in, brushing his teeth in the same instance to save time. By the time he made it downstairs dressed in a freshly pressed blue button up, dark blue tie and black slacks, Anna was already on her way out the door, talking about how late she was going to be.
“There’s the spirit!” Gabe reached out and helped Castiel raise his drink to his lips. “Now drink up baby bro!”
“Alright!” Dean announced after he hung up his phone. “My uncle is on his way. He’ll get us both rigged up, so we can just hang tight.”
Castiel chuckled at that and stepped much closer. He reached out to tentatively touch her flank, his hand gliding over the roof of the car. God, last he saw the Impala it was crushed, totaled, and he thought for sure it was beyond repair. He peered inside through the passenger window to see that everything was how it should be, how it was before the accident. Cas recalled seeing Dean stuck in the driver’s seat, limp and bleeding, a sight that had haunted him for quite some time.
Charlie and Becky came over that last night to ensure all was taken care of with his apartment. They made sure it was cleaned and anything that he didn’t need to take with him was promptly tossed away. His car had been packed that night, nearly full to the brim with a few duffel bags full of clothes, some boxes that held his book collection, a few blankets, a pillow and a few other boxes that held some personal affects.
CasaNova36[4:53PM]: Yes, much better, thank you. I felt like death for most of the day but after some much needed rest and food, I’m okay. Still tired.
This was different, however. This was Posse Magnet. He could feel the connection between them, could feel the chemistry…Cas could feel Posse Magnet’s hands on his waist and in a strange way, there was a familiarity in the touch. He was comfortable with it, more than comfortable it seemed because he swayed into him, his hand sliding up his chest and to his shoulders. His fingers itched to pull the hood down to his shoulders. The man had to be dying of a heat stroke under the thing.
Castiel shook his head. “No Dean, I know what you’re gonna do…You’re gonna try to make me see your side…I cant.”
“If you don’t want to talk then that’s fine. At least let me see you safe home, man. Cancel the Uber.” He pleaded. Castiel took a moment to think it over, but finally he pulled out his phone and canceled the Uber before climbing into the passenger seat of the Impala.
Castiel looked damn good...Happier, if a bit stressed about his car and surprised by his presence. For whatever reason, the thought of Castiel being happy without him, of finding happiness where Dean wasn’t, hurt. His gut twisted at the old notion that he had been nothing but a poison in Castiel’s life back in college.
The pair made it inside and up a few floors by way of the elevator, each step that brought them closer to Castiel’s room had Dean’s heart beating faster and faster. He had this one opportunity, one more chance until God knows when, and this time he wasn’t going to screw it up.
Leave it to Cas to hit the nail right on the head. Dean couldn’t really deny it either; it was true. “Well…Okay, maybe.”
“I need to get laid.” Dean muttered to himself with a sigh as he grabbed his phone off of his nightstand. He opened the campus app and signed in, sending Casanova a quick message.
Dean chuckled when she reached for the belt buckle on his jeans, his hands stalling her for just a moment. “Easy there sweetheart. We could easily get caught out here.” He glanced around the near empty parking lot outside the bar they just left. There were a few other cars left, so chances are of someone catching them was fairly high.
It had been a couple days since Dean spoke to Casanova over the phone, and well, he was still freaking out about it, how quickly things escalated and got heated. He just couldn’t stop himself that night, how could he though when Castiel made those kinds of noises?
So, he did. He walked over to the door and reached for the handle, but Dean’s voice stopped him. “She was murdered.”
Dean shrugged his shoulders. “Well you know how it goes. We were great together, but sometimes you just don’t see a future with the other person.” He chanced a glance at Castiel, the elephant in the room once again peeking out from behind the curtain of liquor. “But it’s fine. It was mutual anyway. We’re good friends now, what more could we ask?”
The climbed into the Impala and headed out onto the road. It was a fairly quiet ride and Castiel thought for sure that everything was ruined between them. But then he caught Dean’s gaze, the man smiling wide. It was beautiful and seemed to lighten the mood entirely. Castiel couldn’t help but smile in return.
Dean laughed, shrugging his shoulders as he threw open the driver side door to his car and climbed in behind the wheel. “Yeah well, this time is going to be different. I’ll kick both of your asses!”
Jesus, keeping this call professional was way too awkward. It wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable, it was just…They had history. So the need to keep things professional was just weird.
Terrified, but in the best possible way, Castiel opened the video and what he saw was beyond words. There he was, his online friend, stroking himself nice and slow. It wasn’t long as all before he was picking up the pace, the sound of slick skin on skin reaching the phone’s speaker.
Whatever they had all those years ago, it definitely didn’t end on good terms and Castiel had been riddled with guilt and regret for the longest time. Now, standing in front of Dean with nothing but a counter between them, Castiel was suddenly struck with the reminder of that regret.
He did too, Charlie having been nothing short of an amazing to him over the past few years. “Well, I’m not sure, perhaps I’m over-analyzing, but that night, I think he tried asking me out. He wanted to ask me a question but what he said was in no way a question. It was rushed.”
Dean shook his head of such thoughts as he ran the soap sponge over the flank of the Impala. Nope, he couldn’t allow Sammy and his crazy accusations to be right. Castiel was Sam’s omega and Dean was going to be the good big brother that he always is and stay the hell out of it.
“Hello.” Was all he could get out before he was whisked away deeper into the crowd.  Rihanna’s song “Only Girl” started playing, the crowd cheering in approval. Posse Magnet pulled Castiel close and they danced along to the music, their bodies flushed together. In any other case, Castiel would have never allowed a stranger to whisk him away from his friends, let along dance with the fellow.
“Well, is there anyone you’re interested in?” Because there is no way Dean could come up with such a conclusion if he wasn’t.
“Shit…” Break? What exactly did he mean by that? “Is that…Is that what happened with the other guy?”
Castiel never did receive a reply from Dean for the rest of the night, which had Cas wondering if he had gone too far with his comment about Dean’s eyes being ridiculously green. As he readied himself for bed he thought long and hard about their conversation. It certainly had bordered on flirtatious, but Cas was only being friendly, there was nothing wrong there.
To be honest, Dean never really noticed the guy before until he spoke with is advisor a couple days ago. He was shown a photo which helped jog his memory a bit, and if that memory served him correctly, he ascertained that Castiel was quite the nerd who stared at people too intensely.
The women in Sioux Falls were something else and he’d be a fool not to bite. So Dean indulged, fell back into his old ways, and hell, he even full on dated a girl for a food year and a half; his longest relationship to date.
“Yeah well, I figured you probably shouldn’t drive any more than you already have.” He chuckled. “Make yourself at home Cas.”
“What…?” Mate? Oh..shit..Jesus. Sometimes he forgot he still harbored the scar from his scrubbed bond mark, the damn thing only stood out like a sore thumb. It was often pink in color whenever the skin decided to act up, most of the time is was a light brown color whenever it decided to cooperate. Either way, it was embarrassing whenever someone noticed it was scrubbed. It was one thing to know you were damaged goods, but seeing it reflected in someone else's eyes was another thing entirely. Castiel flushed with mortification as he went to touch the mark on his neck, the skin raised and a little tender. “Uhm, no that was my brother, he sent me out shopping for him and I was on my way home when I hit you.”
And Dean really didn’t want to call him, dreaded it really. Just the thought of hearing Cas speak over the phone reminded him way too much of the last time they spoke over the phone. If he had to make a guess, he was sure the last they spoke they had gotten off together to an unreachable fantasy.
“What, and you don’t have any? Come on Dean, everyone has baggage, that doesn’t mean you should judge people for it.  How well do you even know this guy?”
I hope you all enjoy this chapter! Its very quite and shorter than most of the other ones, but I wanted to get this one out for you guys as soon as possible.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Okay Mr. Lafitte, you big cuddly bear. That’s easy for you to say. Feelings just complicate things, hence me and Cas.” He struck another pose, this time crouched down. “I’m better at picking up hot chicks at bars or parties than being committed to one person.”
Dean threw his head back and laughed some more. Jesus, this man was positively adorable when he was flustered. “Its fine, man. Come on, I’ll take you to her. Gabe?”
Castiel grabbed his phone and turned off the alarm. He checked his messages but there was nothing there waiting for him. Curious, he decided to send a message himself. You know, so he knew Dean made it home okay.
“When did you find out Dean? When?” Shit, what did it matter anyway? Dean still fucked up, royally. It made Cas sick and it made him want to cry.
“Hey! Buddy, did you hear me?” The stranger’s voice cut through his panicked musings, the look in his green eyes commanding. “I asked you for your insurance information.”
Posse_Magnet67[3:52PM]: Why don’t I go first then? I can promise you I’m not some overweight old man living in his mom’s basement somewhere lol
“So, what did ya get me?” Dean grumbled as he sat up right and leaned forward, the sound of the bag being emptied having grabbed his attention.
“Ah, nothing important really. I uh, I should probably get going though.” Pamela’s face fell after that, but she nodded in understanding. She had known exactly what this was when Dean sought her out, it was just a one night stand, something they both needed. It was best for Dean to leave while he could.
So then did Castiel experience conversion therapy? Did he personally witness first-hand the horrible treatment countless other people have? He thought about the way Castiel reacted to him when they kissed, how he suddenly seemed like a different person, how he shoved Dean away when just moments before he had pulled him close as though his life depended on it. Was that a direct result of the so called therapy he was forced into? Had Dean triggered it?
Dean laughed too. “Yeah, I guess it doesn’t really have the same ring to it as ‘Mr.Casanova’ does. I don’t know man; wish I could give you an actual name; don’t want to reveal too much before the party.”
“So you…You knew…” His voice shook. “For almost two weeks. You dragged this out, made me out to me a complete and utter fool.”
Hearing Dean reference back to that moment had Castiel’s face heating up in an instant. Just hearing him make a mention of it made it all the more real. “Oh, uhm, you mean…?” Even Cas couldn’t say it, not without his whole face turning red with embarrassment.
Shit. Castiel paled at that. He hadn’t known much about his father, but shit…He was no better than Uncle Zachariah by the sounds of it. “I’m sorry Dean, that’s…That’s really shitty.”
“Pretty well actually, all things considered. Uh, my car sorta broke down along the way, so I had to get that fixed. Uhm, there is something that I do need to talk to you about though, nothing major, perhaps some advice? And I’ll pay for this call if you me to uh – “
However, the night came to a close, Becky and Charlie expressing their need for sleep. Benny was ready as well, the only two not ready to go was Dean and Cas. Everyone knew it too. They were so hesitant in wrapping things up. So as though the fates were scheming to tempt Cas, Becky and Charlie offered to take Benny home so the two could have more time together. As though it were a good idea.
Castiel sighed, frustrated. She made a point, he had deserved that much. However, he was still upset that she had gone behind his back, snooped around when he told her not to. There wasn’t much to be done about it now though; everything was already out in the open. Besides, Castiel would have found out eventually, Dean would have revealed himself sooner or later. He just wished it had happened sooner…Maybe then they wouldn’t be in the hospital, banged up and broken from a car wreck they barely survived.
Castiel wasn’t really one to drink in excess, especially around countless other people. But it was a party his brother helped plan and he figured one or two drinks couldn’t hurt. Castiel obliged and took a sip, his nose scrunching up again. “I think there’s too much vodka in this.”
Dean wet his lips, ready to give in to temptation when the meat steadily cooking on the stove began popping and sizzling loudly. The intimate spell they were under broke in an instant and as unfortunate as it was, it was probably for the best.
“I’ve been doing no such thing. I’ve been busy.” He half lied and once again was surprised at how calm he sounded.
Instead, they finished their meal and watched one more episode of The Office before Castiel decided it was time that he headed out; as loathe as he was to do so. He had thoroughly enjoyed Dean’s company that morning. It brought him back to much simpler times where everything felt fresh and new. Exciting. And in many ways it was still just that. Fresh and exciting. The possibilities between them endless.
CasaNova36[1:45PM]: I don’t know how professional it will be, but I’ll help in any way that I can. What did the messages say?
Castiel’s door came into view and though there wasn’t anything inherently special about a plain, wooden door, it was the possibilities that stood behind it that had Dean feeling a bit nervous, jittery perhaps. “Is this you?”
“Yeah.” Castiel kicked the door closed as Dean was still hanging onto him. “This one decided to get wasted.”
With a huff he decided he was going to have to improvise. But what would male angels even look like?
“I just…This is really nice; the food, the hospitality, I appreciate it. I just don’t think I deserve such kindness.”
There was one main thing Charlie happened to notice while she was out following Dean. For someone who didn’t bother much with social media, he sure as hell kept his eyes glued to his phone a lot. What the hell was he looking at if it wasn’t a social media account?
When Dean ventured back out to the front, on his way back to the shop, he spotted Castiel walking in through the door. Oh, shit, that’s right. Castiel’s car was finished. He’d almost forgotten about the voicemail he left him and how cringy it sounded.
Dean took a moment to think about it, Castiel in black rimmed glasses and a sweater vest, commanding a class full of students. He stared at Castiel from across the table, observing him; that dark messy mop of hair, his strikingly blue eyes, and not to mention the deep baritone to his voice when he spoke. Now, Dean wasn’t gay by any means, he never really even gave his sexuality a second thought, but he had to admit, Castiel was oddly attractive. Why some woman hadn’t snatched him up yet he had no idea.
Cas sighed and licked his lips, wondering where he should even start. There was so much, so much he needed to get out but He couldn’t. His throat locked up and tears filled his eyes again. “I…I…I don’t know what to do Gabe…” He choked out. “I…I trusted him.”
“Yeah, so I’ve been doing that for a while and even more recently I  enrolled in school to one day become a doctor. I underestimated how taxing it was all gonna be.” Sam chuckled with a shake of his head. He took a sip of his beer and hummed in approval, his shoulders relaxing as he slouched just a bit in his seat. Castiel could smell the sense of relaxation coming from the alpha across from him and wondered just how much free time the guy even got. Probably not a whole lot if he had to guess.
“Yeah, okay, you don’t have to lie to me.” He gave his brother a few teasing nudges on the shoulder.
Castiel, again, wanted to reply, but this time he couldn’t with Charlie standing there in front of him, staring at him curiously. “Who you texting, Romeo?” She asked him, nudging him with an elbow.
Dean licked his lips, inching slightly closer. It frightened Castiel, his heart pounding so loudly he was surprised Dean couldn’t hear it. Despite wanting all that he couldn’t have, Castiel turned away to collect himself. “It’s getting late. I should get back. I have work tomorrow morning.”
Did that mean that Castiel liked him too? All the signs were there. But then again, even if Castiel had leaned into him and tilted his head, urging Dean, he could have just been caught up in the moment. Besides, who wants to be with him anyway? Romantically speaking.
Dean had the mind to wait for a reply, if Casanova was still awake, but he passed out right after hitting send, his phone still clutched in his hand.
Well, what he could do is forget it ever happened, or just never bring it up. It was a smart move, Dean thought, to ignore it, bury it deep down. Avoiding Castiel would help, though he just wasn’t in a position to do that. Which reminded him…
Gabriel shrugged, finishing his whiskey in one go. He glanced at Dean, the suspicion still evident, but not much. “Are you sure you didn’t do anything?”
Heat instantly suffused his cheeks and he quickly glanced away, a smile threatening to take shape. Okay, so maybe he didn’t mind all the flirting. Besides, Dean was drunk, all manner of things tended to come out when someone was under the influence.
The rest of the meeting went really well after that. At one point Naomi had to excuse herself to tend to some sort of matter briefly, leaving Castiel alone with Sam. It wasn’t nearly as awkward as he would have expected it to be. Sam had apologized for Naomi’s overly clinical attitude when it came to something that happened to be an incredibly important factor to an omega’s life. It was just how she operated in all aspects really, Sam had explained.
“Not to worry Castiel, Dean’s single.” Benny teased once more, awarding himself another kick in the shin. The bruises will be totally worth it.
Castiel sent a picture message right afterwards so that Dean could see what he was trying to describe.
As it happened, there was a bit of a line, but it was fine. Dean pulled out his phone and scrolled through his Facebook, halfway tempted to text Casanova, to see how he was doing, but was suddenly reminded of the stranger who claimed to have a crush on him. Dean never did receive a reply, which was odd he supposed…It’d be nice to get answers to that question, but oh well; he had other problems he needed to handle right now.
“You watch your tone with me boy! If you hadn’t decided to go home with the boy, none of this would have happened!” Zachariah bellowed, his voice booming throughout the room. He relaxed in his seat and straightened his tie. “I knew I should have never allowed you to attend such an institution. Should have sent you to a private Catholic school when I had the chance.”
I do wanna warn you guys that there is some mental trauma that is expressed in this chapter so I do apologize in advance if its triggering in any sort of way.
“Like hell you are.” Dean looked angry, frustrated. They stared at each other for one long, intense moment before Dean finally let go and took a step back.
Castiel nodded. “I think I know who you’re talking about. I don’t quite remember her name, but I do recall Gabe telling me about the fist fight he had over her. They broke up soon after.”
“Thanks Dean. You really didn’t have to.” He smiled anyway and took a sip. “Oh! Dean, Benny, this is Charlie,” He gestured to a fairly tomboyish redhead with an infectious smile.
Castiel turned to his sister, an irritated look on his face. “Anna, you don’t understand. You…You cannot convince that this ,” He indicated between her and Dean. “is a good idea. I…You know what he did right?”
Sam nodded. “By marriage, but yes. My uncle and Ellen became a mated pair ages ago, been together ever since.”
In that moment Castiel didn’t care, not about what he went through, the torture, the pain and anguish. He didn’t care about any of it. All he knew was that he wanted this man, whoever he was. It was unfair.
“Oh sure, like no one has ever brought you back to their room before.” Castiel rolled his eyes. He was teasing Dean, making it clear that he saw right through him. He didn’t make a move to stop him from following though.
How could he have allowed this to happen? What is really him that pushed Dean away like he did? The moment replayed itself over and over and the more he thought on it, the more aware he was that he was definitely not in control of his own body. If he wasn’t so fucked up, he would have never rejected Dean like that. He was supposed to be happy God damnit! They were supposed to have declared their affections for one another, to bask in the afterglow of finally coming together. Castiel was supposed to be happy. He wanted to be happy…
“Yes.” She nodded with a shit-eating grin. Oh, she was loving this. “What if Cas has been talking to Dean this whole time and he doesn’t know it?”
“Whoa! Hey, no need for violence.” Dean protested. “Look, let me explain. I get you’re angry, but none of this was an intentional slight against you man. I didn’t know she was your sister. If I had known I would have walked away.”
Perhaps Castiel had wanted to kiss him at one point, but when face with reality and being interrupted he realized that it had been a mistake. Fuck, Dean was such an idiot. “No, Sam. I don’t think he does.”
“Well sure, of course he doesn’t. But, it’s weird now.” She chuckled dryly. “Don’t you think? I mean, come on, Cas was in love with you once upon a time. I personally feel like I’m crossing some lines here.”
“Yes.” He replied; as a matter of factly. “I worked hard for my anger. Of course I’m gonna hold onto it.”
“The whole time I was talking to Casanova, I had no idea it was even Castiel until a few nights ago. I called him, on the app, recognized his voice instantly.”
The coffee began to spill over the rim of the mug which helped break Dean out of the trance he was in. “Shit -!” He cursed as some of the liquid burned his fingers.
“So Dean,” Jo began as she handed him his beer. “You didn’t tell me your friend that lives here was Castiel.” A few hours had passed and Dean found himself waiting for Benny to arrive at The Roadhouse. He busied himself with a couple quick rounds of pool, conversing with Jo whenever he had the chance.
Castiel smiled at the two in their respective boxes on his screen. “I really miss you guys. When are you coming up to visit me?”
When Sam finally returned home, Dean was right there, waiting a little impatiently for an update. And by impatient, that meant following his brother around the apartment but playing it off like it wasn’t a big deal. But it was. He had to know how Castiel was doing and as much as he had wanted to be the one who delivered the hangover food, Dean was sure Cas would have closed the door in his face.
Dean helped Castiel with the kitchen after they were finished eating. The leftovers were put away and the dishwasher was filled. By the time everything was done, Dean had a couple hours before he needed to be at his auto shop class.
“Essentially. That’s what it feels like anyway. What I don’t get is how can they determine the best partner for me by the answers I give them? Like, take this question for example: How often would you say you masturbate?” Castiel laughed and shook his head. “What difference does that even make?”
However, it was another thing entirely to prepare yourself to meet someone under the pretense of finding a heat partner. Again, do you forgo your scent blockers? Considering the circumstances, shouldn’t you want to leave your blockers at home in order to enhance possible attraction? The whole point of this was to ensure that your partner will be interested enough to assist during a heat cycle.
“Gotta put on that southern charm in order to win her over.” Dean grinned. His phone buzzed in his pocket with a message from Cas.
That seemed to catch Gabriel’s attention. He sat up straighter in his seat, fists clenched. “What did he do? Do I need to actually kill him this time? I will, I can promise you that.”
They reviewed what Dean already knew, refreshed his memory and Castiel went over the note written in the notebook. Dean did his best to pay attention and absorb the information Castiel was giving him but it was still proving difficult.
“No, he doesn’t. He’s just being nice.” Both girls rolled their eyes in feigned annoyance. Well, perhaps their few observations held some merit as he didn’t exactly believe his own words himself. Still, Castiel was skeptical.
Castiel shrugged. “I don’t know. Bobby, the owner, was taking care of me when Dean walked out of the shop room to complain about something. I uh, trust me, I wasn’t expecting to see him. Ever.”
After he sent the text, Dean threw his trash away and pocketed his phone before clocking back in. Castiel hadn’t replied right away, perhaps he had succeeded in flustering the man and rendering him speechless. Twenty minutes later however, when Dean was lying underneath a client’s car, covered in oil and muck, he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He finished what he was doing and slid out from under the car. He wiped his hands on a nearby rag before pulling out his phone and snickering at the message left for him.
“Whole lotta help you are.” Dean scoffed, turning back to his drink. “Shit, I’m pretty sure we’re not even on speaking terms right now. The dude won’t look at me.” The more he thought about it the more he fixated on the idea that he had to have done something wrong here. Was Castiel telling the truth or was he just saying those things to avoid any further confrontation? Either way, it was unlikely he’d ever get answers at this point, what with Castiel avoiding him like the plague now.
Of course Castiel didn’t reveal too much to Sam out of fear of seeming desperate. He supposed in a way he was, but what could an omega do? Especially one such as him. Omegas were meant to take care of the home and bear as many pups as they could, and if they couldn’t hold up that end, they were usually seen as less than in society’s eyes. It may be the twenty-first century, and there may have been quite a lot of progress made in terms of equal rights and acceptance of those who went against what was considered ‘normal’, but there were still plenty of alphas out there that would leave at the first sign of failure.
A few minutes ticked by before his phone chimed, signaling the arrival of some photos. He opened the thread and grinned at the three photos there. The first one had Casanova standing in front of a mirror with his face edited out for propriety sake. He was dressed in a nice suit and sporting quite the trench coat over the top. The second photo showed a much better view of the wings on his back, which seemed to fit him perfectly.
The rest of her basic online research was fruitless. Dean didn’t have a twitter and while he did have an Instagram, it appeared he gave up on it almost as soon as he made it. So, day two of waiting for a reply from Ash consisted of tailing Dean around campus.
It was late that evening that Castiel set up a video chat with Charlie and Becky. He missed their faces terribly and if he couldn’t see them right now in person then this was the next best option. Besides, he was positive they were going to want an update on the situation with Dean; Becky especially. She was a sucker for stories like this.
“Hey, I thought you were going to talk a walk.” Dean sat down beside Cas on the front steps, keeping a good foot and a half distance between them in case Cas still wanted to throttle him.
Castiel looked confused a moment, his head slightly cocked to the side. And if Dean didn’t know any better, it looked as though he were embarrassed as well. It was kind of cute if he were honest. “I’m not afraid of that.”
He thought about how they had come so close to making out on his couch, how close they were. Castiel wanted him to kiss him, had nodded his head when Dean asked if it were okay. God, how Dean wanted nothing more than for things to be different.
So the pair followed Becky outside to the back deck, which was huge, mind you. There was even a hot tub out there, the tub already full of people. They found Ash in all his flannel and ripped jeans glory, held upside down over the keg by a Batman and Robin duo. There were people all around cheering him on. Cas laughed at the sight, shaking his head. Leave it to Ash to find himself hanging upside over a keg once left alone to his own devises.
Sam nodded, shrugging his shoulders. “I don’t know about you, but I think he likes you Cas. You’re good to him, from what I’ve seen.”
When Castiel did arrive, Dean gave the apartment one last once over to be sure everything was in its place. Satisfied, he opened the door, smiling the moment he saw Cas standing there, his backpack sitting securely on his shoulders.
Posse_Magnet67[9:55AM]: Why don’t you take the rest of the day off, recoup at home. I’m sure you could use a little detox and some rest. :)
“Hm? Oh!” He glanced down at the dark plaid pajama pants he wore and laughed. “Uhm, Anna I guess snuck into your room early this morning and grabbed a pair. I’ll give them back.”
“Now, Castiel here has been through a difficult situation a few years ago, so he has some reservations about going forward. I’ve got to admit, if there was one person I had hoped you would match with, Castiel, it was Sam here. He’s never once received a complaint from a partner and he treats everyone’s boundaries with respect.”
“Okay okay, sheesh. Anyways, I gotta get going to work. Do let me know how this all goes.” Gabriel poured the last bit of his coffee down the sink and grabbed his coat from the coat rack by the door.
“I understand.” Sam nodded. “I’m really sorry, Cas, for what my brother did. Its uh…He doesn’t always think, he’s a bit impulsive, selfish, but he cares a whole hell of a lot. I’m not siding with him, by any means. I just…When he wakes up I’ll let you know. You can come by and talk to him.”
“I want to have fun at the party in whatever way that might include, but afterwards, I don’t know what the days following the party are going to hold. If you and I….If it goes well, I cannot promise anything for us. It wouldn’t be fair to him if you and I were together when I need to seek help first.”
Stop it Castiel. He finished off his Jack and coke in one swig in hopes to quell the roiling emotions within him.
“What??” Before Castiel could really process what was happening, Dean grabbed a hold of his hand and with a pen he scribbled out a series of numbers.
Dean stilled, uncertain if he had heard the words correctly. He pulled back just enough to look at Cas, to try and gauge what he was feeling. His eyes that were once so bright, so hopeful, were now glassy and full of tears. What was going on…? “Y- you can’t?” Dean’s voice trembled a little, hoping and praying he’d heard him wrong.
Castiel smiled reassuringly. “I’m not leaving you two. You and Becky are my best friends, you’ve been there for me in more ways than one…I won’t make myself a stranger to you two, I can promise you that.”
He pushed him away, rejected him. After everything, from the simple crush he had for what felt like ages ago, to the longing looks and the private, intimate moments they shared together; Castiel tossed it all away. Dean was gone. And he was sure he’d never be able to win him back.
