The black wings were still extended, now trembling with effort to display the fact that the conquest was complete, and that Dean was Castiel’s.
“Hell, Sam,” said Dean, finally cracking a smile. “You could give old Jalopy Fred a run for his money.”
"I thought, what could change any of that? Because as far as I could figure, nothing can. But then I realised, maybe there's one thing."
In the villa, the lights were blazing as Dean wandered into the kitchen to see if there was any leftover food.
Some of those who recognized the tune hummed or sang along, as others let themselves drift off on the lullaby of the evening.
This is not the same as those who have suffered abuses they think might not be as terrible because they are not, in a technical sense, as ‘terrible’ as my experiences – but I say to those people, your abuse experience is your own and it is important to you. It matters.
So no, I did not want to watch a program that buried two drifters deep underground and told me they were happy about it, because I know from lived experience exactly how being forced into that situation drains us completely dry. The addition of a ‘child’ further cemented my disinterest in the program because this was not what the fuck I signed up for. Therefore I have often said I am not a fan of the show. Just of Destiel, and of the on-the-road version of it, which is where I set most of the stories I tell about them.
No one harboring an angel in this way had twined so close with it. There was a sense of the brand-new to it; a new creation.
Sue him. Dean was hot, and he knew it, but he was also experiencing the worst case of blue balls he’d ever had in his life trying to tempt this guy into the sack.
They walked home, near dawn, laughing and singing little snatches of the songs they had briefly heard, and at the moment of parting, clung to each other a bit longer than necessary, until they said their farewells and Castiel watched Dean stagger a little on his way to his rooms in the dusk-light of dawn.
Castiel’s interest was piqued immediately, but he knew it wouldn’t be wise to react as if he knew them.
“And so I cursed him,” said Ishim. “I’m not the only angel, either. Castiel was something…of a racist, I suppose, in your terminology. No fraternizing with the humans. The curse was only meant to be lifted when Castiel understood the value of all of you. So I assume he’s also fallen in love.”
But the other side of that particular coin was that he was simply fond of humans. Moreso than his brothers and sisters, who he hadn’t seen in centuries.
And to Dean’s consternation, and Sam’s amusement, Castiel got down on one knee like Dean had seen in old paintings of knights and offered Sam a silver blade, hilt-first.
"Always the  businessman, eh?" asked Dean, sitting down beside him. "What kind of negotiations? The sexy kind?"
Cas moved, just a little, and watched as Dean thrashed against the ground beneath him, reveling in the total abject offering of the object of his affections –
and immigrants, all the like," Arachne informed him. "We're invisible, long as you want us to be. You wanted a life where things appeared as if by magic, never thinking that maybe magic was the reason they were there. Monsters, right under your nose. Some hunters you are."
For Dean was young, to Castiel, although relatively old, nearly of middle age in human years as Castiel understood it.
I suppose all this rambling is probably meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but I thought if I was able to get anyone reading these stories to reconsider before they hit their rock bottom, then I had to try.
He heard that sound like the underbrush again and recognized it as footsteps. His mind was foggy and dark.
To my own 'Daniel', not that you will ever read this - I'm so sorry I let you down. I've been a coward for so long, too damned chicken to do what I promised you all those years ago and tell our story.
“Now, there was an eighteen-wheeler big rig on the road coming up, and the driver didn’t see the stop sign. There was a crash.”
Castiel watched those beloved green eyes move slightly, to look at the broken clock that still sat on the bedside table.
Sam did not seem to receive the murderous message Dean was sending, and they fell back together into the kitchen.
Dean never saw him much outside the room they had designated for him, but he was vaguely aware of the angel’s presence.
Afterwards, Dean found Castiel sitting in one of the chairs, hands clasped in front of him, looking out at the city lights.
The restaurant was the type Dean had only seen in movies, all dark mahogany and quiet waiters in butler uniforms scuttling around the place with white towels over their arms.
Thank you all so very much for your wonderful support. I send you all my well-wishes, and that you are doing all right during these strange times.
"You know," he said. "I don't think we'll have too long to wait before he joins us. I was the one who always talked about our responsibility to royalty and the family business. Sam's always wanted something else, and I think the call of the colonies will eventually get too strong."
The soul he had searched for, a search that had lasted centuries, and one he had nearly been tricked into destroying.
“And there you go again! Totally resistant every time I bring it up. Like you’re an agent who has begun to believe his cover story.”
“Don’t be,” said Dean, grinning. “It’s badass. Plus, it helped me find you. Some kinda GPS, I think.”
"Sam is never gonna understand," he said fiercely under his breath. "All he thinks about is legacy, and money!"
Castiel delighted in this, in bringing Dean joy, in finding his own as he pushed between the young man’s legs with a soft sound in the back of his throat.
Castiel come hard deep inside him and somehow, impossible, Dean found himself coming a third and final time as the shockwave hit the room and cracked the mirror.
“Tch,” clicked the archangel, standing up again and walking around Castiel. “I thought for sure you’d spill the beans there. Your mind is a crafty one, Castiel, placing them in a permanent home, in Madrid, in an orange grove on the coast, anywhere they definitely
Sam nodded enthusiastically and launched into an explanation of various aspects of genius guesswork.
Dean was sobbing now, weeping in uncontrollable, long hitches of his body, tears falling and staining his skin as it was all too much for him to bear.
Castiel, for his part, was held taut and aching, his cock weeping precome and his back the same, rivulets coursing down his spine to pool and drip onto the bed beneath him.
Afterward, Castiel pillowed Dean on one of his great wings, as the sunlight through the palm fronds dappled Dean's freckled skin.
“Please don’t kill him,” Bernice said, a sad note in her voice now. “He really don’t know any better.”
The angel slammed home, once, twice, and then threw his head back and the world was filled with static and sound.
Balthasar also happens to be my personal favorite king - everyone has one! He is a magnificently rich Black African king, and I got him in the last king cake I enjoyed :) It's also why I stubbornly spell 'Balthasar' with an S like the Spanish do, although if I were to be perfectly accurate it would be 'Baltasar'.
Sam was now alarmed at this expression of any emotion from his brother whatsoever, but there was nothing Dean could do for it. Like it or not, the experience had done something to him.
Dean's annoyance and puzzlement with things like 'guys night' and 'girls night' are exactly how most drifters think, because there is so little in the way of gender/sex segregation. Everything is more fluid on the road, gender and sexuality included. When you live outside of society things tend to be very different. It's odd that the push in the 70s was to make toys and films gender-neutral while today people are going at the gender separation thing hardcore among those who stand still.
Speaking of which, did you know that as it turns out the original English in which he spoke, and in which all his plays and sonnets sound best, sounds
There was something in the way the angel said it, almost like an order, that seemed to start Dean's engines a little.
Castiel had never been particularly wise regarding human culture. He understood the broad strokes, and understood obedience, because that was a part of angelic life. As far as the things he wanted to share with Dean, however, he wished he had another angel to ask.
As Dean watched in wonder, leaves and vines unfurled from Castiel’s sides, out of his ribcage beneath his wings, and began to fill the room.
“Oh no, I wouldn’t dream of insulting you in such a way. I would offer thee – you – a bride price although I don’t think I can afford it,” Castiel was telling Sam in earnest. “I am but a poor soldier, but – ”
“Just doing as you instructed,” Balthasar explained, and then looped his arms through Castiel’s, holding him fast.
anything?” Dean’s voice escalated like a man trying to get to the next level of a supermarket. Dean sounded like a teapot that had better things to do than whistle.
“Hi,” he said, sitting down at Castiel’s feet. “Hope you don’t mind, but I kinda wanted to have lunch here with you. I’m sure you don’t understand English anyway, but…my brother went on a tour but I had other plans.”
Dean walked quietly by Castiel's side long enough that the angel wondered whether there was anything in this particular perambulation, or if Dean had merely been lonely and wished for company.
But he felt the sensation of rain, cooling his skin, as he pushed his hands further, deeper into the feathers and the angel thrashed and hiccuped a stuttered moan, panting and wild with it as if he had never known touch like Dean’s before.
Dean, on his knees, with Castiel's enormous cock hitting the back of his throat, stretching his lips around it, his aching jaw, his tears as Castiel fucked into him hard because he wanted it, when Castiel came down his throat and afterwards Dean's hoarse whispers of
Castiel stared at Dean as if he no longer understood human language. Then through his lust-addled haze, the words connected.
“Well, you’re going to need to give me time on that one, Dean. I’ve spent quite a few years watching my older brother disappear up his own asshole.”
Their eyes were round as dishplates as he stormed out of the meeting, but none of them met his gaze.
At least, these were his inner arguments with himself about ‘abandoning’ Sammy again as he slid the key in the lock.
Castiel finished, in his own mind, as Dean’s head hit the back of the wall and he came hard on a long, low howl, broken and almost pained.
The lights came up, such as they were, on a shadowed cathedral. The ancient kind, like you see in Europe, with all kinds of details.
He climbed the stairs and found the door had still been hanging wide open from when Dean had left it open the night before.
Then he looked up, and his heart broke at Castiel’s broken expression, realizing he had said the wrong thing. Again.
“You’re – you’re – ” pants Dean, as Castiel hauls him outside and against the wall, away from prying eyes here behind the church, against a place where the white wall was bare and the rest surrounded by climbing green ivy.
Castiel knew the people of the village spoke in hushed whispers of a man who wore the guise of a pirate but often appeared to do good works.
Wasn’t to his taste, though. He preferred the open road, wind in his hair, the ability to see the sun.
A bright, chipper voice like the California sun shone down on Dean as he sat under a raincloud of his own thoughts on one of the stiff benches.
Castiel was helpless now, caught in the net of his own desires, and never one to disobey a direct order.
“How do you – ” Dean panted, and then forgot what he wanted to ask, because Castiel wrapped his hand around Dean’s, and their cocks, pressing inwards, and that was it, all she wrote, as Dean went off like a rocket with cries to the sky and to God and to Castiel, who drank them in like the parched earth after a first rain.
One fight involved a werewolf and Dean had hunched down, hard and wanting, but the creature had just laughed, and left him there.
“I have had it in this jacket pocket,” he said, looking at his wrist where he was not wearing a watch, “for
“But also defeated, at the end of the day,” said Castiel. “Death – Father – I don’t think so. Not as easily.”
“Need I remind you,” Castiel said in a testy voice that reminded Dean an awful lot of Sam, “That picking up
"If I can resolve this issue, we will return to the moment we vanished," explained Castiel in a soothing tone, apparently intended to comfort him. "Sam won't even notice we were gone."
Not so much the women, or the fact that they were women. Dean just knew he was carrying roughly a 747 worth of baggage and ultimately didn’t want to unload it on anyone else.
The waterfall plunged thin but strong down the side of the green mountain, making mist at the pool, bright turquoise in the light of the day. The green jungle surrounded the place, and parrots flew above them.
Dean nodded, and then realized that since Castiel didn't know he was a hunter, he probably assumed that he was some type of drifter prostitute.
And those things, above all, were the things he wanted Dean to remember about him, after the inevitable end.
“Our time together in Hell, and after, as I rebuilt you, was…longer than you recall. I admit, afterwards - I was - knowing you must have forgotten."
Much as he wanted to put the plan into action immediately, due to funding concerns and available flights out of the United States (apparently nobody in the USA knew about the Canary Islands for whatever reason), the brothers did not end up finding themselves on a flight overseas for another couple of months. By working side jobs 12 hours a day, Dean raised the money to get them on a flight and provide accommodation.
I experienced a pancreatic attack. This is one of those things you don’t hear about much, because cirrhosis gets the attention. But apparently death by pancreatitis is one of the worst and most painful you can experience – the pancreas begins digesting itself and in chronic pancreatitis, it calcifies. They don’t have strong enough painkillers for it so those who die of this, die screaming. And it ain't a quick way to go either, from what I gather.
that got Dean writhing again in expectation, pushing his ass up, his face in the covers. He knew, he
Suddenly, ferociously, Dean was kissing him, and it was all liquid and beautiful warmth under the light of the moon.
as Castiel's hand touched Dean's cockhead delicately, and his cock jumped so hard, spurting out precome, that Dean shouted with the sensation.
And some dam broke within Castiel, who was suddenly bracketing him, scenting the place where his collarbone met his neck, and murmured:
“Fine,” he said. “Just as long as it is registered that we are doing this against my better judgement.”
Castiel gave him a startled look. He set the empty mug down; he had still been holding it for something to do, he supposed.
He'd had many ideas about exactly how he would go about wiping it off his face, generally involving pleading, needy moans pouring out from between those sinful lips.
The other thing, though, pointing fingers – it’s an excuse to be shitty to other people and to feel superior. Please stop doing that, especially as it seems that the people freaking out about stuff never stop to check whether the person they are hysterically and overdramatically shrieking about might have gone through exactly the type of shit they are trying to prevent. There also seems to be a lack of understanding that if something happens within a story, that doesn't necessarily mean the person approves of it, and there might in fact be a reason for it that will be revealed later. But to some people, all that matters is that feel-good sensation they get from screaming about these perceived sins.
He was a sentinel himself, a guardian angel for the village, but he had never truly understood the passion and dedication of true guardian angels – those who were sent to guard a specific human – until now.
"Shit," Dean whispered again, before he finally got his shattered brain back together and hauled ass off the bed, out the door and into the hallway, busting into Cas's room where he found the man on the bed against the wall,
It has different languages and wildly different geography in different regions ranging from the Celtic North swathed in mist like Ireland or the Highlands of Scotland to the tropical Canary Islands off the coast of Africa.
Castiel groaned, and began the work of pushing things aside, lengthening the channel within Dean so that he would be able to accept Castiel’s engorged length deep within his body.
They had a bite to eat and something to drink, then lay back on the bed. Castiel turned on the television but left it muted.
Castiel made a strange sound of distress, as if fearing Dean might be taken from him, and he pressed even harder into Dean.
Dean gave himself over, and came with a soft whine against Castiel's lips, as the angel grinned and with one final thrust, a punched-out sound, he came as well, shuddering with the aftershocks.
And let me tell you something, withdrawal and PAWS ain't pretty. But that's what you gotta do to heal, and here's how I found out it was worth the trouble:
A reminder: I, and other writers, do this for fun in our spare time. This is not my job. I will do it for only as long as I find it an enjoyable waste of my time.
"I say, wot wot," he said, tipping his hat. "Sorry to bother you gents, but I've found myself in something of a pickle."
Dean sat with Sam in the street outside his house, Sam blinking woozily up at the sky, when Dean looked up as Castiel emerged from the cloud of smoke.
He was privately glad the guy hadn't brought him back to the motel he'd been staying at with Sam, which was always a danger in arrangements like these.
“That’s true, but angels can be…manipulative, to get what they want,” said Castiel. “Follow the law to the letter but not the spirit.”
Cas,” said Dean. “And there’s gotta be an end to things, or else how is anybody ever likely to change?”
“You are irresistible, Dean Winchester. How could I say no to such an invitation, when you are spread out before me like a feast?”
Then Castiel fled, and hid himself in the kitchens, where Arachne tutted around him and made him some soup.
“No,” Dean said with a grin. “He’s always bringing me whatever weird shit he comes up with on the day. I like it. Always a surprise and usually sugary.”
“Look, Dean, yeah that’s…kinda weird. Maybe he’s a freak, I don’t know. But I haven’t seen you so happy and content in yourself ever since…before.”
“Your memory will take time to come back. You found the thread and you pulled it. That must've taken a fight. Good job.”
“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” said Castiel with a smile. “I’ll get you both a drink and you can catch up.”
"Not at all," smiled Felipe. "By the way, my name is not Felipe. But then, aren't we all full of little surprises."
After about an hour of contemplation beside the fire, as Castiel dutifully sipped at his drink, Colin came into the room and sat down across from him.
He dreamed of Dean falling apart beneath his clever hands, of Dean surrendering to him, offering up his body like a sacrifice.
Drifters, hobos, etc. like to tell stories in the way outlined in this work – it’s a little more staid than the actual experience, which involves a lot of yelling, a
“Fine,” Sam said loudly. “Do you want to go to breakfast? There’s a diner over there and they serve chocolate and red velvet pancakes.”
Gabriel had taken the lead with Sam, for his part, as an archangel’s might was more than a seraph’s, and Castiel was to follow with Dean.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean said, but there was no heat in it. He ran a hand down his face and stared at the empty air where Castiel had been just a moment before.
Dean’s bright-white smile dazzled him, even though the house itself was made of light wood and windows – or perhaps there were no windows at all, the place was open to the elements, what elements there were in Heaven.
“Your road through heaven was two-lane asphalt once,” said the Road. “You are facing a trial here, Dean; one that I cannot detail for you. Let’s see how you do – I’m rooting for you, as always. Just do what you do best – get in the car, and drive.”
This one was also note-heavy for the same reasons - it is incredibly difficult to focus on some of those things for too long, and my ability to switch gears is what has kept me around this long, kept the shadows at bay.
"And you couldn't just come here yourself?" Castiel demanded, angry that Dean had shown up here, all bronze and burnished and offensively beautiful, even in the grey light from the windows.
“As you know, somewhere within yourself, golden soul,” said Castiel. “I am an angel. And, as always, I am at your service.”
Immediate reaction time, yes. The sense that he hadn’t had a good nights’ sleep in decades, also yes, translating into a murderous need for coffee.
Dean, then I saw you, and spoke with you," he said. "I was gone, then, and have kept falling, ever since."
It was the kind of out-of-the-way place you didn't see too often these days, where you could still smoke indoors because the local cops didn't give a shit about it.
And he moved again, and Dean was hard again, sobbing and weeping with the intensity of his need and desire, mindless, held conquered and captive, as Castiel pressed Dean’s hand hard against the place where he could feel the angel making his absolute claim, and shuddered and came again, helpless, as Castiel laughed against his shoulder.
is the angelic city,” said Sam, by way of explanation. “There is another city that mirrors it somewhat, the heaven for humans, just across there.”
"Thought you'd say that," Dean said, jostling him out of the way, "so I've decided to move in here with you."
"I certainly hope you are right," said Heracles, sitting down in front of them. "I cannot say I have the same faith."
"I'm right here, I'm right here, I fuckin' want it too, Cas, God, want it so bad, I'm right here, I'm so ready for you, want your cock, ah,
“All’s forgiven,” he said. “What's a little murder between friends? Anyway. I climbed out of there while the two of you were, shall we say. Distracted. Keep in touch. Chin chin.”
, but if you haven't go and look it up, it's hilarious. Made me snort while eating tuna straight out of the can after doing calisthenics on a balcony just south of Tijuana a while back. Enjoy.
Sometimes even talking about them seemed to work like people thought of ghosts – the more you speak of them, the more they are ready to gather ‘round and put the old spookshow on for you.
“And you think I won’t fit in with all them high-falutin’ types,” he said. “You know what? Fuck you, Cas, and all your fancy ways. Shoulda figured this was never gonna work. Dukes, kings, princes – nah. They ain’t got nothin’ on angels, bein’ up their own asses so far they can taste brains.”
“Cas, we gotta get outta here,” he finally said, putting his hand on Castiel’s elbow even though he knew that there was no way of moving the angel if the angel did not want to be moved.
Castiel just sat there, stunned, in the realization that he was listening to his human pleasure himself.
Castiel dropped his gaze. All the eyes on the wings closed, leaving nothing but the smooth feathered surface.
They left the restaurant then, supporting each other's weight as they walked out into the chill night air.
“Go through the doorway,” said John Henry. “It leads back into your story. Your legend, although you won’t recognize it that way, any more than I do when I pick up that hammer again. But it’s your life – your
“I’m bored,” he confessed. “Fuck me sideways, but I’m bored as hell up here, Ellen. And I’m an ungrateful sonofabitch, I know that.”
“And I was in a good mood and forgot and I had the cheeseburger in both of my hands, I, I, the – I liked to tear food and eat it like that, I don’t know how I got the habit but I’d hold one in each hand, and I was in a good mood and forgot, and they, and they…”
"I, I just always assumed," Dean said. "You know. Named after an angel, an' you're pretty religious, from, er. What I remember."
“What?” asked Cas, alarmed as he always was when he thought something was wrong with Dean. “What is it?”
Now, here, he drank his fill. But he knew, even here, he could never be satisfied. It could never be enough. There would always be some part of Dean still left to explore, to ache, to touch with willing hands.
“Late? For what?” he asked, and then without waiting for a response, just barreled right on. “Cas, I’m sorry. I was – you freaked me out a little, okay, it’s a
and Castiel ground up against him again, and again, and again, all the while pressing love and kisses into Dean's overheated skin, gripping him tight,
“Fine,” said Sam, crossing his arms. “But if we’re stuck in this town, I’m not staying in that motel again. Find us something with human-sized beds and showers.”
but all of his self-reprimands were completely meaningless whenever he thought of those bright blue eyes, that awestruck look, those
Luckily, they were swept up in conversation with others soon after that, and Castiel had hoped that the incident was forgotten.
Incredible history, castles, adventures, beautiful coastlines, nice people, high quality of life, low cost of living. I've enjoyed myself anytime I've been there and I cannot say that for everywhere I've been.
you, Dean. Maybe you’ll understand once he’s gone and whatever hex he’s cast over you and this town will be – ”
"I came back - I thought it was wise to keep an eye on you, given that I - I understood, perhaps too late, what your plan - what you planned to do."
"Then come for me, Dean," said Castiel, and whether it was the buildup from last time, the intensity of the moment, or the fact that it had been a while -
The point of all this is that the class system is primarily a lie and wealth does not necessarily come with ‘moving on up’, so to speak.
He didn't like to admit it, but after Castiel's exit, he felt a little bereft. He refocused that emotion onto his hunger as he reached for the room service menu.
“I meant what I said about it,” Castiel assured him. “I’ll be thinking about it for weeks. You’re stunning, Dean. And so – I don’t know the right word. Sensual. Have you heard of Stendhal syndrome?”
"And I never will," said Rufus. "Dying is so gauche. Besides, you two don't have the monopoly on immortality."
"It's just," Castiel resumed, "two weeks ago, you weren't in my life. Now, I can't imagine my life without you in it."
“God, you’re so fuckin’ hot, you drive me so fuckin’ crazy,” Dean said, awe in his voice, “I’m gettin’ hard again and I just came, fuck. Fuck! Look what you do to me – ”
“Are we in Minnesota,” whispered Dean to Castiel, as drifting the way he did, he frequently was fuzzy on his exact location.
"Tildy chooses what room she sleeps in, here in the house," he said. "No pitiful cupboard under the stairs for her! The woman practically raised me. What do you think, Tildy? Will you be willing to give up your many rooms for these good people?"
Dimly, he was aware of Dean moving around across the garden, possibly in search of Castiel, possibly in search of breakfast – or both.
Castiel sensed that he was trying to make peace – and Castiel longed for the same, if he were being honest with himself.
"Come back to my motel with me, Cas, please," said Dean, soft and urgent. "I can give you everything we
“Pile up like a kinda tower, like when you were a kid ‘n made a fort,” Mac said. “Then like fall back on ‘em. Luxury.  Fallin’ asleep in them big fluffy clouds, can’t be beat, I’m tellin’ ya.”
The man went to the balcony and looked out. He seemed to satisfy himself that no one was lurking out there.
Castiel had drawn down all the shades in the place and joined him in what had become their favorite place to sit in the bay window.
"Not to?" Dean finished. "Hell no, Cas. Any girl good enough for my brother's a girl whose head ain't gonna be turned by me or any other cad who walks in the damned doorway. Already thought she was made of cheap card, now I know she ain't the one for him."
As I passed him, I realized he was waving the OK sign, kinda weird but I waved at him as a thanks/acknowledgement of his existence or whatever.
For some, the story will be long-familiar, well-worn like the pages of a favorite book. Embellished, built upon by others, but the nuts and bolts are the same. They contribute and question, argue and laugh and smile.
All of us, however, live under The Hobo Code, a loose assortment of laws that govern those on the road. Currently, our numbers are estimated (drifters, hobos, tramps, etc all together) as somewhere around 50,000 in the United States.
“Shut your mouth,” Castiel snarled between his teeth, and redoubled his efforts. “I’ve longed to dominate you just like this, you know. Your rebellious attitude. Your inability to listen to orders.”
“ – and her sister went with her for her wedding night. Just as they were all about to fall asleep, her sister asked her to tell a story. And she did – but she didn’t finish it, promising her sister she would finish it the next evening. And the king let her live, so he could hear the conclusion – but with the conclusion came the beginning of another story. And so on.”
He’d never been a fan of wide-open spaces, like prairies or deserts. Strange, since he was of course a hunter and in theory monsters had less places to hide. But he preferred the deep woods – maybe because there were more places for
“I’m not sure this is where I wanna be,” he confessed to Castiel. “My brother talked me into this whole three-month trip thing, that’s the American limit here, and at first I was super excited, right? But…like. I hate being
He was eating a chocolate muffin Castiel had brought him, tearing it so he had a piece in each hand.
But the types who look down on my type are not always the cleverest people I’ve known. I’ve known many a wiser old hobo than anybody in tweed I’ve run into within the hallowed halls of academia.
"Sorry about that asshole," murmured Dean, and Castiel smiled as he was led away, onto the dance floor, and straight into a dream.
A man turned from the crowd fighting at the other end of the deck, notable because he was the only one moving rapidly out of the fray.
"I've had a few days to come to grips with the idea that we might not exist," said Mulder. "What are we, if we only exist in the world of television? Is everyone on earth just a part of someone's late-night show?"
Dean tended to get bored with the kinds of chores he couldn't a. shoot or b. punch. He wasn't an idiot or anything, he just tended to get a little distracted.
Castiel found the serenity and peace of the lands extending all around them a source of comfort and welcome.
"There," said Dean, removing his shirt sleeve and tearing it into strips, bandaging the creature. "I cannot do more for you now."
Moreover, it's safe. Kids still play in the streets at night. You can walk through parks at nighttime where kids are playing, too.
It was automatic, now; Dean acquiesced, Dean offered himself, Dean spread his legs to allow Castiel entry.
In his mind, the appendages wrapped around Dean and brought him flush with Castiel’s body, rendering him immobile, spreading him open for Castiel to take his pleasure there.
Then I heard somewhere that if you quit drinking alcohol for 2 years, you will get some kind of mental clarity reward after that long of your brain and body repairing itself.
Dean drank his latte for a little while, enjoying the strange new combination of flavors. He looked out at the people passing by on the street, and said:
“Hey it’s me again,” he said. “There’s some real trouble brewin’ so you wanna pick up the fuckin’ phone and get your head outta your ass here?”
Songs Dean is referencing here include The Boxer and America by Simon & Garfunkel (drifter favorites!), Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver, and Starry, Starry Night by Don MacLean who writes songs that make everybody cry.
“I protected his mother, in my branches,” he said, nodding toward the old tree. “That story became a popular local folktale, still told today. And then, one day, it was also her time. I stayed with her, at the end.”
When he turned around, he was startled to see there were two other people in the room instead of one, both of whom were looking a little sheepish.
Dean, but I’m sure your personal trainer would have something to say about your penchant for 1AM Ritz and Cheez Whiz.”
Hard enough, fighting monsters – a thankless job without pay or benefits or even long enough to form lasting friendships, to find a home.
The night arrived more swiftly than Dean could credit, but then, time had always moved differently here.
“You can’t stay here,” he heard himself say. “You’re such a friggin’ child, Cas. You’re dead to me.”
He was a warrior, a soldier, not usually arrogant, but hearing it from Dean made him redouble his efforts.
He also didn't fancy a return to those small, humble rooms in the City, where he'd put himself up after his first row with Dean.
Castiel took the bottle of lube and used a substantial amount on his own hard cock, then on opening Dean up, wordless and laserfocused on the man beneath him, and when he touched his own cock with the warm lube he made a little sound like
"There will be money left on your side table tomorrow morning," said Garth. "I trust you know your way to Southampton docks."
"I gotta trust you to love me back, to have my back, the same - to - to cover my own. Self hate. I mean."
I think it is absolutely hilarious that Ranch Doritos are called Cool Original in the UK or Cool American in Europe, because ranch dressing isn't really a thing over there.
But if he had expected that to upset him, it had backfired, so unlike Dean was Michael that he could have looked like anything.
“I was thinking about what you said regarding Vonnegut the other day, and wanted to know if you’d ever read Ginsberg,” he said.
He announced, around this time, that because he was the first Fitzgerald in America, he would be Garth Fitzgerald the First, and that perhaps one of his descendants would take on the 'fourth' in his title.
And while Sam persisted with the creature comforts of Castiel's home, they played on a simultaneous track with Dean's own inner monologue.
Sure enough, as soon as they stepped off and back onto the road, the mountain vanished before their eyes.
"Communication is key, in these situations," said Castiel. "I will give you half of your payment now, the other half at the end of the week. Does that suit?"
His desperate need for possession of this man, perhaps; he had no angelic brethren to ask whether this was the usual outcome of such a mating, as it had been many centuries since the last one, and many of those angels were long gone or dead, killed in a heavenly war that had no real use for them, or their preservation.
is a favorite painting of mine with an amusing history in how we don't recognize masterpieces during their own time.
"Miss Kensington renews her visit today," Castiel announced. "I trust that she will be well-received."
“If you are stupid enough to have the courage of your convictions, Dean,” he snarled. “Then have the stupid courage to do it again.”
There was just Dean, and Sam, Ellen, Ash, Jo, the Roadhouse, their parents and their Heaven, floating across what Dean assumed was the great black void of space, among the stars.
“I am here to do a job, Mr. Winchester. And that job is to keep you safe. If you cannot be persuaded to take these threats on your life seriously, someone has to, for your brother’s sake at least. So please stop trying to distract me.”
for Castiel, whose image reflected now in the mirror was so beatific and so beautiful it hurt to look at him.
Later, with the Impala idling outside a store that read ELECTRONICS in big, faded letters, Dean said:
In his mind’s eye, in Dean’s thoughts, Castiel saw Dean fighting with monsters and the deep, strange shameful feelings that had embarrassed him for years.
So he had chalked up Bernice’s reticence, at first, to the usual distrust of drifters, because Bernice was One Who Stood Still.
Now, it was an embarrassment, a humiliation – now, because he longed to impress a human, but also because this particular human hunted, and probably hated, monsters.
The room was filled with a soft glow, emanating from him, as he made his halo visible, rings swirling slowly around his head. He drew out his wings, holding them somewhat close to his body, a little shy, as the flight feathers brushed the floor.
Along with a hell of a lot of other erotic art, included in a museum which, as I mentioned in the notes of a different story, you could only access if you promised not to laugh. Today, you can look at it and laugh as much as you like.
Not that Dean wasn’t a warrior – he was, and a formidable one – but it was a fool who assumed all warriors were nothing but shell.
Dean was fairly certain this meant he was going to shack up with Eileen or possibly go on that beach vacation he kept jonesing for or –
and Dean shouted, and cried out, and hung his head in unworthiness of the blessing, as Castiel stared up at him somehow in control despite his position, capturing Dean within that endless eternal steady steady steady Aegean Mediterranean blue, the song of countless battles in heaven hell and earth, steady in the wind bending as a cypress tree on the green hills that were and were not home;
Castiel understood, then, that this was the reason the wording and the situations had been so oddly unfamiliar –
precedent. You and me ain’t exactly innocent either. We’ve got blood on our hands that won’t wash clean.”
Trading the ability to tell stories in exchange for booze doesn’t really seem like a good deal to me. So I decided I would rather retain the ability to write and share stories with people than drink.
. This ain’t the oppression Olympics, man. What’s bad for you is what was bad for you. Don’t feel like you can’t talk about it because you think it’s, like. Lesser, or some shit.”
Castiel knew that the next time he encountered the soul, it may not look the same. It may not carry the same title.
“You’re a monster,” he said, still so beautiful, “and even if you weren’t, you’re in a dude suit, and I don’t swing that way.”
The man who had helped them was named Heracles, he boasted proudly; a fortuitous name, the perfect name for a soldier.
“Pray give me a moment with Dean?” asked Pasion. “Worry not, I shall return him to you in a moment.”
He glanced at Castiel, who shrugged; Dean set about binding the angel to the dais-bed, and wrapping the silver chains around his wings, until he was lying prone, waiting for Dean to decide what to do with him.
He wasn’t gonna lie; the idea of some sun and sand appealed to him. He’d been getting weary over the last little while.
“Don’t be scared, Cas,” Dean said into the darkness. “It’s okay. Me and my brother, we’ve – seen things.”
It was automatic, essential to him and to his being, as if he were a widower who could not bear the thought of changing his routine -
“No, Cas, I had no idea he was going to do this, I’m so fuckin’ sorry, you gotta believe me,” Dean said.
The motel sign glowed red through the thin curtains and vaguely illuminated the motor court outside. The motel itself was a humble affair, even more than their usual – dark plywood walls, brown bedspreads, brown and orange carpeting that had clearly not been replaced since the seventies. Warm and comforting, despite all that, but not about to win any prizes from Better Homes and Gardens.
Dean’s wretched inner loathing suddenly rose to the surface after all those years of adulation, now that he had something he really wanted and saw the possibility that he didn’t feel the same.
In this story, Dean experiences the DTs, the hallucinations, and pancreatitis (abdominal pain in the extreme). I did not include the
And here they were, once again running toward a fight they could not win, but one that needed fighting nevertheless.
A guilty part of him felt like jacking off to relieve the tension of the memories, but he was just too embarrassed to really consider it.
And he pulled, to bring the body close, but he couldn’t even see the outline of his face in the inky black.
He was greeted warmly by Arachne and Colin, who welcomed him into the kitchen. Arachne offered him Victoria sponge cake and cream, which he gladly accepted.
"Garden parties and Westminster," muttered Dean, and swanned out of the room, with Samuel following every step of the way.
No one had ever remarked it before – perhaps, because, on some level they knew he walked among them.
Where he would ostensibly now be living, Dean fuming silently as Sam showed him around (because Dean wasn’t going to make it easy for them).
“S – Sam, stop it, I’m up,” Dean managed, in a mouth thick with…he had no idea what, but it wasn’t pleasant.
Bedbugs are little horrors and believe me you do NOT want to experience them. They are the bane of all drifters, as they show up just about everywhere in the world and especially in motel/hotel beds.
The grounds were the real attraction, including several forests and fields along with barley plantations, vegetable gardens, and other valuable attractions. The Estate itself employed several people, and was bustling in every area, whether it was the kitchens or the gardens.
” Dean breathed out, flushed red in humiliation and embarrassment, but overcoming both with the intensity of his desire.
Later, Castiel's fingers, warm with lube, opening Dean up as he cried out softly, over and over again on the bed.
“And this is why this plan ain’t gonna work,” he mumbled to himself as he cleaned up. “Guy can’t deal with the most human shit possible, how’s he gonna pass himself off as me?”
For the first time in a long time, Dean felt that creeping dread, something deep in the base of his spine crawling up and radiating around his body like fireworks.
“I speak all languages,” said Castiel. “I wish I had been able to communicate with you. But I had been the target of what is called a
" - unbelievable," a voice said, which Dean recognized as Michael. "You couldn't even keep them here. I told you, Castiel, I'd be back to claim my prize."
The stateroom was expansive, with huge windows along one wall facing toward the ocean. There was a large bed up against the wall on the left-hand side, and a few overstuffed armchairs. On the other side of the room was a fireplace and a small kitchen/bar. The room was lit by a large central chandelier as well as wall sconces meant to imitate candlelight. There was a door in the wall of windows out onto a balcony with wooden sun loungers.
Dean gave him a sharp look of surprise, using their real names here - but he supposed it couldn't hurt.
Angels, according to a long-ago friend of Castiel's, were forbidden these relationships - not for the human's sake, but for the angel's.
“I’ve seen pictures of places like this before,” Sam said quietly. “It’s Arabic, I think. Central gardens, fountains, pools. Really beautiful stuff.”
“No, the late morning rush will start soon and I’ll be busy working anyway. You two go ahead, I’ve monopolized enough of Dean’s time already.”
Dean’s resolve broke then, and he went to his knees, kissing Castiel like his life depended upon it.
Where love is confessed in the shadows reflected off dark-red-neon motel signs; at the corners of 7th-and-Vines
Heracles finally managed to introduce them to his partner, whose name (somewhat fittingly) was Pasion, and he was, as expected, naked as a jaybird upon initial meeting as well as somewhat flighty and very pretty to look at if Dean thought things like that, which he didn't.
“What makes you think it’s a secret?” asked Dean. “In the fancier cities on the island, out in the capital – it’s common knowledge.”
American houses are huge and often have secret passages like that due to the varied history of the country. In this story, the hiding in the walls took place in the old plumbing pipe chase, which was a former building style.
"You think you're the first creature to realise that hiding in plain sight was the best refuge?" she asked.
is a serious one, and not asked lightly, because the answer isn’t always pretty. The asker must always be prepared to find an answer at the end of that question mark that is sobering or terrifying or something they did not want to hear.
of a lot of responsibility to, to, or, hell, I don’t know, maybe it isn’t, I, and now I’m talkin’ your ear off. Shit.”
I wanted to pause here and say hello to everyone who has stuck with this story! It has become a little sillier and more irreverent than I had initially planned, but I don't always know where these stories will take me when I sit down to write them. I didn't go heavily into the battle aspect in this part because I've always found the stories of the people involved more compelling than the battles themselves. And I am no Greek historian - I just know about the Sacred Band and thought it would be an interesting setting for a story.
Dean froze, and then watched the two of them stare each other down as if he were not in the room. His captor was tall and slender; somewhat cruelly handsome, also dark-haired and blue-eyed, but lacking Castiel's presence.
“Also,” said Sam. “You left the Impala out there. Where anybody could get at it. And, you know. Steal it. Or maybe key the car.”
probably, a little surprisingly, not because Cas was a man (or male creature), but because Dean had got
“He’s been torturing me for that information this entire time. He told me that if I wouldn’t give up your location, then he’d get you to come to him. Us.”
"There's a Wal-Mart a few miles away that would have the kind of thing you're looking for," said the woman, and the staff laughed again.
“Because I am in love with you, Dean. And I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. When you were ready – but I knew that you may never be ready.”
Long maligned for their poverty, the people of the coastal town were looked down upon by those in the capital city located up in the hills above it. Strange, since it was their access to ships, food, and the sea.
This was not the only secret Castiel held close to his own heart. He had others even more spectacular.
Castiel had always justified it to himself, interacting with humans this way, as an easier way to identify and heal the sick and wounded. And there was some truth to it.
Dean found that his wrists were still pinned somehow, so he thrust upwards instead, making Castiel hiss and murmur:
Dean looked out of sorts for some reason that Castiel ascribed to his first venture into the angelic subconscious.
Castiel sighed in relief, and those strange appendages suddenly appeared again, Castiel was naked again, Castiel’s wings spread high and dominant over their coupling.
,” Dean admitted. “This place, these people. Everyone’s poor, sure. But so are we, and somehow these people with so much less are happier than we’ve ever been. So. Cas.”
"Dean is different with me. It would be different," Castiel insisted, stubborn. "And even if it wasn't..."
as he went to bed with strangely un-sexual thoughts about Castiel's steadfastness as a wall Dean could lean on and his heart had ached for reasons unknown.
“Yeah,” said Dean, his own voice filled with tears. “Sorry, Sam. I just got so wrapped up in it – maybe it should’ve been you.”
“From what I saw, he doesn’t think this is real. Thinks he’s dreamin’ or something. Like we’re inside a snow globe. Maybe inside his head. Who knows what angels dream, or what they are capable of when they do it? Didn’t Ruby tell Cas this was a place where they play out their regrets?”
"Sorry, it's just - " the Dean on the phone sighed. "If I told you that you had a second chance to get everything right, this time - "
“He says the tree was bleeding. Dying,” Castiel clarified. “And now that its spirit has returned, a new life in the tree and for the village.”
Those same girls still returned to him when they were old and frail, to thank him for a life well-lived.
The soft air was filled with the scent of flowers, a heady breeze off the dark blue sea in the distance.
separate the man with the golden soul from his brother,” said One-Eyed Joe. “That’s splitting two halves of a whole, that is.”
He would have plenty of time to reflect upon his life and his choices now that he was utterly alone.
Dean tried to catch him, but to no avail, as the image of Castiel seeped through his fingers and over his hands like so much water.
Castiel, likewise, on a stuttered little gasp, came on Dean’s hand and seemed self-satisfied about it, like he had been waiting to mark him up, which made Dean shiver at the thought.
just gave him a look like thunder as if he were some kid who was sneaking in late for the millionth time.
Dean had the beginnings of an idea, then – one that he did not explain to his brother, since after all, he didn’t know who might be watching.
So he shut off the water, he toweled off his hair, and he dressed himself in his usual jeans-plaid-tshirt combination.
"Then come with me," Dean rushed to say. "On the road. What do you say, Cas? You, me, my little brother. Saving people, hunting things."
“People ain’t got no concept of how they’re able to eat, or get around,” he commented. “You fuck up just one section and it’s screwed for days. Man. This is – this is fucking
“No need to apologize,” said Castiel, setting out the cutlery and sitting down beside him. “Whatever you need, whenever you need it.”
Castiel told him that he would eventually figure out how to make healthier options, but for the time being this was all he could do.
you did it, Cas! You always got your reasons. But clearly this isn’t doing either of us any good, so – ”
Castiel gave Scully and Mulder a brief, triumphant smile as he followed Dean through the underbrush.
Dean felt like he had already experienced gift enough, and so pushed the angel’s hands away, shaking his head.
A desperate people in poverty, living in a place clearly deteriorating, while they are told they live in the greatest country on earth - well, truth will out, 100 percent of the time. And they want scapegoats, someone to blame, which is never the fatcats at the top but often each other. This has been true since time out of mind. Try to consider each other, we are all in the same boat here, poor and even up to middle class at this point are all in it together. Working together is the thing feared most by those truly at fault. Be kind to each other.
Castiel stood in the night library, more confused than ever, and stared after him, feeling strangely lonely and unfulfilled.
I never hit the same rock bottom as other drunks have done. But that doesn't mean I never hit various things that would be rock bottom for other people. This is another lie it tells:
Castiel walked silent by Dean's side until they rounded a bend, away from any onlookers and the wide windows of the great dining hall.
He steeled himself for this conversation, and standing in the library, got ready for whatever was about to come down the pike at him, just as if he were going off to a fight.
If you ever get a chance to visit the Dragon, please do. It is one of the most spectacular trees in the world.
"And we have one of the greatest libraries of British lore here at the estate, going to rack and ruin," said Dean, returning to the study.
here, see? It's about these...stupid social rules we've all placed on ourselves. Take Sam, for instance. He doesn't
The circle complete, he stilled, and then came on a shout that startled him, the sudden ferocity of it making his grip tight enough on Dean to bruise.
"Cas," said Dean, sleep-soft, reaching out and looping an arm around Castiel's, gently tugging him forward into the dangerous warmth of the enormous bed, and
Dean examined some of the items in the store. Interesting shit, the kind of crap he used to look at when it was Christmas at RadioShack and they had all the cool new tech toys before the world had irrevocably changed.
And their desire was as violent as the clash of teeth and tongue, as he drew his cock out and began stripping it hard and fast, enough pressure to be on just the other side of pain.
It was cold out; Dean enjoyed the crunch of the brittle leaves beneath his boots. The green grass was starting to brown as the weather got colder.
There is a worldwide problem with people unable to deal with the nomadic existence of others, whether it is the Travellers or the Roma or the Bedouin or drifters.
"And what of it?" Castiel demanded. "Am I to be forever your servant, your valet, your gentleman's gentleman? Always held at arm's length, a secret, something to take out every so often when you wish to scandalise the local gentry?"
“That’s right,” Dean assured him. “I’m yours. I belong to you. I mean it. Body and soul. And whatever.”
Dean pet the feathers there, where Castiel's wings joined his back, and Cas drew a sharp breath in between his teeth. All over the wings, the eyes closed, the feathers covering them as if they had never been there at all.
Certain word usage is necessary. Certain behaviors tend to be required. Using citations, understanding the problems with primary references, and so forth. For many people, the dryness of education is one barrier – but let’s be honest, the snobbery is another one. It is inaccessible to many people who are not minded in that particular way, or who do not want to go into extreme debt over something with a shaky return.
Finally, Castiel took himself in hand, jacking his own cock with his wing-oil, and he pressed inside.
He was shocked to see the man struggle to his knees, long black shadows that looked like wings stretching out behind him –
Dean looked at him with those bright green eyes where Castiel could see that tears were about to fall.
He went and shrugged his jacket over his shoulders and headed out the door, reminding himself of what Sam had said.
He pushed off from the wall, and chased Castiel inside, to the gloom of the church, where Castiel was throwing the hymn books onto the pews with more force than absolutely necessary.
Dean didn't answer his brother, but he drove to the nearest offramp, turning the car back toward Los Angeles, and the angel he had left there.
Castiel stood off to the side, hands behind his back, still in a full suit even in the California heat.
That night, Dean went to bed with an eagerness he’d never really known before. He wanted to test out a theory he had, and was excited to put it into practice.
abusing their power: parents, gymnastics coaches, cops, judges, ballet instructors, priests, staff at nursing homes or foster homes, the list just goes on and on.
His memories were flooding back now, and he had no idea how he was meant to share the bunker with Cas, let alone even look at him, ever again.
I got tailed for a long time and there was nothing out there, nowhere to go. Finally I made a very sharp right turn on a dime onto a dirt road (that’s why you don’t tailgate performance vehicles or tbh vehicles with performance brakes).
The rooms were smaller than Dean was normally accustomed to, but the wrought-iron balconies overlooking the city made up for what they lacked in size.
He and Castiel talked into the night, and Dean sat with him on the bench seat of the café with a cat in his lap, the first night he could remember where he had felt a sense of hope.
Dean’s consciousness snapped suddenly in place, and he was looking at the red brick of the alley behind the coffeeshop.
That was okay, though, because he had enough booze stashed back at the new motel room in the new town.
“I will be,” he said. “I think. Lemme go get cleaned up and I’ll be right back. You got any more, uh,
Even though he had his wings, and his grace, and he could flit off at a moment’s notice – Dean had come to understand, now, that Castiel was a drifter, too – and one far less emotionally hooked up to the concept of
“What can we do?” he asked. “Your wings must have grown back in all this time. The last I saw you – I thought I lost you forever.”
“I’m glad you’re making plans with your brother,” he said. “It seems like an important relationship.”
Many of my fellows killed themselves when the shadows got too long and the memories were way too much to take. I have been there myself, many a time. I am still here, yes, but it is very ‘for the grace of God go I’.
He had presented himself as an applicant for the position of manservant to the eldest Winchester the very next day.
"And the thing is, I always wanted to get my hands on you," said Dean. "But up here, who knows if I have? Are these even hands? Everything's abstract, including the sex."
This story had a strange trajectory, I am aware. I suddenly arrived at the point of realization that I know a great deal about shipping and logistics but I didn't want to give anyone any ideas, so to speak. We are not at a time in our history where I feel comfortable doing that, because who knows who might be reading? So I actively changed the story outcome for that reason, which I don't do all that often. But recent events made me reconsider.
“The point is, Cas,” said Dean, smiling into the kiss, “I figured some shit out. Now let’s go get my little brother and kick your big brother’s ass.”
as I say, whenever I say it,” Castiel explained as he slammed into Dean again, making his point. “If I want you on your knees and sucking my cock, you will do it. If I want to fuck you, anywhere, everywhere,
But he found it slightly disturbing and mysterious, how long it had been since he’d received anything but silence on the other end of the line.
“Hey, I freaked out, okay?” said Dean. “Anyway, he seems to like it, and that’s what matters – right?”
“Yeah, yeah, and you’ll buy me a fur coat and treat me like a lady,” said Dean. “Fuck off with this sugar daddy shit. Cas is a fuckin’
building in him, and then Castiel’s, and then Dean’s, an incredible loop of desire and power, longing and yearning that had been building for years upon years.
Dean threw his duffel bag down onto the motel bed and pretended he didn’t hear a word that Cas was saying.
“This what does it for you, Castiel?” Dean taunted, and Castiel’s great black wings stretched up and out, shadowing over him.
Try as he might, he still couldn’t imagine Castiel sleep-heavy with mussed hair, or wearing anything apart from the same blue suit and blue tie. He must wear something else to bed, Dean reasoned, but he just couldn’t see it.
He grit his teeth, turned away from Dean and the crowds, the confusion in his head and his heart, and went to prepare for the night.
Castiel could sense an uncertain hesitation behind him, but he was betting on Dean's pride getting the best of him.
Because, much like in those stories, it seemed as if they had been whisked away by magic and brought to a place of their wildest dreams.
Normally Dean would stab his own eye out before asking such a vulnerable question, but needs must, and desperate times, and everything.
Also, Dean is so fucking oblivious xD this has always amused me. I've known guys like this - so repressed they are almost inside out. It's funny but also a little sad at the same time, like what kind of life, what kind of world conspired to create this kind of attitude and inability to understand and recognize their own desires?
Finally, Castiel positioned himself and slid into Dean slowly, that tight, incredible heat making him groan low in his chest.
He was pulling off a blue tie, and Dean now saw that the suit he wore was not black as he had supposed, but a very dark royal blue.
There is evidence of this phenomenon everywhere – even Legally Blonde shows a rich blonde lady who gets treated poorly by her classmates at first due to her way of talking and manner of dress, despite her being incredibly bright. This woman, conversely, would be immediately accepted into drifter and hobo society, should she happen upon it.
To any and all drifters, this looks like being buried alive and expected to like it. To any and all drifters, this looks like being damned to live as all those who stand still wish us to do: not because it makes
"Isn't that why you assigned us to the X-Files, sir?" asked Mulder. "To investigate the impossible?"
"Ah, shit, I remember that," he said. "Fucking of course I end up - look. You're in Betty's Rooming House, yeah? Remembered the phone number."
Those three days had been longer than his entire billions of years before them, and notable for that reason.
“I know you to be from another land, very far away,” he said. “I am a fool, but a fool sees all, because who cares if a fool sees you? In your faraway land, I am given to understand that perhaps a love such as this one is frowned upon. I have seen Athens; I know of these prejudices.”
