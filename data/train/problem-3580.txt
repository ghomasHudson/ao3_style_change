"First and foremost," she said as she slipped her hands into a pair of gloves. "We'll make sure that this little fellow is doing okay. If you could lie him down and take off the onesie." Dean did as he was directed to do, his mouth dry with fear and worry. Cas stood slightly to the side, trying not to be in the way.
Dean turned around slowly, his breath catching in his throat when he came face to face with Lawrence High Schools resident bad boy, Castiel Novak.
"No," he mumbled as he kicked his shoes off. He felt boneless, like all of the anxiety has been pulled from his body, leaving him exhausted and heavy in the best way.
A stepping stone. It felt like a stepping stone. They would watch a movie, Jack would finally get some quality time with his father, and Dean would hopefully get the same. He'd start off a respectable distance away, get Cas used to his presence again. Then he'd slide closer until he could touch his husband, maybe pull him in, kiss his forehead absentmindedly like he used to.
"What is wrong with you two? Where the hell were you?" Dean asked as he shut and locked the door again.
Dry cleaning feels like a task that will hang over his head until he forgets, so after his coffee, Dean goes to the bedroom to gather it up. It's sitting in the corner of the room where it had been since that night. The button up and the jacket are both wrinkled beyond belief and they smell like cigarettes. Dean rolls his eyes at them as he tosses them on the bed. The pants are a little bit better off, he shakes them out to get the legs to straighten out, and something hits his foot as he does so. He moves the pants and looks down, his chest seizing at the little stick of foil sitting on the carpet. The pants fall from his hands as he bends down to pick it up.
"Close your eyes," Castiel whispered as he reached his hand towards the plate of pie. Dean swallowed hard as he let his eyes fall shut. Every move Castiel made had Dean perking up, waiting for a touch he knew was coming. Castiel's finger pressed down in the middle of Dean's chest, dragging down to just above his belly button. He felt Castiel shift down, then his tongue was there, licking up what Dean could only assume was cherry pie filling. Castiel finished licking up the path he made, then his finger was making a line from one nipple across his chest to the other nipple. Dean shuddered when Castiel leaned down to lick it up, his tongue swirling and flicking. His teeth closed down around his nipple, making Dean gasp and arch into his mouth as the pleasure swirled with pain. Castiel sucked and bit at his pec, not doubt leaving bruises, being just as meticulous as was with the row of hickies he left on Dean's collarbones. They had made him blush furiously every time he looked at them.
"Don't pretend like you care!" The outburst makes Dean flinch. "Don't pretend like you give a shit about me."
"I want you," Dean said as quietly as he could while also making sure Castiel could hear him over the music.
"I have the girl for twenty more minutes, you can't wait your turn?" The man grumbled, sounding irritated. Deans jaw twitched and he'd pull the trigger in an instant if it wouldn't draw so much attention. So he drew the gun back, tilted it, and slammed it into the back of his head. He slumped forward and Anna whined beneath him. Dean shoved the guy off and picked the handcuff key from his pocket. He freed the girl's wrists from her restraints and helped her sit up, pulling the blankets over her naked body and removing the gag. She slumped a bit, her eyelids heavy and her pupils blown.
"Dean, do you think maybe it's time to get him help? Like Lawrence Psych Center help?" Sam asked carefully.
"Fuck, can I," Dean cut himself off with a shaky moan, his eyes fluttering, barely able to keep them open as every single one of his senses was filled completely with Castiel.
"Thank you," Dean hung up and tossed the phone across the room, lowering himself down, forehead to the floor, sobs dying on his tongue.
room, at least in Dean's head it had. Castiel would text Dean to meet him there, and he was always early. The woman at the front desk would see his face, give him a little smile, and hand him the key without him even saying a thing. Room service always showed up at some point, usually after they've had sex. Brilliant, mind blowing sex that Dean never imagined he could have with someone his age, albeit a year older.
"Love you too, daddy," Jack whispered back. His pretty green eyes were red and filled with tears, Dean forced himself to look away before he furthered Jack's distress with his own emotions. He walked to the kitchen once Jack started clicking away at the tv. He searched around the counters and the fridge in case Cas had left a note or a clue, but there was nothing.
"Um, I, yeah, thanks," Dean stuttered, slowly pulling his hand out of the other boy's grip. Castiel looked him up and down, cocking his head to the side thoughtfully.

Thankfully Castiel wasn't close to Lisa through most of the rest of the routine. They practiced for another two hours before they were allowed to go back up to their rooms.
“I know,” Cas nodded with a soft smile. “It was the perfect storm of distance, time, and arguments. I don’t think either of us are to blame, but I still tear myself apart every once in a while for ending it so rash,” she said.
He did his business and washed his hands with minimal anxiety, but his breath started to catch as he walked out. He stood still just outside of the door, looking across the room at their table. His friends and his girlfriend were all conversing without a care, he knew all of them had their own set of discomfort and anxieties, but he also knew they flourished in social situations. Benny was the only one who suffered like he did, but he was distracted by Charlie and Lisa. Dean knew he was fine, so he ducked over to the kitchen area. He was directed to the back door by one of the waiters and instructed to prop it open. When he pushed through, the air hit him hard. He sucked in a lungful as he propped the door open with a brick.
She lives behind his eyes. She takes up full residence in his dreams, unyielding on his brain. He finds himself driving by the shelter more times than he cares to admit, trying to catch a glimpse of her, if only for a second. It makes his skin itch when he doesn't. There's a pack of Peach gum sitting in his center console but he doesn't know which brand she gets, so they all smell slightly off. His brain hasn't been this mangled since those first few months.
"Fuck, fuck, don't stop," she cried, gripping his hair hard and digging her head back into the mattress. "Oh god, don't stop," she moaned, Dean's fingers pinching her nipple and massaging her breast. A gasp was torn from her throat as she came, her hips stuttering against his mouth, her eyes squeezing shut, her thighs trembling.
"Gross," Charlie grimaced. Dean snatched the tequila and took a long, generous chug, shaking his head at the tingle that ripped through him.
When the judge awarded them full custody, they cried. They cried right there in the middle of the court room until their attorney guided them out. Sam and his wife, Eileen, and kaylas mother, Judy, met them outside of the courtroom and they took turns hugging Jack.
"Now, now, now," a deep, smooth voice spoke close to his ear, a body pressing up against his back. "Surely you can't be so fucking obtuse that you don't see how uninterested he is in you," the person behind Dean said. The voice was familiar but Dean couldn't place it. The boy's eyes widened a bit when he looked over Dean's shoulder, his mouth parting.
Dean pulled himself up from the couch with a grunt, shuffling his way into the kitchen to get the hamburger meat out of the fridge. He prepped it quickly, seasoning it the way he always does, adding a little less paprika because Lisa had said he put too much last time. She was right, Sam had scrunched his nose too, then again they both think Hot Cheetos are spicy. He puts a dash more then mix it all together to start forming the patties.
"Maybe six?" He said it as more of a question. Castiel moved his thumb and replaced it with his tongue, licking broad strips against Dean's entrance, not pressing in just yet.
"No, you're right. I haven't been sleeping too much recently. We're making plans for a new album and I'm anxious to start performing again. Isolation will do that to you, I guess," he shrugged.
"Okay, yeah I'm seeing someone," he admitted, a lump building in his throat. "A guy. I really like him, he's just, not really the dating type, ya know?" Dean shrugged.
"Why not?" Sam pushed. “You were so in love with her and she helped you so much, you’re telling me that there is not a single part of you that wants that back?
"Why don't you stay up there? Leave in the morning," Dean suggested, tugging Cas around once he'd set the timer for the pie. He gripped the mans hips and lifted him onto the counter, moving in between his legs.
"She's not obsessed. She said the date went really well and she really liked him. She was going to ask him out again but you swooped in and seduced him," Abigail said.
"Am I not doing that?" Castiel asked, grinding his hips again, his nail dragging over Dean's nipple, making the boys thighs shake where they're clenching around Castiel's waist.
"Dean," he breathed, his young face twisted up with too much worry. Dean tried for a small smile, lifting his other hand to pull Sam in for a hug. Sam was very careful, holding Dean only around his shoulders. Dean ran his hand over his little brothers back, closing his eyes as he breathed in the familiar smell of his sibling; warm oak, a scent that Dean always counted on when he hugged Sam. A scent Dean memorized when they were sitting in the police station waiting for Bobby after their father killed himself.
In the third photo, the skin around Castiel's bullet wound was completely cut open, blood soaked towels everywhere, Castiel's face lax and pale, his arm hanging limp over the edge of the table. Dean closed his eyes for a second, trying to push back the heat building up behind them.
"Yeah," Castiel started pulling his hips back, withdrawing his fingers and ignoring the whine Dean made. "You needed someone who could treat you like the good little slut you are," he thrust back in hard, his cock slamming back inside, his fingers plunging down inside of Dean's mouth, making him gag.
"I just wanted to talk to you about Clarence," Meg said with a defensive tilt of her head. Dean's jaw clenched, his fingernails digging into his biceps. "I'm worried about him and I don't think you're really helping the situation." She said. Dean reared back a bit, his face pinching in confusion.
Finally, after a lot of pain and a glass of water, Dean can talk. He’s still not allowed to sit up though, and he can already feel the restlessness prickling under his skin.
“Yeah,” Dean’s voice broke, he slumped in the chair with the weight of that simple sentence, it was like the world had been taken off his shoulders. He was free but he was tired, emotionally and literally. “I was too scared to let you get close because I knew… I
“Good.” Dean can only manage single syllables now because his brain is too focussed on how much it doesn’t want to be having this conversation.
Dean took to cataloguing everything that made Cas smile, he wrote each thing down in a journal he kept under his mattress like some sort of teen girl in a chick flick. Every time Cas made happy noise, or even just lifted the corners of his mouth was written down, including whatever caused it and the date. If Cas frowned, this was also written down, as well as what had happened to cause that too. It had been three weeks since Dean had started to do this, Jody and her crew of girls had turned up after three days; Donna had come two days after that, even they had noticed the change in Dean. They commented after it any opportunity they got. So far Dean had figured that anything he did that took Cas into account without him thinking about specifically making Cas happy made Cas smile the widest. Once he’d figured Cas preferred apple pie over cherry, so he bought the apple, but it hadn’t been about making Cas smile, or making him happy; he’d done that the same as how he knew Sam preferred bolognese over marinara pasta sauce.
“I guess with Chuck not on our side, and there being no archangels left, this time it really is for real. Final. You know? There’s no way he’d be able to get grace back. This is it. I think, like The End.”
Dean left, he couldn’t stand there and listen to Cas pouring his heart out, not when Cas didn’t even know he was there. It wasn’t for him to hear, he realised. The thought shook him to his knees. Cas didn’t want to talk to him. Not anymore. He’d tried so much and Dean had just brushed him aside, thinking that his own problems were more important. Or bigger than Cas’s were. He had been cruel. He had been selfish. But he was going to try and make up for it. Not that he really knew how. The way Sam apologised to him was through pie. The way he apologised to Sam was by talking things through in the Impala after a good hunt. But how was he supposed to apologise to an angel that was a thousand years old? Pie probably wouldn’t cut it.
“Say it, Dean,” Cas said softly, his mouth was curved in a tiny smile that barely touched the corners.
“I think… I think it was his inherent humanity,” Cas leaned in, closer. So close, Dean could feel the puffs of his breath on his face. “How he was so very human, and how I was fascinated, and then as I watched he became something more. Brave, and kind, and clever.”
“Don’t waste the time you got left Dean, life’s too short and too bloody for that. Just, hang up your hang-ups, you know?” She walked out, her boots thumping on the stairs as she went. Dean waited until he heard the front door slam, they must be taking Donna’s car, which was parked a little ways down the road. He took a deep breath before he went down to the library.
“Nah, he knows ‘m not clever enough for that. Sammy’s the smart one outta us two,” Dean laughs, glad for an excuse to turn the subject away from himself.
“Jody,” Dean groaned, “please don’t do this to me, first Sam and now you? I don’t… I’m not like that.”
“Uh, actually, Mrs Esmund, that would be great. I was heading to the Lark Motel,” he shifts, waiting for the pity or the anger that normally came when he confessed he lived in a motel.
“When I was sixteen!” Dean waved his hand, he remembered the time, he and this guy from school had actually been making out. “And sure, dad saw what he wanted to see, nothing like that was going on. He brought over his games console and we were dicking about,” He coughed, and ran his hand through his hair, he was sure Jody knew he was lying. “We were sitting closer than normal but the game was… intense… look, I’ve never… I’m sick of trying to explain myself.”
“Cas is… its just…” Dean was getting flustered, a blush was rising on his cheeks and Sam knew his trap was working.
“For you to realise that maybe you deserve happiness, and maybe that’s what caused everything that happened between you and him?” Her voice was quiet, as though she was telling Dean a great secret.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, “Jody seemed in a hurry to get out here, she dragged Alex away from some interesting research we were doing. She said that they needed to go get groceries and also that there was a movie on that she wanted to see; they even took Sam, though there wasn’t enough space in the car for you or I.”
“Cas is? What? A friend? A brother?” Sam said, “Cause that wasn’t what you do to just a friend, and it certainly wasn’t how you treat
Dean wakes up in a hospital room. It’s white and as far as he can tell, empty, apart from the beeping machines next to him. Though his eyes are still trying to focus, everything is a blur. He chokes around a pipe that runs down his throat and, panicking a whole lot, tries to sit up. Only to get pushed down as a nurse runs into the room.
Dean is sixteen the first time he notices a boy. He’s also in Bessemer, Alabama, which is probably not the best place to notice a boy. It’s 1995, and the summer vacations have just started, meaning that both he and Sam are out of school. Dad is MIA again, gone off on a hunt about three days ago which means Dean can take a break for once in his life. Their motel also has a slightly gross looking pool. But Dean doesn’t care about a little mould, it’s too hot to stay inside with the AC on the fritz. And there’s only so much Scooby Doo a 16-year-old can watch before going insane. He’s sick of lying on his bed in a pool of sweat.
“You’ve seemed happier these last five days than you have for years, Dean, but I think you have to realise that Cas is still going to be angry with you. One simple apology doesn’t make all the shit right, you gotta know that.” Sam looked at him from the passenger seat of the impala. “He’s still mad with me.” He sighed. “Which I know he has a right to be, I never stopped you from doing that stuff, and I should have. I should have known it was wrong.”
“I was. My father spoke to me for the second and last time that day,” Cas looks like he wants to reach out and touch Dean, but he also looks like he’s determined to stop himself from doing so. “He told me that fate had changed her mind, that we were to meet before our previous time. I think,” he sighs, “I think that is why your soul knew me when I pulled you from hell. I have been watching over you since you were fourteen years old.”
The reason Dean likes Waffle House so much is that no matter where he is, he can always count of Waffle House to look like Waffle House. He gets the corned beef hash, which is the same thing he always gets along with a black coffee. Then, he just sits and soaks up the linoleum covered atmosphere. It’s just after three in the afternoon, and hash soaks up the last of his funds, but Dean can’t really bring himself to care as he eats the oily fried potato and beef that gets set down in front of him by a waitress.
“What should I do?” Castiel has never spoken to his father before. He trembles from the power of the being standing before him, but he also knows so much love, boundless amounts of it. He is blessed.
“Nah, our dad is workin’ on a job in the area,” Dean sits down a little way from Nick, swinging his legs into the pool. The water is cool around his feet and ankles, and he can’t help but smile a little. “What ‘bout you?” He gestures vaguely at Nick, careful not to look at him too much. The panic was definitely rising now, what had been a brief sort of worry was starting to take form in Dean’s head. He thinks this guy is hot. He likes this boy like he likes girls. But he isn’t supposed to. Dean Winchester doesn’t like boys. Dean Winchester likes girls and only girls.
Dean sits in an internet café, he’s typing out a quick email to Nick, hoping that Nick’s not in class, hoping that Nick checks his email. If everything goes right, Dean might have a place to sleep for the next few days. If not, then who knows what he’s going to do. He’s going to have to use the last of his money to buy himself more time at the computer, he can probably eek another hour or two out of the crumpled ones he has. His coke is now seriously watered down because he’s let it sit for too long, and he’s pretty sure that a creepy guy is watching him from the other corner of the room. Dean can’t help but breathe out a sigh of relief when the email notification chimes.
The path became more winding, twisting and lurching from left to right, but it didn’t feel like it was working against him. Dean felt more that this place was supposed to only be reached by people who really wanted to find it. He could hear the sounds of waves lapping against a shore far in the distance. The path continued on with the soft scent of pine accompanying him along the way.
“You can’t what? Dean, I know you think you don’t deserve happiness. But that’s not true. You deserve to be happy, and if Castiel is going to make you happy… then maybe that’s what he’s waiting for.” Jody put her hand on his shoulder, her eyes were wide and her face had changed from a smile to down-turned, but soft frown.
“I was there,” Cas says, moving closer again. So close that Dean could almost reach out and touch him. “That day.”
“So, uh, it isn’t even my place to say, but it’s good to have you here.” Dean nodded along with what he was saying, which in hindsight it would have been good to plan out. “And I wanted to let you know… that… I’m sorry. For all the shit. It’s not cool to treat family like I’ve treated you. And before it might have been easy to pile up the crap on someone who couldn’t feel emotions like I did. I guess, I just got into the habit of doing that. And somewhere along the way I just… conveniently forgot that you feel those things now. That you feel it all. So… that doesn’t make it any better. I know. I just… I wanted you to know that I’m sorry.”
“Yes,” Castiel says, moving closer to him. “You think that you are undeserving of happiness, you think that you are grotesque, no better than the monsters you hunt. But I have known true evil, I have stared it in the face. I have seen the turning of the Earth for countless millennia, and I have never seen anything more brilliant than your soul.”
“And I kicked him out, and told him he was dead to me,” Dean wanted to slam his face on to the steering wheel. “You know, when Kevin died, he told me that he should have been there. Even after he was
“At first I was simply obeying my father, or I thought I was, but then I realised he didn’t give a damn what I did. Then I was scared, you were twenty years old by then, and I was scared that if I showed myself; if I got to know you in the flesh, that I would fall.” Cas looks down at the gravel, shuffling his feet around.
“Yeah we met,” Jo smirked, “we heard all about what you’ve been up to. A rusty nail? Really? Didn’t you like, help kill God or something?”
They got home to the bunker, it seemed like it was empty apart from Cas, who sitting reading on a chair at the farthest end of the room. He didn’t have the trench coat on, instead he was wearing a plaid shirt and Jimmy’s pants; it was a weird combination but Dean thought Cas wouldn’t want to hear that from him. Instead of making some stupid joke, Dean slung his duffle over his shoulder and walked towards his bedroom. He could hear Sam great Cas as he walked away, which honestly made him feel like a piece of crap. As he always did, Dean decided to torture himself a little, he paused in the hall to listen to what they said.
“Yeah, Sam, we both screwed up. But I was the one who told him he was dead to me. All I did was lose both my best friend, my mom, and my kid in one fell swoop; when it didn’t even have to be that way.” Dean said. “I told him he was dead to me. For a mistake that all of us made. I was around you when you were soulless, and I knew what Donatello was like; it wouldn’t have been much of leap. Sure, Cas should have told us, but… we should have known too.”
“Yeah, no,” Sam nodded, “if that was it, I’d say Chuck was losing his touch, you know. No, I don’t think Chuck is done with us yet. If he meant welcome to the end. You know, writers lie.”
He drove until he saw a small dirt path leading into the trees. Something in him was pulling him that way. A tugging in his gut. And Dean being Dean couldn’t leave that feeling well enough alone. There was a very convenient lay-by right beside the entrance to the path, so Dean held his breath and pulled in. Anticipation built up in him, the same feeling as though he was standing in the queue to a rollercoaster. Not quite knowing the feeling of being on the ride but imagining the sensation of it. The desire to know how the ride felt pulled him forward into the forest.
“Yeah, she mentioned that to me,” Dean nodded, sitting down, “hey Cas, when we first met, you know in the barn.”
Dean drew in a shuddery breath and walked forward, his legs like jelly, as though he was a tiny child taking his first steps. He wobbled across the jetty, even though the water wasn’t rough enough to rock it.
“I don’t care,” Sam tells him, getting this solemn look on his face, too serious for a boy of thirteen.
“Home.” The word tasted sweet on his tongue, warm like spiced apple pie, or honey; Dean settled back into the soft leather seats, letting the bit of road illuminated by his headlights guide him back to the bunker. For a moment his head was clear of worries about Cas, and about the end of the world, Chuck was ousted from his place at the forefront of Dean’s head, and the only thing he was focussing on was the road in front of him. It made a nice change to longer be worried about something. The last few years had been life-changing event after life-changing event, hitting him in the face like brick walls.
“You’re okay,” the nurse tells him, “you’re in Wellstar West Georgia Medical Center. We’ll get that tube out in just a moment.”
“Dean. Come on. You know. That wasn’t you being angry at a friend or a brother. That was more like a break up.”
“Cas, I… I love you,” Dean felt the words leave his mouth in a rush, like he couldn’t wait to get them out. The moment after he said them was silent, it dragged on endlessly, time stopping around them as the world outside the table and chairs in the softly lit library ceased to exist. Still, neither of them moved. Like a note played on a guitar string, ringing eternal into the air between them.
He staggers to the bed, thinking. Dean doesn’t even know what happened to Nick after the last time they saw each other, all he has is an old email. Somehow, he thinks, it would be wrong to dredge up the past again. He’s quite content to let Nick live in his memories. Perhaps, it would be too painful to see what adulthood had done to the boy with gold hair. His thoughts drift. It has been years since he’s thought of men. Years. He’d gone back to John, and more importantly, to Sam and had tried not to look at other boys again. It has become a habit. Even when John Winchester is long dead, it is a habit of Dean’s to not look. To turn his head in the other direction. He wonders what Nick would think of him now. Whether he’d be disgusted. Dean’s not sure he wants to know.
Dean’s not really sure what else he and Nick talk about, but the afternoon turns very quickly into evening. They’re still by the pool talking when the sun makes a last effort to stay above the horizon. Somehow, they’ve migrated closer to each other, and now Dean is pretty sure he can feel Nick’s shoulder brush against his. Nick is laughing at something Dean’s said, and Dean is damn captivated by this boy, he can’t even remember what he’s said. The way Nick comes alive when he laughs is crazy, his face lights up, and he looks like he’s shrouded with something that’s not quite human. It doesn’t make Dean feel like ganking him though, which is new.
“You been drinking?” Dean laughed, shocked, “or Rowena’s death is hittin’ you harder than I thought. Cause you’ve obviously lost your damn mind.”
Dean stopped. His stomach plummeting. That small unspoken thing that had settled in his chest woke up. It raised its head above the parapet of his heart and hooked its claws back into him. He turned to stare at Bobby, who just raised his eyebrows and took a sip of beer. The thing inside him swelled so that it felt like it would take over his whole chest. He looked at his shoes because he felt as though Bobby would see the thing if he looked him in the eyes.
Chuck had told them that the End had come. The capital ‘E’ End. Finale. Period. His time was running out; if Dean didn’t do something, and soon, he would loose his chance all-together, though he may have already lost it. It was time to dig down to that buried part of himself, where
“Yeah, well, I believe it’s time for me to make my exit so you can stew over what we just talked about. Good chat, Dean. Good luck.” At this, Jody stood, she wiped her hands on her jeans and smiled down at him. “I think I’ll take the girls and Sam on a little trip to the movies for, oh, I don’t know three to four hours.”
“Huh,” is all Nick says, pulling out a packet of cigarettes and sticking one between his teeth. After lightning the thing, he leans his back and takes a long drag, blowing the smoke out in the wind. Dean watches him, cast golden in the light of the sun beating down upon them, and for a moment Dean isn’t himself. For few a golden, shining seconds Dean is just an average sixteen-year-old. He wishes he could pretend for a few more minutes, but Sam’s tugging on his leg and grinning, and then Dean is suddenly back in his body.
“Yeah.” Dean said, holding his head high, his jaw set and shoulders solid. He wasn’t scared anymore, the thing inside him that was once a monster had become an old friend. “Yeah, it’s like that.”
“Yeah, you did, I just… I have no idea what I’m doing man.” He huffed, “I just need you to know that I- that…” he drew in a very shaky breath, “me too.”
“Dean, please, you’re happier than you have been in a while, I’ve never seen you like this but I know there’s something on your mind, and I would hate to see that good mood ruined by whatever it is that’s weighing on you.” She hopped off the bonnet and sat beside Dean, stretching her legs out in front of her.
“Yeah. Good point.” He chuckled nervously, running a hand through his hair, “I… uh… I thought about it. A lot. What you said, I thought about it. About you and what that might mean for me.”
“I watched the Earth come into being. I cried as Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge. I followed your earliest ancestors out of Africa and watched as civilisation bloomed there, as art was created there. I felt the flint people used to make tools with, I held it in my own hands. I was there as the people built Stonehenge using trees and rope. I watched as in, Australia, people, walked in Dreamtime. I celebrated the building of the pyramids, and the making of the terracotta army, the calendars in South America. I wandered the onsen in Japan and marvelled at the heat in the water. I danced to the Dong Song drums and then, wept as the library of Alexandria burned, and the streets of Teotihuacan were emptied. I have seen the might of the Roman Empire and have also seen it crushed under the weight of its own power. I watched as people in India and the Middle East unlocked the secrets of the universe. I saw time after time human beings fascinated by creating circles out of the earth, and I watched as you people did terrible things to each other. I gazed on in horror each time you tried to kill each other.
The case was a pretty simple salt and burn, it took them fewer than three days before they were on the road again. All that happened was Dean getting slammed into a wall in a way that his knees could no longer take, he was getting old, and no longer recovered from hitting the floor on his knees quite so quickly. It took him over-night to feel like he could drive again. They had given Cas the better part of five or so days in the bunker alone, without Dean, both of them reckoned that it was enough time for a (no doubt traumatised) angel to settle in. Sam was speaking to Dean a little more, without the capital ‘C’ conversations now. And, honestly, Dean was in a pretty good mood. He was ready to start figuring out how to take Chuck down. He was still keeping one box of emotions nicely taped down though, this one had iron and silver chains around it, but the rest of his emotions had been slowly gone through day by day and night by sleepless, night.
“Cas-“ Dean croaks, but he cannot turn his eyes away from Cas’s face, he is glued to the spot atop the bonnet.
as a human, after I kicked him out, he beat himself up about Kevin cause he wasn’t there… man how fucked up am I?”
Until, suddenly, as though he couldn’t stand it anymore, Cas stood and walked around the table till he was in front of Dean. He tugged Dean by the collar of his shirt and pulled him up until they were nose to nose. Dean’s brain had only just caught on to what was happening, or what was about to happen; finally, his synapses recovered from the electric shock of Cas being so close so fast. He wound his hands around the back of Cas’s neck, drawing his closer still, they’d spent so long being apart that Dean no longer could cope being separated. So he dragged Cas even closer until all that separated them was a few centimetres of cloth.
Eventually, after what felt like hours of walking, Dean came to the edge of a small lake. The trees thinned and a sort of muddy beach started leading toward the shore. There were mountains surrounding the lake, gilded in soft sunlight. Water lapped at the edge of the lake a few meters ahead of him, there were boats out there in the centre, but they were too far away to be much but an afterthought. He looked slightly to his left. Sitting, on the edge of rickety looking jetty was a man in a trench coat. Dean stopped. Wondering if he should go and talk to the man, because obviously he knew who it was.
“I couldn’t hear them, in order for me to get to heaven, Jack had to make me human again; my grace was gone.”
“I hope your dad stops being an ass,” Nick laughs, “keep in touch, Dean, who knows maybe your dad’s business will bring you to Auburn when I’m there.”
“What?” Dean grunts, not bothering to look up from the computer. (Bobby bought it for Sam, but Dean has temporarily stolen it). “If there’s something wrong, you can tell me, you know.” Sam gets it out in one quick sentence.
“I’m not,” she shakes her head, “I think that makes you pretty damn smart, no matter what you think about yourself. If you tried, if you really tried, when you get to high school you could easily go to college. And a great one at that.”
Please leave comment, let me know how I'm doing... this is the first time I've written for the SPN fandom in like six (I think) years so just a little assurance would be nice... or a kudos? Idk... just... please?
They’re not in Bessemer until August. They leave a day later. Dad’s killed whatever it was that was taking kids. And Dean is back to being the perfect soldier. Not before he sneaks back into Nick’s room though.
“I.” Dean thought about going for a drive. He thought about taking the Impala (who looked so pretty in the golden sun) down long windy roads and never looking back. He itched with the feeling of it. “I think… I think I’m going to find Cas.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean mutters, sinking into the cheap plastic leather seat of the car, “I’m never going to college anyway.”
“I wonder that even happened? Like for real happened?” Dean thought out loud, “I wonder when he started to Fall for real. D’you think he’ll be able to get any mojo back?”
“It was his fault!” Dean shouted, slamming his hand on the table. “He should have told us about Jack, and he didn’t.”
“It wasn’t supposed to happen like this,” Castiel watches as the car slams into the back of the truck, he has seen so many futures, pasts, and presents, but he knows that this was not supposed to happen.
“I don’t,” Dean whispers to no one in particular. He remembers every detail of that night. The way Castiel’s hair was tousled. How the bullets tore through his shirt. His flesh giving way below the blade of Dean's knife. The way the angel pulled the knife out. Dean remembers everything. He remembers the guilt, turning into an inferno. Why should it have been him the angel chose to pull out of hell. Why not any one of the countless individuals that had been sent there.
It ends with Nick kissing him. He’s just won a game of Mario Kart when it happens. Dean’s really not sure which one he’s happier with. He’s grinning into the kiss now, with the music from Rainbow Road playing in the background and Nick’s lips on his own, Dean’s not sure life could ever get better. No matter that they’re stuck in a shitty motel, no matter that Dean’s dad would probably kill him if he could see his son now. None of it matters, because Nick’s lips are soft and warm, and Nick’s thumb is stroking across Dean’s cheekbone, and honestly, Dean has never felt more wanted.
He almost ran back to the kitchen. He needed Sam to tell him what Cas would think. But Sam wouldn’t know, so he wouldn’t be able to answer that question anyway. No, Sam would very calmly raise an eyebrow at the fuck up, then he’d just as calmly and not a little sneakily take a screen shot and he’d message that screen shot to himself and he’d sit on it until the right moment came to go print it in one thousand copies and plaster the goddamn bunker with them. And then he’d just smile and be so damned pleased with himself and…
And so he did and it was lazy and a little sloppy and fucking fantastic and Cas’ hand moved into his hair and their chests connected as Dean pulled Cas on top of him and they kissed and kissed themselves properly awake until they were both so awake that there was a slight concern they’d wake up Sam in the process.
said the first text and the second text was a link. The fucker had made him a playlist. Dean couldn’t keep the grin off as he pressed the link and was taken to Spotify, where he eyed the titles and his grin felt like it might break his face in half. Cas had put his heart into songs for him.
And he left the room and he thought oh, I still have his tie like here’s your tie like isn’t this the tie you bought that time like haven’t you missed this tie like it’s so important I give you this fucking useless thing to tie around your neck right now because if I don’t focus on this useless thing I’ll focus on this one thing that matters the most and I know you hate ties but here’s this one back.
Obviously, they’d got business as usual, even after life changing decisions had been made, all thanks to a goddamn winking emoticon. But however he griped, Dean had to smile a lopsided smile at the thought, glancing up at Cas, their hands still locked together, Dean feeling his whole body unwind, loosen, at ease, unable to resist as he caught Cas’ eye, he widened his smile a tad, and gave him a wink.
Morning had turned to afternoon had moved into evening was inching towards night by the time the door of the bunker opened and Cas walked through it.
Dean felt like he should look away, but he couldn’t. Eyes on Cas, and Cas’ eyes in his, and everything was quiet except that rush of blood in his ears. He held onto the tie like it was a length of rope attached to something unimaginable. Time stopped.
Okay, don’t freak out, it’s fine. But this could be taken way wrong, given the possible context. Shit, Cas would think he was laughing at him. Okay, calm. Calm down. Calm. But his hands were shaking as he frantically tried to think of what to do. He stared at the wall, then at his phone, then back at the wall, his phone, then sent the heart emoji.
“I do hate ties,” Cas confirmed, Dean’s treacherous toes suddenly knocking against Cas’ under the table and Dean was smiling and they weren’t even fucking drunk, but he felt drunk and happy and stupid and fine with it.
Then Dean got up and made coffee and got some half-stale Danish from one of the kitchen cupboards that they could dunk to their hearts’ delight and he got an orange because they were Cas’ favourites and he got the paper for no reason other than that they should have a paper in bed and he came back to his bedroom, hair on end and lips still swollen from making out with Cas and he thought he might explode from the happiness he felt when Cas looked over at him from where he was laying, still in bed, naked, with only Dean’s sheet for cover, hair sticking up unapologetically and the same happy grin on his face that Dean knew he was wearing.
They read the newspaper in severe silence, both dunking their Danish and chewing it loudly until they burst into a fit of giggles at the forced domesticity, chucking the paper out of bed and going right back to the kissing and touching and exploring, learning new things every time fingertips ventured into new territory. Once they’d had their fill again, Cas settled against Dean, throwing an arm across his midsection and kissing his shoulder before their eyes met.
“I got an A+?” Dean turns to her, “are you sure? You gotta be making a mistake,” he laughs. It must have been the research he’d done for his dad the night before. He had been so tired during that test, he can’t even remember not trying.
Dean sat there for a while digging his fingers into his temples, “Shit.” He sobbed, the word was torn from his throat. He’d never really stopped long enough to examine his own emotions, had never really allowed himself to, if he was being honest. Dean supposed he could blame it on his dad, but he wondered (as he sat with his head on the table) if that was giving himself a free pass to being lazy. Blaming everything on his dad would sort of ignore the fact that he’d been an adult man for a rather long time, that he should have really looked at his behaviour and his emotions long before that moment. He hadn’t though. Every time it had come up, he’d skipped over it, ignored it and buried it deep down. Dean wasn’t even sure if Sam knew the depth of how he felt, not just about Cas.
“Dean?” Nick touches him on the shoulder, Dean almost thinks that the heat of his touch is going to leave a handprint burned into his skin there. “We can just play Super Mario if that’s what you wanna do.” That’s not all Dean wants to do, but he nods and gets up anyway, throwing the t-shirt he brought with him over his shoulder.
“No, I didn’t,” Castiel nods, jerking his head up, “I thought it would be better if I were a silent observer. It wasn’t until I had pulled you from hell that I decided to show myself.”
“Thank you, uh, Linda,” Dean nods as she brings around the coffee pot over to him and fills the slightly grubby mug with it.
“Thank you,” he could hear Cas’s smile, he could see it in his minds’ eye as he turned to walk to his room. “Did Dean tell you he apologised to me?”
“Sam told me you and Cas had a huge fight a couple of weeks back. Now, I don’t know him that well, but I know you, Dean Winchester. And you seem happier than you have in a long time.” Jody was sitting on top of one of the cars, handing him tools cause she insisted that Dean could do whatever he needed doing by himself, even though she was more than capable of handling a car herself.
“They’re a reason, I guess. I wouldn’t use them to excuse how we both have treated you. You’re family, maybe Dean has a different meaning attached to that, but you are our family and we should never have treated you the way we did.” Sam smiled, Dean bet he was laying a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
Nick didn’t bother singing off the email, Dean smiles, and sags with relief. He might have somewhere to sleep tonight. He hopes Nick is attracted to him still. Dean shifts, before he gets up and leaves the café, after signing out of the computer. Dean doesn’t really know where he’s heading, it’ll probably be a Waffle House because he knows that he can order three coffees, and sit in there for hours.
“Thanks,” he said, “for the soup, man. And for everything. You never had to do what you’ve done for me. And… uh you always showed up, dude.”
He’s setting up his room in the bunker, when he finds it, in the box that he keeps the more embarrassing things in. A polaroid, taken nearly twenty years ago, of a boy with gold hair hanging down around his face, like Brad Pitt. Dean stops. The world rocking around him into a standstill. His whole awareness zeroes in on this picture. Slowly, shakily he runs his fingertip down the boy’s face. Dean remembers the way Nick felt, the way he had been awakened to a part of him he’d never known existed. They’d stayed in touch. For a few years at least. Then Dean’s John had found the emails, and Dean remembers the shouting that had followed. John had kicked him out of the motel, had given him a case on the other side of the country and had told him to stay away until he was ‘in his right mind’.
“I do not consider your attraction to men a surprise Dean,” Cas smiles, softly, the barest upturning of the corners of his mouth. Dean tries to stop himself from staring. “I have been watching over you since you were young. I know every aspect of what makes you, you. Remember I rebuilt you from the ground up.”
“Yeah, it was… it sucked, Jody, it really sucked. He walked out and I didn’t do a thing to stop him… hell, I pretty much held the door open to him and waved him on his way. It wasn’t good… but, I’m trying to make him see I’m sorry for that, and maybe we can just go back to the way we were. You know I’ve been pretty much emotionally absent for a few years, what with everything that’s happened. I realised I was pushing all my crap on to him, you know, I was too busy thinking about my problems to even realise what I was doing to him.” Dean said from under the car, so his blush didn’t show.
“Cas,” Dean began, his voice was hoarse, it croaked out of him like it didn’t want to be used at all. “I know you don’t wanna talk to me, and that’s fair, I get it. The past couple’a days I’ve been thinking, about all the times I’ve been a dick to you. And, you know, man, I’ve been pretty awful to you the past few years. And,” he coughed, as Cas stared at him, blankly, “I wanted to tell you that I get it now, it’s not okay for me to pile all my shit up on you and make you feel like crap cause I’m going through stuff.”
“So what?” Dean took the soup, “he makes me soup but won’t come talk to me? Yeah that’s real adult.”
“I- I-“ Dean can’t seem to work his brain. It has obviously suffered a major malfunction, and now no longer knows what words are. He is scrambling to reignite the guilt inside of him, to remember how the pain he had become so used to feels.
The trees started off sparse, the light of the sun peeking through their branches, creating patches of warm golden light. Flowers were dotted here and there, bluebells and foxgloves and snowdrops. Not that Dean knew the names of any of them. He was pretty sure he spotted deer and rabbits too. It was like walking through a Disney movie. Dean didn’t hate it though, it just felt like paradise. Like he was where he was supposed to be in that exact moment. As though all of time and had space had worked together to put him there. Which in a way they had, but, it felt like this was his choice. He had chosen to follow the path; he had chosen to pull into the layby. All the universe had given him was the opportunity to get in the queue to ride.
“Yes.” Cas said, “we have all been through a lot. But, you have never been cruel, Sam. You have never hurt someone. Not like that.”
Looking back on it, as Dean does, years later in the yard at Singer Salvage that’s really when the guilt started to set it. All consuming. Demanding to be felt, the blame had smouldered away in Dean for years. It isn’t that he could have done anything to save his history teacher that day, it’s more the thought of the fact that he didn’t die himself. It’s an awful, hateful, ugly thought. But it’s there. Growing inside him like a disgusting cancer, not the kind that can be cut out. He feels it when he sells his soul for Sam, or when he lets yet another monster rip into his body so someone else can get away. Dean feels the guilt all the time. It never leaves. Like some sort of spectre, always with him, haunting him. Sometimes, when he’s knocked unconscious he sees the semi headed towards him, he can smell the oil and engine fumes and the iron like the tang of blood. He thinks about all of this sat on his ass on a bonnet, looking up at the stars as best as the light pollution from Sioux Falls will let him.
“You really need to pull your head out your ass, Dean. And you need to do it soon, cause if you leave it too long, it’ll be too late pull whatever you and Cas had, or were heading to, back.” Sam stood, and left Dean there sitting in the library alone with his head in his hands.
“Oh, is it?” Sam said, laying his trap, “how so? What makes Cas different Dean? Cause for me, at least, Cas is like a brother. He’s been around long enough. He’s always been there for us, for what? Like it’s been over a decade now since he pulled you out of hell, and
"I know right? So inconsiderate," Castiel chuckled. He wrapped his arms around Dean's shoulders, his fingers tangling in Dean's hair.
"Shh, you're doing so well for me. Turn over," Castiel's hands guided Dean gently onto his back. He settled between his thighs, sitting back against his heels. Dean laid back with a soft breath, watching as Castiel lifted the hem of his shirt and pulled it over his head. A lump formed in Dean's throat as his eyes quickly mapped out the other boy's chest. There were multiple scars on his golden skin, one below his left pec, another along his rib cage, two more at his hip. The biggest one stretched from below his armpit all the way down to his hip, thick and raised. Dean reached up without really thinking about it, pressing the very tips of his fingers to that scar, tracing it down to the Castiel's hip. Cas watched him, his expression revealing nothing. Dean looked back up, his mouth closing on a swallow when he found Cas' eyes already on him. Castiel licked his lips, reaching down and gently gripping Dean's wrists, pressing them down into the mattress above his head.
"Fuck," she breathed out heavily, looking up at the ceiling with wide eyes. "Holy shit," she relaxed against the bed, letting the aftermath of the pleasure wash over her, her leg stood hooked over deans shoulder. He pressed kisses along her thighs, gently setting her leg down as he kissed up to her hip and along her belly. He kissed up the valley of her breasts and she tilted her head back to give him access to her neck.
"That boy really loves camping doesn't he?" Miranda shook her head. The car prattled a little on a bit of uneven road. Cas gripped the side of his door, trying to stop his stomach from clenching.
Castiel guided Dean to the bedroom, and he miraculously didn't trip as he walked backwards the whole way. Cas stripped Dean of his shirt and pants, helping him out of his shoes and socks before gently shoving him back onto the bed. Dean loved when Cas took a second to undress himself, instead gathering his fill of Dean, naked and laid out on the bed. It took Dean weeks to stop shying away from Castiel's eyes, weeks of Castiel whispering sweet compliments into his skin, sealing it with kisses to make sure it stuck.
"I really hope that's true, and I wish that you didn't have those things instilled in you so young. I am so grateful that you learned to accept yourself because then we wouldn't be standing here, and here is a pretty great place to be," Castiel said, gently cupping deans face.
“You think you’re not smart enough,” Mrs Esmund nods, “well in the one test you bothered to study for in my class, Dean, you got an A+. Now tell me, how a kid who is not smart, can get an A+ in a quiz on local history? Especially when he’s only been in town, three weeks?”
“I know.” Sam took a deep breath, Dean would bet ten dollars he was scrubbing his hands across his face. “I know that. I just, I know how you feel. I mean, since you told me how you feel about him. I want to help you. And him. Cas, the way our dad brought us up. If Dean had shown any weakness, and feeling like that about
“Cause dad wasn’t the one teaching me, Cas,” Sam sniffed, “Dad never taught me anything. Not how to be a man. Not how to tie my shoelaces. Not anything.”
“My parents are dragging my sister and me to see our aunt in Auburn,” Nick shrugs, splashing the water about with his legs. “They want me to apply to the college there. They think this visit will be good for me or something.”
“It’s not his job to talk to you, not after you kicked him out,” Sam shrugged, “So, I found us a case, which gives him a little time to settle in here without you. Or you can man up and go talk to him.” He turned and looked at Dean, “look, he wants to talk to you. I think, he does anyway, but you gotta go to him this time. He’s coming back and grovelling anymore. If you need me, I’ll be in my room, packing. I’m gonna leave at like four thirty-ish, so if you’re coming on the hunt meet me at the garage then.”
Dean. You did that to him. Honestly, he went to hell again for us, and the thanks you gave him was, what? A fuck you, and don’t come back? He’s been trying to get you to forgive him. He’s been trying to talk to you, but you’re too emotionally stunted to even see that.”
“So you just decided to… what? Blame him for something that wasn’t actually his fault, and then push out your
The Roadhouse looked like it always had done, heaven hadn’t touched it up or anything; it was still slightly grimy, slightly run down. Well. Very run down, and very grimy. But Dean didn’t mind, he didn’t seem to mind much anymore. One thing though, there was one thing left unsaid, and he had a nagging feeling about it. Something, the only thing, he could possibly have carried into the next life was something that he had carried with him for a large part of his first one. And now, now when it was too late, he was free enough to admit it to himself.
“Look, Dean, you have seven broken ribs, a punctured lung, a fractured wrist, your right femur is broken in three places, your left is broken in a pretty nasty way, not to mention the fact that you have fractured your skull as well. It’s a miracle you’ve woken up at all, there is no way we can let you sit up.” The doctor finally loses his cool the twenty-eighth time Dean asks to sit up.
“Your parents are cooking tonight, over at their place, everyone should be there. The whole gang, if Bobby can convince Rufus to be sociable for once, and if Ash gets his head out of the computer for once.” Ellen smiled, “I’m sure you know but time moves a little different up here, and there’s someone waitin’ for you there too.”
“Nah, it’s all good. Cas and I just had a few things to sort out is all,” Dean stood dragging Cas with him, refusing to let go of his hand. “You guys met or?”
Part of Dean had known, he thinks, he had always wondered… there had been too many close calls, times when he was sure he’d be seeing his last glimpse of light. Too many times he had felt the crushing weight of a well-placed hit and lived to see the next day. He’s always been lucky, quick to heal, hardly ever sick, but he realises now with a calming sensation that he’s always had someone looking out for him even when he thought he was alone. The thought should scare him, but it doesn’t.
“I got some homework to do, some books I’m supposed to read,” Sam says, “in case we’re still here in August.”
“I don’t know.” Sam shrugged, “either we prepare, and freak out and then nothing happens and it’s fine but we spend the rest of time strung out. Or we don’t prepare and then the worst happens and we try to muddle through like we always do.”
Cas was sitting in the chair he was normally at, his face was sculpted into a frown, and he had another flannel on. This one, Dean recognised as one of his own, not that he cared; they’d been pooling laundry for the last few weeks and he was sure Sam’s terrible orange shirt had ended up in his dresser. He couldn’t deny though, seeing Cas in his clothes was definitely doing something for him. Cas looked up at him and smiled. God. It had been a long time since that happened. They’d talked over the last few weeks, sure, but Cas had only begun even treating him like a friend in the last week. It had been. Good. So good. To see Cas smiling at him, laughing with him again. Repairing their friendship had been so worth it. But Dean was about to risk it all. Doubt rushed at him faster than an eighteen-wheeler on a highway. He wasn’t sure. Despite what he’d heard in the corridor.
for you, against freaking heaven, Dean. And what? You let him go? Like that? Cause Dean you’ve made mistakes, and you can be dumb, and stubborn and ridiculous. But that? That wasn’t dumb, that wasn’t you being pig headed. Dean, that was fucking cruel.”
“Ah,” Dean nods, jerking his head up a little, “I guess that cat’s out the bag. Surprise.” Dean grins, feeling a little weight off his shoulders.
“Oh uh,” it’s Dean’s turn to be confused now because he’s pretty sure he’s been hiding this fact about himself since he was sixteen. “It’s just… you know…”
Cas, I… I feel… I couldn’t let myself feel all these things for you, so I pushed you away but I still feel… I… You… I need to… I never thought I would feel like this… Cas.” The words were stuck in his throat. They refused to be said, and everything was happening too quickly despite the fact that nothing had actually happened.
Jody looked down at him, the soothing smile was still on her face, “Sam told me you were kicked out cause your dad found you with a guy?”
“Look,” Mrs Esmund says softly, “please, don’t waste that mind you got. You’re really smart Dean, and you’re funny, and most importantly you have a kind heart. You know you have it all, and you could really make something of yourself if you bothered.” She takes her eyes off the road for a minute. And that’s all it takes. She doesn’t notice the semi that’s spun out of control in front of them, the rain is pouring down and it’s getting dark. The car goes into the back of the truck, hard, and Dean has no time to think.
Cas’s back was turned on him when he first walked in, but Dean coughed and Cas turned around. Dean looked at the angel, who was probably more human then, he properly looked at Cas for the first time in a long time. Cas looked like he was barely holding things together, as though he was made of duct tape and superglue, a broken china pot cobbled together and barely keeping in one piece. Dean could relate. But he wasn’t facing the cause of his breakage.
“Don’t think so black and white. I never said you were gay. Dean, the way you talk about him, it sounds like you’ve been married for years,” Jody said, smiling just a little bit, she spoke like she was trying comfort a scared animal.
“So, Jack did all that?” Dean asked, looking out at the scenery, the beautiful mountains with the sound of a trickling brook nearby; it was so beautiful, so close to the paradise he’d always imagined.
“Sure, Dean,” Sam smiles, looking at him with kind eyes. Dean is sure the kid is far too perceptive for his own good. He makes a mental note to never speak to Sam about this.
Of course, there was still one box of emotions he hadn’t tackled, but everything else that had been rolling and broiling around inside him had been slowly unpacked; he was feeling lighter than he had in years. He’d spoken about it with Jody, talking to her felt good, there was no judgement there. Never had been, but he’d been too pigheaded to realise it. They were sitting in the back garage one night, Jody’s car had hit something on her latest grocery trip and Dean was taking it as an excuse to look over it in detail.
“I get you,” Sam turned to look out the window. Kansas’s golden fields stretched out beyond even the horizon. Never-ending fields of wheat and corn, Dean loved it, whenever they left the midwest he felt somewhat lost. “I wish we’d seen it earlier. That he was feeling everything we did to him, you know. More so, we should have known he would feel it. He’s been more human than angel for a while now hasn’t he?”
“Is it his rugged good looks or his wicked sense of humour?” Dean asked, wondering if they both knew that they weren’t really talking about Han Solo.
“Yeah, I dunno, man. I have a bad feeling about this,” Dean sighed, “we need to get everyone to the bunker. Everyone who’s left I mean. I am not having any family left on the streets at the moment. I want everyone where I can see them.”
Cas watched him, eyes the colour of the still blue water below them. The slight chill in the air had made his cheeks go all rosy and pink, and the delicate golden sun had changed to a warm blush. Fluffy white clouds floated on the breeze, before they disappeared into nothing but tiny whisps of candyfloss pink.
Sam’s hugging him before Dean can stop him, though Dean’s not sure he minds this hug. Most of the time they’re too much. Too many sensations for him to handle, hugging brings up too many feelings, but this time. This time, Dean sinks into it. Letting the feelings wash over him. He’s not sure how he landed a little brother this awesome, he can’t fathom what he did to deserve it, but he sure is grateful for it. And he’s pretty sure Sam will pretend not to notice the kiss Dean drops onto the top of his head.
Dean stayed in his room for two days. He knew it had been two days because Sam had asked if he wanted breakfast twice. Both times he’d grunted and rolled over, ignoring his brother because interaction was far beyond his mental capacity at the time. Led Zeppelin had been constantly pouring out of his headphones, and food had been scavenged from whatever Sam left out for him. Which actually, hadn’t been that bad, a departure from the swill Sam usually cooked. The clock by his bed read a healthy three pm, when he surfaced, a full day after Sam had last asked Dean to join him.
And then Cas is gone, with a rustle of wings, he leaves as quickly as he came. Dean is left alone, to puzzle the secrets of the universe from the top of a car’s bonnet in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He sips his beer a few more times, looking up at the stars and wondering if Cas is watching him from wherever he is. Dean sends up a silent thought, a prayer to the angel,
You can’t actually blame him for mom, he didn’t kill her, Dean.” Sam said, coming into Dean’s space and poking him in the chest. “You don’t get to decide what is and isn’t Cas’s fault. If Belphegor was really trying to absorb those souls he would have been unstoppable, remember when Cas was God? When he had that power? Right? You know… maybe, just maybe he was trying to stop that happening again? Maybe he’s the only one who has been as consistently on our freaking side in this messed up life we’ve had. Do you even want to think about what the dude has been through for us? He gave up an army for you. He’s died for us more than anyone should have had to. He took all my crazy after the cage, he took it all and suffered hell for it. He rebelled against
“Do you?” Dean turned to look at him and found himself falling again for the lines on his face and the scruff round his cheeks.
“Huh.” Bobby huffed swigging his beer again, a wry sort of smile painted on his face. “It’s like that, then?”
, he hopes Cas hears him and that the thought conveys everything he means to say. There is so much locked up inside him, so much that his brain can’t deal with at the moment. It’s going to take much more brooding on car bonnets before he can come to terms with everything that’s spinning around in his brain.
“Dean!” Sam was walking down the hallway towards his door, a plate of food in his hands. “You’re actually up.”
“Sure,” Dean snorts, they’re pulling up to the highway that leads to the motel, if Dean’s lucky, his dad won’t be home.
“Joanna Harvelle if you don’t give those boys five minutes, I swear to… I swear on your grave I will-“ Ellen said, running towards them out of the trees. “Sorry, Dean, we wanted to surprise you, but..”
Because him flirting with Sam would seem really off. Because Cas had been flirting with Dean for weeks. Or so Dean thought. Which was why he’d almost sent that message five times. Chickening out every single time because with Cas he wasn’t sure, he was never just sure of himself around that dickhead. He could be cool and he could act all nonchalant and unmoved, but the truth was that Cas had made his pulse jump into higher gear for years now. For fucking years. And it didn’t look like it was ever going to change, this effect Cas had on him.
Like a momentary lapse of focus. Like he didn’t mean to do it. His jaw clenching, his hand flexing, his throat swallowing, and Dean picked up on every single thing because now he was actually looking for them, and his heart lurched forward like it was on a goddamn roller coaster and suddenly he felt sick.
There was now a hysterically laughing smiley followed by a heart and that was his reply and what the actual hell was that even supposed to mean?
He swallowed, glared at his phone, thought about throwing it across the room to get it away from him and forget about it and trust that Cas was fine and that he wouldn’t have texted Dean this stupid emoticon if something really bad was going down, he’d have texted Sam, because…
Finally he sat perfectly still for a few moments, deciding just to send the smiley face, his thumb hovering and then quickly pressing the emoji and the send button in one swift movement and he closed his eyes.
Not over the aubergine, but over that regular smiley. Send a smile back. Simple. Could mean anything. Could mean
“Timing,” Cas had repeated, suddenly frowning softly, growing thoughtful, and Dean knew that the mood had turned from irritation to a whole new set of questions and that he’d averted a clipped conversation that never really amounted to anything, following the same pattern of unspoken things that they’d had for a few years now, skirting the issue of… something.
When he opened them they grew wide as he realised, with a tremor of horror, that he hadn’t sent the regular smiley, he’d sent the one that was laughing out loud-ing all over the place with eyes squeezed into sideways Vs and a big toothy grin all over its annoying yellow face.
He gently tugged on the already loosened knot, making the tie come undone beneath his fingers, eyes meeting Cas’, who was looking at him with a slight, questioning frown.
Could mean that he was a complete and utter dickwad who didn’t know fuck-all about how to communicate using fucking pictures and simple symbols because he was lesser than a goddamn four year old.
Better stay away from the cryptic emojis and should he use pictures or should he use symbols, mimic Cas or branch out? The problem with emojis was that even though he had no idea what they all meant, he knew there was a whole thing to it, and Cas probably knew all about it because he actually liked emoticons and he used emojis for swift communication, too. He’d always sent a string of them, though, cobbling together some sort of story, usually having to do with where he was currently at. Car-City-Phone meant he was on the road and he’d call when he’d arrived. Phone-Daytime-Hourglass meant he’d call in an hour. Phone-Nighttime-Hourglass meant he’d call in an hour. He just liked being specific.
It made Dean smile without opening his eyes, running his hand up to Cas’ shoulder, pulling him more tightly against him.
But he chickened out, had mumbled something about how ties suck big time and stuffed it in his pocket as he got to his feet because his skin was heating and his face was flushing and he could barely breathe and he “had to get to bed” so he ran the fuck away from that almost kiss and now there was this goddamn emoticon winking at him and his mouth was dry again and maybe he should just send the fucking aubergine. He had some inkling of what it might insinuate.
Why was Cas winking at him? What the hell was this supposed to mean? Why was he winking at Dean at five-fifteen in the goddamn morning? Had something happened? Was this actually code for him being in real trouble? No. Cas wouldn’t have sent this of all things…
That’s what Cas would say. And the corner of Dean’s mouth lifted in a small smile at that thought, and he closed his eyes because fuck, how does he do this? How does he not screw this up? He’d been up against the wall more times in his life than he could count, than he could even remember, but he’d never been scared like this. There was this white-hot fear at the thought of losing Cas again and it simmered over his skin, under his skin, through his flesh and veins and into his blood and it made his heart feel like it was going to stop. If he ever lost Cas again…
“Oh,” Dean mumbles, scratching the back of his head, “well… that’s still a thing, I still… I. Sometimes, you know, not much since Dad but…” he flails his arms around a bit, thinking that that will make things clearer. “I… when things got hard you know… I did some stuff, Cas, some shit I’m really not proud of.”
“Oh.” Cas says, and he sounds so painfully human that Dean almost forgets he isn’t, “you probably want personal space.”
“What do you mean?” Cas was looking at him with hooded eyes, Dean couldn’t answer him, the words wouldn’t leave his throat. “You were scared to let me be a friend, because… you thought that if I could be your
“Sometimes, you think so loudly, and I know you asked me to stay out of your head, but sometimes you just think so loudly that I cannot help but hear…” He trails off, shifting around in the chair. Dean wonders when things became so awkward between them. He wonders why they have to dance around each other.
“Just,” he sighs, closing his eyes in the way that adults did when Dean said or did something wrong, “just wait for your father to get here.”
“Because none of them are you,” Castiel appears by him, standing a few meters away. “I fell for you, I have killed my brothers for you, I have defied the will of my father. And I did all of it for you. And do not for a moment feed the monster that’s the guilt in your stomach, thinking you do not deserve it. Because, Dean Winchester, I have never known another more deserving. Good things do happen.”
“Right before Chuck decides to royally screw us over with another apocalypse, cause I don’t know about you, but I bet that ghost pit was all Chuck meant when he said ‘Welcome to the End’.” Dean scoffed.
“Jesus.” Sam breathed out, before he sat opposite Dean, “now’s the time, then I suppose.” He murmured to himself, smiling just a little. “You’ve forgiven me for doing worse.”
“Oh,” he says, stopping, and facing his history teacher. “None of the buses go the way I need them to.” He shrugs, “my dad had to pick up my brother so I thought I’d walk.”
“Actually, Dean, this isn’t just your house; you don’t get to make all the rules about who can and can’t live here. So, I asked Cas to come back because he’s like a brother to me, and I never intervened with whatever you guys were doing before cause it was none of my business, but now, I can’t just step back and let you shit on Cas. Dean, I literally drank demon blood, and then ran around without a soul for a year. You became a fucking demon, dude, and what Cas makes the same sort of a mistakes that earn us free passes and suddenly he’s dead to you? No man, you’re just too afraid to get a grip on your own feelings.” Sam huffed, and handed Dean the bowl of soup he was holding, “Cas made this for you.”
“Yeah, I know, I mean… the first time we met face to face?” Dean laughed, he loved it when Cas said things like that, it made him yearn for the simpler times, but he appreciated Cas even sitting and talking to him.
The road was long, lined with pine trees, asphalt smooth and unbroken in front of him, the sun was a soft warm golden glow. Perfect corners and lines to throw Baby into, her wheels barely felt as though they touched the ground. Driving hadn’t felt this good for years, it had become something to get him from A to B in the end. And Dean had been tired. So tired. Now though, it felt like flying. A joy that been rekindled in his heart, for the first time in a very long time, Dean felt at home on the road.
So. So this was heaven. A breeze skipped along the tops of trees. They waved their branches in the light wind, a ‘pleased to meet you’. Dean sniffed, the air smelled clean, with just a hint of tarmac and pine. The pain from the nail was gone, the weight of his death, of leaving Sam, was gone. The sky was blue and the clouds in it were fluffy and small, not the kind that brought rain but the kind that floated along never minding anything. It seemed like the perfect kind of day, the kind of day where if he wasn’t on a job, he’d spend under the hood of his car with his sleeves rolled up and his jeans covered in oil stains. A sort of harmony where everything was singing at once in time and tune.
“There’re so many people who I thought I wouldn’t get to see again, not properly anyway, but nothin’ is gonna beat a hug from mom.” Dean sighed.
It was like coming home but being flung out to space all at once. Dean was floating and being grounded. Cas’s lips on his were dry and a little chapped but he didn’t care once there was a hand in his hair dragging him closer still. Their noses brushed, and Dean could feel Cas smiling. His hands finally remembered their own existence and came up to Cas’s face, cupping his cheeks and brushing a thumb over his jaw. Dean had had a few drunken tangles with guys before, but he’d never kissed any of them; it wasn’t different, and it definitely wasn’t bad.
to see the signs… So I just didn’t. I let myself blame Cas, thinking that would… I dunno. Absolve me of the horrible guilt I’ve been feeling, but what I was really doing… shit… I was pushing away someone I… someone I, you know, care about, I suppose.”
“Well, hey, where are you going to?” The teacher asks, Dean wracks his brain the woman’s name, he can hear the radio coming from her car; the music is quiet beneath the noise from the rain. It’s cold, and Dean had to stay for detention so it’s going to get dark soon, he’d rather not be out in the rain and dark with whatever it is that’s on the loose.
“Yeah,” Dean nods, he’s leaning up against the door. “Don’t have long, dad’ll want me back in a few.”
