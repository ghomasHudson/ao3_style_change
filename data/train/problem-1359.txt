David Wentworth’s mewling increased after a phone call to the US Embassy failed to provide a sympathetic response.
Campbell-Williams snorted. “Too right.  But he teaches creative writing classes and workshops.  Hates doing it, but he’s charming and popular, so he makes a reasonably steady income off it.  I suspect he spends more than he can afford showing off his girlfriend at fundraisers and galas.”
Ivan and Sara sat down as well, and Svinarnikov came around the fire to sit by them.  “You were a soldier, am I right?” he asked Ivan.
It wasn’t like that, Ivan didn’t say.  I only met him yesterday, he didn’t explain.  Because somehow, at some unmarked point, it had become
John was relieved to discover that the clothes Sherlock had laid out on his bed were at least his own clothes, dark jeans and a cobalt blue shirt. Nice without being overly dressy.  The sort of thing he might wear on a first date, although presumably this was
“Well, indeed,” Pauline replied in a softer tone.  “My Joe served with the Fifth before your time.  He was on leave when we met and started courting.  I told him I didn’t want to be an army widow raising children on her own.  He had a good record, his superiors liked him, so he managed a transfer to the... a different regiment, one stationed here in London.  He served there until the Revolution.  We opened the pub after that.”
His self-consciousness only increased when Sara opened the door, took one look at his face and burst into laughter, however quickly she stifled it and ushered him inside.
“Apparently Sherlock interviewed him for the position of usher, deduced his past involvement with and continuing interest in me and issued a sort of personal injunction. Oh, take your head out of your hands, darling. David will get over it. Sherlock’s just being a bit over-protective. It’s rather cute.”
“But this isn’t your thing. I knew that and I asked you anyway and it’s amazing that you took the time to research dating, uh, protocols and you were, well. You were perfect. But this isn’t your thing.”
smell of the flat he’d shared with Mary.  Being alone here was different than being alone there.  The silence here didn’t mock or accuse him.
John made it up to his own room, tried and failed not to think about what Sherlock might be doing one floor below and came all over his own sheets the moment he touched himself.
“A field of ripe rye needs to be harvested, dear, whether it’s for a test or not.  You came along while Misha was working, and he recognized you.”
“Harry, I didn’t come here to listen to you talk about Sherlock. For once, I’m here to listen to you talk about
With a rush of air, Sherlock swooped to ground, landing only a few feet in front of Ivan.  “I can not guarantee,” Sherlock said tersely, “that this will work.”
When they reached the house, Sherlock bounded into the kitchen yelling.  “Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Hudson!”
It was the custom of this empire that whoever would sit upon the imperial throne must be married.  Watt Yakovlevich had married as young man and ascended the throne on his father’s death.  He was a bold and popular ruler, and his lovely tsaritsa gave him two fine children, the Tsarevna Harrieta Watovna and the Tsarevich Ivan Watovich.  The years went by and the children grew.  The day came when an embassy arrived from a foreign land, bringing with it a portrait of the Prinzessin Clara von Niemetz and a proposal of a mutually beneficial trade treaty.  Upon seeing the portrait, the young tsarevna fell deeply in love.  Her father gave Harrieta and Clara his blessing, a fine country estate and, in hopes of continuing the succession, four dozen strapping young footmen.
“Aunt Martha says to tell you that she’s not your housekeeper and the tea will be up shortly.  Put these in the bedroom?”
Oh, hell.  If Sherlock had managed to land a boyfriend, this situation was about to get all the more awkward.
He bought a ring, asked Mary out to dinner and made reservations for them at the Landmark. He wore his best suit and combed both his hair and his mustache with care. (He still wasn’t sure about the mustache, but Mary seemed to like it.) He showed up a bit early, as it wouldn’t do to make her wait for him, and then had to deal with an overly solicitous waiter armed with a wine list. Finally Mary arrived, looking so lovely that John’s nerves got even worse. Still, he’d invaded Afghanistan, he could
“Yeah, at the moment we’re assuming that Magnussen was the intended target, Sherlock was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He said he was attempting to retrieve incriminating letters on behalf of a client whom he can’t name. ‘Professional courtesy,’ he said, and I can’t fault him for that.”
But then Sherlock’s scowl morphed into something more thoughtful. “Mycroft told you... and you remembered.”
Sherlock continued to watch him a moment longer, then turned away to look out the window until their cab pulled up in front of 221B. Sherlock swirled out of the cab and into the building, leaving John behind to pay.
“It still doesn’t make sense,” grumbled Sherlock. “I’m doing well enough with the yoga.” He demonstrated by sliding neatly into a half-pigeon.
be because my officers reported a disturbance at the pawnshop last night, which is why I was asked to check out the area at a time I’m more usually having my first cuppa!”
“No. No, I haven’t. You want honesty, Mary? You want the truth? The truth is that I don’t give a rat’s arse what’s on that drive. Who you were, what you did before you met me is irrelevant. All I needed you to do, the
“There’s a second set of footprints on top of the paramedics’.” Sherlock glared at Lestrade, who shrugged again.
“Everything seems to be in order,” Weasel allowed grudgingly.  “You’re clear – at least as far as housing is concerned.”  He gave the skull a meaningful look before all three of them left.
The second day was much the same as the first, but the third started off with Andreyev declaring that he was tired of apples.  Why couldn’t there be plums?  Or apricots?  Why always apples?  Finally even Tyuleneva, apple juice shining on her chin, told him to “shut it.”  When the company finally got underway, she walked alone.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “The sheets will still smell like Mary. We can swap the beds tomorrow. Tonight, hmmm” – he nuzzled John’s neck – “there are other things I’d rather be doing.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulder and clung to him, staring into his eyes. “John? John. I couldn’t tell you.” He grimaced in pain. “You had to be shown. But Mary did save my life.”
“Sherlock, I’m leaving half the food in case you want it later.  You should eat something.  I’m going to sleep now, but wake me in two hours so I can take my turn at watch.  You need sleep, too.”
“I’m thinking robbery gone bad,” Lestrade continued. “Young punk with a knife grabs senior and demands his wallet.  Senior has a heart attack.  Punk has enough of a conscience to phone 999 on his PAYG mobile, but takes off before the ambulance arrives so he can’t be arrested.  Takes the wallet with him.”
Finding himself with a book in his hand and full pot of hot tea, John settled in to wait for Sherlock.
For one horrible moment, he fell freely, the wind whistling past his ears as his stomach made a good attempt to climb into his throat.  In the next moment, something changed.  Something
“The thing is, Uncle Don was smart. I mean, he was demented, but he was still smart.  You can’t just, you know...” Tyler trailed off.
have got turned around occasionally, but I don’t think so.  Of course, at the time I was in better shape, with more suitable gear – and a horse!  It will take us longer now.”  Her eyes scanned the others as she spoke, tallying their weaknesses, weighing their chances.  She too, Ivan realized, was thinking and planning.
After that it was like a dam breaking.  The guards asked question after question, each more irrelevant than the next.  Ivan was in the middle of detailing what the tsar’s favourite horse ate for breakfast when a loud shriek sounded from the palace.  All the guards turned to look.  “The alarm!  Intruders!” one cried out.
“A little of both, then. Lestrade’s going to set a guard outside your room in case the person who shot you makes another try.”
Lestrade looked askance at Mrs Hudson, but John nodded. “The tabloids. Sherlock knew that once Janine’s story appeared in the tabloids, Lestrade would have more questions. So what does Sherlock know that he doesn’t want Lestrade asking questions about?” John started to pace back and forth across the living room.
When the court physicians declared that Ivan was as recovered as he was likely to get, he asked his father and sister for an audience.  They met in the tsar’s private chambers, behind the great hall with its black draperies and empty throne, well aware that the tsar’s advisors waited just outside the closed doors – or possibly, listened at the keyholes.
Not bothering with thanks, Sherlock began to circle the room again, this time paying close attention to the floor.  He stopped next to the body and got down on all fours, crouching almost with his nose against the floor.  Then he straightened up, removing a sampling bag and a small spatula from his coat pocket.  Only after taking a sample of the dirt on the floor did he turn his attention to the corpse.  First he sniffed at her clothing, hair and face.  Then he bent over, almost laying his head on her chest as he looked up her nose.
“Hopefully it will not be particularly bloody,” Sherlock replied evenly.  “Part the feathers where my heart should be, so that you can see the skin underneath.”
“The continuous widdershins motion of the slaves’ dance created a vortex that allowed Muircheartaigh to draw off their life energy and refocus it to animate the guards.  I located the, ah, item that Muircheartaigh was using as a focal point and smashed it.”
“I’ll work on you all right,” John promised with a grin. “And stop laughing at me!” He slipped one hand behind Sherlock’s cock to fondle his balls, tugging slightly. Gratifyingly, Sherlock did indeed stop laughing in favour of gasping.
“Okay,” said Lestrade, “A young man wearing jeans and something red, probably a jacket. Size 12 feet, looks like.  He hears the sirens getting near, he goes over the fence – I don’t suppose you could spot the wallet or keys anywhere around here, could you?”
to talk about it. Is... Is this visit a problem? Because we can get off at the next station and buy tickets back to London.”
“Of course. Did Mr McKinsey ever speak of his motivations for volunteering for this particular experiment?”
John stared as Sherlock ushered Dexter to a seat at the kitchen table. Only when Sherlock glanced his way and raised an eyebrow did John stick his head back into his curiously uninteresting newspaper.
Sherlock preened a little, but then pointed out, “You could have observed the same details.  You spotted the mug tucked in among the bottles.”
Ivan drew his sword and stepped forward, only to be stopped by Sherlock’s suddenly outspread wings.  “Stay behind me, Ivan Watovich.  My wings will offer you some protection from his spells,” Sherlock hissed.
wide enough for this maneuver, but it was worth the awkwardness to watch Sherlock’s pupils bloom open.
“I’m surprised Mrs H didn’t come up here herself,” John remarked in the silence the reigned after Marie’s departure.
Campbell-Williams’s lip began to curl. “Bioelectric fields,” suggested John, before she could say anything.
“Amplifier,” muttered Sherlock.  Holding the feather carefully, he nudged the tip of the shaft into the keyhole of the case’s lock.  Sparks popped and snapped.  He inserted the shaft a hair deeper with a twisting motion.  There was a flash of light, a particularly loud snap – and the lock fell open.  The air smelled of burnt feathers.
, Harriet.  He’s not...  We were never more than flatmates.  Well, and friends.  And we’re still flatmates and friends.  He’s married to his work, I’m seriously thinking about phoning your tattoo artist.”
“Fine, then, but we didn’t have any chimpanzees or gorillas in the classroom. What we had was a lot alphas and omegas whose pre-pouches were either atrophying or atrophied
But Ivan only felt embarrassed as he explained, “I can’t handle a scythe, not with my leg, but I can follow behind you and bundle the rye.”
, Sherlock.” And then he dove back him to nip at Sherlock’s pale neck, run his teeth along a prominent collarbone. Sherlock gasped and shifted, his leg falling in between John’s thighs. John instinctively thrust up against it, then tried still his hips – only to have Sherlock, ever the quick study, press down harder and roll his own hips.
“Thank you, Ms Caustlin. Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, did you have any additional questions?”  Lestrade held Sherlock’s eyes as he said this.  John could practically hear what Lestrade didn’t add – “
Sherlock hailed a cab when they left Bart’s, and John thought they were going back to Baker Street. Instead, the cab let them off near a small café on a quiet side street where the man who appeared to the owner seemed overjoyed to see Sherlock. The result was a very nice goat cheese and tomato sandwich with a side salad of mixed greens for John and mugs of excellent coffee for both of them.
see that. And you married me.” Mary tilted her head towards Sherlock. “Because he’s right. It’s what you like.”
“I told him what I’d come for.  He tried to turn me away, but I wasn’t having it.  Finally he picked me up and flew us to the castle.  Almost froze my – it was a cold journey.  But I hung on and we got here, we got to the castle gates and
“You don’t have to stop. It sounded pretty good.” Lestrade considered John. “And you’re looking fairly chipper, too.”
Sherlock was already home when John arrived.  The mess in the sitting room had acquired a new layer of books, all opened to specific pages, as well as some new file folders, one of which Sherlock was studying.
“I’ll have no problems clearing your application for employment at the Cromwell and would recommend that you submit it as soon as possible.  Dr Stamford can assist you with the necessary forms.”
Sherlock drew a deep breath and said – just a bit shakily – “I would like to do that again. The date, I mean. Good night, John.”
Andreyev complained almost continuously but moved along with surprising steadiness.  Tyuleneva kept pace beside him, leaving Ivan, Sara and Svinarnikov to tend to the others.  All of the former captives tired easily, requiring frequent stops to rest and have a bite to eat.  The sack continued to provide bread, apples, cheese, dried meat and the occasional welcome surprise – hot pirozhki one time, jam pastries another.
knew Donald McKinsey was the one who wrote Dobrieuzi’s equation on the whiteboard the moment I pointed out that it had been written by a right-handed person using their left hand.”
It was only when John was pulling on his trousers that he remembered the pen drive, still in the pocket. Grimacing, he took it out and tossed it onto his dresser before heading downstairs.
“This would be the brother who’d rather exile you himself than call on political favours?  I’m not impressed with him.”
“To flirt with. And tease.” John ducked his chin a little to look up at Sherlock through his lashes. “And you’ve never found the right partner.”
Still, even psychopaths need physical outlets. John walked through the building’s front door one day just in time to hear a loud thud from upstairs. He ran the stairs and heard Sherlock complain, “It doesn’t make sense! I’m taller than you are and weigh more...”
Anderson looked at him with distaste.  “It’s a crime scene.  I don’t want it contaminated.  Are we clear on that?”
Mrs Holmes merely smiled. “Oh, no, after we bought the aeroplane tickets, I phoned a friend of mine who manages a hotel and asked him to set aside a room for us
Marfa Hudovna was up from the table, bustling about and making tea.  She poured glasses of tea for herself and Ivan and set a third glass and a plate with a buttered slice of rye bread within Sherlock’s reach before resuming her seat at the table.
“If you’re going to think that loudly, you’d might as well say what you’re thinking,” complained Sherlock, looking up from his microscope and glaring at John. He was well into his regular transition from post-case celebration to stroppy boredom.
“Right then.” John got off the bed and stripped with a soldier’s efficiency, letting Sherlock look his fill but not putting on any kind of show. He returned to the bed.
When the last of the food was gone, Ivan tucked the jug back into the sack and the sack back into his belt.  He noticed that the sack with the jug inside felt no heavier or bulkier than when it had been empty.  But then it turned out
“Great, fantastic! Thanks for the reminder – except I didn’t need to hear it from you because Molly already delivered it! Did you
“But you weren’t there.” Sherlock’s mouth twisted in what might have been intended as a smile. “It had been two years, of course you weren’t there.”
Eventually Lestrade showed up bearing two cups of coffee, one of which he gave to John. It was horrible coffee, but it was hot and caffeinated. John drank it with gratitude.
Marfa Hudovna looked relieved and continued with her tale.  “The house was really too large for just Boris and myself, so I rented out the top floor to Sherlock.  Boris... he wasn’t a learned man.  He didn’t understand Sherlock’s studies and experiments.  Of course I don’t either, but I enjoy listening to him talk about them.  Boris seemed to feel... resentful?  Shamed?  It didn’t help that Sherlock’s not always careful about what he says to others.”
Sherlock considered him a moment, then began to lick the salt off his long fingers. John could only watch the tip of Sherlock’s tongue stroking the skin for a moment before he had to look away.
“You said girlfriends weren’t your area,” he said as casually as possible.  “D’you have a boyfriend?”
“I know things look bad, but this isn’t the end,” argued Ivan, “Harrieta is still a young and fine-looking woman, she can marry again...”
The walking stick had been a gift from Uilleam an t-Moireach, who professed not to know the meaning of the characters carved upon it.  “My grandfather was the oldest of seven sons.  The youngest had no children of his own.  He left this to me when he died, and that’s all I know about it.  Luck be with you, Iain mac Bhatair mec Sheumais.”
“Nominally I was under the watchful eye of my older brother, at that time a junior clerk in government.  When the Revolution broke out a year later, my brother and I lost contact.”
“None found on the scene. We should be able to extract one bullet from Magnussen’s skull and the other from, well, Sherlock.”
“Your forensics team failed to note the tattoo under the victim’s right ear that would have given them reason. Call Sofia.”
Sherlock looked at John. John looked at Sherlock. Finally Sherlock offered, “William Sherlock Scott. At least one of those ought to do.”
The long, appraising look Sherlock gave him when he descended from his bedroom almost had John questioning his presumptions, but then Sherlock more or less threw his jacket at him and bundled him out the door and into a cab.
“A herd of cattle couldn’t have trampled the ground more thoroughly,” complained Sherlock, squatting down to examine it anyway.
When John woke up again, it was broad daylight outside. Both the sound of voices and the scent of bacon emanated from the kitchen. He dressed quickly and walked into the kitchen in time to hear Sherlock say, “Anyone of the three of us can find a vein and take a blood sample. Urine samples, you can handle yourself. I can run the tests, and John can help us interpret the results if necessary.”
John considered Lestrade’s thunderous expression and decided to intervene.  “Detective, why do you think Sherlock was involved?”
“I have experiments to work on, I won’t be sleeping until later if at all.”  With that Sherlock turned away in a gesture that reminded John of his uncle dismissing a clerk.
She was holding a phone and John heard her address Sherlock, asking him what he wanted. Good question, thought John.
“Humans,” sneered Sherlock, his gaze icy beneath his crest of black feathers.  Ivan was startled to realize how quickly he’d grown used to Sherlock’s strangeness – until Sherlock himself reminded him.
Did Sherlock really expect...?  Apparently, yes.  John extracted the torch from the indicated pocket, turned it on and held it steady as Sherlock picked the lock.  Inside...
“It’s the way it reflects the sunlight.  Not many other people about, only the guards and seven people moving in a circle.  Dancing, maybe?”
“Maybe the charming bit, but he was kind even when he was letting me down and didn’t need the act anymore.”
“Doesn’t look as if I’m likely to end up with someone who can give them a stable home environment, does it?”
The sun was low in the sky before Manya Bocharova pronounced herself done with the washing.  She helped Ivan get Bezimyan settled for the night with water and grain and then showed Ivan where he might wash up a bit before eating.  Inside the house was only one room, with a bed closet at one side and a stove at the other.  In the middle of the room was a table, with two places laid.  Supper turned out to be fresh rye bread and borscht with sour cream, and nothing the imperial kitchens produced could have tasted finer to Ivan.
“There were several minor incidents,” Sherlock replied calmly. “I presume you’re referring to the scars on my back.”
“Why settle for ‘almost’ when I’ve already got the real thing?” John murmured back. He was rewarded by Sherlock’s smile.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the cheesy line but seemed pleased nonetheless and resumed his story. “After leaving Tibet, I travelled southwards to India...”
“So,” John began, “I’ve seen people – alphas and omegas – wearing these, ah, things.” He gestured at his own chest. “Carriers. For babies.”
When the time came for the rest of the company to disembark, however, the second mate approached Ivan, Nadya and Rada following behind him.  “Gospodin, with your permission I would ask Gospozha Nadezhda for her hand in marriage, swearing that her companion Radost’ shall have a home with us for as long as we live.”
“No,” he croaked. And then more strongly, “No. Whatever your name is now, whatever reason you’re here, the answer is no.”
Feeling a bit foolish, Ivan pulled the sack out and reached into it.  Just in case it might help, he closed his eyes and wished for hot pirozhki, but his eyes flew open again when his fingers touched smooth ceramic and – a bundle wrapped in cloth?  He laughed softly to himself as he drew out a familiar earthenware jug and bundle.
people do.  Have you been stewing over this the entire time you’ve been gone?”  Not that John could blame him, as John had been doing so himself.
John went to the window, but Sherlock wasn’t in sight. He’d probably snapped his fingers and materialized a cab smack in front of Speedy’s.
Ivan couldn’t keep from gaping.  “Sherlock, you’re a six-foot tall bird-man with flame-coloured wings.  How are the guards
This time they ended up in front of a small restaurant.  John couldn’t resist.  “I thought you never ate during a case?”
The creature looked back at him, its silver gaze direct and disconcerting.  “You don’t know the stick’s proper use and you don’t need it for the purpose which you
The guards looked uniformly baffled.  “Himself never gets messages,” said another, distinguishable by his carroty hair.
“Some kind of doctor, I thought, except it turned out not exactly. Dr...  Uh, I’m sorry.”  Tyler’s face reddened.  “It sounded like fuck all.”
The ride took more than three hours, with the bus bumping along badly maintained roads and meandering through incomprehensible detours.  The driver refused to allow any breaks.  The windows of the bus would not open.  From the smell, it was apparent that at least one of the children had wet themselves.
He sounded bitter, angry – and young. The Sherlock of the present-day transmuted before John’s eyes into a young man whose world had collapsed around him.
Ivan tucked the sack in his sword belt, thinking he could use it to store whatever food he found or was given.
Mary sat upright astride him, raised and then lowered herself and proceeded to ride John into oblivion. He yelled when he came, an incoherent cry. The last thing he remembered before he passed out was her face above him, smiling.
“Public school had been full of people like Sebastian. Despite Mycroft’s warnings, I imagined university as being different, a place where students actually came to
want to – both ways.  At least to try, I can’t make any promises.  But we’ve got plenty of time to experiment.  Anyway, Harry’s always telling me that sex doesn’t require penetration to be real sex.”
Oh, hell. Mary. John had completely forgotten to call her and let her know what had happened and where he was.
“Pity.  We could have split the fee.  Think it through next time.  And always insist on hard currency.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Her eyes flickered to John, who stepped back, distancing himself. This was Sherlock’s show.
The other beta’s eyebrows had practically climbed into his thick, grey hair. Lestrade was obviously struggling not to laugh, but he said kindly enough, “Good for you! I’ll call Sofia and then let you know what I find out.”
“First, you’re wearing pyjamas and you’re in need of a shower.  Second, the tea’s almost ready and I’m not going anywhere before I’ve had at least one cup and a piece of toast.  Do you want jam on your toast?  It’s some kind of pricey stuff that comes in a little pot.”
And then his wife, the nurse, pulled a gun out of her jacket, cocked it and pointed it at him. John’s breath caught before he realized. Not at
“Banks is primarily a loan shark. It’s almost certain that Wentworth owes him money.  Curran and Ives, on the other hand, are middlemen.  Get in, get the job done, get out, get paid.  They’ve done a bit of everything, but murder’s not their usual style.  Kidnapping would be, or extortion.”
Sherlock was warm and surprisingly comfortable to hold for someone composed so completely of planes and angles. John, who had had sex with men before but had never cuddled one, reflected that they both had things to learn.
Inside the bedroom, Mary stood pulling repeatedly on a rope dangling from what appeared to be an over-sized door knocker – nailed to the ceiling.
“It wasn’t until that afternoon that one of the other students told me that the chief lab manager was looking for me. When I arrived, she presented me with two dead rats.  She’d discovered them in the midst of violent convulsions.  Since so far as she knew no one else was using them for research purposes – and since I had something of a reputation – she demanded to know if I knew anything about what might have happened.”
Ivan blinked awake to see Marfa Hudovna standing above him, holding a candle.  “I’m sorry, dear, I know it’s early, but you have to get up now if you’re going to be in time.  I’ll go back to the kitchen and finish getting things ready while you dress.  Wear something warm, and bring your sword.”
is currently doing work comparable to ours, Mr Holmes. No one else has the skills or the expertise.  However, I can get you a list of others engaged in research on the same topic.  My cooperation on this point does
“Oh, man, the posh junky!” Nigel took control of conversation again.  “We were in the…  Where were we by then, mates?”
Sherlock made no comment when John gave the cabbie the address for Angelo’s. However, he did raise one eyebrow when they were seated at exactly the same table they’d occupied on their first visit here.
“Look, Sherlock, alphas don’t even knot omegas unless the omegas are in heat. An omega in heat undergoes physiological changes that allow her to experience...”
“Pretty intensely for a few years. Then there was a sort of... hiatus.” John took a sip of wine, swallowed too quickly and coughed. “But I’m getting back into it now.”
The pair were already out of sight by the time he exited the pub, so they couldn’t have gone far before turning off the street.  A muffled noise to John’s left led him to the mouth of a narrow alley.  Further down, two tall dark shapes struggled together.  Light from a window flashed off something metal.  A knife blade, John realized.  The killer had been holding a knife to Sherlock’s side as they left the pub.  If John charged into the fray, he’d almost certainly get Sherlock stabbed.
“You would have arrived here eventually, with me or without me.  What would your chances be, standing alone against a sorcerer?”
“I decided no such thing,” retorted Sherlock. “He was supposed to be out to dinner with the Marketing Group of Great Britain from seven ’til ten.”
Carrying a full bucket of water in one hand while leaning on the stick with the other was no easy task.  The village streets were full of children, running this way and that.  Ivan remembered the jewels hidden in his saddlebags and thought briefly of hiring one of the older children to carry the water.  But Misha had asked him to thresh grain before he would give Ivan any advice, and now Manya had asked him to carry water before she would talk to him.  He was seeing a pattern here, so he made trip after trip to the well, even though his leg ached and his shoulder burned.
be swept under the carpet! John, be a dear and take one of these out to Timothy.” She handed him two cups of punch. “He’s fussing with the fire in the sitting room. And if he starts making little humming noises, just give him a little poke. That usually does it.”
Ivan stared back, feeling as if he stood at the brink of a precipice.  The false tsarevich had ridden from the capital on a false quest to discover and defeat the sorcerer who had cast the curse, but what had been meant as a cover story had suddenly become real.  It was Ivan who stood here now, faced with a potential ally stranger than anything he could have imagined.
This was, by Sherlock’s standards, fairly considerate, and John’s first sip proved the scotch to be decent enough. “Tell me why we’re interested in tall and ginger,” he proposed, keeping his voice down.
Knowing Rosamund would be inundated with gifts of toys on her birthday, he’d presented her instead with something intangible: a violin piece he’d composed.  He’d tried to capture her personality: intelligent, curious, explorative, bubbling with laughter.  John had wiped his eyes and hugged Sherlock afterwards, so perhaps he’d succeeded.
“Then we can’t let word get out.  I must do my courting alone.  I’ll be one more soldier, home from the wars, looking to marry and settle down.”
“That was eleven years ago, Bill.  James VII is dead, along with Queen Alexandra, their daughters and the United Kingdom itself.  If we were abandoned...”
them to change colour.  In either direction.  What will that make of the pro-bonders’ gibberish then?”
“Research scientists can be extremely competitive, isn’t that right, Dr Campbell-Williams? That’s as true in biochemistry as in your own field, physics.  They can be competitive to the point of breaking in, copying data and then covering their tracks with a little casual vandalism.  I’ll need a list of other research groups currently doing work comparable to yours.”
Once John had paid for his new phone, he and Dexter settled in at table in a nearby Costa. Dexter soon had the new phone up and running. John was both admiring and grateful, but Dexter brushed him off.
“Just a few notes,” explained Sherlock with an eerie smile. “It’s a shorthand of my own devising.  Ms Caustlin, did you count the remaining tablets of each of your uncle’s medications?”
“With my help in leaving the country. By the time she contacted me, she’d already made her decision and left your home.”
“Foucault was married briefly in his forties. The marriage was annulled after a few years, as allowed by law in cases where the spouses aren’t soulmates.”
The reason for Sherlock’s impatience – as if he ever needed a reason – became apparent when they got back to Baker Street. Sherlock withdrew a fistful of documents from the inside of his Belstaff with a flourish, threw the Belstaff itself in approximately the direction of a vacant coat hook and then appropriated both the coffee table and John’s laptop, settling in for what appeared to be a major research effort.
John winced, but Dexter surprised him by straightening and smiling wryly. “You’re telling me to learn from what happened and move on.”
“Not at all, I’d appreciate it.”  John’s smile was genuine this time.  It felt good to be recognized as valuable.
A palpable hit, that, thought Ivan as he discreetly flexed his knees and elbows slightly.  He’d only have one chance at this.  Behind him he heard the rustle of fabric that told him Muircheartaigh was standing, stepping forward.  Sherlock stared past Ivan, his attention completely held by the sorcerer.  It was time.
-acting skills, you mean.  When I suggested that it would help if you could limp a bit and flinch when you sat down...”
His sword as well as the sack and the looking glass that Marfa Hudovna had given him lay on the stone floor a few feet in front of him.  Beyond these objects, steps led up to a dais where the man he had seen before now sat upon a golden throne.  The stranger wore an ermine stole over his robes and held a bejewelled golden sceptre.  On his head was a gold crown studded with jewels, lined with purple velvet and trimmed with ermine.
And because Mary had said she’d take care of it and because John trusted her, he forgot all about the matter.
“It was... red, I think. Yes, red.” Sherlock began to scribble again as she spoke.  “But what does that have to do with...”
When Ivan entered the house, he immediately noticed a pungent, metallic odor.  It seemed to be coming from a door to one side of the kitchen that he’d previously thought led to a storage room.
The men began to retreat in good order, but then the new enemy forces arrived and all semblance of order disintegrated.  Amidst the chaos, Ivan and his men held together as a unit, fighting a fierce defense as they retreated to safety.  Suddenly young Wigginsky cried out as his horse stumbled and fell, its leg broken where it had stepped in a hole.  Almost immediately, one of the enemy bore down upon him, a huge brute of a man swinging an enormous mace.  Ivan charged forward to block the mace’s fall with his sword, but the sword broke.  He took the full impact of the mace upon his shoulder, where it burst the links of his chainmail.  Its spikes drove through his leather shirt, deep into the flesh beneath.
“I posted a message of my own which should attract the killer’s attention.  We’ll need to wait 24 hours for posting and then some additional time before he notices it.”
Ivan shivered, knowing those silver eyes caught the motion.  It wasn’t unpleasant, being observed by this uncanny creature, but it was... intense.
“Anyway, I thought he did and that if I could get him talking about past stuff, like his job, he would calm down. And it worked, pretty much.”
“No, but observing the physical details that betray emotional reactions is very much ‘my area.’ What’s interesting about your statement, however, is that you said something similar the evening we first met. And then you followed it by saying you’d talk John ‘round. Did you welcome the opportunity I represented?”
“That’s one possibility.  It’s also possible his employer wanted to make sure he didn’t talk.  Or that I was the gunman’s real target.  My work has made me some enemies.”
“It’s replaced by the chorioallantoic placenta in humans and other higher orders of mammals,” Sherlock clarified. “The lower orders make do with the choriovitelline placenta.”
“Don’t shrug at me like that. The case is over, so you’re eating.  Thai, or would you rather something else?”
Lestrade complied, wrestling the wooden door into place against the slightly warped frame but shaking his head when John made a motion to help.
John stood up as well and began to clear the table. Sherlock didn’t so much stand up as fling himself out of his chair at John’s laptop, where he began typing.
“This Sherlock must have a cruel tongue, to speak such lies about you and your wife,” Svinarnikov added, addressing Andreyev.
thanking Lestrade for letting go.  “I never heard of this Wilson bloke, and I didn’t know there was a pawnshop ‘round there until the copper said there was.”
“No, he agreed with ‘em! He’d start going on about how scientists don’t really know how bonds work and they don’t know what they’re doing and how people don’t know what goes on in labs.  He’d get more and more riled up.  And then he’d stomp away from the telly and head for his computer, and he’d be working at the computer and muttering to himself.  It seemed like every time it happened, he took longer to calm down.”
John began to smile – and then realized something that wiped the nascent smile off his face. “That evening at the Landmark. You’d just got back from Serbia.”
what I was thinking,” he purred.  And then in a completely different tone, “Come on!”  He took off at a run down the path, the curves of his pale buttocks flashing in the sunlight as the shirt flapped back and forth.  Ivan shook his head, but ran after him.
“Here” was an unpretentious side door towards the rear of the building.  John stood between Sherlock and the street as Sherlock made quick work of the lock.  The staircase that greeted them inside was no harder for John to navigate than that at 221B, but it was no easier either.  By the time he reached the top, Sherlock was already exploring the first floor in the semi-darkness.
“Information.  Nothing indiscreet.  Nothing you’d feel... uncomfortable with.  Just tell me what he’s up to.”
“Muircheartaigh was sending them,” Sherlock growled.  “It took me longer than it should have to deduce that.  I’d stopped looking for him and he was bored, so he used these people to draw me out.  He’d orchestrate events that caused a village or household to set someone on the road.  Once that person was underway, Muircheartaigh would set a binding on them that drew them ever eastward.  He led them to me with rumours and stories planted by his agents, but the binding ensured that sooner or later, whether in my company or alone, they would come to Muircheartaigh.”
“Oh, Dexter! The geeky alpha Janine was dancing with? And Sherlock? Oh, that minx!” Mary started to laugh, then broke off. “Oh god, they don’t know yet, do they?”
John had to chuckle at Sherlock’s appalled face. “Anderson’s got friends, all of whom are far more enthusiastic about spotting you
“Someone to carry and raise your children while the two of you went off and lived your exciting alpha/omega lives.”
“Nom de dieu,” Foucault said again, softly. His eyes were bright, as if with unshed tears.  “Then it is over.”
“The PA and the guard weren’t in the flat, they were in the office below. Both had received blows to the head. The guard was dead, the PA unconscious. I’m here to try and get a statement from her before the hospital releases her. The guard was an ex-con with links to white supremacist groups, so we’re following up on those.”
“Is Stolitsky just your family’s name or do you really come from the capital?  I’ve heard a story that the tsarevich has ridden out on a quest to find a sorcerer!”
He felt no pain and no fear as the flames encircled his hips and groin, stroking, grasping, licking, rubbing, heat without and heat within, ever rising, ever building until he was shaking with it, the heat and the pleasure.  He knew what the flames said now, they said vanyavanyavanyushhhhhhka and Ivan threw back his head, his body clenching all over...
The beach John was lying on was so very comfortable, but the tide was coming in.  He had to get up.  But he couldn’t get up because he’d knocked someone down and was sitting on them.  He could feel them holding him...  Down?
“Sherlock gave me the gold feather to set fires around the keep.  It’s been very useful, but perhaps...”  She bit her lip, obviously not fond of the idea of giving away the gold feather.
“John, I expect you already know why I’m calling, but I’m sorry to confirm the news. The authorities require someone to provide identification and I’m told that this may provide a sense of, ah, closure?  If you wish, I can send a car.”
John felt as if he’d been punched in the gut. He distantly heard the carrier bags with the containers of leftovers hit the floor.
Mary was right, course. John knew that he and Sherlock needed to talk, should have done so before now. John
A pause on the phone. Then: “Someone tried to shoot him in the heart and barely missed. The doctors don’t know if he’ll make it, John.”
He’d gone to his bank before leaving Canada, asking if he could buy some UBR pounds there.  The teller had replied knowingly, “You
Ivan grabbed the ring and, for good measure, the black feather.  He hung the ring around his neck and placed all three feathers – black, gold and blue – in the case with Sherlock’s heart, then closed it.  But... go where?
John entertained a brief fantasy of Sherlock in a world without mobiles. He’d probably recruit London’s pigeons to be his communication network.  There’d be coops on the roof of 221B, and Sherlock would have at least one or two pigeons riding along on the shoulders of his Belstaff at any given time.  The dry cleaning bills would be horrendous.
Sherlock was still talking. “Even if he had managed to escape, he’s already left sufficient fingerprints on a variety of surfaces in this room...”
They only stepped away from each other when they heard the bedroom door open. Mary padded in, her eyes swollen and reddish. John wondered if she’d cried herself to sleep.
“I may be able to help you there,” said Ivan, drawing Marfa Hudovna’s sack from his belt and reaching into it.  He half expected to draw forth more pastries, but instead he found four loaves of fresh rye bread and a dozen ripe, juicy apples.  When he looked up, he discovered that everyone else had gathered around him, their eyes huge in their starved faces.  Andreyev was actually drooling.
“That I don’t.  I tossed it down a sewer grate when I realized the copper was going to nab me.  And I had to leave my overshoes behind a bin, so I need new ones.  Not that I ever wear ‘em, but Aunt Martha will be cheesed if I have to tell her I lost ‘em.”
“Eat the toast and listen. Mary’s right. Normally a beta’s body would be affected by the omega’s pheromone changes for the full five months.”
he knew as his husband, to correct Angelo.  Sherlock, however, appeared to be studying the menu, so John made the attempt.  “I’m not his date, I’m...”
Sherlock, however logical, was about as dispassionate and cold-hearted as a tango. True, his passions often ran in directions that some other people considered freakish. But John couldn’t imagine Mycroft jumping off a building to save three other people or even three thousand.
“Seven, maybe? Maybe later.  And then we walked for a while.  Uncle Don was walking, I was just sort of going with him.”
“No, there isn’t,” said Caustlin shortly. “Look, Mr Holmes, if you’re trying to imply something about my son, you can stop right there.  Tyler
John nodded. “Some of the betties agreed, some didn’t. Everyone was arguing, the alfs were claiming that
Muircheartaigh stepped out from behind the hangings.  Gone were his crown, his sceptre, his ermine stole.  He wore only his black robes.  The hem was noticeably singed.  “Did you think that little girl would be able to distract me for long?”
“Good night, Sherlock.”  No response from Sherlock, who appeared to be trying to read three books at once.  John left him to it.
“Well, it’s worse for a woman. David was unintimidated, appreciative, even supportive.  It made for... a nice change.”
know is that you not only kept information from me, you also lied. Our entire relationship is built on lies. You were never going to tell me the truth, not even when Sherlock and I could have helped you with Magnussen.”
“Devil’s foot root,” said John, remembering his medical Latin.  “So... the victims follow the killer into a room, the killer seals the room shut and lights up a piece of root and the victims just sit there?  Why do they follow the killer in the first place?”
“Yes, Sherlock, that point was made. Anyway, the betas asserted that alphas and omegas were no better than amarsupial males. The alfs and megs said the betties were all a bunch of betaists, the betties wanted to know what was wrong with that and then...”
Sherlock looked amused. “I know that you and Mycroft made that story up to ‘protect’ me from the fact that you think she’s dead.”
“Sherlock, thank you.  This was very, ah, thoughtful of you.”  To John’s ears his own voice sounded awkward and stilted.
“That the entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss’ office. I imagine she would have wanted to stop seeing me at that point and that she would have told Dexter as well.” Sherlock shrugged. “As it turned out, I didn’t need to tell her anything. Someone knocked her unconscious first.”
“Yeah, I know. No one seems to know why.  Also, he didn’t make the call himself.  The 999 recording sounds like a much younger fellow, fairly frantic.  The operator was able to keep him on the line for a while, but he hung up just before the ambulance got here.  You can hear the siren approaching and then the recording cuts off.”
“Not quite yet.” John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s tangled curls and kissed the top of his head.  “Have you deleted the concept of refractory periods?”
Angelo led them to a table by the window.  He laid two menus on the table and announced, “On the house, Sherlock for you
Things were still going well a month later when John scrubbed in on a coronary artery bypass graft at St Bart’s. It was a fairly common procedure among his patients, so he wanted to become more familiar with how it was done. The lead surgeon was pleased to invite him once he learned that John had been a trauma surgeon.
“Thank you, Dr Hooper,” Lestrade replied gravely, and he herded them all in the proper direction. Molly muttered something about coffee and vanished.
not quite as many betas. The betas pointed out that they were going to be expected to do all the carrying...”
“Thank you for that, but there’s a wide sea between me and my homeland – and judging by your speech, between you and yours as well.  Gospozha Usacheva won’t be pleased to learn that we’ve left the price of passage by ship behind us just because you were in a hurry.”
Once Mr Holmes returned from the airport, the rest of the day passed uneventfully. After lunch, Mrs Holmes suggested with extreme firmness that John and Mr Holmes should go out for a walk.
Moving cautiously, Ivan used his walking stick to lever himself to his feet and drew his sword, only to see the bird-creature leave its perch and swoop down to the ground.  Once there, it began a strange dance, alternately pirouetting and spreading, then folding its vast wings.  Ivan stood his ground, and the bird-creature – half a head taller than Ivan himself – came to a halt only a sword’s length away.  Then, just as the first rays of the sun came over the horizon, it spoke.
Marfa Hudovna beamed.  “In that case, dear, I think I may be able to help you.  But you should get some sleep now, because you’ll need to be up tomorrow before dawn and I don’t know when you’ll next get a chance to rest after that.”
“These individuals – the betas – carry the infants, while the fertile alpha/omega individuals are free to breed again immediately. The result allows for more intelligent children, born at a higher rate.”
tomorrow. Still, that gives us a day to make more permanent arrangements. Mary, you can take the room upstairs for now. The bed should already be made up. You may find the sheets a bit musty, however.”
Ivan watched with curiosity as Sherlock positioned himself facing the wall to one side of the spot Ivan had indicated.  He spread his wings slightly and leapt up from the floor.  As he grabbed hold of one of the brackets supporting the hangings, he also dug his clawed feet into the hangings to brace himself.  Then he manoeuvred his body until he could lean over and reach
“Good,” John replied, about to open the refrigerator door.  Then he paused.  “You didn’t, ah, put it in the bin, did you?”
“With at least one important difference: the term ‘soulmates’ is commonly taken to imply a unique match. The traits theory does not.  The woman you met this evening would never have caused your band to change colour simply because she was neither dangerous nor particularly intelligent.”
John knew that he would have owed her an update on Sherlock even if she hadn’t been willing to trade a meal for it. He vaguely remembered eating something in the hospital at some point and wasn’t at all hungry until he sat down. Then he was ravenous. In between bites and spoonfuls, he filled Mrs Hudson in on the latest.
Sherlock looked briefly startled, almost as if...  Had he not expected John to see this through?  Then the surprise was gone.  “Maybe two minutes, 45 seconds.”  And he was gone too, strolling off towards the pub, his gloved hands tucked into his pockets.
Miranda gasped. “Tyler, what were you thinking?  Surely by that point you must have realized that this wasn’t a good idea.”
John wanted nothing more than the collapse next to his lover, but someone should go get wet washcloths and it obviously wasn’t going to be Sherlock. John staggered into action.
Still Ivan would have argued, except that the tower began to emit a low rumble.  This was it, he knew, and he retreated back past the crumbling courtyard walls and the fallen gate to the shelter of the trees.  His captors – both of them – followed.
“Yes, sir!” Billy replied with a grin.  “Found it straight off, and a good thing I got there before the copper did.  Where it was lying, he would’ve seen it for sure.”
“That’s the John Watson I remember!”  Mike grinned.  “Nothing keeps you down!  But you haven’t been assigned anywhere particular in London yet?”
He fell asleep before it occurred to him that it was he who was sleeping in Sherlock’s bed, by Sherlock’s invitation.
“I’m beginning to see the advantages of the sofa,” admitted Sherlock after he’d caught both his balance and John.
Lestrade, who hadn’t missed anything, caught John’s eye and winked even as he gave instructions to the rest of his team.
“There were none.  The lord said that I must have done it and sentenced me to death.  But when I protested, he said he would be merciful.  His mercy was to grant me a year and a day to prove my innocence by finding the true murderer.”
The party continued northwards, making what speed they could but hampered by the litter and by the need to make a full camp every night for the tsarevich’s sake.  Each night the men erected their captain’s tent and made sure his bedroll had enough padding.  They gathered extra firewood that he might be kept warm and prepared gruels and soups over their campfires that he might eat even though hard bread and dried meat were beyond his strength.  They watched over him when nightmares made him cry out in his sleep.
As Anderson looked at Donovan in shock, Sherlock sniffed loudly.  “Ooh, and I think it just vaporised.  May I go in?”
“No money.  I expect they think I might lend them some once we’re kin.  Ha!  Well, I might.  They’ve got connections, all these old noble families do.  If their connections pay off for me, I might be willing to lend them a bit.  With interest, of course!  Too bad they didn’t have a daughter available, but I got you on as first spouse.  Their boy’s second – your blushing bride.  Ha!  Don’t you glare at me like that, boy.  It’s a good marriage I’ve made for you.”
, reaching up through a gap between the hangings...  Oh!”  Set in the stone wall at about the height of a man’s head was a small metal door, also with a lock.  “Can you get this one too?”
But by the time it was ready, Mycroft had left. Sherlock absently accepted a cup of tea, smiling slightly. “My brother has a curious blind spot concerning you, John.”
But she only laughed and bade him look at the tree’s trunk.  When Ivan did so, he was amazed to find it marked with carvings that looked very much like the ones on the apple wood walking stick Uilleam an t-Moireach had given him.
“No, no!  One of the other clerks was found dead in the room where we kept accounts.  It was a curious death, for the only door was barred from the inside.  The lord’s guards had to break it down.”
“Yeah. The thing is – we were so young, Clara and I.  When I met Clara, the one thing I wanted was someone who’d accept me as I was and not be on my case about drinking all the time.”
John’s sarcasm was lost on Sherlock.  “Neither would Billy.  He shows some promise.  By the way, I have to question your previous statement that your psychosomatic limp reappears when you’re under stress.  Unless you find being chased by police officers relaxing?”
She blushed prettily. “I just wanted to say that, well, I don’t mean to be nosy, but...  You and your partner...”
Alas, neither item was to be found, and once the forensics team arrived, Sherlock rapidly became irritated and claimed not to be able to think. “This is a waste of time.  John and I are going to St Bart’s to look at the body.”
stomach. They were going to come like this, like teenagers making out on the sofa, but neither of them were teenagers and Sherlock deserved better. John summoned all his strength and pushed Sherlock away.
Right, but that hadn’t stopped the two pieces of toasted cheese that John had placed next to Sherlock last evening from vanishing.  There was, of course, a chance that they’d ended up under the sofa.  John’d had a girlfriend for awhile whose cat had disposed of unwanted food that way.  He’d check under the sofa later, but in the meantime he’d make extra toast.
The next day started bright and early when John woke to sound of loud footsteps on the stairs.  He barely paused to pull on his jeans before heading out into the sitting room, arriving just as Lestrade entered hauling Billy Wiggins by one shoulder.  Through the open door, John could hear both the indignant voices of Billy’s mother and grandaunt and the irreverent comments of his younger siblings.
The thing is, Dexter was right. Sherlock was brilliant, Sherlock was gorgeous. He could be charming.
wanted supper, at any rate.  He dug around in the freezer compartment and extracted a chicken pie.  Then he thought of pigeons.  He put the pie back and went looking for the take-out menus instead.
“Purchases made online are too easy to track. You or I would have been far too obvious buying omega maternity clothes. Molly, as a female beta, was far less so. Which presumably
Sex was going to be a problem sooner or later.  John had the comfort of his own left hand, of course, but he knew from experience that this wouldn’t be enough for the long term.  He’d seen posts on BritChat, and some of them had seemed... possible.  And there must still be places in London where people gathered to see whom they might meet.  It couldn’t be all
He was sleeping on the porch and the wind in the trees whispered, “Vanyavanyavanyushhhhhhka,” but he wasn’t sleeping after all – he was flying.  Flying high over the forest, very fast, so that the wind brought tears to his eyes but he wasn’t afraid because the flames wrapped around him held him safe, would never let him fall.  They flew on and on, towards the light of the sun, but the sun suddenly turned dark and they flew into the centre of the darkness.
1)	In life as we know it, most male marsupials don’t have pouches and the ones that do use them to store their genitalia, not their young.  However, for purposes of this story I needed beta males to have pouches.  I regret nothing.
Sherlock sniffed audibly and turned back to his microscope. Molly had delivered a small cooler the evening before. John had decided not to ask about the contents, but he hoped they would keep Sherlock entertained for a while. Was the entire afternoon too much to hope for?
John had pleaded with his uncle to do the same, but Andrew Watson had a hard head, little patience and no respect for his late brother’s wishes.  He’d paid off the creditors out of his own funds, but his price for doing so was to yank John out of medical school (“waste of money!”) and assign him to a clerk’s desk in one of the company warehouses.
“What did you do?” demanded Ivan as he picked up his sack and looking glass, “Apart from spoiling my attack, that is.”
“You deserved to know the truth in any case,” Sherlock replied softly. For a bizarre moment, John though he meant the truth that John had just uttered. Then he realized.
, who’d gone out of his way to get Tyler a break.  Sherlock’s possible reasons for doing so were another thing John found himself unable to put out of his mind.
The passengers were met by a fleet of buses with signs for various destinations, a portly middle-aged man with a clipboard, several smiling young assistants, a baggage crew and, off to one side, six armed... security guards?  Except that they looked more to John’s eye like soldiers.
Sherlook was scribbling a few more characters of what was beginning to look like a chemical equation. John glanced at Tyler.  The youth was watching the detective’s every move.  John looked back at Sherlock’s writing, trying to place the characters, the equation, written in red marker on a whiteboard...  Oh.  He looked at Lestrade and found Lestrade looking back at him.  The inspector shifted his gaze towards the whiteboard, then back to John.  He raised a questioning brow.  John nodded.
“It’s already been proven that he’ll lie to me as easily as to you.” John tried to keep his voice light but knew he failed.
With a sigh, the... concierge?  The concierge pulled a device out of her pocket.  It looked like a blockier, clumsier version of the “cellular” phones that had been everywhere in Canada.  Fourteen years ago, they’d been unknown in Britain.  Only those who could afford it had even had landlines.
John held up a finger. “All I can tell you is that it’s for a case... No, not a police case... That’s right, a private client... No, nothing illegal... If it starts heading in that direction I’ll certainly call you... Absolutely. I understand... Thursday next? Sure thing. I haven’t been out for a pint in ages.”
His armchair. The armchair that Sherlock had removed because he claimed it blocked his view of the kitchen. But here it was, back in its place – and only one person was likely to have put it there. John patted the arms thoughtfully and then realized that Lestrade was talking to him.
He got a rhythm going, both hands stroking and squeezing, one on Sherlock’s cock, the other alternating between the two teats. Sherlock’s whole body danced with John, the undulating arch of his back driving his belly and groin forward into John’s hands in perfect synchrony. And then, when Sherlock’s breath came in damp ragged pants against John’s neck, when he arched too far, when he lost the beat, when the rhythm they’d share broke and hung suspended in mid-air – then John thumbed the slit at the head of Sherlock’s cock as he ran his fingernails over Sherlock’s swollen teats.
The first day of March was dreary and damp. Everyone had collected in the living room, which wasn’t really large enough. Mary had settled on the sofa with a book but kept getting up to pace, saying that her back hurt. This meant that Sherlock couldn’t pace without bumping into Mary. Instead he’d taken up his violin for an apparently infinite series of distinctly unmelodic exercises.
he had the bright idea of wiggling the pinned arm free enough to make a grab for John’s balls. John lost his grip but landed a good kick on Sherlock’s shins. Sherlock tried the throw that had worked so well on George Jones. John sidestepped his hold and was going in for a head butt when the incipient brawl was interrupted by a blood-curdling scream from the bed.
“Greg, even six days after the event, lacerations such as those we saw on Donald McKinsey’s hands would leave some traces. Tyler doesn’t have any, and I’m prepared to state that in court as a doctor.”
“Poor Andreyev was far from the worst, dear.  Some of them ran away screaming the first time they saw Sherlock.”
“It is, however, a ring recognized as symbolizing power, which is all that I need.”  Sherlock attached the ring with a pair of wires to a small, glittering device, then attached another wire to the black feather he still carried.
Sherlock stood still as well, studying Ivan.  He took a step forward... a second... a third.  Then he placed his hands on Ivan’s shoulders – copying Ivan’s actions of the previous evening, Ivan realized – bent his head down and kissed Ivan on the lips, chastely and with surprising awkwardness, as clumsy as a youth...
with him.  Bad things happen to bad puppies.”  With that Muircheartaigh ducked behind the throne through a gap in the hangings and vanished.
“Food’s one of our biggest problems,” Sara Dmitrievna explained, after Svinarnikov had shown Ivan to a stream where he could wash the ashes and dust off his face.  “Tyuleneva and Svinarnikov have tried hunting, but there’s no game.  And most of plants here are different from the ones we’re familiar with, so we don’t know what’s safe to eat.  With everyone already weakened, I don’t want to risk even vomiting or diarrhea, let alone more serious effects.”
“If they didn’t, they would have been able to access BritChat at the lending library next to the shop.  I hypothesized...”
But Mary was shaking her head. “Oh, John, I’m sorry. It’s so clear to me, I thought you knew as well.”
The adjustments to their lives proceeded with amazing smoothness. Mary was installed in the downstairs bedroom –
“The tsar gave me this office as a favour to my father,” explained Ivan, his eyes modestly downcast, “and I am most grateful for it.”
“You told John I was interested in him only as a friend, but you weren’t at all surprised when you returned and discovered we’d become more. In fact, you gambled on the chance that I’d be willing to carry John’s child despite the risks inherent for you in entering the UK.”
After his shower, Sherlock emerged from the bedroom in pyjamas and a dressing gown.  He made it halfway through a mug of tea before he ran out of steam and John caught him yawning.
“Yeah, that would be more useful if I had enough officers to comb the streets of London checking everyone’s left hands. Anything else?  What do you make of this?”
“Hindsight’s the plague of many a captain and commander,” said Ivan gently.  “On the field of battle, you make the best decisions you can.  If later on they turn out to have been mistaken, you try to learn from your mistakes.  It’s all you can do.”
“Could the tsar find no better messenger than a lame man?” a blond-bearded guard asked suspiciously.
Considering the events that had occurred after John and Sherlock’s second date, John thought it might be safest if their third date was at home. Within this in mind, he carefully selected a film and ordered massive amounts of takeout from the Chinese restaurant where he and Sherlock had eaten the night he shot the cabbie. He figured that a movie would be just the thing to promote cuddling on the sofa, necking on the sofa and any other activities on the sofa that Sherlock might be up for.
Silence descended on the kitchen. Finally John broke it. “I’m putting the kettle on. Who wants tea?”
“I see.”  He glanced over at Sherlock’s bowed head.  “The tests – the field of rye, the well, the pile of wood – I take it that these were your idea then?”  Out of the corner of his eye, Ivan saw Sherlock look up suddenly, an indignant expression on his face.
Ivan took a deep breath and got a grip on his temper.  “Fine, Hashen’ka.  I never wanted the throne, but if that’s the way it is,
published and would have been available on-line at least briefly, since the newspaper has a digital edition.”
She shrugged, studying the bicycle, the two boxes, the as-yet unzipped duffle with a bit of uniform still hanging out. “What’s all this, then?”
was David! John clasped his hand firmly and made deliberate, prolonged alpha-to-alpha eye contact. David dropped his eyes and scurried off as soon as John released him. So much for David.
Once the tsarevna became qualified to succeed to the throne, the tsarevich applied to his father for permission to join the imperial forces.  Moreover, he begged to be allowed to join not as a high officer but as a mere captain, that he might prove himself to the troops and win their loyalty on his own merit.  The tsar indulgently gave his permission, and the tsarevich left the same day to join the forces at war in the mountains along the southern border.
“Going after Sherlock?” Mary jibed. “I’d advise starting with Molly’s bedroom. Or better yet – just wait for Bill Wiggins to find you. Of course, that won’t happen unless Sherlock actually
When they resumed, it was Eurus who took John’s theme, Sherlock who played the new one.  The soaring runs were as exhilarating as a good case, an eight, a nine, even a rare ten.  In Eurus’ hands, John’s theme framed these moments of brilliance, set them off, but also brought them back down more gently, easing the stumbles.  When the new theme sank into the depths, John’s theme softened its despair, led it back upwards.
6)	In my particular iteration of alpha/beta/omega, all omegas are female and all alphas are male.  If this doesn’t float your boat, there’s plenty of omega!John and omega!Sherlock out there.  My own favourite female alpha is Irene in fresne’s
“Sherlock!” cried Ivan, but the speed of the vibrations increased, faster and faster until Sherlock was shimmering, blurring before his eyes.
Lestrade was not only running out of constables, he was also frustrated by the lack of leads. Sherlock had given a statement describing his shooter: dressed entirely in black, including a black face mask. Below average height for a British male, average build, blue eyes, fair skin around the eyes.
The concierge ignored him.  “No call for him to be taking up space here when there’s others who need it more.  Here.”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hands. They sat looking into each other’s eyes a moment, then let go, looked away and resumed eating.
Slick, warm, tight and Sherlock was urging him to move, John was moving, once he started he couldn’t stop, so very good and yet... And yet... And then Sherlock placed one of his own large hands over the outside of his pouch, making a tunnel for John’s cock and that was
And then he did hear something.  A man’s voice.  His father’s... no, wait, Misha Kamen’brodsky?  Ivan could almost make out the words, not quite, but it was definitely Misha – and then it was Uilleam an t-Moireach, speaking in his own tongue, which was why Ivan could not understand, that made sense, right?
Six hours later, the sun had risen and Mary was 48 mm dilated. She’d walked at least a mile by her own reckoning, although Sherlock claimed it was only 5,137 feet. She’d also had a warm bath, and they’d all had several cups of tea. John had put an end to Sherlock’s declarations of boredom by suggesting he play his violin. Mary had promptly vetoed lullabies. “I don’t want it to go to sleep. It can sleep later!”
” – her hand gesture took in the entire room – “before the police would pay any notice.  Tens of thousands of pounds of equipment destroyed, including a computer with irreplaceable research data...”
After a couple of months, the men began slipping back into capital by ones and twos, without any fuss at all.
“I hear you, mate. But at least between the two of us we have a better chance of catching him out, right? Will you come?”
I’ll make sure Sherlock thanks you for it.” The rest, John thought to himself, was between him and Sherlock.
“After which you decided to return to the UBR.  What do you expect to find here, Dr Watson?  You’re no traumatized soldier freshly returned from the battlefield.  You’ve spent the past eight years studying medicine, practicing medicine, playing at soldier on the weekends...”
drop by the morgue, so she gave them to me under the assumption that I already knew you’d commissioned her to go clothing shopping for Mary.”
knows enough about human emotions that they might be able to explain them to her.  Which leaves you out, Mycroft.  She wants to talk to Sherlock.”
Extra milk for Mary. A package of jammy dodgers. Or there were Christmas biscuits in with... Oh, hell, the leftovers.
“We were only gonna get paid if we delivered the boffin bird. They read about her in some foreign newspaper, thought she’d make a good hostage.  But we’re not gonna be making that delivery now, so we’re not getting paid.  We’d might as well talk,” Ives explained.
John took pity on him.  “Look, it’s a big bed.  There’s plenty of room for both of us.  I’ve certainly shared tighter quarters before.”
Lord Holmes beamed.  “Sherlock, this is John Watson.  John, my son, soon to be your husband: Sherlock Holmes.”
looked amazing. His height neatly disguised the slight puffiness of his belly. Once he started carrying the child and especially as the child grew, his swollen pouch would become more noticeable. For now, John doubted that anyone who wasn’t already in the know could tell the difference.
“The initial chaos eventually passed, leaving behind rubble.  I was seventeen, with one year of university, little practical knowledge of the world and the wrong sort of accent.  I did what I needed to do to survive – and what I needed to do to deal with what I needed to do to survive.”
Lestrade shrugged. “The paramedics were focussed on saving the man’s life, not preserving evidence.”
“The capital of Bulgaria. The tattoo and the amputation indicate that the victim was a member of the Cherni Kucheta. It’s an Eastern European gang that’s been making recent inroads into Western Europe. The NPS in Sofia has the most data.”
Sherlock ducked under the yellow tape without hesitation and led the way down the alley alongside the shop, John following.  “Wilson lived above his shop.  He wouldn’t have wanted to go through the shop every time he went in or out, so there must be...  Ah, here we are.”
Sherlock stopped them well short of the wooden fence. “There!  Don’t trample them.”  Caught in the mud next to the fence were two deep footprints, created by someone landing hard after jumping.
Sherlock smiled slowly. “I’ve been told that it’s where two people who like each other go out and have fun.”
Life went on with no incidents other than the usual. Thus, when Mrs Hudson announced a visitor one evening, John was expecting a client. He was surprised and, for reasons he could not quite fathom, uneasy when the visitor proved to be Dexter, the alpha he’d last seen in 221B with Janine.
Shortly past noon on the third day, Ivan came to a river, not too wide but deep, fast and cold, running southwards.  The road crossed it on a bridge made of stone, beautifully engineered and adorned with carved sculptures and inscriptions.  Time, however, had blurred the carvings, rendering them unrecognizable.  The few that Ivan could make out looked strange and foreign to him.  It was not his own people who had built this bridge.
Now that John was a widower, the idea of anyone devoting the remainder of their lives solely to their work seemed a good deal less plausible. He didn’t see himself doing that, not for long anyway.  And Sherlock was still, well,
John was cut off by a knock at the door, which Sherlock seemed unusually prompt about answering. The alpha who entered – nice jacket, classy jeans, brown hair, glasses – looked vaguely familiar.
Sherlock had a bought John a black market gun and a forged certificate.  Oh, hell, of course he had.  He’d probably gotten a special price because he’d done the dealer a
“I don’t know, dear.  I don’t want to know.  Boris was executed.  His family threw me out, but I’d been expecting that.  So had Sherlock, for he came and got me.  He said he was living in an abandoned hunting lodge in a forest and asked me to come keep house for him.  When I got here, it turned out that he’d got his laboratory nicely set up, and beyond that hadn’t done one thing to repair or even clean the house at all!  I still remember how proud he was as he showed it to me and asked me what I thought of it.”  She was smiling now.
“I considered sitting on the bed itself, but the risk of startling an ex-soldier awake while I was within arms’ length seemed like a bad idea.”
Ivan Watovich stood to one side of the tsar’s throne, watching as the last batch of nobles came forward one by one to swear their oaths, remembering all too well why he’d tried to escape the tedium of court life for the battlefield.  Still, he did his best to look brave and determined.  Harrieta Watovna stood to the other side, doing her best to look reasonably sober.  They avoided eye contact.  Past incidents had proven that accidentally making eye contact caused them both to break down in giggles.
John went out to the pub and managed not to let slip to Lestrade that Sherlock and Mary were spending the evening running quality assurance tests on illegal beta hormones. He did, however, think he ought to warn Lestrade that Sherlock had introduced himself to the betologist by telling her he’d got her name from “DI Lestrade.” This had immediately caused her to assume that the case Sherlock was working on was a Yard case. Sherlock had not corrected her assumptions.
“Why were you at St Bart’s? Oh, obvious – scrubbed in on a procedure, hmmm, something fairly routine and boring.”
Finally she handed him an earthenware jug and a cloth bundle.  If he tucked the bundle into the crook of his elbow, he could hold the jug in one hand and use the other for his walking stick.
Gratefully, John moved to assist her with bringing in mugs, spoons, milk, sugar and finally the tea pot itself. When Mrs Hudson sat down to pour, John sat as well.  He’d lived in this flat once.  He’d visited, later on.  Mary had encouraged his friendship with Sherlock.  John had come by from time to time and had never before hesitated to help himself to a seat.  Never before tonight.
Listening now to a passionate, impeccable violinist partnered with a symphony orchestra was an enlightening experience. And that was true even though John knew he was missing all the finer points. Which was fine, he could ask Sherlock about them later. Sherlock would enjoy explaining.
Ivan was saved from having to attempt a reply when Marfa Hudovna appeared in the barn’s doorway.  “Come and have some supper, boys.  There’s borscht.”
While the company waited for the ship to be provisioned, Ivan spent the remainder of Harrieta’s jewels on warm clothes for the sea voyage.  The very last gold piece went for a trip to the bath house, a welcome experience for all of them after weeks on the road, washing up as best they could in cold streams.
“Mycroft is overdramatizing in an attempt to justify his meddling. And my meeting concerns a case of simple blackmail. There’s nothing more disgustingly tawdry. Now unless you plan on joining me in the bath?”
“Ride always to the east and the north, but do not cross the mountains that will rise on your left.  You’ll come to an ancient bridge that crosses a river running down from the mountains, at the western border of a great forest.  Once you cross the bridge, do not stop for any reason until you’ve come to Marfa Hudovna’s house.”
American – approximately the same time she returned to Britain.  It’s not proven but highly likely that the spouse remained in the States.  Aren’t you done eating yet?”
John frowned. “Who made the call?  Myocardial infarctions are rarely instantaneous.  If he was able to call himself in and if the paramedics got here within the average response time, he should still have been alive.”
“Yes, at his suggestion,” snapped John. “Because even Sherlock could see that I couldn’t” – couldn’t handle, couldn’t deal with – “couldn’t be bothered to deal with it.”
The constables arrested them all on the spot. Fortunately, Minnie proved extremely distracting both as to scent and sound. She was well and truly going into heat by now, her alpha was lying on the floor unconscious or dead
Ivan, his anger already cooling, refrained from saying an apology wasn’t necessary.  To do so would diminish the authority Sara Dmitrievna had obviously gained.
John was considering the possibility that Sherlock might have pled Tyler’s case with Foucault for the sole purpose of giving John another chance with Tyler’s mother when the lift doors opened. He discarded the idea as being so implausible it bordered on the impossible and stuck the paper in the pocket of his jeans.
As crime scenes went, this one was noticeable for the absence of a corpse and the abundance of graffiti, far more than one would expect to find in a university research laboratory. There was also a good deal of smashed glassware and electronic equipment lying about.  Lestrade stood talking with two people in white lab coats, one a greying dark-haired man who looked to be in his sixties and the other a fortyish woman with blonde hair pulled back in a messy ponytail.
“Not from me, Mary. Never hide things like that from me, okay? I love you, but we need to be open with each other. And whomever we chose, we’d need to be open with them as well, and Sherlock...”
“Magnussen would never have shared information with the police. He would have added it to what he already had on file for Mary and used it to control her, you and by extension, me. I would still have been shot. Mary would still be an assassin. And all three of us would be at Magnussen’s non-existent mercy.”
John thought about this as he put the kettle on and set out two mugs for tea.  Sherlock came clumping up the stairs and headed immediately for the laptop.  He didn’t react when John set a mug of tea (with extra sugar) down next to him.  John drank his own tea, read for awhile and then turned in for the night.
“Hold on there! Sherlock, you can’t leave now!” They’d forgotten Mary, who was now glaring at them with her hands on her hips. “I’m too close! This baby could be born any time now.”
Harrieta darted out of an alley, almost directly in front of him.  “Are you happy, Vanya?  Be honest!”  She dashed across the street and vanished down another alley, the nursemaids close on her heels.
She studied him a moment, then sighed. “You’re telling the truth. You’ve always been so honest, John.”
John climbed onto the foot of the bed and then crawled up, his hands and knees bracketing Sherlock. “Hi,” he grinned, looking down.
Sherlock, left to his own devices, would simply bin the sheets. “Sherlock, walk with Mary in case she needs support. I’ll take care of the sheets.” And get rid of the strap while he was at it.
When the last stand of rye was finally cut and bundled and the bundles stowed away in the hay barn to await threshing, Misha declared, “There’s a job well-done!  Come up to my house and drink kvass with me, Vanya Stolitsky.”  So they sat on the porch of the house and drank kvass, and Ivan thought he’d never had a drink so delicious.
Ivan’s mind promptly recalled the camp followers he’d known as a soldier.  “Er, what sort of favours?” he ventured.
“You may find this useful, then.” And Sherlock handed John a bit of paper with a phone number scribbled on it, in Sherlock’s own spiky writing.
“Please, I learned both of those skills as a child. I used to practice the former on Mycroft and the latter on Mycroft’s possessions.  As for your obvious assumption, you’ve met Shezza.  Would you pay him to perform fellatio on you?”
“You hold your left shoulder stiffly and you have a bit of a tremour in your left hand, but you correct for both of those more automatically than you do for your leg.  Also, your cane doesn’t have four years of wear on it.”
It seemed to him that as he walked, he saw more people with black wristbands than he used to. Or perhaps he just noticed them more.  Before he’d married, his eyes had been drawn to the silver wristbands of the unbonded and sometimes to the gold wristbands of (presumably) happy couples.  Now he saw black-banders everywhere and found himself wondering about the gold-banders he noticed.  How many were like Harry, Greg, Campbell-Williams?
Sherlock steepled his fingers in front of himself, the tips just below his chin. “When I was... away, I often feared that I would not survive. The emotion wasn’t useful, it didn’t affect my actions or goals, but... it was there.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Of course!  Does this look like the sort of place I would choose for a funeral pyre?  Now take the case and your father’s ring and
“They protect themselves by placing their hearts in other vessels.  As long as their hearts beat, they can not be killed.  Conversely, one can destroy the sorcerer by destroying his heart.  Muircheartaigh’s most closely guarded treasure can be nothing else.”
. Magnussen was like a shark – it’s the only way I can describe him. Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium? Ever stood up close to the glass? Those floating flat faces, those dead eyes ... That’s what he was. I’ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them could turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen. I would have done

the infant’s for two to three times as long as in the equivalent species of a more typical mammal. The only amarsupial species that reach any notable size are the sea mammals – cetaceans and pinnipeds – because their weight is partially support by water.”
But the student who burst into the room wasn’t carrying a telegram.  “Watson!  Two blokes here to see you!”
“The oddest thing happened today at the clinic,” Mary mentioned one evening over spag bol. “A fellow I didn’t recognize dropped off a handwritten note from David.”
will leave the UK after the child is born and never return. Mycroft’s granting you sanctuary in this flat for my sake.
“The sorcerer.  He captures them and bespells them to dance until they die.  Look at the castle itself.”
“Huh, I already knew that,” said John. “I’ve never really thought much about it in evolutionary terms, at least not since university.”
“Someone’s been planning,” John commented. He took a mouthful, swirled it around few times, then realized he had no place to spit it out.  He swallowed instead – and then started to cough when it occurred to him that the issue of spitting vs swallowing might well arise again in the not-so-distant future.
“You attached emotional importance to my childhood interest in piracy, and not because you had a comparable interest.”
The lady in question shrieked and vanished down the hallway, returning a moment later with a large sheet.  “You wrap yourself in this, Sherlock Holmes.  I’ll go into Svyatoy Varfolomeyevsk tomorrow and have some clothes made for you, but in the meantime you can’t go running around naked.”
“I didn’t know what to do or where to go, but a man in a tavern said I should take the tale of the unsolved crime to Sherlock Holmes, who lived far to the east.  So, I headed east.  It was a long journey, but after much hardship, I came to the forest where Sherlock was said to live.”
to be my lover.  I wasn’t interested.  He attributed my lack of interest to the absence of my heart – in which he was wrong – and proposed that we should retrieve it.  I accepted his help because I was young and foolish enough to believe that the two of us together could defeat Muircheartaigh.”
It took a moment for David’s meaning to sink in, and when it did...  “I’m not here about the bloody business!”  John barely restrained himself from snarling.
After he’d seen to Bezimyan, Ivan studied the pile of logs sitting at one side of the yard.  It was a good-size pile, but the logs were too large for Marfa Hudovna’s woodstove.  He found an axe in the barn, already sharpened, and set to work trimming and splitting the logs into manageable pieces.  Between his leg and his shoulder, it was awkward, difficult work, but he kept at it doggedly, taking breaks to pile the wood against the house so that it would be convenient for Marfa Hudovna.
He continued on until he was past the chair, standing a few paces away from the man, who smiled pleasantly.  “Some things are best discussed face to face – and not in public places.  The leg must be hurting you.”
Ivan watched, mystified, as she drew from her sleeve – two feathers.  One was gold and somewhat sooty.  The other was crimson and matted with dried blood.
“So you plan on interviewing the entire population of London, beginning with male population, for someone who owns a pair of light-coloured leather shoes and has a taller colleague or acquaintance of some sort.”  Sherlock sipped his tea, then added, “Actually,
But Ivan shook his head.  “I swore a solemn oath to the tsar that I would deliver it to none but the lord Mur-kheyar-tikh.  If you will not let me pass, I must return to the tsar and report to him that the lord Mur-kheyar-tikh did not receive the message because his servants failed to recognize the tsar’s signet ring.”
Lestrade swore, fished out his mobile and put a call in for a forensics team. Sherlock was already back-tracking his way along the alley, following the alleged thief’s escape route. “He jumped, landed, he was running, cut around the first corner – oh!  Lestrade!”
John jumped backwards as Sherlock shut the door. He glanced at the bedroom door that Sherlock had been so adamant about keeping closed. Tempting, that, but a bit not good. John had just started to turn away – only to jump again when the bedroom door opened, revealing...
“I’ll have breakfast ready when you get back, dear.”  She looked him up and down, then nodded.  “Luck be with you.”
Sherlock began to gather up his books and papers, but looked up again as Ivan took a step forward.  He took yet another step, and still Sherlock did not move either forward – or back.  A third step and Ivan could place his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders.  “Sherlock, I am not Victor.  I will not woo importunately, and we need never discuss this again.  If you wish me to carry your heart, I’ll do that.  If I might live with you and Marfa Hudovna as your friend, I would like that.  If you wish me to leave...  I’ll do that too.  But before you make any final decisions, I ask you to consider this.”
There was, however, a means of escape from his uncle’s wishes, a means of escape that was available to any physically fit, mentally sound lad who had at least 18 years.
Sherlock drew himself up and looked belligerent, although the effect was somewhat spoiled by the fact that he kept stroking the outside of his pouch. “Cetaceans are intelligent,” he argued.
Wentworth appeared on the pavement supporting Campbell-Williams, who seemed to be on the verge of passing out. When a black cab pulled up to the curb, he more or less dragged her towards it.  The drunken, elderly man pried himself off the wall he was leaning on.
John slammed down the paper, but neither Sherlock nor Dexter was looking at him. Both men were on their feet. They stared at each other as tea dripped from the overturned mug onto the floor.
The bullets sang as they sped through the air and then another voice joined in.  John couldn’t make out the words but the tune was sweet.  Lulling.  Nice, like the scent of Sherlock’s bed.
“We’re not here to make assumptions or judgements about your granduncle, Tyler,” said Lestrade calmly. “We just want to find out what happened.  Did you and your granduncle do anything besides watch telly?”
They’d sat in Angelo’s, once, with Sherlock looking out the window. John, trying to get to know his new flatmate, had asked awkward questions about girlfriends and boyfriends.  He’d persisted until Sherlock had pulled his right sleeve up slightly to display the black band around his wrist and pronounced himself married to his work.
“Better to be honest, Vanya,” said Harrieta, who’d come up behind him somehow.  She grinned over her shoulder as she walked away into the woods.  Ivan started to follow, but then the man in the meadow called out, “What do you want?” and he was Misha and the blade was a scythe.  Ivan remembered that he was supposed to be bundling the rye and went over to help, but Misha was always farther away.  Then he vanished altogether and the edge of the meadow was on fire, a ring of fire with Ivan in the middle, the flames leaping and dancing ever closer.
Ivan ducked and reached behind him to grab his sword, spinning on his heels as he rose again and sprang up the steps.  Behind him he heard the sweep of wings as Sherlock launched himself over the pool.
Just as John was about to confirm that there was indeed only one patch, his mobile rang. He jerked awake, cursing Sherlock’s violin and the slow day at the clinic as he grabbed the phone.
“Had a fight with his wife?” suggested John and received Sherlock’s best “you are an idiot” look for his pains.
By the time they arrived within sight of the castle, the day was beginning to turn quite warm.  Sweating and huffing a bit, Ivan was startled when Sherlock suddenly landed next to him.
“You married Mr Wentworth shortly after the publication of his first novel, a highly fictionalized account of his voyage around the world on a series of tramp steamers.”
“Damn. That would have only made Sherlock more determined to pursue it. What about the other case? What happened during the meeting?”
John limped up the stairs, wondering exactly what kind of work Sherlock had taken up that involved “clients.”
“Show John your hands,” Sherlock ordered Tyler. The youth looked puzzled but complied.  John examined them thoroughly.
Suddenly, a horse neighed up ahead.  The chestnut stallion neighed in response.  A few more paces and the trees thinned and Ivan came in sight of Marfa Hudovna’s house.  But here he saw something strange, for in front of the house stood a well-grown apple tree, bearing blossoms and fruit together.  Next to the tree, grazing on windfalls, stood Bezimyan.
Sherlock managed to slip past her up the stairs, leaving John and his books to mollify their landlady.  It wasn’t a bad strategy.  Once Mrs Hudson had blown off her initial head of steam and realized that John was listening to her patiently while holding nearly two stone of books, she quickly became more sympathetic – at least towards John.
Sherlock was a good size for a beta, longer than most but without an alpha’s girth. John gave the rosy head a friendly lick. Where Sherlock’s pouch slit tasted salty and sweet, his cock carried a touch of bitterness as well. Two different tastes and yet both were unmistakeably Sherlock. John tasted both again to be sure... And then once more... And then – but Sherlock was trembling hard under John’s hands and mouth. John looked up the bed to see that Sherlock had thrown his head back and screwed his eyes tightly shut.
She took a deep breath. “When he took you to the university that evening, did you go along with the plan because you thought you’d be able to steal something?”
John licked his lips and shifted in his seat, wondering how long the concert was going to last. Then the concert started. John stopped wondering and started listening.
“Damn it, Sherlock, there are police constables meant to be doing that sort of thing. Couldn’t you have waited for one just this once?”
In one smooth series of motions, Ivan plucked Muircheartaigh’s heart from the case, bent to lay it on the stone floor and touched it with the tip of the golden feather.  The heart burst into flame – and so, with a shriek, did Muircheartaigh.
“Please.  Domestic violence is so common place.  I prefer to be assaulted for more exciting reasons.”
“Dr Watson, my colleague and husband.”  Sherlock turned to John.  “John, Sergeant Sally Donovan.  Old friend.  Well, I say ‘friend’...”
“Small-time crook. Usually works with Bill Ives, who has an equally crooked brother-in-law named George Banks who lives in the States.  Specifically, in Massachusetts.”
“No, but I copied them.”  Sherlock pushed a piece of paper across the table, covered with the spiky handwriting John had seen elsewhere around the flat.
“Precisely. Sherlock assured me that the young lady would be able to manage on her own once she was out of the UK.”
Sod the sheets, he needed to be alone. He limped up the stairs to his old room, kit bag in hand, the sound of Mrs Hudson giving Sherlock a piece of her mind clearly audible behind him.  There was no rumbled baritone response, so Sherlock was apparently ignoring her.
Angelo came back with a small glass bowl containing a lit tea-light.  He put it onto the table and gave John a thumbs-up before turning and walking away again.
“To over-simplify, yes. Foucault delivered an update on their work at the Heidelberg conference.  What’s interesting is that although he’s the senior researcher, it was Campbell-Williams who was quoted as making several apparently off-the-cuff remarks to the effect that practical results were imminent.”
“Her cross!” exclaimed Stevens, brightening a bit.  “Did you bring it?  The other detective said that it was evidence but that they’d return it to me as soon as possible.  It was her mother’s and meant a lot to her.  I wanted it to b-bu-bur... ”
Lestrade sighed again. “All right. You tell me what you know and I’ll tell you what I know. There’s little enough of it at point and I’ve got the horrible feeling that the only man who might be able to sort it out for us is laying on an operating table right now.”
“Fine, Lestrade could have called Foucault tomorrow morning! But, no, you’re in too much of a hurry to prove your cleverness once again.  Clever enough to pin a spot of vandalism...”
An elderly boyar from Grud’gorod knelt to make his oath.  As he rose to his feet – with some difficulty – he spoke out in a carrying voice.  “If I may be so bold, Your Majesty, when does the tsarevich ride forth?”
“It took a bit of getting used to, but I like being close to her. It feels as if we... know each other better, if that makes sense?”
“Damn the cold bastard! Mycroft told Sherlock that if Sherlock went against Magnussen, he’d be going against Mycroft as well. I just didn’t think he’d... Fucking Holmeses!”
“Don’t try to force it like that, you’ll break it. Here.” She tossed something at him, which he caught by reflex. The car keys. “You’ll never get all that on the Tube. Put the keys in the mail slot when you bring the car back. Don’t bother knocking, I won’t answer.”
“He’s my half-brother, to be precise.  And to avoid exiling me, he would have had to call in more political favours than he considered the situation to be worth.”
With another sigh, John rephrased. “I mean that I’m not going to allow you to create a situation in which I might hurt you because I’m not in my right mind.”
It was fine. It was all fine, up until the day that Sherlock leapt from the roof of St Bart’s. After that the problem was not that life no longer seemed fine. The problem was that life no longer seemed
child through the alleyways of London! It’s past time you learned to grow up, show some responsibility and
.”  John could feel his face flaming.  “I never thought when I came up with the plan that you’d be so bloody
John wondered if Sherlock had added breathing to the list of things his transport didn’t really need.
After a moment, John nodded.  “Right, then.  So we can’t expect the call until early tomorrow morning.  Anything on for today?”
“It was about as ‘implied’ as the nose on my face!  But if you like, I’ll start off.  You were apprenticed to Muircheartaigh.  He was murdering people in a place called London.  You found out and reported him to your brother’s guards, so I’m guessing your brother is someone reasonably well-off.  A boy was killed when the guards tried to capture Muircheartaigh.  Muircheartaigh stole your heart and escaped.”
George “Georgie Boy” Jones was an ex-con with a small tattooing business and a megfriend who ran a gambling ring. Neither of them were happy when her oncoming heat brought them home from the pub at a relatively early hour only to discover Sherlock and John searching their flat. When George panicked and began to spill a tale about a routine debt collection visit gone wrong, Minnie the meg pulled a gun out of her copious cleavage and pointed it at Sherlock. John distracted her by shooting the wall behind her, Sherlock jumped her in an attempt to retrieve her gun and then George – a big man, but a bit slow – tried to jump Sherlock but landed on Minnie instead.
The sorcerer burnt as if he were dry tinder rather than flesh and bone.  Sparks flew everywhere, igniting the books and scrolls they landed on, and the flames began to spread.
“JOHN!” Sherlock screamed and came, his muscles grasping John’s cock deep inside him, and then John was coming too.
The surgeon looked tired and her scrubs were stained, but what John noticed first was that she lacked the numb, defeated look of a doctor who’s had a patient die under their hands. He knew exactly what that felt like. This woman was not feeling it. John began to feel just slightly hopeful for the first time since he’d got Lestrade’s call.
Remembering Muircheartaigh, Ivan was fairly sure that being separated from his heart hadn’t been Sherlock’s idea.  However, he was here to listen to Tyuleneva’s story, not to argue with her, so he merely shrugged again.
John was just finishing the washing up when Sherlock came into the room holding some sort of package.  Something heavy for its size by the way he held it.
Sherlock shrugged.  “We were only half-brothers – and never friends.  He did what he could.  I didn’t expect anything more and therefore was not disappointed.”
Mary stepped forward from the kitchen. She’d been reluctant to join today’s family gathering. To John, it seemed as she been withdrawing – gradually detaching herself – for the past few days. It was for the best, but sometimes he found himself wishing that things could have been different.
Tyler glared sullenly at the floor, but remembered to speak up. “I told him to take them.  He said they made his stomach hurt and he didn’t have to take orders from a kid and you’d never know unless I was a rat and told you.  What was I supposed to do?  Pill him like we pill the cat?”
“And with you as well, Sara Dmitrievna.  Wait, take this.”  He handed her the crimson feather.  “For your feet.  And the others’.  Grab the guards’ gear and get everyone clear of the castle.”
Sherlock led the way by swooping from tree to tree, while Ivan struggled behind on foot, pausing frequently to blaze their trail.
Greg showed up the next evening, dragged John out to a pub and bought him enough pints that John could blame it on the beer when he broke down and cried. Greg had had a few himself by then.  He patted clumsily in the general direction of John’s shoulder.  “Whatever I can do to help, mate, you let me know.”
“She needs the pouch,” Sherlock warned, but he held the infant so that Mary could see her, if only for a few seconds. Then he tucked his daughter into his pouch, arranging her so that her tiny mouth brushed a teat.
He used the helicopter ride home to consider what he might do with it.  There was a time for music – and a time for motion.
it, Myc. Somebody’s put a bullet in my boy and if I ever find out whom, I shall turn absolutely monstrous,” declared Mrs Holmes as she ladled out punch.
Ivan thought he should run and get Marfa Hudovna but he could not tear himself away, could only watch in horror as the dark, shimmering
Soon after he finished eating, the long day’s ride began to catch up with him.  Marfa Hudovna smiled at his yawns and showed him to a spare bedroom, where a fine featherbed waited for his weary body.
It wasn’t a pre-meditated kiss. It was just that Sherlock was right there and smiling at something John had said and that his lips looked softer than Miranda Caustlin’s and that John wondered what they’d feel like against his own.  So he kissed Sherlock and then he kissed him again and then Sherlock started to kiss John back, which was brilliant.
“Oh, hell, I was supposed to tell you that first, wasn’t I?” Her obvious dismay made John laugh and then he couldn’t stop laughing and then he was sitting down and someone had got him some more horrible coffee.
The next morning, Ivan knocked at Sara Dmitrievna’s door, the sealed letters and the tsar’s ring in one hand.  He felt somewhat awkward.  Sara was an attractive woman – intelligent, brave and fair to look at.  They had enjoyed each other’s company greatly during the long journey, but now Ivan worried that this might have given rise to certain expectations on her part.
“Just this once, young man. I’m not a restaurant, that’s downstairs.” Mrs Hudson didn’t sound all that perturbed.
“John, if the assassins of London had been meeting for regular get-togethers every Wednesday afternoon, I would have found out long before now. You need more clothes, so you’re going... home.”
...As he woke up, lying in his bedroll, panting, still fully dressed and now rather sticky at the groin.  When his breathing had slowed, he stripped off his trousers, wiped himself with them, and then tossed them out of his bedroll.  Then he went back to sleep.  He’d figure it out in the morning.
His phone had rung at just that moment. It wasn’t Greg but rather Mycroft, his voice all posh reserve.
“Quite understandable,” replied Sherlock.  “I don’t have the cross with me, but I’ll ensure it’s returned to you.  Did your wife often wear it outside of the house?”
John hadn’t asked Harry anything. He’d snuck into her room and helped himself to the magazines she kept stashed underneath her mattress.  There’d been hell to pay when she caught him.
Carefully, John unfastened Sherlock’s trousers and drew them off, along with Sherlock’s pants and socks. Then he placed one steadying hand on Sherlock’s hip and leaned down to taste. Several things happened at once. Sherlock gasped, his hips tried to buck upwards and something hit John on the underside of his chin.
Sherlock ignored both the debris and Lestrade’s attempt at introductions, instead making a beeline for the red-scrawled whiteboard.
kept in the Tower of London, in a vault guarded day and night.  The vault was locked with a specially designed combination lock that would fuse shut if the wrong combination was entered.  The combination was handed down through the royal family, and only three people knew it at any time.  The last three known holders were James VII and His Majesty’s two younger brothers, the Dukes of Norfolk and Clarence.”
“Hallucinations,” Anderson stated confidently.  “She’s another one of these druggies frightened to death by their own hallucinations.”
Fine, then.  John made his way into the bedroom, frowning slightly as he discovered a good-sized bed that could easily have held two.  He’d forgotten to ask Sherlock about clean sheets, but he was too tired to care.  He brushed his teeth in the bathroom next door, then undressed and slipped between the cool, smooth sheets.  They smelled of male skin and tea and something subtle and spicy.  Expensive soap or shampoo.
“They were, but also – well, since I’ll never see them on you again – I mean, not that I regret that!  But...  All right, what are you snickering about?”
“I need a power source,” the creature announced suddenly.  His wings flexed, feathers rustling, in an apparently unconscious display of impatience.  He too began to circle the room, picking up and discarding bits and pieces of things, until he came face to face with Ivan.  The silver eyes narrowed.
Mary didn’t find the joke as funny as John had hoped. “Of course. Speaking of the wedding party, are you sure about not inviting your sister? Especially where all your parents are deceased...”
So did John. “I’m going to turn in now.”  If his host had been anyone else, he would have prefaced the statement with, “If you don’t mind.”  If his host had been anyone else, they would have shown him to his room, told him they’d changed the sheets or at least given him fresh ones.
Along the road on the northern side stood a small house, no more than a cabin, really.  Behind the house was a small field of rye, well-grown and heavy-headed.  In the field stood a plump man with a scythe, just beginning to harvest the rye.  Seeing the stranger on a dun gelding stop and study the fork, the man called out, “Hello, friend!  Do you need directions?”
“To the point where he might have tried to follow Sherlock around at one time or another?” John persisted.
“But look, don’t you find that, well...” John waved first in the general direction of Greg’s right wrist and then across the pub towards a small group of women talking with each other.
“Perhaps a talented amateur. Someone who had not only the training but also access to a tattoo machine, needles and ink.”
“I am.”  John didn’t add, there’s nothing left for me here anymore.  Too maudlin, especially given that he didn’t have the excuse of being drunk.  He finished off his glass, stood, threw some money on the table and collected his cane.
It was an obvious distraction, but one Ivan was grateful for.  They spent the rest of the evening telling tales, but the entire time Ivan’s heart sang, he’s alive.  Sherlock’s alive.
They made their way down the stairs to the ground floor and slipped out into the alley.  Sherlock was checking to make sure the door had locked behind them when there was a yell from the mouth of the alley.  “Oi!  Who’s there?”
But when some of passengers, luggage in hand, began to approach the buses, the man with the clipboard frowned.  Still smiling, the assistants herded the baffled but cooperative passengers into a group.  There they waited until the last bag had been claimed, some of the younger children beginning to fuss in the drizzle.
Mr Holmes turned out to be a good walking companion who set a somewhat less strenuous pace than Sherlock. He and John talked about the same sorts of things that John and Lestrade talked about at the pub – sports, politics, the weather, the latest Bond flick and sports.
. Nothing could have convinced you except Mary’s own words, her own actions, performed in front of your own eyes. So I arranged for the performance. It was the only way you’d believe me.”
John didn’t doubt it. Quite clearly Dexter would have preferred John to be still living with Mary, as far away from 221B as possible.
“See? I knew it wouldn’t take you long.” John couldn’t deny that he was enjoying the view. Sherlock’s close-fitting nursing tunics gave him the look of an exotic prince. John particularly liked this one, a deep purple satin. He wondered if Sherlock might be persuaded to wear it from time to time even after Madeleine was weaned and Sherlock could go back to shirts that tucked into his trousers.
subconscious and however our subconscious minds managed to affect the skin on our wrists,” John said dubiously.
“Enough!” roared Watt.  “More to the point, how do we get Ivan out of the capital without being discovered, and how do we answer the questions that will be raised about his absence?”
“Yes,” sighed John. “Look, when you signalled Greg to ask Tyler about selling laboratory equipment to manufacture illegal drugs?  I really don’t see how you had enough information to deduce that.  I have to wonder if you were making a guess – no, don’t interrupt! – based on personal experience, specifically from a period in your life that Greg knows about.”
Sherlock stared and then chuckled.  “John, you continue to surprise me.  Umbrella Man, indeed.  But he
“John, dear, I couldn’t help but notice that you and Sherlock are using the upstairs bedroom now,” Mrs Hudson began in a confidential tone. “I just wanted to thank you. I didn’t like to say anything about the noise...”
“She’s lovely,” Mrs Holmes assured John after Madeleine’s birth photo had been passed around for the third time. Sherlock had refused to have the infant in his pouch disturbed unless absolutely necessary – “She’s not a peepshow! – and his carrymum had backed him. The two of them were now sitting shoulder to shoulder on the sofa, betas united.
“I told you I needed an assistant,” said Sherlock blandly as he traded his leather gloves for a latex pair.
“No, that I didn’t, doctor. That would be cheatin’.” Bill swallowed the last of his tea and wiped crumbs off his mouth with the back of his hand. “Missus ‘udson, doctor, it’s been a pleasure.” And he sauntered out the door.
Four days later, John was washing his hands after seeing a patient and something changed within his field of vision. It took him a moment to realize what.  The band of gold-pigmented skin around his wrist darkened slowly, the last faded colour bleeding out of it.  A nurse ducking into the room in search of bandages glanced at his face, looked again, noticed his wrist and had him sit down.  Breathe, doctor, in, out, in, out, steady now, steady, is there someone you can call to take you home?
organize a feast.  Up to you, but I rather thought you’d prefer to enjoy a quiet meal of excellent food.”
“Well, I’ve, er, never done any housebreaking before.”  John felt mildly uncomfortable when Sherlock said nothing but continued to study John across the table.  Trying for a mild joke, John added, “Maybe you’d be better off taking Angelo.  He has experience.”
deletion process is random and outside your conscious control. You clutter your mind with things that have absolutely no practical importance but only... Oh.”
“Anything he considers important enough to hide when he’s under invasion is likely to be of interest.  Step aside.”  Sherlock plucked a black feather from his head and inserted the shaft into the keyhole.  A moment’s work and he had the lock open.
“You’ve already made the mistake of not taking the detritus of your pregnancy test with you for deposit in a public waste bin when you left. You won’t help your case by continuing to lie.”
to say that I’ve never seen the point of providing separate spoons for a couple who presumably either are or shortly will be sharing body fluids.” Sherlock dipped into the tiramisu and then proceeded to enjoy his spoonful. With extreme thoroughness.
. At our ages, it’s not too soon to start thinking of children, and I know you’ve been worried about being caught off-guard.”
As it turned out, there were a few moments yet. It was 7:21 AM – John recorded this – when the infant slid into Sherlock’s waiting hands, tiny, bald, red and indubitably female, with a clear brown pre-pouch spanning her abdomen. She waved her arms rhythmically, ancient instinct telling her she needed to climb to reach to the safety of the pouch.
Sherlock was the first one to enter, inhaling deeply as he circled the room.  He stopped at the room’s one window, set high in the wall, and gave the latch a tug.
“Magnussen’s house, Appledore,” repeated Sherlock. “The greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world. The Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals – and
“Christ, Sherlock, the man let his dog attack you, helped you evade proper medical care, introduced you to an addictive drug and persisted in having sex with you because he enjoyed it even though you didn’t. But apparently none of that mattered because he told you that you were ‘amazing.’”
“To spend the rest of my life with the right pair of people – or the right person, if it comes to that – I’d be willing to make quite a few concessions,” responded John, equally quietly.
. Everything they’d done up until now, Sherlock had done before – and quite possibly only for cases. This,
“He was, yes.” John could tell from Foucault’s expression that he’d caught Sherlock’s change in verb tense.  “He suffered from heart problems and the early stages of dementia.  He was well enough to have his own flat, with frequent visits from a paid caregiver and almost daily visits from his niece.  The niece went on holiday, leaving her 16-year-old son to look after his granduncle.”
Ran away screaming.  The phrase nagged at Ivan for a moment and then he had it.  “The dance he did in the clearing – that was one of the tests, wasn’t it?  He was trying to scare me away.”
carefully. He’d be getting more action if they were watching a Bond flick, and not just from the screen.
Ivan couldn’t have said no even if the invitation hadn’t been so obvious.  Any bit of information he could glean about Sherlock’s past seemed vitally important.
Then Bill burst out, “I don’t see how you can do it.  We, we gave up our lives to fight for King and Country, and they
“Sherlock, your body has five months’ of preparations to make in half the time! How are you going to make that happen?”
Sherlock’s shoulders relaxed marginally. “Really. Some other sort of health care professional?” He put aside the notebook and pen he’d been using.
Eurus took her violin off her shoulder and glared.  Then she put the violin back and played "Ah! vous dirai-je, maman," without ornamentation.  Very slowly.
“Good.”  John’s own smile was brief.  “Because I don’t.  If I make a full breakfast, will you eat it?”
“He’s being released into my care tomorrow in any case. I’ve managed to get my appointments for the next two weeks rescheduled with other doctors.”
So Ivan tied Bezimyan to a birch tree behind the house, unstrapped his walking stick and began to follow behind Misha in the field, gathering the cut rye into bundles and tying them off.  The day was fine and warm, the work hot and sweaty.  Ivan’s leg throbbed with pain ever more insistently, but he worked without complaint.
They got coffees, ordered their sandwiches. After the waitress had left, John took a long pull of his coffee before asking, “So, the new laws?”
“I must have seemed like the perfect foil to you. You positioned me outside your marriage but encouraged John to keep seeing me as a friend. You counted on my proximity decreasing the chances that he’d pay attention to other betas – and you also counted on my ignorance of human nature to keep me from realizing John’s feelings. You were correct on the latter point. I didn’t.
“But Lestrade doesn’t, does he? Seriously, Sherlock, you need to think of something we can tell him. MI-5 barged in this morning and confiscated the contents of Magnussen’s office and flat, but left Lestrade with the murder case. And a drunken elderly gent who lives on Craven Hills Terrace reported seeing a large projection of a blonde, blue-eyed woman on the buildings across the street last night. What the hell was that meant to be?”
This information sorted well with Ivan’s own observations of the man – and Sara Dmitrievna’s as well, when he discussed the matter with her.
The creature grinned and held out a hand as if to help Ivan up.  “Come then, Ivan Watovich!  The game’s afoot - or rather, a-wing!”
