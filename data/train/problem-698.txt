"I see."
"Stay."
John felt a bubble of nervous apprehension pop in his stomach – he'd actually forgotten about the damned counselling appointment. Ugh.
The gaze that had been so heavily focused on his hand flickered up to stare right back at him.
Well. That was a good sign. Wasn't that a good sign? He was typing before he'd even thought about what to say:
There was a moment of silence before a sigh, a groan and, finally, the words that John had known would be coming. "Well, he wouldn't be messing around on rocks, I can tell you that much, but I suppose if I'm to make sure you don't break something..."
Ahem. Seriously, though. You're all amazing. I dedicate this to all of you. And every other chapter. =3
addiction.
"Just pay your part," John insisted, pushing his £10 back into the middle of the table and standing up, heading towards the door of the restaurant without giving Sherlock a chance to argue. "And if you're implying what I think you're implying you can bloody well forget it."
John balked, looking down at his sleep-wrinkled clothes and back up at Sherlock. "I don't know, I hadn't really thought about it. Would you prefer it if I did?"
Wanda's eyes snapped away from John's. "They've barely spoken since he got here, Tim, it's
"Hold on, John, I've got you – lean on me, lean on me. I'll hail a cab, just wait a moment -"
John grinned slightly and raised his eyes back to the two other men in the room. Mycroft was already sliding on a long, black coat, unperturbed by John’s lack of response and apparently accurately reading into it rather accurately. “We’ll leave you two to have your conversation in peace, then. Gregory, you have a lecture at 9am tomorrow, correct? You should probably get some rest.”
would undermine his own feelings for John – "Damn it, Sherlock, I didn't mean for you to… no. No." He forced his nerves to calm, his laughter to cease; he could see the frozen blank stare of the man opposite him and he knew that behind it was now a myriad of negativity that he could not control nor change. "I mean that my feelings, they're… different, they're more than I've had for Mike or Molly or Greg or Sally or pretty much anyone I've ever been friends with -"
"A colour, a favourite colour. Do you have one?"
Mycroft moved aside with a low, patronising chuckle. “I’m sure you don’t, little brother – no doubt you have something or should I say
"Of course I am," he agreed, the lack of emotion almost funny in its contrast with his acquiescence. "My brother decides to tell my housemate something that I told him in the strictest of confidence and then my housemate, idiot extraordinaire, tells the only person in the world that I wouldn't want to know about it and – let's ensure the perfect finale –
"No," Wanda interrupted her husband, suddenly looking like a lioness in all her trembling ferocity, "I won't have you utter his name, Tim, certainly not when referring to Sherlock's friends. He was never a friend to him."
"No!" John's quick response was too quick, too loud. He cleared his throat, feeling his hands start to shake at the effort of it all. "No, I... I'll meet you at the party, got things to do on Friday but yeah, sure, as soon as I'm done... I'll be there. For sure."
Harry let out a low chuckle. "Mm, early onset sexual tension. My favourite. Remember, babe?"
of him figure out how two such down to earth people could have possibly raised two sons so completely different from themselves. It wasn't until he noticed Mycroft tapping his foot impatiently at the bottom of the stairs that he became aware of how intently he was staring at them both, mouth partially open as he watched their simple, easy banter. He cleared his throat quickly and reached out for his suitcase from Tim, giving him a quick smile and thanking him for his trouble before turning around to follow a very bored-looking Mycroft up to the first floor.
when that happens, believe me, but... you need to figure out your feelings, at least. Because when you do figure it out, it's not just you that'll be affected. I genuinely think that if you're going to move on from all of this, no matter which way it goes, you need to work out where you're at."
promise Henry that you'd do it this year, after missing last year."
"Yes, yes, I know," John sighed, letting his foot fall to the floor in irritation, "I know I'm not just magically better, but I'm…
John needn't have worried so much. Sherlock's tongue found its way back to John's lip, John meeting it instantly with a gliding sweep of his own; Sherlock seemed to jerk slightly, startled at the contact, but it was with a hesitant persistence that Sherlock flicked the curled warmth once more against the ridge of their kiss and John again moved to meet the moist heat and brushed it against the centre of a tongue that tasted of something deeper than spearmint toothpaste and was altogether more satisfying to him. He was unable to stop himself from shifting closer, his hands moving from Sherlock's shoulders to instead press their palms over the elegant collarbone taunting him and his thumbs skating intently over the skin beneath Sherlock's pyjama top. A jolt of raw want burned all the way from his chest to his lower abdomen as Sherlock's slender hands moved from where they had been supporting himself and instead came to rest, solid and unequivocally real, on John's mid-thigh; the fingers spread themselves out almost as if to hold on, the knowledge that Sherlock was so intent on increasing the heat of the kiss – his tongue slipping and sliding against John's with growing certainty – that he would strain his stomach muscles in order to do so making the low rumble in the back of John's throat grow a little more in volume and the very epitome of
Not that it was sense. It was entirely ridiculous.
(See the end of the chapter for
John gritted his teeth. Who was this guy, making assumptions about someone he knew nothing about?
"I can help if you like," he insisted, placing his suitcase down just inside of the porch and shucking off his trainers, wandering into the living room and finding himself utterly unsurprised to see it looked exactly as it had when he'd left, only much cleaner. "But a cuppa would be great, I'm parched." He settled himself down into the beige two-seater sofa by the window, plumping the cushions behind him and letting his head fall back onto the soft material. "Journey was fine, no delays. Managed to catch a few winks too."
Mycroft’s gaze was steady. “Gregory told me that John was injured. You are here, clearly shaken, resisting vulnerability, and you have yet to tell me the real reason as to why you turned up on my doorstep at 11 o’clock at night. You have blood on your shirt which is evidently not your own and considering he so blindly overlooked your drug addiction in order to pursue a relationship with you I am relatively certain that you feel a certain level of responsibility for him and his care.” His own chin tilted up, matching Sherlock’s arrogance without hesitation. “Therefore you wouldn’t have left him to care for himself.”
John glimpsed them both alternately, to the older Holmes brother with his combined look of determination and concern and the younger Holmes brother with a stare of boredom and mild irritation. It was almost amusing. Almost. “Sorry to interrupt you both during your staring competition, but it’s not getting any easier to stay conscious…”
“Now more than ever.”
There was something about Sherlock playing the violin that had a profound, irrevocable effect on John Watson.
Actually, no. I don't apologise. I have enough to be dealing with, which you CLEARLY know already, and apologising to people like you who live to inflict misery on people who already have far more than their fair share to be getting on with is just not that high on my list of things to do.
“Well,” John began with a shrug, “I’m going to have to see them eventually. I can’t avoid them for the entirety of the summer break, no matter how welcoming your parents are or how much they – well, your mum – clearly wants me here.”
John shifted slightly under the blankets, kicking them off of his feet. "Ask you what?"
"No," Sherlock said, his tone infinitely bored, "rather more hesitant about slipping and cracking open my skull."
John shook his head. "No. Explain to me how on earth I missed the fact that you actually wanted to talk to me rather than just… force me to study."
"My brother, you see, never does it just once. He's no better than the rest of them after the first prick of the needle, seeking it out constantly, forming a habit – he functions far better than most addicts, of course, but it has been known to crack before. He has been known to... break. I mean it, though: if it is in his possession, he will inject it."
"That my brother was on his way to a six-month undercover operation that was certain to end in death is very telling, wouldn't you say? The lengths he would go to in order to protect you and your family… well. I'm not sure I'll ever understand it, John, but then Sherlock has always been one to glorify in the element of surprise, don't you think?"
"Well, you're doing it now."
"Oh, well done darling."
anything to change, at least not in the way that they interacted – and silently took his steps to stand in the middle of the doorway.
"I must do," John half-whispered back, smile twitching on his numb lips, "I'm your friend, aren't I?"
Surprised, John stopped buttering the toast and looked up at him. Sherlock's eyes were fixed wholly on his own moving hands. "Really?"
By the time he had turned eleven and started at secondary school he was already taking it upon himself to use the exact same mechanism to keep her from derailing. Where his friends would go to after-school activities – as well as Harry keeping herself out of the house as much as possible – John would rush home to tell his mother all about his day, helping her cook dinner and do housework and coming up with all sorts of questions and stories in order to give her the opportunity to take a break from the whirlwind of thoughts which most likely plagued her through the day. He would walk through the off-white front door and offer her the most sincere smile he possibly could, trying to ignore the puffiness of her eyes as he offered her a brief kiss on the cheek and hung his coat on the wooden hooks within the porch, already regaling her with details of every class he had participated in and the various shenanigans his friends had got up to that day. She would smile in response, nodding and making all of the right noises, the two of them working in tandem to ensure that neither of them had to see the half-empty bottle of gin sitting by his father's arm-chair and the pile of brown envelopes stacked on the microwave from monder-lenders demanding repayment.
John was paler than ever, could feel that the blood had drained completely from his face, but at least he was regaining some of his natural calm. "Sherlock went to see Mycroft specifically to tell him that he... that he feels..."
"So it's entirely possible?"
"So..." John considered his words carefully, unsure of how to phrase something he wasn't even sure he wanted to say. "You haven't ever... wanted to?"
John's silence spoke volumes.
"You are so fucking in denial," Greg cut across exasperatedly, torn between a grin and a grimace. "That or you are genuinely even stupider than I am."
disappointed when you couldn't perform last year."
"I make exceptions when I need to. Everybody is different."
"Are you afraid of me?"
grown man was enjoying himself." The flush in John's cheeks was deepening, his hands curling into fists and then relaxing as he fought against the urge to do... whatever it was he wanted to do. Sherlock was hopelessly out of his depth here. "Sherlock, I didn't pull away because I didn't want to carry on."
feel the same way -"
Mycroft’s nose wrinkled slightly. “Please, there’s no need for that.”
It clicked instantly that Sherlock was being careful not to reveal his name – lucky, really, as any hesitation on John's part would no doubt cause further suspicion and possible harm to the both of them. He took his steps resolutely, walking until he reached the space between them. He extended his arms, knowing that his willingness would no doubt work in their favour.
The genius allowed him a nod. "It did. But I am at fault for that and I would prefer if you rescinded all blame and laid it wholly on me. The truth, John, is that I was…"
to talk about you. And then Mycroft told me he knew that you and he weren't actually having sex, but that it was pointless to tell Sherlock that as he'd probably just come up with bigger and more detailed stories, and trust me,
"Mm, well, he managed to get a position at Kwik Fit down the road a little while ago but he, ah... well, he got into a spot of trouble one day with a customer and had to take a little unpaid leave of absence for a while." Her cheeks were flushed, embarrassment obvious despite her blasé approach to it all. "So financially we're not as fluid as we'd like to be..."
Tim suddenly looked serious. "There's nothing funny about urinary incontinence, boys."

"Two –

Her considerably hairy brow wrinkled in confusion. "You weren't speaking."

Joanne stayed seated, wanting to allow him to have the upper hand here. “With me, or with anyone?”
There was no refrain, the four semi-quaver rhythm followed by a short rest still unwelcomingly batting at his eardrums as Sherlock made no sign whatsoever that he had heard Mycroft's displeasure. The older man cleared his throat, rustling at his newspaper as loudly as he could and shifting his position so that he was leaning further back in his chair – not that putting a few extra centimetres-worth of distance would make any sort of difference.
"Like this, like this," John urged quietly, a hand leaving the shirt and rising to press light fingertips against Sherlock's lips; instinctively Sherlock formed his lips into a gentle moue, John leaning up instantly to brush his lips against both the gentle pressure of his own fingers and the shape beneath it, removing his fingertips and instead letting them take rest upon the top of Sherlock's arm as he encouraged Sherlock's progress with the unexpected softness of his oddly tender insistence. The hand left on his chest was now moving, trailing down to momentarily rest on his stomach – intimate, very intimate, perhaps
Wanda's head tilted ever so slightly to the side, eyes still on her son. "Sherlock, dear, would you help me put the table linens away?"
"Of course," Sherlock muttered, taking it from John with a tug and turning his back to the shorter man as he placed the two glasses down with a gentle clatter to the counter, taking in a few deep breaths as he twisted off the cap. "A large glass of wine." He poured the deep ruby liquid into each glass with surprisingly steady hands, levelling them out until each glass held an equal amount – it must be equal, equality was imperative for whatever reason his over-clocked mind had decided upon – and finally picking one up and turning back around. John was already waiting, fingers outstretched.
"I probably quite
She'd glanced at him. "I think it would be safe to say that he's not
John's eyes flickered up to meet his. "Well, I'm
The two of them stared at her as if they'd quite forgotten her; she stared back.
John’s trembling fingertips found their mark, brushing so lightly and with such suppressed ferocity against the warm, pale skin that the contradiction rocked a shudder through the smaller man’s body.
I apologise, I should have explained that our sessions would take place via computer. I see no need for us to meet in person when most of the course material is so easily accessible on the university's intranet system.
"Naturally. Pets, then. Any of those?" Sherlock's leg was jiggling slightly, almost as if antsy in his anticipation to hear the answer. "Cat? Dog? Mouse? Rat? Goldfish?"
Jim nodded. "In that case, John, that's about all we need to do today. Like I said, today is just an introductory session, just a way of us making sure we both know what page we're on and where we're going to go from here."
John blinked. "Yes, people. Human beings."
At that, John raised his head and found himself staring for the first time at Sherlock; the genius avoided his eyeline completely, but that didn't stop John from feeling like he was holding a live wire and all too close to being shocked. He heard the raucous laughter of Harry in his head and violently kicked at it. "Perform? You're going to perform?"
Now it was Mycroft's turn to shoot his brother an exasperated glare. “Don't be absurd, even if it is your natural disposition.” He ruffled the pages of his newspaper once more. “That's only on a Wednesday.”
“Forgive me, John. Don’t come any closer.”
"There was something else."
Sherlock's mind went momentarily blank: the idea of John being
"Oh no you can't," Sherlock said with a sarcastic laugh, "you'll just end up sleeping!"
John offered him a smile, nudging him again with his shoulder but lingering there for just a few moments before leaning away again. "Yeah. Lots of that."
It's food poisoning. I'll be fine in no time."
Sherlock shrugged, glancing to the side to stare out of the window. "I like
John hesitated, unsure of his place. "Well, I mean... if you wouldn't mind me tagging along..."
“Sure? I can manage a few more minutes.”
"It's fine."
"No," John shut the door and turned to his friend, trying to look as serious as he could whilst Sherlock was practically pouting like a child, "no, we're all going to eat together and it will be something that we make from scratch. Or, y'know, sort of from scratch. Something that hasn't come out of the microwave. If you really want Thai we can pick up a sauce from the supermarket and make our own."
"John? Who's John?"
Sherlock paused at the edge of his rock, eyes scanning the other rocks around him before turning back to look at John. "Fearsome? You're not fearsome."
Sherlock waited.
"None of your business," John mumbled.
“Not hard enough. I tried to warn you, I tried to discourage you – and him. I thought he would be weaker, easier to sway -”
"Significant how?"
relationship... friendship... situation..." A tiny sigh. "I find it odd that you are somehow able to maintain a level of communication with... me, especially when people you've known for longer are not... involved... in this stage of your life."
was in love with him?
"So why – no, forget it. All right, so, tell me something about you then." John let himself flop back onto the soft leather of the sofa, feeling very much at home – the last few weeks since The Revelatory Evening had changed a lot for them, the most obvious thing being that John rarely left Sherlock and Greg's house. It was now much closer to home than his own bare college room. "I know you have Mycroft. Any other siblings?"
"No -" He stopped, inwardly cursing his instinctual response. He had already made this decision earlier. "Yes. Yes. I made it... perfectly clear earlier how I felt."
Sherlock's face suddenly widened into a huge grin, his grip tightening even more on John's arms as he gave him one final, resounding shake. "Life, John! Life itself!" Suddenly he was moving closer, so close that John could smell the wine on his breath, feel the warmth of the taller man's every exhale ruffling the top of his hair; Sherlock's face came within inches of his, leaning down slightly until he was perfectly at eye-level. "Let me show you how I live it!"
"Are you..." John tried to find the right words. "I don't know, are you... seeing anyone? Professionally? A group, maybe?"
The tight smile softened. The knot in his stomach lessened slightly. "It
"It is when you try to set double standards, John."
“I -” his voice cracked, and he could've sworn he almost saw his own father wince at the obvious emotion behind the single letter, the single syllable, “ - I
John set his laptop down on the table, opening the old machine up and bravely, determinedly typing 'London University of Sciences student support' into the intranet and hitting Enter. "Too late for that now. The damage is done. I'm involved."
"We used to have a dog. A red setter. Redbeard, I...
"I don't know, what did they look like?"
Greg finally spoke up, a welcome interlude to Mycroft's refined tones.
John could not speak. He could only wait, and try to remember how to inhale and exhale.
"You've read the form that I was forced to submit. It's really quite redundant to ask a question you already know the answer to."
"Oh, come on." John climbed up easily onto the first rock before stretching his leg out to step onto the next, an easy distance to close. He stood above his friend, holding his arms out and grinning. "They're hardly damp. Get up here."
"Sorry," John repeated, shaking his head but letting his hands fall from his face; he was quickly realising how ridiculous his panic had been. "Sorry, that's not me, I wasn't... I'm fine. I didn't mean to overreact. I just... christ. Are you sure?"
"You said you were tired, I should let you sleep."
John found he couldn't stand to look at him anymore; he turned back to the pan and started aggressively separating the chunks of mince that he had not paid enough attention to. "If that's how you feel, then, fine. I'll finish this and go apologise to your parents for infringing on their hospitality, pack my bag and leave."
Greg stepped quickly out of the way as Sherlock took lithe steps to the stairs, taking them two at a time and not looking back as he made his way to the bedroom; there was the sound of a door opening and closing quietly, footsteps on the ceiling above them and finally nothing, no sound at all.
armchair. It was not altogether dissimilar from the chair he had laid claim to back at Well Place, though that in itself was no coincidence: he had, after all, stolen the chair from Mycroft’s study in the first place.
She nodded, writing something else down. "And how

"YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF, YOU BASTARD!" A groan of pain followed.
“Yeah, but 'stuff' is important. C'mon, tell your big sis, what sort of stuff have you two gotten up to? I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.”
"What? Oh, with the friendship thing. Yes, yes, it's fine."
me. Distract me."
Greg glanced back down at the text message again. "Mycroft said you should go on your own."
Another pause. "Ah.
He caught it the moment it appeared – the almost delicious flicker of resistance against John's torn expression. He felt the shudder of weakness that resonated through John's body, saw the separation of lips as a stuttered exhale of breath fell against Sherlock's throat. He liked that. He liked that a lot. He wanted more of it, wanted more moments of John not being able to pretend – because surely he was pretending. Surely he couldn't miss the intent behind Sherlock's intensity.
"Yep. Say hello to Katie!"
“No,” John said, shaking his head. “They really aren’t important, they – WAIT.” One particular question began screaming itself hoarse in the back of his mind, probably the
"But don't," John laughed throatily, "oh, god, please don't."
Sherlock's arm rubbed against his again as he lifted his glass. "I'm not sure I should be listening to you. You're already drunk."
"I'm not trying to antagonise you, William. I'm trying to find something that you're willing to talk about. You
John sighed, knowing his entire reaction had been an over-exaggeration brought on my tiredness and the drama of the evening – he had embarrassed himself a bit. “Sorry. Guess I’m just… tired.”
A tiny smile as Mycroft swung the door closed. “Sherlock. John.” The door closed behind him, as quiet as the man himself; Sherlock leaned over into the bay window and shouted (apparently not caring that Greg was attempting sleep):
"So...?"
anything for me. It didn't set me on fire. It didn't make me feel anything beyond mild irritation and, no offence, disgust. It wasn't for me. But then I met my first girlfriend – though I'm not sure a snog and a little fumble in the Science stationery cupboard counts as a girlfriend – and
John folded his arms, leaning back against the counter. "When was the last time you cooked something, Sherlock?"
Not available? "Can I ask who I'm speaking to?"
"Well." Neil Watson cleared his throat, slipping his hands into the pockets of his jeans and rocking back on his heels. "Your mother wasn't lying when she said you'd lost weight."
Sherlock shrugged, though he did seem to willingly turn and begin to head towards the small hill. "They're bad enough at home, but put them out in public and they're all over each other."
who I am. This is what you want from me. You said it yourself."
“John? Who are you talking to?”
They shared a tentative grin.
He’d never felt like this before, really. John had
Mycroft's voice grumbled from the hallway as made his way to the bathroom. "If she'd listened in the
"Just
Carefully highlighting a passage of text, John did not take his eyes off of the page. "What?"
John did not seem to know whether to smile or not. His lips were constantly twitching as he attempted to suppress it. "You
When the voice spoke again, there was a hint of a smile there – John now felt a growing understanding of why William had used the word 'warm' earlier. It was strange. "Not to mention unfailingly negative, which evidently I inspire within you."
John shrugged. "He doesn't do it to be cruel, though. He just says what he thinks. I guess it doesn't affect me anymore, it's just what I've come to expect from him."
"All right."
Anyhoo... ENJOY! Much love to you wonderful people!
Greg bit his lip again, worrying away at it. "I told him that it was obvious that you guys weren't... doing it."
The two of them shook hands, the man quickly looking John up and down before nodding briefly.
The silence around the table was awful, awkward, unwanted. Not for the first time, John wished that he hadn't spoken, hadn't come here, hadn't even entertained the idea. It was the wrong time, both to have admitted his weakness and having thought he could actually return home and find comfort in it.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft’s voice was stronger, firmer, “I asked you a question earlier that you have yet to answer and I think that now is the time to try.”
"If only your imaginings were real, John, it would spare me such grief."
"I assume it's my turn now?" Sherlock's fingers fluttered over the cards, resting on one directly in front of them. "Do I just choose any?"
"The milk is Greg's responsibility, not mine. Actually, as you're here so often we should probably talk about you putting some money in for groceries -"
love is pretty much like they explain in movies. Kind of like... falling. You lose your footing and suddenly
true, the important bit was that they
Staring at him apprehensively, Sherlock waited a few beats before responding, repeating words John had used only a few hours ago in low, melodic waves of sound. "I'm not your bitch, John."
The fact that he'd tried, on more than a few occasions, to envision a future where John's existence within Sherlock's life led to a good outcome spoke volumes for how worrisome the whole situation could become.
John tipped the mince into the pan and picked up the wooden spatula beside him, listening intently as he waited for the first sound of vegetables being cut; he was rewarded with a perhaps slightly violent 'thud' of a knife against the chopping board. "I'm bothering because I think your mum is trying to help and I don't want to seem ungrateful."
When Sherlock opened his eyes, they were burning; the murmur slipped through his lips like a caress, his cheeks pinkening further still.
"No," John murmured weakly, trying his best to regain his footing, "no, I don't want to."
The voice's low tones sounded amused, slightly condescending. "In my living room, John. Where did you think I was? Hiding under your bed?"
Sherlock shot him a small glance. "You're forgetting, John, that I used to be the most feared pirate on the high seas. I
"When we're old and grey and our sons have disappeared off to live their own lives, Timothy, photographs are all we'll have to remember then by. MYCROFT!"
"Well, fine, yeah, but not in a bad way. Not in a friendship-destroying way. It is what it is, I can't change it, obviously... though why he'd even have those feelings is beyond me, I'm not going to lie, it baffles me."
It was no surprise, really, that John had never even considered the possibility that his and Sherlock's friendship was something else entirely.
John’s hands reaching forward, hesitating for just a moment before resting upon the solid plane of Sherlock’s chest.
told us to."
Sherlock put his hand out, silencing him. “I’ll get the blankets and make us a cup of tea. Then you can ask your questions. All right?”
"Mycroft," the voice muttered, the word full of loathing. "My brother."
"John," Sherlock groaned, flopping down onto his pillow and pulling the duvet with him, "that's hardly necessary…"
John's voice was gentle when it slipped from his lips, surprising himself. "It doesn't mean that you don't care."
Sherlock's face took on a look that could only be described as
John shrugged. "What's anyone scared of at first? The unknown, I suppose. And the knowledge that this isn't just... getting with a girl and seeing where it goes. I know I shouldn't make comparisons, but really, Sherlock, it isn't the same. If we...

a sociopath, John. You just bring out the worst in me."
Sherlock whirled around and was suddenly taking two, three, four steps towards him – John stopped dead: surprised, unsure - "
"The phrase, 'to every cloud there is a silver lining' – I believe that's right?"
Doesn't really explain why you didn't bother responding to my email to let me know that you still wanted to do this, though...
is holding hands,
Stretching his arms out so hard his back gave a worrying 'crack', John let a blissful yawn escape his lips as he leaned partially forward to make the most of the moment; he let himself flop back down with a sigh of genuinely contentment, his eyes drifting to gaze out at the rain and finding himself completely entranced by the sheer velocity at which the water droplets crashed to the glass. He'd always loved the rain. He couldn't really explain it, particularly when people were obsessed with heat and sun and summer – ugh, summer – but there was something infinitely calming about the skies opening. Better yet would have been a storm. He loved a good storm.
Guilt twisted in his stomach like gut rot, painfully heated and not at all undeserved – she was right. He had. Six years ago he had done exactly as he had just said he would never do.
The man was gone in an instant, not stopping his purposeful stride to the kitchen; John shut his eyes momentarily, his head a mass of pain and bewilderment as he tried to make sense of everything. In the end it was easier to just focus on the pulsing ache in his hand and ignore the rest of it, allowing himself a moment to mentally prepare himself for the strength he would need to get up in order to take off his bloodstained shirt – christ, that really
"I'm sure you'd like a bit of time to yourself to explore," Wanda enthused, eyes flitting like a hawk between them. "Martha, the lady I spoke to earlier, said that if you carry on down the beach in the other direction and go over that hill there, you'll find lots of rocks to climb over and disport yourself with."
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes cold. "Then go home. If it's such a waste of time for you, go home. Or back to university. I don't care."
“No,” she said gently, leaning forward and steepling her fingers in front of her, resting her chin lightly on top of her fingertips. “I mean talk to someone who... might be able to help you.”
"Not that long," Sherlock disagreed quietly. "Or not long enough that you're feeling...
This situation had escalated so quickly, like every other situation when a Holmes was involved; her phrasing, too, was different this time, too hard to dodge – he didn't want to lie, not when she was no longer asking about a relationship but rather inferring that
Sherlock closed his eyes, words building up behind his desperate tongue but his mind as ever keeping him from releasing them into the cavernous room. He chose his response carefully, deliberately, ignoring Mycroft’s allusion to his friend. “Drastic is an overstatement. I’m simply doing it to appease you and stop you from insisting that Greg limit his social life in order to keep an eye on me.”
Greg lifted the phone to his ear and turned partially away; they both waited in the silence as the phone rang, once, twice, three times, four -
"I already told you I don't want to rush this. Just because you're wearing pyjamas and you're lying in bed doesn't mean I'm going to take advantage of you or something. Do I need to remind you that I'm not exactly well-versed in… men?"
Well. It was like Sherlock all over again. Apparently love made you do things you didn't really think you were capable of.
The familiar hesitation, the slow turning of a doorknob; John instantly felt more awake, knowing as he did who would be on the other side of the door.
Wanda nodded. "One of Mycroft's lot."
Ridiculous. He didn't know which accommodation building John was in, let alone the flat number.
"He's actually not as unobservant as I first thought. He noticed how we were interacting during the drinking game on Friday and deduced that, due to your obvious discomfort and my apparent teasing, we aren't in a relationship." He began using the side of the fork to cut into the lasagne. "Needless to say I've managed to...
"It's not quite like that," John said tiredly, closing his eyes again. "He's not obsessed with me. He's my best friend."
Sherlock did not reply; instead he wound his way out of the alleyway without a single word, back through the streets that John would have never gone through in a million years had it not been for his seemingly unperturbed friend and only speaking once they were out onto a main road, lights almost shocking after so much time spent in darkness. "Are you feeling all right?"
"No."
I've seen what depression does to people and the lengths people go to escape it.
Sherlock whirled around. "Oh? How about... let me see..." He rolled his eyes. "How about enjoyment? Wouldn't you say
sorts of feelings, not like that!" He was laughing awkwardly and it sounded terrible and he knew even as he couldn't stop the laughter that Sherlock would feel as if John were laughing at the very idea of there being anything romantic between them, which of
"Nonsense," the determined woman interrupted, reaching down and seizing Tim's hand in her own. "Go off and have fun. I'll call you when we're getting ready to leave, hm?"
this..."
John had no consideration for what he was doing; too many thoughts and he would stall and break. His hand ghosted up through the dust, sending them flying in the opposite direction to Sherlock’s music, stopping moments short of touching the hand which reaped such fervent awe and disbelief; the ice-blue eyes found his once again, narrowing slightly until they were a flawed mess of expanding black and periwinkle fire.
John put down the highlighter on the coffee table. "It's been just over a month, Sherlock."
"Ah."
"I just can't imagine ever getting that close to someone, that willing to sort of... well. Fall."
That was the word.
John stared down at the dull blue carpet of his bedroom without seeing, forcing himself to take a step back from both his father and the anger he could feel welling up after years of suppression; he had to get control of this, of himself, it wasn't worth making the visit even more uncomfortable than it already promised to be. Taking a few moments to compose himself, inhaling a deep breath and folding his arms over his chest to lock it back up tight, he nodded briskly and licked his suddenly dry lips. "And that's it. That's done. I don't want to have this conversation whilst I'm here."
John's jaw stiffened. "Someone who'd quite like to speak with Sherlock. Is there a reason he's unavailable or...?"
The first thing that John sees upon entering the flat is that Sherlock is leaning over his music stand, a pencil grasped between the fingers of his right hand and his violin in his left; he's composing, composing when most people are settling into their beds and of course Sherlock wouldn't be sleeping now, of course he would be awake precisely when John needs him to be and is now glancing across the room and straightening his spine with that wonderfully arrogant chin-tilt as if to say:
"So if you spend as much time at Sherlock's house as Mycroft says you do then you must know Greg Lestrade?" Tim had his phone out in front of him suddenly, flicking through various screens until he'd pulled up a photo; he passed the phone to John, who found himself looking at a photograph of Greg, a girl quite a few years younger than him and two people who could only be his parents. "Good lad, Greg. Fantastic hockey player."
Quickly he typed back a response:
He started scrolling through the rest, eyes barely scanning the contents, deleting each one as he went – finally he went to delete one final email, the most recent, when suddenly his eyes caught the subject heading and he felt his stomach tense, though in frustration, anger or embarrassment he was completely unsure.
Wanda chuckled quietly ahead of John. John glanced at the back of her head before allowing himself to look at Sherlock again, still grinning. "Call me a name, then we'll be even."
Sherlock spoke as if John hadn't spoken. "So I came to you in the hope of a distraction, something to take my mind off of... it. Of course, I realise now that I was asking too much of you. You are, after all, so very -"
"Sherlock. You have to drink
"Mm." She tapped her fingers on the edge of the desk. He replicated the movement without realising it. "So, yet again, John is an anomaly."
Wanda stood up with a warm smile, edging her way out of the wooden bench and hurrying over to him with outstretched arms. "Gregory, dear, I'm so glad to see you arrived home safely! Are your parents with you?"
The two broke eye-contact.
"And now you're a part of that mess."
John doesn’t miss a thing. His eyes harden again and, with almost awe-inspiring authority, he takes a step forward and closes a rather large portion of the gap between them: Sherlock can feel, now, the body heat emanating from the smaller man and, within an instant, he feels the magnetic force between them flip - suddenly his chances of leaving the room have settled to
"I don't know what you mean."
Wanda nodded and stayed silent for a few moments, almost as if she were waiting for something; he wasn't an idiot, he knew what she was waiting for – for him to go into depth about how lucky he felt and why – but he was well aware that anything he said to her could be taken wrongly... or perhaps the real issue was that she'd take it exactly as he meant it. His head was a mess. The words he would no doubt say would cause him more confusion than he could bear at that moment, so he left her to wait it out.
"It means that she's noticed that something's going on between us and she's concerned. So she's giving us a chance to make nice by working together."
Or, so Greg seemed to think.
His parents hummed their agreement, a fond smile curving Wanda's lips. "Yes, he was always a little more affected by things than you were. Which is why I always felt that perhaps he might need the stability of a partner, someone to support him and keep him from sinking into his black moods."
Mr. Holmes ambled into the room, holding a newspaper and wearing a pair of glasses that were so odd to see on the face of a man that looked so much like his son that for a moment John could only stare; christ, he looked so much like Sherlock. In glasses. "Did you burn one of my shirts again?"
"Yeah," Harry agreed weakly, her voice suddenly sounding far away, "fuck."
"Yeah, trust me, you are. You
The glance that was shot his way was cutting; he had a feeling, though, that it was Sherlock’s own self-loathing that he was experiencing through this icy gaze rather than something directed towards him. “It’s unimportant. I was simply relating it to the case being discussed. I wouldn’t want you to -”
"William, you have no reason to care about me," John murmured quietly, his stomach twisting in discomfort at the intensity of the conversation, mind unable to grasp how it had come to this. "And I don't say that for you to pity me, I really don't, but you have no...
"On the contrary he seems to be the
“I dare you.”
John slowly pulled his t-shirt over his head and reached reluctantly for the crisp white shirt that Mrs. Holmes had ironed earlier that day.
him, not like that, though he was devastatingly aware of his fingertips against John's hot skin and knew that he liked it, knew that it was a good feeling and one that he wanted all to himself...
At that, both Sherlock and Lewis turned their backs on one another and began to walk in opposite directions, no further need to talk; John quickly took a few steps to catch up with his tall friend, keeping his mouth shut firmly until they reached the entrance to the alleyway once more before he finally allowed himself a moment to speak.
John raised his hand in protest. "I'm fine, Mum, just don't always have time to -"
John stared back at what he had written, re-reading it three times for good measure; yes, it certainly sounded that way, definitely seemed as if he'd subconsciously made his decision... as much as he hated to say it, William had made some frustratingly accurate points. John couldn't fail to recall that blinding moment of clarity that had buzzed through him during the first few moments after he'd let the laptop crash to the ground, nor how clear his mind had felt when he'd bashed his shoulder against the wardrobe (no need to tell William about
John needed to be quiet now. He had completely got the wrong idea. "John, I wasn't -"
All this emotion – all right, a single and negative emotion, but an emotion nonetheless – was like a drug, infiltrating his system and making him feel like he could do almost anything.
"I need to pick up a package from a friend."
There was a slightly altered indentation on the mattress as John seemed to twist his body slightly to face Sherlock properly, the timbre of his voice low and oddly shy. "Would you mind if I asked you to play for me again?"
John shook his head, head turning to glance around himself. "This is mad. You are
Jim glanced at him. "Though I'm sure you're trying."
“…and to tell you that I think he’s the most ignorant man I’ve ever met.”
Quickly he opened Sherlock’s message first, tapping to reply and hammering out a response as quickly as possible:
All at once, John's time with the Holmes family changed. They sat at dinner that Thursday evening with Sherlock no longer at the opposite side of the table but by his side (Wanda shooting them furtive looks over forkfuls of lasagne), gentle conversation amidst the sharp but undeniably funny banter between the two Holmes brothers making for the most enjoyable evening since John had arrived. He did not stop Sherlock as he leaned over to refill John's glass of wine, a light flush from the warmth of the alcohol spreading over his cheeks as he laughed and joked with Tim about university life and Wanda waxed lyrical about the (admittedly burnt) food that he and Sherlock had created together; by the time he'd finished his second glass the room was pleasantly furry, Mycroft's indignation and denial about dancing to Elvis dressed only in pearls made even funnier as Sherlock quietly crooned 'It's Now Or Never' to John's left, the small smirk on his full lips growing ever so slightly at the sound of his friend's tipsy giggles. He found it all too easy to turn to the dark-haired man and grin widely as Sherlock told them all a censored version of their ill-fated game of Ring of Fire, playing John as the villain just as much as Greg – Tim in particular was intrigued by the game, chuckling as he told Sherlock he was disappointed in him for not drinking brandy, Wanda whacking him lightly on the arm and telling him to stop being such a bad influence on their children.
"There's no need for an explanation, Gregory," Mycroft said, face impassive as he slammed his door shut and walked up to where the younger man stood, "I understand that you cannot be watching him at all times. I assume he didn't leave a note?"
Hollaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! Here's a chapter! ENJOY IT!
"HARRY!" He was shouting; he didn't care. He heard the moment of almost offended silence before she finally responded.
"My first? Oh..." The meaning sunk in; John cleared his throat, uncomfortable. "I don't really... is that really something you want to know?"
Slowly, painstakingly careful, John began to finally respond. The frustration had morphed, a veritable rage settling over him and flooding his entire body in heat as the words began to fall onto the screen.
“You say that, but the whole reason you’re here in the first place is because you wanted to be anywhere other than where I was.”
John said nothing.
John huffed a little more. "I'm not huffing."
"Good question. Hang on." There was a slight muffling sound, the gentle hum of a female murmur in the background. "Right, sorry. Katie was wondering who was dickish enough to text me this time of the morning."
"You could take John to Spinnaker Tower!" Wanda was now talking directly to Sherlock. "It'd be a beautiful view, especially later in the day..."
: apparently the silver lining today was that he didn't have time to um and ah and change his mind.
intrigued by you and I
to think about.
"No, but it's more than that, it's more than just being an intense friendship. He is... more important to me... than anyone. Anyone." He found that he could no longer look at Greg. The staircase suddenly became of great interest. "And I'm not saying it's romantic or it isn't because right now I just have no bloody idea
"Generated?"
"Do you want to know about my night?"
"Ah, there you are!" Wanda said brightly as he took a few steps into the room, still cracking what were
It was a mistake.
here for a reason," she said, suddenly sounding terribly fair, "but as you seem unwilling to discuss it at this point in time I would like to find something that you
"Can't think of any reason why not."
Greg walked slowly into the room, raising his hands to gesture above him. His eyes were questioning, not so much as curious as just completely and utterly bemused – and John was right with him. The last few minutes had seemed to fly by in a mess of confusion, drama and tension and John was so far beyond comprehension that he felt a very huge urge to storm up those stairs, crash through Sherlock's bedroom door and demand an explanation.
The words were dragged from him like molten fire. "You should have made me leave," he breathed against Sherlock's lips as his fingers reached up to tangle themselves into Sherlock's messy curls, "you should have physically forced me out."
The laugh that came from his phone was altogether different from the last, full of mirth. "Oh, dear heavens, Sherlock in bed with someone... let's not make too many jokes in one sitting, John, we don't want to wear ourselves out! But perhaps the former, that he's ill... yes, that's most the most likely choice."
"John. He's falling in love with you, mate."
"Is it always like this?"
Sharon was silent for a moment, the tension growing by the second; finally she cleared her throat, turning off the tap and setting down the last mug on the granite beside her. "Yes. I'm sure that's what it is."
Sherlock did not stop playing. His eyes glanced fleetingly, all too briefly to meet John’s gaze before returning to their hazy stare out of the misted window.
Sherlock's mouth opened as if to retort, finger pointing dramatically towards John, but rather than respond with what would have no doubt been something razor-sharp and good enough to cut straight to the bone he simply clamped his lips shut again and sat down heavily on the chair. For a few moments he sat there silently, staring at the table, John glaring down at Sherlock with a gradually receding self-righteous anger pounding through his ears and making him feel ever so slightly light-headed; neither of them spoke for a full minute, the seconds ticking past and making the tension grow and become stale.
"Yoooou looooove himmmmm," she sang down the phone, clearly in reams of delight, "you want to kissssss him in the raaaain... wait, what's that song?" She started to sing properly now. "I don't miiind spending every daaaay out on the corner in the pooouring raaaaain -"
"Yes, John," Sherlock interrupted with an audible sigh, turning and slipping his hands into his coat pockets, "that's fine. I will tell you."
"No."
This time when John awoke, still half-asleep and very close to being unconscious once more, he pulled his laptop towards him without needing the motivation of the usual 'bing' – this time he would talk first, speak the question that was flitting about at the edge of his barely-conscious mind still hazy from his dream.
"John, I'd like to introduce you to Lady Brooke Londonderry, the lady of the house. Brooke and I went to the same school," she explained lightly, the look in her eyes full of meaning – that is, telling him to shut up and not say a single word about what she'd said before entering the house. "A few years below me, if I remember correctly?"
Unfortunately, John was already rather drunk and therefore vulnerable to failure; taking this joyfully into account, Greg held the number two aloft triumphantly and pointed directly at him as he announced:
"I beg your pardon?"
His eyes instantly darted over to the armchair.
A brief, humourless smile fled across his lips and disappeared as quickly as it had come. “I'm talking to you now.”
"How do you even reason with yourself?" John refused to try and mask his anger, so matured as it was, and so quickly; his voice was too loud, far too loud when there were no doors and only archways for the sound to travel through. "How can you look me in the eye and tell me I'm the most ignorant man you've ever met and then go on to prove such
be better to focus on the violin violence…"
He did not look up at her, but he tilted his chin up slightly to indicate that he was listening.
This was insane. No one guessed right this many times without there being something more to it.
John's mind was racing. His stomach was attempting to leap straight up his oesophagus. "Wow, Sherl-"
Things, of course, would change during the next academic year. No longer would he wake up to the cup of tea; instead he would wake up in an actual bed, a bedroom within the same house as both Sherlock and Greg, a glorified cupboard if their descriptions were accurate. He could do whatever he wanted with the room too, none of the limitations of on-campus accommodation; not that there would be much space to play with. Greg had already hinted that he didn't have anywhere to put his bicycle and John had a horrible suspicion he'd have to live with it sitting in his bedroom for the whole year, but maybe he'd be able to convince Greg to be reasonable and to put it out in the garden. Speaking of which, it made absolutely no sense to him whatsoever that it hadn't been in the garden to begin with. Yes. Yes, that was what was going to happen. Bikes belonged outside and that was how it was going to go down.
Sherlock's eyes narrowed at the prolonged silence. “Stop analysing me. You know I hate it.”
Silence fell between them as Sherlock turned away from Mycroft, his arms falling back to his sides and his hands curling into tight fists as he begrudgingly attempted to do as his brother had suggested; he shut his eyes and allowed himself a deep inhale, breathing in the heat of the room and the scent of burning wood, repeating the action several times and slowly unfurling his fingers from their clenched position. He let the sound of crackling fill the whorl of his ear, the heat of the fire brush his skin and bring him back to the room and out of his head. After a full minute of this he finally began to deviate his body back to face Mycroft, eyes not quite so full, mind not quite so jumbled.
! This is like nothing he's ever experienced before -"
All in all, it was very nice – warm, absolutely warm, it was the only word John could think of to describe the whole setup and decoration.
"I quite understand," Sherlock interrupted and, yes, oddly enough there
"Please," Sherlock said stiffly, shaking his head, "you don't need to explain."
John obeyed, letting his muscles relax into the soft leather – ah, this leather, this was familiar too. He'd slept here before. Well Place. Sherlock's home.
John's jaw tightened. "William -"
hit you."
John was appalled. “No!”
As the driver came around to open his door for him (as if he needed assistance) the woman – Mrs. Holmes – began to hurry down the path towards him, all flapping hands, flowing sleeves and a genuinely warm, welcoming smile; her husband followed her, looking down at the path as he walked with a small, fond smile of his own, the expression clearly a response to his wife's enthusiasm. John had seen that smile before upon Sherlock's own face, funnily enough in response to his own thoughts of the very same woman. He knew before he'd even slipped out of the car and into her oncoming path that he would, whether he wanted to or not, love her.
Panic flooded his system. “You wouldn't -”
think about Sherlock.
"Just one more thing, Sherlock, one more thing I need you to do for me."
There were nine of them in all, nine young adults crammed around the kitchen table like sardines, each of them staring at the currently empty pint glass in the middle of the table as Greg spread out not one but
Once again Neil seemed to flinch. "Harriet's coming here? To see you?"
Sherlock looked down to his navy shirt and saw that Mycroft was indeed right; a streak of blood arced over his chest, though for the life of him he couldn’t think of where it had come from or a point where John’s hand had connected with his person. “I’ll have to throw this away.”
. Do that for me. Please."
to me."
"Just let me explain to you -"
She sniffed loudly in his ear. "Well, whatever is this for?"
"Fuck off." John threw a cushion at him, unable to stop himself from grinning, though it was most definitely an unwilling grin. "But fine, I'll shut up about it. I have to." He sighed, brought back to reality. "Blimey. I've got to figure this out."
"Don't listen to him, he hums up a storm when he thinks no one's listening."
"JOHN!" the man yelled, throwing his arm around John's shoulder – my, everyone was touchy-feely today – and squeezing him, shaking him, almost bouncing up and down in his evident (somewhat drunken) joy at seeing his best friend. "John, you jammy fucker, you made it! I never thought I'd see you tonight but you
to." He was deadly serious and he hoped that Sherlock could see that. His lips set in a grim line. "I'm not kidding around, Sherlock, I will
The voice continued. "You have wondered, directly to me, why in fact I chose you rather than rejecting you as I have every other student before now. It's natural for you to wonder this, and it is no secret to myself that I have perhaps wondered the same thing for myself on more than once occasion... it is not something I am used to. I am... not well-versed in what makes one person wish to communicate frequently with another."
OR not so clean-shaven in his youth:
Not to him.
is having sex in there."
"I'm not the type to go out of my way to say these sorts of things, and... it's important that you know that. It's important in the very least if, as I intend, our relationship is going to progress the way in which I think would benefit us both."
"The violin."
Eventually John realised there wasn't going to be an easy way to do this: he'd just have to bite the bullet and see what would happen. "Sherlock... we're okay, right?"
“Look, it doesn't matter. None of it, this, that, none of it. OK? It doesn't matter, because I'm getting help and Dad's in group and Harry... well, Harry's gay, and that's always been all right. And you...” He trailed off for a moment, desperately searching for something, yet another something, anything that could placate her and cancel out this whole damned situation. “You're my mum. Harry's mum. Dad's wife. You are who you are, and I... love you.” He stared at her, willing her to hear it, willing for it to somehow mean something. “I love you. I'm sorry.”
"You're going to make me say it. Right. Well." He took a deep breath. "Sherlock, I… care… about you. Too. I care about you too."
John knew where this was going.
So he slept. He slept through the missed lecture and seminar, slept through two missed calls from Mike, woke up once and saw the darkening sky and decided that he may as well sleep some more. When he had finally awoken properly at 3am, he laid in bed for a further hour, staring at the ceiling and wondering what form of illness this odd feeling would take – perhaps the flu. It would explain why his body was still tired despite excessive sleep and explain his lack of concentration. But he'd try to go to his seminar tomorrow, of that he was certain. He couldn't miss two days in a row.
This time Sherlock did nothing to suppress the small, private grin that curved the edges of his full lips. "Oh yes. My favourite part, I believe, was the clearly mocking way that you quoted 'services' to me. As if what I had to offer was of little consequence."
As he descended the stairs once more he found himself assaulted by the scent of cooking and the increased warmth of an attended kitchen the closer he got to the doorway; upon entering he found himself facing an empty room, all remnants of the food John had been preparing gone and the countertops glittering with recently dispersed water droplets where the man had obviously cleaned up after himself – the very image of it made his stomach coil and drop, though instead of finding himself feeling cold and distant he instead felt the trappings of warmth and comfort start to thread their way into his veins. He breathed in the smell of the well-seasoned beef stew – he refused to call it a bourguignon – and felt his muscles begin to relax at the frustrating simple contentment in what was to come in the near future: a home-cooked meal with his... John. And conversation. About what, he didn't know, but conversation nonetheless. John listening to him. Offering his opinions. Laughing at his ignorance. Telling him about his day. Domesticity.
John chewed frantically on a few more tubes of pasta. "What?"
to me."
And, just like that, silence falls. Movement ceases. The bow refrains from its drawing across strings, muscles tightening and fingers pausing, Sherlock’s chest rising and falling in the same steady rhythm even though he’s not entirely sure how, when his heart is suddenly emitting bass notes louder than the treble he’d been weaving through the air just seconds prior.
Never before had John had quite so much champagne, and never before had he known was it was to feel completely and utterly out of his depth.
Sherlock stopped dead, narrowing his eyes at the back of John's head. "No. That was not part of the deal."
"You have to admit -"
don't want to have." He stamped his feet nervously, glancing back at his companion. "Can we please just give up and go home?"
"Yes you are."
Tim was looking between his wife and John with warm eyes, though whether he'd seen their hug or not John was unsure. He began to wonder if perhaps he'd overstepped his mark when Tim spoke. "I don't know, she'll be filling out adoption forms soon if you're not careful, John!"
Sherlock glanced at John. "We can't do it, Greg. We're all
"Yeah, well, at least
He had never felt so under-qualified to be sitting at a table in all his life. "Er, no. No, I'm not even slightly musical -"
Greg shifted on his chair slightly, looking between them awkwardly. “Don't want to be a prick about it -”
The tall, older man pulled the door open completely, cold air flooding in. “Contrary to popular belief, I am not as unfeeling or unreasonable as either one of you might believe.”
Standing outside in the chilly night air and staring up at Greg's house, John wished he'd brought a coat.
John’s response was interrupted by yet another buzzing from within his pocket; he plucked the phone from his pocket and ignored Mycroft’s sigh, eyes scanning the message quickly:
"Go on."
what Mycroft cautioned me about, I should really consider listening to him once or twice a year -"
"Great, thanks Sherlock. Oh, right -" John could feel Greg's eyes move to his back, knew exactly what was now coming, " - Sherlock, this is my mate John from uni, one of Mike's friends -"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not quite what I meant, but regardless: try to think past it. Try to think clearly.”
John stood abruptly, sending a blanket and two cushions to the ground; Sherlock stood up straighter out of instinct, tilting his chin up as the shorter man stood directly opposite him. He could almost see his friend's eyes flash. Ah. The familiar, unpleasant tension. It was disturbingly welcome. "No. No, I'm not surprised." John's voice was low, as if he were struggling to keep quiet. "I know what you are, Sherlock, and it's hardly a shock to me when you turn into an edgy arsehole. What
John pulled his phone from his pocket, raising a finger to the still-shouting Mike and reading the text quickly:
John reads this, too.
He did not want to be a part of it.
"Not to worry, Gregory, he's not here for Sherlock. Or perhaps he is," Mycroft said, coming out of the living room and giving John a small smile, "but rather we need to sit down and have a little talk first." He gestured into the room he'd just left, standing so straight and tall that John had a fierce desire to look behind the man to see if there was a stick shoved up a certain orifice. "Shall we? You too, Gregory."
Pushing the sweatshirt unceremoniously off of the laptop and onto the floor, he sat on the edge of his desk chair and moved his mouse erratically, reawakening the screen and slowly lighting up until he could see the page in front of him.
John gritted his teeth and said nothing. Lewis reached out with his hands and began patting him down, eyes scanning his form searchingly until he finally stopped touching the now incredibly tense pre-med student, eyes lingering on the dark stain against his shirt.
"Have you been to a doctor?" John stepped over a pair of jeans he'd discarded on the floor earlier, sitting on the desk chair opposite Sherlock and taking in the man's appearance with a concerned frown. "You look terrible."
, why didn't you just come back outside?"
. It was with surprisingly steady hands that he reached out and took Sherlock's wrist gently within his grasp and pulled it towards him, shaking the antiseptic wipe free and letting the packet drop to the floor as he began to dab the cool, damp material against the wound. His eyes were now safely focused on the finger he so intently began attending to; rather than finding himself lost in an intense gaze he instead allowed his stare to travel over the lines and creases of the hand he now held within his own, knowing as he did that his mind was storing the information away and that at some point, be it later that evening or two minutes from now, he would revisit the memory of it and find himself infinitely lost at the reminder of the texture and warmth he was suddenly so determinedly concentrating on.
He could practically hear her pouting. "Fine, if you're not going to tell me… put him on the phone."
“Was there something you needed?”
me! I'm tired!"
John’s voice sounds far too similar to Sherlock’s own vulnerable timbre, and it squeezes deep inside of Sherlock’s chest to have such a tone so close to him. “Sherlock...?”
John felt his hands come up to frame his own face, clutching at it; his eyes widened in a sort of desperation, focused in a frozen depiction of bewildered unknowing upon Greg's face. "How?" It was almost a moan. "How am I supposed to know what to do?"
The sigh that was forced from Sherlock's throat was loud, exaggerated, too loud in the silence of the conservatory. “Am I going to take an overdose just because John isn't currently in my company? No, Mycroft. I'm quite certain that I don't need to explain that this is an entirely different situation to that which I was in two years ago, and the fact that I need to say it at all is detrimental to your own far greater intelligence. Perhaps you need to consider which of us is
is more than a little on Team Johnlock -"
Sherlock felt his brow crease, momentarily distracted. "Why would you assume I needed something from him?"
"Mike. Hi."
"Just need Tim to bring your suitcase – Tim! Tim, where's John's suitcase?"
He lied through his teeth, feeling no guilt whatsoever in doing so. "Like a baby - I think it's the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!"
"How many?"
any as of yet, and I don't want to disturb him whilst he's still unwell..."
"Sherlock, what -"
Mycroft smirked. "My parents, allies to the gay community since 2013."
They stayed still in the darkness for a few moments longer, John eventually regaining a somewhat steady heartbeat and and regulating his breathing back to normal; the buzz of the adrenaline continued though, his entire body seeming to shake from it. "Sherlock -"
The door opened, Greg's tired face peering round the corner.
Jim nodded. "And a martial artist, brilliant guy. Love his films." That small smile again. "He said, '
Sherlock shot him a sideways glance. "I don't smile a lot."
All at once her expression changed to one of absolute horror. "No! No, absolutely not! The opposite, the very opposite – oh, dear, I have gone about this quite the wrong way, haven't I?" She carried herself over to him slowly, taking her time to form the words before she let them loose into the air around him; she perched on the arm of the sofa he sat on, gathering her hands in her lap. "I should explain, John, that until now I was quite certain that Sherlock... and Mycroft..." her eyes flickered up to rest apologetically on her sons face, "...well. I thought that perhaps they weren't
"Your room is right at the end," he said in his classic monotone, not even looking at John as he spoke. "I'm sure you'll find everything you need already set out for you – towels and such."
Mycroft’s gaze was unwavering. “Well. I’m sure that was at least part of it.”
need you to turn around. Look at me.”
More rolled eyes – damn it, why was Greg so fucking casual about this? WHY?! "I dunno, it's not like I've really had time to think about it! The first question, really, is do you, y'know, think that maybe you might -"
I couldn't agree more. Perhaps I can't help you. It's painfully obvious that you're in no position to help yourself academically when you can't even accept what's wrong with you.
John rolled over onto his side. "Please, no details. Just... just go. Have fun. Don't tell me about it."
Wanda gave her youngest son what John could only describe as the biggest shit-eating grin he had ever seen and laid her hands on the pile of food in front of her. "Well, John told me what a marvel you two are in the kitchen, so I thought you could both give us the pleasure of your expertise tonight and make us something!"
William remained quiet; John took this as his show of patience.
"Come on," he said encouragingly, indicating that now Sherlock had to go ahead of him, "you can try a cup of pick and mix punch and chat to me and Greg. It doesn't have to be as painful as you're expecting it to be."
, more than just pointless, desperate pleas for Sherlock to
"What? Have I got something on my face?"
Sherlock slowly turned to his friend, a look of disgust curling at the edges of his features. "Please, John, my mother was only joking. They're probably filthy after all of the rain in the last few days, not to mention slippery."
The genius slid a card from the masses, dragging it with his fingertips to the edge of the table and flipping it over only as it threatened to fall into his lap. He stared at it for a moment before shrugging, turning it around so that the rest of the group could see. "Ten. What does that mean?"
"The self-diagnosed depressive pre-medical student.
Sherlock nodded. "Try not to take too long."
There was no time to think about it; he disregarded the comment and strolled down the stairs with a hand rising to smooth down his tie, eyes scanning the kitchen as he reached the bottom and seeing no one in there – he had started to head instinctively towards the living room when he heard a murmured voice coming from the conservatory, making him change his course and instead slowly approaching the room which was currently bathed in the beautiful golden glow of the early evening sun, the rich colour filtering out and into the dining room. Standing directly in the middle, his back to John, was undoubtedly Sherlock in the darkest of blacks, holding something out in front of him as he quietly spoke to himself and clearly unaware that he had company; John cleared his throat, starting to speak:
"I'm just teasing you," came the amused reassurance, the hand that had been very close to his leg shifting even closer still. "Well. Sort of. It
"Oh," Sherlock said airily, his shadow moving against the wall outside in the dark hallway only slightly lit by the crack of light coming from the room which the genius currently occupied, "round and about. Had to have a word with Lucas about tempo. Had a very interesting conversation with a Baroness about joining some sort of orchestra."
"Two months?" Katie sounded amused. Obviously
"Anything I say now, you have to understand that it is not meant to offend you. If I have to make up for every word I'm about to speak I will indeed attempt to do so, but…" Sherlock's teeth found his lower lip momentarily, hesitation evident. "I said that I'd had access to a picture of you, and that I had looked at it often."
No, he didn't want to lie down, he was too agitated for that. He pushed himself off of the bed, rocketing to the other side of the room as quickly as he could, letting his shoulder bash against the wardrobe as he passed. The pain was satisfying much as the crashing laptop had been, his lips twisting into an odd, ugly grin as the feel of it. He understood instantly why people let themselves fall into self-destructive habits, drug-use and self-harm and all the things that people grasped onto to survive whilst battling the big black dog that was depression. He felt like he was buzzing, felt almost alive for the first time in months and it was
with me after tonight, is he?"
"They haven't forgiven you for being an alcoholic at twenty-three, Harry, not because you're a lesbian."
John looked at her in surprise; was that true? Did Sherlock have a plus one? Was John it?
Sherlock pushed himself off of the tree and glanced down at him, grin slowly getting smaller until it was a simple tilt of his lips. "Yes you will. And it's sociopath, not psychopath. There's a very pronounced difference."
"Sure?"
"I understand perfectly well what you were saying, John, there's no need to explain."
And then there was the moment when John had moved his lips and the words had come out, sweet and warm against his jaw, so quiet he had to replay it over and over again to be sure.
Mycroft cleared his throat, nodding and cracking open the front door. “Yes, of course. My apologies for keeping you up so late, John. I very much appreciate you putting your opinions of me aside to come here tonight.”
What was even more concerning was that it didn't feel as if it were a weird sensation to have Sherlock so close and to actually enjoy it, the alcohol numbing his usual instincts to avoid all personal space invasions and instead inviting him to welcome it.
"I'm also assuming you're not altogether pleased, either."
As he waited for the elderly barman to pour his two lagers and a cider, his foot tapping idly on the wooden floor as his eyes circled the room, he felt a buzzing in his pocket; he slipped his hand into the confined space, inching his phone out into the open and quickly tapping through to read his text:
Mrs. Holmes stared at him in amazement. "I'm sorry, did you just say that my son has
"John."
Sherlock glanced away for a moment. "Sorry."
John looked between the housemates. "What?"
"Are you sure?" Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment, shaking his head. "It's all happening so fast, John, you might want to take a moment -"
Sherlock raised his eyebrow. "Which means...?"
John cleared his throat. “So.”
year of all years."
understand and to realise that it was never a case of not knowing and all just a simple desire to not allow things to change… but there was always change, and John was still waiting, John was still perched on the edge of his own admission and devastatingly sure that he would be left to collapse in the wake of it –
what to do. The lips on his were hard, insistent, the forte at the end of a crescendo that had stretched on for what felt like far too long; it was frightening, exhilarating and not unlike standing at the edge of a very tall building and waiting for the fall. He could feel the tremble of the hands that clutched at his damp shirt and he thought that maybe it was better that he wasn't the only one who was nervous – though nervous wasn't quite the word. His stomach was a mess of knotted tension, his body so taut that he couldn't even move to touch John,
Jim laughed. "It's not my personal e-mail address, John, it's all above board. We all have ways of working with the people who come to see us – my associates would tell you much the same thing – and some work better with different people. You obviously struggle with face-to-face contact and, even if your reasons for cutting this and the other sessions short are genuine, this is just an easier way for you to communicate with me. Smaller chunks, more often. Without having to tell me to my face." He leaned back in his chair. "Plus, y'know, we all have smartphones nowadays. Wherever you're heading, I'm sure it wouldn't take too much effort to type out a little e-mail every night."
Finally, Sherlock turned his eyes back to John's own face.
The look that flashed across Sherlock's pale eyes was odd; John couldn't quite identify it. It disappeared as quickly as it had come. "Quite right. Then did you at least find him acceptable to you as the means to an end of your depression?"
"Sherlock."
"Oh, well," Mycroft sighed, raising his hands to the heavens, "we mustn't let
that you'll find some way to avoid getting caught and it'll just be me getting arrested and charged with breaking and entering." He glanced back over his shoulder at Sherlock, watching the man's face twist into frustration. "Why don't we just come back when it's open?"
Sherlock's eyes narrowed slightly, almost as if he could hear John's thoughts; this did not stop the thoughts from continuing to shout, belligerent.
John's brow creased. "I already said, I don't mind either w-"
"You do."
Mycroft suddenly stood, ramrod straight and instantly with his back turned to both Greg and John; he faced the bay window, staring out at the empty and dark street whilst allowing John to sit stewing for an infuriatingly long time. It wasn't until Greg cleared his throat for the third time that Mycroft finally spoke.
"All right, your turn."
Greg was staring at him, agape. "Riiiight. And you're sticking with the whole 'we're just friends' thing?"
Sherlock's voice was slightly slurred in the darkness, seemingly more drunk than he had been during Ring of Fire; John supposed that the alcohol had finally caught up with him after drinking so much in such a short space of time. "Is that really what you were so desperate to ask me? I was under the impression that you had more to say, or at least that's what I assumed from all your fidgeting and huffing."
Please let me know what you think is better! :D
"So?"
He put the phone down on the bed and gently took his wrist back from Sherlock. "Thanks for bringing that in. Sorry I snapped at you."
understand.”
Sherlock's expression was mildly disgruntled. "Yes. Yes, I suppose it was. Fine." He turned towards John, looking so impossibly calm and not at all concerned at all about the part they'd have to play in the company of all of these people that John was momentarily stunned at his talent for acting. "I...
reason you are... communicating. With me."
He had forgotten about the nappy, oh
tension leads to him being crazy in love with you. And you don't know how you feel about it."
"I don't mind, but it might be safer if you don't try and wake me up at three in the morning again." John smiled slightly, wanting to be sure that Sherlock knew he was only kidding around. "Unless the house is on fire, of course."
Sherlock's lip curled slightly – apparently John's attempt to be inoffensive had been unsuccessful. "Your observational skills are, as ever, a credit to your intelligence. If you hadn't noticed, John, those are three traits that I tend to exhibit on a daily basis with or without the help of this infernal traffic and therefore your commenting upon them is completely unnecessary."
The words were exactly what he needed to hear and equally everything that he could not accept. "Last night, after things became too intense – and I won't discuss that, I can't, not now – I went to my brother and confessed… well. Everything. I embarrassed myself. Still, he was accepting. He didn't judge me." He hadn't even realised the importance of that before now. He sat quietly for a moment before continuing. "He wasn't surprised."
John couldn't help the smug grin. "Twins, actually."
"Sensitive," Tim offered, ignoring Mycroft. John had a feeling that's how they tended to deal with his snarkily edged comments. "He's always been more sensitive than you."
"Yes, quite right. Poor Sherlock."
The two of them glared at him in harmony; he flinched, stepping backwards into the hall.
it was doing. He gripped the laptop hard, ultimately determined to hold onto it as best as he could whilst it lasted. "You'd be surprised."
Sherlock frowned. “Am I what?”
Without further question, Sherlock had simply let his body fall to the side, eyes closing instantly; it didn’t look particularly comfortable but John wasn’t going to attempt to make him move now, not after so quickly winning a battle. As John stood to quietly cross the room to get a blanket from his wardrobe, Sherlock’s sleep-heavy voice floated across the space between them. “I warn you, I’m horrible when I first wake up.”
How did he always know?
What an odd way to phrase it. "Hurting himself? What, you think he's going to try and get some more heroin or something?"
Sherlock's eyes narrowed the tiniest bit. "And?"
“Hmmwhassat?” Sherlock’s voice mumbled sleepily through the darkness, still clearly at least half-unconscious; John looked at him for one moment more before he quietly made his way over to his bedroom door, sliding back the lock and pulling it open, the light from the hallway spilling in painfully bright – he squinted out at the two currently indiscernible shapes and forced his eyes to adjust.
“Did she say that to you?”
John couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes. “Like I said, we're not co-dependent. We're doing fine. It's no different to any other time we haven't been together.”
At the word 'depression', Sharon's mouth twisted into a grimace. “Oh, John. You're just exaggerating.”
John nodded, feeling a pity of unwelcome tension knotting like a ball in the pit of his stomach just at the possibility of having Sherlock come face-to-face with his family. “Yeah.”
He remained silent. He didn't know what to say.
"Mm. No, because, when you say you're fine..." John was slowly pushing himself off of the bed, looking at Sherlock with almost the ghost of a smile on his lips, "you tend to be lying. So. Yeah. If you're not fine, just tell me."
Sherlock was looking at him like he was a madman. "Your skills? You think that we're friends because of your skills?"
Fuck.
"Yeah, well, got a load of work to do and not enough time to do it," John pushed out with a laugh, shoving his hands deep into his jacket pocket and rocking back and forth on his heels; the movement calmed him a little. "You know what it's like, you remember your first year."
"JOHN WIIIIIIILL BE LOOO-OOO-OOOVED!" The two of them collapsed in manic giggles, leaving John at the other end of the line with a thumping headache, the weight of his verbal slip in his stomach and his brain in tatters – not to mention his eardrums.
important to me because I force myself to do something I don't feel like I can do."
"Stop harassing him, Wanda, and sit down next to John. At least this way they can at least see each other." Tim gave John what he clearly thought was a reassuring smile. "From what I've heard it's quite rare for these two to be out of each other's sight!"
The point was, however, that John didn't want to survive anything. He didn't want anything to end, nor change. The important part to him wasn't that they needed each other, though he would at least admit that this
The tiniest of smiles twitched on his lips. "Don't get on, then?"
The taller man took a few moments, a comfortable silence settling around them; a clock ticked from the dining room, marking the seconds until Sherlock finally spoke again. "Do you have any siblings?"
"Sherlock!" Greg held the card up so that it faced the unimpressed-looking genius. "You're new to this: take a drink!"
“Indeed,” Mycroft agreed, plucking a non-existent loose thread from his trousers, “but it still remains true that you've spoken to me about such matters before and, apparently, chose me above others. You had your reasons then, so I ask; can you not find them again? If it would... benefit you?”
"I'll bet she did," John mumbled, burying his face in his hands. "Christ alive. Thanks a lot, Sherlock, the gay rumours have finally come back to bite me on the arse."
John rolled his eyes (groaning at the nausea it inspired) and spat the white swirl of toothpaste out into the sink, swilling a mouthful of water and spitting that out too for good measure. Sherlock really was the most ignorant man on the planet, at least about real-life things. Though it was great that the man had no issue with people thinking he was gay, John himself was more than a little uncomfortable at the prospect of people considering him as such – not that he had anything against it, of course. His sister was gay, after all. He just… wasn’t. No point adding fuel to a rumour that had no truth.
Sherlock had smiled slightly, fleetingly. "Sentiment. It's not something I indulge in."
"All right. I'll come. But," he quickly said, raising a finger in the air, "only if you promise to stop acting like a child. And next time actually eat some of your dinner."
fun shopping trips with my mother -"
"I just think -"
"Neither do I," Harry admitted, a first – Harry always knew what to say, even if it wasn't particularly appropriate. "John... bloody hell, John."
too much these days, constantly overwhelmed with sudden waves of panic at what he had yet to process and understand, it's not as if he was suddenly at peace with feeling quite so much in concentrated bursts, and quite so little in the moments when his mental health restored its power over him, but he was adapting. He was becoming accustomed to it. This place, this house, this family... barring Harry, at least... it was like returning to a cell after a few months in a sprawling villa.
"Ordinary?" Sherlock felt a strange trickle of something cold and uncomfortable down his spine, something he hadn't felt before. He had no word for it. "Decent? Friendly?" The word brought back a renewed bitterness towards John's counsellor. "Would you like me to smile more? Y'know, I could be intense too, I know how much you like that, but maybe I should crack a few jokes too?" His mind threw a curve-ball, reminding him of John's injured hand and the fist it was currently curled into; he started to step towards John, not thinking of how it would be construed during such a moment. "Tell me, John, tell me what you'd like me to be so that I can at least know how much of a disappointment I'll be to you when I fail to do all of those things, I'm
"I don't -" Sherlock broke off, understanding dawning on his face; it quickly turned to something far darker, something John couldn't quite define. "No. No, I'm dealing with it my way. Don't interfere."
"You can't just -"
"I know how to act of course, it's all easy enough to pick up on simply from watching people – like animals at the zoo." His expression had been completely serious, not seeing a single thing wrong with his analysis. "I could walk up to any single person outside and talk to them without batting an eyelid, it's not a difficult task and one I've undertaken on occasion when it's absolutely necessary to have to do so. It's as easy as anything else."
A male voice, one he didn't recognise. He brought his phone away from his face, staring at it in confusion.
"Hello, John."
Sherlock laughed quietly, breath warm and full over John's skin. "
Sherlock nodded and motioned towards the open space of darkness in front of them. "Can we continue?"
Amusement flitted across Wi...Sherlock's features. "A time-share in Dubai?"
He batted the word away with a sweep of his hand, frustration swelling within the bitterness of his churning stomach and climbing the heat of his ribs to settle uneasily in the depths of his chest – he felt the familiar etchings of mania start to glow amidst his thoughts and flood his senses, threatening loss of control.
"Right. Yeah. On the down low. So you're just super-special best friends."
So. Sentiment was coming. He forces himself not to turn and face it head on. The adrenaline may think it knew best, but he was slowly learning to trust other instincts. Like the one that told him he wasn’t quite ready to face John.
The interior of the house was, without a doubt, the most breathtaking setting he had ever laid eyes on – in pictures, in real life, even in the entire breadth of his imagination he had never been so completely overwhelmed with the richness and illustriousness of his surroundings quite like he was at that moment. He had walked awkwardly behind Wanda, Tim and Mycroft through an entrance hall unlike anything he had ever seen before, crystalline marble floors and delicate crystal chandeliers, a decadent double staircase covered in a deep red carpet that looked so thick that John felt relatively confident that if he were to jump on it he'd probably bounce back up by at
"Just
It took a little longer for the dullness to come back this time.
John frowned, staring at the screen as he began to shake his head. "No, look... you're not my counsellor, all right? Friend is fine, therapist is not."
Sherlock's eyes found his once more, his smile lessening until it was gone completely; John watched as it died, his own fading until they were simply gazing at each other in the dim light from the hallway with seemingly nothing more to say and yet a whole web of words stretching out between them. His mind flickered briefly over the possibility of it
and the name directly under it – he unlocked his phone and brought it close to his face, eyes scanning the few words feverishly.
The man without a solid name shrugged casually, holding his wine up to his lips but not drinking. "Friends and family call me Sherlock."
Forgot to send the original draft of this chapter home from work, so had to rewrite this evening - went in a totally different direction to what I was planning!! ANYHOO, hope you enjoy it! :D R&R, my lovelies!
John’s hand skated across the distance, eyes focused completely on Sherlock’s as he reached up and dragged warm fingertips over the curve of Sherlock’s throat. “Chaos.”
Shrugging again and plucking a lighter from his pocket, Sherlock began to click the flame to life in full view of the whole restaurant. John leaned over quickly and grabbed it from his fingers, slipping it in the top of his shirt pocket and narrowing his eyes; Sherlock reacted as expected, throwing himself back onto his chair and folding his arms tightly over his chest.
“Yes!” John exploded, eyes wide, throwing his hands up in the air as a stupidly big smile spread over his face. “I mean – well, no, not really, but at the same time, yes! Yes, it’s… I thought you were twenty-six!”
get the better of me. I'm sorry for that."
the curiosity about where my feelings are and instead focuses on where
A tight smile cracked on Mycroft's lips. "I think that would lead to more harm than help, don't you? If he's looking for it elsewhere he'll have his ears to the ground, contacts to warn him of people asking after him. He's far too...
being the more obtuse, here, rather than throwing questions at me which you already know the answer to.”
“Quite.” Sherlock allowed the point, though did not explain his willing reticence. “It just appears to me that perhaps it would be less of an emotional uproar for you if you were to go alone rather than be accompanied by me – or anyone else, for that matter, though mostly me.” John separated his lips to interrupt but was not given a chance; Sherlock raised a finger in the air and briefly shook his head. “No, John, allow me to finish. I genuinely believe that the idea of me coming with you is causing you more stress and undue concern than if you were to visit your family by yourself. You’ve clearly spent most of the day worrying over this issue to such an extent that now you can think of nothing else, and I will allow you the acquiescence of saying that you’re probably right to have been so uncertain. I cannot simply turn off my gift for observation and you’re quite right when you assume that I will – no matter how hard I might try – form one judgement or another about both your family and the life in which you experienced before you came to university. What you’re concerned about, of course, is that the judgement that I’ll make is one that will be unavoidably insulting and that I will – as I tend to do – make that judgement perfectly clear to both you and your family.”
A pause. "I'm afraid he's not available to come to the phone at the moment."
"I'll give it a miss, Greg. Think I'm gonna head off soon."
Greg appeared to be mulling this over; Sherlock was staring at John in disgust.
"Yes. And Mum. And I assume you, too, if she even expects you to be here."
"What?"
want to know. No offence, John, you're a nice guy," he added, putting his hand out in a 'stop' gesture, "but I wouldn't want to imagine Sherlock shagging a fit woman let alone you or any other bloke."
“I’ll take that as your acquiescence. I wouldn’t have thought it would ever be an issue, but I genuinely believe that were you older and less highly strung than you are currently - thanks to the mass of hormones pulsing through your adolescent body – you would not be quite so dramatic about all of this. You have to push it aside, Sherlock. You have to do as you’ve always done and realise that you are better than your biological urges.”
