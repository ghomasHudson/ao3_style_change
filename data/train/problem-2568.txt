Sherlock leaned down, slowly sliding his tongue against John's as he rubbed the cloth down his neck to his shoulders and chest. "You're strong," he breathed, breaking away. "You can incapacitate a kidnapper in seconds." He nudged his erection against John's hip.
Wagging his eyebrows a bit, John said, "Oh, exactly the opposite. My mouth seems to make people forget all sorts of things, including why they're mad at me. Quite useful for getting out of trouble, this mouth."
Molly leaned her head against the warm hand that was cradling it. "Hi, John."
"I'll stop." John pulled back to glare at him expectantly. "...immediately."
John had never really considered putting the words "Sherlock" and "dance" in the same sentence before. Certainly he was athletic, and he had a certain poise, even in repose, that suggested he could be quite graceful. But it came as a shock to find out that somewhere along the line, Sherlock had decided that dancing was not too frivolous a pursuit to spend his time on.
He fucked into her in earnest, then. A sick feeling swooped through Molly's belly that was some combination of heat and shame, and it was intoxicating. "God, your dick is so big," she moaned as she wrapped a leg around him.
in the back of a taxi. Sherlock broke off first, breathing raggedly as he kissed across John's jaw to nibble at his ear. John chuckled, squirming, and was rewarded with a soft huff of laughter and a gravelly murmur.
"Fucking hell," John swore reverently as Sherlock kissed his way up his body again. "That was ..."
“I do,” Sherlock insisted, immediately. His body was taut, and he laid statue still. His face warred with itself for a moment before he took a breath and plunged forward. “I’ve always wanted to try.”
Greg was moaning lightly now. "Jesus, Sherlock, feels fucking amazing." He gripped Sherlock's hair and thrust down his throat once, only to have his hand dragged away and pinned to the bed.
After a few minutes, Sherlock turned into a particularly mournful note and stopped mid-downstroke. "I didn't hear you come in."
John kissed her head sadly. "You're an idiot. Go to sleep."
Sherlock rolled onto his back, considering at the ceiling. "The data was compromised." John thought about this for a long moment but turned to him in confusion. Sherlock spoke quietly. "I'd had sex approximately an hour before, with his dealer." He stared determinedly at the ceiling, cheeks flushed as shame washed over him. John filled in the blanks about how they'd acquired the drugs and it occurred to him that the man must've known Sherlock had been cash-strapped. Next, it occurred to him that Sherlock would have been perfectly capable of coming to the same conclusion had he wanted to think about it. He decided to end the line of questioning.
“Stop deducing me,” John ordered, the sharpness of the words softened by the breathiness of his voice. He reached down, pinching Sherlock’s nipple for a moment. “It’s distracting.” He finally slid fully onto Sherlock’s erection, resting there for a moment before rocking his pelvis to set a slow rhythm.
His smile cracked wide open and Molly nodded at him as if to remind him that it was his turn to flirt. He took it. "Hmm. I'll hope you were laughing at an ex-boyfriend's expense, I think."
Sherlock nodded his head at Vincent in acknowledgement. "I researched you, naturally. I research all my clients. So I have read the articles and that gave me some of the information; the rest I got from observing you." Hating himself for it, he colored his voice with a touch of incredulity. "You believe my colleague, a decorated Army veteran and a doctor, viciously attacked you 15 years ago because of your sexuality."
“Do it.”
Sherlock's brain fired back online, and he realized that John had faked an orgasm.
His face was red, and Molly felt her own face warming, too. Good. She hadn't been in control that night, but she was in control now, and she intended to hold him accountable for the way he had humiliated her.
Running his fingers through his curls in frustration, Sherlock shrugged. "There's not much to tell. I blacked out, and I shouldn't have. I woke up 12 hours later and the man I'd been with was gone. I always wondered what happened while I was out. Perhaps he just intended to rob me. If so, I'm sure he was disappointed; I didn't have anything of value on me."
Sherlock chuckled, but obliged, stepping out of the legs of his trousers and into John’s space. He was rewarded with a squeeze to his bum and another long, searching kiss. He pulled John backward, toward his bed, stalling when John took a half-step back in order to slide his hand from Sherlock’s hip to the front of his pants. They both moaned when John squeezed his growing erection, then chuckled.
Molly mentally shook herself. That was stupid. No one could look at someone’s face and tell if she’d been raped. Well, no one except Sherlock. All the same, she spent more time than normal applying and adjusting her makeup, which Sherlock had brought from her flat when he and John went to investigate.
Sherlock hummed, feeling a different sort of tension stirring in his belly. John smiled against his mouth, tracing Sherlock’s lips slowly before nipping his lower lip and sucking it for the briefest of moments. Sherlock wondered for a moment if John was perhaps as nervous as he was and was stalling for time, but no; he simply took pride in being a good kisser and enjoyed seeing how worked up he could get Sherlock without putting a hand on him.
. He looked up at John's flushed face and heavy-lidded eyes, and dug the heel of his hand into his own aching cock to relieve the pressure.
It took less than 2 seconds for John to mentally fill in the blanks. “So … you’ve never topped?” His voice was level, his manner casual.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's too-thin waist, running his hands soothingly up his back. "It's OK, love. We had a fight, but we're OK." He lifted his face to brush gentle lips against Sherlock's before running a hand up his spine to pull his head closer. John slid a soft tongue in and licked gently against Sherlock's mouth, caressing every part of it. Sherlock tilted his head slightly to change the angle, deepening the kiss, and their tongues tangled, the kiss quickly becoming frantic. John clutched Sherlock tighter, swirling his tongue against him, determined not to break away first. Finally, Sherlock pulled back for a gasp, and John pressed soft kisses to his long neck. Sherlock shifted his weight, pressing their hips closer together, and they both chuckled. John pulled back then, reluctantly, and glanced down at their burgeoning erections. "We should probably stop."
John laughed in spite of himself. "It's a burden, honestly."
"Flatmates," Vincent shot back.
Was John preoccupied? Troubled? Had there been bad news, or a nightmare, or a flashback, and Sherlock had missed it? He thought not, but he checked John's emails, blog, and social media accounts to be sure. Nothing. Suspiciously little, actually; he'd liked a few pictures on Instagram last week, and had responded to a few Facebook posts he'd been tagged in, but had otherwise been as quiet online as in person. He was drinking a bit more than normal, but nothing concerning. He wasn't limping, hadn't touched his gun, wasn't showing signs of fear or anxiety. Sherlock was hard-pressed to identify any particular emotional state, actually. John was simply
The muscle-bound man slid his hip against the bar next to John. "Can I buy you another drink, hon, or do you have your heart set on Sherlock tonight?"
Molly considered that for a few moments. “That’s would fit,” she admitted. She knocked back her whisky, and washed the glass in the sink. Nodding her goodnight to the boys, she climbed the stairs wearily and collapsed into bed without undressing.
Sherlock smiled and turned out the lamp. They rolled over and curled up, breathing in Greg's scent on the sheets and falling into a loose-limbed sleep.
John stayed, of course. He still bought the milk, and made the tea, and they tiptoed around each other, each trying to find new boundaries.
Molly didn't have the patience for the complicated tangle of half truths that answering this question usually required. "I'm a pilot!" She shouted back.
He wasn't omniscient, not quite, but he knew them all so well at this point, could read their signals so precisely, but he may as well have been. He knew that he and Sally were the only ones comfortable providing Molly with the licks of pain she craved. Knew that Molly preferred Greg for her mouth and that she liked watching John and Sally together. Dozens and dozens of unspoken truths, that he orchestrated into a cacophony of bliss.
Sherlock leaned in. “Finish,” he demanded. “I want to hear you say it.”
!”  John rounded his lower back, attempting to hurry Sherlock’s thrusts, but Sherlock wasn’t having it.
But John's cock was thickening rapidly in Sherlock's hand and he stroked it just as he'd stroked John's back, with long, sure movements, until he was fully hard. Then he let go, leaning forward to give John a deep, long kiss, and rolled his hips to rub their cocks together. "I missed you," he whispered in John's ear before dropping down to kiss at his neck. It was true; Sherlock hadn't realized how lonely and touch-starved he'd been.
(See the end of the chapter for
There it was. Illogical and sentimental, but the truth. John understood Sherlock. Working with him was comfortable, and beneficial, and what he liked. He could walk away, go back to doing the work with his skull for a sounding board, but it would be a loss. Things wouldn't be the same, but they could still
Sherlock listened to John's steady, deep breathing, felt his heavy, still weight against him. "I think I love you," he whispered.
John smiled fondly. "It happens during fights sometimes. It's OK."
Sherlock looked at the screen for a few moments, and synchronized a loud car crash with pulling down John's zipper. He slipped a hand inside and stroked him. "Think anyone would notice this?"
. John's don't-fuck-with-me voice was arousing enough without his tongue's help. He turned to catch John's lips with his own, and they kissed for a brief moment, but John pulled away and gave him a
A few seconds later, Molly frowned in concentration. "It's so hard to think. I guess I'll report it. That way I don't have to rehash it a second time."
"At least. Seven just off the top of my head. And then some of those are mutual, where others will require reciprocation of the same or a different act. And then sometimes multiple methods can be applied to one person simultaneously, as we saw with you. So really, off the top of my head, there are ..." He thought a moment. "I'll have to make a spreadsheet and test your flexibility to give you a final number."
? I'm not the one who pawed at a stripper tonight."
Sherlock stilled for a moment, not breathing, and turned slowly to face him. His voice dropped. “You bloody well know why it matters to me. Why it’s personally relevant.” They had never discussed it openly, but John knew, and Sherlock knew he knew. Thought he hadn’t cared. Thought …
John swallowed. "Your mouth."
“—Anderson, you babbling idiot,
John moaned in frustration when Sherlock paused his hips, waiting for an answer. “Just get on with it, you berk.” He was rewarded with a firm thrust that rubbed in just the right way. “God, yes. Harder.” He snaked a hand between them, and Sherlock curved his spine, creating room for John to grasp himself. John hummed his appreciation, and then the whole world exploded into a flurry of sensation as Sherlock finally drove into him, fucking him hard enough that the headboard clattered against the wall. He slowed for a moment, until John growled, “Don’t you dare,” and Sherlock resumed his punishing rhythm.
“You mentioned once that your mother was born in Galway. Your grandfather used to sing it?”
you police?” he demanded.
Sherlock banished all trace of self-pity from his voice when he replied. "Better than a recovering junkie." John's smiled sadly, seeming to take a moment to formulate his reply, but Sherlock interrupted his thinking. "Why does it bother
"Stop staring and come all th'way in," Sherlock murmured with a loose, warm voice.
John frowned. "That's irrelevant. Drinking with someone is not consent."
They looked at each other, eyebrows raised, and Steve laughed. "I think I'll leave you two to it, then."
Suddenly, John felt wet heat lapping at his entrance. "Oh, Christ. Holy fuck, Sherlock!" After that, Sherlock's tongue swirled and lapped and probed John into such a state that words were impossible; all he could do was groan incoherently and try to fuck Sherlock's tongue. Sherlock felt himself growing painfully hard, even leaking a bit, and knew if they didn’t move things along he was not going to make it. Sherlock wanted John to come, desperately wanted him to come, but he wanted them to take their time. He was anxious to get inside of him, to feel John's walls around his cock and to watch him crumble beneath him. And so even as  John's balls grew tight, and his cock started to twitch, Sherlock released him, kissing his back while John whined pitifully.
"Too easy," John murmured. "I can do that one automatically."
-----------------
Sherlock nipped at John's lips. "Only if you're going to make a fuss about it. You know I love you, you idiot."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Oh yes," he drawled. "It sounds like he was a real gentleman."
A few days later, Sherlock came home from a case to find a kettle of tea already steeping, apples and bananas in the fruit basket, and John's laptop on the table by the window. His stomach clenched, but he only hesitated for a moment before he strode in the door. After pouring himself a cup of tea, he sat down in front of John's laptop, smirked at the updated password (
Sherlock considered this for a moment. "Define sex."
John didn't turn away. Sherlock was squeezing her tits again, then running his fingers down to play at the straps of her thong. "He's good at that." Kylie let her hair fall like a curtain around their faces, and John's throat went dry again, his imagination unable to settle on whether it would rather picture being Kylie, drawing Sherlock's hungry eyes and predatory arse squeezing, or Sherlock, allowed to be a bit handsy with a gorgeous stripper. It was hot as hell either way. Chris cleared his throat behind him and John remembered that he was supposed to be drinking and flirting. Knocking back the rest of his drink, he spun back to face his mark. "Sorry," he said with a rueful smile. "I'm being nearly as rude as him."
, John’s mouth dropping open and choking out a surprised, aroused cry. “Mmm, you like that,” he said, returning to his slow, gentle rhythm for 7 more hip rolls before fucking hard into him twice.
Sally nodded. "Yeah, out drinking like a fish and wound up alone with someone I recognized from a class. God, I was stupid. He talked me into going to his room to play Grand Theft Auto, and then decided to get a leg over. Took a picture of me crying while he was fucking my mouth. It was a shite picture, but he had fun showing it around. Said my eyes were watering because I kept gagging."
Sherlock waved this off, gesturing at John's barely-flagging erection. "You were very enthusiastic about it." John glared at his penis as though it had betrayed him and scrambled to pull on a pair of sweatpants. Sherlock smirked. "Besides, you've been wanting to have sex with me for days. You keep thinking about initiating something and then changing your mind."
. Fearless.
Sherlock waved this off, but John looked between Sally and Molly curiously. He let it pass, though, and simply listened as Molly promised to be more aware of her surroundings than normal.
The next 24 hours passed predictably, with John apologizing to colleagues when Sherlock verbally abused them, attempting to keep the genius confined to his bed with moderate success, and keeping an eagle eye on the morphine pump that Sherlock kept convincing the nurses he still needed. Finally, John and Dr. Kent agreed that Sherlock, and the other patients, would rest better when he home.
Sherlock shook his head. “The large one is mostly anesthetic. Slightly increased sensitivity for the rest of my back. No motor interference.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John shook his head. “But what if it had been serious? What if we’d been closer to the blast and those minutes would have made the difference?”
Molly laughed out loud. "Sherlock
John looked down and, sure enough, Greg was hard again. Sherlock reached around him, swatting away Greg's hand to wrap his long fingers around both of them. John fumbled in the bedside table, retrieving the lube blindly and drizzling some over them. The lube was cold for a shocking second and then
Beside her, Sally was moaning encouragement and rocking up into Sherlock's mouth. All of a sudden, she jerked and hissed. "Fuuuuuck, freak, just like that. Oh my God, just a little --" She broke off and less than a minute later, she went stiff and cried out as waves of pleasure rolled through her. "Oh, shit," she panted. "That was incredible. You really are a bloody genius."
“Good day, gentlemen,” Sherlock said firmly, then more quietly, “Come, John.” He tugged on his elbow and walked as quickly as possible back to the street. “Poison!” he shouted over his shoulder at Lestrade as a taxi pulled up to them. “Don’t know how, yet. Will get the details to you soon.” He shoved John inside and ducked in after him before anyone had time to respond. He could see Lestrade gesturing wildly at them as the car pulled away, and he sighed with relief.
J“I’m a fucking idiot, Sherlock, I’m sorry. If I’d thought for a few seconds instead of spouting off the first thing that came into my head, I would’ve realized and not brought it up. All those guys are arseholes, and you are amazing and deserved better.”
“Don’t be stupid, Molly. It’s just a shirt. It was going to the dry cleaners tomorrow regardless.” She flung the tissue back on the pile and released the first two buttons before Sherlock’s hands closed over hers. “Stop. This is hardly the worst this shirt has ever seen. Besides, John will be home momentarily and I’d rather he not walk in to you undressing me, given our history.”
As if on cue, her door opened with a swift knock and her nurse entered, bearing a cup of cafeteria coffee. Not what she had meant by a drink, but beggars can't be choosers. "You are an angel from heaven," Molly said reverently, reaching out for the warm cup.
(See the end of the chapter for
John giggled, shrugging, and gasped a bit at the cold when Sherlock squeezed lotion onto his thighs. Sherlock settled gently on top of him, pressing in for a languid kiss as he reached between them to line up, and pushed between John's thighs. He rocked gently, reaching up to cradle John's face as he explored his mouth. It was nice, not having to bend to accommodate their height difference.
Molly laughed. "Hardly. I share a flat with a gay couple." His posture relaxed. "Less debauchery than I expected," she mused. "They are either very quiet or very chaste."
so much?"
Just as Mark turned to leave, Molly finally found her courage. "I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier. I don't know what came over me."
"You haven't ...?"
John noticed, and his eyes widened. He pounced on Sherlock, toppling them both to the floor and biting at the long, creamy expanse of neck under him. "You will not go unsatisfied tonight," John growled. He rubbed his cock against the bulge in Sherlock's pants and they both moaned. "By the time I'm done with you, you'll be begging to come."
His sweet smile turned mischievous. "All the best nights of my life have started with those words," he chuckled. Just then, bartender approach them and caramel voice ordered two shots of Pitron.
Throwing a glance over his shoulder, Sherlock slowed. “Perhaps you prefer to be the penetrating partner, then? I hadn’t observed your appreciation before or I would have suggested it.”
John's thought stuttered as Sherlock rolled his nipples in time with a swirl of his tongue. "Better. Is it ... it's 11, right? Yeah, 11."
Sherlock reached for the shots and handed one to John. "Don't be absurd, John. I don't have friends. I've just got one." He smiled softly, shifting his weight to one hip and relaxing his shoulders.
Molly's thong was ripped away from her body and her legs were lifted. Sally nudged her clit in her mouth and Molly sucked. "Do you want to know who's fucking you?" Molly shrugged a shoulder as a cock pushed into her. "Good. You're a right little slut, aren't you? You'll let anyone fuck you." Whoever was fucking her set a rhythm, but it wasn't enough. "Maybe next time we can just blindfold you and strip you and drape you over a table out in the lobby with a sign that says 'Free Fucks'. Would you like that?" Molly groaned into Sally's lap. Whoever was fucking her -- she suspected it was Greg -- seemed to like it, too. His strokes came a little faster and harder, finally. "The next day you'd get in the lift and not know who you'd fucked or who'd watched."
John repeated the motion and Sherlock relaxed into it as John crooned at him reverently. "You magnificent creature, does that feel good? Do you want more? That's it, darling, I've got you. I'm going to fill you up soon, would you like that?" He added his fourth finger and Sherlock hardly noticed the stretch. "I can't wait to see you all wrapped around me, to stuff you until you're full." He twisted his fingers and Sherlock pulled at his own hair, panting desperately. "I know sweetheart. When you come, it's going to be spectacular. You're ready?"
Before she walked in, Molly unfastened the top three buttons of her shirt, so that the edge of her bra peeked out. She silenced her phone and walked into the club.
John did a double take. "You've been holding out on me for
When she went downstairs, Sherlock was shoving a test tube into a centrifuge with all the manic energy of someone who hadn’t slept in two days and John was staring blearily at the dripping coffee maker. He grunted in a way that might have been a greeting, and Molly smiled, nodding at him slightly. Finally, the last few drops sputtered into the pot and John hummed gratefully as he poured cups for himself and Molly.
Sherlock released the breath he'd been holding, visibly relaxing, and shrugged. "They had drugs I wanted, so we made arrangements."
"Find out for yourself," John said, smirking.
Sherlock washed himself efficiently and wet a flannel for John. When he went back to the bedroom, he found John waiting with a bottle of paracetamol, a glass of water, and an ice pack. Rolling his eyes, he swallowed three of the pills and drained the water before stuffing the ice pack under him as he crawled back in the bed.
John threaded his fingers through Sherlock’s, squeezing lightly. “Is what we’ve been doing up until now been too…
John knew this was a fair point but he was so certain that Sherlock was
Molly frowned. "But I wasn't in danger." She trusted John, knew he was good. "You wouldn't hurt me."
John tipped his head, surprised at the venom. "I meant every word."
John's weight dipped the bed between his legs. "What are you thinking about?"
John huffed out a half-laugh. "It
This was literally true. Just 2 weeks prior, Sherlock spent a full hour worshiping John's neck as he blindly explored his chest, nipples, belly, and hips before bringing him off with a leisurely hand job. Anderson commented on the dark bruises at a crime scene two days later, asking about John's new girlfriend. Sherlock had practically preened when John corrected him, then looked mildly disappointed  when Donovan and Lestrade commented that it had been obvious for the past month.
been romantic between them, although they had explored their feelings (and bodies) ages ago, before Sherlock met John. It had been fun, and sweet, and clarifying. They loved each other, they discovered. That didn’t change the fact that Sherlock’s need for danger and adrenaline was incompatible with Molly’s need for stability. Add to that Sherlock’s strong, if not exclusive, preference for men, and they’d realized within two weeks that they were nothing more or less than dear friends, and both considered the experiment a raging success. Molly was jealous when Sherlock and John met, and at first that worried her. She had never felt a moment’s regret over their friendship, or the slightest bit of jealousy over Sherlock’s previous dates, but when John first entered the picture and she saw how much he and Sherlock meant to each other, envy temporarily consumed her. She eventually confided in Greg, who responded with a laugh. “I don’t want either one of them, but I want what they have. Googly eyes and all. Just, y’know, with someone else.”
Sherlock peeked at him through dark lashes. "Mm, quite."
Sherlock had a breakthrough. Her attacker had said "cell phone" and written "color" and "favor" in messages to the other victim. Given that, Sherlock had done searches on various dating sites using several bits of American phrasing and found someone who might be him.
Molly pulled her hair back into a ponytail, slid on her shoes, and patted the doorway fondly on her way out.
"Imprecise," Sherlock muttered, turning his eyes back toward the book. "It's your choice, but moving out is illogical." He paused for a moment and John quirked a questioning eyebrow at him. "It's an ideal arrangement."
Sherlock canted his head, brow furrowed. "But, if you can't practice medicine --"
Everything was slick from the soap, and Sherlock's muscular thighs were impossibly tight, maybe even tighter than a woman. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, sank forward again, and moaned lightly into his mouth. "Why does this feel so good?" he asked breathily between kisses. Sherlock chuckled, shrugging and rocking his hips gently in response.
Sherlock looked at John again. "I think when you do try bottoming you will see that it's merely one more way for people to make each other feel good. And sure, eventually I would like to be able to do that with you, but there are LOADS of things I would like to do with you that we haven't done yet. Don't overinflate the importance of this one specific sex act."
John settled in to play, licking the inside of his cheeks and scraping his teeth lightly over the wet skin. He kissed and licked Sherlock's perineum, then moved on, slowly circling closer to his opening. Sherlock was working Greg's cock in earnest, who kep breaking away from Sherlock's cock to pant and whimper.
Sherlock sniffed. "You prefer when I let you tell me yourself. I've no idea why, but as you put up with so many of my idiosyncrasies I can hardly complain."
"Oy! I'm right here, you git."
"I guessed."
"I had designs on you before I felt the condition of your shoulder." Sherlock stood, crossing to the kitchen to pull coconut oil out of a cupboard before returning. He scooped some out of the jar and rubbed it between his hands, then continued his work on John's bad shoulder. "Why didn't you tell me?" John shrugged his good shoulder in response. For ten minutes, they sat in silence aside from the hissing and sighing and sharp breaths from John as Sherlock beat his shoulder into submission.
John laughed. "While you were up there playing MacGuyver, I let Lestrade know we were stuck in here, got an update on how long until we'd get out, attempted to get videos or photos for you to analyze, and let Molly know to text us the results of the blood samples as soon as she got them. Knowing when to fold is not disrespect for The Work." He glanced up at the video camera. "Reckon that thing is working? Maybe you're right that this isn't the time."
"Sherlock?"
Molly looked him over, debating whether to answer. He was cute. Scruffy shadow on his face and short dreads spiking around his head. He had a wide, easy smile and mischievous eyes.
Vincent eyed Sherlock with contempt. "He doesn't
Both eyebrows returned to their rightful places. "You don't want to talk about it, ok. But I'd put your lab coat back on if you want to stick to your story about the gym."
Sherlock tipped his head, considering. "I thought you'd get nervous and wouldn't enjoy it as much if you had too much time to think about it."
women are underage, do you?"
"Mmm," John hummed agreeably. He was alternating between laving wet kisses right where Sherlock wanted them, and blowing gently. The sensation seemed to be slowly unraveling the man.
Relief flooded Sherlock with such intensity that he didn't contemplate the words before they burst out of them. "Oh, thank God."
John smiled wickedly, taking the soapy flannel from Sherlock and reaching around him to swipe it over his bum. "That is excellent news." He squeezed a plump cheek. "Can't wait for you to show me," he murmured, rubbing the cloth across Sherlock's perineum and then reaching between them to get his bollocks and cock soapy.
John raised his eyebrows in surprise. Had he been staring? Then the weight of the man's words hit him, and he whipped his head around. "You know him?"
"Mmmm, filthy, John. That's not selfish at all; I almost came while I was rimming you earlier." John pulled away, eyebrows raised in surprise. Sherlock rolled John's nipples between his thumb and forefinger as he pushed him against the pillow, trailing kisses down his body. "God, you genuinely have no clue how amazing you are, do you? The way you were wiggling and grinding against my face, begging me for more. I'm leaking remembering it."
ashamed. Although he'd endured few instances of harassment over his sexuality -- his personality seemed to offend people on a much grander scale -- it had happened a few times. Once, the perpetrator had even tried to get handsy with him, shoved him against a wall and moved to yank at his belt buckle.
For the first time in over a month, Sherlock and John had a lot to talk about.
They were nearing the cinema now, and Sherlock was growing impossibly more irritable. "His cake was objectively more show-stopping than Nadiya's. The judges just liked the sentiment that she was finally getting her own wedding cake. They just
me?? Don't be ridiculous. I just wanted ... I wanted what you wanted. And I wanted my first time doing that to be with you." He rubbed Sherlock's long arm. "I know you said it didn't matter, but it did to me. I wanted to do something special for you."
He laughed, and Molly wanted to wrap herself up in his caramelly voice. "Doesn't sound like it was a very satisfying arrangement."
Sherlock pulled away from the kiss, wanting to look John in the eye as he stroked him.
"Jesus, Sally. That's fucking awful."
After he practically carried John into the taxi, Sherlock huffed and sneered. "You must've been getting some exciting intel if you felt it necessary to bypass flirting and go straight to seducing."
John looked genuinely confused, but simply murmured "Don't be sorry," as he squeezed lube in his palm and stroked Sherlock in time with careful, slow pushes inside him. "Too much?" John asked, when Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut.
Sally tugged him back with the leash, slapping him hard against the face. "Goddamnit," she growled, slapping him again. She dug her fingers in his curls, yanking his head back to look at her face. "Do it right." She pulled on the collar, forcing his mouth against her again.
"You're goddamn right," Molly hissed back.
Sherlock moved his other hand to John's face. "Your stubble," he purred, rubbing his thumb down John's jaw. "It feels pink."
She leaned back against the wall and he closed around her, holding her arms loosely against the wall as he ground his hips against hers, finding her clit unerringly. Molly gasped and he grinned against her mouth, growling, "You like that?" before he plundered her mouth.
She walked up to the bar and ordered a tequila slammer. As she waited, she tried to look around seeming too conspicuous. This was a more rowdy pub than the one she had gone to with Sally, closer to a club atmosphere. She would have preferred an actual club, but didn't have the right clothes at John and Sherlock's. This place was still a smallish, and comfortable – – there were some booths with cushy bench seating, and while the music playing was a clubby mix of R&B, hip-hop, and top 40, it wasn't played at such a loud volume that it was impossible to hear the person right next to you.
"Easy, gorgeous," John said, wrapping his hand around Sherlock's and slowing it down considerably. "This is how you like it." John twisted their hands to swirl a delicious friction over Sherlock, going barely over the ridge of his cockhead before twisting back down to the base. Sherlock's breath caught in his throat, and John released him. "Do it just like that. Perfect. God, you are absolutely perfect." He could feel Sherlock relaxing beneath him. "That's it. Just look at that beautiful cock. All mine now." Sherlock's breathing picked up and he shot a pleading look at him. "A little faster. Squeeze a little tighter. Yesss, like that." John kissed Sherlock's shoulder. "Let it go, love. I want to watch you." Three more squeezing strokes and he was shuddering and gasping as he splashed across their chests.
. One simply did not give red flowers to one's sister, or landlady, or mother, or coworker. Red flowers are highly romantic, so it seemed likely to Sherlock that the flowers were for him. But that didn't make sense; why would John put flowers for him in the refrigerator, and then remove them?
Molly closed her mouth over the hard, rather large cock in front of her, chasing away the voice in her head. Caramel Voice threaded his fingers in her hair and thrust deeply -- not enough to hurt her, just enough to make her feel used. Molly's clammy hands slipped over his cock as she attempted to work the shaft as she all but swallowed the head. He started panting and cursing above her, and Molly felt -- for a moment -- proud, that she still could be used like this. He fucked into her mouth and his thrusts grew sloppy. He thrust too hard and too quickly, gagging her. He whispered an apology and then groaned a warning before coming against her now-sore throat.
John stood and took a few steps closer. "You need to leave," he said softly.
--------------------
Sherlock forced himself to focus, and to whittle down his evidence into facts. Decreased appetite, hypersomnia, decreased energy, emotional emptiness, inability to focus, and a lack of interest and enjoyment in nearly all activities. Sherlock’s hands paused for a moment as the obviousness of it came crashing down on him. A wave of relief overtook him, followed swiftly by shame. He knew that John had battled depression in the past and that he had, in fact, been in dire straits when they’d met. Sherlock had always assumed that to be situational, as he had gone off his antidepressants within 2 months of moving into the flat and had seemed fine ever since. Happy. Rather deliriously so, over the past six months.
"Nope." Sherlock's lips popped on the word, then started ghosting kisses along his ear. "Tell me what you really want."
----------
John held his gaze for a few long moments but before long he was leaning his forehead against Sherlock's, reassuring him that he wanted this with his loud, steady heartbeat and quiet moans.
Sherlock exhaled his annoyance, but John kept holding his hand, rubbing his thumb along the sensitive flesh over his wrist, and his thoughts wandered. He did not remember arriving at the hospital, but he remembered the blast, being thrown. Was John okay? He must be, he was here at the hospital with him, walking and talking and teasing him. Taking care of him, the way he always did. Gratitude flooded him, and he curled his fingers against John's again. John returned his pressure gently, and there were fingers in his curls, massaging his scalp. Normally, John would never touch him like this. When he had been hurt before, the doctor examined him with gentle hands (or rough hands, if Sherlock protested too much), but John had never been physically affectionate. Of course, Sherlock did not exactly invite affection. Perhaps it was because he was laid up, barely conscious. No, that wasn't right. That explained the squeezes to his hand, but it did not explain the strokes to his wrist, or the caresses to his hair. He replayed the evening in his head. They’d escaped, they were running, the blast … the kiss. John had kissed him back. Sherlock allowed John to soothe him to sleep, a faint smile quirking his lips.
John squeezed again, spreading another drop of moisture around. “I want to taste you.” His face warmed, but he sneaked a peek at Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock scrambled up, yelping when John smacked his bottom. Lowering himself onto the bed, he thought about the best way to goad John a bit. And so it was that he was lying as commanded, slowly stroking himself, when John entered the room.
"You tip your chin up like this," John explained. "That way you make a more straight path from your lips to your throat."
John swiftly agreed, and Sherlock approached slowly, telegraphing each step. Her eyes didn't leave him but she stayed still and seemed calmer than she had when John had approached. Sherlock knelt in front of her, holding his hands palm-up near hers and waiting patiently. After a few long moments, she set down her tea and gave him her hands. He stroked them comfortingly, fondly, and met her eyes. He was quiet for a full minute, seeming to weigh what to say.  Finally, he squeezed her hands gently to gain her attention. "Who was he?" His voice was sharper than he'd intended.
Squeezing Sherlock's hand gently, John asked, "Anyone ever hurt you?"
So instead, he went back to John's room, opened the closet, and set the fur on top of the dresser that contained all the other things he wished to put away for awhile. This used to make him anxious, leaving things in his Mind Palace, letting things go unresolved. But now, it was a comfort; he knew he could always find his way back here if he needed to.
Sherlock lifted a teasing eyebrow. “That was your Valentine’s gift to me? You predicted a random person would recognize us and tweet out a picture of you feeding me dessert?”
A half-second's pause confirmed his deduction. "I want you to fuck me."
She was achy and it was too deep, really, just on the wrong side of uncomfortable. Arching her back, she tried to meet his thrusts. Actual pain spiked deliciously through her. She cried out, and he covered her mouth. Molly lowered one foot to the floor so she didn't fall, and sucked panicked breaths in through her nose and rutted harder. "Hush, now," he grunted, eyes glinting with lust. "My flatmate is sleeping--"
yet. You're too squeamish."
As predicted, Sherlock had cracked the case wide open the following day and had been absolutely buoyant when the kidnapper was dragged off in handcuffs. He hailed a taxi and pulled John into it, shouting vague promises about paperwork to Lestrade over his shoulder. They tumbled inside, smiling giddily, and Sherlock leaned in, raising his eyebrows and waiting. John realized that he had stuffed them into the cab in order to satisfy John's rule about PDA in front of Lestrade et al. He nodded and Sherlock rushed in with a crush of teeth and lips. John opened his mouth to tease a lick inside Sherlock's mouth, and was rewarded with a quiet hiss of "yessss" and then they were overtly snogging in the back of a taxi. After a minute or two, John pulled back, a little winded and nodded his head toward the driver to remind Sherlock that they were not alone. Sherlock didn't look like he cared at all about public displays of affection but he settled for resting his hand just a little too high up on John's thigh, lightly rubbing with his long fingers and giving John significant looks. John had to laugh and looked out the window for the remainder of the drive home.
Sherlock’s eyes danced with mischief. "You've been watching me sleep for --" he lifted his eyes to check the date on the whiteboard opposite the bed, "--two days, so you tell me."
“Who?”
-- "You'll wake him up."
John looked scared all of a sudden; more scared than he had when Sherlock had been shouting at him. "What do you want from me, Sherlock?"
He wasn't in Moriarty's lair, he was in the bloody hospital. God, he hoped he was rescued soon.
"Fire when ready," he said, crossing his arms behind his head.
John pushed open the garden gate, heading toward where the apparent owners were standing, looking distraught as Anderson examined the body several feet away. “You think that has something to do with the victim? Maybe they borrowed money from the wrong person.”
John's fingers went to his neck, and he instructed Sherlock to twist it this way and that. It was tight, felt misaligned, but no worse than he'd experienced after that collision he'd been in back in uni. "I’m fine, I just need muscle relaxers.”  John rolled his eyes but he didn’t admonish him for playing doctor; he must feed badly that he was hurting. Sherlock smirked. “You know, if classical literature is to be believed, a kiss is meant to bring one out of a coma, not put him into one."
. John wrapped his fingers around Sherlock’s slick shaft, letting it follow his mouth until he was only sucking on the head. He stroked fast, groaning against Sherlock’s head as his tongue circled the slit.
There was a group of 30-somethings sipping beers and vodka tonics and talking animatedly near the dance floor. John smiled; they were laughing about something someone just out of his view had said. A tall man standing with his back to John waved at someone a few groups over and left to go visit, leaving Sherlock's unmistakable profile visible.
Sherlock cradled John's head, pulling him closer still. "I detest arguing with you," he murmured between kisses. "Especially when we can't properly make up for 7-10 days."
John huffed warm breath against Sherlock's neck. "You're incorrigible. What are
Molly thought for a moment about something Sally wouldn't use against him. "Remember when the Baby Jesus went missing from the Trafalgar Square display?"
“That old line,” Sherlock teased lightly, stroking John’s hair and watching his face slacken.
John pushed himself up on one elbow. "Don't 'more than satisfactory' me. You know as well as I do that I could seriously hurt you and I wasn't exactly being gentle at the end."
Molly nodded, and Sherlock smiled in grim satisfaction. She stood on her toes and pulled his neck down to give him a swift kiss on the cheek. "
John studied Sherlock’s face, which would have passed as unruffled to anyone else; only John could see the massive freak-out going on just beneath the surface. Sherlock, who never believed he was good enough for John, would be mentally punishing himself for standing between him and James. Oh, he would know, objectively, that John had chosen him, but he wouldn’t feel its truth. Not when John had been so distant for so long.
Sherlock slid his eyes over to Steve warningly. "Obviously." His voice was edged with something, and John realized Sherlock didn't want Steve to reveal what he knew about John.
mean? Did you delete something?" His voice was hushed and panicky.
of choices you have made. They are not punishments that absolve you of what you've done."
John barked out a surprised laugh. “I’m sorry, what? You need to reconsider your evidence, love.”
Sherlock was hard again and John's cock was starting to feel less uncomfortable inside him. He moved against John experimentally and relaxed when it didn't hurt. Swatting John's hand from his cock, he wrapped his long legs around John's waist and pulled him forward.
Sherlock took a quiet, steadying breath, trying to exhale the betrayal and his insecurity in the interest of helping John in this moment. He reached out, cradling John's face and lowering his head to catch John's eye. "What did you think I wouldn't understand?" He brushed his thumbs over John's cheekbones. "That I'm not the only person you've ever loved? That you have the capacity to love more than one person?" Gently, gently, as though he could break the fragile man beneath his fingertips, Sherlock stroked John's face. "He made you happy?"
?? That's adorable." He kissed at John's neck, smoothing a hand up John's thigh, over his hip, and up his side. "Anywhere else?"
John flinched, adjusted his cane. "But do you see how it might be a bit difficult to see someone all the time when you've had a falling out?"
Sherlock smirked. "Bit late for that now, don't you think?"
John grasped Sherlock's knee under the table. "Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded, even though he was really sure. John pulled his fingers out carefully and Sherlock whined, feeling empty. After stuffing a pillow under Sherlock's bum, he drizzled more slick on his opening and the coated himself generously. "Tell me when to stop." John lined up and pushed.
He slid his thumb over the head of John’s cock, heard him gasp.
Molly nearly choked on a kernel of corn in her haste to respond. "God, YES. That is exactly it. I don't feel at home in my own brain right now. I don't feel safe."
"And then I stopped fighting. I told him to please leave, and he ignored me. I don't know why I didn't keep fighting; it was like my body was stuck. I should've fought more." Molly was near tears.
Molly started folding her clothes as she waited for a reply.
She cried quietly in the back of the cab. She had to pee. Her cunt hurt. She was sticky and disgusting and worthless and all she wanted to do was wash the night off of her, and sleep forever.
Sherlock smirked, then stood to retrieve his violin. He plinked at the strings, tuning, thinking. He played the beginning notes of
straight. You have no idea what you've just done." He patted the top of John's head like he was a dumb puppy, and John swatted at him, laughing.
Sherlock closed his eyes, enjoying the slide of his hand, and listening intently. The bedside drawer opened and shut swiftly, and the bed dipped with John's weight. Sherlock allowed a breathy moan to escape his lips, and John's dangerous honey-sweet voice cooed in his ear. "Enjoying yourself?"
"Yes," said John, running his nose up Sherlock's jugular. "But you've never
Sally's face was stuck somewhere between extreme discomfort and admiration. Molly strode out of the room and watched as he was led away in handcuffs. She inclined her head to him as he passed.
The taxi ride was far too short. When they pulled up, Sally was leaning against the doorway, holding a paper bag that Molly sincerely hoped contained something her queasy stomach would find palatable.
Molly climbed the stairs 221b wearily, already dreaming of fresh knickers and sleep. She nearly jumped out of her skin when John's voice cut through the mostly-dark room. "Molly."
Sally rinsed her bowl in the sink. "Listen, you're a grown woman and you'll do what you think is best. But it's a hell of a lot easier to get through this with someone who knows what the fuck they're doing helping you."
"I'm picky," John quipped, turning around to pluck at Sherlock's shirt buttons. "How'd you know it wasn't a one-off?"
John gasped, hands leaving Sherlock’s backside and moving reflexively to his back. He stopped shy of touching, merely gaped at the shiny, tiger-striped scars that littered what had clearly once been a long stretch of creamy, unblemished skin. He glanced up, seeking permission as his fingertips hovered. Sherlock nodded, and John lightly traced a few of the smaller lines before descending to a particularly nasty scar that marred his right shoulder blade. This one had got infected, John saw. Sherlock shivered as his gentle touch, and John looked up to see that he was staring straight ahead, as though resigned to the examination.
Beside him, John made a strangled, interested noise. He was breathing hard, and the flush was creeping up his face. Getting close. "Her nipples get rock hard. And then she gets very relaxed and giggly and she tells you that her pussy feels empty and she climbs on top of you and holds you still while she sinks down over you. And it's so hot, and she's so wet and tight. She doesn't move right away, just savors the feeling of fullness for a few moments. She gives your cock a firm squeeze and grins like it's the best thing ever when you groan." John was biting his lip hard now, ducking his face a bit to hide it. "God, look at you. About to come in your pants like a horny teenager in front of Sally and Greg. Do you want to come, John?"
They kissed and rubbed and ruffled and tugged until they were both dry, and Sherlock grabbed a dry towel from the hook on the door, abandoning the wet one on the tile floor. John had gone a bit giddy and was steering Sherlock to his old room as he pressed soft, giggly kisses to his mouth.
Sherlock felt the sweet, empty ache inside of him that he's come to associate with John, but there was an edge to it tonight. He squeezed his cock, relieving the pressure but not trying to bring himself off. Arching his spine in pleasure, he moaned. "Please, John."
Sherlock closed his eyes. John's fingers felt heavenly in his hair, and he could feel his cock thickening. Unexpected, but hardly unwelcome. A smirk ghosted across his face as he let his hand glide up John's leg to nudge against his bollocks. The fingers in his hair stilled and John arched an eyebrow at him.
"Yeah, close.
John winced, and Sherlock's voice drew quiet as he corrected himself again. "
Sherlock smiled affectionately and pulled him back in for another kiss, resting his hands on John's hips, mastering his impulse to devour the man. "You sure?" he asked. Taking sexual advantage of someone who was feeling vulnerable was a Very Bad Thing; it had to be John's decision. He slid a hand down John's thigh to grab under his knee.
his cock with the same single mindedness with which he examines patients. He felt the heat in his belly spread suddenly and there was no stopping it. He cried as the world compressed around him and he gulped in raggedy breaths.
A few feet away, Molly was taking one cock deep in her mouth, and another was just starting to push into her arse. Tears started to drip beneath her blindfold and she was gripped the ropes tightly. The burn in her arse was delicious, and she couldn't even scream because of the cock choking her. She pulled at the ropes, letting them bite into her wrists. It was perfect.
Fingers snapped in front of his face and Sherlock realized he had gone silent and still. John was looking at him with slight concern; everyone else was waiting to hear an earthshaking deduction. Sentiment was affecting the work. "He was standing at the counter when he was pushed from behind. The person who did the pushing dropped his knife -- most likely male based on the height and weight -- which slashed the victim on his back. It landed point-down and then skidded. An accident, or perhaps made to look like one. Kitchens are narrow and knives are everywhere, so everyone knows to be cautious; whomever did this was either a complete novice or was pretending to be clumsy ..."
Sherlock downed half of his new glass with a series of quick sips. John smiled at him. “Do you ever get the feeling that Angelo understands us better than we do? He had us figured out the first time he laid eyes on me. It’s like he has some special John-and-Sherlock superpower.”
The doctor leaned forward; Vincent recoiled slightly, leaning toward Lestrade. He swallowed and looked Vincent in the eye, putting as much sincerity in to his statement as possible. "I'm so, so sorry about what happened to you, Mr. Tucker. I know you must have been terrified and that you've probably never felt totally safe since. The maniac who attacked you deserves worse than prison. He deserves to be lonely and miserable, to be suffer for what he's done, to be shot. Wherever he is, I hope the truth of what he did has eaten at him for the past 15 years and that he has never felt safe, either."
Sherlock settled himself between John’s knees, dropping down for a kiss before pushing into him slowly, carefully. They rocked together, gently, no agenda in mind other than anchoring themselves to the present, to each other. Damp foreheads pressed together and lips and fingers soothed their invisible hurts, smoothing them away, leaving whispered promises in their place.
..." Sherlock was silent, waiting as John's brain tried to form a coherent sentence. "I fucking hate you for doing it like this."
Sherlock tugged, and pulled John tight to his chest, and for the first time in ages John melted into him. Sherlock kissed his head and traced his fingers over his scalp as he weighed what to say next. “Tell me about him?”
Lestrade took a sip of coffee and winced. "Finally got to that, eh? He got picked up a few times, but Mycroft always worked his magic to get the charges dropped." He nudged John under the table with his foot. "Don't be too hard on him, eh? He was in a really bad place. Thought sure we'd find him dead in a ditch eventually." He fiddled with a sugar packet. "You know how Sherlock would do anything for a case? That's how he used to be about getting a fix. Was a bit heartbreaking, really, because we could all tell he was literally a genius. Wasting all his talent on deducing who would trade a blowjob for whatever he needed. Seen a million smackheads, and he's about the only one I've known to kick it."
Sherlock nibbled on his ear. "Of course. It's the least messy option. And besides, I haven't gotten to do you yet."
right now. The flush, which had started in his face, had moved in splotchy patches down his chest, and his eyes were glassy, unfocused, and often rolled back in his head. Sherlock fucked into him, a bit more roughly, and John groaned, starting up his rambling again. Sherlock doubted he was even aware he was talking.
"Of course."
, of course."
, how had he ever thought that this could be boring, that
Sherlock considered whether perhaps it was possible that Harry had remained sober for a year. He was fairly certain that she had relapsed a few months back, although possibly John had not been aware; Sherlock had not mentioned it. However, at any rate, he kept coming back around to the flowers being
Anderson blinked at him a few times, and out of the corner of his eye he could see John look up at him in curiosity. “The soil has nothing to do with it, Sherlock.” John opened his mouth, already starting to nod his agreement.
John rolled on his side, nuzzling Sherlock's neck, but Sherlock continued to stare stoically at the ceiling. John murmured into his neck. "Sorry, love. Shouldn't have brought it up."
"No, Sherlock. I mean, yes, that's all true, but it's not what you think."
Molly nodded along, biting her lip nervously. Knowing Sherlock, he would take this new information and sniff out her attacker by day's end. Now that finding and prosecuting him was a possibility, Molly was not sure what she wanted. When if it went to trial? What if she had to testify? She spent a lot of time in court, knew all the judges and bailiffs, and the thought of them knowing about this, pitying her, made her a little bit ill. Would she be taken as seriously as an expert witness if they heard her saying things like, "He said I could take his big dick"?
Sherlock didn’t turn; he was working hard on deep breathing and swallowing the ridiculous tears that were thinking of springing to his eyes.
John rolled on his side, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's shoulder. "Oh, Captain Watson can always come out to play. I just don't usually lead with him."
John's lips twitched a bit. "Can't you?"
“Mmmmm,” John hummed, closing his eyes. “You’re right, it’s much better.” His voice had gone a bit breathless. “
Sally snickered into her beer. "Let's just say I had a strict don't ask, don't tell policy about that case." She set the empty glass down. "Besides, why would he tell you about something illegal he did?"
----------
John turned to look at him, jaw open. "See, you are guessing. There's no possible way you could have known that."
Distantly, he realized John was grinning against his neck. He rolled his eyes even though John couldn't see it. "You already knew," he rumbled drily.
"No!" Sherlock protested, even as every cogent voice in his head screamed,
"Let's move to the sofa," John suggested. "Grab us a drink?"
Sherlock smiled and exhaled an almost-laugh. "It's like slow sex, how you draw it out to heighten the sensation? It's similar to that. I can zoom in on the sensation of rubbing my fingertips against your skin, feel every pore and get lost in how quickly or slowly they move across my skin."
John ran a hand lightly up Sherlock's flank to squeeze his plush arse. Sherlock widened his stance a bit and John pushed his cheeks apart, running a thumb lightly over his opening, then dipping his head down to breathe on it. Sherlock shuddered and he began moving faster over Greg's erection.
With one last lick up his shaft, John nipped his way back up his young lover's body. Sherlock devoured his mouth, flipping them over and pinning John's arms over their heads as he sucked on his lower lip.
"I'm wondering whether you could assist me with a small problem," Sherlock began, and John's stomach tightened. He recognized that silky tone for exactly what it was. He glared hard at Sherlock, willing him to look at him, but instead Sherlock turned his body to crowd Lestrade.
"They're here," Sherlock told John. "Do hold it together until they leave." John rolled his eyes, and both men squared their shoulders before leaving the bedroom. John set to work making tea and Sherlock sat in his chair, waiting with what have passed for patience to anyone but John.
Sally thought for a moment. "About 6 months, I guess? I tried to go off them after a month." She rolled her eyes, shaking her head at her own foolishness. "I hated having to take them, but it was just too soon. Couldn't focus on my studies at all, snd I started skipping class again. So I went back on them and told myself not to rush it. Tried again a few months later and had no problems."
"A bit, yeah. He was down to his pants and I sent some signals. Figured it was safe to test the waters and we could both pretend it was a joke the next day, because of the pain pills, but he definitely returned my interest." He took a sip of his drink, watching the amber liquid swirl in his glass. "It was another month of him pulling me to do this or that and then us falling into easy conversation before we even kissed, but we both knew it was coming. It was very intense."
Sally shrugged and waved as she walked towards the door, pulling her coat around her and popping a mint that she'd retrieved from a tin inside her bag.
"Almost done,"she called, breathless with cold. She let herself get attacked by the icy spray a minute longer before turning it off and wrapping herself in a thin towel. She opened the door, still shivering, and found John still standing there.
Sherlock stopped pacing when he saw Molly and Sally approach. John stood expectantly. "Was it him?" he asked.
Fingers gripped his hips and finally, mercifully, John thrust deep into him, and Sherlock sighed through his parted, smiling lips. He pulled back out and nudged at Sherlock’s knees, pulling them wider. Sherlock obliged and before he even had time to steady himself, John had driven his cock back into him, this time brushing against his prostate. Electric shocks licked through Sherlock’s body and he hissed. “Yesssssssssss. More.” John snapped his hips again, and Sherlock dropped his head, biting his lip to hold in his moans.
John narrowed his eyes. "You try to pull that on Sherlock again and I will do the same to you."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Really, John, even you are not that blind. You noticed me staring at your biceps just last week."
"Fuuuuuck," John groaned, leaning his forehead against Sherlock's shoulder. "You're amazing." He thrusted up, feeling the slick slide of satin against his cock. "If I grab your arse, are you going to move?"
Sherlock felt rather like the insect when, after a moment of stillness, John began to move his lips against Sherlock, gently, gently, like he was a delicate butterfly that my crumble in his hands. Precious. Beautiful. And Sherlock felt his energy pull away from his body and thought,
“Yours,” Sherlock panted. “Only yours.” He took only a few seconds to breathe before impaling himself on John’s cock again, and good
Sherlock bore down, nudging John in a smidge farther. "It won't hurt once it's in. It'll be easier next time." This was probably a lie, but Sherlock was determined to give John what he wanted, and to know they'd done it at least once. Sherlock rocked his hips away and then back, not taking John any deeper but letting him move in the space he had so far. As John gently rocked into and out of him, Sherlock kept pushing himself open and bit by bit, inch by endless sodding inch, John worked his way inside and finally, blessedly, he bottomed out.
After a moment, John exhaled through a smile. “It’s all good, Sherlock. Have you got a condom? If we don’t do this soon I’m not going to make it.”
Sherlock's face pinked. "Truth?"
alone since he was actually able to stand up for himself. Defending someone who preyed on vulnerable people for being different left a foul taste in his mouth, even when that someone was John.
The look Sherlock shot John could only be described as withering. "Cracked the case wide open, haven't you?" John searched Sherlock's expression, expecting to see jealousy or hurt or even amusement. Sherlock turned away imperiously.
. He plunged his tongue inside John’s mouth, mimicking the movement of his hips as he licked against John’s tongue and hard palate.
the idea of being watched. You used to purposely leave the door cracked when you had Jeanette over for a shag and your respiration rate increased when I mentioned Mycroft watching."
John turned his back to Sherlock and sighed contentedly when he began massaging his shoulders. Sherlock frowned, slowly kneading the tight muscles, quickly focusing in on his bad shoulder. "You need a muscle relaxant," he murmured. "How did it get in this state?"
, and it was as though the last wisp of gravity holding him to John was snipped and he was flying but his wings didn't work, it was dark and he was lost.
In the end, they reached their peaks nearly together, bodies shuddering as their kisses slowed and Sherlock's hand fell away. John pulled away, tugging on Sherlock's arm and rearranging then so that he was lying on his back with his head resting on Sherlock's shoulder. Greg stretched out on John's other side, arms folded behind his head and leg splayed to rub against John's.
John froze in the middle of investigating Sherlock’s spine, seeming to decide whether to deny it or not for a moment before pulling back, a smile playing at his lips. "You kissed me,” he contradicted, “Although, I have that effect.” They grinned at each other. “Would that make you Sleeping Beauty?"
By the time he finished his wine, Sherlock was feeling relaxed and loose-limbed. John’s glass wasn’t half gone, but he nodded at Sherlock and circled to help pull out his chair. Angelo waved off their attempts to pay, and they stepped out into the night.
we can not infer the cause of death until we have studied the soil.”
John laughed a bit. "Well, you ought to be well used to that sensation. Nothing new there."
John nodded. "Understandable."
"Bitch," he hissed quietly.
And they were off. There were no new cooks in the kitchen, which strongly suggested foul play. John and Sherlock moved to a booth in the corner, away from the crowd, looking over the employment files and cross-checking their findings with information in various databases. John was leaned over his laptop when Sherlock murmured, "You're quite taken with the hostess's breasts. You keep stealing glances at them when you think no one's looking." Sherlock continued sorting through the stacks of paper, not looking directly at John. "You also seem to quite like Donovan's top today." His eyes slid up to John's for just a moment as he handed him an employee to search. "The buttons look like they might pop." He returned to the pile of papers.
John looked at Sherlock's mouth, then at his own cock, then stared heatedly into his eyes as he dropped his chin in silent command.
The whisper of a smile ghosted over Sherlock's face, but he quickly returned to his slightly bored expression as he flipped through papers and files. "When she starts moving, she lets out a little moan, and she bites her lip when you thrust up to meet her. She likes to
Vincent glared down at Sherlock, seeming to debate whether Sherlock believed what he was saying. "You know how it is, half the guys who bullied us as teenagers turned out to be gay themselves. Just because you two are a couple doesn't mean --"
Sherlock searched his face, and saw only a hint of nervousness around his eyes.  He frowned. “This isn’t a concession to this idiotic holiday, is it?”
He pumped his hips a few more times and then stilled, rolling off of John reluctantly as he gulped in deep lungfuls of air. He felt John cleaning himself with the towel before lifting his bum to toss it away. Then John's warm weight settled across his chest and his neck tickled with the nuzzling of John's prickly face. He wrapped his long arms around John and basked in the quiet, loose-limbed euphoria that nearly always followed sex with John.
. This is
Careful not to kick Sherlock in the face, he turned to retrieve lube from the bedside stand and tossed it at Sherlock before sitting back down on his chest, this time facing the other way. He tucked his knees under him and leaned forward to grasp Sherlock’s erection. He was just pulling back the foreskin to tongue at the head when he felt Sherlock’s tongue swiping along the inside of his cheek. “
Sherlock handed them each a glass of whisky, ignoring John’s pointed glare. “I’d say you have plenty of reason to be angry.”
... That is, I could ask John ..."
Sherlock studied the man’s face and something very improbable clicked into place. “We are not here to discuss personal matters between you and my partner. Clearly your personal trainer has been poisoned. Anderson – God help you – will arrange for all the appropriate evidence collection. I’ll see that all the relevant information gets to DI Lestrade.”
Sherlock closed his eyes, internally flinching as John opened his trousers and grew still. Sherlock felt his face burning. “Bit too much wine, I think,” he explained, his voice tight.
"Pointless," Sherlock responded, shifting his weight minutely. "You're planning on vigorous oral sex with deepthroating. We don't need a safeword for that."
Caramel Voice sidled up beside her as she stood in line at the bar to pay. "Alone at last, eh?"
The bartender chuckled. "I hope so, too. Kylie takes kickboxing classes in her spare time." John squinted and he could see it, almost, in the way she moved her shoulders, that she could fight. "She's selective, though. Your friend must be either charming or a great tipper."
Sherlock's eyebrows furrowed in confusion. "That's what who said? Donovan? Oh God, no, probably Anthea. What did she say, precisely?"
John laughed in horror at what rated as dramatic to Sherlock. "Secret's safe, love. Don't want anyone else seeing you anyway." John kissed him, squeezing his bum lightly.
Sherlock lifted John’s knees, finding a good angle before he settled the length of his body atop of John’s. Was this too intimate? He flickered his gaze across John’s features, which were still loose and warm, and relief washed over him. As he rutted gently inside John, he pushed in for a soft, playful kiss. John reached up, tangling his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and rocking his hips to pull him closer. God, Sherlock could do this for
John rose to a kneeling position, pulling Sherlock in for a kiss, winding his fingers through his curls and tugging as he met tongue with tongue. Sherlock broke the kiss and moved to his ear, eliciting the same shivery giggle as before. John tugged away, swatting at Sherlock’s behind again. “Why don’t you lay back and let me do all the work, to start off?”
Molly didn't know exactly what triggered it. The Irish tunes then comforting at first, made her think about a time in her life when she felt safe and secure and loved. Then, at some point during the mournful last song, she had realized that she would never feel secure in that same way again. She hadn't had a child's sense of safety for quite some time, of course, especially with her job being what it was. But she had not felt properly safe since her rape, and she was only just now realizing how much that fear was affecting her. She hugged her knees to her chest, and rested her chin on top of them. Molly hadn’t cried since she’d been raped, but she found that after her exhausting day she simply did not have the energy to hold them in. She rolled her head, pressing her cheek to her knees so that Sherlock wouldn’t see the tears that were slowly rolling down her face. The fear and grief she’d been holding at bay for five days pressed down on her, forcing a sob out of her chest, and suddenly she had no control over her tears at all.
Sherlock grinned. "Cheeks are fine, but no funny business."
Molly arched into a pinch of her nipples, sighing happily when Sherlock instructed him to do it harder. "Jim." Sharp teeth replaced the pinching fingers.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa," said John, sitting up. "Do you think you nearly -- what,
Next, he considered whether the flowers were for someone with whom John had a platonic relationship but harbored secret, perhaps unconscious, romantic feelings. Sherlock's mind flickered through possibilities but eventually came up empty.  He continued like this for four agonizing hours, until he heard John's slightly uneven tread on the stairs. The doorknob turned, the door pushed open and –
The first thing Sherlock observed, eyes still closed, was that gravity had returned with a vengeance. It was not just anchoring him, it was crushing him, so that he couldn't open his eyes, or talk, or move. His ears were working, though, so he reached out with those. Beep ... Beep ... Beep. The sound came at regular intervals, approximately 58 beats per second.
John snorted, but seemed mollified. He watched for a few minutes as Sherlock stroked him, then laid his head back against the taller man when he spat in his hand and quickened his slick strokes. He whimpered when Sherlock moved his hand to his hip, pulling him firmly against him. "Alright?" He asked, grasping tightly and rocking against his arse, making his intent so obvious that even John should understand.
Sherlock leaned down, kissing John’s face and ruffling his hair tenderly. “I’m sorry,” he repeated, smoothing his thumbs over the hot flush that had spread over John’s cheeks. “I was being a bit of a brute.” He raked his eyes over John’s body, searching for data. He was sweating slightly from the pain, but his breathing had settled. His legs were clenched defensively around him and his erection was flagging a bit. “Do you still hurt?”
John's snort rang too-loud in the somber room. "That's the nicest thing you've ever said about her." An awkward tension fell between them, and John realized that Sherlock was holding his breath as though steeling for a blow. "Oh, Sherlock, love, no. You don't have to tell me anything. That's her story." John felt the tension leak away from the long body next to him and he leaned in for a long kiss. "Let's rest for a few hours and then see what we can do about this bastard in the morning."
Long fingers wrapped around him, and the heat inside John grew more insistent, expanding until it burst out of him with a quiet cry of relief. Sherlock leaned in for a kiss, moving inside him with a steady, reassuring pressure. John ran his fingers down Sherlock’s back, to his hips, urging them closer. Sherlock caught them and, pressing their tangled fingers to the mattress by John’s head.
John returns and they find their equilibrium again.
Sally dipped a breadstick into her bowl and munched it thoughtfully. "Well, I really resisted going, but at the end of the day, being inside my mind suddenly felt like being inside a fucking jungle, and I needed a guide."
"They're so close," Molly breathed. They were close enough to reach out and touch each other, but for the glass between them.
Molly was still standing near the doorway, looking uncertain and unfocused. John gestured toward the living room, offering her tea. Molly walked in and both men stiffened as they saw her tentative gait, the way she held her arms hugged to her chest, the slight tension in her face when she sat. They both noticed the awkward way she held her opposite arm as she reached for her tea; Sherlock noticed that she was using her non-dominant hand. He also noticed her ponytail was loose, and that her nail polish was chipped. He noticed that she was wearing heels and more makeup than usual and anxiety pooled in his belly. He ran through the data again, willing a different conclusion.
Sherlock stretched contentedly. "Better," he agreed.
When they got to Sherlock's room, John dropped the bag and moved to walk out of the room when Sherlock grabbed his wrist. "Stay," he commanded.  His fingers slowly unfastened the buttons on his shirt, slowly exposing inches of fair skin. “I might need help. Besides, bodies don’t  embarrass you, Dr. Watson.”
John thrust in, long strokes that pushed hard into the tight ring of Sherlock’s throat, and he felt the beginnings of his climax tingling at his tailbone. “
,” she spat. “I think I’m losing it. I yelled at my nurse today! The littlest thing sets me off. It’s like there’s this angry fear just under the surface, ready to leap up at any moment.” She scrubbed at her eyes, which were starting to well up again.
he noted. He was just thinking of slowing things down when John planted his knees on either side of Sherlock and pushed him back onto the bed, yanking at Sherlock's belt and tapping on his slender hips. Sherlock lifted and John pulled off his trousers, tossing them on the floor before climbing back atop him to rut against the now very hard erection in Sherlock's pants. He reached down, palming him through the thin fabric of his pants and when Sherlock gasped out a choking groan, he seemed to lose his resolve to take things more slowly.
When they arrived at the flat, John went directly to his room and closed the door without speaking a word. Shucking his coat and shoes, Sherlock poured himself a whisky and settled down to John’s computer. An hour and another whisky or two later, he pulled at his hair in frustration and slammed the laptop shut.
to the to-do list in his Mind Palace.
"Better." Sherlock lowered his face to the top of John's head, dropping kisses there as he nosed through his hair. John tangled their feet together and returned his hand to his cock. Sherlock reached blindly behind him to find the lube on his bedside stand and passed it over.
, you daft git." He paused, narrowing his eyes. "Unless you two really did shag last night."
Sally closed the soup containers and put them in the refrigerator, along with the salad. "I have to go check in on Sherlock and Greg, see where they are with finding our kidnapper. I'll let Sherlock know you're settled in."
Now it was Sherlock's turn to roll his eyes. "Please. Are you gay now, too? Because you wear your hair like this exclusively on dates that you hope will end with intercourse." He scratched his scalp nervously. "Don't do this, Moll. Not at some pub with some random bloke. You've never wanted that before. If you ... If you
Alright, so he'd given some thought to John's sexual experiences. But this new data, the confidence and skill with which John had gone down on him, caused a shift in his calculations. Lust ripped through him. "You've done this before," Sherlock purred in his ear, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice. Erotic images flooded his brain and he sucked and nipped at the younger man’s neck just below his ear as he rutted his painfully hard erection against his leg.
Molly trudged toward him, knowing that he had waited up and wasn't going to let her pass without saying whatever he had to say, but she couldn't quite meet his eyes. "Where's Sherlock?"
Sherlock slid his eyes over John’s body, observing his flushed cheeks, his increased respiration, and, most importantly, his renewed erection. He kept his rhythm unpredictable, alternating between slow strokes and rough thrusts at random. Then he stopped, pulling out and smirking at John’s protesting whine. He pushed John’s knees up and to the side, pinning them against his shoulders, then lined up and slid slowly inside John’s welcoming body.
fine that he pushed forward. He rolled his eyes dismissively. "Yes, you've mentioned that, but you were probably high before."
"Leave?" She asked dumbly. Maybe she was still so drunk that she was mishearing.
Sherlock's huff was entirely humourless. "At times, I regret teaching you to observe." He shrugged. "We've never spoken about it, but I expect she knows. Certainly after tonight. She's not stupid."
The song changed, and Sherlock slowed down with it. Teasing the belt through the loops before snapping the leather loudly, he slowly pulled open the button and zipper of his leather trousers. His hands strayed then, rubbing his torso and neck again as he toed off his shoes and tossed them out of his way. John's pants were so tight that he felt like they were about to explode. Sherlock continue to dance hypnotically, slowly sliding his trousers down his legs.
He laughed, standing. "A pleasure to meet you both." He smiled slowly at Molly and strutted away.
"No, no," she reassured. "I just have to go." She swept out of the flat without checking for his reaction. She clambered down the stairs on shaky legs and rushed to the main road, praying for a taxi and managing to hail one after only a few minutes.
Sherlock waved him off, pulling him up by his good arm. "I have. In the sewing kit in the closet." John sighed and shook his head but didn't argue with Sherlock about his ill-gotten prescription drugs.
Sherlock was rock hard, and there was a wet spot on his boxer briefs at the tip of his cock. His fingers played at the edge of his boxer briefs uncertainly. John nodded his assent, and Sherlock shoved them away, taking himself in hand and stroking himself swiftly. He groaned in relief, eyes rolling back in his head as he brought himself to a very quick orgasm, catching his release on his discarded vest so it didn’t get on the rug.
"Close," Sherlock choked out, hips stuttering, not sure which mouth to push into. Greg pulled off with a light pop and John heard the slick sounds of him pumping Sherlock's cock. Sherlock groaned and stiffened, his hole puckering against John's lips as he slowed his movements into light, gentle things. Sherlock's body finally slumped and he collapsed onto his side, rolling onto his back and giggling deliriously.
Sherlock disentangled himself and scooted back to kneel, bum resting on John's knees. "I have a counter offer." He pulled his belt free of the loops and tossed it on the floor before opening his trousers and removing himself with a long stroke. "We haven't watched each other yet."
. So --" He lifted up to meet John's stroke -- "
John shrugged, rubbing a thumb over Sherlock's scars. "It makes me sad, I guess. Or angry, that you ever felt the need to go there. You deserved better, too."
She thought about how things could pan out. If she waited until she was totally comfortable to start dating someone, it could be months, maybe a year or more before she got laid. She had gone that long before, but she couldn't help but feel that this was different; this was hiding from her sexuality, as if all penises had magically become weapons. She thought that if she waited until she knew she was ready, like Sally suggested,  sex would become this Big Thing, a special milestone that it didn't deserve to be.
Sherlock bent down to kiss him again, sloppy and eager. John broke away as the song ended, smiling and gasping for breath. "Baker Street?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "I calculated a 60% chance that you would pretend it never happened."
John glared at him. "The polite thing is to pretend you don't notice, Sherlock. BOUNDARIES." Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, but John forestalled him. "Alright, alright. I mean, it varies. As you said, stress is a big trigger, as is being overtired. So when we're on an important case and we're going long days and nights to solve it, it's more likely to happen." He started putting groceries away as he talked. "Not all the time, though, maybe half? And then it seems to happen more when I first start dating someone, for some reason."
John slammed the door to the flat behind them and rounded immediately on Sherlock. "Do you have ANY explanation for what just happened??"
John shrugged. “Some people are uncomfortable seeing it, but you don’t seem to be bothered.”
Sherlock kissed him back. "Thought it would be an interesting experiment. I've never done it before."
Sherlock spat back, “And I thought it was all ‘fine’, regardless?” He glared down at John. “Don’t patronize me. I deserve an answer, even if I am a
Steve raised his eyebrows. "
Usually, Sherlock was very careful to be considerate when John gave him blow jobs, having himself been skullfucked so often that for awhile he'd forgotten it wasn't expected. However, John was also an unfailingly polite receiver of oral sex and the rules seemed to be different tonight. Sherlock thrust down John's throat experimentally and John flicked his mischievous eyes upward, grinning around his cock and pulling encouragingly on his hips.
The “no one in this room except you and me” line was shamelessly stolen from Joss Whedon. I still haven’t recovered from Firefly being canceled.
John repressed a shiver at the intimate touch and started counting heartbeats again. Sherlock was stable, which was expected; he hadn't taken anything dangerous, really. He loosened his touch on Sherlock's wrist but held it loosely, letting Sherlock continue his slow caress. "What do you feel right now?"
Sally asked a few follow-up questions and then decided it was enough for the night. On the way out, she promised to call and touch base soon but to call anytime. She scratched her cell phone number on the back of her card, along with a few words. Molly looked at them in the taxi.
Finally, he reached the waistband of John's pyjama pants, running his fingers and then his tongue lightly under the waistband before looking up at John and waiting. "God, yes, get them off," John growled. Sherlock pulled them over John's hips and then smirked up at him -- no pants. John grinned and wagged his eyebrows, lifting so Sherlock could shimmy them over his bum.
“Jinx,” John murmured, sliding his hand up and down Sherlock’s cloth-covered length. He glanced down, watching as he felt Sherlock fill out and harden. “God, that’s hot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock turned back toward John, jaw dropping in indignation in spite of himself. "Oh,
Wiping the bar in front of John, Chris cracked a big smile. "Nah. So long as the dancers are selling the lapdances, they don't much care what else goes on. You want another drink?" John nodded, no longer feeling any compunction about his level of inebriation. A few seconds later, the implication of what Chris had said smacked John in the face, so when he set another drink in front of him, he asked in as casual a voice as he could muster. "So the owners don't mind a little ... side business?"
Sherlock looked surprised, as though he'd been called upon unexpectedly, but leaned forward anyway. John crouched beside him, murmuring directions and encouragement. "Stick your tongue out past your lips, that'll ooen up your throat. That's it. Jesus, this is hot."
John shook his head. "I already asked. He can't get a strong enough signal to send pics with the wifi down. Can't work on the case until we get out of here, and we're not getting out for at least an hour." Sliding out of his jacket, he tossed it on the floor and unfastened the top few buttons of his shirt. The generator had turned on dim lights, but no air conditioning; it was already getting stuffy.
John's jaw dropped slightly and he shook his head in amazement. "Brilliant," he affirmed. "Yeah, she was quite religious. Nice girl! We didn't have much in common," he smiled. He took Sherlock’s hand again and looked at him carefully, as though he was trying to see into his brain through his skull.
Pouring then each a whisky, Sherlock arched an eyebrow questioningly. "Want to tell me about the letter from your father?" he asked, handing over a glass and taking a sip from his own.
John leaned forward and traced the healthy skin beside a long but shallow scar on his opposite shoulder with his tongue. Sherlock grew still, seeming to hold his breath, which came out in a shudder when John blew over the wet line he’d just made. “Yeah?” John asked, glancing up at the mop of black hair for permission.
Sherlock sat up, repressing a wince, and folded his arms. "I am absolutely
He propped himself up on his hands  to watch himself pushing into John's mouth, but it was hard to get leverage from this position. John, seeming to see the problem at the same time, pulled off and sat back on his heels so Sherlock could tuck his feet under him and pull himself up to a kneeling position. John got on all fours and opened his mouth, peering up at him impishly and waiting expectantly.
They worked their way through the courses, debating whether their favorite course had been the spinach and ricotta gnocchi or the shellfish stew and placing wagers on whether the woman two tables over was going to notice the ring in her flute before swallowing it with a mouthful of Moet. They were giggling quietly at the man, who was actually sweating with nerves, when someone finally recognized them. Sherlock sat up, making his body language more neutral. John looked at him in confusion and Sherlock slid his eyes to where the woman who’d spotted them was surreptitiously retrieving her phone from her purse. Eyes dancing, John speared a bite of the raspberry-white chocolate art in front of him and fed it to Sherlock.
The man shrugged. "A bit. I see him here probably once a month or so. He's come over to mine a couple of times. Amazing shag, like he's reading your bloody mind."
A group of older, impeccably-dressed men were getting a lot of glances from the boys. John snorted, thinking that they had no shot at all with them; they were subtly eyeing a group of men in their late 20s, who were drinking beers and cutting up. John smiled; what would Sherlock deduce about these men? John did his best.
, John. This is not my first time with an atypically sized penis. I am not submitting to a humiliating examination simply to ease your mind."
He pushed into her, and hissed.
Greg broke the silence by giggling. A few seconds later, the absurdity of what'd just happened hot John, and he started laughing, too. "Sherlock, you mad bastard," he managed.
“… until it wasn’t,” John supplied with a smile. He squeezed Sherlock’s biceps again, before rubbing down to his elbows and up to his neck. “You good?”
Sherlock smirked. "You should reconsider that. Captain Watson made a very compelling case for further encounters." He leaned his head against John's. "Don't deny the fine men and women of the world of a first-time experience with
you. What in the bloody hell are you doing on my property? I have a good mind to call …” His voice trailed off and Sherlock quirked an eyebrow ironically. “Well,
"No, but I --" John glared at him so murderously that his voice faltered. "No."
John watched with interest, licking his lips lightly. "Have to admit, I don't often see bodies like yours in clinic." He ran his fingers tentatively over Sherlock's chest, smiling when he shivered slightly. Sherlock looked down and John leaned in, rubbing his nose against the side of Sherlock's for just a moment before he looked up and tilted in to claim his mouth. At first the kiss was sweet, cautious, both men smiling as their lips moved together. Then Sherlock opened his lips and shifted slightly, flicking his tongue teasingly against John's. The doctor reached a hand up to pull him closer, exploring his mouth eagerly for several long moments before breaking away to nip at his neck and collarbone as he slid Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders.
John clenched his jaw to keep it from falling open and debated. It wasn't really any of his business, of course, and John wasn't a prude by any stretch. But Sherlock seemed to be waiting for the question and so he satisfied his curiosity. "How many people have you slept with? Sex, not actual sleep, of course."
. She shook out a small blue pill and swallowed it with a handful of water from the tap. She could hardly deny needing a bit of neurochemical help, given how the day before had gone.
, this was not merely the now-familiar influx of serotonin and dopamine caressing his brain. He needed to claim, be claimed, know that John was in him and he was in John and dear
"Agreed," murmured Sherlock against his lips. He showered light kisses on John's face, letting him come down from his orgasm for a few minutes before pressing his neglected cock against John's thigh in gentle reminder.
John wiped his hand on his abandoned T-shirt and tossed it to Sherlock to mop up the bit that had gotten on his belly. "That was incredible," he said as he climbed back in beside Sherlock. "Don't you dare let me sleep through that ever again."
Then her nurse walked in and asked after her arm, and she suddenly had to push away the sensation of a heavy man's hot breath on her face. But she managed to smile, say that it was nothing, she'd injured it at the gym. Mark didn't ask for further details, thankfully, and they problem solved the best way to juggle their cases for the day.
John's stomach sank as the truth hit him. "Oh, Sherlock."
Sherlock responded in kind, his tongue warm and soft, his lean body alert but eager. Pulling him closer, John kissed Sherlock slow and deep. He shifted, pressing a steadying, reassuring hand to the back of Sherlock’s head as he insinuated his other hand under the back of his shirt to stroke his fingers over smooth, pale skin. Sherlock shivered, crushing his face forward, tugging at John’s shirt until it was loose from his trousers. Suddenly, clothes seemed like too much of a barrier, and John was desperate for skin-on-skin. He pulled Sherlock’s T-shirt up, breaking apart long enough to fling it away before diving back in, kissing frantically as he unbuttoned his shirt. By the time it was on the floor, Sherlock had managed to kick off his bottoms and pants without breaking the kiss and was tugging on John’s belt. Together, they managed to divest John of the rest of his clothes rather quickly.
