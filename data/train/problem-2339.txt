“Oh, there you are! You climbed up that tree, Good Lord! How did you even manage that???”
“Jim… I am…. I am trying….”
“Except that I will make it up to you,” John said, bright idea striking him at that moment, “Why don’t we move this date to tomorrow?”
Jim looked like a wet dream come true, dressed in all black with his eyes lust-filled, his movements catlike and sexy, his cologne subtle yet tantalizing. His hairs begged for caresses, his full lips invited kisses and when he dropped his trousers and kicked off his shoes, showing that he wore no underwear underneath, Sebastian was almost orgasming on his feet. He had been kept waiting for almost two weeks and could barely hold himself back anymore. Once in the cave was nowhere near enough.
“Tell me, help me make a decision please. This one or that one or this one over here?”
“No, it is called influencing and sheltering, something close friends and associates, sometimes partners share. Don’t you have a similar bond with Sherlock? I know, I know, Jim and I never started off on the right wavelength with the two of you but I was kind of hoping all that is behind us now and we can…..what happened, John?”
“You have plenty of courage, I am sure.”
“Good to see you,” John said with an equally warm smile.
“Only a little stroll after dinner.”
“I changed my mind Sherly boo,” Jim snickered, “I am not going to wait for months to get my hands on something that’s lying around in abundance in that mansion. I saw some paintings, I saw silver and goldware that are worth millions and I have only seen the tip of the iceberg.”
“You’ve been watching me?” He asked, voice husky from sleep. He stretched his long limbs, burrowing further into his man’s arms.
The other man had fallen with his bag and briefcase too so there was nothing for him there. Scared out of his mind at how a simple mugging had resulted in the loss of his accomplice and a possible murder, he ran from there as fast as he could.
“I am not just saving you but an innocent man. You trust me, right?”
“What’s there?” He asked.
John exhaled, “I am not a coward really.”
“Oh don’t even go there because sympathy I have none. Not for you at least. Not after what you have done lately. I got to know a very rare and extremely expensive piece of jewelry was sold in the market recently and a Swedish noblewoman, a first cousin of the king, she bought it for a grand price of 154 million. Yeah, I am talking about that gorgeous neckpiece in my mummy’s collection, one only you had seen with your own eyes. You also knew the combination to the two levels of locks on the door, the manual as well as the biometric code.”
Sherlock finished his milk and picked up a glass of water, draining that too. He pursed his lips and pulled the blanket up. “Don’t think too much Jawn. Sometimes you’ve got to let it go.”
John reacted, “What do you mean simple? It is not. I am in quite a situation here. You see, there is also this woman, a very bright and nice woman, who I am sort of dating for nearly eight and half months.”
“He loved one, slept with many.”
“Instead you went away, you chose to leave me.”
Greg Lestrade shook his head, “No, none at all. None whatsoever. It’s been extremely peaceful.” Mrs. Hudson instantly reinforced the statement, “Yes, ours is a crime-free village and we have not really seen any such incidents. But these city slickers, they come in, they are drunk, they do all sorts of weird things, stay out late and then come back with ridiculous tales. I think those girls got scared of some stray or something.”
“I see,” Mycroft seemed to relent, “It is a very unfortunate situation for the poor old lady. How long will you be keeping her at our…. I mean at
“Why would they go?” Sherlock objected before either of the two men could answer, “You haven’t seen anything or noticed any unusual stuff, have you Jawn? What about you Seb? What would you do? Stay here or leave for town?”
“No way, he is still my boss and shall always be.”
“Um….”
“Oh yeah sure,” Jim said innocently, rolling over on the bed and spreading his legs wide apart. He held his butt cheeks apart, exposing the tiny furled opening that made Sebastian salivate and squirm. “Come and get me!”
“I need to….”
“Why?” Sherlock said coldly, “Have I ever told you I’ll do exactly what you say? Have I asked for a conversation? Did I even ask why you chose to throw her on my face one fine evening, at a point in time when you had almost proposed to her? It seems she insisted that we meet, otherwise you were probably planning to tell me only when a John Junior was on the way.”
The sounds of moans and bed creaking, headboard tapping and the occasional cry, a steady and rhythmic sound of flash slapping against flesh could be clearly heard from the guest room that was across the hallway and the grand hall of the villa. “Maybe it’s because everything is so quiet,” Sebastian mused, “Fancy being heard so clearly if you are just a little bit noisy while fucking.” Jim shook his head, “No, I am sure they left the door open….” He stepped across the hallway even as Sebastian started climbing the stairs. A second hallway branched off the other end of the sitting room/hall and he got a start as he peered. Then he quickly joined Sebastian midway up the stairwell and whispered, “Buggers left the door half open. If they closed it things wouldn’t have been so loud!”
“Oh, I am sorry. I wish I could offer the same sympathy that many do, like saying ‘she is in a better place’ and all that. But the truth is, we don’t know what happens when a person passes. For me, whatever I am able to do while I am still alive and breathing is what’s important. It’s the only life we lead and the only legacy we leave behind.”
He went to the address, which was in a quiet and cobbled street that branched off the busy and bustling Les Halles area. Only a hundred meters inside, the noise of the main roads, the shoppers and traffic had faded away into a distant din. The narrow lane, which was mainly useful for pedestrians and could be used by a single vehicle at one time, widened out into a sort of a cul-de-sac area which had three properties around it. One was high-rise apartment building. The other was a huge bungalow with a long driveway, post which its acreage started. The third and central one was an old-fashioned Parisian house, occupying five floors, with a quaint courtyard and arched doorway.
“Our landlady. She is waiting outside to meet you.”
“No. I was with my friend who lives in the town. I got to know after she and her husband dropped me to your house this morning.”
John took a deep breath and let out a joyless chuckle. “I was suddenly faced with too much emotional trauma. Sherlock, about seven years ago several things happened in my life. Wait, let me take a step back, the first blow I got was my mother’s death which happened eighteen years ago. I was her favorite, her refuge. She was my best friend and I was hers. When I lost her, that too due to suicide, I was inconsolable and lost. I became a total stranger to my own father. After years of being away from home and not talking to my dad for several of them, I suddenly got the news that he had died. That brought back fresh regret and guilt for me, that I had allowed one particular tragedy to prevail so much over my life that it resulted in another. Confused, uptight, not having anyone to lean on, mainly because of trust issues I always had, I made another blunder.”
“Mr. Watson…. He wants to see you in his study Mr. Bouffler. Not at the home office…. in his study.”
Greg interrupted and shushed her. “Sergeant Donovan will you please shut up!”
“I’ll keep the connecting door between our rooms open,” Irene offered and Molly smiled with relief, clearly appreciating that gesture. Anthea gave Irene a look of pleasant surprise as they walked out, “That was a mighty nice thing to do, especially for someone as practical as you.”
When he woke up for the sixth time in six hours, he saw John was awake too and clearly in discomfort. When he sat up in alarm, the older man grabbed his arm and said, “Don’t worry. It’s just my own body rebelling the lack of alcohol which I have been providing it liberally with, over the past two weeks. But it’s not so bad that I need rehab. We can manage, together, if you’re with me.”
“My friend is hurt, please.”
) I was pretty reassured they were beyond those days of blind fury and that incessant bloodthirst.
“Don’t say it,” Mycroft showed a rare moment of angst.
“What the hell happened man?” The blond man was stunned, sitting still with his hands still clasping the wheel, “Where did it come from?”
“I-I am… I hadn’t heard you come in…”
Not much was left to imagination.
“Seriously?”
When John emerged half an hour later from the bathroom, having used the facilities, shaved, brushed and showered, Sherlock was fast asleep on his bed, completely buried under the covers. The young doctor pulled out some clothes from his overnight bag, a pair of comfortable denims and a full sleeved T-shirt, and walked into the closet to change into them. He heard Sherlock’s phone ringing outside somewhere but the man on his bed snored on. Shaking his head, John walked out of the bedroom only to stop in his tracks abruptly.
The two men left and Mycroft walked over to his brother and his friends.
“Colonel Moran sir,” he quickly grabbed some of the items from the man who towered over him, “Sorry about the delay. Mrs. Hudson is busy so I had to come down all the way….what happened now?”
Jim frowned, sitting up, “I suppose they will be staying at the inn here then.”
And it was the bedroom I took him to a little later when I found his frustrations had reached a proportion which couldn’t be controlled by a little talk. Instead we needed to make love, an act he didn’t indulge himself in very often but when he did he came out of the act a new person almost. He felt refreshed, energized and happy! So, without any further ado, I went on to remove his robe and pajamas and pleasure him as much as I could with my hands and mouth. Much as I adored being inside him, I knew his chagrin at getting straight to the act. “Even the best dinner need a bit of prior preps my dear Watson,” he told me once, “A drink, a nibble, an appetizer etc.”
He saw the car leave. Sherlock’s car.
John knew better than to do that! Oh well, it was only noon and he was almost back home. It could have been worse. Like that time when he was detained twenty-four hours or the time he found himself taken to Switzerland! A half scowl on his face he parked his car and rushed upstairs, hoping that Sherlock was still at home and not taken up any case. Taking three steps at a time, the super-fit doctor reached the flat in no time and flung the door open. “Sherl….baby boy…..pumpkin….I am
“Wow,” Sherlock gasped and panted as they drew back finally, “So this is how people kiss. I always thought it was unhygienic. I can barely do this to revive someone, they call it the kiss of life, ah, now I know why they call it the kiss of life because this is what kissing is……”
Mrs. Hudson met them briefly as they came back to the house around 4-30 pm. While they were walking in through the front door, she was coming down the stairwell with their overflowing laundry bag. Good old woman always repeated ‘I am not your housekeeper’ and yet did all the duties of one. They wished her good afternoon and she even made a comment like ‘It seems you guys renewed some vows lately, you both look different.’ Sherlock obviously ignored her and walked upstairs while John offered a polite smile, shared a word or two and thanked her for the laundry.
“I know it’s been trying times lately and we have seen multiple occasions of people distressed, injured or even dead. Might not be the best time to speak of this but all these things have made us painfully aware of the morality and unpredictability of life. I don’t wanna waste any more time thinking or contemplating or deliberating. William Sherlock Scott Holmes, I ask you on bended knee for your consent to marry me. Please accept this ring and tell me you’d like to spend your whole life with me. May I remind you my right kneecap was broken once so I can’t be on my knees for a long time.”
For the longest moment John continued to pant and whine softly, eyes opening and closing as he tried to relish as well as get over the ecstasy that he had just experienced. When he finally emerged from that haze and looked down his body, he saw Sherlock staring up at him through blazing eyes, a hint of a smile at the corner of his luscious lips.
“Wow, is it that bad???”
“It’s about me….actually not me, but about my housemate….no, not him either, it’s actually just a question I wanted to put across,” John said after stammering and hesitating. “Sure, go ahead,” Carol said and waited patiently, putting her fork down. John deliberated and hesitated, formed the words and then pushed them away, until she reached out over the table and put her hand over his. “Listen to me John, all of us have issues, including me and my kind,” her tone was understanding and yet, objective, “On certain days
“Yes baby boy?”
Jim was practically on Sebastian’s lap by then. “This is too much Sebby,” he looked at the mountain bike he was given. “On the contrary,” Sebastian looked at the latest model sunglasses Jim had gifted him, “I think even that is not enough. These shades are really cool, thanks babe!”
find it
“What the fuck…….”
“Huh? What?”
It will be slow build....by my own standards LOL! Be patient. When smut happens, I promise it will be hot!
The sounds of flesh slapping on flesh could be heard in the darkness of the room as the two men, engaged in their passionate interlock of limbs, moved in perfect harmony on the bed. Sherlock’s back arched as John dug deeper into his heated sheath and almost instantly his inner muscles began clamping down on John’s thick manhood.
John found that very intriguing but he had too much else to handle to think of eccentric geniuses. “Good to know and good for that man,” he said, “Now, as for my accommodation, how do you think Molly can help me? Where do I find her, after this?”
“Better than that. He will be here this weekend. Saturday morning I shall bring him over to your estate. If that’s okay with you too.”
But he hadn’t been as happy as he should have been. Despite the success, the accolades, his brother in law Roger introducing him to a couple of eligible men, his heart had remained in his hometown, with John. He had seriously missed the man. But life had been busy and he didn’t want to come across as desperate either, hence he hadn’t called John on the hospital lines. Now of course he wanted to meet him the soonest he could.
“Call me Sherlock, please.”
“I do but they’re out for a week. You and I could go back there.”
Shedding off the last of his fears and worries, embarrassment, scruples and inhibitions, Sherlock took off the swim trunk and went totally nude as John began to make that intercom call to his valet. In a shiny glass sheet before him, the green eyed man saw John stare fixedly at his naked butt and back as he lay down on top of a towel he’d draped over the recliner. He purposefully chose that position, so John couldn’t see his erection yet.
“Do what?”
“I see this pleases you more than the last decision.”
What on earth was Sherlock doing here? If Molly was right he was waiting for Charles Magnussen! Oh shit, he was going to actually complain about him? Oh shit! So Sherlock knew about him, he had spotted him stalking him in the mornings and evenings and also figured out where he worked. He didn’t want Charles or Mike to hear anything adverse about him. No way.
“Then stop doing that. Accept it, you and I are meant to be together. If you really want my happiness then this is where it lies. God damn it.”
“Seems okay to me for now,” John said, “We had a bit of snow last night….anyways. Sherlock, which one is your room?”
“Alley behind the restaurant sir, now. You exit through the front door, take two rights and you’ll be there. I shall be waiting. Five minutes is all I ask for.”
The stony ground that she fell on didn’t even echo her death. Moments later two nurses and a doctor on duty rushed into her room and gasped when they turned the lights on. “Gosh, she jumped,” one of the nurses screeched. “Hold yourselves together,” the doctor decided to be sensible. “We need to call the cops and the administrator and also alert her family. Poor guys, they had just gone to get a change of clothes for the night.”
“If they are contained, it’s as good as a death sentence.”
“You have just seen God,” Jim said, licking his lips and bringing his face close to Sebastian’s to allow him to lick it off his face, “That’s cute!”
John was about to stop Sherlock from blabbing any more nonsense when a strange thing happened. “Show me a pic of this boy,” Eugenia said unexpectedly.
“Huhhh!!! The guests will
“Friend?” John frowned.
Still, he aided Sherlock’s grabby and eager hands as his clothes went flying all over the place. Suddenly cold air kissed his skin and he knew he was stark naked, Sherlock rubbing and moaning against him, eager for
“John,” she shook him by his hand, “John, where did you get lost?”
“What does sleeping late on a weekend have to do with making breakfast and being old enough?” Sherlock scratched his head and stared in bewilderment at his brother, “I am hungry. I need to eat something. What did you have for breakfast?”
Then they had started talking, spending quite some time listening to Sherlock’s theories about crime and criminals and John’s account of the war. Then, at some time during midnight, John had moved to the bedroom assigned to him. Sherlock had stayed back….
, John grew decidedly relaxed and comfortable in her presence and company. She was an interesting person, knew a lot about various topics and was also a good listener. After a bit of formal talk and knowing each other, she said she would be staying overnight and hence she’d need a room. John, seeing no other option, said she could take Sherlock’s bedroom while Sherlock could take his room while he slept on the couch that night. Again Sherlock poked his long nose into the conversation and made a tactless comment. “We will stay in your room, like we usually do,” he said, on his tenth cookie now, “Mummy likes to watch movies late into the night and I think she will need the couch.”
As for me, I have noted all of this in my diary and my heart. I would never speak of it, nor will my partner or even Irene, the only three besides John and Sebastian to know the deadly secret. When I do reach the twilight of my life, I shall tear those pages and burn them, just to be safe.
“Very well,” Sherlock shrugged, “Why this hesitation? He is welcome to spend time with me and once he is better…..”
“But why there…. the pool house…..” Sherlock tried to ask, confused by Jim’s sudden arrival after two weeks of being incommunicado. But Jim had disconnected in his usual rude manner.
“What’s the hurry, we could at least have breakfast together,” John said, looking rather radiant and happy, “It’s a Sunday after all and the roads will be empty. You’ll be back in a jiffy. Breakfast is at nine, if you wait just one more hour….. what say?”
There was silence on the other side but he could hear quickened breathing, could almost feel the tension through that silence. Except that….the breathing sounds and tension were not from Janet but the man right next to him. Sherlock was glaring at him and the moment he looked back, the detective got up from his seat and walked towards the toilets. Baffled by the reaction, John decided to call off the date for now. There was always next week.
“A bit eccentric, anti-social, doesn’t care for traditions, he is perfect, there couldn’t be a better person than him to do this,” he grinned, “And he needs the money. Money will give him the freedom he desires. He wants to travel the world, start his own work, become an inventor.”
“More to come from there,” John said mischievously and headed straight for the bedroom with Sherlock in his arms.
The bed shook gently, just like the gentle breeze that blew across the room, Sherlock’s eyes kept tearing up and droplets rolled down the side of his face as he wrapped his arms and legs around his lover, wishing he could just disappear somehow into John.
“Going where?”
Until that time of our lives arrived where our mundane city life changed completely and we moved in the great countryside, to a nice posh and picturesque little town named West Eden. Us would be mummy, daddy, me, Eurus and Sherlock, along with our family dog Redbeard. It was the autumn of the year 2010 and I was thirty, finally at that point of my life where I was not only financially independent but also ready to start a family with my boyfriend James Moriarty. James had moved to West Eden six months ago, working as the chief research officer at the huge ‘Space Research Institute’ located in this town, therefore it was an added incentive for me to move there too. Eurus was twenty-five and engaged to an American chemical engineer who was on a three month deputation to UAE. She was staying with us for the time being. Sherlock was twenty-two and had graduated the previous year, about three years earlier than most post-grad students from Cambridge. He was well on his way to complete his thesis on forensic science. A genius just like the rest of us, he was also insular, somewhat sociopathic but at the same time a fragile and beautiful young man that couldn’t be trusted to be on his own. Therefore,
Sherlock sighed, “Myc, this is not ‘my house’, this is as much your house as mine. We both grew up here! Am I not welcome in your house on Mayfair in London? The same way, you have a say in whatever happens here at Hilltop Maison. As for Mrs. Finch, her family is actually very happy to see her sheltered by someone other than them. They won’t create any problems at all. If you see her, talk to her, trust me you won’t be worried for me. She is a very kind-hearted and affectionate woman. Her breakdown was due to the loneliness she was subjected to, especially after her beloved husband died after 50 years of marriage, two years earlier. There is no other strain of madness or being violent, if that’s what’s worrying you.”
His evil voice made Sherlock briefly consider an apology but he had truly transformed in the past two months and become far more confident and vocal. More than that, he was able to hold his own against the bully of a boyfriend he had. “Don’t dare talk about him that way.”
“Yeah,” another one said, “Sleep some and think about ways to become more obedient, more compliant. As soon as you learn a new skill and get a job, you’ll be out of here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. That’s where I got the idea from.” He kissed his man’s bottom sweetly and was about to go dispose the tissues when a thought struck him. “Hey, how did you know about this?”
Greg cleared his throat loudly and meaningfully. “I hope he hasn’t left yet.”
John checked on Sherlock as he asked, noticing scratches and bruises on his face, wrist, a gash near his collarbone and finally, a bandaged foot which was the result of a bad sprain and ligament damage. Without even knowing it, he was standing pressed against Sherlock’s lea frame while the detective leaned on him slightly, his cheek to John’s shoulder.
“Jim-Jam, won’t it be….??”
Back in their bedroom again, he brushed and changed and climbed into bed, curled up with a book and hoped to doze off soon but sleep eluded him. He absentmindedly cuddled John’s pillow and sniffed it, inhaling the scent of his scalp and shampoo.
I promptly gave him one. “You like them too, I see!”
He had forgotten about the children’s governess and a nursemaid and was expecting Sherlock to correct him but strangely the detective didn’t. He remained strangely quiet. John was about to ask him if he was okay and if he was even listening when the detective broke his silence. “I bet they have a real Christmas tree, standing proudly before their marble porch in the midst of their driveway.”
He was supposed to visit her that evening for dinner. She had invited him for a special occasion, his seventy second birthday. A roast chicken dinner with vegetable noodles and some carrot and leek soup on the side. She had even got a bottle of wine, a generous spend for a thrifty one like her.
Sherlock thought for some time and yawned widely. “Yeah, I am tired and I haven’t eaten anything since breakfast so…. Whoa!”
“So we’re going to accept this invite? Set out on the 29
Minutes passed and their pants ceased, giving way to steadier breathing. At that point John wrapped both his arms around his lean, willowy lover and whispered into his ear, “Come on, off to bed for you. I’ll wake you after I’ve made some dinner for you. Have you eaten anything?”
Mycroft sighed, “He is right. We are not in a position to help them if they have killed someone. That is not the right thing to do but…. But before we jump to conclusions, we must see if they killed Redmond or not. Maybe it was someone else, some other killer or animal, we are not sure yet. For example, the forensic report I received doesn’t indicate any human presence around the area, not besides the victim himself and his girlfriend, who….. did she…. Do you think she might have done that in a fit of madness? I mean, there are moment when we all go a bit mad. No one saw the murder, the gruesome death, did they? Why are we assuming that a couple of pranksters are the ones who have murdered?”
Eckhart’s voice was tight. He seemed uncomfortable. He didn’t seem like his usual self, where he was cordial and polite and professional but also very warm and sensitive. It seemed as if he would rather not be doing this, not be talking to Sherlock about this. “Eckhart what is wrong?”
Jim stood quietly and thoughtfully on the precipice, staring a bit fearfully at Sebastian who was taking photographs of the Pagan God whose form was carved out on the rock surface at the top of the cliff they had cycled all the way up to.
After a brief chat with Harry and her partner and Eckhart offering his apologies for misunderstanding him, Sherlock returned to the bedroom around noon to find John waking up again. This time he asked for coffee and after a hot mug of strong black brew he went for a shower and a proper shampoo and conditioning. His hair felt like straw, he said.
Only a few steps down from the porch, he saw a figure scoot away from the street ahead and hide behind some bushes on the side.
Sherlock rubbed the middle of his forehead and approached the table with rushed steps, muttering ‘I am such a numskull.’
John didn’t need a second invitation. His expression changed from mild concern to full-blown lust in a matter of seconds. He lowered Sherlock on the mattress and caressed him with devotion, like he was worshipping the long limbs, the sculpted chest, the smooth skin and artistic hands and feet. When he reached the face and devoured those Cupid bow lips, Sherlock had almost forgotten his woes and was totally immersed in a world of pleasure and sensations. He clutched at John, unwilling to let go, wanton moans pouring out of his mouth as the muscular body, as naked as his own, pressed down and slid along him. There wasn’t even an inch of space between them, chest, abs, thighs, calves and even their faces perfectly aligned.
“Jawn, I am so glad you are okay, how did you……”
“I am worried about Sherlock,” John blurted out.
It took about twenty minutes but Sherlock brought them both off again. They produced trickles this time instead of a deluge of juices but the intensity and effects of it were just as much as the earlier times. As Sherlock fell on top of John, already asleep, the doctor admitted silently that this was by far the best sex he had ever enjoyed in this life.
“He is better now, awake and not damaged. No doctor’s help needed Greg.”
Jim’s sweet tone rapidly changed at that, going dark and sinister. “James? Did you just call me by my full name, like you’ve found your adult voice and your non-existent spine?! What did you just say Sherlylocks? Are you betraying me now, are you? Remember who put you there! I did. I could pull you away from there as well, mercilessly if needed. You could get sued. He has no idea what you’re there for.”
“I love you.”
“It’s called the science of deduction.”
“Jawn, stop. I am not…..”
“Slept with both of them?”
Both the beasts stopped snarling and backed off. The pack of four men ran off howling and screaming in the darkness of the night. Irene got up and ran behind Mycroft, cowering there and begging him in a rambling whisper to protect her, save her life etc. Greg cautiously pointed the gun at the two of them, then sighed and lowered it with a shake of his head. “I can’t,” he said, “Heaven help me but I can’t do this. I have seen them grow up. I’d rather sacrifice my job.” Mycroft the man of steel had tears in his eyes and he whispered in a tremulous voice, “I’ll take the blame on myself I guess. Mummy is fond of Sherlock, he’s her weakness and I don’t want her or dad to suffer. I’d rather stay committed.”
“Precisely so.”
“Dr. Watson?”
“Certainly the formidable foe,” Sally added to that.
Sally raised her brows and lowered them, blushing slightly, then she assumed her usual professional expression. Even she was bowled over. Phil Anderson scowled after the initial reaction of surprise.
and said he would bring along the snack for everyone.
“Yes Grugg, let’s go and check if a demon came out of one of my beakers or jars and attacked your insufferable husband.”
“Very well John.”
Will John Watson regret not accompanying Sherlock and going to a date instead
We are soldiering on, never said it was easy to do so. But time is a big and best healer. Things have become far more tolerable and bearable than the usual days. Will we ever be in love again? I don’t think so. Or maybe we would be. But one thing we both can vouch for, it won’t be the same kind of love we shared with Sherl or Jimmy. They took the curse away with them but blessed us with the satisfaction of having known one great and true love in this life.
Sherlock suddenly giggled and John climbed over him, immobilizing him with a swift movement. He held down his lover and gave him a mock-angry look.
“Tin can….”
“Going home now,” he picked up the briefcase and gift package with a sigh, “Talk tomorrow. Have a good evening and take care of yourself, maybe head home sooner than usual, give yourself some time to relax and catch up on sleep. Mornings are always wiser, believe me.”
But then
“It doesn’t matter who reports it.”
John didn’t eat much but whatever little food he ate, at least he kept it down. Sherlock are heartily. He was starving. He hadn’t eaten anything since a very frugal breakfast that morning.
With a huge smile John went to check on Sherlock so he could thank him too but the youngster was not in the bedroom or the den he normally frequented. When John couldn’t find him anywhere in the house and even his phone went unanswered, the blond man felt a panic he hadn’t felt since a long time. Not since I lost mum. I am just as scared to lose him now. Gosh, this boy is an enchanter. He has simply taken my heart and soul away and he hold my fate in the palm of his hand.
Two fiery and glowing eyes. They were not the regular eyes of an animal. She had once had dogs and knew how their eyes glowed in the darkness. These were otherworldly, definitely not normal. “We’re done for,” she murmured, preparing for the worst.
It worked again and the lady, whose name John learned as Claire, got up and left, looking hugely disturbed and tense. John murmured ‘Don’t worry, things will be fine, Sherlock Holmes is on the case’ as she passed by and she gave him a grateful smile. John always soothed ruffled feathers and distressed souls while Sherlock did the cold, hard calculations in the background. Once the door closed, John threw a quizzical glance at his housemate and co-investigator. “It’s not like you to ask for money like this, unless the client offers it on their own.” He saw no reaction from his friend and added, “You didn’t even text me asking me to come home sooner. If there’s a client you usually do that.”
It was a bit dark that evening, despite the approaching summer. The sun was hardly visible and due to the shade of the trees, her yard was fairly dark already. About twenty feet ahead was the bank of the river and perhaps because of the possibility of rain, no kids were canoeing nor was any boat to be seen from her kitchen window.
“Yes, sure Mr. Watson…. I mean, John.”
The town was small but neat, pretty and quite prosperous. The carriage sent for them were drawn by four horses, had a family insignia on it and was a closed, luxury coach. John didn’t think too much of that. If Mycroft was here, he must have organized for it.
Sherlock registered the touch but didn’t really react. He didn’t have the strength or wakefulness to do so. It had been an early start to the day and, due to his habits of sleeping late, he hadn’t really hit the sack early the night before. Coupled with all the excitement and frolic of the day, the long drive and the galivant around the ranch, he suddenly found his eyelids weighing down heavily. He yawned again, feebly putting his palm over his mouth to cover it. “I-I am sorry…..” Sherlock rubbed his eyes, unaware of how cute he looked and how John’s eyes had been fixated on the slight show of his pink tongue, “I don’t mean to be rude but I can’t keep my eyes open anymore.”
Jim looked squarely at Mycroft, shifted his glance over to the DI, then spoke in a wicked tone. His chocolate brown eyes glowed with mischief, “Says the one who can’t keep it in his pants even during the so-called dinner get-together? Look here Detective Inspector Lestrade, if you criticize me and my choice of jokes and references then I shall let your in-laws and Mycroft the Iceman’s parents, who have just arrived and are on their way up now, know that you happened to be kissing their son’s pee-pee in the bathroom five minutes ago.”
He came around the desk and took Sherlock’s hand, “Come on, let’s go to bed.”
So he had accepted her invite for the dinner party where, from right under his nose, one of the thirty guests at the party had stolen the diamond ring meant for her engagement. The delicious looking turkey was on the table, getting cold, the pudding was hot and ready to be served and the flutes ready for the champagne that was soon to be popped, yet no one was able to start dinner. All because of the damned ring that had disappeared from Miguel’s pocket. The box was still there but there was no ring inside it.
“Your gran said….”
“Yes and I will punch you again if you dare to act like a loser once more.”
John took a deep breath and decided to take charge of things. “Mrs. Hudson, call your boy gang to clean this up,” he said gently pushing her out of the room, “And lower that gun, I doubt if it still works.” She complained about Sherlock being so rude and violent and destroying the wallpaper to which John said he would draw something with spray paint around those bullet holes and make it look like a smiley face. “I won’t let it stand out in an ugly manner, don’t you worry, let’s get creative,” he soothed her, “As for him, I think it’s hunger pangs plus anger due to being at home all the time. He is ‘hangry’.”
“Explain,” he said.
They were very special people and their passion, love, devotion and eventually their salvation was not the usual thing you would find in this world. Big things happened to them in their short lifetimes and naturally the end was also grandiose, in the hands of nature and yet voluntary, a sacrifice made for the greater good. None of them left with any malice or regrets in their hearts. If they did, we would have felt their presence. But we don’t. We know they are gone and what truly remains behind is only our remembered moments with them, their souls which left imprints on our souls, their laughter.
But to
“Was that true?” Reginald asked solemnly.
Sherlock and John stumbled out of the car together, drunk. Twinkling street lights, Christmas carols playing in stores, the sight of people walking about with huge shopping bags told them the festive season was right there on the doorstep, but right now all they could think of was the case they had recently solved.
“Actually…. No. I would have fled.”
Sebastian gave him a startled look, “Sherlock? You mean that kid you introduced us to the other day, when we visited? You are getting married to him? Already?”
. I mean John Doe, who is he really…. But there’s always a chance they don’t have his real identity either! Anyways, we know now that Sherlock’s life might be in danger and we gotta take some quick measures to secure him.” Phil shook his head, “I don’t understand boss, how the hell are we supposed to do that? He gets irritated if we try to warn him. That man has made it very clear he doesn’t want us to interfere and naturally he will not want any of our people to be stationed there. And in case we try some trick or force and wrench that fellow away from him he’ll be far more annoyed and upset with you than he already is.”
When their laughing ceased, Jim gave Sherlock a small pleading whine, then changed it to the whines of a dog. “Yew-Yew-Yew-Yew-Yew, pleeeeaaassee!” His big brown eyes stared soulfully at Sherlock who threw up his arms in the air in sheer frustration. “Alright, I give in now.”
“Who’s letting you go?” Jawn yawned, eyelids growing heavier as he somehow managed to tumble down on the mattress next to his lover, “Christ, I can barely stay awake. It was such a huge one, I’m literally unable to keep my eyes open.”
Sherlock thought for a while and said, “Yes, no harm in meeting him. I suppose I am not making any commitments yet. It’s open from my side, might be a ‘yes’ and it might be a ‘no’ too.”
“I guess that phrase by created by those who think there are non-real men in this world,” John snorted and then playfully ruffled Sherlock’s hairs, “Hey, I am sorry okay? I really am. I didn’t mean to run away, I was just trying to get out of your way and get you out of my system until I realized you’re with me even when you’re not. You have cast a spell, some sort of black magic effects on me and I don’t think I can shake it off.” He paused, took Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissed his forehead, “Darling I don’t want to shake it off. You’re that microchip that’s embedded into my soul and no matter how many surgical attempts are made to separate us, we simply won’t be able to.”
Two weeks into his return and one day before Sherlock’s birthday, John got a call from Greg Lestrade. Excited, he answered the call and almost immediately started rattling off his success story with Sherlock. “It’s not just Sherlock and Phil who seem to have noticed the changes in me, I made some of my colleagues and employees realize who the boss is,” John said excitedly, “I want you to come to my office and observe. You’ll be assured I am not exaggerating. Your training and mentoring has helped me garner respect all around, even with my colleagues.”
John’s voice brought him back to the present. “Unbelievable! I really like those too. I was just wondering if young people nowadays are still fond of plays and theater as much as they love movies with all those CGI and sound-play and 4D experience and all that.”
“Yes,” Greg said, “Unfortunately, I am the one who….. Mycroft, CAREFUL.”
to interfere or take sides. It only makes thing worse than they already are.”
“You are both wrong,” Greg said with a glowing smile, “Yes, I mean it.
“Would you just call me Sherlock or Lockie or Will, whatever you prefer! My aunt won’t stop sending me photos of women would she? She failed with my elder brother and now she intends to convert me. Hehe. Send me a cup of tea please!”
Sherlock comically choked on his mouthful and had to be thumped on the back and offered some water. He drank a few gulps and rolled his eyes at John, “I am supposed to be the one to say that because your food surely did the trick. I mean, from my stomach to my heart, way to a man’s heart, whatever they call it!” John kissed him lightly on the lips and said, “I mean it. Not a trifling matter. I love you, I always have. The moment I laid my eyes on you, seven weeks and three days ago, I knew I had found the most special person of my life and I’d never let him go.”
“I….what do I do?” Sherlock said, looking left and right, “As the crowd things they will notice what’s happened down there.” He looked decidedly more prudish and less brash than he had at the Buckingham Palace, where he had arrived in just a white sheet,
“We sure did,” Sebastian said with a smile.
“Excuse me boss but I have to support her too,” Phillip butted in, supporting Sally, “Once when my brother had been booked for DUI and I was grouching about that, a wise Inspector told me that our feelings often cloud our judgment, which is why it’s best for a lawkeeper to remain unattached or, at least, not be involved in cases related to their loved ones, friends etc. I think that inspector is a superintendent now and going back on his own words.”
No second thoughts spared, he just pushed his pants down to his thighs and grabbed the bae of his once again hard cock and slid inside.
“Hold on,” Sebastian changed his tune, “We are friends, okay? No matter what we have to do or like to do, if you girls need our help that’s always there. Right John?”
Apparently, there were many things wrong in that sentence which John didn’t hesitate to point out. One – We were not in a mere ‘relationship’. We are married and therefore I should have used the word ‘marriage’ instead of relationship. Apparently, I undermined our marriage by omitting the word ‘married partner’ in that sentence. Two – I am supposedly a man with a Boomer mindset. In today’s world people are simply partners and gender divides should not be quoted in terms of duties and responsibilities. So a wife can earn and a husband can cook, a wife can take the car for servicing and a man can buy eggs and milk from a grocery store. Three – The implied meaning in my sentence made John feel less of a man and he had high objections to that.
“God, he used to do that before too?”
Three months ago, while waiting for a cab during a torrential downpour, John had spotted Sherlock for the first time. It had not been the perfect romantic setting, since it was dull and grey, wet and cold and there were puddles and slush around them instead of the proverbial roses, birds chirping, nature at her beautiful best and warm golden sunshine. Still, to John it was the most romantic moment of his thirty two year old life on this planet, when he had first seen Sherlock. Actually he had seen the man’s reflection in the glass window of the shop whose steps he was standing on. A tall, slim dark haired man with sparkling eyes and a shy, withdrawn demeanor. He was different, so different from all the other young men around him. Something made him stand out and that was what intrigued John the most.
John also realized Sherlock had no sense of personal space, nor did he ever intend to split the chores and errands. While Mrs. Hudson provided breakfast and tea in the morning and tea once again in the afternoon, John was left to work in the kitchen and rustle up lunches and dinners.
“Hey you want an apple?”
Sherlock was in short underpants. He looked at John, a bit dazed, and then at the sack of Chinese food, the bottle of Australian Rosé and the tub of ice cream. “Okay come on in then,” he said, “You’re staying here tonight it seems.”
. The next time, do not eavesdrop or barge into my cabin again.”
“I can’t believe I am jumping to conclusions right at the beginning and perhaps way too soon,” she began, giving him some papers to sign, “He’s only been here for a day and already I’m passing a verdict. But sometimes morning shows the day and we need to be optimistic, positive, hope for the best.” She gave John a blueprint to look at, “Here is the plan for the resort you wanted to build, the base work is done! So, as I was saying, after a long time I am seeing you in a lighthearted, cheery mood. He is good for you, like a breath of fresh air and an electric presence around the property. The retainers are on tenterhooks, to say the least.”
“Maybe around fifty grand. That’s my share of the money I have left.”
His dad, mum, friends, sister, boyfriend, stint in the army, his work, business, employees, everything. He remembered the way things had gone downhill, the deaths of his loved ones, his feelings of anger and vengeance, then his attempt to kill the man responsible for it all.
John rubbed his face down with his hands, eyes burning, body tired beyond tired. Nothing will change this. I just had sex with my housemate. I had sex with a man.
John looked at Sherlock. For the first time since the night before, Sherlock actually looked into his eyes. He had been subtly avoiding John all the while, even during the two hour ride to the Holmes family’s stately countryside home. “It’s ‘our James’ now?” The detective muttered.
Eventually the party was over and John was treated to the delicious sight of a naked Sherlock who dropped his clothes in the hallway with a suggestive grin of promise. The libidinous urges in the doctor, which had been strangely stoked by the sight of Jim caressing Sherlock’s rump imagined visuals of Sebastian in a professor’s suit and glasses fucking into a squealing Jim in baggy jeans and hoodie, poured out like a dam and he picked Sherlock up and tossed him down on their new mattress.
“Jawnnnnn,” Sherlock’s body gave a great jerk and his hips pushed up involuntarily. John bore down at the same time, driving straight into his man, his balls slapping noisily against the milky mounds of Sherlock’s arse cheeks.
Weed! John had been smoking weed.
“Yeah and not only because he’s my son. Because sometimes people deserve forgiveness. Because no one is beneath forgiveness. Because happiness won’t land on our laps, we must grab it. We need to create our own happy world amidst all the chaos, anarchy and deceptions around us. She waited for things to become right and when they did, she found a reason to reject them.”
She didn’t even register the question. She didn’t blink. Not a word came out of her mouth.
“Sorry,” Sherlock said and rushed over to John, forgetting his anger. He was just very happy to see John back.
“That’s it,” the beleaguered doctor grumbled, “I am never sharing a room with him again.”
Before Sherlock could actually say something to ‘John the cat’, he saw another funny character. First he heard her voice, the sanctimonious tone easily identifiable. “Witless human, witless human,” someone chimed.
“Very much so. In fact I would have sung that for you but my voice….. Um, no, leave it. I don’t wanna scare your neighbors.”
Later, as they emerged from the house again, Sherlock came to the gate to see them off. “I believe even your pet was not spared,” Greg mentioned. “Excuse me?” Sherlock lowered his brows, “I didn’t understand…. Oh sorry, yes we did lose our pet. Though it was more of Hugh’s pet. You know, he was mum’s secretary. Right now he sort of runs errands, helps with the electrical fittings and plumbing, occasionally sorts out my papers etc. KitKat was his pet. From the army days. Sixteen year old Fox Terrier.”
“He is neither a blackmailer nor a conman. It’s John who is mistaken. And not one more unflattering word about him, not even from you.”
Sherlock pretended to be shocked but deep down he was enjoying this too, John could tell. Oh the varied workings of an eccentric mind belonging to a brilliant man! The lips opened and Sherlock slut-swallowed John’s huge appendage, letting it glide straight down his throat until the tip of the throbbing erection hit the back of his palate. The sensations were exquisite and John groaned like an animal in the stupor of a rut.
Sherlock literally fell asleep in a flash. Soon he was breathing shallow and even, like a small child. He lay very still, eyes closed and a single hand sticking out of the covers, clutching at the edge of the pillow. Beams of the room lights and moonlight fell across his sleeping form and John had to admit, quietly to himself, that while he hadn’t exactly chosen Sherlock for his looks, that attractive face and long, flowing, sexy form was definitely a bonus!
this man’s brains out!!!!!
“Thank you dad!!!”
That was why, when he was wrapping up, he didn’t even have the energy to hold his phone to his ear. He took the call on speakerphone and that too because it was his husband of five years, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, calling him for the fifth time since afternoon. “Sherlock doesn’t call, he usually texts,” he said by means of explanation to the nurse who assisted him, a nice lady named Agnes, “It must be some form of urgency.”
“Right,” Greg replied, “He will not be going to ‘Parthenon’ but to ‘Plot No 5’.”
He walked away from the room, shutting the door softly. As she heard his footsteps recede, Mrs. Hudson felt a sudden urge to stop him and tell him to forget the conversation they just had, tell him to stay back. She wanted to accept that all would be well and John was actually a good man who was neither married nor a nincompoop, someone Sherlock would be proud of. Probably they needed to take things slow,
,” Bergo said sadly.
“It is and I have to attend a dinner at eight-thirty. My return depends on how long the dinner and post-dinner conversations go so chances are that I will be pretty late in coming back home tonight. Perhaps past midnight, so don’t wait up for me. Go to sleep when you’re tired.”
“Yeah, you’re right. He is the lamb.”
. It was John fucking Watson for real. After weeks of seeing imaginary John, Sherlock took a while to understand and accept this was really John who was sitting on a brand new shiny motorcycle, only six feet away from him. He was honking, waving his arm and grinning broadly behind the trendy racer’s helmet. When Sherlock finally smiled back, he took off the helmet and said, “Hop on.”
As the town reels from the shock and the police investigate the sudden murder, Sherlock mentions about some ominous noises overheard in the woods before by a neighbor.
He casually picked up the brochure and made a mammoth mistake by randomly changing the topic. “I think Ford and Volkswagen aren’t enough, I should be looking at some Renault and Lexus models too, don’t you think?”
“Um…. Sherlock, will you be okay?” Greg hesitated.
“Attaboy!” John said, “Don’t let him bully you.”
As she left the shop with her purchase, the salesman stared at her open-mouthed in astonishment. Jim mouthed silently, “Bitch!” Even Sherlock, who was the voice of reason in most situations, glared after her after she had given him a dirty look despite him holding the door open for her courteously.
Harry nodded. A bewildered Mycroft did the same even though he had no clue what these two were up to. But he trusted Greg. Eventually things would be clearer and make sense to him.
“Stud farm is that side, with a full length galloping track.”
The curse has begun to take effect
“I don’t understand.”
Just as the killer tried to press the big round red button, Sherlock suddenly yelled at him from somewhere above. The killer growled and threw a knife at him. John yelled and ran out of his hiding place, gun raised.
“No, I can’t, I can’t imagine Sherlock Holmes being scared of anything at all,” the good doctor said as he gently lay his lover down on the bed and began to work on his clothes. Sherlock aided him by lifting his butt, taking his shirt off and turning to the side so John could expose more and more skin. When he was totally naked except for the plaster on his foot Sherlock shyly whispered, “My biggest fear was that I’ll die a virgin.”
The wind was howling around them and far in the distance a dog howled aloud for a long moment. “Anthea,” Molly had her eyes tightly shut, her heart was thudding so loudly in her ears that she couldn’t hear a thing over those sounds, “Please talk to me. I can’t see, I don’t want to see. Please tell me what is it? Is it some….. creature or monster?”
“We know that. That’s enough.”
“I only take orders from my superiors in the army and I am not even in the army right now. Your barking is not going to make me change my mind. Probably a bullet between your eyes will help drill some sense into you.”
That was all the hopelessness and self-pity Sherlock could take, he could take no more of that shit. He had suffered too and risen above his situation, no matter how much he killed his inner soul to get there. John’s chronic tendencies of blowing things out of proportion and turning everything into some pity-fest had tested his nerves enough and he didn’t want that to be stretched any further than this. He lifted his hand and punched John on the jaw, light enough to not cause any harm or serious pain but hard enough to jolt the five senses out of him. John yelped and fell off the bed with a thump, then his face emerged from the other side of the bed eyes wide as anything, a look of true realization blossoming on his unkempt face.
John felt rather queasy. “My-Mycroft, is Sherlock all right?”
“Maybe it was a very good idea to not call them today. If they turn out to be liars and horndogs then we know where we stand.”
On Friday Sherlock woke him at midnight. “Hey,” he sat up, rubbing his eyes and noting that Sherlock was all limbs and skin, clad in
“Yes, I watched it when it first debuted, about six weeks ago.”
“When? I didn’t get you.”
Sherlock’s response was a keening cry and a drop of precum leaking down his shaft. John licked his lips and then licked the cock like an ice-cream cone.
“Excellent. Congratulations.”
He heard a soft sound of disgruntlement and for the first time his nerves faltered, albeit slightly.
That was when John noticed the wardrobe malfunction.
“Why would he do such a thing?” Sally asked.
“JAWWWWNNN!!!”
“Alright, take a seat then. Be comfortable.”
“Not okay,” Sherlock took his hand in his own, “I am not going in if you don’t. To be honest, none of these things come naturally to me either. I was petrified before I met you and despite all our closeness I was nervy as hell when I had to meet Rosalie. But I managed, right?”
“Ohhhh, I tremble with fear,” Jim mimicked the voice of Scar the Lion from the Lion King movie and aside from the fact that he did have a very pretty (and deceptively innocent) face, he did look like that cunning character. Sherlock put some more distance between them and said through gritted teeth, “Out you go you conniving scum. If I get a chance someday, I’d bash your nose in. But unlike you, I am not a street urchin.”
“Yeah, sorry, I perhaps am. I just got the worst bout of nerves ever. Not even the enemy cannons, shelling and guerrilla attacks scared me as much.”
“Lockie,” Eugenia said, “Did you really steal from your brother and buy bike on your own? Daddy did say you have to wait for it and….and you’re not supposed to steal.”
Sherlock blushed, “Mary!”
John blinked at the sudden sharp tone but didn’t really try to probe or poke. “Very well,” he replied, “Sherl it will be or maybe something else… we can always discuss. You two best be on your way and Sherl, please follow me. We will talk on the terrace. Want some Iced tea?”
When Sherlock came back out, John offered him a tall glass of water. “Drink this or you will dehydrate yourself as you sleep.”
The next moment Sherlock came flying through the door and landed on the ground just before John, on his hands and knees. John’s wits flew out at the same time and he must have let out a groaning sound of distress, because Mycroft and Sherlock both looked at him with concern, one down his six feet two inches frame and the other upwards from his position on the floor.
“Was that Sherlock?” Mary asked, “Are we going somewhere?”
He doubled his efforts at sucking the younger man and crooked his fingers to touch upon the sweet spot in the depths of his lover. A few insistent rubs and he felt the familiar jerk in Sherlock’s cock, followed by his thighs closing and pushing inwards and finally a series of erratic thrusts as Sherlock fucked his mouth to ecstasy. Low rolling moans vibrated around his cock and he let go, about a second after he felt the splatter and outpour of sweet semen on his tongue and then more spurts at the back of his throat.
“I just said it, go figure!”
But none of them seemed to have the intentions of stealing the ring. Even the butler. It wouldn’t solve his problems once and for all and he could have easily chosen a better moment to do it, when he had an alibi. Right now he didn’t and he was least likely to have taken a chance so foolishly.
“Me and my partner,” John said with a broad grin.
Sebastian shot him a curious glance, “I am enjoying being footloose and fancy free. I dip my feet into the waters I like, then I dry myself and walk away. In other words, I am not ready for commitment, I don’t think I will ever be. But I have friends, I have people who will never refuse casual sex with me, I have Jim, I am good really. There is nothing to worry about, my life is right on those tracks I’d like it to be on.”
“You? Confession? You can do no wrong! You’re perfect in every way. A shining example.”
“I didn’t guess. I knew.”
He wasn’t able to finish. A scintillating climax, which consumed him from top to toe, washed over him almost as a rogue wave in sea would overwhelm a ship, the latter too powerless to resist the direction and force of the wave. Supremely aware of his own loss of control and the sensational effects of his climax, Sebastian slammed his foot on the brakes, lifted his hips up hard, put his hand on Jim’s head and pushed him to take him in deeper. Then he shot, thickly enough to almost choke his lover before he let go of those dark locks. Jim pulled his head off the erupting cock just in time not to choke on the load and got a couple of shots across his cheek and his chin instead.
John was fucking Sherlock hard and fast. Sherlock was on the bed on his front and John was on top of him and draped on his back, staring at the spot where they were joined and watching with rapt attention at the sight of his penis appearing and disappearing inside his lover’s body. God that felt so good, so-so-good that he was left speechless. No words could express this amazing feeling unless…..
“Sherl,” John whispered, “Hop on!”
But I have no bloody idea how the murder was committed. In the absence of the murder weapon the culprit will go scot-free Jawn!”
John thought for a few moments and responded, trying not to sound too holier-than-thou and yet getting his point across as politely as possible. “If I earn an income from a job as a doctor, I am still entitled to the pension I receive sir, which is legal and perfectly valid. But if I also get disability cheques, won’t I be double-dipping into the public purse? I don’t mean to say this isn’t legal or I am breaking the law, because you wouldn’t allow that to happen in your watch, but does it still seem fair…..just putting my two cents on the table.” He stopped and looked a bit hesitantly into the other man’s eyes.
“Mycroft but why are you taking his side?” Greg was aghast at the sudden change in the lawyer’s behavior. So far he had been on their side and was badmouthing and criticizing John’s fiancé along with them.
“One word – John.”
Sherlock walked into the bathroom and his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. Even for the
, not even an out of sync groan or huff. Deciding to be a brute as long as he did Sherlock no actual harm, John lubed up, parted Sherlock’s butt cheeks till the wet and pink hole was revealed in all its tempting glory. John bent down and kissed the hole, spreading the sticky inner labia apart until the dark red moistness beyond stared back at him. Amidst that reddish-pink there was a bead of pearly white, his own cum. Intending to fill his lover with more of that, John closed his eyes and pushed inside, sitting on his knees to put minimum pressure on the sleeping beauty’s butt and hips. Sherlock’s body moved an inch up on the mattress but he still didn’t wake up, making John wonder if he had drunk quite a bit whilst waiting for John.
“No, fair demand it is,” John said, caressing the side of his face, “It’s a Sunday evening and you weren’t expecting this. Next time there will be a proper and timely warning. Or maybe the next dinner I attend will not be alone, but in company. Beautiful, gorgeous company.”
“Here comes the pause, for drama effect,” Sebastian muttered. John muffled a chuckle, turning it into a soft cough.
“Are you happy doing this?” Sherlock asked curiously, surprised to see John enjoying himself so much, “Or am I being a bundle of trouble on my very first day here?”
…. Yes, laughing!
, should help.”
Sherlock blushed. “No, I was told that someone with you…. Knows me and is here to see me, so I was confused. I can’t remember if I have met Jim or if we had connected online for some reason. That’s why I was very puzzled. Forgive me.”
“Okay, won’t.”
“Don’t be silly,” Sherlock laughed, “Consider this as your home from now on please.”
“Let’s give them some time,” Jim suggested.
“Simple,” Sherlock shrugged, “The money is great. With this money I shall travel the world for a month, then start my own work, buy a small flat of my own and live rent and mortgage free, buy a car that is better than a scrapheap that I drive right now. The best thing is, this is on limited time and even during this one year or six months I can continue my experiments and do my own thing. I suppose there will be plenty of time.”
Ecstatic at the way he had cornered the great detective and that too without big brother Mycroft or the Scotland Yard inspector Lestrade anywhere close enough to help him this time, Jim snickered and made a triumphant speech. “You see Sherlylocks, your interference has cost me dear and I refuse to let the trend continue. There is room enough for only one of us, not both. So, either I kill you right now or I convert you to my pet. On a leash, at my beck and call, always out of my way when I order you to be so, no will or decision of your own, remote controlled by me all your life. Agree? Choose carefully or you will drop dead in the next five to ten seconds.”
“Oh….” Sherlock couldn’t imagine being in such a position and felt rather concerned, “Is he suffering from mental health issues as a result of this or are there other triggers as well?”
“Thank you.”
Greg shook his head and looked at Jim, who seemed to be as much at unease as the superintendent was. Realizing the feelings that Greg harbored for Sherlock, Jim took it upon himself to deliver the bad news. “I am sure with good lawyers and even you stepping in with a show of support his sentence might be lessened but there will be something waiting for him, at least some sort of a jail term that’s not really in months. Even if Tom’s death is put as accidental, Mary’s won’t be. There was a kidnapping and tampering of security systems, compromising a citizen who was bound and gagged, several things as such. I’d say keep your hopes up but don’t expect an acquittal.”
Sherlock sat behind the wheel and John took his place beside him. Moments later the younger man drove out of the foregrounds of the mansion at breakneck speed, narrowly getting through the gate that was closing down after letting a delivery truck out. The security team shrieked and scrambled to re-open the door and John ducked his head, fearful of being crushed, when Sherlock’s sparkling laughter brought his cheery mood back.
“Talk, follow, salvage, what the hell do you mean?”
Someone was looking for John. They heard a door open, distant footsteps, then someone calling out again. The moment simply ended there and the whole mood and momentum vanished like a bubble in the air.
Sherlock had fallen asleep late the night before, actually as late as 2-30 am. He was totally zonked out when the insistent ringing of his phone woke him up around 7-30 am. Not a naturally effusive and energetic morning person, he was grumpy and half asleep and answered it with a mumbled ‘h’lo’ and nodded off again, until the words brought him back to reality. It was Mary’s voice and she sounded very alarmed and concerned. “Hey,” he rubbed his eyes, “Hi, sorry, I am awake now…. How come you’re calling? Weren’t you supposed to be sailing towards Crete this week?”
“Go,” Jim murmured.
“You sound normal to me, normal is a definition that everyone has a different version of.”
“Rather you be disappointed now and realize the truth sooner than live blindsided and regret it much later when you finally come to grips with the truth,” the older man pleaded, “I know something about the curse of these parts and I have seen the very manifestation of that in someone I had once adored and even contemplated marriage on. Yes, my fiancée Stella, she is the one. She was struck by the curse and she didn’t die by suicide because she was mentally ill. She did that to herself to stop her own macabre ways, she did that to stop the curse from passing on to anyone. Unfortunately it did pass on, maybe in some other way, and it’s your brothers who are now bearers of that curse. Please, you gotta believe me.”
Sherlock jumped down and the knife slashed part of his hairs and, missing him by a whisker, landed straight on the main lines. The electricity crackled, sparks flew and suddenly the place was plunged into darkness.
She smiled without any contempt or judgement and shook her head, “No, you are not John. And even if you’re confused or feel a bit weirded out by yourself right now rest assured many of us have been in your place. What I hear from you is an irresistible attraction between two men, one of who claims to be married to his career and asexual, the other likes to scream from rooftops that he is NOT gay. Well, let me tell you sometimes we are all gay for certain people. It’s a natural instinct, to be attracted to someone who is good looking and charming with a larger than life persona and the sort of brilliance Sherlock carries on each leg is hard not to get impressed by.”
I put in my purple shirt and John’s white shirt. I also put in my pink boxers, a gift from John, along with his grey boxers. After the wash the purple shirt and pink boxers remained the same, but the white shirt and grey boxers came out a lovely shade of mauve and violet respectively. I called John to tell him this but one of the senior nurse assistants took the message. When she heard this she started feeling unwell. Must be
“He has a nice curvy tushy. The boobs, um, well, toilet paper.”
Greg Lestrade looked at the town’s mayor, Lord Edwin, an aristocrat who harbored higher political ambitions. Lord Edwin was listening quietly and intently but had given no inputs of his own. The detective inspector said, “So Mr. Mayor, from what we have so far this is an isolated incident and while we will definitely tighten the security and vigilance around the town, especially the woodland and the lakeside, we do not see any reason to impose any restrictions on anyone. In the meantime, we will need your help to write a letter to the Yard and summon some officers, just in case we need extra hands and help.”
“Guess what we called such quiet boys back in our days Sherlock,” the relentless man didn’t stop despite the glares he got from almost everyone at the table, “Slow.”
and Sherlock was grinding his pert arse over his clothed erection.
“Thanks,” John said, “You’re…..I don’t know how you knew, but I had been eyeing this jacket and gloves and cap combo for quite some time.”
“Are you out of your mind???”
“Sure thing honey!”
Both of them looked around in panic, not sure what to do. The window had started. The midnight gongs started to go off in the house across the street, the Holmes villa where they had an expensive and grandiose old fashioned clock. “We only have minutes John,” Sebastian said, “We need to act now. Remember what we used to do during the war, if you don’t have the usual then innovate. If you don’t have a weapon convert something into one. We should be doing just that right now……” His eyes fell on the ajar kitchen door ahead on the right side of the grand hall, next to the dining room area and he clutched at John’s sleeve.
John woke up with a slight crick in his neck and a feeling of stiffness and cramps on the right side of his body. He also felt disoriented, like one felt while waking up in an unfamiliar place.
Jim and Sebastian lay on a thick and soft blanket, completely naked and wet from a swim in the waters just a while ago. Jim was beneath Sebastian, almost obscured by his larger frame. Sebastian’s tanned back covered most of his white limbs and Jim’s lips were swollen and reddened by the frenzied kissing. Both men were impossibly hard, the blood in their engorged organs throbbing throughout them like an irresistible wave of desire. As they rubbed together and touched and groped and kissed, Jim’s nails dug into Sebastian’s skin and broke it.
“Makes sense,” Mary said, “Come on then, I’ll take you to him.”
Sherlock smiled a ghastly smile and he
Soon after that Sherlock and John got engaged before a close-knit group of family and friends. John’s sister was a bit shocked that she had not been ‘consulted’ for this but soon she accepted Sherlock in the family and even agreed that her brother couldn’t have found a better match. Sherlock’s parents were quite thrilled with John, especially his dad Reginald Holmes.
“I think it’s time to turn out the lights anyways, ten thirty already,” John said, feigning tiredness so Sherlock didn’t feel so mortified, “Good night Sherl.”
Unbeknownst to him, John had two tickets to a movie that had won five Oscars the same year and was the latest craze in town. It had taken him three attempts to get the tickets, that too the premium seats. He too had every mind of asking Sherlock out for a meal, to a restaurant that was equidistant between their workplaces. Yet, every single time he made up his mind and tried to open his mouth, something would hold him back. He cursed himself loudly in his head, berated himself for not having any guts, no spine etc, yet he couldn’t gather enough courage to say the words out aloud.
“Janet, you have to be a lot clearer if you want me to be on the same page.”
“Oh will you be a darling and get me some water? Really?”
“Oh! Well, what… so where…
“Hi Jawn.”
He drove on, looking morose and crestfallen. John sat tight on his seat, looking out of the window and trying very hard not to burst into laughter. Phil Andersen’s face looked so comical!
“Why put a gun to my temple, I could have been alerted simply by a touch on the shoulder,” John complained as he and Mycroft walked around the clinic driveway, with the attractive woman (whose name was supposedly Anthea) watching over Sherlock. John didn’t think Sherlock was in any form or shape of trouble, because the place was teeming with several other Mi6 people, all in plain clothes.
Mycroft was the first one to react, “Aren’t you one of the salesmen in the same institution Sherlock teaches in?”
John finished it in two big gulps and finished the sentence for him, “…..Is excellent. Thank you!” He gave the hapless Dyson an eyeroll and said, “You are missing out on something really nice!”
“Yeah?”
“Harry,” Greg noticed Mycroft’s apathy and Harry’s distress and decided to put a stop to this for now, “We shall talk tomorrow. Mycroft needs some time to absorb this. Go, have a relaxed and good evening with your friends. Grill some meat, drink some ale, get some sleep.”
“One word – Friend.”
“Um, sorry mummy, I should have called but I kinda got busy…. Yes, all is well and he wants to come over tomorrow morning.”
“No son or daughter of mine is a bloody queer, with sickening tendencies. You should be sent to a correction facility.”
Called Jim and Sebastian who live a retired life in the Bahamas now and got an earful from Jim saying I should be more of myself and
“I’m good.”
At that precise moment another man, a decoy planted by the crooked Culverton, showed up and pushed John out of the way with his shoulder. “Hey, this is just what I was looking for. My girl would love it, you know. How much for this? I am ready to pay hard cash or do a bank transfer right away from my account.”
“Your mummy helped.”
“Why? Don’t you want to talk to him?”
. In this matter, the fact that he was found on the next day a murder and a kidnapping had occurred in this town, that makes him
“Then what can we do? What should we do? Greg and I are not magicians. You think I am enjoying this task, do you think I…….” Mycroft trailed off, unable to continue. For the first time in his adult life, he had choked up. Usually he was the picture of poise and restraint.
Zzzzzz!
“Hey Mycroft good morning,” Greg shook hands with him and greeted him in a low voice, so Sherlock wouldn’t overhear, “Boy, am I glad to see you! John will need a ton of help from you. All those papers need to be changed, ownership transferred to John’s name. Also some recent changes he had asked for, from his second legal counsel, those papers have to be taken care of too. If necessary he may also issue a legal notice to this….. the kid standing over there. Yeah, it’s him, the conman who robbed John of hundreds of million. I was trying to get him back home because after all that he had suffered through, John still doesn’t want him hurt. Said I should ensure he reaches home safe and sound.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have got the money with me,” John held out a thick wad of notes, “Ivan told me it’s twenty-five grand and I have twenty-five grand here.”
“I can’t cancel.”
The man who served as his cook, housekeeper and the caretaker of this property when he wasn’t around, was Jason Michael, a Welshman whom he trusted. As soon as Jason appeared, Greg asked, “In my absence did anyone come to see me? Did Pierre call anyone?”
