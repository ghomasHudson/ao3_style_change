Before they could answer, she raked her hand through the poofy front of her bleached-blonde hair and groaned.
His voice fell away.
Cas narrowed his eyes a fraction before turning back to stare out the windshield.
“I don’t—” she mumbled, blushing. “I—”
He trailed off.
One call to Bobby Singer in South Dakota and a little sliver of good fortune had delivered him the news of three hunters across the river who'd be coming his way to help him out, and now he was languishing in a dark and smoky corner of the only bar in town, nursing the same whiskey he'd been nursing all night, too damn exhausted to get into the drink with any passion, waiting for the infamous Winchesters and their equally infamous angel to arrive.
“If you have to, Dean, prioritize it, because I don’t know about you, but I’m way more concerned with the filing cabinet of weirder shit that he’s holding. That kind of thing doesn’t just
"Trust me, son," Earl said, laughing. "You know when a house is right. Don't need the state to tell you that."
“So we’re just going to trust what some guy says and drive up into the middle of nowhere?”
Cas sat on the closed toilet as Dean yanked all the towels off the rack and knelt down with a wince in front of him. They were both still dripping everywhere. Dean's face was hard when he said, “Take off your clothes,” but it wasn't the same hardness as before.
“So far so good,” she teased.
"I reckon you've never done somethin' like this in such an old fashioned way," Drum commented, gazing down at the wall.
“For you,” she said, “anytime.”
Cas said nothing, but hugged her tighter.
“Ryan Abraham. Long-time boyfriend,” David muttered, as a reminder, as they made their way up the sidewalk to her porch. The Mississippi tributary ran just a little ways away, behind the trees and fences, and Cas tilted his head towards its distant sound as they walked. “Got pulled in just a while ago. Two days tops?”
Sam nodded. “And ask it what it might know.”
The reaper smiled wryly. “Everyone's worked the river.”
as him for like two weeks!"
“You think it's—what? Do you think it's angels?”
but Cas nudged his foot under the table. Sam, beside the boy, said, “No. We just want an explanation, that's all.”
He smiled a little, and waited for Dean to come back to bed in the high gloaming of morning, to kneel on the mattress and kiss him, welcome him awake, before the call came up to them for breakfast.
“And I can't think of anyone I'd rather see Dean with,” Sam said.
Needing no more confirmation, they fell into step again, moving deeper into the passage of cherry trees.
Dean blanched.
They walked across the square to Marlene's for breakfast and were just tucking in to ridiculous portions on all sides when small footsteps approached their booth from behind and Cas looked up from his food at the newcomer.
“Look, I know the system with your kind of people,” Yann said; his anxiety was giving way to what sounded almost like frustration with the fact that he couldn't seem to put his thoughts into words. “There are things you look for for cases, right? You've got contacts, you've got things that stick out. I thought if I was going to have to ask a hunter for help I'd better start thinking like one. I don't know what you've been paying attention to, but there've been—things, happening all over. Like—
Cas’ voice broke.
And so they loaded into the Sheriff’s pick-up, the three of them lounging like teenagers in the bed among four-by-fours and coffee cans of screws and stacks of shingles. They bumped along the road up into the hills, cowboy music spilling out of the cab. Their outer layers were heaped by a rusted tool box, and the wind fluttered the edge of Cas’ shirt, making it ripple over his back as he leaned on the side of the truck, watching the meadowland and trees scroll by, the sprays of yellow and white wildflowers nodding as they passed.
“Try some for yourself,” he had insisted, offering the towering man a small cup of some pale green brew, both of them kneeling in the customary fashion on the tatami mats of his small and orderly home on the river, near enough to the trees to be sure none would be stolen during the night.
When they opened the door to the wedding bedroom it didn't make a sound, and it seemed that the whole house filled with breath, everything dim and lacy with early luminescence, and if their feet made any noise upon the stairs, then it was only the sound of old timbers settling, under the tread of much-beloved weight.
“Nonsense,” she said, laughing. “Daddy always said feedin’ someone else was more important than feedin’ yourself. I know it ain’t much, but I reckon if I were a catfish I’d just throw myself on your plates!”
“Dean, that woman is shorter than
Only a man, who had been a catfish; only a man, who had been a star.
Dean pondered the question for a long time, looking off out the kitchen window to the waving green of the cypresses under the sun.
“No!” he said, laughing nasally. “No – no, it’s okay! I’m fine! I really – I’m fine, I’m just super—just—”
It told him, in the whispers of the crackling glue and the smell of the aged thing, that once, before there had been anything else, there had been a story.
“That's not all, though,” Yann babbled, tripping over his words in his haste. He dropped the binder unceremoniously on the counter; Sam and Cas turned to look through it. “I've been listening to the news on your side of the world, too. You know wendigos? Hasn't been a single reported case of one in almost a
Lightning struck with an enormous crack somewhere up ahead, a blinding flash that startled them all, and they scrambled back into the car as the storm picked up again and screamed down around them, blurring the river below into a muddy mess of blue and brown.
Dean laughed, and Cas gave Sam a sheepish smile of apology.
“Maybe you’re the one Shakespeare was writing about,” Dean said suddenly, and Cas tilted his head, smiling at him. “You know, all those dead poets. Maybe they were writing about you the whole time, and they didn’t know it.”
“I'm an old woman, darling,” she said, smiling at him. “I know what kind of a thing you are.”
Sam crunched his toast thoughtfully, nodding along. “I want to look through that binder again,” he said, mouth full. He swallowed, and tapped a few crumbs off of the toast and onto his plate before taking another bite. “See if there are any more that are closer, like that one in Wisconsin.”
“You never know,” Cas said, distantly, still watching Sam. “I think you’d be surprised what people are willing to wait for.”
“Dude, you haven't
“So I go up there, whenever the full moon's about to come out. I lock myself in the cabin until it's over, and I've—I've never found any blood, no one's ever died when I'm up there, I check to make sure. I haven't hurt a soul since it started, I swear, I swear to God.” His voice cracked and dissolved and he took another hasty drink, gasped when it burned his throat, pressed a hand to his face.
“I don’t know!” he said, laughed, and Sam’s eyes squinted in second-hand embarrassment. “Yeah – I think I am. Champagne – wow,
"I'll have to discuss it with my partners, see if it does..."
A few weeks earlier, Sam had stolen the Impala out from under Dean's nose and driven north from their halfway motel in Colorado all the way to Wisconsin. He'd been gone for a solid week, and Dean and Castiel—unable to be too terribly worried, considering he called every night to apologize for taking the car—had spent the days wandering the tiny town they'd bunked up in, admiring the Rocky Mountains from afar.
angel's work on the floor.
He winced, a scratch pulling too tightly on his side, and eased himself down beside Cas, drawing him back into him, soft cock nestling against the small of his back. He stroked Cas’ hair and rubbed his neck.
“I just can't shake it, Cas,” Dean said, in a hush, finally meeting his eyes. “That kid in Dubois.”
“—I’m not dead!” he cried, looking at Sam, and Sam smiled hesitantly at him.
“Where do we even start?” Dean mumbled, moving out of the way of a group of young girls. They were dressed in farm clothes, holding plastic bags full of peaches. The littlest one stumbled to keep up, holding her over-sized straw hat against her head, tripping in her boots. Cas watched them go by, smiling.
Sam scoffed, gently. “How are we supposed to find a place in Missouri that you won't tell us about? Just drive and hope we hit it?”
“Well...if it is something big, we'll handle it. One step at a time, the way you always do. Right?”
“Wait, just a second there, darlin’,” Dean smiled, warming it up for her. She paused, and Dean jerked his thumb towards the kid who was currently sucking down his second glass of chocolate milk. “You think he’d mind if I picked up his tab? I just got paid today and I have a little extra.”
“Back in a second,” he called, trotting back to the kitchen to get something else.
“I promise, babe. We won't.”
checkin' me out," Dean drawled, tipping his chin up to look at his angel better.
What frightened him most, he thought, splashing water onto his face, blinking it back out of his eyes, was that it didn't have a name. It didn't have a driving force, no demons, no angels, no creatures tearing down the curtain between worlds. It just
Dean remained silent.
The universe always baiting him with something; offering him Dean, The Righteous Man himself; offering him Sam, a makeshift family, a brother, a friend, a place to belong; offering him power or loyalty, a chance to prove his devotion; to be something that mattered; the opportunity to be an example of the love he so desperately wanted to show.
"No," Dean sighed, wiping the sweat already gathering on his brow.
anyone about this,” Dean insisted. She looked up, and stared blankly at him.
Cas followed, his legs and hips jostling against Dean's, and they huffed laughs as they rearranged, trying to find the best position to lie down. Somewhere in the confusion Cas turned his head and kissed Dean, slow and full, on the mouth, and all their movement stilled.
“Build them a house,” he said, almost too quickly.
“About tomorrow,” Dean said, and smiled.
Cas scoffed. His hand was solid and beautiful against Dean's back.
“Tell me about it.”
Cas nestled closer to him, lifted his hand to stroke the back of his head and down to his neck. Dean’s eyes were slipping shut and his body felt warm and heavy.
“This sounds like some heavy shit, Cas,” Dean said, on the end of a breath, and finally Cas heard how stressed he actually was. “Bigger than some kid out of Teen Wolf. And I thought maybe things were quieting down for good—”
It was one of those strange moments where Dean thought, honestly thought, that he would never move. He’d be stuck there, forever, hovering on the edge of the water; or maybe he would wake up and it would all be over, the grand and glorious dream.
“Never thought I'd got out dancing in my life,” Dean said, against his skin, quietly. “I think that helped some.”
“Well, let me get a little more intel on it, then. For now, just stay put where you are, keep an eye on things, let me know if anything comes up. I'll call you when I got somethin' worth telling.”
“Thanks,” Sam whispered, and Dean touched his shoulder, squeezing affectionately. It was only now in the wake of everything that it seemed possible, that things could
She smiled.
” Dean said, and he took a step forward in the water.
"They need me to go down there and get some gas for one of the generators - just down there in that shed at the bottom of the hill."
Sam, being taller than ninety-nine percent of those around him, gazed over the heads of the other festival goers, attempting to answer Dean’s question while the crowd surged around them. Many held crates and baskets of peaches on their ways out, smiling and laughing over all the noise; literally no one that Sam could see looked displeased about anything.
They existed in silence for a while. Connected by voice and satellite. Despite the distance she could almost imagine him beside her, awkward and too big, all grins and long hair and strong hands. She wished, suddenly and desperately, that he
They all looked at him, all three, with hard eyes.
He'd expected to see the usual
Its cover was blank, and it was clearly ancient, loosely bound in leather cord to hold it together and huge yellow patches of discoloration from water damage.
“What's so funny?”
“A mighty fine wedding,” Nate finished, and then he laughed, suddenly, the sound booming around the kitchen, a giant, joyful sound. “A mighty fine wedding, and we’re all just guests!”
“Hardly any, does that mean—you've got at least some?”
“It’s okay, Sammy,” Dean said, as his brother clung to him.
"Your home is just as lovely as you are," Cas said, voicing Dean's thoughts, and Dean knew without looking that Cas' face was just as earnest as his words sounded. "You keep a wonderful house."
“You like this?” Dean murmured, and Cas touched his neck, his hair, let his hands slip down to Dean’s forearms. His fingers moved to the headboard where Dean was leaning and curled over the wood there for a moment.
“What paper are you from? We've had all the usuals around already.” She sounded bored, fidgety.
“How old you think she was anyway? Like thirteen?” Dean grumbled as they walked out of the lobby and under the steel awning to the little rusty doors of the motel.
He lost himself in the pirouette of her voice all over again. Like a music box. Like a ballerina. The most beautiful, precious thing.
idea,” Dean said, low and snappish.
Yann lived on the other side of Winona, past even the furthest suburbs, and Sam was gone for the better part of an hour.
Dean nudged Cas' shoulder, just a little, and when Cas turned his face to him he leaned across the space between them and kissed him.
“As soon as we know—what's what. I think I'd—like to come back up to Greenacre. And see you.”
“You okay?” he asked gruffly, and Sam broke his reverie to turn to Dean, smiling absently.
"Alright!" Drum shouted, and Dean squared his shoulders, thought about keeping low. Keeping firm.
them!” Dean hissed, throwing off the blankets and tripping over Sam’s shoes on the way to the window. He yanked the curtains aside and climbed halfway onto the air conditioning unit, one knee awkwardly digging into the dial. The machinery rattled begrudgingly at him, but Dean didn’t care. He turned his head and pressed his ear to the pane, straining to hear past the glass, eyes closing in concentration.
She gasped and shivered and choked, Tomas standing idly on, watching the two of them. The punch of the look on her face in his gut almost made Dean want to double over.
Cas set his jaw. He wasn't sure if he should even ask how she'd known, or how she knew anything at all.
Dean chanced a sideways glance at the angel—the former angel, now, he supposed—to see him looking out the window, watching the clapboard houses and low clouds whisk by. Watching a couple walking their dog on the pale pavement, a kid riding her tricycle around a corner. His chin was in his hand, and Dean thought he looked very sad, now that he wasn't all sharp-faced with glaring at him, and he felt a little twinge in his chest.
Megan swallowed thickly. “Not at all,” she said, waving her hand towards the front screen door. “Go right ahead, it's fine.”
“Wow, man, you had
“Dean!” Sam barked. “He’s just a kid!”
Lily walked like a younger girl would, kicking rocks aside, her forefinger worrying her lower lip, plucking at it, lost in thought. Sam righted his head and glanced at her. Her bare shoulder brushed against him again and he nudged at her with his elbow and she shook her hair out, pulling her hand away from her mouth, embarrassed.
“There is so much time,” Cas said, and Dean felt that it was not to him that this was said, but to the house, or to the bed.
kill her.” His voice wavered. “I could kill anyone. Someone at work, a stranger, it doesn’t matter to me, so, if you know anything, anything at all, I would really appreciate it.”
There was a clatter behind the kitchen door, louder than usual in the empty echoing restaurant, and all three looked that way as it swung open and a boy who couldn't have been older than thirteen came out with a wobbling tray in his hands and toddled towards their table, apparently very unsure of where to put his feet.
It was cool in the little room, but not enough to need the sheets. They bowed towards each other, face to face, Cas’ head pillowed on Dean’s arm. Dean raked the hair back from Cas’ forehead, petting it down, and Cas hid his face in Dean’s shoulder for a moment.
Cas sighed; his mouth pulled down. “Us,” he said, glancing at Dean. “What are we doing?”
Into the house, cool, dark, quiet, the stairs creaking under their feet as they crept, not wanting to disturb the furniture or the rugs or the dark lamps; up to the second flight, to the tip top of the house, the sealed door clicking open as Cas turned the knob.
A yellow python slithered out of the pantry, wriggling to get away from the broom chasing it and coiling under the kitchen table defensively. Olivia reemerged, staring down at it.
“Star,” he mumbled, after a moment. “Star on one of their palms.”
“Not if you're inhuman,” Cas said, speaking up almost to their surprise, sitting straighter on the bed. “I could see it. I have enough grace left for that, I think.”
Castiel looked away from Dean and studied her. She looked confused, shifting on her heels and staring at them.
They squeezed in among the dancers. A few folks Lily recognized smiled and continued paying attention to their partners without bothering to make conversation. Lily rocked with the music, a steady strum, and tangled their fingers together, drawing him into movement, moving in turn with him. He stared down at her; she was so small compared to him. His heart sped up as she twisted her hips, moving her body closer to his own, pulling his hands to her waist.
"That means they were probably lured," Sam sighed. "But how? What does a girl from the fifties care about these random people? I mean - they really don't have much in common. They're all from different demographics, and none of them would be in the same circles..."
“What, outta nowhere?”
"Gotta get them trusses up. Gonna ramp it and then bring em' up."
Dean looked around at the flurries, the eddies of pale pink, spiraling to the ground, resting in the grass and in their hair and on the path, caught up in the momentary gust and then settling in blowzy patterns on the red brick. He watched them, and as his eyes lit around at the motes of falling petals he caught sight of a teetering figure at the very farthest edge.
It was startling and rare to remember his own hands and think they might have fit the same place as those of the past. These hands were aligned with others, palms matching. Hands that had struggled against famine or flood and pushed on, learned to throw their weight as he had. These low-built ones like him who had put their shoulders to the wind and dared it to blow. The feeble fish, the base creature that had slithered from the waves and tied itself to the land had risen to meet the eyes of some far heaven.
“I think they're closing,” Dean said.
“Twenty-eight!” she chirped, and Sam’s eyes widened. She was far younger than she looked. “The makeup makes us look older than we are. But I try! Do all that anti-wrinkle nonsense, you know. Moisturize!”
“Go to sleep, baby doll,” she said, breaking his thoughts.
Olivia didn’t lie. She didn’t spare Dean, either. She forced him out of bed at seven with a sharp rap at the door and the promise of hot coffee and a full breakfast; it was good, since he was starved all of a sudden. Echoes of those old hungers, he supposed.
Sam and Dean appeared again at half past five, carrying brown bags full of penny candy to share, sporting the content, easy expressions that came from long talks about good things.
“What are we going to eat?” Cas asked, sliding on his boots and leaning down to lace them up.
“Now, you all want to talk rivers,” Nate said, cutting right to the chase, pressing into the yolk of his egg with the prongs of his fork and dipping his toast in it. He raised his head and smiled around the table, the picture of ease. Sugar settled beside him, draping her napkin over her lap and arranging her elbows off the edge of the table, knife and fork held delicately in her small hands. “So let’s talk rivers.”
They were wrecks. He sighed, running a hand through his hair—Dean's shoulders were a cacophony of red streaks, a bruise weltering on his neck, a harsh blot of blood on the inside of his lower lip where, it seemed, Cas had bitten straight through.
They snapped their heads towards Sam’s voice where he'd reappeared in the doorway, and he smiled, awkward. “Food. She’s got food.”
“What do you think?”
“Dean, what the hell is going on?” Sam said again, and Dean was unable to find words.
Dean felt himself tip towards getting lost in the openness of Cas’ face when he smiled quietly at Dean in passing, but then he had gone by, and Sam’s back filled his view, and Dean was left standing, still holding the door, and still some kind of hungry.
Cas accepted the Dean Winchester brand of apology for what it was and allowed himself to be led around the perimeter of the gym.
“How did you know we were hunters?” Dean asked. His tone of voice was one that clearly indicated he had no time for this; from across the room Cas gave him a weary look of placation.
was a little plea to slow it down, please. This was far greater than
“Look, I don't know what to tell you. All I got's a big heap of what look like full-blown miracles that just keep stackin' up and hardly any leads.”
“It was never just a fad religion,” she said, almost too low for him to hear, and he had to look at her again, really look, in the passing slices of light from the streetlamps, to be sure she'd said it at all.
Men in neon vests were ushering vehicles along, spitting on the concrete and waving people down to a detour – a small crossroads, one parallel to the river and the other heading a ways inland into forest and trees. To the west, just over the overpass, there was a steep upward incline. They were looking at the back of a ridge, a drop off of the hills surrounding it, butted up to the Mississippi outflow.
“Exactly.” Yann snapped up his binder and hugged it to his chest. “Why couldn't it all be—I don't know, connected? Miracles. Or whatever. Maybe—maybe that's what's wrong with me. Or. Right with me. You know.”
“Come on, Sammy, that girl was gorgeous. Don't think of it as legwork. Think of it as—having the attention of a pretty girl all to yourself for a few hours. And the info's just a bonus.”
Dean pulled him closer, arms winding around him, one hand slipping back up into his hair, and Cas let his weight settle over Dean’s chest.
“I want to thank you,” Cas said, his voice gone soft. His head was leaning to one side, the pale expanse of his neck raised to the room.
The thunder howled louder and the angry clouds were leaching closer, eating up the sky, and the rain was becoming less of a suggestion and more of a reality—stray droplets began to land on Dean's face, and he looked up, felt Sam follow his lead. All of it grey and low-hanging, spitting out and back the way they'd come, the thunderhead once distinct now melting across the sky.
“Okay.” Dean leaned forward, bending his leg, rubbing at his face with one hand. “Okay, Bobby, thanks.”
If that were all it would take, he would have called her ages ago.
Cas touched his forehead and then let his hand rake back through his dark hair, the strands sticking up as his fingers combed through them.
“Bad crap or good crap?”
“Uh—fine,” he said, shrugging, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “I've got some stuff, I guess. D'you want to head out?”
They followed her down the winding back hall, all three of them. Dean at her heels, and Castiel holding his hand; as they neared the back window, looking out over the bayou, Cas reached back, swallowing, and found the edge of Sam's sleeve, and held that, too.
he was tired.
“I just thought—I was kind of under the impression you guys were, you know—”
He was glad there was no push and pull, no animal avalanche, right now. At the very least they could kiss and caress and lie in each other's arms without pain or shame and that, frustrating as it might have been, was enough for them, for now, until something could be made of the problem that existed between them.
“And?” Dean prompted.
“I don't understand,” Sam said.
He went to the window, and looked out.
“Nope,” Dean said. His eyes dropped to where Castiel's hand lay on his leg for a moment, and he worked his jaw, as if unsure what to do about it, and then his gaze moved back to the road.
She smiled to herself when she heard him come in. The bowlegged one with the hungry eyes. She knew how desperate he was and she moved her head nervously. It would turn out. They’d made it here. Him alone making it here was a miracle in itself…she could feel him ready to make his hungry demand and she laughed, made a little
"Not important," she answered. “You came for it. That is what is important."
,” Dean said, shuffling further down the bed until his shoulders were propping up his head. He crossed his arms and sighed.
"Sorry, sorry, alright—" he said, giving in, and she pulled back, turning to look at the three of them at once: Dean rubbing his face, Sam staring at her wide-eyed, and Cas confused.
The old man smiled wryly, unaffected by Dean’s tone.
She prattled on, all the way up the rattling metal stairs, about how she’d been cleaning her apartment every day waiting for them, and she’d tried to guess what they’d like to eat but kept whatever she'd bought because she couldn’t afford to buy more.
“With each other.”
“...however much you resist them, the waters will return; that the land sinks; silt collects; that something in nature wants to go back."
Sam shook his head. “I guess it's kind of a hush-hush thing around here,” he said. “She didn't seem keen to talk about it.”
“Maybe there's nothing to stab this time,” Cas said. “Or shoot or kill. Maybe this is something different, something good.”
“We'll call him tomorrow. Let's get some shut-eye.”
“After his book,” Lily said. “As far as I know. There aren't any copies that exist anymore that I know of, but if you believe what they say about Porter, he kept that book on him like it was a Bible. The Riverlands Hymnal, he called it.” She exhaled, and leaned back in the booth seat, taking a long sip of black coffee. “And that's all I know about the subject. God's honest.”
Olivia glided towards them, her dress clouding around her as she walked in billows of deep color. She did not seem to have many words for them at first, gesturing them to let her kiss them as she always did. She pinched their cheeks a little and swatted them, emotion brimming in her eyes, fighting her decision not to cry.
“Is there anything we could do?” Sam said, his compassion getting the better of him. He ignored Dean’s arguing stare. “To really show her we don’t mean anything bad? Maybe we could—fix something for her? We’re pretty handy, and we don’t have much cash.”
“Hey,” Dean said, when he heard him approaching through the dew-wet grass. He stood up from his stoop, wiped engine grease on his jeans, leaving dark smears. “Bored?”
Mattie Lawrence frowned into her napkin.
to be FBI, or. Journalists. Or whatever else we need to get the job done."
Sam nodded, looking from the angel to Dean, who had settled against the TV cabinet and was pinching the bridge of his nose as if to stave off a headache.
” she begged, holding Dean’s leg. “Please remember! If you don’t you’ll flood everything!”
There was whoop and a holler and then Sam was looking up at them—dozens of lanterns that had suddenly been lit aglow. They were old antique things, ages old and tarnished, but they’d all been wired up, it seemed, hanging down from the low rafters.
His silver hair was pressed flat against his head, but it was thick and shone with health. He rubbed his now empty fingers and the little girl came back, tucking the pipe into the pocket of his shirt. He shook his head but smiled at her fondly.
“What's that supposed to mean?”
They snuck down the stairs again, still a while later, as if they’d be scolded, but the house was vacant. Olivia and Sam on some errand, they were sure.
Dean stepped up onto the bank, unable to hold himself back any longer, and he took those few steps towards him—Castiel, holding his unlit lantern, face wet with tears and smile so joyous it nearly knocked Dean breathless.
“We can’t,” Cas said breathlessly. “We can’t – we have to play host. We have to, Dean…all those…”
They went inside (Cas more slowly, leaning on his good leg) to find black-and-white tile lit up by buzzing fluorescent lights, canned muzak streaming from somewhere they couldn't place. All in all an entirely normal diner in an entirely normal town; just what Dean wanted after the fiasco in St Cloud.
“And the book that comes after?”
Dean looked at Cas, who stuck a sugar-covered thumb in his mouth to suck it clean and then nodded.
In their mutual unease they left under cover of the mist and hardly spoke except to catch the exits on the highway. In their mutual unease they bunked up for the afternoon halfway, none of them in any state to drive, still. Still a little stomach-sick at the shock of what they'd heard the night before.
, though," Sam mused, tapping the obituaries. "I mean, the articles don't mention it..."
The bedroom was fairly easy to find, and Cas was drawn there for reasons he couldn't quite name; he assumed any incriminating evidence of any affair or altercation would be there, in the small and private spaces these people kept. Through the open bedroom window he could hear David and Megan talking on the porch. For a moment he lingered near the white windowsill, listening—they were talking about the figure Megan had seen in the water, minutes before her boyfriend had wandered into the current. He sighed, leaned his forehead against the frame, closed his eyes.
“Help you turn again?”
He was cut off by their abrupt drop onto the riverbank, a shock of solidity to Dean's tailbone and Cas' head, and Dean collapsed backwards, pulling Cas down with him. Sam immediately scrambled to help them, gripping Cas' arm and hauling him to his feet, then crouching down to pull Dean up as well.
A God who saw love lacking in the world He had made. Who formed two stones from the dust beneath His feet and breathed into them, and blessed them. A Death who looked on love with sadness. A split. A pouring out.
“Tall skinny dude?” Dean asked. He ran the four dead faces in the morgue through his mind.
It was real scary at first. I didn’t like it – but then I realized how important it was. How important
“…thanks, Yann,” Dean said, carefully extracting himself from Yann’s grip.
"Here, here—" Dean's jumbled voice, his hand grabbing the back of Cas' head, pushing him down into the toilet and suddenly he knew why. Cas retched, hands fisting the porcelain, and slid down, his legs no longer holding him up.
“Cas told you it was okay. He’s fine. Sandra didn’t hurt him – she just wanted to talk to him, right? I don’t think it’s as bad as you think it is.”
Lily tossed her head and squeezed his arm with her own. “I don’t know. You want it to be?” she answered, her smile curling over her face. She seemed more at ease than she had the whole night, with her arm through his. Sam wanted it to be a date very much; he just didn’t know what that meant. Radiant as she was, they'd only just met, and on a lie, at that.
Cas slipped the receipt into his pocket and turned out the light, and went back downstairs to rejoin the brothers.
Dean looked at him, turned his head in the dark, and sought his wide blue gaze. His face was pained.
The pain was a soft one. An acknowledgment of old familiar feelings, of the anguish he had carried so long, a lonely howl the river knew and soothed, tonguing at his clothes.
Once it might have disturbed Castiel to be singled out, to have so much expected of him, but not anymore. Dean had asked of him, and this was not a privilege extended to many, and as his friend, as his rescuer, as his protector at times, Castiel had always given what he could.
“That’s alright,” he whispered, his voice nasal and rough. His blue eyes returned to Dean and he gave a watery grimace, eyes red-rimmed. “Y-you can make it look like an accident, right?”

“Mother
Cas let his hands fall, to pull up the comforter over them; it settled cotton-warm on their shoulders and he slipped under it to hold Dean, find the soft round contour of his side, the gentle roll of his stomach. Dean touched him, let his hand rest against the pulse in Castiel's throat that grew stronger every day, traced the plane of his chest that fell away from his collarbone. They rested for a moment, breathing, mouths nearly touching, still, exchanging air; with hazy eyes they looked at one another and smiled, gently, kissed again, and again, and Cas found his leg sliding between Dean's, their cold feet tangling, shifting against the sheets with the soft sound of linen brushing.
Castiel had been rendered a bit useless by the sight of him: the flex of his shoulders and arms, the slight torque of his waist as he turned into the pull, the wall rising up from the soft earth. His eyes trailed over his chest, his legs, his thighs, the wrinkle of his jeans at the front, and back up again to the curve of his biceps, the steeps of his neck, the square lines of his jaw, slightly tightened in concentration.
“Dottie! I’m taking off!” she called, and an elderly woman down the table waved a hand at her.
“Is that where you heard about us?”
. They were stepping, turning, swinging and spinning, boots stomping on the wood, wide grins, hands slipping and meeting lightly and quickly, as if they'd been doing this all their lives.
It wasn’t bad yet. It wasn’t wrecked yet.
Her eyes went soft, her face gentle. She looked wise beyond any years, and they regarded her with something close to awe, the girl with the universe on her back, expanding over her entire body, spreading every day.
Dean paused.
There was a bench outside the Galilee dance hall, and a single buzzing street light. Latecomers were filing into the metal doors, bypassing Sam with low laughter and conversation. No one paid him any mind.
“Joy,” she said. “I think that one will suit you just fine.”
“Dean—”
Her voice was heavy with sleep and slightly disoriented, but she’d picked up the phone. She’d picked up the phone like she'd promised she would. His heart hammered against his chest.
“Because it’s not about me,” he said, hurried, before Dean could say anything else. Yann glanced up, the dark circles under his eyes prominent in the swinging light above the table. “If it were about me I wouldn’t have let myself live this long,” he continued, his voice even, grounded in the statement. “I would have killed myself long before now if I didn’t have to take care of my mom.”
He was still Dean Winchester, with every argumentative and stubborn streak. He still loved his brother, his car, hot pie. And the way Cas looked in Missouri sunlight, leaning out the side of a pickup truck as the wind ruffled through his hair and his shirt, the bump of his vertebrae under Dean’s fingers.
“He’s already quite fine,” he murmured, and only Dean really heard him, a light flush scattering over his face.
“Maybe we ought to make friends with teenage werewolves more often,” Dean said, and Cas nudged his shoulder.
. “She couldn’t get away. She’s got to work and so she couldn’t come. But she sends her best wishes and she’s really excited about you two and everything…so…”
They drove until Dean was too anxious to drive anymore, and so—alone, unanchored, and unsure—did they enter the town of Jordan, Mississippi, welcomed by a green government sign proclaiming a population of 489, just as dusk was chasing in from the east.
“It’s not all bad,” Cas murmured. “It’s not all bad, Dean. Even the things outside of this—”
Dean nodded. Cas' gaze flickered between Sam and Dean and then fell back to the floor. Sam was overtaken by the urge to just
"Really? That's nice. I hate it when it's drugs, and it always seems to be drugs. It's not a cult, is it?"
Sam sighed. “I mean—knows about them...knows if they're connected to. This.”
“When I was growing up it was just a story. Or bits and pieces of one,” she said, rolling her shoulders back and forth. Her voice was low, as if she didn't want to be overheard. “Nothing whole, ever. My family's—
Dawn arrived, at some eventual moment, and when Dean woke it was to find Cas standing at the open window, leaning against its sill on his elbows, looking out into the grey of very early morning. Naked as the day itself, of course—the pale arc of his back, the dip of shadow where flesh caved towards his spine, one foot flexed at the toes, sole facing the room. Birds where chittering down near the water, and the very first faint glow of the sun was teasing the horizon past his profile, smoothing up into the blue of receding night.
The tray skidded across the floor in the scuffle. He managed to pry her hands off of Dean and she cried out again, sinking halfway to her knees.
” the parrot whistled at him. “
“It gives you what you need,” he said. “That is the secret.”
"You're never going to believe what I found poking around in that shed," he whispered, drawing closer so as not to attract attention. Sam took a bite of the sandwich he remembered he was holding and stooped down to look at what his brother was pulling out of his pocket. A slim, yellowed book.
“Sprite?
He took the generic white washrags off the towel rod and turned on the tap, twisted it to warm and wet them, squeezing them out.
She moved on to Cas, shuffling in her long black dress, the fringe of her shawl swinging around her elbows. Cas stared at the bright scarf wrapped around her head, keeping her hair up while she planted her red lips on his face. All of them were stunned into silence—but then again none of them had known what to expect.
“Walk with me?” Dean said, and Castiel had never felt—there was no word that would do it justice. “Come
Dean's muttered reading dropped off.
“Yeah.” Cas nodded, breathing in, and Sam touched his shoulder once more, a little dizzy with the radiance of him.
“Pity about the fog,” she said, lightly, and Cas hummed in agreement. He finished drying a plate and set it down in its place on the countertop—he liked the rhythm of it, the action. It felt like a good thing to do with the mist lying heavy on the ground outside the screen door, blocking out the trees and the flowers.
He liked it here, in New Orleans, or on its outskirts. The house seemed just big enough for all of them, even if it were only, he knew, to hold them for a little while, and whenever he found himself walking on the riverbank with his hands in his pockets and the summer wind pushing his hair back from his face, he thought that nowhere else had he seen a sky so endless, or so perfectly painted.
"Shh!" she said.
“Shut up,” Dean said, voice hoarse, pulling his arm away. “Let me do it. It's fine.”
She paused as the din of the birds died down a little, and studied him for a moment, her eyes narrowing slightly.
“Yeah, and curiouser,” he joked, flipping to the article behind the one he had been looking at.
“Apparently the Galilee river port used to be a huge hub for Mississippi travelers – like one of the main places to stop between St. Paul and St. Louis. But then in 1828 this massive flood hit it…says here that steamboats were pretty much floating on the streets.”
“No—” he paused. “No. No she didn’t.”
Dean and Sam snapped at each other a few more times, but Dean had already decided and there wasn’t much to be said about it. Cas stared up at the sign for the restaurant as they pulled off the highway and into the lot: pale blue with white lettering in elaborate script.
“Now, we’re gonna have a little talk,” she said. “The kind of talk where y'all don’t ask so many questions, alright? I promise to tell you everything I’m allowed to.”
“I've—you're my last option,” he said, refusing to look at any of them. “Like I said, it's been two months. I've had time to look into things, you know? I mean, I guess I'm lucky for being such a—
“But not for a while yet,” Sam said, “I hope.” He thought of the orchard in Wisconsin, for an instant.
Dean heard the hurry of the jack being positioned and became immobile, leaning back into the rope, working with the pull, not against it.
So much time, there in the little room. No worry.
“It doesn’t matter.” He waved his hand through the air, dismissing Dean’s comment. “You followed me. You are here now, and we are going to have tea as friends would. It is done.”
The sound of a door hinge cut through the symphony of birdsong and five cuckoo clocks went off at once, spitting out their little charming rings and clanks. A shadow fell out of the door and a woman stepped out, beating feathers off of her apron as she came into the room. She was singing loudly, undeterred by the cacophony around her. Her curves swelled past the hems of her apron, a plump, soft, womanly shape clothed in a loud floral print dress underneath it.
“Morning,” he said, stifling another yawn, and sat up. “'S the radio on or somethin'?”
There was, overwhelmingly, the smell of flowers.
“As far as I know, no such thing as ending, but I only know what gran knew. What my family knew, and that’s what I choose to believe.”
He stood under the metal portico outside the hotel and clicked through his contacts till he landed on her name.
They flitted about town like Greek muses, inspiring the love of nearly every boy in their high school class. You had never seen four more beautiful, delicate creatures, each one lovelier than the next, and none so lovely as Lily, the youngest of the four (Rose, Hyacinth, and Violet, respectively—and the fairytale nonsense of the sisters' names did not amuse Lily—not even a little).
There was no fumbling, no biting or grabbing or pulling. It wouldn't have felt right after what had happened. Instead they lay in the dark, unable to see one another in the blackness left behind from the yellow light turning off, and Castiel found the bruises and raised marks on Dean's neck and face with the touch of his fingers, smoothed them; Dean kissed him gently, controlled, pulling himself in. Cautious in the wake of his confession. He seemed, still, a little afraid, a little tight in the middle.
“Goodnight, Sam,” Cas said softly, and didn’t wait for an answer, following Dean, stepping carefully, as though he were trying to place his feet in the exact places Dean’s boots had been.
“How'd it go?” he asked as Sam came to a stop beside them, lingering outside one of a dozen booths.
"I don't," she repeated firmly. "I don't want anybody else. Or anybody less, or anybody bigger. I've tried to get over you, I've tried to push you to the back burner, but I can't. I can't forget you and I don't want to—"
Dean didn't answer that. He sighed, and closed his eyes against Cas' neck.
“Oh, you know,” she said, gesturing liquidly with her small, feeble hands. “The river has been very quiet. Very odd. I've lived here all my life and it's flooded every year—seventy-three years, would you believe? Every April, every May, like clockwork. Easter is always wet. But not this year.” She shook her head, gazing off as if lost in recollection. “And then the kingfishers—let me tell you, there are all sorts of reporters asking around about those things! They make such an awful racket.”
“So,” Sam began, as they rounded the corner together. Sure enough, there was the orchard; the festival had indeed been positioned at the back of the property, butted up along the white-washed fence that bordered the groves, long lines of trees extending a few acres back, a tall white farmhouse rising up over the tree tops. Far off, in the next pasture, Sam could see the black and white splotches of dairy cows and a little group of horses, and beyond that, wide meadow.
Sam didn’t move, was too frozen to move, watching his brother sob and clutch his own chest, watching his shoulders jerk and twitch as he wept. The old man watched as well.
Buried in his task was a peace, an inviting silence. Nothing thrashed or trembled; nothing rolled or kicked. There were only his feet on the ground and the exact knowledge of where he was in that firm moment. The world may have shifted around him, may have thrown the wind against him, but he would have stood.
"How can you say that when you barely know me? You don't know what I've done and how things have ended up for other people I love."
“You could tell us everything,” Cas said, meeting her eyes. It wasn't a question; it was a fact. “You know a lot more than you're telling.”
They were forced out of the motel before noon the next day; by some gravity they ended up back at the diner. Dean frowned into his coffee, unsure if his headache was from too much caffeine or not enough.
Dean woke as soon as Cas knelt back on the bed and gently put the rag against his back, smoothing away the beads of blood that still remained in the scratches and welts.
“So?” Cas prompted, watching Dean walk up ahead of them, out of earshot.
God. Just looking at him and the itch crawled back under his skin, a base desire beyond what he had ever felt. To claim and be claimed and join, to couple himself to Cas and never separate again.
“Sometimes the miracle isn’t about the
enough—to send Death himself out into the world,” Cas said. All the warmth, all the happiness of that afternoon had been sucked out of the room and the air between the three of them like a drag on a cigarillo.
“Great,” Dean mumbled. “A nice big general field. Awesome.”
“It's never that easy,” Sam said.
“We can go find food,” Cas said, breaking in, seeing the look of apprehension on Dean's face. He seemed a little shell-shocked by the appearance of the journal—not what he'd been expecting to fall into his lap, here, of all places, and so easily. “And work out what to do next.”
“My daddy always says the big pieces were just a lot of little ones,” she said instead. “I figure I’m just another piece makin' sure the wheel turns, makin' sure y'all don’t give up and throw a wrench in it.”
Something sad and far away, like the song of a mourning dove.
“This is another love story,” she said. “The starring roles the same, the actors on the same stage, but a little different. A little kinder. Full of much more choice from the beginning than the other ever was.”
“And you?” she said, waiting for Cas.
“Don’t even try to ‘what girl’ me, Sammy,” Dean said, raising his eyebrows; Sam’s blush deepened and he coughed nervously into his hand. “So where is she? Didn’t you tell her to come?”
Cas sighed, running a hand back through his hair. He didn't even know what he was looking for. Some indication of a rupture, some indication that they'd been moving apart enough for Ryan to be snatched away by the ghost of Sandra Eadie.
Nate bent to move her hair aside and kiss her neck.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean murmured, letting his hand fall from the angel's shoulder. He leaned back on his haunches and stared at the corner of the mattress. “Jesus Christ.”
"Worse things to be than your best friend," Sam chuckled, and the corners of Cas' mouth turned upwards in genuine pleasure for the first time in too long.
“Yann, do you think it would be alright if you could take us back up to St. Cloud? Show us the place you stay?” Sam had moved a little closer now, and the teenager sniffled, rubbing his nose with his palm.
“Maybe in a bit,” she said, too busy hauling him over to a free table where she could drop her purse. Sam had the vast feeling that no one would be stealing it in this town.
“She said the trees are in a grove on the east side of town facing the water and that it’s like a park or something. There’s a little tea house nearby and the guy that runs it takes care of them.”
“You didn’t hear that?” Dean exclaimed, turning around in disbelief. “You really didn’t hear that? Tell the truth.”
It has always been you. The three souls born in that first thunderclap when He made you so. Two stones, and the dust of them. Before there was time to measure such great things you were, in one way or another.
“Soon,” Cas breathed, into Dean’s mouth, as Dean’s hands mapped his body over his clothes. He whimpered with want, he pulled Cas closer to him, kissed him, threaded his fingers through the silk of his hair, hungry.
It was odd to feel so certainly about something.
Dean set his jaw, ignoring the stiff indignation that was tightening Castiel's spine. The former angel looked ready to hit something, and it was looking more and more like that thing might be Dean.
“Come on, Bobby, there has to be something.”
He read. He read leaf after leaf, and the great thing thrashed and writhed in his chest, crowding in his throat, trembling with the hammering of his heart. For they were here—
Death walking had undone it all.
than what it is."
“What’s
“That’s good,” he whispered. “So good, Dean.” He arched towards the circle of Dean’s fist and breathed again.
Dean and Cas didn't dance again, but when they'd taken a seat at one of the tables with a few of the more worn-out couples they stayed close together, bodies gravitating, and Sam saw Dean steal a quick firm kiss against Castiel's temple not long before the lanterns went full up and the Byrnes took their final bows on the stage to thunderous applause.
“She was a mess for days, but she’s alright now. She’s light as a feather; hope floats, and all that.”
“Ah – yeah. Yeah, I think I do,” he mumbled, half laughing it, and Cas smiled sympathetically.
Le Beau reported no drownings, of children or otherwise, along its shores, for a very long time, and every year it was remarked that the cherry trees kept by Matsu Kami and his granddaughter bloomed brighter and more vibrant than was thought possible.
Hangs ripe in the heavens, your voyaging stay.
“I don’t know how to answer you on that. I don’t know who is behind all of it, but you know, the river still rolls on. She’s been rolling for longer than any of us, and if anybody’s got a story to be believed it’s a river’s story, and the river sings about a change. A change is coming. Things are going to be different, things are going to shed their skins, things won’t look the same. Won’t be the same. Two being one. ”
Dean’s hand trailed down, touching in dark spaces, and Cas whimpered. The hot cave of Dean’s mouth, tender warmth from base to tip; supple flicks of his tongue and the seeking press against him. There was a momentary pause and Dean leaned up to kiss Cas’ stomach.
The first breadth of the river offered nothing. It wasn't until they were under the shadow of the bridge that Dean hissed “Hey!” His voice echoed under the supports above their heads; the water glimmered in reflection under Sam's flashlight against its underbelly.
“What did it say?” Sam asked. Unobtrusive; merely curious, curious as to what could make his brother go white like that, curious as to what was hiding on Dean's tongue.
nervous—only eager, eager to prove something, he thought. “Yes.”
“Well, it’s got a huge flooding problem,” Sam said, Yann's binder sitting heavily on his lap, the map they'd been peering at discarded.
As soon as the words had left his mouth, Dean and Cas sought out each other’s eyes, a look passing between them.
“Yeah, I’m fine. You?”
They found slightly nicer accommodation for the night; the motel of the last few days had been skeevy even by the Winchesters' standards, booked more out of necessity than anything else. That night they parked the Impala in front of Room 38 at a Motel 6 after an uneventful afternoon; the sun was setting bright and golden over the bluffs, and though Dean would never admit it, all three of them had an easy lope to their walks that only came from relaxation. They needed days like this, no matter how much they denied it to themselves.
Cas blinked sideways at him, finding the line of his jaw in the dark.
"Is he your brother?" she asked, tilting her head. "You said 'our mother.'"
They ambled; the park was empty because of weekday work schedules and a lack of playground equipment. It was not an uncomfortable quiet, though. There was a tranquility there, an organic peace that differed from stillness of houses, or bedrooms at the tops of said houses.
“Do you—recommend any place for us to go?” Sam asked. “Anywhere we can find out more about—whatever all this is?”
“Don’t fight,” Matsu Kami said calmly, addressing Dean and Dean only. “If you fight it will only fight harder.”
“Your brother and the other one?” she said.
It was then that they saw it, as she came back in and started up the water on the stove, when her back was to them.
They were still arm in arm, and none of the festival-goers seemed to have noticed, or particularly cared. A few gave them lingering glances, and one a curled lip, but no one said anything—they simply passed by and left them to themselves. As Sam had said earlier, everyone seemed
He was in a daze when the car came to an abrupt parking stop in the lot of a diner that looked straight from the sixties and blinked, startled back to clarity. The whole world slotted back into place with the push of Dean's hand on his arm and the pop of the door opening.
In comfortable silence they pulled off their clothes, down to shirts and boxers. The room was warm on their skin and Cas got up off the bed, surveyed it for a moment as if unsure what to do with it. He pulled back the comforter and the sheets and looked down at it.
Sam smiled gently, trying to not add to the tension that was already filling up the room. Dean reached up and shook Sam’s shoulder, hand kneading it affectionately. He cuffed him on lightly on the cheek, Sam ducking a little to get away from the brush of his knuckles.
“So a flooding pattern breaks tradition for the first time in—”
“Let’s get a room,” he said, perhaps a little too hastily. “Just for tonight. My brother won’t mind.”
There was a clatter and Sam snapped his head to the sound, to the other end of the table.
And she was, on closer examination, one of the most beautiful girls Dean had ever come across. Her nose was slightly crooked, but her smile was brilliant; she was a wreck, sallow-skinned and gaunt, too-big teeth, small ears, a clavicle that looked like it could slice butter—but she was beautiful. It was her demeanor, the happiness in every angle of her body. It made her gorgeous.
“No,” he said, shaking his head. “No. I bet they’re not.”
Cas didn't say anything for a moment—Dean and Sam watched him, trying to read in his posture whether or not it had worked, but then he stood up a little straighter, as if coming to attention, and fixed his eyes on a spot on the wall at eye level.
Dean pushed past the pain in his foot and kicked off, kicking and scooping at the water, pulling himself towards Cas. He wasn't too far off now—if he could just fight the tug of the river a few more yards—
Dean slipped out of bed, came to him, stood by the window with him. His hand rested in the small of Cas' back, caressed a little up and down.
The climb up the ridge was slow at first, a tedious serpentine twist of the road, but once they got over the train tracks, the landscape took a dramatic turn. The ground dipped behind, falling away under their wheels the higher they got, the town growing further and smaller. Their ears popped, and the air thinned. They all took deeper breaths, watching the wilderness gather them closer and closer to its heart.
it had been once.
“If you could—please put your gun away I might be able to—”
He nodded back to her, and let his hands hang down by his sides. It wouldn’t be long till he took his shoes off, felt the mud between his toes, when he’d meet the water again, offer himself back up to the river at last.
Yann Olsson and his mother lived in a huge, rambling clapboard house past the farthest-flung suburb of Winona, tucked up along the rise of a bluff among the towering trees. Altogether it looked like a poor house, but a kind one—wind-chimes dangled in bunches near the door, floral curtains drifted in the windows, and as they walked up to the door, the window-air-conditioner chugged and puffed with a little domestic hum as if welcoming them.
He paused for a long time, biting the inside of his lip, acutely aware of Castiel's hand on him, the nearness of him.
Giving themselves, now. Freely, now. Binding themselves with their words, golden and perfected. They could almost see them, forming from air, from dust, from water, luminescent, like so many fireflies, drawing them closer. Sloughing away their apprehensions. All of this, all of it, to their eyes, now, a shining thing, a vast splendor, tightening.
The angel cracked a smile first, eyes hooding sleepily. He shifted on Dean’s lap and Dean stroked his thigh and down his bent leg to his calf and the taught skin of his kneecap. Cas’ hand settled on his stomach, pushing down and in slightly, feeling the solid muscle underneath, and he gazed at Dean’s chest, amused. Dean covered the slender fingers with his own, thumb rubbing circles on Cas’ wrist, both of them caught in that cautious, curious tenderness that unfolded around them when they touched like this. Like they'd never touched before, they realized; but it was too late, too soft, too dark to care, to be shocked by that epiphany.
Dean snorted, unconvinced. “Yeah, I'll bet. She's a Riverlander. This is like their Rapture or something, of course she's gonna think it's good.”
go the way I want it to!?”
“Oh, honey, I'm not the woman to ask about those kinds of things,” she said, lips turned up as if keeping a secret behind them. “You might go back down to the square, you see, and take a left on Hanson, and right on that corner you'll want to talk to Sugar Byrne. A specialty shop, that's what she's got. Knows all about birds. Good girl, Sugar Byrne.”
“This is not about me,” Dean said, a sharp drop into clarity, a snap. He shook his head, firmly. “I am not—
“She’s not interested?” Dean said, frowning.
Pale green weathered wood and a thick mattress. There was a bit of an inhale in the room, the furniture, it seemed, the bedstead, the dressing table, the violets on the sideboard under the window sill, all of them straightening from their crooked postures.
“Kid who came in,” Sam muttered, looking meaningfully over Cas' shoulder. Cas turned a little in his seat, wincing at the burn of torn muscle in his leg; when he saw the young man at the bar, he frowned.
“Well, that's the other thing,” Sam said, gently closing the river journal. “They both died in the crash—right? But this guy was on a lower deck, and his journal survived, somehow. Ended up in a shed in the Ozarks. Porter would have been above him—his stuff might have been even more intact, so—if someone managed to get their hands on some poor chump's diary—”
“So you've heard of it.”
“I don't see why you can't.”
And Castiel slept on.
“We'll test him when we get back to Winona,” Cas said, quietly. “And then we'll figure out what to do next.”
Dean—who by this point was reaching negative levels of tolerance for anything out of the ordinary—drove them, all four, to the nearest motel, booked a few nights with the sourest look on his face Sam had seen in a while, and herded Yann between the three of them into the dark, cold cube of a room. He flicked on the buzzing lights; Cas sat down hard on the far bed, Sam folded his arms and fixed the kid with a stiff look, and Dean shot home the door lock before turning to face him.
, taking rest, coming in, into him, and he would be around him, two into one.
“Ah, well,” she laughed, and shyly offered him her hand, fingers extended to show off the full extent of her palm. “You can always tell one by their hand!”
Dean considered, briefly, before he drifted off—acutely aware of the weight of Cas' turned back behind him on the bed, the sad little clutch of his fingers on the pillow—whispering an apology, just something to clear the air a little; but he was so tired, and Cas—he wasn't sure he even knew about Cas anymore.
“They’re stealing,” Cas said with mild horror, shoving forward before Dean could put out a hand to stop him. It was only soda, after all.
“Went to make a phone call,” Sam said, shifting his attention to Cas to change to the subject. “Dude—Cas, I had no idea you could dance like that!”
“Yeah,” he whispered.
The sun speared through the windshield as they crossed the state line, the change complete and immediate. The light glared into Sam’s eyes as he drove and had Dean stirring in his sleep, the warmth on his face sudden and intense. The dismal green miles gave way, and the bruise-yellow veil of rain and trapped light parted.
Sam lingered there, by the door; Cas swayed a little on his feet, eyes still fixed to the floor, as if he were trying to puzzle out some great secret about it.
Dean couldn't say why he woke when he did. At first he thought it was because the bedside clock was flashing at him—generic twelve-oh-oh, as if the power had gone out—but lying there, breathing, trying to decipher it, he realized that the weight of Cas on the mattress behind him was gone.
“Baby,” Dean whispered after a while, and Cas could feel the start of the spiral, the pins-and-needles in his feet, travel up his body. Every brush of his cock against Dean’s stomach left him reeling, in time with the shifts where Dean was buried inside of him, Dean’s face hidden in his neck, their chests scraping with every shallow thrust pushing them further together.
"Yeah," he said gruffly, clearing his throat. "We've been briefed on that - it's some kind of religious mark."
"How am I supposed to know - I just—" Cas stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. "I'm not enough for him. And he won't tell me how to improve, he just shoves me aside. I want to improve, I want to fix whatever's wrong, but he won't even give me a chance!"
A heavy clock left over from the eighties ticked on the window sill, and the pan sizzled.
Up ahead the festival twinkled, a dazzling haze of lights rising up out of the prairie. Sam and Lily fell into step together, Sam slowing his pace to match hers better, his legs far longer than her own. They gravitated together as they walked, her shoulder bumping his arm every few feet. Sam slipped his hands into his pockets and tipped his head back slightly as he walked, looking up at the bright smears of stars across the velvety black.
“It could be.”
fault!" Cas said, nearly shouting, and Sam nodded sympathetically.
He looked down. A pair of boots, brown and worn with age but still in good condition. They looked about as ancient as the woman herself.
“Don’t hold your breath on that one,” Dean muttered, already convinced they were walking straight into another loose end.
“Not really, no.”
Sam and Dean's first interaction with Sugar Byrne lasted approximately three minutes. They went inside, she bustled out to meet them, shook their hands—Sam caught sight of the star in her palm and fixed his eyes on it for the rest of the conversation—told them her address, which Dean jotted down in his phone after a moment of confusion, and then shooed them off, chirping about having to close up shop for the afternoon soon. They were hustled out of the store and found themselves right back on the sidewalk, Dean and Sam in something of a daze, Cas chewing on the inside of his lip.
“Would you rather be here investigating a horrific death or having a little time to relax?” Cas leaned on Dean's arm to get up the steps, more out of habit than pain at this point.
Sam frowned, and Dean caught his look, pausing in the grass between the trees.
“What?”
didn't smooth out bruises and bury blood. It didn't do a damn bit of good.
Sam and Dean were done with small towns, it seemed. They fought over where to go next; Sam insisted that it didn’t matter where they went, they just had to keep it up.
“I don’t know,” Sam said quietly. “I mean, it kind of could be natural…the current could change on its own, couldn’t it?”
"Well, there isn't too much science to it. We're gonna haul it up using those ropes, and two of em' will push it up and keep it steady, and then once it's up we'll hold the lines taught so they can set it. Now, the initial pull ain't hard. That's nothing because you're movin', but keepin' that line is the tougher part. Maintaining everything so that it's square and don't shift."
Before he drifted off, he became aware of a twinge in the room, something hovering, he felt. Something about to fall and break, almost, though he couldn't place it, and by the time his mind caught onto it, he was already asleep.
“Just be careful with it, yeah? Don't want you out of commission.” Dean picked up the rolled Ace bandage from the comforter and lifted Cas' leg over his own to bind it back up, efficiently, gently. He felt Yann staring from across the room but couldn't be bothered to comment on it.
They drove back, the Byrnes in their truck and the hunters in the Impala, in the glossy dark, under a sky devoid of city light and pinpricked full of stars. There wasn't much talk when they arrived, only the simple instructions of Sugar for her guests—the shower in the upstairs bathroom had a busted handle, had to be turned back and forth a little to get hot water. Breakfast in the morning, and they'd chat about things—implicit in her words were
He sat up, throwing the covers back, and leaned over to turn on the light. Sam shifted in his sleep and then blinked awake, grumbling incoherently, and then he sat up as well, leaning on his elbow.
Dean couldn't fall asleep.
“When's the wedding?” she asked.
“You think?”
“Dean, I'm fine.”
They were in the middle of a dirt lot, surrounded by rows of cars at least a hundred long, the Impala a black splotch in the middle of the rusted-over reds and sun-washed blues of the other vehicles. Up ahead, people trickled under a huge wooden arch featuring a marquee for the festival. Beyond that, there were the fluttering tops of tents and pennants attached to booths and the conspicuous rise of a Ferris wheel into the blue sky at the end of the midway.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw that Dean had gone slightly pale, and was staring at her now not so much with irritation but with trepidation. Cas' hand had snaked around his and was clutching it tightly.
"Ho?" Her hoarse voice met their ears. "Who this on my porch?"
"Mamma," Yann said, attempting to sound annoyed, and she hushed him, continuing to scrape the rest of the casserole onto Yann's plate.
Dean rocked into Cas, long smooth strokes opening them up, in and in and in. Closed distance with no room between them, and he felt weightless, hands traveling up over Cas’ legs, his sides, meeting.
Le Beau returned home, and six months later, forty cherry trees had arrived at his door. They were immediately put down by the river, and with his yearly bonus, Le Beau had transformed the whole grove into a promenade, with real marble fountains and a river walk.
Besides, watching Dean had always been his favorite pastime.
He thought of the weight Dean had shed, in Matsu Kami's house on the river, the sadness he'd sobbed out over the table.
Dean scoffed. “Well, yeah.” He leaned against the bureau, toying with one of the loose white knobs. “This is nice, I guess, but it's still weird. We're not getting any further from weird. Or any closer to—whatever, you know.
“Give me a minute, Cas, you're gonna catch your death.”
For one moment more they sat there, looking up at the house, and at Olivia watching them on the porch.
Madame Olivia sat down in one of the armchairs in the corner. She folded her legs, and rested her cane on the armrest, and laced her fingers together in her lap, and watched.
The hours soothed away their tension. For at least a while, the notion of any badness she might contain in the lines in her palms was set to rest. She had fed them, she had hosted them, and though they were still wary of the religion she kept and the things she spoke of, they knew—instinctively—that this woman had no evil in her.
“Don’t have doubles,” she said lazily, the oscillating fan further down the counter ruffling her hair as it swiveled. She scratched her bare shoulder and adjusted her tank-top strap.
“You go have a good time, sugar!” she called, and Lily grinned, walking around and towards Sam. He straightened up immediately, his Adam's apple bobbing as she approached.
"Cedar's good," Dean commented. It didn't matter, though; the size of the wall alone meant a daunting weight, regardless of what it was made out of. Drum nodded and clapped his hands together, gaining the attention of the rest of the group. They walked around the perimeter of the house after checking the ropes, and went round to the other side where they were laid straight out on the ground, snaking through the naked beams.
Sam and Cas looked at her; Dean choked on his food, beating his fist against his chest. Celeste watched him, eyebrow raised.
A small silence fell; Dean and Cas looked at him, and then at each other, and Dean laughed, quietly.
After he was done, Cas went to it for a moment, just to see if Dean had played along at all.
, Dean thought.
to anyone. It was always shitty motel springs, thin and useless comforters, or roll-away beds with stiff pillows, loveseats under hotel windows next to the rattling air conditioners. He'd never stayed the night in a place that was
"Peaceful," he said, after a minute.
Cas nodded slightly to her. He was looking at her in the way he looked at everyone—with wide eyes and for too long at a time—and she fidgeted, turning her attention to Sam.
“I'm—Castiel,” Cas said, awkwardly. “This is Sam, and his brother Dean.”
"Sam, I think it's all the same story.”
was cause for anger.
He began walking. Straight into the water.
Cas leaned around the partition unexpectedly, favoring his good leg, and cast Dean a small smile when Dean looked up.
Mattie nodded, her pale eyes sparkling. “Are you boys on a road-trip, then?”
He had promised him more than this. He had promised him better than this.
“Promise you’ll pick up the phone, then,” he said, and she rolled her eyes.
A quiet break, a moment of captured transcendence.
They were already setting the two by fours for the ramp against the wall. Like a bottle hastily uncorked his strength flooded back through him, adrenaline racing in his veins. He had not disappointed. He had accomplished and succeeded.
“This is
“Nobody got a look at that book, son. Amos Porter just talked out of it. Some of the stories folks knew in one version or another, some they didn’t. He gave it some consistency, tied it all up into something people could tell from start to finish.”
They crested some hill and Earl Jones slowed the pickup to a lurching stop, brakes screaming. Men a little ways off in the distance looked up, mopping their faces and lifting their hands.
“Me too,” Dean said, voice low. “It’s okay.”
Cas’ head tipped back and Dean sucked a dull mark on the curve of his ribcage.
“I didn’t think there’d be so many people,” Sam said, following Dean to get their IDs from the trunk. The teenagers had dispersed, ambling towards the fairgrounds, leaving them alone in their row.
Dean shook his head, Cas lifting his face to look at him again, standing alone in the middle of the unfamiliar room, bare chest flushed.
She bent over the hope chest she was rifling through, clucking her tongue. Baby’s tail hung out of one end, the snake nosing through the contents with her mistress, and Dean standing off to one side, watching, waiting, and bouncing on his heels.
“Love you,” Dean said, gruffly, closing his eyes. His arms encircled Cas' waist and pulled him in close to his body.
“Not the same,” Dean replied, kissing Cas’ collarbone before letting his body slip sideways, arms pulling Cas against his chest. “Not my husband.”
Cas noted hazily that the wound on Dean's lip where he'd nearly bitten through was almost healed, nothing but a dark scab now.
His head felt strangely light. He wasn't used to it—having nothing to frantically record, nothing to ponder and bemoan.
No stars in his palms.
“Because there's
“Cade!”
“If you have any trouble just come back and I’ll see what I can do, alright? And if you see Old Mattie you ask after her. She’s a real sweet woman. Shy as they come, but sweet.”
She was in his contacts list—he'd foolishly recorded her number there, one of the few names between
He said this last phrase with total sincerity, and an instant of understanding passed between Nate and Cas that neither Sam nor Dean were able to engage in. It was something intangible that Cas had conveyed. Something defined by more than just his words—a feeling that Nate appeared to recognize.
They sat above the river for a time together and Castiel watched the water, waiting for the catfish to make a reappearance, waiting for the brush of its slick back beneath the soles of his feet again.
"You remember what I am saying," she whispered. "Whatever you learn, it is knowledge that belongs to you and you alone. And that is the way it has always been."
They made their way slowly back up the levee, both Dean and Cas leaning on Sam's shoulders for support, Dean limping on his injured ankle and Cas still a little dazed. As soon as they got back to the open room, Sam deposited them both in the bathroom to clean up, and, after making sure they were both alive and not likely to walk back into the river anytime soon, closed the front door and went gratefully back to bed.
“This is—this is really stunning, Mrs Olsson,” Sam said.
Cas rocked his hips down, hands slipping on Dean’s stomach, up over his chest. He leaned back and forward, every movement sending rolls of pleasure down his spine; the sensation of warm water trickling down his back from the crown of his head to the backs of his knees, pooling in the low point of him, where gravity nestled and tugged him down onto Dean’s cock.
While Sam's patented brand of self-deprecation usually made Castiel feel sad, he was currently much too consumed with how much he wanted to punch someone's lights out to let it get to him.
Then Cas was there, and then Dean, and David bringing up the rear, trudging through the mud, looking—as always—ready to faceplant into the water at any given moment.
“A couple freak harvests, some nice weather, that isn't much.”
"...I wish I could explain it to you. I really do."
sleep here, he could—with Cas behind him, holding him; with Sam in the opposite bed.
She tilted her head at Sam, casting him a look as if he were crazy, confirming what they had come here for.
“It is odd,” he continued, glancing at Momoko, who was beaming, but trying to contain it for the sake of modesty. “Before this business of you two, I was, as you say,
“A man builds a fine house; and now he has a master, and a task for life: he is to furnish, watch, show it, and keep it in repair, the rest of his days.”
“Hello,” Cas said.
” said Dean. “
, and we don’t, because when the fuck does
A macaw squawked loudly in the enclosure to his right and Cas drew near, peering between the bars. The beady bird-eye stared back, winking in the light, head twitching from side to side, emerald green and royal blue feathers ruffling when it puffed its wings up.
The trees were arranged in two long rows of twenty, lining the path, and at the end they broadened out into a sweeping curve along the river both upstream and downstream. It was all seen through the tunnel of trees, their branches arcing over the brick path, tangled and twined, growing in and amongst one another until all that remained was a ceiling of pink.
“Well, tell us how you really
“Oh yeah,” Lily said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. She laughed, a little anxiously. “If you ask a Riverlander they'll tell you that the whole reason our orchard even grows is because we irrigate with river water, straight from the Mississippi. That that's the reason we've got such
Castiel forgot about his bruises and the bites. He forgot about the ache in his lower back and the weakness in his legs. Forfeited all of it for the cord of desire winding down his spine, the vine-like spiral nestling between his vertebrae, the buzzing places at the back of his knees and the arches of his feet.
In a moment of clarity, they found themselves on the porch. None of them really remembered the slow climb out of the car or the wandering path of their feet up to the steps. It was cool under the blue shadows of the portico. Their eyes touched on the beams and the solid wood under their feet and the heavy door frame and the tendrils of ivy caressing the house.
They waited on the banks until the traffic on the bridge had died down, and then four silhouettes waded carefully into the river, past the fluttering police tape in the rough rectangle around where Hailey Horner had washed ashore, no tools besides their bare hands.
“I don’t know much about Riverlanders,” he admitted, knowing his gaze had been caught, looking up at her eyes. She froze for a moment and then relaxed, recognizing the innocent curiosity in his expression.
Dean shook his head, shoving past to the kitchen with Cas nearly in tow. Cas let out his breath on a stutter and closed his eyes. Sam followed after.
She’d had a client who had really admired it. Spent a good hour tracing the contours of her back, the clouds and sprays of constellations, the shimmering colors blending and melting into one another. He’d been an English teacher and had smiled at her as he passed his hand over her skin.
He shuddered.
Cas pulled back and laughed when Dean followed him.
The three men paused in her crowded and claustrophobic front hall while she vanished into the kitchen. The place was stiflingly small, and dark—thin streetlamp light under the drowning sunset crept in small strips through the crooked blinds; a television sat on a cardboard box, facing a couch that had seen better days; a single photograph, of a family, in a square frame too tiny for the wall on which it hung, was the only decoration. Two mismatched lamps. Past the kitchen, which was hidden by a corner of wall, the hall stretched on just a little ways, opening into what looked like a cracked and shabby bathroom, and a bedroom.
“We followed your grandfather here,” Cas said, assuming she was the granddaughter, looking into her pale round face and her dark winking eyes.
,” he read—aloud, but so softly that even he could hardly hear— “
"And?"
Cas smiled at Dean.
"What do you do?" Sam prodded, and Helena opened her mouth but Yann beat her to the answer.
“Robbie, lookit here!” one of them cried, reaching into the busted machine and pulling out a Coke bottle.
“I will give you a few minutes, then?” she asked, gesturing at their menus, and Sam agreed with her, the three of them opening them up as she left, the kitchen doors swinging behind her.
“Missing what? Another excuse?”
“Maybe something'll pop up soon and we can chase that,” Sam said, pacifying.
“Look—angel.” The reaper straightened his shoulders. “A word of friendly advice. You don't want anything to do with it.”
“Are you hungry again?” Cas said, turning his head to look not at Sam, but Dean.
She held up her hands, and they all stared at her. She opened and closed her hands, like fireflies blinking at each other—and the stars tattooed there in her palms, as entirely unsurprising as sunrise itself, flashed as well.
“I love you and I don’t know what to do,” Dean whispered.
“He was clever enough, yes,” Cas replied. He bent for a kiss.
"Gotta raise up one more wall today and start sheetrockin' the rest, but she's a mighty fine lookin' house, ain't she?" The sheriff smiled, tamping his boot on the dirt, adjusting his heel.
Before the dawn, before the light broke, sudden, brilliant, spectacular.
“About as professional as a handmade press badge and two associates who are more interested in each other than in getting their info,” she replied, eyeing him up.
takin' a lunch break. Y’all need anything you can holler at me later.”
Dean let himself be held closely and carefully, pulled back into the dream, back into the room, into gold.
“Cas, she was lying.”
“Do you know where it might be now?”
December, then, and the frost on the ground, and all the doors of the house on River Ridge open to air out the must of Mathilda's departure. There wasn't much to move in—only things to be cleaned, broken casements and wainscots to be fixed, and a pleasant clamor rang out from its halls out to the water—Dean, fixing the lean-to behind the place where wood would be stored in the cold months; Sam replacing the wallpaper in one of the upstairs bedrooms; Lily and Castiel finding places in the cabinets for the new dining sets they'd bought in Elsbrook, knocking elbows and grinning at each other like shy new friends. The sounds of porcelain mingling with the steady rhythm of Dean's hammer out back, and the loud curling sound of Sam tearing down the paper upstairs.
“I’m about to give you the best advice anyone’s ever gonna give you,” he said, his fingers still gripping the sleeve at Dean’s elbow. His wiry eyebrows knit together. “Quit. Quit while you’re ahead. Get outta this business while you’ve got people to get out of it with.”
When they got back to Sam's room, the lamps were on to cast off the falling night, and Sam was sitting cross-legged on his bed, for all the world a twelve-year-old reading a comic book. The journal was spread out on the comforter in front of him, all the envelopes and loose pages neatly stacked beside the leather covers.
Dean frowned. Much to his frustration, he really didn't.
She wiggled her fingers.
Castiel wiped the condensation off of his hand onto the napkin beside his plate and slowly extracted himself from the booth, swaying slightly once he was on his feet. Dean followed, hauling himself up with a groan; his back was stiff and every inch of him wanted to lie down and not get up again for a few years. Dean brushed by Cas, and Sam shook his head at Dean’s mood, the three of them migrating towards the cash register. Walking past the boy, Dean could hear him scraping his plate, eager to get as much food as he could, and the sound followed him all the way down the counter to the check out.
There was one extremely disinterested teenage girl manning the front desk at the motel they parked at, knee deep in a tabloid and rolling a tic-tac across her teeth as she jotted them down in the registry.
He picked his way gently through the mud up onto the creaking boards of Mattie's dock, hesitantly made his way out to its end, precarious and warped over the current. Turning to look back, he could only see the slope, and nothing above it—not the edge of the rise, not the Impala, not the house. He was sealed off from everything else, reduced to the floating riverbank and the dock and the water, like some nebulous dream-world.
Sam chuckled. “It's just a suspender clasp.”
Sam’s shoulders slumped. “No thank you!” he yelled again, over the sidewalk, and the girl pressed her bright pink lips tightly together and shook her head, waving him over more forcefully, her eyes beseeching.
“That’s my daddy’s store over there,” she said absently, pointing across the street while she rolled up the window till it was just barely cracked on top. Sam peered around her. Greenacre General and Feed.
Yann released them and rocked back on his heels, smile as huge and glowing as a crescent moon.
over his shoulder, and Cas drew Dean into the other and closed the door behind them. The lantern on the sill was lit—Nate must have done it, while Sugar was telling them about the shower—and it was the only light, a soft yellow-orange glow painting watercolor streaks across the bed and the wall.
There was a silence, and he could almost see her. Maybe she’d let her hair down to sleep, but it was hot, so maybe it was up. A messy bun on the top of her head sagging from being smushed against her pillow and long chestnut strands sticking to her face. A T-shirt, or maybe a nightgown, or it didn’t matter. Her eyes even darker in the surrounding night, lids cracked sleepily.
“I guess we're done here.”
Dean groaned. “Oh, great. So he
“Cas just became human. I don’t think he’s really one to be talking,” Dean snapped, shoving the pump back into its cradle, eyes hard.
Cas kissed him, then—a gentle kiss, nothing forward, nothing hard, just a very little sweetness, a very little touch.
“He doesn’t know!” she shouted, still reaching for Dean, moving to break free of Tomas’ arms. “Someone has to tell him!”
She stared at him some more, not with anger but with mild shock at the question, and then tore her eyes away, walking quickly up to the door at Marlene’s. He worried for a moment that she was mad at him – that she was offended by his forwardness, but there was something about Lily Francis that was undeniably big. Sam had hardly known her an hour and he could tell that she had outgrown Greenacre by miles. Sam turned, following her movement, anxious of what her face would look like.
“I don't know.” Cas ran his hands over his face. “I don't know about anything, to be honest.”
“We'll make it work.”
She turned around from the cupboard she was digging through, shaking a box of Hamburger Helper at them.
It would be three goddamn buttons. Maybe he'd be lucky and get voicemail. Much less awkward, right?
“You know, you don’t have to cook for us,” Dean said, breaking the silence with what they'd all been thinking to begin with, and she turned and looked at him over her blue-inked shoulder.
Castiel, asleep, peaceful and unmoving—but from his nose, from his mouth, a steady stream of what looked like smoke.
Clothes suddenly felt wet and dragging, plastered to them, too close, not close enough, and what were they to do with these damn clothes? All the second skin, doing away with it, and the cliff was getting closer, but someone was driving the car, someone
“Okay.”
Watch over a century of nights."
“I'm—yeah, yeah, I'm fine. More than fine.”
“There was an article in there?” Cas asked, curious.
“Can you hear the river?” Cas asked, closing his eyes, holding Dean's face in his hands. A dreamy little whisper, and Dean's words caught in his mouth like breath, heavy and sweet on his tongue. “It's like a song.”
“Ain't you the angel?” David said, peering at the skinny blue-eyed man sitting to his left.
“I don't think so.”
kind of legwork, at least. Instead they were stuck filling the black hole that was Dean’s stomach and not making any progress.
“Yeah?” Dean drawled, pulling Cas’ cock gently. Cas exhaled a laugh; Dean was nudging at that place inside of him that made everything fireflies.
“I have a date!” she yelled to someone, cupping her free hand over her mouth and then gesturing at Sam with a shrug. Someone whooped and she laughed, head back, her hip touching his.
Sam looked at his brother, eyebrows raised.
Castiel deflated and let his hands slap against his sides. He didn’t turn around even as Sam hid his laughter and Dean bit the inside of his mouth, the first to move. The hunter ruffled his angel’s hair, pushing his head down playfully.
in his direction.
“Yes. It’s right off the interstate.”
Lily whistled, long and low. “Of course. Everybody's heard of him. Kinda hard to grow up in this town without knowing about Amos Porter.”
Dean and Cas were one giant lump on the next bed with their limbs so tangled he couldn’t tell one body from the other, and it made him glad.
"Over and over. The girl who swallowed the stones, the princess, the catfish. Maybe it's just been ending wrong. I don't know. The way—the way I've heard the Riverlanders talk, they made it seem—like they always end sad. They hurt each other or lose each other. They drown each other, but the catfish—maybe the catfish can make it all end alright. Someday."
"In a desk they had stowed in there. I wasn't even looking for it, I was just being nosy, and there it freaking is, just lying in this drawer..."
Construction on the highway had cleared up enough by the time they reached it, after the slow crawl down from the ridge, that they managed to be out of Elsbrook just as another storm was broiling on the horizon up ahead. The long stretch of asphalt was near-deserted in both directions, and Cas had rolled the back seat windows down, and cool electrified air was rippling in as they sped down through hills toward the clouds.
"Well, there she is!" the sheriff said, hauling himself out of the truck. He had scrapped his uniform and hung it in the backseat in favor of a work shirt and threadbare jeans, unconcerned with being off duty. As far as anyone was concerned, the busted Coke machine was the greatest threat of the day and it had already been conquered before lunchtime.
One half of the miniature room went dark when Sam turned out his bedside lamp, and Dean and Cas remained sitting on their bed, side by side, staring off at the wainscoting.
“That was odd, wasn’t it?” Cas probed, and she hesitated.
“I think he wants to make a phone call,” Cas said, back at the table, without taking his eyes off the dancers. Dean looked away from where his brother’s back had just disappeared out of the building. That didn’t bode well.
Everyone knew the Francis sisters. Even without the family orchard or Clint Francis (arguably the most bombastic man in Dodge County) for an uncle, they still would have remained notorious on premise alone.
All things shining.
For a long moment they froze there in tableau—Dean staring at the dark, Cas staring at him, at the soft curve of his jaw and the set of his mouth and the pallor of his face in the wake of what he'd said.
“Mighty fine wedding.” Nate’s voice lilted. “A wedding of all things. Earth and sky. Water and air. Everything coming together, beginning as one.”
Unexpectedly, from the couch, Cas said, “Is there something else you want to tell us, Yann?”
“I have seen so much,” Cas mused, casual and airy, tapping Dean’s collarbone, dragging fingers over his chest. He adjusted a little against the soft warmth of Dean’s stomach. “The Okavango delta during the floods...sequoia trees when they were hardly more than seedlings...the heights of every mountain on this planet. I walked the flat earth where they would be before my Father pushed them up into existence.” His voice was soft and thoughtful. He picked up Dean’s hands, pushed them together, fingers steepling under his touch. He raised the cathedral of bone and skin to his lips and kissed.
You are the lucky bodies. The culmination. And this was always meant to come to pass. And I have waited all my years, and cheated Death for most of them, to see it, and the whole wide world has known that it was coming, and it has made the way straight for you. That pale boy in the cold places knew it first, and all the others since, and they have been guiding you, making their own choices in turn, and they have left you with the final choice.
. For fun. Weird, but not terrible?”
“Be not inhospitable to strangers, lest they be angels in disguise.”
“Get the hell off me, lady, I don’t understand!” Dean snapped, voice faltering, feeling more scared than he had in a long time. “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
"You hear that?" she said, and Dean blanched.
They stood silently in the kitchen afterward, shuttling their dishes to the huge porcelain trough sink, stacking them neatly inside.
,” Nate answered. “Sometimes a miracle is more about the work it takes to make it. A miracle could depend on a lot of little choices, a lot of little things before it becomes a miracle. A lot of days of grinding through it all, a lot of days of waiting for something to happen and trying for it in the meantime.” He looked at him, hard. “I think you know that.”
She'd forgotten him already, he was sure. A woman as beautiful as Lily Francis would never dwell on a strange tall gangly thing like him, there one minute and taking off the next.
Dean rolled his shoulders. “Yeah, thanks, Captain Physics.”
They kissed, tongues rolling, and Dean pushed up, laid him flat on the bed, rocking his hips slowly against Cas’, feeling him lift up to meet him, mouths parting for a spare moment, breath thin.
He put the end of the Snickers bar wrapper in his mouth and pulled it apart, biting into the candy and sighing.
Dean pulled off with a rough bump of teeth and bit hard at Cas' inner thigh before returning his attention to the spit-slicked cock in front of him.
Cas stroked the machine again, tapping his fingers on the metal edge.
“Oh,” she whispered, her arms still bent at her sides, fingers curled around an invisible edge. She didn’t blink, and Dean tried to pry his eyes away from her own, but they held onto him hard. She brought one coffee-colored hand to her mouth. “Oh,” she breathed again, and he watched in horror as her eyes went glassy and brimming.
“Sit! Don’t hover! Sit!” She reached out to pull Dean next, and he started away before she could.
“You boys alright?” he said, cautious.
such a word!—might be hiding.
“So, what do
that I don’t appreciate that, but, that’s not – that’s not what I came out here for.”
He felt horrible.
“And you need our help?”
With him, in him, like nothing he’d ever felt. Soul within soul, stones cradled in the same gentle hand, and then swaying – trees in the wind; cherry blossoms floating in spirals behind his eyes, motes of quiet dust, the creak of floorboards as the bed shifted. Quiet. Quiet.
Out of the corner of his eye Dean looked at him—his lean body under Dean's clothes, and Sam's clothes. They'd consigned the old raggedy trench coat to the trunk for the warm months weeks ago and now Cas wore what the brothers had to spare, worn-out jeans and button-downs, soft T-shirts, jackets. Dean's shirt, today, dark red plaid, and Sam's jeans, too long and paler blue even than Cas' eyes. They suited him, Dean thought. They suited his form and his shape.
“Well?” Dean said, and Cas scooted his chair back, staring up to his face.
“Winona it is,” Dean said. He reached forward to turn up the radio, but there was nothing good playing, so he turned it down again instead, the hush swelling in the cab again.
Neither Sam nor Cas indulged him. After all this time, they were well-adjusted to feeling out the danger of a place by the instinct in their bones, and there was nothing even remotely threatening about this house. Dean's paranoia was beginning to grate a little on both of them.
“People like us.”
Out of the corner of his eye he saw blood welling to the surface of a welt on Dean's back, and without knowing what he was doing he reached out, touched it, smeared it away. Dean flinched, and did not turn his head.
They walked until the noise of the festival became a distant hum, and the Ferris wheel was a twinkling specter without shape, just a mass of spinning lights in the night. A ladder had been left propped against a trunk, and Cas climbed up the first few rungs, reaching up into the leaves to find an un-plucked peach.
“Lo siento, I’m sorry!”
He smiled at Death, and Death returned a grudging twitch of the lips, and they existed a minute more in one another's company—both of them, it seemed, content in some way at last.
Through the window of the restaurant, past the painted letters of the name
They learned to train their anticipation, to dull it down to something manageable. It became a quiet murmur of thought in the backs of their heads, the thread that tugged them through the idle hours and minutes and seconds.
Life on the Ridge continues
In silence under the dark roiling of the thunderstorm they cleaned each other, twisting out the blood from the washrags under the warm sink tap, soothing the bite marks and bruises as best they could. They winced and shifted, blinking hazily with half-sleep and flick-eyed pleas for forgiveness, and when they were done—or as done as it was possible to be—Cas touched Dean's face and stroked it, gently, thumbing over his cheekbone, trying not to look at the scab forming on his lip.
"So to what do I owe the pleasure, Sam, 'just Sam'?" she said. He wondered what her bed looked like. If she was lying down or sitting up, legs drawn up chin resting on her knees. “At the—
thing! Fuck, Cas, this is supposed to be the
or something else, he didn’t know. He didn’t like the lack of control sleep brought, the way his body sought out Cas on its own. He didn’t like how easy it felt, because easy meant letting your guard down.
Cas looked at him for a moment before he obeyed, pulling off his wet tee-shirt and boxer briefs and tossing them into the bathtub. Dean followed suit, shivering with night cold on his skin, and draped a towel over Cas' head, gripping it and scrubbing, pushing it over his face and his neck and his shoulders, chest, arms, cleaning off the clinging water a little too roughly.
Dean sighed heavily, pushing his hair back and scratching at his neck, shaking his head.
“Upstairs,” Cas whispered, and Dean nodded, as though they wouldn’t have gotten there otherwise. Cas tried to hide his urgency, tried to temper the heat already starting to prick under his fingernails.
They looked back to the man. He had not taken a drink yet, but watched them, recognizing their hesitance. He touched the rim of his cup with the pads of his thin fingers.
"Not at all," Dean sounded, finally taking up food, smiling at her.
When they lay down together Dean held Castiel's face and kissed him, not too hard and not too deep, and they tangled themselves together for warmth and comfort and watched the rain leave glimmering streaks in the underglow of the porch light on the window, and the leafy branches of the tree outside scrape Morse messages on its surface.
“Your uncle? Are you—you're one of the Francis girls, then?”
“Yes!” she replied after a moment of internal translation, bowing slightly before stepping back and to the side, making room in the doorway. “You are here to have tea! Please come in!”
“My name is Tomas and I will—be your—” the boy huffed, tongue rolling out the mechanical greeting as he put down the tray on their table— “Waiter today. Are you ready to order.” It came out as less of a question and more of a statement.
“I'm hungry,” Dean announced, snappish, slamming the phone book closed and getting up off the bed. “Are you guys hungry? I'm hungry. Let's go eat.”
It was very much Mary Winchester's Dean.
There was a moment of silence as the connection crackled and then the sharp artificial ringing sound.
Dean rolled his hips and Cas arched, his words falling into thin air.
Castiel stared at it.
There was another sharp rap and Dean forced himself up and away into the blue light of the room. He shrugged on jeans and a shirt and slipped out of the room into the hallway where Olivia was waiting.
“You wanna put up for the night or look around?” Dean said, before Cas could call him out. He fidgeted his hand on the wheel and clenched and unclenched his hands.
She trailed off, as if unsure of herself, and turned away from him again, hands lying nervous in her lap, looking out at the farmhouse. Sam settled into his seat, and looked at the house as well—it seemed somehow detached from them in the cab of the truck. The entire world seemed one step removed, and for the first time that night Sam thought it had nothing to do with the fact that Lily Francis was as gorgeous as she was. It was something to do with what she was saying.
. “Son of a bitch!”
to hold them, because there was something in the room, there was something surging out of their bodies and it had to be let out, and they had to keep their ground.
And the only way I can think of to be sure if this stuff is leading up to something good or something bad is to have the thing, in my hands, and read it for myself.”
“Baby, I’m sorry,” Dean said again, as if it were all he had left to say.
“Okay,” Sam said. “She can't be too deep. It looks a lot less shallow than it is. So—I say we just start feeling around.”
“It’s – it’s uh, not the boys. It’s me,” he stammered, squinting his eyes up in embarrassment. Brilliant, Winchester.
“Ask me.” The whispered reply hovering against his mouth, but not touching it, waiting. “Ask me, and I will give it to you.”
“I’m gonna make you so happy,” he whispered. “I will.”
“Did you swallow a lot of water? I swear to God if you up and die of cholera or some shit—”
' Yada yada, okay, buddy, get to the good stuff.” Dean scrolled his finger down the page, searching for words that might leap out at him.
“He's a god,” Cas said, trying to make conversation.
"Well enough," Dean said, hand still caught in the darker one's grip.
“We need a double,” Dean said, and she looked up at him through her lashes and then back down at the book she was recording them in.
They stumbled out of the cantina and into the harsh sunlight, Cas dragging Dean to the car with the efficient strength of the soldier he was. He opened the door and shoved Dean into the back and climbed in after him, Sam jogging out of the front and into the driver’s seat.
Dean shifted, moved down between his legs and pushed them open, kissed the insides of his thighs, mouthed at the sharp lines of his hips.
Sam hardly had time to knock on the door before it was opening, and Yann, all his five-feet-nine-inches of bony elbows and pale hair, was grinning up at all of them.
“I never expected to hear the word
“Most people don’t want to know about all the boring hard work,” she chuckled, flashing him a brilliant smile. They were in town now, and Sam could see the restaurant on the corner, the name written in huge fancy script. The streets were deserted; no one coming or going, though a few cars were parked along the sidewalks, mostly trucks like Lily’s. She shifted into park with a lurch and a crank of gears, the music cutting off with the engine.
A small group of young women and their beaus, next to him, cheered and whooped, and several more couples spun off the floor, and now Cas and Dean were dancing on the edge of the center, the focal point of what seemed nearly everyone, clapping and shouting for them, but they were oblivious, Sam saw, oblivious to the crowds, laughing and lost in figuring out the steps, making it up as they went, Cas leading Dean more than the other way round, leaning from his arm and pulling him in and out.
hour of asscrack-of-dawn o'clock? I was sleeping.”
“To show our happiness,” Momoko said, as Dean lifted it out, unfolding it. Stretched across the frame was a beautiful depiction of cherry trees, their dark branches converging upwards into a mass of pale pink petals shimmering with touches of gold and white.
Then they were inside, in the warmth of the house and the smell of something on in the kitchen, and Sam with a face drawn from a day of reading coming out to tell them that dinner was ready, and for a moment, with Cas tucked in against his side and the rain behind them through the open door, Dean felt extraordinarily at home.
“Oh, it’s all backwoods talk. Stars on their palms and they don’t eat fish, or maybe it was just one kind of fish. Catfish. All I know is Old Mattie. She’s got the stars and she lives in the big house. The real big one. Can’t miss it. Can practically see it from the bottom. It’s got the fancy dome on the porch. Her husband built that for her right after she lost that first little baby, or so they say. Got the biggest garden in Missouri too, and like I said, you can see the eaves from the bottom. Once you see the flowers pouring out over the road you’ll know you’re there, but it’s a bit windy and folks get lost a lot.”
wreck, Dean.”
Without knowing particularly why, Cas closed his eyes and pushed his fingers against them, rubbing some mild exhaustion from them, and when he opened them again it was to see the winter sun pulling out from behind the clouds, leaving glimmering specks of light against the river. To his eyes, for a moment, the Missouri landscape lay shimmering, fairy-lit and dazzling, everything made bright and wondrous, a momentary gathering of glamor on the water and the hills.
“Now—I'm afraid,” she said, as they trailed nervously after her, “that all I've got are twin beds upstairs, so two of you might have to share. But I don't think that'll be a problem.” She waved her hands aimlessly as if brushing aside the thought; Dean and Cas exchanged glances. “And seeing as Nate and I will be out tonight, you all are coming to the dance with us.”
At this the reaper paused again, visibly wary to speak. Nerves were trembling in him.
“You said you were waiting for us,” Sam said. “How did you know?”
“I will beg for you,” Dean rasped, tilting Cas’ head up, and it was his voice, but it wasn't his voice; they were his words, but not his words, words older than his tongue, words older than both of them, like a prayer, like a poem or a plea, snaring on the hills and falls of Dean's voice, like ink blossoming in water. Things that had been waiting millenia to be said. It hurt to have something so ancient in his throat. “I'll—fall on my knees for you and I'll lie—at your feet, I will give you my soul. I'll give you my hands and my body. I will throw myself before you, I will build you a house,” he whispered, and Cas’ breath came in short, quick motions, his fingers digging into Dean’s arms. “I’ll do anything – I’ll do anything for you.”
“They were out of shape and we had to do double the work just to compensate,” Dean snapped, glancing at Cas’ swollen left knee cap, the Ace bandage bulging under his pants leg. His eyes flicked to the rear-view mirror where Sam was staring back at him.
“You aren't coming?”
It was quickly becoming the most jilted and unrelaxing hunt Sam had ever experienced. Between David Parsons—who looked like he was on the edge of falling asleep near-constantly—and Dean and Cas, who looked absolutely frigid, and seemed to have forgotten how to speak to each other, he was feeling more and more like the only person with priorities.
“I’m serious. You go out there, you find yourself a house. Build one if you’ve got to, but don’t waste what you’ve got. You’ve got people you could lose if you keep in this. They could lose you. Quit while you’re ahead. Don’t be me. Be anything but me.”
September seventeenth glowed back at him in big white numbers.
“...if you wanted to, Cas,” he said, finally, turning a little to face him, “if—if you love me as much as you say you do...if you can believe—that I love you as much as I do—I know it's a lot, I know it's huge, I know—if you—”
With every movement he betrayed Cas.
He let his hands rest on Cas' shoulders for just a moment, big and splayed on the white fabric of his shirt, and Cas tilted his head, met his smile.
“What the hell, then?” Dean griped. He was getting tired of constantly wondering how the hell everything was connected.
by garden-wall and gallery,
Dean began to pace again, and Cas stared at him. The hunter's mouth had clamped shut like an iron trap as if he'd realized what he'd said.
“Evidence that they were unhappy?” Sam said, hunching his shoulders. He was at something of a loss; he had a feeling they all were. “Maybe—something indicating he was unfaithful, or she was unfaithful, or something? Or a hint of who the ghost might go after next? It's a long shot, but—”
“Well, Sam. ‘Just Sam’,” she teased. “You’re quite a hit.”
Cas turned back to the water, but the catfish was gone, its muddy blue swallowed up by the current.
On a whim he left the kitchen, and mounted the stairs, taking each one slow and one at a time. He remembered pausing on the landing when they'd stayed here on the long journey, stopping to kiss Dean, back when everything had still been tainted wrong, and their intimacy still off-kilter. All of that blissfully smeared away, now, in the wake of the wedding.
Dean rutted against him, gasping, and Cas could see that he was blind with it, eyes wide with arousal and need, and Cas crawled a little out from under him, bent forward to help him slip out of his clothes, was suddenly overtaken with the desire to see him, all of him, naked and necessary—together they breathed and stumblekissed and pulled themselves free, bare, then, and riotous, bodies seeking each other like magnets, like colliding universes.
“And no matter what,” Cas said, against his mouth, “no matter what happens tomorrow, with the book, with New Orleans...we always had this. And we had the road. And we had all the good things—all the good things before.”
, he thought,
Sam thanked him, nodding and following the caterpillar of traffic as it wound its way down the exit ramp. The green government signs up ahead at a small intersection showed an arrow pointing east, towards a place called Elsbrook.
scared!” he said, laughing, and Cas rolled his eyes.
Easy affection could disarm you, if you let it.
“Okay, we’ll see if they’ve got any places to stay, and if not we’ll just keep going?”
“Take me away?” she whispered.
” Nervous, almost, he pressed his hands palms down against his thighs for a moment, and swallowed, and lifted his head. “
,” Dean said, “
He just had to make sure they got there.
Olivia hummed.
Sam frowned when he saw Dean hustling up the hillside, lugging the canister of gas and looking ready to split his skin.
“Look at those pictures,” Sam said, trying awkwardly for conversation, staring at the back wall of the cantina. It was covered in photographs of what appeared to be a family. Many of them were of groups of people crammed together outside of squat Mexican houses, their black and white faces smiling shyly at the camera; in the background a river was just slightly visible. One, a larger picture, was of a woman sitting in an old chair, a fringed shawl hanging off of her, a long braid hanging over her shoulder like a fat silver fish.
“Good riddance,” Dean muttered, watching her burn; and he met Cas' eyes for just a moment over her flaming, but what—if anything—that matched gaze said, neither of them could tell.
The angel finally turned around, tangling their legs together, pushing them as close as they could get.
– Dean, okay, just, yeah, you were – you were a douche, total douche, okay, but, but—now, we are cool. I understand. I get it, and oh man, I’m like—so proud, okay? Way major proud. Me and my mom are so wicked proud – wow – wow, like, okay?”
“Well,” Sugar said, her hands resting flat on her heavy hips, “I take it you boys are off, then.”
Sam opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out.
“Fucking – overjoyed?” Sam exhaled, rubbing his nose. “Really freaking proud, and happy, and, yeah, just—like—” He shrugged his huge shoulders, palms up in disbelief. “You guys look great, I mean—
Cas rutted up against him, beastly motions of his hips, shoving him over, then, flipping them both, and grinding down on top of him, fingers clawing at Dean's chest.
“Let me,” Cas whispered, touching Dean’s open collar, parting it, fingers trailing down his chest, undoing the buttons, hands unfolding, fingers fanned as they pushed the cotton aside, mapped over his chest and up over his shoulders. Dean’s head rolled against the door, Cas’ lips at his neck, down to his collarbone.
As they were driving back in the dark towards the distant towering clutch of Ferris wheel lights, Sam asked, “So—I just have a few more questions.”
Sam looked at Dean.
Sam stood breathlessly by, watching, scrubbing sleep and fear from his eyes. He stumbled back and sat down hard on a levee rock nearby, and tried to catch his wind. His brother and Cas were a tangled crouching mass by the water, and he could see Dean's hands, veins standing out with how hard he was holding on to the fallen angel's body in the puddle forming under their dripping bodies.
“We're going to some cafe on the square to talk in about an hour,” he continued, sidestepped a man and woman standing under some leaning branches, kissing. Cas stared at them as they passed by. “Can I take the car?”
Crammed into her five-foot-four frame there was the temperament of a wildcat and an itch so deep down in her skin she thought she might jump out of it any minute. It was her twenty-fourth summer, and her twenty-fourth peach festival that crazy green May, and she was fidgety as a sinner in church. She was sick of peaches and she was sick of the same people she’d seen every day her whole life. She was tired of manning her father’s store and watching her sisters go off and get engaged over and over to the same fools. She was exhausted by the small town and the stifling air. It seemed horrendously unfair that the river was only a mile away, a crime that something so big and so free was right there out of her reach.
“Great.” Dean scrubbed at his face again, sighing. “But that still doesn't tell us where this thing
“Those little assholes are all over my car and they’re probably taking turns shitting on it and they won’t let me sleep and they’ve been following my every move since we stepped into this little slice of bumfuck nowhere! So
They collapsed a little on the tile, melting into each other, warm, now, apologies in the bending of their bodies.
Dean stopped, suddenly transported to the Impala, just outside of St. Cloud.
She smiled, fingers gently brushing against the soft blue petals in the display. “Passing through, then?” She left the flowers and shuffled, careful of her hips, into the pew beside him. “What can I do for you?”
“Yeah.”
Yann hustled up the front steps of the cabin – if you could even justify calling it that. It was no more than a shack nestled in the middle of nowhere, a few hundred feet from a small fishing lake. Pulling a key from his pocket, the teenager unlocked the door and hurried inside, leaving it open for the others to follow. Dean watched Cas hesitate at the bottom of the stairs, hand gripping the rickety handrail, shaking it to test it. The rotten wood squeaked back at him, the rusted holdings at the bottom well on their way to disintegration.
They seemed to come out of a history book or a film reel – they all wore jeans and soft cotton shirts or coveralls, adjusting their baseball caps on their dirt-streaked foreheads. Like they really had walked out of the pages of
“Don’t give up,” she said, her voice falling even lower still. “You were born storytellers, all three of you. You been tellin’ stories from the moment you came to be. This is the most important one yet, so don’t stop. Don’t let the fear get you. It’s hard to look something this old in the face, I know. It's hard to be alright with somethin' so ancient callin' your name. Y'all know that already. It’s somethin’ mighty big and scary, but you’re the best of us. Lean on each other. Fill up the empty spots for each other. You're the best of all of us. Know that.”
Took him in.
Castiel called it, sometimes.
“Is that your grandmother?” Cas said, and she finally let her eyes lift to him and then to the picture on the wall, the one he'd pointed to. The woman on the wall smiled on, eyes soft.
And we've been shown nothing but kindness and hospitality by these people.”
Cas frowned, chin pulling down. He watched a beetle dart over the surface of the shallows, leaving ripples in its wake. “You know angels, Dean. Does this sound like angels to you?”
“This whole thing's been a shot in the dark,” Sam replied. “It can't hurt to try, and it's the best chance we've got.”
He turned his face back to the television as Cas came around the partition again, left knee still bound in his bandage. Another night sleeping with Dean, they'd decided, and so he sat down on the bed next to him and lifted his leg up onto the comforter. It was no secret he preferred sleeping in Dean's bed—he claimed it was because Sam thrashed, and Dean didn't, but they both knew in the backs of their brains that wasn't quite the whole truth.
“Good enough for me,” Dean said, more of a grunt than anything else.
“Salt box,” Cas repeated, and the word itself seemed like the house; rectangular. But not the inside, he thought. No, the inside was not so sharp. The rooms were well-built, yes, and these were square as well, and sturdy, and straight, but they were not sharp.
her number. And so she hadn't.
“Maybe they're waking up again,” Cas said. He stood, leaned against the desk, head down, thinking. “Maybe this is—maybe this is the beginning of the backlash, you know?”
He closed his eyes against the glare of the drifting sun, against the world, afraid for that strange moment.
“It was kind of you to have us,” Cas said, his voice a little faint, as if it were mechanical. He looked nearly about as ready to shiver out of his skin as Dean did; gently and surreptitiously Dean touched his wrist, a cool brush of calming fingers.
Sam placed his order, and they watched the boy fumble with his pen and pad, tapping the pen against his teeth while he tried to puzzle out the abbreviations for things. After he'd figured out Castiel's order as well, he looked up at Dean, and his entire face froze.
Death snorted. “And you find that—stimulating.”
Sugar’s voice warbled, and Dean rubbed his thumb over the small of Cas’ back, lost in the gentle strum.
“Tomorrow,” Dean whispered.
He blinked, momentarily dazed. “—what?”
“I'll—I'll see you out there, then,” he said. He could scarcely believe what he was saying.
Slowly Dean began again, as well, softer now, pulling the towel around the small of Cas' back, pushing it in tender circles against his hipbones, drying the insides of his thighs, the rounds of his knees. Cas' eyelids were low, as if he were near-asleep again, drowsily settled on his own task, drying the river from Dean's body.
David nodded at them, and—for the first time even slightly convinced that he actually did have the capacity to do his job—the trio went inside to the cool, unlit Sohre house, the river breeze blowing humid through the open windows and sending the white curtains aflutter as they passed inside.
“So strange havin' y'all here after watchin' you so long. You know, it’s so exciting,” she whispered, in the wake of their staring silence. “It really is. You’ve all done so well. You’ve come so far and learned all the lessons.”
Dean swallowed and looked away, and when the man was done, he filed his credit card away into his pocket and went back outside.
. Policemen. Victims. Usually we've got a
It was all of them.
out of the cafe instead of flying, furious that Dean would hardly look at him, that he dismissed him, that he hadn't wanted a single thing to do with him since the debacle of their last attempt at intimacy.
"I wasn't..." Sam started, and then stopped, taking a moment to pause, coming to stand beside the fuming Castiel. "How about we just go to the library?"
Without much thought for their nervous guest, Dean and Cas undressed for bed, turning their backs to him, and when Sam came out of the shower there was a muted discussion as to who Cas was to share a bed with that night; eventually they settled on Dean, and crawled into their respective beds, too exhausted to even say a proper goodnight.
“Yes,” Cas said, a flutter in his throat, feeling something warm and galactic taking up residence in the small of his back. He swallowed, nodding, entranced by the wideness of Dean's eyes, the tremor in his voice. It had been a long time since he'd heard nerves in Dean Winchester's speech. But he didn't seem
Pain was sparking in the bites and the bruises and the scratches.
“This is what I'm talking about,” Dean said. He didn't look at Cas—he spoke to the advertisement under the gentle distant clatter of cutlery in the kitchen. “Something big and solid we can sink our teeth into, y'know? This is good.” He pulled at his mouth and his legs kept jittering under Cas' touch. “Maybe it'll finally tell us if this whole shebang is another Apocalypse or just some big cosmic prank.”
“Soon,” Cas vowed, to satisfy his silent pleas, their joy so close to spilling over, and Dean miraculously was soothed, and they curled into each other, holding fast, safe in the knowledge of what was to come.
They were safe.
It pierced him, a spear of something intense and bright.
“Don’t worry about that,” Dean said in a hush, and he pulled back to look at Cas’ face, squeezing their hands. He saw Cas’ worried expression and he kissed him gently, without hesitation, right in the middle of the dance floor. Cas gripped his arm and pressed up more firmly before letting Dean go, body relaxing again.
Cas’ face was the first thing to surface from the recess of his mind.
Dean managed a smile, and came to him, lowered himself onto the mattress, unsurprised when Cas rolled over, towards him. His arm was already arced out to accommodate his shoulders. His hand curled around the back of Dean’s neck, thumb rubbing circles.
The spine creaked, and the first yellowed page fell open under his hands.
A text from Sam pulled them out under the rusted portico into a mist that settled like spirit breath on the village, shrouding the hilltops. Bobby had called, asked them for a favor, a little distraction, if they could afford it. A case, a hunt, in a town called Hartman to the east.
“I don’t mind doing them,” Sam said, looking down at the mess of china plates and glasses and heavy steel forks. He glanced at his brother and shrugged. “I mean, it would probably help her out, right?”
Dean hadn't seen; he was busy looking through his wallet for the least-suspicious fake card he had, and Sam came back in, setting off the little bell at the front. He looked a little sad, but Cas said nothing as he slid back into the booth.
Dean remained still. Cas wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pressed his cheek into the hot skin on the back of Dean’s neck.
“I'm sick of not treating things like a normal hunt,” Dean muttered. “I mean sure, this is weird, but when do I get to shoot something?”
Olivia nodded, her lips tight. “Good,” she said, curt. “That's a good thing. World may be celebrating now, might be all daylight, but dark will come again. A sad thing but true.”
“Maybe there's something else? A cleansing or something? Push her out?”
It came up like the rushing of current or tide, the catfish, the hands of the thing a man had become, a gift to a light shining brighter than any in the sky. The bending of the star to pluck the catfish from the mud. Pages. Pages.
Cas sat down on the battered, ruined couch, looking around the mouldering room. He could smell lake water and snow in the wood, in the coarse fabric underneath him. He watched Dean make his way in a wide arc around the cabin, examining the walls and the ceiling as if looking for some evidence of violence done to something that could bleed.
“How's it feel?” Dean asked, swallowing, trying to smudge out the shape of Cas' body behind the partition from his mind. He gestured to Cas' leg and Cas shifted it, frowning.
His heart was hammering in his chest and he was so intent on the figure of Castiel walking straight into the current—
“If you married me,” Dean said, “I can't think of anything in the world that would feel more right.”
“Do I make you happy?” Castiel asked. “Does – does all this, what we’re doing, kissing, touching, dancing—does it make you happy?”
“I don’t know, kid. I don’t know what to make of it, but it’s big. It’s bigger than what it looks like on the surface – all these little things are clicking together to make one big something, and we happen to be in the business of big somethings.”
“I'm afraid—I won't
Helena shook her head and clucked her tongue again.
“Well, now.” Sugar smiled, a little sadly, to herself. “That's the thing of it.”
would be hard pressed to miss it, dust as you are.”
Dean pressed a shaking hand to his mouth but it couldn't keep back the sob that he let out that formed itself into the words, “
Night was closing fast, coming swift, and chasing the sun in her golden chariot. It would drop soon, like a fallen handkerchief from God’s fingers, and with it the hush, and the time of lovers again, stretching on and on and on.
It was bliss there, with Cas, stroking his hair.
“What the fuck was that about!?” Sam demanded, frantic. The sound of their heartbeats in the car was almost audible even over the roar of the road. Cas was twisted to look out the back window at the vanishing cantina, and Sam's eyes were fixed on Dean in the rear-view mirror.
The staircase was all angles, he knew, but they were easy angles that curved towards the top floors. It was a very broken-in house, Cas decided. A very comfortable house that seemed to be tucking itself up for the night, folding its legs in like a sleeping cat. There was a rattle of dishes from the kitchen and the rush of the tap and Dean stared up again, and Cas looked at the walls, at the gleaming glass and glossy paneling, enjoying the soft noise Sam was making.
? And hadn't they burned her to cinders just hours ago?
Dean peered intently into Sam’s eyes.
Mattie, as she was elbow-deep in dishwashing with Cas by her side, that morning, couldn't help herself. All the tension between her guests seemed to have floated away as the fog had floated in that morning; she didn't ask for the impetus, but she could guess.
Cas shifted, awkwardly, unsure of what to do with his hands. He settled for folding them between his legs. “I'm curious about the birds. And the flood. It was meant to have flooded here, wasn't it? But it never did.”
The drowsy afternoon settled in the room and Dean moved restlessly.
“You looked tense,” Cas said matter-of-factly, and Dean stiffened, but soon found himself relaxing.
“You have a good night, baby!” one of them called in her sticky sweet voice, and Dean laughed, head tipped back, falling into step beside Cas. Sam was already halfway across the street. There were more girls on the other side, and they glanced through their fake lashes, their cigarettes held between their manicured fingers.
“Excuse me,” Sam called again, a little perturbed by his abrupt departure.
It was nearing the end of August. And here they were.
“...my friends and I,” he answered, the words easing out of him, prompted by her sweetness, by her warmth to be honest, in some faint attempt to make sense of what he was hearing. It was the least he could do. There was something about the way she spoke of the things she told him. There was something so intimate about it that he didn’t dare ask her to explain further, and he had the sincere feeling she wouldn’t be able to. She’d look at him, the way Lily had looked at them in Greenacre, and insist it wasn’t her story to tell, he knew. “We’ve been encountering some strange things and we heard about the birds here and thought maybe someone could explain it all...”
“There’s a Mexican place,” Dean said and Sam rolled his eyes so hard they might have fallen out of his head.
“Let’s get you a Sprite or something, buddy,” he grunted, directing Yann to some long white-linen covered table.
Slowly and creakily she got to her feet, dusting off the front of her dress, and with the same awkward unison they'd been dancing in all night the three hunters got up as well, clearing their throats.
“I'm still not clear on what you want us to do,” he said. The edge was gone from his voice, and Yann seemed to sense it. He relaxed visibly against the counter.
Pacified for the moment, Sam pressed his forehead to the window, on the lookout for motels and some kind of food for his garbage disposal of an older brother. They were outside of Dubois now—the town fell away surprisingly quickly behind them—and the skyline had become obscured by the trees and hills, the car dipping into a valley, a cluster of highway accommodations coming into view.
“I can’t – you know what she said. We probably shouldn’t even be talkin'…” he said, but Cas fisted his fingers into his shirt and yanked him back down, kissing his words quiet.
“What’d you do that for!” one of the boys yelled, and the kid who had tossed the offending baseball shrugged in horror.
“I do know.”
He had the same round face and chocolate eyes as Rosa, and Dean could tell they were siblings. He felt the picture of the old woman on the wall boring holes into his neck with her eyes and wondered if they were her children, or grandchildren.
His eyelashes fluttered, catching on Dean’s shoulder. He could see his freckles in the undisturbed daylight. Gold and brown flecks down his arms.
“You didn't have to call me," she said, before he could speak again. Her voice was a little dreamy, a little far-away. "Really. I didn't have any expectations. I mean, I wanted you to, but I wasn't going to hold you to it."
Cas didn't say anything, and Sam took this as his cue to start in that direction, making sure to shorten his strides so that his companion could keep up easily.
So it was quite unexpected, as a new sunrise broke, when Dean walked into the crowded hallway in front of the borrowed bedroom he and Cas were sharing to see Olivia hobbling to the room at the top of the house, carrying a basket covered by a thick linen cloth in her bony arms. Baby slithered along the baseboard, ducking and twisting around furniture, guarding her mistress as usual.
The book fell from his hands, snagged on his leg. He shook violently and those wonderful hands reached out and touched his face, and he
“What made you change your mind?”
"Well Drum, what're they good for?"
They looked at each other and then at her, more focused on the slim young woman than the food she'd made, and she took a deep breath.
“Cas, come on.”
“It’s supposed to be really good or something. The tea.” Sam shrugged, flipping out his phone and checking the time and then replacing it in his pocket.
She sighed, scrubbing absently at a white china dish, gazing down into the dizzy suds.
Cas nodded, and Dean’s pulse thrummed against his skin, a steady thing.
Dig each other out from under the craze of the yellow light, like headlights.
“Like she freakin’ knew… how do they
“You guys were
"I think...I think you're right."
He slid into the far end of a red-plasticine booth, to let Cas have the most room to stretch his leg. There was a faraway look in the angel's eyes that was creeping into Sam's, as well. He'd have to remember to ask the waitress for the name of the nearest and cheapest motel; he didn't feel like digging out a map or guessing their way. Not tonight.
Castiel focused on peeling the wet shirt from Dean's arms, the skin damp and cool and smooth. His fingers ghosted over his collarbone, the rounds of his shoulders, his arms, till he had worked the shirt off of him and picked up the other Olivia had set out.
It looks like a lot of fun.”
“You don’t,” Cas stuttered, jilted, the words clumsy, “you don’t have to do anything—”
