Apparently Dean just skipped over the dating and the having sex for the first time and the cuddling and the testing the waters and went straight for the proposal.
Sam whips his head around at that, and the fact that it’s such a surprising thing for Dean to say tells him it was definitely the thing to do. Sam laughs and finally stops looking at him with a shake of his head. “Jerk.”
Julie looks at him like she can’t believe he’d even suggest that. “And tell him what? ‘Sorry, that was the Ghostbusters here to murder my band, you know, the ghosts I told you were holograms because I didn’t want you to think I was fucking nuts.”
“I thought I lost you for good this time,” he eventually murmurs. He lets their chests rise and fall together in syncopated breath, though neither of them strictly needs oxygen anymore. Just a habit, one that reminds Dean that Cas is really here. “One minute you were there and the next you were just gone.”
The joke’s out of his mouth before he has time to feel embarrassed by it. “I dunno, I think I could’ve if I asked nicely.”
“It sounds like she’s hiding,” Sam suggests. “I mean, if she knows about Caleb, maybe he knows about her.”
Dean shrugs. “I mean, it kind of fits? But they have bodies in their graves and they’re self-aware, that’s like, textbook not-a-revenant.”
“Nah, date went bust, but I figured I had nothing better to do so I stuck around. Glad I did, you guys were seriously awesome.”
Bobby, Luke, and Reggie introduced themselves in turn, and just like that Dean was hanging out with Sunset Curve. They were pretty cool, down-to-earth and easy to talk to. They hung out for a bit, and when Dean got back from getting another drink from the bar, some guy in a suit who apparently worked for another club was just leaving.
When Jack raises his hand in his half-wave, Sam steps forward ecstatically. “Jack, holy shit, you actually came!” Looks like Dean owes him 50 bucks.
He snorts, because he can’t help but agree. Incredibly, it could have been worse. They sit in silence for several moments before Sam slaps the table once and stands up.
“You’re beautiful,” he whispers in awe, taking in the true form of Castiel for the first time. He didn’t think it possible to love him any more than he already did, didn’t think himself capable of containing that much affection, but it fills the newest crevices as soon as they are created and he knows he made the right decision. He launches himself at Cas with an honest-to-god giggle he knows Sam would never let him live down if he heard it. He pulls Cas close and turns to face Jack again. “Thanks Jack.”
Julie looks at him sheepishly. “I told them not to mess with you but they didn’t listen, sorry about that.”
“We’re old family friends,” Dean picks up. “We’re helping your dad with some, heh, unfinished business.” He didn’t realize eyerolls were contagious but his pun garnered at least three. “I’m Dean, this is my brother Sam.”
After his near-miss, Dean decided it was time to retire. Sam and Eileen had already made the same call for themselves. They didn’t have plot armor from Chuck anymore, or Jack for that matter, and he wasn’t gonna get Cas back only to lose him again now. Charlie and Stevie came over one day to set them up with new identities so they could get real jobs—and so they didn’t get banned from every hospital for 100 miles. They wanted to use their actual names for once, though obviously ‘Winchester’ would be a little too truthful for a legal document seeing as they’re supposed to be dead. Because she’s basically their little sister, and as a thank you for everything she (and original Charlie) had done for them, Dean and Sam decided to go with Bradbury as their last name. Cas wanted to join in on that train, but ended up being dissuaded, because:
“Listen, if there’s anything I’ve learned being in the game this long, it’s that nothing’s really fair, y’know, ‘life sucks and then you die.’ I mean, sometimes you can do everything right and still end up trapped in Hell for eternity. Sometimes you solve one apocalypse only to start another. Or sometimes the love of your life is slorped into nothingness for crimes against heterosexuality.” She fixes him with increasingly alarmed expressions. “Okay, probably not universal experiences.
Sam looks at him with an unimpressed eyebrow. “Okay…” Sam seems to expect him to continue. “Was that in question?”
Trevor stops halfway between the foyer and a living space, though the open floor plan makes it tough to distinguish. “Exactly.”
“We can worry about that later. Right now, we need to figure out our gameplan for the Undead Kennedys over here. Thoughts?”
“Can confirm,” Dean interjects as Alex ducks his head in embarrassed joy. “He’s a lucky cold spot. Now, can we get back on track here?”
). Dean removed his lips from the stunned celestial being and took his face into both hands. He looked him sternly but devotedly in his annoyingly gorgeous eyes. “I love you too, you fucking jackass.”
“OKAY,” Dean bellows, getting the attention of the room. “Alex, stop pacing, we’re gonna figure this out, just—"
“Hi there.” Alex did a literal spit take when he looked up to see Dean placing the drink he was tasked with next to the others. The guys cracked up as Dean looked down at his now-damp clothing. “Well, looks like I’m all ready for the wet t-shirt contest.”
Dean can somehow feel the kid smiling into his shoulder, and it warms him in ways he can’t begin to describe. He’s not too keen on letting go, but there’s work to do, as evidenced by the overlapping cries behind them of “what the hell” and “who is that” and “oh so when
He risks one last parting glance at the love of his life. Even when he’s cutting him out for good, furious and bitterly cold, he’s still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester. “I think it’s time for me to move on.”
“Yeah, okay,” he grumbles, trying not very successfully to hide a smile. Weddings, it turns out, can get expensive very quickly. He automatically sprung for a new suit for Cas because the man practically lived in Jimmy’s for about a decade and it’s time for an upgrade, not that the former angel has strong opinions about fashion. But he doesn’t really see the point in spending money on two suits unless they can wear them more than once. “But nothing too fancy, alright?”
“I’m out, I can’t do… whatever this is.” Carrie storms out of the studio, Trevor hot on her heels. Everyone else looks around awkwardly.
“Yeah,” he drawls, opening the door wider so Sam and Dean can enter. Julie and another girl are seated at the piano whispering to each other, and next to them are the ghost band, absently jamming to keep themselves on this plane. Ray sits down on the couch next to a boy Dean assumes is Julie’s brother and ruffles his hair. “I hope you know this one is never gonna let me hear the end of this.”
“Yes sir, but uh, our tragic backstory isn’t part of the package. We’re just here to make sure the guys really are as harmless as they seem.”
His brother must sense his conviction because he shakes his head in acquiescence and looks out the passenger window for a few minutes. A thought occurs to him eventually and he looks over cautiously but inquisitively. “Did you know them? Like, personally?”
“Goodbye, Dean.” And as Billie breaks down the door, Cas pushes Dean aside and awaits his fate with a smile on his face. The last thing he thinks before he is completely enveloped by the Empty is that he finally understands an idiom he never quite grasped.
Dean steps back from the flames engulfing the bones of Alex Mercer and pulls out his phone. “Hey,” he says when Julie picks up. “We just torched the body, did he go up in smoke or is he still Pacman food?”
Cas smiles at him with the same subdued yet fond grin Dean’s come to appreciate, and it turns his stomach against the fries he’s currently shoving into it. That line of thinking is dangerous; he tried the apple pie life with Lisa and Ben and look how that turned out. Everyone who gets close to him ends up dead or worse, and with the Mark of Cain seared into him, tragedy is practically inevitable if he opens that door. Even if he and Cas could have been something more—not that he wanted that necessarily but even if it were possible—they would still be here, staring down the near-certainty that someday Dean will lose control completely, and Cas and Sam will have to pick up the pieces, assuming they’re not dead already themselves. This is hard enough as it is; Cas doesn’t need the pain of knowing the full extent of how much this sucks.
“I’m sorry,” Flynn adds. “I’m still stuck on ‘mome raths’. Seriously? That’s what we’re going with?”
Dean forces himself to tamp down the knee-jerk reaction to distrust Jack and remembers his son’s innocent smile of wonder. “Yeah maybe, but he’s also a toddler who’s been God for about five minutes. I’m just saying, nothing in my experience gives me confidence that this can end any way except painfully.”
“That’s actually what we wanted to talk to you about,” Sam says in an attempt to steer the conversation back on track. “See we’ve got some ghosts here who spent some time in the Empty and we’re trying to figure out why. Could you help us out?”
“I know,” Sam sniffles, the tears he’d been dutifully holding in finally falling. He clears his throat to cover it up. “So this is goodbye, then?”
“You know what, angel,” Dean purrs, slowly walking towards him, “You’re absolutely right, I’m sorry, I should have asked first.” He ignores Sam’s muttered “you’re kidding me” and gets down on one creaky knee before the love of his life. “Castiel, will you marry me?”
Alex snorted and rolled his eyes. Dean decided to close the gap between them in the booth, a development Alex seemed more than pleased with. “Can you imagine how insufferable they’ll be if it works?”
Clapping comes from the doorway, where Julie and Flynn are standing as if they’ve been there a bit. Ray and Sam join in the applause as he waves awkwardly. “I didn’t know you played,” Julie beams.
As the door closes, Dean turns back to face the angel, who has not moved any closer in the interim. “You wanted to see me?”
to be better. My entire life I’ve had to be this tough-as-nails, ready-for-anything soldier, playing out whatever twisted plan my dad or Chuck or Michael orchestrated for us. I didn’t even know who I was outside of what’s been expected of me. And now, for the first time in my life, I can breathe, I can learn and unlearn who I am and what I want and explore all the parts of myself I was too scared or too busy surviving to think about. You did that. You made all of this possible.
need you.” And that ‘I’—all the things it leaves unsaid but that resound as clear as day (I believe in you, I care about you, I want you in my life, I love you)—that ‘I’ makes all the difference.
Dean forces himself to close off the many routes of expression he’s left wide open in this discussion; he forgot Cas was on a clock. Damn it. “Right, you’re big man on campus again, gotta get Heaven back in line and all that.”
Dean can’t tell which of the eight people startled by the new presence in the room screams the loudest. He’s pretty sure it isn’t him given how often angels do this to him, and also the fact that he’s too shocked to believe he’s even seeing this.
“Well,” Dean counters hesitantly, “maybe not nothing.” Cas looks at him in confusion. “There’s one thing we could do.”
He’s pretty sure he already knows his answer but it helps not to be too eager. “Well, what’s Cas wearing?”
“Yeah. That’s why the Empty took him. They had some kind of deal that if he was ever truly happy, it would come for him, and apparently his bliss was telling me he’s in love with me.”
Dean focuses his attention solely on the road in front of him, jaw clenching to prevent himself from saying anything further. Sam watches him in shock for a couple seconds before facing forward as well. The silence is a living thing, a third passenger leaning in between them from the back seat, begging them to continue. The more miles they speed down, the more the silence demands an answer. Dean wants it to end there, but he knows Sam’s just waiting for him to elaborate, granting him the space to follow up on that admission even as he has to audibly calm his breathing. He’s not getting out of this one.
Dean will eventually tell Castiel that he should have stopped him, that he forgives him, that he’s sorry. Cas knows he’s more comfortable saying these types of things when there’s no guarantee Cas can hear him, and it’s enough for him to say it like that; he doesn’t make him say it face-to-face. There’s no time and there’s no need. What matters is that Dean is alive, safe in Castiel’s arms again—the rest they can figure out as they go.
Julie’s eyes widen in judgement before moving on. “Anyway… I think Flynn’s right, but the only other ghosts we know of are under Caleb’s control. Willie’s probably our best bet but we have no idea what kind of hold Caleb has on him.”
“Fiiiine.” Julie settles in at the piano and begins playing, joined soon after by her band. With everyone assembled and able to communicate easily, they get to work. They manage to get a decent drawing of the ‘stamp’ Caleb put on them for Sam to research later. The guys are alarmed to hear about Caleb a) possessing someone and b) disappearing in a cloud of purple demon smoke.
Dean presses into his eye sockets with his fingers. “Yes, haunting the guy you blame for stealing your glory counts.”
“That’s not what I’m saying. Obviously you guys need to iron out how he should make up for what he did, if he even can. But you were friends once, and I think underneath all that pain, what you really want is to be reunited with your friend.”
When he tells Sam and Jack what happened to Cas, Sam takes it at face value albeit suspiciously, but Jack looks at him with confusion and then heartbreaking clarity. The kid knew about this. Not just that, he knew the conditions of that deal, and put two and two together. But there’s no time for that, and anyway it’s none of their damn business; what Cas gave, what he spoke into existence, was for Dean’s ears only.
“Where they’re tortured for eternity with their deepest regrets.” He brushes off Sam’s look of sympathy.
“I’m sorry.” Cas releases him trying to create distance between them but Dean’s not letting him go that easily. He just pulls Cas back into him and rests his head on his shoulder. He’s not good with words, but actions he can do. Cas settles back into the embrace, cautiously placing his hand on the back of Dean’s head.
The goal for today is to grill the boys again about anything useful, then send Alex off to find Willie, who seems to be a better source for ghostly information, or at the very least Caleb-related information. The boys also said something about marks Sam wants to get more clarification on. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean will be once again looking into the Empty, although most of their stuff on that is back in the bunker. Which Dean knows because he’s been not-so-secretly looking into a way there ever since the final showdown.
He’s rescued from it becoming a whole thing by the arrival of Maurizio. “Oh wow, it fits you even better than I expected. Let me just check a few things.” He moves Dean around a bit, testing the fit and making notes of alterations. “Well I’ll be damned, it would need a few adjustments, but honestly I think it’s met its match. What do you think?”
“Cas, they won’t let me marry you if people think you’re my brother.” Charlie stops typing and looks up at him with the same look of incredulity that everyone else in the room is fixing on him as well. A shocked chortle comes from Sam’s direction. Dean’s entire body starts burning and the bottom drops out of his stomach as he closes his eyes in mortification. There’s no way in hell Sam will ever let him live this down. He simply meant that if maybe someday in the future they ever wanted to, they should, y’know, leave their options open, but, well—
All he knows for certain is that this swirling vortex of turmoil in his abdomen isn’t supposed to be there. There is something intoxicating about Dean Winchester, an unbearably fascinating pull that makes Castiel wonder how something so beautiful could be so misused. Strictly speaking his primary responsibility for Dean ended shortly after the man’s return to Earth, but Castiel found it increasingly difficult to resist learning more about this human so important to the divine plan that he was to be rescued from Hell by an angel of the Lord.
have what you want, you can have me—hell you already have me, have for much longer than I'm comfortable admitting. I couldn’t let you pour your entire heart out and sacrifice yourself to save me, then just go on with my life as if nothing happened. I love you too, dumbass. My happy ending is here, with you.”
Sam stills, and Dean’s amused to note that he’s trying very hard to look like Dean’s revelation isn’t shocking to him when he very clearly wasn’t expecting it. “Oh.” He shapes his lips into several words that don’t end up being voiced before finally deciding on: “wow, okay, this is finally happening.”
Julie takes a deep breath and lets it out when he pulls her into a hug. “Thanks.” They stand there long enough that Dean feels awkward watching it so he goes over to the couch the ghosts have just vacated and takes a seat. “So,” Julie calls as she heads over to the piano, the boys donning their instruments in preparation. “What’re we playing for him?”
“All right then!” Dean extracts his angel blade with a flourish. “Now this is gonna hurt, but after this the only thing that can kill you is the scythe.”
Dean can’t help the snort that comes out. He meets Rose’s death-glare with an apologetic smile. “She’s got you there, Rose. And it’d be a lot easier for Sam and me to keep an eye on her if she’s with us than if she’s off on her own. There’s also no guarantee he won’t go looking for her while we’re looking for him.”
“Yeah,” Sam says, clearing his throat. “We were hoping you could answer some questions about the Empty.”
He smiles at the hope shining in Cas’s eyes and he knows in his heart this is the face he wants to see for the rest of time. “You heard me. If you still want me, I’m right here.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “I promise, oh captain my captain. But umm…” He can do this—like his brother said, just get it out and they never have to mention it again. “I’m pretty sure he’s it for me.”
This girl in his English class had asked him out to a concert featuring four former students at their school (dropouts, not graduates, which was a plan Dean was starting to get behind). Never one to turn down a pretty girl, he drove her out to the venue and made it about forty-five minutes into the date before she got dragged out of the place by her father. Not to be discouraged, he decided to make a night of it since he was there; after all, there was a pool table in the corner, a bar that served minors, and plenty more beautiful people for Dean to ogle. The band he was theoretically there to see was actually pretty good considering. The guys were talented and had stage presence, and the songs were catchy. (And now that he’s thinking about it all these years later, he’s fairly sure he’s heard some of those songs on the radio since then under a different name.)
Charlie squeals, and he can hear the sound of her hands flailing excitedly against Stevie’s arm. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see his brother frantically grabbing his phone while Eileen stands next to him with a hand over her mouth. But that’s not what he’s focused on; he’s more interested in the way Cas’s adam’s apple bobs in anticipation, the way he watches Dean take his left hand into both of his, eyebrows at maximum height.
About a year after Sam left for Stanford, Dean drove out to Palo Alto just to check up on him for a bit. He didn’t dare alert him to his presence; he just needed to know his baby brother was alive and well. Having done that, he found himself driving south into Los Angeles for a case Bobby asked him to tackle as a personal favor, something about a cursed prop on a movie set. His contact couldn’t meet until the morning though, so he had an evening to kill.
, deserved more than to leave himself completely vulnerable before the man he was evidently so in love with just admitting it out loud was enough to make him happy, and then die. Not just die, but die specifically to save Dean. What do you even say to that?
Oh. He thinks Dean is just an illusion. That complicates things. “Cas,” he starts slowly, “I don’t know how to prove it, but it’s really me, okay?”
After the congratulations and the jokes at their expense, after the food and the speeches, after the cake and the dancing, after sneaking off early to “consummate the union” in the room they now share, Dean marvels at the man currently tangled in his arms and his bedsheets. If someone had told him 20 years ago—hell, 6 months ago—that this is where he’d find his happy ending, he likely would have beat them to a pulp on principle, much less believed them. But despite everything, despite the best efforts of every supernatural entity they’ve ever faced, Dean Winchester is finally allowed to be happy. He presses a kiss to his husband’s temple. “And you were content with just saying it,” he murmurs.
“Actually we don’t,” the lead singer rebutted. “Alex has been pretty tight-lipped about the whole thing.”
Trevor quizzically directs his attention to him. “What do you mean ‘usually’? You’ve seen ghosts before?”
It’s not every day a hunter gets roped into what’s essentially a class-action salt-and-burn. Willie is able to procure Caleb’s records of just how many souls were under his thumb; the contracts with the living are summarily cancelled and the rest are summoned to the ballroom. Sam is in the other room calling their international contacts because apparently Caleb had a whole
“Don’t what, huh? Don’t tell you you’re being a complete and total idiot? Well I’ve got news for you, pal, I’ve been into you for so long it’s frankly embarrassing.”
Dean politely turns to give them a moment of privacy, pulling Sam aside to figure out how to play this. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”
Julie takes in the scene with concern, then turns to go back into the garage. “Maybe you two should come inside.” Dean and Sam share a look then decide they might as well. The garage is actually more of a studio, a grand piano front and center with tons of musical instruments and memorabilia strewn about. Julie closes the door and gestures at a well-worn couch. “Please, sit.”
Dean can see the sheer terror in her face while she comes up with a convincing lie. “Uhhh yeah, sorry, I was trying out a new sample, the lead was much louder than I anticipated.” She glances in Dean’s direction but not obviously enough to alert her dad to their presence, more like trying to keep an eye on them. This girl must have no self-preservation instinct if she’s trying to harbor the shady middle-aged guys with guns instead of signalling to her dad they’re here. He really hopes that’s the case instead of what Dean fears is the real answer: she’s protecting them because she’s protecting the ghosts. “I think I got it fixed though so it shouldn’t do that again,” she adds, the last words said with subtle emphasis in a clear signal to Dean to get with the program and maybe not fire a weapon in broad daylight in suburbia.
“Me either.” Except for the whole he’s-gonna-die-soon part. “We’re umm… once things settle down, we’re gonna give it the ol’ college try. Until then, I’m just biding my time.”
(When Sam gets to Heaven, much later, he informs Dean that “Mystery Boy” became a minor hit and strangers in the 2060s are still singing about him. He’d had enough of fame with Chuck’s accursed novels, but being immortalized in song by people he knew feels slightly more palatable. Sam’s running joke every time it would play, “sounds like Cas and Dean are boinking again,” is less well-received, but, hey, he probably wasn’t wrong.)
“Yep, and that’s usually the reaction I get, so I’m gonna take that as my cue to leave, could you do me a huge favor and not murder me, please?”
Cas breathes in sharply and pulls back to search Dean’s face for confirmation that he heard him correctly. “What?”
“When I died I ended up in… I guess we’re calling it the Empty? Then suddenly I fell to Earth and landed in the house while everyone was out. I don’t know what exactly brought me here but it was also the day you got kicked out of the music program so I figure it has something to do with that. As I was getting used to my powers I was able to follow Ray to one of his shoots, which was right by the Hollywood Ghost Club. I remembered Caleb and realized I needed to keep a low profile or he’d try to rope me in.
“Oh it’s happening,” his escort replied. “Scoot over.” Alex did so in a daze to let the boy sit, but so did the others. “You too, Mystery Boy, have a seat.”
“I know.” Trevor gets up and begins to pace. “It’s one of my deepest regrets. I listened to the wrong people and by the time I came to my senses it was too late to come clean.”
, worked out in our favor? Okay, even if by some Jacktastic miracle the guys can happily live out the rest of their unearthly days some sort of spirits we know nothing about, they’re marked simply by virtue of being associated with us. Sooner or later, the other shoe always drops, you know this.”
Sam steps forward decisively. “Yeah, so it seems like what we suspected, these aren’t your average ghosts, they’re being held in some suspended state of consciousness, which means we need to figure out where Caleb’s getting the power to do all this.”
Julie looks towards nothing again. “Yeah, they’re slightly concerned about that, but we’re more excited about the fact that we can touch sometimes now.”
“Well I’m not.” Dean leans back far enough that he can look Cas in the eyes. “You really thought you were the only one feeling this? Do you have any fucking idea what it does to me every time you leave? Every time
“Thanks boys. Let’s get to work. Julie, Winchesters, we’ll catch up with you in a bit back at the studio.” And with that, the reapers have disappeared with their new boss.
Reggie follows up on that train of thought. “Maybe she got sucked into the past and can only communicate through inanimate objects!”
“Hunters? Like ghost hunters?” Dean nods in acknowledgement. “W-what makes you think they’re ghosts?” Before he can point out that
and all thought ceases. His world is reduced to the press of lips on lips and he passes all the love and longing and elation he can through them into Cas’s waiting mouth. He kisses him until his lungs plead for air, but even then he presses their foreheads together. “If you still want me, you got me. For as long as we both shall live and all that jazz.”
“You tell that hypocritical self-sacrificing shithead,” he says loud enough to be heard from Heaven directly, “that if he doesn’t get his incredibly fine feathered ass down
Dean downs the rest of his beer and goes for another one, Sam calling after him. He was expecting this to be a production, but ironically he could have just skipped to the important part instead of explaining that him liking a guy isn’t out of nowhere. At least Sam doesn’t seem to care; he’s more freaking out because he thought they already
Julie rings in at the gate, which opens ostentatiously for them. At the door, they’re greeted by none other than Trevor Wilson, looking grayer than Dean remembers from his last show, and certainly much older than the last time they met in person. He pulls Julie into a hug and shakes Ray’s hand. “Sorry it’s been so long,” he starts, eyeing the brothers nervously. “And thank you for coming; I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how to approach you about this and I’ve been putting it off ever since the concert. Which you rocked, by the way.”
They decide to reconvene in the morning. Dean and Sam politely turn down Ray’s offer to let them sleep in the studio, pointing out to Ray’s dismay that it’s otherwise occupied. When the Winchesters leave for their motel, the rest of them are passionately discussing personal boundaries.
Alex sucked in a breath, eyes glued to Dean and mind clearly going miles a minute. “I’m pretty sure you’re exactly the type of guy parents warn their kids about.”
“Relax, dude,” he assures him with a roll of his eyes. “It was a joke.” By the way he sighs, he can tell Sam’s ramping up to an After School Moment, which is something Dean has absolutely zero interest in right now. Or ever, preferably.
Dean’s about to protest, but Sam takes the lead. “That’s totally fine, thank you so much for your cooperation.” He hands her his card. “If you remember anything else, or if… something weird or unexplained happens with them, just give us a call.”
He looks up at Sam to signal something’s wrong then puts the kid in a full nelson. “Hey, what the hell!”
“The fabled Winchesters!” Caleb slowly descends the staircase when they all know damn well he could just poof to them. “I’d be flattered if I didn’t have such a bone to pick with you. Now that Heaven and Hell are both under new management, you’ve really thrown a wrench into my little operation here.”
“Hey,” Dean adds, “whatever it is, we’re all ears, okay? Even if it doesn’t make sense, or it’s unbelievable, we’ve seen weirder, we promise.”
“We were just discussing Julie’s band,” Trevor explains somewhat tensely, understandably considering how Carrie stiffens at the answer.
Sam reaches his hand out to the boy. “Can I see that please?” Carlos hands it over wordlessly and goes to help Julie look.
So Dean does what he always does. He takes those feelings and thoughts and passing fantasies and shoves them so deep into the recesses of his brain that he can forget they were ever there. He protects those he cares about from the biggest threat to their existence: himself.
He and Sam finish up at the graveyard and get back in the Impala. “I hate to say it, Dean,” Sam starts.
Ray understandably doesn’t seem convinced, but he takes one last sweep of the place with his eyes and pulls his daughter close. “Don’t scare me like that, I thought something happened to you.”
When Julie’s dad has closed the door, all three living humans peer out from their spots to see if he’s back in the house yet. When the coast is clear, Sam and Dean come out of their spot, placing their weapons on the ground and their hands in the air as they approach. “Why didn’t you tell him about us?”
he was grossly misinformed on that front. He never realized how much energy he devoted to convincing himself he was imagining things until he didn’t have to do it anymore. He wants to be bitter that he only learned this when it was too late to do anything about it, but surprisingly the knowledge has instead filled him with an unprecedented level of peace. It’s finally sinking in that he had what he wanted all along, that he had a life with the being he loved for a lot longer than he ever thought was in the cards for him. Sure, he couldn’t articulate it in so many words and they certainly had their fair share of rough patches (understatement), but when he told his dad he did indeed have a family of his own during that strange wish upon a pearl, on some level he knew his brother, his son, and his knight in feathery armor were his happy ending. If only they could have all made it to the end.
“Willie, listen to me,” Alex begs. “This isn’t you, okay? Don’t listen to him. We’ll find another way.”
She departs soon after that, and Sam comes up alongside him. “Sucks she’s Death,” Dean muses. “She seems pretty cool.”
“Yeah, it was wild,” Jimmy finished, not picking up on how hollow Dean’s voice had gotten. “Man, I haven’t thought about that in years. They used to play here, you know.”
He finally looks up into his friend’s panicked eyes. Julien is just as confused and nervous as him. “Should we try again?”
“True, but they’re reapers now, which is apparently a big deal. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them. I just… I hoped we had more time together.”
It only takes Julie an hour to slink out of the house and go running into the large detached garage. Dean and Sam get out of the car, Sam with his EMF reader and iron poker, Dean with his rock salt shotgun. They approach the garage door carefully and quietly peer in the windows. Julie is frantically shout-whispering at nothing, though they can’t quite make out what she’s saying. It’s clear she’s talking to someone though, even if the room looks completely empty. The conversation settles, but suddenly she cuts herself off and looks out the window in fear. Fuck. How did she know they were there?
The smile fell from Dean’s mouth almost immediately though he tried to keep it there. Dad had just informed them that morning that he expected the case to be wrapped up by the end of the next week. “Oh, that’s…that’s awesome, I’m sure you guys are gonna rock it.” It struck him then just how foolish this whole thing was. There was a reason Dean always hit it and quit it; his life didn’t really allow for him to get attached. Like he was doing right then. On the other hand, whatever he was doing with Alex would likely be his only opportunity for a while to hook up with a guy, so if that was something he was even remotely interested in, he’d better figure it out quick.
demons and even an angel. (Naomi’s attendance was a shock to both of them, considering she wasn’t technically invited, but Cas seems guardedly happy about having even one person from his old family at least pretend to care about his happiness, so she can stay, for now.)
Carrie looks over at her father sadly, as if her worst fears were coming true. “Coming clean about what?”
“I’ll take it,” Dean decides without hesitation. “If you can get me there, I’ll figure out the rest.”
“And this has nothing to do with you angling for a friendly face behind the scythe in addition to having Heaven and Hell wrapped around your fingers.”
“Look, maybe you’re right; hell it’s the best explanation we’ve got so far. But that would mean everything we know about ghosts is useless, and it still doesn’t explain what the fuck these three were doing in the Empty.”
“Fuck if I know,” Dean chuckles. “I’m not saying we get out of the life completely, as if that were even an option for us. I’m just saying… maybe we leave first string for the young blood.”
of ghost cities that will now need to be processed. Without Caleb’s protection, the ghosts are quickly losing their grip on reality, so the reapers give them a choice: either provide Dean their information so he and Sam can track down their remains and send them on their way, or renew the lucidity spell with the caveat that this isn’t a permanent fix—well, yet, at least. Sam’s already been making frantic notes about ways to extend it indefinitely and “revolutionize ghost quality of life”. Dean had expected most would choose the spell, but Caleb must have done a number on them because many choose to move on. Caleb kept a collection of trinkets that are likely to be their anchors, but he’s still got his work cut out for him. So much for retirement.
“Ha,” Dean guffaws, “yeah, well usually that takes the form of murderous revenge. Get any urges like that?”
They let the album play while Sam looks up Caleb’s stamp and Dean reads up on demon smoke. Demons have been known to have all sorts of eye colors, but besides Crowley, he’s never heard of a demon being anything other than black. The former King of Hell explained it once, back when Dean was himself a demon, but he was predictably vague about it, only giving enough information to pique the former hunter’s curiosity.
“For now.” If the Empty wasn’t silent before, it is now as the surprise of his new plan sinks in. “Jack, when Duma was controlling you, she had you make new angels, right? Out of regular ordinary humans?” Jack glows literally and figuratively as his smile takes over his face and his aura brightens.
“A huge fan,” he says, jumping up in youthful excitement. “I’m Carlos, I’ve been following a lot of ghost hunting blogs. Your videos with the Ghostfacers are legendary!”
“Sorry,” Jack responds, but less apologetically than he would have before. It’s then Dean remembers he’s talking to a deity, because the power sits well in the set of Jack’s shoulders and while he still openly craves Dean’s approval, he’s no longer setting his entire stock in it. Good for him. “We were dealing with other issues, and it wouldn’t have mattered much whether you knew or not.”
Julie shakes her head at the brothers’ antics and looks over to where her mother is corralling souls. “I’m glad I got to see her again.” Rose notices the gaze of her daughter and appears before them.
Sam looks back down at his notes. “Okay, Julie’s an unreasonably powerful medium who can manifest spirits and keep them from going feral.”
Rose shakes her head and pulls Julie into her tightly. “I guess that’s what I get for raising my girl to be headstrong and independent. Fine, you can come—”
“That’s it!” He came over to talk to them, and Dean felt something lurch in his chest. “Yeah, total freak accident, three of them bit it about half an hour before the show, poor guitar guy had to go on and do a whole set by himself before he even knew what had happened to them.”
Ray looks like he’s about to tell them to go fuck themselves until they have a warrant, and honestly Dean can’t blame him. He and Sam may have to dress like cops to do the work, and they may even have friends on the force, but he wouldn’t trust them either, even if he and Sam weren’t being shifty. Dean decides to change tactics, putting his badge away. “Actually, uhh, it’s about a mutual friend. Alex Mercer? We think Julie might be the last person to see him before he… disappeared.”
And that’s the real reason Dean didn’t want something splashy, isn’t it? He’s still hung up on whatever bullshit form of masculinity their dad foisted on him that he’s been fighting to maintain his whole life. Suddenly he feels every year of his age, and once again the reminder of how much
“Thanks for talking to us, Julie.” Dean leans against one of the pillars while Julie crosses her arms in front of her chest. “It means a lot to us.”
“Yes, because in completing their unfinished business, they’ve ensured Julie will succeed, and now that my family is in a position to move on without me, my business is complete too.”
Dean tips an imaginary hat. “All in a day’s work.” He leans back on a pile of stuff. “So, anything in particular you were itching to talk to me about, or just couldn’t resist this face?”
Rose pulls her daughter into another hug and kisses her hair. “Because for our plan to work, one or more of us is likely going to have to become a reaper.”
Ray looks around, breathing heavily but cautiously relieved. “Everything’s okay? I thought I heard a gunshot.”
“No,” Angela replied as Jimmy was called off to another customer. “Sorry, hon, did you know them?” He nods and takes a long sip. “Oh dear, sorry to break it to you this way.”
Dean sighs in frustration. “Man, I dunno, I guess that would explain why he’s got properties of both but when have you ever heard of that happening? Ghosts aren’t usually all there, I don’t really see one having its shit together long enough to do something like that.”
“He’ll be there, Dean,” Sam assures him as they get out of the car. “He’s not gonna miss two of his dads getting hitched, we raised him better than that.” The inside of the tailor’s shop is cozy, with sharply dressed mannequins and a giant circular platform to the side around which are a couple couches. The store is empty except for its proprietor, who looks up at the sound of the door opening.
He looked back over at their nosy audience and came up with a very shitty plan. “Do you one better. Whatdya say we give ‘em something to talk about?”
Damn it. Dean had finally gone an entire ten minutes without thinking about a certain angel only to be put in a position where he has to decide, right now, whether he’s actually gonna own up to his feelings or let him down yet again. Mercifully, his mouth agrees it’s a no-brainer. “Yeah… I did. But umm, I kinda have the same problem with him actually. One or the other of us is usually dead. It’s his turn right now.”
, in the way everyone always told Dean he did but that he never quite believed because he just assumed they were taunting them—well, and because he assumed angels didn’t experience that kind of love but
Julie leads Dean up to the loft area of the studio to give him and Alex a touch more privacy, though that’s kinda hard given the studio isn’t exactly a mansion. She leaves him up there alone with a notepad, a pen, and a suspiciously empty space across from him that isn’t cold or electromagnetic or anything. Which actually scares him more.
Victor is a big promoter of fostering healthy team dynamics, and as such insists on spending their first night as a team all together. Cas would usually agree (reluctantly), but tonight it’s especially difficult. As they all take their places at the table under the soft yellow lamplight, Cas can’t decide what’s the worse option; sitting beside Dean and rubbing elbows with him, is sitting opposite and having to watch him all evening.
There’s a hand on his face and Castiel feels his head being lifted, his eyes directed squarely at Dean’s. “You can have it,” he says, quiet, just into the space between them.
“Hey, man, mi closet es su closet,” Dean says with a grin, gesturing across the wall of flannel hanging neatly in his wardrobe.
Dean sucks in a breath. “Strong words,” he says with raised eyebrows. “I don’t know, maybe I’m sentimental,” he picks up one shirt with a large tear in it’s sleeve. “Wore this one on a few good hunts, was kind of a lucky shirt I guess. Can’t wear it now, but- I don’t know, doesn’t feel right to bin it.”
Much to Dean’s chagrin, they actually end up doing a fair bit of walking since Castiel cannot safely take off too close to the city walls in case he’s spotted. They walk through the shadowy wood, hands loosely entangled and swinging gently between them. Finally, Castiel comes to a stop in a small clearing.
“Perhaps that was a mistake, perhaps I should have killed you,” Castiel threatens, wondering aloud if his mercy had been misjudged— this man may not be a threat, but he is certainly a nuisance.
Castiel’s hands explore Dean’s skin as they’re lips are locked, pausing as he passes a thumb over the rough skin on his lower left torso. He pulls back to look at what he’s feeling.
“You’re the one who said I should stay home, and we need supplies, and the stores are all closed tomorrow,” Sam says, short and frustrated. “So I don’t care if you’re hungover. Get up!”
Castiel stares back blankly. Dean sighs, frustrated. He places his hands at either side of Castiel’s face and looks him dead on, giving Castiel something to square his focus on. “Cas,
“Why are you doing laundry at this time?” Castiel asks, groggy and not yet fully taking account of the picture in front of him. Dean’s mouth is frozen, half-open, words falling out of his head. Cas sees Dean’s hands tangled up in khaki. “Dean,” Cas repeats. “Are you alright?”
Dean was right that it’s nothing like that first kiss. This time it’s softer, there’s more give as Dean leaves room for Castiel to push in, to set the pressure. Castiel grabs onto Dean’s waist to steady himself as he leans into it further. The kiss is gentle, but there’s a buzz between them like both of them are hungry for more than this. Castiel thinks that if Dean went in for it, he’d let him. Then, in his love-drunk (and regular-drunk) haze, he decides that, well, nothing’s stopping
Cas nods and the two excuse themselves. With their neighbour already having agreed to keep Jack for the night, they decide to spend the night in the bunker, rather than bother driving home in the dark. Besides, Dean’s old room is nostalgic for them as it’s the first one they ever shared.
“Of course,” Cas says, addressing Jo cooly. “There’s nothing we can do about their strength or speed, but I can ward you. That way they won’t be able to see you coming unless they actually
The two give each other space, tending to understand that each of them are essentially strangers who come from vastly different backgrounds and assume the other to grieve in different ways. In truth, they largely grieve in exactly the same way. Namely, sitting alone stewing in their own misery until sleep relieves them of their thoughts for a brief, but blissful interlude. Except Castiel isn’t afforded that luxury for the most part.
“Yeah,” Sam says, sighing and taking a small sip of his still hot coffee. “I just hate you having to look after me like I’m a kid again.”
The door to the old church has been on its last legs for months, half hanging off its hinges, the bottom corner of the heavy hardwood scraping the arc of its path into the flagstone floor.
“I don’t need you to do that, Dean.” Cas said, slipping his fingers in between Dean’s as they sat side by side. “You already do enough for me.”
Castiel leads them onward through the dense thicket. The rain is still relatively light, but heavy enough to sink into the fabric of their clothing, leaving it cold and heavy against the skin. They keep pace with Castiel if only to muster enough warmth to compensate.
“Mm,” he hums. “It’s Fruity. I like it very much, that’s very thoughtful of you, Dean. Thank you.” He leans a hand over under the table to gently rest on Dean’s thigh. It’s a weak move, Dean has mastery over the thigh grab at this point, it does not affect him. Well, it doesn’t make him feel embarrassed at least.
“Bobby,” Dean says, voice steady to sate the man. “This is Castiel. He’s the one who healed Sam. And he just saved both our asses.”
Castiel’s face tightens and his eyes widen as he takes a step back, as if he’d been unaware until that point just how close he’d been standing. “I have never
Sam and Dean had fully expected Castiel to need a few days or even weeks rest after his resurrection, but much to their surprise after spending much of his first day unconscious, Cas was more or less back to fighting fit (minus angelic strength of course). With that, just over a week after his latest miraculous return, there seems no reason not to invite him along for a hunt.
“This was fun,” Dean says, patting Castiel’s shoulder, passing as much warmth through that touch as he can.
bad. I’m just not a freak like you who sleeps with their knife collection under their pillow to become ‘one with the knives’,” Dean mocks, which gets the childish response of a middle-finger from Jo.
Cas’ attention darts back to Dean wholly, his eyes blown wide again, looking more like a deer in headlights than any kind of fearsome warrior. “I— I suppose there is some,” he stammers. “It’s definitely— some things are certainly blown out of proportion…” he trails off, shifting his gaze back over to his knives and even shuffling over to aimlessly rearrange them on the table.
Dean places a hand at Castiel’s cheek to lift his head up. “Hey, Cas, look at me,” he says, forceful in his stress. “What the hell just happened.”
Jack is left with a neighbour when the three of them head off, with Dean relegated to the back seat as he’s clearly several rungs below Cas in future Dean’s pecking order. The drive is short and leads them to what looks like an empty back road in the middle of nowhere. There’s a door tucked into the side of the road that looks like some kind sewer entrance that workmen might use.
Dean sighs. “Yeah… I dunno. Something’s just felt… off this whole time. I can’t put my finger on it, just feels weird.” He reaches over to take the letter opener from Jo. “You can’t say that all the secrecy, the way Cas does things, that it doesn’t bother you at all?”
Bobby and Castiel pass their attention to Sam, who squirms under the scrutiny. “Yeah, I’m with Dean. I don’t wanna leave Cas behind either, not if there’s a better option.”
It’s not long before there are several stacks of books in the centre of the wooden table, each member of the gang taking one to paw through. Dean’s older self dumps one in front of him with a thunk. “Why don’t you make yourself useful,” he sighs. “I hate reading just as much as you, believe me, but it’ll go much faster with an extra set of eyes.”
Castiel’s mouth dries up, his throat wants to close. The words that came so easy to him a moment ago now refuse to shift, like dried cement in his chest.
Cas frowns. “Because he would have reported back to the angels, giving away our location and our intention to find the tablet, both things that we cannot afford to let the angels know,” he says in a biting and assured tone.
“Okay good,” Sam says with a nod. “I’m really glad you’ve got a good thing, I just— I wouldn’t want you putting yourself in danger for it.”
“Jo, can you get that?” Victor asks, pointing to an angel blade, discarded to the side. Jo nods and grabs it. “Dean, you can deal with the body. Cas showed you the wards, right?” Dean nods and Victor then carries a despondent Cas out of the barn and back towards the house.
As the sun sets, obscured in its entirety by the thick cloud cover, the sky begins to darken from a light overcast grey to a dark and gloomy slate. Without civilisation nor the gentle glow of the moonlight to guide them, they slow down and start searching for an adequate place to settle for the night.
Then there’s the weight of his guilt every time Bobby helps him up, or brings him soup he doesn’t eat, or redresses his bandages.
At the end of the chant, Cas tosses a lit match into the bowl, a red flame erupting upwards before simmering down into a glowing red flame, low and bubbling like a hot potion. And so they wait with bated breath for the rabbit to enter the trap.
“Dean,” Castiel stops him, a hand pressed onto Dean’s forearm. “I— That’s very kind of you, but I couldn’t.”
If Cas were the same man, or angel, or whatever he is now, as he was years ago, he might have crumbled at this point, or run away, more likely. But whoever this man is, however he came to exist, whatever cruel trick the universe is playing, he cannot let it affect him. Things are bigger than they were then, and there are more lives at stake than just one man and his brother, and as much as Cas wants to curl up, to scream, to cry, he can’t. Because he has a job to do, one he actually gives a damn about.
He’s covered in dirt, sweat, and demon blood. He’s exhausted and there’s a cot with thick blankets and his name on it waiting for him just through the mess of tents and cabins. That’s all Dean can think about when he staggers in through the heavy iron gate with Jo in tow close behind.
“So you’re saying I need to try harder?” Dean nods. “Okay, lemme think on that and I’ll get back to you.” He flicks the excess water from his hands at Cas before walking out to join Sam and Eileen.
Dean pulls Castiel up, keeping the kiss connected as he does, and begins walking them back, stumbling through every step. Dean’s back meets a wall and Castiel almost pushes him through it. The force and weight of him is thrilling. Castiel pulls back from Dean’s lips, but only for a moment as he starts laying kisses at Dean’s jaw, his neck, and his collarbone, nipping and biting there. He wants more of Dean, maybe all of him. Dean would give him anything and everything in this moment.
With no alarm nor natural light to rouse him, it’s coming up to 11am when Dean wakes up. As expected of such an hour, the kitchen is empty when he gets there, with Sam long since breakfasted. A part of him had hoped that in his little domestic fantasy simulation he would have had Cas waiting for him with a fresh cup of coffee. But no dice, apparently.
don’t. But tell me then, Dean, since you think I’m too starstruck to see sense, tell me why do you think I
Dean mouth is perched open in shock. He’s sure now, this can’t be his universe. Not if he’s the one who’s settled down with a kid and
He’s not trying to impress Cas. Well in a way he is, but it’s solely with the goal of victory in mind. Cas being gay definitely complicates things. He’s still pushing his boundaries the same way, but now it’s with the express goal of tantalising rather than repulsing him. It definitely carries different, much more loaded connotations. But Dean Winchester is not a coward and he’s not a quitter.
They alternate rounds throughout the night. Dean goes up for the next one, waiting with one arm leaning against the bar while the bartender fusses with all the various ingredients for Cas’ horror concoction. He hasn’t started on Dean’s whiskey yet, and a mild alcohol buzz he lets curiosity get the better of his shame. “Hey barkeep, can you make that two and forget the whiskey?”
“Our strategy is to avoid them for the most part. But where we can’t, yes, we need to be smarter than attempting to take them head on,” Cas shoots back with confidence that can only be born from experience.
“You know,” Dean starts, tentative. “It’s a real shame that— that your first kiss was just some stupid ploy. It was messy, y’know— all teeth, definitely not my best work. I can do way better.”
If angels could cry, Castiel thinks that he would now as he looks upon Dean’s sleeping form one last time. Gently, so carefully as if he were handling delicate porcelain, he brushes a hand over Dean’s cheek, the rough texture of stubble comforting against his skin. He leans down and places a kiss at Dean’s other cheek. Reluctantly he pulls away, his throat tight and his heart heavy.
The fruity abomination is actually… kinda good, Dean must admit. It’s not overly sweet like he was expecting - the pineapple and lime combo actually makes it kinda tangy if anything. It’s also surprisingly strong. Dean had never actually taken the time to read cocktail menus, typically just writing them off as weak shit for wine moms who want to feel adventurous, but cocktails actually have a
“I thought there was nothing keeping me here anymore. So I was gunna just-” he bites back the words. “And then, I dunno I just passed out I guess. And when I came to, I didn’t really remember much, but I had this fuzzy feeling in my head. I thought I was just hungover, but it felt like there was the memory of a dream just out of reach. Every time I tried to remember it, it slipped further away. But it felt warm. Whatever it was, it felt hopeful, it felt like a reason to keep going. So I did. And the next day I hit the road and headed for Stanford.”
“Uh… hi,” Dean says, keeping short as the angel stares him down. “What, uh, what brings you to town? Don’t see a lotta angels walking the streets ‘round here.”
“I can’t believe I never told you boys that story,” Jody says, wiping tears from her eyes as her laughter dies down.
Cas was, and still is, glad that Bobby was able to spend his final days in the house where he had formed so many fond memories with the Winchester brothers whom he held so dear. Especially since not long after his passing the angels’ little exclusion zone expanded and swallowed up Sioux Falls and the neighbouring towns.
Cas pulls a face to himself, not turning to look a Dean at all. “We need to speak to another angel, someone higher up the food chain,” Cas says, attention pointed squarely at Victor.
be back. And—” Castiel pauses to blow out a long breath, squeezing his eyes shut as he does. “More angels will come. That is if they’re not already on their way.”
“Yes,” Castiel says. “Of course, to an angel fifty years is a very small proportion of our life-span.”
Castiel chuckles. Of course Dean would say that. He doubts Bobby would have believed it for a second. The most recent Castiel finds is a letter from Sam from around three weeks ago;
The odds of success are slim, certainly, but the consequences of trying are unlikely to outweigh the alternative. Thus, in a swift move, Dean draws his blade; a short hunting knife; and plunges it into the angel’s chest, right where his heart would be were he human.
“You know,” Jody leans forward, loosened up and a tad wine-drunk. “I’m really pleased for you two. I am. And I know Bobby would be proud if he were here.”
Good question. Is it dangerous to walk up to the city of angels— the most heavily guarded place on this Earth— with no plan and one crappy old knife and attempt to sneak past an angel; a holy warrior of God; to get into a place where the punishment for trespass is death?
Cas exchanges a look with Victor, who simply looks on with a humoured pity. Without the wherewithal to protest further, Cas lays down and throws the blanket over himself. Dean takes a seat by the window, gazing out into the street with a hand poised at the hilt of his angel blade.
“Is that what you really think? That we can’t help?” Cas tilts his head, unsettling Dean a little with how weirdly alien this guy seems, and that’s before he considers the fact that the guy was just waiting by the door to catch him escaping. Cas doesn’t wait for Dean to answer his question, “Sit with me, have a coffee. Or can I tempt you with a hot chocolate?”
The guilt has not faded, but rather morphed into fact. The fact of Castiel’s continued existence in the form he now takes. There is no life after that, only existence. Still, existing here in Bobby’s house even is far too close to a life. Certainly Bobby doesn’t need him here, and as much as he may be (shockingly) too polite to say it, Castiel suspects that he doesn’t really want him here either.
“Well I think we should probably know if your contact is an angel,” Jo mutters, clearly taking the sidelining about as well as Dean in this case.
He rolls onto his side and tugs open the drawer in the wooden side table. The drawer slides open with a rattle, as the only item in there slides along the bottom and bangs against the sides. It’s an old lighter, the metal case is scratched. Cas flicks open the cap, and there’s a click, but no flame. It’s long been empty, the fluid having slowly evaporated into the stale air.
The second after Cas’ hand makes contact with Dean’s shoulder, they’re standing in the middle of some dingy motel room, beer bottles strewn across the floor.
Older Dean bites his lip, a habit he apparently hadn’t dropped from his youth. “Yeah, I dunno,” he admits. “When the angel who zapped me made his point he came and zapped me back.”
Dean’s older self sighs, closing eyes, as if conceding the silent argument. “I’m going to bed,” he states, voice calm and quiet once again. He turns to his younger self.
The first thing that really strikes him is just how much of his back he can see, how cleanly his vision cuts over his shoulder unobstructed. Then his attention settles on the two large patches of pinkish scar tissue marking his upper back.
Castiel is a million miles off, staring ahead at the kitchen window opposite his seat, marked with a painted-on sigil. Dean would worry that he was still feeling guilty, but Castiel’s expression is not one of guilt, but one of resignation.
Dean blinks, realising the alcohol has kinda caught up with him after all these rounds. He definitely hasn’t, but he
“Yeah, sure y’are,” Bobby says with a scoff. There’s a sad look in Bobby’s eyes, and he keeps passing furtive glances in Castiel’s direction, making guilt and panic flare up in Castiel’s heart every time. “So…” Bobby begins apprehensively. “What happened? You said— you said Sam and Dean are gone. What, uh, what did you mean?”
“You’re not sick enough to get outta getting hit anymore. You know that right?” Dean threatens, fists clenched on the tabletop.
“You’re telling me,” Dean says. Dean pulls himself back upright giving Castiel the space to do the same. He rests a hand at Castiel’s jaw for a moment, before pulling him in again. This time the kiss is slower, sweeter, like a light dessert after the main course. “Go somewhere with me,” Dean says softly after pulling back.
“Come here,” Dean says, tugging gently. He’s smiling suggestively, inviting Cas to get closer at the same time as inviting him to take the out.
As his mind reels through blame and guilt at his failure, Castiel almost neglects his duty further. At the last moment, his attention is drawn to the edge of the trees where Dean is already emerging into the open. Castiel feels his chest heat up, and his feathers fluff.
In addition, Sam’s condition is anything but stable. One moment he’s freezing cold and Dean’s piling blankets on top of him until the shivering stops; the next he’s sweltering hot and Dean’s dabbing his forehead with a wet washcloth desperately trying to cool him down. And all throughout Sam remains asleep, completely unconscious and unable to wake. He stirs and shifts and thrashes, even, but never wakes. Not for a gruelling thirty-six hours.
Castiel wouldn’t look out of place in a pleasant cottage in the English countryside, at a farmer’s market (god forbid), at the front of  lecture hall, but instead he’s holed up ‘in the muck’, so to speak, with the Winchesters.
have Bobby look at him and see how stupid he is. If all of this is just him saving his brother, that’s one thing and he’ll take the shit he gets for that happily. Having Bobby know, though, that he’d gone and got himself in even more hot water over a pair of pretty blue eyes is… “No, it’s not like that. He’s a friend.”
“Uh…” Dean hesitates, awkward as his plan is so quickly foiled. “I was just looking for the bathroom.”
“We won’t bring any,” Cas assures her, in that soft voice and those kind eyes of his that just instil trust. “We’re just passing through.”
“Holy shit,” Jo breathes. She looks up at Dean with bright eyes. It’s the bit of hope they’ve been waiting for, hell, it’s
“You can’t lie to me, Cas,” he says, voice quiet, carrying only as far as the man to his left. “You been off since yesterday. Something happen?”
Dean shoves his hand into the right-hand pocket of the leather jacket cocooning his narrow shoulders. He draws out his keys, singles out the silver key and opens up the car door-
Cas, who was still completely destroyed by Dean whenever he got a little suggestive, could only nod and utter a broken. “Y-Yeah.”
“So are you,” Cas said, pushing himself up off the floor and over to one of the many boxes scattered around the room. “I’ve got something for you. A housewarming gift.”
Cas scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Yes, technically,” he snips. “But it’s othering to phrase it like that.”
On the first day back from a hunt there are usually a fair few errands to run and chores to do, meaning Dean genuinely doesn’t bump into Cas the rest of the afternoon. He really doesn’t have the time to wonder what Cas has been up to all day, but he wonders nonetheless. He imagines, and dreads, that Cas has been using his free time to concoct horrific scenarios to torture Dean with this evening.
Castiel straightens his back and draws his blade, gripping it firm, refusing to be disarmed by the devilish smile curling at Dean’s lips. “I am an angel,” Castiel asserts, as much a reminder to himself as to Dean. “I ought to have executed you weeks ago. That I did not was my own mistake, don’t assume I’ll make it again.”
So they begin on foot, opting to take a circuitous route through the woods where they at least have decent cover, and can avoid the angels patrolling all of the roads into the uninhabited zone. That isn’t to say the woods are unpatrolled, as Cas warns the group before the enter. “This path is very dangerous still,” he says, brows furrowed and face steely and serious. “We are warded and have cover here, which gives us a better chance than the heavily guarded main roads. If you see or hear anything that didn’t come from one of us, get ready to fight for your life, and I want all of you to have your blades in your hands at all times.”
Dean shoots up and whips his jacket off the back of his chair. “Yes, let’s go,” he says, grabbing his duffel and darting outside. He’s in the front seat before anyone can say or do anything else to him. Some forethought would have had him telling Sam to ride shotgun, but his coffee’s barely hit and he’s not that forward thinking on a good day. So there’s Cas clambering into the front seat beside him with a smug smile.
Castiel eyes the mysterious unlabelled bottle, stoppered with a cork. “Is it safe for human consumption?”
The days eke on by, the late summer sun warm come evening, shining down in yellow gold tones. It’s one of the few things of which Castiel never tires. The comfort of the sunlight, the serene glow of the full moon, the patterns of the stars and the vivid colours of the flowers. They could never become mundane, and with little else to do Castiel spends day and night marvelling at nature’s wonders from this tiny patch of Earth.
“Maybe— I could do something nice for him?” Dean scours his mind for inspiration— then it comes to him. “I know what to do.”
Sam nods. “Cas could probably fix that hangover you know,” he suggests. “I know he doesn’t usually, but he might make an exception now that you’re dating.”
“Yes,” Cas says slowly, with a nod. “But also… no. Anyway, I appreciate Dean being so willing to offer his clothing to me.”
Victor is eager to get going that very day, and Cas is in no position to argue. Just this morning Cas too had been all in favour of kicking off this mission as soon as humanly possible. That is, before he was thrown completely for a loop.
“I dreamt that you and I were on a deserted island.” Cas relayed, tracing shapes on Dean’s chest with his index finger.
Castiel frowns. He is not unused to being goaded— demons do it all the time, a hideously uncouth display of pride and hubris. This is something different, the sharp tones masking the tremor in the voice; it’s the last stand of a condemned man.
“That it?” Dean asked, expecting that angel dreams would be epic and complex, or at least that the dream would be as batshit insane as his husband was when conscious.
“No, no, actually, this is okay, I can work with this,” Dean says, settling down. “You can’t break the rules or your forfeit. So,” Dean crawls over the bed to where Cas is sitting and tugs Cas by the waist until their faces are inches apart. “I just gotta make you really,
“I’d just found out that dad was missing. I was in some crappy motel somewhere after a routine salt-n-burn. I had to decide if I was gunna go and get Sam from Stanford. And I decided not to. Instead I bought enough alcohol to sedate a killer whale and loaded my gun…” Dean lets out a jagged breath. “I was done. With hunting, with fighting, with everything. I didn’t want to get Sam because what was the point. I figured dad was probably dead and Sam was probably better off without either of us.”
The time he spent awake between bouts of sleep is equally hazy. All he can remember with any sense of clarity is that every time he’d awoken, he’d turned to his side, reached out into the empty sheets. Just in case. But he was alone the whole night. He remembers the drop of his stomach every time that realisation hit.
“Angels are never children,” Castiel states simply. “From the moment of our inception we possess the infinite knowledge of the universe. Angels are… constant. We are fixed points in existence; we don’t grow or change or age— we just
In many ways, he pities him. He needn’t imagine how unfulfilling it is, serving a cause you believe in by birthright, and in such a menial way. Efram, he imagines, feels much the same that he did once, unsure of his purpose, struggling to find faith in the cause— at least if the speed at which he broke is any indication.
It all just makes sense, it all clicks into place and fits that age old pattern— Dean’s fucked things up again. His actions, his choices, his wants have all turned to lead dragging at his heels and pulling him under. And this time his taking Sam down with him.
Dean nips as Castiel’s bottom lip which draws a happy sound from Castiel’s throat. Dean wishes he could stay there forever, entangled with Castiel like this. He gets the feeling Castiel wishes the very same. Every day it seems less and less certain that something like that would be possible, and the chances were slim to begin with. So they savour this moment, every sensation and every taste and every touch.
that it would be weird, even if he can’t explain it. Maybe it’s because Cas is an angel that he just doesn’t
“A bet,” Cas says, grinning. “I bet that you couldn’t go around letting people think we were a couple without correcting them.”
Dean licked his lips and started rolling his wedding band around his finger as he was put in the not unusual bet never pleasant situation of having to correct someone to explain himself.
Cas’ words are plugged by the lump forming in his throat. The fresh wounds stung, as the shock faded and the pain set in. The pain of realisation that it’s all over. The life he always dreamed of was now further out of reach than it had ever been. Even the future he had envisioned, unfulfilled and alone, yet at the very least always close enough to skim the edges of his wildest dreams, to skirt by on the periphery of the life he wanted to lead. But now it was completely gone, not a speck or a glimmer of anything remotely worth dreaming of. And the feeling was… empty.
“So is that what you and Cas have been doing? Trying to one-up each other until one of you chickens out?” Sam says, working through the ridiculousness of it all. “Like gay chicken or something?”
Regret. Dean stares at Cas, flabbergasted. He wipes his saliva-wet finger on his shirt and tries to return to his burger. His appetite’s kind of faded though. Or maybe he’s just not hungering for
Dean pauses, he frowns as he goes insular, thinking and digging through his mind. “Yeah,” he finally says. “I think my dad probably- he always used to… I don’t know, he’d say stuff.”
“You okay?” he asks, quiet and sincere. Cas is sporting the same pained expression he had been the other night after the interrogation in the barn. It’s strange, really. For a guy who supposedly has a vendetta against angels, it’s almost like he takes it personally when he kills them. Dean doesn’t even begin trying to understand.
As the other two slip into sleep, the only sound in the room that of their slow resting breaths, Cas lies awake. He allows himself the luxury of watching Dean, admiring how the moonlight casts his face in cool light and sharp shadows.
He can’t even get past the initial shock for long enough to formulate the right questions. He can’t even figure out how he’s feeling, how he’s
The question of what one typically wears on a sort-of-date with an angel is one that doesn’t have any easy answers, especially when there’s a good hour’s walk in it too. Dean frets about it for far too long, especially considering that his date only seems to have the one outfit and probably doesn’t have much interest in human fashion choices. Plus Dean has a very limited wardrobe to begin with of almost exclusively practical clothing he can wear on the job.
Jo trudges in not long after Dean first regains consciousness. She’s already dressed, but still rubbing her eyes and yawning from sleep. “Cas,” she says, her voice rough in the morning. “You didn’t wake me for my shift.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean sighs, catching sight of a hint of dark leather. He tugs at it, pulling out something he hadn’t seen or thought of in a while; his dad’s old coat.
Cas stares at him again and Dean’s trying to figure out what the fuck he said to make the guy look at him like that, or wonders if maybe there’s something on his face. “The angels don’t have it,” Cas says, gaze locked onto Dean as he does.
“What you yelling for, boy?” Bobby growls. “I was just settling down for the night and—” his words trail off as he spies the angel stood wringing his hands on his porch. “What the hell have you boys got yourselves into?”
“Maybe, if they were desperate enough,” Dean says. “I mean, I don’t think most of the folks in this town would.”
“I know,” Cas says, meeting Dean’s eye briefly before shrinking away from his gaze. “There are some things it’s safer if you don’t know. Believe me, if there is something you need to know, you will know it.”
“Oh that’s a shame,” Sam continues, batting Dean’s hands down. Dean momentarily sighs in relief, before his hopes are dashed. “But we’ll still come down even if the girls aren’t there, it’d be nice to catch up. In fact, all the more reason; you’ll have the room… We’re about five hours out, so be there in time for dinner… Awesome, see you soon.” Sam cuts the line and puts his phone down on the table. “What’s your problem? Why don’t you wanna see Jody?”
“‘Yeah, that’s me; cute girl for the cute bug.’. And then he laughed a little bit. Then he even commented on my tattoos he was like ‘nice sleeve’ and we talked about them a little bit and I asked him if he had any and he said he has one, but it’s on his chest. So… I was a little brave and I said ‘Oh, well you can show me some time if you want’ and I could have sworn he got a little flustered.”
Cas doesn’t respond in words, but merely hums in acknowledgement. He’s far to transfixed on the array of flannel before him, as if trying to choose between 80 different yet ultimately identical brands of plain cornflakes.
There’s a gate. Not a tall, magnificent, grand gateway, but instead a small side gate, tucked into a recess in the stone. Through the shrubbery, a single sentry can be seen standing guard. His tan, muscular form is stiff and formal, his blue eyes piercing though the air, vigilant. A short and sharp silver blade sits on the brown leather belt that draws in the sentry’s white robes in the middle. On his back sit a pair of black feathered wings, an iridescence to them, like an oil-slick catching the light.
he really wanted. In all of his millions of years, the universes, the stars and the ages, the one thing. And he never would.
“Castiel?” Azrael turns, startled. “You come with orders? Strange, I had not received any new revelation.” Castiel does not answer. “Ah,” Azrael nods, passing snotty look up and down at Castiel. “Not orders then.”
Dean’s charming smile certainly makes it tempting, but Castiel’s already embedded himself on the angel’s shit-list, and for lesser offences. Besides, while it may be monotonous, dull and actively killing his brain cells, Castiel’s duty is not without its importance.
“Uhhh, that him?” Tia said, pointing towards the table that Dean was quickly approaching, two beers in hand, where a smiling Castiel sat in wait.
“Since Cas healed me I guess,” Sam says with a shrug. “It’s not a big deal. Like you keep saying, recovery takes time.”
Castiel stoops down to pick up the knife. Slowly, with the permission of his guards, he approaches Dean. He bends down to where Dean is slumped over, lifting his head up with a firm hand around the side of his face, the other hand gripping the knife’s hilt.
The bridge was little more than a simple arch-shape; no walls or railings. Cas sits down with his feet dangling over, almost skimming the trickling water as it flows underneath. Dean followed suit, perching on the edge of this old, tiny stone bridge beside Castiel, eating a burger and watching the stars come out.
“No, there’s also me,” Cas says, eyes firmly locked with Dean’s. “I would gladly die before I allow an angel to— to harm any one of you.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Jack says, clearly taking care to be polite and proper. “Dad says you’re other dad’s cousin who’s also called Dean.”
Dean grabbed Cas’s hand from his face and held it in his own. “I mean moving into an actual house with you,” he said. “I always thought that the only permanent  place I’d ever have would be my grave, y’know.”
Their faces inches apart, there’s a moment of realisation between the two. The only thing standing between Dean and what he wants is Castiel, and in less than a moment, with little more than a single thrust, that obstacle could be gone. Now, for the first time, Castiel is acutely aware that he is an angel with a duty, and Dean is a threat.
to date her. I was wingman-ing you the whole time— I literally spoke about how great you were the whole evening.”
Dean shifts into a sitting position. “Yeah, I thought that you might try to sneak off. Again. That was pretty fucking shitty, Cas.” Dean swallows. “But when I woke up and you were still here, I thought— I thought you were gunna stay.”
“Hey I’m not complaining,” Sam clarifies, hands up in surrender. “Seriously dude, it looks good on you. I just wasn’t expecting something so… y’know.”
“I’m not entirely sure but my unfinished business is different from theirs; don’t worry I’m getting there. I eventually realized I can make myself… dormant, for lack of a better word, so that even when other ghosts are around they can’t perceive me. I was able to catch up on most of what you found out that way. Sorry to eavesdrop, but being a ghost doesn’t really allow for much privacy.”
first thing Dean did was run into his arms like a freaking girl in a young adult novel and hold him as tight as he could. Before Cas could get out more than a fond “hello, Dean,” he planted a fervent kiss on his lips—much to the audible surprise of Sam and Eileen, but screw them this was important. Kissing Cas felt just as good as he always feared it would, made sense in ways he had dutifully ignored until Cas put it all out there (and then just
“When we were playing the Orpheum. The guys were dealing with Caleb and I thought I was gonna have to play solo, so I ran into the alley and had a freakout. I umm…” she looks at her dad awkwardly. “I spoke to mom, or prayed or something, but I asked her for a sign. And two seconds later some lady walked by and handed me a dahlia.”
Julie laughs and shakes her head. “A decade? So much for speeding things up by just accepting that it’s happening.”
He doesn’t feel like getting into his personal history with a kid he barely knows, so he settles for something that’s technically true but not very useful. “We went to the same high school. But if you don’t mind, I’d prefer it if we asked the questions.”
“Yeah. Oh, wait.” A notebook comes sailing through the room towards Dean. “He wants to talk to you.”
“Exactly,” Sam smiles proudly. “What if what we call ghosts are just the ghosts who don’t make it? We only have reason to hunt those ones because they’re harming people, but if the guys really are just ghosts, then we don’t actually know all that much about ghosts that don’t become obsessed.”
He knows Sam’s not gonna let up until Dean gives him more to go on than a hunch, but he can’t tell him
“Yeah,” Reggie concurs. “We had to cross over sometime. And besides, you did your part flawlessly; we’re the ones who got tripped up.”
Julie rejoins them then and takes a deep breath. “Okay, so the guys are willing to talk to you, but you won’t be able to communicate with them unless we’re playing music, so let’s just, start with a song I guess.”
And that’s why he loves his little brother. He doesn’t even have to ask; he just knows it’s true. He also knows how much Dean would be beating himself up if he’d left Cas hanging—and let’s be real, it’s extremely likely he would have done just that. “Yeah, I said it.”
Sam passes a wide-eyed look between the two before slinking away with a murmur about ‘staying out of it and getting some sleep’.
Dean stops dead, putting down the kettle he’d just picked up. “Ruby? Dude, you sure she wasn’t a hooker? I mean, no offence, but that’s a hooker name.”
went?” Dean’s response groan this time is meant to convey concern and protest. Somehow Sam understands. “I have to start going out again some time, Dean. We said I should ease back into it, right? Not raise any alarm bells? I’ll just be doing a small supply run, nothing major.”
There’s a moment of pained silence at the table as everyone knows what they have to do next, but nobody wants to make the first move. Bobby is the first. “You boys stay safe,” he says, gruff as he can manage.
“When you find the Men of Letters,” Castiel begins, slow and wary, his hands fumbling in his lap. “I’m going to go.”
“Do not misunderstand, I’m more than happy to do it, I’m fully on board. I just want to make sure we all understand that this is a one use only for me.”
Older Dean licks his bottom lip, eyes fixed on the road. “You know what, sometimes you gotta make your own pie. Don’t judge me.”
Dean only realises he’s been staring at this angel when the angel turns his head in a sharp whip-like move, to meet his gaze. The angel’s dark brown eyes are piercing in a way very similar to Castiel’s— Dean thinks there could be an entire universe contained in his dark irises.
“Sure,” Dean says, clearing his throat before proceeding to order for the pair of them, which in hindsight probably didn’t help dispel any notion of he and Cas as a couple. As the waitress, ‘Lucy’ according to her name-tag, skips away still grinning, Dean scoffs and shakes his head. “God, this again. You know people always used to mistake me and Sam for a couple. I never got it. And it was so weird; we’re
Dean grins and now runs his hands over Castiel’s feathers with purpose. Castiel sighs and leans into the touch. Dean’s fingers leave a trail of iridescence as his feathers shift under the light. Castiel shivers, his wings fluttering.
As an angel, Castiel is unused to being powerless, particularly in the face of a simple human. And yet he had been rendered completely defenceless, utterly at the mercy of this one man. But not, as he has come to realise, by the blade at his side, but something else. He had been paralysed not by fear, nor by helplessness or lack of options, but by a kiss, a look, and an inexplicable inability to do harm to the man.
It’s the afternoon when they’re finally ready to head out of the camp. Dean and Jo are already waiting in the back of the crappy little cart they’ve got for transport. It’s hardly the height of comfort, but it’s practical and affordable for what is essentially a backwater militia. Cas goes up front with Victor, not particularly fond of the idea of making small talk with fake-Dean and the girl. Victor at the very least has an appreciation for a comfortable silence.
“Forget about it man, it’s fine,” Dean says, holding up a hand to stop him. He can’t hear any more. Dean chews on his bottom lip and then says, “So we’re off then? No more rules, no more penalties, we’re just us again?”
” Sam says, taking a small sip. “But she’s staying in town a few days and she wants to meet up again…”
“I’m sure you’ve heard much of the chatter. The levels of demonic activity in this area is beginning to raise concern.”
“It’s safe to say they didn’t appreciate it, no,” Castiel agrees. “That wouldn’t typically be enough to motivate a demotion, though. In the end, I think I disobeyed a direct order one too many times. My vocal opposition to my superiors’ strategy paired with my influence on all those under my command— they couldn’t allow that kind of attitude to spread.”
“Did he tell you what you needed to hear?” Dean spits, rounding the table to wash his own bloodied hands in the sink.
Evening’s are beautiful here. The way the sunlight splinters out through the trees, painting the world in amber splotches; the way the air is still and the world silent; the way the clouds sit in the sky like cotton candy, soft, light and glowing with radiant backlit sunshine. Every evening is perfect enough to be a date night, but not every evening is free enough.
Dean looks over to his older self as they pull into the drive. He’s still tense, and Dean’s not sure why. His best guess is that he’s reluctant to bring a remnant of his old life into his normal suburban life. Maybe his wife doesn’t know about his past. Dean doesn’t even consider that the apprehension is for his benefit.
“A contact?” Victor raises his eyebrows. Cas keeps steady eye-contact with Victor, his intensity seemingly delivering a clear message. Victor nods in understanding. “Right. A contact. You sure they’ll talk?”
“Angels are real, and they’re dicks,” Dean repeats with an accepting nod. “Alright, fine. Normally I’d call bullshit, but I’m drinking whiskey with myself right now, so.”
Castiel can’t be sure what he looks like in that moment. Bloody, for sure. But he can barely feel his face, although it’s pretty likely he’s wearing some pathetic distraught expression if the way Bobby’s face twists and sinks is any indication.
Dean runs a finger across a line of books. “Why, you wanna get something for your new knife throwing instructor? A little inappropriate, don’t you think? The whole student-teacher thing?”
The man makes a move to rise to his feet, but doesn’t. “Dean Winchester,” he answers, tone rising at the tail end as if unsure.
Angels always heal clean; there’s no such thing as a scar for an angel. Castiel cannot know in that moment whether the difference in this case is the nature of the injury or whatever change he is now undergoing in himself.
The sun is just about to set, so they’ve made good time. Facing angels in the dark woods with the disadvantage of low visibility is not generally advisable.
Dean scoffs, indignant. “Um, no. I don’t give a shit what some random people in a diner think about me.”
Dean, for reasons that are beyond his conscious understanding, decides one evening to fish out that old box again. The messy tapestry of his life; Flannel on Canvas, c. 2005. There’s a loose thread he’s left dangling ever since he lost Cas, and he has been trying not to pull on it. And nobody else has made him, nobody’s pushed him. Not Cas, because of course he never would. Not Sam, mainly because he’s out of the loop.
Dean swallows. He’s close enough here to lunge, provided he’s very quick. And he usually is— he’s never been the biggest guy on the field, nor the smartest, so he’s always had to make do simply being the quickest. But angels are no small-town scrappers; they’re holy warriors who can face up against the darkest and most dangerous and never be the first to blink.
“Uh, yeah, hey,” Dean said, holding his hand over his eyes to shield them from the piercing sunlight. “I’m Dean. You live next-door?”
As the last shreds of light fade out and the words dips into the dark, the group gets antsy. The spell is all laid out, waiting only for the final incantation to activate it. There’s a ring of holy oil ready to be ignited, with Victor standing by to set it alight as soon as the angel steps inside. Dean and Jo are hidden behind hay bales, poised to strike in the case that anything should go awry.
They infiltrate the nest taking it from three sides, creeping through with blades sharp and sure, taking heads clean off shoulders with swift precision. Within minutes they’ve all but cleaned house, with the exception of one remaining vamp, baring it’s fangs and closing in on Dean, who’s ready with a mean look and machete in hand. Dean’s eyes are fixed on the vamp’s, his fingers brace around the blade’s handle, the muscles in his arm readying for a single heavy swing.
Castiel finds himself distinctly less bloody than he was, in fact he’s wearing pants that aren’t his and no shirt. Instead, his torso is heavily bandaged. There’s a pile of blood-stained fabric in the corner of the room, which appears to be not only his old angel robes, but a few bloody rags too.
Cas is there at 7:30 on the dot, keeping time immaculately like he’s got some kind of perfect angelic body clock. “Are you ready?” Cas asks, the question loaded.
So then, perhaps the passivity is its own defence mechanism. Perhaps, the path of least resistance is quite literally the least possible resistance. If demons want to get at the citadel, go on through! If angel’s want this place, they’ll clear out, no problem.
Castiel nods, unable to verbalise his thanks, if he even is thankful; he’s still not sure he wouldn’t be better off bleeding out on a hillside. But this man has showed him kindness, and so he will honour that kindness.
“You seem like you’re in better shape,” Bobby says as Castiel stretches up to a high cupboard without so much as a grimace.
“I was just going to wear what I’m wearing now,” Cas replied, dressed in his regular day clothes, which consisted primarily of knitted jumpers and slacks. “There’s no need to get changed, I think you look great in whatever you wear.”
As the light dies down, Cas turns to Dean, places a hand on his shoulder, and with a whoosh of whipping wings, they’re gone.
Dean cups Castiel’s face and drags him back up to meet his lips. In an expert move that is infinitely harder on a winged partner, Dean flips them over. Dean doesn’t know what he wants— there are too many things really. He wants to take his time, he wants it all right this second, he wants to hold and he wants to be held. But most of all, Dean wants to show Castiel what real devout worship looks like, and how good it can feel.
The impromptu chat is cut short as Cas and Jo enter through the front door, Jo beaming and chatting away happily to Cas as they walk in.
One life is saved, another is changed for the better. Castiel is the reason why. Though his days remain the same, and his duty at this gate wears on him like the rhythmic crash of the tides weathering away the rocky cliffside, he can face it now with a sense of pride at the very least.
Dean can only look on in a wordless panic. Fight or flight is nowhere to be found as Dean completely shuts off. His mind isn’t reeling, it’s frozen in place like a computer crash. He cannot even process the motion of his evil twin pulling a flask from his pocket and dousing him in water until it’s already happened.
Garth gestures for the two to take a seat, so they do. “Would you like a hot chocolate? I always like to have one before bed; helps me sleep.” The two shake their heads. “Alright, don’t wanna drift off during the festivities I bet.”
Dean sets down his bag and start laying out the blanket and spreading out all the food he brought. It’s apparently more than they really need if angels really don’t eat, which in hindsight should have been evident after the revelation that they don’t sleep. Dean’s nothing if not a champion food vacuum, though, so all it means it’s he’s probably looking at an afternoon carb crash. There are certainly worse fates.
When he does go into town, Azrael is still lurking about, all stiff posture and cold eyes. Heat and anger bubbles in his gut when he sees him. Azrael’s eyes scan the area, lingering on Dean for a moment longer than is comfortable before darting away. But he never approaches, never interacts, not since that first time.
“How you feeling, Cas?” Dean asks between mouthfuls. He’s looking at Cas with an open expression, and Cas can tell he’s really trying, making a real concerted effort here, and he can’t help but resent it.
Cas obliges and first works Dean out of his jeans before freeing him of his boxers. He sheds his own before climbing back over him, continuing the kiss. There’s a pang of pleasure every time Dean brushes against Cas’ thigh, powerful but fleeting, leaving Dean aching for something more substantial.
“I truly believe it’s for the best that I go,” Castiel says, looking down at his hands clasped in his lap. “I don’t want to leave you, Dean. I wouldn’t unless I truly thought it was best for you. I— I thought about leaving. In the night. But I didn’t think it would fair to do that. Not again.”
Whatever, almost dry-humping his best friend as part of an elaborate game of gay-chicken is not even in the top ten of things that keep Dean up at night. He heads back to his room to give sleep a try, but when he opens the door, Cas is there sitting on his bed waiting for him.
to feel. But above all, he can’t allow himself to believe it. Whoever this man is, he’s not his Dean, he can’t be, because there is no force in this universe that would ever be so kind.
The days following the vamp hunt are relatively chilled. There’s no world-ending threat to research in the down-time between cases, so the Winchesters’ and Castiel spend most of their time reading, watching movies, and doing chores. It’s the remarkably ordinary interlude in an extraordinary life.
Cas strokes hand on Dean’s face a places a kiss softly on his lips. He doesn’t say anything, and Dean doesn’t want him to. They lie there in each others arms until Dean slips off to sleep. As soon as Cas hears the familiar rhythm of Dean’s sleeping heart rate, he slips out of bed. They still have a good 7 hours or so on the clock before the spell wears off, and Cas knows now what he must do. So as Dean sleeps soundly, Cas uses the power for one last trip.
Dean’s older self steps up to him, take a breath, then hugs him. It’s strange, being hugged by himself. It would be easy for it to feel like an empty gesture, like giving yourself a pat on the back. But it feels full. Full of forgiveness for all the mistakes he’s made, and the ones he’s yet to make; full of acceptance of who he is, even if he can’t admit it yet; full of reassurance that there exists a future where he’s happy, safe, and loved.
Dean lead Sam inside. “I mean it’s not much,” Dean began explaining. “We haven’t finished unpacking and I know Cas wants to remodel the kitchen already, but-”
“They’re real,” Bobby says. “Let’s just say I know a guy who knows a guy. They’re the real thing. But they ain’t a charity, even if you find ‘em there ain’t no guarantee they’re gunna wanna help you with something this high risk.”
Dean pushes his laptop off of his lap and gets up to grab them - he’s always one to deal with these kind of things as soon as he can before mess can pile up.
The other three immediately started craning their necks, very obviously, to get a good look. There at the bar seeming to be ordering a pair of drinks was hunter, husband, and father; Dean Winchester.
The other angel, a woman with short black hair screws up her nose as she surveys Sam. “How in heaven could you not sense it? There is something… impure about him.” The angel gives a conceited scoff. “Castiel ought to have left you to rot.” She reaches down to pull Sam’s head back by the hair. Dean yells in protest but the male angel holds him back. The female angel bends down, her faces inches from Sam’s. “Didn’t you ever consider there was a reason we didn’t answer your prayers?”
Castiel, angel of the lord, had consulted with his new friend, the lovely librarian Sara, as to where the best places in town were to take a date. Sara, Cas had discovered, was quite the romantic, and luckily the two had very similar tastes. Everything she had suggested was lavish, classy, exquisite. Dean hadn’t met Sara, but he’d heard a lot about her. She’d convinced Cas to join the local library’s book club, she’d recommended Cas a whole bunch of romance novels that Cas would read late into the night, much to Dean’s irritation as he’d have to kick Cas out the bedroom if he refused to go to sleep, only to find him beaming the next morning, flitting about the kitchen making an elaborate breakfast and showering Dean with kisses all loved up from whatever he’d been reading.
The cold water snaps Dean back to normal function. He sputters and shakes head, “Ugh, what the hell?”
Dean’s face screws up. “It’s called being charitable. The guy has one set of clothes. You want him to walk around naked, perv?”
Castiel shrinks into his shoulders. He snatches the bottle from Dean and takes a lengthy sip. Dean gets the message.
want to. Then you got two choices,” Dean places a hand on Cas’ upper thigh. “Break the rules, or back out.”
“Pfft, you’re just pissed ‘cause if it weren’t for him, you think you’d be the hot badass everyone was obsessed with,” Jo mutters, taking a swig.
This time the load is much lighter since their now carrying most of it in their bellies. Sam says his goodbyes to Castiel, and hangs back while Dean does the same.
“Guess I better put some coffee on,” Dean says through a long, deep stretch. He rubs his back— he’s not 20 anymore and that couch is lumpy as all hell and he’s paying for that in full. “You want any?”
She purses her lips, but nods. “Yes. I don’t know how you’ve done it, but the blight has been purged completely from Sam’s body.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas sighs. And he is. He places two fingers over Dean’s forehead and his body drops, falling limp into Cas’ arms. He carries him over to the bed and lays him gently down.
“Well, I don’t think I’ll be getting out of here this time.” Cas stated, an attempt at reassurance for Meg, and a statement of acceptance for himself.
“Yo, Victor, I got something for you,” Jo calls as soon as she comes in. Dean, meanwhile, peels off over to Cas, not wanting to make too much of a meal over it.
It’s late when they finally stumble back into the bunker. Dean’s exhausted from driving non-stop and eager to collapse in his bed.
Castiel furrows his brow in thought. “I couldn’t say. There aren’t many cases of an advanced demonic blight being cured— angels aren’t typically forthcoming with their miracles as you know. I haven’t heard of it as a side effect, but there isn’t a great deal of recorded data, so it’s impossible to determine what is and isn’t ‘normal’ in a case like this.”
think, when one’s hands are busy working the mind is running through a routine. There’s something about the calming synchronised rhythm that the mind and body falls into, in a perfect harmony.
They go in and take a table. There’s a small food menu containing what is essentially overpriced and fancied-up bar food. Dean tries not to balk at the cost of their burger, which claims to be made of high-quality, locally sourced American beef. Dean points at the claim on the menu and says, “Just like me, am I right?”
‘Routine salt-n-burn’; it never fucking is, is it? Dean sits on one side of a diner booth opposite Castiel, head in his hands as he stews in his aches, pains and a general feeling of exhaustion. Fuck. He’s too old for this shit. Getting tossed halfway across a room hurts like a bitch when you’re 20, and it definitely ain’t any better nearly two decades and several broken, fractured, healed and re-healed bones later.
Dean nodded, eyes never drifting from Cas’s. They each pulled their hand away at the same time, eyes still locked, and broke into a soft laughter.
Castiel picks his discarded clothing off of the floor and reassembles himself. He readjusts his sword-belt, the silver hilt catching the cool blue moonlight streaking in through the gap in the curtains. Something else catches in the light, a glint of green, blue, purple— his feather at dean’s bedside, placed upon the small side table.
“We have a spell which will imitate a low-level demonic omen. It should be noticeable enough to attract the attention of the angel on duty, but not so large that they will call it in until they’ve carried out their own investigation. Once we have them where we want them, we will light the holy oil and trap the angel for questioning. From there we will likely have between three and six hours before the angel’s presence is missed, so once we have them, time will be of the essence,
the one still hunting. Dean wants to ask more questions, he wants to know everything that went down to lead to this unfathomable outcome, but he doesn’t. Somehow his own future self doesn’t quite seem as inviting to question as Cas does. He could tell when he spoke to his last night that Cas loves him, even if he’s not his Dean. But future Dean looks at him like he’s yesterday’s disappointment. He supposes that that’s exactly what he is.
He gets to it, wrapping his hands around it’s weathered gold bars for the first time. There’s a great weight to it, yet there’s an airy, ethereal feeling. He tugs— there’s a harsh clang. There’s barely an inch of give as the gate rattles in its lock.
“What are you talking about?” Dean asks, though his tone and his hardened facial expression indicate that the question is more or less rhetorical.
Cas chuckles. “I would like that. Although Dean, fruit and vegetables are an important aspect of a balanced diet.”
Another angel steps up to Castiel now, taking charge following their former leader’s demise. “By the order of the archangel Michael, I authorise the capture and detainment of the seraph Castiel, and the humans Sam and Dean Winchester. The detainees are to be transported to the citadel posthaste to face their retribution.”
In that moment as Cas had ordered them out, he’d felt something powerful from him, like a divine wrath. If he weren’t so het up he’d probably be impressed. Dean wants to listen in, but god knows if it’s the warding or just a damn good door, because he can’t hear a thing.
When Dean awakes it is not from a gentle rousing by the natural light of the sun. Instead, he is forced into vicious consciousness by Sam shoving at his side. As soon as he leaves the safety of slumber, dull dizzying pain spreads over his entire body, intensity peaking in his head and his stomach.
In his half-woken stupor, Dean reaches a hand out across the mattress, but no obstacle blocks his path; he is alone. All at once his blissful awakening turns sour as he’s wrought into consciousness with the sinking realisation that he’s been robbed of his chance to say goodbye.
Cas is biting his nails again, an uncouth habit he’d picked up in his first few months of semi-humanity, and managed to drop in the years since. Victor tries to psych up Dean and Jo in his stead, but in truth he’s just not as good at it. Victor is all business, for the most part. And when he’s not, he’s casual and jovial. He doesn’t quite nail earnest and sincere the way that Cas does.
Cas is silent for a moment, one of Dean’s plaid shirts draped over his right arm. “Hmm,” he hums in understanding. As Dean moves to replace all that they’d dragged out, Cas catches a glimpse of red on khaki. Without meaning to, he grabs Dean’s wrist to stop him. Realising himself he lets go, but he then goes to untangle the knot of fabric sprawled out on Dean’s bed. A bloody red handprint.
Dean takes in what Victor’s saying, but doesn’t comment. Victor goes on. “I don’t know much about his past beyond that, you know, no one does. He’s never given us a surname, we don’t even know if ‘Cas’ is his real name. But I’ve worked with the guy for a couple years now, and he’s one of the best soldiers and strategists I’ve ever seen. He’s been offered command positions about a hundred times but he never takes ‘em, says he’s ‘not made for leadership’, which I think is a load of crap, but hey, can’t force the guy, right? And he may not seem like it now, but he’s a cool guy once you get to know him.”
There are letters from Bobby, too. The messages are shorter, but he always signs off he same way, with a promise;
, he desperately wants to say, shaking Dean by the shoulders to make him understand. But it’s not just Dean he’s arguing against, it’s himself too. As much as he wants Dean to be safe, he also rather selfishly wants Dean to keep coming by anyway.
“I don’t know if I’d say you were a mess…” Sam walks back the moment. “You were just so unsure of yourself back then.”
Castiel reaches out to take the book as Dean offers it. “Thank you,” he says in that soft, earnest way of his. “I look forward to reading it.”
Victor’s face drops a little. “Yeah, yeah, I know,” he says. “He’s been, uh, off with you, I think. Don’t tell him I told you this, but he said to me that the guy he lost, the one he loved? He said you look like him, and it reminds him of what he lost. So, just be patient with him. He’ll come around.”
Dean nods slowly, biting his lip to stifle a chuckle. “Okay, yeah,” he concedes. “So what part of your duty is it to stand here flirting? Aren’t you supposed to kill me?”
Dean bites his lip and looks down at the sketch of the strange stone tablet. “So if we get both tablets, what? We seal away all the angels and demons and get our planet back?”
He tries again; water, detergent, scrub, rinse, repeat. The water runs clear, Castiel’s handprint remains distinct. Dean stares at it and it stares back. His fist balls up the fabric as he draws heavy breaths. His face feels hot as if some empty rage is just under the surface, but it bubbles up then simmers away into nothing.
“Depends. The fat adds juices, but you don’t want too much, and depends on what you’re making.” Dean huffs. “Sam’d want the leanest meat possible.” He replaces the fattier mince and throws the other in the cart. Looking away from the shelves he spots a lone guy shooting daggers at him and Cas from down the aisle.
Castiel hands the first book back to Dean. “I assume then, that you’ll also want this one back?” he asks, sporting a knowing smile.
Dean laughs. “Cas, I’m just teasing,” he says, offering his hand out again and letting Castiel, pouting all the while, lean into it. “‘Sides ’s kinda nice. They’re soft. You got feather conditioner or something?”
“We’re raising Jack together, we have a beautiful home together. I have everything I wanted; it’s more than I ever thought I would have. Maybe one day I’d like to try a nice restaurant in town, one with candles, and music, and a wine list,”
Cas sucks in a long breath, letting the proceeding exhale drag out and empty his lungs of all the tension held in his chest. “You’re right. And you know me; I’m always on top form.”
Victor follows close behind and says, “Cas,” in an exasperated tone. “Come on, man. You gotta meet our new people.”
“Well technically I had a shot with him. You know, before he moved to Florida.” Sara said, deflated. “I mean, library guy didn’t seem gay. Not that it matters anyway.”
“What have you done to me?” Castiel laments, slumping against the wall, his wings drooping from his slumped shoulders behind him.
It’s not enough. There it remains, the scarlet darkened to almost black under the weight of the waterlogged fabric. It’s embedded itself there, dug it’s claws in and scarred the material forever.
They get into the Impala, which Dean had already brought around front in preparation. Cas doesn’t try anything on the drive there, which is a little foreboding. He also doesn’t tell Dean where they’re going, only giving directions as they drive. Eventually Cas gives the last turn off and they pull into the parking lot of… a bar.
“Cas, it’s okay, you can do it, I forgive you,” Dean offers through a split lip. Castiel raises his bladed hand at the beginning of a strike, hand held high in view of the court. “Cas—”
Knowing all this, Dean was more than a little apprehensive about whatever Castiel had planned for the two of them. The last thing he wanted to do was put on a suit and tie, it would just remind him of being on a case more than anything. Not least since the only suit s he owned were his fake FBI suits. And he only had one left that didn’t have irremovable blood stains on it.
“I don’t think anybody deserves to die,” Castiel says, dropping his hand from Dean’s in what could almost constitute an accidental handshake. “You should go, please,” Castiel says, voice low and sincere in his final plea.
“I’m Jack,” Jack says, holding out a tiny hand to shake. Dean takes it and lets the kid shake it rather too energetically.
Dean runs the jacket’s shoulder under cold water. Taking a magic eraser he rubs, pressing hard into the fabric, any harder and it’d tear like tissue paper, instead it shifts and bunches under the pressure. There’s a pale, creamy red emulsion seeping out, soaking back in, pooling around his fingers. He runs it under the water again, letting the colour fade into the water, swirling down into the drain.
“I’m not— Why would you think I’m a test?” Dean asks, brows knitted together in confusion and worry, likely for Castiel’s sanity as he loses composure.
dreaming— of getting far away from this stupid spot, of dipping his toes into the cool water of the ocean just for fun, of gliding through the air in a controlled free fall, of walking through those woods with Dean, hand-in-hand and never looking back.
So he stares at the door, not sure which is the harder choice— to leave without word would crush Dean, he knows it would. He might worry, might chase after him. But to stay and put him in more danger is selfish, is
Dean, who up until now had been fervently avoiding eye-contact looks up at Cas to meet his gaze. There’s something in his eyes that makes him trust him, and makes him feel safe enough to say anything. He chalks it up to his angelic influence, like he makes you want to confess your sins or something.
Sam exhales and nods. Dean is stood opposite, he takes a few ragged breaths in anticipation. Sam steps up to him and places his hands on his brother’s shoulders.
It feels like eons since Castiel last stepped inside the city walls, separated from the world and from humanity. In reality it’s been just under fifty years, but watching that post since his demotion has felt like an eternity.
And then he sees them. Carried off by a pair of angels, blood-streaked but instantly recognisable by the iridescence against the inky black of the feathers.
Dean shrugs. “I dunno,” he says, nonchalant. The truth, of course, is that he’d been surveying the area for a few weeks before he’d made his first attempt, and he actually became quite well acquainted with these woods. Somehow Dean doubts Sam really wants to hear just how dedicated he really was to his somewhat suicidal scheme.
“No, I meant you. Lying in a dark room all night is exceedingly dull. I’m going to go to the library and read,” Cas says, turning to make his exit. “I’m sure you’ll survive the night alone. Goodnight, Dean.”
Cas just nods before taking the two shirts he’d grabbed to his room. When he emerges a few minutes later Dean’s already in the kitchen frying up some bacon and eggs. He turns to take a look when Cas comes in, dressed down in jeans and flannel, looking like the Winchesters’ weird adopted brother.
He will never see Dean again— the fact hangs heavy in his heart, but it’s okay. He’ll always have the birds and the bees, he thinks. The days pass by in a temperate late summer haze, the nights drift by, cool air under clear skies. As an angel, Castiel does not suffer from the cold, but in the dead of night, all alone, he feels a chill. It’s sharp and disconcerting, forcing Castiel to shrink into himself for feeble warmth.
in order to do it. However, mere minutes ago, he had concluded that in another, much deeper sense, no, he wasn’t.
“Ready?” Sam asks, holding a lit match over the bowl. Dean and Cas both nod, and Sam drops it in and begins chanting in a language Dean doesn’t recognise (yet). Cas’ eyes light up up and there’s a bright light casting huge black shadows of thick plumed wings behind him. Both Deans look on in awe as Castiel’s fully powered grace and his vast, unbroken wings are revealed for what will be the final time. Both Dean’s are glad for the chance to see it, the younger for the very first time, and the older for the very last.
Dean closes his eyes and swallows, accepting the answer he’d known had been lurking in the back of his mind for god knows how long. “Yeah,” he says. “I want that.”
Still, there’s an alternative motive to keep Sam housebound for a time; miraculous recoveries draw unwanted attention. It’s been no secret that Sam’s been sick,
The worst part of all of this? Being so small and so in the dark. If he had even an inkling of how he could fight back against the angels, he’d do it in a heartbeat. But even Castiel thought it futile.
Castiel eyes the now empty bottle of mystery booze. “I don’t know. Probably.” Castiel closes his eyes and rests his head against the cool stone. The moment his eyes close it feels as though the floor drops from under him and he’s spinning down into oblivion. He snaps his eyes back open and focusses on the trees ahead to anchor himself stationary. “Ah, that’s… something.”
“Maybe,” Tia conceded with an unbothered shrug. She seemed a little lost in her thoughts. “He looked so good with a little car grease on him though. I’d buy a calendar of that guy. You know, I would so objectify him.”
Cas then takes him by the shoulder and flips Dean on his back in a manoeuvre he’d demonstrated the other night. The difference this time is that he allows himself to kiss Dean softly, passionately, desperately.
Cas shores himself up and attempts to focus his mind solely on the task at hand. He calls over his compatriots and begins espousing strategy. “We’ve had a team covertly scouting this area for the last two weeks, and we’ve been able to identify the angel’s border patrolling schedule. Hastings is a relatively low value asset, so the angels are typically on solo patrol.”
I get caught, right? It’s not a sure thing. It’s my life, and I’m okay with taking the risk, I can handle myself.”
Cas tilts his head and squints at him. It’s piercing, like his glacial blue eyes are cutting into his soul. Intense. His older self just looks at him, frowning in confusion.
Bobby’s lips are pressed together and his eyes searching the room as if too look at anything that isn’t this, that isn’t the broken angel crying on his couch. “And Sam?” he asks, quiet.
“Yeah,” Dean muses, thoughtlessly. The woman shrugs and wanders off, leaving Dean to pay for his own drinks and carry them back to the table, not even really aware of what he’d just said.
“Eloquent,” Cas says, flat. “I think,” he begins slowly, a sly smile curving his lip up on one side. “That you’re just uncomfortable with the idea of people thinking that you’re in a relationship with another man. Any man.”
He learns almost immediately, though hadn’t come to truly notice until a quiet day sitting in the yard watching the clouds drift overhead, that he can no longer hear the voices of his brothers and sisters.
“Then we need to leave,” Sam says, running a hand through his hair. “But we still don’t know where the hell we’re going.”
The feathers of his wings flare in irritation as Castiel marches forward to clasp a hand around the fabric of the man’s collar. He ignores the man’s startled yelp and drags him hard and fast out into the open. Castiel flings him forward into a heap at his feet. Like this the swagger and confidence he’d exhibited the day prior is gone. Instead Castiel can see this man’s insecurity and fear all over him, the man’s eyes unable to meet his.
Dean has wedged himself between Sam and the angel Azrael’s blade. “What the hell are you talking about— demons? We don’t fuck with demons!” Dean spits as Azrael presses forward, forcing Dean to inch back.
“You know I could show you how to make some more stuff sometime,” Dean sighs as the tension dissolves as if it were never there in the first place. “Better you learn from me than from Sam - gotta learn how to make
Cas hovers over Dean for another minute, their eyes locked in a searching gaze. He’s searching Cas’ eyes, his pupils are a little dilated, but then one could chalk that up to the low light. He’s desperately curious as to how far Cas will go, how far he really
“This is-” Dean began, closing his eyes and smiling, lost for words. “I can’t believe I get to do this with you.”
“I don’t have to die,” Castiel says, a paltry consolation. “There was an angel, one of my superiors, she successfully disappeared. If she could do it, maybe I could too.”
“Terrible, Garth. People died,” Dean says, flat. “And I need a shower and drink. Or a bang to the head— anything that’s gunna put me to sleep.”
In this Naomi reveals herself, her intention to hold up Castiel as an example made clear. To Naomi, Dean’s life it but a grain of sand on an endless beach, insignificant in the face of the larger whole, and in that he is disposable. Naomi wants Castiel to provide a spectacle, and he is inclined to oblige.
As Dean clambers under the blankets, he tries to understand how he’d just forgiven and then reassured a guy who he’d been ready to cuss out just a few minutes ago. It’s something in the eyes, Dean thinks as he drifts off, they’re just so… disarming.
Dean moves the angel’s shirt just enough to reveal a patch of clean skin. He opts for the upper torso, since the lower is a mess of blood. Dean swallows and has to psych himself up to start carving. As he moves through each line (the curving ones proving exceedingly difficult), Dean studies the man’s body. His wings are thickly plumed in brown feathers that look silky smooth, were they not dirtied by blood. The man’s arm sports a long, deep gash, his leg a messy puncture. There’s even a smear of blood on his neck. He didn’t go down easy. Unless he did— Dean thinks to Cas, unscathed aside from a split lip, an extra blade discarded off to the side.
Dean rolls the bottle between his hands, the cool condensation comforting. “Yeah, ‘bout that…” Dean starts nervously. “I, uh, was sorta trying to break into the citadel. Cas was the guard there, caught me sneaking around.”
Somehow, though, he’d done it. Of course, he’s yet to administer Castiel’s miracle cure, but in his anxious, sleep-deprived delirium he allows himself to believe. Either way, somehow he’d managed to convince an angel to help him. Though Castiel had seemed convinced that it was something Dean had done to him, Dean’s not foolish enough to realise that it was mostly dumb luck. He was simply lucky enough to encounter the one good angel, the only one with a conscience and some humanity and kind blue eyes and soft hands. He’s
“No it’s not,” Cas says, getting defensive. “Just because I’m interested in men, doesn’t mean I’m interested in
Cas is Dean’s guide, carrying half his drunken weight along to his bedroom. With Cas’ help he deposits himself onto his bed. He lays there on his bed, on his back staring at the ceiling, lamenting the one, two, three, maybe four rounds too many past the point of stability. He’s lucky he has Cas tonight to carry him home, he thinks. He should tell him that.
Dean frowns. “Okay,” he says, nodding slowly. The angel doesn’t move or stop watching him. “I haven’t seen anything. Is there anything else?”
Castiel tries to speak, but as soon as the words form they get stuck in his throat, his heartbeat racing and pushing him closer and closer to collapse.
“Dude, there’s nobody around. You can drop the pretence.” Dean takes a deep breath shuffles his feet as he repositions himself against his car.
The incongruity of this usually mild-mannered teen dropping the f-bomb draws a snort from Dean despite himself. “Fair enough. Though you could’ve just said some creepy dudes pretending to be feds were holding you hostage and made it our problem.”
Sam bumps his shoulder against Dean’s. “Yeah, I almost feel bad for saying it, but with any luck we won’t be seeing her again for a very long time.”
It wasn’t the very first thing he did when Cas showed up again two weeks after they defeated God, but it was pretty damn close. No, the
“Then stay. I mean if this is the last I’m gonna see of you for ‘quite some time’, we should make it count.”
“Okay.” He hears a poof through the phone and then the line goes dead, which tells him Alex is no longer next to him. He’s really getting tired of people ending conversations like that.
“Okay, I’m… gonna process that in the car ride over. Julie, Ray, would one of you mind making the introductions?”
Right now though, he just wants him to shut the fuck up, as is the standard response to siblings and their antics.
go with this information, they are places he can never allow himself to go, because once he goes there, he can never come back. Most of the time it’s too dangerous even to acknowledge their existence. But that doesn’t mean they’re not there.
“Guys,” Julie calls insistently. The brothers turn to see that the others have reconvened, Carrie nowhere to be found. They walk over to where the others are now seated.
“Okay #1) Gabriel faked his death again and is fuc—” Sam remembers the minors in the room at Ray’s disapproving scowl— “messing with us.”
“Okay, it’s one thing that you clearly care more about Julie’s career than your own daughter’s, but that’s fine I got that message loud and clear at the concert.”
“I’m sorry.” As Willie and Alex start fighting, Luke and Reggie make a run for Caleb. Rose quickly walks Julie through the spell, but not quickly enough. Reggie’s cry is only drowned out by Luke screaming his name. Reggie dissolves into nothing, prompting Luke to redouble his efforts to take Caleb down. Luke, however, is no match for Caleb on his own, and is soon dispatched as well. Dean struggles against his restraints in vain, watching the band dwindle before his eyes. Willie manages to subdue Alex but can’t bring himself to deal the final blow. Caleb takes the decision out of his hands.
“Oh, fantastic,” Dean huffs, looking around as if that would help him. “You think Caleb knows that trick?”
“You are not getting married in your… work suit,” his brother counters as he has every time the subject has come up. “As your best man, it is my duty to give you two the wedding of your dreams and that means you have to look the part, alright?” He claps his shoulder and nods to the tailor. “Stop fighting it, Dean, this is happening.”
“I have a better idea.” Caleb snaps his fingers and another ghost appears beside him for all to see.
“Which,” Dean points out, “I’m not entirely convinced is even possible, so lighting ‘em up is definitely still on the table.”
“See you’d think that,” Julien counters excitedly, “but it was like she was trying to find a popcorn kernel in my teeth.”
Sam turns to the at-this-point-probably-not-ghosts. “What else can you guys tell me about the room?”
Dean and Sam share a quick look of panic before trying to find a hiding spot. Julie opens the door and looks around, seeing nothing. “Do you guys see anything?” She waits for a response, then curses under her breath when she seems to get one. Out loud, she says, “you guys aren’t detectives, are you?”
Conversely, the boys are much more solid than they were before. They're not even playing music, just lounging around visible like it's no big deal. This case just keeps getting weirder...
Trevor takes her hands into his swallows. “I didn’t write most of my songs. Luke did. I just recorded them after they all died.”
Sam asks how he’s dealing with it over pie but he can’t go there. He says what needs to be said because it’s true; the best way to honor him is to keep living. Something deep within him begs him to tell Sam everything, now that it’s over, but he can’t, not yet. Probably not ever. He doesn’t even know how to begin talking about it, especially when it will inevitably raise questions he never had time to answer for himself let alone those whose opinions matter most to him. He looks over at Sam and knows his unbelievably amazing brother will give him all the time he needs. And anyway some things don’t need to be said.
Ray, meanwhile, has opened the piano and plunked one of the keys. Nothing happens. “Huh, well so much for that.”
The month the Winchesters lived in LA was one of the stranger periods of Dean and Sam’s childhood. Dean’s never been one for big cities, and California’s not exactly the cheapest place to live. Sam of course loved it, but Dean couldn’t wait until Dad finished up with whatever demon he was chasing in the vain hope it would lead to Yellow Eyes so they could get out of there. The only good thing about living there was the music scene, which gave Dean a much more active social life than he could usually manage. He really got a feel for some of the local acts (and a feel of some of the groupies in the bathroom), but the one that stuck with him the most was Sunset Curve.
Suddenly, three teenage boys poof into frame, complete with equipment. Dean is mildly impressed for about two seconds before his breath hitches. He can’t take his eyes off the drummer, a familiar face that has no business being in a 2020s hologram on a shaky YouTube feed looking not a day over 17. “No fucking way,” he whispered.
Ever defiant, Dean looks up at him harshly, but doesn’t hold his gaze long. All the signs Castiel has been ignoring come rushing back to him. This isn’t going to change with an apology, and they certainly can’t fix it by bringing Mary back, and nothing Cas says or does will ever make it right in Dean’s eyes. “My powers are failing and I’ve tried to talk to you, over and over, and you just don’t want to hear it.” A fact Dean confirms with a roll of his eyes. “You don’t care, I’m dead to you. You still blame me for Mary.”
Alex said his goodbyes while his friends gave Dean the shovel glare, and suddenly they were walking in the somehow always warm California air. Dean opened the door to his dad’s room, which was thankfully empty, but he could see Sam still awake in the other room. “Shit,” he whispered. “Stay here.” He moved into Sam’s line of sight and in his normal voice called, “Sammy, you still up?”
Dean pushes away the memory. “Nope.” He parks in front of the only tailor in Lebanon and cuts Baby’s engine. “But I didn’t expect to. If he shows, he shows. If not, well… he’s a busy kid.”
“Yeah, it was one of the first things I did after I left you guys. He’s been helping me redesign Heaven.”
“Jack’s dead,” he answers, unable to face the man who helped raise his own mom’s killer because Castiel brought the Nephilim into his life. “Chuck’s gone, you and Sam have each other.” And once again, Castiel is alone, weakened, and heartbroken. The stunning genius of the Shadow’s curse dawns on him; it knew Cas would never get to be happy, so he will have to live in his misery for all eternity and won’t be the Shadow’s problem for eons. He’s already lost.
He’s certain he misheard, hoping against hope that maybe, just maybe… but he knows in his heart he heard what he wanted to hear. Right? Not that it matters, the Empty’s coming whether Dean loves him back or not. And even if he did really say it, it suddenly occurs to Cas that he probably feels obligated to say that given that he’s about to die for him.
Caleb turns around in abject horror to find Rose and the boys looking very much alive—well, not dead—and smugly waving to him.
The pair walks to the nearby park in the mild warmth of fall in North Carolina. They’re comparing notes about their most recent liaisons, with Julien having just been on a date last night. “It was honestly the weirdest kiss I’ve ever experienced. Man, I don’t even know how to explain it. First of all she just kind of stood there like this.” He gets in front of Dean, arches his back with his neck straining as he pushes his face forward and puckers his lips. “Like what do you think this is, a rom-com?” Dean laughs and shakes his head, dutifully ignoring that Julien is still standing right in front of him. “So I kiss her and she does this thing with her tongue—”
He nods at Julie and the empty space beside her. They begin playing “My Name is Luke”, to Trevor’s instant mortification. His pallor only increases when the ghosts poof in and he’s confronted by their actual presence before him. After they’ve finished, Trevor turns to Carrie, who’s even more confused than she was before. “I don’t understand.”
It takes him a couple tries, but Dean eventually chokes out a “hey, Alex.” Sam looks up at that and takes it as his cue to move further off.
he means. They can move onto the important part, which is what this revelation has to do with their earlier fight.
“Dean,” Sam says too gently, as he has been ever since Dean told him the full story of what happened, “I know you don’t want to hear this right now, but—”
Sam looks to the ceiling for strength and spits out “they can’t be seen by ‘lifers’” complete with air-quotes, and a pang of nostalgia rips through him.
Of course, it’s not a name he’d ever dare say aloud, not yet anyway. But with this newfound clarity he can appreciate that Sam’s never seriously pressured him to label his thing with Cas, content to hold space for the difference between his own love for their best friend and the particularity of Dean’s relationship with the angel. He really does love that about Sam, how willing he’s been over the years to just roll with the admittedly obnoxious dynamic of him and Cas. And if the continued sting of Dean’s hesitation in the moment has taught him anything, it’s that he needs to start
Alex is quiet for several seconds, and for a moment Dean fears the ability to talk through the phone has passed. But then Alex says, distractedly. “I’ve never actually been here. It’s… it’s weird to see your name on a tombstone.”
“No, I don’t think I have, Dean, because it’s so blatantly true that it honestly scares me the mental gymnastics you go through to pretend you’re this super macho straighter-than-a-ruler alpha male instead of just owning it and moving on. Like, I’ve tried everything, I tried ragging on you like normal, I tried politely ignoring it, I tried dropping not-so-subtle hints that I was cool with it, I even tried forcing the issue a couple times, but every time I think we’re finally on the same page about it, you do or say something so bizarrely repressed that it’s like I’ve been living with a caricature of an action hero instead of an actual three-dimensional person.”
“Hey, I just got here myself, man. And for once I finally have all the time in the world. I’ll see him when we’re both good and ready.”
“Wait really?” Sam shakes the question out of his head and returns to his point. “Nevermind, I just meant in general. Despite everything, you’re still alive. For the first time in a long time, we have a whole life ahead of us. I just need you to promise me you’ll live it.”
The pair didn’t speak much for the first 30 minutes of the day; Cas knew Dean wasn’t a morning person. Rather they would both flit around out of each other’s way until Dean had had time to sit down with his morning coffee. Of course Cas knew exactly when this was, not just from the scent of freshly brewed coffee filling the air, but also because that’s when he’d finally greet Cas with a proper good morning.
Castiel raises his eyebrows, incredulous. “Alright then.” He draws his blade and holds it in his open palm. “Try this.” Castiel spins the blade in a choreographed movement, fluid and simple like it’s second nature. He hands Dean his blade, a marked display of trust which hardly seems to faze either party. “Your turn.”
Evening drops into night, fades to dawn then lifts it’s weary head into morning. All throughout Castiel stands at arms, watching over his charge; the north-north-western side gate. A slip of a thing leading out into the raw untampered brush of forest, seldom used.
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas replied, not taking his eyes off the boiling water he was pouring over a green teabag (which Dean almost made him spill). “When can we expect Sam to be over?”
He rushes out and through the streets and bangs on Missouri’s front door. She answers after a few moments, frowning and confused. “Dean, what’s wrong?” she asks, resting a hand on his arm. “Is it your brother?”
The older Dean frowns at his younger self as if he’d just dribbled on his shirt. “Are you- That’s not how that works in any universe.”
Cas’ hands slip away from Dean’s face and trail down to rest on his chest, thumbs just grazing his nipples. “The human body is very complex, and sensitive. There are lots of places there to explore if you have the time.”
Naomi’s irritation is short lived however, as her expression turns giddy behind the eyes. “The sixth charge if you please, Esme.”
“That’s gunna be a pretty long walk,” Dean remarks, checking in to make sure Castiel understands his very human limits.
Castiel’s face is hot. Flushing is a common human reaction to inebriation, so he’s sure it’s just that, and the way Dean is looking at him has nothing to do with why he wants to bury his face into his hands.
The flames grow quickly in the presence of the accelerant, and the robes burn easy. It takes only a few minutes for them to blacken, char, and shrink into ash. All the while Castiel watches, transfixed by the flames. He presses the closed lighter into his body, gripping it tight, feeling every scratch in the metal case.
Sam frowns and scoffs, affronted. “Asshole,” he remarks, shaking his head. “As if I needed your help to get dates.”
Jo shrugs. “Yeah, I guess. Nowhere near as good as you I bet. I bet you could show me a thing or two.” Jo laughs nervously and then sighs and waits expectantly for Cas’ response. He isn’t sure what to say to that though, so he just offers a closed-mouth smile.
It’s forever, and no time at all, when Castiel regains consciousness. He’s horizontal, and somewhere familiar. As he blinks himself awake he realises where he is; he’s lying on Bobby’s couch. There’s no one lying there with his this time though.
He could burn it. That could be cathartic in it’s own way, letting the fire consume it and watching it fade into ash like a ghost. He could throw it out, let it rot on a landfill, let the scavenging rats and birds bear witness for decades as it slowly returns to the earth. Fuck. No. This is something he has to do with his own hands; he needs to scrub it out.
“Good.” Dean nods for a second. He presses his lips together, then runs his tongue across them. Cas is embarrassed about having wanted him. Cas wanted him. He wanted Cas. Bad. Cas won’t look at him but he’s looking at Cas. He’s right there and for the first time, maybe ever, there’s absolutely no barrier between wanting Cas and having him.
Castiel is taken aback, expected to regale his tale of shame and failure as a heroic tale of adventure. “I had many disagreements with my superiors about their priorities. In battle there are often hard choices to be made, but I believe the right choice will always be the one that places the value of a life above the value of a victory.”
With that, Dean manages to convince Sam to take a little longer than he really needs to recover, to take it slow and ease back into every day life in a way that doesn’t draw too much suspicion. In the mean time, Dean keeps working, with a massive weight off his mind at least.
The journey through the woods is quiet after the one kill. Cas is thankful for that. Though it’s largely thanks to his and Victor’s diligent route planning, deriving paths that were the least likely to cross angelic patrol routes. Cas’ extensive understanding of the angels’ operation also assisted, and the angel they did encounter, Jonah, was actually a useful diagnostic tool in adapting one of the alternate routes. Though that hardly makes up for taking his life.
When they open it up, however, Dean is welcomed into what looks like some old WWII war room, complete with retro tech. They make their way down the iron steps and into the belly of the place. There are tables towards the back in a library section where he can see a guy who looks suspiciously like Sam already there waiting. This Sam has hair that’s way too long, and he looks older too. He looks like a grown-up, like he could tell Dean a thing or two. Nothing like the Sam he knows who still looks like a snot-nosed kid to him.
“I got enough for two, you want? There’s coffee too,” Dean offers, busying himself with his cooking.
“Maybe,” Sam sighs. “I really don’t know. That’s what you did, and that’s really what you wanted. You were tired, I think. Tired of fighting, tired of losing. Thing is, the most important thing to you has always been family. You were always the one trying so hard to keep us all together. For a long time family meant hunting. Then one day, family meant something else. So you stopped.
Sam crouches down and grabs Dean’s wrists, pulling his hands down and away from his face. “Okay, first of all you need to calm down,” Sam says, firm but gentle. “Take deep breaths, in and out—”
