He wanted to talk to Dean. Again. Wanted to be sure he and Cas were okay—body and soul. Wanted to be sure they were on the mend and Cas wasn’t going to abandon them for the east. Wanted to be sure they were healthy and their smoke alarms had fresh batteries and they’d locked their windows and doors. Wanted to be sure the car engines were safe and their carbon-monoxide detector was running. He knew it was compulsive-obsessive (because Sam did NOT have OCD, thank you) but he needed them to be safe. He needed to never have to hear about another loss for as long as he lived.
“No. If you and Dean get to share my mess, we share yours,” Sam had said, and smiled, shyly. “It’s good to see you, Cas.”
“Sam,” he said gently, trying to will kindness and acceptance into his face and voice, “could I speak with you?”
“Don’t talk about Sam.” Cas hadn’t meant it to sound like it did, but once it was out, he couldn’t regret it. He’d had enough of people targeting his family’s weaknesses.
Sam smiled. He thanked God Ash was the head in the halfway house. He was evangelical about recovery, and the physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing of his lodgers. “Just...been thinking about relapse.”
And, to Dean’s credit, he did try, at least every other day, to ask Cas how he was feeling. He’d been trying, so hard, since his recent vow of sobriety, to be more appreciative and supportive, but Cas knew his boyfriend’s emotions were already well beyond their limits, and he deftly hid his own fears and shifted the conversation back to Dean’s.
Cas moved his seat to flank the younger Winchester. “You’re still in the worst of the withdrawal,” he said gently. “I’m afraid that comes with a great deal of exhaustion and depression.”
Sam swallowed, glanced to his brother, than back to Ellen. “I know it’s weird, but...I’ve been drinking a lot of red Gatorade.”
Gabe greeted everyone: parking attendants, doormen, the super, the plumber, the head of the co-op board, the hot woman on the fifth floor, the Jewish grandma on the tenth floor, the old man with the dog on the sixth floor, three cleaning women from varied floors, and his neighbor, a Broadway producer who promised him backstage passes and gave him a rough, manly hug.
“Jerk,” Sam called. Dean flipped him off playfully and made his way down the hall. Sam stretched and settled back against the pillows with a yawn, reached for the bedside lamp, and realized that Cas was still standing there, staring. “You okay?”
. And then I’d come home and you’d be all emo about a goddamn oil spill off the coast of fuckistan and the kids that would go hungry and the friggin’ fish that would die. And I’d feel like an ass.”
“This’ll probably sting a lil,” he says as he pours disinfectant on the clean towel and dabs it on Castiel’s calf. And it does. Castiel breathes out hard through his clenched teeth and Dean casts a quick glance up at him. “You good?”
“Dude it’s awesome! I gotta meet your bro and have him give me the recipe for this pastry, it’s better than any of mine’s ever been.”
”Cas, come on man. It’ll be fun, I promise. Everybody will be there,” Dean pleaded with Castiel. “Listen, I know we said that we would stay at home and watch movies with Sammy and Kevin like we did last year and the year before, but this could be our last chance at celebrating New Year’s with our friends. This time next year everything will be different and maybe people won’t even come home for the holidays. Please?”
From Charlie’s instructions, Castiel knows that Elaiza has the capacity to learn things at an incredible speed, many times faster than any human being would ever be capable of. She did say that despite that, he still needs to be patient in the beginning and take things slow and show Elaiza the ropes as Charlie put it. Castiel considers what could constitute ‘showing her the ropes’ and decides that a logical starting point is to take Elaiza on a tour of the house, figuring that everything will be much easier for both of them if she knows where things are located and how to find her way around. He supposes that he doesn’t really need to show her the garage, she’s already seen it since that’s where she came to life and was powered up for the first time.
“Yeah. I think she’ll be our best shot at trying to figure out what’s going on here, since you know she’s a centuries old witch and there seems to be some kinda magic shit going on with this girly leash thingy.”
Castiel stares at his computer screen with bleary eyes, watching as the writing program’s cursor mockingly blink in and out of existence. He sighs and lifts his cup, hoping that there’s still tea in it. It isn’t. Castiel had woken up early with the tiniest sliver of an idea dancing around at the back of his head of how to continue on with the story in ‘
He turns towards the house. The curtain in the living room is moving. Elaiza had been standing in there, watching him have his conversation with Anna, no doubt hearing the whole thing. Castiel frowns at the thought.
“Ugh. Do you remember when she got upset at my wedding? Because apparently I had ‘the wrong kind of lace’ on my dress and since my hair was down instead of up I looked like ‘loose woman who could be bought at any street corner in a port town for no money at all’. My theory is that Great Aunt Naomi is bitter, and especially at weddings, because she is an old maid…” Anna stops almost in the middle of the word when she sees the way Castiel flinches. He can feel himself deflating, shoulders slumping.
They leave the shed and the sun is still brightly burning despite the afternoon marching on, making them squint as they walk back to the gate.
She strides up to him and takes his cell phone out of his hand. “You are not to use electronic devices in a wet room area, Castiel, it is far too dangerous. Do you understand me?”
Dean felt himself go red. His husband? He hadn’t really thought about the implications when he had booked the appointment and stated that it was for Castiel Winchester, but it wasn’t like Cas had a last name, so giving his own had seemed like the only option. Shaking himself out of his stupor, he got up and followed the nurse.
’. No pressure, Castiel, but it’s getting more and more difficult to come up with excuses about the delay.”
“I had to get away. She locked me in, and I had to get out, so I threw my biggest and heaviest book on the Tudors through a window, must’ve cut myself on a shard. And then I ran. I tried to get away. But she caught me. Dean,” he says and tries to wipe the water off his face as they finally round the corner. “I don’t know how we’ll get into the house. She locked the doors. And the windows.”
Late in the afternoon, coming back from a bathroom break, Castiel finds Elaiza by his computer. She’s reading over his ongoing work on the next book of ‘
Castiel tries to protest and follow Dean, but he stops when he realizes that Dean sits up to take off his shirt. He stares at the way Dean’s muscles move as he turns to throw the shirt on the floor, completely enthralled by all the exposed skin, trying to decide where he wants to touch first and what parts of Dean he wants to taste first.
“They do care,” Castiel insists, his voice sounding distant to his own ears. His leg throbs again. He shakes, flattened against the wall.
Dean sits down more comfortably in the grass. “I had a lot of them when I was a teenager and my parents died. My, uh, …friend Benny used to help me through them by having me breathe with him and feel his heartbeat. It used to calm me down so I figured it might work for you too.” He shrugs and his free hand comes up to rub at the back of his neck.
“He doesn’t seem like the type to do what?” Dean comes in through the garage door, carrying some kind of welding apparatus that must be heavy, because it makes the muscles in his arms strain beautifully against the sleeves of his company t-shirt.
“She’s broken, she’s broken, she’s broken” he says, and then realizing that the water’s hitting Dean as much as it hits himself, he adds “Dean, you’re getting wet.”
“Still,” Dean says and gets up. He pours more disinfectant on another part of the tea towel before he gently places it on Castiel’s cheekbone. Castiel closes his eyes as Dean uses his other hand to tilt Castiel’s head up, fingers soft against his face. It doesn’t sting as bad as the one on his leg. Castiel doesn’t feel much of it at all, he’s too distracted by the way Dean’s thumb rubs tiny circles on his left cheek. He stills and Castiel opens his eyes again, looking directly into Dean’s until Dean clears his throat and with a voice that’s a little rougher than it usually is, he says “So, the ones on your arms left then.”
“I felt the need to remind me of the names of King Alfred the Great’s brothers, I thought that maybe one of them could be a good inspiration for one of the new characters in ‘
“Good. The we agree that you will not run away again, Castiel?” She steps closer to him, head slightly tilted, a soft smile on her face and pale eyes unblinking.
“Goodbye Anna,” Castiel says into the empty air. He’s a bit disappointed. It’s been weeks since he last saw his sister and the boys, he was even looking forward to seeing Michael, but ultimately he understands why they had to cancel. He knows how important Michael’s relationship to his parents is to him and a stroke is definitely a family emergency and a good enough reason to fly to the other side of the country.
Instead, Castiel leads Elaiza in through the house’s main entrance and brings her around the rooms on the first floor. They walk into the library and he talks about the books there and they tour the living room, the formal sitting room and the conservatory, the dining room and the small rooms leading off it. They look around his office, the kitchen, and the utility areas. In the hallway he stops and points to Samandriel’s drawings, filling almost an entire wall, and he tells her about his family. Of his father Chuck Shurley, the mystery and horror writer, taking his young children along with him on unsuitable outings to peculiar old buildings and midnight excursions to dark cemeteries. Of his older brother Gabriel, who fell head over heels in love with Kali when she walked into his bakery one dreary Tuesday morning and his half year long pursuit of her before she finally relented and went out with him. Of his younger sister Anna and her military husband Michael and their young sons. All of them being depicted in Samandriel’s artworks.
“Hey look at this! Wow, my grandpa had a digging bar that looked exactly like this one! I used to help him in the garden breaking up roots and digging holes and stuff when my grandma wanted to plant new things. She loved her garden so much. I remember when I could lift grandpa’s digging bar for the first time, I felt so strong! Like I was Superman or something. It was when they were still alive so I must’ve been eight or nine or something, I couldn’t use it yet, only lift it. But man, what a feeling!”
Dean opens his eyes. “Come on Cas, wanna feel you too,” he pants and claws at Castiel’s boxers. When they’re finally pushed down to his thighs, Dean looks down the line of his body and says, “So gorgeous,” and leans up to capture Castiel’s lips again.
She’s nearer now. Castiel tries to smother a whimper, but he fears that she’ll have heard him. He can see the fence around his property, maybe a hundred feet away, but even if he did make it to the fence, he doesn’t think that he’d be able to climb over it with his leg. He turns back to the house hoping that he’ll manage to confuse her among the trees and the shrubs.
Half an hour later, they walked back into the waiting room, still hand in hand. The dentist had removed one of Cas’ teeth, fixed cavities in two others, and then thoroughly cleaned his teeth. Cas had gotten a new appointment in a couple of weeks to get a replacement tooth put in. Dean was really glad that he had brought several of their old fraudulent credit cards. This was going to be expensive, it wasn’t like you could get health insurance as a hunter.
He waits for several moments before withdrawing his hand, to examine the restraints. Cas can tell from his tone that, familiar with the paranormal or not, Dean has no idea what he’s up against, what he even can do.
Castiel swallows a few times, shakes his head, makes conscious efforts to calm his breathing into a more steady rhythm. “No. No, I’m all right.” He’s not all right. “Thank you. I—” He lifts his gaze up to look at Dean again. Maybe he really is the taking-care-of-literally-everyone type, or maybe it’s the plea in Castiel’s eyes, he can’t say, but something has Dean’s eyes reflecting deep concern.
Dean jumps at the feeling of a hand resting on his shoulder, eyes darting towards Charlie, sitting next to him. Takes a breath, lowers his head again. Her hand stays still, grounding him.
Silence. He can’t keep avoiding thinking about the elephant in the room – what, in the name of everything holy, is he going to do about… this? Cas. Emotions.
“It’s cool, you know,” Dean said. Cas flicked his eyes upwards to study the human’s, to understand what he meant. “Taking things slow,” Dean added. Which was endearing to Cas, knowing how quick Dean usually was to jump into action with his partners, but honestly starting to get frustrating. He didn’t know how to initiate anything beyond making out – and Dean, apparently, was suddenly too
Cas looks bewildered for what feels like an eternity; but then slowly leans down, cups Dean’s face with his hands. “You know, then,” he mutters, his eyes fluttering half-shut. “That defying Heaven wasn’t the only way I fell for you.” Dean half wants to point out what a big pile of
. I’ve done my homework — this library?” He gestures around them. “Doesn’t even exist, on paper, at least. Not a single record, not on any map. Nothing. I mean, I thought there was something off about — something — the first time I popped in... What I don’t understand is why you don’t just walk out the doors. And before you tell me you
“Just need information,” he says, voice strained. “I... I’m coming back for you, OK? I don’t just leave people behind. That’s not me. I just — don’t know enough. I need to hit the lore with Sammy, I need — I’ll be back for you.” His features are shifting from fierceness to uneasy sadness. “I’d never leave anyone like this if I could help it. I’m...”
. There is an even standing. It’s not an ideal way to spend the afternoon, but there are a million ways this could have unfolded that would have been less preferable.
,” he moans. “If you need me to touch you, tell... me... but if...” He’s too close himself to keep talking.
. But he can't find his voice, he can't... It's not that he doesn't want to communicate. He just struggles to have... control over his words. He spent a lifetime (it feels like at least) holding his tongue around Naomi. In fear of her hurting him, even if she never managed to properly make him
More importantly, there’s something off about the way the Entity keeps circling him, but not touching him.
It doesn’t feel familiar, the touch of the fabric tightening against his skin. This surprises Dean. He’s been restrained plenty, and he wouldn’t have thought it made a profound difference, the material. But it’s in Cas’s deliberate and gentle manners of wrapping the tie against Dean’s skin. It’s in the warmth of Cas’s skin against his, as he holds a wrist in place. And it’s in how Dean’s agreeing for this to be happening, probably; to think of it, he’s never not fought back, in situations like this, sans when he’s been unconscious. Even with a gun to his head, he knows the subtle ways of tensing his muscles so that there’s at least a chance of working his way free. Now? He keeps his arms relaxed, and the softness of the fabric and the gentleness of Cas’s hands direct his mind from the instinct of fight or flight. Cas is doing a commendable job, too, knowing his way around enough to effectively render Dean’s arms useless. He supposes he was the one who taught Cas things like that, years and years ago. He flexes his fingers, rolls his wrists about enough to both get a sense of being unable to free himself, and how no amount of straining actually as much as slightly scrapes his skin. Instinctively, he checks if he can find the ends of the tie, for a chance of loosen the knots on his own, despite knowing he doesn’t need to be doing that.
Cas arches his neck. “I… see why you like it,” he replies, his breath coming as shallow huffs. “Dean...”
it can feel like. And even if it’s usually Castiel having Dean falling on his knees with a single word and a raise of an eyebrow, they have reversed their roles at times, so it’s not a new idea, aside from the wings being present.
Dean briefly bites his lip, his gaze wandering towards Cas’s wings before returning to the ocean blue eyes. “You liked the angel proof rope the last time,” he says, hesitating, not wanting to go too far. “I know I’m not as intricate with ropes as you can be, but... I could try. I could... Maybe I could make you see what I see when I look at your wings. Make them beautiful, even in your eyes. Maybe it’s pointless, I don’t want to have you feel like I’m hiding them again if I fold them with bindings, I...”
“Dean. The eyes...” Opening them briefly as Dean pulled away. They studied each other for a while, then the human nodded, and Cas closed his eyes again before nodding back at him.
Right now, though, with Cas fixing his gaze on Dean, his presence on the bed is less comforting, more... well, he’s
Fuck, he’s just going to have to say it. Cas is in full-on protective mode, not seeing the full picture.
He runs a finger over dusty book spines, carefully pulls out a thin fantasy. He goes for comfort, with this one. A new world, with little to no conflict, with familial warmth. He likes to imagine there’s something bigger than him guiding his choices, but he has no illusions of it being more than self defense, an attempt to make his own fate a bit more bearable.
“Good,” Dean replies, going in for another kiss as he works the belt, undresses Cas, waiting for him to step out of his trousers before going for his underwear. Dean cups him with his hand as he slides the garment off, dropping kisses down his abdomen, gaining more confidence at Cas hardening against his palm, even if just slightly, fights his socks off his feet along with the underwear, rendering him completely naked while Dean himself remains fully dressed.
“OK, we’re being serious,” the human offered. “You wanna let go of my chin? No? OK, uh...” He shifted, a tiny wriggle, closer to Cas if anything, rather than away from him. “We could experiment? You know, figure out – what you like. Where you like to be touched.”
Sometime during hour four, Castiel gave up and tiptoed closer to the reading area to find Dean still there, reading. Usually, they are dead by the end of hour three. It’s closing on five and a half hours, and Dean is nearing the last pages of the novel. Castiel is starting to wish he wasn’t reading so slowly, doesn’t know if that’s just who he is as a reader, or if it’s the library’s effect on him, making him study each paragraph closely. Fact still remains that
A thorn or a sharp little twig buries itself in his sock clad foot and he needs to stop to dig it out, angered over the interruption, it’s costing him valuable time. She will gain on him. At least his leg isn’t throbbing as much anymore, hopefully the cut from the window glass has stopped bleeding. It wouldn’t do to leave bloody footprints for her to find. She’s going to find him anyway. She will scan the entire area around the house until she finds him.
“Was here this morning, wanted to return that book I borrowed,” Dean says as they slowly start to make their way around the house. “And also, I wanted to see you,” he adds with a side glance at Castiel. “But it told me that you weren’t home. Out runnin’ or something. It said that I had to leave, wouldn’t let me in even though I said that I was fine with waiting for you ‘til you got back. It said again that I had to go so I did. But I don’t know, it kept nagging at me. Cylon over there was acting so weird so I ended up calling Charlie.”
“Anna, how many times do I have to tell you that it’s not a robot? My CompAnIon makes lifelike androids powered by the newest technology and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. And I’ve already had the first consultation, they’re coming here tomorrow afternoon to start the construction.”
“Nopes, lil bro. Shan’t do that, won’t do that. I’m just trying to help, to give you two a final little push. All that pining is starting to get on my nerves. On all our nerves, I think. It was fun in the beginning but now it’s just tedious and in fact a bit pathetic, so I figured it was time to do something about it. Hey, why don’t you see the ribbon as a different kind of profound bond!”
“Yeah yeah. I do not need another rehash of your stories about people you’ve experienced, thank you very much. And secondly, maybe.”
“Good,” Dean says. The smile has left his eyes and been replaced with a darker glint, he looks down at Castiel’s lips and he licks his own. “Cas, please tell me that this is okay,” he mumbles as he leans closer.
“Thank you, Charlie. I inherited it from a great uncle who made money in early computer developing. And please, call me Castiel.”
“I see. You do it because it brings your endocrine system to release a surge of dopamine and serotonin into your nervous system.”
“What are you thinking about, Dean?” Jack had moved into the front seat of the Impala, Miracle on his lap, so that Sam and Eileen could sit next to each other in the back.
“Are you certain that you do not wish to have a type of tea containing caffeine? You generally prefer the caffeinated varieties when you are endeavoring to write.”
“Yeah, I think so,” Charlie nods. “Otherwise we know where you live,” she winks at him and then sighs. “Oh Castiel, I’m really gonna miss you!” She throws her arms around his neck. He’s surprised and it takes him a moment to put his arms around her, it’s been a long time since he’s hugged anyone outside his family, and even that doesn’t happen very often.
“Do not be scared of me, Castiel, I am programmed to take care of you. To love you.” She walks closer to him and lifts her hand as if to caress his cheek. “You have nothing to fear, Castiel. Nothing at all. I only want what is good for you.” Suddenly, Castiel thinks that her raised hand looks more like it’s about to strike him over the head. He backs away a final step until his back is pressed against the garden shed’s rough wooden wall. She keeps moving towards him.
“What you said was errors, weren’t errors at all. I put those there on purpose. The characters speak like that to show personality or a character quirk, or that something’s happening or they’re feeling something, and as for the grammar, if you know the rules well enough, then you can break them. They’re not really rules, more like guidelines. Sort of like the pirate code.”
Castiel then brings Elaiza upstairs, where they tour the bedrooms and the bathrooms. As Castiel opens the door to his own sage green bedroom, butterflies move with a soft fluttering in his stomach when he remembers what Charlie had said about the possibility of having sex with companion androids. He hasn’t slept with anyone since April. When they stand in front of his big bed with its wooden frame, he jumps at a sudden touch to his shoulder.
“Aha! See, that wasn’t so complicated. Problem solv…”  Dean swallows the second half of the word as the ribbon swiftly heals itself and he is yet again bound to Cas. “What the hell just happened? Did you see that?”
“No!” He shakes his head, unable to tear his eyes from her approaching figure. “It’s not right! You keep me locked up, isolating me, keeping me from my family and friends. It’s wrong.”
“Come in” came the deep response. Dean opened the door and stepped inside. Cas sat on his bed, a book in his hand.
When they got to the party, the street was filled with parked cars and the music streamed out of the open door as people entered the house. They walked into the kitchen and found Victor distributing drinks to those who’d just arrived.
“Not that much. Something about the fact that even though I have weird hobbies, at least my being an author meant that one of his kids had followed in his footsteps and that was a merit to me. And then Great Aunt Naomi said ‘Well you writers are always a bit peculiar’ and she walked away to go to nag on Cousin Lucifer instead.”
Castiel can feel his cheeks burn hot from her words. He could see how an android could be considered like a person and that people might develop feelings for them. But having intimate relations, sex, with the android standing still lifeless in front of him? He hadn’t even thought about it. He tries to will the heat from his face and neck.
“Would you look at that. Sometimes there really is a nice bit of fire in you, Shurley. Good for you, kiddo! Speaking of fire, and therefore dragons and other such nonsense, how’s that draft coming along? You got something for me soon? Anything at all?”
“You don’t have to deny it. I’ve... I’ve seen you eat and drink these past few days.” Dean tried to will his blushing away, now was really not the time to think about Cas’ neck again.
She’s right behind him, having gained on him quicker than he thought but she will never have to struggle for air and her feet will never hurt. She’s caught up with Castiel. He’s trapped. There’s no escape. He takes a shuddering breath and turns around.
“Yes, there are still soft drinks in the refrigerator. You may have one later, but first I will follow you to the shed.”
“Yes, thank you,” he closes the book with more force than he usually does. “Now, Elaiza how is that tea coming along?”
The preparation of breakfast takes time. Castiel’s feet are somewhat sore from his sock clad escape attempt, they’re mostly okay, but he suspects that it’ll take a while before the desire to run and put pressure on the soles of his feet is back.
“My CompAnIon.” There’s a clickety noise coming through from Balthazar’s end as he most likely is pulling up their website on his computer.
“That’s not necessary. Why don’t you go inside, I’ll be right there. Oh, you know what I’d like now? A soda. That’d be really nice, I think that there’s some left in the fridge.”
“H-hey Castiel. Charlie and I just arrived. We got in fine through the gate using the code you gave us yesterday. Well, I mean, obviously, since, um you know, we’re here now and I’m talking to you…” Dean’s face scrunches together and he tilts it down to the gravel before he casts a look back up at Castiel. “Charlie is waiting by the car. We couldn’t get into the garage, so she sent me to uh fetch you and see if you could let us in?” His eyes dart to Castiel and away to the daffodils in one of the flower beds and then back to Castiel.
Right as he started to fear that he would be stuck here forever, doomed to walk in the dark of the Empty for the rest of eternity, he sensed something different. It wasn’t like he could see anything, or hear anything, but everything just seemed a little bit less… compact. He picked up his speed. When the air around him went from pitch black to the deepest of grays, he started to run. He ran until he almost tripped over something on the ground. No, not something. Someone.
“So anyway, despite all that, I still think that one of the most interesting dragons is the Teju Jagua. It’s maybe not a dragon-dragon, but it kinda falls under that category if I understand it correctly. My friend told me about it, and I don’t know, I just like the thought of a lizard with a bunch of dog heads that can shoot fire from the eyes and lives in caves and eats fruit and protects treasures. It’s cool with a type of dragon that’s a protector of fruit.”
Castiel turns the page of ‘The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’, and right now he’s getting to the part where Dr Lanyon learns about Mr Hyde’s true identity. The wicker chair creaks under him.
“No thank you, I’m quite content sitting here with my book. I haven’t read it since college, so I thought it was time for a reread.”
“Hey Winchester! Good to see you man! Here,” Victor handed Dean a beer. “Novak, you want a beer too? Or a soda? Got plenty of both, and some stronger stuff too.”
, he thinks as he digs the trowel deeper into the hole he prepares for the Victoria plum tree sapling.
There’s a small swoop of nerves quivering in Castiel’s stomach as he hopes that Dean will take what he has to tell him well.
“Castiel you cannot be serious!” Anna says while carefully adjusting the way baby Inias is resting in her arms.
Castiel is almost overwhelmed by her quick stream of words and seemingly boundless energy, and it’s not getting any better when the mechanic finally steps out of the car and turns out to be an incredibly handsome man. When he steps closer and extends a hand to introduce himself, Castiel is met with green eyes and freckles. Up close, he is even more handsome, and until this moment, Castiel has never seen anyone so beautiful with his own eyes. In fact, he wasn’t even aware that people could look like that in real life, and now he is starting to suspect that the beautiful people of Hollywood and the catwalks are perhaps as beautiful as they seem in the pictures in the magazines April had pretended not to like. He tries to remind himself that it’s impolite to stare, and he supposes that this man, Dean, has his fair share of people gawking at him and is probably sick and tired of it. Instead he asks them if they want coffee, and when they both accept his offer, he turns around and leads them into the house.
“Bye Cassie. Good luck with your blacksmith slash mechanic! Do remember to give me all the sordid details!”
“Yeah well, not to be that person, but no they couldn’t because I wanted to drive them home,” Dean shoots back and leans across the table to steal Charlie’s coffee cup.
As he watches them drive away, talking and laughing in the car, the longing in him is flaring up again. There’s still a small twinkle of hope in his chest. Tomorrow, a computer programmer and a mechanic from My CompAnIon will come, and with them comes the next step in easing his constant loneliness when they start working on his own android companion. Castiel can’t wait.
of us!” Sam seemed to be working himself into a near-frenzy. Dean’s voice, softened, broke in, but Sam rolled over it. “But it’s the same thing! You’re only looking out for me, not for you!”
Cas and Missouri sit silently as the brothers stare at each other. They’re not needed. Cas is beginning to wonder if they ever were.
“I need pants, a working leg, my own couch with my own TV, and a shitload of barbecue. Until then I’ll settle for not being molested by your evangelical-sober-hillbilly-house-leader.”
“I don’t think you do. My family...isn’t a model of stability, as you know, but growing up, I was always told never to let anyone lay a hand on me, and if they did, to report it. I admire your sacrifice and devotion to Sam, but no one had a right to hurt you. You were a child, and I know you’d never hurt a child.”
in the Emergency Room.” He left out the part where Dean had nearly given him a black eye for trying to touch him.
Dean’s breath hitched a bit. “If I’d explained myself better, maybe this could have been avoided. I know...I can get defensive. Of Sam. Sometimes I...lose sight of everything else. Every
“Amen,” she murmured, squeezing his hand, hard. He looked into her damp eyes and knew he wasn’t he first to admit such things, wouldn’t be the last; and she’d take his shame to her grave. And maybe he wouldn’t be up for group or meals or even meds, but he felt, for the first time, that she’d truly understand.
he’s talking like none of it was his fault. So I said, ‘we’re not here to conduct an exorcism, bro. This wasn’t some Linda Blair shit.
“A good physician will always be studying, learning, and willing to admit they were wrong if evidence provides further advancement.”
“What’s wrong?” Cas sighed. Between the two of them, his name had been screamed more in the past two days than it had been in his lifetime.
“Dean, I swear, I’m not using or drinking or anything. You can check with Alan, they tested this week.”
It had been a long time coming: Jay and Anna had been extremely kind and accommodating, but there was only so far they could stretch their small staffs.
Cas squeezed his bicep. “Dean...I haven’t heard from my father in almost three years. The only brother that still speaks to me is Gabriel. If I were to fall ill...” Dean reached down and gently pressed the hand on his stomach. “This isn’t what you wanted either. You wanted Sam to go to law school and get married. We both wanted a family free of arguments.
. If you really want to see us, we can set something up, with professionals, where we can work through some of this—”
For a few seconds, Ash, Andy, and Sam just sat, breathing hard. Then Sam reached out and picked up the gun.
“And I’m the Chief of Staff, ensuring that your kind and generous donations go directly toward the treatment and care of patients, one of whom is enroute and needs my immediate attention.”
“You can without guilt, kiddo. Though I admire your sacrifice to them, it’s their issues, not yours.” Gabriel took a long gulp of his beer and leaned across the counter. “Okay. Pretend this place is dark and smoky. Hank Williams is playing. You’re looking for a friend, and here comes Gabe, the best damn bartender on Earth. C’mon and lay it on me, I’ve heard it all.”
“Well this is a safe ride.” Andy tossed the stick in the back and reached for another out of the industrial-size bag of Dum Dums nestled between him and the passenger seat. “Sure you don’t want one?”
“They’re going to take care of her,” he soothed. “They’ll treat her with respect and dignity and prep her to be taken to a funeral home.” Sam didn’t need to hear about the cold of a morgue, the bags she’d be zippered in to, the gurneys she’d be shoved around on. Sam didn’t need his expertise: he needed his reassurance. “She’s safe, Sam. Nothing bad will happen to her, I promise. You can come home with us, now. She’d want
"Trust me," Dean murmured at times when Cas despaired, "Sammy'll learn to love you. He's just over-protective. Sorry to say I'm the same."
Sam temporarily moved back home with them their guestroom: a move which Cas was eternally grateful for. No sooner was Dean propped up on the couch that it became his throne, and he ruled over the downstairs with a series of endlessly unnecessary demands.
Sam’s face dropped abruptly into a version of Dean’s patent poker face. “Just...stuff I figured he’d remember. From when we were kids.”
“They always assume they’re wiser, and, hopefully, they are. The key is to remember where they stand in history.”
Andy’s Dad was standing by reception, looking close to tears. “My son...” was all he could manage to the on-duty nurse.
Cas turned the keyboard back toward him and took the phone in his hand. “I’ll call your brother,” he said.
“Thank you, Alan,” Cas said, at the same time a voice bellowed from down the hall, “Dr. Al! Bring it in, bro!” Alan gave a long-suffering sigh.
“I didn’t say goodbye. I never said—I have to—to—” Sam’s breath went from light anxiety to official, full-on hyperventilating. Ellen looked wide-eyed and shaky at Cas, but, for the first time since this mess had begun, Cas knew exactly what to do.
“I need sleep, a beer, and a good long lay. Not necessarily in that order, and not necessarily all while sitting next to my kid brother.”
he?” Gabriel crossed his arms. “Look...I’m the first to say ‘stick it to the Man,’ but I’m not about a free-for-all. Unless it’s at a bar and I’m in the middle of the free,” he winked. “But if Dean hadn’t knocked that sonofabitch out? He’d still be doing this shit. And it’s
The store opened at 9:30. Sam had just booted up the computer and was putting in a few special orders that had come in by e-mail when Ruby arrived, looking sweaty, pale, and downright
“I could use a Gatorade,” he admitted. And Cas would have worked a dozen back-to-back shifts and paid for hundreds of bottles of that awful, fake fruit punch if it meant that the Winchesters could keep smiling.
“Hey, Dean—don’t worry, you did good. We’re out, we’re safe. They’re letting me stay the night. They fixed you up and no one’s the wiser. Jim’s on his way, he’ll cover for us. I’ll wait right here.”
Dean shut his eyes, pulling his brother closer. "Don't say that, Sammy. It was a freak accident. Not your fault. Not anyone's fault. She went right to sleep. Didn't feel anything."
Sam shook his aching, spinning head. “Huh?” Crowley sighed and made a gesture toward his waistband. Sam jerked backwards. “No! I don’t—never!”
“Hop in. Wait ‘till you see where I’ve got us lunching. Don’t get me wrong—your life out there is charming as can be. But back here? We’re Morgans, and we’re gonna live like them.”
to felling him. There were second, third, and fourth rounds of lust, sure—but not the nerves, the slight blush, and the amazingly gentlemanly behavior he’d just demonstrated.
He shuddered and opened his eyes. Cas was holding him, as steady and calm as always, rubbing his stomach in warm circles.
Dean’s jaw jumped. His eyes dampened slightly, but his voice was steady when he said “I’m picking you up after your shift. You call me on your break.” And then he turned and gave a small, but sincere, smile. “It’s okay, Sammy. Everything’s going to be okay. I’m not mad you. We’ll talk, and relax, this weekend. Okay? Don’t worry.”
want to see another non-compliance notice on my desk with your name on it, you hear me? You get your ass where it’s gotta be, when it’s gotta be there.”
It was wrong that he’d failed to nurture his own independent friendship with Sam, and wrong that he remembered it only when they feared for Dean. Sitting in there with his adopted brother, Cas vowed to do better by him. Dean would be in long therapy sessions, and Cas would schedule time for just the two of them, to ‘geek out,’ as Dean put it. It would do wonders for them both.
“Can it, bud. I mean it. I don’t always get an A on the brother report card either. But that doesn’t mean what Max did, or said, is justified. He could have killed you. And Ash and Andy. And you were all just trying to
Rachel had come to his house with wine and take-out. She’d taken his hand and told him she loved him, very much, but couldn’t marry him. And then, without a hint of judgment or bitterness, she’d met his eyes and said “I thought I was the problem for a long time. I thought I wasn’t exciting enough for you. But I’m not the problem, Cas. The only problem is that you’re not willing to accept what will really make you happy.”
Missouri had been quiet the whole time. When Sam finally took his eyes off the floor and looked at her, he was stunned to see she was close to tears.
Sam didn’t. He stood very still and practiced the breathing techniques Cas had taught him long ago, holding his air for longer than normal and slowly letting it out. While his rational mind told him that Andy’s wound hadn’t been life-threatening, his stupid nerves weren’t listening. His psyche was taking up its old chant of
miraculously, he’d been able to envision Sam in the car, sitting on the white leather bench seat by his side, healthy and happy, with his dumb hair and over-expressive eyes, and it was brighter than a green light on a pitch-black Midwest street.
. You could have been in an accident. You could have been shot or—or the electricity in your house could have gone and you could have burned. You could—could be going home and a truck—a truck will hit you. And—and I won’t, I won’t get to say goodbye. Dean—”
Back at Gabriel’s, Cas slumped in front of the television while Gabe grabbed a huge glass of water and slumped in front of the laptop. Cas wasn’t sure, at this point, what to do: should he call out Monday? Put in for leave? Resign? Talk frankly to Anna?
“Secretary of the Board. Gunning for President. Where he’s from, a very, very big deal, with deep pockets. Fine. But that doesn’t make you a doctor. And if you’re not a doctor, then don’t sit there and tell me how to treat the ill.” The elevator announced its arrival, and two of their colleagues passed them, nodding. Anna hit the button to the first floor. “Dean. What happened?”
“There’s no getting it all, Gabriel,” Cas sighed. “I can’t grasp it myself. I took Dean out for a great burger and ended up living with a vicious assailant and his brother, the drug-addicted
“Neither you, nor Sam, nor Peter, nor Gabriel are completely good and straight and honest,” Cas snapped. “But all of your are trying to be better. Peter has his faults, but I
“Please don’t go,” he sobbed, digging his hands hard into Dean’s back. “Don’t leave, please don’t leave me, Dean. I need you, I need you here...”
Cas did his best to throw himself into work. As long as he was staring at charts, talking with patients, reviewing nurse’s notes and medications, consulting with his fellow physicians, he could put the Winchesters out of his mind. But each and every time he passed Balthazar’s office, he felt a punch of conscious, remembering how distraught he was that his friend had not only been hurt, but was apparently not the man he thought he was.
“She’s beautiful. Tall, blonde, strong, smart, and going to be the District Attorney of New York City one day.”
, but Dean had been spoiled with happiness and the relaxed, easy affection he shared with Cas. He wanted to slide under the covers with his boyfriend and let go in the safety of the dark, share how bad Sam’s panic attack had rattled him, how worried he was for Sam’s increasingly unstable mental state, how he wasn’t sure what he was doing, or what he needed, other than Jess...and hell,
“Intervention, bro!” Ash called, causing Sam to jump and Dean to wake up glaring. “Sure you’ve been saintly, but there comes a time when a man needs a sleep and a shower as much as he needs to hear the Lord call him on to sobriety’s sober ship.”
“Tattle-taling bitch,” Dean grumbled, stuffing a cookie in his mouth as he exited the kitchen, Sam hot on his heels.
Family therapy was an integral part of Rosemount’s treatment. In addition, Sam was receiving loads of varied group therapies, individual therapy, psychiatric therapy, traditional medical treatment, career counseling, and the occasional “specialized” therapy, including art, music, dance—a favorite, Cas knew, of Dean to one day tease about, assuming Sam was well, and strong enough, to tease—drama, and exercise.
The man crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. “There aren’t more than ten of these made, and they’re not a toy. They’re a
“I get it. You don’t want to be sleeping with a drunk,” Dean snapped, in that maddening, self-hating way he had.
r what happens or how long it takes. Dumbest shit I ever heard,” he smiled, warmth and affection full in his voice. “Two weeks later, I’d busted us both out. Yeah, Dad could suck, but group homes were way worse. At least, together, we had a chance.”
Sam tried hard not to show how badly that hurt. “Max, one of the residents where I live, snapped and apparently attacked his parents. When he got home, Ash, the head of our house, was there, and saw the blood and the gun. He turned on him. I came home, Max turned on me. Andy always waits for me to wave, but I couldn’t. He followed me in. Max shot him.”
“Maybe he’s not recovered enough to have a lawyer. Maybe when he does he’ll get one and he’ll bargain.”
Cas slid into bed behind Dean, looping an arm around his waist and resting his chin on his shoulder. Dean lay on his back, eyes on the ceiling, breath even and relaxed. They lay in the dim light from the streetlamp, the tension of the day flowing out of them now that they were under the covers, side by side in their own bed.
“I would.” Cas slid his own hand tentatively on Dean’s back. “If it’s alright. I don’t want to intrude.”
Sam froze, staring at the barrel of the gun. For a second he was back in that filthy alley with Crowley, and, just like then, he was going to be damned before he’d let some selfish maniac take him out. He was through being a victim. He’d worked too damn
Cas had paused at a small, framed picture on a black end table: one where a ten year old Gabriel held a newborn Cas, beaming up at the camera while, behind him, Ralph, Lou, and Michael stood smiling as well.
“The downside of being a woman waiting for the bathroom is other women waiting the bathroom,” Jess sighed, sinking down in her seat.
“I took you through that a few times. I don’t remember you being scared.” Sam blushed. Dean reached over and pinched his cheek. “Awww, lil’ Sammy knew his big bro had him.”
, homesick. And not for New York. He wanted Dean yelling at a bad movie. He wanted Sam offering him a glass of bad punch. He wanted to go to breakfast in sweatpants. He wanted to go out for burgers and team up with Sam to make Dean eat his vegetables. He wanted to watch the panic in Sam's face fade when he reminded him to breathe, when he reassured him that he and Dean were safe and healthy and there to care for him. He wanted Dean to tell him to stop being a girl, and then curl his arm around his waist in a way that said he didn't actually mind as much.
“Of course,” Cas said, taken off guard. Afterall, he was a doctor who’d specialized in Emergency Medicine: he dealt with this type of injury all the time. Dean’s wound hadn’t been life-threatening, and that was all that mattered.
Cas closed his eyes, smiling and leaning back into his boyfriend’s chest. “You know what?” he murmured, dropping his voice.
“The hell we will,” Dean seethed, turning toward his Dad. “I don’t need you anymore, you bastard! I see you for what you are. You’re probably here for money, aren’t you?”
Sam began to tremble. His fumbled under his sleeves and started scratching at his scars. Dean launched out of his chair and grabbed his brother’s head in his hands.
“Thank you, Doctor Montgomery,” Cas said. He’d decided it would be helpful to refer to the doctor by his full title, thus showing he respected him as a colleague and wasn’t going to raise any feathers about Alan’s treatment plans for Sam.
Cas had thought he was prepared for it, but seeing the first-hand affects always destroyed his preparation and threatened to shatter his calm façade. Sam was pale and thin and shaking and damp-eyed and anything but the strong, calm, sharp young man he’d first met. Alan had told them he hadn’t been out of bed in two days, and it was clear from his dirty hair that he hadn’t been showering either. It lodged all potential comforting words in Cas aching throat to see someone who had once been so bright and smart and sharp be so weak and vulnerable.
“Of course you would,” Cas said with a grin. When he first met Dean, he wouldn’t have recognized the sarcasm: there were people he knew who
.” Andy shook Dean’s hand enthusiastically. “Turns out we’re allowed to do more stuff than they say in the brochures or whatever, but no one organizes it. I just got us our first Snack Out at Red Lobster. Some of the girls wanted Starbucks, but I overruled it. Back when I was using, I used to smoke this
“Don’t worry,” Sam assured, patting Dean’s arm. “They’ll be by now that you’re awake and your fever’s down.” His hand lingered a little too long before withdrawing: enough that Cas could see Sam’s fingers were shaking.
Any other time in his life that he’d been sick, or scared, or lonely, or hurting, Dean had been there. Sam hadn’t even had to ask him to be. He just
“Took my life savings, but all I wanted was a Golden Retriever. A beautiful Golden Retriever I was going to name Andy. Had a whole budget for his shots and grooming and training. I told everyone, I’m getting a dog. They said I wasn’t ready, but I knew I was. So I got the money, had a few drinks and a few joints to steal my nerves, and called the Spencer breeding kennel. Only in my relaxed and altered state, I inadvertently reached the Spence-Chapin adoption agency, and it turned out there was a sale on this rugrat, who’d just turned five, and happened to be named Andy, and the next thing I know, he’s in my house. Least he could use the toilet,” he huffed.
of Dean, of his tongue tasting of whiskey and smoke, the cords of muscle in his back and arms and stomach and chest and legs. Sometimes it felt like they were pushing one another, wrestling for dominance, too accustomed to women to yield their practiced roles. Other times, Dean would touch his cheek or temple with a soothing reverence, smile at him sweetly, and let Cas explore at his leisure.
“Idjit,” Bobby mumbled, and Dean winked at him in the mirror. Whatever had passed between them, Bobby certainly looked far less grim, and Dean seemed to enjoy the new-found attention. “Where’s your Sasquatch-size kid brother at?”
“I can patch him in!” Dean barked. “Just because I’m not one of you college kids doesn’t mean I’m a moron. Hold on.”
He sighed, washed his hands for no reason, and braced himself for the rest of the evening. Stepped out of the restroom and came face to face with Jessica.
“Jess, you said you’d watch him for me!” Dean whined, tugging Cas into the booth beside him and keeping a light hand on his lower back.
“I get what you’re trying to do, but it’s not going to help if you ace this semester and lose all your teeth.”
“Dean and I would go with you, if you like. Or just you and Dean. However you’d feel best. You wouldn’t have to talk about anything you wouldn’t want to. It would be your time to use anyway you see fit. And it would just be an additional support for you now. Someone outside the situation who may be able to offer all three of us some ways to cope.”
“Me neither,” Dean sighed, so full he could puke, just like the good ol’ days. “I remember you were terrified of llamas, clowns, and the fake cow that moved its head.”
Cas' own heart nearly broke. He couldn’t imagine what his boyfriend feels. Dean stroked his brother's hair gently.
, Dean! You would be hurting and weak and scared and you’d try and tell me it was nothing! You’d make me hide upstairs and listen and wonder if you were ever coming back! And then, even when he was gone, you started going out with people who would hurt you—you’d drink like it was nothing, like
“We’re damn fine,” Dean declared. Then swore. “I’m on the—not with—yeah, well, I don’t take lunch, so—damnit! The bald asshat is making me go! Cas, sign me off—yeah, I mean
More swearing and the phone faded out. “Hey, Cas,” Jake said, “I’m gonna sign off, okay? We should be there in ten or so.”
When he got back with their food Sam was standing, calm and respectful, hands resting on Dean’s bedrail while Anna made some notes on a chart.
to love you back. And maybe Cas was crazy and stupid for doing so. But Dean wouldn’t trade his doctor, or his brother, for anyone or anything. Even all the peace on earth.
Dean didn’t believe him. Cas didn’t either, but he was willing to let it go. He loved both men, but wasn’t accustomed to their rhythm of burying some things and openly pursuing, sometimes relentlessly, others.
He clung to Dean like he was a quarter of his own age, like Dean’s sole job was to hug and comfort him. Dean was so
family. So Sam got the milk, Cas arranged Dean’s meal on the serving plates, and the three sat down to trade stories of their weekends and make plans for their day.
And then, out of the blue, Sam shot upright, eyes widening, the monkey crushed beneath his elbows. “Is Dean coming back?” he asked.
“Shhh,” Dean soothes, pressing Sam’s head against his thigh and smoothing his hair. “I know, buddy. Don’t worry.”
Cas had been too out of it to answer. But for all he couldn’t remember, he would always treasure Sam’s broad hands on his head and shoulder, his leg beneath his head, holding him like he was his very own brother.
Sam met his brother’s gaze, and the boys had one of those intense conversations with their eyes before Sam nodded and accepted Alan’s arm.
“From what I understand, many elder communities allow spouses to live on separate floors.” Sam could
“You get your ass there too,” he snapped. Cas had known him long enough to understand the need underlying his harsh tone. “And tell them they’re not sawing the damn thing off.”
“Dude, every time you tell that story you add another brother,” Dean griped. “I can’t keep them all straight.”
Cas had fallen asleep in Dean’s bed and slept better than he’d ever slept in his own. He woke warm and relaxed and refreshed, and to the sound of voices downstairs. He stretched, got to his feet, opened the door and found he could hear every word from the top of the steps.
“What is this?” Sam asked, shoving half a dozen wrappers off the seat and onto the floor of Andy’s van.
Dean dropped his arm around him and pulled him close. “I won’t leave you. We’re gonna figure this out buddy. I promise.”
. Okay? I promise, I'll be out of your way this time. I don't have any more bombs to drop. It can just be you and Dean and whatever level of me you're comfortable with. Oh…and check Gabe’s smoke detectors. I bet he doesn’t test them reguarly. And watch your wallet and stuff. I hope you're not taking the subways. And—” the message cut off.
“Sorry, man, I gotta...” Dean waved at the porch and took off after his brother, calling for him to hold up. Sam seemed to curl in on himself, looking as though he was about to start crying. Dean took a step forward, and did the last thing Cas expected: he brought his arms around his taller brother, cupped a hand at the back of his neck, and guided Sam's head down onto his own shoulder, pulling him tight with his free arm. The younger Winchester clutched his elder brother, fisting his shirt in his hands, and hanging tight, as if it were the most normal thing on Earth to be held by his big brother, despite their ages.
Dean glanced at him, sighed, and kicked lightly at the fence. “Look, man. I know what you guys think. But I didn’t go in there, guns blazing, without considering other options or the consequences. I did. And I knew there was one way that sonofabtich would see justice, and it wasn’t through a lawyer. Not for us, Sam.” He turned and met his brother’s gaze. “I will say this every day for the rest of my life if that’s what you need, but
He was shaking, sweating, sneezing. His pulse was racing so fast he could feel himself struggling for breath, and his stomach muscles were cramping so hard he couldn’t straighten out. He’d fallen asleep—or, to put it accurately, passed out—in a patch of grass beside a Church that handed out free meals in the afternoons.
Cas didn’t like to think he was one to eavesdrop. When he’d padded down the hall, it was only to say goodnight. Nothing more. He’d hesitated because the Winchesters were clearly in an active discussion. That was all.
“Anyway...I’m sorry to do this to you, but there was only one high-schooler on the pumps, and Jay was on a break, and when he gets back and sees that mess—”
Dean started awake. Cas was pressed close to him, a warm hand on his stomach, breath soft on his ear.
“I’m having some difficulty reconciling what you did with who I thought you were,” he finally said. Dean’s green eyes cut sharply his way.
“No!” Max wailed, and Sam pulled back just enough to punch him in the jaw. “It’s not f—” Max rasped, and then Sam hit him again, just like Dean had shown him, and the boy was out.
bought—or hugs—they could give each other those, minus the therapy bills—or books he got with his employee discount. This time last year, he’d been at Rosemount: two months into his treatment, and up and mobile, but still wretchedly depressed, especially since Cas and Dean had spent Christmas day on the ward, bringing him laundry and books and magazines and rubbing his back when he cried because he had nothing to give them.
“Don’t worry. Now go back to the table. And Cas? This conversation never happened,” she said with a wink.
him! I have my own home where the lights don’t go out and the hot water is always there and I don’t have to hunt for change on the street. I have a damn
he needed to push. He needed to stretch the limits of his comfort zone. Sure, he and Dean had been as passionate as they’d been in the beginning, this morning, but that didn’t erase the wake of destruction left by McCloud, or the fact that Cas had spent his life struggling to understand the emotional needs of those around him. If he was going to make it, going to truly join the Winchester family in their habit of patching together emotional strays and loving them as their own, he had to start facing down the emotional and psychological challenges they fought and conquered.
“Lou said you looked like you had Down syndrome until you were six months old. You kind of did.” Gabe took a gulp of Cas’ wine, made a face, plunked the glass down, and shuffled around until he came up with a beer. “But then you got all chubby and cute.”
Cas tied, and then retied, and then gave up and united, his tie. He yanked out another one, fiddled with it, decided he hated patterns, and tossed it aside. Dean appeared in the mirror behind him, dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, and the necklace he never removed.
Sam smiled at that and sipped the coffee once more. Cas sipped his own, and looked at the sterile, white tile.
“Don’t worry,” Sam said gently. “I talked to Anna’s assistant—she said the surgery’s going great. Dean’s tough, you’ll see. He’ll bounce back.”
He may be shy, but Dean certainly wasn’t. The next thing Cas knew he was half-tossed backward onto the bed, Dean over him, pinning his hands over his head.
Dean had given a horribly uncomfortable pause after Cas had explained that he’d found a great place to eat, but there was a giant, well known bar attached.
Sam hadn’t had those lessons. And he was trying his best to do what he’d believed Dean had always done. And Dean loved him for it, the same way he always ended up loving everything that stupid, overgrown kid was, mistakes and all.
Sam’s breath hitched. There, in the glass case, was a black, Chevy Impala, exactly like Dena’s. White leather interior, sleek black hood, sharp silver accents and all. Sam couldn’t believed how close such a small replicate could be. He could almost swing open the door and step in, curl on her leather benches and feel Dean’s hand on his head.
“I’m fine, Sam,” Cas assured him, smiling. It stung a bit, but he didn’t want either of the Winchesters to fuss anymore than they had. When Dean had finished roughing up his father he’d be painfully apologetic and gentle helping him to his feet and barking at Sam to get ice.
“Sorry—I had a message from the hospital,” Cas lied, hoping it was convincing. “I needed to call back.”
“So Gabe calls to tell me this, and then, in the background, I hear a female voice start shouting--she was there the whole time. Needless to say, he had to go immediately." Cas smiled. “Are you feeling any better?”
Sam would have joined in their banter, but he settled for smiling. Truth be told, he wasn’t anxious, or depressed, or even sad. He just felt tired. And a bit dazed. Max hadn’t been one of his good friends—he’d always thought he was kind of weird—but he’d been in the halfway house the entire time Sam had lived there. He’d been to their Superbowl party. He’d been to all the events Andy organized. He was just...
“Yeah. I mean...I’ve been wanting to slug the shit out of him for awhile. Felt kinda good.” He’d grinned sadly, and kissed Cas quickly before Sam came racing back in with Tylenol and bandages.
much. He’s been everything to me, for so many years. And when I watched him start dating, at first it was fine, because it wasn’t serious. But then...it got...” he swallowed, hard. “You’re different. Better. You’ve—” he wavered. “You...I want you and Dean to be okay. You’re good for each other. You don’t...you don’t...have to look out for me.”
It turned Cas’ stomach to think of. Just like he couldn’t reconcile this brutal side of Dean with the man who stayed up all night, comforting his grieving younger brother, or made Cas eggs and toast and coffee in the morning, or brought him and Sam ginger ale and saltines and oatmeal when they’d managed to catch the same stomach bug on the same weekend, he couldn’t reconcile the young man who’d stood in the kitchen, with the wide and hopeful eyes and the plate of homemade dinner, with the nasty, lying, manipulative addict who’d stolen from his wallet, drank his way through their stash of booze, and degraded himself before a cruel, conniving dealer.
The young man was quiet. When he finally looked at her, his eyes were filled with tears. “Please...don’t ever,
"Brother, I do. Guess who just ordered a double-stuffed burriot and four margaritas to go? Give you a hint: she's on a show that starts with Sex and ends with City. Who's this?"
The house was quiet: too quiet. Dean always made noise: he banged drawers and cabinets and dishes and shouted perpetual conversations, whether anyone listened or not. And when Sam was there, the boys went at full throttle, poking and teasing and laughing and arguing and hugging when they were saying goodbye.
It was true. He’d done all those things before, although under different circumstances. Because Dean was Dean and Sam was Sam and, to them, while it may not be alright for one another, they’d bear it for themselves. Which was probably one of their biggest problems. And one of the reasons they loved Cas—he accepted their willingness to sacrifice themselves for one another, and even admired it. Others had looked on their relationship as unhealthy and co-dependent and a million other things, but Cas understood how wide the world could seem with no one to care for you, and joined them without judgment or question.
. Temperature, vitals, everything. And I’ll be here, the whole time, to alert the staff, and you, of any potential change.”
“Shutup and listen to me, Sam.” Dean took a deep breath. “I’m no shrink, but you’re not up to par yet. You’ve been leaning on me more than you used to. But that’s what I’m here for. You carried me for years, you need to let me carry you now. It’ll be your turn again. But don’t you dare let anyone—Cas, Ash, Alan, Missouri—tell you you can’t come to me. It took us
Dean smiled. Cas smiled. It had been weeks--nearly seven, counting the last day Sam had seen them before fleeing to street, to right now--since they'd smiled, the three of them, at the same time. Cas to Dean to Sam to Dean to Cas to Sam. Maybe it was weird. Maybe he was still screwed up. Maybe they all were. But they were brothers, somehow. They were family. And when Alan released his arm and let him go toward them, he knew there'd be a day they'd reap its rewards.
emo’ songs and cards and general, silly thoughts suddenly seemed not-so-silly. He was lighter, brighter, drifting about the ward with beaming grins, hoping someone would say
“Fine.” He didn’t mean to be short, he told himself. He cared, he did. He was just...just... “Why are you here?” he realized.
Cas opened his mouth to answer and found he couldn’t. Because it wasn’t just all he wanted: it was all
Ash usually left the front door unlocked when he was home during the day, which was most of the time. He was a techie who did a lot of free lance research for security firms—something Sam could never quite understand, given his redneck appearance and eccentric persona—and prided himself in being available to those he took in. He stepped over the threshold, dropped his backpack, and turned toward the front window when he heard a shout from the back of the house. He hesitated before making his way slowly toward the kitchen.
(”I’ve been basically married to you for five years, you ass, so unless you want to break up with me, deal with it,” Cas had finally said, and that had been that. And then, his features growing less stern, that stupid, beautiful, endearing, loving smile taking over, “Dean, I love you — could you stop trying to make me stop for five seconds and trust me?”)
“And I’m grateful that you return, every single one of those days.” Cas’s brow knits, his expression gentle. He’s not distressed. He wouldn’t blame Dean, if he bailed out, one of these days. As terrifying as the thought of being so utterly trapped, for who knew how many decades more, alone, is; with the library holding him in some sort of stasis, never once having needed sustenance, for all Cas knew it could be centuries, he doesn’t have it in him to feel bitter.
“Punch me in the face if this is an awful idea,” he breathes, opening his eyes to look at Cas’s. Waits for him to do the same. “But you’ve been stressed as hell ever since this,” he gestures towards his wings, “started, and... I could... if, if you think you’d like it. I could be in charge. For a change.”
Castiel squeezes Dean’s forearm gently for a long while, his brow still knitted, but not in guilt anymore, just… He just looks sad. Tired, even.

He still does not reply. Does not even look at Dean. Life’s gotten way too out of what he was used to for him to as much as consider ways of reacting.
And whatever his brain may have toyed around with, with improbable dreams — he’s certainly not expecting Dean Winchester.
His consent is all Dean needs – he hisses quietly as he touches his cock to lubricate it, breath stopping for a while as he angles himself against Cas’s hole, holding his partner’s legs from under his knees to support their position. He lets out a louder hiss as starts to push in, but his sounds are being drowned by Cas moaning. Slowly easing himself inside, Dean shudders, stops for a moment to just
It’s not even as if this wasn’t the plan all along, after saving Cas. To stop, before this job ends him. Yet somehow Dean has no idea what else there is. What else there can be.
in Dean’s head? All of it, all of him, even against the evening light filtering through the stained glass windows of the church, lighting Cas’s back rather than his front — all of it, all of him, is still bright and clear in Dean’s memories. He keeps
It registers in his brain that he’s in his bed, in his room at the bunker, but his concentration is on the blue eyes looking down at him.
“You meant it?” Cas manages, his voice strained, his hands pressing so roughly on Dean’s shoulders that he fears he might push him right through the mattress.
“Dean, how are you feeling?” Castiel asks, his hold turning more gentle now that Dean isn’t fighting, anymore, a frown forming on his features. “Your injuries are still healing, so I’m going to need you to stay in bed, but you’ll be all right in a few days.” There’s a hint of an ’and if you don’t do as I tell you, I
Dean looks at him with sad eyes, for a long eternity, before squeezing his arm, nodding, and walking towards the front of the library, leaving Cas alone in his trap, once more.
The chains around his form loosen up before intertwining with the atmosphere, there one second, gone the next.
Dean hummed against his skin; Cas could feel him smiling. Next moment his lips trailed kisses onto his face, starting from a brief one to his lips, moving onto the corner of his mouth, cheekbone, his eyelid. Which had him bite his lip, as memories he’d rather not explore right now, threatened to flood his mind.
” But he knows that isn’t how it works; Cas can’t read minds. It’s a mistake on the human’s end if a thought slips into a prayer. He’s panicking now, anyway, because
“You forget who’s in charge here,” Dean replies with a chuckle but complies to the extent of trailing kisses in between Castiel’s shoulder blades before withdrawing again.
Dean studies him, with care. “Are you sure?” he asks. “I don’t wanna make this worse. We do this, you gotta promise to safeword out the second anything gets uncomfortable, OK? And I mean
, and he’s not stupid; he knows he can’t, would know even if Cain and Charlie hadn’t given him a lecture about it. But it’s
He swallows hard, faltering for a while under Cas’s gaze. What he had in mind was a handjob or something. But he isn’t going to say no to this, either. No. Definitely not.
He doesn’t sound that surprised, though, and maybe it makes sense to him as easily as Dean pieced it together in his mind. Whatever the case, Dean appreciates the way Cas is taking it: not making a big deal of it, certainly not acting as if there’s anything to be ashamed of. Which Dean realises he was dreading a little, in retrospect; he’s not used to,even after all their years together, having a
Dean heaves a long sigh, runs his hands down Cas’s chest. “OK. Enough with the mirrors,” he says. “Colour on the ropes? And... everything?”
touch Cas, here and now, he wants to do this as carefully as he can, too. Wants to do this for Cas. So he takes his time, before finally moving back to admire the sight in front of him.
Cas lets out a hum, as if thinking about it carefully. “For now,” he starts, lips moving against Dean’s skin, “I’d very much want to stay like this, for a while. To hold you, just to hold you.”
He cocks his head as he turns to look at his angel again, delighting in the fact that he can most likely hear his every move, yet restrains himself from turning to look, doesn’t move a muscle, just

wings there for anyone to see, unable to keep his wounded parts hidden. If anyone gets that, it’s him. “Just let me...?” He pauses. “Please.”
Above all the uncertainty, above all the fear Cas’s mental state is giving Dean — he can breathe again after what feels like a lifetime.
Castiel has very little control over falling asleep. When the victims' stories need to be written, he dreams. And what little control he might muster over trying to force himself to stay awake, he has no control over what happens in his dreams. He’s merely a vessel, through whom the stories flow, adding up to the shelves of books in the library.
Dean pulls Castiel closer, gripping at his hair as he kisses him eagerly. Cas shifts under his touch, grumbles lowly into the kiss, almost in a whine as their hips collide. “I want to touch you,” he complains as they break apart to draw in air. Dean just grins.
“Yeah, I get it, Cas.” He tries to fish for a softer tone himself, as he opens his eyes. Best case scenario, he’s not even hexed. And if he is, it’s probably easier on them both if he’s restrained when shit starts going down. Cas can take care of himself, but Dean might still get them both hurt, and it’s not worth the risk.
All of the ones working under her are people Dean considers family. Charlie, though... Charlie is practically a sister to him. The one of them closest to his heart.
but seeing the Entity use Cas’s form like this… feels like an insult, a joke meant to personally offend him.
It’s unimaginable enough to have had a person walk out of the library unaffected; but to have him return — Castiel’s dusty corner of a universe is turning upside down.
What started with tenderness and soft touches transitions into haste and eagerness; it’s evident in the way Cas keeps sighing, in his silent way of not-quite-moaning Dean’s grown accustomed to, that he might be discovering something new about his own tastes here as well. His caresses turn a little rougher, their kisses more sloppy. Pants get fumbled off, in Dean’s case causing slight trouble due to him being trapped on the chair, and though that would seem like the easiest part, Cas leaves them at his ankles, not pulling them all off, and for some reason that just adds to everything else, leaving Dean more helpless and more wanting.
He startles as he feels Cas shiver, hand shooting away from the feathers in a rush, but when he sees the look on Castiel’s face, he relaxes. Cas’s eyes are cast down, only open a crack, his features free of any of the tension that was there a few seconds ago. He looks as if... as if Dean’s touch feels
He thinks it has been decades since he last felt the sunlight caress his skin, rather than just see it from the brief crack of the library’s doors, whenever someone enters.
would ever be again. He might have had this life for less than a decade, but they had been the most important years of his life. It was a blink of an eye for an angel, but the emotional impact was what made that time matter more than any of his history before meeting Dean.
“Colour?” he breathes, barely getting the prompt worded as he straddles Castiel properly once again, fumbling the bottle of lube open.
Sam and Jack had been around, too, when the spell had taken effect and forced Castiel’s wings into their corporeal form; even if the first chance he had gotten to hide them with his coat, he had swiftly taken it. But the glimpses Dean had seen...
It’s not like it’s Dean’s fault. And Cas hopes he had enough freedom to move to wrap his arms around him.
”Make you?” Dean replied, sitting next to him, wrapping a casual arm around his waist. ”Could I even
“Think you could do that without, maybe, literally keeping your eyes on me? Like, I know you blink, but
Dean’s kisses stayed hesitant for a second, returning to Cas’s cheekbone, down towards his jaw line, chin. Cas holding onto him less tense, again, his arms wrapping around him. Dean raised his lips for a second before landing onto his earlobe, now comfortable once more, without wariness. Cas tilted his head to the side to give Dean better access, his hold of Dean now on his shoulder blades, pulling him closer.
His fingers adept, all-knowing on Dean, the sight of his other hand on himself, the fucking overflow of sensation and emotion pushes Dean over the edge fast, sending him into a freefall he can simply let happen, with the knowledge that he’s going to be caught. He’s floating, not tethered to earth the way he should be, vaguely aware of Cas following him a few moments after. And floating is fine, with Cas’s hands grounding him, holding him firmly.
’ in his tone. Also relief. There’s such relief in Cas’s tone, his features, that it makes Dean’s heart crack a little. How has he not seen all of this before?
“Right, sorry, the point being, might as well try with food you actually like. Meaning absolute junk.”
"This is my fault." Dean's words come so silently mumbled Cas has trouble making sense of them. "It's not like you'd have
“See, I told you. That I would believe you. Trust me, in my line of work, there’s not much that goes bump in the night that surprises me, anymore.”
, no, just… the bits of you entangled with your archangel buddy’s grace, being pulled here when he ended up here. Alas, you’re
It’s blasphemy, not against God, Dean doesn’t give two fucks about God today, not if... It’s unholy enough to force the most alive eyes Dean has ever laid his on, closed, and as if him needing to handle that hasn’t been terrible enough, now Castiel’s broken body is left before him like this; never mind that he’s here by coincidence, never mind that no one knows he uses the abandoned church as a hideaway, an escape from himself, all that matters is
, as he’s come to think of it in his head, despite himself. Just, the amount of time Cas spends in it, whether they’re having sex or holding each other or whether Cas is just kind of
But Cas isn’t satisfied that easily, he never is, and Dean can only really blame himself and his tendency to claim to be fine whenever he really, really is not fine at all.
“Mmm, I think...” Dean muttered right next to Cas’s ear, the sound of his voice making him tremble with pleasure. It was curious – he had never realised how much he liked hearing Dean’s voice. What the sound waves echoing in his ear could do to him, when spoken from a distance so short. The human chuckled softly. “I think that might be the loudest I’ve made you.” A pause. “So far.”
.” As if as an afterthought, he adds, gently, “If that means taking more sarcasm from you, I’ll tolerate it.”
His arm drapes around Castiel’s waist, fingers circling around his cock, and the quiet moan escaping Cas is enough to make Dean shudder as he bites his lip to suppress one of his own. He strokes Cas from base to head, slowly, a few times, before withdrawing his hand again. As an afterthought, he starts wrapping the rope around Cas’s forearms, up towards his elbows, binding them against one another. He hasn’t done bondage exactly like this before on Cas, but Cas has bound him this way more than once – and he’s testing waters to see if he’d like to be on the receiving end of that. “When you do this for me,” Dean mumbles, close to Cas’s ear, “not sure why, but it really gets me. There’s more... submission to it like this, isn’t there?” He trails his fingers down from the bound elbows, to his wrists. “You’re more completely bound than I’ve ever had you.”
“I just can’t think of anything else — I’ll hit the lore again, I’ll ask around, I will, I just... need more...” he trails off, glancing at Cas before covering his face with a tired hand. “I won’t give up on you.”
“Sorry about the ‘buddy’, man. You always hated that,” Dean mumbles as he searches for the page he was left off last night. He needs to get a damn bookmark. “Said it made it sound like you were being friendzoned. OK, here we go, love. See? I’m capable of being cheesy, as well. Well, you know better than that, Cas. People wouldn’t believe the romantic crap just being in the same room with you made me wanna do for you. You know,” he huffs a mournful laugh, “I’m not even gonna bitch about it. If...
Cas cranes his neck enough to look at him. “Dean,” he says, softly, “you explicitly told me you wanted to... make them beautiful. That is what this feels like, not like you are trying to hide them.”
Castiel stepped in and carefully placed himself onto the edge of Dean's bed. ”I just...” He shrugged. ”Missed company? Boredom is a luxury we can rarely afford but when we can... it's... you know.” He offered Dean another smile, which he returned with a tiny laugh.
"Dean. It's all right," Cas repeats in return, soothing, calm, steady. "It's all right, my love. This hurts you, as well. I'm not the only... You've gone through too much. You get to cry, too."
And only after he hears the library doors close softly behind Dean does he let himself open his eyes again, resting his head against the bookshelf behind him, more tired than ever during his time serving in the library.
“Dean—” The name leaves his heart a little too much like yet another prayer, with both desperation and yearning. For something better.
The sight of his angel huddled on the chair, his trench coat around his shoulders as a hiding place, head hanging low, is enough to have Dean's heart break. For a long moment, he fails to say a word, trying to form his thoughts into something that could be at least the slightest bit
The man stares back at him, for a few seconds, before bursting into laughter, stepping back from the counter, bending over. Castiel tilts his head slowly, observing the stranger. “What’s so funny?” In all honesty, the wholehearted way the man laughs is the most pure joy Castiel has seen in all of his decades trapped in the library. He doesn’t know whether it makes him happy or sad. Maybe both.
Dean studies him with his eyes, Castiel’s sadness reflecting from them. He has so much he wants to say – that nothing,
Cas breathes against his lips, whispers, “Green.” Doesn’t complain about Dean treating him like he might break; as Dean had when they first started playing with the idea of dominance and submission. How Castiel ended up being
“Cas...” He steps closer. Lifts his hand, lets it hover above Cas’s shoulder for a few seconds before resting his palm, gently, on top of the familiar fabric of the coat. He can feel the steady fall and rise of his breaths.
. But maybe if you had touched me… say, attacked me...” He shrugs, smiling. “Who knows, maybe I could’ve pulled you in, soul and all.”
Before Cas is able to stop himself, his hand searches for Dean’s, closing around his wrist, only to withdraw seconds later, instead of urging him to — resume their proximity? Tell him not to move farther away? Clinging onto the idea of someone being able to stop this cycle?
Cas finally turns to look at him, brow knitted, a question in his eyes before his expression softens into something terrifyingly
“Anytime, Cas.” Dean strokes Cas’s cheek with his fingers. “If it made you feel any... better, then I’m glad. If not, at least... no complaints about some hot sex?”
“I...” Dean’s turn to ponder on whether to complete a sentence, or leave it. He huffs a sigh, averting his eyes. “I am done. With the job. I am... done, Cas. No more. Charlie’s got us both covered for the rest of our lives, and I can still be of use for her, just... in other ways.” No more murder. “...After we— after one last...” And this is why he’s keeping his eyes averted. It’s not that it’s news to Cas, that Dean wants to be the one to kill Naomi, if Charlie ever tracks her down. But he doesn’t like it. And they both know that, as well.
Dean looks him up and down, attempts not to let him mimicking Cas’s form bother him, only half succeeding, even if his focus is elsewhere, his frown deep.
They both gasp for breath in unison. Dean's head snaps towards Cas in split second, Cas struggles to
Dean averts his eyes. “Are Sam and the kid…?” But he knows they’re all right; trusts Cas enough for him to have told him if anyone was in danger, or worse.
That’s not always enough, though — Dean should know. But he nods, either way. It’s better than nothing. It’s all they have.
“If you could handle the dungeon,” Cas now speaks over him, the first sign of his patience wearing thin, with a sense of finality, “I’m sure you can handle your own bedroom. Am I wrong?”
And then he’s right in Dean’s personal space, first feeling Dean’s forehead with the back of his hand, and then, and then, and this is when Dean loses any remaining hope of getting his cock under control, Cas puts his hand on Dean’s neck, his thumb slightly touching his throat while the rest of his fingers feel for Dean’s jugular. He’s practically holding Dean by his neck, taking his pulse.
But then there come the days when Cas is slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. When something, any stupid damn thing (the noise of a coffee mug resting against a table a little too loudly, the doorbell, the black wings of a bird fluttering past the window, the touch of his lover’s digits resting against his nape at the wrong time), sends his brain to overdrive. They learn, with time. Cas learns not to be ashamed of his triggers, Dean learns not to feel guilty of them. But it doesn’t make them OK, even so.
“But we can’t be sure,” Dean slurs. “‘s fine, Cas, it feels good.” It’s not been long enough to be perfectly in the clear, but instead of using that as an excuse, for once, he actually says what he wants: it just
doing it with a shirt again. And my wings...” He pauses. “Let my wings stay like this, for now, I don’t mind.”
“Yes,” Cas replies, his tears falling against the skin of the crook of Dean’s shoulder and neck. “You can stop fighting. Life’s not supposed to be a fight, and you’ve... fought long enough, for one.”
narrows his), “You don’t know...” His words are slow as he keeps studying Dean with his eyes. “My, my, my… You honestly don’t know.”
Dean bites his lip from across the table. He hums. “...Yeah. And you’d be stuck being the delivery boy. Wanna reconsider?”
“Were you watching me read?” There’s no accusation in Dean’s tone, just... a playfulness. Castiel blinks.
it brings tears to Cas's eyes, and he lets them flow, free. With them, his breath returns, and words, it's like his tears are forming his sentences for him.
Finding his determination again, Dean opens the doors, walking outside with his head held high, tugging Cas to follow him; and the moment Cas believes comes when he has to close his eyes at the sun caressing his skin, feeling both the warmth of the star the Earth is orbiting, and the warmth of Dean’s hand, tightly held in his own.
”Yeah. Did I wake you?” The corner of his mouth tugged into a small smile as he took his time to take in Dean's eyes – he'd never get tired of how expressive they were, how they were an ever so soft feature in his often so hardened demeanor. How they observed him. He'd never get tired of Dean looking at him.
He isn’t sure where the impulse comes from, but as he straightens himself up again, he doesn’t stop to think – just presses his lips against a tip of a feather, fingers holding it in place. Cas’s grip of his hand tightens at that, and Dean presses his body closer, feeling the both of their heartbeats between their chests.
“No, I...” Castiel replies, a slight frown flashing across his brow before disappearing as the corner of his lips tugs upwards, slightly. “I would like that.”
“No, no...” Dean tries to force himself on his feet but can’t manage. On all fours, fumbles for any sparkle of hope, terrified, repeating his denial over and over, unable to think, wanting to act instead, but unable to as much as get on his feet. He forces his eyes shut, trying to rid himself of the image before him, but it’s no use; everything is seared into his brain, permanently. And he can’t think properly, can’t find the words, can’t find coherence, but through his haze he knows — he won’t ever forget this.
Cas tugs against the rope, his breath heavy again. “Green.” He wriggles his hands, testing if he can break free, and Dean watches him take pleasure in knowing he
Castiel keeps his smile intact as he watches the man frown — at him, at himself, at the building. He can see his mind faltering.
Dean has no right to be the one breaking down. Not in front of Cas, at least. No. And the judgement he places on himself makes him break down completely.
“I’m sorry, man,” the guy wheezes, trying to catch his breath, straightening up, his eyes glinting even brighter at Castiel’s direction. He shakes his head, a full-on grin on his lips. “No, no, I meant — I meant lore. Mythology, anything. Not fiction.”
And he knows his arms are going to protest it later, knows people aren’t built to be tied up this long, but he just wants this moment to last longer. Cas helps him move in bed, and they stay there, snug against each other, for a long while, occasionally exchanging soft words, Cas rubbing Dean’s shoulders every now and then with promises of a proper massage when Dean can be safely unrestrained. The tie is gentle around his wrists, still, as if it were Cas’s hands holding him like that, safe.
He might be only an observer, but among what he observes, are his own hands, painting sceneries, painting others’ fates, whether he likes it or not.
He circles around Cas to tug the knots holding his arms loose, rubbing at his muscles while he unwraps them, and brings his hands in front of him with a single wrist still tied. Then works simple loops around the both his wrists to tie his hands in front of him. Playfully pushes him towards the bed. Helps him settle onto it before lifting his wrists at the headboard by the rope. “Colour?” he asks, meeting his eyes.
“Thought so. You know, I think my brother once told me that I invented the gonna-drive-you-away-with-insults when about to do something stupid. You can’t fool the master.”

,” his eyebrows raise, “I see enough to know that something’s keeping you here against your will. It’s nothing I’ve encountered before, but your body language pretty much screams you want out of here. So just... let me help you. Let me try. Just for the hell of it, Cas, because I’m pretty good at what I do; just let me at least try. All I’m asking from you is that you talk to me. Honestly. And I promise you, I will do everything in my power to get you out of this place. Now I’m not gonna ask you if we have a deal, because the last time we did that, you kinda bailed—”
“Don’t mind him—” Balthazar said quickly. “You see, where we’re from, we were equally as likely to be suckling whiskey-laced milk from our mothers’ teat as we were conditioned to stand at the first note of ‘God save the Queen.’ This wave of American sobriety is quite...New Agey to us.”
“I’ll get Sam. Where’s he at right now?” Bobby repeated, and Cas recognized his attempt to escape. Cas glanced at the clock.
“I can’t, Dean,” Sam’s face fell, and he moved to get back into bed. Dean instantly leaned over him and pinned the bedspread to the mattress so his younger brother couldn’t burrow under it.
they’d heard in months. The younger Winchester’s head emerged from under his sweatshirt to glare at Dean. “I was cold.”
“If you’re copping out,” Dean said coldly, “you leave a godamn check for your half of the mortgage this month.”
Just like then, there wasn’t much Cas could do, but rub Sam’s back and let Dean whisper away. And, when Sam’s sobs finally died out, and Dean was quiet, petting his brother, lids dropping closed, he sat close to them both, keeping watch, ready to wake them if their troubles plagued their dreams.
“You quit that, right now,” Missouri snapped. “You did something few people I’ve seen did—you came here completely of your own accord. No court-orders, no professional interventions, no pending lawsuits or divorces or custody-battles. You’ve owned all your own mistakes, and from what I’ve heard, you’ve been nothing but supportive and forgiving to everyone around you. So you’re not gonna turn around and decide you deserve anything different, and you’re not gonna curl up on a third-rate mattress and give up on yourself. You hearin’ me?”
“You’re very much into this, aren’t you?” Cas observes, hands sliding down to Dean’s neck, caressing him. Dean arches his neck as a response, moving in tune with Cas’s touch, feeling his own heartbeat against the tips of his beloved's fingers.
“I promise.” There’s enough confidence in his tone that Dean believes him. And Cas maybe understands the need to be absolutely honest about this better than Dean feared he would, having usually been on the dominant side of these dynamics.
Charlie stays quiet for so long Dean gives up hope on getting an answer. Not as if she would know anyway.
“Coming back for me, I know,” Cas repeats, locking his eyes with Dean’s. “Look, just... I think we have established by now that I am incapable of making you change your mind, so... just don’t... risk letting anyone else enter this place, OK? I’ll wait.” Not that he has much of a choice, but that’s not the point. “I trust you to come back, I’ll be all right.” Strangely, he’s not simply reassuring Dean; he does trust the man, maybe because he’s ready to cling onto any display of care and kindness, but maybe... because there’s something more to it than just that.
A stranger who has, for some incomprehensible reason, shown him more kindness than anyone — ever, as far as Cas can remember.
Dean flicks his eyes towards his angel again. Cas stares back at him in absolute shock, his eyes wide, his entire form frozen. What…
“Yes. Apologies — it has been a long day.” His tone is flat, hoarse from not having said a word in... too long. “How can I help you?”
, if...” Dean interrupts himself, shakes his head. “I know you know to do that. All right, trusting you, now.”
Dean finds himself unable to handle the prolonged eye-contact but a fraction of his normal tolerance (one builds that up, living with Cas), and shifts the little he can in his chair. Clears his throat. Fixes his gaze somewhere between the wallpaper and empty space.
All he can do, though, is to try to make the guy’s last moments as comfortable as he can. Still, distracting people with kindness and not getting attached is a hard equation to solve.
And as trained as Cain and Alex are in medical care, none of them know too much about... psychiatric care.
Cas shakes his head again. No, he wouldn’t. Even if he would, there’s nothing anyone can do — and strangely, what maybe is confusing him the most about Dean, is not that he claims he’d believe him.
Gentle, firm arms pull Dean onto the carpet on the floor along them. Cas settles them into a comfortable cocoon, grabbing throw pillows and blankets from the easy chairs at arm’s reach. Lips rest against Dean’s forehead.
He let his hand hover over the scarring for a moment before landing his touch there, light and gentle. He could feel Dean shiver, and he took a hold of the human’s waist again, settling himself on his back onto the bed, pulling Dean on top of him.
Cas, up on the cross, even as he grips his hair, on his knees, still on the unforgiving floor of the church, pulls onto his hair violently to force the image away, only it refuses to leave. He keeps seeing Cas, even though Charlie and Cain and Jody and Bobby are all there, and the cross is bare, save for the blood, Cain carrying the broken body of Dean’s everything towards safety, someone’s hand on Dean’s shoulder, he thinks Charlie’s, maybe, but all he can do is keep wailing, as he shoves her away. They’re making him walk out, too, and he only goes with them to be able to stay with Cas.
“Look at you,” Dean mumbles, “you are absolutely beautiful.” His own eyes escape to see the reflection of Cas’s wings.
“Good,” Cas murmurs, and the way he runs his hand through Dean’s hair as he says it makes it feel like praise, almost.
him?! And the unthinkable: he’s dead. He’s dead, once more, and doesn’t need Charlie or anyone, anymore, and he must have cried out, because Charlie is hurriedly updating him, and Cas, Cas is still alive, still breathing.
Dean gives up trying to hide it; a blissful moment he’s consumed by an impromptu fantasy where he still has his hands tied behind his back, with that fucking tie, but he’s naked, and Cas is choking him, gently enough so he can breathe easy, but firmly enough Dean knows
The relief on Cas’s expression fades and is replaced by desperation. “I was against that. We knew you’d likely survive it, but risking your life like that-”
“I know. I tend to have that effect on people,” Dean jokes. He walks over to Castiel, offering the novel back to him with a wink. “For what it’s worth, I don’t remember ever enjoying sitting down with a book, like this. Guess you’re good at your job. Cas, was it?”
Dean feels as if he was melting into Castiel, slowly thrusts in and out, and if the moans Cas is releasing mean anything, the feeling is mutual. Dean instinctively hovers a hand over Cas, but stops his movement before touching his cock – just... not to tease, not really; but just to
“All right, Dean. Just make yourself comfortable.” Castiel turns to grab a gentle hold of his shoulders as they reach the reading area, guiding him to sit down on the comfiest chair. “I’d offer you a cup of tea, but I’ve unfortunately run out. Sit tight and I’ll at least find you the novel I had in mind.”

Dean knows what he’s getting at. Their relationship is healthy enough that he gets it, how they’re probably supposed to take their time talking through it, establishing limits, safe words, whatever, sure, he gets it - but he just wants Cas; yes, because he’s turned on, but he also
How does one love without touch? It’s new, delicious, maddening, being rendered unable to do nothing but stare as Cas steps back to unbutton his shirt, to do nothing but take in every touch he’s given, unable to give in return. It’s a real test on the durability of Cas’s tie; Dean keeps straining against it, tugging, every failed attempt at escape going directly to his cock, which is now also very much straining against the fabric of his jeans. The tie doesn’t relent, doesn’t loosen, doesn’t even tighten, just persistently stays a gentle yet firm constant, much like its owner has done the past decade. It takes Cas circling his fingers around one of Dean’s wrists for him to relax his hands.
He takes a longer length of rope. His eyes observing Cas’s wings, from shoulder blade to tip, trying to decide which direction to go with this. “Cas, you sure that me folding your wings won’t make it feel like…
Not because of what happened — what they thought happened — six months ago; no, all of them are dead, on paper. Charlie’s made sure of that.
having that argument now; if you want to kiss me, just kiss me, if you don’t want to, just don’t, and we’ll pretend this never happened, I was archangel-weapon delirious.
Cas could hear Dean getting up from his bed and make his way to the closed door. Next moment it opened, green eyes studying him from the crack of the door. ”Hey, Cas. You all right?”
“I’m detaching you from the chair but leaving your wrists tied,” Cas explains, voice soft. “I don’t think we need to worry about the hex anymore, but...”
“So you were just trying to make me pissed off enough to, what, charge at a being more powerful than me?” he raises his eyebrows. Which… is not actually a long shot, with him. But hell if he’s going to share
whoever’s holding him down. His half-awake brain doesn’t connect the dots at first; Naomi had always had him restrained, one way or another, often also drugged. So although it can’t logically be her, holding him down, he fights, because as much as he would like to use the
it if something aroused him. And Castiel knew him well enough to agree to say it if something was a strict no.
Each of their kisses felt like the making of a whole new universe, one just for the two of them. An angel who fell in love with a human. A hunter who fell in love with a broken angel. They were unconventional, in a number of ways, but it bothered neither of them. Cas had a peace in Dean, a resting place, a love, a
Perhaps it is just that it’s Castiel. That they’ve done their growing together. Perhaps Dean has sides to himself that don’t manifest around anybody else. Cas always brought out the best in him.
The sneer nearly has Dean snap more insults at the asshole, but he’s… not… He’s dizzy, rapidly losing consciousness,
And finally, “Can I stop fighting?” He’s asking Cas for permission, one he can’t grant himself. He’s spent his entire adult life
Castiel huffs a sigh. Lifts his head up, a little. “Why? Sam countered the spell. A few days, and I’ll be able to keep them out of sight. You don’t need to see me like this.”
,” he offers. Blues meeting greens. “Enough about me. I want you to feel good, too. I want...” He trails off as Dean quirks a brow. “Go ahead and smirk, you asshole, I can
“Here,” he says softly as he returns to Dean, placing the novel in his hands. “Just make yourself at home. Stay as long as you like. I close late on Mondays.” He takes in soft breaths, lowers his eyes. “It’s OK. It’s going to be OK.”
So he uses all of his willpower to keep repeating Cain and Charlie’s words in his thoughts. Adding his own, from all that time he has spent with the love of his life.
. “Dean, the reason I don’t want you to see my wings is same you wouldn’t want me to see it if you had your legs broken and deformed, scarred by an injury you can’t reverse. That changed you in ways...” He trails off, his eyes hard before he lowers them. “In a word – I would rather you never saw the parts of me I
That seems to do the trick. With one last worried glance, Cas’s features soften, and he cups Dean’s face in his palms, tenderly looking at him for a moment before he leans down, kisses him, all gentle, the signature way he traps Dean’s lower lip in between his own that makes Dean melt. He pulls against the tie, eager to move even closer to Cas, but of course it stops him, tightening against his pull, and the sensation sends such a surge of pleasure through him he
He has long since given up keeping a track of the time passing, but he thinks it might have been a little less than five months, since the last human entered the library.
. But it’s not how Cas feels, or what he wants, so maybe... just maybe... Can he do that? Even when asked to do that? Let go? Give up? No... Move on.
“I think we scored a couple of points there,” Dean said as he pulled back slightly. Cas could visualize the smirk on his face before actually opening his eyes to see it. He couldn’t argue at that, though.
“I’ll clean you up in a second,” he promises, placing a gentle kiss onto Cas’s forehead as he massages his arms. “God, that was good. Tell me when you’re ready to sit up or something so I can untie your wings.” He shifts to kiss Cas on his lips. “You are so good for me...”
“Do they hurt...?” Words whispered against his angel’s lips. And for a moment he’s worried; what if Cas has been in pain for all these years, never letting anyone know? But Cas shakes his head.
“You ready?” he asks, breathless, curling his fingers inside Cas before withdrawing them to lube his cock.
Cas, once again, tests the bindings, and Dean watches in awe as the wing strains a little against the rope, the feathers shifting slightly, almost shivering. He tugs at his arms, again, shifts on his knees, before replying, “Green,” and there’s such raw emotion and arousal in his tone Dean nearly loses it. He needs to be free of his clothes, so he rushes to strip off his t-shirt, jeans, boxers, in a matter of seconds, barely stops himself from touching himself.
So, for the first time in decades, he talks about it. About how he has barely any recollections of his life before the library. About how he prays every time another person enters the building. About how he has no choice; how he tried to take his own choice, how that ended up in just... worse things. About what happens to the people who come there, how they die, are written into stories, and disappear. About how he is being used, about how he can’t control what happens to them. About guilt.
Cas thankfully stops arguing, just lets Dean use the shirt to wipe them both clean enough so that they can take a while snuggling without making more of a mess. “Need water? Anything?” Because he’d get up for that, Castiel not actually requiring drinks, like, ever, irrelevant right now.
“God, you’re beautiful,” he mutters as he lowers himself on the floor again to grab the remaining long piece of the rope. “Do you have any idea... how hot you make me?”
been wanting to smirk at the almost-begging a second ago, but the tone Cas delivers those lines with is so intense, so far from a plea, yet not a command either...
with such intensity it feels as if Dean’s very being is exposed. And, it’s no secret that, as much as Dean doesn’t think he could not like
. He takes a cautious step forwards; at least the soles of his shoes are supported by something, if not an actual surface.
"Sorry," he mumbles, half-incoherently, at Cas, who is holding him securely in his arms, holding him even as Dean is trying to pull away. "Sorry, sorry, sorry..."
Cas knocked at his bedroom door gently, speaking in a quiet tone, as it was past midnight. He knew he was welcome in any case, but if Dean was sleeping, he didn't wish to disturb him. He didn't exactly get the chance to get a good night's sleep that often. The past couple of days had been unordinarily quiet and serene with no immediate worries. It was good – to get to take a break from everything that went bump in the night.
He’s made peace with the feeling – the promise unspoken, the definition of his heart – not going away if he ignores it. He’s
Not about the tug he feels, poking at his soul before gently nudging it forwards; not forcefully wrapping around him like the chains he’s never grown used to, but as a thread, bending, extending, never forcing, always adapting.
that entire line is - he really should start teaching Cas how to flirt properly. Lines like that just don’t
“It’s cool, you know,” Cas replied after a silence, his eyes wandering lower again. “Taking things faster.”
Cas let out a hum, pretending to consider it. Then let the corner of his lips tug into a smirk of his own. “You had your turn. Only fair, if…”
The concrete hitting his knees is there, at the back of Dean’s mind, the impact sending surges of pain up his thighs, dulling sooner than he deserves it to dull.
“Good,” Cas says, breathlessly, opening his eyes as Dean groans at the bindings before finally managing to loosen them and set Castiel’s wrists free.
Stories, he’s found, are usually less kind to their characters, than the real world is. With the exception of people like himself, and the victims of the library, maybe.
. He wants to know what the hell happened to his world; what happened during the six months Dean spent in his own personal hell, after Castiel’s disappearance, after the murder scene that hadn’t seemed so fake at the time, before he ended up on that cross, in the church. He dreads the answers Cas might have for him, but he
of all the people, willingly lower himself on his knees in front of him as a sign of submission, only adds to the beauty of it.
He stills under Dean's touch, tense, blinking his eyes open to gaze up at him, trying not to look too scared, too wide-eyed. Apparently he fails; Dean withdraws his hold just a bit too fast for it not to make Cas wince in regret.
At least it’s just the two of them home. If Dean had to pick, he’d still rather it be Cas, present when he’s vulnerable, than Sam, or Jack, or Eileen. There’s less shame involved, less sense of responsibility, even, than with his younger brother or someone who at the end of the day is all of their, including Dean’s, kid. Cas isn’t someone Dean’s ever needed to be a parent figure to - Cas is a
“OK,” he murmurs, as Cas trails a path of new kisses along his face, starting from his forehead, grazing his nose, ghosting his lips, arriving at his chin. “That sounds good.”
He doesn’t have weapons on him. Even if he did, he isn’t sure what use one would be – just knows that he’d feel much more at ease if he had a knife on hand.
Cas’s eyes lowered as his fingers played with the fabric of Dean’s shirt, then his jeans, settling onto his thigh. His head tilted, without him being aware of it.
He lowers himself enough to lay a couple of kisses under Castiel’s knees, knowing the thin layers of skin to be sensitive spots. And the sounds his angel is making have him
He’s grown smooth at this part of his existence — the same little small talk he offers everyone, these days, decades of rehearsal making every little move second nature. But it’s not just acting, with Dean. There’s a candle flame residing in his heart, one he can foresee wreaking havoc with burns once he loses it. Maybe that’s a good thing.
Hands shifted from the human’s waist to his hips again, gripping onto the edge of his jeans, just holding him there.
The rest of the day is a blur. Rather, Dean experiences everything from behind the image that seems not only to be seared onto his eyes, but all of his senses, all of himself — Cas, a rendition of what seems like a travesty of Biblical artwork, only Dean doesn’t know who the Romans of his story are and there’s no one he can take revenge on. Cas’s barely-there breaths as he hangs, immobile, heavy-duty nails impaling his palms (the same ones Dean can remember cupping his face so many times),
“No, that’s— quite all right.” He attempts to gather himself, sets the book aside, walks to the counter again, lifting a hand to his head, frowning to himself before facing Dean again. “You... uh.” What is he supposed to
His head snaps towards the library doors as he hears them creak open. The only life he knows has him expecting a new prey.
Cas heaves his upper body from the floor, trying to get back on his feet, but as soon as he sits up, his chains are tugging at him again, effectively pinning him against the wall, leaving him only inches of freedom to move. He tries to struggle against their force, frustrated (and, yes, scared), but freezes at the realisation that he can
Castiel runs a hand over his face before opening his eyes and facing the man, arranging his features into a businesslike smile; the only fate he has in this world, is to play his part. (He’s tried to rebel. Oh, he’s tried. And every single time, it has ended badly for the library’s next victim. The least he can do is
“No,” Cas says, closing his eyes for a second. “No, just... looking at my wings.” He pauses. Breathes in deeply. “You’ve made them... Dean, I can honestly see them as more than simply broken,” he says gently, offers a soft smile. “Thank you. I just... it’s too much. Looking at them for so long. Everything else is OK. I’m OK.”
what happens. “Cas,” he mumbles. “I want you to come whenever you’re ready to.” His voice laced with his own desire. “God, you feel so
“Yeah, this is gonna sound a bit... Swear I’m not as creepy as my tastes in books,” he says with an easy laugh, one that shines light to Castiel’s lungs, and makes him feel as if he might choke. “You wouldn’t happen to have anything on vampires? Looking for something sort of specific — not your usual horror stories, but anything on something a bit less... shy to weaponry. You know, a more powerful subspecies, stuff like that. Any origin would do.”
about the fact that the Entity can tell… Dean has never said a word. To anyone. Hell, it took him years to stop denying it from himself.
to Dean, but he keeps the remainders of his cool, holding Cas still as much as he manages while prepping him.
on anyone... except maybe Dean Winchester, considering. He’s too happy to hear that said out loud to make fun of it.
Even through the darkness, Dean can hear Castiel’s quick breaths. His own heart hammering. Smell the fight and the fear in the air. Feel the cold of the floor against his knees, even through his clothes, even as he finds himself tucked in on Cain’s sofa, with Charlie fussing over him, and his first woken thought is to snap at her for looking after him, when she should be looking after Cas, because obviously Cas needs her more, needs all of their attention and care, and what the hell was Dean doing unconscious, when Cas
He promises himself to start making an effort to… show Cas he’s cared about, though. That’s the least he can do. Show him that he is important.
“Good, ’cause you’re literally stuck with me at the moment,” Dean jokes, mentally slaps himself, and goes to redeem his joke that has his angel snort by working his lips, his tongue, against his nape, down his shoulder.
Dean moves his arms behind the back of the chair himself, but Cas is the one to shift them, with a light hold of his wrists, to reach a more comfortable position. There’s something extremely vulnerable about it, willingly letting someone restrain him, compromise him. And it’s still something Dean wants to roll his eyes at, that Cas is, from the feel of it, going with what he insisted in the first place: his tie. This, too, comes down to multiple layers of issues: Dean’s urge to point out how grabbing a pair of handcuffs would be more convenient, easier; how Cas shouldn’t bother caring whether Dean has the cuffs, unforgiving and painful in the case of a struggle, round his wrists. Even rope would be easier. It’s counterproductive, using a tie, the slippery material needing more knotwork to hold a person effectively than the coarseness of a rope, or the click of a handcuff. But trust Cas to take his time in favour of making sure Dean feels as comfortable as he can.
Castiel trails his lips along Dean’s neck as the latter wraps his fingers around him, gently shifting them along his cock while Cas kisses his neck, rough. Their breaths fall into a similar, heavy rhythm.
It’s strange. It’s certainly not something Dean would ever do, without Cas needing him to do it. (And even so, it’s a choice — Cain offered to look after Cas if Dean ever needed time to recharge, but it’s out of the question. And if spending time with Cas, like this, does anything for Dean, it definitely recharges him, in more levels than just one.)
. Can’t even tell what he’s fighting for, anymore. If this is what Cas wants, and Dean chooses to continue trying to fight Naomi nevertheless, who exactly is he fighting for? Not Cas, that’s for sure. Not if that’s not what Cas wants of him.
Castiel breathes through his nose, even but shallow breaths. Heaves out a broken sigh as the doors resume their movement, opening, not closing, opening and bringing upon the fate of the stranger stepping inside. He presses his eyes shut, tight, heartbeat settling, hope breaking.
But it’s still Cas, reaching his peak first, with an inaudible moan Dean sees through his half-open eyes, and the shudders moving through his body, muscles tightening around Dean, the look on his face, all of it is enough to drive Dean into his own orgasm.
The softest of moans escaped Cas as Dean caught his earlobe in between his lips, pulling. So soft it was barely a whisper, yet still audible for Dean who was right next to his face.
Dean pulls the covers over them, resting his face against the crook of Cas’s neck; the latter draping his arm around Dean’s waist.
The thought is so selfish it makes him wail for several seconds. Cas holds him through his walls breaking, holds him through the wails and the sobs and finally the rivers of tears calming into droplets. And then, through the quiet.
“I’m coming back for you. I’ll see you tomorrow. OK? Tomorrow.” Cas can nearly hear the real intention behind what Dean is saying.
Dean regains his ability to move, at first shaking, still staring at the sight before him, though his vision is getting all the more blurry. Lack of oxygen, tears, it doesn’t matter. His arms, spread and trembling violently, lips parted for a silent, unbreathed scream, still, and it feels like an eternity has passed since he stopped breathing, an eternity, and if it is eternity, that implies it has no end, and he—
So as he settles onto the chair, it’s not the worst thing ever, the gentle care Cas handles him with.
Dean truly cannot fathom what kind of magical sources Cas is tapping into to restore his patience, but just like that, his demeanour goes back to calm and gentle, as he touches Dean’s shoulder, lightly, before helping his jacket off of him. “I know you don’t like to concern yourself with your own wellbeing,” Cas says, softer, “but I’d appreciate it if you allowed
. And safe. Just, please. I want to move on. Please, move on with me, Dean. Please. She’s not worth — this, driving you to break yourself. She’s not worth any of this. ...And you don’t owe it to me to end her, either.”
He glances at the form of his husband sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over, and curls into a ball, eyes half-shut, trying not to tremble.
?!” he rushes to defend himself, makes a move to sit up but Cas’s hands are on his arms, pushing him back down before he can move an inch. “Cas, you can’t just listen in on private thoughts that aren’t
“I know I can’t exactly... undress you, with you like this, but...” Cas murmurs, lips against Dean’s neck as he slips his hands under his t-shirt, making Dean whimper his approval; he’d like to touch Cas too, only every tug of his hands is stopped by the firm softness of the tie around his wrists, and wanting to touch but being unable to somehow makes the anticipation even better.
With Cas’s hand around Dean’s cock, lips searching for lips, and the tie still secure around his wrists, Dean is exactly where he wants to be in the universe. Trapped in the safety of everything Cas is to him.
, because even though he doesn’t sleep, they’ve come to an unspoken understanding on how much less Dean has nightmares when Cas’s weight is there next to him.
Dean pressed his palms against Castiel’s shirt, sliding to meet each other. Started to work on unbuttoning the garment, slowly, a bit hesitantly. Cas slipped his own hands under the human’s shirt to urge him to go on, stroking the skin of his back in circles.
“Hey, buddy,” he says, softly, settling onto another easy chair, trying to maintain a distance from his partner that seems appropriate; not too far, definitely not too close. He knows there were no signs of any sexual assault, but Cas was gone for six damn months, so who can tell? Even if it wasn’t like that, Cas was obviously kept a prisoner for all that time, and Dean doesn’t want to bring back memories of violence, be that of any nature. He coughs quietly, eyes Castiel for a few seconds, then grabs up the poetry book from the coffee table. That’s another new; Cas was the one who really ever understood the appeal or literature.
“Was it the tie?” Cas asks, leaning a bit closer, all analytics, as if to take a look at the restraint from over Dean’s shoulder.
. He nods, summons a soft smile, closes his eyes as Dean leans closer, expectant of the gentle touches he’s kept offering him.
“Uh-huh. Yeah,” is all Dean manages to breathe out; if he’s trying to escape, it’s only to delight in the sensation that he’s unable to. He doesn’t want to get way, doesn’t want to escape Cas, doesn’t want to be let go, in any sense of the phrase.
He uses all of his self-restraint skills to pull away after a while, but the low grunt Cas doesn’t manage to suppress, in protest of him doing that, makes it worth it. His angel’s eyes are dark with dilated pupils as Dean meets them.
“Oh.” Castiel’s lips curve into a whisper of a smile, despite himself. That makes more sense. He tilts his head further, making eye-contact. “No, I’m sorry. We’re exclusive to fiction.” Even so, it’s too late for the man to change his mind and walk out the doors. Castiel wishes he’d chosen another library, even as he knows better.
“Hey,” he goes on, hands landing onto Castiel’s shoulders again, firmly, holding onto the fabric in a suggestion to slide the trench coat off his shoulders. “Cas, look at me.”
Stupid-ass angel for never saying anything, for thinking he’s not… worth it, or something, which still feels incomprehensible to Dean.
Cas lets him guide himself so that he’s standing with his back towards the mirror hanging on the wall. “Hang on,” Dean mumbles, retrieves the one inside the wardrobe.
He reaches out his hands for Cas to take a hold of, pulls him up from the chair, to eye-level. Kisses his lips, gently, so lightly they barely meet.
Cas’s fingers curled against Dean’s hair, his other hand trailing across the human’s spine. He was fairly sure his neck would be left with very visible markings thanks to what Dean was doing. He was fairly sure he wouldn’t use his abilities to heal them.
, but their lips collide; gentle, sloppy, full of question marks. The both of them searching for answers they’ll have plenty of time finding together.
, at least during the years Castiel has been the library’s vessel, has ever been alive at the end of their novel.
“Uh, never mind what the fuck,” Dean continues. “I’ll take that, while it lasts, just... just... come on.” He stares at Cas, the both of them dazed, offers his hand to help him on his feet. “Let’s get you out of here before the universe decides to, I don’t... know what just... OK, moving, now.”
Eventually, even as the images of his lover, crucified, persist, Dean’s panic dulls into a miserable lull of exhaustion. He ignores his friends’ attempts to urge him to get some rest; he’s trusted Cain with a plethora of stab wounds, gunshot wounds even, over the years, but that was all for
He steps back, walks to Cas’s wardrobe, every step deliberately crafted, because he needs to focus to keep his body language dominant – and he keeps it up, even as he steps out of Cas’s field of vision, on gut instinct. Knows without looking that Cas will be keeping his eyes forward. Dean grabs the black, soft ropes from a cardboard box behind Cas’s shoes, the threads of the ropes individually carved with appropriate warding to make them angel proof.
; quiet, as always, yet still full of desire and need. Low moans, sharp gasps of air. They are both hard, Dean’s cock leaking pre-come without even having been touched. He awkwardly fumbles for the bedside table as he moves up along Cas’s body again, swearing under his breath before he manages to yank the drawer open.
Cas swallows hard; it sounds like Dean is talking to himself, rather than really at Cas, but the words hit his heart,
“Cas, it’s me,” the voice says, all calm and collected, soft and... gentle? “It’s Dean. You’re safe. Hey. You’re all right. Not gonna hurt you. Not gonna let anyone hurt you. It’s just me.”
“How’re you feeling?” There’s reassuring experience and compassionate strength in Dean’s tone, as if he’s no stranger to taking care of others. “You need me to call 911?”
His chest is bare under the trench coat, but that isn’t where Dean focuses his attention on. He watches as the smooth feathers, partly fragmented and scattered along the structure of the wings get released from under the fabric. They rise slightly and move a few inches, as if wanting to be free and stand proudly instead of being folded against Castiel’s shoulder blades, but too shy, too hesitant to really do so. The feathers are ink black, a more intense version of a night sky – with specs and diamonds of turquoises and emeralds reflecting light faintly, like stars and galaxies scattered across a broken surface. Broken or not, the sight takes Dean’s breath away; he can’t comprehend how Castiel can
For a second it was awkward, but Dean didn’t turn his gaze away – instead, for once, an understanding seemed to melt the two of them together, breaking the tension, and Castiel found his lips capturing Dean’s again.
The human’s silence had him face him again. Raise his eyebrows in curiosity. Even to Cas’s eyes, Dean was obviously flustered, staring at him.
step back from him; this is the Entity’s domain, he can hardly run. He’d rather fight if it comes to that. “What are you
The both of his angel’s wings, deep black glimmering with hints of coloured light he doesn’t understand the source of, soft yet firm feathers woven with the rope, black against black, folded so that they can be visible, proud; beautifully wrapped in ropes, resting against Castiel’s arms, his back.
He wets his chapped lips with his tongue. If it was only him, he’d be all right. He’d be peachy. He’s used to bottling up his emotions. But if Cas is really… if Cas is harbouring similar things that Dean has been and they are hurting him? That’s not acceptable, not in Dean’s books.
Cas seems to be having nearly as much trouble getting his words out, his eyes half shut as he gazes at Dean. “
It may be one of the reasons Dean finds this whole situation to be more tolerable with Cas rather than someone else, that he so swiftly manages to shift from the epitome of gentleness and patience to done-with-your-bullshit no-nonsense authority, and back again. However, right now Dean’s starting to wish it
But Castiel can’t stop himself from gazing at him. Can’t stop his heart from thumping against his ribcage.
“You can’t make it ‘right’, Dean,” Cas says, and his voice might be gentle, but the words are daggers at Dean’s abdomen. His hold of Cas tightens. Cas’s hands massage calming patterns at his back. “That doesn’t mean you can’t make me
The sound begins as a wail, barely audible, but quickly escalates as he crumbles, curling up, body shaking violently, breath passing through his lungs only to be exhaled as cries of helplessness and misery and all of that unleashed grief that now forces its way out from behind the walls Dean has built for it.
, most of the time, with Castiel. Sex, for him, Dean’s figured, is more about the build-up than the act. Dean’s learned to appreciate it; the restraint he’s learned from Cas, the prolonged moments of pleasure. Cas has adapted too – giving it to Dean rough and fast when that’s what he needs. Strangely, despite their problems when it comes to being on the same page outside of the bedroom, with sex, they naturally echo to a similar frequency. They communicate better.
Cas considered the offer. Still holding Dean’s chin in his grip. If anything, that was probably exactly what he was after. So he let his hand drop from Dean’s face, nodding. “That could be interesting.”
They are both losing themselves in the moment, Cas quiet aside from the shivers and the brief gasps of breath he inhales. Dean just gazing at the wing his fingers are adventuring on, shifting enough to be able to reach the tip hanging close to the floor, but to still keep holding onto Cas’s hand gently.
He knows what it’s like to willingly give up all control to someone he absolutely trusts. He knows how
Dean Winchester is standing up from his chair, the novel hanging from his hand. Finished. Their eyes meet. It takes Castiel a while to realise that he’s being smiled at.
He’s been holding back for so long it’s sloppy at first, it takes them time to fall into the same rhythm, but once they do, it’s bliss.
Eyes unblinking, he tests the waters, lifting an arm over the limitations of where his chains allow him to move. But they are still there, unseen, but present, not letting him go. The library glitching enough to leave him time to escape with Dean was probably too far-fetched to hope for, anyway.
“Good,” he replies, releasing the tension he didn’t notice he had been building on his shoulders. Trails a few kisses along Cas’s cheekbone, finishing with one against his lips before pulling away. “All usual rules apply. I would like to... tie you up, other than just your wings, too. And I would like you to see yourself, tied up. We don’t exactly have a full body mirror in your bedroom, but I’ll - I will think of something. I want you to see yourself.” He lets Cas consider that. “Colour?” It’s easier than asking
And then there are good days, again. Good and bad, alternating; sometimes the world just moves too quickly for Cas and he finds himself so on edge he can’t sleep for days. Other times he’s having a perfectly good time with Dean and their mutual friends, when suddenly it feels as if he’s trapped in a universe far, far away, and just the shell of him remains present with the people he loves, and he’s unable to communicate it, because his facade keeps on going as if nothing were wrong.
