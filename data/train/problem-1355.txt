Sherlock hummed softly into a particularly lascivious sweep of John’s tongue and pulled their hips in closer, widening his stance to ensure their groins matched up. John’s hands flew to Sherlock’s hair and neck, taking greedy palmfuls of both and angling his head so he could press deeper and make Sherlock repeat that fucking sexy noise.
Sherlock trades places with John in the bathroom and his friend marches off downstairs.
Sherlock hasn't finished though. He unbuttons and shucks his shirt, then bends down to pull off his socks, popping back up a second later to perform a slow, deliberate circle, allowing John to fully appreciate the beauty of his aroused form wearing the tight, silky underwear John had picked out for him.
Slowly.
Crispian is in the shower only seconds before John's light knock comes on the bathroom door.
“And tha’s why… you are… the love’f my life. Now what?” John giggles softly. “Press one for ‘I love you too’. Press two for ‘I’m flattened by your interes’ but I consssss...ider myself married to my work. Press three to hear th’se options again.”
"Mummy? What have you done to my bedroom?" Sherlock yells, his mother's muffled response coming from downstairs, and John hears big, expensively shod feet thumping down the stairs at speed before a door slams and relative peace descends again on the house.
John sniffs, appearing unable to believe the evidence of his own ears and eyes, and a smile begins to appear, glacially slowly across his face.
The problem is how does he put that into words? How does he explain to an emotionally inexperienced adult male that he has such power over John that he can make or break him with a word? That John is devoted to him in a way he’s never experienced before. That John will happily play whatever role Sherlock has for him in his life as long as he doesn’t send him away. That
John has an itchy, unsettled feeling for the rest of the day. He’s been in the garden, clearing and digging, but by lunch time he’s completely out of sorts. The weather is close and airless, and John squints at the sky which is clouding over and hazy now. Even the birds are quieter. There’s a storm on the way for certain. It’s making the air thick and syrupy, and John retreats to the house where he finds he cannot settle to anything.
“I thought you… it all came back. It’s like I was there again. I saw you, I watched you and I couldn’t… There was nothing I could do to stop it. I’m a soldier, I’m a doctor and there was
If John is wrong about this, if he has overshot Sherlock's intent by a country mile then he's going to look like the most massive fool in the world. (And that's if Sherlock had any intent at all - who the hell knows? God, it's all so confusing.)
It is a void in which his significance ceases, and his consciousness becomes an irrelevance. This place has no feature by which one might understand it. It lacks shape, hue, orientation, scent, atmosphere, temperature. It is nothingness.
"Problem?" he asks.
The rain teases at the windows, now spattering and fitful, now drumming with joyful abandon, now clattering petulantly with the gusting wind.
John's eyes track from the apologetic look on Sherlock’s face, back to the suit laid out on their bed. He doesn’t quite… It surely cannot be…
And even if he says no, even if he walks away now, Sherlock would be an idiot to think that his addiction to John was resolved. An addict is never cured of their high of choice - cocaine, cigarettes, gambling, sex - they just learn to live with it - every day is a new battle to be won. Some days are easier than others, but you’re never free from it. Can he face the rest of his life missing John? Cocaine, yes, now he knows there’s something better, but John?
"Isn't that what friends do? Forgive each other?"
It's going to be a long night.
Rising up on his knees, John lets Sherlock slip from his lips and replaces them with his hand. With his fingers deep in Sherlock, and his fist around his cock, he can feel the effect of this double assault and he leans over quickly to take Sherlock's lips in a deep, messy kiss. So when his fingers tease Sherlock's prostate and he begins the long, rough strokes that Sherlock loves when he's close, John is ready to swallow down the moans and deep sighs and take Sherlock over the edge into orgasm, holding him together when he feels like he is shaking apart. The clenching and squeezing around his fingers reveal the intensity of Sherlock's climax and when they finally slacken, John kisses a trail down his body, chasing the evidence of his ecstasy, ending up at his spread thighs and touching his lips with reverence to the smooth skin there.
John's blinks, his face going strangely blank and he averts his gaze.
Sherlock wants to feel that movement. He wants to go over there and put his palms on John’s waist, press his chest against John’s back and feel the way the muscles of his torso shift. He wants to chase the vibrations of John’s voice by pressing his mouth to the nape of John’s neck, softly to let the skin move beneath his lips. Despite the intimacy of his thoughts, they aren’t even sexual necessarily. John has inadvertently become such an intrinsic part of Sherlock’s life that he cannot tolerate to have even the most miniscule detail about him to be unknown or untested. It has always taken a considerable amount of restraint on Sherlock’s part to allow John such secrets as these, where his deductions are hampered by not knowing which questions to ask. Where was John when he first heard this particular song? Who taught him to chop onions this way? Does he like to dance only in the privacy of their kitchen or might he be persuaded to dance elsewhere? These are not the kinds of things they have talked about. Would John have answered if Sherlock had found the right combination of words to ask?
John has taken his silence for rejection.
“Your injury? Was it sustained in Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“It’s delicious,” Sherlock murmurs and John beams at him.
In a flash of inspiration, Sherlock determines to give John an
“Ah, no. That was simple. He was having an affair with his groom; a young man whose aesthetic qualities clearly outweigh his intelligence many times over. I found the ring within half an hour of arriving and returned it to our grateful client.”
Clearly plainer words are needed.
“Yes, I understand,” Sherlock interrupts, impatient suddenly, “but hypothetically, how do you recognise the love of your life?”
Because that’s what you do when nothing really matters any more.
“Oh really? Well, I have a few more points I could make, if it would help.”
Sherlock and Mycroft engage in one of their silent slanging matches, their expressions moving minutely but clearly enough for them to communicate their wishes with some force.
“You’re bigger – it’s… exquisite!” Sherlock panted, his voice wrecked and ragged.
The month rolls over into March and other than another quick visit from Mme Hudson early on with a message from Harry which goes along the lines of  -
"They seem alright. Quite the group though. Did any of them have what you might consider to be a normal job? Or a normal name for that matter."
“But with all the running around and Moriarty and your suicide and his wedding…”
Crispian laughs as if he's just said something utterly hilarious.
the word has been filling up every space inside his skull, but by now it seems to be the only one that’s there. It compels him. It moves his feet and stiffens his spine. It seems to be the one word that covers everything he needs to express. It’s concise. It’s important… No, it’s imperative.
Crispian looks a little surprised, but Sherlock hands him gloves and secateurs, then takes John by the arm and steers him off in the opposite direction. He leads them deeper through the tree trunks towards an overgrown area where trees have clearly fallen some time ago. Their tumbled outlines are covered in green, glossy ivy. It even has a dark flower of sorts, and he and Sherlock set to, cutting and untangling long tendrils of the stuff and heaping it by the path on a carpet of dead leaves.
"Are you alright? What 's the problem?" John asks.
“Was,” John corrects. “I was injured in Afghanistan and invalided out of service.” He finishes the wine in his glass and looks away, hoping that the topic will drop.
Sherlock’s eyelids lowered and the smirk bloomed into a wicked, knowing smile. “Not a dream, John.”
"John," he says and finds he has no idea what comes next.
When the fifth piece, played by a solo pianist, is finished and everyone is clapping and sharing congratulations on their performances, John leans up toward Sherlock who bends his neck to hear, sending John a delicious waft of his friend’s shampoo and cologne.
“You’re not going to try to tell me that I’ve got it wrong, I hope. I’ve had more love affairs than… well, you - that’s for certain.” Her eyes gleam as her smile quirks and, momentarily,  it takes thirty years off her age.
In the background Sherlock can hear the sound of a car horn, two short beeps as it pulls away. He sits up straighter when he realises he can hear the same noise coming from outside on the street.
"I thought... I thought you didn't... You didn't seem to like them."
John finally asks Violet who is sitting with her feet up in her husband's lap, watching as the last of the catering staff pack up the plates and glasses, leaving the garden quiet and filled with the scent of crushed grass along with the honeysuckle that covers the west-facing wall of the cottage.
He puts down the book and sighs, pushing his good hand through his hair in frustration.
Sherlock says nothing; it's his father's birthday. Breaking his cousin's nose, no matter how warranted, would probably come under the category John calls 'not good.' But he needs to put some space between himself and temptation  - he can almost feel the satisfying crunch and warm gush on the skin of his knuckles. He turns on his heel and makes for the door. Crispian's voice follows him all the way across the kitchen.
Mummy, Father, Mycroft, Uncle Oswin and Crispian are already at the kitchen table with cups of coffee and tea. Odelia and Robert complete the house party, walking in behind them. Predictably they are all smiles and Sherlock's eyes can't help but drift to the direct look on Crispian's face as his gaze bounces from him to John and back again.
He rubs his hand over his eyes and pinches the top of his nose, breathing deliberately.
John knows to expect it and takes the phone once more to read it.
“That was beautiful. Don’t stop,” John urges, meeting his eye. “Chopin?”
"Maybe...” John clears this throat. “Maybe you'd like to have dinner with me tonight?" John manages eventually, half expecting a withering retort.
“Oh, good Lord, no. He’ll only play Andrew Lloyd-Webber if he knows I’m in earshot,” he says cryptically and with a long-suffering roll of his eyes. “He’s very… reserved about his violin. It’s one of the few things he excels at that he doesn’t want to show off and you know how uncharacteristic that is.” Mycroft smiles as if he’s paid his brother a compliment and ignores John’s stony silence. “This was his first full-size violin. With a lifestyle as unconventional as his I’m sometimes surprised that he still has it.”
Sherlock shrugs and tries on an unconcerned air, the impact of which is lessened by the way that his gaze keeps straying to John. It's like being back at school again, feigning nonchalance in case the object of your affection laughs in your face. John feels a twinge of pity for him that his coping strategies seem so very adolescent, possibly never having had the opportunity to mature.
Sherlock sits up suddenly and John follows him with his eyes, sitting back to make space for him.
"Hi, love! Are you okay?"
Seconds tick by under their little sheltered corner, their own quiet combining with the silence of the world turning white just a few centimetres from where they are standing. The anticipation of John saying his piece and finding out what that might be is tempered by the desire for time to stop altogether. There is so much about this moment that Sherlock wishes to record, any number of observations that he could make to add context to this memory when he comes to take it out in the future. Something is going to happen, and this is the moment that everything is about to change, to swing into motion and change the course of Sherlock's life, be it good or bad.  Should it be the gentle rejection that he fears, he just wants these seconds to hang so he can remain in the moment before John closes off all other potential outcomes for this point in time where anything is still possible.
And surely there was only so much that a red-blooded man in his prime could be expected to take? So when Sherlock’s thumbnail grazed the inseam of the denim all the way up to where the tightness of the material left very little to the imagination, John pounced. He wasn’t proud, but no man should have to endure such torment.
"You love him," Crispian repeats, as if Sherlock is deaf. "Alternately, I can be a very demanding patient and require that the good doctor returns to my side at frequent intervals for the rest of the afternoon, this evening and all through tomorrow. Who knows how many warm showers or examinations I might need? And I suspect I will require help when hobbling to and from the loo and..."
The third sheet he untangles from the pile is by Rimsky-Korsakov and is similarly notated.
They’re doing better these days. Relearning how to live together again has given way to something that resembles what they used to have – when John thought that if he was patient enough Sherlock would reveal the thing that was growing between them, whatever it was. He’d never had a closer friend than the consulting detective and some days it seemed that there was even further for them to journey together. But what they have now is good. Sherlock is less frenetic, even during cases. He eats too, sometimes and sleeps more than he did. It might not sound like much, but quiet evenings watching old movies or sharing sections of the newspaper over the breakfast table are things he never thought he’d have again.
“I suppose that’s…”
John can feel it building, coiling in his belly and groin, tighter and tighter as Sherlock ruts against him. For a second Sherlock rolls away, scrabbling at his borrowed pyjamas. He pushes them down to his thighs and then pulls the waistband of John’s boxers down so it sits under his balls. He wastes no time in rolling back into John’s arms and lining them up together.
Sherlock huffs indignantly, then chuckles into John’s hair, shockingly warm against his scalp. And he must be getting better because he’s beginning to register things that should be obvious, like the numbing bite of his cold, wet clothes and the twitchy feeling of the adrenaline leaving his bloodstream. He’s chilled everywhere the blanket doesn’t reach, and burning all down his back and where Sherlock’s arms still encircle him. His bum has gone all to pins and needles where they have been sitting here so long.
be – this is the right place –
“No, I was right – go away. And bring us some tea!” he calls after the man who seems all too happy to comply with the first request at least.
Sherlock hopes to avoid talking to John until it is time to gather for their carolling appointment by the simple expedient of remaining in the kitchen, which in the Holmes household, truly is the heart of the home. Both his parents enjoy cooking and both are very good at it which all means that there is usually someone in the kitchen, baking, washing up, preparing the next meal or just sitting at the large scrubbed pine table, drinking tea or reading. It's Sherlock's favourite room in the house and he feels a measure of security here even though his nerves are jangling from earlier.
“Oh, that’s how it’s going to be is it?” John asks, then grabs Sherlock’s shirt to pull his head down so they are face to face, only centimetres apart, breathing the same air and with one last glance between Sherlock’s mouth and his eyes, he presses their lips together.
There’s no sense of the passage of time, there is no pattern to John’s random arrivals and departures. It’s no use being aware that something terrible is happening; with all the laws of science abandoned in this current reality, he cannot trust what his eyes see, what his ears hear. It’s like time itself has become porous and fragile, with multiple realities intruding randomly on his consciousness. For a man like Sherlock, who has built his life about certain constants and who has eschewed all but the most rigorously tested and proven concepts, this is more terrifying than he can process. Although John’s appearance in his mind palace is unprecedented and as yet unexplained, Sherlock cannot deny that even the idea of him being present brings him the only comfort available to him in this endlessly confusing space.
Tomorrow, he reminds himself; tomorrow he will be travelling down to Dorset to await the arrival of his wife where they will talk for the first time in weeks. He’s going to tell her that they can put what’s happened behind them and try again. He’s going to tell her that he’s going to move back in to their marital home. He’s going to leave Baker Street, leave Sherlock and somehow turn himself into the kind of man who forgives things like shooting his best friend. He’s going to be a father to their child. Because it’s the right thing to do, not because he wants to.
“It’s okay. Sherlock, shhh! It’s okay,” John soothes.
“I don’t have a lot of experience with…” his hand makes an abortive gesture that John understands immediately. It’s not often that Sherlock is at a loss for the right words, he’s usually Mr Scrabble score, but he is trying to explain emotions with a rudimentary and untried vocabulary. “I expected you to be surprised by my return, even pleased. I’d thought about it for so long and planned so many ways to tell you, and in none of them had I factored your grief or the possibility that you might have moved on. If nothing else, that  demonstrates my naivety most succinctly. If anyone needs to be forgiven, it is I. I was the instrument of my own downfall. I saw but I did not observe.”
“Wha? Oh, yeah, yeah, I’m good thanks.” There’s a short pause. “How are you?”
Century and was presumed lost forever.”
John fucked him as slowly as he could stand to, but still found himself about to come within a couple of minutes. He crossed his arms over Sherlock’s waist, pulled him upright on his lap and pushed up into him with trembling thighs as he came deep, sweet and gasping inside him.
“I owe you an apology. And I owe Bill a swift kick in the nuts. He always was a bastard - I have no idea why I said yes to meeting up with him,” John admits, then adds another, “Bastard,” for good measure.
"Oh darling, really?" Father asks, giving his wife a fond smile.
John trails off and Sherlock is seized with a wave of longing so hard it’s a physical ache. His John… the
The sound he makes is high and inhuman, but Sherlock pulls John onto the floor with him, propping himself against the wall and forcing John to turn in his arms and press his back against Sherlock’s chest.
"Do I need to bring something smart to wear? Do your family go to midnight mass or anything?"
A creeping sensation of helplessness settles in Sherlock’s chest and he covers his face with his hands, just for a moment. He drops into John’s chair seeking comfort in the form that John leaves in the cushions.
“He’s playing again, is he?” Mycroft taps the lid of the case with the nail of his middle finger, and John tries to stop the prickle that creeps up the back of his shoulders and neck.
Sherlock's hands are a little clumsy - gone is the strip-tease sass and the cheeky smirk - but he manages to comply, pulling the waistband of the ridiculous pants to stretch across the very tops of his thighs. They're snug, and they force his balls up tight against his cock. It doesn't look all that comfortable, but Sherlock grunts and runs his palm up and off his cock, making it stand straight up before it springs back against his belly.
“Next time, could we not wait until I’m in Tesco’s?” he asked. “And you seem to be doing a good job of entertaining yourself.”
He knows that he too doesn’t need much - it’s been building since the second he saw Sherlock haloed in the window by the light from Baker Street.
He stamps down the last few stairs and throws open the sitting room door.
“Let’s not wait to say goodbye then,” Sherlock replied, pushing past John and holding the door to the car park open for him, his cheeks already beginning to pink again. “Come on, John!”
“I’m not busy at all,” John confides and they watch the clouds while the dryer hums away in the background.
“Fuc’off,” John mumbles and bats at Sherlock’s hand before he catches sight of who he’s abusing and the besotted smile dawns across his face once more. “Hi! Hi! Sorry… what was I saying?”
John’s strong arms come around his shoulders and turn him away, leading him to the sofa where they sit and Sherlock, hating himself, allows John to stroke his back and pet his hair until the tears on his face have dried.
"That was quite wonderful, what you and Mycroft played earlier."
“Fine, thanks,” John nods. “Been working in the garden a bit. Enjoying the sunshine.”
“Sorry, Mrs Hudson. In a bit of a hurry,” he said dodging around her without stopping.
John has his head tipped to the side, a challenging smile playing around his eyes. He’s daring Sherlock, seeing how far he will go before he ultimately backs-down. John’s error is that, this time, Sherlock isn’t going to back down. He knows he gets away with a lot that John might not let others get away with. He’s become aware over the years of their association that other people don’t stand as close as Sherlock stands to John, nor do they maintain eye contact for as long and he’s never seen anyone else, married, partnered or otherwise related move with such synchronicity as they do – it’s always been there but time has honed and enhanced it - not even Sherlock’s eighteen month absence has lessened it.
The possibilities spin through Sherlock's mind at high speed. Too many to count.  Some are outlandish and others are so unlikely as to be laughable. Lost? An argument? Removed for work and forgotten? Sent away to be engraved? He needs more data to be able to pin down a reason for this aberration, but that would necessitate him looking ever more closely at John. He could simply ask, but he's afraid of what he might hear, good or bad. It will either make him feel sorrow and regret for his friend or it will raise his own hopes again, as pathetic as that always turns out to be. He will not put himself through that yet again. John has made his decision, several times, in fact, and it's the same one each time. Ring or no ring, none of them include Sherlock.
"When did you realise that you might have been hasty in that judgement?"
“John, there’s something I should say, I… I’ve meant to say always and never have…”
They look nervous, despite John’s efforts. Their eyes flick to each other rather than looking at him. “There’s no A& E here. There’s Minor Injuries but they’re not 24 hours. Are you sure the text said…”
“No, I think I have more than repaid the favour I owed him. I have eliminated one suspect and pinpointed the source of the problem. He can take it from there – even MI6 can’t ruin this.”
This could not be any worse. In an instant of utter idiocy, not only has he alerted John to his attraction but he has also managed to convince John that said attraction has been caused by his head injury playing tricks with him. His own worst case scenario has been realised and surpassed – with John aware of his feelings for him, he had hoped for an answer, one way or another; whether they could ever be anything more than friends. Now he is none the wiser
John glances about him as he paces himself, judging the likelihood of the underground still being operational at this time of night. It’s a possibility, but he can’t stand the thought of wasting precious minutes only to find he’s out of luck. He keeps an eye out for one of Mycroft’s dark cars, but what little traffic there is, is slow moving in the poor visibility.
He lifts his arm and reaches behind him, pushing his fingers into Sherlock's hair and turning his head for badly aimed kisses. He groans quietly into Sherlock's jaw. He can't seem to drag his gaze away from the sight of them both, Sherlock's pale hand around his own ruddy cock, his forearm flexing with each stroke. But best of all are Sherlock's eyes, silvered and half-lidded, not missing a single second of what he's doing to John, of how he's taking him apart and letting John watch.
John’s hands flew to his own erection, neglected in his desire to reconnect with Sherlock. He unclasped the fastening and unzipped, his cock straining into his hand as John pushed his pants aside. He was already dripping slick at the head, his foreskin retracted and the cool air and his hot hand made him moan a little. He was so close already, just from hearing Sherlock take his pleasure.
He loves to force John to change tack mid-conversation. And he just knows that the smug git hadn’t expected him to know what a luthier is.
Crispian shuffles into the bathroom and pushes the door until it is ajar. There are a few minutes silence before a resigned voice comes from within. "John, I'm sorry but I'm having a couple of issues."
It’s an unpleasant sensation, this airless, spinning fall and it takes a few seconds for Sherlock to turn fully.
Veins singing with something like relief and still struck by sudden giggles, he and  John climb the stairs to change into their warmest clothing and prepare for the evening ahead. There's a moment when Sherlock emerges from pulling on a thicker jumper that John stops and sighs, finally settling again. He smiles at Sherlock, reaches over and cautiously flicks a few of Sherlock's curls away from his face.
"Just unwinding," John offers. "It was a good day. Your dad seemed to enjoy his party. Thanks for the invitation."
Removing his hat, he drops it at the end of the bench revealing the dark curls that John remembers. “How about something different this time,” Sherlock says, almost to himself as he peruses the jars. He pulls down one or two and gives them a quick sniff before closing them and returning them to the shelf.
“And who did we nick the polo uniform from?”
"John, why don't you see if Mummy has that hot water bottle ready and I'll help Crispian into the shower."
He wonders for the umpteenth time whether he should walk over and see Sherlock but something tells him that he cannot rush this thing that is growing between them. It doesn’t stop him from wanting to though.
John sniffs and clears his throat, and Sherlock hears rustling of fabric which is clearly John’s attempt to straighten himself up a bit, wherever he has slumped.
Sherlock’s hands were open now, running slowly to his knees and back to his upper thighs. The brushing sound of the fabric was startlingly memorable. Battle dress uniform was always starchy and rough when you first got it. Like new boots, it took days and weeks of sun, dirt, sweat and action to begin to soften. Each time it was washed, it returned to you a little more familiar, a little more
The sky has only just begun to pale. He could lay here and relish John’s presence for a few moments more, but his mind is already buzzing restlessly and he knows that to stay will only frustrate him further.
“Kiss me,” John interrupts.
The man doesn’t even turn to look at him, simply lifts an imperious finger in the internationally understood gesture for wait.
"I should have brought my gun," John mutters, and wonders how high off the ground the plants actually are.
, but he can't shut his eyes because he'll miss the second when Sherlock makes him come, and that's when Sherlock whispers, "Now, John."
The first item is a press cutting - one from a couple of months into their friendship. They had solved a kidnapping case - the son of a famous sports personality. The story had been widely reported and followed avidly by the press and public alike. After thirty-six hours of no progress, the Met had asked Sherlock if he might be prepared to take a look. The boy had been returned home unharmed within four hours of Sherlock's consent to assist. There had been a press conference afterwards in which Sherlock’s part had been praised but he had refused to take questions from the reporters, so John had stepped in and fielded a few, vaguely explaining Sherlock's process in finding the child and uncovering the perpetrator in the guise of the star's former manager. John remembers the case well; he had been proud of Sherlock that day and he had wanted people to know it was the unparalleled mind of his friend that had solved the puzzle. Indeed, he recalls that he'd needed to rein in his admiration when retelling the story or he’d have inadvertently revealed the recently hidden depth of his feelings for the man.
Sherlock hummed a disgruntled noise and turned to the mirror over the fireplace to check his hair. “So what do these normal people wear?”
The building had obviously not been built to house offices and from the outside it looked like warehousing or light industrial units. Inside, however, it had been converted into a series of large, open-plan rooms. But no amount of gargantuan potted plants or painted breeze-block walls could cover the fact that the place was a dismal retro-fit, and John had a moment of sympathy for those who spent so many of their waking hours in the strip-lit horror.
Holmes has a frown on his face and he looks at John as if he’s never seen another human being before. He’s wearing a shirt with the sleeves folded back and a pair of dark blue fitted trousers as well as the strangely out of character hat. John’s not surprised that he thought that the figure in the Manoir’s garden was elderly when he first noticed him. He dresses so formally for being outside and the hat has to have belonged to a Holmes ancestor once upon a time.
The man pauses and turns slightly. “Problem?” he asks with a quirked eyebrow.
All pretence of a friendly chat is dropped now. Mycroft’s ice-chip eyes are focussed and merciless. John refuses to react, forcing the muscles in his face into bland dispassion, but the implication is unmistakable and it has hit hard. His voice, when he answers, is low and implacable.
There was always a reason why it was a bad idea. In his heart of hearts, John knew that Sherlock was in love with him, whatever that word meant to him, but he could never bring himself to believe in it… in him… strongly enough to reach for it. Fear had kept him from acting, never sure what reaction he’d get to an overt sign or word of love.
"The motion of the train is surprisingly soothing," Sherlock admits, yawning in sympathy with John.
They have established that Sherlock’s ideal medium for conversation is his phone, despite John’s exhortations to try to use his voice, and he reaches for it now and types, then shows it to John.
"Goodnight John, " he rumbles softly.
John has a lot of respect for Violet - it cannot have been an easy household to live with. That doesn’t mean, of course, that he doesn’t also have a healthy fear of her disapproval or temper. He’s never seen it in the flesh, but even Mycroft looks haunted by the horror of having ever upset his mother.
“… and this is Carla Lloyd. She’s one of our website designers. Carla, this is Mike Baker from the San Francisco office. He’s here to oversee the new Swordfish Telecoms project until it goes live,” John’s guide said, still smiling despite the fact that he’d made this particular speech about twenty-five times already this morning.
"Nothing, Crispian. Not a thing. Which is more than I predict my brother will have to say to you on this matter."
“So,” he continues, then seems to lose the thread of his soliloquy once more before rallying. “Have I told you that you’re pretty? So pretty… no… handsome! Beautiful? Anyway, your eyes are… and your cheekbones should be illegal. And your hair, I want to touch it all the time, Sher-lock. All the time. Dig my fingers in it and… And your mouth… oh my god, your mouth. And even if you looked like the back end of a bus… which you don’t because of all the things on your face… even if you did, I would still love you ‘cause you’re the world’s only geniussss  cons’ltin’ detective but you still had no idea that I was in love with you this whole time.”
It's a role he cherishes and one that he would be loath to surrender, or forfeit on a gamble that they could be something more.
One morning John wakes to a sky that is unbroken blue in every direction and something inside him knows how those hedgerows feel. Coffee in hand, he steps out of the kitchen doors and the air, while still brisk and chilly feels more sympathetic, as if it might be swayed. The robin’s egg blue above is a fragile thing that encourages John to take a walk around the beds. The apple trees trained against the stone walls have tightly furled blossoms, white blushed with pink, and between the grass and weeds there are blue-green shoots, dark and purposeful.
"No, I don't have a preference," Sherlock says and shrugs at John's exasperated sigh.
John heart tumbles in his chest. He can’t believe that just a few weeks ago he’d thought Sherlock struggled with neuro-normative social interaction. With a single sentence, he’s just blown that theory out of the water - there’s so much to unpack from those few words and several levels on which to interpret them. Thankfully the answer on all levels is the same.
"And what the hell is
“Shall I come and find you?” Sherlock asks. At least if he’s out collecting John from wherever he has ended up, he can plausibly claim that there was patchy service on his phone. In Central London. Hmm. He might not get away with that one. Perhaps the liver fumes are getting to him.
“I thought that’s what you’d say,” Sherlock nodded, a smile spreading across his mouth slowly becoming soft as he turned John and nudged him toward the exit. “Time to go home then?”
There's no reply and John puts his phone down after ten minutes of waiting. The rest of the afternoon and evening seem to stretch out before him endlessly. It's madness - he didn't meet his madman until he was well into his thirties - what the hell did he do with all of those Sherlock-less hours? He doesn't want to call to see if anyone wants to meet him for a drink - first because he doesn't think that there's a place in the city that isn't full of couples tonight and secondly because anyone he does call is most likely part of one of those couples.
As he changes back into pyjamas, John tries to call Sherlock but an annoying female voice tells him that his number is currently unavailable and to try again later. She tells him the same thing the next three times he calls too. He checks the airports at Edinburgh and Glasgow but there is just a list of cancelled flights and no other real information. Making a cuppa to take to bed with him, he leaves the light on in the hallway on the off chance that Sherlock makes it home tonight. He's not hopeful, but there's nothing he can do about it.
"No," John says firmly. He lifts his chin and rests his tea on the arm of his chair. "There are things that I have said and done that have been... that have caused you pain. That was wrong of me. Some of those things I've done deliberately in retaliation for times I have felt hurt or let down by you, some were done selfishly and without concern for your wellbeing. Others I did without any conscious desire to cause you pain, but when I recognised that I had, I didn’t return to my error and correct it when I should have done. For all those things, Sherlock, for... for everything, I am truly sorry."
John is accustomed to waking soon after daybreak with the sun lightening his room gradually. He’s not so familiar with waking up with his mouth full of mad curls or a morning erection to match his own pressed into his thigh.
“Yes,” Mme Hudson agrees. “But he can't miss what he’s never had.”
John gives his bicep a squeeze. “Just breathe, okay? I’m here. We’re okay. We’re both okay.” His free hand grabs Sherlock by his good shoulder and he deftly turns them both, steering them back to the sitting room and down onto the sofa. He puts an arm around Sherlock and lets him lean in against his side.
Slowly, slowly he leans into John who stiffens further beneath Sherlock’s hands. But Sherlock bows his head gradually and as obviously as he can to rest his forehead against the top of John’s scalp.
Hitching his thumbs into the waistband, John paused to appreciate the true beauty that was Sherlock Holmes’s arse in jeans. Only the fact that he knew what lay beneath the denim caused him to cut short his ruminations and draw them slowly down over Sherlock’s hips and tug them to sit snugly under said gorgeous arse.
“I wasn’t trying to trick you – and if I were, you wouldn’t have realised that was my intention, by the way – I simply wondered whether you might like to accompany me on a weekend of observing how very ridiculous the upper classes can be – it usually amuses you. Are you not enjoying yourself?”
“Yes, John?”
That night he calls his sister unprompted and if they happen to touch on the whereabouts of the spades and garden forks and pots and garden supply shops, John doesn’t make a big deal of it. It wouldn’t do to encourage Harry’s meddling.
The view through the large glass door between the kitchen and the garden is a study in grey and brown. Harry only gave John a brief description of the house and its surroundings - John wasn’t really interested in the particulars at the time. The offer to live in his sister’s French holiday house has been a godsend. Home from Afghanistan for four months, John has been living in a soul-destroying bedsit provided by a grateful nation. He has no money other than his army pension, no job nor much prospect of finding one as damaged as he is and his only family is his alcoholic sister who is currently grinding through an awful divorce from her wife, Clara.
“He declined, of course,” Mycroft continues, his demeanour relaxed but his eyes never leaving John’s face.
Of course Sherlock had procured him an identical one the following week as a token of his admiration. It was amazing what almost losing each other could do for overcoming confused, tongue-tied longing. And John, in return for the gift, had felt he should teach Sherlock to kiss and then sucked his cock.
John heard the water stop as he called to Sherlock that he was running down to see Mrs Hudson but was unsurprised when he didn’t get an answer.
, John thinks. There are layers and layers of restraint that Sherlock has learned and maintained over years of relegating his body to being ‘transport’.
“This isn’t what I was wearing yesterday,”
"Yeah, of course. Thanks again for agreeing to come. I'm sorry it's been so long. It's... it's good to see you."
Wincing at the memory of it even now, John remembers last year and the ill-advised gift that he had given Sherlock. It had been half-joking and half-heartfelt when he'd noticed them and bought them on the spot, deciding that they were something Sherlock might like or at least give him a good giggle. He'd been utterly wrong on both points, of course. He'd never seen them again, after Sherlock's slightly bemused thanks, and they had never spoken of his miscalculation since.
“Come on. I need to explain,” Sherlock says after a long, thoughtful moment, his eyes widening slightly at whatever he has seen in John's ridiculously eloquent expression. He takes John by the arm, turning him toward the house, holding on as if he expects him to make a run for it. They pass unmarked through the kitchen and the dining room where people weave like dancers, complicated and controlled through their allotted tasks. Sherlock precedes John up the staircase to their room, tucked at the back of the house away from the noise and hurry of the preparations.
But there’s an intimacy and a connection when they rock together just so. No competition, no observations – it’s at moments like this that John feels closest to Sherlock. There’s no one to impress, his mind isn’t spinning wildly with possibilities and theories – this is them, loving each other because it’s the only way that everything else makes sense.
John bites his bottom lip. Sherlock can tell he’s tempted to believe that Sherlock hasn’t got this wrong, prays that John remembers that he once found Sherlock worthy of love, that he was attracted to him despite his protestations to the contrary after Sherlock shot him down within hours of their first meeting.
Greg clears his throat and looks a bit flustered, as does Mycroft strangely enough, but he is saved by the arrival of Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock grumbles at that but sits up and wriggles further back between John's thighs causing a wave of water to wash down the bath and swill over the edge of the tub and onto the floor with a sharp splash. He ignores it entirely and twists his head so his lips can touch John's. John cranes his neck and kisses him as deeply as he can at this angle, pouring his adoration and happiness into the touch of their tongues and the sweep of their lips. When they pause for breath, Sherlock works his neck, getting rid of the kink. John decides to take another tack with his demonstration.
John recognises the word for honey in the smaller text line
He scrabbled around in the kitchen then and managed to rustle up some tinned soup and cheese on toast. Anyone might have imagined that Sherlock would have had enough of being wet that day, but John had time to put his impromptu supper beside Sherlock’s chair and set a match to the fire he had laid earlier when he’d noticed the rain, which was still falling now and looking like it was a fixture.
Sherlock.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock merely grunts and tells John that they still have a couple of hours before the celebration starts, and they have been told to keep out of the way of the company hired to cater and organise the evening. So they take it in turns to use the adjoining bathroom, then decide to have a bit of a toes-up on their respective beds until it's time to dress for the party. John hasn't brought anything to read, so he takes down a copy of Swallows and Amazons that looks like it has seen some action.
Sherlock nods. “If you would excuse me for a moment…”
"Do you mind if we walk?" Sherlock asks and John agrees readily, rising carefully to his feet and walking stiffly inside to pay his bill.
And John is thinking himself in circles. One moment he's certain that Sherlock was about to admit to his attraction to John and the next he's equally as convinced that he's ruined everything and that Sherlock was finding the words to tell him that their partnership was over. The uncertainty is awful and John recognises his state of mind when Sherlock reaches over and carefully redistributes the six baubles John has crammed onto the same branch in his distraction.
John isn't surprised to learn that Sherlock has a mellow baritone and that he sings quietly, not even glancing at the lyrics on the sheet they are sharing. John is not so gifted and has to follow along, lifting his candle high enough for it to shed its barely sufficient light on the pages in his hand. He's glad they have started with
"... borrowed..."
"They turn you on," John interprets, his voice awed, and swallows as a wicked smirk twists the corner of Sherlock's mouth.
“Besides, Mrs Hudson won’t let me hear the last of it, if I come back without you again.”
And now Sherlock has to go.
“Not what–– not because I didn’t want… it. But because… too much. Scared,” he admits through gritted teeth.
“I did love her, once. In a way. I was… I’m not saying this to get at you, but I was not good for a while there. I was functioning – at the time that seemed like a good option. I worked and slept and watched TV and ate - that was about all. She was kind, persistently so, even when I didn’t deserve it. I suppose in a way we were both looking for a different life to the one we had been living.”
Sherlock looks on with his head and heart in uproar. Half an hour ago he was convinced that John was letting him down gently and now... he has no idea. Their laughter has washed away the despair that Sherlock was feeling and left him feeling hopeful and hollowed out and strangely happy. Even if he's been completely wrong about the likelihood of John becoming involved with him romantically, he knows that he has underestimated their friendship which has survived arguments, objectionable experiments,  homicidal criminal masterminds, injuries and absences. John is the most loyal friend he has ever known, and the fact that the loyalty is to Sherlock never ceases to amaze him and make him feel almost humble.
The clock marks less than thirty seconds before Sherlock stirs again.
There’s a thud from upstairs and it sounds like John’s voice sounding quite urgent, imploring Sherlock to…
"Yeah, but these ones actually fit you and aren’t filthy," John points out and decides he needs to change the subject now.
To be fair, John hasn't been with a guy in years - that's just the way it has turned out rather than a conscious choice. And then he met Sherlock and for the first time in a long time he's felt interest in a man for something more than a quick bit of stress relief. He’d known that Sherlock was something different straight away; he hadn't known how that would translate into him becoming the centre of John's world. He’s made his peace with that in the last couple of months, preparing himself for Sherlock to be the one who got away, the one who everyone who comes after will never measure up to.
John’s lips are warm and sweet from the wine, softer and more expressive than he had imagined. Sherlock varies the pressure and angle of their kisses, not out of dissatisfaction, but greedily trying to force several years worth of ideas into this opportunity. He finds he needs to voice his appreciation, in the same way that one might groan when sliding into a hot bath at the end of a cold day or moan when a greatly anticipated forkful of food is particularly delicious. John must agree because his hands tug more tightly and the slick brush of his tongue glances across Sherlock’s bottom lip, making him positively unsteady on his feet.
"Oh, nothing. I mean... no reason. Just asking."
“You must be pretty uncomfortable there,” John murmurs.
Sherlock’s attention is captured by John’s touches and there’s an expression on his face that John can’t quite place. “You’ve been looking at my music,” he says softly, which is not what John was expecting, but he concedes that it has played its part in this moment.
And angry.
"You want to..."
“Oh, lovely,” Mme Hudson beams as if John has just brought her the best news. “Not too isolated up there for you, is it? I hate to think of you stuck out there feeling lonely.”
“He really does think the world of you, John. Don’t be fooled by his manner or his little conceits.”
What does that even mean?
Crossing the short distance to the bench, John’s steps more laboured than ever, Sherlock's shoes click against the path in a rhythm syncopated with the softer footfalls of John's trainers.They both sit facing the lake far enough apart for comfort but close enough that people will know that they are together. John doesn’t waste any time, addressing the slate gray water as soon as they are both settled.
John’s jaw must have dropped, because Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and his head tilted for just a second before a pleased raise of his eyebrows and a slight smirk graced his face.
“Actually it’s my parent's wedding anniversary. Fifty years.” Sherlock smiles slightly.
“Hi! I had my phone updownside… up… down… er.”
“You don’t look tired. In fact… ahhh,” Sherlock breathed, a dark smirk tugging his lips to the right. “The jumper. This is another one of those normal people clothing things – you really do like me to dress down, don’t you?”
This cannot be allowed to happen… this is… what has he done? John is talking now and Sherlock forces himself to listen.
“Married to my work?” Sherlock admits, hearing how pretentious he’d sounded, and how convinced he’d been that he had no need of connection and understanding, let alone companionship and affection. “In my defence, you gave up very easily. One rehearsed sentence from me, and your position crumbled.”
Down in the garden, the tall man from the Manoir is standing with his back to the house contemplating one of the trees John worked on yesterday. He has on a long, blue coat that looks too expensive to be in John’s garden, tidy or not,  and a pair of shiny leather shoes that probably cost more than the coat did. Unfortunately the man in the inappropriate wardrobe choices is stamping around in the bed that John seeded with leeks two days ago, with forays into the potato trenches that John prepared yesterday for planting once his seed potatoes had chitted.
“I told you – they don’t expect presents. Besides you’ll make my lack of a gift look even less admirable,” Sherlock repeats.
Sherlock’s eyes flicker over to John. His shoulders are tense and he licks his lips as he slowly breathes out.
>>><<<
He thumbed his phone open and didn’t even pretend that he wasn’t going to. There were two messages waiting for him.
"Sorry. I didn't mean to... I just wanted you to understand that my problems with who I am didn't start with you. But you've had the brunt of my... issues... because you're the first one that... that has mattered."
He still missed that gun, but Mycroft had insisted.
John takes pity on him. If it’s difficult confessions that are tonight’s topic, then John has plenty.
The next kiss is bolder; sweeter and deeper. Sherlock tips his head so he can find an angle he likes. His hand strokes down John’s neck and shoulder carefully, as if expecting to be stopped. Slowly it burrows beneath the blankets to press into the centre of his chest, feeling his heart rate but being distracted by the short sparse hairs there.
Finding a particularly pleasing curl, John twines it around his index finger and watches it spring back again and again while Sherlock blinks back the wetness welling along his bottom eyelashes.
When the dessert has been cleared, Sherlock's father stands up and makes a very pretty speech about spending his birthday with so many people he loves and with such a talented group. John smiles and feels increasingly out of place as it becomes clear that Sherlock's dad is, in fact, a very highly regarded musician and that many of the people who he is sharing a table with are famous names in their respective fields. If they are not family, then they all seem to be involved in the performing arts in some way; a couple of opera singers, a specialist in medieval music, a composer - the list goes on, all the information provided sotto voce by Sherlock or Crispian.
As he replaces the last sheet he notices that this one is written in pencil, the notes scattered across the page in Sherlock’s unmistakable, hurried hand. This must be the composition that he’s been working on recently and John struggles to follow the melody with skills that he hasn’t used in twenty years. He flips the page and realises that he’s been reading the second page, because there, at the top of the page with the time signature and key is a single word.
Sherlock’s brain meltdown seems to be complete. He stands and blinks at John until the other man starts to give him a wary look.
Bringing the package indoors, after swearing at the sticking door, he places it on the table. Harry’s writing is large and loopy and already irritating.  He sits for a minute or two, preparing himself for what cheerful, upbeat gesture the box might contain - his sister is one of those people who is convinced that all a person with mental health issues needs is for others to be extra enthusiastic around them. As Harry no longer has Clara around to dilute her forceful personality, John has borne the full brunt of Harry’s helpfulness over the last few months and he’s exhausted by it. He just wants to feel nothing; to feel numb until he has a better option. He thought that here he might be able to achieve that. He’s tried to explain that depression and PTSD aren’t things that you can solve with willpower alone, but in the face of her own unmanageable struggles, she has decided that she needs to fix him. He loves Harry in that half dutiful, half genuine way that siblings do as they get older, but she can no more save John he can save her - it doesn’t stop her trying though.
John shifts his knees and flops back onto the bed, wiping the incriminating evidence off on Sherlock’s posh bedding. Covering his eyes with his clean(er) hand, he laughs between gasps for air. His heart hasn’t even stopped trying to beat its way out of his ribcage yet.
"You might think the timing a little unorthodox, but this choice of date seems to have worked rather well for my parents - they seem to still like each other, at least. "
It’s not what Sherlock was expecting to hear and he gives himself a mental shake, reordering his thoughts and chiding himself for assumptions. He tries to stop the lurching dive his stomach takes, thinking perhaps he misread the mistletoe incident. He’d been so certain that John’s reactions were along the lines of his own, to whit, “Finally!” But maybe that unexpected act was all the reassurance John had needed to know that his return to his wife was long overdue.
“No? What’s no?” John huffs. There’s something uncomfortably close to pity in his voice when he speaks. “You think you’re attracted to me but believe me, you’re not. Think, Sherlock! You don’t do this. You’ve never been interested in… You’re ‘married to your work’, do you remember that? Relationships ‘aren’t your area’? When those explosives went up you suffered a significant head injury that caused trauma to your brain, scrambling everything up. It hasn’t even been a fortnight since that injury. You are not behaving in a manner that might be called characteristic for you. The fact that you,
Sherlock types.
John thanks his stars that the house, at least, has been kept up. It is basic and a little rough around the edges and it lacks the attention to detail that second homes sometimes do - although furnished, it’s clear that no one has lived here for a long time. But it is his home now and for the foreseeable future - provided Clara doesn’t claim it from the wreckage of their marriage or they sell it by rare mutual consent.
“I told you -you don’t have to worry about it. It’s not your fault - you didn’t do anything that…”
It is terrifying beyond Sherlock’s comprehension of the word.
“She was out of options. She couldn’t think of another route out of that room that wouldn’t implicate her or you.”
"Excuse me?" John's almost certain he felt something pop in his brain. Though a skilled medical professional, he briefly wonders if people can die of irritation and, if so, how many peeved-looking corpses Sherlock must have left in his considerable wake.
He shuffles into the corner of the sofa, depositing his booty next to their mugs and picking up the TV remote. In his home scented jumper and socked feet, he looks like the epitome of the perfect Sunday and Sherlock is hit with a sudden rush of gratitude.
question. He gives John a quick rundown of his latest cases, expanding on any that he shows a particular interest in and it’s almost as if no time has passed. John's nods and questions are noticeably more genuine now they are on firmer ground and when Sherlock rounds off a recount of his most recent solve, John sits back in his armchair for the first time.
Sherlock’s eyes slip shut and together they drift back to sleep.
He’s been standing outside the door for what feels like hours, long enough for his feet to feel numb despite the mildness of the night air.
Mme Hudson is gone as quickly as she came, waiving off money for the groceries and disappearing in a spray of gravel. John is left with a list of local market days, telephone numbers for doctors, dentists, plumbers and electricians, churches of all denominations and the bank in the nearest town. He has directions to the best charcuterie, the post office and the telephone number of Le Manoir de Saint Barthélemy who own the land adjoining his sister’s.
His friend is rarely playful these days and John knows better than to let the opportunity pass.
“I’m just popping out for some air,” Sherlock says, his voice rough. He takes advantage of John’s distraction, knowing how hard it would be to leave while John watched.
John hums at the touch and Sherlock feels it vibrate through his lips. He sucks gently at the nape of his neck and John arches his back, easing Sherlock deeper still.
“Oh, we’re talking about Sussex?” John asks absently. His attention is divided between Sherlock’s attempts at conversation and the pan which is beginning to bubble quite alarmingly.
“Sherlock… no. I’m… First of all, I’m hardly a paragon of virtue myself. Any allowances I might make for you will be equalled by the ones you make for me, I’m sure. And secondly, I’m hardly going into this blind. I know you. In fact I’m prepared to say that no one knows you better. This isn’t a golden goal situation.”
“Not just
“Just once.”
The thing about fatigues was that despite being designed for and being adequate at concealing your whereabouts in arid, desert-like environments, they were very distinctive in urban London. Particularly when they were wrapped around the hips of your bored boyfriend who had neglected to fasten the button fly in favour of sliding his hand beneath the waistband instead. The picture was grainy and underexposed and must have been taken from close to Sherlock’s hip. If he squinted, John could make out the shape of the soft, ruddy hairs that trailed from Sherlock’s navel down to where it became coarser and darker. John loved to ghost kisses over those hairs and feel them brush against his mouth.
>>>>><<<<<
He hates feeling like this. He hates doubting Sherlock’s intentions or his honesty, but one glance around the garden is enough to tell John that this party is not just an excuse for a family gathering - it’s an event of some kind, and it’s one Sherlock has decided that John’s own clothes are not suited to.
Sherlock sighs, but John holds up his hands to pause his retort.
"So that's why I'm here. I'm trying to atone for the way I treated you and I'm hoping that..."
There are a couple of train tickets to Exeter from their case on Dartmoor. There's a bill from the nice restaurant they went to when they were staking out an address in Marylebone. There's the copy of John's birth certificate, which he still doesn't know how Sherlock acquired. There's a rough map he drew to explain to Sherlock where he'd been when he was shot, then a couple more press cuttings.
"And he is very cordially invited to join us. It's an hour or two of singing Sherlock, not a death sentence."
There
It took all his strength and a stern word with himself not to leap over the desks and hug the brilliant love of his life, kiss him senseless and scandalise the entire office in the process, to say nothing of blowing his cover out of the water.
“We might not be an obvious match, but we chose each other and modified ourselves, made compromises – decided the other was worth making the effort for. And after all that, you’re still a sulky drama queen and I’m still a grumpy old bastard, so still recognisably ourselves. I think we’re pretty damn perfect for each other, Sherlock Holmes.”
This is not his room.
Laughing at the distress on Sherlock’s face at the horrific thought of mixed fibres, John got up from his chair and pressed a quick, fond kiss to his cheek. “You’re such a princess,” he told him. “It wouldn’t kill you to wear something other than Saville Row, once in a while. Even your dressing gowns are pretentious! And who needs more than one dressing gown?”
Sherlock was a beautiful man and John had told him that enough times that he was beginning to believe it. He was also a massive show-off, and the combination of those two things was paying dividends for John right then because Sherlock was
"I've answered your questions," John says, affecting a teasing tone. "Now you tell me something."
“Taste,” John demands, brandishing a wooden spoon, and it’s an expression of how very distracted Sherlock is that he hadn’t even noticed John coming to him.
“He said I wasn’t worthy of you, that he was going to fix it and then you’d see he’d been right.”
"So do you know anyone else here?" she asks, turning toward the party.
"Let's go and find out what they are then," John agrees, standing.
It begins boisterously, shoving and jockeying for supremacy but within seconds it is something else entirely. John’s shoulders drop, and his mouth softens, fitting their lips together as a tiny involuntary noise sighs from John’s mouth to Sherlock’s.
John’s arse is a solid handful, soft short hairs rising to prickle against his palm as his fingers spread and reach into the heat between his cheeks. His hole is still slightly puffy from last night’s fucking, but John doesn’t pull away or grunt as Sherlock’s fingers slowly circle their prize. The easy glide and lack of resistance bode well for… ah, yes. John is still loosened and open from Sherlock’s cock finding its home right here last night and he cannot help but delight at the ease with which he presses two fingers into John’s hole, finding a welcome in the warm, slick embrace of…
Sherlock’s eyes are hooded with bliss still from his recent orgasm, but they glitter with curiosity as John takes a handful of himself and works his foreskin to cover and reveal the shining head of his cock a few times before he sets himself a bruising pace, sinking into his heels and pushing his thighs apart, tucking them beneath Sherlock’s.
One of them has to take the next step and he’s not a coward. An idiot, yes, but not a coward.
When Sherlock glances across at a now quiet John, he is looking at his hands again.
This, for Sherlock, is love. He abhors the saccharine, is suspicious of romance and derides those who have used the word love with too heavy a hand, cheapening and diluting its meaning and import. But this simple act, their wordless understanding and their perfect union fulfils a need in Sherlock that he has no words for and never expected to find within himself.
“There – a shock blanket for two. That’s what paramedics always try to do to me whenever they’re attending a crime scene.”
“Hey! You found me!”
"What?"
"I found myself fixating on and... I suppose you would call it fantasising about someone. It came as something of a surprise to me."
It’s not a beginning; that was years ago in a lab at Bart’s. Nor an end - no one can know when that might be. This is them, and maybe it’s a new component to their eternally complicated relationship; they are old dogs and these are new tricks, and it remains to be seen how well they can learn them. But he is definitely still John Watson, doctor, soldier, and writer of a popular blog and terrible poetry, and the man at his side is the world’s only consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, and they’re together in 221B Baker Street. Because that is where they belong and that is how this story will
He drops the books back into the box, closes the whole thing up and takes it into the strange little room at the back of the house that seems to be a laundry, cloakroom and shed all in one. He dumps the box on the rickety table there and closes the door firmly behind him as he leaves.
John blinks, the muscles of his right side objecting to the loss of heat and support. He smiles tightly in return, swallowing in a dry mouth. Did Sherlock feel that? Can Sherlock’s uncanny skills have uncovered something that John has taken such pains to obscure? Something that he has struggled to acknowledge, even in the quietest places of his mind?
It’s not even a long walk from the next closest tube station to Baker Street (despite all the engineering works…thank you so much, Transport for London) but John’s feet are already like blocks of ice, and his nose and ears are numb. He still smiles to himself though, when he hears the sound of Sherlock’s violin from a few houses short of the familiar glossy, black-painted door. It’s not a famous piece, but it pricks at his memory as if he ought to know it. Maybe it’s from an advert or one of Sherlock’s that he’s been working on in one of his random creative phases – John doesn’t have an ear for music, as Sherlock is fond of telling him.
this is an excellent idea – really top class idea. One of the finest ideas I’ve ever known,” he breathes quickly. He looks ridiculously young all at once, his eyes wide and a small smile on his kissed-pink lips. “I meant… you were borderline hypothermic two hours ago and, added to your condition at the hospital, I wonder if now is the time to…”
Vaguely, John is aware that he’s talking bollocks. This isn’t what Sherlock is asking because that conversation happened before Mycroft’s call, or… What was the question again?
Too ambiguous.
“In my mind palace.”
Clearly he had not anticipated Mme Hudson, an expat whose heart is as big as her unintentional intrusiveness.
He carefully lets go of Sherlock’s cock, sits back on his heels and dips a slow, soft finger into one of the cooling drops that pattern Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock’s eyes watch, in rapture as John brings the finger to his lips to taste. Sherlock looks fascinated, so John swipes a forefinger through a tiny pool that has slid into Sherlock’s navel and lifts it to Sherlock offering it against his lips.
John sighs, trying to keep his muscles loose and relaxed, and his breathing even. Sherlock might think he’s stealthy and full of cunning, but John knows him better than he knows himself. For instance, he knows that Sherlock would actually do anything for Mrs Hudson, despite being outrageously rude to her at every opportunity. He knows that Sherlock doesn’t often make the tea, not because he’s lazy, but because the novelty of someone caring for him enough to want to make him happy still hasn’t worn off. And he knows that Sherlock is so surprised to find himself in love with John that it scares him into thinking that he needs to trick him into a thing that John would give freely… happily, even.
"Wait for what?"
With his dramatic looks and his austere suits, John used to think that Sherlock's style was all flat planes and hard angles, but when Sherlock plays it softens him. John's known him long enough to realise that the Sherlock Holmes persona is simply that - a persona that his flatmate puts on and takes off as needed. John has since seen the other things that Sherlock is; kind, funny, mischievous - and yes, sulky and bratty and spoiled too. He feels the privilege of having seen all the things that Sherlock is - it's not everyone that gets that close. Or anyone else, actually. So maybe his feelings for his flatmate are understandable - maybe he's not as much of an idiot as he thinks he is - it doesn't seem to help him though. He's still in love with the oblivious bugger and he doesn't even know whether Sherlock knows the meaning of the word - not in the sense that John means, anyway.
) that Sherlock cannot possibly miss it. Yet somehow, he seems to.
John rubs a hand over his chin and thinks. Sherlock is clearly waiting for him to lead the way on this. He doesn't know if that is his lack of relationship experience or something else... nerves, maybe? Or is he trying to give all the control here to John for John's sake, to make him feel less pressured? If he is making the calls then they are going to go at a pace that he dictates, but that’s strangely out of character for Sherlock who always leads from the front.
John looks mildly surprised, then beams at him, and only then notices the smoke and angry spitting noises coming from his pan. “Ah, shit…”
pyjamas!”
“Then sex?” Sherlock asks, his hopes flickering more and more dimly when he calculates how many hours are left in today.
He continues to have no words. Not ones he’d accept, anyway.
, and John gives him an exasperated glare.
Sherlock tries to explain the bowing action, he tries to demonstrate the pressure of the bow on the string, he tries to encourage John to press harder on some elusive spot that John could not find if he had a map. Sherlock mocks him with warmth in his eyes. John retaliates by selectively disregarding instructions while smiling innocently.
“Yes, and if I’ve learned one thing about him, it’s that if you want to know something about him, you’ll have to ask him yourself!”
“Love of my life, yes.”
“But what about dinner?” John calls over his shoulder, madly stirring and adjusting the heat.
As a teenager he thought that he and Ginger Spice might have had a shot at a happily forever after; he’d always had a thing for redheads. That wasn’t to say that he hadn’t had something of a crush on Brad Pitt – he must have watched Seven every week for a year. But neither of them hold a candle to the lanky git whose breaths he can feel moving the hairs on the back of his neck.
"You're too short, Watson."
“I’ve dreamed of this,” Sherlock told him, his thrusts becoming slower and less co-ordinated. “Your mouth on me. It’s even better than I remembered, John.”
John has a sudden image of Sherlock’s beautiful body hidden under pinstripes or tweed, and he shudders. No… just no.
Sherlock touches his own ribs and gestures towards him, watching now as John cautiously relaxes back, his face softening when the expected pain doesn’t come.
“Ah, love, what you do to me,” John groaned, his voice gravelly and desperate. He began to undress, his fingers fumbling in their haste.
“I’m… the…”
"Hold still, you daft bugger, " John growls and finally Sherlock catches on, sliding ungracefully but safely down John's body.
Hudders and John discuss banalities; Christmas movies and family traditions. Sherlock accepts the offer of a glass of red wine (an excellent Saint-Émilion, at the perfect temperature) and listens with half an ear, relishing the warmth of John pressed all down his side, the fullness of his laughter and the way he unconsciously angles himself to fill the spaces that Sherlock has left between them until they overlap and the boundaries between them blur.
Crispian straightens up like a jack-in-the-box and grins broadly at the surprise on Sherlock's face, then leans in to switch on the shower and pull off his own jeans.
Now they have returned to Baker Street, John seems to be rebuilding the walls even stronger and higher than they were before. After the support and open devotion he showed while Sherlock was in hospital, he has scaled back his attentions and even been deliberately avoiding him for some period each day since their return. Sherlock isn’t sure whether that’s because he is sick of the sight of him, is giving him some breathing space after a week of almost constant monitoring or for some other reason that Sherlock has been unable to discern. Perhaps he is just profoundly rattled by being targeted by such a madman as Moriarty? Sherlock had picked up on the man’s irritation over his fascination with the master criminal but been unable to ascertain the reason. Perhaps the two points are linked?
"What has changed?" Sherlock asks gently, hearing the plea in his voice although he doubts John can.
“Sherlock would say anything if he thought that was what you wanted, dear,” Martha says, softly now.
"You should try having my birthdate. I was born on the 6th of January; twelfth night. It's the date..."
“How many luthier’s do you know?” Mycroft asks, interlacing his fingers and smiling blandly.
“Tre... no.
Undeterred, he grabs the teapot from the chair and, stepping to the side of the window, he brings it round in a wide arc and closes his eyes as it impacts on the glass. He feels the percussive force move through his wrist and elbow and into his shoulder as the teapot shatters.
. That should tell you all you need to know.  And that’s okay. It’s not your fault. I understand.”
Around and around and around he goes.
“Yeah, I know how that feels,” John laughs, sitting back from the screen and actually looking at him this time.
"Oh, I don't know, perhaps that you watch him all the time when he's not looking? That you shorten your stride so he can walk beside you? That you actually bother to listen to him as you do no one else? Or maybe just that you are madly in love with him."
Bathroom cabinet, toothbrush, toothpaste, water. Pause.
“I ought to get you to wash and iron my fatigues before I put them away again, “ John warned.
think you’re here?” John counters, his mouth mostly obscured by the fingers of the palm he has propped his chin on, only half his attention on Sherlock’s plaintive question. “You’re the cleverest man in London.
"You will need to be quiet though, John. Mycroft's room is right across the hall."
While Hudders opens a present from them, which seems to meet with her approval, Sherlock is surreptitiously watching John. For some reason he seems quite moved by the journal. His eyes keep straying to it and his fingers idly stroke the cover, over and over. There’s something he’s missing about this gift, but he can’t quite see what.
Both he and John look up to see the bunch of mistletoe they had so courageously fought for balanced on the lowest bough of the tree, right above their heads. It's the work of a moment to bend down, pick up the loppers and hook it out of the tree and into John's waiting hands.
She doesn’t wait; she has said her piece. She rises from John’s chair with a brief grimace of discomfort.
They work quietly, decorating the Christmas tree in its place of honour beside the fireplace. The lights are already twined around the branches and now they are taking the fragile glass ornaments out of tissue wrappers and hanging them on the branches, doing their best to make it look even. John doesn't have high hopes on it being up to Mrs Holmes's standards, as Sherlock seems to be sorting them by colour and size, making it look like a science project rather than a festive centrepiece. John is just hanging them on the branches he can reach. Sherlock seems to recognise this and with a small apologetic glance at John, he takes the painted glass bauble out of John's hand and reaches above him to hang it on the highest part of the tree.
“Oh! Fuck! Ohhhh!” Sherlock sighed, gave three harder thrusts and came, the concentrated flavour of him bursting across John’s palate. He had no hope of swallowing it all with the force that Sherlock pulsed into his mouth, although he tried. But then his own release was on him, his cock jerking in his hand as he came in wracking, straining waves of pleasure.
Ah... I seem to have missed my Twelfth night target by a bit of a stretch, but here is the final chapter. Thank you to everyone who has read and commented and kudosed! I very much appreciate your support.
"Can't be helped," John mutters and he has to swallow again when Sherlock's neck arches from the sensation of his hand on his hardness. "But I wish you were here all the same."
He’s ignored.
Breathing in audibly, Mycroft begins. “Father is fine, sleeping now and all indications are that he will heal with no complications. Mummy and I are going home and will be back here in the morning… later in the morning. When you are ready there is a car and driver at your disposal at the Giltspur Street entrance.”
Martha Hudson is also rather alarmingly capable of  a devastating withering look, one of which she deploys now to great effect, so Sherlock looks away, unable to meet the combination of disbelief and compassion it becomes.
“Sh... Sherlock, oh…GOD…” John jolted as Sherlock hummed against his skin in appreciation. It took some serious effort for him to put together a coherent sentence when Sherlock was breathing him in, teasing him with the slightest, most gentle kisses.
The light wherever he is,  is a horrible yellow and it highlights Sherlock's face all wrong. There's a lot of background noise too but at least the video signal is beginning to settle.
Sherlock’s just getting to the part where he will have to bury his hands in his hair and begin to look incredulous, so John pre-empts that with, “Right, I suppose you’ve never been bad at something in your life?”
“Only in that he bought me vodka chasers for the beers I was drinking,” John admits, a little shamefaced.
Sherlock isn't in the kitchen, but one of the wait staff sees him looking and tips his head in the direction of the garden door. Sure enough, Sherlock's tall shape is a darker shadow against the night, only his pale face is clear in the cold foggy air. It's all a bit surreal, Sherlock, the thick fog and the way that the lantern light from beside the  kitchen door mixes with the water droplets and seems to move like waves as the fog thickens and thins in the sluggish evening air.
the way John might like him to.
And John is a soldier. He is a doctor. He is a grown man and he does not cry when his boyfriend looks like an angel and tells him he loves him, damn it! He does not cry! He might be slightly blinded by the sunlight, he might even have an allergy to the feathers in Sherlock's posh pillows, but the dampness welling along the line of his lashes is not tears.
“I could have sworn it was on here,” Mme Hudson mutters for the third time. She peers at the offending collection of keys in the light from John’s phone and tuts.
John feels suddenly wide-awake, craning around to look at Sherlock’s tired, bloodshot eyes and his creased shirt. The blanket drops away letting the cool air reach John’s shoulders.
Sherlock is very glad he’s a genius. John’s mangled ramblings this evening have taxed even his linguistic skills.
Nights like those are intense, treasured and memorable. They are a way of dispelling excess energy, a celebration of their unconventional life together, a shelter from the days that go bad and a declaration of their partnership – just them against the world.
The next time Sherlock is aware of anything, he’s disappointed to find himself standing in their sitting room. It appears this is where he always ends up, like a counter on a game board having to go back to the beginning as a penalty.
The curtains hadn’t yet been drawn back and the light of the overcast day was too feeble to make much of a difference where it slid into the room.
"And I'm sure the donkeys will be grateful for that," Mycroft says sagely. "So, half past six?”
John shrugs and smiles ruefully. “It went better than last time. He didn’t insult me and show me out this time at least.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock looks away. “And what do you think now?”
He hears the words, but there is no sense behind them; he feels that he should know what they mean, but he cannot access the necessary memories. He presses his fingers against his mouth and feels them tremble, hating the frailty that betrays but understanding that this is unlike any experience he has endured before and his illusions of control are simply that – illusions.
This is why Sherlock doesn’t ‘do’ people. Without the addition of criminal intent their motivations are hideously difficult to decode.
John is very, very inebriated. That’s funny usually, but bad in this case.
Muttering some appropriately inappropriate words for his high-maintenance menace under his breath John put down his shopping basket so he could use both hands to type his reply, but another message came in before he had time.
“Why haven’t you bothered to learn any French?”
And now Sherlock is shaking his head. It's an instinctive reaction and one that is all too easy for John to misinterpret.
John doesn’t want to do anything that might remind Sherlock that he is in bed with him in a rather compromising situation in case it unnerves the man, but he cannot help but sigh himself further into Sherlock’s arms. Just a bit. Except...
John listened intently and once he was happy they were in no danger of being discovered, he nipped at the fleshy pad of Sherlock’s fingertip.
"Ditto," Sherlock murmurs. “I wasn’t sure if your sister…”
“You’re okay, love,” John tells him, his voice warm and soothing. “It’s okay, Sherlock. I’m here.”
“It's immaterial,” Sherlock shrugs. “He said what he needed to say. Things have moved on and so has he. There’s nothing more to add. He’s fine. I’m fine. Everything is fine. And now, I’m rather busy, so if you...”
>>><<<
The sky darkens quickly and the trees, still all day, begin to mutter and thrash as the winds rise. The first drops of rain are fat and sparse, but within three minutes they are falling with steady determination. John turns on the radio he normally carries into the garden with him and tries to find some music, but all he can find tonight are hiss and crackle. He tells himself that he’s a grown man and that he hasn’t ever been afraid of thunder before. He tells himself to pull his shit together and to get a grip.
"There used to be some younger trees that weren't quite so..." Sherlock turns on the spot. "Ah, there! Between us we should be able to get up high enough to reach that one with the loppers."
John is still awake when Sherlock finally comes up to bed. He's very quiet and doesn't give more than a corner of a smile when John greets him. Deeply engrossed in Swallows and Amazons, John hasn't bothered to get into bed yet. It's quite snug in their room and he's comfortable lying on top of the covers in his pyjama bottoms and t-shirt.
“Any of them, all of them, I don’t care… just… yes.”
"Look, I don't know what you're trying to imply, but unless I'm much mistaken, he's a grown man and he can make his own decisions. I didn't coerce him into talking to me this evening, and as to whether he's interested or not, or even knows that I'm gay, I don't see that it's any of your business. Or perhaps..." Crispian's fine features sharpen and his eyes light with understanding. "Oh! Maybe I do know what your problem is after all.
With the gift of hindsight, John knows that this is the bit he will wish that he’d been awake for, because when he opens his eyes again, he’s in his pyjamas, lying on some quilts and tucked under more layers of blankets and bedspreads than he knew they owned. Sherlock is dressed in his own pyjamas next to him on the floor, lit by the glow of the phone in hand. John doesn’t move, just breathes in the warm, Sherlock-scented air and ponders whether that’s from the blankets or from his proximity.
Sherlock just shrugs, but the accompanying quirked smile is enough to make John's happiness swell again.
"I... I don't deserve a second chance, I know that and... If I knew then what I know now, if I had faced up to all the lies and the shame and the justifications I fed myself when I was with you..." John sighs and tips his head back to face the sky.
“Well, it’s certainly more Möet, De Beers and Armani than I’ve ever seen in a field before.”
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him and extends the pyjamas to him again, before he sighs and sets about unlacing John’s boots.
“Who’s that?” Mrs Hudson asks.
A peace offering or a lover’s gift, John wonders?
John sighs and seems to come back to himself. His gaze sharpens as he turns to Sherlock, who realises too late that he's riveted to John's voice and his story, and it has to show on his face. He’s never heard John reference his own sexuality in those terms before - only what he isn’t (gay), which he’d been rather vocal about when the occasion arose. Sherlock blinks at him.
“Well, we both know that’s not true,” Martha scoffs and John blinks, startled. She’s learned that the older she gets the more blunt she can be without getting called out for it. John is a good man, and more importantly he’s good for Sherlock, but he does need a kick up the arse every now and again. They both do.
Sherlock must know he’s here, although he shows no sign of acknowledgement. It’s dark despite the tangerine smear of the streetlights – the bedroom window doesn’t face the street and the sodium glow is muted, but it’s enough to see the pale sprawl of his naked body, the covers kicked into a careless heap at the end of the bed. His eyes are closed; his breathing is deep and a little fast as his hand works between his spread thighs, stroking himself with desperate, deliberate intensity.
Sherlock glances over at his friend. John looks sombre but steady.
“If I’d known normal clothes were going to look like this on you, I would never have said a word,” John admitted a few long breathless kisses later, lingering over Sherlock’s lips, reluctant to lose contact even though his own need was a persistent, nagging ache by now.
“But what are you going to do now?” Sherlock asks. “I still have questions.”
’, John is lost. Whatever it is she is saying, it seems to involve him signing for a large box with his sister’s London address on it in case of return. At least that’s what he hopes he signed. The post lady seems content, so he waves her off.
” And this is stellar work, really, by Sherlock. Worth every penny his parents paid for him to attend (however reluctantly) the most expensive schools in the country. Debating team material, without doubt.
It is indeed a lovely blue, not cornflower or sky, but something more complex. It’s the blue of something that Sherlock can’t put his finger on until John leans over to test the fabric.
…lube. Lots and lots of lube. Sherlock is a skilful lover but he’s well-endowed enough that John makes certain that he is sufficiently prepped so that if Sherlock’s trademark impatience comes into play during their fun, the experience will be more pleasurable than not.
“Dog, you mean,” Sherlock corrects automatically. John knows! It’s an actual fixed point on their shared horizon. The contentment and joy he felt while watching their garden is going to be their life at some undetermined point in their future… the future of this John and this Sherlock.
"You've lived together for how long now? A year and a half? Don't you think you should have told him? Don't you think that if there was something there, it would have shown itself by now? That it would have happened already if it was going to?"
John's grip on reality seems to be quite tenuous  - or is Mycroft bringing him tea?
John laughs, but doesn’t give up trying to follow the increasingly exasperated instructions until finally Sherlock strides around behind him and lays his own right arm along the length of John’s, wraps a large, narrow hand over his and starts to bow for him. The pillock is tall enough that he can easily see over John’s shoulder and he recites the fingering to him as they play. “Cee, cee, gee, gee – third string, third finger, no,
Any weariness is forgotten. John cannot resist, no matter that he knows he should. Sherlock’s focussed attention is something he seldom achieves and something he still guiltily craves despite everything that’s happened. He stands up, accepts the violin from Sherlock’s hands and tucks it under his jaw. The chinrest is still warm and it’s unexpectedly intimate in a way that rushes sweetly beneath John’s skin from his crown to his heels. The wood of the instrument seems to still be vibrating from Sherlock’s playing, eager and easy, and John needs to take a breath suddenly.
“Maybe so, but sound carries very efficiently,” John muttered as the shrill ringing of a phone was abruptly silenced.
John looked up, caught instantly by his boyfriend’s sharp, assessing gaze. “’M fine,” John croaked. He hemmed, “Yeah, fine. Been a bit of a long day.”
Crispian takes a breath and then pauses to  look speculatively at John for a moment. He catches Sherlock's narrowed gaze, a small knowing smile gracing his handsome face. Damn him.
Sherlock has hoarded the memories of these weeks together, watching their number dwindle as the sun set earlier and earlier each evening. Sometimes he could even forget that this wasn’t their future, when the fire burned low in the grate as they talked late into the night or made each other their breakfast tea and toast.
John had said that he wasn’t leaving this room, but he needs to come with Sherlock. They need to at least try to escape. They can’t stay here; something is trying to trap them in here. Clearly the danger is palpable only to himself, and he does not know how to make John understand the certainty of his beliefs.
And suddenly they cannot hold it back any longer ; they are giggling like idiots - knowing they shouldn't, but unable to stop the swell of mirth that bubbles up and causes them to shake with inappropriate laughter. Every time one of them manages to stop, the other grins and off they go again. Mummy and Father are looking at them with mild alarm, which sets off another gale of chuckles until they are both breathless and teary, at which point Mummy informs them that she had no idea that donkeys were so amusing and that they need to be ready in ten minutes.
Sherlock’s mouth is exactly as John imagined, soft, full and tentative. He wants to grasp Sherlock’s head and spend an hour learning the shape of his top lip, pull it into his own mouth and find the key to its perfection, where this softness gives way to stubble, how his cupid’s bow tastes and whether it’s as prominent when he kisses as when he speaks. And then repeat the whole thing with his bottom lip. But Sherlock is clearly uncomfortable, his body rigid with stress everywhere but his lips it would seem. He’s unpredictable – an unknown, so John keeps his eyes shut and lets him learn at his own pace. He lets his own lips part, just the tiniest bit to carefully let Sherlock know he’s with him in this.
gone an awfully long time, John,” Sherlock explained in a voice that reminded John how utterly desperate he was to bury himself in the very sweetness that was currently filled by a plug that John had bought a week ago to gauge Sherlock’s reaction to adding sex toys to their repertoire but had yet to find the right moment to introduce. Apparently Sherlock had decided that for them in his usual inimitable manner and John couldn’t find it in himself right then to be annoyed.
“Grateful,” he croaks honestly. He clears his throat and yawns trying to cover his embarrassment. He hopes he didn’t make a complete arse of himself last night. He wonders how Sherlock has got involved in this at all.
On his way out of Sherlock's room John passes the dresser that Sherlock uses to deposit his keys, wallet and the day’s haul of pickpocketed items. Both wallet and keys are still there, but they are not what has caught John's eye. In a room devoid of knick-knacks and clutter, the pile of paper stands out and John pauses.
“People aren’t perfect, dear - they make the wrong choices for the right reasons and vice versa. He’s made mistakes…”
(If you guessed 'each other' you get ten house points! )
Shifting his hips provocatively, Sherlock hummed and let his fingers stroke a little higher that time, so they ghosted over his cock before returning to knead the muscles of his thighs.
The inescapable conclusion is that the person he is conversing with is certainly not not the John Watson from Sherlock’s reality, not the real John with his conflicts and demons and his predictable quips and his sarcasm and his veneer of sociability. No, this is a John Watson that Sherlock has, for some reason, fabricated himself. A John that has resolved all his contradictions and uncertainties. A John that, however inexplicably, would appear to love him openly.
By the time he falls into bed that night John has gone all the way around and is back to being irritated again. Who does Holmes think he is, roaming all over other people’s property and making scarily accurate pronouncements about people he has never met before? And then winking at them? Cheeky bastard.
"On the train. I managed to get a berth on the overnight sleeper. We only departed a quarter of an hour ago."
rather than real relationships.
Sherlock's expression, teasing only seconds before, warms and relaxes. John stares helplessly into the ever-shifting palette of Sherlock's unguarded gaze, almost silver in this light and the mood softens. Wrestling and quips certainly have their place in their relationship, but not here and not now. The significance and magnitude of what they are about to do is not lost on them - they have fought for this love, hoped for such a moment but never taken their good fortune for granted. Of all the people in the world that they may have fallen in with in their lives, the fact that it was each other, the serendipity of the moment they met, takes them unawares.
Sherlock is beautiful like this. Finally, here at the point of combustion and with mesmerising intensity, he burns and John knows that he will too if he touches him, but...
Sherlock gives him a withering glance.
For Sherlock it will be the way John's eyes shone the first time he called him
Sherlock sighs. “Then sex? Or kissing at least!”
"It's very good of you to help. Mummy and Father will be so grateful."
“Hmm?” Sherlock blinks and seems genuinely lost for an answer.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, his baritone scratchy and warm, sending a swoop of lust low in John’s belly. He didn’t need to say he’d missed John; it was all in the way he said his name. John could relate; he’d had to live through the exact same seemingly infinite three-week period, waiting to hear that the job was completed, that Sherlock had the information he’d gone undercover to look for and was awaiting extraction. John had insisted upon being there for that part; Sherlock had a distressing habit of announcing his deductions in a way that made people want to assault him. Again, John could relate.
“Don’t worry. I’ll be home soon.”
John sighs and within minutes he is still again, breathing evenly and Sherlock feels the words he’s struggled with balanced on his tongue, clean like the moonlight.
“Well I wouldn’t want to put Nigel Kennedy out of a job,” John sniffs, squaring his shoulders and forcing some brevity into his voice, leaning in a little as if sharing a secret. He could be overdoing it somewhat. He can’t tell.
this. He should know why John looks like this and sounds like he does. He’s been observing John Watson for years and still the man confounds him with his inconsistencies and his unpredictable choices.
It is.
Not that this isn’t a brilliant place to wake up, but John feels he might benefit from a few moments of quiet to balance himself and to start thinking how to get Sherlock here in his bed again, but in better circumstances.
"Just mind my sock index," Sherlock sends after him with a note of warning.
For the first few weeks, Sherlock had insisted that John lead in their lovemaking. He had reasoned – quite correctly – that John had greater depth of knowledge in this, both from his medical training and from his wider sexual experience. John still believes that was a given, since he strongly suspects that Sherlock’s sexual experience was largely gleaned from textbooks. From the 1970s. With very few illustrations.
“That I did, you beauty. That I did.”
It turns out that Sherlock Holmes is a bit of a prick; an insightful prick, but a prick all the same.
“No,” John says, reaching out a hand and gesturing between them, “Er… no… you’ve lost me again. I told you. You’re not obliged to… This is… Just because I… er… have feelings… for you… it doesn’t mean that you have to… I’m sure that I can learn to…”
His cousin raises an eyebrow in unmistakable disbelief. But Sherlock is not so easily bullied, and meets his gaze without wavering.
Violet chuckles and grasps his arm warmly. "Oh you're a charmer, aren't you? Good answer," she concedes. "I'm so happy for you both. As a mother you worry about your children no matter how old and successful they become. Hugh and I could not be more pleased that you and Sherlock have found each other. He's always been rather an unusual soul and I sometimes wondered whether anyone would see through all the bluster and the showing off and the brains to the person he is underneath. Or that he would pause long enough to notice that anybody else existed outside of his mind. I'm glad it was you, John."
Leading him to the sofa and sitting him down, John is gratifyingly tractable and he stays quiet while Sherlock finds a pad and pen. There are several of each strewn around the flat and it’s the work of seconds to collect what he needs. Returning to the sofa and switching on a lamp, Sherlock hesitates. John’s eyes are following him, waiting for the explanation that Sherlock has to deliver now. But how much to tell him? How much of it does Sherlock believe himself? It doesn’t help to think about how he would react if John brought him the story he is about to tell – Sherlock would be looking for the reason why John thought such unscientific reasoning might sway him and that will bring them back to the head injury discussion again. But John is a romantic, regardless of his pragmatic career choices, and that might work in Sherlock’s favour.
Sherlock never says or does anything without a reason, and yet he left something as personal and potentially embarrassing as a dildo in one of the first places he knew someone would look. He then invited John,
But Sherlock isn’t ready to hear the excuses and the reasons why John said what he did. He might only buy himself a few minutes of reprieve, but he spins on his heel and reaches up into the cupboard for bread.
He hates to speak when it is unnecessary, but this is something that, although obvious, bears repeating.
If he were cognizant, he would be embarrassed at the speed at which he spills into Sherlock’s willing mouth, but it’s all too good, and Sherlock swallows him down with little sighs of gratitude that bring tears to the corners of John’s eyes.
It’s irrational of course, as well. Sherlock knows better than anyone the statistics about burglaries and people coming to sticky ends in their own homes but he cannot deny that he listens for John’s nightly routine. It was one of the things he would reconstruct in his mind while he was a captive. Like a touchstone, it was a promise to himself that as long as he remembered it, it would be there for him again one day. Superstitious nonsense or unconscious distraction strategy – either way he had found it comforting then, and he does now – even with this new variable hanging between them.
Turning towards the truck, he was looking directly at the door of the living quarters as it opened to reveal the shape of the posh, lanky idiot who was also the love of his life.
John and Sherlock's first date doesn't quite go to plan for either of them.
well it doesn't give him a lot to go on.
“I’m not your… You don’t have to tell me where you are. I’m not…”
. Maybe you can get me up to speed?”
"Ella was… I never really got a chance to resolve anything with Ella - you were a hundred times better for me than she was."
The sweet smile she flashes as she leaves makes Sherlock wonder if Mrs Hudson is either as nutty as a fruitcake or perhaps just the world’s most misguided, hopeless romantic.
“Yes!” he barks, then swallows and lowers his voice. “Yes, I’m sure. So if you could find out where he is, his name is Sherlock Holmes.” He gestures to the computer screen between them and steps closer.
Sherlock shakes his head slowly.
John is speechless. He lifts his hands indicating his wrecked beds, his mutilated tree and, he hopes, the fact that he’s had a strange man invade his privacy before he’s even had time for a cup of bloody tea.
After a few minutes of sighs and whispered confirmations, Sherlock begins to grow more desperate. He rolls into John slightly, changing their angle and giving himself leverage to add some pressure to their heightening desire as they edge closer to the point of no return.
." He gives John one of his infuriating non-smiles and swings himself back down onto the sofa, primly resuming his thinking posture.
She starts to talk to him, but after the initial exchanges of ‘
Sherlock curls a lip at the overblown sentimental language. "He's. Not. Gay." It's quite a major stumbling block in Sherlock's plans and has been for some time, even though he has surmised that John has, on occasion, had consentual homosexual experiences. He'd hoped for a different set of circumstances over Christmas to see if stood any chance of turning John's head in his own more masculine direction, and he has seen definite indications that John has at least noticed other aspects of him than his brain and his ability to ruin a tidy room in three minutes. But to theorise that these isolated indicators prove that John is attracted to Sherlock would be to stretch the evidence much too far.
Eugh! Sherlock has wondered what men can find to talk about for hours while sucking down warm beer in sticky-carpeted, dingy public houses. There can’t be
At first, John believes it’s Sherlock who has spoken, but as confusion overwhelms his desire to hide and his gaze sharpens, John realises that the croaked word was his. And he can do better than that.
John has to close his eyes for a moment as his world ripples and remakes itself – superficially identical but its foundations irrevocably changed.
Sherlock's voice isn't raised, but it makes John jump all the same. He's not even facing John; did he know that he was watching him?
Sherlock rolls his eyes at that, but the truth is that he has never slept so much in his life. John insists that it is normal and also beneficial for him to sleep more than he usually would, explaining how his brain is adapting and repairing itself and how sleep is necessary for that to occur, as if Sherlock is some kind of idiot. Sherlock knows he’s right, but it doesn’t feel particularly beneficial.
“Do you think so, doctor?” Sherlock asks with a perfectly straight face, then rolls his eyes when John scowls at him. And that feels...right - teasing and joking with Sherlock.
After a few minutes, the flow slows to isolated bees and the man produces a lid from behind him. He carefully lines it up and lets it drop down gently over the swarm. Crouching down, he grasps the handles on each side that John had not even noticed and lifts the entire box before striding off in the direction of the orchard and the garden of the Manoir.
John can never tell if it's deliberate or another example of Sherlock's bizarre lack of social acuity.
“I know you like to write, so I thought that might inspire you,” Mrs Hudson explains.
"Apparently so. Hateful isn't it?" Sherlock says with a slow, self-deprecating smile. "You bring out my inner romantic, it would seem."
He sighs back down on John’s lap, and John turns up the rugby a little when the loud rush of renewed rain skitters across the windows, his hands sinking back into Sherlock’s curls in an unconscious gesture.
“Well, let’s start with the shirt and work down, shall we? See what comes up?” Sherlock began to unfasten John’s buttons and it wasn’t until much, much later that John remembered his need for tea.
Everything this evening seems to be conspiring to make it unthinkable for John to leave Baker Street. He’s entertaining thoughts that he’s been forcing down for months, things that he hasn’t even acknowledged as wants or desires simply because they were so far outside the realms of the possible.
he was. As it turned out, Sherlock had been thinking something along the same lines, convinced that his oddities and demands would drive John away once the novelty had worn off. They had both been relieved to find that was not the case.
With everything to lose, and everything and then some to gain, John breathes deeply and settles himself. Just like aiming a pistol - no distractions, eye on the prize and be very sure of your reasons for pulling the trigger.
"Not until seven, I'm afraid," Sherlock sighs, flopping back onto the bed. "And I don't think I can wait that long..."
“It depends on the relationship, I suppose,” John replies, obviously struggling. “And on what you consider a privilege. Sorry, I don’t really…”
It’s already full daylight outside, but here at the back of the house in Sherlock’s room it is still cool and dim. They have been in the sitting room long enough that the sheets have lost any trace of body heat that lingered.
This time it is Sherlock who dares not move. He breathes as slowly and quietly as he can and ignores the urge to roll off his left side where his ribs are complaining bitterly. But John is thinking; Sherlock can see his jaw working as he chews his bottom lip – he can feel the rhythmic twitch of muscles as he curls his hands into fists.
Sherlock laid a gentle but possessive hand on his head, carding his fingers though his short hair as John smeared kisses down the length of him and pressed his nose to the cool skin of his balls, breathing the scent of him beneath the “new jeans” smell. Risking a glance up at him, John found Sherlock’s eyes were half-lidded and blissful. Without breaking that gaze, John took him back into his mouth and hollowed his cheeks, watching Sherlock’s head drop back and the tendons on his neck cord and strain as his spine arched into the sensation, willing himself further into John’s mouth.
"Exactly. That's how I knew you wouldn't tell me. Even though I've just
Until John.
“I did, very much. I wondered if I might be able to buy another jar, if you have any left?”
This could be the teasing material that John was just thinking of, but he finds that he hasn't the heart for it when he glances at his friend.
"Nothing, it's fine. We have other guests staying as well apparently."
“I’m fine,” John says quietly.
The sense of smell is that most closely linked with memory according to several studies, a fact Sherlock recalls when the door opens. A warm gust of scented air brings him back to childhood holidays in Paris with his Grandmère who always made certain that there were fresh Pain au Raisin for him, sticky and warm from the oven. Recalling the burst of sweetness on his tongue and the way the raisins would hold their heat for longer than the pastry is surprisingly visceral. It’s such a simple and deeply buried memory, but one that leaves him wrong-footed as John carries their armful of gaudily-wrapped presents over the threshold, all smiles and greetings and festive bonhomie.
"No, I've been ..." John waves a hand back towards the party, "... around, you know. Lending a hand."
He has already pulled his duffle inside and is edging the door closed.
Whatever must happen now, must happen, but the relief of it, the sheer weight of it off John’s shoulders and out in the wide world is dizzying.
Sherlock tucks the phone between his shoulder and his ear and slides one side his forceps under the liver slice, grasping it as tightly as he can without damaging it any more than the deceased 59 year old female with cirrhosis has already. It’s been in the dish for some time though, and it’s getting slippery from the heat of the angle-poise light illuminating it. In an attempt to stabilise the specimen, he supports the other end with a scalpel, making a neat little meat bridge, and begins moving it carefully into the dissecting pan.
“Uh, Afghanistan,” John says, sounding like an imbecile. “Sorry, how do you know…?”
"How long has she been gone? Why are you telling me now?” Whatever it is that brought him here today - hope, pity, desperation - it is running low. These little ‘meetings’ mess with his balance and with the progress he has made. It is as if all the words they should have said have come here to have their moment. The effect is an unexpected agony and Sherlock wants it over with.
"Was beginning to think you were hiding," Greg greets him with a clap on the arm.
It's not that John hasn't been in Sherlock's room before - he's delivered clean laundry, looked for things under Sherlock's directions (that sound more like orders) and, on occasion, he's even brought him tea in here - but this is very different. Sherlock has goaded him into a temper and now he's given him carte blanche to nose around in his bedroom as if it's tit-for-tat compensation for having been all over John's bedroom with those all-seeing eyes of his. God! He's utterly infuriating and John would like to be able to say that he's completely uninterested in the contents of Sherlock's room but that's not true; you don't get to meet someone like him and not wonder what makes him tick, what's important to him, what he lets the world see and what he hides.
John had never pegged Sherlock for the kind who might want to marry. And although John has never doubted Sherlock's love or his place in his life, he's more than a little miffed that he didn't get in there and pop the question first. He would have - there were several occasions in the last few months when it was right at the tip of John's tongue. But Sherlock is a private man in so many ways despite the way he shows off at crime scenes. This thing between them was never announced, never declared, it just came into being so quietly and inevitably that he never questioned it. And that's the way John thought it was going to be forever - just a thing that is there, like breathing or sun rise or income tax. It just... was. Is. But now, apparently, it's this too. Marriage. ‘
“Nah, got some ideas how you can warm me up afterwards if you’re interested.”
He doesn’t want to go back to his wife – he never did. In fact it has been a source of some guilt that he was glad to have been given this time with Sherlock, despite the abhorrent reasons for it. John likes his life here. He likes the person he is when he’s with Sherlock. He likes a knife in the mantelpiece, buffalo skulls with headphones on the wall, snatched meals in dodgy cafés, late night concerts courtesy of insomniac flatmates and experiments in progress while he’s making his breakfast toast. He likes Sherlock. He can’t get away from it; he loves him, as dreadfully confusing and utterly simple as
“Of course. Of course. Small hands. New calluses. So where were you actually shot? I mean, it’s clearly not your leg despite the limp.”
John must be able to hear the lack of conviction in Sherlock’s voice, the robotic quality of his response, but he doesn’t acknowledge it; just tells Sherlock to wait there while he finds him some slippers to protect him from the sharp debris on the floor.
John tries to keep his gaze neutral, but he knows his jaw is clenched so hard it’s tic-ing. His teeth feel like they are only seconds from cracking. And now he has the first piece of the puzzle as to why Sherlock is so isolated.
“Because I know that I would rather die myself than ever lose him again and whatever place in my life he chooses will be
He doesn’t consider himself a religious man, but he remembers bargaining and then pleading with a god he doubted for Sherlock’s return. He thinks it churlish of him to now ask for more than he’s already got. Sherlock is back in his life and he will never stop being grateful for that.
Sherlock nods for him to continue. He cannot predict how this will go. For all John's nerves, he is resolute and determined to be here - clearly there is something he needs to say to Sherlock. That could be any combination of horrors from ejecting him from his life for good to a list of accusations to justify what has happened between them. Sherlock's mouth floods with saliva and for a moment he thinks he might actually vomit.
In his head, John has had many names for the colour of Sherlock’s eyes; flinty, icy, stormy, arctic, wintry but they were truly none of those in that instant. Wide, deep and filled with nameless pain, they were betrayed. And John knows with utter conviction that he never wants to be the cause of that again.
“John! John! Let me in.”
Sherlock blinks. The revelation  is shocking in its simplicity and profound in its meaning: their flat here is exactly as it is right now in the world outside his mind palace.  There are no extraneous items that have been accumulated, nothing that he doesn’t recognise and this evidence suggests that there is no difference  between the two places other than the fact that here, he and John are lovers.
Sherlock’s intake of breath is audible, but not shocked, more confused. His eyes narrow and in the firelight they look like slivers of copper. For long seconds, he just stares and John wonders whether his words have broken something in Sherlock’s brain, but he waits silently. He blinks a few times and watches as John snuggles further into his blankets and prepares to go back to sleep.
Sherlock's eyes half-lidded and half-desperate slide to the screen; he's so far gone.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmured, “…obviously!”
With a deep breath, John steps away from Sherlock, his hand lingering on his back until the last possible moment which reduces the sting of it somewhat.
“Wait,” John says, his thoughts sluggish and reluctant to resolve into something coherent. “You’re not hurt? So why are you here?” He wants to turn and see for himself when Sherlock explains but that would need him to move and he’s already decided that this is the best place he could possibly be, given the circumstances.
Sherlock realises he has been standing, staring at the tap for a stupid amount of time, and also that John, so garrulous up to now, has gone ominously silent. He quickly fills the glass and pulls out the plastic bucket that is stored beneath the sink, then detours to the bathroom for paracetamol.
God, this is excruciating, Sherlock thinks. John was clearly surprised that he asked about his job before he asked about his home life and then he fumbled over the reference to his current home. How long will they have to keep up this charade? He is all too aware and clear on the fact that John does not live with him any more and hasn't since Sherlock returned from his all expenses paid trip around the world’s most crime-ridden cities, taking down the syndicate that almost killed him and threatened to do the same to the man sitting in front of him, pretending that they are still friends.
John yawns enormously and sniffs.
“Well, now you’ve defiled my jeans, I don’t have any normal people clothes to wear out on a date,” Sherlock huffed with that twinkle in his eye. “I’d hate to embarrass you.”
John snapped open the lid on the lube, then warmed a generous amount in his palm. He gave Sherlock a playful slap and a nip when he began to complain about how long things were taking with an impatient wiggle of his pretty arse.
Does he rush though it like he does with his food - all hurry and resentment?
“I’ve got you, John. Breathe with me.”
Sherlock closes his eyes to avoid witnessing the anguish in John’s. He needs to be calm for this or else he risks adding fuel to John’s allegation about the state of his psyche. He pulls in breath after forced breath and pushes them out slowly, willing his frustrations out with them. As he gradually calms, he reaches out with both hands, gently taking John by the shoulders. John’s body is rigid and unyielding, but he allows it, and Sherlock maintains their connection despite the reluctant welcome.
John finds a long-fingered hand cupping his jaw and lifting his face so a determined looking Sherlock can take a kiss from his lips. Sherlock kisses with intent, focussed and grave. And if this is his choice, then John needs to show him at once what this can be – what they already are and more.
“Thanks, Will,” Steve called, clapping John on the back and steering him toward the door again. “So, Mike, let’s show you to your office while you’re with us,” he suggested, leading the way out of the room without a chance for John to even glance back at his favourite undercover idiot.
To calm his spinning mind, Sherlock tucks his hands beneath his chin and tries to calm himself enough to enter his mind palace. Perhaps a review of everything he knows about the actions required of a participant in a romantic partnership. It will show him where the gaps in his knowledge lay.
“Oh, you beautiful boy,” John moaned as Sherlock began to bounce down on him with a determination that made them both pant. “Are you close, love?”
When they have all been given a slice of dubious looking Christmas cake, they leave the elderly residents and start walking through the village, singing under the few street lights while volunteers go door to door collecting from the households. It's a slow process and John is beginning to feel quite hoarse. By the time they wind their way back towards the church he's also rapidly losing the feeling in his fingers, nose and toes from the bitter cold that has come down since the sun set. They reach the lychgate as the clock strikes half past nine, the soft glow of the church candles lighting up the stained glass. Apparently there is some sort of supper organised for the singers and John isn't sorry at all when Sherlock declares that they have done their bit for the evening and will meet the rest of the family back at the house later. Mycroft, strangely, opts to stay and takes his mother's arm as they walk up the frost glittered path towards the door, leaving Sherlock and John to walk home alone.
“My brother is an imbecile. He knows our history and the associations we have with this place. He should never have left such an ambiguous message.” Sherlock quietens behind him, but John knows there’s more to be said and that his friend is struggling for the words, so he waits, as close as he can physically get to Sherlock without it becoming sexual and lets Sherlock work his way through it.
So, what they are to one another?
The top drawer slides open easily and John peers inside. There's a box of tissues, some batteries, some pens, a pair of goggles, two of Lestrade's ID badges as well as various other badges from hapless Met officers he doesn't recognise, three of Mycroft's credit cards, a takeaway menu from the Moroccan restaurant they like, some loose change and a shuriken throwing star. It's surprisingly tame and John feels disappointment begin to creep up his spine to join the guilt.
Doesn't.
“What?”
“Errrr, isn’t that going to get me stung?” John asks, quite reasonably in his opinion.
The wave that has been building within him swells, lifting him and sending him skyward. He gives in to the inevitability of its pull and is washed along in a rolling, breath stealing rush of sensation, so bright, so perfect and safe.
Finally he catches sight of Sherlock in the doorway of the strange little café he’s chosen for their meeting. Sherlock had even had to look it up when he'd received the texted invitation. It's not a trendy neighbourhood and the clientele are university students, older mothers with children at school and professional people in lower paid positions. What it is, Sherlock realises, is somewhere neither of them know, that is far enough from Baker Street or Bethnal Green to be neutral territory. This too is interesting.
). The buzzing in his ears as he fell into a stranger’s (
John has turned away again, eyes cast down, causing Sherlock to quickly review his last sentences and struggle to understand why he would react like that.
John takes a seat opposite and plays with the handle of his mug, turning it one way and then another. The soft scrape of it is putting Sherlock's teeth on edge. John is clearly wanting his attention, his lip licking and his unsubtle glances are plain. Surely he would not have chosen here and now to apologise or to turn him down - John has always seemed quite concerned about staying in his parents' good graces - so what does he want? What would Sherlock want if John had turned him down? A place to hide? A chance to explain himself . Yes, but also... yes! Sherlock would want to be reassured that John held no grudge against him for saying no to his advances. John's friendship is the most important one of his life, regardless of whether it was ever to be more. Sherlock would want to know that his place in John's life was assured despite their lack of a romantic connection.
The water is cooling, but Sherlock is too undone to care. He hooks one knee over the sides of the bath, lifting his weight off John and spreading himself wide for his touch, and John cannot get enough of it.
“John is invaluable to my work,” Sherlock corrects Crispian coolly, surprising John who was expecting to have to field that one. “More than that, he is invaluable to me personally.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…”
"It's genetics, not skill," John snarks.
Sherlock steps back, looks at him critically and resettles the violin so John’s arm is held out and up at an angle that can’t be comfortable for long even though John has known the man to play for hours at a stretch.
“You make me sound like a horse, John. My beauty is clearly…”
“Sherlock?” he called, hanging up his jacket.
“How so?” Sherlock asked, his voice low and smooth now as he breathed it into John’s mouth.
John's cock makes a gallant effort and manages a dull twitch at the look of delight in Sherlock's eyes from whatever it is that his face is giving away.
"Have you ever had sex with another person?"
A sense memory of last night’s lesson steals through John, the scent of him so close, the radiated warmth of his chest at John’s shoulder and the wisp of warmed silk across the skin of John’s wrist. Moon River and stars that didn’t twinkle like they should have. He glances to the violin case beside Sherlock’s chair and then up into the sharpness of Mycroft’s gaze as a tiny triumphant glint reaches his eyes.
“Good god, don’t tell me your taxi charming skills are waning!” John exclaimed, slapping his hands down on his chair arms in emphasis. He had come to rely on his partner’s uncanny knack of being able to raise an imperious hand and summon a cab at will, day or night. “No taxis at 5 o’clock on a Friday evening when it’s pissing down! What is the world coming to?”
Sherlock makes an involuntary and most undignified snorting noise.
Sherlock’s fingers won’t comply as quickly as he would wish as he attempts to force a soliloquy into as fewer words as possible on his phone keypad.
She softens her words with kisses to his cheeks before she trots off again, but John knows when he’s been told off.
Wiping a hand across his mouth, John finds he has no instant answer for Mycroft. His first instinct is to tell the nosy bastard to mind his own business, but despite all the convoluted conversation he thinks that Mycroft genuinely has Sherlock’s wellbeing and happiness at heart, and he cannot argue with that sentiment, even when it’s been handled so badly.
But his husband ignores him, unbuckles his belt, unhooks and unzips, and pushes his trousers off his slim hips.
this,” Sherlock purred and ran his nose along John’s jaw to settle at the perfect patch of skin behind his ear where John could never decide if he was going to squirm and gasp, or just come on the spot.
appalling, mon coeur,” Sherlock smiled, crossing the space between them to stand too close to be anything but crowding him.
The parallels between the character John faced now and the man he’d first met four years ago were not lost on him. He felt his chest expand with a full breath for the first time in three weeks and four days.
Rolling onto his good shoulder, Sherlock prods and pushes John until he is on his side with Sherlock spooned up behind him as best he can with their combined infirmity.
With a subdued, “Good night, then,” John slides off the bed and shuffles to the door. He glances back, looks poised to say something more, but taps the door twice instead and passes through it.
“Thorough?” John suggested as Sherlock scowled over his shoulder at him. Nevertheless, he quickly took another crack at the lube bottle and coated himself with long, somewhat lingering strokes, just to hear Sherlock huff at him.
That focus used to scare John before they became this. Some days he felt that a glance from Sherlock laid him bare, again and again. He used to try to stare the man down, meet his calculating eye and defy him to make a remark. He would worry what he had given away and react as if he was being judged. But Sherlock never remarked on the things that he saw. He would choose something innocuous or insignificant and he would tease John with it, or throw things at him when they argued or were disappointed in the other, but he never took John to pieces as he had seen him do to others. And John finally began to relax; after all, living with Sherlock was something he had never imagined, something he had never looked for, but that turned out to be the key to the rest of his life. So when one day Sherlock had glanced at him and John had looked right back and had still been looking when Sherlock's eyes had widened at what he'd seen, John had been less than a second behind when Sherlock finally reached for him. And he’s never looked back.
Accepting more and more of Sherlock’s weight as his kisses become slowly more confident and his touches more deliberate, John is surprised and mildly irritated when they are withdrawn suddenly.
“Good. So, such benefits could be negotiated by the participants in the agreement, those that are mutually acceptable or welcomed.”
Incensed, John pulls on jeans and a jumper and forces his feet into his trainers without wasting time with laces. He hurries down the stairs, fights briefly with the front door which cedes to him with a resounding shriek of warped wood and strides up to the idiot standing in his vegetable beds.
His lover? Maybe, but it lacks subtlety and fails to encompass all that John has come to mean to him.
John has promised himself that if there is no word by midnight he will take a deep breath, swallow his pride and text Mycroft. Hardly the most favoured of John’s options, he reasons that the only thing worse than asking Mycroft for help finding his brother is spending another minute not knowing whether Sherlock is safe and hiding from John, caught up in a case or… No, he’s not going to even let that thought reach a conclusion.
Sherlock nods once.
you and my brother getting along now?”
"Well,
Sherlock makes a sound like a growling sob, roughly pushes John’s boxers down and takes the head of his mostly hard cock into his mouth.
John stands to meet him, his head tipped and his arms ready to enfold his fiancé.
John sits up from his cocoon, ignoring the unpleasant touch of the cold air outside his nest of blankets. And groans.
“T-shirts, chinos, shorts, trainers, jumpers, shirts that fit them…”
“End of an era?”
"Could ask you the same thing," John offers. He’s so prickly today; John wishes he knew why.
“Well, a few months of being here will sort you out, I’m sure. It’s not for everybody, mind - a bit quiet if you know what I mean. Restful, you know?”
“In my effort to keep this low-key, I have neglected to make you aware of how important some aspects of today are.” His hands linger over a plastic covered hanger and he pauses.
Sherlock’s only response was a full body shudder and a throaty moan as his head dropped back.
The candles are a nice touch, John thinks as Mrs Hudson disappears into the kitchen to answer a ringing kitchen timer. The flames are steady and only flicker when someone passes, leaving bright gold echoes in his peripheral vision. The ones closest to him are subtly scented - beeswax, honey, bergamot and a woody, natural note that reminds him of Sherlock’s aftershave that somehow manages to never seem overpowering nor absent - like its part of the scent of Sherlock himself. He remembers seeing the bottle in their bathroom for the first time, not recognising the name of the brand or the scent, and only knowing what it was when he breathed in a lungful of
A dramatic opening, low and urgent that slides away into a minor key, bittersweet and beautiful in a way that makes John hold his breath to catch every melancholy note. But then there’s hope, a lift into a major key, tentative, but there and growing surer and sweeter with each variation of the main melody that begins to twine its way through the piece, a familiar melody that John has been hearing snatches of for months now.
"Mummy has texted that she would like us to help by putting up the tree next," Sherlock says with a sickly smile at his turncoat cousin, before he strides off back towards his parents' home leaving a chastened Crispian to follow.
They arrived to stay with Hugh and Violet (as they insist he call them) yesterday. Sherlock drove them down to the family home in Dorset in a hired car. There’s to be some kind of family party, John is given to understand. That’s why he and Hugh have been sent off to the local town to collect flower arrangements while Sherlock, Mycroft and his mother organise caterers, chairs, garden lights, bottles and glasses. When the Holmeses throw a party, they really don’t spare attention to detail, it seems to John, which makes it all the more surprising that Sherlock agreed that they would come.
"Yes." There's a little warm smile with this that Sherlock directs at the floor.
Turning into Baker Street, Sherlock catches John’s eye and deliberately draws a smiley face on the window with his finger. It matches the one on their sitting room wallpaper and it makes John chuckle, the first sound they have made since the journey began.
As a child he had loved that his room faced south-east - at this time of year he was the first to see the sun in the morning and also the first to see the stars as the sky darkened enough for them to be visible. He rolls onto his side and enjoys the shading of the sky through the window as it brightens through dark blue to purple and green to peach. The blackbirds strike up first, their high sweet whistles soon joined by the chatter of others hardy enough to face a British winter. For a moment he wonders whether to wake John to share the sunrise, but it's too sentimental. His connection to John is making him fanciful which is not something to be desired, particularly when the object of his nascent affection is ignorant of said connection. And possibly considering a connection to another.
John can hear Sherlock's sighs, which means that Crispian can hear them too.
John was already on the stairs, climbing awkwardly up backwards so as not to appear rude. “No, of course. Got a bit of a case on. Sherlock sent me out for some…uh,” he gestured to the floor above, “…evidence. You know how it is,” he shrugged.
Sherlock is lying on his back, ramrod straight, his head turned and watching John. The lightning flickers every now and again, violet highlights in his black hair, but the rain has moved on for now. The sounds from outside are drips and trickles and the lessening wind, stirring the trees which send a new cascade of drops.
, he wants to. He
On some intellectual level John understands why the deception was necessary but, at the time, it shook him to the core. And he was shaken again when he realised that Sherlock had deliberately excluded him from his plans. He thought that he’d earned an exemption from the worst vagaries of Sherlock’s behaviour. Through months of friendship, close-calls, late night take-aways and fits of inappropriate giggles, John had imagined himself to be held in higher regard by the consulting detective than the poorly-concealed contempt he felt for the average, run of the mill human being.
He takes in Sherlock's blissed out face and makes some important decisions: 1. that he will not be able to face party guests if they hear him making Sherlock howl up here even before he's shaken any of them by the hand and 2. they need to call a plumber in as soon as they get back home and get their bath replaced with a bigger one.
There is an almighty crash and pieces of the casserole bounce and skitter across the floor, spreading in all directions except the one Sherlock wanted. He leaps to the window and examines the pane of glass in detail but there is no damage, not so much as a scuff.
"Do you want to tell me where your pills are? I can dig them out for you. I've brought you some juice and I've put the hot water bottle in your bed. I know it's Christmas Eve, but there's an A&E in Gloucester we can get you to..."
Looking around the flat, he sees the detritus of their combined lives, the things that he would look for when investigating a case, the items that would give the occupants away. There is nothing new here, nothing that he can point to and say ‘this is relevant.’
He feels a wash of compassion gradually flow through him. John has never noticed any evidence of a lover, not in their flat and not when Sherlock has returned home after going out without him. Does he not like to share his body's physical needs with others? Has he not been able to find anyone he trusts enough to share this with? Because Sherlock doesn't have time for people as a rule, but if John is the exception to
“I’m not. That’s up to you. I’m waiting for your terms, I suppose.”
“So who’s working on the project now?” John asked the room at large.
“…with me, John. Breathe with me. You know what this is, just breathe when I breathe, okay?”
“I just… it’s not right, implying any of this was your fault. I just remembered something when Greg said that. He… Moriarty… he was just trying to get inside my head.” John passes his palm over his mouth and takes a deliberate, slow breath. “They grabbed me off the street and sedated me. When I woke up, he was there, waiting for me. I’m sure it was in the report you saw. He… he wanted me to be the instrument of your downfall. He was so excited by it being a friend, someone you cared for as the reason for your death. He wanted you to think I’d betrayed you and… When you turned up and saw me first… you believed, you really thought that I...”
John just hoped that he would be able to encounter the smell of photocopier paper again without getting a hard-on.
John eases back, his own cock twitching and desperate, but Sherlock needs this, he seems utterly lost, broken open. Feeling the prickle of sweat break out across his shoulders, John holds back a moan to match the one rolling from Sherlock’s lips, at the sight before him. Settling onto his knees between his thighs, John slips his hand beneath the waistband of Sherlock’s pyjamas. At the touch of his hand on oversensitive skin, Sherlock’s voice is lost to heaving breaths and silently mouthed curses. John doesn’t want to tear his eyes away from the stain on Sherlock’s cheeks and the sheen of perspiration on his throat, but he has Sherlock Holmes naked and begging beneath him. He has to look.
“You should try and eat something. I suspect you will feel better for it and then we can start with some kissing, as adventurous as you feel ready for, and see where we go from there. Do you think that fellatio might be on the table today or is that a step too far? Perhaps some mutual masturbation then.”
John’s blood pressure spikes. “Listen mate, I’m happy to wait, but if you’d care to move off my bloody beds in the meantime, I’d be much obliged.”
Of course John, being John, thinks that he is going about this interrogation in a terribly subtle manner, and so Sherlock lets him believe.
“Any permanent damage done or is everything fixable?” Sherlock asks quietly, turning his head slightly to watch John’s face.
“Please.”
Sherlock shakes his head like a madman as John stands and pulls himself carefully from Sherlock’s grasp, stepping out of arm’s reach. He dives for his phone but John is already turning away, his hand pressed to his mouth.
He hasn't seen his father's side of the family for some years although his mother gives him regular unsolicited updates about their boring, insignificant lives. Odelia and her husband have apparently left their enormous brood of children at home with their nanny and Sherlock cannot decide if that's a good thing or if the entire party would be enlivened by some children to whom he could show pictures of crime scenes - they are often quite fascinated in his experience. And Crispian, well he has grown up a lot since last Sherlock encountered him. He has the Holmes' curly hair but not their height, being only 5' 10". He's monopolising John to the extent that even his sister has gone off to talk to some other dreary relative or another. John is nursing a glass of wine and laughing at something his cousin is saying when they are all called to the table, and John smiles when Crispian indicates that he should take a seat next to him.
Sherlock had disappeared the second John took his eyes off him for more than a minute and he hasn't caught sight of him since, but Crispian is interesting to talk to, even if he's been dumped by his best friend. He'd rather be talking to Sherlock, but Mycroft joins them a moment later, and he and Crispian spend some time exchanging hollow compliments and scarcely veiled insults - it must be a Holmes trait. John can't help letting his eyes wander as he half listens to the men bicker politely, hoping for a glimpse of his friend. He wants to tell him how beautiful his playing was and how much John enjoyed it . Mycroft keeps flicking glances at him and John wonders what it is that he's giving away here.
“Fine.”
John’s eyes stray to the cooling fireplace and he breathes through his nose. He lifts his glass to his lips and tosses down the last of his drink.
"Of course, John. Particularly if we don't tell her we are going."
"No," Sherlock murmurs as he guides them around again. And, "Don't be an idiot. I'm not doing it because I think you want me to. I'm doing it because I want to. I'm as surprised as you are, but there it is."
"You should probably let inspiration take its natural course," John tells him, "Speaking from a medical standpoint that is. "
'He’s going mad, isn’t he? Reality is clearly running through his fingers like sand through a timer.'
, to search his room, knowing that he would find it. Did he
He locks up each night, aching and tired and looks over the garden, watching the moonlight lay upon the work he has done. In four days he has cleared and turned three of the eight large beds and freed the south facing wall of the choking bramble and ivy that had all but smothered the trees that grow there.
"You are one lucky bugger, John Watson," he says sternly. "Do not fuck this up."
Mummy and Father are sharing a few last words with the family members who are staying the night. Robert and Odilia  are chatting to Father, while Mummy talks to one of the uncles. Crispian goes to the kitchen for a glass of water, clearly on his way up to bed and Sherlock follows him, strangely compelled to show him... what, exactly? He has no claim on John Watson other than that of friendship and a sharer of the rent. But for some reason Crispian and his success and his talent and his wit and easy, personable demeanour has come to embody all the reasons why John would not be interested in embarking on a relationship with a man with none of those particular skill sets.
“While not entirely accurate, Mycroft’s premise about my lack of awareness in regard to social cues is largely correct. I am a difficult man to be friends with, John and your tenacity in that capacity has put you in a unique position. Imagine how much harder it must be to endure my inadequacies as… more than a friend. So I find myself in the unenviable position of gambling everything on this. On you. On your ability to forgive, ignore and suffer when I make my next mistake, whatever or whenever it might be.”
If John had been uncertain about what he meant to his friend before, there’s no denying it now; Sherlock’s misery is palpable. It’s unmistakable and suffocating in the intimacy of his darkened room. And that is more shocking than the nudity, the masturbation and every terrible thing that they have ever done to each other, however inadvertently.
Sherlock stares resolutely at the kitchen cabinet in front of him for a count of ten before he carefully puts down the knife and turns slowly toward John, schooling his face into a mask of indifference.
“I’m fine. I just don’t bounce back as fast as I used to.” John rolls his eyes at his body’s failings. “And you got the worst of the blast by far.”
"Maybe it's something that isn't supposed to be understood," Sherlock offers. He pushes his hands into his coat pockets; it's easier than having to think about what they are doing. That way he can be sure that he's not twiddling his fingers or touching his face or reaching for John...
“We could,” Sherlock agrees and sounds ridiculously pleased at the idea, “but let’s light these candles first.”
the beginning. As we have… should have.”
“Sherlock,” John sighs, but, ironically, there are too many words and they all crowd him to be spoken. But Sherlock is still speaking, quiet and determined.
John doesn’t open his eyes but he smiles and sighs. He’s never felt such peace – it’s like that piece that Sherlock plays late at night, the one that makes John think his heart will break from the beauty of it, the yearning and the hope that Sherlock has been pouring into it for months. They aren’t a part of the piece, he now knows –they are Sherlock’s way of admitting emotion. The love letters he would never write. The confessions he could never find a way to phrase.
"Mary and I...  We're getting a divorce. You already knew that probably.”
It is impossible for Sherlock to fathom now, why he had convinced himself that he was better without sentimental impulses. He has loving, demonstrative parents and a brother whose love comes in the guise of interference and antagonism, but at some point in his past, obviously long since deleted, he had found emotion too painful or destabilising and stifled it. He had replaced sentimental connection with other pursuits which he had then made utterly central to his being; chemistry then cocaine, and then crime solving. If he was engaged completely in one of those placeholders for feeling then he had no need of it, which also went some way to explaining the destructive episodes when he was denied access to them. He’d forced sentiment into an imaginary lead-lined box and dropped it down a metaphorical well, never to be opened again.
John has heard Sherlock play many times, but he'd be lying if he claimed to have an ear for music. He likes what he likes, and he knows that he likes it when Sherlock plays. He couldn't name any of the pieces with confidence, but he recognised the one that Sherlock and Mycroft performed. It's probably his favourite one. Sherlock has been playing it quite often recently and now John knows why.
“Well, we were talking and Bill was telling me… do you know Bill? Never mind… he was sayin’ that the only thing worse than bein’ dejected… rejected by your crush… Do you know what that is? A crush? It’s when you love someone but they don’t know. It’s like a secret. Shhhhh!”
"But I have a guest here!" Sherlock insists.
John waits for a few seconds, then tips his head. “And?”
The toast pops up and it’s barely warm and hardly toasted at all but Sherlock grabs it and drops it on a plate, finds a knife and starts hunting for butter.
Now, of course, he cannot think of a single way to bring the conversation around to where it was going before Mycroft wrecked it. He can't pull the same trick with the baubles again. He can't just wade in with a blunt question. He used to be good at this - he used to know exactly what to say and when. It was his secret weapon, a bit of humour, a bit of a grin, a sympathetic ear, a compliment - he'd had a knack with getting women way out of his league to date him. But none of them were more than a distraction compared to Sherlock. None of those women truly mattered. They'd have their fun for a night or a week or a month and then go their own ways. This is completely different - it's a man, it's his best friend and flatmate, it's his partner and it's

Holmes… Sherlock looks at him again, as if he’s some sort of specimen. He bites his bottom lip and frowns for long enough for John to begin to become uncomfortable. Just when John is about to apologise and make good his escape, Sherlock inhales through his nose and agrees.
"I haven't acted on any… urges... with a man... in a really long time. For a while I wondered if it was just a phase I'd gone through," John admits, rubbing his thumb over the knuckles of his opposite hand.
From the corner of his eye Sherlock can see him edging closer. Perhaps it is the frustration of their stunted conversations or the lingering aches of his injuries, but Sherlock finds himself overwhelmed out of nowhere. He sits carefully on his rumpled bed and tries to hold his crumbling sense of self together by strength of will alone.
“Because I’ve said goodbye to you too many times, Sherlock. And every time I have regretted not having let you know what you mean to me. After tonight’s demonstration, I think it’s unlikely that you can have any doubt how I feel about you. So the only question left to ask is…”
“Well, we can get the files out later, if you’re feeling up to it, and see what we’ve missed.”
Just around the corner, yet he hasn't come to the flat. That's significant, Sherlock recognises.
“I… What does that mean?” John asks hoarsely.
Sherlock smiled his thanks and took the mug in two hands. He glanced at John’s face, a flicker of confusion narrowing his eyes momentarily. “I hope you don’t mind. I was cold and it looked cosy.”
Sherlock hopes that now he is at home in John’s care, his rate of physical recovery will increase. John is an excellent doctor – a trauma surgeon, no less, and it was rather galling to have to endure the amateurish efforts of his so-called experts at the hospital when he had a perfectly good physician sitting silent at his bedside seeming to count the hours until they were free of the medical facility as eagerly as Sherlock was himself.
Sherlock yawns hugely as if on cue and then scowls at John’s smug smile.
John is warm and safe and has woken up in bed with a guy he thinks he might really feel something for. Compared to the outcomes of other such nights, he feels pretty good about everything, so it seems a shame not to have Sherlock as close as he might be. John moves into the gap that Sherlock just carefully curated between them. He slots his thigh back between Sherlock’s, careful not to knee him in the balls, but snugged in close enough to feel the heat of him. John flexes his sore muscles, just a tiny bit - to get comfortable.
“It’s not the most secluded spot, is it?” John said quietly. “I’m not sure this is such a good idea.”
“Yes, but I am widely acknowledged to be a genius. I don’t think you can blame her for being a little slow. Most people are.” The joke falls flat although John acknowledges the effort with a sad lift to the corner of his mouth.
His voice, so close and low,  makes something in John's belly flip over and a warmth spread where it has no right spreading.
Sherlock's plans are going awry, but sometimes the best plans do.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and sighed. He looked truly pitiful and even paler than usual, so when a small shiver ran through him from shoulders to ankle, John had to feel sorry for him.
Sherlock is up, out of his chair and in John’s lap in an instant.
Whatever else he may or may not have achieved with this show of defiance, he has messed with Sherlock's holiest of holies, and that feels like a revenge of sorts.
Below him on the street a traffic warden is writing a ticket for a van bumped up on the kerb. A mother is pushing a sleeping toddler in a buggy, detouring around a cat that has chosen to complete its toilette in the middle of the pavement. Not one of them has reacted to the sudden crash of the ceramic against the glass.
, Sherlock thinks; he’s trying to avoid saying that Sherlock’s in love with him – in case he’s wrong? In case that’s not the right word? Because he doesn’t think that’s a possibility?
>>>>>><<<<<<
Sherlock sighs as the lingering traces of a deep sleep leave him. He’s never been one for keeping regular hours - always blamed the nature of his work and insisted that the demands of his body were there to be defied. He was no slave to his transport. Sleep always seemed such a waste of valuable time and he begrudged every hour that his body stole from him for its recuperation.
John reads this second message, sits back and brings his eyes cautiously to Sherlock’s face and immediately away again. Sherlock cannot blink, cannot breathe for fear that he will miss some tiny tell, some indicator of which direction his argument should go in next. He has tried to use language that John might use himself, abandoning his usual emotionless idioms and tendencies. He doesn’t want to be seen to be hiding behind words or distancing himself from his own sentiments. He wants to say that John has taught him that with spontaneous touches, sympathetic words and affectionate smiles but this John might recognise that he is not talking about him. Not really. Not yet.
“You could have. You did.”
Two women in blue uniforms and a man in a green tunic turn to look at him as if he’s a maniac on the loose. And yes, he’s probably looked better, less wet and fatigued and desperate, but they’ve seen worse, surely.
“John?”
Sherlock rarely used his height to intimidate, but the way he loomed over John, bracing his hand against the wood panelling and effectively trapping him there had John’s heart thumping madly and a familiar ache growing in his groin, which Sherlock helpfully slotted his thigh against.
"Beautiful," John tells him. "So beautiful."
