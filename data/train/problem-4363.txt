Cas squeezed his ass before pushing himself away from him with the most eager look he had ever seen on the stoic man.
The aide chuckled and left their table to go sit with Fred, who was struggling with his waffle as well.
“That’s ridiculous,” Cas said dismissively, Sam agreeing.
He pulled his eyes from Dean’s waistband to his face searching for signs of apprehension or reluctance.
“Gabe,” he said, shaking her surprisingly strong hand.  “Gabriel Winchester.  Head of maintenance and housekeeping.”
Castiel bit his lip, his stomach clenching hard with worry.
“Yep,” Don said easily, perching on the desk.  “Like I said, success breeds fierce competition.”
He gripped Dean’s waistband with one hand and cupped the back of his neck with the other.
“Just Rufus.  I kinda got my hands full.  What do ya need?”
Sam and Cas exchanged a quick look before flanking Dean from behind.
“Hey Bobby.”
Action.  Speak his language back.
Cas’ grin ticked up a notch higher on one side.  “Don’t worry.  I won’t hold you to any promises.”
“Good,” Dean grinned.  “And you’ve...held somebody’s hand before?”  Dean slid his hand over Castiel’s.
Dean’s dick was smooth and standing up like a rocket.  He was staring...and Dean was just letting him.
Screwdriver in hand with three screws poking out of his mouth, Dean huffed.  “It’s not my house.  They’re your weird neighbors.”
They caught the muffled sound of someone falling, both quietly moving to the corner of Sam’s fence.  Two yards over, they made out the shadowy figure of Fletcher getting up from the ground.
“Kevin Tran?” Gabe clarified.
“My guidance counselor will help me figure out what to do.  She’s really good with this kinda stuff.  She knows I’m not a trouble maker.”
Castiel let a breath out.  He was hard as a rock and going to have an issue in his pants if Dean kept this up much longer.  The possibilities of what Dean could do in bed, under a cover, in the dark, were a lot.
“It is a risk,” Jody agreed.  “But Dean, everything we do out there is a risk.  Once in a while, we risk on the side of giving them a chance.”
“I’m not gonna puke.  One time!  One time I got sick at an amusement park and suddenly everyone’s a critic!” Gabe guffawed.
“It was Dean,” Castiel smirked.
The sound of yelling followed by crying caught his attention.  He stepped out of the shed, glancing around at the back yards that joined his.
“I’m pretty sure they’re growin’ nightshade.  It was the berries that I recognized.  I think they’re making tea with it.  Or injections.  In high doses it causes paralysis.  In extreme doses, it could be what they used to kill the residents at Sunset Fields.”
“As am I.”
“Were you two...making out?” Dean stammered.
Dean just looked trapped and ready to jet like a rabbit.
The door pulled open.  “Welcome, Mr. Winchester.  Buddy.”  Crowley’s butler opened the door.  He was a pleasant enough guy, but he still had a weasel-vibe that put Dean off.  Buddy preceded him through the door, sniffing and ears twitching as they always did.  They used to give him a bunch of shit about bringing the dog inside.  Finally they seemed to just get over themselves and accept that the dog was coming in to visit.
Gabe eyed the picnic table in the Frieling’s backyard and turned back to Gary, biting his lip.  Sam was sure that he had just put together that Gary was Gary Frieling, and also the man making out with the neighbor lady from across the street.  And Deb was the one who snuck in a house down the road.
“I think Camille was wrong,” Dean sighed.  “It doesn’t mean they still aren’t smuggling jewelry through their house.  They left for the weekend.  Maybe they took it all with them.”
He was probably going to sleep on the couch because who would want to share a bed with someone who was so fucking damaged?
“I told you they aren’t home!” They heard Nellie say as Dean made quick work of the lock, earning himself a smoldering little grin from Cas.
“Think you’re a funny guy, don’t ya,” Kontos sneered with a curled lip.
“Okie dokie then.  Just wanted to make sure you two hadn’t changed your mind and were headed for Canada.”
Dean yanked the curtain open enough to pop his head out with a hella-scowl.
“How’ve you been?”
Linda gave PJ a meaningful look before smiling back at them.  “It was nice meeting you!”  The pair walked away, PJ giving Deb a little wave.
“Thanks for helping me with my sheets,” Fletcher said sheepishly.
The moms attempted to steal them back, but Castiel and Dean squirmed out of the booth to dodge them.
Cas nudged him to lift his leg, Dean complying.  “I knew you would freak out enough for the both of us.”
He woke several hours later to a foot rubbing his ass.
“Thank you for being so patient with me.” Sam hugged him tight.  “I’m ready to start talking about having kids.”
“The Starks live in the big house at the end of Lily Dale.  They tend to...fight a lot.  I heard that they’re separating.”
Cas laughed time and again at Charlie mimicking a 16 year old Dean.  Dean laughed just as hard, reliving the entire adventure.  Sam threw his version of events in, causing the whole table to laugh uproariously.
Camille shrugged.  “I just saw him not being allowed in a basement door.  A wooden door with locks on it.  Then Goldy’s necklace and a diamond bracelet on a velvet pillow...like they were being put in a glass case.  A nasty looking case if you ask me,” she added, her nose wrinkling.
Cas’ eyebrows lifted in surprise.
“Pleeeease,” Chuck begged.
“I can’t tell them.  I know he’s a lousy dad sometimes...but...he’s my dad.”
Bobby’s jaw locked up like a pit bull as he glared at the Carrigan house.  “That what he said, huh?”
Castiel chuckled.  He wasn’t sure why Dean got away with being such a jerk at times.  There was just something so adorable about his discomfort and the looks he gave.
“Is it weird that it’s kinda refreshing to see them acting like assholes in this picture-perfect town?” Gabe asked.
Sam, Jo, Charlie, Dean, and he bought hotdogs and sodas, walking around.
“He was already in love!” Cas said, baffled.
Wayne Whittaker’s office was a bust.  Castiel had expected to find more UFO research when he came across the packet he had attempted to hand him weeks ago, but it was the only alien information there.  There were no patient files of any sort, only personnel records and building reports from state inspections.  The only remotely odd thing in the office was the alien packet and a ridiculously vast tea collection.  Three mahogany boxes held carefully sorted and labeled teas.  But hey, everyone had their hobbies.
“Yeah.  It does.”
“Yeah!  No!  It’s all good, Cas.”  Sam sat back in the chair, frowning at his computer screen.  “I’m glad you guys are around.  This town just continues to disappoint.  Did you know that Chip Harrington owns close to all the shops on Prosperity Road?  And from what I can tell, what he doesn’t own, Don Stark does.  It’s like those two are buying up the town!”
She gave him a proud grin.  “That’s wonderful, Castiel.”
He jerked awake to the quiet room.  Dean’s hand was resting on his thigh.  He pulled it away as Castiel sat up.  He was sleeping against Dean’s shoulder.
Cas, sitting on a bench inside the cell Doug walked him to, stood up immediately, looking at him with wide, blue, stunned eyes.  “Dean?  What happened?”
“Deb,” Sam began gently, approaching the island again.  “What did you mean when you said you don’t know what happened to him?”
Damn.  He shoulda gone for a hug.  Could he have pulled off a hug?  Maybe not.  Yeah, too soon.  But damn.  He was officially jealous of Sam.  Maybe tomorrow?  No.  Still too soon.  He shook himself slightly before he got caught unable to follow simple conversation again.
Gabriel had gotten suspended several times since ninth grade.  He had gotten into a fight with Luc.  It was one of the reasons he wasn’t really keen on telling him he was hanging out with Luc today.  It had been a stupid fight.  And it had been a long time ago.  The pair had managed to share space since then, but they certainly weren’t friends.
Jody glanced at Dean.  “None that we know of.”
Castiel locked eyes with Gabe in the rearview mirror.  They both burst out laughing.
Joe squinted at the pants.  “Well...I don’t like those anyway.”
***************************************************
Dean hugged him tight.  “I’m gonna do better with this part.  I promise.”
“Claw foot or jacuzzi?” Dean mused, checking for hunters in the storage rooms by the reference room.
Castiel sighed.  “Maybe.”
Sam shook his head.  “We don’t talk about my dad because he’s toxic.  Especially for Dean.”
“You guys should wait in the car,” Sam said.
Dean hopped up in mock devastation.  “Quick!  Save the ass cheeks!  They’re my favorite!”
Sam nodded, looking down.
They crossed the side yard, heading for Deb’s porch.  Dean pulled Cas close to him.  “We gotta ask some warm-up questions first, make her comfortable, build some trust.  Then next time, we’ll ask the harder questions and get some answers.  You gotta take it slow.”
Olivia put her arm around Deb, hugging her as she began crying again.  “Stark is a ruthless businessman.  The whole plan is...wrong.”
Cas grinned.  He might tease him for being sappy.  But Dean was the one setting up candlelit nights alone.
“Maybe I wanted to go camping too!” Gabe whispered.
Dean huffed sarcastically.  “Ya think?  Why is it, that all we get are MORE questions?”
Police cars are involved and someone is going to yell, “Fight the fairies!”
A new bloom of ‘hellos’ and chatter sprung up around the front door as Cindy, Justin, and Fletcher came in.  Cindy and Justin made their way toward Melanie, but Fletcher found Sam easily in the crowd and ran for him.
Breath stolen again, Dean leaned back quickly as the kitchen door swung open and Ms. Dowling came out with a large white platter with a roast in the center circled by potatoes, onions, and Brussels sprouts.
“I better knock this sand off.”  Dean smoothed his hands over Castiel’s shoulders and back.
“I think you were scared to cross the street,” Gabe teased, taking the bottle from Castiel.
She rubbed her palms along the thighs of her jeans.  “Hope so.  Are you a Winchester?”
**************************************************
“So, Chip IS involved in this!” Gabe jeered, then pulled back, remembering his predicament.
Dean sat up, wincing.  Castiel took advantage of his closer proximity, leaning in to kiss him.
Ed chuckled, patting his shoulder.  “He’s a good chap, aren’t you, Fletcher?”
Sam pulled the full bag of trash from the bin as Dean picked up the crate they put their recyclables in.  They went out the kitchen door to the outside trash bins, still tossing ideas around about Gary, Deb, Cindy, Don, Maggie, and the oddly high population of imaginary friends among the kids.
Back in the loud music and flashing game lights, they were barely five steps when Sam waved.
“So does your head, Sam!  But I’m not adopting you out!” Dean said harshly.
Settled down and working on round two, Dean looked up when a hand patted his shoulder heavily.
Gabe had to agree.  Whatever they made their shakes with, they were damn good at it.  They were freaking delicious.
Cas grinned again, enjoying how Dean’s comfort grew every day.  As he got to know him better, he adored every mood, even the brief darker ones he’d caught a glimpse of.  Dean was as curious and playful as he was, and he loved it.  “Does that mean I did better today?”
“Of course,” he said quietly, stepping out of the crowd to stand along the wall with him.
“We were so close!” Cas said disgustedly.  “The door was RIGHT THERE!”
“Cas?”
“I’m gonna...go to the bathroom,” Gabe said, looking even more pale.
Sure enough, Dean was laying there staring at the ceiling.  “Hey,” Cas said gently, waiting for those eyes to meet his.
Luc shrugged.  “What judge would take a kid from their mother and give them to a no-good Smitty like me?”
Castiel narrowed his eyes.  “When you get angry, just think about Jack.  Remember that you’re there for him.  Not just for yourself.”
“You too, Donna,” Fletcher said meekly.
“Great.  He’ll be hungry soon, I guess.  He didn’t eat.  He was just...watching everything.”
“Well, hey there.”
Charming Acres was anything but charming.
“Moist, moist,” Gabe whispered.
3.  Charlie was entirely too comfortable in a police station.
“I wouldn’t mind some sneaking off of the sort,” Balthazar had grinned, leaning in too close.  “How bout we slip upstairs?”  Balthazar’s hand cupped his ass cheek and squeezed.
“Are you kidding?  These are the best!” Gabe laughed, taking the box and distributing the little sparklers.  Castiel and Sam took two each and Dean looked at Gabe like he was a moron.  “Come on, Dean,” Gabe teased, “you know you wanna!”
Damnit.
Cas’ eyebrows raised.  “Absolutely.”
“Well, let’s do it,” Gabe said, taking Sam by the hand, the pair heading down the steps.  “Somebody say a Hail Mary that we don’t get shot just walkin’ down their street.”
Cas was arrested.  Dean was arrested.  And the minute they walked in; Sam was ushered to the back for ‘questioning’.  “In what world am I the responsible one?”
“That’s what the coroner said.  At least that’s what my grandma Sheila told me.  She heard Dr. Mahoney talking about it this afternoon.”
Sonny shrugged, starting to look nervous.  “Don’t all politicians and police?”  She walked away quickly, Sam giving Gabe a look of open confusion.
“This must be Sue’s house,” Dean nodded toward an average looking white sided house, that looked quite plain in comparison to the Stark’s.  Sounds of a child splashing in water and giggling came from behind the house and as they passed it, they could see an above-ground pool in the backyard.
“I...” Castiel wanted to tell him yes.  He wanted to unload the many times he’d thought about it.  Dean.  Other guys at school.  Actors.  Singers.  He swallowed hard, his hands sweating.  He wiped his palms on his jeans.  “I would.  Yes.”
“Dean!”  Mary ran from the kitchen, hugging him.  “What happened?  Where have you been?”
And yet, he couldn’t stop the glare that slid into place as Kontos strutted past where they all sat on a bench in the holding area.
Bobby drives the getaway car.
They laughed, all piling onto the bed.
“Well, hey there!” Garth called from the front door.  “Just checking in on my two favorite sweet-tooths!”
“I know,” Castiel said quietly.  “Who do you think talked Gabe into being okay with it?”
Dean huffed a laugh.  “You aren’t boring.  And I’m pretty sure Gabe likes what he has.  He’s...You’re freaking him out, Sam.  He thinks you are the bored one.  He thinks you’ll leave him.  And if that’s your plan, man, do it now.  Not after you’re married.”
Dean looked up at him.  “I forget you were a lawyer sometimes.  I’m sure he just wants to protect you, Gabe.  If it makes things better, have Cas represent you.”
“Wayne lived in that house.” Sam pointed straight ahead.  “Nellie got charged with attempted murder.  Wayne, of course, got a slew of charges.  He’ll never see the light of day.  Mahoney either.”
“Uh uh,” Dean chuckled, nudging him up.  “I’m driving.”
Castiel shook his head.  It seemed wrong to egg her on in this line of thought.  “Mr. Whittaker is not the friendliest man, but he’s definitely a man.”
“Yeeeeah.  Gabe was freaking out when they started putting lights up.”  While it wasn’t the same train and sled the Carrigan’s had out all year, it still jangled their nerves.  “Ed and Madge are both in ‘hospital jail’ they call it.  Ed says the food is better in hospital-jail than regular jail.  They got all kinds of charges against them but nothing as serious as Justin and Cindy.”
They loaded into Bobby’s car, speeding toward the police station.  Before they could get off Singer Lane, a police car pulled across the entrance, blocking their way.
“Mmm,” she tipped her head, not buying it.  “He’s...frustrated.  Complicated,” she said, pointing at Cas.  “And you’re just stressed,” she pointed at Dean.  She shrugged again with her easy grin.
“It’s a lovely cafe,” Cas assured Marion, who only watched on in pure enjoyment.
Sonny’s jaw tightened and she glanced away from the bar and Sam nervously.
Sam came out the front door with his usual morning grin.  “Hey.”
As night fell, Dean and Sam finished cleaning up from dinner as Gabe and Cas sat talking quietly on the front porch about Sunset Fields and the residents there.
Dean couldn’t help but think of his own dad.  He was doing just dandy with his new family.  But their situations were hardly comparable.  Still, daddy issues were a bitch to grow up with.  “You might wanna give the guy a chance.  He dropped everything the minute he found out about you.  And he tried to give your mom a life.  That’s more than most hunters would have done.”
Bobby must have noticed him staring because he leaned in to the table.  “Those are Jody’s girls.”
“I’m at a frat party.  I don’t know where I am!”  He was whispering frantically as Gabe got up, pulling a shirt on and grabbing his shoes.
Sam narrowed his eyes.  “He likes you because you’re a great guy, Dean.  And you deserve a great guy in return.  Don’t sell yourself short.”
Dean and Cas both looked intrigued.
Gabe relaxed, wiping off the sudden sweat that had sprung to his forehead.  “I really liked her.  She was friends with me and a few of the other ladies here.”
She left, both of them settling in with warm glances exchanged between the two.
“It was the best scary movie I’ve seen in a while!” Jo added.  “I wanna see it again!”
Cas leaned in, kissing him.  “I got that.”
“Want a drink?” Luc asked.
“He’s got his nose in Sunset Fields too,” Gabe added.
Cas gets caught.
“She should be here any minute,” Wayne frowned, looking at his watch.
“Freaking out,” Sam said with a mix of amusement and confusion again.  “It’s just Cas.  He’s a nice guy.  Don’t be a dick and he won’t be one either.”
“Chuck, buddy, where are you?  I’ll come get you.”
He brought their entwined fingers to his lips and kissed them.  “Dean...”
“Mm mm,” Cas shook his head, “I’ve been reading your body language all night.”
Cas shook his head in wonder.  “Why did you investigate the Carrigans?”
The front door opened upstairs and they could hear their friends and brothers.
“We’ll find you something, I’m sure,” Cas laughed.  They headed back across Prosperity Road.  A wooded area stretched on down the road with a tree-cleared section that held a large sign that read, ‘Santa’s Village’.    Another sign, barely in visual range, read, ‘Dewy Steven’s Construction’.  Nothing looked to be under construction, so either it was just an advertisement, or it was the future site for something to come.
Dean tucked the bottle away again and the five headed further along Singer Lane until (which, for the record, was not long at all) where it ended in a yard dotted with old cars and scrap parts.  His house was small and blue with white trim and an odd assortment of hub caps nailed to the side of the house.  “Now, THIS is charming.”
“Velma here got a case of Bad Boys in there!”
“A bed, Sam.  As long as there’s a bed, I’m good.”
“Yeah.  Not you, bad cop,” Dean warned.
Camille blinked, staring with wide eyes.  “He knows!”
Sam’s eyes darted quickly to Sonny, who almost frowned as she looked back at the table.  “Anything else I can get you?” She asked.
Bobby perked up at that, avoiding Rufus now.
“Oh, just Joe shopping in Stanley’s dresser,” Gabe said, pulling Joe’s dresser drawer open.
He pulled his chair back, Charlie looking up at him.  “Hey boss!”
“No.  And ruin my street cred?” Dean laughed.  “Besides, I’ve been kinda chasin’ after this girl named Brooke.”
“Hello,” Cas said awkwardly, making Garth chuckle.
For now.
Sam glared at the blue and white curtain, hearing Dean chuckling behind it.  “Yeah.  Okay,” he said.  He turned, a slight grin tipping his mouth and flushed the toilet.
“Do we need a safe word?” Dean muttered close to Sam’s ear.
Dean gaped a little as Cas laid down, fluffing his pillow.
Crowley sighed, his hands falling into his lap.  “I have no such potions or spells.  To the best of my knowledge, which is vast, mind you, there are no cures or suppressants.”
“It is!” Madge practically congratulated him.  “Needham Asylum, Hospital for the Mentally Unsound.”
Luc nodded.  “We’ll see.”
“Why couldn’t you just try dating?” Gabe asked.
“Yeah?” Dean breathed, his smile still flickering with nervousness.
Cas watched as the girl’s cheeks flushed slightly as she looked up at him, shaking his hand.  “I’m Brandy.”
“Yes?”
“That man had a bad heart!” Chip argued.
“Definitely small-town suspicious,” Cas added.
Hunters, once okayed by a house member, were allowed free access to the Reference Room, guest rooms, the basement, and the second floor back half of the wing.  The second floor had guest rooms and bathrooms, and a medical suite.  Jody had helped with a lot of the planning.
“It was Imelda,” he said, heartbreak in his tone.
“Alright!” Sam butt in, moving the pair apart.  “We have a plan, let’s do it.  Fletcher and Gabe will be back soon, so we don’t have a lot of time.”
“Please,” he nodded.
The kids chatted happily to each other and Sam took advantage of their moment of distraction and Sonny’s dip in mood, asking quietly, “Do you know that Jimmy guy?”
“You gonna get a Sarong to go with that head wrap?” Dean countered.
Gabe hummed a sort of chuckle.  “Charlie and I wrote with weed killer, ‘bag of dicks’ across the front of that big grassy area in front of his place.”
“Good plan,” Sam agreed.
“Hey, Cas!” Sam grinned, looking up from the TV.
“You’re under arrest, Chip Harrington, for obstruction of justice.  Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.”
*************************************************
“Can you get this special tea?” Gabe asked her.
“What you want.  That’s the good part about being in charge.  You get to do what you want.  You just have to be ready to stop on a dime when the other person says so.”
Cas sighed, resting his forehead on his hand gripping the post.  He could hear Dean unzip his jeans.  One hand gripped his hip and he gasped at the feel of Dean’s blazing hot cock slap onto his hole.
“You ain’t kiddin’,” Bobby swore.  “What’s wrong with Kat?”
Castiel stepped out of Harrington’s with an odd sort of feeling.  As far as dates were concerned, this was not ranking very high.  Between the news of Gary, Ms. Dowling’s demeanor, and the entire oddity of the town, it was remarkable that he and Dean had not called this a bust.  He really needed to improve their surroundings.  The last thing he wanted was Dean stressed out or uninterested.
“Yeah.  Sorry.”
“Um...did we miss our exit?” Came Gabriel’s voice.  He, Sam, and Fletcher were in the car behind them.
Chuck looked unsure but went on anyway.  “Well, I’m not drinking any more.  At all.  I don’t want to end up like my dad.  Drunk and alone all the time.”
Castiel got into the passenger seat of the Impala.  He had never sat up front before.
“That’s not Charles,” Gabe corrected sweetly.  “I’m Gabe and this is my brother Cas, remember?”
“No.  I mean, maybe.  I meant that you are my home, Dean.  Wherever you and I end up, it will be fine because it will be you and me.  You are my home.”
Dean paused in chewing, turning to look at Castiel.  “You have a penchant for public.”
It certainly was different than Luc’s kiss.  And he felt different.  There was no question whether or not he would have gone further or if he wanted more.  Yes, and yes.
“So, are we still on for the weekend?” Gabe asked her.  Sam wondered what sort of plans he would have made (and wanted to keep) with the hateful bitch.
“I know,” Chuck belched.
Sam pulled the foil away, staring down at the mess on the plate.  Gabe came closer to investigate.  “Is that -”
“Welcome to the neighborhood,” Bobby said, smirking.  Sam was not sure how much the man meant it.  It came across as a bit of a warning more than a welcome.
Dean looked up, meeting his eyes.  “I really like him.”  The moment hung in the air until Sam cracked a huge grin, Dean blushing and fidgeting with his coffee mug.
“This is Beaver, PJ is out his side door, texting.”
After a few nights in New Orleans, they were headed straight for Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  When Sam and Gabe said they were leaving Charming Acres, the four decided they needed a new town.  Completely new vibe.  Bobby had suggested they come to Sioux Falls, and since none of them really had a preference other than NOT Charming Acres, they figured, what the hell.  So, by the end of the week, they would meet up with Sam and Gabe and give Sioux Falls a shot.  Bobby said the place was fine, so Dean figured that had to mean it was pretty good.
“Yeah,” Bobby said, but there was a whole lot more there than he was saying.
“Shit.  I need him, Dean.  I know it’s kinda crazy.  He’s such a trickster and so...” he laughed.  “He has six rubber ducks, Dean.  He still puts them in his bath.”
A dream of light, satiny kisses stirred him awake in what felt like only a moment later.  His lips woke mid-kiss, body reacting as though it was coming to life from a long winter’s hibernation.  His eyes fluttered open, his kiss blooming into a smile.  “Dean,” he whispered, taking in the sight of Dean over him, skin still damp and warm from the shower.  His hands slid over more warm skin as he reached up, feeling his arms and broad shoulders, then dragged his nails up Dean’s neck until both hands threaded into his hair.
Castiel nodded.  “Sure.”
“No, you’re not,” Castiel muttered.
Dean nodded, getting to his feet.  “Thanks.”
“You -”. Castiel glanced at the stuffed animals.  There were bears of every color.  Not as big as the long, fluffy snakes or giant stuffed sharks.  But it looked softer.  He grinned, imagining it sitting on Dean’s bed.  “You wuv hugs?” Castiel grinned.
Sunday mornings were fairly quiet around Sunset Fields, most of the residents were in church service in the community room that doubled as one of the dining rooms.     After the morning meeting and hearing that Fred was very confused and lethargic, Castiel called Bobby and completed all the paperwork for him to have an overnight trip.  Bobby and Rufus showed up twenty minutes later and Fred was wheeled right out the back door, through the parking lot, down Lily Dale, hanging a right onto Singer Lane.
********************************************
“Ignore him,” Cas whispered, hooking a finger into his belt loop.  They stared for a small eternity Dean unable to reconcile the vast blue that seemed to seep into him.  Not the harsh cold of the Bering Sea.  A blue heat that buoyed him and made him hot all over.
“Cas!” Dean snatched him by the arm, pulling him aside as Deb looked horrified and started crying.
Castiel collapsed half on him again, the pair sleeping there most of the night.
They both gasped softly as their chests met skin to skin.  Cas closed his eyes, groaning slow and low as Dean’s hands skated over his back.  When he could breathe more regularly, he opened his eyes, floored at what he held.  Who he held.  His breath caught again as their eyes met and got lost.  Absolutely, blissfully lost.  “I’ve thought of you so many times, Dean.  You are...” his mind grasped for words to match the feelings this man was igniting inside him.  “Captivating.”
“Hi!” Zoe waved, smiling wide and approaching them easily.  “We were swimming!”
“Picnics,” Rufus added.  “Fairs, neighborhood potlucks,”
“Per day?” Gabe repeated.
The pair ran through the yard, heading instinctively for the woods.  Dean looked back, seeing Madge and Ed step out the back door looking downright feral.
“He’s dirty,” Dean said confidently.  “We can’t quite find the dirt yet...but he’s connected to everything that’s going on around here.”
“Huh.  I suppose that makes sense.”  Ed tucked his pipe into his mouth as he studied them.  “Well, alrighty-roo!  We’ll see what the boss says.”
The ride home was long but Castiel had never felt so sated and happy in his entire life.
“Two minutes,” Dean grinned, sinking to his knees as Cas gasped when his back landed against the cold shower wall and Dean’s hot mouth engulfed him a second later.  He adjusted the spray so Dean wasn’t semi drowning and leaned heavily, stroking through Dean’s sopping wet hair as Dean’s mouth made love to his dick, licking, swallowing, sucking.  Two minutes of bliss complete, Cas fully in a heady daze with a cock hard as granite and dripping with not just water, he helped Dean to his feet, kissing him so hard and deep he had to keep him steady on his feet, back him up to the wall and pull away.  “Wash,” he panted.
“Hello.”  He grinned with a little smirk.  Per usual the table was loud with conversation.
“Bed, Cas,” Dean managed, his arms wrapping around him and one leg starting to slide up Cas’ leg.
“That is not true!” Gabe snapped like a viper.  “Some of those ‘old folks’ were my friends!”
“You got a crush on me?”  Sam batted his eye lashes.
So... maybe he should just let Gabriel do his thing.  If he hadn’t asked anyone out by the middle of June...Gabe would do it for him.
“Listen here, Captain Obvious,” Rufus started.
Dean put the car in gear and headed out of the gas station with a huge grin.  “We’re gonna be baller uncles.”
“Mommy gets mad,” Fletcher said guiltily, looking up over his shoulder as if he were listening to someone.  “Weems said not even a parade could wake her up.  Cuz Mommy drank her grown-up juice and went sleepy-bye.”
“Better!” Gabe scoffed.  “I’m here.  Now, if we can talk Dean-O into settling the hell down, it’ll be a fuckin’ party!”
“Gabriel, how’s it going?”
An occasional outline of what might have been a roof was sensed more than seen several times until a light ahead eventually turned into a traffic light.  Streetlights lit the fronts of buildings and houses, all the while the traffic light shone green with no traffic running through it.  It changed to yellow, and Dean could not help but stare.
Dean stood next to his bed, looking around at the green walls decorated with portraits any grandmother would approve of.  The room was very simple with a double bed, chest of drawers, nightstand, one wingback chair, and a small writing desk and chair.
“In our house.  In the car.  Wherever the fuck we want to.”
The week continued, every day going by, Dean didn’t come home.
“No friggin’ clue,” Dean said.  “I did not look back.  I just ran like you two.”
Dean had first met Gabe when Sam was a junior in college.  It wasn’t the first time Sam had gone out with a guy.  But it was the first time Sam had been so infatuated with one.  Gabe was a wildcard and Dean figured he’d be around for a semester’s worth of entertainment.  The guy certainly could throw a party.  When Sam was lovesick over the following summer, Dean thought he might hurl every day.  And then Sam became Sam and Gabe.  The pair were never apart.  Sam then graduated and started making a real life for himself.  And though Dean had wondered a time or two if the pair were gonna make it out in the real world, they did.  And Dean couldn’t be happier for his baby brother.
He slid two eggs onto a plate and handed it to Cas with half an orange and toast.  The chilly unease between the two of them was so unusual that Cas did not know how to act.  Dean seemed just as thrown off.
“Musta been a Yukon Jack night,” Gabe winced, waving the stench of alcohol away from his face.
“And lying about where you’re going at night, whose idea was that?”
Dean backed further onto the bed, Cas crawling on top of him move for move until Dean’s head lay among the satin pillows.  For every one Cas tossed to the floor, he kissed Dean’s mouth, his jaw, his neck, his collar bone.  Flat and free of distractions, straddling him, Cas looked at him again.  He wanted to see Dean, to know he was alright.  Know he was being not only satisfied; but pleased.
Castiel grinned.  The door buzzed, and he pulled it open, heading up the stairs.  He was even more pleased when Luc stood in his doorway waiting for him.  Someone who ACTUALLY wanted to see him!
Gabe turned her back toward her room, watching as more police came out of the office, Wayne and Doc Mahoney looking angry.
“Shitty?” Dean grinned.
“What about them?” Bobby asked.
Goldy, sitting in a lovely blue recliner by her window lifted her head, looking lethargic and slightly fretful.
“You can’t shoot and kill all seven of us.”  Dean stepped in front of Cas, blocking Mahoney’s shot.  “Think about it.  You can’t be that dumb.”  Dean waved a hand toward Ed and Madge.  “Now those two?  They’re some special kinda crazy.  Not sure how you all got hooked up, but I don’t think they’re the type to think rationally in this kinda situation.”
He heard talking downstairs, his thoughts sobering.  He knew his minutes were numbered.  He needed to get up before -
Castiel had to admit to himself that he kinda liked the thought of hanging out with someone a little on the wilder side.  Luc might be just the thing he needed.
“Mom said we might go to the beach this summer.”
“All righty-roo!” Ed said.
“What?” Castiel stood.  “Why?  Dean, what are you doing?”
Dean’s eyes searched his face.  “Because!  I’m not...I didn’t think I was really into guys.  I really didn’t.  But...”
“Mmmm,” Gabe hummed.  “In my fantasy, you are wearing a suit.  And I am wearing shackles and a hard on.”
Cas grinned a little bigger.  “I think that’s cute.”
Fletcher bit his bottom lip, eyes going wide with excitement as he nodded his head.  They got in line, buying him popcorn, cotton candy, and a soda.  By the time they were through the line, Fletcher was atop Sam’s shoulders, munching popcorn and smiling a mile wide with Gabe carrying his tie and suit jacket so he was more comfortable.
Dean nodded, not looking at him.  “So, I take it you need a lesson.”
“What are you doin?” Sam asked frantically, pulling away from Ed.  “No.  Don’t!”
“Fine,” Dean relented.  “Sully’s awesome.”  It would have seemed more sincere if Dean hadn’t rolled his eyes.  “He sure is a fan of yours.”
While there had been little to no foreplay, he was in no hurry to push Dean over the edge.  He loved him.  He meant to tell him from one body to the next, rock it into his pelvis, rub it along his skin, seal it with every kiss, and punctuate it with every nip of skin.  He rocked on steadily, feeling Dean frenzy and wane, frenzy and open for more, frenzy and give himself completely.
“I’m sorry, Cas.”  Their eyes met, locked in too many emotions to put to words.
“Oh wow,” Cas said out loud.  Not that he meant to.  And now Dean was smirking, dropping back to one elbow beside him.  Cas’ body followed his like a magnet, going up onto one elbow and he sat up, pulling his own t-shirt off.  As he looked down at Dean lying there watching him, nothing but the night sounds to give him direction, he decided he was not having sex with Dean tonight.  There was something more to this than he had ever thought possible.  He tossed his own shirt aside and leaned down, framing Dean’s head in his hands before delving in for another round of deep, slow, thorough kisses.
“Where did you want this?” He asked, heading toward the food table.
“I hope to see you gents at the soda shoppe!  First milkshake is on the house!”
“I just needed to -” Garth froze in the doorway of the living room, his eyes going wide.  “Jeepers,” he gasped, Sully bumping into the back of him, his round face draining of color as his mouth made a perfect O.
“At Sunset Fields?” Bobby asked, Cas nodding back.  “Well, take good care of my buddy Fred in there.  He was like a dad to me.”
“Good.  He’s at home with my mom.  Maybe you can come meet him.”
Castiel nodded, following Dean up the steps of the outside entrance.
“Did he really get those people from an insane asylum?” Dean asked.
Sam snatched the cupcake tray, both of them following him like toddlers to a snack table.
As he gave them a confident nod and went up the steps, Sam, Dean, and Cas exchanged sad and worried glances.  They finished preparing dinner, giving Gabe some space.  When he came downstairs to eat, he was more like his normal self, if not a mite subdued.
“Say...noon?”
“You think Mahoney killed her?” Gabe asked, still stunned to hear his brother’s opinion on the situation.
“Can’t say I see the resemblance,” she said, looking between the two.
“We got in a fight,” Dean muttered, not looking at him.  “You should see his stupid face.”
“Well, I insist you boys join us on Saturday!  You can ride with me and the missis!”
“He’s at the Moonlight Motel,” Camille noted matter of factly.
She sighed heavily.  “I’ll give you my number.”  She walked back to her car, opening the door to root around in her purse.  She pulled out a piece of paper, writing her number on it.
He went inside with the stealth of a cat, dropping into bed for what little sleep he could get before morning.
“I take it you know those kids,” Dean said to Bobby.
“Bobby!  Bobby!  Come get this thing!” The man yelled, sitting it on the ground at his feet.
Once they were back to the Carrigans’ house, Ed invited them inside, but they neatly declined, taking Fletcher to their own house.
“Isn’t he married?” Gabe asked.  “Pretty sure he has a wife...and she ain’t his wife.”
“Strike one, Sherlock!  What are ya doin?” Dean hissed.
Never in his life had the word ‘play’ made his blood run cold.
“No,” Castiel shook his head.  “I’ll watch for a while first.”
“You okay?” Dean asked.
“Are you, are you guys back together?” Castiel asked.  At least talking was better than staring at him, he reasoned.
Castiel glanced at him, but Gabe was already looking at his phone.  “Why?”
“I’ll get him.”  He turned back to Dean.  “Save me a seat up front, would you?”
“Everything is off about those two!” Dean shouted.
“About what?”
“Please excuse my brother,” Cas said stiffly.  “He struggles to manage adult conversations.”
Sam let out a deep breath.  That was gonna sound fantastic at the next therapy session.
Bobby and Rufus.
“Sit,” Luc grinned, nodding at the couch.
Sam nodded, smiling at the floor.  “Alright.”
“You forget I grew up with Gabriel.  We don’t get even…”
“We just want to know what our options are,” she answered.
“Humane?” Dean barked, eyes flashing with anger.  He lifted himself up from the wall and walked to the back of the couch, teeth bared and finger pointing accusingly at Castiel.  “You wanna gas her?  What is this, Nazi Germany?”
Or, no.  That wasn’t strictly true.  More than anything, he wanted himself to stay.
“What’s wrong with Charlie Whitshire?  Didn’t you go to high school with him?” Mary asked.
Perhaps Castiel was getting ahead of himself, but he thought he heard some kind of reluctant acquiescence in Gabriel’s tone.  “If I have to take this to your superiors, I will—” he began, hoping to be of help.
Dean licked his lips, silent for a second like he was trying to figure out a way to make it work, but he must have come up empty because he said, "Yeah, I probably shouldn't, either."
Twenty minutes later, Castiel checked her pulse.  She was gone.
Gabriel sighed again after a long time.  “Castiel, can you take me off speaker for a sec?”
Sam let out a heavy breath at that.  There was a pause before he said, “It’s Dean.”
And, at the same time, he wanted to comfort Dean now—to be with him through this, after this.  To give him a shred of hope.  He wanted it for himself, too, because he couldn't quite imagine going back to his lonely life and re-learning how to numb himself to everything and anyone around him.  It wasn't what Anna would have wanted.  He didn't want it, either, he realized.
Dean didn’t respond verbally, but he nudged Castiel’s nose with his own and fit their lips together again.  Castiel kissed back instantly, relishing it.  Dean’s hands came up and tugged at the bottom of Castiel’s shirt, and they parted momentarily to lift it over his head.  When it was on the floor, Dean took off his jacket, his plaid shirt going with it.
Dean only half-glanced over his shoulder.  "Sure," he said gruffly, like he couldn't care less either way.  "You can dry."
Mary's application was approved three days later, and the news went over somberly when Castiel delivered it.  Mary had looked down at her lap and put on a brave face.  Sam nodded, tightening his jaw to prevent the tears glistening in his eyes from falling.  Dean had left the room, and then the house altogether.
Castiel left the room, shoulders slumped with dejection as he swiftly turned down the hall in the direction where Uriel had headed.  Uriel was sitting on a chair outside another patient’s room.  Castiel fisted his hands at his sides and made for him, feeling as if he were walking toward the gallows.
Mary and Sam both let out sounds of protest, but it wouldn’t do any good.  Castiel couldn’t risk a run-in with the law.  If a loved one stated their intent to call the police, Castiel was instructed to leave immediately and report it to his superiors.
“He was a junior when I was a freshman,” Sam told her.  “And he’s a shitty director.  Remember that time he was AD during the school play I was in?”
Next to him, Dean muttered, “All due respect, but he can shove it up his ass.”
It was different from the others, anyway.
Castiel thought it would be best to do just that.  “I’m going to ask you a series of questions now, and I need verbal responses.  Do you understand?”
No.  This was wrong.  This wasn't just crossing the line, this was erasing it.  Castiel turned away.  "I should go."
Castiel hadn’t really thought of that.  He wouldn’t want to ruin Mary’s chances.  He’d rather leave.
In the corner of his eye, he saw Dean dip his head sharply away to gather himself.  On the bed, Sam sniffed wetly.
Dean’s lips were pliant but incessant, small and needy sounds coming up from the back of his throat.
He couldn’t remember the last time he was this happy.
Dean leaned his elbows on the table.  “Yeah, you’re a regular John Wayne.”
As if reading his thoughts, Gabriel said, “Hey, don’t sweat it.  You’ll be fine.”  And then, with the smallest of doubts in his tone: “Right?”
Castiel's brow collapsed, offended.  "She is 'awesome.'"
She turned toward him, giving her attention.
He didn’t; not really.  He supposed that would be true of anywhere, though.  Everywhere he’d ever been had its positives and negatives, and he never felt as if the scales weighed any particular way.  He didn’t even truly consider Boston his home.  It was just the place where his legal residence was listed.
Castiel would never assume he could fill the Sam-shaped hole in Dean’s life—or the one Mary left behind—but he hoped Dean would give him the chance to try.
Castiel wondered if they should banish him to another room.  “Dean!” he said again, not really caring if Gabriel heard him that time.  In truth, part of him thought it wouldn’t matter.  This was a fool’s hope.
He helped Mary out of the car and up the walkway toward the house.  Her weight against him was warm and comforting as he supported her every step.  When a chilled gust of wind blew, he pulled her coat closer around her to protect her from the cold.
“I’m Sam,” the man said as he closed the door.  He walked in front of Castiel, bringing him further into the house, and said, “They said somebody would be coming by.  I guess we weren’t expecting anyone so soon.  Are you from the area?”  He seemed nervous, which Castiel was okay with.  He preferred it to hostility, not that he couldn’t deal with that, either.
On those occasions, Castiel found himself taking on the task of picking Mary up from the house and driving her back and forth to Sam's office.  He'd been uneasy about it at first, and all it entailed.  He carried her oxygen tank and care bag for her.  She leaned on him as he helped her walk.  They conversed while driving.  She told him about the trip she took to Arizona with her parents when she was little, about how she met her husband, about Sam and Dean—about Sam's recent graduation from Stanford Law, about the long distance relationship he had with a girl named Jessica "who he'll probably marry once he can move back to California."  She told him about Dean's job fixing cars, and his love of road trips, and her wish for him to find someone nice to settle down with because "he'd make a great husband and an even better father.  He helped out a lot with Sam, you know?  We didn't even have to ask."
It was a swell of emotion, being pulled under by a cresting wave, uncomfortable with pressure but warm and thrilling.  He thought he’d never stop feeling the absence of it now that he’d experienced it.
A few seconds later, the door was swinging open to Sam.  He had Mary's quilted care bag tucked under his arm, a few loose items of clothing that looked like hooded sweaters sticking out of the top.  He seemed a little harried, dark circles under his eyes.  He was wearing his jacket despite the fact that he was inside.
Dean apparently gave up on the pan, because he dropped it, letting it clatter into the sink.  He squeezed some soap into it and let the water fill it up with suds.  He quickly moved on to the utensils.
"Yeah, yeah," Dean agreed, nodding a tad too much.  He straightened up, leaving the plates where they were, and rubbed at the back of his neck.  "Listen, Cas, about the other night . . ."
Castiel would stick to business, then.  “I’m here to pick up your mother’s medical records.  Sam called me this morning asking me to come by around this time.  Are either of them here?”
opposed to your mother making her own decisions?  Do you really think your childish behavior will somehow make her better?  Or is your issue with me?  Would you prefer it if someone else handled your mother’s case, because, personally, I would love nothing more than to part ways with you for good.”
“Yes.”
“We’re here to give people options when they’re at their most vulnerable.  We’re supposed to guide them, and they’re supposed to trust us.  How can we do that if they feel no connection toward us?” he said.  “I don’t see this as a weakness, Gabriel.  I . . .” Part of him couldn’t believe he was saying this.  So much had changed in the course of a few weeks.  “I believe this is a strength.”
The bartender walked away, taking the whiskey with him.
Mary’s mouth opened in shock.  “Beth?  Really?  I haven’t seen her since—God, you boys were kids.  How is she?”
Dean trailed behind him the whole way.
“I’ve laid out the necessary materials, Ms. Baker.  You understand that protocol forbids me from doing anything further to aid you in your departure?”
Apparently, some of his mother’s hospitality had been passed down to him.  If only a speck of it.
Castiel jutted out his jaw, biting down.  “I know.”
“What?” Castiel asked.  He didn’t wait for an answer before turning around and heading back into the room.
“Love you, too.” Dean’s voice cracked.  Castiel felt the faultline run through his body.
He dropped his eyes to his shoes.  “I have my reasons.”
“It’s okay,” Mary said, and Castiel sincerely hoped she had another child or a spouse somewhere, because he doubted Dean would be up to the task of executing his mother’s wishes.
deep as his tone rose in volume and anger.  Castiel couldn’t make out any words until hurried footfalls sounded again and the second man roared, “What the hell’s your problem, Dean?”
And, for the first time in a long time, he felt human.
Sam sat up a little straighter.  “Yeah.  Yeah, anything.”
"The fuck—?"
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam said, sounding both sincere and relieved.  Castiel was glad he could take this weight off Sam’s shoulders.
Castiel nodded, something like hope springing in his chest.  At the same time, he told himself he was wrong.  Dean would tell Castiel he no longer needed him.  He’d tell Castiel to go home, because Dean no longer wanted the reminder.  It would be too hard on him.
“Castiel.  Welcome back,” Mary said as she entered the room, offering him a warm expression.
“Dean, come on,” Sam tried.
“Hi, sweetie.”  She gave him a kiss on the cheek when he leaned down for it.  “Good.  I signed it.”
But Gabriel sighed and said, “No.  Management is in the process of selecting another Guide for you.”
Uriel paused, and Castiel tried to convince himself that hanging up his coat couldn’t possibly reflect poorly on his report.  He watched Uriel head down the hall and into the kitchen.
Deep in his gut, Castiel felt his muscles tightening.  The small of his back was heating up with an internal fire, and his toes were curling.  Beneath him, he could feel Dean’s thrusts becoming more and more erratic.
Castiel said, “And you don’t have any . . . doubts?  About what’s about to happen?  And you’re of sound mind and . . .” He didn’t want to say the last part, because he knew what the answer was.  “You can still opt out.”
Throughout the reception, Castiel had shaken hands with a number of people he’d likely never see again.  He’d been asked the question “so, how did you know Mary?” at least a dozen times.  It was awkward.  He hadn’t been anticipating it, and he hadn’t known how to answer at first.
“Whoa-ho!” Gabriel exclaimed.  “Okay, then.  Who’s the rude guy?”
Still, he said, “Yes, Dean.”
He stood up again and collected his things.  “Thank you for your time,” he said.
He hadn’t felt this useless since Anna died.  All it did was lend to his anxiety.
He thinned his lips, deciding not to worry them unnecessarily.  “I’ll be fine.”
“Yes,” Castiel told him.  “Dean, I promise you, I’ll stay for as long as you need me.”
Castiel blinked again, forcing himself back into reality.  “I—yes,” he stammered before regaining control of himself.  He needed to be professional.  “Is this the residence of Mary Winchester?”
In the end, it was Dean who asked a question.  He knocked back a sip of his beer and continued to glower at Castiel as though he didn’t trust him.  But there was something else in his eyes, too.  A kind of curiosity.  “You never answered my question, you know?  From yesterday.”
Castiel hadn’t expected him to say more, but Dean continued, voice a little thicker, “But I guess maybe part of me thought . . .
Dean tried to jump away, startled, but Castiel gripped the lapel of his jacket to keep him in place.  He tried the other pocket.
Dean tipped his head to the side and pulled down his mouth in ways of an answer.
Castiel shook it and said, “Of course.  I’ll be in touch.”
“Protocol forbids me from doing anything further to aid you in your departure,” he forced himself to finish.  He’d said these same words so many times before, they’d lost their meaning.  Suddenly, the meaning was found again.
Castiel was suddenly bolt upright on the bed.  He hadn’t expected to hear those words.  Those two words.  They made his heart hammer.
“Yes.  Of course,” he agreed.  “I’ll just—” Castiel remembered the weight of his keys on his lap.  He picked them up too fast, fumbling with them a bit before being able to regain enough control to put them in the ignition.
Castiel didn’t think.  He leaned in and filled the space between them, his lips pressing gently to Dean’s.  Dean froze up for a moment, and for a second Castiel thought he’d done something wrong; but then Dean parted his lips and kissed back.
“It’ll be weird,” Dean finished.  “People always said, when Mom was gone, I could
“I haven’t changed my mind, if that’s what you’re asking,” she said.
Castiel collected his briefcase and walked down the hall, looking at the framed pictures as he went.  There were Dean and Sam at various ages, a smiling picture of Mary, John holding up a softball bat at home plate.  All of it made Castiel ache.  This family had lost enough, suffered enough.  It wasn't fair.  He wanted them to be as they were in these photographs, smiling and unburdened, even if only for the time it took to take a snapshot.
“Cas?”
When Dean got to Castiel’s stomach, he placed his open palms on Castiel’s sides.  He slowly palmed off his pants, and Castiel raised his body off the bed to make it easier.  Once they were around his ankles, he kicked them off the rest of the way, losing them to the floor with all his other clothes.
Castiel already had a cup of coffee from the gas station on the car ride over.  “No,” he said again, and remembered his manners.  “Thank you.”
He looked down at his hands on his lap.  “Thank you,” was all he could say.  He heard how wet his own voice sounded.
"Just leave me alone, Cas."
.  “This is fighting, in a way.”
On the night before Mary’s departure, she insisted on all of them pitching in to cook dinner.  It was some strange casserole dish that consisted mostly of corn chips and grease, but apparently it was a family favorite that had been around since Dean was a child.  She got winded halfway through cooking, and Dean’s grin became a wattage dimmer as he took charge.
“Sammy?” He mumbled, turning to look at him.
Garth nodded, looking relieved for a spot of familiarity.
Dean crossed his arms over his chest.  “You in?”
“Waaait,” Dean said softly, listening harder.  The car pulled away and he looked up at them with a grin.  “Go!”
Cas shrugged, starting to push his med cart closer to the next room.  “All I know is, he gave Goldy a medication she did not appear to need, falsified statements in her chart, and now she is dead.  AND she said Mahoney gave her a shot.  There are no injections on her chart, Gabriel.  The man is a danger to these people and needs removed.”
“I know you love me too,” Cas said breezily.
They were naked.  Together.
Dirk pulled his hand away from his bleeding nose.  “He’s not - “
Cas slowed his pace slightly when he was surprised to see a car pull in the driveway.  The headlights marked the slow, unsure progression of the blue car.
“Anything is possible.  Sam already said if I go to jail, he’s calling the wedding off.”
Sam and Gabe were always together when they weren’t working or in class.  It wasn’t much different than how they had all functioned before.
“Then went along the side of the house next to yours.”
Dean lifted an eyebrow with a slightly surprised look at Garth.  Cas knew Garth could be a very compassionate person.
“Come on, you have a big date tonight,” Castiel grinned, grabbing his book bag and leaving the room.
“I know,” Cas panted.
Gary didn’t look quite as convinced but didn’t argue.  Sam could see Ed and Marge heading their way with the other couple that lived next to them.  Naoki and Olivia waved, heading over to a large table full of food that Dean was already picking at.
“Maggie does not look happy,” Gabe muttered, downing the rest of his martini.
A flash of Dean’s past reached right up and choked him.  There had been several times when he had thought of doing the same thing to his own father.  Though he’d never actually done it, there were times he was screaming inside to do just that.  He licked his lips, taking a shaky breath.
Fighting his heart rate down, his blush down, and swallowing the yelp that almost burst from him, he turned to Dean.  “You scared the shit outta me.”
“I was just telling Gabe about the parade on Labor Day!” Cindy grinned.
He jogged down the narrow sidewalk that led to the main sidewalk.  He checked the traffic and dodged across the street.
Bobby already seemed familiar with the kids and their imaginary friends.  “Where’s your other buddy?  Kat?”
“She’s...I met her on a hunt in Rhode Island back in March.  She had a werewolf problem and...she lost her sister.”
“No,” Cas huffed.  “Just...practice.”
“Official business,” Rufus snapped, making Gabe’s brows jump.
Sam plucked a hat from a hat rack at the end of the hall, putting it on his head.  “Huh!” He gasped, hand to his heart in a comical rendition of Justin.  “There is no man-love in this house!”
“Gabe,” Sam warned, making Dean roll his eyes.
Cas merely nodded, still staring at the end of the hall as Wayne, Chip, and Sheriff Hanscum disappeared around the corner.  He turned to Gabe with a serious stare.  “It’s Mahoney.  I think his incompetence killed Goldy.  It makes me wonder about the other residents who have died here.”
He pulled himself out of Dean, both of them gasping softly.  Ignoring the mess between them, Cas pushed up, straddling Dean, who lay there looking up at him.
“Four,” Sam answered.
Castiel let his hand drop.  “Thanks.”  He headed back the narrow space between the counter and stools and booths lining the front window.  He took the furthest two-seater booth by the window, sitting to watch the crowd around them.  He pulled his phone out, wondering if this was just friends hanging out, or were they on a date?
“Mr. Novak,” Principal Henriksen boomed, “I hope I don’t see you in here again.”
“Thank you,” Cas nodded, Dean nodding behind him.
Dean took refuge on the front porch, escaping the soft sounds of his brother and Gabe upstairs.  Cas was setting up a bed on the floor of the living room.  He grinned at the thought of Cas sleeping so close to him but being alone with him was bringing out his shy, awkward side.  He could swear Cas was flirting with him at the picnic.  THAT possibility had him kinda shaking in his boots.  Luckily, the alcohol was damping his awkwardness and giving him a little liquid courage.  He sipped his final whiskey for the evening and let his eyes adjust to the dark night, sitting on the porch swing.
“Hey, Bobby,” they all greeted, coming inside when he stepped aside, holding the door open for them.
Dean watched with some surprise as Cas neared the counter.  “Now, Mrs. Frieling, I don’t want to bother you, I really don’t...but I do have one question.”
Dean’s face scrunched into a bitchface, his hands waving the quiet words away.  “That isn’t it!  He’s just so...and I’m so NOT.  Ya know?!”
“Yep.”
“Sam, so help me, if you start shrinkin’ my head!”
Once in the confines of their hangout room in the basement, Sam turned on Castiel.
“Since when?” Sam asked, looking put out with not knowing.
“Yeah!” Fletcher grinned like a winner, the pair breaking into air guitars, making him, Gabe, and Bobby laugh.  Cas shook his head with the look of a man in love with someone you just wanted to stuff in a shoebox sometimes.
“Gabe might be right about her,” Sam whispered, waving to her with a barely concealed creeped-out look.
“That’s easy to say if you haven’t had to watch a parent hit someone you love,” Dean said with a trace of bitterness.
“I see,” Sam chuckled.  “And how did Dean get out of this little party?”
“Poker and prostitution!” Gabe grinned with a nod.  “I’m gonna be rich.”
“Iron Butterfly.”
Dean looked up from The Mirror, Charming Acres’ newspaper, as Cas came in the door.  He had spent the day becoming best buds with Lily, who was now snuggled against his thigh on Melanie’s couch.  He smiled at the sight of Cas in scrubs, reminding himself that they really needed to play doctor soon.  “Hey there, handsome!  How was your first day?”
“Oh,” Gabe and Sam both nodded.
“It’s over, Bobby.  Fred’s safe.”
“We’re gonna go,” Dean said.
Dean sighed.  “Just answer the question, Crowley.”
Gabe and Sam, laughing about their new snake, which Sam was wrapping around Gabe, hadn’t noticed a thing.
Castiel scoffed.  “I doubt it.  I still think the whole thing is overrated.”
Castiel grinned, feeling a rush of excitement at the very thought.  “You didn’t have to come get me.”
“So, these two are what...escapees?” Dean added, trying to get some of the heat off of Sam.
“All righty-roo!” Ed grinned, pulling out a knife and sitting his pipe down.  “Step number two.”
His mouth was open, and all his focus followed the sweeping strokes.  He felt Dean’s hand slide down his side and stop, perched atop his hip.
“I think,” Dean whispered, his eyes dilating, “I think I created a monster.”
“Alright then.  I have some questions for you.  I’m gonna need to take you down to the station.”
“Fine,” Gabe sighed, dropping his arms.  “Let’s go, Officer Coitus.”
“Thanks for springing for pizza,” Sam grinned, sitting three boxes on the coffee table.
With Gabe and Cas focused on the retirement home, Sam worrying about the neighbor kids, and he and Bobby sure the Starks were picking off Charming Acre citizens, it was no surprise that they all sat quietly in their own thoughts as the sun set on Lily Dale Lane.
“Hey, why worry when you know the cops are gonna sweep it under the rug to keep up their precious town reputation,” Dean offered.
“No, Sam,” Castiel shook his head.  “I just felt like hanging out with Luc.  He’s not all bad, ya know.  He’s trying.”
“Sounds good!” Gabe grinned.
“I meant what I said, Cas.  He’s no longer welcome here.”  Dean ran his thumb along Cas’ index finger.  Their eyes met in an unblinking stare.
“Oh shit.”  Dean stared at him because...fuck!  He was seriously staring material.
He shrugged.  “I thought maybe.”
“Nellie is coming around the side of the house,” Cas said.
Bobby tipped his head.  “Only thing I could think to fix it was Fred.  I ran to Fred’s and told him what I’d done.  He brought me back.”  Bobby poured himself another glass and swirled it slowly.  “I’m only tellin’ you this because I think you lot are worth trusting.  And I don’t trust too many people.  And one way or other, the truth is gonna come out.  So, someone might as well know why I did what I did.”
“These people are like poster children for normal, Sam.”
“Why?” Castiel asked, starting to worry about what Dean was actually dealing with day to day.
“If someone answers...I’ll...I don’t know...think of something to yammer about.”
Yeah, he liked Cas.  He liked how he walked.  Liked his hands.  His grins.  His thick, soft hair.  The way he treated his brother and Sam.  Hell, even his ‘bad cop’ routine!      He was funny.  He was sweet.  He was a little unpredictable.  Yeah...he liked Cas like he had never liked someone before.  If there were a checklist of things he wanted in a guy, Cas checked every fucking box.  Some of them with little stars next to them.
Cas nodded, leaning against the porch railing.  “I’ve been traveling for almost three years now and when I thought about settling down...I would prefer to be close to you guys.”
Castiel held his stare for a long time, trying to stay angry.  It would be easier.  Anger, frustration, loathing—he could trick himself into believing all of those things were close enough to apathy.  They would make it easier to leave the Winchesters behind, to leave Dean behind, when all of this was done.  He could remain detached and go back to Boston—to his lonely studio apartment and microwave dinners and estranged parents and photographs from a happier time shoved in a drawer to collect dust.
“No, I’m fine,” Mary told him.
Castiel didn’t know what to say to that, either.  He certainly didn’t know what to feel.  There was a pressure in his chest.  It crept up his throat, swelled inside his head until everything else faded away.  It was warm, in a way—serene.  Peaceful.  All fear was swept away in its wake.
Dean shut up immediately, and for a second Castiel didn’t understand why.  He didn’t even process that he’d spoken for a long few seconds.  He blinked, and then Dean blinked, both of them dumbfounded and caught off balance.  And then Dean said, his voice small and without anger, “What?”
Of course.  There always was.
All they had to do now, really, was set a date.  It was inevitable.
"What d'you care?  Ain't that your job—to kill a Winchester?  Why not me instead of Mom?  What difference does it make?"
.  Man, Charlie was the AD?  I didn’t know that was him.  You hated that guy.”
“Evaluate Mom’s case?” Dean cut in like he didn’t understand why it was necessary.
Castiel wanted release, but he also didn’t want this end because Dean moving beneath him was heaven.  If there were any justice in the universe—this was heaven.
Unfortunately, they always found a way of catching up to him eventually.
Maybe he was right.  Castiel had been foolish.  He’d completely lost sight of what his job was, and what would happen after his job was finished.  But—even know, standing in the corridor of a hospital—a small part of him still thought this time would be different.  Dean was different.
Castiel didn’t know why he was still there.  He should have left this moment to the three of them.  He pressed his lips together, trying his best to offer a smile when he said, “Goodnight, Mary.”
She was blinking a little too rapidly now.  She cleared her throat and went on, "I don't wanna be like that.  And I want my boys to know what to do if I ever am.  And Dean . . . he knows that.  He blamed himself for what happened to his dad.  He shouldn't have to feel guilty for me, too.  He probably still will, but at least he knows it's what I want.  Trust me, he may seem like he's against all this, but, in the end, I know he'll do the right thing."  She paused, and then, "He always does."
“Okay,” Sam said thoughtfully, “well, tell them to stop.  Because we don’t want another one.  We’re comfortable with Cas.  Mom’s comfortable with him.  I mean, doesn’t that count for anything?”
He sighed, shrugging out his hands to signal he’d given up before dropping them to his lap.  “Fine.  We’ll keep our relationship strictly professional from now on.”
Early in the morning two days later, Castiel opened up his motel room’s door to Uriel’s grinning face.  He never liked it when Uriel smiled.  It made Castiel feel like he was the butt of some joke he wasn’t privy to.
Perfect.  Castiel very much didn’t want to stand there having to make small talk with Dean.  “Do you know when they will be?  I could come back at another time, if that’s more convenient.”
Dean swatted him away furiously.  "Get your hands off me.  I'm fine!"
Castiel looked at him balefully.  He answered, honestly, "Nothing.  We do what needs to be done and then . . . we go our separate ways."  It was easier said than done, and it was actually very difficult to say.  Castiel didn't think he'd ever forget Dean.  Truly, he didn't know if he could continue on with his job after this.  I would be too hard to separate himself from his patient and their loved ones.  It suddenly seemed odd—almost inhuman—that he ever could.
He rarely had a home cooked meal, because he was rarely home.  And, when he was, it didn’t do him much good because he’d never excelled at cooking.  He knew how to make pasta and heat up a TV dinner in the microwave, but that was about the extent of it.  He even managed to burn popcorn every time he attempted to make it.
“I had a sister.  Anna.  She was . . . We were close.  When she was nineteen, we found out she had leukemia.  And we tried—” he shook his head, the corners of his mouth twisting upward in a bitter scoff, “everything.”
Castiel didn’t have an answer for that.  He’d thought he understood, but then he met Dean.  Suddenly, he didn’t know why caring for the patients and their families was wrong.  Wasn’t that the whole point?  Didn’t he sign up for this job because he didn’t want people to suffer?  Because he wanted to help them?  Wasn’t that the same thing as caring?
Mary and Sam shared a look.  Dean kept glaring.
Castiel inclined his head, not really able to argue.  He guessed he’d never really thought about it like that.
Anna used to say he’d find a way to burn cereal.  She was the cook in the family.  Or, she used to be.
Castiel had been in Kansas for three months altogether.  He realized that upon waking up one morning to find a light dusting of snow collecting on the windowsill outside Dean’s bedroom.  Granted, this must have been a one-off, because it was still much too early for snow.  It was only early November, after all.  But, when he’d arrived for Mildred’s case, it had been late summer, and all the leaves were still bright and vibrant on the trees.  He’d been away from east coast for much longer than he’d anticipated.
Before he even fully processed what was happening, he was saying, “What is it?  Is he alright?”  He sounded fearful and forlorn, and he needed to get a hold of himself.
Castiel’s lips were starting to chap as he sucked air into his open mouth.  He was hot from exertion, and his vision felt fuzzy around the edges, narrowing down to Dean writhing beneath him.  He was quickly losing his composure.  He braced himself by putting his free hand on Dean’s ribs and leaning into it, locking his elbow to keep himself upright.
Surely, he was misinterpreting her meaning.  Because he was certain, if given the choice, Dean would rather have his mother than Castiel.
“Dean—”
, because it was apparently Mary’s favorite movie.  But she fell asleep a quarter of the way into it.  She’d been sleeping on the sofa for the last week and a half, unable to get up the stairs anymore.  But Dean was adamant about her sleeping in her own bed that night.  The brothers had to carry her up the stairs, and she laughed the whole way until a fit of coughing cut it short.
Dean was letting out filthy sounds, his fingers tightening around Castiel’s as they worked each other.  His other hand was squeezing the top of Castiel’s thigh.
“Boston,” he answered.
“You sure?” Sam offered.
“Missouri Mosley.  She lives here in town.”
He just kept holding Dean’s hand and hoped it was enough.
Dean needed him.
“I want her to get better,” Dean said at last, voice low and soft and thick.
Dean let out a hum of agreement.  “Be my guest,” he said, popping both brows.  He then lifted his hips and shimmied himself out of his jeans and boxers, and Castiel laid flat and pulled his underwear off, too.  And then there was nothing between them, every inch of their skin coming together.  They slotted their hips together, and Castiel felt Dean’s erection slide against his own as they circled into each other.
“Mm.  We took Sam there to look at schools.  Where’d we look, honey?  Harvard and—there was another one.”
Or Sam said, “I don’t know, Dean.  But it’s not our decision.”
.  The call?  Some douchebag named Gabriel told Sam you’re leaving.”  He spread out his arms akimbo, a slight bend to his knees.  “What the hell, Cas?”
"Well.  Goodnight, Dean."  Castiel opened the door and stepped out into the cold night.
But Castiel hadn’t prayed in years, since he moved out of his parents’ house, so he wasn’t complaining.
While eating, none of them addressed what would happen the following morning.  The Winchesters reminisced about old memories—
Castiel picked up his notes and turned to the first page, where his questions were listed out.  He didn’t really need them anymore, but he liked to go through them just so he knew he wasn’t missing anything.
He felt Dean’s eyes turn curious as he leaned back in his seat and rested his arm on the back of Mary’s chair.
It made all the difference.  Castiel had to bite back those words as rage flooded through him.  It shouldn't have made a difference at all.  So far, Dean had called Castiel a serial killer, a murderer, a Nazi—maybe even a hit man.  He had no respect for him and would have preferred it if Castiel had never darkened his doorway, and perhaps he had a point.  Perhaps Castiel deserved his insults and his threats, but he shouldn't have cared.
“Great,” Castiel thought he heard Dean mutter as he got closer to the car.
The materials for Mary’s departure had arrived.  Under normal circumstances, all that was left to do was pick a date.
He was scrubbing the casserole dish a little too hard.  It was passed clean by that point, the sponge squeaking against the glass.  The running water was hot, turning his skin red.  Castiel breathed in.  He set the dish on the drying rack and turned off the water.
“Yes.”
There were two cars in the driveway: a modern Dodge muscle car that Castiel didn’t know the model name of and a classic car, its sleek black body meticulously clean and sparkling in the late morning sun.
A blonde woman was on the couch, a blanket over her lap, her feet kicked up on the coffee table.  A few pill containers were lined up next to a bowl with still a good amount of cold oatmeal and a spoon sticking out of it.  There was a box of tissues on the cushion next to her, many of them crumbled up and stained red on her lap.  She was pale, skin yellowing and taut around her thin face.  She coughed into one of her tissues as Castiel and Sam entered the room.
He blinked again.  Suddenly, he became aware of the beat of his own heart.  He turned, looked up, and found Sam still standing a few feet away.  A smirk pulled at Sam’s lips before he continued on to his own room.
“Mary,” he began.  “Firstly, I have to ask how you heard of the Departure Network.”  It was a standard first question.  As their business wasn’t technically legal in most states, Guides have been known to fall prey to sting operations where an undercover detective posed as a candidate.  Checking his bases to ensure his own safety was top priority, according the guidebook.
“Great.  Well, dinner’s almost ready.”
As Castiel walked back to his car, he fisted his hands tightly at his sides.  It felt like every muscle in his body was clenching, desperate to hold back a flood.  Something was ratcheting its way up his chest.  He walked as quickly as he could without breaking into a full sprint, even though he was fairly sure Sam wasn't watching him.
“Excellent.”  Now that Castiel had confirmation he was in the right place, he could continue.  Mary Winchester’s file indicated her family knew of her application, so he could disclose his identity to this man.  “My name is Castiel Novak.  I’m a representative of the Departure Network, an organization affiliate with Death with Dignity.  We received Mrs. Winchester’s application for—”
It was best to do something useful.
Castiel’s body was limp, boneless.  He wanted to stay like that forever, no matter how uncomfortable the film of sweat layering his body was.
Castiel nodded.  "I do."
“Sam’s a lawyer,” Mary said, looking proudly on at her son.  “He can help.”
“What if I’m just leaving her in the dark alone and—Fuck.”  He clasped his hand over his eyes swiftly.
Dean gave a kind of half-laugh.  "'Cause I can't really get you out of my head.  I mean, at first, I thought it was because I was so pissed off that you're even here.  Because I hated you or something.  But I just can't . . . especially after the other night.  I can't stop thinking about . . ."
“You have different ways of showing it,” Castiel supplied.
—and Castiel thought of the photographs scattered around the house, of a life lived, of lives cut short.  He tried so hard to keep his thoughts centered around the sterile verbiage of the word “departure,” and yet he continuously found himself circling the word “death.”
But then Dean shifted.  He craned his neck to look at Castiel, and Castiel tipped his head back to meet the gaze.  Dean said, “Thanks.”
He leaned in and kissed Dean’s stomach, circling his bellybutton and lining the skin above the hem of his jeans with his tongue.  Dean’s stomach rose and fell with panting breaths, and his hands were carding through Castiel’s hair, massaging his scalp.
"You shouldn't even be here," Dean told him after Castiel pushed the door open, a blast of cold air hitting him as they walked outside.
“I didn’t say that.”
Castiel dropped his shoulders.  He rubbed at his eyes.  “Yeah, maybe,” he allowed.
“I see.”
Dean was already standing up, his arm hooked into Mary's as he helped her stand.  Castiel stood, too.  When Sam rounded the coffee table, Dean stepped back to allow Mary to lean on him.
“Yeah, I’m here, Mom,” he said, putting a firm hand on her shoulder.  She placed one hand on his knee, and the other held Sam’s hand again.  Castiel watched the three of them looking at each other.  Brave smiles and teary eyes.
.  After tomorrow, she’s just gonna be gone and . . . Fuck, I don’t—I’m just supposed to be okay with the fact that I may never see again?”  There was panic creeping into his voice.  Anger.  Castiel sat up a little straighter, as if ready to jump in should Dean need defending from some invisible assailant.
“No, no.  I’m good,” Sam said quickly, swiping his hands through the air, but his tone suggested he
Ms. Winchester looked around at him and, despite her frail appearance, her eyes were glinting and her smile was warm.  “Of course.  Hi, Castiel.”
Belatedly, Dean must have realized what he'd said, because he stammered to correct himself.  "At, you know—the diner.  I mean, I can show you where it is.  On a map."
“Whatever.  Point is: we don’t want somebody else.”
When Castiel got back upstairs, he headed for Dean’s room.  The light was already on, the door cracked open.  He peered inside, keeping close to the door jam.  Dean was sitting on the far side of his bed, his back facing Castiel.  His shoulders were slumped, eyes downcast at the open shoebox propped on his knees.  There was something in his hands, a small square that Castiel belatedly realized was an old photograph.  There was an opened bottle of whiskey on the nightstand.
“You meant that?”
He unzipped his luggage again, and pulled out his tie.
Despite himself, and despite Dean’s best efforts, Castiel was already starting to like him.
Castiel wanted to point out that technically Mary would be killing herself.  He refrained.  He didn’t want Dean to think any less of him than he already did.
“Dean!” came Sam’s voice from the kitchen.  He sounded panicked.
He hovered close to Dean’s mouth, lips brushing as he said, “I think it’s time we were naked now.”
His lips were pliant as they moved against Castiel’s, and his tongue tasted sweet and bitter like bourbon.  It was sloppy and rough and rushed, and simultaneously the tenderest kiss Castiel had ever received.  Dean’s hands were in his hair, tugging gently as he ran his finger through it.  Castiel realized he was touching Dean’s face, cradling the hard line of his jaw to keep him from going anywhere—but he didn’t think Dean would.  Not with the low sounds being pulled up from the back of his throat.
Castiel thought that seemed rather obvious.  “Apparently.”
Perhaps that was the reason Castiel opened the door a little wider, the hinges creaking.  “Dean?” he whispered, rapping his knuckles on the wood.
Castiel pinched his lips and glowered at him, silently telling him to shut up.  Dean sulked.
She snorted, and it made her cough slightly.  “He better.  I’m useless in the kitchen, and Sam can hardly heat up soup.  Don’t tell him I said that.”
“No, I can handle it,” he told Gabriel.
Castiel wondered if she’d even last long enough for the hood to arrive in the mail.
“I assure you, we won’t be long,” Uriel said.
“I love you, too, Mom,” Sam said softly.
He wondered what the hell was taking Gabriel so long.
“Huh?” he heard Dean grunt.
Castiel locked up and stared blankly ahead.  This conversation was a mistake.  Mary was a little too good at reading people, he discovered, when he knew for certain that he wasn't exactly what one would call an open book.
“Your mother kept a good amount of items from various religions around the house, but she had a secular service at a funeral home . . .” It wasn’t exactly a question, but he knew Dean understood where he was going with it.
Castiel assumed they were done, and he was thankful for that.  He was ready to get out of that house.  He needed to get away from Dean, and of the strange way he made Castiel feel—like he wanted Dean both to keep his distance and to come closer.
“It’s okay,” Castiel assured him.  He was used to this.  “My presence sometimes tends to arise feelings of aggression in patients’ loved ones.”  He looked up at Dean, telling himself to remain calm.  Dean looked about ready to strangle him.  “Mr. Winchester, I understand this is an uncertain time, and it’s normal to experience fear.  I’d be happy to provide all of you with literature outlining the departure method, and I can coach you through the acceptance process so you’re better equipped to support your mother in her decision.”
Or maybe it was like coming back to life.
"What the hell's your problem?" Dean yelled suddenly, getting to his feet and turning into Castiel.  He swayed slightly.
Castiel knew they should clean up, but he didn’t want to stop holding Dean.  He thought, if they got out of bed, Dean would want to leave.  More than anything, he wanted Dean to stay.
The dishcloth was starting to get soaked by then, but Castiel ran the utensils through it anyway as Dean handed them over.  "My work takes me all over."
“Hey!  Cas, glad you picked up,” Sam said.  His voice was quiet, a respectful whisper as to not wake someone up.  He sounded weary, but not upset.  Castiel felt relief wash over him.  That meant Mary was still alive.
“Well,” Mary said, furrowing her brow.  “We have this family friend.  She’s an herbalist, into alternative medicine.  She told us about you guys a few months ago.”
Dean knitted his brow together, forehead lining and mouth agape as his eyes flickered across Castiel’s face for answers.  Castiel was sure Uriel couldn’t see him, so he allowed himself to lock eyes with Dean.  He silently begged for Dean’s cooperation, and he hoped Dean understood the message.
“How are you, Dean?” he asked, and maybe it was a stupid question.  Not to mention, one Dean had likely left the house to escape in the first place.  He’d probably heard it a thousand times that day.
And that was it.  That was the crux of the problem right there.
Anna never got to choose.
Castiel let out a heavy breath, a cocktail of emotion roiling in his gut.
“Are you entering this process of your own free will?”
“Dean,” Castiel whispered between them, his voice rough already.  He wanted to be with Dean, to pretend he could stay there with him for a week, a month, a year—for good.  And he wanted to feel Dean’s mouth on him, to have their bodies move together, to touch Dean everywhere like he’d imagined.
“No!  I don’t need a back alley therapy session from some murderer for hire,” he said, voice hard.  He flapped his hand out to indicate Castiel with disgust.  “You say you’re all about helping people—but how much are we paying you again?  To kill my mom?”
Dean dipped down and kissed the bend of Castiel’s shoulder, and then his clavicle.  He mouthed at Castiel’s nipples and down the center of his chest.  Castiel laid back for the moment and just enjoyed it.  He breathed, his hands holding Dean’s head as he continued his ministrations.
Dean hummed again, seeming apathetic about the situation.  He leaned in and pecked Castiel’s lips, smiling into it.  When they parted, Castiel searched his face, starstruck.
That earned him another bemused bark of laughter.  "Why the hell do you drive, then?"
"Right, yeah," Dean said, snapping out of his own reverie.  "I'll walk you out."
Gabriel cut him off: “Whoa, no!  No way.  You’re way too close to this.  If anyone can make a case for you, it’s me.”
He turned back to her and nodded, causing her face to erupt into a victorious grin.  She hooked her elbow back into his and patted his forearm with her gloved hand.  “Knew I’d wear you down eventually.”
Dean sighed loudly, like the last thing he wanted to do was talk about absolutely anything with Castiel.  It may have been the one thing they had in common.
“Excellent!  No time to waste.”  Uriel came forward again.  He must have seen the hesitation that Castiel was trying to hide, because he outstretched his arms and placed his hands firmly on Castiel’s shoulders.  “Castiel.  Don’t worry.  Everyone knows how seriously you take your profession.  Maybe
He dropped his shoulders apathetically, and set the burger back down.
Castiel accepted his fate.  He tossed his toiletries into his luggage and went to the door, quickly unlocking it.  Steeling himself, he ripped the door open.  Dean still had one fist raised like he was about to assault the door again.  When he realized Castiel was there, he let his arm fall and glared.
It was too late now.
The folded black hood and nitrogen tank were next to her on the bed.
Dean was quiet.  His throat clicked when he swallowed.  After a few moments, he said, “You’re wrong, Cas.  You, me, and Sam can’t be there for all of it.  She’s gonna be alone.  Everyone’s gotta be alone.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes, perplexed.  “Why would I tell you that?”  If there was one thing he’d learned from his job, it was this: death was, in fact, the end.  It was right there in one of the initial questions he had to ask every potential patient during their first interview.
He made his way out of the house, doing his best not to look at the photographs hanging on the wall in the hallway as he passed them.  He couldn’t help it.  His eyes flickered to an old elementary school portrait of Dean, young and missing a front tooth as he smiled goofily at the camera.
Collecting himself, he grabbed his briefcase and got out of the car.  With any luck, Mary and Sam would be inside the house.  But there was no way he could slip past Dean to knock on the door, so he approached the driveway, pointedly keeping his eyes away from Dean’s posterior.
But, in such a short time, they were learning things about each other.  Small things that added up to the bigger picture.  What kind of toothpaste Dean used: cinnamon, not mint.  How Castiel slept: on his side with the blanket practically burritoed around him.  What Dean’s favorite color was: red.  What kind of music Castiel listened to: whatever was on the radio, and jazz.  What Dean’s favorite movie was:
He stomped after him, moving as fast as he could.  Dean's legs were a little longer than his, making his strides quicker, but Castiel managed to put himself between Dean and the car, halting him.
,” Dean said, stretching his arm high above his head and leveling his hand.
Dean opened his mouth, apparently fishing for an excuse.  “Yeah, well—you know.  We keep it kind of hot in here.  For Mom.”
Mary smiled gently at him and placed her hand on his forearm.  “Sweetie, I’m okay.  Just a little tired.”
"A Beatles cover band?  Come on, Mom!  This is your funeral we're talking about.  You only get one.  Might as well go big and get a Zepp cover band.  Cas, back me up."
“No, no, it’s cool, Cas.  You don’t count,” he said.  Castiel tilted his head to the side, wondering if he should be offended.  Dean scoffed out a small laugh and amended, “Ya know.  In a good way.”
And then it was just he and Dean in the room, alone for the first time all night.  Castiel awkwardly shifted his weight, wondering if he should be brave and say something or be safe and take his leave.  Dean didn't look at him, but there was a weight around him that suggested he was
Castiel stayed quiet, listening.  It was a tactic he learned from a therapist his parents had made him go to years ago.  Remain quiet, and the other person will feel the need to keep talking.
He forced a tight smile and nodded curtly.  “Of course.”
Mary remained a still lump beneath the muted mint-colored blanket.  Across the bed, Sam was dozing in a chair.
“Hey,” he whispered.  It sounded overly loud.
However, when he stepped out into the biting chill of the crisp afternoon, his eyes were immediately drawn to the figure leaning against the trunk of the old, decaying tree in the yard.  Dean’s head was bowed, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his leather jacket to protect from the cold.  The knot of the black tie around his neck was pulled loose.  Above him, all the leaves had fallen from the tree, leaving behind spindly, sharp branches and limbs that appeared one strong breeze from snapping off.  Castiel was surprised it could even hold Dean’s weight against it without toppling over.
“You know Uriel, right?  He’d the closest to you right now.  A couple days away.”
He didn’t hesitate in answering that time.  “Yes, I studied at Boston University.”
“Gabriel, I—” Wait.  What?  Did he just say he could stay?  “What?”
Immediately, Dean shot off down the hall.  Castiel was running after him before he even realized his legs were moving.  They hurried into the kitchen, where Mary, still in her pajamas and robe, was slumped in her chair at the table.  Sam, his tie undone around his neck, was squatting beside her, holding her as if keeping her upright.  He had a bunch of tissues in one hand, held up to Mary’s mouth.  They were stained with blood.  Castiel’s eyes widened when he realized more blood was on her lips.
Castiel didn’t know why it mattered, but he wanted to make Dean understand.  Maybe it was for the sake of his mother, but maybe it was something else.  He wanted Dean to understand
“You understand that protocol—”
"Hello, Sam," Castiel said.  He looked past him into the dark hallway.  The house was quiet beyond but, despite everything, he half-expected Dean to appear from the back.  "I'm looking for your mother.  I . . ." There was no real easy way to say this.  "She's been approved to order the materials needed for her departure date."
After a couple of hours, when the group had thinned out some, Castiel returned from the kitchen, where he’d been helping Jess put out more snacks; he quickly noticed Dean wasn’t present.  A numb sensation swept over his body at the realization, and he remembered that night a few weeks ago when he had to drag a belligerently drunk Dean off a barstool.  An empty pit writhed in his gut at the thought of Dean being in such pain.
Castiel looked at him levelly.  “That’s not true.”  The Winchesters had been the best family he’d ever been assigned to.
For the first time all morning, Castiel felt as though he could breathe.  Until, of course, he looked back at Dean.
“You’re sticky,” Dean complained with a frown, but his arm underneath Castiel came up to wrap around his back.
"Tell you mother and Sam I said goodnight," he said gently.  He could barely hear himself.
“Mom!” Dean called.  He ran past where Uriel was standing, dropping to his knees next to Sam.  His hands were on Mary’s face, cradling her cheeks.  She wheezed lowly, sounding pained.  Her body moved limply.  Her eyes fluttered but never fully opened.
“Yes, I do!”
"Get out of my way."
“Don’t
Mary let her hands fall away.  “Okay,” she said, and that was all.  No grand final words.  Castiel didn’t know what could possibly be said, anyway.
Castiel grabbed it, and then snatched his car and motel room keys off the table in the corner of the room.  He set out into the frigid night.
She smiled again, this time sadly.  “Could you hold my hand?”
However, it was late.  The sun had set an hour ago, which meant it was even later in New York, where Gabriel lived.  They’d spent too much time planning what they wanted to say.  Castiel thought they might have missed their opportunity for the night.  Maybe it would be best to call back with a fresh mind in the morning.
But then Dean said, “You better stay here, you understand?”
Castiel stepped inside, keeping his eyes on the line of Dean’s shoulders while he closed the door softly behind him.  “What are you doing?” he asked, walking around the bed.  He glanced inside the shoebox, finding it filled with more photos and memorabilia.  He spotted a crinkled brochure of the Grand Canyon and a cheap plastic medal with the symbol for pi on it, among other things.
Mary lit up, and Sam exclaimed an unintelligible noise.
Sam walked Castiel to the door, thanking him again.  Once outside, Castiel found it much easier to breathe.  Still, every time he blinked, he saw Dean’s green eyes boring into him.
But, when Dean leaned slowly backward onto the pillow, dragging Castiel down with him, Castiel thought, maybe, words weren’t necessary.
Dean gusted out a loud huff and rolled his eyes, but Castiel still wasn’t inclined to give him any platitudes.  They’d certainly never helped him when Anna died.  He had come to check in on Dean, and perhaps be a comfort, but he was never good with words.  He hoped his presence alone was enough, though he doubted it.  Maybe Sam would be able to help Dean more.
Castiel barely remembered saying goodbye.  The next thing he knew, the line had gone dead next to his ear.  He moved his arms down, looking at his phone’s home screen, the apps carefully organized into folders.  He blinked down at it until the phone went black.
“And have you explored all other options available to you within the realm of medicine?”
"Lemme guess," Dean interrupted, looking fully at Castiel and giving him a smirk that looked more pissed off than anything else.  "Sam told you to pick me up."
one too many times.  Shortly after, Mary stated she was tired as went to sleep, and Castiel didn’t know why she was grinning as she left he and Dean on the couch.
He stood up and picked the file folder up from the table, then left the motel room.  There was a supply store a little way down the road that he’d been using to fax the paperwork back to his superiors over the last few weeks, and they would still be open at this time of night.  He decided to walk instead of drive, because at least that would eat up some of his time before he had to get in the car tomorrow to drive back to Boston.  It would be a two-day journey with minimal stops for gas, coffee, and sleep, so he knew he should stretch his legs while he had the chance.
He’d dreamt of Anna last night.  Anna, and the rhythmic beeping of an EKG.  Anna, and the sterile scent of hospitals that got stuck in his throat and made him want to gag.  Anna, and cold pale skin.
Mary let out a thick sounding sigh.  "Alright, I should probably head to bed."
Dean did a double take before realizing who was standing next to him, but when Castiel's presence registered, he groaned, "Oh, God.  What do you want?"  His words were slightly slurred and his eyes a little glassy, but he didn't appear too drunk.  He picked up his glass again and knocked the whole thing back in one go, grimacing at the burn as it went down.
“That’s Chip Harrington and his daughter, Sonny,” Melanie explained.  “They run Harrington’s.”
Sam stopped, giving Castiel a somewhat apologetic look.  A teacher burst through the crowd, blowing a whistle and yelling.
“She’d be jealous.”
Castiel glanced up at their mother’s window at the front of the house.  Gabe was probably right.  He sighed heavily as he unlocked the car, putting it in neutral.  They pushed the car half a block before Castiel started it.
Make quick work of getting clean, they moved from the shower, toweling off as they headed to the bed that had yet to be touched.  Dean snatched the towel away from Cas, pushing down into the bed with an eager grin.  “First time we had sex was in that Moonlight Motel.”
Ding dong.
“So?” Dean asked, trying so hard to make sense of all this.
“Me too.  I heard you three took down a big nest in Kansas.”
“No.  I saw his car in the parking lot,” Camille said.
Dean agreed.  “I can check into it, but I don’t know of any.”  Dean pulled up an app on his phone.  By the little tracker dot that was parked in its usual spot, Crowley was at home.  “I’ll be back by dinner.  I’ll see what I can find out.”
Fletcher joined his side and Sam pulled him onto his thigh, keeping him close.  “Did you pick a song?”
2.  Wolves In Sheep’s Clothing
Garth’s mouth dropped.
Gabe turned to watch him, wondering if the guy was just out for a walk.  He sorta looked like he was on a mission as he headed up the road.  He was given an answer as Justin swiftly passed the two houses between theirs and the crowning jewel on Lily Dale.  The man headed up the semi-circle driveway until bushes blocked Gabe’s view and he couldn’t see him anymore.
Cas gasped at the contact.  His dick seeked something to rut into.  Dean pumped with a growl and slammed forcefully.
“No, you two are grounded.  I’ll go,” Sam shook his head.
“Okay,” Dean rolled his eyes.  “You don’t gotta air quote at me.”  Dean shook his head.  Dammit.  Cas was adorable no matter what he was doing.  Even when he was being...what the hell was he being?  Cas-like!
Sam chuckled that deep, rich laugh he so loved.  “Promise.  We’ll wait for you.”
“Only since you decided to run water in every room,” Dean grinned.
Gabe rolled his eyes.  They didn’t make ‘em as pure as his Samshine anymore.
He clocked in ten minutes early and unlocked his office.  The maintenance office handled repairs and housekeeping.  He had four staff members, three housekeepers and one other maintenance man, that he was in charge of.  Laundry, like the kitchen, was its own department, thankfully, because he really didn’t like being in charge of other people.  Luckily, the housekeeping staff did their own thing, he just kept track of the cleaning schedules and ordering supplies.
“Well,” Naomi stood up, smoothing her dress pants out.  “Castiel did hit that boy, right in front of a teacher.  So, neither of them could go, or just Castiel.  Sam might as well go.  There’s no sense in both of them being in trouble.”
Gabe chewed his lip for a second before standing up again.  Dean followed, the pair heading for the stairs.  Dean went up, since the wedding was downstairs.  He kept going, stopping at the fourth floor.  The formerly haunted as hell hallway and rooms were gone.  Only support studs, wiring, and a few doorway markers were left, leaving the space a gaping level of wood floor.
“Mahoney,” Dean swore.  “But he’s not involved in the strip mall thing.”
Dean blinked up at him, chest still rising and falling with anticipation.  There was merriment in his eyes and eagerness in his hands as they skated along Castiel’s sides.
“You smell like Vidal Sassoon,” Gabe grinned.
“Why didn’t you just move Fred to a different nursing home?” Dean asked, his mind spinning.
“Me and Sam used to do this too,” Dean said, trying to make the kid feel more comfortable.
Dean stretched, capturing Cas’ hand, which was still tracing little lines over his ribs.  “You’re a pain in the butt.”
Castiel scoffed.  “How would you know.”
“Dean,” Sam pleaded.
“I suggest you escort Balthazar off the property,” Benny added.  “Before I forget why I’m stoppin’ my friend here from beatin’ the shit out of him.”
“We’ll help you clean it out when we get home,” Castiel laughed, putting an arm around him to shake him from his souring mood.
A general chuckle broke out in the crowd as his daughter, a pretty young lady with brownish-red hair also in a jaunty, swinging ponytail, smiled sweetly.
“Yeah.  Yours too.”
Dean looked down at his socked feet.  “Mom told me what you did so Sam could come see me graduate tonight.”
“Cas and Sam are running the wedding.  Gabe’s out with Bobby and Loki.  Ellen’s at the Roadhouse.”
Cas stepped back another step as Dean turned toward him.  “No.  I suppose I could send a few postcards out to some friends.”
“Well hello there!” A tall, thin man stood on their porch with a grinning blonde beside him, holding a tray of cupcakes.
She shrugged, looking around the room.  “Funerals bother a lot of people.”  She got lost in a bit of a daze for a moment.  “Goldy’s happy.  She’s free of all her aches and pains.”
Not with that devilishly handsome grin and that hot ass.
“We don’t know enough yet,” Cas insisted.  “But we’re looking into it.”
“Promises, promises,” Castiel muttered, knowing Dean heard him.  If word play was what he wanted, Castiel was doing his best.
Dean sighed.  The brothers spree in Florida had left a bad taste in their mouths for the law.  While they had been out of hand in some regards, they had really been through the wringer there.
“No,” Dean sighed, sitting on the lumpy sofa that was quite a fine piece at one point in time long, long ago.  “What do you know about werewolves?”
“I got ya!  Sorry, my bad.  For ten minutes I forgot I was in Charming Acres.”
“Yep,” Sam nodded.
Chapter 3:   A Good, Old-fashioned, Neighborly Picnic
“Yeah!” Sam grinned, spotting the little telescope set up on the patio.
“Better,” Cas quirked a grin, “I encouraged Melanie to demand an autopsy.  And the coroner denied it, but it was re-instated when the sheriff got an anonymous tip that something was fishy with Goldy’s meds.”
“I figured that out,” Cas snickered, kissing his neck, and pulling him even closer, their feet entangling comfortably.  Dean snuggled in, sighing and truly relaxing in his arms.  “I thought I might die before you so much as touched me in bed.”
Dean blushed.  “I bet it was, then.”
Dean put one elbow on the table and his other arm around Cas’ shoulders.  “I don’t like that guy, Cas.  I never did.”
His curiosity got the better of him as he watched Dean getting water from the fridge.
“But you’re a welder by trade, are you not?” Cas asked, serving Ms. Dowling and then himself.
Castiel went back to the bedroom, closing the door quietly.  Dean was in bed, covers pulled over one shoulder.
Castiel had to laugh.  “Really?”  His nerves were sparking.  He had never really talked to Dean on this kind of level before.
Worry crossed Sully’s expressive face.  “If you didn’t see anything, I can’t help you take it to the police.  But you can always call Childline.”
“That’s awful,” Dean murmured.
“I have a rap sheet too,” Cas snipped.
“You here to listen to Chip’s campaign speech?” Sam asked.
Gabe nodded.  “Cas is on to them.”
Everyone broke into laughter and yells of him to stop being a pig.  Gabriel laughed, sitting back to swat away several pillows thrown at him.
They headed to Melanie’s but parked in front of Sam and Gabe’s house since Maggie now had two cars parked in front of Sue’s house, crowding into the front of Melanie’s.
“People are dyin’, Bobby,” Rufus said, all his taunting gone.  “You’re a good man, Bobby Singer.  Fred tells you so every day.”
“By the way,” Dean went on, splashing water onto his face, then scrubbed it dry with his shirt.  “Your neighbor lady down the road is a bitch.  Not Melanie next door, but the lady that yells at her daughter all the time.  That kid of hers is gonna grow up and fuckin’ -’’ he turned catching sight of Cas standing there.  “Ho! Shit!  Cas!”  His startled green eyes went wide.  “I thought you were Gabe!”
“Cas!” Sam exclaimed, sitting up and getting to his feet.
“Good,” Sam answered easily, squeezing Gabe’s hand.
This room was where they had sleepovers, they played games, they spent their rainy days, and one of the two places in this world where Castiel felt comfortable and at home.
She huffed a laugh through a shaky breath.  “Stop.  This wasn’t your fault, Castiel.”  They held a meaningful look as her mouth trembled while holding a smile.  Cas nodded, looking about as put together as she was before he turned to Camille, hugging her as well.
Brandy sat down at the table.  “There’s no cure?”
Dean grinned.  “Good.  See you in there.”  He stepped back, letting Castiel away from the wall.
Castiel’s jaw gaped.  Here he was, held in the crook of Dean’s arm, his hand on the back of his neck. So, so, so, close.  And... brothers?  Oh no.
Lunch was better this year by far.  Seniors all had lunch together, putting him with his friends.  He had never felt more comfortable in his own skin.
“Fellas,” Garth interjected, “this is crazy.”
“Her doctor says it’s perfectly normal during...” her eyes flitted to PJ and back to them as she re-smiled, “during childhood.”
Garth nodded, looking excited.
“Son of a bitch,” Bobby mumbled, sitting more upright.
Dean waggled the bottle in his hand.  Castiel gave their moms a nervous glance.
He realized with a start that Dean’s dick was pressed hard against his ass cheek, grinding and rutting.  Castiel pressed harder into him, hearing Dean huff in his ear.
Goldy blinked a few times, the locked-up look of terror passing into a weary, dull look in her eyes.  Her grip weakened in his hand and he looked up as more aides and the other RN came into the room.
“Yeah, Gabe seemed pretty damned happy this morning,” Dean grinned, sitting on the corner of the desk.
Sam tapped his straw to the bottom of his glass, stabbing his ice cream with a thoughtful frown.  “No, that would be ridiculous.  But we could do some digging.  See what we can turn up.  I mean, if we’re going to stay here, we should know what kind of place we’re raising our children in.”
Sam could hear Sully gulp from several feet away.
Cas’ eyes opened a bit wider, giving him a shocked look, but he kept control of his jaw this time.
“Ms. Dowling?” Cas called.
Castiel’s smile bloomed.
“Good.  I don’t like to upset you.”
************************************
And he knew if this bothered him, it bothered Sammy even more.
They had driven for over an hour, hand in hand, a silence so comfortable that you would think he and Dean knew each other intimately for the past five years instead of barely on the fringe of existing.
Castiel nodded, buckling his seatbelt.  This seemed the part of this adventure that could go wrong or right.
“Will you still be in town by Labor Day?” Cindy asked Dean, hands clasped at her belly like she really was an animatronic doll from DisneyWorld.  Today, her blonde hair was curled down just below her ears and her black dress was trimmed with white lace cuffed short sleeves and a white belt.
Cas patted Gabe’s knee.  “Kevin and his family spoke perfect English.  They were in Japan for his mother’s work.  Kevin’s family is actually Chinese in descent, and Kevin was born in Canada.  They hired me in hopes that Kevin would not only have someone to talk to, but I do speak some Japanese, making communication with healthcare providers easier.  But you’re right.  I’ve been so cut off from...living.”
“The Bermans, like I said, live there.  Linda and Maddie.  Nice lady.  And then there’s the Carrigan’s old house.”  Sam stared, both he and Garth were familiar with what the Carrigan’s had been like.
Chapter 6:  Jinkies
“Business,” Bobby and Rufus said darkly, both staring out over the picnic crowd like there were piranhas in the waters.
Dean was surveying the room with an openly critical eye, even more suspicious than before.
His body was completely relaxed, an easy smile on his face, and two warm washcloths in his hands.
“Watch this!”  Fletcher ran, sliding in his socks to the other end of the room, strumming an air guitar.
“High noon,” Gabe nodded.  “I’ll let Sam know and we’ll be there.”
Dean merely grinned back at him.
Gabe grinned wide.  “I’d try it.”
Naomi laughed.  “Fine.  You aren’t grounded.  But I expect perfect behavior for the next week and a half of school.”
Dean nodded.  A grin crept onto his face.  “I didn’t mean to out you like that, man.  I won’t say anything.”
“What are you doing here?” He asked, really not sure what to make of this guy.
“You too, Marion.  Thank you for inviting me to tea.”
“I didn’t see the gun until the pushy one got in,” Madge pouted.
“She’s at The Roadhouse.  I...asked Ellen if she could get her a job.”
Sonny, her eyes looking sharper than the other robots, actually stopped pouring coffee to talk.  “No.  Because if there was a real problem, they might have to admit that someone in Charming Acres wasn’t actually perfect.”
“Well, well.  Someone’s having a party,” Dean grinned.
Castiel’s eyes were wide.
Luc nodded slowly.  “I’ll try.  I get a bad rap, you know?  Everyone expects the worst of me.  I just...feel like I need to deliver.  Ya know?”
They all gave him a half-nod.  He wound his way through the crowd again.  He saw Gabe and Chuck across the sea of blankets and people, heading toward the rest of the group.
Dean gave him a startled look at first, but quickly caught on.  He glanced around, falling in step beside him rather than in front of him.  “Well, look at you gettin’ brave.”
“I try,” he grinned impishly, getting a kiss for his adorableness.  “I wonder how our brothers are doing on their date.  Hopefully Dean has figured out Cas isn’t gonna bite him.  Unless he wants him to, then I don’t know anything about that.”
Cas gave his little big brother a resigned look.  “It seems Hanscum is new to town and might not be as blinded by the town’s motto as the others.”
Dean grinned.  “You can try.”
“Oh no,” Cas gasped.
Sam grinned as Gabe went on about their ordeal with getting their furniture moved.  He took the distraction to kick Dean’s toe under the table, lifting one brow when his brother looked up at him half startled.  “You good?” He mouthed.
“And I haven’t gotten to it yet.”
Castiel ran a hand through his hair.  He looked away but looked back almost instantly.  “I’ll be fine.”
Gabe pouted but bit his lips together.  Castiel grinned, letting him go, flopping back down, shoving Gabe back out.
“So... you got a boyfriend?” Dean asked.
“Now Cas is here too.  Would you please ask them what we talked about?”
As Dean drove toward Sioux Falls, expectation had him feeling antsy.  The sun had set, leaving Dean’s eyes to dance along the oval of light his headlights gave him on the nearly empty stretch of highway ahead of them.  He sighed again, noting how tight his jaw felt.  Cas gave him another side-eye, patiently waiting for him to explain why his fingers had been drumming nervously along the steering wheel for the past ten miles.
Bobby only looked mildly surprised.  “Didn’t take you two long to figure out how things work around here.”
“Luc.  Hello, it’s Castiel.”  Castiel shoved his hands in his pockets nervously.  “I...”
“Whatever,” Wayne waved them off.  “The point is, you’ve landed in a game you aren’t equipped to play.”
“Dude, you tell people when you’re ready.  Your secret’s safe with me.”
“Okay,” Dean grinned harder, not opening his eyes.  “Me too.”
“Sparkle?” Gabe asked, wondering if there was a dog he hadn’t seen.
“Gross,” Dean huffed.
Footsteps in the hall did not deter either of them.  He clutched Dean’s thigh hard and Dean sped up.  He could hear someone in the bathroom and tried to stifle his moans.  He bit onto the corner of the pillow in his hand, coming hard.  Dean stroked him through several thrusts, cum shooting into the bed and slicking Dean’s hand.
“What the fuck?” Dean muttered under his breath.
“Sweet!”  Dean made a beeline for Sam.  “C’mon!  Don just drove up the street!  We can catch him at home if we move quick!”
When Dean stepped aside, Melanie took another shaky breath as she caught sight of Gabe.  Heartbreak was written all over her face when she said, “Grandma adored you.”
“He just ditched us,” Cas said incredulously.
After swimming and playing frisbee, they were all ready for a big dinner.  They drug their sandy gear back to the beach house, Dean was muttering about the state of his car from the road trip.  Gabe had left a candy wrapper wedged into the backseat, a smear of chocolate left behind.
“All of you need a crash course in stealth,” Rufus stated.
Cas cried out in ecstasy, feeling his neglected cock swing heavily beneath him.  He gripped the headboard and took every bit Dean gave him.
Ohgod.  He knew.  Dean knew.  Castiel tried to drag a breath of air in as Dean pulled onto the old highway.
“Imelda, Goldy, and Sheila all seem to have missing jewelry,” Sam explained quietly.
“Chocolate?  Or feeling adventurous?”
Sam opened the door, Garth and Sully coming inside.
“That’s Maggie Stark,” Deb whispered after Madge and Nellie moved on.  “Her husband, Don, is talking to your brother over there.”
“Oh he tells me how awesome Sam is every time I see him,” Gabe grinned with a glint of jealousy.
***************************************************
Gabe’s amused look traveled from him to Dean and back.  “Well, you crazy kids have fun.”
The table fell quiet again.
Everyone’s eyebrows shot up and mouth dropped.
The door upstairs opened.  “That’s probably Benny,” Dean said quietly.
“Jesus,” Cas and Dean both sighed.
Sam’s head dropped into his hands.
“No, he isn’t.  What he did was wrong.  I was...shocked.  And I want nothing to do with him or his business.”
“Hello, Mary.  Mom.”  He stopped in the doorway between the living room and kitchen.
“Where the fuck are you?”
“He’s had plenty of shitty reality.  Ya know, Cas says of all the kids, he was the one who caught hell all the time.  He laughs it off, Sam, but he was a punching bag for a long time.  Too long.  Michael and Hannah were nothing short of cruel to him.  But he would NOT leave because of his dad and Cas.  Everyone but Cas has left him.”
“I’ll see if I can’t slip in and cheer her up,” Gabe winked, making Marion grin.  “Miss Goldilocks, you better eat that waffle before I run out of granola bar,” he added, getting a faint grin from her.  She did not look as perky today as she usually did.  In fact, she looked distracted.
“Cas!” Sam said, a pleading look tugging his eyes into puppy-dog status.
“And what exactly are you contributing?” Bobby griped back.
“Yes, Lee,” Cas said more seriously to her father.  “I would be honored.  And you are welcome as well.”
Dean sat up, taking the washcloth.  Undeterred, Cas simply started wiping him off with the clean one, still freaking smiling.
“Sam,” Bobby went on, “you are going to dig up anything on Mahoney, the Harringtons, the Starks, hell...see what you find on Sonny Harrington too.”
“Research?” Gabe asked, already pulling his work shirt off.  “For what?”
“Sam?  Well, he will be.  Just...start the paperwork.  I’ll bail his perky ass out too.”  He sighed, thinking about the hit their checking account and savings account were about to take.
Castiel watched as Jack drank greedily, his hands batting at the bottle with little to no grip.  His eyes blinked, and he stopped sucking long enough to take a big breath.  Little moans and noises made Castiel grin.
Dean smirked down at him.  “Buddy is shedding like a maniac all over my baby.  And I’m here to bounce you out.”
Dean’s mouth gaped as he turned to Cas with a grin.  He was plenty used to language like that, he just hadn’t expected it from sweet, mild-mannered Castiel angel-to-the-dying Novak!
Love you all!  Thank you so much for reading!  I’ve got several more fics in the works, so I’ll be around again soon!
“Gabe is going to Stanford with Sam if he gets the scholarship.”
Dean gripped Castiel’s waistband in return, pulling him tighter against him, his other hand clawing across Castiel’s back.
“Sonny used to be happy.  Now she does the fake smile thing,” Maddie said, as if it were a crying shame but that’s just how it was.  Her eyes shifted to Sam, making him swallow.  “That’s why us kids like you guys.  You aren’t fake happy yet.”
Well, Charlie would be his friend no matter what.  She would probably set the rest of them straight as well.  But at least he would know.  He could quit wondering what everyone would think.
Cas panted, shifting and pumping onto him already.
Gabe sat up, giving his too-serious sibling a gentle shove.  “Find a fun job!  Work in an ER or...how about for a plastic surgeon?  Bet they get to see some hot, naked bods!”
Pulling away slowly, feeling like he’d survived a relationship milestone that he wasn’t supposed to, he gave Cas one last kiss.  “Goodnight.”
“Creeps,” Sam muttered, making Cas snicker.
Dean flicked the cap.  It clinked on the side of the sink, clattering to the drain catch.
Castiel didn’t even give Charlie’s little car a thought.  He pulled open the passenger door and called shotgun before anyone had a chance.  Sam, Gabe, and Chuck got in the back seat, the others leaving with Charlie.
Sam sat down, scrutinizing him with that ‘counselor’ look he got sometimes, making Dean squirm inside.  “Dean...I didn’t know you liked Cas that much.  I mean...you guys barely know each other.”
“Promise.”
Castiel was scrolling through videos on his phone when Dean sat next to him on the couch.
“I think Sonny is gonna be okay.  Her issues seem to be brought on by her father.  He won’t be around anymore, so...”
Dean grinned, looking down at the table as he blushed.  “Yeah.  Okay.”
Sam rolled his eyes.  “He does not.  He’s asexual, for starters, and he’s just...he cares about how people feel.”
Gabe’s stomach clenched.  “What do you mean?  What’s going on with them?”  He stood up, pacing in Marion’s room.
“Mm,” Cas agreed, catching Dean’s eye, holding the gaze until Dean looked away with a blushing grin.
“Most likely.  I seem to have stirred up a decent investigation.   Dean texted to tell me he was at the hospital visiting the Himuras.  Then Sheriff Hanscum texted me.  She wants me to come down to the station and ‘talk’.”
After kissing Cas and congratulating Gabe and Charlie, Dean whacked Lee on the shoulder.  “You brought a gun?”
“My mother would kill me if baby-daddy Luc started hanging around.  She thinks Gabriel’s questionable.”
Gabe and Sam died on the video game and surrendered their controls to Chuck and Charlie to play next.
Cas scoffed.  “It’s very...clean.  Ms. Dowling runs a tight ship.  A very pink, tidy, old-fashioned, tight ship.”  The long statement was followed by another sigh.  “Let’s just say, I was looking forward to tonight for more than one reason.”
Dean might act like he didn’t really have an interest, but his dick had been as hard as Castiel’s.  He had blushed and there was a look...he was sure Dean had wanted to kiss him.  So, what the hell did that mean?
“What sort of business?” She pried.
Castiel nodded, then shook his head no.  “I think my fingers are broken.”
Their dicks collided, hot, stiff skin to skin, head to shaft to balls.  Both looked down in shock as the jostled towels now lay puddled around their feet.
“Do I need to separate you two?!” Doug yelled, banging on the bars.
Sam grinned.  “I’ve given Gabe tons of stuff over the years.”
“Nah,” Dean yawned.  “I’m good.”
Cas grinned, licking his lips slowly.  “You want to go camping?”
Dean pulled him in, kissing him until he thought he might pass out.  Again, Cas went to pull them onto the bed.  “Uh uh,” Dean huffed, shoving Cas over a step, shoving the nightstand down a few feet.
“And dinner,” Castiel repeated a mite wistfully.  “That sounds perfect.”
“Dude, the bedroom door was wide open.  You guys bought a bed?”
“Enough!” She shouted.
“Sam!” A man in a yellow and white striped shirt with jeans and rainbow suspenders came toward them with a huge grin.
Castiel bit down harder.  He didn’t really have to answer.
Castiel opened his mouth to say Sam had asked him to, but he knew that wasn't the real reason.  His gaze flickered to the floor.
Castiel didn’t know what to say to that.  He disagreed, of course, but he didn’t know how to make Dean understand.  But he never got the chance to figure it out, because the front door opened, and Sam called out, “Dean?”
Castiel slammed the door and briskly walked around to the driver’s side to slip in.
Castiel had certainly had enough alone time to last his entire life.  He'd have some more if he left, to return to his motel room that suddenly felt a little too grim and uninviting.
Castiel didn’t see Dean again for a week and, when he did, it was completely by accident.
Castiel didn't know what to say.  In truth, he'd forgiven Dean the moment it had happened.  He was right about one thing, though: "No, it isn't."
Dean laughed, and Castiel's gut fluttered at the sight of his smile again.  He didn't know what he'd said that was funny, but he felt proud nonetheless.  "Wow,
Mary Winchester’s house was on a normal residential street close to the outskirts of the town.  It was a standard two-floor home, the outside façade a muted green with a concrete walkway and stairs leading up to a white door.  The front yard wasn’t very large, but flowerbeds brightened it up on either side of the house.  There was a large tree with spiraling and sharp limbs, and Castiel couldn’t tell if it was mostly dead or if the leaves had already dropped from it for autumn.
Sam helped Mary shuffle out from between the couch and the coffee table, and they were about to turn toward the room's exit, but Mary abruptly started toward Castiel instead.  He must have looked like a deer in the headlights.  She pulled herself out of Sam's hold to wrap her arms around him.  "Goodnight, Castiel."
It took thirty seconds for her to fall asleep, her grip slackening around his.
He furrowed his brow at the caller ID, and picked up the phone.  “Gabriel?”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Winchester,” Uriel cut in, holding his hand out.
Soon, Dean’s smile faded, his expression shifting into something raw and melancholy.  Castiel felt his stomach sour where there was once sweet bliss.
Castiel shook his head.  He crushed some grass with the toe of his shoe.  “No,” he said, “but that doesn’t make it easier.”
“Mm.  You got a point.”
Castiel kept staring at Dean.  He stayed quiet for a long time.
All three of them laughed, but Castiel’s focus was on Dean.  His expression was genuine, free.  His eyes seemed to light up from the inside out, and he had one of those infectious grins that looked exactly like his mother’s.  When he smiled, lines crinkled around his eyes.  He was beautiful.
"Jesus—you're fuckin'—" Dean said, grunting with exertion.  "How are you so
And he could imagine Anna walking next to him on their way home from school.
“Mr. Winchester,” he called.  Dean’s elbow was working back and forth as he tightened something with a lug wrench.  He glanced up, his jaw tensing and shoulders sagging instantly when he saw Castiel.
Castiel slid the folder closer, hearing it whoosh as it glided across the plastic floral tablecloth.  He opened it and carded through the papers, giving them the once over.  Satisfied, he stood up and said, “Everything appears to be in order.  I can send these in today, and they’ll be processed along with the rest of your application within seventy-two hours.”
Uriel waited, like he expected an argument.  But Castiel wouldn’t put the Winchesters in the middle of this, not with everything else going on.  They’d receive another Guide.  The transition would be painless for them.  They could focus on Mary’s arrangements.  They didn’t need Castiel causing any more disturbances.  So, if this was the decision, Castiel would obey.
“Huh?  Oh.  No, I—uh.  It’s a cold night.  I wanted to see if you needed any more blankets.”
“Thanks,” Sam said.
Dean tensed up a little, and he stayed unmoving for half a second too long.  But he said, “Uh, yeah.  Okay, I guess.”
“Yeah, but there’s a catch.”
And it was then that Castiel remembered why he was there, why his path had crossed with Dean’s.  And this was so beyond getting attached.  This might even be considered taking advantage.  It was wrong, and inappropriate.
Castiel put the strap of his bag over his head.  “No need.  Everyone processes the situation in their own time.  It isn’t easy to grapple with, much less accept.”
But perhaps Dean knew that Castiel was
Dean protested the entire way, and even tried swatting Castiel’s hand, but it was a lame attempt.  Castiel shoved Dean into the passenger seat of his car.  Instantly, all the fight left Dean.  He slumped against the seat, grumbling to himself like an angsty teenager.
He was just about to suggest that when the ringing stopped.  Gabriel’s voice came over the line: “Hey there, Castiel.  You on your way back to Boston yet?”
“Go fuck yourself,” Dean told him heatedly, and that must have wrapped up his tirade, because he turned around on the heels of his boots and walked off.
“And how’s her son?  Charlie, wasn’t it?”
He trailed off, but Castiel knew what he was saying.  He couldn't stop thinking about kissing him.  "Yeah, I can't, either," Castiel admitted.  Even now, he could feel the touch of Dean's mouth on his.  He wanted it again so badly—and to hear that Dean wanted it, too . . .
"Shut up, Sam.  You'd do something lame like Phil Collins."
When the hug broke, Mary went back to Sam, and they started out of the room.  "'Night, Cas," Sam said over his shoulder.  Castiel was still too caught up in the memory of Mary's embrace to respond, but he thought he smiled back shakily.
He forgot what he was supposed to say next.  His eyes flashed to Dean.  Dean looked back, but only for a moment before returning to Mary.
The man raised both his brows, his forehead scrunching in the motion.  His eyes were a golden shade of green as the sun hit his face.  “Can I help you?” he prompted, somehow making it sound sarcastic.  His voice was deep and rough, as if it were coming out of the trees and grass and moss and everything that smelled ripe and earthy after the rain.
Castiel didn’t allow himself to pause.  He took the manila file folder out from his worn soft leather, cross body briefcase and set it down on the table next to his container of food.  He fished out his fountain pen and got to work.
Dean shrugged.  “Same old.  She says hi.”
In the meantime, Mary looked up at Sam.  “Honey, where’s your brother?”
Mary shook her head.  “No.”
“So, what d’you say?” Gabriel asked.  “Stay with the Winchesters, or go to Denver?”
Castiel’s forehead lined in confusion.
He wanted to stay.  Maybe he would be taken off Mary’s case.  Maybe he’d even be fired.  It didn’t really matter.  He wasn’t leaving.  He was staying with the Winchesters, with Dean.  He would fight for them, with them.  He would remain at Dean’s side.
It was morning, a few hours after sunrise.  The rays of light were streaming into Mary’s bedroom, hitting the foot of the bed.  She was beneath the covers, still in her pajamas.  She’d said there was no need to get dressed up, because, after all, she was “supposed to be comfortable, right?”
“Emotional?” Dean repeated.
"Dean,
“Dean . . .”
It took Castiel off his guard.  This hadn’t been the first time he’d been invited to share a meal with a patient, but this was the first time he actually wanted to.  “I—”  He looked at Mary, and then Sam’s polite face, and then to Dean.  Dean didn’t seem to want him to stay very much at all.
Castiel got to work.
Sam moved his head in a way that could either be construed as a nod or a shake.  "Yeah, no—she's—they think she'll pull through."  He pressed a hopeful smile to his lips, like he was an attempt to comfort Castiel.  Castiel realized it should have been the other way around.
Castiel gritted his teeth.  “Right,” he lied.
"Actually, they're not.  I drive."
Sam knelt down at her side and offered a kind smile.  “Hey, Mom.  This is Castiel Novak.  He’s here about that application we sent in.”
The line went quiet again, but that time, Castiel could almost hear Gabriel thinking.  All three of the Winchesters were staring at him in anticipation.  Castiel’s stomach was in knots.
Usually, Castiel hated that nickname.  His parents never used it, and Anna only ever did when she was teasing him.  Gabriel sometimes called him Cas, but he'd given himself that liberty.  Everyone else who had called him that where casual acquaintances who did it without his permission, and it always made him grind his teeth.
"Oh," Sam said again, this time softer.  He looked down, his jaw tensing and his nostrils flaring out a little.  "Right."
He fished for his keys in his coat pocket and fumbled with them slightly as he opened the car door with probably more force than was necessary.  Once inside, in the warm and confined bubble of privacy, he let himself breathe.  He didn’t allow himself to panic.  He shoved all emotion down again and drove off.
Castiel’s brows knitted together.  He’d been there for weeks.  He had rent, bills to pay.
“He’s fine,” Sam said in a placating way.  Castiel relaxed, but cautiously so.  He heard shuffling over the line, like Sam was switching his phone from one ear to the other.  “He went out to get us both a bite to eat . . . three hours ago.”
Each time it happened, he found himself staring off at one of the religious items around the house.  He realized he’d never asked Mary why she’d decorated her home in such a way.  He didn’t know why, but the thought caused his skin to prickle.  Mary was gone and he hadn’t fully processed it until that moment.
And it was sad, because, "Dean, I can't."
“May we enter?” Uriel asked.
,” Castiel said, hoping to calm him down.  He laid a hand to Dean’s shoulder—and he realized he had no idea what to say to make it better.  A thousand different concepts rattled around his mind, but he couldn’t shape them into words.  He gave up trying to, and lamely settled on, “Dean, I wish I could protect you from this.”
Dean had surprised him by coming over the previous night to watch a movie—much to Castiel’s dismay.  Castiel spent much of the evening sitting on the opposite side of the bed from Dean, putting as much space between them as possible and keeping his arms and ankles tensely crossed.  A nervous undercurrent hummed beneath his skin the entire time.  All he could think about was his last phone call with Gabriel and Uriel’s imminent arrival.
This had been the first time he'd seen Dean since their kiss, but he'd thought about him every second—as if he hadn't done that before.  It didn't help that, throughout the evening since Castiel arrived, they'd been coyly meeting each other's eyes from across the room, both of them abruptly flushing and looking away.  During dinner, Castiel's foot had accidentally brushed against Dean's under the table, and he withdrew it quickly only for Dean to quite deliberately bump their feet together again.  It had caused giddiness to flood through Castiel, and he still hadn't quite come down from the high the endorphins had created.
But this wasn’t about him.
Castiel turned his head to look up at him, grinning.  “I think I might be able to do something.”  Dean smiled back before they came together, kissing as quietly and lazily as the snow falling outside.  Without breaking the kiss, Castiel turned around to face Dean.  He cradled Dean’s jaw with his palm, slowly rubbing back and forth along his stubble.  Dean sighed into him, his hand roaming up and down Castiel’s hip and thigh.
“Yes.  I was . . .” he fished around his head for a lie, “jogging.”
Luckily, she didn’t take very long as all.  She picked up the hood, the plastic tube connecting it to the nitrogen tank propped up beside her dragging across the comforter.  She gave another breath, as if relishing in her last inhale of fresh air, and placed the hood on her lap.  “Thank you, Castiel,” she said.  “Would it be too much to ask you for one more thing?”
Across the table, Sam shot Dean a frustrated look.  At least one of them knew they wouldn’t get very far with hostility.
“I’m calling an ambulance,” he heard Sam say from somewhere far away.  He was vaguely aware of Sam taking out his phone and holding it to his ear.  He still couldn’t move.
Castiel shook his head sadly.  “Dean, if I could do that—” He swallowed, knowing that this was crossing a line, knowing he shouldn’t say it, shouldn’t even think it.  But it was true.  “I would give anything to have you not go through this.”
“Stupid fuckin’ serial killer,” Dean mumbled, and Castiel rolled his eyes.  He was exhausted, and he was at his wit’s end with Dean Winchester.
,” Castiel corrected.  Dean appeared even more confused.  Castiel didn’t know how to explain.  It was best to be direct: “I received a call from one of my superiors a few days ago.  He believes my daily reports have been . . . too emotional.”
"Goodnight, honey," she said, giving Dean a kiss on the cheek.
After some time, he became aware of someone watching him.  The sensation slithered through the air and sent a shiver down his spine.  He looked toward the door, where Uriel was standing.  Uriel lingered momentarily before turning and disappearing out of the threshold.  Castiel knew he wanted him to follow.
That night, when he returned to his motel room, he saw he had a missed call from Gabriel.  It was strange.  Gabriel usually didn’t call him during the course of an assignment.  They only ever spoke when he was sending Castiel on a new case.  The daily reports didn’t count as actual communication, since they were usually one-sided.
“Good,” he said, schooling his thoughts into something more orderly.  “Protocol also requires me to ensure you don’t have any doubts about what is about to happen, that you’re of sound mind, and you understand that you can still opt out.”
“Yes, I—you’re welcome.  For the ride,” he stammered back, feeling an embarrassed blush of his own creeping up his neck.  It was clear that neither of them would soon
Castiel swallowed.  "And thank you again for letting me stay for dinner."
Castiel pulled his brows together and looked at her briefly before returning his eyes front.  It was dusk, and the orange and purples of the sunset bruised the air along the road.  "No, I mean . . . Are you certain he'll be capable of carrying out your wishes should the need arise?"
“Dean, I—I’m sorry,” he said quickly.  “I shouldn’t have—”
Perhaps Castiel was only projecting now—or maybe not.  He understood Dean’s sitatuation more than he’d wanted to.  And he was hoping to help Dean in a way no one had offered him, but Dean’s expression had only turned stony.  His eyes flashed and brows knitted together like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.  “She isn’t a burden.  I’m not gonna be relieved when she’s gone.”
Castiel held his stare, but he felt his stomach roil at the question.  No one had ever asked him that before.
Dean nodded, a lump moving slowly down his throat as he swallowed his bite.  Castiel watched his Adam’s apple bob.  “Yeah.  Is now, anyway.”  He explained, “It was my dad’s.  Before . . .”  He cut himself off and looked down.
"He's rough around the edges.  He gets that from his father—and me," she said when she was done coughing.  "He's not an easy person to like.  But you do, don't you?"
"It was a car crash.  He didn't die right away."  She spoke slowly, her sweet face in the window's reflection long and downcast.  "He was in a coma for a few weeks in the hospital, hooked up to machines.  We . . . We kept hoping . . . But none of us really knew what to do.  None of us wanted to make the decision, you know?"  She shrugged.  "So we just—didn't.  And then, one day, he slipped away."
As soon as they were through the door, the sweet smell of cooking meat arrested Castiel’s senses.  His mouth instantly started to water, and his stomach felt hollow.  He helped Mary out of her outerwear and set her care bag on the bottom step of the staircase.  He kept holding her oxygen tank as they walked together toward the kitchen.
“Oh, Mary, please.”  Her voice was soft and she sounded young—at least, far too young to be dying.
“Yeah, how ‘bout we make it strictly nothing?” Dean shot back.  He stood up suddenly, still glaring.  Castiel tilted his head up to stare back, simmering.
Hope sparked in Castiel’s chest at the words.  It was in Mary’s voice, too, when she asked, “So, you’ll do it?  He can stay?”
But it was best not to.  He didn’t need to know Dean on a personal level.  The policy of keeping his distance from the people in his charge was for his own good; and, beyond that, it was better for him regardless of his job.  If he didn’t have anyone, that meant he didn’t have anyone to lose.
He wasn’t supposed to do that.  He was supposed to sit back and observe only.  He was not supposed to get involved in any way.
The Winchesters dove right into eating, not saying grace or holding a moment of silence first.  It was a little odd, considering the religious sigils they had all over their house.  There was even a statue of the Virgin Mary next to a four-armed Hindu god that Castiel didn’t know the name of over the stove.
Castiel didn’t know if he should tell them.  But they were all looking at him, expecting an answer, and he didn’t want to let them down now that he was pulled back into the conversation.  He wanted to be a part of it.  He supposed telling them where he was from wasn’t too personal.  After all, everyone was from somewhere.
He heard Dean clear his throat.  "So, what brought you all the way to Kansas?  Besides, you know . . ."
“But cancer isn’t a car accident,” Castiel said.  Dean looked at him suddenly, eyes lost and vulnerable.  Castiel continued, “There won’t be anything to fix once your mother’s gone.  That makes you afraid.”
Dean licked his lips.  “No one should have to go through this.”
With a fit of spontaneous bravado—or maybe it was madness—he spun back around to face the door, but before he could bring his fist up to knock, it swung open again.  Dean was there, eyes large and round and searching.  He seemed shocked that Castiel was still there before his expression rearranged into stark determination.  Then, he stepped out into the cold, and Castiel met him halfway.
“C’mere,” she whispered, bringing them both in against her.  The hug lingered, and Castiel felt wrong.  This was a private moment.  He should look away.  He didn’t.  He looked at Dean.
He wasn’t any more relieved when Gabriel said, “Okay, put me back on speaker.”
The next morning, the sun was barely a line on the horizon as Castiel threw his toiletry bag into his luggage to head out.  He didn’t have much with him, as experience had taught him how to pack light.  He carried enough for a week between laundry days—a few pairs of slacks, seven button-up shirts, pajamas, socks, jogging clothes, and a suit and tie for the primary meeting with a candidate and their departure date.  He was in an old pair of jeans and a t-shirt at the moment, ready to set out into the gray dawn for the long trip to Boston, when his cell phone started to ring.
He slipped his thigh between Dean’s legs and moved it up and down, and found Dean was already half-hard in his jeans.  Dean jerked his hips, hissing a little.  Castiel pressed himself against Dean’s hip, and tried hard not to hump against him like some kind of high schooler losing his virginity, but it was difficult to do.  He wanted so badly to snap his hips against Dean’s body, to lose himself in the feeling of it as he breathed in Dean’s scent.  Everything about Dean was intoxicating, and Castiel was hopeless in the face of it.
