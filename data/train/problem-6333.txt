“Why don’t you tell me?”  He suggested, carefully.
So why did the thought make him feel so uneasy?
Tony shivered for a moment, then his whole body relaxed and he breathed easier.
“Why tell me this now?”  Steve asked.

Steve finished unbuttoning his coat, and managed to look both like a wet dream, and completely miserable.

at that sight.  Even the Skull’s -stance- had been correct, unsurprising in a canny villain who must have seen Captain America do it dozens of times.  Peter dodged the Red Skull’s attack at the last moment, and the shield sliced into a framed Jackson Pollack print on the wall behind him with a sudden crash of shattering glass.

“…Yeah, I think I could use one,” Steve admitted, tucking his shirt back into his jeans.
First thing you see…”
Tony’s eyes opened, looking down at the other man intently.
“He did?  Well, that explains a lot,” Tony said, careful to keep his smirk within bounds.  “-Listen, I don’t know when they’ll be back, and I’ve gotta get back to work here…”  Tony gestured towards the Mustang.
“Maybe when this is all over, you should.”
Tony’s song began with five individual guitar notes, a relatively slow drum score, and a complex, cascading shimmer of something light, with bells.  Underneath it was a scattering of subtle, clear sounds that Steve

“Actually… no,” Tony admitted, drawing back a little, “-the shield is, ah… yours.  And besides, the lower edge of the metal is really digging into my back here…”
Peter woke up in a hospital room he’d never seen before.  He wasn’t wearing his mask, and there was a huge bald guy made of orange stone sitting in the too-small chair beside his bed reading a newspaper.  Peter suppressed the urge to jump at least twenty feet in any given direction and stick to a wall.  Ben Grimm’s eyes swiveled downwards, and met his.  Peter blinked.
“Peter called me yesterday, but I didn’t get the message until I got home from rehearsal.”
Tony took a deep, unsteady breath, and felt the slight weight of Steve’s hand on his shoulder.  Then he stood, and moved back out of War Machine’s way.
“Oh- I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there.”
“I’m- -not sure, exactly,” Steve admitted, “-around three weeks, I think.  Is it important?”
The scent was stronger now, like clean sweat, and the shadows in concrete-floored boxing-gym locker rooms, and maybe a faint hint of machine oil.

“Did -you- see this?”  Luke asked.
Steve’s loft, 6:04 AM.  1973.
Tony punched the man in the face with a hard, jabbing left.
Tony sighed through his nose, then opened his eyes deliberately and picked out a path across the gently rippling carpet towards the outside door with care.
“Aren’t you going to open that one?”  Peter asked, pointing to the manila envelope at Tony’s elbow, perilously close to a dollop of strawberry jam.
He stopped all the tapes, and peeled the white handwritten labels off carefully with a thin blade hidden in the index finger of his left gauntlet.  Then he swapped the labels with those on a set of tapes recorded a month ago, and put last month’s tapes into the corresponding machines, cued up to the same time.  There would be a momentary glitch, but nobody really watched these things at normal speed anyway…
The tech was a logical progression of what he’d seen in the burned-out warehouse, the speed and reflexes matched, but…
‘That depends on a lot of factors,’ Matt thought, smirking as he pulled on his mask.
“I’m not concerned with Morgan Stark,” Steve put in, licking the dollop of butter off the back of his left hand, “-War Machine is the one I have to work with, he’s shown himself to be A-okay so far.  He’s rough around the edges, but with a boss like that I’ll bet he has to be.  …He reminds me a lot of

, Tony’s reluctantly returning thoughts assured him.  He remembered to breathe with a sudden gasp and tasted blood from where he’d bitten his lip.  He probed the damage with the tip of his tongue.  It wasn’t deep.
“I thought you didn’t like this song,” he said, making it a question.
And what a perfect kick in the nuts it would be, if some over-eager reporter drove Steve back into sneaking down skylights in full costume.
“Its ten and a half pounds, without the straps,” Steve countered, not quite laughing against his ear.
…And what kind of deal could Morgan Stark have cut with
No voice emerged, but one of the red-gauntleted hands seemed to be trying to pry open the armor’s breastplate.  There was no visible catch though, and it was locked fast.
“What- -the
Peter took a black pen out of his backpack, and began drawing a bold strike-through across each duplicate bill.  Tony watched approvingly out of the corner of his eye for the first two, then started opening his personal mail.
“Yeah, I really did,” Peter agreed, grinning.
Tony glanced to the side momentarily, thinking.
Steve nuzzled the side of his neck drowsily, and let go of Tony’s sweat-slick hands to hug his shoulders securely, still buried deep inside.
“…My father had a library,” Tony said, his mind wandering.
“Are you crazy?!”  Richards, one of the other mall cops yelled in Easton’s face.  Richards’s skin was red with the exertion of running for the tackle, and his sad comb-over was sticking up at a forty-five degree angle.  “Quit trying to be a hero and RUN you idiot!”
“-What?”  Steve asked, looking into his face with concern.
The pre-bombing version of Centralia, Pennsylvania is real too, and /to this day/ the coal vein under the town is still on fire.
“Nope.  I can see the glow of the Infa-red bulbs on the wall behind you, but that’s it,” Tony said, looking pleased.
Color was returning to Iron Man’s sharp-lined face beneath its layer of five o’clock shadow, and the blackness of his damp hair and Errol Flynn mustache was beginning to stand out less unnaturally.
Tony snorted, but smiled, looking back down at his scanner.  Something wasn’t adding up.  He had isolated the bug on the bike and filtered that frequency out, but the scanner was still picking up a signal from somewhe-
“Moleman- -why…?”  Tony whined, raking his wavy black bangs out of his eyes with one hand.

“You have to know that I’ve cleaned blood-spatters off it, and paint, and vanilla ice cream, and tiny smears of lead from bullets, and some stuff from the floor of a barn that I’d rather not discuss…”

White-hot flames.  Pale blue, and incandescent orange.  Glowing like the thin tungsten filament in a light bulb magnified a hundredfold.  Heat that would vaporize flesh almost as fast as it burned.
“Yes,”  Tony said without hesitation,   “-C-12.”
Steve let him in, quickly.
Tony opened his mouth, and- -stopped.  There -was- nothing he could do about a multicode chemical/metals fire once it got up to temperature, and if the Halon tanks under the stairs and a half-ton of atomized sodium chloride deploying hadn’t been enough when the fire first began, nothing short of the FDNY chemical unit or one of Susan’s air-forms

“Hm-?”

After a minute, Peter frowned, and picked up two of the invoices.
The campus was alive with green leaves, and the June sky overhead held the promise of perfect flying weather.
“Shoot,” Steve smiled.
Pause.
Harry blacked out the canvas, killing the rest of the paint tube, then made up a palette of red, blue, white, and darkest gray.
But for Hank Pym there was only Janet Van Dyne.  His gossamer-winged goddess.  The only woman for whom he could submerge his ego, even temporarily.  The love of Hank’s life, and in a way his greatest -thankfully most flawless- experiment.

ago.  This morning, however… Steve wasn’t sure if it was just the very-nearly-awkward timing of Peter’s arrival, or the speed with which Peter had zeroed in on Tony’s workbench, but the young man felt more like Tony’s son to him than usual.
Tony joined Steve on the dance floor and offered the blond his hand, palm upwards.
.  -It’s a trilogy, actually.  I’ve got the first two books around here somewhere…”  Tony began.
“Yeah, I bet.  Thanks again for bringing this back, Wanda,” Tony smiled.
Tony sprayed down a rag with cleaning solution from an unmarked plastic bottle, and reached back into his gold-painted leg armor.  …This cleaning had
But now he… couldn’t feel any of that.
Peter swung back and forth on his webline like an irritated pendulum.  He favored Tony with a dubious look, then put out his hand upside-down to the corner of the desk, and stopped himself.
God she was beautiful, lying there under diffuse, cloud-tempered light that somehow told him they were in London…
Tony rubbed Steve’s side through both blanket and mail-shirt, slow and comforting.
“Enter,” Steve called, without getting up.
“I think you need a spotter,” Steve told him frankly.  “-I also think you should re-design that box of yours, because if I heard you right last night, it’s designed to blow out weak

him somehow.  Finding his landmarks, memorizing the terrain- -and incidentally, pressing them closer together.  Tony’s right hand fisted in the back of Steve’s collar, cloth and cowl alike, and a small frown of concentration settled in between the dark, clean curves of his eyebrows.
“Ah… yeah,” Tony admitted, “-but you didn’t give up, and you looked great doing it,” he assured him.
Tony left his right-hand radio on the police band, and re-tuned his left one.
She turned, and Tony shut the door.
The Iron Horse Garage, 8:31 AM.
“Not anymore.  You are…?”  He prompted, instantly making his visitor feel both rude and unwelcome.
Misty sighed uncomfortably and looked away again, chin in hand.
“Siddown,” Tony let go of him, and got a skillet out of the dish-drainer.
“You said you’d make me breakfast,” Whitney reminded him sulkily, “-not start work at seven in the morning…”
“All right…?”  Tony managed, a little breathlessly.

“Yeah, it was pretty cool,”  Peter cut in,  “-but by the time I got there answering, you know, the danger signal thing Tony had activated earlier, the Red Skull was trying to saw Tony’s head off with the handcuff chain, so I smashed ‘im over the head with a lamp-”  Peter illustrated this with a lassoing-and-pulling motion of his hands, “-and then we held a very painful game of keep-away with the Cosmic Cube until Tony woke up again, and then HE took the Cube…”

“Yes?”  Steve murmured.

“Tony, wake up.”
He set the inner armor sleeve down on the drop cloth to his left, and lifted the chestplate up onto the table with a muffled clang.
“I’ve been taking apart Harry’s hover-board,” Tony interrupted Steve’s train of thought without realizing it, “-and it’s fascinating.  I mean- -it’s a deathtrap that runs on ether-ethanol, but aside from that it looks a lot like the helical compression array I was working on for a hovercraft in freshman year.  -That’s what gives the board its speed.  I didn’t think to tune the helix for speed, because I’d made this bet that I could drive a Ferrari across the Charles River to Boston U., and I needed all the lift I could get to keep it off the surface of the water without the use of a-”
…And he was gone again.
Tony folded his arms down loosely at his sides, and felt the full weight of the shield settle squarely across his shoulders for the first time.
“I picked up the keys this morning,” Steve replied, “-do you like it?”
“It’s a setup,” Iron Man yelled bluntly, “-everybody back on the bus!  NOW!”
If she begged him to, Harry would probably stay here with her, safe.  She knew what buttons to push.  If she did that and Peter died though, it would destroy Harry from the inside out.  Harry had to go, and she had to stay here.  MJ had faced this reality before, and she still wasn’t sure who was getting the better end of the deal.
Holding Tony in his mouth still felt a little strange, and maybe it always would.  Still, it was something Steve could give, something he could understand.  A delicate balance of pressures, and technique, and care.  A kind of equality between men that needed no explanation, yet still allowed him to watch Tony come completely unglued in his arms.
The Avengers were moving through the reek in pairs, searching.  Wanda and Pietro spoke in his ear, unseen.  Warbird was a shadow against the skylights above, on her own outside.
“Where-” Tony sniffed, looking up, “-where’s Spider?”

“Anybody home?”  A vaguely familiar voice called from the open garage door.
“I… Venom was my costume, wasn’t he?”  Peter guessed, uncomfortably.
“Ah- -yeah,” Steve managed, “-sorry about that.”
“Can’t even remember to tell the chauffer to take her kid straight home from school when there’s a SWAT team all over the company lawn…”  Tony scowled.
Tony caught his breath, and looked into Steve’s resolute face with newfound understanding.  He closed the distance between them in two steps, pinned Steve firmly against the kitchen counter, and kissed him.  Steve’s forgotten coffee splashed across his own fingers and Tony’s hip, and they broke apart abruptly.
“No.  Take your helmet off,” Steve decided.
“Oh, I don’t know.  Good enough when I was in practice and it made me happy,” Steve shrugged.
And now he had the Iron dogs of war on his tail, and the Racer was right in front of him-
Harry let him go, and looked at him searchingly.
“…Eighteen.  You can vote at eighteen now,” Tony realized, catching his breath.

Harry Osborne in a rumpled button-down shirt, buried in physics class homework, looking up with an expression of humor and long-suffering patience.
Tony glanced at Steve with a lopsided smile of secret delight, and ran his hand over the shield’s barely-textured surface, like an Egyptologist brushing the sand from a row of inscribed hieroglyphics.
“Me too,” Tony smiled back.
Tony pretended to let go of the helmet radio’s button, and turned back to Jerome.
The reflected lights behind War Machine’s eyeslits shifted momentarily.
“…Would you?”  Steve asked, still watching his face.
Peter replied.
“…Where did that come from?”  Steve asked, his voice a little rough.
Pause.
Tony glided out across the room, paused with his gauntlets on the low brick windowsill, then pushed off and skated backwards.  He turned, reversing direction, and looked around more, still skating.
Tony’s eyes opened on the second try.  Tracked.  Focused on the back of Steve’s hand against the pale sheets.  Both sheets and hand were faintly illuminated by a shifting pale-blue glow, as if from within.
“Hm-?”
“Can’t you?”  Steve asked, relaxing.

May came back with Peter in tow, and Tony faced the boy squarely.  Both of them seemed to draw themselves up a little.
“I know.”  Tony paused, detaching Misty’s artificial hand entirely, and pressing in the flat stud on the inner radial frame that unlocked her outer arm-casing.  “So… how much did you win?”
“Two of these are yours,” he said, setting them down on his sleeping bag and picking up the open carton of sweet and sour pork.
Harry heard the door open, and looked up too quickly.  The world slid back and sideways a little.  Harry did his best to ignore that and blinked, wondering just how badly injured he was, under the drugs.
War Machine took the brunt of the impact, as Tony had meant for him to.
Tony broke momentarily into a cold sweat, took his cup of coffee from under the spout, and walked away as unobtrusively as possible.
Pause.
Tony moved the spider-tracer aside to sketch it in permanently, and- -stopped, his pencil poised.  With or without the spider, the design, the

The phone rang.
“U-hmn-” Steve whimpered, nodding.
.  As far as I’m concerned, that’s the closest America came to really losing.”
Tony could hardly blame him though, and with Peter sleeping over downstairs, maybe it was just as well…
Steve shot Tony a sidelong look, and both men stood.
Steve took Tony’s gauntlet, and walked out into the center of the room, absently handing Tony around behind himself in a circle.  Looking back, he saw two small black boxes with glowing red bulbs spaced far apart on the wall, pointing so that their beams overlapped.  They looked bright enough up there, but the dull red light they cast didn’t seem to carry very well.  Steve caught Tony as he skated around again, and stopped him.

“You have to know that it’s an unrepeatable experiment,” Steve continued, the corner of his cleft chin -just- scratching the back of Tony’s neck down near his shoulders.  “-And that there’s not another like it in the world.  If something happens to this shield… …it can never be replaced.”

“The- Red Skull was attacking my basic training barracks.  Gas attack.  Only- -there was a different Platoon there than the one I trained with, and Bucky and Peter’s friend Harry were in it.  There was yellow smoke everywhere, and- Tony, they hadn’t been issued gas masks yet.  They wouldn’t have known what to -do- with them, except for Bucky, and he didn’t…”
“Yeah, Mister Fantastic just finished checkin’ ‘im out,” Luke confirmed, “-s’all over the news.  I gotta go, man…”
“Captain, I’ll need to get this repaired soon.  Do you have any further orders for me?”
Harry had fallen asleep in the leather chair by the balcony doors again, and was just now waking up.
He could tell Tony was using the word ‘books’ loosely, and that this was going to be one HELL of an undertaking.  He was good with math, but catching the decimal point had been a fluke, a lucky break…  Then again, if he COULD turn this place around, a little extra cash would help out aunt May a lot, and his superpowers -did- take an unreasonable amount of food to maintain…
Tony looked down.
Steve came in, and shut the door behind him.
The two impressions, the two sets of possibilities in his mind warred for a moment.  Steve had come over, that was obvious.  But he’d had to do one of those horrible re-starts, and then gotten drunk, how…

The kid looked up, startled, then smiled.  He was good looking in a delicate ‘James Dean’ sort of way, and he stood almost as tall as Tony once he’d straightened up.
“Right on.  I’ll see you guys later.”
Tony shut the shower off, and stepped out dripping.  He toweled himself mostly dry, then wiped down the wrist-seal of the latex glove covering the front of his arc reactor carefully, and pulled it off with a snap.  Tony raised a hand to wipe the mirror so he could see to shave, and- -stopped.
“I need a shower,” said Peter.
A slight twinge in the muscles around the arc reactor in his chest brought Tony’s memory flooding back in a wave that left him momentarily nauseous.
“All right,” Steve said, and signed it
Tony pantomimed ripping something out of the bike.
Peter read the printed return address, and glanced back at him doubtfully.

“Are you ready to come out of that blanket now?”  Tony asked, rubbing Steve’s shoulder a little.
“Pleased to meet you,” Tony replied.
When he got up three hours later to refresh his cup of coffee, Tony glanced into the pan out of morbid curiosity.  There was some left…
“Actually, that wasn’t what I had in mind.  …But that means people have asked you if they could use your shield for obscene target practice before, doesn’t it?”
What if some busy little muck-raking weasel dug up the fact that Peter was roommates with Norman Osborne’s
“Really?  Are those easy to make?”  Peter asked, eagerly.
Tony spotted a bright flicker of red white and blue coming out of the warehouse.
Steve was good with that hand.  …And with his other one.
“Because-” Steve reached over for the knotted loop of green paracord that had replaced the jacket’s cloth zipper-pull and unzipped it, “-it’s not real anymore.”
“Nah, he went out somewhere earlier with my roommate,” Tony shrugged.

A layered guitar score started, then a slow backbeat with a snare drum in there somewhere…
“You- -oh.  I thought you’d want me to-” Tony broke off, and bit the inside of his lip.
Iron Man smirked behind his faceplate, and finished duct-taping Unicorn’s hands and feet together.  His helmet radio crackled to life.
…As long as you sorted out which was which -first-.
“Steve.  -Have you seen my helmet?  ‘S not here.”
Tony looked down at the Green Goblin.  He still half expected the villain to wake up and began fighting again…

Steve folded his free arm up over his head, and shut his eyes.
“Shrapnel, among other things.  If you got really lucky, you might get an upgrade out of it,” Tony joked, tapping the glowing front of his arc-reactor.
Tony walked up to Steve, and stopped.  He passed the scanner through the air in front of Steve’s body slowly, glaring at the readout in ferocious triumph when the indicator light on the device’s side switched from yellow to red.
“Anywhere you want, but mothers have been chucking out most of these records for decades,” Tony promised.
“Yes, why?”

One of the things that had surprised Peter when he’d first come to work here was how many sidelines Tony maintained in addition to the motorcycle repair shop.  It was a good thing too, or Peter suspected the shop would have gone under long ago.
“Why do you think he never came forward before?”  Peter pressed.  “-Do you think he still has his Super-Soldier powers, or would that have-“
“-You could’ve tried,” Tony agreed, dryly.

“Yeah, that’s the guy,” Jerome nodded.
“Mrbr… f’koff,” Tony responded from the couch, waving him away.
Pause.
At the time, Tony had been wiring the tower’s security system, and it had been good to talk to Jan without a lab-coated shadow…
Steve saluted him back solemnly, wondering for the first time just how many of the people who saluted him in this modern age did so simply to put him off his guard.
“Norman Osborne can kiss my ass,”  Tony said bluntly,  “-if he tries to blackmail you with your secret identity, we’ve got the wiring you ripped out of the Goblin Glider with part of an Ostech circuit board attached, and it’s all hearsay at this point anyway.  -Keep an extra careful eye out for being tailed for the next month or so, though.”
“-Time to go,”  Peter decided, executing a leap over the Red Skull’s head (he couldn’t stomach the idea of diving
“Venom’s gone, right?  It feels like he’s gone…”  Peter began.
“All right, ‘Big Brother’, what are you up to…?”  Peter muttered, webbing cautiously after him once War Machine had turned a corner up ahead.
“WHAT?!”
Steve ordered,
“Cap’s not just another cape.  He’s one of ours, and-“
“-Yeah, it’s me-” Peter was saying.
“What are you going to do about this?”  Tony asked, aloud.
-!”  Tony swore, squeezing his eyes shut momentarily.
“Come back here- -you’re wet- -share-…”  Tony let go of Steve’s dick and took hold of his wrist, fingers sliding without traction against the blonde’s skin, pulling him -down-, until they were aligned again, slick and hard, and powerful in a way that wouldn’t wait, and didn’t have to.
“What are friends for?”  Warbird smiled, looking up at the faint line of lights becoming clearer on the horizon.
“Jesus, you scared the shit out of me…”  Tony swore, letting out a breath, “-are you okay?”
"You know Steve, I feel like doing some real violence out there today…"  Tony vented, fishing a pair of boxer shorts out of his top dresser drawer.
“Yes?”
A beautiful dark-blue car in the sun.
“It’s all right,” Tony nodded easily, “-I’m fixing Iron Man’s armor in here, not hiding.  What’s up?”
Peter chose a high, swivel-topped stool from in front of Tony’s workbench, dragged it over, and perched on it.

Tony’s kitchen, 1:04 AM.
Tony kissed him again, more softly this time.  When the kiss ended, Steve ran a forefinger across the carefully trimmed line of Tony’s mustache.  Tony wiggled it like Samantha on ‘Bewitched’, and grinned.  Steve missed the cultural reference by a mile, but grinned back anyway.

“I’m placing you on an indefinite leave of absence,” he decided, “-you did disobey my orders several times, and Stark Industries should thank their lucky stars I don’t dismiss you publicly.  However…”  Steve shot War Machine a tight smile, and reached up to put his hand on the back of a thick steel shoulder-plate,  “-between you and me, you’re welcome to come back here any time, Avenger.”

Higher until he had to yawn to pop his ears for the third time, and the flying saucer was barely a silver speck in his field of vision.  He was losing speed fast now, until finally…
“Why because he’s a

The Warehouse District, NYC, 9:31 AM (same day).
“Just seeing if you were still awake,” Tony shrugged, unapologetically.
“You mind if I-” Steve began, indicating his bike.
Iron Man qualified.
Three seconds after Steve let him breathe, he had it.
Steve’s loft, 6:28 AM.
At his side, Peter’s aunt May blinked rapidly, and the arm she held linked through Tony’s trembled, just a little.  Tony wasn’t sure what to do about it, so he gave her a reassuring smile that May completely missed, since her eyes were still focused up on the stage.
"Oh, I’m going to bring that up at the
“-While you haven’t actually
Pause.
“I’ll make you breakfast,” Tony offered.
This got an answering cheer of approval, though it was by no means universal.
He put a large plate of toast and a dish of oddly tan-looking (sugar/cinnamon) butter in the center of the table.  Tony took a piece of toast for himself, and held it in his mouth by one corner while he went back for plates.
How many of these faces would close, if they knew the number he’d learned earlier?
Harry was in his pajamas and bathrobe, and judging from the ungelled wavy chaos of his hair he must have showered at least a few hours ago…
The Iron Horse Garage, 10:20 AM (same day).
One of Peter’s shorted-out spider-tracers was sitting like a leftover Halloween toy beside a glass jar of hoverboard screws.  Tony picked the small transmitter up, and smirked.  He set it at the center of the page he was working on, right over the oval, then doodled curved lines in between the radial lines, making the useless brainstorming exercise look like a spider web.
Tony left.
Tony came in looking tense and annoyed, and closed the door behind him.  Then he searched the entire room as if checking for cockroaches.
There was a ‘Heathcliff Metals’ that sent in checks of varying size and lists of
War Machine was good.
Steve slid the shield down to the level of Tony’s elbows, effectively trapping him.
Harry lay in the trimly made bed between them, looking pale and unconscious.
“…Piece a’shit…” he muttered.
Tony touched a pencil eraser to his lips, and frowned at the precise lines and notation he’d just added in his drafting notebook.
Tony’s eyes flicked to Steve’s face with intense curiosity, then closed.  He knelt in the indicated spot, and waited.  Steve had his shield in hand now, Tony could hear it the by the soft squeak of the brown leather arm-straps.
The door at the top of the stairs led into a long hallway with two far-spaced doors on the opposite side, perhaps offices.  Steve took a key out of a small pocket hidden along his waistband, and opened the nearer one.
“-Were you testing my senses just now?”  Steve asked.
Peter was standing on one foot beside an angrily wobbling blue barrel, and pulling thickly-wrapped strands of sticky webbing off his right foot with annoyance.
“Okay, going now…”  Peter agreed, retreating.
“My-” Tony caught himself, “-yeah I can do that.  Tony keeps some spare tools and cables in storage there anyway.”
of times, some punk on a flying skateboard…”
Peter pointed to a piece of toast on the top of the pile.
He turned and walked out of the room a little stiffly, closing the door behind him.
The elevator behind War Machine opened with a low chime, and Steve came in.  He was in costume, and the light from the window turned the white star across his chest a deep saffron color.  He stopped in front of the window beside War Machine, then reached up and pushed his cowl down.  Steve looked no less formidable unmasked, and the setting sun added shadows to the strong angles of his face, making him look older.
“You can fix it later,” Whitney promised, and pushed him back down onto the bed.

this shield when they thought they were utterly defeated, and the sight of it kept them fighting…”
“My, what bad breath you have…”  Tony quipped, wrinkling his nose.
Pause.
useful is if you can get a spider-tracer onto him,” Tony explained, “-however…”
Steve got up, found a pair of pajama pants with a pencil-thin pattern of light blue and white stripes, and disappeared into the bathroom.
“How are you feeling?”  MJ demanded, sitting sideways on the edge of the bed, smoothing the pleats of her skirt, and taking his hand.
“Exactly.  Warbird needs to learn some flexibility, and Hawkeye could stand to be taken down a peg or twelve,” Steve said, reasonably.
Tony stood somewhere in between, wearing a beautifully tailored suit that now fit him a little snugly across the shoulders, and watched Peter rejoin his classmates, diploma in hand, and indelible boyish grin firmly on his face.
“Hey… welcome back, kid…”  Ben said kindly, closing his newspaper.
Tony grinned.
Steve frowned at him sidelong, but stepped back from the sinister-looking device.  He examined the way Tony’s armor was piled inside the jukebox.  …Then he smiled, and began taking it out again.  The armor hadn’t fit quite right in the lower compartment because the helmet, which normally had the smaller top compartment to itself, had been crammed in at the back of the lower one.
“Hey, you still there?”  He began again.
If he could find his courage now, and-
He didn’t have the patience for this, and his right shoulder was starting to really hurt.
- -anyway, War Machine went up into the steelwork of the Williamsburg Bridge to watch the Racer, who was flying around East River Park and under the base of the bridge, And I was watching both of them, also on the bridge.”

“You said you had a new song for me?”  Steve asked, coming downstairs in a sky-blue T-shirt and jeans.

looked a lot darker and choppier.
Tony woke up with a start, and lashed out with his right hand straight up, palm upwards.
The Warehouse District, NYC, 9:02 AM.
Oh, god.
Jarvis smiled in a way that made Peter suddenly want to ask the older man for a glass of milk.  He contained the urge, and shook Jarvis’s hand.
“Why outside?”  Peter asked.
He was a direction, a scent, a heartbeat.
The backs of creamy-soft thighs with a tan that might be either natural or studiously nude beach…
“Sinatra, right?”  Tony called over.
“Why didn’t you answer your radio when I called earlier?”  Steve asked.
“Oh-” Peter blinked and looked up, “-he’s good.  He came home last night with his arm slung.”
“Payment has nothing to do with it,” he said aloud, “-the armor is mine, period.  The only reason War Machine exists at all is because Morgan didn’t respect that.”
It was a tragedy, and a waste, and a corruption of-
Somebody- -and he would find out who- -had tried to kill his team.
Peter heard water running in the bathroom, though there was no sign of breakfast yet.  One of life’s small, passing miseries.  He caught sight of Tony’s cluttered worktable in the far corner, and gravitated there to examine the black and silver components of Harry’s disassembled hoverboard.
“Your physical symptoms do not match those I have on file from previous panic attacks, ma’am. I believe you are experiencing what is known in medical circles as
Toni stands at the window, leaning against the wall with her arms folded, and stares out over the city. It’s cold and drizzly, and very far below, a sea of open umbrellas swims along the sidewalk. By all appearances, an utterly shitty day. But Toni doesn’t care, because this is the day that she gets to go home at a reasonable time, eat food that isn’t takeout strewn around a mountain of paperwork, actually remember she has a boyfriend that isn’t named “Pepper”.
It would be easier with touch, he knows that from his interactions with Charles Xavier, but not even the theoretical lure of the last cup of coffee on earth could make him walk into that room and find an excuse to put his hand on Steve now.
She’s rusty, because it’s been weeks since she’s done anything but punch a bag until her hands are bleeding, but she’s got years of training to rely on. It only takes a few circles around Steve before she’s got herself completely in control, and she sees an opening. She’s pretty sure Steve’s handing it to her on a silver platter, but she’ll take it.
He doesn’t even get a full step away before Toni’s hand snaps around his wrist. He stops dead, half turns quizzically back towards her. “Let me be clearer,” she says gently. Incredibly, her hand is soothing up his back, like it does when he’s in the middle of a panic attack or a flashback and she’s trying to anchor him. “I need you to take me to bed, because I can’t fucking think straight.”
They slam through the far wall, exploding past layers of concrete and aluminum, and spill into a cavernous underground chamber, half in shadow.
to do around here."
“Good to know,” she says, and throws her arms out, palms down. “Do me a favor while I’m out, J. Go ahead and copy all of Bucky’s permissions, and overwrite them on Steve’s access. Skynet it.”
Tony puts a hand on the wall, leaning heavily on it as he clutches his chest and reins in his hyperventilation before his head starts swimming. “Hey Cap,” he says, breathless and voice twitching with the kind of laughter that comes in the sagging relief of not being killed after a really good scare. “Been taking lessons on how to scare the bejesus out of old friends from Widow while I’ve been unconscious? Cos damn, you’re pretty good at it.”
she yells, her face scrunched in fury and her hands on her hips.
Her turn to hesitate, suspicion flaring hot and squinty-eyed in her chest. “JARVIS,” she says slowly, “if you cracked my seals to punish me with that godawful smell because I didn’t listen to you and test the stealth tech in the lab before I took it into the field, I swear to Turing I will break your code into itty bitty pieces and use you as the StarkPhone’s answer to Siri.”
Toni flicks her fingers again, and the picture jumps. Steve’s standing on Iron Maiden, the chest peeled and torn away in chunks, the shield raised again Toni, barely visible under the broken armor, one wide blue eye shocked and terrified. Tiny hesitation, then another flick. Toni, bleeding and dazed, crouching in front of him. Hope warring with despair, head tilted towards him. Steve, in the middle of shaking his head, still angry, still murderous.
She swallows hard, pushes through the red haze hovering over her thoughts. It’s harder than it should be. “J, define soulbond psychosis for me.”
Turns to catch the precision swing of another black-clad intruder, trying to clothesline him. Kicks out at a third while he still has a hand around the wrist of the second, drives the third across the room to crash into the dumbbells. Spins tightly on his heel, whipcracking the second intruder into the heavy bag, spin-kicks them so hard when they stagger back that they flip in the air before piling onto the floor.
No great secret to anyone that she's the love of his life, but only if he had to label it. He doesn't usually bother trying to define it, because whoever he's trying to explain it to is just going to spin it their own way anyway. Like Bucky, who still thinks he's just jealous because his presence means Clint doesn't share her bed right now, but it's not about that. It's never
When his vision clears, he’s crouching on the floor and the armor is in pieces around him. There’s no sight of a human body, no blood to suggest there was a person who might have gotten away.
She’s silent for a moment, and that moment lasts forever with the endless stabbing in his shoulder. Then, she settles in the stool beside the chair, takes his hand and rubs her thumb along the back of it. “I was seven when my soulmarks manifested,” she says. “I didn’t know who they were supposed to be, but Mama did. I’m almost positive she did. She said, ‘don’t even tell your father,
“Miss Potts expressed her desire that you be given space while in the Cradle, ma’am. She was quite intimidating. Per your standing directives, whenever someone successfully frightens Natasha, I have archived a recording of the event for you to watch at your convenience. They have instead gathered in the den to celebrate your felicitous return from injury.”
“Of course, ma’am.”
“I try not to dignify rich old farts with my attention, Trish, but you asked nicely, so just for you, yeah?” She makes a show of clearing her throat, until Pepper is hissing at her to get on with it. “I just have to say that it’s okay if you’re jealous that a hot, young, multiple-doctorate female CEO with, if I can be conceited here for
when he wakes up.
“You lose,” she hisses.
with her thighs that brings her groin against his, at the same time she leans forward to nip his ear. And
“And we all know what happened the last time you relied on threat assessments, don't we?”
The pencil breaks against the door as it closes behind Clint, and Steve stares glumly at the broken pieces, scratching off another one on the tally in his head, listening to Clint’s mocking laugh fade away down the hall.
He drops to the floor with his nose spurting blood, moaning, until she shuts him up with a heel to the temple. She stands over him for another moment, catching her breath and trying to keep the adrenaline rush from shaking her apart. “J, what's going on?"
“Love you too,” Toni mumbles, and lets Natasha lead her into the room. Natasha looks over her shoulder at Bucky in the most open expression he’s seen to date, one that manages to convey gratitude and pride and approval and affection, apparently all for him, in a single upturned smile. It floors him just a little.
“You’re fuckin’ him.”
fucking industry I have the whim to dabble in within a week! You don’t get to tell me what’s not possible! Get this through your
Tony’s heart aches to see the sparkle dim. “But the internet is forever, huh?” That’s a feeling he knows all too well.
“Toni,” Steve says, strange and strangled, his hands close mechanically on her shoulders, pushing her back, trying to spin her. “Turn around.”
“Hard to tell sometimes,” Clint says, and ducks away from another swat. “Jesus, woman. Touchy.”
He breezes past her, pushing the rabbit into her arms and heading for the living room where, if he remembers correctly, there are floor to ceiling windows. He wants open air to be a pane of glass away if Carol decides she's still angry.
“Go fuck yourself,” she says calmly, “and sit the fuck down so I can get your arm on.”
He keeps cover behind the shield, deflecting the ray blasts away from him, and is taken completely by surprise when the armor shoots forward, flying down the hall to snag him around the chest and drive him back. The moment the armor touches him, Steve absolutely loses his head in a haze of red and fury, and goes away for a moment or two.
Nidavellir was cold and quiet.
Toni nods, gesturing at her to continue.
“I am not psychotic, Sharon. I am unbelievably
“Yeah.” Carol is smiling. “She is. And it’s really nice to hear you admit it. Is that the first time you said it out loud?”
“We gotta go back tomorrow,” Bucky says, dropping an arm over Toni’s shoulders as he joins her at the window overlooking the glittering blue of the Pacific. She turns a brief grin up to him, shifting her coffee cup between her hands and sliding an arm to snug around his waist. Something deep and primal settles into his chest at the light touch of her hair as she rests her head against him, and for a moment, he has to fight with himself to not weep as it swells and rolls around his rib cage.
birthday.
Tony’s vision goes spotty and his chest seizes so hard that he briefly worries about arc reactor failure, before he realizes he’s stopped breathing. He gulps in air and types,
Despite all of JARVIS’s mother-henning and disapproving silences, Toni thinks her new stealth tech’s test is going well. So far, the suit isn’t showing up on radar or sonar, radio doesn’t seem to be picking up any frequencies, and even naked-eye observation has to be particularly sharp in order to spot the shimmer giving away her outline. All in all, she’s quite satisfied with how it’s holding up.
“Do you have anything to say to Mr. Trump?”
She neither wants nor needs a SHIELD liaison reporting directly to her, but even if she did, she'd want literally anyone else. Anyone else who hasn't labeled her a textbook narcissist, a compulsive personality, and a self-destructive asshole. Anyone else who hasn't infiltrated her company to spy on her, to try and control her technology on behalf of SHIELD, to keep her effectively out of whatever pop group one-hit wonder Fury had been putting together.
fucking fine. God help Rhodey, is all she can say.
She attends two of Coulson’s meetings, but doesn’t have the presence of mind to remember a word that’s said. She has the impression those meetings were a whole lot of nothing to say, though, because if something important had been talked about, she’s positive she would have remembered it.
sleep, or we’ll have words. Nod if you understand me.”
until he wants to reach into his skin and claw them out. Only iron discipline keeps him from doing so much as twitching.
“This is way bigger than I thought it would be,” Tony says, eyes roaming worriedly over the flickering, holo-blue images displayed in the air. Timelines, correlations, theories, corroborating events, individuals… It’s a very disturbing picture.
. Do you even know who I am?”
Jemma’s side of the bed is empty, still neatly made. She must still be in the lab, overseeing her nanite experiments. Fitz groans as he throws himself face-down into the center of the mattress and lies there, spread-eagled for a little while.
“Philip Coulson,” she says, with deep emotion, “I may actually cry.” She moves forward to greet them, briefly has a minor panic about how disastrous she looks, yoga tank and jeans and workboots, dishevelled sex hair from her earlier Rhodus Interruptus she never got around to brushing out, arc reactor glowing in the middle of her scarred chest. Remembers that they’re geniuses too, and geniuses forgive silly things like clothing and personal appearance in the name of science. “Hi there!” she says brightly. “The boss said he had a surprise for me. I guess you two are it.”
“Yeah,” he breathes, after a moment of taking stock. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, tries to get the panic under control. “Yeah, I think so.”
She doesn’t see the blow coming, but she feels it. Her head snaps to the side, cheek stinging. She raises a hand to her cheek, and doesn’t have to fake either the wide, shocked eyes or the tremor in her fingers as she turns to look up at Obadiah. “What the hell, Uncle Obie?” The tinge of fear in her voice, now
he thinks, a last ditch effort as his shirt bids his chest farewell and disappears over Steve’s shoulder.
She dives for the open doors of the assembly bay, biting the inside of her cheek until it bleeds to keep her focused away from her hand. Recklessly slams on the speed, racking her brain for a plan, an escape route, anything, to save her ass.
The man breaks into a smile. “Excellent,” he says. “I’m impressed with your work. You have managed to salvage the situation Agent Sitwell came perilously close to destroying. I will remember to make mention of that in my report to the Councillor.” A pause. “Is he mission-ready?”
The scary thing is, she means
Natasha shrugs again. “To-may-to, to-mah-to.”
“Show me.”
“Not possible,” she echoes, distant and odd. “Not possible.”
Toni rubs her jaw grumpily, but says nothing about the bruises she’s sure to develop, because Natasha is right. “What happened, anyway? I'm a little fuzzy on…” She trails off as memories surface, then blinks and scrabbles at her shirt until she pulls it clear of her chest.
Toni eyes him suspiciously, and he can practically hear the wheels turning in her head, trying to figure out where he’s going with this. “You’re up to something,” she says, faintly accusatory. “Even if I couldn’t feel you plotting whatever it is you’re plotting, I’ve been with Tash long enough to recognize when an innocent request is hiding some nefarious agenda.”

Enjoy!
Natasha clucks, and her arm goes around Toni’s shoulders to help her, sliding pillows under Toni’s back to prop her up. “тупица,” she says, disapproving.“I have no idea how you’ve managed to survive for over thirty years without someone putting you in a padded room for your own safety. Have you ever gone more than a few days without injuring yourself?”
“She places high value on the bringers of caffeine,” Paula replies, and the corners of her eyes crinkle in amusement. “You should see the disgustingly large salaries the workers in the cafe on Forty-Six receive. Coffee will
The line is picked up on the first ring. “Hi Nat,” he says and sounds perfectly calm and normal.
The world is changing. This is only the beginning. Best get ahead of it, before it’s too late. “Would you ask Agents Barton and Romanoff to join me, please?”
Steve opens his eyes to find himself in the Malibu house, but there’s an odd, dreamy surreal quality to the walls and edges that hurt his eyes to try and focus on. He takes a moment to get his bearings. It’s the den, but different. Different furniture, different television, different arrangement of things. Different books on the shelves. What is he doing here?
She takes another deep breath, slow inhale, holds it for a few seconds, and then lets it out just as slowly. “Yeah,” she says with a wry shrug, and adjusts her feet until she’s in a comfortable, ready-for-anything stance. “We kinda do. Cos we’re going back in a few days, Steve, and you’re going to join the Avengers, and I can’t afford to have a panic attack in the middle of combat because Captain America scares me.”
Stark is sprawled on the floor, bleeding and unconscious and easy pickings, but Steve can’t lift his arm. He can’t move his feet. Can’t look away from the display cases and the photos, the posters and the shining motorcycle behind the glass case. White and blue, stars and stripes, pictures of chorus girls and training camps. Pictures of a scrawny little kid in fatigues, jaw tipped defiantly towards the camera, pictures of that kid and a man with brown hair and wicked eyes, pictures of that kid and an elderly man with sad eyes and a kind smile. Pictures of
“Attaboy, James,” she says. Feels the world rock under her again, grinds her fists into her eyes, tries to remember how to breathe through the clamps around her lungs. “J, am I having a panic attack?”
", the Cossack Lullaby. The lines Natasha sings, according to the translation I used, mean "You'll look like a hero and be a Cossack in your heart/soul. Sleep, my angel, sweetly, calmly. Bayushki bayu." (a basically untranslatable phrase, used to lull children to sleep)
“Power the unibeam,” she croaks, and coughs up something wet and bitter.
“Except minor assets slated for other parties,” the lawyer -- she didn’t even catch his name -- affirms with a nod. “If I may say so, madam, Mr. Stark was quite proud of your accomplishments. He talked about you quite a lot over the last two years, said you were making a name for yourself from the ground up. He respected that, quite a bit. I’m sorry for your loss.”
He pushes open the door and strides in, expecting to find… he’s not sure what he was expecting to find. Toni up to her elbows in an engine, stress-welding, maybe. Floating holographic schematics for Iron Maiden suits, certainly. But not this.
“New York,” he mumbles. “Your bedroom, your house, New York City.”
that ends the video, Clint reaches out and ejects the thumb drive from Carol’s laptop, rattles it in his hand with an expression so neutral and unreadable, it might have been carved from stone.
“She flew in with me last night,” Helen says. “She’s here to keep an eye on you, and make sure you listen to me when I say that this process is going to use up a lot of your body’s resources, so you’re going to have to take it easy for a couple of weeks. Food, rest, all the stuff you really hate the most. Speaking of which, are you hungry? You’re probably feeling the effects already.”
He sits, perhaps a little more abruptly than he meant to, on the top step and swipes a hand slowly down his face. “God,” he says with utter and sincere feeling, props his chin in his hands, elbows on knees, and stares glumly out at the lunarscape. It occurs to him that after all this time, he should be used to waking up somewhere strange with no idea of what happened, because it’s such a regular occurrence in his life, he should start planning his schedule around it.
not the Air Force, so they could look for all the pilots they wanted, but there wouldn’t be a damn thing for them to fly. And I told them that if they didn’t like it, I’d resign my commission right then so there wouldn’t be any further problem for them.”
“Do try, ma’am. I should hate to end up donated to MIT, as you threatened to do in your last update to your will.”
Something within Toni relaxes, unknots. Coulson’s just as cagey as the rest of them, but Toni knows enough about him to know that, when he gives his word, he keeps it. “Pleasantries aside. What’s Fury so hot to say that he sends in one of his best people to confront a potentially-psychotic mad scientist with power armor and a rapidly dwindling moral compass?”
“I understand. You’ve been holding all that for awhile. Go on, соколик. I’ll be in our room when you’re done.”
“Maybe all of that is true,” Natasha replies evenly, and her hard stare doesn't leave Toni's face, “but don't lie to me or yourself. That isn't the reason you packed your bag.”
He gets a hand between them, twists his wrist until it feels like it’s going to break, slides his thumb over her clit. She thrashes and howls into his mouth, moans hard and fast and stuttering through clenched teeth. He pulls back to watch her face as her orgasm takes her and breaks her apart.

“In my defense, I was comatose not long after,” Tony retorts, and sits in what looks to be a comfortable arm chair. It's better than it looks.  “I need this chair, Barton,” he says, running his hands over the plush, overstuffed armrests. “Where'd you get it?”
“I imagine I’ll be very tired in the morning,” Steve says, unflappable. “But it’ll be worth it.”
“You have to be. He's happy, and you're doing much better and you need time together to grow comfortable with each other. I'm only in the way right now.”
She’s pretty sure it’s worse than the smell when she opens the mini-fridge in her workshop, which holds leftover Chinese so old it’s due to gain self-awareness any day now.
Tool, “The Grudge”
Rumlow is still at the edge of the roof, watching the tower through his binocs. “They all just went inside, Captain,” he says. “Whatever party they were having, it’s over now.”
She slaps his hand away, hard enough to hurt even him. Her eyes are chips of ice, cold and hard. “I am Toni Stark,” she says softly, dangerously. “I am Toni
She should be falling over on her feet. She should be too exhausted to think straight. She should be passing out because her body can’t handle anymore. But every blow of the hammer on the red-hot metal sharpens her resolve, invigorates her, hones her rage into a surgical, precision thing.
He pushed Steve’s shoulders back, just far enough for Tony to straddle his legs. Steve shuffled his knees apart, got one arm around Tony’s waist and his other hand under Tony’s ass, and let his eyes slide shut as Tony closed his fists in Steve’s hair.
Steve bit down on the sock in his mouth as the belt came down on his ass, lighter than he wanted but hard enough to still wrench a moan out of him. Kneeling behind him on the bed, Bucky slowly trailed the looped belt down Steve’s spine before giving him another lash, then followed up with a series of quick, sharp slaps with his bare hand.
There’s a moment where he just looks at her, and then nearly smothers her in a crushing hug. “Don’t do that to me again,” he says, muffled in her shoulder. “Scared the shit out of me. I love you, moron.”
She steps forward, leading with a straightforward strike with her left hand. It’s smoother than she has any right to expect, given how long it’s been since her last spar with Clint, but she’s still off-balance and overextended. Steve turns his shoulder backward, and she hits only air. True to his word, though, Steve doesn’t try to touch her as she slides past him, just steps back to give her space. She spins, throws a cross with her right fist, alternates in a few kicks with jabs. It’s insulting that, supersoldier or not, he’s not even really trying to dodge her. Half the time, she swears he doesn’t even move.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Carol says politely, then grins at Bucky, who just stares at her in complete non-comprehension. “We got together over the last few days,” she explains gently, “and figured that this would happen sooner or later. JARVIS has been monitoring the Malibu mansion and keeping us updated. Everything’s taken care of, Bucky. You can just go.”
