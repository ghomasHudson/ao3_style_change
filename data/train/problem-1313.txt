“Actually, this feels like the least insane thing I’ve ever done.” He pauses, tongue jutting out quickly to lick his bottom lip. “You know I wasn’t actually drafted? That I enlisted?”
And Sherlock sees it now, like a glorious silver thread connecting the peaks of his life, everything comforting and trustworthy and
Greg’s eyes fill with tears. John takes an awkward step back, stunned. He stares at the wash of complicated emotion across Greg’s face. At the way Greg isn’t wearing enough layers, and his hair looks like he’s run his hands through it a hundred times, and his eyes look sunken. At the way he’s trying to smile.
He puts on a smile and tries again, hand awkwardly rubbing at the back of his neck. “No seriously, I just surfed there this weekend. I won the competition.”
introduce myself,” John says, looking the frozen kid straight in the eye. “Group Captain John Watson. Great Britain. Paralympic Biathlon. Pleasure to meet you, and best of luck. Same to you both.”
John breathes through his nose and stares into him for a quiet moment, the same way he seemed to stare straight through to Greg’s heart on a unassuming ski lift all those years ago.
Sherlock grins to himself, now. Smirks, more like. That had been the first time they ever did anything with Sherlock trapped between them. The fullness of it, the incapacitating
“Thank god,” John moans into his mouth.
A laugh bubbles up in Sherlock’s chest at the thought and he pulls back to chuckle breathlessly against John’s lips. John cups his cheek in his calloused hand and frowns, a grin spreading across his wet and swollen lips.
“Bullshit you are! You can’t bring me along with you – you can’t . . . you can’t
He takes a step forward, feeling a bit foolish, and he watches as John seems to suddenly remember that Greg is even in the room.
Watson, panting for breath: “Sherlock, Sherlock I’m here. It’s me. Come on, Sherlock. I’m here. I’m here. . .”
“Aw fuck off!” John laughs as he shoves Greg away from him. He tries hard to make sure the smile reaches his eyes as he smoothes his hair back down into its usual swoop. It’s times like these he jarringly remembers that Greg has absolutely no idea that he’s his one and only friend in the world.
And John still misses that voice, even now—the way his accent had been so thick John hardly knew what he was saying half the time, and the way Greg had still spoken to him for hours. Had lain awake with him half the night as they used to kiss, telling him about this, and this, and that. Calling him an odd mishmash of Jean and John and Joan and Gene before John had finally pressed hesitant fingers over Greg’s mouth, giddy throughout his entire body, and whispered, “
not but. It is and.”
He’s already so fucking hard.
, babe,” John says, in what Sherlock immediately knows is a purposefully bad accent.
John grins, eyes soft with nostalgia. “This guy who lived in the trailer next door to me and my mom. I thought he was so ancient growing up, but he must’ve been only fifty. He surfed in Florida in the 20’s. Can’t really remember how it started but he must have taken a liking to me, or maybe my mom asked him to look after me when she was off at work. Anyway he’d keep an eye on me when I was down by the water, and when I was six or so he put me on a board and spent a whole year teaching me how. I don’t even remember his name, actually. Just called him Mr. Cool.”
Sherlock turns his head to capture John’s lips once more, and they both groan as their tongues brush, quiet trembling gasps mixing in with the sound of the steady, crashing waves. Sherlock lets his mind go blissfully still, utterly lost in the feeling of John’s skin against his, the gentle caress of his lips, the careful, reverent traces of his warm fingertips. The visceral, exploding relief.
He half expects John to be offended. Instead John hums like he was expecting the question, then leans back further in his seat to relax.
But then again, maybe by the time you read this, you’ll understand our language, too You’ll hear all I really said.
,” they’ll be saying with a wry laugh as the camera fixates on his face staring down the steep course, his lips silently talking through the turns beneath his bandana. Standing at the top of the desolate world.
John almost screams. The thought slams into his mind with the force of one of Waimea’s waves, knocking the breath from his lungs and clenching every muscle in his stomach.
He wants to lie there and listen forever. Forget about the Olympics. Forget about his prelims and the interviews and the final runs. He wants to breathe in the scent of the two men having whispered sex mere inches from his body, to listen to them quietly gasp and taste. Reaching out and touching soft skin in the dark.
Holmes: “Don’t be ridiculous. You were in the middle of a warzone.” A pause, then: “I was just going to . . . drop by.”
John’s blood turns to ice. He hadn’t even realized it was missing. He shoots out his hand and quickly grabs the bullet casing from Scotty’s long fingers, shoving it down in a zippered pocket in his pants before looking up and giving one brief nod. The metal is still warm from Scotty’s hand. John’s heart is thumping so hard he’s sure Scotty can see it through his thin, dripping undershirt.
“You know the days always used to run together here before. Like one giant, never-ending day with a few customers thrown in or a competition. And then this last month has felt two fucking years long.”
“Sorry, Greg, but I’ve found I’m not in the mood for pleasure-skiing after all. I need to practice. Take me back to Jeongseong.”
Just a friendly reminder that this fic does have a happy ending! I promise!
Next time: Sherlock's back on Oahu, preparing for his upcoming Big Wave surf competition and knowing he'll never see John Watson again. Right?
Hintley starts to snarl and look down at the useless gun in his hands when the stranger leaps from behind him and tackles him to the ground with a grunt, long, slender limbs flying through the air, clothed in gleaming black. He whips around the object in his hand and presses it to the side of Hintley’s forehead.
He fills in the blanks. “You had a War flashback.” No judgement. And best of all, no pity.
Simon, into the radio: “Thank you, Gerold. Thank you.”
in the moment. I wasn’t even trying. My skis just . . .  And now today should feel like any other bloody race. Just go out there and do what I know and it’ll all be over. It’s just one day of my whole life. But it doesn’t—I can’t seem to—”
But James beats him to it, and John curses himself internally.
“You don’t look like a . . . you don’t look like it,” she says.
“Shit,” Sherlock hisses next to him, his voice high and shrill, and then Greg finally sees: someone has fallen.
T’es un battant.  :  You're a fighter.
Interviewer: “And what happened then?”
But John needed Sherlock to be fully awake to hear them, not drifting off in a doze with half a smile on his lips, one hand reaching out to gently cling to the hem of John’s shorts, not even letting go when he finally drifted off to fall asleep.
“You infuriate me,” he says softly, lips set in a harsh line.
He swallows.
“John Watson,” I say. My voice lilts like my daddy’s. I’m no longer a soldier.
Il sait que tu étais là pour sa cérémonie.   :   He knows you were at his ceremony.
“Mr. Holmes was drivin’ into work – you know he still lived outside the city in one of them little towns – when his truck got a flat. He was out fixin’ the tire when the tire blew. The rim of the tire broke off and hit him in the face. Knocked him unconscious on his back. By the time someone come across him out on that old highway he’d drowned in his own blood. Sorry, it’s awful gruesome, sir, but you asked. . .”
. . .
“Actually, yes,” he croons, or tries to, at least. “If you would be ever so kind as to do me a favor. I find myself in a bit of a predicament. Something urgent has come up regarding my training—you know how these things go—and, you see, my coach Gregory Lestrade, his phone appears to be off, and it really is ever so important that I speak with—”
written across the white part along the bottom.
And then John huffs out a breath and moans.
here . . .”
He lifts one hand and waves it around, swinging the crutch through the air. It quietly encompasses the passports, and the skis, and the three different types of prosthetic leg packed in his gear bag, and the folded over packet of papers by the front door. The papers that say, in huge, bold letters, “Class - LW 2 - Above-knee Amputation” in a font three times bigger than the “John H. Watson” printed just above it.
“You look exhausted,” John says.
Sherlock takes his hand back to reach into the bag in his lap and lift out a handful of sunflower seeds. “Did it last night.”
“The usual Time, then, Dr. Watson?”
A gasp rushes through the crowd, saving him from saying anything more. John frantically scans the course to see that the Croatian just skied out on the second to last gate—practically unheard of at this calibre, not once they make it past the tightest hairpin turns up at the top of the slope.
,” Sherlock had said, standing tall, looking wise and brave and afraid. Looking like courage itself. Like strength. “
Sherlock licks his fingers and tries to smooth a piece of Greg’s hair. “Can’t trust you to dress yourself, evidently.” But he grins as Greg dips his head to let Sherlock admire his work. Sherlock gives a nod of approval, “
The Austrian had started a critical turn right at the top of the course one half-second too late. The rest of his run didn’t even matter. He was done.
He pulls back from our kiss and moves to pull off my shirt – the last item of clothing remaining between us – when I freeze. My wet lips feel cold in the still air of the room without his warm skin to cover them. For the first time since I felt his lips crash into mine under the moonlight, I feel exposed.
Sherlock turns around, presumably to eviscerate whoever just said that, but Greg elbows him, stopping himself just in time from squeezing Sherlock’s thigh.
You got your learning and your smarts and your humor. You’re the bright light leading the world into the future, and we’re just the past. It’s as it should be. I’d pick nobody else on this here earth to be leading the planet into the future except you, I’ll have you know.
His throat closes up, and the words catch at the back of his mouth. He’s not even sure what exactly he’s apologizing for. For falling asleep last night before they could do anything, or for keeping his plane ticket, or for stealing Sherlock’s title from him, or for even trying to talk to him in the first place that day out on the waves off Hermosa. Or for all of it at once and then some.
I hope he doesn’t tell you quite all the stories he’s told me. Some of them are too heavy for you to carry. For anyone to carry.
“You look handsome,” John says low.
Greg pulls off his glove with his teeth to respond, his fingers numb and shaky, and not only from the cold.
Sherlock swallows hard and nods.
Fuck everything quaint and positive and wholesome he’d convinced himself of during the break between rounds.
” Greg says sadly, like he’s admitting the gravest sin, and Sherlock doesn’t want to fight anymore. He wants to crawl through the invisible phone wires and draw him into his arms. “
They last precisely thirteen minutes in this way before Greg hears a throat clear just behind him.
Sherlock calmly watches the surfers while the wind off the waves picks up speed, clinging to his shirt and wrapping it around the contours of his chest and stomach. John forces himself to do the same, ignoring the electric space between them and watching the sets, trying and failing to come up with what his own route through the chaos would be. Some of the waves are tall enough to partially block out the sunlight, casting the water in shadow. They crest and break over on top of each other without pause, waves as tall as three-story buildings smashing down into the foam, breaking over hidden rocks and surging against the palm trees tucked into the sides of the craggy rocks on either side of the bay. The sound is deafening. The air is thin. John watches, and tries to breathe, and waits.
A buzzer sounds.
He looks back at the mountain with an odd look of relief on his face. There is a warmth in his eyes, made clearer by the rays of the morning sun.
An athlete from the outside of the pack makes a sudden cut toward the center, trying for the inside line. His skis smack the athlete directly next to John, who bobbles in place, fighting to remain balanced. His single pole flies up in the air, hitting the athlete skiing in sixth position in front of him, and Greg barely has time to process what’s going on when a gasp of horror rises up from the crowd, everyone on their feet, and the race turns into a single, massive blur of lycra and snow.
“John,” Sherlock says, struggling to keep up, trying not to let the panic show in his voice. “They didn’t force me to come in at all. I . . . I offered to—”
“Think he really has the guts to go after the Big Wave record?”
Greg, in French: “Eight fucking years and you still get me mixed up with Gerold. We look
(See the end of the chapter for
It happens every four years. It’s perfectly ordinary. Nothing special.
He takes another long drag of his cigarette and hunches in over himself. He talks to the grass beneath him.
She hums, like I just gave her the answer she was missin’ to her crossword puzzle. “Well I reckon’ his folks would be glad if you wanted to carry out his wishes. ‘Bout the ashes I mean.”
He stills. Dangerously, murderously still. His breath is fire, and his eyes are ice. I watch helplessly as the muscles in his jaw tighten and tense. He wants desperately to yell at me, but he’s holding himself back. A black part of me wishes he would scream in my face.
A creeping sense of fear joins the nerves already thrumming through John’s body. He looks down at the screen Greg is holding out to him. It takes him only a split-second to read.
C’était bizarre   :  It was bizarre
The calm voice breaks him from his trance and he opens his eyes to see Scotty looking up at him, worry in his eyes. John can barely look down over the ledge. He can’t form a reply. Hot embarrassment creeps up the backs of his legs, rooting him firmly in place.
“Gregory,” he hears gasped beside him.
John slips his phone back into his pocket without typing a reply. The fact that

?” Greg says.
John snarls through his nose as he looks back at Sherlock. “Honestly? You want my honest answer to that?” he asks.
“John.”
John stares at him. What are his thoughts on those stats? His thoughts are that he wants to land his fist right in the center of Rick’s perfect, stupid face. And that he feels the stadium draining itself of color, the Olympic flag nothing but grey outlines, the cheers turning to groans. Because put so starkly, John would have to be an idiot to think Sherlock still had a chance at achieving his dream. He would sound pathetic and naive, lying in the face of god, to say he believes Sherlock could still win now.
John clears his throat and nods, looking out the window with a look on his face like he’s going to be sick. Sherlock can tell he doesn’t want to be left alone to his thoughts, so he keeps talking. Talks about the weather conditions, and the currents, the topography underneath the water along the Banzai Pipeline and the way the social scene usually works at this competition (not like he’s ever actually been part of it). He talks until he feels his voice growing hoarse and they’re pulling up twenty minutes later to the outskirts of the beach, the sleepy town already alive and busy for competition day. John gives Sherlock’s thigh one final squeeze before removing it, running his hands over his face and sighing before leaning back to look out at the sky through the open ceiling of the Jeep.
He’s alive.
“I feel like you’re my dad taking me on a surprise trip to Disneyland that mom doesn’t know about,” John quips as he climbs into the passenger seat.
Sherlock lets a curl fall artfully into his eyes, briefly wondering how his homosexuality doesn’t announce itself in a neon sign above his head everywhere he goes.
Then, as we are about to make our way down the slope, he speaks again, so softly even the mic barely picks up his voice.
John slows down and speaks over his shoulder. “That’s just it. We’re not at home. But I survived in a fucking desert in the middle of a war, so I think I can figure out how to make my way back without needing to be rescued. I won’t need to text either of you for help. Just this once.”
It was physics that filled his head and drowned out the sound of the sweating preacher every Sunday morning, where they bowed and knelt and prayed in the sticky, hot, humid air of the Oahu church, his father’s starched formal uniform on one side of him and his father’s new wife’s traditional muumuu on the other. And it was physics on his mind when he tuned out his dad saying grace for fifteen minutes before each meal while his brother snuck early bites off his plate and chewed soft enough that only Scotty noticed. Physics that he thought about late on the night of his fourteenth birthday lying on the bunkbed underneath his brother, after he had asked their father if he could have a surfboard for his gift, and instead he’d gotten a lecture and a new Bible and a necktie.
Sherlock steps out and walks towards me with a warm smile on his face. He pulls me into his arms before I can react and holds me so tight it makes me realize I ain’t been touched or held at all like that in nearly seven months. A breeze rushes across my cheek that feels like it came all the way down from Baker just to say hello.
And the worst part—the part that makes Greg’s bones want to crawl out of his skin—is that Greg
But then, to his surprise, Sonya leans forward, completely out of her professional perch, and looks at him with wide eyes.
if I can’t do the Work!” he grits out.
It’s the mode John went into after Sherlock Holmes pushed him off the side of the mountain. The mode when Greg Lestrade, his hair still brown, put his shaking hand on John’s shoulder when they were alone out in the trees, and he’d whispered, nervously, “
“Facing off against that fucking fairy,” says Dean, as he runs his fingers through his long beard and sneers.

, then
Holmes: “Well nobody asked you to come along. This isn’t even your assigned shift.”
John collapses onto his stomach, not giving a shit that the sheets beneath him are wet. He takes a breath that expands every inch of his lungs, feeling dizzy and tingling and heavy like lead. Then he heaves himself onto his back as Sherlock pushes himself up to kneel over John’s hips, hand desperately pumping his own cock.
Neither of us ever said it out loud, but we weren’t fooling the other one bloody bit with the fact that both of us were desperately hoping for a girl. Desperately. And now we have two! Two little girls. . . .
But it’s also magical. It’s the breathtaking sight of Sherlock sitting in his favorite chair and holding one of our daughters tight to his chest, looking down at her as if she’s a treasure he’s been trying to find every day of his life, the answer to all he was searching for. It’s the way that Sherlock rubs his hand over the still stretched and soft and puffy skin of his belly with a fond little smile, and the way our babies fit perfectly resting against it. It’s the way he looks at me when he calls me their dad, the way he stood up tall and so incredibly proud, like the Sherlock Holmes who took my breath away after that first deduction at Bart’s, the first day we took them out in the pram to the park. The way he lifted his head high and basked in the compliments we got over our perfect little family, and put his arm around me so that everyone would know without a doubt that this was our family together.
The team huddled around the patient receiving CPR on the asphalt – this time the camera pans up to finally reveal their face, now that we know they lived thanks to Watson’s hands. It is the skier from South Africa – one whom we previously saw the team helicopter out after a concussion on the slopes.
“Fuck yes, Holmes, God I’d fuck you –”
Je ne sais pas.   :   I don't know.
“God, take it. Fuck, I’m in you. I’m inside you.
Greg, who has stood exactly where Sherlock is standing countless times, and yet who looks like he’s experiencing it for the very first time. Who looks like his highest life goal was to see his own record be broken. Who looks quiet, and proud, and strong, and the smallest bit somber, and like the very snow Sherlock just skied down is the blood in his veins, his heart.
Watson’s lips twitch: “Uh, fifteen years. Sixteen next w– er, yeah. Fifteen years, on and off, whenever we need to call him.”
“Near first thing I hear you say after five years is about ladies’ hair dye.”
Even now a day later just saying it has me giddy. Oh, Sherlock, though. The way he looked at me when we saw . . . I’ll admit the first ultrasound didn’t really do much for either of us – it was so early, more making sure that the baby actually existed and wasn’t some crazy alien, that neither of us felt a connection towards it any more than I feel emotionally connected to this laptop screen. But then yesterday, when the wand glided over Sherlock’s tight growing belly, and a second tiny head appeared, all three of us in the room gasped. Sherlock squeezed my hand until I heard my fingers crunch and looked up at me with tears in his eyes – and it took my breath away when I realized they were happy tears. He called my name, and his voice shook, and I captured the ghost of my name on his lips with my own, mixing together our breaths of joy and relief.
Watson, in voice-over: “You try not to have any sort of gut-feeling when you approach the patient.”
John’s stomach is in knots. Nervous sweat prickles over the back of his neck as the heat times start to be announced. He’s up in thirty minutes. He wants to panic. Wants to swim out into the sea and dive beneath the waves until he finds the bullet casing. Wants to clutch it in his palms and think of how easy it all was just two weeks ago when he was sitting in the sand with Greg and looking out over the familiar Hermosa swells, his only care in the world wondering if anyone down below on that beach knew about the scar on his chest.
“Shit, man, beach is crawling with groms and kooks today. Can barely pick out the competition,” Greg says as he lifts his board above his head to avoid a group of onlookers spread out in the sand.
We wait.
Watson continues to do intense CPR, and the camera slowly pans to the faces of the other paramedics huddled around the patient. There are at least six people, some we’ve never even seen yet before. All of them have a tool in hand to try and get a pulse back in the patient.
“Little love,” he said to me then. His voice was hoarse and deep.
Interviewer: “Ah, so some of the mystery is revealed, now. One more piece of the puzzle of Sherlock Holmes.”
makes Sherlock reach out, brush Greg’s hair back from his face, and kiss his forehead. His cheek.
We cut to Holmes in the hangar and wait for him to snap back at the question. But instead, shockingly, he sits there for a moment, seemingly deep in thought. Slowly, he raises one hand towards the white t-shirt beneath his unzipped uniform top, and he seems to stroke a finger over something hidden beneath the fabric over his chest.
A year ago, I woulda up and panicked, wonderin’ if he finally packed up and left, realizin’ I sure as hell wasn’t worth it – any of it at all.
I kissed his belly, kissed each of his swollen and raw nipples, then I drew him to myself and let his head fall into my lap. “My John, what would I do without you,” he whispered, and then he drifted off to his first real sleep in days.
pops into his head again, loud and clear. Sherlock can see the way forward paved in front of him like that stupid ass yellow brick road in that movie his mom always made him sit down and watch when it showed on television once a year. The thought almost makes him laugh out loud.
John grunts. “And we need to get the top two stairs up to this flat replaced.”
-The second is Carissa Moore, one of my favorite modern surfers. She was the youngest ever World Surf League Women's World Tour champion when she was just 19 in 2011. She went on to win that championship two more times in 2013 and 2015.
Watson, to the beat of his shoveling: “Greg is coming. They will be here. He is coming back.”
“You heard what he did in the bathroom in Laguna, yeah? Fucking sick –“
Greg grimaces. “That’s just it – I . . . well if we had met some other way. If it was a different time, if I hadn’t already been with Molly. I think that . . . I would’ve wanted to try. With you. I think – I
” had been swallowed up by the beautiful sound of Sherlock sighing, “
He hears a chuckle from the bed, but can’t tell from who.
Watson, again and under his breath: “Greg is coming.”
It had been like a bucket of ice water being splashed into John’s face. He’d stepped back, instantly losing himself in the crowd, and watched as the scene carried on as if that odd, limping third man had never been there next to Holmes and Lestrade.
Sherlock pants for breath when John slowly guides his cock back out of his mouth, lips and chin and mouth absolutely dripping with John’s cum, the hot taste of him rolling down his throat. John looks down at him, shakes his head slowly, then flings himself down on top of Sherlock’s body, covering him with his weight and pulling him into a kiss, deep and slow. They moan as their tongues brush, trading the tastes of each other. Sherlock clings to John’s back and shoulders, nails digging into his skin, desperate for the weight of him on his skin. Then finally John falls off Sherlock’s body with a sigh and rolls back heavily onto his back. He pants staring up at the ceiling, one arm thrown over his eyes.
trop molle : too soft
Greg hadn’t even noticed.
“I miss mine, too,” Sherlock says quietly beside him.
The second time Greg had woken up, it had been to a bright light shining in his eyes. He’d buried his face in the pillow by Sherlock’s head, and was just about to tell him to turn his bloody phone off so he could sleep, when Greg had realized that Sherlock was scrolling through photos the three had taken on their first ever trip together as the three of them, skiing outside Trento in Italy.
She looks at us both. “About a minute,” she says. Then she steps back, and my own nurse steps back, and I feel like he and I are the only two people who exist on the face of the earth.
“That’s what every partner is supposed to say. You can’t
; the way the hairs on Greg’s bare forearms had surrounded him with fuzzy warmth, like being enfolded into a field of summer grass in the middle of a dark, freezing Pyeongchang winter night. Like having the bones of his body rearranged to be back at home, re-set, powered off and then powered back on again. Softened.
John could have shot him straight in the chest and it would have felt less debilitating. Sherlock steps even closer, trying to shield them both with his body alone, block out every stare and voice and errant camera lens. “I . . . I’m sorry. I should have called. It was unforgivable. I was . . . I was nervous.”
“Cor, sorry. Was so caught up watching. John.”
“Won’t be that bad,” he says, tone light. “I had to watch you surf the Pipeline. You even wiped out to give me a nice flashback. Test my nerves.”
“Couldn’t get away from them fast enough,” John whispers, eyes still closed. “Thought they’d never let me leave.”
His mobile certainly believes he is a Gold medalist. Ever since sitting down for that interview with Sherlock, he’s received no less than twenty interview offers, three sponsorships from Paralympic gear companies, a request for a photo spread in an amputee magazine, and pleas from practically every LGBT media organization in Europe for another Sherlock Holmes and John Watson insider exclusive.
Cut to Greg back at the base, leaning hard against the side of one of the helicopters. His short brown hair is drenched with sweat, and he rubs once over his face with his palms. We have never seen him so un-composed. We have zero clues, from the look on his face, what was the outcome of the mission.
to reach you, and when that didn’t work we thought you were maybe feeling physically off after your race, hence the over-long period in the shower. So we kept waiting thinking you were just about to step out, and then when you did and we realized you were actually with
He can smell sweat.
“I’m sure you’re not alone in that sentiment.” Sherlock swings his arms once behind his back before continuing. “And besides, you’re a soldier. You’re supposed to fight.”
, and not just as the pregnant freak, I need to do this right. He has placed his entire image in my hands, and I don’t take that lightly.
Patrick: “And Watson? He. . . oh, he would hate me for saying this, but you need someone to chit chat with the loved ones? To handle their fear? He is the best. He just . . . he puts people at ease.”
Then John turns his head in just the right direction, and his eyes lock in on Sherlock standing alone and aloof in his aviators, a statue at the edge of the chaos, and even from this far away Sherlock can see every bit of tension leave his body. Sherlock’s insides feel like lava. He nods his head once just enough for John to see, and he sees John do the same. An emotion hits Sherlock so strongly in the chest he nearly buckles over at the sheer force of it.
I shake my head and spring into action. Flex my hands as I creep silently up the sagging wood staircase, dodging spiderwebs hanging from the ceiling in the moonlight and pressing my body back against the peeling, moldy wall. For the first time all night I wish I was wearing dark colors again. Easier to fade away and sneak up on this Hintley so that the stranger can somehow capture a murderer who got away with it in the World.
She looks out the window and I glance up at the side of her face. The clench of her jaw reminds me of what Sherlock’s face looked like after he whispered that he misses me into the fragile silence. I want to cup her cheek with my palm and smooth it away. Instead I stand up and go to the cabinet where I keep a half-full bottle of whiskey. It was full when I bought it a week ago. I pour out two splashes into little teacups and pass one to Alma Jr.
He smiles into John’s hair. The house doesn’t seem quite so large or silent anymore. “I’m not sure what the hell I did to deserve you.”
Her brown eyes sparkle as I grip the cane, and I nod at her that she can move away before I try to stand. I don’t need her staring at me struggle. Not now. Not with the dull ache of a bullet graze panging hot on my forehead. Not with the warm ghost of his lips against my own. Almost touching. Almost.
John licks one last time into Sherlock’s mouth, tasting the salt on his lips and sighing out through his nose before pulling back for air, fingers still clutching at a handful of curls. He wants to say something elegant. Something that could somehow convey even one tiny portion of how he feels in this moment where he’s a man who’s kissing a shirtless Sherlock Holmes on a goddamn Hawaiian beach. Instead all he can say is “fuck.”
“The bullet must have grazed me,” I say. “I didn’t even feel it.”
The man grins, holding his hand out, which John shakes.
Next time: What really happened to John in Vietnam?
He lifts his head and looks at me with bleary eyes, blue stars slowly coming back into focus on my face. “I’ve never had any sex up until now,” he says low.
He glimpses the outline of John’s metal knee through his snow pants and feels that horrifying, shameful twist of
Opening Ceremony, but then he remembers what happened the last time he brought up anything related to the Paralympics. He also remembers the harrowing look on John’s face when Greg had asked him on the plane in a whisper if he knew anyone to walk with in his Parade of Nations, and John had simply looked out the window, one hand over his mouth and the other rubbing across his metal knee, and he’d said under his breath, “
Listen to "Your Eyes" by Bombay Bicycle Club
John rolls his eyes when he does, in fact, minorly shift his gaze to the right and finally catches sight of Greg, who’s standing waving his hands in the air from the front row of the grandstands two sections down.

in his stomach at the thought of just . . . walking away without so much as a hug. But the tide of journalists and athletes around him is almost physically pulling him toward the locker room, away from the stands.
It’s all just a little bit ironic. Because here he is staring at the surface of the water and stripping bare her secrets and forces hidden beneath, scoffing at the other surfers who only ever bother to notice the height of the waves. And apparently he’d forgotten all this damn time to apply the same logic to himself. And John Watson had taken one look at him barreling across the sand with his head held high and seen straight down to the seafloor of his soul. And John had taken shelter there, and kissed it gently with his soft, salty lips, and then calmly stepped onto a plane with a bullet-free pocket and a championship title to his name.
He closes his eyes, his face burning hot from something like rage. He thinks of John: John apparently, if this lackey is to be believed, sitting alone in his depressing room for the last 2 days, waiting for phone calls that haven’t come, religiously avoiding contacting Sherlock out of misguided concern for Sherlock’s stupid Final. The mental image brings a humiliating rush of stinging tears to his eyes, and he blinks them away, furious at his own incompetence that he has apparently gone two whole days without realizing that John Watson’s entire competitive future has been held captive to Sherlock’s refusal to read his emails and surf the web.
The words sear in John’s brain, shooting down his spine and pooling in between his hips. Sherlock grips John’s waist after pressing a wet kiss to his lips and motions for him to turn onto his stomach, which John does with a moan at the back of his throat, anticipation thrumming hotly through his quickly waking muscles.
She runs towards us when I nod, white shoes squeaking on the pristine floor. She shakes my hand with a good strong grip. I like her immensely.
Sherlock looks at me for a moment, his bottom lip trembling. It looks like he’s saying goodbye. Steel walls closing in around his beautiful blue eyes. I feel like I can’t catch my breath – chest panting.
His own sharp disappointment, his sense of insurmountable failure, is a bit unexpected. And what had he been expecting, anyway? Some grand reunion in the snow, Greg sprinting to him with relief, exclaiming for all the world to hear how ecstatic he is that John has shown up to apologize like an adult? A fucking saved seat for him in the stands with his name on a sign and a bouquet of flowers?
” he’d breathed. He’d touched John’s face with his thumb. “
He’s glad he can’t see the stars.
John abruptly halts mid-stride, shoved back by a camera and microphone suddenly appearing in his face for the second time that day. Sonya Westley beams at him, her teeth brighter than the snow.
John huffs out a bitter laugh, hands floating wildly up into the air at his sides. “I can’t just stay here, Sherlock! I have a job, my apartment, I have a whole fucking life back in Los Angeles. I can’t just leave it all and move here to la-la paradise land with you!”
“I would be ever so grateful,” Sherlock says, stomping on John’s foot as John stifles a laugh behind him, “If you would be so obliged as to let me up into the main building to speak with my coach, five-time Olympic medalist Gregory Lestrade. You see, it is imperative to my training that we—”
“Helen,” Sherlock whispers back. Without thinking about it he moves his knee slowly, letting it briefly press up against John’s for just a breath before pulling it away again. The soft hairs at the top of John’s shin feel like velvet. He expects the moment to feel like the shower all over again – all hot and tense in his muscles, nervous sweat prickling sharply at the back of his neck, a blaring internal alarm screaming ‘wrong, don’t, dirty, mistake’. Instead the touch feels calm and warm. The bright, clear waters off Oahu lapping gently at his toes. He hears John exhale a long, slow breath.
Received:
“Tough luck on your draw for the final heat, Johnny,” one of Greg’s friends Kip calls over to him.
John finds a little corner within the crowd and goes to fish out the wax from his bag. The other surfers are more tense today – less talkative as they each sit and stand in their own private bubble, gazing out at the waves and memorizing their every curve and swell until the clock ticks down enough for their own turn at soaring across the water.
Ça va pas?   :   What's happening?
John had lain on the bed on his stomach while Sherlock fetched the cream. And Greg had sat there, tensed on the edge of the mattress, drinking in the sight of John’s strong back, the familiar lines of ink, while also feeling acutely that he shouldn’t be allowed to see. So Greg had taken one last, long look, then asked John if he wanted him to step out for a bit until they were done.
“Sorry, but if I didn’t interrupt that you two would have just had the ‘insult Olympics’ for an hour while me and Scotty stood here waiting,” she says. “To answer your question, he called us a week ago and somehow pulled plane tickets out of the air, and Greg had some vacation days left and I skipped some class and here we are.”
bonne nuit : goodnight
Nurse Hooper clears her throat. She looks very brave. “How much do you know already?” she asks.
John digs deep and pops up in one clean motion to catch his last wave of the morning, legs shaking under the rushing force of the water beneath him. It’s not a pipeline, just a rushing face with plenty of spray flying off the top, exactly like Scotty predicted. John squats his legs like Scotty showed him earlier and pumps down the face of the wave, shooting towards the very bottom before twisting his core and rocketing up to the crest, shooting off a wall of spray and whooping at the top of his lungs at the sheer speed beneath his board. When he finally falls back into the whitewater and surfaces to gulp down air, he half-expects to hear “far out, old man!” echo across the waves in Greg’s familiar, even voice.
I've got a little "Gimme Shelter" ficlet in the works, and will hopefully move on to a new project (probably another AU) soon! Thanks for allowing me to play around with our beloved Holmes and Watson. I promise all comments will eventually be replied to!
Sherlock swallows hard. His voice sounds tiny. “I’m sorry.”
The air prickles around John’s skin. His body prepares to flee, prepares to tense up hot and defend and deny and refute. But then John hears himself say softly, “I know.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “No thank you. I’ll find it perfectly well once we’re back on the ground.”
Slow motion footage of Holmes and Watson sitting in the back of the helicopter. For a split-second, blink and you miss it, their shoulders touch.
Holmes, striding away already: “Because I always know.”
I press my lips gently into his thumb, letting the tip of my tongue flicker out to wet the pad. He shivers up his neck. Sucks in a breath. There’s a question hovering in his eyes. One that looks a lot like “you really want this? You really want me like this?”
I stand there like I know what he means. Like I know what the fuck’s going on. My toes are thrumming.
, it isn’t possible—”
I nod, move on clumsy feet over to the little silver fridge.
John swallows a moan. “Your hands . . . holding onto your skis . . .”
John giggles with his eyes closed, still leaning back against Greg’s chest with Sherlock’s hand grasped in his own, and
He was larger than life, your granddaddy was. Too thin in his old checkered shirt (it was his brother’s. You’ll be glad to know I figured that out before I ever even knew his name), and still wearing his old army boots on his feet, and he’d shaved that morning in the rearview mirror of his truck. It was an old green Ford with half the paint peeled off. I’ll never forget it. Wish we had a Polaroid or something to show you, but that truck’s long gone. Most everything from those days is gone, except two pairs of worn shirts.
. Not far off lost in their head thinking about course times and angles and gates.
“Six-thirty tomorrow morning? Hermosa?” John asks as he rubs the back of his neck with his other hand.
This morning was bad. I woke up from a fitful sleep to the sound of Sherlock groaning next to me, clutching at the sides of his belly and grunting out my name. I’ve never pushed a speed dial button faster in my life, told the midwives to get here (well, actually I don’t remember saying anything at all but I must have made sense because they showed up on our doorstep thirty minutes later). Sherlock was kneeling on the floor with a pillow under his knees with me in front of him, resting the weight of his belly on a pile of blankets and burying his face in my neck, with his fingers clasped so tightly around the top of my shirt I could barely breathe. I rubbed his back, kissed his damp hair, ran my warm palm along the dark stretch mark along the front of his belly that I know pains him when it stretches.
“You alright?”
life. Why all he’s done is come out lost, drifting, useless, no longer a skie—
When John forces his eyes back open he sees Sherlock up on his knees, wiping the back of his mouth with his hand. His sweaty skin is glowing from the light pouring in through the window, reflected off the bright surface of the ocean. John opens his mouth to say something. A “fuck yes,” or a “thank you,” or a “that was the most fucking incredible sex I’ve ever had,” but then Sherlock is throwing himself on top of him, lips crashing into his. He makes a surprised sound in the back of his throat as Sherlock kisses him with a fierce desperation, hands clutching at his face and neck, tongue licking into his mouth in long, hot pants, filling John’s mouth with the taste of himself until he can barely breathe.
John finishes getting ready to the comforting sounds of Greg and Sherlock bickering in French in the kitchen—something about how Sherlock thinks Greg’s clothes don’t match, and how Greg’s picked all the wrong sorts of tea to offer their guest, and how Sherlock is going to be locked outside like a stray cat if he doesn’t behave. Followed by laughter, and the unmistakable sounds of a kiss that is on the verge of probably ruining both their perfectly-ironed outfits.
I search and I search and I search. I pass the same Cinema playing different films, and the same diners with different menus, and the same clubs playing different music. Lines of people in different clothes. Girls running after taxis with their black boots in their hand instead of glittering heels.
Gerold, sitting in the pilot helicopter seat back at the base, shaking his head: “I would trust Sherlock Holmes to find any patient, in any conditions. I would trust him to lead any mission, make all the right decisions. I would trust him with finding my own life if I were lost out in the mountains. When he is on? When he is focused? You have never seen anything like it in your life. . .”
“And you? Who taught you to surf?”
“You know, you just might have a point there, friend. You’s smarter than you look.”
I huff and look out over the Bighorn mountains beside us. I can’t believe my dumb luck. Out of all the other barely literate, poor as hell ranch hands to get stuck with over this summer, I get stuck with this one – who won’t say his name, and looks at me queer like he’s staring through me. Who reads my mind without my meanin’ to let him and won’t let me open my mouth to say a word back.
Sherlock after all. That maybe it’s someone else, a machine, even, and not the man John has held and kissed. The sense of wrongness pounds through his veins. Over and over, his mind replays the moment Sherlock’s body slammed head-first down the ice, into the orange fence.
He knew it in the dead of night, standing shoulder to shoulder on the starboard deck looking out over the lifeless, glassy sea, necks rubbing raw under starched uniform collars and eyes drooping shut to the steady lull of the ship rocking on the waves.
“Well it’s important to know what waters he’s surfed on before! You can’t just walk out there totally ignorant!”
,” Greg says, his voice monotone.
Sherlock can feel John doing the math in his head. John’s brow is furrowed as he concentrates on the empty road, zooming past palm tree-lined highway with the windows down, letting in swirls of fresh ocean air. Sherlock just hums.
For some reason, John had found himself wincing at the chorus of enthusiastic laughter to Greg’s perfect response.
Now, though, as he follows smoothly in the wake behind Sherlock’s board, watching the curves of his back glisten in the sunlight, and the tattoo writhe across his paddling shoulders, John feels that the water is a kiss over every inch of his skin. It wakes up stiff joints as he paddles through the calm ripples as if he’d been doing it since the day he learned to walk. It caresses his skin and softens it like a dried-up sponge finally plunging into fresh, cool liquid.
it” without saying anything even remotely close to those words.
Holmes’ voice, clearly smirking: “Why, how kind of you to ask, seven whole days later.”
I marry Alma four months later in a little white chapel on the edge of Signal, Wyoming. Alma wears the prettiest little white lace dress with a handful of yellow daisies. Her ma and daddy sit in the second to last row of the church. They’ve never really liked me much, especially now that I went and near got myself blown up on the other side of the world, but I said I’d come back to her and I did, in some form or another, and so they’re here to be the witnesses.
A too-long pause follows, one we have now witnessed in Watson multiple times throughout the course of the series. He takes a long breath and scrunches one side of his mouth, biting the inside of his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
A bullet whizzes past his face with a sharp crack, splintering through the rushing air. The stranger curses. “Shit!” I look back, blood boiling, and see Hintley speeding after us on his own glistening motorbike, one arm raised towards us holding a smoldering, silver gun.
He hums, letting his lips brush just underneath my hair. “Terrified.”
I hadn’t realized, little one. If you blame me for anything, and you have a mighty right to, please understand. I just didn’t know. What we had and what we were. What it all really meant. Even after all those years of what we had going on, I still didn’t fully
Holmes stomps his foot across the room and scoffs, but still carefully takes the cup of tea from Watson’s hands, letting their fingers brush. Watson hands the other cup to the interviewer off-screen, then takes the last one for himself.
He means it as a joke, but John gets a sad look in his eyes and pulls Sherlock close to him, placing his palms back on Sherlock’s chest above his shirt.
On the screen, the next skier is already stepping up to the starting gate, a Swiss flag on his helmet. Course attendants rapidly fix the fallen section of fencing near the fifth gate.
The Village has become markedly emptier and calm in the days since the regular Olympics ended and the Paralympics officially began—with teams leaving in droves, and all but the major news crews packing up, and the visitors staying on for the weather-delayed Alpine Finals taking the opportunity to explore nearby Gangneung on the coast. And yet John’s life still feels like it’s teetering in a fragile, precarious balance. He’d never expected, not in a million years, that he would be preparing for his own race while the fate of Sherlock’s Gold still hung in the balance—his place on the Super-G podium still unknown.
We don’t talk. Don’t need to. Both of us knows the other is seeing colors for the first time since that parking lot out front Aguirre’s trailer, and no words is ever gonna be better than that. Sherlock keeps looking over at me real quick, like he got lost in his head and had to check to make sure I was still there, that he wasn’t dreamin’ it all up out his head in the middle of a lonely walk home after a rodeo.
Sherlock feels his heart start pounding in his chest, even harder than it already is. The feeling of being stripped naked returns, prickling hotly across his skin.
Somehow, that’s even worse than everything Sherlock did combined.
“Shut up, I need to think.”
Scotty seems to realize for the first time that his hand is still on John’s bicep. He snatches it back quickly, fluttering his fingers by his side. John feels his arm twitch at the absence.
And then Sherlock’s lips are on his again, and his mouth pants wet, open, frantic kisses against John’s swollen, sensitive lips, and John’s hips rub and rub and grind down onto the pulsing heat of Sherlock’s cock, thrumming to the pulse of their moaning gasps and grunts. Sherlock’s hand grips him hard, pulling John close against every inch of his body, long fingertips just barely ghosting into the crease of his ass and brushing over John’s hole, and then he’s coming, free and open under the moonlit sky.
I trace the strong lines of his jaw with my eyes. Trail my hand slowly up his side. “Yes.”
Or was it earlier than that? Was it when he was sixteen, days before leaving for Nagano, his belly filled with fluttering nerves, and one of the boys in his junior circuit whispered “
Nobody came running towards Scotty Holmes after he’d first ripped his way across the Banzai Pipeline.
John isn’t even tempted to laugh. He flicks his eyes down at his thigh in silent invitation—
Sherlock swallows, then lifts up his hand in a silent question. “
Greg swallows. “I just . . . I do not want him to think that he must perform a miracle or he’ll let us down.”
John’s mouth falls open in rage, his fists clenching. “What if they
Patrick’s voice: “It is those first few moments when you are in the snow that are the most critical. If you hesitate, if you wait too long to stabilize the patient, to get them back in the helicopter, hypothermia can set in. Even with just a broken bone, it is a race against the clock. You are racing against death.”
I snort into my mug. “Oh, and I’m dumb too ‘cus I can’t figure out my own daughter’s gonna come visit me based on what was in the paper three days ago?”
” for the first time.
To me, I heard a heaving ocean of endless sorrow.
“You’re not hurting me,” John whispers. His words break every last wisp of tension that had still been hanging over them. With a long, shaky sigh Sherlock scoots forward so that John’s body is suddenly cocooned within the V of his thighs, resting along the length of his lean body. John frowns when he realizes he doesn’t even remember Sherlock taking his shirt off. He can feel Sherlock’s heart racing against the muscles of his back, and he suddenly understands in a moment of breathless clarity that Sherlock doesn’t feel stoic about this at all. That the touch of his fingertips on John’s marred skin does not feel like some commonplace occurrence – does not effortlessly flow from his hands like some sort of post-workout stretch with a friend.
“Enough of all this,” Sherlock cuts in. “Lestrade has better things to do than sit around giving you a play-by-play of the last four years. Anyone can google me online and learn the same exact things. Now, ask an
, then
He didn’t know his body could
He breathes in deeply, and I feel myself mimicking him, pathetically eager like a child waiting to be taken on a promised ice cream trip to town.
Hot shame I haven’t felt in a long time fills my lungs. The same shame I used to feel whenever I said, “
The paramedics continue running, and Greg lifts a hand to wave them off from the pilot’s seat.
” the soldier had so effortlessly said, his hand in a salute. Just like his squadron had all saluted him and said, “
And yet . . . he understands.
Sherlock lets his head drop back against the wall and closes his eyes. He drowns in the feeling of John’s mouth dragging firmly along his sensitive skin. The puffs of warm air from John’s mouth spreading through his entire body. Slowly, ever so slowly, Sherlock reaches his other hand down to the low of John’s back and presses, guiding John to roll his hips against him, rocking his hardening penis into the dip just above Sherlock’s thigh. John moans softly into his neck, voice high and broken, as Sherlock’s hand moves lower to the firm muscle of his ass and holds him there, rocking John’s hips into himself in a slow, heated rhythm.
“Well thank god you decided to show up. I almost had to put this one in a corner he was whining so much about why you weren’t here yet to play in the sandbox with him,” she says, pointing her thumb towards Greg and pretending to resist as he wraps her in a hug from the side and tries to press a sloppy kiss to her cheek. John chuckles down at the sand, unsure as to whether his laughter is real or forced.
up towards the heavens.
He blinks twice to all of her questions, and I imagine I can see the fond exasperation on his face. She nods and shakes her head at herself. “I know, I know,” she says. She looks at me. “I know you’re fine.”
My jaw is still hanging open. “You found an old photo of me?” I ask.
“Sherlock, you need to slee—”
Sherlock scrunches his nose, feeling completely unmoored and muffled from the world—like his brain and body are moving ten seconds apart. “Three years and seven months ago we had sex in your appalling bachelor flat and I stayed over,” he says, scrunching his toes against the scratchy carpet just so he can feel something other than reeling confusion. “I’m not wrong.”
And I wonder what in hell we must look like, two grown men clinging to bare skin, as I press my lips to his curls and whisper again, “Alright now, I got you.”
She looks over at me and smiles. “I know, daddy. I know.”
Then there’d been washing the day’s worth of sweat and grime from his body; servicing his equipment to make sure it was in prime condition for the Finals tomorrow; stretching out every muscle so he’d actually be able to walk. Massaging relaxant into his stump on an empty bench, partly hidden away from the rest of the room even though nearly every athlete in there had their own residual limb.
No limp.
It’s amazing how we fall back in step with each other the second we’re side by side on horses, the velvet purple mountains at our backs. It’s like the whole earth went and spun the wrong way to rewind five years and let us live it all again. I can see his chest moving as he breathes underneath his checkered flannel shirt. The horse he’s on startles at near everything, just like all those years ago, and he rides it perfect just like he’s back at the rodeo. Competent, calm as still water, draining the energy from the horse’s legs up into his own body without barely moving his own head. I see the little thrill in his eyes when the horse starts to buck and rear. I know then that I’d’ve sold everything in my house to watch Sherlock win a rodeo. I’ll face the fact that means I’m likely going straight to hell later.
Late that night, in the swanky, discreet hotel suite Greg found for them in Seoul, Sherlock finishes toweling off from his searing hot shower, drops his towel in a wet puddle on the floor, then pauses, his ear to the door.
I whimper. I’m shit out of practice. He leans back to punch and I whack the carpet weight across his arm, hurling it into the void of the room below after impact. He screams. We wrestle with each other on the stairs, muscles straining and hands gripping at skin and hair and clothes like iron fists, tearing at bodies like one of us will simply disappear under a strong enough punch.
“That’s not –”
Sherlock blinks, eyes glistening. “Marry me, John,” he says again.
His eyes were storming blue. Even bluer than they are now. You would be amazed that mother nature could make someone’s eyes so desperately blue.
Greg, nodding: “Anyway, I was there with some friends for a vacation. Thought we would see Japan. And oh, yeah, this thing called the Winter Olympics was happening, we might as well stop by to check it out, you know? I met her in the crowd eight minutes after her final run down the mountain. I had fought my way up to the railing, you know, to the fence, so that I could see the athletes as they walked past. And she walked by, and I called out
He tells himself one last thing before he loses his mind to the steady zen and predictable logic of the broken parts waiting expectantly underneath his fingers. He has his work, and he has his waves, and he has his little place in the world. And John Watson has reduced him to a lost and trembling shell of the man he’s created for the very last goddamn time.
Greg’s voice: “But when we are too late. . . that’s when I wonder. While I’m sitting there waiting for them to load the body into the back of the helicopter, you start to wonder. . .”
Sherlock presses a kiss into the side of John’s cheek. He can’t even believe this is happening. Just thirty minutes ago he was sitting alone on his porch trying to pep talk himself into eating something for the first time in over a day, counting the hours up to infinity to remind himself, prove to himself that once John Watson had desired his company. And now John is here, in his house, with his bags, asking and promising to stay. Letting Sherlock hold him and press their bodies together. Letting Sherlock feel his cock against him with the understanding this is no longer just a fluke.
John can feel his mouth hanging open. “How – what –?”
For a quiet moment, Greg simply reaches down and pulls up the sheet, covering them both. Sherlock wonders if he’s only imagining that there’s a difference in the way Greg’s holding him. That it’s more . . . equal, somehow. That Sherlock has the ability to pull away if he wanted, or to hold Greg back. It’s subtle, and yet it’s vastly different from the usual surrender Sherlock feels in his arms, the complete erasure of his own body and mind in favor of
I walk back into the little kitchen and see him standing there gulping down a glass of water. There’s a full sack lyin’ next to his rifle out against the fence in the yard holding whatever he found for supper.
Watson’s hand reaches out to pat the bag once before they climb in behind it.

“Oi that’s a right joke if I ever heard one!”
He blinks twice.
Sherlock’s throat clenches, and he takes a moment to let his words settle. John waits beside him. Steady and calm.
He looks surprised and shakes his head. “No ma’am.”
that look. Not tonight. Not ever.
John leaps up from the bed as Sherlock laughs, eyes bright. He paces across the room frantically searching for his robe among the heap of clothes thrown onto the floor from the night before, then looks back at Sherlock still casually kneeling on the bed, one hand working out the tangles from his curls while the other one strokes languidly at his soft, wet penis nestled between his muscled thighs. John wants to drop the robe in his hand back onto the floor. Leap back onto the sheets and pull Sherlock down and kiss him senseless until his cock is thick and hot again, pressing into his skin. Wants to taste the laughter on his tongue and kiss the dimples on his cheeks.
He looks up and down the empty beach as I take another step, and I see the fight leave his body as he realizes he’s caught. That it’s no use. No escape. With a long sigh he turns back towards the dark horizon, completely ignoring me at his back.
Sonya doesn’t miss a beat. “Now, your pre-Paralympics stats had you slated around number thirty-two out of the forty competitors here. Tell me, did you come in with the goal to prove us all wrong? Was it that death-defying drive that we’ve all seen from you in the past?”
to feel guilty and resent the whole thing—the rescue and the touch of Greg’s hands, the words he whispered to him in the snow.
My blood runs cold. I can’t breathe.
I think of how some days he’d reach down to me from up on his horse, off to see the sheep, and he’d rustle my hair once over like I was just a kid and say, “tonight, John.” And then he’d not come riding back to me through the pass until near two days had come and gone.
“Well, it’s that or speak to these lovely French IOC guards about why your cock was just out in public thirty seconds ago. I doubt you have enough fluency to fully handle the conversation. You take your pick.”
He flashes back to Scotty calling out his name in desperation outside the showers. He turns slowly, looking just over his shoulder. He raises his eyebrows in a silent
His voice has gotten higher since he had to go off T, getting softer along with the rest of his body, but it’s still gravely enough to be pretty obviously male. The woman took about five full seconds to process what exactly was going on here, during which I thought my heart was going to hammer out of my chest and crawl across the gravel walkway to be hit by a bicyclist. Then a little spark showed in her eyes, and she leaned forward as if we were great friends telling secrets in the clubhouse at Scout camp and whispered, “well, how marvelously progressive of you both. I can’t wait to tell my grandson about this – he only just came out and has been having a hard time of it. He’ll be so uplifted to hear of how the two of you have faced even bigger hurdles and come out the other side.” Then she winked, and placed her hand on Sherlock’s stomach one last time for a quick pat as we both sat there dumbfounded, and continued on her walk, a little prance in her step.
. . .”
“I’m sorry, John.”
Next time: Some brief soft sexy times before the Full Olympic Madness begins. See you then!
“Perhaps I simply enjoy the colors of the French flag more.”
John reaches up for his face. “Come here, you.”
“I’m sure we’ll be seeing you again tomorrow for an invigorating and
Greg, into his headset, speaking to Dom: “I’ll send Robbie to get you and the parents. Should be in twenty – they’re coming from Visp.”
In fact, they’d kicked him out of these nighttime chats about two years ago, back after one particularly fruitful session during peak training season in Chamonix, when Sherlock had taken every tiny pause in the aimless small talk to say, “
Greg and John both give him quietly focused looks as he pulls away. Sherlock never initiates that, never says it first, and the air in the room suddenly feels too thick, too hot. Sherlock fights with himself not to duck his head and blush or squirm.
The silence feels heavy and buzzing. Greg waits, and John forces himself to speak, pushing out choked words.
Sherlock chuckles. “Surprisingly, that fact hasn’t changed since you said it fifteen minutes ago.”
The fact he can’t read John’s intentions in the least is incredibly disturbing. He pushes his leg against John’s, ever so slightly, but realizes too late that he’s only pressed up against the prosthetic, and John can’t feel the motion. John is alone on a couch, facing the scrutiny of the world, and Sherlock can’t even properly stand by his side.
Sherlock’s right ski crosses the finish line to stop the clock. The entire stadium seems to hold its breath. A second passes, and Sherlock slams to a huge stop in front of the stands, a ten-foot wall of snow and ice spraying up into the crowd. His eyes go to the screen.
And now it’s here, flying overhead for no discernible reason at all, her red, white and blue stripes in brilliant contrast to the sleek, black body, casting a shadow across the snow before soaring toward the distant peaks.
A few quick things:
I grin, not feeling in the least like I need to end our embrace. Not feeling any sense of unease creep into the corners of my mind as he holds me. I’m not afraid.
“Why are you so afraid of this?” he finally cries.
Watson hands over the mic and turns to go. The camera lets him.
All those times, it is so shockingly easy for John to forget that he is dating a celebrity. That he’s dating
It took me so long to see this because Sherlock’s hands are almost always on his belly, rubbing or stroking or holding. Part of it is just simple balance, I’m sure. But I guess I thought he was starting to embrace it, to desire to feel the changes in his body under his fingertips and revel in the way his body was stretching and growing to protect our daughters inside.
“But you want to. You told me you know what you want – that’s what you want. To get out of here.”
“Of course it’s not true! Do you think I have a fucking death wish?”
Rick nods enthusiastically. “Now, let’s talk Jeongseon. It’s a fierce course. We’ve already seen a few tumbles and ski-outs during the practice runs. Thoughts on the set-up they have here in Pyeongchang? Does it feel like a good course?”
“I shouldn’t have assumed.”
“There you are,” she says again. “Keep looking at me.”
“Watson, the showers!”
Sherlock’s fingers are running through his hair. John has absolutely no idea how long they’ve been doing that. They run through his hair slowly, gently, and then Sherlock reaches around and wipes his thumb across the wetness on John’s cheek, without hesitation. His long, strong arms surround him, softly pressing him into his body and never, never letting go. For a startlingly fierce moment John wants to escape, to break free from Sherlock’s hold and run out into the ocean and finish what he meant to do years ago. To let himself finally be one with the sea.
Greg gives John a thumbs up.
“Think about that every day. I don’t even know where I’d start. I don’t know what her maiden name was.”
First, you have the World Qualifying Series (QS). This is the 'lower' level. Competitors in QS surfing competitions usually pay to enter and then compete in heats, with 1-3 other surfers in each. Judges score each wave completed in the time limit with points on a scale of 10. Winning a heat means earning more circuit points which improves your ranking, with a goal of eventually earning enough circuit points to make it up into the higher circuit level - the World Championship Tour (CT). The higher ranked QS competition you win, the more circuit points you get.
Black text slowly appears on the screen, overlapping the image line by line:
John relishes the moment for just a minute longer, reaching out to touch Sherlock’s hand with the barest brush, just to feel his warmth. To prove to himself that this is real. That the first time he’d woken up next to someone and not had his first thought be
I nod again, and the power of it fills my lungs with the Baker sky.
John stills. The word settles over his body like a warm shiver, starting at the base of his spine. He’s never been called that before in his life. Never even imagined that he would ever want to hear that word directed towards him from the lips of someone whom he had just fucked in the last twelve hours. And now the desire to get out and walk over to the driver’s side door and kiss Sherlock Holmes is so strong that he nearly chokes trying to get the words out.
“I stare at you far more than I stare at the ceiling,” Greg says under his breath.
“Obviously Chris thought so.”
“I knew you were a genius,” he smirks.
Interviewer: “That’s all very poetic. You’ve given this some thought before?”
“—told him it was offensive but he’s insisting and all, and seeing as how you know we can’t see a damn thing here, and . . . . ah heck, I’m so sorry. Just forget it all, dear.”
I suspect we’re going to have a stressful conversation tomorrow about what to do when it comes to cases. Something – call it my special Sherlock intuition – tells me I’ll have to convince him that it
John frowns, surprised. “I thought you weren’t a fan. Just humoring me.”
He shrinks back from me, but holds his head high. “You already know I’m a ‘drug addict queer who tried to off himself’,” he says icily. “What more could you possibly reveal –”
John barely glances up at the yelled greeting, then looks back down at his feet.
Thank you to P, my translator, who stuck with me for the insanely long duration of this project. You did an enormous amount of work -- especially as Greg got more and more French as this story went on -- and I came to really look forward to our translation trade-off messages.
Greg and Simon climb into the pilot and co-pilot seats as Holmes huffs impatiently from the back. Elsa curls up by his feet.
But they’d never passed him. And when John was about ten minutes away from the Village, huffing with the effort, a chance shuttle had offered him a lift to his dorm. One he normally would have refused out of sheer offended pride, but this time gratefully accepted, fighting not to groan with relief when he sank down onto the plastic seat inside.
“I feel as if I done something wrong,” Sherlock says. His eyes are fixed on the road, one hand clenched in a fist in front of his mouth. It startles me to hear his voice so close next to me – my body thought it would never hear that sound again.
Holmes: “Lower me.”
I hear him breathe out hard through his nose. His shaking hands grip my back even tighter. I feel him whispering into my hair, his voice breathless and hoarse. “I didn’t know, I didn’t realize.”
John closes his eyes and grits his teeth against the sinking pain in his chest. He’s ashamed that it took him this long to figure it out – to see the truth deep inside the man whom he’s been unable to take his eyes off of for weeks.
When John finally does pull back, Sherlock looks incredibly small. Greg wonders how all his bones didn’t just snap into pieces on the mountain, littering the snow. John holds Sherlock’s face in his palms and looks into his eyes for a moment, his jaw shut tight, then he steps away and flutters his fingers into fists, taking a breath before he shucks off his coat and gently lays it on the counter.
And so he straightens his spine, wrapping the thin towel around his waist, and steps back into the locker room. He blinks. He’d expected there to still be an athlete or two quietly getting dressed, stretching sore muscles, their muffled sounds simply lost to the echoing cheers still in his head.
“I know,” he says quickly. His hands are so warm. He suddenly smiles. “That’s because you’re an idiot.”
The poor man continues to flounder, but the rambling, stuttering monologue slowly breaks the tension in the room. Sherlock leans back on the sofa, draping one long arm across Greg’s shoulders. He leans over and whispers something in French into Greg’s ear—John thinks he catches something about gay bars and ‘if only we’d met him there’ and ‘I’d watch you show him a good time’ and ‘could use some loosening up’—to which Greg shushes him with a curse even as he tries not to laugh.
And yet here he is.
thought that he would get to have a life where he sits in the grandstands of an Olympic Final with his love by his side, wearing his coat. Getting ready to watch the man they both kissed last night ski across the stadium screen. And Greg wants to breathe in the sun, and reach for Sherlock’s face, and pull his mouth towards his own, run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls in the light of day, taste his grin—
Walter laughs. “It’s fucking weird hearing you refer to
“John,” Sherlock says, and Greg didn’t realize he’d moved closer along with him, the shoulders of their ski jackets touching. “Be irresponsible for once.”
“I think he’s in pain.” Sherlock whispers.
But it isn’t Greg making sure he’s still alright, or Sherlock telling him he’s an idiot for letting his leg get so cold. It’s an unidentified number—an official Olympics email address, actually.
We think Watson will nod back, then step up into the helicopter, but instead an odd moment of indecision passes over his face.
Sherlock thinks the moment has passed – that they’ll get John’s bags from back outside and talk through what to do. He wonders if John realizes that Waimea is tomorrow. Wonders when John plans to surf next, and whether he’ll need to get a bigger bed, and if John’s hungry or tired or thirsty or wants to go and surf or wants to go and be alone.
He holds the milky tea in his hands, steam still swirling into the air. We briefly follow his line of sight out the large double-window across the room, gazing out over the helipad where a few members of the team can be seen conferring with the mechanics, examining one of the chopper’s blades.
And now, after four long days of staring out his apartment window thinking more than he ever had in his whole damn life, even on the nights he’d kept watch on the ship without Keith by his side to talk to, John finds himself standing on the curb of the Honolulu airport, with a rucksack slung over his shoulder and an address written on a folded up note in his pocket.
He feels his body effortlessly slip into a mode it’s gone into countless times before, but all of them years ago, back in another universe and another life . . .
She whispers gently into the breeze. “Oh, Scotty.”
Sherlock bows his head. “I sure am flesh and blood,” he says back. “Your daddy here sees mighty well to that.”
Then John opened the door to you, and you pulled your young man in by the hand, and by God little one, you looked at him and you said, “I want you to meet my granddaddy. And this here’s my papa.”
He’d opened his mouth, not sure which mortifying form his apology would take, when Greg had merely shaken his head, taken a deep breath staring at the gate, and said, simply, “
“I am hearing none of that. Come on. You can bring your people, too.”
Instead Scotty turns so that they’re face to face, sharing the heat from their dripping chests.
, and Greg’s wavy dark hair looked even softer in person than it did on telly, and his teeth shone in the snow, and his deep brown eyes . . .
Greg groans. “Didn’t you used to fuck around in the desert? On no sleep?”
“Oh no, John, now I have to be the
They told him to take a breath. Take it for a ride or two and enjoy himself. So John Watson stripped down to his fatigue pants and an undershirt, and threw his boots down into the hot sand, and waded out slowly into the waves. One foot in front of the other, sinking into the soft, cool deep. His first time touching ocean water without bullets strapped to his back. Touching the same molecules of water, the same great, breathing sea, that he touched growing up outside his little Long Beach trailer.
“Oh, please, do carry on. I’m not doing anything important at all, and I have full faith that you both can somehow manage to keep your animal grunting to a minimu—”
There was a lot of things I didn’t know, then. A hell of a lot of things. But I knew he was
“I’m sorry,” he says. He gestures back towards the main courtyard. “For that. You were right.” He reaches out with a tentative hand and briefly traces John’s thumb with just the tip of his finger. “John, you know that I . . .” he pauses and bites his lip, then stares at his fingertip hovering near John’s clenched hand. “I’m so glad that you’re here . . . with me. With us.”
But no.
He would pray to Orion:
Sherlock smirks as he revs the engine and pulls back out onto the dirt highway. “Not gonna cry again on me, old man?”
“That exactly why I should have.”
He watches Greg and Sherlock walk off together towards the transport vans, already discussing Sherlock’s practice run schedule in such rapid French that John could never understand it even at half-speed. The two of them keep perfectly in stride shoulder-to-shoulder, Sherlock shining like the sun, his hands flying with excitement and anticipation, with pure
Interviewer: “And was that an option for her? To work here at Air Zermatt?”
She’s looking at me with sad eyes, and I realize she’s thinking the same exact thing. She really is a good nurse, this little pale slip of a woman, floating on her feet like tiny clouds. Even with the pin on her collar.
, you . . .” Greg’s mouth cracks a smile. “You ridiculous
Voice, through a radio: “The dog just alerted. Any sighting?”
“I’m gratified we’re still in agreement on something,” Sherlock says, but it comes out far less witty and cutting than he intended, and he despises the wobble in his own voice.
My nurse takes my hand gently in hers. Pats it once with her palm where we sit out on the balcony, far away in the corner from everyone else. I imagine I can feel the sea breeze on my face. Imagine that I’m not groaning in pain.
He takes a step towards me, trying to place a hand on my shoulder. I flinch. “I know she was a little girl,” he says, hand still hovering in the air above my skin.
He reaches his hand up now, stretching over John’s chest, and gently lowers the iPad screen with two of his fingers. “
“Los Angeles Police Department, Torrance Station, how may I help you?”
Holmes, looking at Watson’s face: “He’s not an easy man to forget.”
I think a lot these days about when and how Sherlock and I first got together. Not in a ‘first meeting’ sense – although I think a lot about that, too. How easy it would have been for me to take a different path through that park and not run into Mike, or how I could have been just a tad too grumpy that day and rubbed Sherlock the wrong way so that he didn’t extend the flatshare invitation. How I could have already ended it all without every knowing what was waiting for me just around the corner.
Harry took the truck after that. He drove me in it to the bus station three years ago in ’62, me all done up in my pressed army greens that matched the Ford’s peeling paint. My dog tags had hung clean and gleaming on my hairless chest, not a scratch on ‘em, and the engraving round my name looked fresh like you could still smell the burning metal from the etching factory. My last unfinished homework assignment from my second year of high school still lay on the kitchen table with the sharpened pencil next to it. I’d been held back twice.
It’s that fullness he can’t name, that threatening emotion which has constantly dangled itself in front of him the last two years like a promise of
For a moment Don is swallowed up by the mist and spray, disappearing behind churning ten-foot high walls of rushing foam. Someone on the shore yells Don’s name, cheering him on. And then, like a ray of sunlight breaking through the clouds, Don reappears, backed by walls of whitewater and flying out towards the shoreline, still standing tall on his board. The crowd lets out a cheer as Don pumps his fist into the air and then dives off his board into the shallows, staying under for the bulk of the wave to roll past before surfacing again to crawl onto his board and get some air.
He ignores sharp ice staining into his knees, and Sherlock swipes his rolling tongue around John’s full erection, licking into his foreskin, stroking his slit, again and again and again, taking him in deep until his nose is pressed into John’s soft hair. He breathes him in, filling his lungs, then he swallows as John gasps curses above him. He bobs to the wet slide and suck of his spit coating John’s prick across his tongue. As John’s thumb traces the edges of Sherlock’s lips where they wrap tight around his cock, aching and stretched wide.
“There is no one better than you. You are the only person on this entire earth I would trust with my skiing. And if it hurts you to help me, I’ll stop. This will be my last Olympics. I would never touch skis again if it brought you pain.
“Yeah, Johnny,” Greg’s saying, grinning. “Make him wait any longer and he’ll start writing pining love letters to you – send them tied to little bird wings flying across the beach.”
Holmes: “Lead mountaineer.”
The announcer will soberly shake his head. “
Then, a voice, thin and raspy from the tiny speaker: “What would I do? God, what would I do. . .”
“You were right,” John says, his shoulders back like he’s about to give orders. “This needed to be done. Everything out in the open. No more secret fears. No more worrying in the middle of all this other madness.” He looks between Greg and Sherlock with fierce pride. “I need you both. I love you. You love each other. You both love me.” Then he laughs. Well, no. More like giggles. “Fuck, I feel better. I feel like I’m twenty again.”
” I’d said. “
He’d forgotten that John had held him close and whispered into his ear,
“To Italy? You claimed you hated the snow there.
He pauses and grins, then turns to the off-screen interviewer beside the camera.
“Shut it. I don’t want to hear it,” he hisses. Johnny takes a step back from him and runs a hand through his hair. He looks out at the crashing waves and breathes slow and deep. Sherlock wishes he knew what he was looking at – what he was really seeing out in the moonlit sea.
Fade to black.
Hank nods and puts up an understanding hand. “Looks like he’s alright,” he calls out. “He’s breathing, just a little stunned. He’s fine.”
“Lahela. My mother.”
“You picked this out yourself!”
John shakes his head. “I’m gonna start making you put a dollar in a fucking jar every time you apologize, and then you can buy me a brand new surfboard. What happened next?”
“I didn’t ‘
He’s certain of that—almost as much as he’s
But instead he only sees Greg, standing at the other end of the courtyard, watching them. And now he understands the hurt in John’s eyes, because they’ve clearly been arguing, voices raised and hands flying, and this is exactly the moment when Greg would normally step in and make everything better, calm everyone down.
Greg lets himself be pulled gently down onto John’s chest, still deliciously warm and aching through his groin, and John’s own flushed erection presses into his stomach and hip. They both pant for breath as John flings up a hand to try and knock the glasses from Sherlock’s nose where he sits beside them on the king size bed. Sherlock ducks the blow by holding his iPad up in front of his face.
Holmes checking Watson’s harness get-up in the back of the helicopter; their silent nod.
John takes a deep breath and licks his lips against the hot sun. He feels like he’s just made a decision, and he doesn’t even know what it is.
Qui ça?   :   Who / What stranger?
This announcement is followed by a long string of exasperated French from Greg out in the kitchen, too quick for John to catch.
John’s awake, dressed, and gazing out his window with a cup of instant coffee in his hand a full thirty minutes before he even needs to skateboard down to the beach to meet Scotty.
“I’m Maxine by the way.”
“You got a kid?” Sherlock looks at me shocked. I can’t believe he didn’t figure it out until now.
than just proving to himself that he is still the same John Watson as the John with two legs. More than proving that his training in California was worth the time, loneliness, and money. More than the surging stands, or making Paralympic history just by skiing standing up, or having something impressive to show for himself beyond simply learning to walk again.
But for a moment, one shining, glorious moment, Johnny had given him that look of wonder that he gave him on the pier, even while his lips had formed the words “you infuriate me.” Their hands had joined. They’d touched each other in the palm for far too long, and Sherlock knew he couldn’t be the only one who’d felt the electric current run through the thick, salty air around them.
Watson shovels twice as fast as them all, but he does not speak.
The last hour before a meal break always drags by like an eternity. John can feel every muscle he used the day before in the competition screaming out at him, exacerbated by getting only a couple hours of sleep after he’d stood staring out the window of his apartment fuming, Scotty Holmes’ choicest phrases repeating through his head on an endless loop.
His brother is going to Berkeley. His brother who always begged Sherlock to finish his homework for him under the covers with a flashlight each night is going to Berkeley to study engineering, making his father beam with pride when he tells the other Lieutenants on the base. And meanwhile Sherlock stands on a beach without even a high school diploma, with a tiny ad in the phone book naming himself as a pseudo-mechanic for cheap and saltwater and grease stains permanently etched into his fingertips.
John feels the moment tingling at the edges, threatening to pulse and thrum the way the air always does when he’s anywhere near Scotty Holmes. He wants to stand in it forever. Feel the air warming in slow, electric tingles up his arms and straight into the center of his chest. But he sees in his minds eye how out of place he must look standing in Scotty’s home in his too-hot shirt and his shoes in the sand. He feels intrusive again, now that he got out what he needed to say. He lets the silence, the flickering pulse, last one more indulgent moment before clearing his throat loudly and stepping back, breaking the air back into a clear, stable calm.
Sam, in German: “Aww, come on. At least I’m not Holmes, driving you mad! Send up a prayer for Robbie – he has to take Holmes with him for the planned avalanche drops near Hornli Hut today. It’s his first day back up in the air.”
means that the Final for Super-G will be moved to—
Gerold: “You’re my co-pilot. I can’t have you –”
In the following beat of silence, as Sherlock’s heart pounds with something very close to irrational desire, Greg slowly lies back down, looking more relaxed than he has all evening.
“Do you think that I, of all people, would waste my breath lying to you?” Sherlock says. “Believe me. I would much rather be speaking with Greg about my own training, or criticizing your choices of breakfast food, or illuminating you both on the fact that I am clearly superior at giving head, but instead I’m telling you this. Now. What could I
out.”
Greg, nodding down at the dog with his hands on his hips: “You are bringing Elsa? You have a good feeling on this?”
“John Watson!” she says.
He hadn’t seen Greg, not even a hint of silver hair in the sun, or a flash of sunglasses, but he’d known instantly that he was there, too, as if the air itself perked up and suddenly smelled of spearmint. Sherlock had never felt so torn in his life—his attention stretched to its limit between watching every hair on John’s precious, beautiful, golden head as he bent to receive his medal, and simultaneously wanting to destroy the podium, smash every camera, chase everyone away until he could find Greg Lestrade left alone somewhere in the grandstands and sink to his knees, beg him for forgiveness, kiss his feet.
This time Rick recovers first, and he laughs like Sherlock’s a little kid who’s just done a mildly impressive and adorable trick. “Well, thank you, Sherlock. Maybe we’ll need to get you on the other side of this couch one day to help us out.”
were being shoved in their faces. But Greg had been both relieved and amazed to see the outpouring of support in its wake. The French youth ski clubs had apparently seen an unprecedented surge of interest, kids clamoring to get in, circulating a petition with thousands of signatures for Rossignol to make rainbow Pride skis with Greg’s name on the bottom. A ski scholarship for fostered teens had been set up in John’s name within twenty-four hours, as well as another for injured veterans who wanted to learn to monoski. Sherlock had received a request to be an official Ambassador and advocate for Narcotics Anonymous, along with literally hundreds of handwritten letters from fellow addicts thanking him for his story.
He was showing our daughters London.
Embarrassingly, John starts to laugh.
“That isn’t the fear that keeps me up at night,” Sherlock says, animated as if he’s excited to say the answer to a trivia question and prove John wrong. “What you’ve just said is categorically true: you enjoy that I keep things interesting, just as I enjoy doing it. No, my fear is that you both find me childish and unteachable and shallow and that one day you’ll be too exhausted to care for me anymore so you’ll kick me out, and then you’ll both become peaceful empty-nesters finally enjoying each other’s company without stress for the first time. You’ll do something romantic like sell all your possessions and travel the world hand-in-hand, and you won’t have to remind me to eat, and you can have sex whenever you like because you both have penises that are functional. And you’ll read a sports blurb about me winning some country club skiing competition for washed-up adults and give an embarrassed laugh over the breakfast table remembering your mutual blip in common sense when you thought it was a good idea to date me just because I kept things
“I’m fine. I’m good. Just needed to catch my breath.”
“Me holding him down?”
John flinches back at the sound of his coworker’s booming, raunchy voice. He snatches his hand away and after a sharp nod turns and jogs back to the work site. His palm tingles by his side, and he fights the urge to wipe it off on his pants. He doesn’t turn around to look until he’s all the way back at the ramp, with his work shirt pulled on and his hard hat and gloves jammed back onto damp, tired skin.
He grips his poles through the thin gloves clinging to his fingers, shivering when the tips scratch across the crunchy surface of the thick ice. The wind is still howling, snarling through the Jeongseon Alpine Centre pass. He can barely make out the outlines of the brimming stands far below through the heavy swaths of fresh fog, hidden by the looming turns of the waiting course. The storm is groaning down at them, threatening to reappear and snatch the course away with its lightning claws, but he’s decided that he’ll be damned if the weather delays him again. He’ll ski through the center of a thundercloud itself if it means finally getting his deserved run. Finally being
“She invitin’ you over for supper this Sunday, then?” he says, readin’ the thoughts on my face as I hold the fragile pink paper in my calloused hands.
With a rush of air John reaches down and strips off his own shirt, then falls into Sherlock’s arms, skin to skin. It feels so much different from the times they’ve touched naked before. Sherlock can’t even believe that someone’s skin could change in texture so drastically. His hands run up the hard, muscled plane of John’s stomach, dipping across the curves of his abs and trailing through the hair leading down from his navel. John shudders underneath his palms, arching into his touch, and Sherlock moves his palms up over John’s chest, pausing to rub softly over his nipples until they peak. John looks down at Sherlock’s hands on his body and groans, closing his eyes.
Alma flinches when I kiss her back at home and tell her I’m goin’ fishing for a couple nights with Scott. She’s always nervy round me like a skittish colt days after I have a black night. I never know how to tell her I can’t help it. That I wish as bad as her that they would just vanish into the clear open sky and float on back to the jungles and leave me be. Alma Jr. begs me to bring her back a big ol’ trout for barbequing when I’m halfway out the screen door, and I don’t have the heart to tell her there ain’t gonna be a single fish caught on this fishing trip.
John hurled himself to his knees and ran towards the shore, vision blacking out except for the tiniest slip of ocean peeking out through the palm trees. His numb legs carried him through the last dense brushes of the jungle, hot and screaming at his back, and the crystal blue water in front of him lapped gently at the soft white sand. The silence was a slap in the face.
Suddenly John needs to say everything. He grabs Sherlock’s hand before he can walk towards the shore and pulls him back into the trees, slamming him up against a trunk. They’re still in full view of the crowds, and John wishes more than anything he’s ever wished for in his life that he could just lean forward and press their lips together one last time. Instead he holds Sherlock at arm’s length and grips his shoulders hard.
Sherlock nods, eyes hesitant. John can tell he’s waiting to see if John will understand why. Why Sherlock felt the need to cut apart the first board he ever caught a wave on, and carved out a piece at the center, and sanded and sanded and sanded it until it became something beautiful. Why Sherlock felt the need to include the barest hint of old spray paint that never fully scrubbed off, which John knows once formed a word painted across Sherlock’s board that still shoots icy fear into his chest.
French:
. That the only person I ever trusted enough to . . . fuck, to – to hold, to tell my name, is the man who gives her too many Christmas presents every year. Call it pathetic or whatever the hell you want, but I’m telling you, I cannot bear the thought of goin’ the rest of my life with her thinkin’ I’m granddaddy’s friend Scott. You are my . . . Christ, you know you are . . . and I’m tellin’ you, I can hardly stand it.”
“Your beard tickles,” Sherlock grumbles into his pillow, halfheartedly shrugging his shoulder under John’s mouth.
“Ah, I’m not so sure, though, my coach is gonna be pissed . . .”
not to leave the beach. To stay there with John as his anchor – as the only thing holding him up from falling down into the dark.
we can work out whatever else comes at us.” He glances at the sinking sun in the sky. “You can still fit in a few more runs, I’d think.”
started crying before John even pushed off for his start because you claimed, and
Some thoughts, notes, and context (Sorry, there's A LOT):
He laughs again. It tumbles out of him, the ridiculous giggle echoing up the tile. If only they could all see him now—stripped down from the armor of his racing suit and metal leg, his sunglasses and skis, the sweat of victory pouring down his chest, his Olympics portrait and his record-breaking time—transformed now into nothing more than an exhausted, drenched, naked, giggling man, hunched over in a shower that’s quickly losing water pressure and smells like chlorine. And out of all of it, the thing simple, plain, ex-RAF pilot John Watson realizes he is most amazed about in this moment, that he finds most
I can feel his smile in my hair. “Done did what I said I would. Been rodeoin’ down cross Texas mostly. Won myself a nice little purse over the years. Got real good at calf ropin’ once I could afford the horse. It’s all just geometry, see. Physics with the rope, calculatin’ the perfect force and angle to throw it, the speed of the calf, the angles it’s turning in the dirt, how hard the wind’s pushing back at you.” He sighs and stays quiet for a long moment. I want to tell him to keep telling me about the rodeo, about the physics and the wind pushing and the calf turnin’ angles in the dirt. I can hear him swallow hard. “Reckon this one up here over in Montana’ll be my last one. Wanna get out while I can still walk straight. This one’s the only rodeo I ever entered’s taken me this far up north. When I saw the route I’d be drivin’ I figured . . .” He shrugs and brushes his lips cross the side of my forehead.
Sherlock’s practically in disguise still sitting beside him with his sunglasses on, the hood of his black ski jacket pulled up over his head, and a muffler covering half his face. Greg is, predictably, wearing hardly any winter clothing at all, and his hair shines like silver fire in the bright sun above.
And beside him he hears whispered words escape from Lahela’s trembling lips, carried away on the salty breeze.
I reach up and hold his warm cheek, amazed that I can. “I did.”
Greg smiles, eyes dark and sad. “More or less, yeah. Was wondering how long it would take you to figure it out.”
-While I took inspiration from a few traditional Hawaiian wedding ceremony details, the ceremony that Chris does for John and Sherlock is mostly just from my own head, and isn’t meant to misrepresent or appropriate any traditional or religious ceremonies. Since Chris is forging his own path by agreeing to do these gay ceremonies (which were very much a thing for gay couples in the 70’s and even earlier), I figured he would have his own unique ceremony to go with it.
“Oh yeah? Says who?” he growls.
He immediately continues searching for Greg. Then, when the attendant is still staring at him, looking somewhat let-down, John curses. “Shit, sorry. I mean, thanks for getting me in here. I was . . . running a bit late.”
He hadn’t meant to say that. He really hadn’t meant to. But now that it’s out and open Sherlock’s chest practically roars for a fight, gunning to let off some of the weight left behind by having to watch John’s fingers graze the naked skin at the base of Greg’s fucking perfect tan neck.
“I wept and wrote you a tear-stained love letter,” Sherlock says.
It was some much needed good news to help temper the bad – which is that, for whatever fucking unlucky reason bestowed on us by fate, Sherlock looks undeniably pregnant now, even so early. From just under his chest all the way down to his pelvic bone is a tight, round curve – one that will get even bigger faster now that we know two babies are in there. I don’t think that aspect of it all hit either of us until late last night, when I lay behind Sherlock on the sofa and wrapped my arm around his middle, trying to soothe and rub the nausea out of his stomach.
“That’s not – seriously, how did you know the hotel? And that I would stay here? We hadn’t even . . . you know. We hadn’t even said I was staying here,” he says.
that John suddenly doubles over, his hands on his knees, and realizes that he can’t breathe. That the freezing oxygen is sucking the breath from his lungs. That he’s going to die.
He lets me hold him after he wipes us off with the nearest piece of clothing from the floor and covers us with the warm duvet. Rests his head on my chest and places his fingertips over my gnarled skin and nudges his warm thigh against the softness in between my legs. Heavy and sated.
Almost.
Voice over the radio, reluctantly: “Copy. Lowering.”
I’m alive.
“Shit, I’m gonna come. Holmes. Fuck –”
John plops down on the side of the bed using his good leg, then leans down to pull up his loose snow pants to his right thigh. “Your phone is two inches from your hand. I’m not getting it for you.”
, just like he’d flown down that mountain for the first time with that then-unknown skier behind him, whooping for John when he finally got the hang of the monoski and soared across the ice, the wind back in his hair. Amazed tears in his eyes.
Then John grabs his bag, turns his back, and walks away through the hall toward the doors, deftly navigating the crowd. Greg’s heart aches when Sherlock’s face immediately falls once John can’t see.
“God, that sounds like a fucking dream.”
“Her favorite thing in the whole entire world was a strawberry flavored milkshake,” he says. “She only got one once a year. We’d go on her birthday to this place down the pier, and she’d always tell me we would split it fifty-fifty but then she’d give me way more than half. Plus all the whipped cream.”
He would let them all out in an endless, choking stream—the deserts John dreams about when he wakes up in tears, or the fact Greg cried after the last time he tried to call his mother—and then everyone would know far too much too quickly, and Greg and John would feel sad just
Then, he jumps, and his hand shoots to his uniform pocket. He pulls out a mobile, swiping open the screen. The camera stays still as Watson reads whatever message has just come through, and a warm smile suddenly glows across his face. He looks quickly over his shoulder, then types out a short message and slips the phone back into his pocket.
It’s his cue. As John curses, Sherlock bursts through the door in his naked glory, striking an impressive pose before leaping onto the bed in a sprawl of limbs, crushing them both.
Sherlock’s wet lips travel across John’s chest, catching on a nipple ring and giving a hard tug with his teeth, before his tongue suddenly snakes its way around Greg’s ear. Shivers erupt across his skin, crackling and bold. Sherlock’s body is shaking from John’s hand tugging at his curls, and his rare erection rolls against John’s hip to the grunting rhythm of Greg’s soft moans.
He shuts his eyes for a moment and takes a deep breath. He looks unbelievably annoyed. Then, suddenly, we hear a buzz, and his hand immediately goes to the pocket of his trousers. It appears he has just received a text. His fingers trace the outline of his mobile through the fabric. Somehow, without even pulling his phone out to read the text, his demeanor starts to relax.
So no, I’d never fade back into the wallpaper, even if I were kept Uncle Scott until the end of time. Not after what I did to granddaddy before we ever got this here ranch. But that’s a different point.
“I get it. I’m selfish and uncaring and horrible and the villain just because I don’t want the Olympics to turn into a giant illogical circus of poor preparation, ruining
Sherlock wants to cup John’s face in his hands and yell down into his eyes that it’s the most remarkable thing that’s ever happened on earth that John Watson is suddenly laughing, making a
” With no hint of irony in her voice that she was still calling him that, even after everything had been burned away and left back in the sand.
Oh God, he’s out. And much more importantly,
Sherlock laughs breathlessly as he practically floats in John’s wake. “Oh,
Her mouth drops open before she can remember to keep it shut, eyes glittering as she tries to think of what to say. As if I don’t realize all these minutiae of her facial expressions. As if I don’t know how to feel.
But still, maybe I’ll get hit in the head with a heavy object and suffer amnesia, or my PTSD will finally catch up with me and erase half of my memories, or I’ll simply become too old to remember it all, and so I want to record here for myself the day that I realized Sherlock Holmes is trans.
Je suis pas seul.  :  I am not alone.
Still, John follows him as they jog towards the nearest one.
“There now, I don’t think they’ll let you see him now unless you were an athlete. He’ll be in the athlete’s medical facility. But look there, he’s walking just fine to the lift. He’ll be—”
“Really, though,” John says, feeling ridiculous even as he says it, “The tragic story would be if I were here alone. Which . . . which I’m not.”
“I’ve kept his room like he had it when he was a boy. I think he liked that. You’s welcome to go up and see,” she says. She looks like she might fall apart any second, crumpled into pieces on the cold wood floor. I nod and thank her.

He licks his lips, tension seeping out of his shoulders. “I know that you lost your daughter, John,” he says to me gently. “I know that you wish she was here.”

Sherlock shrugs again. “I had some lucky guesses about his Olympic romantic  prospects. I then shared them out loud.”
John flushes, but he keeps his head high. “Well, maybe not that, yes. But . . . what I’m saying, all we want to say, is that this is normal. This is alright. We are three people who have found each other, through all the chaos of life.”
Sherlock thinks his cheeks might fall off from smiling. “Greg said it was a bad idea.”
