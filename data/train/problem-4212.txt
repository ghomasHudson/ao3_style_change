She took a deep breath and said, “Dean, we need to talk.” Dean’s heart dropped all the way into his stomach. He knew it. He fucking
“I… don’t know what that means. But uh, I’ll go see what’s back there.” The cashier gives Castiel a wide berth and a wary look as he comes out from behind the register and heads to the back of the store.
They walk for a few more minutes, silent except for Castiel pointing out a couple of prairie chickens in a field, before a pickup truck becomes visible around a bend in the road.
He’s on his second beer and is idly watching a few guys take the results of the old love tester near the door way too seriously when a guy who says his name is Balthazar sidles up and decides to ignore the fact that Dean is resolutely not participating in the night’s event. The guy is relentless and Dean would be annoyed if he wasn’t too busy being totally bewildered. “Balthazar” (no way that’s his real name because who the fuck is named
“Yes?” Castiel leaned over the pot, feeling the steam hit his already red cheeks. “Mildred said you wanted ‘runny eggs.’” Cas held a hand up on either side of his head and made exaggerated air quotes around the last two words before continuing on. “That meant you wanted runny eggs that were
Dean lets out an appreciative snort. “Yeah, she’s a beauty. So uh…” Dean pauses. “Hey are you okay?”
As Castiel stands there and contemplates the complex joys and disappointments of one Dean Winchester, Righteous Man, he’s vaguely aware that a charge is growing in the air. The cashier seems to look a little more awake than he did a few seconds ago, so maybe he’s aware of it too. And of the light in the store somehow getting a bit brighter while the shadows behind Cas get deeper and darker until they almost seem to gain physical substance.
Dean exhaled in frustration. How was he supposed to stop being happy? How was he supposed to not feel overwhelmed by his love for Cas? Cas showed equal frustration, he lifted Deans hand to his lips and lovingly kissed it before letting go with a sigh of regret.
“That was before, Sammy.” Dean explained, “We have a chance here brother, the first chance we’ve ever actually had, to be happy. We’ve done our parts. We’ve paid the blood price more then anyone could have asked. I don’t want to stop completely, I want to start a hunters network like we’ve always talked about. Maybe get safe houses set up, help train the new generation and keep them safe by giving them access to the information here. But I’m done putting my neck on the line, it’s been hacked at one too many times.”
“Anytime, buddy.” Dean said lightly, “I mean, anytime you get hit by a witch with a touch starvation curse.”
“Crowley?!” Sam said, dazed and still squeezing the air out of Cas without thought. “They saved you too?”
He relieved his existence in the time he’d been asleep. He remembered every moment, from the first second god had created him, to the last moment with Dean, in perfect clarity. Those thousands of years before he’d swooped into hell and saved deans soul seemed gray and dark to him. Color and light had only entered his vision when he’d met Dean.
Dean shook his head, bumping it against the table rhythmically. He didn’t even want to think of that, he couldn’t handle it.
“I’ve never deserved Cas.” Dean said, “and I never will, not in a million years. But I’ll take him, as long as he’s dumb enough to stick around.”
“You’ll make it through this, Castiel.” She promised. “You too, Dean. I hate to say this but this is probably the best curse our haloed friend could have been hit with.”
“Forever.” Cas promised. “I’m done, Dean. I’m done laying myself on the alter of self sacrifice and flagellation. So are you, so is Sam. We’ve done enough, we’ve earned our happiness. We’ve earned our rest. We are going to live, Dean. Not just survive anymore, we are going to live our lives. We deserve it.”
As he pulled baby into the underground bunker Dean noticed, not for the first time in their four hour ride home, that Cas was especially quiet. Not that the guy wasn’t almost always quieter then either of the brothers, but he’d barley said a word the entire ride and looked like he was in pain. This worried Dean, Cas was an angel, pain wasn’t something he usually felt unless he was extremely hurt.
“I know.” Cas said sadly, running his fingers through the sleeping angels hair. “I will find out a way to come back though. I have to save him. I have to save all of them from this. We need them, heaven needs them. And they deserve better.”
A new sound invaded his grief, the bunker door opening and sprinting feet. His name being called in fear and desperation by his brother and Jack. The only two creatures on earth he could care about at the moment. He opened his mouth to call back only to scream instead, for his name was followed by Cas’.
“I don’t want the beer, Dean.” Cas half-whispers to Dean, leaning in like he’s sharing state secrets with the guy.
Everyone in the life is odd in one way or another; it’s isolating work that pushes a person to the edge of society, and sometimes over that edge. More than once, Dean’s found himself at a loss when passing for a civilian, not knowing how to answer some simple question about domestic life while trying to pick someone up at a bar. People sure do love to talk about their childhood or the town where they grew up or the part of the country they’re from. Hard to talk about any of those things though when the only home you’ve known for the last 25 years has four wheels, bench seats, and a grenade launcher in the trunk. Good thing he’s got that smile to fall back on.
It’s brisk out here, cold in that unexpected way that deserts can be and that always throws him off. It was hot as fuck out here yesterday, how can it be cold now? Sam probably knows but Dean’s not about to ever ask. He wraps his arms around himself, wishing he’d grabbed his jacket, and hunches over a little, his sore legs adding a slight hobble to his step. He’s not old, doesn’t think of himself that way, but his joints and his stiff muscles have him thinking maybe he ought to reconsider.
hear was the loud clank of the bunker’s vault door closing. He brushes past Sam, readied pistol seemingly conjured out of thin air and into his hand, stalking stiff-legged and tense out of the garage and into the map room. Dean is clearly planning to greet what he thinks is an intruder with at least the barrel of a gun and maybe even a bullet or two if he’s in a giving mood.
“You live here now too and I didn’t want to--- it can be intrusive and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, Dean. Also I was… embarrassed.”
, and no one’s going to make them look too bad. “You look like crap,” one character says to another who absolutely does not look anything close to “like crap.”
They kiss, slow and lazy, not building to anything, no destination in sight because even though they’d both thought they were headed down a different road, exactly where they already are is exactly where they want to be. Eventually, Cas breaks the silence, murmuring something against Dean’s shoulder.
“I raise bees.” Cas answers the question Dean hasn’t asked. “I have a colony of several thousand honey bees in my backyard, which I tend to.” Cas pauses and then continues, like the importance of what he’s about to say is self-explanatory. “I’ve recently gotten a new queen.”
Dean has slid over onto the bench seat, arms crossed over his chest, and he is so close to sleep when he feels Baby jostle slightly. Normally that sort of thing would have him bolt upright and ready to chop something’s head off, but this time he knows it’s fine because Cas is out there. Cracking an eye for the last time that night, Dean sees Cas lean back against the windshield, face pointed to the sky.
They hadn’t expected it, they hadn’t dared to expect their son, who had turned into a deity and the most powerful entity in existence, would turn up to the celebration, but it still hurt that he hadn’t. Sam saw the hurt he felt echoed in his brothers eyes. If there had ever been a reason for a deity to show himself it was for Dean rescuing Cas.
“Then we will.” Cas said simply. “I want to take you to the beach, I want to show you the Grand Canyon, the Great Wall, the northern lights, the rain forest, the pyramids in Egypt. I want you to see every beautiful sight the world has to offer. I want you to experience everything there is to experience. I want you to explore unknown wilds, see cities that have been buried in time, discover wonders never witnessed before. I want all of that and more for you Dean Winchester, and I’m making it my mission to show you these things.”
“For now.” Dean blurted out, shocking himself by immediately bursting into tears again. Cas held him through it, he let Dean sob and scream his way through the worst of it before starting to talk again.
“I’m sure mother thought of this.” Crowley drawled, once more snatching the hexbag from Dean. He rifled through it again, throwing out some components, halving others, crushing other a few and sprinkling it back in. He shook the bag and said some words in sanscript before opening it and pouring it over Cas, Dean and himself.
“I’ll watch over you.” Cas said softly, sitting in his chair near Deans bed. “Sleep, Dean. I’ll be here when you awake.”
Cas almost melted into him at those words. Apparently affectionate words could also be a balm to Cas right now. He kissed the top of Cas’ head for good measure as he scrolled through his “keep watching” list to find Z Nation. The show was ridiculous, but it was supposed to be. It didn’t take itself seriously, which made it seriously hilarious. He’d watched the first season a few weeks back but hadn’t had a chance to see what happened next.
Dean gasped in a ragged breath. No one had said his name in front of Dean since he’d died. An unspoken rule had been formed, let Dean mourn in silence, don’t name his misery aloud.
Sam felt goosebumps running across his entire body at that. God felt as if they where worth placing faith in. He felt tears stinging his eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that day as he let that sink in. That faith had been hard earned and well deserved, Sam realized.
“Dean.” Cas moaned again. Dean didn’t think he’d ever tire of hearing his name being moaned in ecstasy in Cas’ deep gravelly voice. It sent a shockwave of euphoria down his spine and he shivered in sheer arousal. Dean crawled down further on the bed and stared Cas in the eye as he licked his cock slowly from base to tip, swirling his tongue around the top before gliding half the length down his throat.
Charlie walked into the dungeon with a smile on her face. Sam was glad he had her along for this, she too had been a protege of Rowena, even if their relationship ended messily.
The light was getting bigger as they approached, growing from a pinprick to a glowing fissure. It looked like a warped and corrupted version of Jacks portals, with black gooey edging and emitting a sickly pale glow instead of a brilliant orange light.
Chuck felt his determination wavering. He could feel Amara fighting inside him, she’d promised to never hurt Dean and he’d forced her to break that. He felt as if his infinite power had been drained to a single drop, he truly didn’t want to do this anymore. He wanted it to be over, for him, for everyone.
“It’s not.” Dean laughed, “I don’t cuddle, dude. But, if I’m honest here, it’s pretty much the least horrible thing I’ve had to do to break a curse before. It’s fine, I won’t die, you might, easy choice.”
He watched as the hunters breathing evened into a natural cadence. Seeing Dean have an attack like that wasn’t new to Cas either, he’d watched both brothers break more often then he’d ever want to. He’d covertly aided them in fighting these as long as he’d known them, first consciously, then eventually instinctually. He couldn’t let them break, the world needed them, he needed them. As he watched his hunter sleep, brow furrowed even while dreaming, he wondered if he’d made a mistake in doing this. He hadn’t allowed them to vent their emotions in a very natural way. He’d bottled up their breakdowns for them, putting it away for another time, another place, once they where safe. But they’d never been safe. Over the years the trauma they’d survived would have shattered any other person on earth but them. Part of that was because Cas had pushed that trauma away, not letting them process in a natural way, trying to protect them. Now they both stood on a precipice, safety was finally in their grasp and no more Big Bads where on the horizon. Sam had done far better trying to process their grief over the years, Dean hadn’t even tried. The time was coming soon where Cas wouldn’t be able to do this anymore without causing worse damage.
“Rather I saved them.” Crowley corrected. “Or mother saved me, and then I saved them. I still don’t know if she did it because she wanted me alive or because she knew these two couldn’t make it back without me.”
“What do you wanna watch, angel?” Dean asked gently. His words seemed to have an effect on Cas because he stopped shaking.
“Did you?” Crowley said, truly shocked. “Huh, well I guess he said no. No matter, you got in here now, so you can get me out.”
“You said you could feel someone’s longing for you once.” Dean said hesitantly, “how could you... how could you not know then how much I love you? If you felt how badly I longed for you for all those years? How could you doubt me?”
“Cool it, love birds.” He hissed quietly. “You already sped up time with your gooey, doe eyed crap, but you’ll attract the entity if you don’t stop it, now!”
Sam walked in and stopped short at the sight of his hard ass brother absolutely cuddling the shit out of an actual angel of the lord. Again, he thought this would be hilarious if not for the fact it was life threatening to Cas. He couldn’t suppress the huge smile on his face though as he watched them unnoticed for a few seconds. Dean had a dopey smile on his face as he looked down at Cas laying on him. When would his brother just admit he was in love with Cas and be happy? Dean was obviously on cloud nine right now and he could have this all the time if he would just let go of all the self doubt, self loathing and internalized bullshit their father had beaten into him. Unfortunately all that was so deeply rooted Sam doubted Dean even realized he was in love with his best friend.
Cas turned back to Dean his hand reaching for him automatically. He felt Deans hand entwine with his own and melted a little from the pure happiness that made him feel. Crowley was right though, they needed to leave, now.
Their last hunt had been a coven Rowena had warned them about. Very powerful, very petty witches where setting up shop a few hours away from their home base. They knew of the Winchesters and their angel, they had been planning on smoking them out eventually to attack. The guys had hit first, thanks to rowenas warning.
He dipped his head again and brushed his lips against Deans forehead. Dean reached up and pulled his angel down slowly. Kissing him thoroughly. His body reacted more then his mind as he rolled into his back, pulling Cas on top of himself in the process. He’d shucked off his pants at some point in the night and was left in his boxers and a t-shirt, while the angel still had multiple layers on clothing covering his skin.
“I’m going to show you this.” Dean said as he slowed his pace, catching his breath. Cas eyes looked lust drunk as he lay beneath him. “You show me all the wonders of the world, I’ll show you every wonder of your body. I want you to experience everything there is to experience too. I want to be the one to make you feel this.”
Cas started shaking then and Dean soothed him again. The pain was still increasing steadily and Dean was trying his best to keep Cas as pain free as possible. He really was at his wits end here, he didn’t know how he could possible be any closer to Cas then he was now. They where so tangled up together Dean couldn’t tell where his limbs ended and Cas’ began. He wracked his brain trying to think of how the fuck you cuddle someone harder.
“I’ll tell Rowena to get her ass over here.” Sam offered as he walked towards the door. “Need anything else?”
“Crowley!” Dean growled, shaking the figure on the floor rudely. The demon awoke suddenly, alert and afraid.
Dean realized he’d never explained what happened when after Cas had died. He didn’t know if he could go through it again, especially now. He gave Cas the shortest version possible.
Dean was in a daze of happiness and exhaustion. He hadn’t slept in a few days but he couldn’t imagine ever wanting to sleep again. He kept hold of Cas the entire time, never letting his hand wonder far from his angels. To his chagrin no one commented on it, no one gave him a sideways glance or whispered behind their hands at the hunter who was so obviously in love with the angel. Instead everyone smiled when they saw, they where genuinely happy for him and Cas.
“Like a thousand, actually.” Dean chuckled, “but we have forever to get to those. Just one for now.”
Sam nodded, his eyes watering. Dean would do his very best to bring Cas back and live a life with him. He wouldn’t give up fighting because he finally starting to understand he deserved that life.
“Nothing!” Cas huffed, getting out of the car. As he did he gasped in pain and hugged himself, leaning against the side of the car. Both Winchesters almost took their doors off in the hurry to get to him. As soon as they touched him he stood up straighter and the pain in his eyes receded.
“Well,” Sam hesitated. “First off cuz I’m going to have to preform a spell, but I have to find it first. Second, the closer the person touching you is to your heart the better. Profound bond and all, you’re his best shot.”
He struggled to take another breath and choked on his sobs. Losing his father, losing Bobby, even his mother, had not prepared him for this amount of grief. This bitter, angry grief that was burning his soul and tearing him apart. His anger was only matched by his agony.
Her confidence in him was astounding and undeserved. He wasn’t so sure he could do this. It was, by far, the most complicated spell he’d ever seen, and required the caster to have incredible abilities to use it. If he screwed up one of two things would happen; he’d kill his brother, not technically but it would absolutely kill Dean to lose this chance. Or he’d kill himself. Sam took a deep shaking breath and let it out quickly, he had to try. As stricken and numb as Dean had been by the loss of their angel Sam was also hurting. Cas was his best friend, someone who he’d die for without hesitation. They both owed him this, not just Dean. Sam didn’t even get to say goodbye. And he couldn’t stand to see Dean die a slow death from grief, not if he could prevent it.
“Breathe.” Cas said calmly, settling himself on the bed next to him. “It’s okay Dean. I’m here, you’re safe. We’re safe now.”
“No questions?” Dean asked, surprised Crowley wasn’t prying for information like he always did. Dean had just dropped the fact Crowley’s mother had turned good, regretted his death, and was dead herself, and he didn’t have a single question about it?
How could he? How could Cas do this to him? He thought Cas knew, he thought he understood how Dean felt. He never had, and he had died not knowing. Deans biggest fear wasn’t death, wasn’t hell, wasn’t god himself, it was losing the people he loved. Being left. Every godforsaken thing he’d ever cared about was ripped from him, time and again, and he couldn’t stop it from happening.
“Wasn’t too far?” Dean asked, concerned. While he was enjoying this he realized Cas didn’t have much choice. Maybe he hated this. He’d hate to take advantage of the angel while he was vulnerable. To his surprise, Cas chuckled deeply and shook his head.
As the sun started to come up Dean and Cas entered Deans bedroom. They hadn’t been alone since the moment Dean had found Cas in the empty. As the door shut behind Dean a wave of anticipation washed over him, they hadn’t said what needed to be said yet, they hadn’t had the difficult conversation that needed to be had.
“Jacks god now.” He said bluntly. “He said he had to go fix chucks fuck ups. He said he’d be in the rain and the breeze and a bunch of other hippy shit, but he’s gone now. He said he wanted to be hands off and let humans actually have free will for once. I mean, it sounds great and all, but I don’t understand why he can’t come hang out with us while he does that.”
“I....” Dean stopped. He couldn’t deny he’d caused the angel immense pain since the day he’d met him. “How?”
“Almost, baby, almost.” Dean crooned kissing him gently and slowly, bringing him back from the very brink of orgasm before wrapping his hand around his cock once more. This time Cas returned the favor. At his touch Dean groaned loudly, his head bowing in pleasure.
“It’s okay Dean.” Sam said quickly, saving his brother from making a declaration of his own. “I know. We all know. I always thought you’d be the last to figure it out, but it ends up Cas was. The dumbass.”
“Better.” Crowley said approvingly, “not that I object to you two making fools of yourselves over each other, I’m used to it honestly. I’m just glad it’s blatant instead of subtextual, that gets old after awhile.”
Crowley listened intently once Dean got to the fight between them and god. He smiled as Dean told him the failed ways they tried to beat Chuck over and over. Then Dean got to the part of the story that hurt the worst, the reason he was here at all. Telling Crowley something so personal and painful would be torture, but Dean was done being silenced about his love for Cas. What Cas had done had saved the world, through his sacrifice he had saved all of humanity. Dean wouldn’t belittle it by not speaking of it.
Dean laughed lightly at that. He wasn’t quite sure he was still Dean. All this stuff coming out his mouth sure didn’t sound like him. He meant it though. Cuddling Cas just mellowed him enough to actually say it. He wasn’t just enjoying himself, he was craving more. He’d be lying if he didn’t admit he needed this almost as much as Cas did. He loved his angel. Saying the words was impossible for Dean, showing through action was easier, he was glad he had an excuse to do it.
All three jumped at the chirped greeting. No one could ever have mistaken that wonderfully naive and yet beautifully knowing voice for anyone else.
“Nah.” Dean sighed, “I don’t give a damn. Maybe she’ll laugh, hell, she is absolutely going to laugh, but if she can fix you I don’t care.”
Dean thought about it and realized Cas was right. Crowley, Rowena, Amara, Benny, and Cas, most of all Cas, had changed once they came into the brothers lives. He didn’t know how much of that was him and Sammy and how much of that was just trauma induced psychological damage, but they’d changed.
It was becoming quite the party, the bunker hadn’t been this full since they’d rescued the apocalypse world survivors, it had never seen this level of absolute joy and celebration. Sam and Eileen where rushing around, bringing food and drinks in from the kitchen. Jody and Donna had taken on the greeter role and Bobby was retelling the rescue tale for the group for the tenth time in the last few hours.
Donna, Jody, the girls, Bobby, charlie and all the apocalypse world survivors, they where okay too. Dean took pleasure in their survival and was glad to have them back again. But the ache didn’t go away.
As he said the angels name his brother let out another heart wrenching wail, and Sam knew. Cas was gone.
“I know.” Sam replied calmly. “Don’t worry, Charlie. Dean will be back, he’s gunna save Cas and then we’ll have to deal with them making us all uncomfortable again.”
“You know what, though?” Dean asked, pulling Cas closer. “Maybe we should all be more physically affectionate with each other. I’ve hugged you like, I dunno, a handful of times maybe? All the Shit we’ve been through, all the deaths and pain and torture... we probably are actual touched starved dumbasses. It wouldn’t hurt us at all to show each other some love sometimes you know?”
Cas gently ran his hand over the hunters forehead once more and watched as the fear drained from his face and he slept peacefully once again. Cas would need to find a lot more strength before he let Dean suffer through his trauma.
“I think so.” Sam said, sounding confident. “And probably won’t be longer then a day. I still don’t know what it is though. Cas, what are you feeling exactly?”
You can do this. You’re the most powerful witch I’ve ever met, excluding myself, of course. You need to embrace that dearie. Use that power to do the good you want to see in the world instead of squandering it. I won’t let you make the same mistake your brother did by not listening to me.
Jack may be all knowing and all powerful, but he’d seen what this story meant to them all. He knew, had to know, how important this was. Maybe being an omniscient being left you bereft of emotion, either way his absence had hurt.
‘In for a penny in for a pound. I’ll do whatever it takes.’  Dean thought, running his hands down Cas’ arms and back until the ball unfurled slightly. He nudged Cas’ head until it was wedged under his chin and ran his hand through the angels hair lightly. His other hand ran up and down Cas’ leg, urging his friend to calm down. He felt Cas sigh and smiled, this really wasn’t so bad.
“Because he understands.” Cas said sadly. “Jack, being part human and part divinity, he understands in a way Chuck never could. Jack will be a good god, I trust him to do what’s right.”
The sun beat down on Cas and Dean as they lay in their respective beach chairs. A light ocean breeze blows across their bear chest as they relax, actually relax, into the reggae beat playing over the speakers.
“Jack.” Dean started with sincerity. “Please, buddy, don’t disappear on us again. You’re family, you’ll always be family. Ain’t no going back on that deal kiddo. You gotta go do your god business? That’s fine, just know we will always be here waiting for you. You’ll always have a place here, with us.”
It had been hours and he still hadn’t finished it. Sam hadn’t been kidding when he said it was extremely complex.
Castiel was gone. His son, his favorite. The only one who ever actually defied him in a meaningful way. Lucifer got the credit for being the disobedient son, but in the end he too ran back to Chuck. Cas was the only one who fought against him to the bitter end and chose humanity, as he’d been commanded. He’d been able to do that only because of his love for Dean. He wondered, as he ran his fingers through the dirt absentmindedly, if Dean truly understood the significance of the angels declaration. His only regret was that he wouldn’t ever know the ending of that particular story line. The only one he hadn’t written himself, the one he’d fought against and tried to bury over and over. It had become the center focus, he’d never know how it all wrapped up now.
She said all of this while gently caressing Cas as he lay on Dean. Her eyes where full of sorrow as she finished.
His lungs wouldn’t fill. Every agonizing gasp barely felt enough to keep him upright. Panic started to creep in as Dean desperately pulled in ragged lungful after ragged lungful of air. His throat felt as if someone where squeezing it shut and his lungs wheezed laboriously. He could see Cas’ calm, beautiful face contort in panic as he battled his own body. He felt himself being lifted off his feet and gently placed on his bed.
“You need to sleep.” Cas stated. “You’ve been awake for days, I can feel your exhaustion. Sleep Dean, rest.”
Dean stared in shock. He tried to crush the spark of hope raising in his chest. Losing it would kill him, he knew he had barley been hanging on before but it wouldn’t be enough after he’d felt hope. In spite of his efforts a slow smile crept across his face, he was going to rescue Cas from perdition this time. He’d never let him live it down.
The entity had made a mistake though, it had assumed Cas had regrets left to dream of, he had none. Everything he’d done, all the bad, the mistakes, the horrible missteps, had lead to the moment he told Dean just how perfect and amazing he truly was. It lead to the moment of pure happiness Cas had experienced when he finally told Dean he loved him. He would do it all again, he would live through all the pain for eternity, as long as he died with Dean knowing he was loved. It had been worth it, Dean would always be worth it.
They putter around the garage a bit more, Dean cleaning up the stuff from before and running a cloth along Baby’s sleek lines to pick up dust that isn’t there. Sam stays with him, scrolling through his phone but not really paying attention to it, lost in thought trying to figure out what the hell these dreams are supposed to mean and who might be responsible for them if not Chuck.
His neck and shoulders are starting to yell at him and his lower back is doing all sorts of unpleasant things, so Dean resigns himself to now being awake and, as quietly as he can, gets up and out of the Impala. Like every hunter they’ve ever known, Sam is both a light and heavy sleeper -- sixth sense waking him on a dime when something’s creeping up on him, but also able to sleep whenever and wherever the opportunity arises. Sam doesn’t react when Baby’s door squeaks exactly the way Dean knew it would, but Dean winces anyway.
Cas decides it’s time to go because now it’s just him and Dean and Charlie and even though things thawed out once the game started, the discomfort of that kitchen conversation is echoing loudly through his mind, and he’s reached the frayed ends of his rope as far as socializing is concerned.
“So that’s the part that’s kind of… about us. I don’t think he wrote it that way, about two kids or anything, but just that knowledge of what it’s like to try and fit a whole life into a place that’s only meant to be passed through.”
! I was before but now that I’ve seen--- your wings are beautiful, man, you can’t lose ‘em.” Dean’s kind of panicking now. “Are you gonna lose them if you stick with us?”
“This wouldn’t be the first time a bunch of people on the internet made something real because they wrote about it too much. Like I said, tulpas.”
After a couple of seconds passed in silence it’s pretty clear Conrad’s not going to elaborate on that. “Uh okay, we’ll just go get it then.” Dean jerks his head toward the Impala and Sam and Cas follow. Once they’re back at the car and out of earshot, Cas speaks.
jokes), but if Cas was into it he’d be fine with playing along. But Cas doesn’t seem all that interested in his own ideas either. It’s like he’s trying to pick the right answer based on what he thinks a date is supposed to be, like he read it in a book somewhere or, yeah, watched it on a carefully manicured TV show.
Dean shakes his head while he pulls Baby onto the shoulder behind the line of cars that stretches up the road to Rocky’s, the bar’s small gravel parking lot long since full.
Cas squints up at Sam, everything about his expression radiating pity at the man’s bewildering stupidity. “I’ve always had wings, Sam. I am an angel.”
Thanks for reading! Promise much more Cas in the next chapter; he kind of got put on Conrad babysitting duty.
Finally, Dean speaks. “Look, I’m gonna be rude, not on purpose but it’s gonna happen. And you’ll be rude too. And I’ll tell you when you are and you’ll tell me when I am. And we’ll try to fix our shit. That’s it. That’s the best we can do.” Dean sighs, swipes a hand down his face. “I know what it does to be always trying to fix problems that haven’t even happened yet, or to think problems are only for you to solve, one-sided, like the work is all on you. You will make yourself disappear under the weight of that.” After a second or two, Dean blinks wide, stretches his face. “Okay uh, moment over,” and suddenly Dean’s grinning, not really a false gesture, but still a deliberate one. “Man, I’m thinking maybe you got your wish about skipping straight to the knowing each other part. I don’t even know your last name and here we are having a fucking heart-to-heart, shit.”
“It doesn’t have to, you know." This is Sam quiet but certain, Mr. Sensitive here to save the freakin' day with a marriage counseling session or some shit.
Empty. Dean was, empty. He sobbed on the floor of the dungeon, cold seeping into his very bones as he shook with gasping breaths. Far, far away, the sound of his phone vibrating cut off once more. How often had he heard it in the past few hours? He’d lost count. It started vibrating again almost immediately, the sound so faint in his ears he wouldn’t register it if he hadn’t been holding on to it like a life line. The noise was the only thing linking him to the present, the rest of him lived firmly in the past.
“It differs, from case to case.” Rowena explained, “try to figure it out if you want, or just have a nice relaxing day in bed together. Either way, Cas will be fine by this time tomorrow.”
“You don’t need to say anything,” Cas assured him, turning to face Dean. “I know everything I need to know. You don’t have to actually say it.”
Suddenly the absolute blackness over his consciousness started to recede. He heard the voice again, this time his fingers twitched in response.
“Good.” Dean said as he nuzzled Cas. That action seemed to be a shot of morphine to Cas and he sighed in relief. Dean did it again with the same result and chuckled.
“No.” Jack said sadly. “I have so much to do, and amara has so much to teach me. We’re really working together this time, as it was supposed to be from the start.”
“No.” Dean said while leaning in to kiss Cas’ forehead again, “don’t apologize, okay? Don’t ever apologize for making noise my angel, I love it. Let’s go out there and see our family off.”
“Obviously,” Charlie said in a lighter tone, “Jack couldn’t bring Cas back from The Empty. Probably something to do with cosmic balance or some shit, but that’s never stopped us. I must really love you, cuz I went to Rowena for help. She’s letting us use the Book of the Damned and pointed me in the right direction. There aren’t many ways to summon The Empty into our world, and there is only one way to do so without making the entity itself aware. Sams getting everything ready now. We’re going to get him Dean, we’re going to save him.”
“It said it wanted me to experience true happiness before it took me.” Cas explained, “telling you how much I loved you was a moment of happiness. I didn’t care, at the time, if those feelings went both ways. Telling you how I felt, letting my truth and my feelings be known, that was the happiest I’d ever been. But it wasn’t pure. I felt incredible sorrow too. I knew I was leaving you, and I wouldn’t be able to protect you anymore. I knew my words would hurt you, though I didn’t think it was because you felt the same, I thought you’d feel guilt, anger, all the things you usually take upon yourself.”
“You still hadn’t figured that out?” Crowley asked incredulously. “Castiel has been in love with you since he pulled you out of hell. He may not have known what that meant at the time but I sure thought you did.”
Sam burst into laughter at that. Dean looked away embarrassed and mumbled something about how “even god should mind his damn business.”
Chuck sat on the ground, too tired to scrape and crawl through the dirt anymore. The car, the most important object on earth, was gone, they wouldn’t come back for him. Through the very human tears he smiled, they’d won. He always knew they’d win, even if he couldn’t figure out how.
Dean stared at her, fury rising in his throat. His grief, his torture, it was his to bear. Speaking of it wouldn’t help, it would rip off the half formed scab that had formed through sheer willpower. How could he ever trust anyone to hear what actually happened and understand what it meant?
“Because you’re happy.” Crowley said matter of factly. “Time here is relative, to your emotions specifically. The worse your regrets, the longer your suffering. The smaller your failure, the less time passes. You two being cute little turtle doves is forcing the time to go at light speed.”
Cas stared at Dean, his green eyes flashing his emotions. Pain, sadness, disbelief, anger. But love too, always love.
“Fuck that.” Dean spat. “Peace. Of course I wanted peace. But fighting for it is what makes it worth it. I’ll always fight for it.”
“Dean!” Cas said, nails digging, back arching in response. Dean could feel Cas’ cock twitching and straining as their bodies frantically pushed against each other, chasing the friction they both craved. Dean quickly had them both striped naked.
They laid on the couch silently as Dean continued to run one hand through Cas’ hair and the other up and down his side gently. Dean lightly pressed his lips to the angels temple and Cas gasped.
He slid like a baseball player next to the body and almost screamed in agony. It wasn’t Cas. It was Crowley. He should have expected Rowena to do something like this. His anger dissipated when he remembered this was the one regret Rowena had. Of course she’d want Dean to bring back Crowley too.
“I couldn’t miss the celebration!” He said once they’d stopped pummeling him with affection. “I’m sorry, Cas.”
“Death was literally knocking on the door and we where fucked.” Dean said as lightheartedly as he could. He would have to force himself to say the next part, but for Cas, he would. “Then Cas decided he’d seal a deal he made with the empty in order to save me. See he... he told the empty it could take him to save Jack. The empty said it wouldn’t take him until he experienced a moment of true happiness. So he... so Cas...”
“Dean.” Cas said soothingly as Dean continued to cling to him desperately. The angel wrapped his arms around Dean once more as the hunter pulled in gasping breaths.
They passed by samadriel and Dean checked his watch again. 4 hours. They’d make it if they kept this pace. Cas stopped suddenly and knelt by the beatific figure.
“I could feel longing, yes.” He answered slowly. “It wasn’t longing for me specifically I felt though. When someone was longing, wanting, praying for something, that’s what drew me to them. The longing I felt from you, it was intense, always. From the moment we met you longed for something fiercely. I always assumed you longed for peace. For Sam to be safe, for an end to the fighting, for a resolution.”
“Why don’t you move to your bed if you want to be comfortable?” Sam asked, “might as well, you guys can Netflix and chill.”
“Yeah, no, Cas.” Dean quickly explained. “I’m not embarrassed of us being together. Maybe I was before, maybe that’s part of the reason I couldn’t bring myself to tell you, and I’m sorry for it. But, I don’t care anymore. If someone has a problem with us being together or has something to say they can fuck off. You were right when you said we’ve earned this, we’ve earned us. I’m just thinking no one wants to hear all that and it isn’t exactly polite of us.”
Dean let himself be rocked in Cas’ arms for a few moments, not saying anything. His head tucked under the angels chin, his hands tracing symbols on Cas’ arm and chest.
The party had started to wind down at midnight, by 3am the only people still awake where Dean, Cas and Sam. They cleaned up the party related mess happily. Everyone they loved had been under the bunkers roof at some point in the night. Rowena had stopped in early, dragging Crowley out with her after a surprisingly emotional reunion for the mother and son. They left with the cryptic words, “you’ll be hearing from us, Winchesters.” Everyone else had either left or crashed for the night in one of the many empty rooms the bunker could accommodate. Everyone they loved, excepting one very important person. Jack hadn’t shown.
Dean could still feel Cas shaking in his arms. Their cuddling wasn’t really much of a cuddle, more of Dean trying to hold on to a ball of angst and pain in his lap.
They continued walking, not saying anything and just basking in their finding one another once again. Once again, Crowley was the one to break the moment.
Sam opened the door and almost panicked when he saw Cas laying on one side of the bed, facing away from Dean, asleep. He almost thought Cas was dead for a minute but one look at Dean’s sappy love struck face told him different. Dean put a finger to his lips and shooed Sam back out the door, following quietly.
Dean nodded, embarrassed. He hadn’t really thought about what he was doing. He peaked up at Cas and saw him smiling sadly back at him.
Weeks passed and they settled into a domestic routine. Sam and Eileen moved into a wing of the complex together and it became their space from then on. Cas and Dean took the wing Deans room was already in and made it their own. Since they’d moved in Sam and Dean hadn’t done much in the way of redecorating the mid century modern motif that had come with the place. Now either wing had its own feel, it’s own individual flavor. Sam and Eileens side ran towards the colloquial, bookshelves overflowing and sturdy furniture, reading nooks filled to the brim with soft cushioned couches. Cas and Dean leaned more modern and minimalist in their wing. The sharp atheistic of heavens halls could be felt when one entered it. It gave Cas comfort to see order in his living space, and Dean had always lived minimally, so it perfect for them both.
“I mean, I don’t think it’s his favorite topic of conversation or anything, but yeah he’s always been better at feelings stuff and just... thinking. That giant brain of his…” Dean chuckles softly. “You know it’s funny. Part of the reason I hate talking about this is because I really don’t think it was that bad, how we grew up. I mean I know it was, especially now that I’m older, but if I don’t let myself think about it, like
On TV and in movies, you know a character is depressed because someone comes over to their house and sees that they’re artfully disheveled and have been eating nothing but cereal for a couple days. Maybe there are empty bottles laying around, maybe someone declined an invitation to a party, maybe someone ate ice cream for dinner,
“Heyyyy Cas,” Dean rocks back on his heels and swings his arms where they hang at his sides, asking “what the hell are you wearing” in every possible way but verbally.
“Man, these pancakes are seriously great,” Dean choked out around an entire quarter of the stack of pancakes that was already stuffed into his cheeks, making him look like a particularly handsome chipmunk. “Dude you---”
It’s just that Dean wasn’t really a fancy steakhouse kind of guy. He was a diner kind of guy, places where the biscuits were drowned in sausage gravy and the waitresses were pros that snapped their gum and called you hon while balancing a meal for four on every inch of both their arms.
After this, things get casual. Not in the sense that they lack importance, but that they get comfortable and easy. Cas definitely still gets overwhelmed and Dean still questions himself sometimes, but somehow it just doesn’t seem to matter as much anymore. The catastrophizing that both men are quite frankly
“I love you, Dean,” Lisa said, her eyes shining with unshed tears. “You are a wonderful, caring, funny, smart man and you were a great boyfriend.”
Castiel is still and his face is blank -- blanker than normal -- and Dean watches as he shifts a little, tries to sit up straighter, to pull a more pleasant expression up over his features.
When they finally do solidify, Cas’ wings are such a deep, dark black that it hurts to look at them. For a split second he’s worried he’s about to have his eyes burned out of his skull in some sort of divine accident, but Dean quickly realizes that what’s causing his throbbing headache is the contrast. The sun is so bright out here that at first the sudden appearance of this wall of blackness is too much for his brain to handle. As his eyes adjust, though, Dean sees that the wings aren’t just a dark mass, like someone cut twin holes in the universe right over his friend’s back. The wings
“I’m supposed to be the devil and you’ve been to the future. Since when do our lives make sense, Dean?”
Dean yanks the sleeve down one last time, resolutely not looking over at Cas. “Jesus Sam, how long does it take you to brush your princess hair?” he shouts at the closed bathroom door.
Dean wrinkles his eyebrows at these conflicting thoughts, clears his throat, finally looks away. “Uh yeah… man I could go for some coffee.”
Castiel smiles at this, a broad gummy thing that has Dean feeling proud of himself for making the man smile the way he’d seen in those pictures the last time they were here, pictures of Cas at his most comfortable. Dean claps Cas on the shoulder and finally makes to get out of the car. “Let’s eat.”
, and suddenly Dean is done lazing around and just wants to be up and moving and doing something. “Hey Cas, so I gotta get up now.” When Cas doesn’t move, Dean prods at him with a foot until he gets the hint and stands.
Dean rolls his eyes but it’s a toothless gesture. Cas is right that this is probably much nicer than they -- than
And Dean liked breakfast food. He still remembered nights when his dad was gone and his mom hugged him and made him pancakes for dinner, just to make him smile. He’d get sticky with syrup and his mom would wet a paper towel and wipe his face and hands, and she would kiss the top of his head and read to him until he fell asleep, warm and loved.
Dean finally quiets down with a laugh and they drive on in silence for a while, Dean letting himself bask in the simple pleasure of the open road. They’re in Nebraska still, route keeping them far enough from Omaha and Lincoln that they never really see anything they can call a city. A town or two here and there, sometimes just a gas station at a crossroads that reminds Dean a little too much of dragging himself up out of the dirt, but mostly it’s endless fields. It’s desolate in a way that’s still filled with life; knots of cattle gather here and there along fences that parallel the roadway, and the land from the edge of the asphalt to the flat line of the distant horizon is a carpet of green that ripples in the breeze.
“You know how it is, Sam. You left. For a while anyway. Before I dragged you back. You ever think about that, how your life would have been different -- normal -- if I hadn’t come to Palo Alto looking for you that night?”
Dean smiles at this. “Actually yeah, I get that. So you were tired, that’s okay man. But what I don’t get is why you paid. I asked you on a date and
There’s a liquor store down the block; Dean gestures toward it and the two of them start walking. On the way back, Dean carrying a six pack and a bottle of something harder wrapped in a paper bag and tucked under his arm, he finally breaks the silence.
“Oh.” It’s clear Cas doesn’t see the significance of all this, and Dean doesn’t look too convinced either.
He watches the sun starting to set over the western edge of the crater, a mirror image of this morning, the same but reversed, then turns to head back.
Before Cas could reply, Mildred sidled up to the counter, snapping her gum and tapping a pencil on the order pad in her hand. “You boys doin’ okay?”
Dean leans forward into Cas, mouthing kisses along his jaw. Cas is still quiet, but he’s more relaxed now. Reaching behind Cas, he lightly trails a hand down Cas’ back. Or at least, that’s what he was going to do before Cas jerks away from Dean’s touch.
Sam lets Dean stew for a bit and calm himself down before speaking again. “Like you said, Dean, are those really the only options? What would you do if it was up to you?
“You were out of food and I wanted to help. Also uh,” Cas’ voice gets quieter as he rushes through these last three words, “Dean needs pie.”
That good humor Dean managed to scrounge up for himself is almost gone by the time the three of them walk into the casino, but he clings to the scraps and after a few minutes has managed a pretty decent welding job on his mood. The air in here is weird -- artificial and processed, but also smoky as hell -- and it’s even more garish inside than it was out on the Strip, but Dean ignores all of that as he heads purposefully to his destination. Up there, ahead, past the high rollers section and a weird massage booth, Dean can see telltale signs of the 24th century. He speeds up, knows he’s grinning, not really a happy smile but more of a fragile “all work and no play makes Dean a dull boy” grimace. He’s so ready for the sense of relief and relaxation -- he’s about to get to do this one stupid fun thing for himself -- that he’s almost angry about it. For a single day he gets to be just some dumbass guy who likes Star Trek, who isn’t an archangel’s vessel, who isn’t expected to burn himself out save the world, who---
“Well, continue ahead,” Cas says as the Impala passes a large sign advertising the “Barringer Meteor Crater National Landmark and Visitor Center, next right.”
Castiel knew Rocky’s would be the first place he ran into, his first chance to make a phone call. Actually, it’d probably be his
to what Chuck wrote back then, and as shitty as some of the events had been to live through they always made Sam and Dean stronger, fuller versions of themselves afterward. But now-Chuck? Now-Chuck is just petty and spiteful and while Sam isn’t as openly over Chuck’s bullshit as Dean is, he’s just as done.
“You’re right. A slice of peach as well.” Not looking over at his brother, Dean points a spoon at him and preempts any additional complaints with “
Cas backed up, eyes wide and freaked out. Damn, Dean was scaring him. Dean needed to calm down, he needed to sit down, tease Cas a little to make sure he knew Dean wasn’t actually angry with
They’ve been wandering around the casino for a bit, Cas alternating between openly scrutinizing his surroundings and doing that closed off lost in thought thing he does to file stuff away in his giant angel brain. After a while Cas, who’s back in scrutiny mode, gestures toward a big and very complicated slot machine (maybe?) off to the right. It’s Star Trek themed, has two seats in front of side-by-side screens like those fancy arcade games that Dean always avoided as a kid because they ate through his quarters too fast, and for some reason a Wheel of Fortune wheel is mounted on top of the whole contraption.
“You’re not an idiot.” Crowley growled, “you’re an imbecile, there’s a difference. An imbecile would stumble along for over a decade, in love with a celestial being but never saying anything because they’re too scared to admit they feel something for another man. An idiot would let that angel rot and not try to save him.”
Cas chuckled softly and obeyed Dean. Stripping off multiple layers of clothing as the hunter watched greedily. He laid down on the bed once more, no more clothes then Dean. Cas hadn’t seemed to be willing to take that final step and be completely naked yet, Dean would change that soon enough.
“No!” Dean almost shouted, clutching Cas to him like a lifeline. “No, please don’t leave me Cas. Stay with me, okay? Please stay with me. Forever, I hate it when you leave me, I want you with me all the time.”
“Oh, never quite boring.” Crowley explained, “just tedious. Will they, won’t they? Do they, don’t they? Part of me never got tired for looking for it, but the other part of me became so frustrated that you two wouldn’t just get on with it already.”
“My soul remembered.” Dean nodded. “That actually explains a lot. I always felt that we had something more between us. I swear the first time Pamela said your name I recognized it as someone... important to me. Someone who’s always be important to me.”
“No.” Crowley said shortly. “I’ll sort things out with mother when I see her again. I assume she’s running hell in my absence?”
They found their family again. Everyone who’d been snapped out of existence was back. Sam found Eileen and didn’t hesitate for an instant to tell her he loved her. Dean was happy for him, Sam deserved someone as great as Eileen to spend his life with.
“Don’t.” Sam said, “they’ve both always had a flair for the dramatic, it wouldn’t be Cas and Dean if they didn’t stretch it out to the last second.”
“The moment I pulled you from hell.” Cas said honestly. “I had to put you back together, atom by atom, fixing all the damage done to your body. I touched you’re soul doing this, truly held it in the palm of my hands, and felt how bright and truly beautiful it was. I didn’t know what love was then, my feelings where a distraction and a hinderance to me then. I agreed with heaven when they said I was too close to my charge, you, and agreed to be reprogrammed without a thought. It took all of a few days for me to fall for you all over again. No amount of torture or brainwashing could ever make me forget how much I loved you, how much you’d changed me.”
So when the guy sat down, Cas made a note. When he noticed that it was the egg guy from last week, that note got a little longer and Cas looked away to hide the tiny smile that had crept onto his face. Inside Cas was beaming, his mind immediately free-associating on eggs in a frantic but orderly cascade. Eggs. Chicken eggs. Chocolate eggs. Ostrich eggs. Ostrich eggs! Where could he find an ostrich egg in Kansas? How much do they cost? An ostrich egg is the equivalent of 24 chicken eggs; he could make 24 of the same thing or 24 different things. Hmm, but not things that each required a discreet yolk, so probably just one very large thing. He doesn’t think he could make one perfect runny ostrich egg because its much larger volume would mean it wouldn’t cook through the same way as a chicken egg. Perhaps he could cook one enormous fried egg on the flat top and serve it with a pizza cutter...
because it was put in front of me. You know Dad, he was never one to explain the plan. Just told us our part in it and expected us to go along.”
pie today -- and starts milling up and down the aisles of the small store. This is one of those mom-&-pop gas stations you still sometimes find in the middle of nowhere and are the best places to stop for road food. The big chains like Gas-n-Sip all sell the same crap you can find anywhere, but these little places always seem to have some previously forgotten favorite that Dean didn’t even know was still made. This time it’s an off
Dean feels himself blush a little at that and hopes the slight flush on his cheeks from the beer will cover it up. “Well uh, I’d rather hang out here too but I don’t think our friend over there would be too happy about it. Pretty sure we’ve seen just about everything this casino has to offer -- yeah, not much, I know,” Dean responds to Cas’ confusion, “but the other ones have other stuff. Shopping malls and shows and um, there’s a big fountain that like, is a fountain? Please don’t say the fountain, that sounds so lame. Uhhh, there’s an aquarium I think, and some animatronic thing at Caesar’s and---”
musical we stumbled onto what, seven eight years later.” The more Sam talks about this, the surer he is that he’s onto something. He grabs the laptop sitting at the other end of the table and pulls it over to himself, settling in for what could be the most important and bizarre research session of his life.
The shadow that had been wrapped over Castiel’s back starts to move and Dean takes an involuntary step back from where he’d been standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, staring at this weird dimness that’s somehow starting to seem tangible. It’s like the absence of light is itself a material thing. Dean flashes back to that night in the barn when he saw the shadow of Castiel’s wings; it had been hard to say how big they actually were because shadows are tricky like that and also Dean was busy kinda freaking out inside, but Dean thinks maybe he’s about to find out.
“Yes, you can get some coffee.” Castiel finally looked somewhere other than Dean’s mouth, looking instead at Dean’s furrowed brow. Wait, why was Dean’s brow furrowed? Crap, Cas knew he’d missed something and quickly replayed the last few seconds in his mind. “Oh, you would like me to get you some coffee.”
It’s not long before the kiss gets messed up because Dean can’t stop grinning like an idiot, and since Cas doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing he just keeps kissing Dean’s teeth and the whole thing continues to get more and more absurd. Before he can school his features and get back to the very serious business of making out with an angel of the lord, Dean hears the doorknob jiggle in the “Hey, I’m comin’ in” pattern he and Sam worked out as horny teenagers living with zero privacy.
It’s late now, and Cas is sitting on Dean’s bed, comfies on and phone in hand, browsing through the site Sam had pulled up earlier. He looks up when Dean enters, towel around his waist, hair wet from the shower, and a surge of warmth blooms in his chest. Cas had thought he might never have this again, had tried so hard to make himself stop missing it; the mirror shine in Dean’s eyes tells Cas he’d tried that too.
?” Lisa asked, which didn’t make any sense. Dean was trying so hard to give her what she wanted but it still wasn’t making her happy and he didn’t know what else he was supposed to be doing.
Dean groans again, turns to his bottle for comfort, realizes it’s empty, grabs Sam’s untouched one, and takes a deep drink. “Alright, let’s say it is. Why would you be seeing it? Seeing Chuck’s ‘writing’ I get, kind of, I mean you’re connected or whatever, but it’s not like you shot the internet.”
“Ha, got you!” The burst of laughter that comes out of Sam’s stupid face is long and loud and it would be awesome if he’d stop now. When he finally does, he remembers why they’re having this conversation in the first place and gets back down to business. “So Cas, it’s this show---”
Slowly rolling his sore shoulders and gripping and untensing fists that are still very much aware of having been curled around a shovel all day yesterday, Dean looks across the top of the Impala and out over the desert. Off a long ways away, Castiel stands statue still, back to Dean, just existing in the desert. The nearby mountains are glowing red in the morning sun, and Cas looks even more out of place than usual, a guy in a trenchcoat and an ill-fitting suit. It’s haunting in a way, but yeah, it also kinda looks like a shitty Don Henley album cover. Dean grumbles to himself for ruining the moment with
