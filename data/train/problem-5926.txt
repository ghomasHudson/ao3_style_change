That cheek-a kindling of the morn,
“Miss Rushman, Miss Potts will see you now”
“what? I thought that was supposed to be on Monday. Pep I distinctly remember it being on a Monday and today is not that day right J? Tony asked circling around the work bench not paying much attention to the woman before him silently praying that his invention gets the gist and goes along with it.
Tony’s personal driver Happy turned out to be a very nice guy. He had soft pastel blue wings which somehow matched him perfectly. They were talking about something Steve can’t quite remember anymore when Tony walked up to them looking absolutely stunning in a black pinstripe suit and impeccably groomed wings. He looked nothing like the man Steve had been seeing for the past five days. This was
The brunette’s wings were raised on each side as if in presentation, as if Tony was presenting to Steve to……oh god! No one in his whole miserable life had ever done that and he couldn’t stop the loud gasp that managed to escape his mouth.
Oh…..there was someone. “There’s a nice deli just down this road, if it’s okay you can call while i get us dinner” They exited New York a while back and was now driving down the I-95.
Steve tried to fight back as much as his frail body would allow but he couldn’t hold out long. He doesn’t even want to think about what would’ve happened if Tony hadn’t arrived in time. He would breakdown again if he did.
“He insisted on the name and the meeting, he can be pretty persuasive sir” JARVIS replied in a smug tone.
“Are they Stark tech?”
“How did-…….never mind; as a matter of fact the redhead in question will be working in the SI offices, right now I would like you to come meet your new PA, Steve Rogers” pepper said placing her hands on Tony’s back and pushing him towards the elevators.
“Steve you’re safe you’re with me. I’m sorry…….I’m so sorry” it was taking everything in Tony not to break down. “Can I hug you?”
They were teasing each other about drawing the suit when Steve noticed that they were standing very close to each other just like this morning in the dining room.  His heart rate kicked up a notch but what really took his breath away was what he saw behind Tony.
“Wow is anyone dying or something because Tony stark just said he was grateful” Rhodey joked aloud.
“I can take care of myself Tony” Steve cut him off with an enraged look and an equally aggrieved tone.
“Well what you have is not enough and I don’t really mind spending money” Steve’s face fell at that, he clenched his jaw his whole demeanor became defensive.
It didn’t get tense as Steve thought it would, both of the friends treating it like casual banter. When everyone else left it was only Steve and Tony left at the house.
According to Bucky, Stubbornness was his twin brother so Steve was not going to stupidly fall in love and burden his Ma with finding money for a Hanahaki surgery. The only person he personally knew that had it was a man from across their apartment who was in love with another man. The world they were living in deemed it unnatural and that man was going to die of unrequited love, and so he did. Steve was Scared then, what if he also fell in love with a man instead of a dame.
“JARVIS what’s wrong with Tony?” he asked raising his head toward the ceiling.
Tony immediately had to stifle an amused laugh that threatened to escape him. He managed to cover it by placing his fisted palm across his mouth. Here was a five foot four, ninety-ish pound man who he is paying to be his assistant by the way, telling to his face that he was an asshole.
"So it's a he" Steve was staring at him with venom in his eyes now.
Maybe Stark could tell her later and both of them could laugh about how stupid Steve was. God he couldn’t wait for this to be over to go back to Brooklyn and wallow in self-pity.
"Jarvis scan em "
First of all let me apologize for any of the historical/cultural/geographical inaccuracies as i am not from the US. I did do my fair share of research (if only i did that for my actual research projects)  and sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes, i know how sexy good grammar is.
“Yeah sure. You any good” Tony teased.
If he could summarize, the billionaire looked like death warmed over; with dark circles under his eyes, dull droopy wings and messy hair. He leaked exhaustion from every pore.
I saw; and fancy sped.
“Is that supposed to do that?” the blond asked with concern.
This was a lot to take in for Steve at the moment. His mind kept replaying the moment he saw Tony yank that thing out of his chest.
He made himself a cup of hot chocolate and decided to curl up on the couch with a book. He couldn’t focus on the book at all and his mind started to wander off thinking about what he did wrong. He was so out of it, didn’t even hear the elevator come up and was startled by a voice.
Knowing the blonde quite well by now, the super spy only smirked a bit. “Did you run all the way here?”
Steve reeled his head back and stared at the man with open shock. This is a hundred percent the most absurd thing Steve had heard in the whole month and he works for Tony Stark.
Steve was so overwhelmed he felt like he would breakdown then and there. Suddenly in the midst of all that chaos he felt a small tug at his sleeve. Steve turned around to face Tony looking devastatingly earnest and open.
The poisoning was getting worse and worse and by JARVIS’s estimates he only had about two months left of his miserable life. This year would be his last birthday if he could survive that long.
“Classified”
“Budapest” she deadpanned looking at the cup of coffee in her hands.
“Who the fuck are you?” the man growled at Tony and eventually let go of Steve.
He was about to call it a night and go get some much needed sleep, that’s when it clicked.
Tony just stood there on the threshold staring with his mouth open. Both of them startled when the cup fell from Tony’s hands and crashed on the floor.
What he didn’t expect was the genius’s offer to take him flying. Steve agreed despite the worries because it would be lying if he said that he wasn’t excited at the prospect himself.
“It’s Tony stark, Buck. I’m allowed to be a little nervous” Steve stopped pacing anyway and slid down onto the chair opposite to Bucky.
“I have lunch with Steve” The surprise on both their faces was something to behold. The two of them just stood there staring at Tony and Tony staring back with a mildly confused expression.
“Stop pacing, you’re gonna wear the floor down Stevie”
“What else can I add to it, J?”
“We are going back to the tower” she said, her eyes fixed on the dead fork and Steve suddenly felt afraid for Tony.
“Your suit for tomorrow is on your bed Mr. Stark. Is there anything else I can do?” Rogers asked before leaving.
But Mr. Stark was not always formal words and silent gestures. When Steve would almost feel bad for judging the man upon preconceived notions, the genus would come at Steve with a sharp quip or a sarcastic comment some of which he found oddly amusing. Steve wasn’t actually sure which side he liked more. But most of the times his boss was a complete and utter dick and that made Steve wonder if the billionaire was just an asshole trying his best to be polite? or on the very off chance was he a kind man trying his hardest to hide his vulnerabilities behind a brash and flashy exterior?
When Tony didn't reply he continued in a softer voice "You don't want to tell me who it is, fine I get it but you're dying so please get the surgery Tony"
“I’m not going to apologize to butt-face or his minions” he said leaning back on the wall opposite to them.
“The parameters of your wings are deliberately not in my protocol sir” okay JARVIS was condoning him now like he hadn’t had enough of that for a life time from his old man.
Finallyyyyyy.........it happened.
Shame on his super soldier reflexes, he jumped, actually jumped off the couch turned around and saw that it was tony. His heart ached a little at the sight. It was clear that tony didn’t sleep these past two days. There were bags under his eyes and if Steve was ever to point that out Tony would sass about it with something along the line of them being Gucci or custom or some other ridiculously expensive brand and that’s one of the reasons why Steve loves the man.
“Steve did you finish packing? we leave tonight”
“Toxicity is currently two percent. Should I send a thank you note to Mr. Rogers or perhaps a fruit basket?” it was the simple observation that enabled the early detection. Tony would never have realized it until one or more of the later symptoms started showing.
Thankful that the focus had now shifted from him he walked into his room ‘What the fuck is happening?’ uttered by a very confused Bucky was the last thing Steve heard before he shut his door.
This fic will probably have at least two extra chapters from what is shown. I hope that's not an inconvenience.
“Do they hurt?” Steve asked after a long moment.
The only time it bothered him was when he held hands with other people. He caught most of them flinch at the initial contact, after which they generally reused to place their hands anywhere near his for extended periods of time. After a while he could ignore the light pang of hurt whenever anyone did that, his hands were too rough to be comfortable anyway, he understood. So he gradually avoided handshakes or holding the hands of his dates even though sometimes people thought he was an asshole.

“Fine don’t listen, I’ll just call Happy”
Steve was standing by the side rolling his eyes more than necessary to what Tony was saying on stage although he had to admit the man was made of pure charm and charisma. For the briefest of moments Tony’s eyes met Steve’s and he found himself immobilized by that intense gaze but the moment was gone as fast as it came.
“It’s beautiful isn’t it?” he asked not really to the man holding him but he answered yes anyway.
Steve promptly snorted the water out his nose at the blunt reply. “What?....JARVIS?”
Steve was having none of it and his voice remained soft. Dammit Rogers why can't you be an asshole when I want you to be "Look Ste-"and he was thrown into a fit again. No surprise there. Roses, fully bloomed red roses only marred by a bit of his blood. They only meant one thing and judging by Steve's expression he knew it too.
“Steve Rogers, Mr. Stark's PA” he answered a bit defiantly.
This thing he feels for Steve, Tony doesn’t know how much longer he could keep it in. But he knows he has to for the sake of the other man.
“Say why don’t you tell your friend to pay me a visit when we get back. I can get him the latest prototype”
“Tony I thought-“
Tony had to stifle a laugh. Steve was smart and his choice of words was good, if it were anything else JARVIS would probably have been offended.
? He had seen this all before, back when Bucky came back and had realized that he couldn’t fly anymore, when he was too deep down in a hole of depression and self-hate.
Steve had no idea what happened. To say that he was shocked and confused would be an understatement.
“Don’t you have anyone to tell that you won’t be coming home tonight? He knew Steve didn’t have any parents or siblings, a girlfriend or boyfriend maybe? He was really hoping that Steve didn’t.
“Welcome home Sir and Congratulations on the opening ceremony it was such a success as was your senate hearing and may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on Sir” Jarvis said amusedly playing a video of the mentioned hearing on a screen.
“What happened?”
He could fly again as much as he wanted albeit in a suit of armor that is. But he could live with that.
When list! he hears a piteous moan-
Tony imprisoned himself in his Malibu mansion and for the first few weeks refused to move from his bed despite Rhodey’s and pepper’s constant pleading or obadia’s ill placed cheering up sessions. After agreeing that he did enough wallowing in self-pity, he decided to do something about it and fix himself. Well if anyone could pull it off it would be Tony, the genius himself right?
To say that their relationship hit him like a freight train would be putting it mildly.
(See the end of the chapter for
**The man from before, Ivan was leaning over and holding down a struggling Steve on the floor. Steve’s clothes were in disarray; shirt untucked, pants unbuckled and tears streaming down his face. One hand of the larger man was inside Steve’s shirt the other was covering his mouth. **
The genius had already gotten up and grabbed Steve’s shirt sleeve “Really its fine, come on”
The aforementioned stubborn dandelion fluff with opinions has arrived.
“Not when it comes to Stark” the other man grumbled under his breath but Steve heard it anyway.
It was breaking his heart to see Steve like this. He fished out his phone to quickly dial Happy and scooped Steve up in a bridal carry after it. Steve just clung to his shoulders, pressing his face to Tony’s chest in an effort to hide. They got out through the back exit, Tony carrying Steve the whole time. Happy
“Very” the Russian said facing Steve, practically leering at him with a predatory smile.
“What?.......No uh, I still need him” he blurted out standing up abruptly.
“What?” Tony stood up and walked over to the glass panels. He purposefully never kept any full length mirrors in the work shop or bedroom, the two places he spends most of his time in. The glass panels were reflective enough but the image was blurry so he couldn’t make out much.
“Is he something like JARVIS?”
Then they were flying and what an experience it was. Sure he had flown on planes before but flying like this with the wind on your face was a whole other feeling. It made him giddy that he got to do this, something Steve thought would never happen in his life.
He was not in an emotional state to deal with Tony’s shit right then so the moment the two men stepped out of the elevator he jumped in. The last thing Steve saw was Tony’s shocked face.
Steve was about to ask what the workshop was but was cut off
After a few people were gone it was finally Steve’s turn.
“And who is this delightful creature?” the sleazy business man asked.
Steve felt like he was holding his breath till he got out of stark tower. He bend down and held on to his knees and willed away the urge to cry and slowly breathed in the mildly cold night air letting it calm his hammering heart. Steve jolted upright when a hand gently touched his shoulders.
Please excuse the court proceedings. I changed them dramatically for the sake of the story.
Everything was going Tony level smooth until the genius hacked into the system and revealed the videos of people trying to recreate the armor and all hell broke loose. Once again Tony proved that he was the smartest person in the room or may be ten rooms together.  Steve gave a fond eye roll at the TV and switched it off. His phone ringed seconds later.
Halfway there he could smell someone cooking bacon; it was probably Steve (hopefully Steve).
“Well I wouldn’t want your pretty little head to worry over that” Tony chucked and really that was a nice sound. Steve blinked and looked up only to see the other man looking down back at him, his honey brown eyes fixed on the blonds’, sparkling and intense. They were standing too close, close enough that Steve’s folded arms were brushing Tony’s t-shirt and could feel the faint wisp of exhale on his face, could count the golden flecks scattered across his brown irises.
“If you want to you can pay us with all the money you make” Sam added with a wink and went back to get the bottles of beer from the kitchen.
“Abomination” the other man whispered to Steve, practically throwing him away and briskly walked off. Steve stumbled back and walked towards Sam.
He finished up everything by five and went up to get ready. Steve was chatting animatedly with Happy when Tony got down to the living room.
Tony was out of the car and by Steve’s side in seconds “Hey hey ……it was a mistake, no need to call names” he was desperately trying to pry the man’s hands away from Steve’s collar.
"Have you at least tried asking them, see if they like you back" Steve sounded almost disappointed and sad.
“That’s Dum-E, don’t mind him he’s like that to visitors, we don’t have many” Tony chuckled.
"What? Of course not, I'm bi, I thought you knew" Steve crossed his arms across his chest his expression was unreadable.
Tony was livid judging from the muffled screams of phone conversations Steve could hear from the other room. As much as he could tell the complaint they filed with the Monacan police wasn’t getting anywhere as Hammer and his lackeys had already fled the continent. They would move it to the US jurisdiction. For the first time in his life Steve didn’t feel like fighting. He just wanted to run away and hide.
Only a few more chapters to go.
“This has something to do with Iron man doesn’t it?” Steve sounded or tried to sound equally intimidating. Now Steve is no dumb bunny; a government official, be it an agency he had never heard before that wants an outsider to spy on someone as important as Tony Stark was no laughing matter. Either they are that desperate or this is all an elaborate joke. But with the uproar going on about the Iron man armor he had guessed it had something to do with that itself.
Steve placed a plate of pancakes, bacon (and other unimportant stuff according to Tony) and more coffee before him “Eat” and Tony didn’t need to be told twice.
“No it isn’t” his voiced a little in panic and that seemed to get Tony’s attention. “I appreciate your help but Greg is an asshole and I didn’t want you to be exposed to someone like him”
"Okay....Natasha"
“Take a deep breath” she mimicked a long hard breath. “Now tell me what happened”
Tony plastered on a fake smile mid scowl and turned towards Steve only giving the blond a short nod “Nice to meet you Mr. Rogers, now I need a drink” he turned to look back to pepper with an angry smile ignoring Steve’s out stretched hand and just walked away. Pepper just sighed and shook her head.
Tony lost all interest to work so he went to bed instead. He was too exhausted lately a symptom he failed to pick up.
The other man chuckled while walking around, which Tony had to admit, made him look even more menacing “No no. I remember you wanted to do everything yourself. How is that working out for you?”
“His lawyer had stated that Vanko would present himself directly at the court and I want you to talk to yours as soon as possible Steve. Athira is one of the best” Tony said in a matter of fact way.
So maybe, Tony stark did fall in love a lot of times that too with people who never loved him back but not this time. Not this time.
Before the serum; when he was a scrawny kid in Brooklyn, suffering from every disease in the book, he never had the time to fall in love. Besides he actively squished budding crushes because unlike pneumonia or scarlet fever, Hanahaki can be controlled and no one would want a perpetually sick kid back therefore he would most probably die.
Tony was watching the whole exchange from the behind the bar, eyes on the blond the entire time. There was nothing remarkable about the blond if you didn’t consider the wingless part but that was more alarming than remarkable. Tony was in no way religious; heck he wouldn’t be caught dead praying to a god of any kind, he wasn’t philosophical either. He was the last person on earth to believe that all that wings were somehow connected to souls bullshit. It had nothing to do with his current predicament either, he used to scoff at those pseudo-scientific theories even before Afghanistan.
It was all his fault.
shall by our lusty brimmers thrive.
Okay, Oh boy this was bad "None of your business Rogers" yup the last straw. Steve's eyes were glazed over now. Tony had to get out before he had to witness the dreadful sight of Steve crying. His heart is already too fragile, so he bolts out of the room.
he totters, pale as any ghost,
Steve raised an eye brow at his rambling but had a soft smile on his face.
In the flush of love's light
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He could hear someone follow him and knew it was his best friend due to the telltale sound of a wing dragging along the floor.
“No its fine. Stubborn as a mule remember” He tried to smile which came out more like a grimace.
The poem in the summary is from The country girl by W.Wordsworth. It just reminds me of Steve.
why in the world would you go for Hammer tech”
and looking down, he spies.
It looks like i'm always apologizing for delays but sorry again.
“Yeah, I’m done” he replied, a little breathless.
“Running new data set. Might I also add that Miss Potts has been waiting to be let in for the past seven minutes, sir” the disembodied British voice informed.
“Then come on, let’s go”
Tony fell back on the bed tugging Steve with him and Steve for the glutton he his curled up beside him and started running his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“No you can go back to your borough or whatever” Tony was already at the bar and had poured himself a drink. Rogers stood by the door and eyed the glass distastefully but didn’t say anything. He gave a curt nod and left. And suddenly just like that the need for a drink left Tony.
He felt guilty as soon as the words left his mouth but was too stubborn to take back it back or apologize or even spare Stark a glance. Tony’s outburst opened up a ton of his insecurities that he tried hard every day to bury deep, about his appearance, lack of wings and a million other things. He felt a familiar prickling in his eyes, God he was about to cry
“Change the calibrations and run that again J” Tony was deep in the insides of a brand new engine in his famous workshop. Well he had one in every house he owned, it just varied in size from house to house.
“If I may interrupt, Sir has arranged for a celebratory dinner tonight for everyone, Colonel Rhodes has also been informed” Jarvis announced.
The art work was done half by my sister and half by me. Hope you guys enjoyed it :D
“Are we really going to be driving all the way to DC?” Steve beat him to it and asked, not really looking at Tony.
“That’s the plan” he gave the blond one of his charming press smiles.
I'm extremely sorry about these erratic updates but I'm trying by best to not be the master procrastinator that i am. Thank you lovely people for the kudos and sorry for the mistakes. Enjoy.
“I have no doubt about that” he smiled and looked down at his shoes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What can I for you Rogers?” he asked without turning around. There was a shuffle and crinkle of something plastic behind him.
"Oh" once again hurt flashed across Steve's face but he quickly set his jaws straight; now all captain America, all closed off. Tony felt something like his heart breaking at that. Because the universe hates him he was thrown into a coughing fit and kneeled on the floor. He couldn't control the petals leaking out of his mouth, camellias with a bit of blood around their edges. He knew they meant longing and couldn't help but smile at that. Steve was beside him in an instant, before he could ask anything Tony picked up the petals and tried to dash across the room but Steve got a hold of his arm before he could escape.
Before he could even blink Tony grabbed the other man by his shirt and slammed him into the wall “Listen here you shit. If you ever go near Steve or any of his friends, if you ever so much as breathe near him I will fucking blow your brains out understand? And don’t even bother going to anyone with this. I will sick every lawyer I can get on you so that you’ll be begging on the streets by the end of it. Are we clear?”
Hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
She just rolled her eyes. “Fine, go have lunch I’ll deal with this disaster. God knows how much the stocks are going to go down” The last parts were more of a mumble as she turned and walked off.
The other man walked away from the window and started making another cup anyway. “Sam and I had a bit of a misunderstanding but don’t worry he will be here in an hour to pick us up”
“Alright, I will be around more often and I want to keep at it and tell me the second you spot something ok? Can I trust you on that Steve?
“What do you want?” Steve asked without opening his eyes.
“Wait Steve Rogers? Who is …….” He turned in her hold to look up at the small stamp size photo of one Mr. Steven Grant Rogers that appeared on the screen. ”what the heck pep! I want the girl; she was perfect, what does this kid have that she doesn’t?” The man staring back at him from the image was just an average looking blond who looked point two seconds away from dying from starvation. With an annoyed huff he let himself be dragged back in the elevator. The genius kept whining about it like a petulant toddler until they reached the penthouse. Pepper just rolled her eyes and ignored him.
Tony Stark he saw in the papers and TV although infinitely more handsome in person.
And Steve makes an observation.
And Steve nodded.
Tony looked like a deer caught in headlights for a few moments, when he shook out of it his eyes were alight with new life and he lunged on to Steve, kissing him and muttering “I love yous” with an ever increasing fervor. Had to be true, he couldn’t feel that ever-present soreness in his throat anymore.
Tony Stark was officially  the most infuriating man Steve had ever known. He didn’t even know how to respond to the thousands of dollars spend on him.
The workshop was littered with molted black feathers, a premonition of what was just around the corner for him. But he didn’t want to think about it because his heart was in a million pieces and every last one of those pieces ached for Steve.
He shouldn’t have gone out alone into that empty hallway. He shouldn’t have strayed far from the crowds. He shouldn’t have gone to Monaco. He shouldn’t have been born at all.
He was snapped out of his reverie when Miss Potts started taking “This is the penthouse, you’ll probably be working mostly here and the floor below is the work shop”
Tony’s treacherous heart broke at that. He wanted Steve to stay by his side as selfish as it was but-
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony curled up on his lap on the workshop floor exchanging lazy kisses was not how Steve imagined this day would go and he had Nat to thank for that or maybe not, he should be yelling at her for not telling him sooner but then again its Natasha, irking her would be like signing your own death sentence so he decided he would just let it go for now. Besides they had so much to talk about, not right now but soon. Now he is just going to enjoy this moment and also think about the fact that they were both huge idiots.
“How far are we from DC?”
This is a relatively short chapter. Hope you guys enjoy.
“Oh……His wings got broken on the last tour” Steve said, his blue eyes intense on Tony’s. The moving neon lights from the sign boards sparkled off of them.
Steve raised his head to look up and saw Tony’s face staring back and his heart started beating so fast Steve almost thought it had malfunctioned.
Steve was about to reach a hand out to touch when Tony turned to him with an indignant expression.
He placed the tools back on the table and opened up the folder containing Steve’s file and sat there staring at the man’s images. There was nothing strikingly gorgeous about the blond. Just an average man but if you look closer you could see sparkling blue eyes that oozed stubbornness and determination; silky blond hair that makes you want to run your hands through them and a sharp jaw that would probably feel great to trace with a thumb. Hell Tony had been in close association with super models and movie stars but none of them had shy innocent smiles or a quick wit or keen observation skills as Steve and more importantly none of them could be like Steve. He clearly had a type.
All accidents of time and place.
“-ark….Tony, listen to me. It’s Steve Rogers, your PA. We are in Malibu we are safe. You just had a nightmare. You’re alright Tony, just breathe. In and out like this……yeah”
Steve Rogers was a hopeless romantic.
“My assistant will.....well uh assist you with that, Steve” Tony called to him barely looking in the blonds general direction.
“The truth is……..I am Ironman”
“You know what, do a search JARVIS and see if it correlates with anything” he ordered to the AI.
“If you guys are done, can we Sam?”
Their conversations so far mostly revolved around the case and other times on rather mundane things. Steve was ready to do anything to go back to how they were used to be.
The smirk stayed as if that was the exact answer the man was expecting “Now Mr. Rogers I wouldn’t be here if this wasn’t of utmost importance. Believe it not we do not mean any harm to Mr. Stark but the opposite” the director was staring at the small figurines on the table as if they personally offended him.
So taught, so trained, we boldly face
She was a little bit offended at first but one look at Stark and she knew why Pepper chose Steve and from a few hours with Steve she knew why he was the right choice.
By the looks of it they were going on an impromptu road trip.
By the time Steve realized it had been twenty four hours since he left Stark tower they had managed to find quite a few things that belonged to Tony’s father.
“If i tell you the details I’d have to kill you but I am offering decent remuneration if the job is well done” the man replied with a straight face which did nothing to ease Steve’s nerves.
“Well they were the only ones affordable so” Steve shrugged.
“I have run simulations on every known element and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core, you’re running out of both time and options”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before Steve could say anything the man was at the threshold.“There is something big coming and he’s going to need all the help he can get so I urge you to think about it Mr. Rogers” and the man just about vanished into thin air.
Steve knew that was the most Bucky was going to put out there as a sign of approval so he smiled a little and reached across the counter to grab the other man’s hand and managed to give it a gentle squeeze “Thank you”
He was shook awake by a very enthusiastic Bucky (in Steve’s personal opinion
"No and you don't get to say that" Tony tried his usual dismissive tone. Steve should leave now, his throat was at it again.
"What if he likes you back Tony" She sounded soft now.
Tony Stark never got jealous.
Tony closed his eyes and breathed in slowly, maybe it was time to accept his fate. The chances of him coming out of this alive were getting lower by the minute.
Thank you guys again for the kudos and comments, they are my motivation.
“Tomorrow…… you can answer that tomorrow. Right now you are going straight to bed” and Tony felt like he could kiss Steve again but nodded and allowed himself to be dragged towards the bedroom instead.
“I think you hurt his feelings” Steve walked back to gently pat the bot on its metaphorical head and giggled when Dum-E gave a happy chirp.
“Wait. you and Steve. Did you lie to him as well?”
An early update to make ya'll a bit happy. Thank you again for the comments and kudos, i cant say this enough.
"Ah" Steve gave a knowing nod and sat back in beside tony while handing him a cup "couldn't sleep" he whispered as of an answer to Tony's earlier inquiry.
“I just wanted to be nice for once sourpuss” Tony said with an eye roll.
“Fine” he sighed.
“You should talk to him” ahh Nat, never one for pleasantries. She sounded urgent and a bit worried though.
“Gotta hand it to you Rogers, you’re a new record” Tony said to his PA while going through some of the final preparations for Stark expo on the evening of the fifth day. For a man whose stubbornness could rival Tony’s and is too honest for his own good, Steve had somehow held on.
“That wouldn’t be a good idea right now. He needs some space. Do ask him but another time” she touched his arm and gave a slight nod.
we dare be brave
Sam grabbed her shoulders before he could slip out the door “Care to explain what you are doing with Steve before you go”
“This is about Tony, I want to help. I’m the only one who knows about this” Steve said with a stubborn tilt of his chin.
“How may I assist you Mr. Rogers?” It was a little unnerving to hear voices with no person in sight.
Then he met Peggy and love was not exactly unrequited, but everything went to hell when he decided to take a plunge in the Arctic. Everybody knows that story but what no one knows is that since waking up and finding something to live for in the 21st century, Steve Rogers actually managed to fall in love again.
“Umm…..you can take these back I guess”
“JARVIS, Has Steve come back?”
Hope you guys enjoy. Love your comments.
this eternal bliss.
Steve just nodded his head and went back to staring out into the darkness. In less than ten minutes they were at the deli. Steve took out his phone and started dialing while Tony went to get the food. He caught the tail end of the conversation when he came back.
“You know he sure wont and god help me, I care about him” Something in the man’s voice made it sound sincere to Steve. It’s not like they were asking for company secrets or anything. He knew something was going on and if his employer was too stubborn to ask or help, even though he was still conflicted maybe he could.
a faith, a trust, that could not be betray'd.
"Security breach" Tony stated while throwing his hands in the air.
The next morning Tony woke up feeling not good but rested somehow. He absentmindedly reached out next to him but his hands only touched air and that’s when the realization hit him.
“Yeah” Tony replied his eyes still fixed on the floor.
This, if he allowed his mind to think about further must the most dangerous thing he has ever done. It was so far from any kind of acceptable behavior for a PA. But he was not going to go that way. Right now he was willing to take this little moment he got with Tony, any ramifications can be dealt with tomorrow.
He felt stuffy inside the room with all these rich people milling around and stepped out into the hallway which looked deserted. Steve walked up to the base of the stairs trying to get to the balcony when someone grabbed his hand from behind.
“Steve I know he can be a little overbearing at times but I assure you he is a good man”
He placed the reactor back in and took in a deep long breath. Before Tony could answer Steve grabbed him by the arms and gently hoisted him up.
Enjoy!
“Thank you” he said in a shaky voice and somehow Tony knew Steve understood that it was for both last night and breakfast.
Everything that happened later transpired faster than Steve could process, one minute Tony was gasping for air the other he was pulling something out (which was fuming by the way) of his chest and Steve was panicking to do anything to help.
“Your friend is not here yet” came a gruff voice from the corner.
Steve averted his eyes first. He could feel telltale burn of a blush creeping up his cheeks and silently prayed to all the gods he knew that the other man wouldn’t see it.
Well i did warn about drama. :/
To his surprise Steve looked un-phased till Tony took out the core which was smoking.
Steve just rolled his eyes at them “go ahead and get the car Sam, I’ll come down in a minute”
“Thank you for the dinner Tony, it was nice”
Tony Stark never fell in love.
At this rate the number of chapters might exceed my predictions but i assure you that i know how i want this story to go so don't worry we'll get there. Did i mention that this was a slow burn?
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve was proud that he didn’t jump this time “Director, how did you get in?”
“Tony” that was Happy being unnecessarily loud. They both sprang apart as if tazed and stared at the intruder.
He said out loud into the empty room. What would’ve happened if Happy hadn’t come at that moment. Would they hav- No, he shouldn’t be thinking things like this. Tony was his boss, more than that he was a notorious playboy. He was just  stressed with everything that happened that’s all this is.
The blond was silent after that; behaving like an actual paid employee would, straight to the point and uncaring about their boss’s feelings. Tony would be lying if he said that he didn’t miss their usual friendly banter but this was for Steve’s own good.
“Mr. Stark you do realize that this the hearing of an alleged criminal assault that too of your own employee right?” The judge asked in mild anger.
“Nah, I’ll take the ferry or the subway. See you in the evening?"
There was a lull in the conversation where the two of them were simply grinning looking at each other. Something about the whole thing felt so profound to Steve, like seeing a rare miracle or like something that shouldn’t be happening is somehow happening. Something quite unexplainable.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you alright Mr-umm….Tony?”
“Yeah, he was my first attempt at an AI. Built him when I was fifteen or something, didn’t turn out quite well though” he replied lowering his gaze when Howard’s unimpressed face popped up in his memories.
Tony looked like someone who bit into a lemon. He didn’t want to fight with the inventor anymore so Steve just let it go and busied himself with work instead.
“Yeah, of course”
“oh…..no…..Mr. St-Tony I can’t possibly- Steve started to stutter out but Tony cut him off before he could finish.
He admired Tony’s hands, they created some of the most wonderful things Steve had even seen, they had saved countless lives and most of all he loved how they felt against his own. But later in life he found out that what he loved more than Tony’s calloused hands were his chapped lips.
As much as he was worried he trusted Nat’s judgment so he was going to let it go for now besides, Steve Rogers was a gentleman, he would always respect other people’s choices as long as they were not super villains.
“Seriously Steve it’s no problem at all. The suit can lift about a hundred tons but I am working on improving that so lifting you would be like what, a bunch of grapes” he smirked.
No that can’t be, he was hiding everything surprisingly well and his symptoms were pretty mild all thanks to the serum. He would still cough up petals but it was rare and dispersed.
“No sugar plum, of course not. If you guys are done disciplining me I have places to be” He almost turned before Rhodey caught a hold of his collar and stopped him.
“I don’t like wasting food but still don’t think I can take all of these Mr. Stark” Steve was shifting on the balls of feet now, unsure where to look.
“Yeah” he prayed that it didn’t sound as broken as it did to his own ears.
And also can you see the italics on phones? I can't
“You could come along if you like Ms. Rushman.  A little R and R in Monaco”
“Its fine mam” Steve replied with what he thought would be polite smile but would probably have looked more like a grimace.
It felt nice, no really really good being held by Steve and he indulged himself and wanted to keep it for a little bit more. Tomorrow, tomorrow they could go back to being whatever they were but right now he just wanted to sleep luxuriating in the warmth radiated by this amazing person next to him.
Steve lowered Tony to the bed and covered him a blanket almost mechanically then with a final glance from the doorway, left him alone instead as if he was in a hurry to get away.
the longing look alone on you.
Steve blushed furiously and stammered out a series of noes.
“A complete hematologic examination is required to ascertain your profound hypothesis sir” JARVIS replied in an odd mixture of worry and sarcasm.
Steve was standing with Tony near the bar while the other man was getting a drink. He wasn’t paying much attention and when he turned around the genius was staring at him.
It was difficult to even believe that the man he just saw was THE Tony stark. He was dressed in an unmistakably old band t-shirt and jeans that had streaks of what he presumed to be motor oil or something. Steve was not going to judge other peoples clothing choices; it was their home after all but what irked him was the blatant disregard of the genius toward Steve. He didn’t even have the common courtesy to shake Steve’s hands; it was like he didn’t even care, it was like Steve didn’t even exist.
Guys I'm sorry if there are mistakes or missing words, I'm wayyy to lazy at this point to scrutinize but i am trying my best not to  let you down. Thank you again for the kudos and comment (made my day).
Oh god. He and Steve had slept together. He sat up in a flash, hands going to his chest immediately. The reactor was covered, there was no way Steve could’ve seen it but……..but his wings. He had the prosthesis off last night. Steve must’ve been disgusted by them.
“First of all stop calling me Mr. Stark. Mr. Stark was my dad and it kinda gives me the heebie jeebies sometimes so call me Tony. Second of all at least keep the suit for the expo?” Tony was surprised by the hopefulness in his own voice.
Loud, obnoxious, arrogant, jerk….……….…secretly kind, compassionate, genius, beautiful and wonderful man that is Tony Stark. His best friend from the future.
Steve was honestly surprised by the question “No, everything’s fine really”
“I can see now why you got it” the man was pointedly looking at Steve’s lack of wings. “Any way, I want you to spy on Tony Stark for me Mr. Rogers” he said with the most serious tone possible for a human being.
Tony dragged himself out of the workshop to the bedroom and fell face first onto his bed. He was dead tired but sleep seems to hate him for some matter. He thought back on Steve Rogers, the man was probably looking for all of Tony’s flaws or maybe just maybe he was a good observer?  Rogers was an artist after all. In the end Tony decided to cut the man some slack if he showed up tomorrow that is. That seemed to put his mind at ease and he slipped into a blissful sleep hopefully devoid of nightmares.
“I helped with some paper work” Steve waved a hand in the air as if the person on opposite end could see him. Technically Tony could’ve just done that himself but Steve wanted to believe this whole thing of him being there had a purpose.
“Why don’t we get some dinner first?” Nat suggested.
The man opposite him smiled back. They sat there talking for some more time until the blond said “You wanna get outa here?”
The look on Steve’s face seemed to answer for the man “All I want you to do is simply call for help when he needs it”
“It was Mr. Rogers sir”
Tony didn’t feel like suggesting otherwise so he just nodded and moved to sit down. He didn’t know how much time had passed until he had sat there staring at the wall. Perhaps a few hours, perhaps seconds or perhaps an eternity. It stopped being relevant a long time ago.
“To my house in Malibu, we’ve got things to do” Tony somewhat succeeded in hiding the mild astonishment in his voice.
There was hesitation written across Tony’s eyes and Steve could only see a man terrified of falling in love and not the playboy everyone insisted he was. Steve felt a bit courageous and leaned in, barely anything really and Tony’s eyes widened. He could see the exact moment the switch flipped inside the genius and in the next they were kissing.
He beat himself up over for that little incident up until he got back to his apartment. Steve was so out of it, he missed the front door being unlocked and walked right into a dark living room.
Steve wanted to sigh into it; he wanted to scream ‘Finally’ from the top of his lungs because that was what it felt like. He knew nothing in his life can ever compare to the moment he first kissed Tony stark.
“I told you before; I don’t wanna join your super secret boy band”
“Alright Steve, deal”
“Yeah I did” Steve replied with a playful eye roll.
I am really sorry for not posting anything for the last month. I hit a huge writers block and also got covid. so that happened. Not a good experience. A zero out of ten. would not recommend.
Surprisingly or not so surprisingly the man did show up the next day but seemed to have a permanent scowl on his face. It abated a little as time went and as Tony toned down his assholey-ness. The blond proved to be quite efficient at his job and at calling out on Tony’s bullshit just like pepper. So Tony retracted from his decision to fight pepper and maybe buy her a new pair of shoes or maybe ten instead.
“Buck….uhh James is my Best friend, we share an apartment together”
His best friend was a little bit surprised and a lot more worried at the news but Steve insisted he was fine. The call led Tony and him to talk about the best friend in question which in turn led to a discussion on the man’s wings.
With a sigh he walked up to the receptionist and asked where the interview was conducted. She eyed him top to bottom for a few seconds with visible distaste on her face and with obvious fake politeness gave him the instructions.
“Steve I need to make a call. Don’t worry we can help him”
Then Steve turned his head and was looking up at him with such open adoration in his eyes that Tony found it impossible to look away. His face moved closer on its own volition and he felt Steve’s hands wound around his neck tighten in response. It wouldn’t take much to close the remaining few inches between them and oh how badly he wanted to do that.
She was a bit taken aback and stared at Steve from behind her cup for a few seconds.
“Enjoy your trip Mr. Stark. Steve.” she turned and gave him a small nod and walked out of the office.
“I’m a shield shadow. Once we knew something was wrong I was tasked to you by Director Fury”
“J bring up file no.99” An image of the aforementioned file glowed across the white wall.
“Sir has ordered lunch; it would be appreciated if you are kind enough to get it for him Mr. Rogers” the AI sounded almost apologetic unlike his rude ass creator.
He was a little irritated to watch the flirtatious banter Tony had going on with the woman, Marshal? Michelle? Doesn’t matter. It was all fun and games until she extended a subpoena in Tony’s direction. The billionaire was rubbing his fore head with two fingers not knowing what to do so Steve decided to take it out of her hand.
So yeah Steve Rogers was a hopeless romantic so what? it was okay to be this time. This time he wasn't hopeless, he was loved right back.
“Steve? When did it become Steve” Tony asked with a half amused smile. “And what is he doing down here?” he wiped his hands on a rag rather than his jeans this time and adjusted his unruly hair. He was wearing a ratty old jeans and an equally old band shirt.
The front door opened as Steve was about to reply and Sam walked in twirling the car keys on his fingers and a grin on his face. Sam crossed the room up to Bucky and kissed him, his big brown wings twisting out to surround the other man. His best friend was smiling like an idiot and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little jealous. Those two were adorable together and all he could hope was maybe one day……. He pushed those thoughts down for another day and cleared his throat trying to sound annoyed.
Steve must’ve been blushing furiously as Happy took pity on him and only did what he was told. Once again Steve was left alone with his thoughts.
After what felt like an eternity (a few seconds, really) he turned around and walked back to the couch and plopped down with an audible huff to try and calm down.
He nodded immediately because this woman who was only as tall as Steve was far scarier than eye patch guy.
Steve knew he messed up big time when he saw Tony’s crestfallen face as he drove away. Well you see Steve was used to these little fist fights with Greg, the man was scum and really enjoyed beating him up but this time he didn’t want Tony to see that. There was no telling what Greg would do if he realized it was Tony Stark. He didn’t want Tony to deal with that on account of him and with all these people with phones walking about, it really wasn’t worth it.
“Yes mam”
. He simply lay there in his huge expensive bed alone. The thing is he didn’t mean it, not even a single word. It was like a reflex, like a knee jerk reaction that he does whenever it feels like he put too much of himself out there but didn’t intent to. It was one of those moments; Steve was being terribly endearing, he had proven to be one of the most amazing people Tony had ever seen so how could he not want that.
Ever since the blood work came back with the news of palladium poisoning JARVIS had been nagging him to take those awful green smoothies that can theoretically chelate the ions. Well he couldn’t blame JARVIS exactly because he himself refused to go within ten feet of a doctor.
Steve could see Tony’s expressions change from seething to deranged at the onslaught of accusations. To top it off they also introduced a new witness (which Steve knew was entirely false) that claimed he saw everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
Vain love, why do'st thou boast o wings
“Tony whatever is going on. I want you to figure it out like a rational human being and take care of your wings; they look like shit……Look man I gotta go. Promise me you’ll call later?”
“No sir he hasn’t come back to the tower yet?” JARVIS replied in an apologetic tone.
Her face fell and Tony realized it might be for an entirely different reason.
Tony blinked up to Stare at his PA who looked back with a gentle smile.
but you came and gave me all of the universe
“Steve?”
The other man seemed to have sensed the shift in Steve’s mood. “You know what I mean. Why take you along in the first place” His friend said more like a statement than a question.
A thousand insecurities came flooding back into his mind. There were times people refused to touch or even be near Steve. Most of them were the traditionalists among the people whom he and his mom went to church with. Once they had known that he was born without wings, they had called him the devil’s spawn. He never went to church after that. The kids were worse, they would beat him up in alley ways; calling him rude names.
Tony laughed half hysteric half ‘why did I program my AI like this’ and that was the exact moment one of his bots chose to mess up the counter.
Steve woke up that morning with the dreadful feeling that this day will not turn out to be good. He walked into the kitchen to see his best friend holding a cup of coffee and staring outside the window.
‘Was it her idea?’
Steve was there near the stove, softly humming an unfamiliar tune and flipping pancakes on the pan. The sunlight was reflecting off the marble counter tops to cast a soft glow on his face and golden rays illuminated him from behind, glinting on his soft blond locks.
the moment our lips touch.
“They are way too expensive Mr. Stark and I’m fine with what I have”
Steve just shrugged and followed the billionaire. He really should be used to this by now. Happy was doing an odd thing with his face which looked like a smirk/smile/leer but not quite. Tony was deliberately not paying attention to his driver.
“Uhh….no Hammer I believe”
“I’m at the Ritz actually” Steve said unable to contain the glee in his voice.
Your hands are bloody from fighting for our love, don't worry I'll fix them up every time.
“Uhh….yes of cour-“ he didn’t get to finish that sentence as the whole weight of an ex-soldier slammed onto him. It took the genius a full second to realize that he was actually being hugged.
“Your honor as you can see my client is falsely accused. In fact it was Mr. Rogers who approached him. All Mr. Vanko did was reciprocate. He didn’t know there was such malicious intent associated with it”
The brunette was about to give up when he heard muffled screams from somewhere. He followed the noises and almost fell over from what he saw.
He was trying really hard but miserably failing to focus on a sketch he was working on when Natasha walked into his room.
“We need to get this to Tony” Steve tried to protest blinking sleep out of his eyes.
"Yeah sure why not" he settled on the couch Steve was previously curled up in "Ran out of coffee"
Tony was in the common room watching the good captain prepare breakfast for the whole team. He couldn't help but stare at the way he was being so soft and gentle with everyone and everything, a complete contrast to the captain in the field. Well you can't blame tony really, who in their right mind would wake up at five in the morning, go for a run, punch some poor bags to oblivion and walk into the kitchen all ruffled and cute and hand tony his cup of coffee with a smile on their face. Oh don't even get him started on that goddamn smile. So yeah he was staring hopelessly at Steve when something pricked at his throat and he had to jump up and run to the workshop before someone noticed him throwing up goddamn sunflower petals.
I am so so so sorry for not uploading for the past two weeks.
Enjoy!
Steve just smiled and slid out the door. He walked down the hallway chanting ‘it’s gonna be fine’ like a prayer until he collided with something and looked up to see Greg from downstairs eyeing Steve like he egged his car or something.
When he woke up which was really late than usual, a full assortment of their signature Georgetown breakfast and new clothes had been waiting for him courtesy of one Tony Stark. Steve was getting that familiar prickly feeling he gets when someone spends too much money on him but he wasn’t going to let perfectly good food go to waste.
Steve sat on a plush sofa near the ceiling to floor windows of the gym looking through paper work and also secretly watching Stark and Happy exchange blows inside the ring when Pepper walked in announcing the arrival of the notary.
“There is an arc reactor on Tony’s chest and it’s killing him” and the tears started falling because in that moment he felt utterly helpless.
I'm so sorry this took so much time, sleep deprived science researcher here and my PC was giving me a hard time. This chapter is a Steve POV nobody asked for but I'm giving you nonetheless so please enjoy. once again kudos and comments are much appreciated.
‘Is Mr. Stark paying you for this?’
They decided to watch a movie after dinner.  He was still confused about his new employer but left that little dilemma for future Steve to figure out. He looked over at the other end of the couch where his best friend cuddled with the man’s boyfriend, wings and limbs entangled.
Steve moved around a little, catching the light in some angles and that’s when Tony noticed, something behind him, something that looked like faraway galaxies and nebulae and stars. Like the whole universe in brilliant purples and reds and blues. Something that vaguely looked like wings that stretched and blended into the infinite cosmos. It was there one moment and gone the next as if it were an optical illusion that came and let with the change in light. It was the most profoundly beautiful thing he has ever seen.
He was caught up in his own mind when Lydia came up. She was polite enough and explained about everything Steve had to do. She gave him an ID and a stark-tab equipped with the things he would need.
Tony smirked at that “You know what J; do send him a fruit basket and a new suit he’s coming with me to the expo, no thank you notes though. Keep going with the protocol”
It was a cycle of self -loathing that kept him staring blankly at the nearest wall. A lot of people have had worse happen to them, he should be thankful that this wasn’t like that, he tried telling himself but that didn’t mean it had rattled him to his core.
“Scan and get me a visual J” he said turning around and sitting back down on his chair more annoyed than before.
He should add it to the list of things to do when he gets back.
Breathing was getting harder. Tony was chanting
Or is it?
“If you need anything please don’t call me” he blurted out and practically jumped into the elevator and left the dumbfound assistant to stare after him.
Tony definitely took it in the wrong sense and Steve had to explain the 'he-is-bi thing' again because apparently the last time he told everyone Tony was actually drunk out of his mind, didn’t hear anything and simply nodded along just like Steve suspected. That was about the time the self-deprecating statement from Tony’s earlier reply registered in the blonds mind.
To their great surprise Fury was not against Steve joining them. He had already filled in everything he knew to the scientific team and they had immediately started working on a temporary neutralizer.
Her smile turned a little smug at that “Oh no he needs you now more than ever. There are a lot of procedures to be done and it takes a lot of time”
“I’ll be fine. Let’s just get this over with”
“Tony what’s wrong?” his best friend’s concerned voiced echoed through the penthouse as soon as the call connected.
“I’ll be here tomorrow morning” he said instead and walked out of the apartment furiously wiping at his cheeks.
Sorry if there are any mistakes and i love hearing from you guys and also am immensely happy that people are inspired by this story to make their own art. Thank you guys.
When everyone settled down Steve looked among the people deliberately avoiding the other side that seemed to have a lot more people than necessary. Natasha was there. Pepper couldn’t make it as she was currently on the other side of the planet. But the person the really wanted beside him was nowhere to be seen.
Jealousy flared up in his gut which he found pretty surprising. Oh who was he kidding he had a ginormous crush on Stark. There was no point in denying it or scooping it under the rug marking it as confusion anymore.
our friendships with our charity;
When such quick flames suspicion brings,
“Thank you again Tony, It was a great trip”
“The interview…….uh……everyone that came had some kind of problem and your right wing looks slightly off somehow” he answered a bit scared.
Tony opened his mouth in surprise and placed a hand over his chest as if Steve personally offended him “No wonder he’s in pain Steve you’re using subpar equipment. I mean seriously we offer superior everything and you work with me Steve
“I bet he takes all his assistants to expensive hotels” his best friend said trying to make him feel better. Steve knew Bucky was just trying to make it sound like a normal Tony thing but it immediately ruined Steve’s mood for some reason.
Greg was about to yell some more when Sam came back up “you okay Steve?”
WARNING: Guys i don't know if you've noticed i have changed the rating to mature. There is a small noncon/abuse scene (not Tony) and i don't want anyone to be triggered. I have put asterisks (**) at the beginning and end of the paragraph. just avoid it or don't read this chapter at all. I care about you and i want you to be safe.
“Yeah I have a peeve” there was a tinge of surprise in Tony’s voice which was aimed at Steve that made him feel smug somehow.
Tony’s face fell instantly and muttered a vague ‘yeah’.
As the years progressed his creations got better and better along with the number of gashes, cuts and burns on his hands. One Afghanistan, Iron man and Avengers later they were no longer white scars they were calloused. He didn’t mind it at first, if anything it was an advantage. He couldn’t even feel the new accidents happen most of the time.
It was evening by the time they got to Steve’s apartment in Brooklyn. The sun was almost gone. When they reached the front of the apartment Steve turned to him and smiled. It was one of those loopy smiles Tony liked.
So i just realized all the events in the chapters so far happens in one day so this fic will probably have more than 10 chapters, sorry. And also fair warning: you guys can expect a lot of drama in the coming chapters (like soap opera levels of drama).
Meet me at that place where you don't have to be anyone else but you.
“Employee……of course. okay I’ll get ready” Steve replied with the blankest face he could conjure as if what Tony said didn’t faze him.
Steve was hurt, a few words from Tony were worse than years of rude comments from everyone he ever knew but he wasn’t going to let that get him down. It was clear from last night what Stark really thought, so he was going to be the PA and nothing more.
“Oh stop looking at me like you want to murder me in my sleep, Stark is not my type” she said as soon as they reached her car.
“What’s wrong? You didn’t like them? Are they not good? We can get new ones. J call happy, tell him to get a car ready, we are going to get Rogers new stuff”
She directed him to the couch on the living room and handed him a glass of water that seemingly materialized out of thin air. He doesn’t have the time to gape at that.
“I thought I told you to take a few days off Steve”
“For?” Pepper squinted her eyes at him.
“Oh no, I don’t want to impose”
His best friend’s lips quirked into a small smirk and casually crossed his arms a sign for which Steve recognized to be ‘teasing the hell out of Steve time’ “oh I don’t know…….how about your boy who woke us up at five in the bloody morning and had been talking nonstop about you and only you for the past four hours”.
“ugh Fine Nat……..but I need to see Tony first”
Greg from downstairs the bane of Steve’s existence was an older, larger man with dirty olive wings, ginger hair and a bad temper and more importantly, Greg was a bully.
Not a lot of people had access to his safe space but he couldn’t help be a little bit exited to show it to Steve. It was all worth it when he saw Steve’s gob smacked expression as they set foot inside the lab. Tony strode forward and commanded JARVIS to light up the display cases and Steve’s jaw hit the floor.
Thank you for the kind words, kudos and patience.
His best friend was sitting on the other side of the kitchen table nursing a cup of coffee with his black and white wings half draped on the chair and half on the floor.
She turned around and slipped into the elevator once again. Steve made sure she was gone and let out a long breath he didn’t realize he was holding. He sat down on one of the couches and felt somewhat relieved .
Just give me this,
Tony smiled wide inside the suit “much more comfortable for both of us. Ready?”
“Stay” he whispered, voice raspy from all the screaming and crying.
Steve gaped at her until it struck him. He smiled back.
(See the end of the chapter for
She only winked at that along with a smile
Before Tony could say anything Steve interrupted "Any one would be lucky to have you tony" He had one of those heart melting smiles on his face, the ones tony likes to think that was only for him.
"Sir Ms. Romanoff is requesting entrance"
“I suppose you would need better assistants” he knew he got the job because of Tony and if Pepper is CEO there would be no need for someone like him. May be someone with fancy degrees could takeover instead.
“Blood toxicity: twenty four percent. It appears that the continued use of the Iron man suit is accelerating your condition. The core has been depleted”
He wasn’t crying anymore instead he stared straight ahead with a dead gaze. Steve refused to look anywhere near Tony’s face while he helped the blonde up and removed the tie tied around his wrists.
“Tony what’s wrong? What’s happening?” Steve asked, looking a bit wrecked himself.
“I don’t know how to explain really but maybe I can show you” he answered while walking closer to Steve.
Okay so i added an OMC and didn't tag: Greg from downstairs but Greg from downstairs is an asshole so he doesn't count.
“Sorry I don’t recall but I promise I won’t forget you tonight” he said with a wink.
“Where’s your sense of adventure J” He took another swing of the bottle and got up.
Natalie (if that’s her real name) came around more often to discuss about both SI and spy business. She gave Steve pointers on what to look for and how to gather information which unnerved Steve because he was still a bit reluctant to spy on his employer.
He purposefully sat away from Tony but could see the man in the corner of his eyes. Everyone had a great time and was laughing at the silly things each of them shared. Steve noticed Tony lean back and watch everyone with a melancholy smile for a few seconds and then proceeded to tap on his glass to get their attention. The table went silent and everyone except Steve were eyeing the soon to be former CEO as if they should be ready to roll their eyes any second at what he is about to say.
“Sure” with that Sam rode off leaving Steve alone on the pavement to calm himself down once again. With a new found burst of courage he walked in through the door of stark tower.
“It’s just lunch” the brunette dismissed his friend not wanting to address the actual meaning of that question.
Instead of getting defensive, the barely there smirk on the other man got wider but it wasn’t to mock Steve.  To him it felt something strange like the man was almost proud of Steve or guessing it right.
as do the heart about the fire.
All credits goes to my very own sista for hand drawing this piece.
“I’ll just leave the rest in the penthouse”
"Come on Tony I- we can't lose you why can't you see that. Is the love for this person more important?"
“What’s the point of all this?” Steve asked while anxiously glancing at the clock. Bucky should be back by now.
I am genuinely sorry for the late update, got busy with a project. I'll try to finish the next chapter in the earliest.
“Are you alright Steve?”
Tony was in his office when they got back to the tower; his face broke into a brilliant smile when he saw them approach.
They sat across a table; Steve slumped on his chair and Nat a bit more relaxed than usual. Half way through the meal which Steve barely touched, Natasha spoke up again “Steve. What did Tony do?”
“I’ve always wanted to ask you. How does it feel?......to fly” he asked in a wistful voice.
He really had to stop doing this. Every time they take one step forward it seems they go two steps back. If it were any other person Steve would be so fired by now but then again if it were anyone else they wouldn’t be fighting like this in the first place.
“Tony this is Steve Rogers, Mr. Rogers this is Tony Stark as you might know” she said all calm and collected as if nothing happened.
let me seal it away
“The one and only” he answered with his signature smirk.
When Natasha took up the assignment of spying on Tony Stark, she thought it would turn to be the easiest job she had done, what with Mr. Stark’s particular lifestyle and interests  seducing him would be a piece of cake.
“Certainly Mr. Rogers, I am an artificial intelligence created by Mr. Stark to help him however required” The AI answered and wow Steve was certainly impressed. It sounded like something out of a sci-fi book or movie.
The other man gave a horrified nod and scrambled back up the stairs the second Tony let go. . It was misplaced anger but useful nonetheless and hopefully that would be the end of Greg from downstairs
His eyes would flick from the other persons horrified expression to his own hands, only to reply with “Huh look at that” before being pulled down to be cleaned up.
The other man let out a little laugh and placed his hands back on the table “that’s because they are mine punk; it’s not all bad, just get out there and try. We’ll celebrate even if you don’t get the job kay?”
He kept awake till he was sure that Tony’s breathing evened out and (because he was insane) kissed the brunet’s forehead before slowly letting sleep consume himself as well.
“So it’s a he” that sounded more like a sneer even to his ears and he winced before Tony’s eyes flicked up to meet him.
So i massacred the timeline but this an AU after all. Fair warning this is going to continue throughout, although i will stick to the general story line as much as possible.
During his time at MIT he collected several more, be it from caffeine powered binges or falling asleep with a blow torch. Rhodey always patched him up, complaining all the while about his recklessness. But whatever; he was young, he healed fast and his palms were soft like how a billionaire heirs should be. They were only slightly white scars tony could always ignore.
A full sized high definition image of himself came up on one of the holograms “It appears like your scapulars and marginal coverts have acquired a black hue that was previously not there before”
He came to a stop and just hovered over the bay looking at the lights.
He set both the card and envelope on the table and turned to get ready. Looks like this wasn’t going to be his day off after all.
Really sorry guys i got sucked into the whirlpool of BL dramas. And please excuse the mistakes or inaccuracies if any. I realize that the senate meeting might happen on a Sunday according to my timeline. If they don't please just roll with it.
“Did you see the hearing?” Bucky sounded like he was in the middle of laughing.
Erratic updates,i know and i'm sorry. I'm really happy that you guys are enjoying the story so far. I love hearing from you.
“Colonel Rhodes is on the line” JARVIS announced suddenly breaking him out of the revere.
In his haste to get away from anything that showed his vulnerability, Tony didn’t see the person walking towards him on the stairs and promptly collided with them.
“You were supposed to be at the interviews with me” she said with a small huff.
The blond immediately jumped off as soon as they landed for which Tony was thanking him silently in between gasps for air. He managed to snap the emergency release hatch and the armor fell to the floor in a loud clatter.
Steve jumped back and squinted his eyes to try and make out the dark figure supposedly sitting on the chair in the corner. Before he could say anything, the other man switched on the table lamp near him.
"Okay I admit I have it and No I'm not going to do anything about it" His voice almost sounded weak, almost.
It’s been three weeks two days and six hours since their last conversation, no he didn’t count he just has an eidetic memory okay, everyone in the tower can sense the tension this time and everyone were trying their best to get tony out and about. Even though Steve was heartbroken, he was worried about the genius. He was the one who recruited Rhodey and pepper to get tony out of his lab and may be tell them who he’s fallen for, that would be a very useful information so Steve could maybe punch some sense into them or something or maybe have a civil conversation or both. He didn’t tell them about Tony’s condition though, that was not his secret to tell, he wouldn’t even have known about it if it weren’t for Steve not sleeping through that fateful night.
“You think this is funny Tones?” His best friend cut in with a stern voice which only made Tony smirk more.
The sick men; let’s face it anyone who hurts innocent people in the name of anything are sick, they would pull out feather after feather while laughing hysterically like it’s some sort of amusing sport. It served the dual purpose of breaking his spirit and grounding him without a chance of any escape. But being the genius he is Tony invented a flying suit of armor and flew towards his freedom without the help of a pair of wings minus one particular man he had come to consider as a close friend and mentor. Yinsen.
“Okay……okay….umm….then what about that thing on his chest. What is that?”
He knew the engineer was still upset when he flew to Malibu the night itself in the armor and send a jet for Steve in the morning instead. He was not used to feeling guilty but this was somehow eating away at him. He kept fidgeting during the whole flight which did not go unnoticed by Pepper who was flying in with him.
“Steve you’ve been standing at the door for some time. Why don’t you take a seat?” the ever pragmatic AI suggested in a gentle tone.
“Listen here you little shit, you think you can skip away after hitting me like that huh?”
Steve didn’t put up much fight “okay”
“I’ll have to get back now” he blurted out awkwardly.
Natalie?” Sam asked eyes wide.
Steve was greeted by heartbreaking screams of anguish. One look at Stark and he knew what was happening. He had seen it before when Bucky would scream and sob and tear the bed sheets apart, Steve would hold him and help him and sometimes ice a few bruises he got on the process as well. It was better to leave Stark alone and not wake him but he billionaire was thrashing so violently scratching at his chest. Steve called aloud to the sobbing man a few times but to no avail so he carefully reached out to nudge the other man’s arm and the brunet woke up with an even louder scream. Steve immediately wrapped himself around the genius and tried talking to him gently.
Steve was not going to let go of his hand no matter what.
Did he imagine lips pressing onto his forehead last night?
“Sir has also stated that you could take the rest of the day off Mr. Rogers” okay if that wasn’t a 'get out of my hair' Steve didn’t know what was. So he agreed eagerly. JARVIS alerted when the delivery came and Steve got it and set it down in the kitchen according to the AI’s instructions.
Tony was somewhere along that spectrum. But to Steve the past Bucky and the present Tony were the same; men who had lost hope.
Steve gave a barely perceptible nod and Tony surged forward to envelope him in his arms and wings. They just sat there in the bed for eternity for all he knew, him whispering apologies and encouragements and Steve sobbing.
They found themselves close together yet again. The smaller man was looking up with a glint in his blue eyes and Tony found his breath catch. How could he not notice before?
Tony could swear that that woman was scarier than most of the super villains when she wants to be but right now he is simply going to ignore her and do what he does best. And that was hiding inside his workshop and pretending that he is fine. Yup, best plan ever.
That got his attention and the genius swirled around to face his assistant. The blond was holding all the things that had been delivered this morning to him.
Miss Rushman narrowed her eyes at Steve as if gauging his answer.
“I made breakfast, come on”
“Tony is dying” His voice sounded broken to his own ears.
“Don’t you think this is a little too much?” Steve asked pointing to the mugs.
“I can see why, he has quite the personality” Steve directed one of those loopy smiles towards Tony and he felt his stomach do a cartwheel at that.
She gave him a look as if contemplating something then left with a smirk on her face. Apparently she knew something Tony didn’t but he was too exhausted to go figure it out. He was in a dilemma; he didn’t know whether to get close to Steve and hurt him in the end or be rude now and not disappoint one more person. He decided on the latter but it all went out the window the second he saw Steve.
“It’s okay Steve, I have no right in meddling in your neighborhood and stuff” the other man tried to wave him off.
Steve had never in his life felt so out of place anywhere as much as he felt right there in the lobby of stark tower. Even though the tower itself was no architectural marvel (his personal opinion) the insides were sleek and professionally decorated. The people oh god, the people were all dressed like in those high end business magazines, all expensive suits and skirts and there he was in an oversized and rumpled up, cheap excuse of a suit.
“Wow and you got beat by Steve” Tony enjoyed that particular jab.
For the first few days Steve thought the former would be correct but after spending more time with the genius something inside him pointed to the supposition that the later maybe more true. Any way if someone asked, Steve would only say that the man was barely tolerable for now.
“Today is in fact Monday, you’ve been down here for approximately thirty eight hours sir” JARVIS replied in the dulcet of tones.
It was noon by the time she left and Steve was once again left alone in the penthouse. According to the schedule, Mr. stark had the interviews which he did not show up for and then the rest of the day was free.
Another chapter yayy!
“Morning Mr. Rogers”
Romanoff had the decency to at least act remorseful “Who do you think gave us the information”
"You're dying" Steve's tone was sharp as if he was stating the obvious.
Anyone who ever knew Steve Rogers could attest to the fact that he never backed down without a fight; hell even Greg from downstairs would agree to that, be it literal fisticuffs or life’s many challenges thrown in his face quite literally sometimes.
He zoomed in on the image of his once swan like and now don’t - want-to –think- about-it like wings. JARVIS was right; they were looking a bit black, no one would be able to see unless they had really great eyes or they were actively looking for it.
Tony slowly walked in gathering up the demolished remains of his cup forgetting his earlier panic and sat down on one of the stools. This close there was no evidence of anything on Steve. God he must be hallucinating now.
Okay he got the job, no idea how but he did after what seems to be the shortest interview ever, so no need to freak out. He took a few more deep breaths and readied himself to meet Mr. Stark, billionaire, Iron man, no big deal, easy as apple pie, right?
left unsaid. With that she turned around to stand straight and impeccable inside the elevator once again before the doors closed.
Kudos and constructive criticism is always welcome.
“Yeah……I……I’m fine” Steve gave a small smile and looked away. Tony watched his gaze fall on the Iron man armor on one of the work benches.
“Buck people ……..people are complicated. They do a lot of stupid things when it comes to love”. His thoughts immediately went to Tony and the ridiculous things he did upon the knowledge of impending death.
Phase one of pissing off the new PA was complete and it looks like this one wouldn’t even last a whole day.
“It’s beautiful isn’t it” Steve was the one who broke the silence first.
“That’s not up to you” she replied smoothly.
Honestly i got distracted by the drama-The untamed, its just sooooo good and i'm an idiot or not watching it sooner. I might write a few fics based on this.
And the tears rolled down faster.
Inside him, Steve’s heart was thundering away but he only felt numb. From his seat he braved a glance at Tony and saw the man’s knuckles turn white with the force he was gripping the sunglasses in his hands which proved to be too much and it shattered.
The way Tony’s whole body moved to get the parts fitted with elegance and a bit of flair and how his wings shifted and folded to fit inside the back piece, Steve felt the process itself to be one step away from a seduction technique and his cheeks warmed in response.
Tony felt like a colossal piece of shit the moment he saw Steve’s broken expression. He was shocked enough to gain back some semblance of sobriety and realize that he was staring for too long at the now closed elevator doors. He needed a drink again.
And that is exactly what he did or used to do, right up until Afghanistan. Tony could live with the surgery without anesthesia, the car battery attached to his chest, the waterboarding and the various other physical and mental tortures, really but what he couldn’t stand was what they were doing to his wings. They are what finally made him agree to their demands, that and a new hope of escaping that cave.
Bucky was on his second tour in Iran when the accident happened which left his left wing impaired. He was heartbroken that he would never be able to fly again and eventually slipped into depression. He went to therapy arranged by the VA and that was how he met Sam. The VA also paid for his surgeries and prosthetics but it wasn’t enough to get one of the run of the mill ones as Stark Industries provided.
“Please just call me pepper and Lydia will be up in a few, if you need anything just call my office Mr. Rogers” she stated pleasantly, walking back to the elevator.
“Take a seat Mr. Rogers” The woman, Pepper Potts said not taking her eyes of the computer screen and extending her hand to take the portfolio from Steve. She had soft grey wings and sat with a confidence equal to Miss Rushman from a few hours ago. She had the air of someone you could easily trust and Steve found himself relaxing a little.
He lifted a hand to his face and let his fingers ghost over his lips as if he could still feel the other man. It was selfish to want for Steve to stay, he knew this but his heart longed for it nonetheless.
So he asked. His voice sounded weak even for him but he had to know, it didn’t matter that the great Captain America was reduced to pleading. He needed to know.
“Look Mr. Rogers the situation is no way conventional so we are looking for a rather unconventional solution. Lydia will brief you the essentials later”
So, update!
The other man let out a sigh “Just……just be careful Steve”
He eventually let it go after Steve muttered some vague assurances clearly annoyed.
"Tony please "Steve was begging now, eyes filled to the brim with tears threatening to fall any moment. If the ground had any intention of swallowing him whole this would be the right time. Maybe he is weak, he can never stand watch the people he love hurt but he is never one for direct communication. Right now is not the moment to hide, right now his heart aches for Steve and he thinks to hell with it and blurts out
Steve looked at her with all the determination he could muster and nodded. By the time it took Steve to put himself together she was back from her call.
So she did the next best thing and got another job inside the Stark tower and started to monitor her target and everyone close to him. Opportunity presented itself when Stark transferred the role of CEO to Pepper Potts. And that’s when she met Steve.
I post this from my laptop but when i open it on my phone i cant see the Italics. Thank you for replying about that, i didn't know if it was only my problem.
“I’m afraid not captain, but I can’t stop you If you use the override” Steve couldn’t help but smile a little at that, so it was Jarvis’s way of saving the life of his creator, Steve felt proud, even Tony’s AI is protective of him and would do anything for him just like everyone else in his life but he had to go and fall in love with someone who wouldn’t love him back.
‘Mr. Rogers, is this a last ditch attempt to save Stark Industries?’
Steve gave an awkward cough and fixed his eyes on the suddenly very interesting floor instead.
“Alright I’ll take you and it's Natasha” She smiled at him with a knowing glint in her eyes.
“No Mr. Stark that’s not it, they’re nice…..a little too nice actually that’s why I can’t take them”
“It’s nothing. We will figure it out” he amended and after a beat added “Did you know?”
That lip-a rosebud from the thorn,
He wasn’t sure who pounced on whom, they were kissing by the time the elevator reached the penthouse and opened in near silence.
He had to admit, it hurt a bit. Everyone is here for the money of course he was not worth it in the long run.
He was out of Stark tower in no time. He got lunch on the way and took the scenic route back to his apartment. There was still time before Bucky and Sam would arrive so he decided to sketch something. He didn’t even realize it was six in the evening until there was a knock on the apartment door. He opened it to reveal Bucky and Sam.
His brain stopped working the second he entered the workshop. Everything looked like some complicated contraption from the future albeit the lab being a mess. He just stood there silent for a minute taking it all in feeling dwarfed by the sheer genius of the man standing next to him until his eyes landed on the armor hung up as in display. It was really a work of art more beautiful than before so up close.
Enjoy.
“I promised him I wouldn’t interfere but it’s getting out of his hands now” her voice had lost that playful essence and sounded so grave, her expression was nothing different. Steve just nodded and sat there staring at the sketch pad in his hands.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must be bad karma or all the years of being the merchant of death had warranted him the wrath of the universe because the one thing that is keeping him alive was also killing him.
The genius’s answers to Steve’s questions were vague and the only thing he understood was that Tony needed rest immediately.
She inferred Steve was everything Tony Stark wasn’t; kind, righteous, virtuous and a strong sense of justice with a bit of stubbornness to boot. The fact that the man did not possess any wings didn’t matter to her at all. She had seen devils dressed in white with the most angelic of wings and learned not to trust them a long time ago.
“I’m fine”
“I’m here. Sorry I’m late”
Pepper had a hand on her hip and was rubbing the bridge of her nose with the other. They probably look like a Mom and Dad reprimanding their misbehaved child, Tony smirked at that thought.
Realization dawned on Steve’s face immediately at Tony’s inquiry “Could you please stop the car, I need to make a call”
The other three men stood there at the threshold staring at each other, frozen in shock. Steve murmured a barely perceptible ‘I’m sorry’ and started sobbing again on Tony’s chest.
“Of course she called, from the middle of a very important meeting by the way. You think I watch these shit”
Tony leaned back on his chair and searched his memory for the man who sat opposite from him. The man looked like Steve in a lot of ways but he was taller and was sculpted like a statue. He would totally remember meeting someone like him if it were for a few more months prior but he drew a blank. He doesn’t remember anyone from the tech team as a matter of fact because Steve was there and ……..oh god.
“I sincerely apologize for my behavior your honor” Tony replied with genuine remorse.
“Are you kidding me Steve, you think SI wouldn’t support an employee that got harmed that too during a company venture”
Despite the intimidating presence, James or Rhodey or platypus as Tony often called him turned out to be a very pleasant man. Their conversation took an embarrassing turn for Steve when Tony started ranting about how amazing an assistant Steve was. The colonel had a peculiar look on his face which Steve couldn’t place and practically didn’t care because he would’ve burst into flames if Happy hadn’t interrupted them.
Steve saw the other man had caught him staring and gave a week nod. His cheeks were on fire so he immediately ducked his head but failing to miss Tony’s smirk which only made him blush more.
“JARVIS, who made this equally profound of an observation” he asked raising both his hands to the sides for dramatic effect.
“Oh.......hey Stevie. You want some coffee?” his best friend asked instead of answering.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look Nat I know, I’ve seen the flowers and ……..i don’t think I can do anything about it” the last part was almost a whisper and he doubted if she had heard.
) in the morning.
“I really need the money Mr. Stark” he knew he was being too blunt for a PA. What astounded him was the look of hurt that flashed through the other man’s eyes. He felt bad and immediately ducked his head in the pretense of looking at the papers.
His traitorous face must be blazing red right now. He tried to calm himself down and the sight of the woman wiping the floor with Happy certainly helped as a distraction.
“If you must know, it’s neutron damage” he replied as for an explanation.
I am really sorry for not posting this early (yeah I'm horrible).
“Well, its lunch time does Mr. stark need anything?” he was tentative to ask the robotic butler (
“Are you alright?” Tony inquired in a milder tone.
"What you got a problem with that?" oh
Steve gave a huff of almost laughter “What makes you think he did something?”
The angle was not quite right but he wouldn’t trade it for the world. It was a soft, delicate press of theirs lips. Steve’s were a little chaffed by the wind but it didn’t matter. It felt like finally coming home. It was more perfect than he could ever imagine and he guessed they made a really nice image; Iron man, head bend and kissing someone, hovering above the water with shining lights behind them.
“No I want you to tell me what happened last night”
“You sure about this?” Rhodey asked facing him with all the seriousness he could muster.
“Can you let me in?”
Once he made sure that Steve was asleep, Tony decided to step out into the living room. Barnes was hunched over on the sofa with Wilson holding his hands for comfort.
“That’s all I ask. Our agent will help you and I suggest you keep it discreet for everyone’s sake”
He stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him silently. He had kept his calm to help Tony and now it was his turn to fully freak out.
“Art degree and oh taught a few classes at a junior high……personally I think the ability to manage children is more than enough qualification to work with Tony” she said glancing back at Steve with a small laugh, a bit of fond exasperation leaking from her voice. Steve tried to smile back, tried being the imperative.
And so his current dilemma, the one that made him hate flowers for life was named Steven Grant Rogers. The facts were simple; Tony was in love with Steve but Steve wasn't. Why would he, Steve could have anyone in the world, why would he choose Tony with his baggage and poor habits and arrogance and need he go on. So no Steve would never love him back, his friendship was more than enough for now. And thus a disease literally grew inside his lungs.
