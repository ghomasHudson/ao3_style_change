“I don't know.” He shakes his head. “I think I stop myself.”
“You prepared all of this, and I couldn't afford you flowers.”
“Come back with me, Cas.”
“Mommy, why don't I look like the other boys?” asks Dean a few months later during a walk through the park. There are lots of kids, running and playing around.
This fic was inspired by

“Oh, yes, you're right...” he says, nodding. And Dean feels that he's heart is going to break on the half. “But I thought I wasn't going to be back, from my point of view it was, indeed, a goodbye.”
He sees fake-himself who is wearing exactly the same clothes; blue plaid shirt with jeans, and Cas in his trench coat, so maybe he is an angel here again? But the most shocking thing is the fact that they're kissing.
“Okay, it has sense, I think. So, you need to fall in love first…” It wasn’t a question, more like a statement of fact.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” says Cas, after Dean finishes.
Every time it's harder, and the longing becomes more and more strong. It doesn't matter how long he's gone, it's always too long.
Cas decides to order one more beer. He raises his hand, looking for a bartender. After ten minutes they decide to come back to the hotel. They go outside, and Cas looks at Impala. He can see some movement inside the car. Great, they're doing it on the parking.
“Who?”
“Dean... Can I open my eyes now?” he asked.
Cas ignored this note. He didn't feel like having small-talk. Dean was here because of some reason, and Cas needed to know what was that. “Dean, why are you here?”
Cas looks at him, and squeezes his hand back. Twice.
“I would have an apiary…” says Cas.
“Nothing.”
“Yes! He'll fall in love with you when he sees you!”
“Okay, are you gonna tell me what's going on? Or we're still playing in this weird game?”
“With honey, Cas! Did you put honey in your coffee?”
“And Freddie? Do you think he was broken?”
Dean says "I love you" in every language.
Did he say it loud? “Hey, Cas, it's me, you're safe. And I'm not gonna leave you.”
Cas takes a sugar and a little spoon. Dean clears his throat: “Look, Cas, I need to talk to you. Could you stop for the moment?”
Sam doesn't turn around too busy with a plastic baby bottle. Dean notices that his brother looks very bad, his hair aren't shiny like usually, and bags under his eyes indicates that he didn't sleep well recently.
In the park they met some lady who gives him an advertisement. Normally, Dean would throw this at once, but this time he reads it. It's an invitation to the prom. Of course, there must be some prom! It can be Dean's chance to make things right. He clears his throat.
Cas isn't sure which thing is the most intense to him. A smell of cigarettes? A taste of a beer? Or maybe a sound of a music from an old jukebox?
“We can go now,” he says with his deep voice. “Are you okay, Dean?”
“Mornin' sunshine!” he says and points at his mug. “Coffee?”
“Okay, you need to take off a tie,” commands Balthazar first. Cas does what he told him. He hides his tie in his pocket.
“Yeah? So, what’s the word?”
“But you need to sleep. You're a human now,” tries again Dean, but it makes Cas feels even worse. His breath changes, it's rapid. “Hey, it's okay. Just breathe, all right. In and out.”
“Dean, how long will you stay?” he asked in the evening, when they were sipping a beer together. Jack was sleeping, and Dean had brought some wood earlier to make a fire in the stove. It was nice, warm and familial, just like home…
“Dean, don't say like that, please,” he started. “I... I lo-”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Cas was wondering about his sexuality more than once. He's an angel, genderless celestial being, and it doesn't work exactly like with humans. But if he had to choose some label, he would say he's pandemisexual. He doesn't care about a gender, he sees souls, but he can feel desire only then when he has a strong bond with somebody. And of course, Cas has it with Dean.
The second time, it happened in the kitchen. Cas walked there when Dean was pouring a cup of coffee.
“You stupid son of a bitch!” Dean runs his fingers through his hair. How can he react to this.
, thinks Cas. Stitches would be just another problem for Dean, good that he doesn't need them.
“And what about the girls?” he asks, ignoring what she said.
“After your confession, I mean, your coming out… I didn’t expect that, but I’m okay with that. I’m not homophobic, I hope you know this… Charlie, she’s a lesbian, you know, right? And you know I don’t have a problem with this?”
“Jerk!”
him on the drive; and he talks with him, repeating how much he loves him.
“Yes, me too. It’s unpleasant and irritating,” gasps Cas, rubbing his hand on his thights.
(See the end of the chapter for
There's a silence for the moment because Cas knows he can't pretend what Dean is asking any longer.
“Dean, I would like to have sex with you on the couch, right now.”
“Oh, come on, don’t you have some preference. I dunno, hair, height, eyes color? Anything!” he encourages him to confide.
“In the shop. What did you tell him?”
Cas tastes like cotton candy and popcorn, more sweet than Dean expected and better than he ever wished for. They're kissing in the moonlight, and everything is perfect. The date couldn't end any better.
There’s 🤟 in sign language after Eileen taught him a few phrases.
“Will you dance with me, Cas?”
, he doesn’t want to let him go, not when he knows how it feels to have him so close.
He gave it to Cas last year as a gift, it took him three days to record it, and for the beginning he was wondering if it wouldn’t be strange to give
Winchester, of course, he can comfort a baby and take care of it. He did more difficult things in the past.
They're going together, holding hands and brushing their arms. And it's definitely not just a friendly date.
“Nah, coffee can wait,” he murmurs and kisses him softly. “And I, on the other hand, I've waited too damn long already.”
Dean gulps again.
“So, why did you lie to Sam?” Cas tilts his head and squints his eyes, not understanding this.
“What was for that?” asked Cas when they pulled away.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Sam rubs his eyes and runs a hand through his hair, he's exhausted.
“A pie?” asks Cas who thinks that he misunderstand something. He frowns, and it makes he looks even more adorable.
“Yes. And I never regretted this.”
Every sentence is louder than the previous one, and Sam is just thinking that it's a matter of time before Jack wakes up.
Cas comes closer, still looking at him. He has so bright blue eyes…
“Dean… I think you know why. You have a crush on him.”
Cas raises his eyes, looks at him and put the book aside, focusing only on his best friend. Dean scratches the back of his neck nervously, he has no idea how to start.
The corner of Cas’ mouth pulls up a little, and he chuckles: “No, I didn’t, but I also didn’t kiss a lot of woman.”
“We won't kill anybody else, Dean! I think it's enough deaths today…” Sam tries to calm down him, but Dean looks even more pissed off because of his words.
, he thinks.
“You’re the most loving person I will ever know,” repeats Cas after he’s back from the Empty. He says it to Dean all the time because Dean needs to remember.
“C'mere,” he says, and Cas with a hesitation comes closer. He puts his head on Dean's chest, and feels how Dean wraps his arm around his waist. With the second hand, he strokes his hair. “And now, sleep!”
Cas is staring at Dean’s tattoo, but he doesn’t understand what does it mean. He tilts his head and opens his mouth to ask: “Why?”
“Mornin' sunshine,” greets him Dean. Cas has his head on his chest. He doesn't remember when Dean came to his room. He pulls away fast, looking at him, apologizing.
“I think you're already. You love him, you want the best things for him, and you care… Not every father does this.” Dean thinks about John for the moment, but he doesn't want to spoil the mood, so he doesn't mention him. But something in Cas’ gaze changes, maybe he thinks about the same?
Dean left, and maybe it was better. Maybe Cas would miss him less, when they were fighting, when he didn't stay longer. Because every minute he was here, Cas knew he was gonna miss him even more. And he knew he couldn't go with him.
“I need to make pyres, I saw wood at the back of the house, it's not gonna take me long… Can you take care of Kelly's body?”
“Yeah, I don't like you either.”
For all week, Dean doesn't take Jack on hands even once. He wants to help his brother a little, of course he wants to, but he can't. He can't even look at Jack. The baby is too similar to Cas, and the wound is too fresh to handle with that.
The next ten minutes pass in silence. Cas doesn't want to make Dean more mad, and Dean needs some time to calm down and stop thinking about Mary. She's gone, and nothing can change it. But Cas is back, he should be focused on him.
“Hello, Sam. I'm here,” says Cas, and Sam gasps with relief.
“I think, yes. I don't know what 'sleeping well' means, actually.”
Dean bites his lip bottom, and doesn't say any word more for the rest of their ride.
Dean blinks and stare at Cas, who's sure he won't agree to this, but to his surprise, Dean nods.
He starts urinating. Unfortunately he pees on the toilet seat, he definitely needs to make more practice. Dean zips his pants and cleans hand, not even realizing that he's smiling all the time.
“What are you doing?” asks Dean, frowning.
“All right, all right. Fine, you win, but only because I'm tired too.”
“No, it's better. It's better because you are real.”
Dean chuckles. Sweet, innocent Cas… And poor Hannah.
“Do what?” repeats Dean, cutting tomatoes to their dinner. He has an apron around his waist. “Cooking? You wanna recipe, or what?”
“What? It's a stupid argument,” he says, focusing on the road again. Sam can see hesitation on his face.
“It's not like you made it easy, buddy.” Dean was looking around, judging the house. “It's nice place. For a kid.”
Dean frowns his eyebrows. Cas has bulging eyes and looks like the other day when they came to the brothel, and he was afraid. Is he scared now too?
“Then I will prepare something for later on soon.”
He takes the wrist of one of Dean’s hands, helping him sit up just enough that Castiel’s knees are not accidentally digging into his belly, so that when Dean plops down again a few seconds after, his vulnerable upper body is lying safely atop of Castiel’s crotch and stomach. Dean breaks out into a giggle fit as he nestles himself closer, and it makes Castiel wonder how lucid Dean actually is.
Castiel tilts his head to the side, a gesture Dean has come to read as him having to consider and rethink. “I did not read you incorrectly, did I, Dean?” His gaze searches Dean’s eyes and his features, assessing him anew, with even more intensity than he’s already doing all the time, and with a squint. Dean wants to hide from it, so he stares at his glass instead and coughs out the last of his drink. “That you are familiar with the BDSM scene, understand the terms of what I just proposed, and are a submissive, at that?”
Suddenly finding himself winded, Dean could do nothing but stay where he was, Castiel’s arms around his chest and his face burrowed in his neck.
Flooding him.
“Yes, of course,” Castiel easily disagrees. “Do you think I hired and kept you on the grounds of being beyond beautiful? I made you my personal assistant based on your skills and attitude alone, not because having a gorgeous assistant is considered an asset by many. You already are an asset to me by your hard and precise work alone.”
The robes are probably less bathing robes rather than dressing gowns, or at least that is what they would be called where Dean grew up. They are all silk and shimmer and most likely not meant to be used to be donned while still wet and naked, yet that’s what they did the night before. Castiel certainly looked like he couldn’t care less about the proper use of the robes as he coaxed Dean out of the shower and his arms into the robe’s sleeves, rubbing his skin dry with the costly fabric of them and smiling at him.
“Could’ve fooled me. What with the way you tend to your flock, bring the good news, and care for lost sheep.”
“By getting you off the streets, I’m actually giving it my best to protect
. In which he deserves this, to want, and is wanted in return.
Novak studies him where his squirms, and Dean can feel his eyes taking him in, assessing all of him, and instead of feeling uncomfortable, it feels natural. It settles a calm over Dean that he had lost when he first saw the present, nervosity and insecurity and maybe even a bit of fear, but none of that remains now, in Novak’s presence and under his steady gaze.
“Yeah, right.” It’s so difficult to just accept this, to let Castiel talk and believe it, to not just automatically shut out when it gets to be too much. Because Dean can take compliments like ‘hot’, ‘sexy’, ‘fuckable’ or whatever, even the occasional ‘beautiful’ if it’s in the throes of passion, but not like this, for no reason at all, from a man who’s embracing and praising him after a week that started off so nice and then turned so bad and who’s already making him forget about all of that again. “And what about other people?”
“No, I–” Castiel takes a deep breath. “Maybe.” Dean shoots him a hurt glare that has Castiel quickly explain himself. “I did mean to impress you. To show you what I can do, that I can–,” he swallows heavily, “that I could provide for you, as a mate. That I would do anything for you, to make you happy. That I would risk my own company for you, in order to demonstrate that what I want of you is more than just to be allowed to be intimate with you. Not that being intimate with you isn’t something I also crave.” He feels the heat that must be staining his cheeks, but decides to ignore it. “What I mean to say is, it wasn’t my intention to humiliate or debase you, but to,
a proper word for what they are or what they might be – this state of on the verge of something and yet exactly where they should be. So, what Dean settles with is a simple, “if he knew about us.”
“I believe I already told you about those times about when I am in bed or in the shower by myself. Any time that I touch myself. These are when you are on my mind, of course, but also at times like the ones you just mentioned, like whenever I am in any uncomfortable situation that I have to deal with alone. Especially whenever I have to meet with Adler. When I have to talk to him or partake in any of his meetings, I like to imagine you also being there and to think about what you would have to say about him.” He grins a little grin and Dean can see a hint of his gums. “But I also think about you whenever I am in the office or at home any you’re not there. When I am on my way home, knowing that you are still in the office by yourself, working so hard for me. Or whenever something good happens. It’s then that I always find myself wishing to share it with you. To have you smile along with me, and to touch that smile and you, to feel you feel good, just like I can whenever we scene.”
“I’m not in turmoil,” Dean weakly counters, already feeling how all of those negative emotions of the last couple of days come welling up again.
and– ah,
for one thing. At how little it takes for Castiel to bring him to the heights of arousal with nothing but a few words and a smile, the hand on his dick not even necessary.
Dean supposes that it’s of no further import; that he might as well just keep lying there, with Castiel still half on top of him and half pressed to his side, with that warm hand putting just enough pressure on Dean’s belly and come-ruined dress shirt that it doesn’t tickle, with those low words maybe not returning the heat but that steady warmth, with no expectation of him but to do just that, to lie there and accept his reward. His reward for – well, being rewarded. For being taken care of. But no, that’s not quite right either, is it? It’s for
“I can do that,” Castiel breathes out. “Squeezing you, I mean.”
“No,” Dean huffs out heavily, because this is so far from the truth as it can get. He loved every minute of what they did, no matter how cautiously reluctant and wary he might have been about it at first.
It lulls Dean even deeper into his dozing state and he suspects to have completely nodded off for some time because the next thing he’s aware of is Castiel suddenly lying beneath him, taking a nap of his own while cradling Dean to his chest and keeping a sheet around Dean’s shoulders and covering both of them with it. Castiel is, incidentally, also still just as naked as Dean.
for a lack of a better term and comparison. It’s not as clearly to see as if he were outside the water, of course, but because of the minimal foam, there is almost nothing obstructing Dean’s view. So he can see how his cock is darker than the rest of Cas’ skin, but how it still carries a pinkish tint that might be due to the hot water, though Dean has no trouble imagining it always looking like that, getting even richer and more perfect in colour with more blood pumping into it. It’s floating lazily in the water, the dark curls making it difficult to see the base and to gauge how long it really is, but from what Dean can see, it’s already impressive enough. Especially because it’s—
It’s not quite a restaurant, but also not a simple fast food joint. Novak and him have begun frequenting the Roadhouse after Novak’s elder (but decidedly smaller) brother Gabriel Novak had come by and brought along mischief and the best burgers either Novak or Dean have ever tasted. Actually, Gabriel’s take-out had only been meant for Novak, but as soon as his boss had had his first bite and probably seen the face of God, he used the intercom to call Dean into his office and handed him the rest of his burger to have a taste, too. Apparently, he would have thought it would have been a crime not to share something as good as this with Dean – and also, Novak wanted him to make a reservation for his next lunch at the place from where the burgers were.
“What’s wrong, Dean?”
“I see you have found your present.”
Castiel’s eyebrows lift. “’Easy’, is that?” He doesn’t seem exactly pleased with that answer. Maybe that’s not enough yet. “Now, why would you think that?”
“Cas,” he begins, fighting to keep his voice even, to not let it crack, “don’t make me beg, okay? I know you won’t hurt me, that you’ll be able to tell even before I will when it becomes too much, but… we haven’t done this in so long and I miss,” he clenches his eyes shut, but even if he cannot see anything, he can still hear his mouth speak the truth, “I miss feeling you inside me, okay? Being close to you in this. You know how much I like it.” God, if anyone but Cas were to listen to this, he would immediately die of shame. His voice finally does break, and he ends in a croaked whisper, “How much I need you.”
“Yeah,” Dean eventually replies, breathless.
So, he rolls his hips forward once and twice and a third time that has Castiel throw his head back and groan and that has Dean smile widely because it’s such a powertrip to see what kind of immediate effect he has on Castiel. But Dean doesn’t get any further than this, because as soon as he starts to try to grind his hips in a little circle, putting proper pressure on both their cocks to get both of them off eventually, there are hands fastly grabbing his hips.
“You’re welcome.”
Because
“What? Dean, I don’t–” Castiel tries to catch Dean’s gaze again, but Dean refuses to, deliberately turns his head and eyes away, and Castiel allows him to, for the time being. “Dean, I currently don’t sleep with other people, and I don’t intend to. I know we haven’t yet discussed about whether we are exclusive or not, but I personally enjoy to focus all of my energy and attention on my current play partner, not anyone else. Least of all business partners of Sandover. And Balthazar – Mr. Roche –, he’s also an old friend from college. This isn’t the first time we have done business together, but neither of us has ever tried to or wished to move beyond any of this. I am not interested in him and he is not interested in me, regardless of how much he likes to flirt with anyone and,” he furrows his brow, “annoy me with things that are none of his business.”
“I want to make love to you, Dean,” Cas rumbles, and his smile blossoms into something else, as if relieved by the truth of it and by that he is finally able to speak it. “I have wanted to for a long time. You are the most precious being of my whole existence, you are so
of it. The whole nine caring and sex yards.
suddenly there’s images of Castiel sucking down his balls and getting him off just like that, for however long it would take. And then fucking Dean when he’s all good and spent, just taking a body he’s milked with his mouth beforehand nice and hard on his back and–
Because he still feels warm from the soft sheets and the strong arms that held him through the night – his reward for doing nothing but opening up and being honest, about big things like his father and about smaller things like wanting Castiel in their bed with them –, and he knows he will feel even warmer when drinking this. That this calm and safe feeling will only keep on growing, bigger and sturdier, with every hot sip and every night spent here or wherever Sam and Castiel and him may go. And that Dean will soon won’t think anymore about those nights spent on his knees or back or on hard pavement, that they will remain as nothing but a bad memory, a fading nightmare, as something already forgotten about at the breakfast table.
Dean pleads, and he feels his eyes sting with tears. Because it’s too much and he knows that Cas couldn’t possibly be genuine, that he’s only saying all that shit because he is drunk, making Dean hope for something he will never get and something he will never hear sober.
His hard work at his father Bobby’s office has finally paid off, and he has begun working at Sandover, claiming the position of a personal assistant to Castiel Novak, who is rumored to become CEO within the next five to ten years. As of now, Dean is under his direct command and sees him from early in the morning until late at night, if Novak attends some last-minute meetings or networking drinks again. Even though Dean was afraid he’d hate working somewhere that’s not Bobby’s, he has actually soon started to love his job and considers it to be demanding yet rewarding.
Sam is next. Dean has to do it over the phone, what with Sam being in Stanford and thus thousands of miles away from him, even though he would’ve liked to tell him in person. Sure, he could’ve done so during Thanksgiving, when Sam did in fact come to visit them, but he was too chickenshit back then. Besides, catching a quiet moment during which to tell him, without all the other family members and friends around, was pretty much impossible.
And as arrogant it sounds, Dean feels, for some reason, that the it’s not Castiel’s over-confidence in
Spellbound and quite possibly gaping, Castiel takes a step closer to the shop window, the call of the sweater too strong to resist, and before he realizes it, he has his hands and nose pressed against the glass, intently staring inside.
“I won’t, sir.”
And Dean takes in a surprised breath at that, and while he can practically feel how his blood starts rushing faster in his veins, he sits up straighter still, until he looks good and proper for Castiel.
“As in hand-feeding you, for example. I would love to be allowed to feed you in a sexual, but especially a non-sexual context. Before or after a scene, mostly. To include it as foreplay or Aftercare, or even just for the act of it, as a simple, stand-alone enjoyment.”
Castiel looks up at him from the paper, one eyebrow raised, while one of his hand still shuffles with the sheets as if looking for something. “Yes?”
Dean feels a tremble run through his body.
“Why’re you talking like my parents or whatever must be dead?”
As Dean adjusted his body, he thought he heard Castiel’s breath catch in the darkness, just so. For his own sanity, he decided to discard it.
at each other in utter relief. Because they did it! They saved the deal!
But Castiel doesn’t do any more than this. None of the choking and pressing and bruising Dean has only experienced once or twice, but would have come to expect in this scenario. Somewhere in his head, the logical part of Dean’s brain tells him that he knows the reason for this: because Castiel and him have never talked about this nor agreed on asphyxiation as part of this scene or any other play, so it would be wrong of Castiel to do something as daring as this anyway. Without knowing Dean would like this. Without his consent.
what he needs him to be. He will be
“There is nothing for you to be sorry for, Dean. If anything,
“You feeling any better, Cas?” Dean asked into the dimness of the room, only illuminated by the hall lights behind him. From his vantage point, he could only vaguely make out the shape of Castiel on top of his comforter, spread out like a starfish and eerily still. The weird position probably would have made Dean laugh any other day, but he didn’t feel like laughing in that moment – the images of the last hunt were still burned too freshly in his mind. Of himself being struck down by one of the harpies and almost torn from limb to limb, had Castiel not arrived in the nick of time, deftly striking them down with the wrath of God, and looking so fucking lost and shell-shocked right after.
“Yet, that’s no excuse. If I can find the time to scene with you, I should also be able to find the time to take care of you afterwards. It is just as essential as any set-up or safeword – and it was my responsibility to see to you properly.”
“Oh,” Castiel said, his arm twitching under Dean’s weight. He sounded surprised that Dean had gotten that his flat assessment had been an attempt at a joke and maybe a deflection – as if Dean hadn’t known him long enough to be able to recognize his weird sense of humor that others often misunderstood as him being socially awkward.
“Look at me, Dean,” Castiel requests, and as soon as Dean does, his lips are covered by Castiel’s, taken in feverish kisses. Even if their kisses can barely be called kisses at all, as Castiel is panting too much and Dean moaning too often for their lips to meet properly. But they feel good, like the last missing part of a puzzle finally slotting into place.
It sounds so strangely human.
As does all of him.
Dean feels his face flush even harder. He doesn’t want to be reminded of how nice it felt to sit next to Cas, pressed warm and close, and have him tilt and stroke Dean’s jaw and have him feed him the pie he had specifically made for him, and then have him smile all proudly whenever Dean swallowed and made little pleased noises around each forkful (or fingerful). It was the only indulgence Dean had allowed himself during the week, and now he felt bad -- no,
Castiel’s answering sound is choked, yet does come across as pleased, as considering even. But he shakes his head.
is still the one who’s in control,
And there’s the blushing again. Dean doesn’t want to sass Castiel by saying ‘
find out who is responsible for this and bring them to justice. I don’t care how reluctant you are, I will protect you and make sure you won’t have to enter any car with trembling hands again.”
Maybe it is the change in angle from Dean taking Castiel’s hand or maybe it is because holding his hand never fails to calm him down or maybe it is because Dean is stupidly in love with the angel and would give him anything he could ever ask for, but without any discomfort or pain, Castiel suddenly sinks deeper inside of him. Apparently just as surprised at the unexpectedly easy acceptance of his body as Dean is, Castiel gasps and presses his forehead against the back of Dean’s neck, where he can feel him smile.
“Like what, Dean? Please, do tell me. Because from my point of view, you have felt lonely and sad because I have failed to ascertain that all of your needs are met, and I didn’t even become aware of it until I almost went home for the weekend and left you alone for even longer with it. This is not blame that falls on you, but on me.”
“You can take me home right after,” Dean promises. And with that, there’s a little fantasy already springing up in his mind, making him grow even harder and more mindless. “And there, you can punish me there for this. Put me over your lap like we talked about and spank me for being so– so greedy. A bad boy.”
Castiel chuckles a little at that, but he doesn’t let any unnecessary time pass between Dean’s approval and his own move. Just as Dean leans forward, so does Castiel, with his hands reaching to tilt up Dean’s face with a few fingers brushing underneath his chin and his nose nudging guidingly against Dean’s cheek.
“Eh,” Dean says, thoughtfully, “I don’t care for the stuffing. As for the weight gain,” he shrugs, “Maybe.”
For one terrible moment of hope, Dean believes him. Without thinking much of these words, not past the fact that the Alpha even acknowledges him existence, touches him with gentle hands — he does not even dare to consider any of what the Alpha has just said.
Despite craving to sink into himself and just hug his knees to his chest, finding that bit of comfort in the enemy’s territory, Dean puffs himself up and stares the officer dead in the eye. “What about it?”
“Sir,” acknowledges sluggishly, pressing against his shoulders with even more insistence.
“Then why won’t you look at me?” Castiel’s voice isn’t angry nor resigned; it’s nothing but soft, soothing. It’s exactly what Dean has longed for all week, but now that he has it, he feels ashamed to get it. Because it’s as if he’s cheated himself into hearing it, by making Castiel needlessly worry about him and stay here, in this dim and empty office, instead of returning home and enjoying his weekend, like he well deserves to.
And takes a deep breath.
His body feels too tight, too small, suddenly. He’s torn between the edge of pain and pleasure, between believing Castiel’s praise just like before or refuting it, between allowing himself to give in to all of these sensations or let his mind rule.
Castiel nods, and it’s almost too proud again. “But your wording sounds as if there isn’t for you? Do you reject either or both? Are you asexual? If so, my request would be in no way changed; with or without sex, it would be an honour to dominate you.”
“Very well,” Novak says, and there’s something in how he speaks that sounds much like relief, and that could be elation in another lifetime. “Are you fine with the burger restaurant that we frequent?”
Castiel doesn’t let up on his nipples until both are swollen and straining, peaks rising up as if waiting for Castiel to put his lips to them again.
“I want too much,” Dean murmurs, confesses in the smallest of voices. He’s needy and greedy and selfish – and Castiel has a right to know.
Dean breathes out, lets go of the bad images that threaten to surface, and simply says, “I’ll have the usual, too.”
Dean is loathe to let go when his butt meets the leather, but Castiel gently unwinds his arms and legs from around him, puts a rushed kiss to his forehead and orders, “Wait for me here, Dean. It’ll be just a moment.”
“Y-yeah?”
His companions are taking very little interest in the clothing, though. Sam is more keen on visiting every electronics and books store there is, and while Dean is very intrested in entering every book store as well, his main focus seems to lie on the copious food supply.
Just to make sure Dean won’t hurt himself – and because Castiel wants to – he safely cradles Dean against his chest, both arms around him and his hands resting low on the small of Dean’s back.
“Only good things, I hope?” Dean asks, and he hopes it comes across as teasing instead of like seeking reassurance that he didn’t seem
Dean’s eyes, previously drooping in satisfaction and relaxation, suddenly tear open. “My tasks!”
“You don’t want enough,” Castiel counters, and he sounds so sure about it, “or you do, but you don’t allow yourself to.”
Dean would beg to differ; it’s his work, after all, that brings him the most praise from Castiel. And that has helped them enter their arrangement in the first place. It’s also, completely independent of his boss, something he takes great pride in.
“Dean,” Castiel sighs and rubs the side of his face against the side of Dean’s, almost like a cat and for no apparent reason. And Dean wants to see his sigh as not one of exasperation and of being tired of Dean’s shit, but he is not sure there is any other explanation for it. The little kisses Castiel puts onto the places where he has just rubbed himself against make him wonder.
“I will have you wherever you want,” Castiel promises, with nothing but truthfulness in his voice and heart, “I want you however you will have me.”
“We are going through our list for this exact reason. So that we know what we want to do and what we will avoid at all costs. You’re safe and the thing we discussed and rejected a few minutes ago will never become part of our scenes, our arrangement or us,” Castiel explains, so fucking caring that, for the strangest of reasons, it reminds Dean of when he was six and just started school and thought he was a big boy. But then there was this thunderstorm that one night and he was so scared, all alone in his bed, and then, like an angel, his mom Jody came in, said nothing save for some soothing noises, cradled him to her chest and carried him into his parents’ bed, right next to his dad Bobby and his little sister Charlie, who was already there.
“That’s very good. But I haven’t given you permission for something as naughty as to fuck my face, so you shouldn’t do that.”
a thousand times over.
“You must know that I have observed you for quite some time before I came to the conclusion that you are not just submissive by nature, but are also well aware of the Scene. I wouldn’t have approached you in this way otherwise. I thought you could assume why I asked you out tonight, that you too had seen that we work well together, that our dynamics are exceptional, profound. How you react to me,” his eyes darken and blink down to Dean’s necktie and up to his eyes again, his whole demeanour oscillating somewhere between assertive and assuming, but mostly wanting, “to every word and touch, so
“But I do worry. Especially because Adler’s behaviour is not an indicator of your work morale or proficiency, but of his antipathy for me. You took care of it, as much is true. And I am proud for how well you did so. But Adler’s envy shouldn’t have been your burden to bear in the first place.” His voice is strained, but his touch remains gentle. “I ask you to communicate with me, Dean. To allow me to see to the issues that were only mine, but that Adler made yours.”
Castiel very much wants to kiss him.
"What would you want me do instead? I want to keep in better contact with you, as something that will be integrative to our arrangement. There must be something like this for you as well, something you must want to be incorporated, in order to prevent what happened this week and to get the best out of this for both of us. And please, Dean, don'tt say nothing. There must be something.” Castiel sounds more than serious about this, and maybe one step away from taking Dean by the shoulders and shaking him until he sees reason.
He’s average by nature and may only appear a bit better than that because he fights so hard and struggles even more. And even then, he is nowhere near all those nice terms Castiel describes him with. Far from them.
they will be feasting again. who’s to say that they will return to the festivities instead of into Michael’s chambers, where Michael will do things to Dean that Dean won’t be able to oppose to, but for which Michael would deserve every bone in his fingers to be broken, smashed, ground into dust. Castiel thinks back to Dean’s fearful gaze, to his trembling, naked body, to his weight and blade pressing down on him, to his lone figure by the roadside
Cas frowns at him just like he had done when Dean declined his pie. “I saw you going out for a run every morning this week, and I’ve never seen you do that before. On Thursday, I talked to the young woman from the first floor, Charlie Bradbury, and she told me that she saw you running every evening. She wondered if you were trying to lose weight. And you sounded overly tired whenever we talked over the phone and then declined so much food, and I first thought that maybe you didn’t feel well, but you seemed to be okay enough to have me feed you pie.”
Castiel doesn’t even say anything, just shoves his hand in between Dean’s thighs, spreading his legs even wider with his arm and making Dean think about coming while rubbing himself against Castiel’s thick arm, legs closed and hard cock all shy yet wanting. And then that image disappears instantly when those long lingers close around his length, with the firm grip of a man too far gone, and then he pumps. Once, twice, a third time, and that’s all Dean gets because he’s not allowed to fuck Castiel’s fist like he wants to, instead remains a good boy until the end because he keeps his hips pretty and still for Castiel’s perusal, lets him stroke his cock from his pink tip down to his heavy balls, lets him feed him his tongue in and in until he’s root-deep and wet and good and in absolute control of Dean, who’s a slave to those exhilarating sensations that won’t stop coming , who’s in so much pleasure that his toes curl and his eyes spill over, who’s swept away in so much joy and
things.
who will take care of him.
So he just shrugs.
“It’s fine,” Dean lies, for which he garners an unimpressed and raised eyebrow from Castiel. He is quick to reiterate, “It does sting, though. Will probably get a bit worse once all those nice feelings wear off and my body calms down again and, y’know.”
“You know that this is not an offer I can just accept,” Castiel says, in-between kisses that might make his statement sound a bit ambivalent. And Dean is sure he has made this offer before, and that it was declined all the same.
“While that might be so, it would be wiser to move them into another city at least. Here is where John Winchester would start looking for them, and the town is too small to keep the boys hidden.”
And huh, Dean had almost forgotten about the state his ass must be in. But with calling attention to it, the awareness also returns, although still probably not as much as it will once the rush of his orgasm and of the comfort of being held begins to wane. Still, now that he thinks about it, it
The work of this nightis just the climax to a whole week of trying to save the deal, and by the time they are finally done, Novak and Dean are at the end of their ropes, with eyelids that drop despite the dozens of cups of coffee coursing through their blood stream and the adrenaline chasing right after the caffeine.
Dean laughs weakly. “Yeah, otherwise, we can kiss the Roadhouse goodbye. You’re lucky Jo’s a good sport and that Ellen wasn’t around to hear you dismiss her just like that.”
Castiel looks at him and seems deep in sceptical thought. Which won’t do.
right? Although Dean has no doubts about what Novak is, maybe he is only a perfect Dominant by nature. Maybe he is not even aware of what he is doing, he just naturally falls into a very favourable pattern.
(Castiel instantly believes everything said about Prince Dean when he first lays eyes on him; with the first gaze out of defiant green eyes, he can already feel his own sanity waning)
“Cas,
“No,” Dean almost bursts out, and then swallows heavily. “I’ve just never done this before.”
They start off breakfast by sitting opposite each other. After Dean has clumsily helped an about equally as clumsy Castiel to prepare some food – nothing more special than some fruit, yoghurt that is hopefully still good and two small bowls of overly sweet and unhealthy cornflakes – they returned to the bedroom, Castiel with the tablet and Dean with the coffee in hands, chatting about a TV program about the production that both of them have coincidentally watched.
Castiel’s breath is hot where it hits Dean’s shoulder, and it has Dean turning his head to look at him, and the sight he is treated to has him sucking in some air. Because Castiel is all ruffled and sweaty, his cheeks flushed and forehead shiny, shirt clinging to his skin and his almost unrecognizably dark eyes fixed on Dean, and Dean alone. It’s glorious to know that Dean is the one who put that wild look into Castiel’s eyes -- not for the first time, hopefully not for the last. And by doing nothing more than giving in to what both of them wanted to, by giving himself over into Castiel’s capable hands.
Cas’ fingers and his cock and his words feel, Cas tells him with a smile that is only evident in his voice that, “Despite it all, it didn't stop me from me from wrapping my hand around my own cock, from imagining what it would be like to be honest like this with you, to show you what your beauty and righteousness were to a celestial being such as myself, what they
Along with them falls darkness into and over the room, only disturbed by small cracks where the blinds aren’t fully meant to cover the windows and where the light from the corridor and the glow of the city breaks in.
“It might be a bit embarrassing at first, but it’s important that we can be frank about our scenes,” Castiel says. “If it is entirely too uncomfortable for you, we can also try to take another approach. You could write down your opinion or use the list – yes, that is what it’s here for – to show me what you liked. But if you want to continue our arrangement in any way, I consider it mandatory that we find a way to communicate. Whether written in the beginning or verbally. I need to know what you like and don’t like.” Castiel considers him for a moment, that blushy and crookedly grinning man whose embarrassment must be easy for all world to see. Castiel tilts his head to the side. “That is… if you are still interested?”
“Do you not agree?”
Any other time -- not in the middle of the night, for starters --, Castiel might have simply found Dean’s actions adorable, smiled to himself at any excitement Dean might have had about the Christmas tree or the twinkling decorations in the window. But he could not shake off his concern nor could he ignore that wistful, preoccupied expression on Dean’s face. “Is this about your childhood?”
“No.”
Dean’s eyes fling wide open.
“I want you to touch me more. I know that it’s kinda tricky, what with being in the office and all, but, “ he swallows and pushes on, “if you’re asking me what I want, then this is it, this is what I want. I like it when you touch me, and I would want more of it.”
he needs, that is, one of Castiel’s arms slung around him while Dean’s own arms are pulling in the tiny, shivering bundle that is his brother, close to his chest and into Castiel and Dean’s embrace, and Castiel just goes with it.
And there it is.
Dean shyly averts his gaze, blinks somewhere between Cas’ jaw and his throat. But Cas gently tilts his chin up, smiles softly at him when he makes eye contact again.
“Why did you do it then? As some kind of Alpha Male Power Display?” Dean challenges, putting this complex conflict into such simple words. “To demonstrate your power and influence to make me go weak in the knees and spread my legs again? Or what? Cas, I– why? I just don’t– don’t get
“Please, ah.” Dean wants to sink back into the cushions until they swallow him, until he doesn’t have to beg for something like this anymore. “Please, suck my cock.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, still a bit sulky but with growing anticipating nonetheless.
So, so good.”
“Dean.”
And in the next moment, Dean is sitting on top of him, feeling clumsy and shy about how exposed he is like this but still craving the gentle rubbing of their cocks, both of them sporting more than a chubby, and how even nicer it feels as he slowly moves forth and back, making the already plumb length still hiding underneath Castiel’s clothes grow.
“When would you even have had time for this? I know your schedule; I know your days were packed.”
instead.
“Regarding ‘the best’ – you were also the best. The best Dom I’ve ever had, I mean.” For some reason, this sounded not as clumsy in his head. The flush in his cheeks holds true as he squirms. “I could only trust you so easily because you never gave me any reason not to, but actively showed me that you would be good and fair to me if I did as you told me and as we had planned, and yeah,” he feels like he’s holding some dumb Oscar speech instead of thanking the man before him for spanking him and eating out his ass, “thank you.”
to force himself on him – makes his guts drop and his blood run cold. He likes the idea of Castiel pretending to be a teacher who spanks him for being mouthy or him being a patient who needs an urgent prostate check-up and gets more than he bargained for. Just light and sexy fantasies. Yeah, he would like those much more than seeing Castiel in any context that would, even by the looks of it, be in contrast to everything that they have tried to build. Because he gets what Castiel is doing between them, and he is doing the same in kind; building a foundation of trust and consent and honesty and fun. Something solid and, by any and all associations, nice. But nothing that would connect their sex with actual violence; nothing that would connect Castiel with baseless lack of autonomy. “I’m not interested in that, either,” Dean answers, mouth dry.
“We will have to remember to give her a tip of at least thirty percent.”
“Yeah, okay.” Dean licks his lips. He almost wants to ask whether there’s only that in there, a purely play-based relationship and whether that’s all Dean will get, but before he can ask, he gets a damn hold of himself. Because it’s quite clear that all they did right now was talk business. BDSM business, that is. There was never any mention or question of anything else, and every reason Castiel has stated for his interest was based on that as well. (Mostly.) That, basically, he picked up on Dean being a sub, found him appealing enough, liked that Dean actually reacted to his antics and thus asked him to play. No more than that,no less. Anything else would be nothing that was on the table at any point in time, and to even state the question would make Dean look so unprofessional, in a sense, amateurish. Worse yet,
“More like ‘going out for dinner’, I’d say.” She looks like the cheshire cat, and for a moment, Dean wonders how often Novak and him must have really come to this place and greedily gulped down their burgers, for her to act as familiar as she does. But he doesn’t even mind; in fact, he’s quite happy that he’s allowed to be a bit too familiar in return.
When Dean enters his small office one week later – after a couple of uneventful days in which people of all departments congratulated and clapped him on the shoulder for the closed deal, and as many days of Novak acting as usual and with no indication of him possibly knowing just what he’s
he lets out with a strained voice.
“Seriously?” Dean growls at him, now almost nose-to-nose and already toe-to-toe. “Are you trying to fuck all of my company over with this deal? I told you that the terms aren’t acceptable as you presented them and that they would cost us a fortune, and yet, you–” He makes a frustrated noise and shakes his head. The movement of which carries his scent even closer, right into Castiel’s nose and to the back of his tongue.
, it’s to find two rows of overjoyed and blushing emoticons and the words, “Then I would be happy to discuss further details with you.”
“I’m rather thankful for it,” Castiel simply replies. Apparently, he either hasn’t picked up on Dean’s tone of voice or doesn’t give it any thought, because he doesn’t even look at Dean or ask any dumb questions when Dean still stands frozen. All he does is shuffle into the kitchen, feet warm in his bee slippers, eyes bleary and his finger on the coffee machine as soon as he reaches it.
his heart might just get it.
Dean realized that for Jude it wasn’t easy for the beginning, and it gave him hope that maybe he could do this too. Maybe it wasn’t too late for him.
“Wanna try?” he asks.
“It’s nothing. Don’t touch it. It’s just some rubbish,” answers Dean quickly, comes to the angel as fast as he can, and wrests it from his hands.
“Okay, let's go home.” Dean changes subject and starts the engine. They're riding for a while before Cas asks the next question.
Cas raises his beer and drinks it at once. Then he orders something stronger. Sam blinks a few times and clears his throat: “Cas, are you okay?”
Later he also grabs honey in bear-shaped bottle, dude deserves for some sweet after all! He has been through a lot...
“Umm, do you have some questions about Jack? I could tell you something 'bout him.”
“Who are you?” asks Dean.
“You don't eat again, Castiel... You don't like our cuisine?” asks John reproachfully. Cas stares at him with frowning eyebrows.
“I'm an angel, we don't blush.”
Dean finds his brother in Kelly’s room. The woman is dead already, her body is lying at the bed in the same position she was left. She has closed eyes, and only blood indicates what happened here. Sam is staring at her with clenched fists. Everything is so wrong, it shouldn't be like this.
, he thought.
It’s the moment when Cas decides to come in the kitchen.
Dean remembers about Cas' throat, so he decides to do pumpkin soup for a dinner. Cas is a little excited that he will be cooking for the first time. He follows every Dean's instruction, and he thinks he's not bad at this. He killed thousands of monster, he knows how to use a knife, and cutting the pumpkins is much pleasanter than cutting the enemy. Dean makes jokes all the time, and Cas, for the first time since he fell, laughs.
They both are people, or maybe a human and angel, who doesn't fit well to this world. But they're trying and keep fighting all the time.
Cas jumps at his chair nervously and looks at Sam with a fear in his eyes.
“Us. Look, Dean!”
“He… umm, he stuck in the apocalypse's world,” murmurs Dean, and a smile disappears from his face.
“Hi, buddy, you need to meet someone,” he says, taking him in his arms. Cas stares at Jack, tilting his head. He gasps quietly, and Dean notices a love in his eyes. Cas reaches his hands to them, but he stops halfway.
Cas narrows his eyes: “My type? I don’t have a type.”
Cas doesn't sleep for the rest of the night. He gets up in the morning and walks to the kitchen, thinking that he needs a coffee. He takes a mug, the blue one with an elephant - the gift from Dean, and turns on the coffee maker.
“Yeah, Jack. A great kiddo! You're gonna love him,” interrupts Dean.
Shivers. And it's not because of a broken heater in the bunker, he's just missing something... someone. Without warm, his heart freezes, and how long it can beat in that condition?
“Let's go home,” says Dean, and Cas nods because it's the thing he wishes for the most. They're going to the car, and Dean can't stop looking at Cas. He's so lucky that it happened again. After he lost all hope, he has him back. He dreamt about it for weeks, and now his dream came true.
“It's nice to meet you. Dean talked a lot about you,” explained Cas.
“Maybe you wanted PB&J sandwich? It's a kitchen, after all.”
“No, you don't. Dean, I want this, whatever it is, I want this, and I want to come back with you. But I can't think only about myself, not this time, not with Jack... I don't reject you, Dean. I would never reject you, I dreamt about it for years, and I want you to be my family, but Jack... He's my son. He's my responsibility. I promised to protect him, and I'm going to keep my promises. But I don't reject you, you must know that.”
He kisses him softly, and it tastes different from the first time. And it has nothing to do with Cas' salty tears, but with the fact that they confessed true feelings to each other.
“Of course, Dean,” says Cas, nodding. He doesn’t want to stop, but if it’s necessary, he can do this. “But… Could I receive the last one?”
He walks to the kitchen, takes a glass and pours some whiskey. He drinks it in the one gulp, feeling the burning of his throat. Dean wonders if he should to drink more, but he decides to put the bottle away. The best way is to go to the bed early. He does what he thinks.
“Dean!” says Cas louder to get his attention. “Could you… Could you turn around?”
They're reading again, but they both can't focus on this, glancing at the other one from time to time. When their eyes meet once, they give a little smile to each other.
The second time he visits only Mary, so John is trying to avoid him. But Cas doesn't give a shit, and he messes with him.
“Yeah... We can go together. As friends, I mean. You know, a friendly date,” explains Dean, finishing it awkwardly.
Cas gives Jack a kiss on the forehead, and holds him closer to his body.
Did he say it loud?
“I know that, Dean. But your mistakes and your failures make you stronger, and you don’t need to be perfect. I love your every imperfection. It makes you human. And it makes you loving.”
Dean is thinking a lot about this, he has so many ambivalent feelings. He catches Cas at the night in the kitchen. Ex-angel is sitting on the chair with a glass of water and doesn't spot Dean at once.
“We can cut it a little if you want.”
You can find me on
“I'm gonna wash your hair now. Is it okay?” asks Dean, putting a sponge away. Cas nods, so Dean starts his job. He takes a shampoo and uses its cap to wet Cas' hair. He's massaging his head, and Cas closes his eyes for the moment. It feels nice, he has never experienced something like that before.
“Is it about dad? Look Dean, he's gone and you... you're here. You can do whatever you want. Whatever make you happy.”
His world ends up when Lucifer stabs Cas in the chest, on the exact spot for a human's heart. Dean falls on his knees, it is over.
“No, no, it wasn’t. I just… I didn’t know that in your perfect world with a perfect home, you would still want me by your side…” That’s the moment when Cas looks at him, finding his green eyes.
“Cas...” he says.
“But?”
“You weren’t? But she was hot,” says Dean, not understanding anything of this.
“You're my guest, Dean… And my best friend, of course, I have to.”
“I guess, there are more things which you don't know about me.”
On Dean's face appeared a real terror. He opened his mouth to say something, but he changed his mind at the last moment. Instead, he turned back and left the house. Cas didn't stop him, not this time.
Dean pulls away, just a little, to see Cas face. He cups it with his hands and whispers before he kisses him again.
“Hello, Dean.”
Later, it’s a longing, so Cas watches. He admires Dean, feeding his eyes only by staring at him. He’s tracing freckles on his face, looking for some new which appeared since their last appointment. He’s observing how Dean’s chest rises and falls slowly in every breath during his deep sleep. And he’s looking at his soul. Still bright, still beautiful… Still Dean’s.
Inspired by song "Ain't no sunshine",  Bill Withers.
“Good. Very good.” Cas smiles the way only he can, shyly, with the corners of his mouth are up just a little. “I'm happy, Dean.”
“Your soul isn’t black. Actually, you have the brightest soul I’ve ever seen,” mentions Cas, and it makes Dean has this weird feelings in his chest again, but he says nothing. There’s no anything you can say after your best friends told you something like that.
Dean shifts a little like he’s looking for a more comfortable position.
“You know, years of practice…” he jokes, but he stops preparing a meal and turns to Sam. He has more to say. “But to be honest, I was wondering about this too. And I have even a theory, but it's stupid.”
When Sam comes back with African Dream Root, Dean is using it without hesitation.
scars… Scars after a surgery.
“No, I mean, you really love me.”
“You're a good mother, Mary. And they are really happy to have you back,” he says honestly. Mary lights up their hearts, and having her here is like a dream for the Winchesters.
“Dean, I need to tell you something.”
Dean closes his laptop and rubs eyes, then gasp, turning around to Cas.
“I think we should stop doing this. I mean, the hugs,” starts Dean slowly. They’re sitting in his room for a while, and they need to have this conversation.
“It's okay, I'll go,” says Cas behind Dean's back. He comes closer to Dean, gives him a kiss on the cheek and goes outside.
“Oh, shut up! Maybe billions of years are young age for an angel, but I’m not freakin’ robot, so when I can use the elevator to get to the fifth floor, I do this.”
“Especially then.”
“Oh, and I don’t wanna look at it.”
on tumblr.
“It was a very nice morning, Dean,” says Cas, and it sounds a little like goodbye, so before he says anything more, Dean steps in.
He also uses one of Sam's hair conditioner, on purpose because the bottles are totally different that you can't mistake it for shampoo.
“Okay.”
“Of course, I don't. I could never hate you!”
Dean got out of his car and followed Cas.
“You don't have to pretend at all,” says Sam calmly.
“You’re the best…” he murmurs and puts a free arm around his shoulders, pulling Cas closer on a quick hug.
He tried a beer for the first time when he was eight, it was just one sip from his father’s friend. It tasted like a shit, but when he was sixteen, it became more casual thing. John drunk all the time, and he, as a good son, followed his old man. One beer after a case wasn’t something bad, right?
Cas is gone before Dean can say anything more.
“I don't think so… It's smashed, and… Jeez, Cas, it's so stupid, I can't even give you a proper bouquet, I…”
Cas freezes, he knows he shouldn’t eavesdrop, but he needs to know what wrong he did this time.
He pulls out a gun from his belt, and Sam moves fast close to him. Of course, he won't let him do this! He will fight if he has to. But fortunately, his brother doesn't point at Jack, he doesn't even reload his gun, the muzzle is directed down, and he just gives it to Sam. And this gesture says more than any word. Sam feels relief even then he knows they’ll have to take a long way till everything will come back to normal.
“Yes. It was strange. I didn’t want to kiss them. I think Hannah could be interested in me…”
“I don’t…”
It isn't like in romcom movies, it's definitely more boring and time-consuming. Dean goes with Charlie to the shop center to buy some suit. Charlie gives him lots of clothes, but some of them look ridiculous, for example a bright yellow shirt with green trousers and straw hat. Who the hell could wear something like that? Unfortunately, she makes him to try everything on. At the end, they choose a classic black suit with a bow tie.
After the bath, Dean takes fresh rompers for Jack, and when the kid is dressed, he sits with him in the armchair. It was a long day for both of them, so they deserved to rest. Sam appears ten minutes later to check them on.
It takes Cas only a second before he leans to Dean's lips and kisses him softly. And it's not that he's accepted or tolerated, but he's welcomed. Dean wants him by his side. He wants to wake up next to him, and for Cas it's everything he ever wished for.
“Yes, I know.”
“If you want… You could help me with a dinner today for the start,” he proposes.
The phrase 'John Winchester is homophobic as hell' is a bullshit because Queen of Hell is freakin' (
Dean touches Cas' cheek and brushes it with his fingertips. Cas closes his eyes as a sign of his consent and waits for Dean's move.
“Cas, look at me, please. Tell me, what's wrong.”
Cas smiles, and Dean feels something warm in his heart.
believe, that his Cas is back.
Dean looks at him, and he can't believe that he's really back. There's a gap between them, none of them move even one inch.

“Thank you, Dean, I love it! But I don't have anything for you. I didn't know that…” he says it upset. Balthazar didn't tell anything about gifts.
Dean lays his hand on Cas shoulder, rubbing little circles with his thumb. He swallows nervously because he has something more to say. Something, which still scares him.
“What are you talking about?” Sam frowns, eyeing on his older brother. Of course, Cas is kind of cute, but he still looks like some middle-aged dude.
“Yeah, good,” said Cas with the same enthusiasm as Dean.
“I want the tattoo too,” murmurs Cas, burying his nose in Dean’s neck.
Dean gets up from the bed, just to drink some water. But the truth is he can't sleep at all. When he comes back from the kitchen, he passes Cas' room, and he can hear his voice from there.
The rest of the day is calm. Sam and Dean stays at the bunker all day, and Dean makes sure that Cas has everything he needs. He’s mostly spending time in his room, reading some books or watching some TV shows about houses on HGTV. The other night comes faster than he expected, and at the moment he should sleep again, he just rolls over all the time. Eventually, he decides goes to Dean’s room, hoping he’s still awake.
“Because I'm pregnant…” he jokes, rolling his eyes. “Jeez, Sammy, the kiddo must sleep somewhere.”
“Cas...”
He isn't sure until he sees like Dean is flirting with some random woman. Yes, it is intense, full of emotions and feelings. Jealousy. Heartbreak. Awful pain in his chest.
Fortunately, there is no major incidents, and Dean's shirt is still dry, after he changes Jack's diaper. He takes Jack from the changing table.
Cas nodded like it was obvious, not realizing what Dean actually said. He came closer to him, leaned and brushed his lips against Dean's. It was automatically, like he wasn't a human, nor ex-angel, just a robot.
“Shut up, Sammy! You were cockblocking us for years!” shouts Dean and grins to his brother.
He had sex only once in his life. With April, who kills him after that like she was some mantis. Cas was human then, and he did it because he was curious, but he never did it again because he doesn't need it.
He can't even enjoy his big win for more than five minutes. “I won't talk about it anymore.”
“W-what?” Dean didn’t expect hearing something like that. And why would Jack say it in the first place? Did Cas tell him something? Or maybe it’s just a kid’s imagination. “Jack, what are you talking about?”
“About nephilim? We still don't know anything about Jack's powers, and I think it's important to find out how it exactly works. Books are in Enochian, so it takes a lot of time.”
“Yes, please, Dean.”
“Sure!” says Dean, smiling and coming close to him. Then he whispers: “You're gonna scream with pleasure…”
It’s a long minute, then another, before Jack calms down. He stops crying, breathing normally again. Maybe he believed in Dean’s words?
“I'll buy you this damn cup, and it's gonna be better than the old one. You're gonna be grateful that I broke the other one...” he murmurs angrily, stopping by the section with dishes. There's a lot of colorful cups, but he's looking for something special. But his eyes catch the blue one with a bee with cowboy hat.
“What was what?” Dean turns his head to his little brother.
on tumblr! Inspired by song "Ain't no sunshine",  Bill Withers.
“Ok, try again... To someone, who you're in love with,” gasped Dean, he couldn’t clarify it more. Now, everything should to be obvious.
“Okay. I'll bring you some clean clothes, and you take this off.” He points at his bloody shirt and leaves Cas alone.
“I know. You don't need to say anything. It's okay, Dean. I only hope you don't hate me.”
“Okay, Sammy, I’m gonna go to the grocery to get supplies. Do you need something?” he asks. They’re low on food, he used last eggs to do the breakfast.
“What?”
“I understand, but still… thank you.”
. He tries to forget about it, about the ugly monster who just kissed him without permission, but it’s too difficult. He wishes he could have kiss somebody else instead. He even knows who.
“Hi, buddy.”
He stands over the crib, looking at Jack. He is almost two weeks old, and Dean has to say that he changed a lot. He isn't so red and wrinkled now. But he is still very little and vulnerable. How is it possible that the devil child reminded him of little Sammy? Why is Jack so similar to the human baby? It would be easier if he had some horns or other diabolic shit. But he has to look so normal, only to make Dean feels guilty.
“For Dean,” repeats John after him and clinks his bottle about Cas' one. They're drinking the rest without any words.
“I-” he began, but nothing more came from his mouth.
“Better than your usually choices”
“Would you like it? To be a movie?” he asked, moving closer. Dean could feel his warm breath on his cheek. He gulped loudly, and closed his eyes for a moment, and after that turned his head to meet Cas’ eyes.
“You didn't complain before,” points Dean.
“We can do it every day, I'd like to wake up here every morning.”
Dean lies on the bed and reaches his arms to Cas.
, but she doesn’t remember anything of this. What her mother did when she asked similar question?
! This is not a way I raised you!” He tries to make him feel guilty.
The coffee shop is similar to the place where Cas was this morning with
“No, just short break.”
They have small-talk again because why not? Nobody rushes him, they can do whatever they want, and Dean really appreciate that. Lucky them!
You can find me on
“No,” says slowly Cas and looks away.
Cas looks around, he sees that somebody is sleeping in the chair.
By accident* I wrote a second part of this fic. I didn't plan it, but I hope you'll like it either!
Cas wakes up, he's alone in his room. On the chair, he finds clean clothes, Dean's ones. He takes it and goes to the bathroom, he needs to pee, even if he hates doing it. When he's dressed, he's going to look for Dean. He finds him in the bunker's kitchen, Dean's making breakfast.
“Hey, Cas, you can't sleep?” asks Dean in concern, and puts his hand on Cas' shoulder.
“Why does she react for him like this?” asks surprised Dean.
“Why? It symbolizes pure heart, and you, Dean, have it, no doubt.”
“Yeah, but where's the fun? It's not a good deal to me.”
He was serious, or it was just a one of his jokes? Understanding humans, and especially Dean, is sometimes so hard for Castiel, and that's why he's silent all the time, he waits how events will evolve.
“I’m afraid that word 'love’ doesn’t exist in Enochian. Not that kind of love. We have adoration and admiration, but it’s not the same. Angels shouldn’t have fallen in love.”
Dean takes another sip, waving his hand, but Sam doesn’t finish yet. It was just a matter of time when they need to talk, so why they wouldn’t do this now?
“With your name?” jokes Dean.
Great! And Sam was encouraging him to tell Dean about his real feelings? That's insane.
Cas thinks it is his best line. But he has some simply phrase in his head, only three words, which is even better and more beautiful. Reserved for Dean. He even said it two years ago when he almost died, but then he added quickly “I love all of you”.
The next time Dean goes to the shop, he doesn’t ask Sam if they need something. He checked it himself earlier. They have a few cans of baby formula, but diapers almost run out. The shopping is quickly, he knows exactly what they need, some food, pie, new clothes for the kid, and of course beers – a lot of them because some mystery way beer disappears very fast in the bunker. Actually, Dean wonders if Sam doesn’t pour it out to the sink because it’s impossible he drank all of this, right?
“Look at you! Mr 'I'm an Angel of the Lord and I don't serve people' is going to serve me a sandwich,” chuckles fake-Dean and grins.
This ficlet is also
Sam feels confused. Side effects? He has never... Yeah, he has never had side effects, but Dean in the other hand... Sam needs to be sure if he understood it correctly, he clears his throat before asking: “And what about Uriel?”
“I saw some place earlier, it's near to our motel,” says Sam, pointing direction. It's a lie actually because he checked where is some gay bar on purpose. He thought it could be a good opportunity to raise a subject.
Maybe both?
Dean frowns, what did it suppose to mean?
“He… I mean, Freddie, he wasn't straight, you know that?” he asks, trying to make his voice casually. It’s no big deal, just the most normal talk between brothers.
Morning kisses don't end in their bed because there's more: morning kiss in the shower, morning kiss when they're preparing breakfast, morning kiss during a coffee...
“And what about Cas?” Sam begins insecure. He hopes he doesn’t step on his personal space. “Will you tell him?”
“I can't tell you, it could be uncomfortable for you,” says Cas, lowering his eyes.
They shared hot, messy kisses until their lips were swollen. And when they pulled away to take a breath, Dean wasn’t sure what he should do now, so he said the first thing which sprung in his mind.
Castiel is avoiding Dean all day, but he can't stop thinking about Jody's words. He feels bad that he didn't respect a request. He's looking upset, and Dean sees this when he catches him finally.
“Okay. For Dean,” says Cas.
“Cas?! Cas, can you hear me?!” asks Dean in panic. They killed Djinn before, but Cas is still unconscious. He spent here five hours already!
“Cas, look at me,” he asks him, putting his hand on Cas' arm. “It's okay because it wasn't real and this... this is a proof.”
“It doesn't matter, Cas. I'm here now, right?” Dean shrugs, wanting to end this pointless discussion, but Cas has more to say.
“No.”
“Okay...” gasps Cas. “But kiss me one more time.”
Run for groceries could wait a few days more, but Dean needs a ride. So, he gets in the Impala and drives to the nearest supermarket. He's still mad at Cas, it wasn't his fault!
“I know, but if you want, just do it.”
“Excuse me,” said Cas and stood up. He went to the baby, not knowing that Dean followed him immediately.
This time, Dean was the one who shook his head like he didn't want to listen to him.
“It's nice of her,” he whispers. Dean wants to stand, but Cas grabs his wrist. He doesn't let him go away this time. “You said she sent kisses... It's a plural form.”
He forgot about tattoo for a moment, that’s why he didn’t prepare Cas for this, but Cas probably doesn’t see this as a cringy thing he did when he was drunk. They’ll be fine, like always.
The waitress comes after a few minutes and asks: “What can I get you?”
“I know.” Fake-Dean kisses him on the forehead. “I go to the garage to care the Baby, and later we can watch the movie.”
“It's danger to hold a baby near the stove. You can burn him... Just give him to me, I can take care of him for five minutes,” insisted Dean. Cas turned to him, and bit his lip as he wasn't sure if it was good idea.
Wings are huge, but also broken and devastated, these don't look like the other day in the barn where they met. He should have asked Cas if everything was right after he got his grace back, but of course, he didn't do this properly; he was too busy with his own affairs. Dean knows it will haunt his dreams forever, he deserves that. He deserves for every nightmare because he didn't protect him.
“Okay. I think it's a good idea. If you want, I can take care of him more often. You're still doing most of the job, you're the great father by the way, so I can unburden you a little.”
“You kissed me!”
“Umm, really? You want to read some of my craps?” Dean seems to be surprised, and he doesn’t even realize that he confirmed these are poems indeed.
You can find me on
“How do you sleep? No more nightmares?” he asks, and Cas nods.
There’s ’T'estimo’ when they finish a case.
When he’s a human, it hits harder. All emotions, all feelings… It’s painful, he understands finally, recognizing what all of this means. But then, it’s even worse because after Dean kicks him out of the bunker, Cas knows that he could never love him this way…
You can find me on
“Hey, Cas, wake up.” Cas opens his eyes. “It's just a nightmare. You're safe.”
“Wait!” he says quickly, and before he has time to think about it, he adds: “Can you do this again?”
“It's a baby! Do you understand? A baby, human baby!” he tries again. Dean is in mourning, but so is he. It doesn’t give him rights to kill a newborn only to cope with his grief!
The door opens, Cas is back, so Dean murmurs something about a shower and immediately closes himself in the bathroom.
“Oh, sorry if I went too far, but yes, I think you're adorable…”
Cas is in love with Dean. That's the fact, no doubts. Of course, he has never said it loud, so nobody knows about it... Nobody except the most of the angels, a couple of demons, and anybody else who has eyes and isn't named Dean Winchester.
He didn't forget, he's just such an asshole. Cas clenches his fist, but doesn't say anything. Of course, only for five seconds...
“You are special to me, Dean. You'll always be special...” he whispers and makes one step closer. Their noses are almost touching. Dean touches Cas' cheek and brushes his lips with his thumb.
Cas smiled, and Dean blinked a few times. What the hell it supposed to mean? Cas gave him a card on purpose? It wasn’t any mistake?
Fans are screaming.
“He's dead because of you... But I forgive you. I forgive you, Jack. And I'll do everything to raise you for a good man because he believed in you. And I believed in him...” he whispers and gives the baby a little kiss on the forehead. He runs his fingers through a short Jack's hair, and he gets a cute smile in exchange. Dean takes a deep breath and tells a few more words: “I love you, Jack.”
“It's good,” says Cas, but he feels a tension in the air. He knows something is wrong, but he can't guess what exactly. “Dean, is there something you're not telling me?”
One hour later, they are in the car. Three of them, driving to their home.
“Guess again.”
“Yes, and then you’re spending a few hours, waiting for help. In the middle of the case,” He pointed.
These freakin' blue eyes! Why wouldn't he have picked some ugly vessel? Probably, it wouldn't have helped because it's not that Dean cares only about appearance. Cas is hot 'cause it's Cas. A little messy, sometimes stupid, but also cute, funny, smart… with a too much heart. Sexy look is only a nice bonus.
“I suppose the same reason as you…” Cas nods, and Dean does the same. It’s not the good time to say it loud, but maybe one day, they will be brave enough to speak their truth. “You should rest.”
“I don't understand,” says Castiel, titling his head and frowning. He speaks for the first time, Dean almost forgot he was there too.
“I’m not sure…”
“Hey, Cas...” says Dean, walking in.
As his father. But instead of him, he got two hunters, and one of them is actually a shitty parent. None kid, even a son of Satan, deserve for having Dean Winchester as a father.
“I’m baking an apple pie for you,” he answers. “My apologies, Dean.”
“So, why is your face pinky?”
“Dammit,” Dean murmurs. Good that kiddo didn't pee on his face, but still, it's annoying that it happened at all. Dean throws a shirt on the floor, it can wait for laundry, and comes back to Jack. “And what, you think you're funny?”
“I think everything is good. This Dean is more open to collaboration. We have a date, I think it's a date. But I'm not sure what I should to wear.”
“And stop saying 'of course' for everything I say.”
“Very much... They remind me about Jack.”
Dean chuckles and feels how his face turns red.
“Wait, your nice dream was about kissing me?” Cas face turns pink, but he says nothing. Dean chuckles. “I think we should check one more time if it's real.” Dean kisses him once again, and this time, Cas responses with the same energy. “And what do you think?”
“Yes,” says Cas. “I just want to inform you that I had sexual intercourse with Dean last night. Of course, it wasn't the first time.”
Cas nods, still smiling. How is it possible that this usually grumpy angel smiles all the time? Dean has never seen him like this before, it’s very refreshing, but also sad because real Cas isn’t so happy with him. They always fight with some Big Bad Wolf, the happy life isn’t for them. No apple pie in the real world.
“And? What is a conclusion?”
“No, Cas. She can't. Lucifer killed her,” he interrupts him. The anger makes that all happiness left him.
“For loving you.”
Cas left Dean a card that he and Jack went for a walk. It wasn't necessary because when they came back, Dean was still sleeping. Cas was staring at him like a hundred times before, he looked so calmly, lying on his stomach. Cas knew he was sleeping this way only if he felt safe.
“Dean…” Just a name. It’s enough to say that he cares about him, but also not too much to embarrass him.
Everything changes in one evening when he sits at the map table with some old manuscript. Dean is talking on the phone for a few minutes before he hangs up.
“I know, he takes a hot chocolate with a whipped cream and toffee sauce. It would be perfect for someone who is so adorable!” chuckles Dean.
“You heard about me before? That's good, it's gonna be easier then,” she says and smiles ugly. “You know, you're not here for the first time, Castiel. I don't understand why you're so special. Why are you coming back to Earth over and over again? But there’s one thing I'm certainly sure. I know you woke me up, and I don't like it. I find it pretty annoying.”
Cas shuts Dean’s mouth with a kiss. He puts his hands on his face, and kisses him softly and slowly. And Dean starts kissing him back.
Dean grins and whispers: “With pleasure.”
“Hey, Cas, can I come in?” asks Dean after he knocked to Cas' room.
Next chapter! Thank you for every comment <3
Time is different here, so he can go back to Dean at once. He tries to find him with his powers, and he's so surprised because Dean is in... Brazil?
He does what he says. And when Cas is ready, he guides him to the room next to his own.
Cas comes closer, wrapping his arms tight around Dean and resting his head on his chest, close to his heart.
Cas nods, he understands why he didn’t know about it earlier. Dean started playing guitar when he was gone…
“The very touch of my corrupts…”
“I-I thought I'll stay until I convince you to come back with me... But we know it's not gonna happen, so I can go whenever you want.”
“No. I don’t wanna risk. He could look at me different after that. You know, he could have some conclusions.”
“One more word, Dean, and you'll get nothing.” Cas tries to be serious, but he can't remove a big grin from his face.
“It was from me,” explains Cas.
“Lover,” says Cas.
“Night, Sammy,” murmurs Dean.
“Dean, I don't want to argue. Just trust me, everything is fine.”
Dean shakes his head. No, it's not. Nothing is okay.
Cas looks stunning, even if he didn't do too much with his appearance. He's still wearing the trench coat, some things never changed.
“I would love to, Dean.”
“It sounds disgusting.” Dean grosses out. He doesn't even use sugar in his coffee.
He's watching them, but actually, he's focused only on Dean. He sees his mouth when it formulates sweet nothings and gives a little insincere smiles. He sees his hand which touches her naked arm. He sees his eyes which are staring at her rack, Dean doesn't maintain eye-contact with that woman more than a few seconds. The thought that he and Dean can be looking into each other eyes for a long time comforts him a little, but it's still not enough. Cas knows he could never have him, and it hurts every time he sees Dean with somebody else.
“Shoot. Nothing can surprise me.”
“But I don't want to… I'm afraid, what can I see when I close my eyes.”
He was right, he’s dealing with a ghost. It’s a spirit of an old nurse from the closed mental hospital. Unfortunately, she was cremated after she died, so Dean needs to go to an abandoned building at night and find a thing which keeps her on Earth.
“Come back with me, please. I promise I won't hurt you again. And I promise I'll do my best to help you with Jack.”
Dean chuckles, but he's going to be annoying older brother, so he continues his speech.
“Oh… Yes, I would like to.” Cas nods enthusiastically.
“He didn't say it back, Cas. He wasn't real. He wasn't
“Very much.”
“Cas are you okay?” he asks. Cas is silence at first, but he speaks after a few seconds.
Did he say it loud? Dean takes his hand away and clears his throat. “You need to rest, we'll talk tomorrow.”
You can find it
“Since now… So? Do you want to make love with me?” Cas asks one more time.
“Okay, we're gonna talk about it later.”
“What the hell are you doing, Cas?!” asks Dean, walking into the kitchen. Cas jumps, dropping a full cup on the ground. Coffee spills everywhere, and a cup, Cas' favorite, the one with a cat on it, break into a million pieces.
“That I’m in love with him.” He can’t believe he said it loud. But it happened, and Sam can do whatever he wants with it.
“I'm a genderless being, you could say I'm non-binary,” says Cas, and John frowns his eyebrows. He doesn't understand what was an angel talking about. “I could have a female vessel, Jack could change this, but you know,
, I wanna talk with him in private.”
Dean falls on the floor, chocking and breathing hard. He almost died. And actually, he regrets that it was only 'almost'.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered and turned his head finally. Dean looked for his eyes, in the kitchen’s lighting they were even more blue and brighter than usual, and Dean could notice something truly angelic in Cas’ face.
Dean’s heart is pounding like a jackhammer, he has no idea what he’s going to say. He doesn’t have a speech, and even if he had one, nothing could be a such beautiful like Cas’ words.
“What happened with Lucifer?”
Nothing is okay.
“Oh. You mean kissing? Like in the movie?”
“Charlie. Do you think she's broken?” asks Sam, and it’s the first time when Dean gives him a quick glance.
“He was an angel.”
“Heya, Sammy!”
“We're sorting these by age rage. You can find some on the left.” She points at one shelf, Dean comes there and reads labels. “Anything else?”
“You look perfect!”
Sam opens his mouth and points at Dean like he wants to say, ‘I told that!’.
Again no answer. It must mean 'yes'.
Dean overcomes the distance between them in one step, wraps his hands around Cas' neck and press his lips to Cas'.
“All right, all right…”
“Me?” Dean is surprised how strange his voice sounds. He clears his throat after that, but doesn’t say anything more. Cas is still staring at the same page for a moment. Finally, he closes the magazine.
It’s his third bottle, when Sam comes to the room. Dean has his legs on the map table, trying to relax.
“Never mind, Cassie. Never mind.”
Dean is done, he can only think about Cas' dead body, and about Mary, and even about Crowley. And he really doesn't want to do this. Everybody is dead because of this damn kid. And because of him… He didn't save them. He didn't save anyone.
There's silence between them for a long time, Sam is the first one who breaks it, clearing his throat and asking the question: “Dean, what are we gonna do now?”
“Dean...”
Dean woke up half an hour later, and he met with Cas in the kitchen.
“Oh, sorry, Dean,” says Cas, loosing his grip. “It wasn't my intention to embarrass you.”
Dean's drinking schedule looks different these days. Earlier he drank every day, now he does it only in the evening when Sam takes care of Jack, what gives him three or four times per week. When he drinks, he's closing himself in his room with a few bottles of beer and something stronger for the end. He doesn't want to hear how Sam's complaining. He always drinks how many he can, until he passes out.
“You don't understand. Left shoulder. It must be the left shoulder, not the right one.” Dean starts cutting vegetables again, meanwhile he continues his thought. “It's… Okay, now that stupid part, it's the same arm where Cas left a handprint.” His voice is trembling when be speaks the angel's name. They didn't talk about Cas after they burnt his body.
“Sure, just drink all day and don’t care of anything…” murmurs Sam what pisses Dean off even more.
At the end of the day, they lie on the bed again, kissing with the same fondness as all day. And after the last kiss, Dean is the first one who whispers “I love you”. Cas always answers the same.
“It's tradition!” says Dean in a menacing tone. Every Sunday they're having family barbecue. They're meeting together in his parents' house.
“Umm, yes?” Dean looks at him a little confused, but things clear up a moment later.
“And what do you have today? Roses?” he changed subject.
Dean kisses him slowly and softly, he wants to feel his taste. And Cas… He tastes so good… like an angel.
He kisses Cas' cheek slowly again. And again. And again. Meanwhile, Cas is closing his eyes. Dean kisses also his forehead, twice. And then his eyelids. And the tip of his nose. He is kissing all of Cas' face. The angel is very pleased, he has so adorable silly smile on his face, and Dean can't resist to kiss his pinky lips either. First, he touches Cas' cheek, rubbing his skin with a thumb gently, and later he just does it. He doesn't want to scare him, so the kiss is short and innocent. Cas opens his eyes, looking into the green one.
Bobby tries to attack Cas from the back, but he's faster, he needs just to touch Bobby's forehead to win a fight.
“I… really? That’s why you were talking about all these craps?” he asks, raising his hand to caresses Cas’ cheek.
“Jack did this?” asks Cas, still not stopping looking at the cartoon versions of them.
“You love me,” he whispers
.. Even
“Cas, did you mean it?” he repeats the question, louder this time.
“What do you mean?” asks Cas innocently, but he starts being stress out. He doesn’t want this conversation.
“And he's cool with that? It doesn't scare the shit out of him?” It's still just a baby, but maybe he has no idea it's something unusual.
Sam gasps and turns to Dean, giving him an irritated look.
“So, can I?” he asks.
“It’s so good to have you here, man,” he says, and Cas knows he means it.
Castiel made a lot of mistakes, some of them he will be regretting for the rest of his life. And one of this will be the day when he trusted Metatron and made that angels fell.
“I have something for you. A gift.”
Cas wasn't anybody's job. He was the one who needed to carry too much all the time. He didn't have time to ask about that because in the other room a baby started crying. Dean turned his head to the noise source, but didn't comment on it.
“If you say you're sorry once again, I'll break your nose,” he interrupts him. Too tough. Dammit! Why does Cas make everything so difficult?
“Something woke me up. From the place where angels go after they die. I-I could be a little too much annoying and…” He doesn't finish the sentence because Dean crosses a distance between them and gives him a hug. He's sure it's his Cas. He's sure he's really here.
“Yeah, but I mean at nights. Where is he now?”
“Oh, okay. Umm, I hope you’re gonna feel better soon.”
“Ouch! Not about me? I gave them to you!” he mocked, and it made that Cas smiled even more.
“And what about Cas?” asks Dean with hope.
“No,” he answers honestly and drinks another shot. “But I'm not gonna talk about this.”
They're staring at each other for a moment longer, Cas is still smiling, and Dean can't help to do the same.
“Yeah, I'm not sure about that,” laughs Dean bitterly.
“But, first, you got to put everything back the way it was. The people, the birds, Cas. You got to bring him back,” yells Dean to Chuck. He needs to say this because it would be rude to not mention Cas even once. Dean knows deeply in his heart that Chuck will refuse, but he says it anyway. Typical Dean.
“Wait, are you looking at Pottery Barn catalogue?” Dean chuckles and sits next to him, just to see what exactly he’s doing.
“No!” he shouts quickly, scared that the angel will take it away from him. “You... Umm, thank you.”
After he finishes the sentence, they can hear the other voice, the baby one.
“I'm like Freddie.” It's the only thing comes from Dean's mouth. He's staring on the road, hands on the wheel, his knuckles turn white
“So do you.”
“Oh, Dean, it's very polite of you, but you don't have to...”
“Hello, Clarence,” says the well-known voice.
“What?”
Cas comes closer to Dean and hugs him in front of Sam’s salad. Sam almost chokes.
“I'm sorry, Cas, it wasn't on purpose. Let me help you with cleaning.” Dean squats and grabs the biggest piece of glass. “So... what were you doing?”
When Cas is ready, he looks at Dean with confusion, tilting his head a little, but he doesn’t say a word.
“I… Mary… Mom, she's… She's dead, Cas.”
Sam and Eileen are together? Peachy. And he's here either? He feels relief that he's a part of Cas' happiness.
“I forgot,” he said and started to back off. “Sorry for wasting your time.”
The taste of Gorgon’s mouth doesn’t disappear right away. Cas can feel something clammy and toxic -
When he comes back to the kitchen fifteen minutes later, Dean finishes preparing a breakfast. Jack is lying in a baby seat on the table. They’re eating in uncomfortable silence, Dean is the first one, who speaks, after they finish their coffee and put dirty dishes into the sink.
Cas nods, but says nothing, and it hurts Dean even more. He would prefer if Cas frowned his brows and maybe even was angry at him. The silence isn’t a good sign.
“What's wrong?” asks Dean. “You don't like it?”
“Hello, Dean,” he said ultimately, but still didn’t look at him. And it was the worst, Dean wanted so bad Cas to look at him like he always does. Just to make sure that they’ll be okay.
But no. This time is different, he's in the dark bunker's room. Dean's
Cas is confused, he tilts his head and looking at Dean like he wants to understand.
“You didn't lie, boy, he really looks like an angel.” Dean's face turned red, and he mumbled something.
“No, Dean. I don't have time for this, but I'd like to do some research.”
John gives him one bottle. They're sitting for the moment in silence, sipping beers.
The waitress goes away for their orders. Cas tilts his head.
“Yes, I know. She's dead. Like everybody else, don't lie to yourself, Sammy.”
He seems to be scared that Cas will deny, but nothing like that happens. Instead, Cas nods.
“No, it’s not.”
Why did he even think like that?! He couldn't hate him, not when he loves him.
“Shut up, jerk!”
“Sure thing! Of course, you can.” He hands him a baby carefully, Cas puts one hand under Jack’s head, and the other one he holds his whole body. Jack looks at Cas with his big blue eyes, and he’s completely silent, but after a few seconds he smiles like he just recognizes him as someone familiar.
It's a middle of the night, Mary wakes up and walks to the kitchen to drink some water. The lights are already on because Castiel sits at the table and contemplates in silence.
“Of course, Dean. I'm sorry.”
“Dean, I don’t need…” starts Cas, but some other voice interrupts him. One of the clients comes closer to say ‘hi’, and Dean doesn’t miss the opportunity. Even then when Cas looks at him with fear and shakes his head discreetly.
After the Empty took Cas, Dean touches his typewriter only once.
“And now, you're sarcastic.”
Cas took only a few steps before he remembered what he was looking for. He turned around and went to Dean's room again.
Cas doesn't say anything, he's just staring with that damn half-smile. And his eyes tells
“Dean, we need to talk. Alone,” he says serious, giving Dean a piercing stare.
“Okay… I think.”
“I- No, of course, I do. I… Maybe we pin it on the fridge?” He points at the drawing.
“Sure! Bye, give Dean a kiss for me,” says Jody and hangs up before Castiel reacts for her words.  He seems to be surprised, he has to do what?! Why did Jody ask him about that
“Hello, Dean.”
“Cas? Why did you mention him?”
“Yes, Cas. Forever.”
“I… No, he wasn't,” he admits, but he’s still not convinced. Sam just nods, he realizes that Dean need time.
, but why can he feel a warm body next to him?
Cas said nothing, he made his decision long time ago, even before Jack was born.
“Of course, I have to! You think I let you starve here?”
Cas frowns, he showed him wings earlier. Why doesn’t he believe him?
On the picture are three people, Dean recognizes them immediately. Jack is the tiny one, Cas has his blue tie, of course, and Dean has green eyes and the gun – shit, he should be more careful and doesn’t show weapons to Jack. But there’s something else, which makes that Dean frowns.
"I've never been on a date,” Cas says it casually, still staring at the screen, but something in his voice shifted. Dean can hear sadness and craving, it's difference than five minutes ago when Cas was commenting the movie very excited.
“Yeah, I know, it's on purpose,” he explains, but Cas still isn't convinced. He's staring at his knee when he asks the next question.
“Mornin' sunshine, it's for you.” Dean took new flowers from behind his back.
“Okay,” He says eventually. “I’ll tell him.”
“Maybe you should start?”
“Nothing.”
He doesn't talk about that with Cas anymore, but he's waiting for some opportunity to ask Dean about this. Of course, he won't betray Cas, and he certainly won't say about an angel's feelings to his brother. He just needs to know if Dean is into guys. Sam believes he is because he sees his older brother how he reacts for men sometimes.
“Cas, you were dead. You died for Jack. You died to protect him, and it's the greatest sacrifice a man… or an angel can make. You're here now, and that's important. So, how 'bout coming back to home, huh?”
“Wh-Why didn't you back at once?” he asks.
It's not the first time when Cas asks about it. And he does it with a concern, love… Why didn't Dean see this before?
“Yeah? And how did that feel?” he asks.
Cas knocks quietly, not sure if Dean isn't asleep already.
“Dean… About what Sam said earlier, I'm glad that I belong to our family,” he whispers.
There's a plushie bee, and he feels a sting in his heart. Cas would love this, and he'd probably buy it for Jack. But Cas isn't here, and Dean needs to do this for him. He takes a toy and put it in the trolley, not thinking too much about it. The rest of shopping is faster, he takes some meat, eggs, bread, vegetables for Sam, a few cans of soup, a lot of beer and of course a pie; apple, strawberry and some new flavor – peach with caramel.
“Come with me,” whispers Dean, not looking at him. He’s feeling he might chicken out if he sees these blue eyes now. Cas feels insecure, but he goes anyway without hesitation.
“Dean, are you going to teach me how to cook?” he asks with full mouth.
“I want to. You have no idea, how much I want to. But I can't risk that...” he stopped. He almost said it, but he knew it would hurt Dean. Even if it was the truth.
Dean clears his throat and takes a deep breath: “You changed me too, Cas. You’ve shown me how to be the best version of myself. And when I was thinking that everything was a lie, you’ve shown me that there was still hope because we were still real.”
Bad thing: he starts flirting with dudes for him.
“I can't... But maybe one day...”
“Dean, you're not obligated to do this. It was a nice thing, but it's not necessary. And I know, you were busy.”
Cas buries his face in the crook of Dean’s neck.
And it was just like in the movies.
“Only if you mean it...”
“And I don't wear so ridiculous clothes.”
“I would love to hear that. Has he some powers?”
Dean sits and turns around to look at him. Cas bites his lip and stares at Dean, he's totally lost.
“Cas.”
Cas gives Jack a kiss on the forehead and Jack walks away. He looks at him as a loving parent always looks at their kid.
“I can't speak for Dean...”
“Why wouldn't he? He chose Cas as his protector, right?” finishes Sam, and Dean nods.
“Balthazar said it's not his favorite movie, so I have the other idea. I think about 'Thelma & Louise',” says Cas.
“He’s in my room. Let’s go!”
“I'm so sorry, Dean,” he mumbles, pulling away. He went too far, Dean was clear that he doesn't want to do this anymore. He adds quickly: “It will never happen again. I'll move out as fast as it’s possible. I talked with Sam about that already, he'll help me find some apartment and a job.”
“No, of course not. You're still the same man who raised me, but... I want you to feel comfortable with yourself.”
Dean is mad, and Cas can feel it. He really wants to convince him that it's no big deal, but whatever he says, Dean turns it in a bad thing.
Cas takes a gift with shaking hands. He stares at it like he doesn't believe that Dean really gave him it.
Dean grabs the photo and at the same moment the nurse is here again. He wants to shoot her, but the ghost is quicker. She takes him by the throat with one hand and pins him against the wall. He can’t catch a breath, and for the moment he thinks it’s over. He’s going to die here, alone in an abandoned hospital. The photography is still in his hand. Everything happens really fast, Dean acts out of the instinct. He pulls a lighter out from the pocket and with one click, he sets fire to the picture. Ghost screams one more time, but the grip isn’t so tight now. A nurse disappears into the flame.
And when they're riding the Ferris Wheel, he closes his eyes, just to focus on this smell. During the steep downhill, Cas grabs Dean's elbow without a word and doesn't let it go till the end of the ride.
“So, maybe I'll try.”
Cas is avoiding him all day. Dean isn't sure if he left his room for a minute, so he asks Sam to bring to Cas some breakfast. He explains that Cas must be tired because of Djinn.
Cas smiles, he has never been so happy during his entire life.
“This is Cas,” said Dean on the next Monday. “Cas, this is Jude.”
“You woke up. Before me,” says Cas after they pull away.
“No, we’re not.”
“No, that’s all.”
Dean gets up from his chair and moves closer to Cas, he sits next to him, and his left hand finds Cas’ back. He starts rubbing little circles with his thumb.
“Actually, why do you have a bed, you don't sleep.”
First, they go to these small, silly cars. Dean feels awkward, but there's a lot of adults, so he relaxes a little bit. Cas is enjoying driving the car, and after a few minutes he bumps purposely in Dean's car.
“Even if I'll be annoying, and you'll kick me on the couch?”
He pulls away after a few seconds and blinks twice. Something is wrong.
“Nearly a month.”
“Cas, will you make me an honor and go there with me tonight?” asks Dean, and Cas nods enthusiastically. He looks like he wanted to ask the same.
“Yes, Dean?”
“So?” asks Charlie after they left the barn. Cas goes to the Impala, and Dean can’t take his eyes off him.
“I… What is it like?”
“No! It's nothing like that,” shouts Dean quickly.
“He chose you to be his dad. He's gonna love you!”
“It's because of what I said earlier to Sam. That's why you're angry at me? I didn't know, I shouldn't have talked about this.”
Dean is driving, and his thoughts are messy. Sometimes, he eyed on Cas who is really sleeping now, but then he looks on the road again. After a half of an hour, he takes off his jacket and asks Sam to cover Cas with it.
“I know I'm a crappy hunter, and that situation with a woman… I didn't want to upset you, and now you're angry at me…” explains Cas. His voice is calmly and quietly, but Dean hears also something like… sadness?
on tumblr!
“No, I mean it. I won't have my own kid…”
“Thank you, Dean. It's very nice of you. They're beautiful.”
“Oh, don’t be boring! Just come up with something!”
“Oh, come on! Jody wouldn't ask you something wrong!”
The first time, Dean gave Cas flowers, it was just a joke.
Cas puts his other hand on the back of Dean's neck, running his fingers through his hair. Dean feels chills around his spine and gasps quietly.
“Oh, shit… Okay, we'll figured out something else. Sam has some fruits in the fridge, I'll make you a smoothie,” he decides.
His prayer haven’t been answered because Cas didn’t leave subject. Otherwise, he seemed to be interested in Dean’s…
“I had a good teacher.”
They get in the car, and Dean pulls his phone out from his pocket to make a call to Sam. He uses speakerphone. Sam picks up after a few seconds.
“Do you have a date, Dean?” he asked, tilting his head. And maybe it was crazy, but Dean heard disappointment in his voice. But why Cas would be upset because of some stupid date?
“Dean?” Cas mumbles and blinks twice in confusion.
Dean finds some excuse, and turns around to leave the kitchen. This is the moment when Cas can see another tear in his trousers. The big one, revealing his green boxers and curves of his ass. For a second, he wants to inform Dean about it, but eventually, he shrugs and doesn't say anything. It must be fashionable... And actually, it's a pretty nice view.
He smiles to himself, it's a good thing. Loving Dean is a wonderful feeling, and the thought that one day he could say to him, the perfect man alive, that he, the fallen angel, fell in love with him is even better because Dean deserves to be loved.
For @floral-cas on her
There is something judging in the tone of her voice, but she sounds also worried.
“Dean…”
“He was very similar to you, but... he was with me. I think he... he loved me.”
“Yeah, right… I just wanted to let you know. About Freddie.”
He bought some time, now he needs to find a photo again. He kneels on the floor, looking for a picture, there are the tones of other papers. Finally, he sees it!
“Cas, I need to ask you something. Who is Dean for you? I mean for real.”
“Not on purpose, dumbass. He’s a little, he doesn't control these things yet. I always use terry nappies,” he explains. “I'll show you how to do this properly.”
Okay, Cas appears in Brazil. Dean is wearing weird clothes, but he's still hot, so Cas doesn't care. AU!Dean whistles when he sees a devastatingly handsome angel.
You can find me on
Sam clears his throat, trying to save the situation: “Oh, Jody, did you talk with Claire recently?”
“I…” starts Cas, and it looks like he wanted to say, that he don’t eat, but of course, Dean reminds to himself that he’s not angel here. He says instead: “Yes.”
“Risk what?” asked Dean, not understanding anything. From his perspective it wasn't any risk, Cas and Jack will be safe in the bunker, that's all, simple fact.
“Oh, you were coming to kiss me.”
“Lots of things, actually.”
“About people, bad decisions, the biggest regrets...” he says, gasping. These aren't nice thoughts, but in the dark night they just comes to his mind. Mostly, he's trying to think about more pleasant things like his family. He thinks about Sam, Jack, Mary, and of course, about Dean. He appreciates every moment which he spends with him. Sometimes he just has Dean's image in his head. Green eyes, freckles, honest smiles when they're watching some movie...
“Jeez, Cas, it's not poisoned. If I wanted to kill you, I would find some fancy way.” Cas still doesn't believe him, so Dean takes a spoon in his hand and tries some of the gruel. “See? I'm alive. It's good and sweet, strawberry flavor. It will be okay for your throat.”
” start the familiar voice. Dean’s heart skips the beat. It can’t be true, he prayed to Chuck, and he was ignored, it must be some trick, Cas can’t be back, right? And even if everything tells him somebody makes fun of him, he believes, he
“You know, Dean, I still feel the poison.”
Sam walks away, and Dean with hesitation takes his phone to saw a message – picture where he looks so soft, holding a little baby. He sees a tired face with wrinkles in the edge of the eye. When the hell he became so old? But there’s also something which he could describe as care… or maybe even love. He saves the photo on his phone, and after that he looks at Jack. It’s actually pretty and cute baby, he should have more pictures, especially because he’s growing up so fast. Since then, Dean starts doing a photo of Jack every day.
“What was that?” asks Sam.
“Umm... It's weenie,” she says finally. Dean laughs because a new word sounds so silly to him.
Coda to 10x16!
Cas is holding a poem as the most fragile thing in the universe, it’s priceless treasure for him. He can feel paper’s structure under his fingertips. He reads a title 'Blue’ and feels how his heart skips a beat. He remembers this title, he saw it after they had come from the Purgatory.
When Cas was a human, he didn't have grace, and he still had the same impact on him. Or maybe even stronger.
“You won't. You'll always be part of the family, Cas. And nothing can change it. But I still think you should to tell him. Who knows what happen next?”
“Dean, I'm...”
“Oh, he didn't tell you how we met? I gripped him tight and raised him from perdition.”
“I wish you would be real…” whispers Dean. Cas frowns confused and opens his mouth like he would like to tell something, but before he does say any word, everything disappears, and they wake up.
No, it wasn't. But Cas knew it wasn't all the truth, not really. He would've been delighted if Dean was worried about him, but he didn't expect that. It's not like he was so important that anybody could care about him. And there was also Jack, they hated him only because he was Lucifer's son, but for Cas, he was his kid, and he would do everything to protect him. Anyway, Dean didn't drive six hours from Lebanon just to "check on him". Maybe something bad happened? Maybe Sam is hurt? And Cas can heal him?
Dean feels uncomfortable with that. Cas shouldn't have thanked him, especially not when he doesn't know all the truth. Dean was a shitty parent, guardian, or whatever to call that. He let Jack down more than once.
“He's my best friend,” he answers slowly, tilting his head a little and frowning.
“I wish you would be real…” whispers Cas and gasps quietly. He feels so good in Dean's arms.
“It’s not true, Dean. I fell. Once.”
“Bitch!”
“Sammy, what did you tell to Cas?” asked Dean after he found his brother in his room. Sam was eating some vegetables’ crap and doing research on the internet.
Dean’s walk isn’t too much longer. Jack falls asleep immediately he feels a fresh air, and after a quarter of an hour of spending time in the forest, he comes back. But he thinks he should be doing it more often.
They kiss again, and fake-Dean goes away. Cas is standing there a few second more, still smiling, and then he moves to the kitchen.
Dean swallows hard, the Adam’s apple lifts and lowers uneasy. There’s silence between them for the moment, Cas is the one who starts talking again.
