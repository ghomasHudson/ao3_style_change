“Chain, so no one can cut it,” Sherlock said with a single nod of approval as he fastened the two-inch-wide leather band over John’s wrist.
“Agreed,” Mycroft said quickly, and both John and the car came to an abrupt halt, much to the annoyance of the taxi driver, who was still half hanging out of his cab.
“Exactly, I want the best of both worlds, and I want it all with you by my side,” Sherlock confirmed, sliding over the gap between them and resting his head on John’s chest. He reached up and stroked the length of red rope around his neck, then added more quietly, “this is like an anchor for me. It holds me down in a sea of information.”
With his moment of weakness behind him, John selected Sherlock’s second-best dressing gown. He sighed happily as the soft silk caressed his skin.
It went unspoken that John’s oath had already been dragged through the mud more than once thanks to the war, but exceptions were always made during wartime, and John was not immune to them. Also, there was the cabbie, who had nearly killed Sherlock on their first case together. However, Sherlock had the good grace not to point out the flaws of John’s statement.
“Yeah, I… god, my prostate.” John managed to mutter, flapping one hand absently in the air when words failed him.
“Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?” John asked, getting straight to the point and hoping he wouldn’t come across as being rude.
“Six months ago,” John announced, breaking her gaze and turning to look at Sherlock, “that was when the cabbie was running loose on the city. Think that had anything to do with this? Maybe she ended up in his cab?”
“Recent enough. After university and my relationship with Victor - who I will tell you about at another time - ended, I began to dabble in some of the seedier clubs London has to offer. I was already experimenting with drugs at that time and wasn’t fully sober when I agreed to be a slave for my first Master.” Sherlock caught the murderous look in John’s eyes and held out a hand placatingly, “Before you get on your suit of armour and jump on your white horse, I need to clarify something. It wasn’t rape, so please put that out of your head. However, during a scene, my body served one purpose only, and scenes could last hours or days.”
“Another one of the girls didn’t show up last night. This time, I have a name. After the last incident, I asked my staff to learn their names. Perhaps it’s a breach of privacy, but they copied down their names on a piece of paper, which we keep behind the bar.”
"So what then, we let him walk free?" John asked angrily, his voice a deep growl matching the scowl on his face.
Holmes brothers at the same game. Perhaps, he could have the aid of Mycroft at his back, while supporting Sherlock with his plan. Rather than run around half informed.
Nodding, John took another sip of water and motioned for Sherlock to continue. They could discuss their relationship once all cards had been placed on the table. Though, his heart did skip a beat at Sherlock’s words.
This chapter is a bit slow but important. I wanted to highlight (again) that neither of them are entering into this lightly.
As the man gripped the back of his head, Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and uttered a prayer to the one person he knew could save him.
“How’s that plug doing?” John asked, winking over at Jesper who didn’t seem at all phased by the two men as he began taking measurements.
"Yeah well," John huffed, "Not everyone is so willing to watch you put your life on the line. You expect me to knowingly, and
“You know, I was hoping you’d be brattier than you’ve been for me,” John said as he took the tags and slipped the chain over Sherlock’s neck. “Part of me still clings to the hope that your easy submission is just because this is new.”
“That’s an order I enjoy following,” Sherlock grinned, his expression mirroring John’s as the gap between them closed and they shared personal space. John’s hands automatically went to the small of Sherlock’s back while Sherlock’s arms snaked under John’s armpits, broad hands splaying across his shoulder blades. The kiss was quick but heavy with lust and the desire to be close after temporary separation.
“Hold them there,” John ordered, then something brushed up against him, and the weight of one of the bars was attached first to one wrist, then the other. “Now put that bar behind your head, like you’re carrying a yolk. Your arms are not to move from that position, again barring emergencies, until I release them.”
“Submissive, make me come now, or I swear to god you’ll spend the rest of the weekend in chastity, unable to touch me until I get home from the clinic on Monday. You already have one punishment coming to you after this, don’t make it worse.” John’s voice was dangerously low. When Sherlock dared to look up, he saw John staring down at him with steel in his eyes. With a cock in his mouth, he couldn’t verbally acknowledge he understood, so he did the next best thing. He stopped teasing, and in one motion, had John seated against the back of his throat.
“Yeah, yeah, you do.” John panted, watching through blond lashes as Sherlock tore open the condom then stared at his cock. “Let me?” John offered, realizing that there was a strong possibility that Sherlock had never put one on before. He took the condom and expertly rolled it onto Sherlock’s length before leaning back on his elbows. “Where do you want me?”
“I’d like to make love to you. To show you how it should be, between two people who love each other. Like what you did for me the other day. But if last night was too much…”
“Mm, you’re giving me too much credit. Just yours, I think. I haven’t been this attuned to my previous partners.” John’s finger stroked its way down the bridge of Sherlock’s nose, then slid over Sherlock’s cupid’s bow. “There’s just something about you. You try so hard to hide your emotional responses, except for when you’re with me. I can read them like an open book, every twitch of your lip, or arch of your brow means something. All I have to do is watch and listen.”
“Well, I was texting Zed earlier,” John said with a sly smile, “and he and I are going to do a bit of a joint demonstration later if you’re willing. That, and I
“Sorry, Gents, but no bodily fluids in my cab, please. Just tell me where you need to be, and I’ll get you there post-haste.”
John ran his hand down Sherlock’s back once more, then turned his back to the crowd so no one could see his mouth.
smaller than his. Even in its fully erect state. John knew that was childish of him, but it didn’t stop him from taking pleasure in it. He and John made eye contact as the man traced a line around the underside of Sherlock’s collar.
“Mmm, that was the point. Oh, would you take this for the evening? The designer failed to leave room in these trousers for even a single pocket.” Sherlock asked, sliding his phone across the table.
Sherlock had been worried that clear access to the key would be a temptation. But as he toyed with the collar, twisting his body, so his reflection shifted in the mirror, he realized he had no desire to remove John’s claim on him.
“Fine,” John grumped, “but only because it’s starting to rain. Drop me off at the nearest Tescos, not one halfway across town, and we can talk on the way. Not a moment longer.”
“Good God, Watson, how I’ve missed you.” Zed laughed and took his hand off the gearshift to slap John on the thigh.
“Bed, John,” Sherlock hummed, bending down and dragging his teeth over John’s right shoulder. He released his grip on John’s cock, and with his other hand against his chest, pushed John to the bed.
“Great, here’s Lestrade’s card. He’ll probably have you go in and chat with Sergeant Donovan. She’s a bit of an arsehole to the unique, but she’s good at her job. If she calls you a freak, just ignore her. That’s what Sherlock does.”
He allowed the sensation of John's fingers to remain as a distant echo, unable to banish it altogether. Not that he had wanted to, or had tried very hard. The faint tingle became a distant thrum of pleasure that pulsed through him with every beat of his heart. His own cock stiffened between his legs and it took every ounce of willpower to keep his hands from stroking himself.
“Cotton,” he said by way of explanation, “Probably best we don’t let it get wet. We can put it back on later if you’re still willing.”
her, though.” John’s voice cracked; picking up a stack of more recent, less yellowed papers, he wiped the corner of his eyes on his shoulder. “I wrote these to her when I got accepted to med school, then when I enlisted. I just wanted her to be proud of me.”
“God you’re sexy,” John said moments before his lips wrapped around the tip of Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock let out a moan which grew in volume when John swiped his tongue alongside the base of Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock let the phone slip from his hands and reached down to stroke a hand through John’s hair.
“I’ve got these friends. Elvio and Matthew, co-owners of a sex club. Bondage Tour, ever heard of it?”
“Make it fast, Mycroft. This group won't sit around and ask for Sherlock’s consent.” John snarled as he stood behind the chair he was supposed to be sitting in.
“Did you ever give your sister that hug?” Sherlock asked sometime later when the box had been put away under their bed, and they were cuddled together in a fortress of blankets.
"What's it like? This submissive thing?" Greg asked a short time later while they were sitting in traffic for what felt like the fifth time since leaving New Scotland Yard. Sherlock made a mental note to ask Mycroft how many traffic blocks or construction workers were his men. "And spare me the graphic details. Please."
Sherlock regarded the man across from him with a pleased smile. As ever, John had gone above and beyond on his behalf. He’d been honest, open, and clearly thinking of Sherlock’s best interests as well as his own. That John was willing for more than a few scenes here and there, or periodic bouts of sex, meant the world to him. Not only that, but he was willing to put it all aside when the siren call of a case came their way. Nor was he willing to tarnish Sherlock’s reputation with Lestrade and his men.
“Kill you, no.” Sherlock drawled as he sat back against the high-backed booth.  “Get you in my pants, yes.”
“Jesus,” Greg whispered then reached down to adjust himself. “That was… hot. I need to step outside, cool off. I’ll be back in a few.”
Mycroft did not stay at Baker Street, much to John’s surprise. Though, he did help John get Sherlock inside and into bed. As he turned to leave, Mycroft caught John’s eye and motioned for John to join him in the kitchen.
“I know, love. I know.” John vocalized as he massaged Sherlock’s scalp. “Do you have any theories yet?”
Over the past three days, since John had come up with this insane plan, Elvio, Zed and Paige had been spreading news about John and Sherlock’s performance at Bondage Tour. With any luck, that news would have reached Moriarty. At first, John had been fine with that. But unable to sleep last night, it had hit him that in following through with this plan, Moriarty would get to see something that John didn’t want him to see.
“Oh, John called while I was moving the car,” Greg grunted as he lifted one of the heavier boxes. “He’s going to meet us at the Yard. Told me to pass the news on that he found two more missing, and if you ever checked your mobile you’d already know that.”
“Sherlock,” he called, loosening his tie and peering down the hall to where Sherlock sat in his armchair, hunched over his laptop.
“It’ll give us time to look for areas we need to discuss, like how to handle our friends. Greg isn’t an idiot, and he might pick up on it if we aren’t subtle. Turning back to the notepad, John scribbled down
Ruffling his hair and growling in frustration Sherlock looked over the printouts of police reports Greg had sent over. Over the past six months, dozens of people had been reported missing, or bodies had been found and never claimed. To date, seven of the unsolved deaths were of victims with nearly identical feather tattoos on their collarbones. Their ghostly faces stared back at him, glassy eyes begging him to bring them peace.
“You’ve gone relaxed. Good.” John’s voice drifted over him, soft and approving. The hard edge was gone from his tone. John brushed a finger along Sherlock’s flaccid cock, “Soft too. Not as much fun when you can’t orgasm as well, is it?”
“You could wear a burlap bag and I would find you ridiculously sexy,” John said with a breathy gasp as Sherlock rocked forward, pressing their groins together. “Keep that up and I won't be able to focus.”
Once he’d tidied his room to his satisfaction, Sherlock pulled the chair he kept in his bedroom over to the window. He moved John’s clothes to the top of the dresser and sat. Propping his elbow on the windowsill, he glanced out at the alley behind the flat.
Keeping the door open would give away his desire to eavesdrop. Mycroft would most likely see it as a weakness on Sherlock’s behalf. He could hear the snide remark from his brother the next time they met on neutral ground.
“Some Dom’s like for their subs to pick their punishments. However, I have a few I thoroughly enjoy. Let me know if you are against any of them, and I’ll cross them out.”
"Two missing persons, actually," John spoke up, choosing to ignore Sherlock’s announcement. While he enjoyed Sherlock’s openness, this meeting wasn’t about them, and the sooner Greg was able to focus on the case, the better. No doubt, when the dust settled, Greg would be inviting him out to the pub, where he’d be thoroughly interrogated for any information on what it was like to date a Holmes.
“Can I ask a favor? I know you’ve already got your hands full, and I wouldn’t ask if I thought it was nothing.”
“Oh? Comments from the peanut gallery?” John asked while Lydia lowered one of his two zippers. A corner of the fabric fell forward, revealing a patch of trimmed hair. “Speak up, Sherlock.”
“I don’t plan on it, if I’m honest,” Zed laughed, taking John’s hand and giving it a hearty shake. “Wasn’t sure I’d ever see your face again, not here. Not after reading your blog. You’ve taken up with an interesting man, Watson.”
"Yes, John. Now stop worrying before it becomes annoying. I appreciate you being concerned for me, but I would rather like you to quit your fretting and fuck me already."
“Should we turn on the lights?” John inquired, but Sherlock had already pulled out a pocket flash-light and was brandishing it vehemently, illuminating what appeared to be copious amounts of blood on the floor. “Oh, god! I've already made my daughter into an accomplice”.
Sherlock looked him in the eye and nodded. Alright, so those terms were acceptable to him, then. John took a deep breath. He knew what he was going to say next might spark an argument, but it had to be said.
I chose a nondescript font, for the very meaning of the words were more important than the look of them.
Something is definitely wrong now. I hope he's not having a stroke because I can't save him from a stroke. I can't reach into his brain and remove a blood clot. I wish I could.
Sherlock's eyes tracked him as he rounded the table and stood in front of him, a foot shorter but unnerved.
He begins, but stalls a bit. He twirls his mug and I hold my breath. The silver lining is that neither of us is likely having a stroke.
Rosie's tone was so matter-of-fact that it was now Sherlock's turn to blink down at her. He blinked and blinked and blinked. She didn't seem to mind, she still had some bun left.
“I still don't understand how that relates to our current issue, Rose.” Sherlock said with his no-nonsense-this-is-serious voice. Rosie rolled her eyes at him and swallowed.
I should say something, but he's holding me captive with his steady gaze. I feel my lower lip quiver as my mouth fights my brain to produce an answer to John's impossible query, but nothing happens.
Sherlock groaned. It was her go-to answer to everything. 'Why are you drawing on the wall with a sharpie!' 'Because!' 'Why don't you hang up your jacket?' 'Because!' 'Why aren't you asleep yet?' 'Because!' Sherlock took a calming breath.
The wind stung his eyes and John blinked away a few tears so he could take in his surroundings. There wasn't that much to see, to be honest. Just endless tarmac and cars. At least there was no snow.
Sherlock snapped out of his protracted state, turned on the spot, and grabbed John by the armpit. “Quite right,” he proclaimed and marched them out of the house.
Rosie was screaming her lungs out and John was struggling with the straps of her high chair when Sherlock stumbled into the kitchen bleary eyed and dishevelled.
The moisture in John's eyes has gathered together into tears, and one falls now. It lands on his cheekbone and starts its descent down his face. It's drawn to his lips and I watch as it slips into the creek of his mouth.
Sherlock simply ignored him and continued raking his eyes across the scene with his usual intense focus. There was blood seemingly everywhere. Splatters on the sofa, ceiling, walls, floor, and very prominently on the corner of the sturdy coffee table.
I nod again; don't want him to think it's not. He sighs at that and brings forth his whole hand. Not just his fingertips now, but his whole hand resting on my arm. His thumb raking back and forth over my skin, bringing so much warmth.
“Oh, sorry, John. I thought we were stating random facts that have nothing to do with the conversation that I tried instigating a minute ago,” Sherlock stated with a dramatic eye-roll before steadying his gaze on John. “I asked you where you'd like to go”.
“Oh.” John felt something clutch at his chest. “That's, yeah, good. Very thoughtful. Thank you, Sherlock.” Sherlock gave him a small smile.
Nothing happened. Not really. Sherlock just sat there, petrified, except his eyes had started rapidly blinking. He was processing, John realised. He had done this exact same thing when John asked him to be his best man. He was in shock. He was having a sort of panic attack, John's inner doctor's voice supplied.
“Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that I'd like to see more of this,” he muttered and gestured in Rosie's and Sherlock's general direction.
And it wasn't just the sight of the words that were comforting, it was the knowledge that they were there. I needed this. A part of John, now a part of me.
I am 98% sure the saliva has not transferred to my arm, but I check anyway. A quick glance; and my world stops spinning.
“John, I am going to say something now.” He nods at this. Receptive. “I hope you won't mind, given the situation.”
Is this what it's supposed to feel like? Because, surely, this is the moment where he finds out. I hope he doesn't leave right away.
My mistake. I'm used to refer to time by location when it comes to that period of my life, but of course John doesn't know that. How could he? He wasn't there.
“I guess you don't. Not anymore,” John trailed off and turned towards the kitchen looking for a distraction. Obvious. “Tea?”
There's a fair bit of dialogue in Icelandic in this chapter (and probably the rest of the fic once I finish writing it, but alas) but you should be able to hover over those bits to get the translation.
“Sorry, sorry, a lot to unpack there.” He heard John sigh and rub his face. “Hey, look at me, Sherlock.” He really didn't want to, but he opened his eyes anyway. He had a sneaking suspicion that they were wet and glistening. Embarrassing. “God, Sherlock.” John exclaimed and
Rosie was listening to him with rapt attention. John tried to hide his amazement, not wanting to scare Sherlock off again.
John places his right hand on my left, which is covering his left, which covers my left arm, and gently pries it off. He removes his left as well and my skin feels suddenly cold. His chair scrapes against the floor as he stands up. I can't help but watch him as he stands for a moment.
I feel the need to divulge. I don't understand why, but I'm not afraid any more. Well, 68% less afraid.
“What he means to say is that he is a Consulting Detective and would like to offer his services to your department.”
That smile followed John as he positively skipped towards the nearest tube station on his way to work.
“No, honey, don't hit Daddy,” John murmured and promptly got another wet smack to the cheek, “at least not in the face”.
“I'm just asking Daddy if I can play with the fancy legos, but he's not answering.” Rosie pouted and crossed her arms childishly. She was a child after all, so she had the right to, Sherlock guessed.
Sherlock was breathing heavily, like he'd just run up the stairs or vaulted across rooftops. John was staring up at him. Shock. Yes, that's what John's face was expressing. Pure, unadulterated shock. Sherlock let himself sink back into the chair. He was starting to feel numb again.
John didn't even know what he wanted. Not really. He just knew that he wanted Sherlock in his life and in the life of his daughter. In fact, now that he thought about it, John wanted Sherlock to be more than just some figure in his daughter's life. If he was completely honest, he wanted Sherlock to be a parent to Rosie.
John sighed. Of course he didn't. Sherlock wasn't like that, was he? He survived on ones and zeros. He was logical, and what John was proposing wasn't based on logic, it was based on emotion.
This was their routine now, the daycare staff knew Sherlock would arrive at precisely 15:45, and Sherlock always took great care to have nothing going on every single Wednesday. If a level 10 case popped up on a Tuesday night, he would let it sit until after Rosie was asleep the following night. This had only happened once so far, and John had nearly admitted Sherlock to A&E for potential concussion or stroke at the time.
John felt his lips stretch into a fond smile. He couldn't help it. Sherlock had really changed and grown over the past two years. That he considered John and Rosie a part of his family still caught John by surprise sometimes. At times like this, John knew he wouldn't be able to deny Sherlock anything.
“Sherlock!” John hissed. “You're going to get us thrown out of a country we've barely been in for more than five hours.”
John's voice has a new quality to it now. I'd be enjoying this moment if what he's saying isn't making me feel like my insides were blinking in and out of existence. I wish I had realized how my apparent death would affect him before I left.
And with that, Sherlock somehow managed to cram their luggage in the back, John fastened Rosie in her seat, and they were off.
“You've had plenty of moments in the spotlight. I was due for some action.” John quipped back and stood up from the table without letting go of Sherlock's hand. Sherlock followed John's lead and rose from his own seat.
“Good day and welcome to Kvósin,” the man said with a bright smile, seemingly unperturbed by Sherlock's lack of social grace. John gave the man an apologetic smile.
He turned around slowly to observe, with surprise, Sherlock murmuring softly to his smiling daughter.
“Pity,” Sherlock peered back into his microscope. Then switched topics, “we could take Rosie to the park tomorrow. It'll be Saturday, and I wouldn't mind collecting samples from the pond”.
“Can you please do the voice, Papa?” She pleaded, testing out Sherlock's new parental term at the same time. It was perfect.
He was back at 221B, his daughter was happy and healthy, he was back to running around with Sherlock (within reason), and everything was good.
“Good. Any other concerns?” John was smiling now. No concerns. Except for the obvious. Parents were usually
“Did you really think I had been dying to tell you for years that Sherlock is actually a girl's name.”
John couldn't hold back a chuckle. “This is getting ridiculous, Sherlock. I told you, I don't need a holiday.”
Now it was John's turn to tear up. He let out an unsteady bark of a laugh and rubbed his eyes with his free hand.
Each child had their own little nook where they kept their boots, scarfs, and parkas. Rosie's had a plaque with her name on it above her nook, and a picture she drew herself sellotaped under it. It was a crudely drawn picture of Rosie, John, and Sherlock. Every time he got to see it, his heart sung.
“What!” Sherlock sprung up from his chair and into John who had been in the way. Rosie looked up from her legos and grinned.
Soon the moment passed and Sherlock pulled out his phone.“Time for lunch, I gather? Then crime scene!” A manic grin stretched across his face. Back to normal, then. Sort of.
Sherlock froze and stared at her unblinkingly. He could have sworn he saw a mischievous glint in her eyes, the devil.
“Papa Pirate?” She tried out, then grinned and her laughter danced into Sherlock's heart. “It's perfect!”
According to Sherlock, Ragnar Jónsson had been an alcoholic and a drug addict. He had been in huge debt and had only recently fallen off the wagon after having been sober for at least 15 years. He had been unemployed at the time of death, but Sherlock reckoned he'd once had a high income job (not a complex deduction given the nice house and neighbourhood the man had inhabited). All of that had of course been evident by the wear on the furniture, the arrangement of the kitchen, and the odd placement of an ugly bust on the mantle.
Sherlock took a deep breath and held it, forced himself to really look at John, then exhaled slowly. Careful.
God damn it! His vocal chords and mouth were rebelling against him. Stupid transport. He swiveled in place, then decided that it was for the best to retreat to his bedroom. Let John stew for a bit before facing his anger.
His fingers are stroking my skin. Circles. They go in circles. He's feeling it through his fingertips like Braille.
“What?” John looked up from his phone and stared at Sherlock. He was truly giggling, like a teenager. “Christ, you're almost middle-aged, Sherlock. What the hell?”
The hair on the back of my neck bristles and my stomach rolls. My left eyelid feels tingly and the likelihood of me having a stroke rises 35%.
! They are incredibly rare!” He leapt up from the chair, flinging his laptop onto John's chair as he went, and spun out of the sitting room. “Start packing, John! Our flight leaves tomorrow morning!”
“Cubicle beds,” John snorted, finding this incredibly funny for some reason. Then again, he'd never seen anything like this before. Sherlock simply hummed and set their luggage down by one of the beds. John closed the door and stood awkwardly in the middle of the flat (Jesus, a flat!) with Rosie breathing sleepily on his neck. She'd woken up as he'd ascended the stairs earlier.
Sherlock nodded at the reception woman on his way to Rosie's group room. He had only just arrived at the door with the little window in it when he heard Rosie's muffled shriek. The door flung open and Rosie came bolting out.
John was babbling and not making much sense. Divorce his work? Was that a pop culture reference Sherlock wasn't getting or, oh. Oh! 'Married to my work', he'd said that once. And John remembered! Why did John remember? 'Not a proposition,
“That's why I was afraid, John. Not this exactly, rather, the opposite of this.” Sherlock muttered. John looked back up at him. Now or never. He was going to say it. “You see, for the past few years, actually, since shortly after you moved in, to be honest-”
The weather wasn't all that bad. He was just being overprotective and dramatic, as usual. He put Rosie down and held her hand as they walked achingly slowly towards the swing set. There was a toddler seat on one of the swings, so that's where John was headed. Sherlock followed them silently, like some dark and ethereal guardian.
Steinunn held the door open for them so they could enter with Rosie, then she let it fall closed and lead them down a narrow hallway until they reached an open space full of desks, paperwork, and chatting police officers. She beelined towards a door across from them and knocked sharply before opening it. John could see a brunette woman in her forties sitting behind a large desk as Steinunn ushered them inside. The woman, Auðun John presumed, looked up but didn't acknowledge them in any way.
They arrived at their hotel around noon. It was right in the heart of down town Reykjavík. They had driven past colourful little houses and a pretty pond full of ducks, swans, and other water fowl. John struggled to imagine how high the rate of their room must've been, because the location was simply superb. The hotel was within spitting distance from the pond (John vowed to take Rosie down to feed the ducks at some point) and, according to the map on his phone, right next to the
“I didn't know how long we'd be staying, so I thought I'd better go with this rather than two separate rooms. This way, I can mind Rosie if she wakes up fussing in the middle of the night,” Sherlock mumbled sheepishly.
Now he is unable to finish sentences. Likelihood of stroke going steadily up and I calculate the ambulance response time for this time of day. 13 minutes.
“John,” Sherlock all but whined. “I thought I told you before. This is Iceland. Murders are incredibly rare and one needs at least 10.000 hours of practice to become adequate at something. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that the Reykjavík Police Department consists of utter imbeciles.” Sherlock pocketed his tools with a graceful flick of his wrist to further nail home the point that he was the expert here, the impossible wanker.
John whipped his head around quickly enough to give himself whiplash. He stared at Sherlock in disbelief but didn't dare speak a word.
“John,” Sherlock started with a frown. “I'm not some imbecile. I know you'll leave, eventually. It's perfectly logical.”
Sherlock continued to be still as a statue, John couldn't help but marvel at the softness of his curls. It was almost a crime to let them go once Rosie's fingers had been carefully disentangled.
“I'm not asking-, I mean,” John went on, interrupting Sherlock's thoughts. “Nothing has to change, you know. I'm not saying you have to divorce your work or anything. This is not a proposition, unless-, that is, of course you wouldn't. I'm just saying.”
This was a disaster. What would John say? John trusted Sherlock to pick up his daughter on Wednesdays. He trusted Sherlock not to hijack her for his own. Rosie was John's daughter not Sherlock's, but now she was calling him 'Daddy' and that couldn't possibly escape John's notice. He was after all, slightly less of an idiot than the general population.
together, romantically entangled. John hadn't mentioned that. If Sherlock and John weren't romantically entangled, then that meant John was single. On the market. Available. Up for grabs. Someone could
They both jumped back a step, panting and flushed. Good thing, since in the next moment, Rosie came running into the kitchen wearing a pirate hat and an eye-patch.
“I'm just her dad's flatmate.” Sherlock spat out. His eyes were stinging now, behind his eyelids, which he kept scrunched up.
“95% of Iceland's energy is renewable; if we rent an electric car it would do wonders for our carbon footprint.”
Once they had found a nice bench and given away all their bread to the ducks, Sherlock finally decided to ask Rosie about the 'Daddy' phenomenon. She was tucking away into a cinnamon bun with obvious delight; her cheeks were covered in sugar icing and chocolate. Sherlock handed her a tissue, which he carried with him every Wednesday in case of a situation like this.
But, of course, Sherlock couldn't let it go, even after a whole week of nothing but John's cold shoulder on the topic. So, John decided to engage him, just this once, hoping to put a lid on the idea.
“I can't believe we came all the way over here and you didn't bother working with the local police.” John's tone was scolding. This was typical Sherlock.
I grab the slide from out of my microscope and put it on the side. I reach for my next specimen, saliva sample from a frozen corpse, and slide it in place. John is staying very still now.
“And finally, you will reach out to the local police and try to work with them.” Sherlock scowled at him and opened his mouth. “No, listen! I'm not going to get arrested for housebreaking or mistaken for a murderer while in a foreign country with
He turns around despite all that and pours the cooling water into two mugs. I don't know what I'm feeling now. He's making me tea, but he always makes me tea, even when he's angry with me. What can I deduce about his state of mind now?
“No, it's not like that. I- well, just don't freak out, okay? I think, actually I know, that I won't be able to love anyone again. Not while you're still here. Because, Sherlock, I- err,” John trailed off and swore under his breath. What a coward. Sherlock needed to know, he
He says it like it's something that has been said before. I feel warmth spreading through my very being. It's not physical, not really, but his words warm me.
Now he looks down into his mug. He hasn't had any of his tea yet. It's just sitting there, right in front of him, untouched. Like me.
He's looking me in the eyes now, and I notice his breath growing steadily more normal. He is calming down and I don't understand why because now I'm the one on the verge of a panic attack.
“I can think of several reasons why you'd freak out about this and most of them seem awful, so I think I'd rather have you tell me why you're so... alarmed, rather than me taking a guess and getting it wrong.” John gave him a weak smile. He was scared, Sherlock realized. John was scared; but of what? “Can you please tell me, Sherlock? Why does it bother you?”
Sherlock seemed to be done for now, so John let out a breath he'd been holding for a while. Auðun's face was hard to read. She either looked incredulous or astounded. Then something shifted and John was sure that now it was fury he was seeing in her face.
“Sorry, this is Sherlock Holmes and my name is John Watson,” John tried for casual but he was sure he still sounded incredibly awkward. He silently pleaded for Sherlock to just sit down and behave for once.
Keflavík Airport was incredibly windy. John grimaced as he wrapped his arms around Rosie and followed Sherlock who was being uncharacteristically helpful as he was dragging all of their luggage behind him.
There it was again. Sherlock's sadness, badly disguised under petulance. John didn't really know what to do, what to say, to relief Sherlock's fears. The only thing he could think of was something Sherlock would surely not welcome. It's not like John could just reach out and...
As Sherlock pulled Rosie's parka off the hanger it occurred to him that she had just referred to him as 'Daddy'. He was suddenly concerned. Rosie couldn't possibly mistake Sherlock for John, unless...
John was sensing an interesting pattern in the things that made him happy, but it didn't make much sense. He had these things in his life, so what could possibly be missing?
“Which of you is Sherlock?” Auðun finally broke the silence and Sherlock bristled visibly, but didn't answer immediately.
This revelation was a sham. When he thought about it, really, it wasn't a revelation. It was more like finally someone nudged his focus and he could suddenly see.
At that, Sherlock timidly approached where John was fighting the screaming banshee. John moved out of the way and handed Sherlock the straps.
Sherlock just sat there, staring somewhere to the left of John. He was offline. Then, in a blink of an eye, he shuddered and spoke.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock sighed with a put-on exasperation. “I will follow your silly little rules for Rosie's sake, now can I please tell you all my brilliant deductions I made at the crime scene?”
waltz all over the place when we're trying to do our jobs. Thank you for a great story to share with my colleagues but now I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.”
Sherlock felt a mug nudge his fingers and reflexively closed his hands around it. Might as well. He went through the motions of lifting the mug up to his face, tipping it against his lips, then swallowing the lukewarm contents. Afterwards he felt a bit more like himself again, although incredibly confused by his own body's apparent shutdown.
Since then, Sherlock had called out random, albeit interesting, facts about foreign countries every day. His whole let's-go-on-holiday-idea had been far from dropped. Sherlock was adamant about the three of them going abroad to some holiday destination together, for some reason. John's strategy, so far, had been to just ignore him, hoping Sherlock would soon find a new experiment or a case to distract him.
That is all that I manage. I shake my head a twitch and detach myself from my microscope. It's in the way, so I push it aside.
“I'm not sure I understand,” said Auðun slowly. “I don't see a camera crew trailing behind you so I'm assuming you're serious.”
“I'm afraid you'll take offense and leave.” Sherlock had been ready to end there, but then he felt the words leave his mouth without his consent, again. “And I'm afraid to hurt Rosie's feelings when I have to tell her the truth.”
Sherlock was still standing close enough that John's nose was a hair's width from Sherlock's laryngeal prominence. As he realized this, Sherlock took a step back and scratched the back of his neck nervously. “Sorry, I just had a lot on my mind.”
Now it was John's turn to lose it. He took a couple of deep breaths, trying to steel himself, before he burst out laughing. There they stood. Two men in their late thirties and early forties, one in a bespoke suit, the other with a baby in a stroller, and they were positively howling with laughter.
Reykjavík was beautiful. Well, at least this part of it was. Here the streets were narrow and full of pedestrians. The buildings were quaint and colourful, and some even adorned with extraordinary artwork. Every other building seemed to house a pub or a café, and the rest were either tourist shops or expensive looking designer clothing stores. John had to almost drag Sherlock past a couple of them.
“Today we learned about mommies and daddies, and how some people have two mommies instead of one mommy and one daddy, and I told them I had two daddies. Kevin's got two mommies but everyone else got mommies and daddies. Except for Gladys, she got only one mommy and no daddy.” Rosie took another bite of her cinnamon bun as if that had been explanation enough.
“I couldn't get your name, of course. That would have been dangerous for both of us. I got the next best thing.”
It feels a bit easier, now that it's all out in the open. Now that his eyes aren't piercing into my soul.
How he loved him. Now that he was able to admit it to himself, John must've loved Sherlock from the day they met. That's what it felt like, at least.
The only thing that mattered in this moment was that Sherlock was stepping out of the cab that had transported him to Rosie's daycare and since it was already 15:43, Sherlock was about 2 minutes from picking up Rosie; because today was Wednesday, and Wednesdays were good.
It was soft, delicious, and monumental. John's lips were dry and warm against his, and his cheek had just that bit of stubble underneath Sherlock's palm. Sherlock felt like he was cocooned in the navel of the universe and nothing could ever get better than this. Then John nibbled at Sherlock's bottom lip and the kiss took a sharp left turn into sensual territory. Sherlock could hear himself groan and he could definitely feel his face flush. John was gripping his elbow with one hand, while the other was crawling down Sherlock's back. When it found it's target, it grasped and squeezed, and Sherlock had to stop kissing John to pant instead in his mouth.
Sherlock looked up at that, his eyes shining with both tears and alien beauty. John's heart clenched.
Mornings, these days, were John's favourite part of the day. He would wake up ridiculously early to feed his grouchy toddler, then usually around 30 minutes later his other, and considerably taller, grouchy toddler would stumble into the kitchen and refuse to be fed.
He sat down himself and started tucking into his own food. Sherlock still hadn't moved an inch and Rosie had started to tug on his curls.
“Hey, don't give me that look.” John pointed a finger at him. “I might have been a slag a few years ago, but honestly the idea of me
The victim had travelled from Asia only 12 hours before their death. I can recognize bacteria found in South-East Asia, although that could be the result of illegally imported cuisine. I must double check that.
Sherlock still didn't speak, but he did close the distance to them and started pushing Rosie from the other end. John faltered a little. The sight of Sherlock doing something so utterly domestic threw him off.
John turns, but he doesn't walk away, instead he walks around the table to stand next to me. I twist my torso to face him and look up. Search his eyes. Am I breathing?
“I don't understand why you like this tasteless goo so much. Granted, the squeezing aspect looks entertaining but ultimately you're just eating artificial flavouring and preservatives.” Sherlock chided and wiped Rosie's cheek with a wash-cloth.
It was almost cruel, since he just realised himself what he wanted, that he had to lay himself bare in front of Sherlock's unforgiving gaze.
“Look, Sherlock,” John started and Sherlock's face pivoted towards him instantly. It was slightly unsettling. “I hate to spring this on you like this, but this is something I think you ought to know about me and Rosie.”
” Another pause as she listened for a reply. Her eyebrows drew together and she frowned slightly. Oh, here we go. “
“Sher-,” John turned to him but he was already walking towards the stairs with their luggage in tow. John shook his head. “Never mind him, he's always like that.” With a final nod at the clerk, John followed suit.
“John?” Sherlock looked up from his microscope as John entered. He could swear he saw mirth in Sherlock's eyes even if he was trying to school his face into an expressionless mask.
John hauled him to his feet and proceeded to drag him into the kitchen. Sherlock felt his legs start moving on their own accord, helping John move his transport.
On anyone who was no vampire, the reaction would have been lost, yet John noticed the faintest blush darkening Sherlock's cheeks.
Suddenly teeth sank into his upper arm, closing around the wound. John cried out but a strong hand covered his mouth a second later, muffling his screams.
Sherlock rapidly explained in complicated words that John barely followed what he was concocting while moving about and taking notes. John’s eyes traced his smooth movements until he caught himself staring.
The man snickered to himself, which would have looked childish on anyone but him. He wrapped a hand around the hilt of John’s knife and pulled it out from where it was still buried between his ribs. John watched while his vision dimmed how the man cut his wrist until it bled and extended his arm.
Irene Adler was a legend amongst vampires. Not as old as John himself, yet experienced nonetheless, she was famous for the services she provided to humans. Apparently being dominated was a common sexual preference, yet being dominated by a vampire who could kill you without exerting too much effort seemed to add to the thrill substantially.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, giving no other indication of his thoughts on the matter. "This does not seem to frighten you."
He didn’t know how much time had passed when he regained consciousness again, nor did his brain remember at that time why he was lying on the dirty ground in a backyard, rain pouring mercilessly onto his still body. John opened his eyes, shielding them against the cold water with his arm and sat up slowly to take in his surroundings.
Sherlock returned to the small table in a corner that provided them with an overview of the tiny establishment. John had taken the chair against the wall and, after setting down their steaming mugs, Sherlock pushed the second one closer. John blinked yet before Sherlock could explain he needed to see the remaining patrons as well, his expression cleared. He had obviously caught on.
True to his word, Sherlock lent him some clothes, and coming from him they were already twice better in quality than anything John bought for himself. Their goodbye was slightly awkward, yet John hardly cared – he was too distracted by his hunger. Leaving Sherlock that morning had him feeling bereft despite the promise of food, though John had expected nothing less.
Those interested in women might describe her as fit, Sherlock mused as he quickly catalogued everything about her. Her attire consisted entirely of branded products – her summer dress was Burberry, the heeled shoes on her delicate feet Manolo Blahnik, her large sunglasses Gucci. She wore it with that special air of arrogance of the newly rich. Everything about her sparkled and shined with one exception: her tote handbag. There were scratches in the expensive leather, barely visible but damning all the same.
Sherlock obeyed with only a hint of hesitation. John only noticed it because he was waiting for it – the man’s body clamming up, only for a second, before crossing the space and lowering himself into John’s lap.
“My turn,” John announced then with a smirk. At Sherlock’s arched eyebrow, he elaborated, “Only you quizzing me – seems a bit unfair, doesn’t it?”
It was Irene. She stood out from the crowd with her petite and pretty form but her demeanour was very confident as she came forward to join Mycroft.
"Alright," John relented with a sigh, "But no sleeping on the sofa. And I will inform Mrs Hudson where you are."
He saw the Glorious Revolution abolish the royal absolutism, the union of Scotland and England bring prosperity to Scotland, and watched the Jakobite wars come and go. The Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century caused a population increase which tempted many vampires to help get rid of elderly people that were just slowing down the country’s progress.
“Some food sustains my energy,” John replied patiently. “And the land is vast here, full of mammals I can feed on. As rarely as possible, however. I don’t appreciate the taste in the slightest.” His lips curled into a smile of their own volition, yet Hamish failed to see the humour in his statement.
He gasped when the teeth withdrew but there was no reprieve – instead the man sunk them unforgivingly into his throat.
“How about mirror reflection, stake to the heart, black clothes, the whole Dark Age and Gothic rubbish?” Sherlock listed in a disparaging voice.
Behind his back, John smiled at him. He felt like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. It hadn't felt right to feel so alien in Sherlock's company after so many years of being apart. During Sherlock's childhood they had become so close and even though his conflicting feelings had eventually forced him to leave the boy, he hoped they could go back to their easy company, now that Sherlock had grown up.
"Well, you have to see her point as well, Sherlock," John said. "She was worried about you. Fire is dangerous."
In the end, Hamish understood that the only way to keep John’s true nature a secret was for him to move away. They said their goodbyes and several weeks after John had told his son his biggest secret, he made his way to Glasgow. It was still close to Hamish, yet a larger city, which allowed the vampire to become invisible more easily than a small community ever could. It was very hard for Hamish to let his dear father go as he had grown very close to him after Charlotte and his mother’s death but John promised to write him which was only a small consolation.
Seeing how gentle John was with the boys, especially Sherlock, Diane started to wish he were her husband. Sherlock was always so happy to see him and got encouragement from his visits as her husband very often subdued the bubbly and rather unique child. In personality, her little one was so much like her and, of course, John liked him.
"I believe you," she said, "but rest assured that my uncle is not the only vampire on the premises." Her voice was shaking slightly, projecting insecurity which was at odds with the content of her words. "Now," she added, taking a deep breath, "what do you want to know?"
, John thought when the boy's last words were tinged in a dark timbre. He just couldn't say no to Sherlock. He looked so small and helpless that John's nature was rebelling against sending him home.
Sherlock nodded meekly and recounted how he wanted to determine the impact of candle placement on burning time on Christmas trees. John chuckled at that and for some reason Sherlock could not quite explain, something warm spread through his chest.
"Mrs Hudson was quite angry," Sherlock finished, gripping his mug tighter while he stared into the amber liquid, a shade only John was able to make and which was always Sherlock's favourite taste.
Of course Estrode would have to keep a close eye on the developments – Diane Holmes was married, after all, and John’s longing tone indicated that he was struggling with an attraction that went beyond neighbourly friendliness. However, he didn’t want to act too quickly. John had spent too much time depressed and secluded. He deserved more from his immortality.
John smiled wryly at that. Sherlock heaved a sigh, muttered a “Bloody vampires,” but there was no heat in his voice. Then he straightened.
“After graduation,” Sherlock began, “my brother wanted me to work for him, though I had no interest in siding with the government in any capacity.” He had to supress a shudder. “I, well – you might say I drifted for a bit. During that time, I met a detective who was failing to solve the most obvious case, so I offered my assistance.”
Sherlock was not overly fond of Christmas (at least not since he had researched its origin and discovered how many lies and deceit had occurred to form the holiday), yet the time always made for good experiments.
Now Sherlock looked genuinely surprised. “I have wondered about that because you never mentioned having siblings. You have a sister? A sister who is still alive? But that would make her –”
The countess exchanged a lingering look with her uncle, apparently reaching a decision as she visibly braced herself, squaring her shoulders and taking a deep breath.
Now, however, he let them emerge. Hamish grew pale when he realised that his father was in fact growing fangs in front of his eyes.
“Poorly,” Sherlock blurted. When all his companion did was nod encouragingly, he continued. “The reason is elusive, yet you did have trouble sleeping. Presumably because of the low-quality mattress in your bedsit. Another reason you rooming at Baker Street is the best course of action.”
Sherlock got up from his chair, picked up his long coat from a nearby chair and put it on, causing his obviously bespoke shirt to stretch across his chest. The younger man went past John, pausing at the door to look back at him.
Piercing blue eyes were trained on him with the same intense focus that John remembered from many years ago. He had grown up into a breathtaking man, dark curls framing high cheekbones and a tall, slender body that stood in perfect contrast to John's compact form.
Sherlock gave him a half-smile and wondered if John still remembered when he was a teenager. His deduction skills hadn’t been as honed as they were now but they had always led to dissatisfaction and exclusion among his peers.
He felt jealousy and possessiveness war within him. If he allowed Victoria to drink from Sherlock he would have to give up the craving to be the first to do that. Also, as they were only faking their whole relationship in regards of pet and master, he felt torn by taking the choice from Sherlock of deciding if he wanted to have Victoria drink from him.
A soldier who was never hurt and a bullet that managed what so many others had not. Realisation dawned on Bill with sudden clarity. Osmond was a vampire.
Sherlock swallowed again, shifting his stance. The obvious discomfort in his expression gave John pause. He cursed himself – he couldn’t imagine how harrowing the experience must have been for the detective.
"Do you think that’s such a good idea, mate?" Trevelyan argued, his eyes mapping the room. "I’ve got a bad feeling about this."
The man cursed and John would have flinched at the sound of such profanity if he had had the energy.
His senses had become incredibly sharp through his transformation and he could hear people’s heartbeats without touching them. It would serve him well in dealing with future patients.
Estrode disliked him greatly. That didn’t stop him from using his services. Another piece of paper caught his attention then. It was a photograph, showing a young woman. Her blonde hair was dishevelled and dull, her skin paler than considered healthy – even for a vampire.
It was a little unnerving to feel these celadon eyes boring into him but John tried to not think much of it. He talked to Mrs Hudson about Sherlock’s condition, gave her a receipt for medicine and then dismissed them like any other patient.
Intrigued, he sought an open door, discovering it around the corner, hidden from the main hallway. John advanced slowly, concentrating on his surroundings just in case whatever had lit the lamp wasn’t friendly.
“What’s your plan?” he whispered so quietly that Sherlock had to strain his ears. “I’d suggest I walk over to her first, chat with her for a moment and then you join us. All right? Don’t take it personally but I really don’t want you to scare her away with your charming attitude,” he said, a teasing smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
“I’ve heard of this rumour too and I guess that Sean has had the means to get his hands on it but I have never touched it,” she said. “I saw the news that people have died…”
The undertone of ‘What is in it for me?’ was blatant. Next to Sherlock, John prolonged the moment, his eyes fixed on Victoria with a calculating look.
Not that he was complaining. Quite the contrary, in fact, given how the scheme worked perfectly and only a few minutes later, the five of them entered Glenda Manor. John was appalled at how easy it was to enter a house where a member of the royal family resided but in their case he was glad they could fool the guards.
“No, but I worry now that I told you all that,” John replied, leaning back in his chair as if to distance himself from Sherlock.
“Some, yes, but out of their own stupidity,” John said, slowly and deliberately. “You’re not stupid, are you? Then why don’t you answer me honestly?”
London was already a buzzing metropolis at that time. It was much different to Edinburgh or Glasgow and gave John the feeling he could start a new life here. His bad memories of losing his wife and child were moving into the background now, making room for something incredibly new.
“It’s …” Sherlock wasn’t meeting John’s gaze. “It was a time in my life I’m not particularly proud of, John.”
John sent the young woman a soothing glance, inspecting the entrance hall despite Sherlock’s order to the contrary. The two agents crossed their arms and settled against the wall next to the portal, apparently satisfied to allow Sherlock to take point.
"Well, look what we have here," a female voice said from his right. The woman was leaning casually against the wall and John's instincts immediately identified her as the second vampire that the operative had mentioned. "And here I thought I'd be special."
"I’ll spare you the details, if all you’re doing is repeat what I said back to me like mindless children discovering the use of their mirror neurons," he grumbled. "She has at least one safe house in Brighton, one in southwest Wales, one in Oxford and one in Edinburgh. Maybe one more in London, though the residual particles on her shoe soles in combination with the remaining clothes were inconclusive.”
John sat down at his table and took a sip of the blood bag, realising with a start that it was his favourite blood type, AB.
“Also a vampire, quite right,” John said, taking a deep breath. “Not sure if I should be happy about it. She had some problems with drinking and drugs. I left London to help her settle her life; I guess she couldn’t handle being undead. Luckily she met Clara and is now in good hands. They had been split up but reconciled a while ago.”
By now, Sherlock could tell that John felt quite confident when he entered one of them, after all he was surrounded by his kind and he knew how to handle them. Vampires were cautious creatures, even after all these centuries and although humans had a vague idea that they really existed. They used smell and observation to ascertain if someone was to be trusted. So as soon as he and Sherlock had entered, all eyes of the room, from whatever table or crook in the last corner of the club, had fallen on them for the entrance was visible from every spot of the establishment. Sherlock knew enough about vampires that he was sure that John had looked casually through the room and assessed how many people were around – twenty-six vampires and eighteen humans (eleven women and seven men) – and how many of them focused on whom of them.
"You’re free to go on," he said with a curt nod, handing back the documents and then moving to open the gate.
"How about that? Could fit me." He gave Sherlock an expectant look with a small twinkle in his eyes.
All these things allowed for only one possible conclusion: John had to be a vampire. His brother, who had entered a posh university in London, had also given him clues that the myths about vampires were true. He had met people who knew others who were quite certain that the government was holding back information about the existence of vampires among human society.
With Victoria’s attention firmly elsewhere, John could turn his to Sherlock. The man’s eyes had gone wide, though in fascination rather than pain. He was probably cataloguing every sensation, storing away every gulp and greedy gasp. One day, John hoped to look back fondly on this memory, yet right now all he felt was jealousy.
The car stopped and John blindly threw some cash at the driver before bounding out onto the street. Sherlock quickly followed after to catch up with the speed of the vampire.
"Please spare us your bumbling," Sherlock snubbed. "We are here to investigate, not to imitate annoying tourists."
They gave him a moment to button up his uniform, still sporting a hole where the bullet had hit, before exiting the room and leading John deep into the administrative part of the base. They entered a room and made it clear that John was supposed to sit on a chair at a minimalistic table. There was another one opposite him yet neither of the armed men took it. Instead, they waited until the door opened once more, stood to attention and saluted the man who seemed to be John's judge.
He survived, as did his wife and child. John couldn’t believe his luck. Many of his friends had died or were mourning their family who had fallen victim to the illness.
John blinked in surprised. “Nice that I get a say in that, too.” He sighed. "It’s not so easy, Sherlock. I’m sure your brother or someone else at the government is keeping an eye on me. If I don’t return tonight, they’ll think I’ve run off. Besides… ” He paused, uncertain whether or not he wanted to divulge that particular information.
“Even though you must be aware that I am here to deliver punishment for you breaking several laws in your entry into the military?”
In many cultures of the world, people knew tales about mythical creatures, which needed blood to survive, could only live in the dark, had super-human skills and were as dangerous as the wild animals that lived in the forests or open savannah. While parents mostly told those stories to scare children into behaving, they never would have thought that at one point during history, those creatures would be revealed as non-mythical.
Before John could get too lost in the sensation, Victoria returned and he had to loosen his possessive hand around Sherlock to let him drink his tea.
That was when everything went downhill. John had known for a while now that he desired Diane in a way that would be deemed inappropriate by most of society. She was married and had children – John should keep his distance.
He was tall, his auburn hair neatly styled, his face blank. It were his eyes, though. Eyes John recognised. He might have gained a bit more around the middle and age might have left its mark, but there was no mistaking him.
When the Great Plague broke out, John Watson was sure his life would be over soon. To still be alive and breathing one year later bordered on a miracle.
"Sherlock!" she shouted when she saw him, using a tone of voice he had never heard her use before. "What have you done? The house could have burnt down! You could have been hurt! What were you thinking?"
John, who had only been to posh clubs during the Victorian times where it was normal to spend his free time to engage with other gentleman or vampires, had felt a little rusty to Sherlock when he entered the first establishment. Obviously etiquette and interior design had changed drastically, portraying the twenty-first century in every aspect. All of the recent clubs were located in the rich boroughs of London, usually having their entrance in a small, easily overlooked alley. There were no flashing lights that indicated the existence of a vampire club. You had to know where they were. Luckily Sherlock had found them through his contacts as John wouldn't have known where to start. He never frequented clubs of this nature, or so he had explained.
Sherlock pouted slightly and put his hands on his hips, something he had already done when he was a teenager. John stopped what he was doing to look in fond amusement at him. Sherlock’s pout lost some of its intensity under John’s gaze, yet it didn’t stop him from arguing.
"You’re in the UK, Molly. What did you expect? Human society is still made of a class system," John said, his mouth a thin line. "This house looks like it has been handed down for generations."
The shock of the realisation made him jump to his feet, staring with wide eyes at the man amidst them. Blond, with chiselled features and radiating strength and authority, he stood only a bit taller than John. The stranger took in the scene before his eyes before he turned his attention back to John.
Mycroft sensed he had to play his cards right when it came to his brother. It was remarkable that he had figured out the toxin and the implications on his own, and they needed Sherlock on the team if they were to uncover who was behind the killings.
By 2008 Sherlock had made it a job for himself to solve cases and earn money with it. His foster-father Mr Hudson turned out to be a drug dealer, who fled to Florida to avoid arrest, dragging his wife with him to use her as leverage. When Sherlock heard of it, he flew to the States to help the police by ensuring the conviction and execution of Mrs Hudson's husband. The by then elder lady was very grateful for it and helped Sherlock to find a flat of his own in London. He settled down in 221B Baker Street with Mrs Hudson living close-by. She visited him often to check on him by cooking some meals or cleaning his flat, which got very messy when Sherlock had a case that took up all his concentration. Sometimes they had chats about the past and on very rare occasions they spoke about John and where he could be and what had happened to him. Sherlock tried to avoid those conversations, though. No matter how many years had passed, it still hurt that John had just left like that.
“No, I really don't,” John said quietly. When Sherlock showed obvious signs of a coming rebuttal, John cut him off. “Look, we can't go to Iceland because for one: It's very expensive. Secondly: It's dark, damp, and cold, and final and most importantly: It's god damn bloody expensive!” Having said his piece, John leant back against the sofa cushions, but Sherlock just glared at him.
“What?” John was staring at him, dumbfounded. Sherlock squeezed his hand, softly. John let out a quiet 'oh', and looked down at their hands for a second, before squeezing back.
“Yeah?” He called back and carefully threaded Rosie's right foot into place, making sure her little toes didn't get caught between the snap-and-click buttons that ran all the way down the leg of the onsie.
“She's downstairs, playing with her fancy legos at Mrs. Hudson's.” John supplied. John was reading him, this was all wrong.
And then they were kissing, briefly, in their kitchen on a Monday morning, eggs and bacon cooling on their plates on the table and Rosie was babbling in the background.
It was not like a permanent marker, simply resting on the top of my skin, ultimately fading away as my skin cells died and got replaced by new ones. This was ink, pure ink, pushed down through my Epidermis and deep into my Dermis where it would reside for the rest of my life.
“Yes, and honey bees fly at 15 miles per hour with a wing stroke of 11,400 times per minute,” Sherlock drawled while staring at Rosie, fascinated.
I was in Instanbul when I got it; just a tiny little collection of letters on the inside of my right forearm. It was a little over a year into my self-exile and I had been pondering over my decision for months by that point. It wasn't exactly a thoughtful, objective, conscious decision; it was a need, and I caved.
Sherlock sought John's lips once more and moaned wantonly when he kept missing. John helped by latching onto his bottom lip and
“I didn't think you were,” John said as he pulled back and raised his eyebrow. “I'm just concerned to find you unresponsive while my daughter plays with needles and acid at your feet.”
“We'd like to work with you on the investigation of the murder of Ragnar Jónsson,” Sherlock said, just as bluntly. John suppressed a sigh.
I surprise John as well, it seems, because he looks up at me and his eyes are impossibly round. I can see his left hand inch forwards a bit and twitch slightly.
John is asking if I want tea. It's a bit too warm for tea, but it's John's so I hum and try to busy myself. Must look normal.
“Didn't you say something about this place being beautiful?” John criticized. The landscape looked bleak, so far. They were driving down a highway in the middle of nowhere. Literally. The North Atlantic to their left. Empty moss covered lava plain on their right.
I adjust the focus of my microscope slightly and the red blood cells I'm studying jump into sharp focus. I'm aware of John. So aware.
John couldn't help but smile at Sherlock's serious tone and complex language. He loved how Sherlock never simplified his speech when talking to children.
“We have a booking under Holmes”, Sherlock stated again, although there was an air of excitement about him instead of the usual disinterest.
“Okay, look, since you insist,” John started. He had to pause a bit to transfer bits of bacon onto Rosie's plate. She was getting restless. “I'm not sure you'll welcome this, but since you insist on understanding whatever this is, I guess I'll just say it.”
Sherlock looked from their hands at John, who'd just done the impossible. John, the most wonderful man he'd ever met, smiled back at him. Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth twitch upwards and gave into the smile erupting on his face.
John clung to old rituals, because in this moment everything could change. As long as he'd be able to make Sherlock eat his breakfast, everything would be fine. At least, that was his pathetic argument.
“What truth?” John's voice was carefully neutral. Sherlock chocked on nothing. He kept his eyes shut.
John squeezes my arm gently, and I cover his hand with mine. I'm not thinking of consequences. I just react. Like an automaton. A machine.
“Here we are!” Sherlock announced and, with a flourish, indicated to a small green car. It looked brand new, and somewhat futuristic, John would admit, but it was rather tiny. Sherlock looked happy enough, so John just shrugged. “Don't worry, John. It comes with a car seat for Rosie.”
