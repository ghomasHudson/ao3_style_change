“Yeah, Sarah wants all of my paperwork caught up before I leave, and since it’s the onset of flu season, we’ve been slammed at the clinic anyway. Thanks for watching her.”
“Did you read those, John?” she asked, her voice breaking on her hitching breaths. “The ones from Bart’s,” she clarified. “Since the head injury, I’ve started having massive seizures. I’m forty-one years old, and I’ve had to move back in with my parents because I can’t be alone. I’ve lost my driver’s license, and it’s very likely that I’ll be like this for the rest of my life, according to the neurologists. Apparently, once you start having grand mal seizures, especially as an adult, they generally don’t go away; they just get worse. I’ve lost everything because of her, my job, my independence, my health, my freedom…all because she couldn’t bear to think that she didn’t own me anymore.”
She gestured to the copies of her medical records. “Every time, she was sorry. She promised to get help and never do it again. She’d call you and tell you that she needed to go to rehab, and you’d send her to private clinics and get her help, and then she’d get out and start drinking again within a few months. And then she’d hit me. Or she’d get into a pub brawl or something, and then the whole cycle would repeat.”
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow, but constitutionally unable to let a mystery lie unopened, he did exactly as John expected.
John sighed and closed his eyes, allowing himself to feel the softness of the sheets, the cocooning comfort of the thick memory foam mattress, drifting slowly with the lush notes of Lily Was Here on Candy Dulfer’s alto sax.
In fact, it had worked out so well that she had decided to try it again. Sherlock’s dour brother and that sweet pathologist were perfect for each other. A few dropped hints, a subtle innuendo or two and John had caught right on. Silly boy. He even thought it was his own idea!
“Excuse me?” John asked, the segue to this strange conversation almost enough to give him whiplash.
“It’s a godsend that Mrs. H agreed to keep her this late,” John continued softly. “And stop trying to change the subject. That still doesn’t excuse your boorish and utterly offensive behavior. All you had to do was quietly point out the breaches of procedure to Lestrade and let him deal with it. It is his job and his crime scene, after all,” John fumed.
Tonight he was going to thoroughly enjoy himself.
“Take my bed, John,” Sherlock said quietly.
He racked his brain for information and settled on an incident that occurred when he was six. He had been flying his kite when it had become entangled in a tree; he had tugged gently at the string to see if it would drop loose, but the kite had torn and come down in pieces at his feet. He had run to mummy sniffling, dragging the corpse of the now deceased kite behind him.
“Simply this, John. Did you ever bother to define your terms with Sherlock? Did you ever state your assumptions?”
It was almost ten o’clock on Christmas Eve, and John had persuaded the recalcitrant consulting detective to have a bit of a romantic evening in. Sherlock had given in with ill grace, a grimace of distaste and a sulking scowl on his face, but he was at least making a minimal attempt to get into the spirit of the holidays; his only other option had been to roust Lestrade from his bed and demand a case, which had, in fact, been Sherlock’s Plan A for the evening.
This was fuller…deeper…naughtier, and as he began the rhythmic fucking motions, his body finally relaxed fully and he began to brush against and then lightly rub his prostate gland.
Sherlock flushed a spectacular shade of vermilion. Well, the iceman thaweth…
John gave a few last hiccupping gasps and pulled away, embarrassed at completely losing his mental balance. Much to his horror, he found he couldn’t pull away completely and allowed his hands to remain loosely wrapped around Sherlock.
John rolled Sherlock’s theory around in his mind. “You know as well as I do the fact that she took the heroin voluntarily mitigates any legal defense. And the track marks between her toes make a strong case for voluntary injection. If someone had dosed her without her knowledge and consent it would be different, but voluntary intoxication isn’t a defense to a crime.”
“Absolutely not, and I told her so,” John ground out between gritted teeth. “Harry would’ve bled out if not for Clara. I’m amazed she had the presence of mind to call for help let alone get the bleeding stopped given the severity of the concussion she was suffering. And, it’s not just a concussion. There was an occipital skull fracture under all of that mess as well; I took a brief look at her chart when she nodded off. She’s lucky to be alive. I can’t honestly say that if I were in her place I wouldn’t have just let my attacker bleed out.”
“You have to get up, Sherlock. You have to meet your parents’ train at 10:00.”
“Nothing with regard to her legal matters. I did, however, call Mycroft and arranged for the best reconstructive surgeon in Europe to have a look at Harry—Dr. Josephina Keener. She was one of the doctors who treated me…after Serbia,” Sherlock finished quietly.
“Yeah, and then you completely forgot to mention that you were a drug addict.”
“And what exactly did Mycroft say?” Sherlock asked quietly.
Afterwards, John would blame the fact that he had been thinking completely with his arse, literally.
“I said, does the skin look burned to you? You are a doctor, right?” Sherlock asked with some amusement and a hint of exasperation.
“Why didn’t I see it before?” Sherlock demanded grabbing his phone. “Lestrade, I need access to the NSY criminal database. [Pause] What? Yes, all of it. I think I may have solved the serial killer case, but I need more data. [Pause] Well, then get me clearance!” Sherlock shouted petulantly before hanging up. The game was on.
“Talk what out, exactly, Mycroft?” John challenged sharply, turning from the window for the first time to face the other man. “Sherlock meant what he said; even a blind man could have seen it. I won’t be some pity fuck for Sherlock to use and discard. I know how you Holmes boys talk about love and sentiment, like it’s dog shite you’ve scraped off the bottoms of your shoes, but I deserve better than this. At the very least I deserve someone who loves me back,” John said hotly, for the first time a barely contained fury in his voice.
Despite his inability to grasp social cues, due to familiarity, Sherlock could read John better than other people; he was hurt, at least a little. John needed reassurance. “John,” Sherlock tried again. “As I’ve explained to you, The Work is essential to me…to my very sanity. You are indispensable to The Work, making you just as important to my sanity…,” Sherlock blundered awkwardly. “This experiment was the very epitome of success, do you understand?”
“Utter rubbish!” he growled in response.
“No,” Sherlock replied evasively.
John rubbed idly at his left hand, staring at the pale, almost invisible indentation left by his wedding band, unable to purge Amanda’s words from his mind. He had ceased wearing the simple gold band months ago, since he had begun sleeping with Sherlock actually, and the skin was nearly back to normal, back to its original unmarked state. He could just see the barest of outlines. In another month, it would be gone—a pristine palette on which to write a new chapter of his life if he wanted to.
Releasing John’s wrists, Sherlock stood quickly and grabbed John around the waist before he reached the floor. Half dragging and half walking, he led the clearly unhinged doctor through to the lounge, pushing him down onto the sofa. Sherlock stared in frustrated confusion. This was not something he was accustomed to dealing with, and his usual method of leaving the scene would probably be detrimental to John’s welfare, he reasoned. Emotional witnesses were John’s bailiwick—or Lestrade’s, not his.
Showered, shaved and dressed, John headed down to find Sherlock on his laptop, fingers flying.
“C’mon, Sherlock,” he mumbled tiredly as he slung his legs over the side of the bed, suppressed a groan and sat up fully, leaned over and began fumbling for his jeans, hoping that they were somewhere within an arm span of the bed.
“I’m sorry,” John whispered, “so, so sorry.” He looked helplessly at Lestrade standing just inside the doorway, and the convulsive force of the sobs seemed to double.
His first instinct was to jerk the cock out of his arse and dive for the duvet, but he knew that would fucking hurt like hell. Not only that, but Sherlock would get a real eyeful of John’s stretched open, puffy pink arsehole.
She had wrapped her arms around him and petted his hair until his immediate grief had passed. He wasn’t certain if the stroking had diminished the grief or if it had been his realization that he could build another kite, a better, more aerodynamic model than the store bought one, that had finally assuaged his tears, but the memory was all he had to go on.
It was too much to hope for that John would find another Mary Morstan, or whatever her real name had been. Lightning generally does not strike the same place twice; while not impossible, it was highly improbable that John would ever find another intelligent, thoughtful, daring mate who would actively encourage John’s dangerous pursuits with Sherlock. No, the more likely scenario was that John would settle for a woman who would subtly or not so subtly push Sherlock out of John’s life a little at a time until John was firmly ensconced at home, a dried up husk of a man yearning for excitement and adventure. Therefore, it was up to Sherlock to save John from himself. Why, it was practically Sherlock’s duty to do so, he reasoned, as John’s best friend…best man even.
“You, Dr. Watson, are a very good surgeon. Although you were invalided out of the military for tremors in your hand associated with the shoulder wound, we both know that was purely psycho-somatic. The first time I met you, your hands were rock steady under pressure. You are still rock steady under intense pressure that would cause most prima donna surgeons to sob and wet themselves. One of my surgeons has decided he is getting too old to carry out his required duties. As such, he is moving to an opening in the upstairs clinic to wipe noses and administer vaccinations until he retires in a year or two. That leaves me with an opening to fill. The position pays well, much more than you currently earn, and it would also give you access to the government run twenty-four hour crèche facilities for Rosie. The child care personnel are all highly trained professionals with degrees in early childhood development and are thoroughly vetted by Anthea, if that is of concern to you. Standard vacation and leave policies apply.”
Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. If John hadn’t deleted his profile, Sherlock was going to have to invest in a backup phone battery with the amount of time he had to spend checking and ‘fixing’ John’s dating profile.
Of course, Sherlock pitched a hissy when John proposed stenciling little smiling flowers and grinning dinosaurs on the wall.
“Winged monkeys, Sherlock?” John said, stifling a snort of laughter.
“You asked me to remind you about Mycroft’s party. If we don’t leave in fifteen minutes, we’ll be late for dinner. We’re supposed to meet Mrs. Hudson downstairs. Mycroft’s sending a car at 7:45. Besides, I’m anxious to see the extent of the bruising on Mycroft’s petty, obnoxious, fat face,” Sherlock smirked craftily.
“Jesus,” John muttered as he swayed on his feet, having stood a bit too fast. He began searching for his trousers almost immediately.
“Nothing better to do than watch the CCTV cameras on Christmas morning, Mycroft?” John asked bitterly, drawing the warm blanket tighter around his shoulders nevertheless, unwilling to look a gift horse in the mouth.
“You struck a man who refused to fight back, who clearly was demonstrating all of the markers of extreme pain had you taken the time to notice, a man who had suffered torture, hunger, deprivation and constant jeopardy for years to keep you safe,” Mycroft concluded on a cold hiss. “I am not at liberty to give you any further details, and neither is Sherlock,” Mycroft said quietly as he saw John attempting to form a question. “This mission was, and still is, classified above top secret.”
“I’m going to do what I should have done years ago, before things got to this point. I’m going to let Harry face the consequences of her actions. If that includes prison time, then so be it,” John said harshly. “You don’t agree?” John asked, confused.
“Sherlock,” John said tightly as he bit his lip. “I need to do this alone.” His eyes softened minutely as he gazed at his friend. As soon as Sherlock’s face registered his understanding, John tapped lightly on the door to room 204 and called “Clara,” softly as he entered the room, leaving Sherlock standing a silent sentinel outside.
“Sherlock?” John questioned. “Where are you going?”
“I’ve had Lestrade pull all of the prior police reports regarding Harriet Watson. In each instance where your sister became physically violent, it was arguably a matter of self-defense: a bookie who was threatening her, a man in a bar—and from all accounts he instigated the fight when she turned down his advances, and a car repossession agent—who in her inebriated state appeared to be trying to steal her car.”
Sherlock removed his hand and placed it over John’s, waiting silently as John began working the dildo out, learning the correct motions by feel. John jerked his head toward the nightstand.
“Oh God yes, please.” John whispered, uncertain why but darkness always seemed to create the need to whisper. John turned over on his side, and he relaxed as he felt Sherlock curl behind him. Sherlock didn’t particularly care to cuddle, at least he didn’t like to sleep that way. He would gladly hold John until the other man fell asleep and then roll over onto his side of the bed. Sherlock claimed he got too hot pressed against someone else; he was also an incredibly light sleeper and would awaken instantly if he were touched during sleep. John suspected it had something to do with being the brightest student at the boarding school, and, knowing Sherlock, he hadn’t had the social understanding to conceal that from the other children.
“Why, John, I’d think you’d be a bit more enthused.” She eyed him shrewdly, a knowing smirk gracing the rose blush of her lipstick tinted smile. “After all, with the way you talk about Sherlock, it’s only a matter of time, isn’t it?” She quirked an eyebrow at him archly before beginning the short walk back to the clinic, pretending not to see John’s mouth hanging open agape at her.
John didn’t know much about Anthea; she was, for the most part, extremely uncommunicative, surgically attached to her Blackberry, and absolutely impervious to John’s best pick-up lines. He had, however, seen her more than competently handle a semi-automatic assault rifle and enter a burning warehouse during a firefight in the midst of a hostage rescue situation,… after Sherlock had tracked down the radical terrorist cell responsible for kidnapping the PM’s six year-old nephew. That was all he needed to know. He wasn’t certain whether she was MI6 or some sort of covert black ops that didn’t exist on paper, but she certainly had the skill set necessary to keep the world’s only consulting fucktard genius detective alive.
Sherlock actually looked at John’s eyes, although John wasn’t seeing much in the way of higher mental functioning there, or basic comprehension for that matter. Sherlock took a deep, steadying breath and nodded.
John shrugged. “I hold down the power button, force it to shut down, let it cool down for a while and reboot. That usually solves the problem.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock settled back and crossed his arms over his chest, sulky.
“Yes,” Sherlock croaked, voice rusty from non-use. “Are you sure…the risk?” he murmured, eyes questioning.
Sherlock glanced sideways at him before replying. “I didn’t give a thought to your needs or best interests when I sabotaged your attempts at dating other people or when I read your private blog.”
John looked down, flushed a deep red and said nothing; words lying choked and mute in his throat. Again he had apologized when he had calmed down, and Sherlock had forgiven him, but that didn’t negate the hot shame that consumed him whenever he was reminded of his complete loss of control. John swallowed hard past the lump in his throat.
He sent one blunt finger to drag teasingly across his perineum, stimulating his eager prostate from the outside. He continued to caress and massage the area until he could feel his prostate throbbing inside, silently begging for relief.
you, and yet she put you, herself, and your unborn child in mortal peril by not making absolutely certain you knew what threats you were facing. She gave you a flash drive, John,
When John’s heart rate and breathing returned to normal, or no longer in danger of cardiac arrest normal, he closed his eyes and sat back to think. He’d need all of his energy to deal with Sherlock on a tirade.
“Stop,” John whimpered…. ”Stop….I’m too close.”
John looked at Sherlock quickly before he slid out of the chair to kneel by Clara’s chair. “I’m so sorry,” he murmured as he caught her as she pitched forward to sob on his neck.
“Jesus, where did it all go wrong?”
“I know that this is none of my business, and if it’s too personal…,” he began, trailing off on a long breath. “Where is your rock bottom?”
RD Enterprises was, in reality, Real Doll Incorporated, the maker of the most realistic sex dolls and paraphernalia in the world. The Real Cock II was a marvel of modern engineering, “featuring triple layering and Sil-Slide™ technology sliding outer skin as well as individual floating testicles,” according to the company’s website. Each piece was handmade, hand painted, and had to pass strict quality and safety assurances. They were the most realistic artificial penis’ ever created. Once warmed to body temperature and lubed, most blindfolded people couldn’t differentiate them from a real, erect penis by touch alone.
He sat heavily on the edge of the bed and scrubbed his hands across his eyes, feeling nothing so much as old, tired and empty.
“No, I did not,” Mycroft said with a slight sneer as he turned cold, sharp eyes on the smaller man seated next to him. “I did it to spare Sherlock another vicious beating at the hands of his supposed best friend,” Mycroft said coldly.
“More,” demanded Sherlock.
“You didn’t need to do that, you know,” John said gesturing toward the center of the bed.
“Correct,” came Sherlock’s deep voice, clear and precise.
Sherlock tuned his violin quickly and played several Christmas carols and a few of his original pieces to the great delight of all. The party lasted long into the evening, and everyone seemed to quite enjoy themselves. The evening ended with an invitation from Mycroft for everyone to enjoy New Year’s Eve at his home. John, sensing an impending snippy retort from Sherlock, swiftly kissed him on the pretense of standing under the mistletoe and then promptly accepted Mycroft’s gracious invitation. Sherlock raised a snide eyebrow but mercifully kept his thoughts to himself.
“Glad I could be of use,” John muttered with a small snort.
“John, listen to me,” Sherlock demanded as he gripped the other man’s wrists and gave him a little shake. “None of this is your fault. This was Harry’s life, her choices that have brought her to this point.”
John had been able to stop the bleeding and repair the tearing. However, infection had set in after the young private had been transferred to the base hospital in Kabul, and the poor kid had ended up losing part of his colon; his once promising military career had ended with a medical discharge, and he would have a colostomy bag for the rest of his life. The perpetrators had never been caught.
Christmas dinner was served an hour late, but Sherlock’s mother was positively delighted that it gave everyone a chance to talk longer and catch up. She was especially thrilled when Sherlock announced that he and John were engaged to be married, a move that startled John so much that he choked on the mouthful of mulled wine he had just drunk. John made a mental note to remind Sherlock that announcements regarding their relationship should be discussed and agreed to beforehand.
John looked. He was uncertain what he was looking at; it looked like an ordinary knot to him. There was nothing unusual about the rope either, standard grade stuff available at any hardware store. The tissue surrounding the knots was heavily purpled with bruising and severely inflamed. There were numerous cuts to the fingers and hands that looked clean, less raw than the torn and rubbed wrists and ankles. John looked up, confused and somewhat skeptical.
Sherlock shook his head and steepled his fingers under his chin in his favorite thinking pose, untouched mug of tea still sitting at his right elbow. “No, you go ahead. I’ll wake you at 11:30 if you’re not up by then.”
John stared slack jawed. The offer was, to put it mildly, simply incredible.
Step 1: Identify the Problem
She smiled a small, clever smile and quietly left her flat to ring in the New Year with her boys.
Sherlock stiffened instantly, but John ignored it.
Sherlock flopped back onto the couch, dramatically throwing his hands up to rub at his eyes and then run his hands roughly through his curls until they were standing out like he had stuck a hair pin into an electric socket. “I know. I’m missing something. There’s always one thing,” he muttered.
Sherlock nodded, lost in thought.
“Wha…why are you here?” John muttered stupidly still certain this couldn’t be real.
Thirty minutes later, John had finished reading through the websites Sherlock had marked. The first was an addiction recovery clinic that was actually held in an ancient Tibetan monastery. The clients received counseling from licensed therapists and lived and worked alongside the monks. There was no Wi-Fi, no television, and no modern conveniences. They were miles from any village, and there was virtually no way to get drugs or alcohol into the monastery. The program lasted a year. The therapy was intensive as the program took only twenty patients at a time. In their off hours, the patients were expected to work in the fields next to the monks and grow their own food. Harry would hate it there.
Sherlock closed his mouth on what was certain to be a cutting retort as he switched his focus to John.
“You know I haven’t,” John retorted on a resigned sigh. “You know everything about me, don’t you?” John said snidely.
John bit his lip and quietly asked Sherlock if he wanted John to move to the upstairs bedroom. Sherlock fixed him with a cool glare, said “Don’t be an idiot, Watson,” and that was the end of it.
John had lasted a little over a week. With no girlfriend, and with Rita’s betrayal still stinging like an icy knife in the gut…
John moistened his lips slowly as he prepared to ask a question that was absolutely none of his business, knowing that Sherlock would answer it honestly, and still not quite sure that he really wanted the answer. “If I recall correctly, a three on the Kinsey scale is completely bisexual, with no preference at all for one gender or the other, isn’t it?” John said in preface, hedging for a bit more time.
“Excellent. So, why would our killer tie this knot, which takes more time, more effort, and means he has to carry around a significant amount of rope?”
Twice John had thought Sherlock had been moved to sample the pleasures of the flesh: once with Irene Adler, but he had been solely intrigued with her mind, and once with Janine, Mary’s friend, but he was simply using her to get to her boss, a notorious blackmailer.
“My cousin, Nora, well… she’s just sold her house outside of Leeds and the bit of property around it—small farm. Her husband, Ian, passed on last year and her kids are all grown and left home years ago. She’s in her late 50’s now and doesn’t want to go back to teaching primary school. Well, I mentioned to her about needing a nanny for Rosie, and she expressed a fair amount of interest in the plan when we had lunch today. She’s looking for a situation in London—nice change of pace from the country where she can start over, make new friends, and everything around her won’t remind her of Ian.”
A few days later, John awakened bleary and disoriented. He pushed the corner of his sleep mask up and glanced at the clock on the nightstand. The glowing numbers revealed that it was just shy of half past three. John heard a slight rustle near the closet and was just able to make out the dim figure of Sherlock dressing silently in the corner. The dark figure bent over, picked up his shoes, and exited quietly, closing the door with a soft snick behind him.
At Sherlock’s nod, John continued. “I turned forty my last birthday, and I know you forgot,” John said tersely as he held up a hand forestalling Sherlock’s interruption.
John snorted. “Come on, Mycroft. You are the British Government.”
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed.
“Just humor me, John. What precisely did Mycroft say?”
...instead of telling you, really preparing you, for what could be coming for you…for you and Rosie. How many cases have we had where people cheated for
“Yeah, I was aware of that, actually, and even if I’d missed it, I’m sure the semen currently dripping out of my arsehole would have clued me in,” John replied sarcastically.
“I do know,” came the even reply as Mycroft continued. “You were consumed with grief, John, but you were by no means subject to a break with reality. You could distinguish fantasy from reality; you knew right from wrong. You were angry; angry with Mary for making the choice she made, angry with Sherlock for breaking a vow that no man could ever uphold, though he did his best; and angry with yourself for failing to protect the ones you love, for being helpless. Regardless, you assaulted Sherlock viciously, savagely and without mercy until he lay broken and bleeding on the floor at your feet. You’re a doctor; you very well know that you could have seriously injured or killed Sherlock that day, especially given his pre-existing physical condition—a single kick could have meant a ruptured spleen, a lacerated liver, the list goes on, but I doubt I need to.”
Sherlock was awkward, clumsy—clacking teeth and too much tongue, but as John coaxed him -- nibbling and sucking his lips and tongue, Sherlock was soon giving as good as he got, devouring John’s mouth with a hot, moist determination to consume, to burn, to lay claim.
“No. A copycat, a student would have made a mistake somewhere, would have left some DNA, a partial fingerprint, hesitation marks. These are all very, very precise. Back when our killer started, there are a few mistakes on his earliest victims.”
John rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed. “I told you, Sherlock, I can’t afford a nanny. Without Mary’s income, I can’t afford a lot of things I’d like for Rosie.”
He reached quickly for his new toy, feeling the “skin” slide along the hard shaft, that feeling of smoothly oiled velvet over steel, grinning proudly as he quickly palmed his own, slightly larger shaft—for a bit of relief—not at all for comparison purposes, of course.
“You have a nasty habit, Dr. Watson, of letting your fists fly when Sherlock does not act in accordance with the manner in which you feel he ought to behave. You know Sherlock. You know he is not like other men, that he frequently displays the emotional depth and range of a teaspoon. You also know that despite this flaw he is, in his own way, a good man who has no wish to hurt you or cause you pain. Yet when he miraculously returned from the dead, you hit him, repeatedly, even as he tried to explain the reasons behind his deception.”
Sherlock nodded and then flopped gracefully into the bed, two pillows piled up behind his back as he reached for his laptop. He turned the volume completely off and then pulled up the autopsy reports on the first two victims. John climbed into bed more sedately, pulled his sleep mask into position and was asleep less than a minute after his head hit the pillow. His last conscious thought was that Sherlock had a damned comfortable bed.
John lay awake a few more minutes, studying Sherlock’s moonlit profile and marveling in awe at how in love he was with this man and how close he had come to losing him.
“Not the brothel,” Sherlock said, immediately sensing John’s distress. “I went to see Mycroft.”
It was odd, but Sherlock was having the strangest craving for Hasenpfeffer.
“Oh God, Sherlock, please don’t. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…”
John laughed until tears came, the laughter coming to a choked standstill when John realized that Mycroft hadn’t so much as twisted his lips in a smirk. “Surely you’re joking,” John said on a gasp, looking for any signs of humor in that cool façade. Finding none, he stared slack jawed at Mycroft feeling as if he had just been transported to the Twilight Zone. “You must be mistaken. We’re talking about Sherlock here—you know, married to The Work Sherlock,” John said at last.
When John stumbled in at half two, Sherlock was scrolling madly through the NSY database.
John thought about it, considered it for perhaps a full five seconds. It would be so easy. But John Watson was no ostrich, and he wasn’t about to stick his head in the sand. Besides, he had a daughter to protect. He had deliberately overlooked so many of Mary’s deceptions, little things that just didn’t add up. He wouldn’t make that mistake again. John turned his pillow upright and sat on the bed, his back against the headboard. He gestured for Sherlock to sit as well, which he did, folding himself stiffly at the foot of the bed, one leg bent but with his shoe hanging over the edge off of the quilt.
John sighed. “You’re going to have to push like we did with the dildo, push and release, push and release until the muscles relax enough for the head to go in. When the head pops in, stop, okay?”
“I …oh God, I’m actually gonna admit this out loud. I want to be the only one who gets to touch you. The thought of you with some brothel prostitute makes me ….,” John trailed off not sure whether ‘insanely possessive’ was a good word choice or not.
“Come on,” John said as he tugged Sherlock to his feet and headed toward the bedroom after banking the fire and ensuring that the safety screen was firmly in place. “We’re not canceling,” John said decisively, “especially not at the last minute,” he said as the bedroom door closed. “Bed, sleep, now.”
1) The English Electric Lightning or EEL is reportedly the fastest British supersonic jet plane ever built. It’s reported top cruising speed at altitude is Mach 2.27 or 1500mph/2415kph. It was decommissioned in 1988.
When John returned, Sherlock was deep in his mind palace sorting information and rapidly devising and discarding solutions as he turned the full power of his genius to ensuring that all of John’s needs would be met, thus ensuring that he would stay.
“Because then I would seriously have to question your sanity. You know what I’m like, John. I won’t remember your birthday, or anniversaries. I’ll forget to buy milk and bread. I’ll sulk and whinge and will, undoubtedly, shoot a new face into the wall the next time I’m bored. I’ll walk away when you’re talking and in a strop; I’ll leave you to hare off on my own to chase questionable leads, and the pancreas in the refrigerator is non-negotiable as are the fecal samples in the ice cube trays.”
“If she isn’t, she’ll undoubtedly be dead soon. I shudder to think how much worse things have to get before she considers that she’s hit bottom. She nearly killed the woman she loves; her hand and part of her arm has been amputated, and she’s currently fighting sepsis; she’s facing twenty years in prison, and she’s alienated everyone who has ever given a damn about her. She hasn’t a friend left in the world. I checked the visitation logs. Other than you and Nora, no one has come to see her or even sent flowers. When she failed to show at her last temp job, her employer terminated her, and her landlord has commenced eviction proceedings.”
“You’re thinking of Eurus,” Sherlock said in a cold, detached voice. “Don’t.”
* * * * * * * * *
Four days passed in the construction zone now known as 221B Baker Street, and everyone noticed that John was becoming increasingly cranky.
“Accurate,” Mycroft interjected smoothly. “Have you never stopped to ask yourself the simple question ‘why’?” Mycroft asked sharply before resuming. “Why is it that in the two years you were residing with Sherlock you were never able to secure a solid, long term relationship with a woman? Why it was only after his alleged death that you were able to form a relationship with Ms. Morstan, despite the fact that you dated many talented, intelligent and amazing women? Could it be that so long as Sherlock was alive that you had nothing left emotionally to give them, that they were nothing more than…how shall I say this?...friends with benefits? And despite what they may have wanted, they could never be more to you, because you were and are completely and irrevocably in love with Sherlock,” Mycroft concluded with a slight tilt of his head, like a magician awaiting applause. Ta da!
And it didn’t take a detective to figure out why John had been shouting Sherlock’s name.
“No. The Diogenes Club,” Sherlock said, answering the questions in reverse order as he moved toward the coat rack.
John scrubbed the heels of his hands tiredly across his eyes. “Sherlock, I’m … I …I don’t think I can do this. I’m just curious. I just don’t see us as partners, not in that way.”
, if you like. Anyway, it’s a total reset. It doesn’t last as long as the heroin, but it is intense, and it does what I need for it to do. Generally, I arrange to spend several hours at the brothel and reset three or four times.”
“Walk with me, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft commanded in a low voice. “Rosie will be well looked after, I promise you,” he said softly as he gripped John’s elbow firmly and began leading him toward the deserted picnic area. “Before you begin sputtering again, let me explain. Oh I know consciously you think of Sherlock as simply your best friend, but I’ve seen how you look at him—looks of adoration disguised as admiration or indulgent frustration.”
“As you are aware, the first two bodies were discovered at #11 Privet Drive on September 19th of this year.” The projector hummed and pictures of the first two victims flashed on the screen. “Both victims were found with their wrists and ankles bound in rope, the killer having used double constrictor knots with a slipped bight; this knot is also referred to as the torture knot. The more the victim struggles, the tighter it binds. The fingers, hands and other nerve rich areas of the body were repeatedly sliced by a sharp thin object like a surgical scalpel or a razor blade. Nerve clusters around the body had been repeatedly pierced by a sharp, long, thin object, likely a finishing nail to cause maximum pain with minimal physical damage. The torture wrought was extensive. When the killer finished, he surgically removed the face of the female victim, also likely with a scalpel. At the time, NSY believed the killer may have heard something or was otherwise interrupted before he could remove the face of the male victim.”
She considered carefully, checked the horoscope page one last time to be absolutely sure and decided finally that yes…that lovely Clara Burton and DI Lestrade would make a marvelous couple.
Big Brain was the part of Sherlock’s mind that dealt with sentiment and emotions, whenever Sherlock chose to acknowledge that such things existed or deigned to admit that he felt them twinge in his own heart on occasion. John had surreptitiously named Big Brain after Big Bird, the giant yellow canary on the American children’s show, Sesame Street. Like Big Bird, Big Brain was apt to take emotional information any sane human being would find specious and useless at best, overanalyze it to death and reach a conclusion that ranged from “A bit not good, Sherlock” to “That’s absolutely fucking insane, Sherlock!”
“This side’s fine,” Sherlock said as he plugged his laptop in next to his phone. “Will the light bother you?” he asked as he gestured to the computer.
“Yeah, right…,” John mumbled as he stepped forward and lightly fingered the reddened flesh that extended in a wide swathe from just above Sherlock’s sternum down to just above his navel. As he caressed the taut skin, he noticed that both nipples hardened further, the small buds of flesh tightening. He quickly swallowed the rush of saliva as the thought of tasting them came unbidden into his mind, but he couldn’t stop wondering if they would taste of strawberries. “I’ll…uh…just get the burn cream, the aloe stuff. It’s just a light surface burn. Should be fine in a day or so,” John called over his shoulder as he literally fled to the bathroom.
“I don’t think this is the best time, dear…” Martha Hudson seemed to trail off as Sherlock nodded decisively.
Reaching a decision, John nodded. “Everything,” he reaffirmed. “Take me to bed, Sherlock. Fuck me.”
John sighed, closed his eyes and immersed himself deeper in fantasy.
He had a serious problem.
“Imposing on Mrs. Hudson or anyone else wouldn’t be a problem if we hired a nanny for Rosie. Maybe a good female influence for her,” Sherlock murmured speculatively, adroitly using John’s own words against him, as he completely hijacked the conversation away from his own earlier behavior.
“When you moved back in here, you said that we would raise Rosie together. Did you mean that or not?” Sherlock interrupted his voice clipped and tight.
Sherlock’s head snapped to attention, eyes glittering blackly with the lamp light framed behind him, interest now laser focused.
At some point, it had gotten damp and some of the ink had run but it was still recognizable, although no longer shiny and beautiful; it looked dull and a bit smeared like a watercolor run slightly amok.
John studied the fountain as he gathered his thoughts. “We talked. I told him I didn’t think I could do a physical relationship with him. We sort of tabled it there. I think he’s trying to give me time and space to change my mind. And, as this is a private matter, that’s all I’ll say on the subject.”
“I want to support Clara. She’s the real victim here, and I want to make sure she’s taken care of. Whatever resources or therapy you and Mycroft have access to, I want her to get them.”
Nirvana. John floated in heavenly bliss as the powerful waves of pleasure associated with a prostate orgasm continued to course through his body and wrack his still shuddering frame.
At last the older gentleman cleared his throat. “Sometime in the next few days, Sherlock is going to clumsily and inelegantly proposition you, John.”
John sighed and shivered in the cold morning air. He couldn’t see his breath, but he suspected it was a very near thing.
Mycroft laughed heartily. “Dr. Watson, you’ve seen to what lengths I go to look out for Sherlock; do you truly believe I would turn him away in a time of need because he was out of favors? The favors between Sherlock and myself are a game we play and nothing more, but I will reinstate Sherlock’s favor,” Mycroft said with another chuckle. “You drive a hard bargain, doctor.”
He quickly opened the white box and then the black leatherette case of his new toy, the thing he had paid nearly a week’s salary for, the exorbitant sum of £400: The Real Cock II A.
John was awakened some hours later as Sherlock settled into a laying position next to him and grasped his hand, linking their fingers, his thumb rubbing idly across the backs of John’s knuckles.
“Why are you really here, Mycroft?” John asked tiredly. He’d had little sleep, he and Rosie were about to become homeless—because well, home was wherever Sherlock was regardless of where they found another flat, and he was emotionally wrung out; the idea of a sexual relationship with Sherlock was still spinning around in the back of his mind like a tiny hamster on a wheel. He was almost literally at the end of his rope.
Sherlock licked dry lips and nodded again.
Although an aroused Sherlock was incapable of articulating his thoughts and mental processes, he was, to some extent, still able to mentally process incoming information and apply limited deductive reasoning. It took the detective less than fifteen seconds to locate John’s prostate. Seven seconds after that, he had set up a rhythm whereby said prostate had become the focus of every inward thrust.
“Good afternoon, Dr. Watson. Pleasant day,” Mycroft said jovially.
“I wasn’t in my right mind!” John replied hotly, failing to modulate his voice as he jumped up to face Mycroft.
John had already begun to shake his head when she interjected, “Yes, it is my fault. Listen to me,” she demanded, enunciating each word very clearly, as she reached over to grasp John’s forearm tightly. “I went to see her before they discharged me.”
“Where are you going with this Sherlock?” Lestrade asked. “We know all this.”
Next, he would light a few candles in his bedroom, take a long, hot shower, spread out a few thick towels to protect the sheets and finally retire to his bed where he would indulge himself repeatedly until he could barely walk on Monday morning.
“You know, don’t you?” John asked, “Or at least you think you do. You said before, “I do know.” Bloody Holmes’ and your deductions. Go ahead then,” John said bitterly, “Enlighten me. Why does Sherlock make me completely lose my mind?”
“What?” John mumbled as he tried to put his socks on standing up and ended up hopping awkwardly and tumbling back onto the bed, sock half on and half off. “Fuck,” he muttered as he espied the wrinkled swatch of paper. “Don’t open that,” he said, a note of cajoling desperation creeping into his words.
“I want you,” John said softly.
“You’re lying, John. You just said that Mary’s income was used to provide for Rosie’s needs. Why not mine?” Sherlock demanded, words less a question than an ultimatum.
John was hard, but it didn’t matter. He would ignore his aching, needy cock for now in favor of the more intense full body orgasm he knew was coming. Forcing his fingers down and away from his oh-so-sensitive nipples, he stroked the taut muscles of his abdomen, the skin prickling with suppressed heat at the light tease. He spared a momentary regret that at forty, no matter how much he seemed to exercise, he still retained a layer of fat over what had once been rock hard abs. Overall, though, it wasn’t a bad body at all. He was pleased that regular workouts and chasing around after Sherlock had left him with a well-defined chest, muscular arms, a firm, taut arse, and thick, solid thighs.
“What about her?” Sherlock replied.
“Yes what, love?” John murmured, drifting back into sleep.
“Look, Sherlock, you don’t have to…” John began, uncertain as to how he was going to end that sentence, but Sherlock interrupted swiftly.
“What would you have me do? Spank him for throwing a tantrum? He has every right, wouldn’t you say? I’m hardly the one to console him anyway. I caused this; I gave him hope that I could help his sister, that I could fix her life, get her clean and sober, get her counseling. He was right, you know; I am a presumptuous prick. And my arrogance is responsible….”
**********
“Tell them to sod off,” John retorted, striding out of the bedroom having changed out of his best suit and into jeans and a jumper. “Clara,” he stopped dead at the doorway into the living room, a note of soft surprise in his voice.
His heart was starting to race with an edgy nervousness, and he couldn’t even begin to contemplate the extra delay the tube ride would create, as his steps turned quickly onto Westchester Street where he knew he could hail a taxi.
He did, however, draw the line at painting the entire periodic table on the wall of what would become Rosie’s nursery.
He collapsed on the sofa, tugged the old afghan off the back and allowed himself a good cry, one that he hadn’t permitted himself at the funeral home. He cried for his sister, for the lost potential, for the sweet, mischievous girl he had known, for the talented and tortured artist she became, and for everything in between. He cried for the relationship that he had wanted but never had with her; he cried for the pain she had suffered when she came out; he cried for the damage she had done to herself and others, the lost opportunities she had squandered, and when he was cried out, he finally drifted into an exhausted, restful sleep. He wasn’t sure how long he had been asleep when he heard Sherlock enter the flat and close the door softly. It was dark; he knew that much immediately, so it must have been at least four hours.
“And I say again it’s a complete win/win either way it goes.” Sherlock said with a grin as he picked Rosie up off the floor where she was playing with her blocks and tickled her.
John snorted with laughter. Sherlock gave a bit of a harder thrust in retaliation. Both men froze as penetration finally occurred. Sherlock moaned and John felt the other man’s hands tighten reflexively on his hips.
“Mycroft said he’d do it,” Sherlock mumbled sleepily.
John had had it. Exasperated, he pointed at the couch. “Sit, Sherlock. Sit down and tell me what you’re trying so bloody hard not to tell me.”
John yawned and seemed to come to some realization. “Sherlock, why was Lestrade there? It seems like too much of a coincidence for the one DI we know well at NSY to get this case.”
John had crept back upstairs, shutting and locking his door, sinking down onto the cold wooden floor too stunned to move, too traumatized to cry. What followed were days, weeks, months… years of prayer, of meetings with Father Winchester, a barrage of teachings about how anything other than strict heterosexuality was to be condemned, persecuted. And, whenever his father felt John wasn’t taking the lesson to heart, he resorted to his old stand-by—his fists. Their parents had disowned Harry, who had disappeared for years after that, living on the streets and at various shelters. John was forbidden from trying to find her, not that he had had any notion of how to go about searching for her anyway. And through it all, his parents had demanded almost daily his commitment to church, god, heterosexuality and marriage.
Sherlock was no gourmet, but he did know how to work the coffeepot and could microwave leftover sausages. He had also boiled water and emptied in 3 packets of instant apple cinnamon oatmeal; John smiled fondly, picked up the empty packets from where they had been left discarded next to the covered oatmeal pot and walked them over to the rubbish bin before wiping up the spilled coffee grounds scattered on the counter. He poured himself a very large cup of coffee and began to eat. Sherlock would show up in his own time.
“Owww!”
“This does not mean you get to experiment on people, Sherlock—me in particular,” John stressed urgently, hopefully before Sherlock had formulated his first working hypothesis and devised a testing mechanism.
Not to mention, he had been spurred on by the actions of his recently ex…very ex…girlfriend. Rita Hinton had known from the outset that John planned to join the military, and that if they did become serious, she would have to wait for his enlistment to end.
As he sank into the moment, he sank into memory, idly remembering the first time he had indulged himself in such a wanton and hedonistic pleasure. Third year of medical school…John had already signed the pre-enlistment papers. It was a spur of the moment decision he did not regret in the slightest. Upon his graduation from medical school, he would begin his residency in a military hospital. As soon as humanly possible, he was getting the hell out of England and away from his drunken family for good.
John blinked hard and then massaged his temples, pieces of a complex puzzle starting to fit together, and he wasn’t particularly pleased at how the pieces were slotting together.
John nodded dumbly, not trusting his voice but using his current position to exert enough leverage against Sherlock’s seated body to shove the other man back against the bed, straddle him and kiss him breathless. It was another half hour before the two managed to slouch guiltily into the kitchen only to find that Nora was already elbow deep in stuffing the turkey.
“You’re exhausted, Watson. You’ve worked at the clinic until at least ten o’clock every night this week; you’re barely sleeping at all on that uncomfortable pull out sofa in the corner; and additionally now you’ve a sore back to contend with as well. Take my bed, at least for tonight.”
“It’s not that simple, Sherlock,” John said quietly. “We common people can’t delete things we don’t want to remember. And I remember just a few weeks after I almost beat you to death, you put a gun to your own head so that you wouldn’t have to kill either me or Mycroft; either of us was far more deserving of that bullet than you were.”
Sherlock grabbed the chair opposite John, flipped it smoothly around, and then sat straddle of it, chin resting on his arms folded across the back of the chair. His eyes glittered silver blue in the strong morning sunlight. John sensed a tension, a tautness in the grim set of the other man’s shoulders and a harsh set to his classic features.
“Uhmmm…yeah….alright. So, if we were to engage in a sexual relationship, what would you want to do?”
John gazed at his comatose older sister in a mixture of horror and pity. She was hooked up to every machine known to western medicine, except a ventilator. At least there was some small consolation that she was breathing on her own. John counted no less than eight bags of blood, antibiotics, and fluid support. A small pump at the side beeped every few minutes as it pushed in the benzodiazepines that kept Harry’s addicted body from going into DTs.
“John?” Sherlock whispered into the dark.
John rubbed his face and wandered off to bed, barely getting his shoes off before he was fast asleep. True to his word, Sherlock never went to bed that night.
“I need to rest,” Sherlock murmured back sleepily.
Sherlock chuckled. “I wouldn’t even attempt this with anyone else, but you are interesting, at the very least. I think this could work,” Sherlock murmured with a faint touch of surprise in his voice, as if the thought had only just occurred to him.
“Look,” John said firmly in a voice he was trying to modulate downwards from an irritated shout, “I’m telling you that you have a glitch in your program.”
“Sherlock,” John said in a soft but no nonsense voice as he laid Rosie in her cot in the corner. He waited for Sherlock to raise his eyes and actually pretend to listen to what John had to say. “I think I may have found the solution to our nanny problem.”
“Out where?” John inquired. “Is it the case?”
“He’s a true sadist, John. He wants them to struggle because it means that every time they do, the ropes tighten a bit more, bite just that little bit deeper. And they will struggle. As always, you see but you do not observe. Surely you noted the shallow cuts and deeper puncture wounds to the fingers and hands? Those did not occur during the victims’ attempts to escape. No, John; the victims were tortured. It may not look like much at first, but think about the sheer number of nerves in the human hand, in the fingers—how sensitive they are. From a medical perspective, why don’t many diabetics consistently check their blood sugars? Because it leaves their fingers incredibly sore. This victim has endured far less than the previous victims because of an underlying heart condition that precipitated a massive coronary before the killer really had a chance to enjoy himself,” Sherlock finished with a flourished shake of the photos in his hands.
He glanced over at the doorway and froze in shock. He blinked, but the apparition did not go away.
“Would this position increase it enough so that I can accompany Sherlock on the high profile government cases?”
**********
“Monogamy. You desire a monogamous sexual relationship,” Sherlock clarified.
Sherlock’s lips twisted in an amused smirk. “You naively thought they meant virgin in the literal, Biblical sense. No, John. They meant virgin in the emotional sense. I have never had a sexual relationship with anyone where emotions were involved, on either side, where it was anything other than just fucking.”
Later that evening long, pale, manicured fingers clicked open John Watson’s minimized google chrome icon. Mycroft Holmes settled himself heavily into John Watson’s desk chair as a sapphire wedding ring twinkled madly from the display, and he silently shook his head on a sigh.
“John, take Nora home and call for take away. I’ll pick Rosie up from the crèche and meet you back at Baker Street,” Sherlock said decisively. Sherlock watched the pair shuffle for the elevators and realized it was more a case of Nora taking John home, but the details were irrelevant. He hailed a cab.
Mycroft smiled at John.
“I think it’s brilliant, Sherlock. Not sure where I’ll come up with a hundred thousand pounds sterling, but otherwise…looks great,” John said facetiously.
“You were wrong. Sherlock doesn’t love me. Not sure about Rosie. I didn’t ask,” John said dully, drinking down another gulp of the smooth, very expensive whiskey and holding his cup out blindly toward Mycroft awaiting a refill.
, what was a very frustrated and horny young man to do?
“Do you want there to be a next time, Sherlock?” John asked carefully.
In honor of my birthday on Sunday, my gift to you is the final 2 chapters of this story.  My thanks to those of you who stuck with me through this journey, watching John and Sherlock grow and become men who could succeed in a committed relationship.  I hope you find the conclusion most satisfactory.
“Irrelevant,” Sherlock said dismissively. “Only the consistent patterns matter. That’s when I began combing through the database. Over the last thirty-three years I have identified one hundred and sixty-seven matches consistent with our MO.” The projector began whirring like mad as picture after picture flashed on the screen. Gasps were heard around the room as familiar pictures of cut patterns, puncture wounds and knots flashed again and again and again.
“Huh?” John asked. When Sherlock failed to respond, John tried again. “In English, Sherlock, for those of us who aren’t high functioning genius sociopaths.”
“I turned in my two weeks’ notice this morning,” John said softly as he came in and noticed Rosie asleep in the crook of Sherlock’s arm. His other hand was busy thumbing through crime scene photos as he perused them and the lab results. Autopsy findings were still pending. John reached out to take Rosie and settled her firmly against his chest, still deeply asleep.
He wished he had had the common sense to put on his coat, or at least to grab his wallet and keys before he stormed out of the flat. He shivered again and tucked his hands tighter into his arm pits as the snow began to fall more thickly. Midnight. He heard the distant bells of St. James Church as they began to peal, signaling the arrival of Christmas. John knew he should trudge out into the snow and make his way back to the flat, but he was, if not comfortable on the park bench, at least content enough.
“Bollocks!” John shouted. “That’s Mycroft talking—not you.”
… else, up to and including re-organizing his sock drawer, but John figured what was sauce for the goose was, well, sauce for the other goose too. It would do Sherlock a world of good, he reasoned, to get out and about a bit more, to laugh and be seen as just one of the guys, and although Sherlock rarely participated much in the discussions since John forbade him from deducing people to bleeding ribbons—he mostly sat and morosely stared into his scotch---the mere fact that he seemed to be making at least a minimal effort went a long way to assuaging a few members of the NSY. Donovan had even, albeit somewhat grudgingly, stopped referring to Sherlock as
Phase 3 was about to begin.
“Watson……John,” Sherlock corrected after a brief hesitation. “Remember I once told you that potential flat mates should know the worst about each other right from the beginning?”
“John, I don’t think this is going to work. It doesn’t fit,” came a small, sad voice in the dark.
“You’re later than you thought you’d be,” Sherlock said with a raised brow.
“Sex,” Sherlock announced.
Despite the fact that mores and social conventions seemed to be looser and more accepting than they were just twenty or even ten years ago, he did not want anyone else to know about his proclivities.
“Hmmmmm….endlessly horny and desperate, eh?” John asked with a raised brow. “I hope that isn’t what you really think of me, by the way. After you ruined all of my clothes on the night I intended to go to that dating mixer thing, I began to suspect. It wasn’t until after you got Lestrade to call me and sabotaged my date with Caitlyn that… well, that clinched it. One is a fluke, two is a coincidence, but three is a definite pattern. But I didn’t see the pattern and fully put it together until about a week or so after that. By that point, it was starting to sink in that I was in love with you and had been for a while, so I guess the fact that you were being a complete prick mattered less than it ordinarily would have in the grand scheme of things.”
, John, then no, I do not
“Sherlock, I’m not trying to disrupt your life. You can just get another flat mate, yeah? I just can’t afford to live here much longer on what I earn doing locum work at the clinic. Originally, Mary and I thought it would be better if I went back to locum work; it would give me more time with Rosie. With two incomes, both of us working only part time made sense. And before Rosie, it was enough when it was just you and I living here at Baker Street, but now….” John trailed off.
“There are also the related charges, violation of the restraining order, breaking and entering, property damage… with her criminal history as a serial offender, they will throw the book at her, so to speak. By the time she gets out of prison, she’ll be an old woman, John. Her life will be over.”
“Right,” John muttered as he stood up and headed for the loo. “Don’t touch that,” John called over his shoulder just as Sherlock’s fingers reached John’s computer.
“I realize that you don’t believe I can feed myself, but I am an adult, Watson….John,” Sherlock amended in consideration of the fact that they had just shared a very intimate moment. “I realize it may have escaped your notice at the time, particularly given the fact that I placed your odds of going into cardiac arrest at approximately 15%, but I did have a rather satisfying orgasm myself.”
“Be there in five,” John said crisply and hung up the phone heading for the bank of elevators at the end of the hall. The underground offices and clinic were commonly referred to as being located in the dungeon; only one bank of secured elevators made them accessible to the upper floors, and there were two sets of stairs that were to be used only in the event of an emergency. John swiped his ID badge and punched in the button for the fifth floor.
“Whatever for?” Sherlock demanded. “You were a child. Your parents are responsible for tossing her out like last week’s rubbish.”
John hesitated then patted the spot on the bed next to him. Sherlock sat, still staring at John as if he had grown a second head.
“I wasn’t going to get high. I promised you when you and Rosie moved in that I wouldn’t do that anymore. I have kept my promise. I cannot guarantee that I won’t relapse, no addict can, but I will do all in my power to keep my word to you.” Sherlock’s affect was nearly flat. His words cool, detached. This, whatever it was, was clearly a subject that he did not want to discuss.
“You called for me,” Sherlock replied, his voice raspy in a deeper register than John had ever heard.
He had been on edge for hours, and regardless of how embarrassing it was going to be to come in under five minutes, it was going to happen—he could already feel the telltale tingles at the base of his spine, spreading out in long, slow, rolling waves deep into his abdomen.

“I assumed you used that term of phrase to delineate romantic love as opposed to fraternal or platonic love.”
Nine days after the incident, a desperate John found himself in his dingy little apartment following a long day on rotation. As the hot water beat down on his tired, aching body, he found his fingertips straying closer and closer to his arse, flirting shyly with the cleft and finally slipping into the snug channel to caress teasingly at his opening.
his wife, and so he tolerated affair after affair, her ridiculous spending habits, and her clingy, selfish behavior. Clara
“Oh goody, pictures,” Mycroft mocked.
“Please stay,” Clara answered quickly. “I heard what you said downstairs to your landlady, and I think you should hear this too.” She chewed her lip for a moment and then began fumbling in her battered handbag. Within a moment she had drawn out a crumpled sheaf of photographs and papers and offered them to John with a shaking hand.
“John,” Sherlock began hesitantly. “I know you didn’t want any special favors for Harry…”
His cock swung back and forth between his legs, a little fuller than its normal flaccid state but nowhere near erect. Despite that, he was very, very sure that he was going to come.
John had apologized to Sherlock after that incident, but as guilt began to gnaw afresh at his innards, he wondered if perhaps he didn’t owe Sherlock a heartfelt ‘thank you’ as well.
Sherlock looked puzzled for a moment. “I would want to continue on as we have been and simply add physical intimacy into the relationship. Nothing else would change. I would not expect you to give up your job or any of that other nonsense so many other domestic partners end up fighting about.”
