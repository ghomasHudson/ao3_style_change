John’s train of thought was aggressively pushed off its tracks when a figure walked through the door of the pub. The outside air briefly blew her long, sandy blonde hair around her face, but impatient hands pushed the wisps away from her face as she stumbled a few feet to take a seat directly at the bar.
A surprisingly sad sigh escaped the man and John knew he had gone too far. Instantly filled with regret, he cursed the empty cup in his hands. Sherlock stood up slowly, his head downturned to avoid John’s eyes. He walked right over to where John sat, plucked the cup out of his hands, and disappeared out of his sight into the kitchen behind him.
Philip. A wave of relief flooded John, exuberant joy that the man was alive and well and even continuing his career as a musician. For the briefest of moments, John forgot the duality of him; his ability to be both a great friend and an extraordinarily difficult man. It wasn’t that Philip was rude, but he was the sort of person to spoil a good mood rather quickly with his desire to always be right and follow the rules.
With a content smile pushed against the perfect head, John allowed his eyes to close once more and embraced the blanket of sleep that fell over him.
Sherlock Holmes moved like a man dying of thirst presented with a glass of crystal clear water. They were together, hands frantic across each other’s bodies as their mouths moved in clumsy unison, each of them striving to satisfy a carnal need deep within them. John’s head was swimming in thoughts of Sherlock Holmes, certain that absolutely everybody on Baker Street, everybody in London, everybody on the planet would hear the world as he knew it crumbling around him.
Every single room in this specific corridor was a time Sherlock could have- and should have- allowed himself to express his interest in John Watson. Every single time he stayed silent in reality and regretted that silence, he placed the memory here to revisit. To fix his mistakes.
Sherlock flushed, unwilling to face the prospect of singing for more than these six men. “No, no- I can’t- No, there’s been a misunder-”
.” He could hear Victor’s voice in his head as though the man stood directly next to him, speaking to him in that carefree way he always did.
How long had he been misinterpreting their relationship, then? How long had Lestrade considered him a friend while Sherlock saw him as a colleague?
“That,” said John slowly, the words feeling coarse against his dry throat, “was utterly spectacular.”
“You leaned into my hand.” Sherlock smiled to the ceiling, pleased with his past-self. “You tilted your head into my hand and your eyes fluttered closed as you did so. I rubbed my thumb along your cheekbone, a motion I had dreamed of for so many years.”
“How kind of you,” purred the barista with kind, bright eyes. Her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail and bright green eyes landed on Sherlock as she continued, “What would you like, sir?”
But he had an idea- just the beginnings of one. It would take a great deal of courage (which was truly not his forte), but desperate times called for desperate measures. And he was, indeed, desperate.
This story picks up immediately after the last sentence of the last chapter. Originally, it was going to be all one chapter but I wanted to separate them in the event someone wasn't interested in the smut portion.
Not heartwrenching in their endings, which were all jubilant, but in the knowledge that things hadn’t really gone that way at all.
He waited until the last rays of the day were peaking between the buildings of London, the city slowing down as its residents retreated into their homes for restoration. Their flat was growing dim with the day, only the kitchen light remaining on as their eyes and souls adjusted to the incremental changes in their environment. It was silent between them, a gentle breeze coming in through the window occasionally to tousle Sherlock’s hair as he stared intently off in the distance, lost in his thought while John read a book intently across from him.
His fingers drummed along his “desk” (really just a foldable, plastic picnic table with various office supplies), realising with horror that the show hadn’t even started. Who was it that was playing tonight? Midnight… something? It was some boy band John had no interest in. It didn’t matter who was playing, really. He couldn’t hear the music from here and he wasn’t allowed to see any of the performers. Still, it was cool when Elton John had been the performer.
Such an event occurred to John the moment he rose from his table after listening to Sherlock’s instructions. All at once, the floor beneath him was tilting, his focus shifting in kaleidoscopic patterns.
“I have a question now,” declared Sherlock after several songs spent in silence between them. The assertion surprised John, his eyes flying painfully wide from initial surprise.
During his years imagining it, the situation would change, the scene around them would change, and the exact dialogue would change. However, at the core, one thing remained true in all his imagined reunions: when John discovered the truth, he would be overjoyed at his return.
A sigh loaded with frustrated disappointment escaped Lestrade behind him. The sound shot a wave of irritation through him and although he fought against the urge to turn around that was welling inside him, the attempt was futile.
Eyes closed, he focused on the taste of him- the taste of Sherlock Holmes. What a wonderful taste it was, too.
A goofy smile was illuminating John’s face as he watched the man with fascination. Sherlock Holmes. Redbeard. His opponent. His saviour, really. He watched a small smile spread across full lips and John’s heart was leaping with joy upon seeing it.
He got out of bed with a mechanical motion devoid of humanity, Victor’s blood still appearing before him in gruesome detail, and marched into the kitchen to stare at an empty fridge. He was grateful for the excuse to skip breakfast. There was no way to stomach a proper meal. Instead, he allowed the refrigerator door to swing closed and stood apathetically still. The floorboards were cold against the pads of his feet, the dim morning light illuminating only the vaguest shapes around him, the city silent with sleep. The silence pressed in on him, phantom explosions audible just barely beyond recognition and it was too much- too much.
“I think they’ve got the right idea, actually,” Greg said, placing his contained bass against the wall where it would be safe while he joined his bandmates for a few drinks.
“Had a bit of service to take care of,” he said in way of response, pretending to be pleased to find himself talking to her.
“What the hell?” he shouts, and they were sincerely the only three words in the English language he could speak.
“Enough with the Goddamned questions,” John shouted into the air above him, fighting the anger in him that demanded to be physically expressed. The implication that this icy relationship was all that ever existed between them... When John could still hear echos of Sherlock's lilting laughter, could still see his dazzling smile in his mind after a night out...
John’s fingernails were hurting his palms from prolonged digging. “My point?” He suppressed the urge to scream into his hands. He was so tired of this dance. So incredibly tired. “My
“Alright,” he said, clearing his throat even though it wasn't needed and shifting in his seat even though he wasn’t uncomfortable. He would see right through him. “I was wondering… how are you married? It’s illegal to even
"David said he would stab me if I didn’t shut up, I told him he wouldn’t have the guts, and he proved me wrong.”
This appalled John into silence, his mouth opening to start many sentences that seemed unsatisfactory before finally saying, “But- does this qualify as “working a case”? We didn’t solve it and you’re passing the case to the police.”
Sherlock ordered the pair of them some drinks and invited John to take a seat with him at an isolated table that was a decent distance from the performers. From here, the music was still loud but the two could comfortably speak in raised voices without their words getting lost.
The detective was motionless on a stool, his mind evidently far away from the rest of them. There was a chorus of nervous shuffling amongst the bandmates as they waited in the green room for their slot. Sherlock, meanwhile, sat completely still. He could have been a statue of angelic stature were it not for the slight motion of his stomach that signalled breath.
The peppered hair of Sherlock Holmes was limp in his lap where his gentle head rested. The rest of him was spread modestly over their couch, John sitting upright on one end to allow Sherlock ample room to lay.
Tobias walked without a greeting and his mind clearly distant from the room around him. Sherlock studied him studiously, his eyes raking from his deformed face to his long sleeves with raised skin peeking out beneath his shirt cuffs.
If you've been reading along but haven't dropped a comment yet, I'd love for you to do so now! I have no idea who has been reading along all this time except for a handful of you. Thank you to EVERYONE who has read and made this journey worth it.
He swallowed hard against the thought, guilt surging through him for a reason he couldn’t pinpoint. He narrowed his eyes at Sherlock suspiciously. “You’re sure?”
John threw his whiskey down his throat, suddenly desperate to get away from this horrible, suffocating prison. He threw down a note of payment, not even caring about his change- not even caring about anything at all other than escaping to fresh air.
“Come along, I’ll accompany you back to a more recognizable part of town,” offered Sherlock, his hands linked behind his back. His tone was no longer harsh, no longer carrying an undercurrent of resentment, but there was a softness in it that wasn’t there before.
It's been two weeks since the evening Sherlock had confided in John their shared affliction. After the night ended in utter confusion for John, things between him and Sherlock are tense and John is desperate to repair their bond.
He’d heard a term once that stumped him. “Domestic bliss.” He hadn’t understood it and therefore he dismissed it as nonsense. He understood now. He understood, also, that he hadn’t ever lacked understanding of the term. Rather, he’d been terrified that he would never experience it; heartbroken that he never had. It was easier to reject its existence than accept that it was a sort of intimacy he would never achieve.

After some time- four drinks for Philip while Sherlock had barely touched his first- Sherlock fell silent, his eyes locked on something behind him in a suddenly deep concentration.
John’s head fell down against his own chest, a great sorrow threatening to crush him. “Is there anything I can do, my love, to convince you of my sincerity?”
John attempted a subtle glance at his phone, a difficult feat considering it was flipped upside down on the table. Fingers itching toward it, he looked around nonchalantly and then down toward the device only when his finger connected with the power button and he knew the digits would be displayed on the screen.
“I can see it all: the swanky leather seats, the fine cuisine, an attendant offering every accommodation that could be expected by someone like us- someone in the movies. The conductor will call us aboard and take our bags. He’ll say: ‘Right this way, gentlemen. Let me take those bags, you’ve been carrying them far too long. We can’t wait to hear your song.”
“That woman,” he said, practically bouncing in his seat, “was a client. Just a few hours after yourself, actually.”
John assembled his clothes, attempting to pull them on, though the task seemed to be taking him a great deal of effort. “How can you say that?” asked Sherlock through a stifled sob. “It would not have been better. John-

“No,” gasped Sherlock, panic creeping around the edges of his vision. John was too far away from him, too close to leaving. John needed to be with him, needed to stay with him. Under no circumstances could he allow John to walk away using Sherlock’s own words as logic to leave. “I said we have a million miles to go.”
With a smile he couldn’t have fought off if he tried, he said slowly, “That would be a fucking gas.”
“No, you’re going to listen to me,” said Al forcefully, revelling in the way Mel actually retreated further into his seat. “You’re going to book them and you’re going to pay them top dollar, you hear?”
The Rio radiated sophisticated energy, emitted the essence of success. The glowing billboard declared “Bernie and the Bellows EVERY NIGHT at 8” and John’s brain felt muddy attempting to comprehend the level of success that Bobby Soxers like that band experienced.
“Say,” John inserted with a tone to sound as though the idea had just occurred to him. “Why don’t you join me?”
Lestrade let out a bark of laughter that shook his belly. “For a man so clever, you are so bloody dense.” When Sherlock continued to silently glare at him, he shook his head and, exasperated, he said, “
“You,” said Sherlock suddenly, staring intently upon Philip who looked more than a bit alarmed to be addressed as such. “You were quite good.”
“Hold on,” John called, fingers lifting decidedly off his keys. “Greg, you’re making this measure minor. Make sure you’re hitting the right transition.”
“This is Andre Baruch for The American Songbook of Popular Music, brought to you by Bayer Aspirin. We’re are looking for a great swing band to write their very own song in honour of our boys in uniform.” John, whose ears hadn’t been particularly focused on hearing the words, suddenly perked up. It was the strangest of sensations, this total stillness as he intensely focused on each word floating to him from his radio. “Yes, it’s The British Songbook’s ‘Tribute to the Troops.’ One band from each county in Britain will compete in a preliminary round on December 16th. Each winning band from each county will then compete in a nationwide broadcast, live from London on March 22nd to determine who will appear in a spectacular new motion picture musical, and be immortalized in film history.”
It was a testament to John’s self-control that he did not leap up with joy. Rather, he remained seated, wide smile betraying him, and extended a hand across the table in that dingy, filthy bar. Sherlock slid his long, cold fingers into John’s with the caution of a deer taking its first steps.
.” When Sherlock’s expression didn’t change, John’s resolve steeled and he pulled the tray toward him. “I can handle my alcohol just fine, thank you.”
It was a small miracle how often Sherlock was laughing lately. It exuded out of him as surely as the sun’s rays shone upon the Earth and he was helpless to prevent it. He’d never been one to laugh outwardly for such trivial reasons, yet his giggles were nearly infinite with John’s blinding reflection cascading its light over his world.
They finished with a flourish, Sherlock’s heart racing unexpectedly fast. He gripped the inactive microphone with two hands, his smiling eyes looking at John as they finished together, reading each other's intentions in every small movement of their heads, John even adding a run of vocalization between Sherlock’s breath.
“Sherlock,” he offered politely to Greg. His pupils dilated slightly, his eyes going softer with a small smile and John worked to repress a laugh that was crying to escape. It shouldn’t have been a surprise that Sherlock was as stunned as John at Greg’s looks.
“Fine,” said Sherlock with poorly-controlled sourness. The word was clipped, curt with an emotion John couldn’t pretend to understand. It seemed an eternity that they stood there in silence, the both of them with every defence up and unable to move forward.
“Well, you see Mike, I feel as though I’m on a train,” he wanted to say. “I’m on a train that is speeding along a track with only one destination. At the end of this track is a solid brick wall that will result in my death. Knowing this, I wonder if I might as well just jump off. Control my fate. See, so long as I’m on the train, I will simply live in anticipation for the moment my fate arrives. I’m on this train alone. I have no friends, nobody who will even attempt to stop my jumping. Nobody will mourn me, nobody will care.”
Sherlock craned his neck slightly to the right, his eyes tightening as he attempted to focus on some faraway object.
Stumbling to his feet and backing away with a still-damp face, he shook his head against the horrible truth.
“Don’t look at me like that,” pouted Sherlock with attempted severity. “They’re comfortable. And can you believe that I can’t even feel the cold hardwood through them?”
Yes, the air was gone from around them. John wasn’t struck immobile from this man, it was merely a problem brought on by external forces.
But had John not reciprocated the secrecy? Was John not guilty, himself, of disguising his own attractions in men? He saw Greg’s face in his mind and hated remembering how he’d been instantly entranced and attracted to him. The thought sent stabs of pain along the lining of his stomach. Was his self-hatred for this portion of himself deep enough to have been projected onto Victor? Is that why he never confided in him?
The interjection was surprising enough to cause a burst of laughter from the lot of them, including Tobias. His generally stoic face was screwed into a smile that nearly touched his eyes, his deep laughter vibrating through the room.
It didn’t have to be that way anymore. He could confess his sins and plead for forgiveness from Sherlock. John could choose- here and now- to cross the bridge. To tell Sherlock everything, to break down and succumb to exposing every drop of regret he’d been dwelling in.
Sherlock moved through the wreckage of tables before settling on one table in the furthest corner. His long body moved into the booth with his back facing John. It was more than likely that this was a mistake, but the thought of those beautiful eyes facing the wall opposite him sent jolts through his body and he was helpless to resist the pull.
He had expected an expression of relief to flood his face, a rush of irritating thankfulness to spew from his mouth. Yet he did neither of those things; rather, his lips went pale with pressure, a mix of displeasure and determination solidifying on his pale skin.
“That’s the thing,” he hissed, still bouncing in his seat. “She wouldn’t tell me. She was being so secretive, she came and chickened out of telling me her case. I knew it was good though- probably involving her missing husband.”
John gripped sloppily at the edge of their booth table, his eyes falling in a lame attempt to centre him.
“To be frank, I am relieved to hear you say that,” said Sherlock in a hushed tone that was difficult to hear over the blaring music.
“Oh,” said John lamely, surprised this question hadn’t occurred to him before. “Well, no. I mean- yeah, actually. That’s a good question. How
When his body finally went limp under John, his hands released their hold and John gingerly removed himself from the still-erect cock. He swallowed the massive load, enjoying the feeling it was it went slowly down his throat.
Sherlock shot up, reaching his feet with impossibly rapid movement. He stared at the scene before him, his mind playing out a nightmare. Eyebrows furrowed together, mouth dry, his breathing shallowed until he was barely taking in any air at all.
There is was. All of Sherlock’s feelings were laid before the both of them. Having entirely exposed himself in body and emotion, there was nothing more to do but wait with baited breath.
” he ordered himself, forcing his eyes closed. It felt like sandpaper and keeping them closed felt unnatural, uncomfortable. With an angry huff of air, his eyes snapped open once more and his hands worked in knots over his stomach.
Sherlock’s breath came out in uneven measurements. His vision was blurring on the edges, his hands tremoring until he strained from the effort of reading the shaking words. His eyes shot immediately to the pile of letters he tossed aside so nonchalantly a short minute ago. The letter on top was addressed “
Joy crumbled his self-control and relief pushed him one-half step closer and looking into those familiar eyes, he thought John must surely feel his short breaths upon his forehead.
“Can I help you?” she asked, not unkindly, after several moments of loaded silence. Her eyes were constricted with curiosity, though John felt no hostility in the stare.
John was truly touched at the gesture. “Thank you, Sh- wait,” and his mind reeled with a realization. “What about the candles?”
Wiggins’ compliance with John’s lead was more than he could say for other members who grumbled at his instructions, save Sholto who silently obliged every note John gave.
With a swift, hurried motion, he removed the pants until the full length of Sherlock’s cock rose before him.
He got older and wiser in unison, learning to manipulate his curse to minimize the inevitable pain on others and himself. He didn't
His stomach dropped a bit lower, hastily letting go of the phone and allowing his eyes to comb his surroundings again. Imagining he didn’t notice the multiple pairs of eyes on him, he searched only for the familiar face he was waiting for.
A young man with a brand of acrylic paint that could only be purchased in bulk, a beginner’s sketchbook, and a notebook of notes on subjects taken by the average third-year undergrads. Comparing the time of the crime with the availability of materials lead to only one conclusion: the murderer took this specific art class.
officially part of the band,” he said, eye flicking to and away from Sherlock, “then we won’t be a band of veterans, will we?”
Lestrade’s smile evaporated, a look of concern glistening in his eyes under furrowed eyebrows. “Bloody hell…” he trailed off. He clearly had never considered Sherlock as a man who would have cried in his life.
Sherlock, half out the door of their sitting room, stopped in his tracks without turning around. “I don’t believe that’s your business.”
He watched with a mix of endearment and pain as John tried once-twice-three times to stretch himself far enough to place the star on the tree. With each failed attempt, John grew more disgruntled until, on the fourth attempt, he released a string of angry curse words and very nearly threw the star on the ground.
Slowly, excruciatingly slowly, Sherlock manoeuvred the buttons on his shirt. His face was pale with anxiety, his body betraying him with staggering hands and the chewing of his lip. As the shirt slipped away, Sherlock held his breath and turned around with the grace of a crashing car. His motions were jerky and sudden until his back was exposed and John was certain he would never breathe again.
Certain that he could feel the indent where John had laid that night, he confined himself permanently to the small portion of the bed where he would not disrupt the memory of John. Certain he could feel John’s lips on his when he focused intently enough, he vowed he would never touch them to another. He would never erase the memory of John from his hard drive.
, if it's any consolation, I fought against my urge to write heavy angst and gave these two a happy ending.
“Damn it,” he repeated in a whisper this time. One long breath of air sustained him before he rose from his bed and travelled into his kitchen, dragging his feet all the while.
“Hurry up!” barked Sherlock from several feet ahead of him. John, irate with self-consciousness when his feet failed to carry him quickly enough, sped up to a light jog. Why was Sherlock so tall?
,” he announced with heavy emphasis. The gift was clearly wrapped by Sherlock but the design of the wrapping paper was surely John’s choosing while the tag sat face-up with a message of love from both of them.
Sherlock muttered his good-bye and watched him walk away, a strange admiration in his eyes. “I like him,” he said decidedly after a few seconds of deliberation.
“Everyone knows it?” called John to the rest of them to a chorus of indistinct agreeance, shuffling around their instrument to prepare.
With his hopes at an all-time low and knowing the game was coming rapidly to a close, he unthinkingly moved his queen to kill one of his rooks and travelled back to his empty, miserable flat.
Sherlock Holmes was 15 when he caught the eye of a rather handsome boy. Zane Hope was only particularly extraordinary in two ways: he was Sherlock’s first crush and, more importantly, he was kind to him.
He held the letter at a distance from his damp face, drinking in the words as his last remaining source of life. He re-read sentences that brought him some semblance of joy with dizzying repeation, closing his eyes and imagining he could
Considering John had consumed nine shots within 20 minutes a bit over an hour ago, it was a small miracle that he was merely tipsy, perhaps slightly drunk. The combination of the splash of water, the high of the chase, the sneaking around, and the passage of time had seemed to clear his head, to lessen the impact of the alcohol on his mind. Still, the world’s edges were blurred, John’s helpless heart refusing to heed caution.
It was his turn now, John handing him the box addressed to “Mycroft” while the both of them were-poorly- suppressing bouts of laughter. Their faces were red, their lips trembling as they continued to look at one another in delight.
“Trust me,” John yearned, taking a step closer to his old friend. He sought eye contact and noticed something wary in Philip that wasn’t there before. He spoke quickly, words tripping over one another in an effort to get them out to his friend’s hesitant ears. “I have a plan: there’s this contest on the radio- a band competition.. A band from each county in Britain will be chosen to compete in London to perform a song to honour returned soldiers. The winner gets to be in a movie musical. I intend to put together a band of veterans, I know we can win.”
John allowed his fingers to trill against the familiar fabric of his red chair, dragging his fingers along the material to feel the creases beneath his skin. A delightful distraction for one moment, but piercing eyes were preventing the motion from stalling what must come.
“Look at me,” Sherlock softly commanded, willing his eyes to convey the sincerity of his words to the beautiful man laying next to him. “We’ve both searched our whole lives for how to be whole. Together we are pieces of a puzzle that fall into completion.”
“He’s exposing my jokes, Johnny,” he said, an arm thrown around John’s shoulders. “Don’t know if he can stick around if he’s going to continue doing that.”
He turned in his seat to catch sight of the subject of Sherlock’s gaze. The figure his eyes settled upon was handsome enough to cause a blossoming colour in his cheeks. The stranger was wearing a blue collared shirt that was unbuttoned to reveal a spectacular clavicle, his hair a shade so dark that in the dim light of this bar, it was impossible to tell if his hair was a dark brown or jet black. Either way, the colour of it complimented his pale skin. He possessed a square jaw, an easy crooked smile, a lean figure, and an effortless confidence that reminded him vaguely of Greg.
“No.” The word was a dagger in his heart, allowing his very existence to seep out of him instantaneously. “Sherlock, our separate lives have a million miles to go. But you and I… you and I are just one second.”
“John.” His name cut through the panic, focus aligning slowly on the vibrant eyes searching him from across the table. “It’s fine.” His voice was calm, sincere. “We don’t need to talk about him.” He was criminally beautiful. “I only thought of myself when I asked.”
But John had been experiencing insomnia every night so instead, the sudden knocks, like gunshots in the silence, resulted in a startled jump in his armchair. He rose himself up slowly, grunting against the effort of it and crossed hesitantly to the door. Who on Earth would be calling at this late hour? John didn’t even have guests calling during the regular hours of the day, and it, therefore, went without saying that there was never the slightest whisper of guests trying to break down his door so many hours after the sun had spread the last of its rays.
Together, their lives reached rock bottom. Together, their relationship was torn to shreds until it was an indiscernible wreckage of unrecognizable fragments. He was past hoping for a way out of the burning remnants of what was once his hearts deepest desire.
John felt his body elevate in temperature, suddenly the room was much too warm. He wanted to ask what the devil he thought he was doing, but couldn’t find the words. Barely had his mouth opened to attempt the words when, behind the menu, the other man spoke.
“I did not,” he said with an attempt at severity. Unfortunately, the result was rather weak, betrayed by the wavering of his tone and beet-red color of his cheeks.
,” he said, pointing toward Greg with a teasing finger, “are nothing but a never-ending parade of jokes.”
“I am not being defensive!” said Sherlock with such drama that was disproportionate to the situation.
Sherlock swallowed, throat tight and scratchy. He couldn’t react, couldn’t say anything, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t, couldn’t couldn’t-
A lazy hum escaped from between closed lips as John snuggled closer to Sherlock’s bare chest. Every precaution screaming at him to stop, Sherlock moved with excessive caution to wrap his arms around the back of the man he loved. When the initial results proved promising, he wrapped himself more tightly around John, pulling him closer until Sherlock imagined he could feel John’s heart beat against his skin.
“Sherlock,” hissed John through tight teeth before they were close enough for Wiggins to hear. “Is he high?”
When he reached the building, he changed out of his button-up shirt and black slacks into a warm robe. He wasn’t the slightest bit worried to be naked in front of strangers; the human body was not something to be goggled at or embarrassed by. He had a job to do. He was a bit worried about how he was going to analyze the classroom when he needed to keep his eyes in one place.
The words, swirling with intention and emotion, were 697 knives in his one lonely, weak heart. They should have killed him, these innocuous, insidious words. This should have been it- the grenade to end his life the way that grenade ended Victor’s.
After careful deliberation, Mycroft had obliged his request with the all-too-important stipulation that neither of them was allowed to tell Sherlock. He forged a draft letter and pretended his hands were tied.
that John would never allow Sherlock to endure ten consecutive shots. It was an unhealthy challenge he would embrace happily himself but would be mortified if matched by his companion.
to someone of the same sex. And Sherlock was… a man? But wasn’t Sherlock a girl’s name? He never had heard it, he supposed. A unique name for a unique woman, he’d thought.
As promised, John’s food was among the most delicious things that had ever been in his mouth. Even if it hadn’t been, John would have lied to secure a second date with the dark, funny, and handsome man that sat across the table from him. They were the same, the pair of them. Not completely, though. Sherlock was cold, analytical, and mysterious and John was reserved, impatient, and lacked control. They were different, Sherlock needing explanations of how his actions impacted others. John needing constant explanations for how Sherlock reached his conclusions.
“Ah,” whispered John, understanding flooding him. Scared. He was scared. “You know, alcohol can help with that sort of thing.”
“I can tell.” Then Sherlock shot him a smile so dazzling, he wasn’t surprised to find Philip at a loss of words.
“It does honour them,” urged Sherlock. “It’s supposed to reflect the wartime experience but it’s still gotta be worthy of the movies.”
So nobody had removed or searched for anything. Rather, someone had been tampering with the board in order to place this box there. But who? Who would have spotted the floorboard, known it could hold a package? Who would
“Then I was angry. I was so angry, Sherlock. I was angry at myself, of course, and I was angry at you. I had no reason to be, of course. But my anger was inescapable. I chose her and I was indescribably furious that she wasn’t you. I hated myself.”
Sherlock took time to consider it, attempting to remind himself he didn’t need to lie- not anymore. It was a challenging habit to break for someone who was so comfortable with hiding the truth. “John, your name is like beautiful art. I say it softly and it’s as though there is music playing. If I say it loudly, it’s as though I am praying. John, your name fills every gap that has ever existed, cured every illness. It’s brought to my attention the power of words, the power of- of love.”
If John wasn’t already sitting, his knees would have buckled from how provocative he looked doing it.
Yet apparently the truth was all it took to break Sherlock of his stoic demeanour. His jaw slackened, his arms suddenly unaware of what to do, falling to his sides with drumming fingers. His head cocked to one side, eyes wide with analysis that made John feel naked, exposed.
Swing. Create a song. In honour of the soldiers. It was John Watson to a T: musician, talented, soldier. The idea was forming more quickly than he could grasp it. The world was merely crawling around the sun compared to the racing thoughts within him. Andre Baruch might as well have proclaimed “John Watson: come and get your prize!”
In way of an answer, Philip’s feet shuffled uncomfortably beneath him, his eyes looking everywhere but John. He didn’t leave, didn’t continue, but stood there, teeth working on his lower lip.
Sherlock sighed, an evident sign of exasperation. “Because despite what you believe, you and I have a great deal in common. And I… enjoy your company when you possess the right temperament.”
For the most glorious of moments, Sherlock had truly believed- was confident beyond words- that it had worked. It caused the impact of John’s final words to slice him deeper than he had thought possible.
“She’s with women around her own age, though. She’s not talking to men so she’s not trying to rise above her station.”
Sherlock was the first to break the silence, his eyes still drilling into John with insane precision. “No more fake-dating for cases. No more kissing. Happy?”
Yet here, now, he felt the exact calibre of appreciation and loyalty to them both as he’d ever had to his fellow soldiers- and all while creating positive memories, not gruesome ones. It was a slow, freeing realization that John and Sherlock were not the only two band members he felt that camaraderie with.
“Please,” whispered Victor in response to his declinations. “I understand the danger. But… my grandfather is Jewish. My mom is, too. My country is at war. I can't… stay here and do nothing. I'm not built for it- being useless. I'll go mad.”
you’re a fighter. We deserve to have this shot. We deserve the brotherhood and joy this band brings us. We deserve to continue this band, even though the rich fucking company won’t help us continue it. We deserve a shot to win this all. We deserve to play on the stage and prove that everything we are- veterans, musicians, and friends- is worth living and fighting for.”
The image swam in his head, that first night John had slid his fingers under the hem of his lover’s shirt to discover a rugged surface under his fingers. He had stopped, kissing each one with whispered apologies.
“John Watson,” he said without thought, eager to learn more about the man. “And how, exactly, do you plan on helping me?”
Sherlock lifted a lazy finger to point at beautiful woman sipping on a bloody mary behind John in a booth seven seats down from them. Her long, brunette hair was pulled into a elegant updo that didn’t suit the atmosphere of the grungy pub. John gawked at her, wondering if Sherlock was making a joke.
Yet every time he saw a black curl, vibrant eyes, or a tall, lean figure, his heart would jump out of his ribcage until he realized with falling hope that, no, it wasn’t him.
“It’s direct to Kings Cross, gentlemen. And the train has first-class cars reserved for movie stars. And you know what? We’re going to be on one of them.”
“I-” John was suddenly speechless. He’d simply assumed knocking would be the hardest part. This continued necessity of courage was drawing him from sanity. “I was wondering- is Sherlock Holmes here?”
The halt in John’s movement, though brief and noncommital, overwhelmed Sherlock’s heart with joy. Capitalizing on the moment, he rushed on: “Yes, we could have ignored our feelings. We could have avoided all this in a million different ways. But you know what we did instead?”
Sherlock went pale instantly, his eyes falling to the table. “Not important. Tell me more about yourself.”
“Go back further,” Sherlock demanded, turning his hand counterclockwise and he watched the scene rewind to the beginning before letting his hand fall. Never before had he needed validity as he needed it now.
“I…” Words failed him. He looked down at the table, focusing intently upon how to express the manner in which Sherlock was incorrect. “No. They’re not reminders of the war. They are men who served but that’s not all they are. Their struggles are far more a comfort than a burden. Through it all, our problems get set aside in favour of a common goal. A purpose outside the war or our history. The band doesn’t rely on our experiences being relevant. We look around and see other guys who are going through the same thing but… the music is helpful. It’s good to be around the lot of them.”
“I’m saying it’s a case! A real, bonafide case! I’ve been starved John- starved and losing my mind.”
If Sherlock wasn’t so accustomed to feeling a deeply-ingrained resentment for himself, perhaps he’d have the decency to feel a bit more shame about his feelings. But he was already a “freak” and could see no way in which his love for Victor made him any more of one. He knew what people would say, knew the law, knew he should
Victor had smiled a mischievous grin and John had wondered why he looked like he had a secret. “I’ve got a special someone, yeah.”
He shrugged, forcing his eyes to the old, forest green curtain several feet to the left of John. “I had nothing going on so…”
“He isn’t,” Sherlock snapped, was a mix of emotions that John couldn’t read, a perfect storm of unknown thoughts and
It was John who answered. “Remember Moriarty’s nicknames for you both?” When Mycroft looked at him quizzically, John hurriedly added “Sherlock told me. Anyway, you two were the Iceman and the Virgin, right?”
“What was your original question?” Sherlock interrupted, tone still carrying an impatient bite that did nothing to provide John with the courage to ask.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, his smile faltering slightly as he caught sight of Sherlock, his eyes lit with curiosity.
“Ages ago?” John barked, unable to stop a howling laugh. “We’ve known each other all of three weeks, Sherlock.”
Greg’s laugh was an easy, floating thing across the space between them. “You know what? He doesn’t even know me yet but you can’t guarantee he isn’t sick of my antics.”
, but I must warn you that it's quite harrowing. I was positively nauseous after my research but it could provide character insight if you are interested.
“Three hours and seventeen minutes of rehearsals over the remainder of today plus two more sessions and six days until performance, Cap.”
I didn't actually use the words "comfort and joy," but I rather think I captured the essence of the phrase, don't you?
The announcement visibly surprised Sherlock, though his tone was even as he said, “Me too, actually.”
Without another word, Sherlock closed the cab and stumbled up the stairs to find John in his chair. Although he was initially chuffed at Sherlock for running off somewhere without telling him, his mood quickly changed. It was with a smile that John asked in complete disbelief whether Sherlock was drunk.
The gorgeous man stayed silent as he finished straightening the board. When he finished, he stood up, brushed his hands together, and met his eyes to John’s once again. “No, you cannot. But I can help you. The name’s Sherlock Holmes.”
Over the years, John’s ability to reflect light showed Sherlock the way to revealing the colours of life until they were no longer repressed within him. Each new colour formed together into a rainbow over Sherlock’s life that lifted away from his disguise.
“You know,” John said, suddenly on the edge of his seat and his body language exposing his own glee, “I’ve never told anyone before.”
Sherlock shuffled uncomfortably in his spot, uncertain of his role in this group of men. He glanced briefly at Sholto, who had taken to toying with his trombone while the lot of his friends brought in the drums. It was as though Sherlock was accompanying a distant acquaintance on an intimate date. He stood between motionlessly still and endlessly fidgeting, uncertain of what to do besides pretend to be preoccupied with his own cuticles.
There are also some spoilers in the songs before these so you aren't safe anywhere unless I tell you to listen to the songs haha.
go. If it didn’t go the way he expected, brakes were visible in his alarmed eyes. In this moment, Sherlock looked positively frantic that John apparently hadn’t been about to ask the question he thought he would. Yet it was something more… That look was the insinuation that
He shoved an unwrapped shoebox he had hidden beneath his chair into the unwilling hands of Sherlock and watched with falsely angry eyes until he reluctantly dropped his eyes to the box and opened it with hesitation.
His eyes had closed at some point as he spoke. The dancing had exhausted him and the alcohol was making compelling arguments to fall asleep right there, right then.
He counted them, an unnecessary act since he’d already known how many there were before the knight’s disappearance. Still, he counted: two pawns, two rooks, one knight, one bishop, and his kind and queen still intact. Alternatively, his opponent still had three pawns, both knights and rooks, one bishop, and their queen and king.
And there was the heart of John’s artistic vision: the scars were not ugly, they were a portion of the tree- of Sherlock- and where a portion of the trees life- of part of Sherlock’s life.
“Because he deserves to,” said John sharply, his eyes narrowing upon Philip, daring him to challenge him.
Allowing his eyes to droop closed, he leaned forward to connect his lips with the enchanting cupid’s bow that was so near.
In order for this to work, they had to be soldiers. Every single note, beat, and rest had to exude from the talented souls of men who served in the war. He could only hope that Philip was still playing. Actually, he could only hope that Philip was still alive at all.
“Yikes,” Greg said, laughing. His body shook with it, his head shaking as he said, “Sherlock? Thanks mum and dad, right?”
They walked offstage with the genuine confidence that had been lacking when they walked onto. Their places were taken by the next band and Al’s voice boomed in mumbled clarity as he made their introduction. As the six of them made their way back toward the green room, Greg was positively skipping for joy, practically jumping on the shoulders of Tobias as he chanted, “We killed it! We
“Don’t have to tell me twice!” he responded with a wink and took more than a sip of his amber beverage.
He wanted to grab him, kiss him, hold every bit of his body within his own, and spend the rest of his life confessing his unrelenting love for the brilliant man before him.
The man who opened the door stood impossibly straight, his body aligned in a perfectly perpendicular angle to the floor beneath him. He was dressed to the nines considering the fact that he was simply residing in the comfort of his own home. John had the instant impression that this man would never be caught with a single hair out of place.
“He doesn't know. I love him more dearly than any combination of infinite words could express. To leave him for the war will be the most terrible and trying task of my life. I will miss him every moment until I return. But I'm watching every man around me get shipped off to war. Where is their brother-in-law to protect them? I can't live knowing that I did nothing while my relatives, classmates, coworkers all pay the ultimate sacrifice. But... there will be no convincing Sherlock. You know that. He'll be furious with me if I go voluntarily and if something happens… he'll be furious with me for my choice the rest of his life. It has to look like I was drafted- like I had no choice.”
John’s fingers worked to undo the belt and trousers, freeing them rather ferociously from where they were caging what John wanted.
“It’s about the day that- that he died.” This surprised Sherlock, his eyes flying wide. Apparently, he was realizing that what was about to come was a revolution. He looked scared, trepid.
“And then I started writing- a feat I hadn’t imagined I’d manage again after- well, you know. I hadn’t written anything since, but it came pouring out of me like it had been there the whole time.”
“I know,” she said innocently in response to his defensive silence. When he continued to glower at her, she huffed and rolled her eyes, saying, “Now really, Sherlock. I know it’s not a date. Don’t look at me that way.”
“Wow,” he breathed. It was all he could say. It was like- destiny. Everything in their lives aligning perfectly to allow them to be married and in love and protected-
Inside was warm, mellow, and more welcoming that he could have imagined. It was as though he’d gotten home from a long day, as though he’d returned to a place of great importance from his past. It was the first instance of joy he’d felt at all since returning home from the war.
Sherlock released a throaty chuckle at this, an almost-recollection of his absolute stubborn need to remain by John's side at all times.
Did you know England doesn't use the term "mall"? Neither did I until I wrote this chapter. Also, it's only "cozy" in America, but "cosy" everywhere else. The more you know! I'll keep the chapter title the same as the American spelling since it's the prompt name, but it's properly spelt in the fic.
John crossed to shake hands with the announcers and, simply put, it was the greatest moment of his life.
“Doesn’t matter,” growled Sherlock, lifting one hand to the back of John’s head to keep them linked together. The pair moved against one another, their mouths exploring and nipping until John was acutely aware of how uncomfortably tight his trousers were.
Careful to mind the delicate seal, he slid his finger under the lip of the envelope and revealed its content. Shaking in anticipation, he pulled out the solitary paper within and began to read:
With that, he ripped his arm from John’s grip and strode away with all the power and pleasure in the world while John stood helpless and miserable.
It was so close to dying, his mind on a third level high. He lived for this, yearned for it to consume his every moment. The world was spinning in pointless circles until Sherlock could experience this next. He didn't always need this level of disconnect, but he did always crave it.
The stage stood a distance away, a gathering of five rather bored-looking men performing wordlessly with an array of horns and rhythm. Standing to the left was a man with light brown hair that swooped back from his planed cheekbones and sunken eyes. A blue button-up shirt with rolled sleeves exposed the first few inches of his forearms, the buttons undone slightly to reveal just a hint of his chest. His eyes were distant while his fingers toyed with the saxophone in his hands with ancient, unthinking skill.
He was silent for a moment, his mouth a hard line as he thought. “I’ve never successfully worked a case with another person before tonight.”
“Just a couple of days, sir,” he muttered, desperate to avoid even one more discussion with any living soul about the God damned war. “The place looks great.”
. He’d only seen the man twice yet it wouldn’t have been possible for him to not recognize the timber, pitch, and cadence of it.
“What do you mean he ran from you?” he asked in a slur. Sherlock’s heart relaxed infinitely when he had no visible or verbal reaction to the use of “he.”
a worse position to live in than the one he'd been in before. He knew it with certainty because this was it: John seeing Sherlock for who he really was and deciding that he didn't want him.
“Anyway,” said John uncomfortably, studying his shoes. “I guess I’ll see you within the next two weeks, yeah?”
“What?” he muttered under his breath, shaking his head to clear a lingering confusion before redirecting his attention back to the patrons socializing beyond the curtain.
The silence- it was his version of the lie of omission, a loophole that involves only holding back his real self.
He felt such kinship with this opponent of his. He yearned desperately to meet them, shake their hand, talk to them.
He led the way, pretending to be blind to the suspicious look that Sherlock was shooting the two the entire time since John left. Both Greg and John fell into step with the beat of the music, an unconscious inclination to march to the beat of the drum instilled in them both in the military.
He propped himself up on his elbow, his body contoured to look behind him. His eyes struggled to pull the source of the melodious voice into focus.
The pleasure of these moments of intimacy were lost with worry. He pulled John closer still and worked to push away the consuming fears.
Never, in his whole eight years of life, had anybody told him that his ability to reason facts was cool. His mummy and daddy were accustomed to it from Mycroft’s ability. By the time Sherlock came, it was old news. His classmates were always affronted, his teachers angry, the whole world furious that Sherlock had the nerve to exist so intelligently.
John’s soft, soothing voice urging him to sit up. He didn’t understand. Sherlock didn’t need to get up, he needed to sink deeper into this delusion until it swallowed him whole.
John was the same as himself. Ruthless, friendless. When all you can tell are lies, even the most important people in your life will not reciprocate hidden affection. It was a lonely life where villains become friends and friends keep their distance. But they’d had each other and in each other, there was understanding.
“When you perform in London, you will be competing again the winners from the fifty other countries in the UK,” continued Alex. “We can’t tell you much about your competition, though. Many of them haven’t competed, though a great number are holding their preliminary round today.”
With a burst of flavor, the cut above Sherlock’s lip split open and introduced a distinctly metal taste in their shared kiss.
Then several months later, the two were at a nightclub when Sherlock whispered that they needed to dance provocatively in order to blend in. John pretended to treat the matter as a military mission, nothing more or less than a necessary act to win the battle. But for weeks after, the memory came to him in vivid detail in the shower.
“Sherlock!” a voice called behind him. His heart gave one firm thump in his chest, his eyes widening because he knew the voice before he turned around.
Late January in Cardiff was insufferable, the cold penetrating through every thread on his jacket to seep into his skin, the cold reaching the very deepest portion of his bones. This excessively frigid air did nothing to quell his chronic pain. Wiggins curled in on himself, only willingly exposing his eyes as he tucked the rest of himself away beneath layers.
“All of it, really. I especially like songs where the strings are prominent. Cellos are great but I especially love the violin.”
“Well neither of those apply any more,” injected Sherlock with a smug tone, his arms wrapping more possessively around John’s neck. Their mother tensed a bit at the confession but said nothing. “I’ve got John and you’ve certainly softened since your... deepened kindship with Grahm.”
Then, so slowly John couldn't be certain it was happening, Sherlock's cheek fell slowly upon his head. The hair on his neck stood on end and there was no questioning whether Sherlock would notice the impact.
There. The truth. The gravity of it echoed in his head in endless circles, swirling down his mind in loops that made his stomach lurch.
Wiggins doesn't say much. Wiggins doesn't get too much attention. Wiggins is, by all accounts, a background character to the other members of his band.
Philip was the last to exit, his gaze narrow and suspicious upon both of them as he took an exit that was too slow, too careful.
“I’m glad you like them,” John responded with no judgement. He meant it. There was something deep within his heart that glowed with delight at the sight of Sherlock enjoying such a mundane thing as
“How the hell are you?” he continued booming even when the two were near enough to allow him to throw a friendly arm around Philip. “I haven’t seen you since ‘42.”
And we're back! Please bear with me, the opening and ending notes will be a bit long on this chapter.
This was once the most visited room, used to be the most precious room. Even now, his stomach fluttered with anticipation at the sight of it. Sherlock put one hesitant hand on the door knob, pushed, and he was instantly transported.
Mycroft, who possessed neither the time for Sherlock’s presumed lunacy nor an understanding of the breadth of his brother’s affliction, answered: “You’re born for it. The instinct to lie is as deeply ground in myself as it is, and always will be, in you.”
John would have laid down his life in an instant to make that statement false. He would have made any deal with any devil to alter the reality. He would have welcomed death without question if he could erase what he did.
They continued from one song to the next, their music executed perfectly with every note that John supplied. Sherlock found himself in relaxing in his own silence, his ears pricking with incorrect keys and intervals and rhythm which was always followed shortly by John’s corrections. It wasn’t long before John’s corrections subdued Sherlock’s anxieties and he was relaxing even with occasional incorrect music surrounding him. He was relaxed, content in his knowledge that John would quell his concerns.
Still, there was nothing to be done. Over the years, Philip was so accustomed to pining with no avail that it became a verifiable character trait. Philip Anderson: intelligent, shy, short-tempered, and also a hopeless, pining romantic.
Greg had agreed to take John to Tobias’ typical Friday night haunt and Philip had come along for the visit because, as Greg had said, “Johnny will need all the help he can get to recruit this guy.”
“Greg, would you happen to know the reason behind John’s chronic insomnia?” asked Sherlock cooly after several moments spent fixing John under an icy stare.
Who was Sherlock now? Truly, he didn’t know. He knew himself only in relation to others, and the realization of it was creeping up on him more quickly than he fancied. So much of him was an act for those who surrounded him- even if they weren’t there. For many years now, Sherlock had simply known himself in relation to John: what John would like, what he wouldn’t, what would make him laugh, what would make him scowl. Depending on each assumed reaction, he attempted to act accordingly. Sometimes he got it wrong, but the center of his universe had always assisted in guiding his choices.
“But I gravitated toward you as though I was not in possession of any control. I moved toward you slowly, smoothly, and you moved into me.”
things about people, I can… see, I suppose. Like, when I look at you, I can see your clothes and the manner you wear them. I can see your behaviour and I can see your appearance. Through my ability to see those things, I can guess certain… facts that accompany the physical evidence provided.”
God. The hurt penetrated deep within him and consumed every trace of joy that remained in his wounded heart. How could Victor not have told him? He understood the dangers involved in revealing homosexuality in the military, but
Lestrade heaved a sigh before rolling his eyes and saying in a diplomatic tone, “Look, I'm not judging you, alright? I just thought with- you know… your serious attitude and your... whole 'thing’... The drink choice is just a bit of a surprise. But it’s fine. Really.”
His shoulder ached, his heart was heavy, and a bead of sweat travelled down his temple to moisten the edges of his hairline.
If this was abnormal behavior from his patrons, the bartender didn’t show it. Absent-mindedly cleaning about, he looked up only when Sherlock stumbled over a rogue chair and threatened it with words of violence.
Smiling the whole time and allowing Sherlock to get it all out of his system, Lestrade nodded along the whole time. Sherlock was beyond grateful for this. Truth be told, his love had been dangerously close to tearing him apart for want of expression. Now, as he spoke it, he felt his heart release an ancient tension.
But it was never home and Sherlock is suddenly distraught with sorrow. He’d never fit in here. Never belonged anywhere.
“He was a client of mine,” said Sherlock slowly, voice too loud for the acclimated volume of the room.
John appeared somewhat surprised by his response, but he shrugged it off and, feet tapping to an unheard rhythm. Sherlock continued, “So… in light of...
He made Philip a background character where he was once a lead. John looked at him as though he were the sun and the stars wrapped into one in a way he’d never looked at Philip. It was not uncommon for Greg to run off and spend time with him too. If Philip and Sherlock both made a suggestion, the band was certainly going to agree with Sherlock.
It was hard to speak to him. It was hard to think of anything to say at all. He fell silent and before long, it had been quiet for too long.
“One more?” John asked, unable to remove his eyes off of the woman. “Alright; see that woman who just walked in?”
If John was gone, he would have no reason to go on. The thought alone sent a more violent sob through his body. His joints ached from the unrelenting nature of his emotional response.
P.S. to those of you that asked: my broken foot is finally healed and the boot came off yesterday. Thank you for everyone's well wishes. :)
He crossed over to the gentleman, taking the phone with ease as Stamford introduced him as an old friend of his named John Watson.
Sherlock scoffed unconvincingly at the words, his hands waving away the words as they were hurled toward him. “What did I tell you about getting the wrong idea?”
Italics in this chapter indicate (besides emphasis): one, Sherlock's deductions/inner thoughts and two, words that are sung versus spoken.
Despite it all, John couldn’t bask in the glory of performance. Instead, he looked upon his band members, seeing in them a level of freedom and relief that was mirrored in his own heart. Greg, beaming with every tooth visible and cheeks flushed with something other than alcohol. Sholto, upright as ever and providing small bows in a few directions while his eyes glinted with joy. Wiggins, who waved his drumsticks around at the crowd and smiled blankly. Tobias, who was trying desperately to seem annoyed with the audience or his fellow band members but, instead, was reluctantly pleased. And Philip, sheepishly grinning at nobody in particular and clearly receiving a larger round of applause than he was accustomed to, was more alive than John had ever seen him.
And that is how they came to this situation: John’s right hand shaking with a brush as he beheld the scarred back of his friend turned lover. John meant it when he claimed this man a work of art. After asking- begging- to see the scars, Sherlock had permitted it. John had traced the scars and fought back tears before asking Sherlock if he could paint him. Now, every curve, every dip, every centimetre of perfection combined to make what was surely more art than human. He was petrified by the actions taken against Sherlock to cause these scars, but they weren’t ugly. They were a part of him, a portion of his existence, and physical proof of his resilience in life.
Sherlock appeared so extraordinarily handsome, John could have written a sonnet based on his beauty. Although, in truth, the lot of the men were looking dapper. Each appeared that morning in the best clothing their closets had to offer. John, even, had sprung for a modest suit using a bit of the money they’d acquired from their continued gigs at various clubs throughout town. They had discussed the potential of performing in their respective military blues but ultimately decided against it. After all, this was a radio broadcast; they only needed to impress the live judges and a modestly sized crowd.
“Have you- er- seen who my opponent is?” he had softly asked one of the employees about five days into the game.
The impatient pity in her eyes burned holes through John’s ego. “Er- no. Just a few more minutes.” The waitress’ eyebrow elevated, her arms crossed low over her stomach. “Please,” he added after she did nothing.
The universe was an obscure heap of nothing for ages. It could have been years before the world came back, slowly, into a black-and-white focus. When it did, Sherlock knew only two things: John had made a choice and the choice was not Sherlock.
Sherlock sucked on his lower lip and finished with a sharp nip that aroused a groan of pain-induced ecstasy from deep within John. A burst of pain arose from the spot, and a growl of laughter escaped.
“I bargained with the the forces that be: If I could only have you in my life- as a best mate, as a business partner, in any capacity- then I could be happy. If I could find another lover outside of Mary, I could fill the voids within myself after I lost you. I fell into depression when I realized you were out of my reach and no one could fill that void.”
“Your wristband,” the man drawled as though it was perfectly clear what he was on about. “To get you back in. You’re wanting to remove it to prevent tempting yourself going back in. But if you take it off, you will still be tempted to return and, additionally, you will suffer guilt for removing the option. Whereas if you keep it on, you can do whatever you please with no guilt.”
“Oh dear,” she said, extending an arm to him though he stood slightly too far away for her to reach.
Instead, the one thing he meant to keep to himself came out. He regretted them even as he said them: “No. The kissing was- the kissing is alright. I don’t mind. Just- just don’t
“Oh,” he said, though his face was still crestfallen. “Still, great to see you! I was certain you would come to a later rehearsal. Didn’t expect you at the very first one after our set.”
Lestrade sighed and put his hands on his hips. After looking at the ground for a moment, he looked up and said in an even tone, “He’s changed you, Sherlock. I mean, of course, there are the obvious changes like how much happier you are and how much more patience you have with- well, with all of us. But more than that, you’re also more inclined to think of how your actions impact those around you. You’re- dare I say it- more social and kind.”
The wedding would be here before he knew it. He would watch the love of his life seal his fate with another. He would pretend to be happy for the pair of them. Sherlock would need to act the part of Best Man for a man who was pretending to fill the role of Loyal Husband. The pain of it all would certainly rival the pain of watching John leave.
Any minute now, the alarm would clamour with chaotic commotion. It wouldn’t be necessary, but the alarm wasn’t programmed to sense whether it was needed or not. It would go off and John, already wide awake, would throw an impatient hand to shut it off.
He fixed the man with disbelieving eyes and then went to work on cleaning the wound. “You mean to tell me that you
The silence between them was tense and tumultuous. Sholto and Tobias were still, Philip’s eyes wide, John’s eyes a blaze of flame directed toward the culprit of instigation.
As John slept, his stomach rising and falling in perfect rhythm, Sherlock watched intently. Minutes fell away into hours as Sherlock took in every perfect detail of their arrangement and committed it to memory.
Sherlock went rigid all over, his back stiffening and hands withdrawing into his lap. “When he gives me a satisfactory answer, I’ll let you know.” The words were so bitter, so loaded with animosity and anger and John’s heart constricted in equal measure.
“Howdy,” called Wiggins when they got a bit closer, his voice thick with a fake American accent that he dropped as he continued. “Didn't expect to see you here so soon again, Shezzer.”
Pupils impossibly large, he nodded fervently and hoarsely replied, “Yes. God, yes. Please.” His hands were clutching at the armrests, his body writhing for want of John’s touch.
Sherlock approached with a cup in each hand, his eyes cast deliberately downward as he approached John.
On his side, sinking deeper into the bed, his eyes produced a volume of tears unparalleled to any that he had ever produced before. The sorrow of loss wracked through him viciously without release, his heart ripping apart in what must have been a physical manner. His heart was absolutely breaking physically, for no emotional pain could possibly be wreaking this havoc on his body.
“Moving that pawn would have allowed a checkmate on black’s very next turn. It'd have been a nail in your coffin. Instead, you should move your king and use your remaining knight to take out the pawn protecting
What had Victor said? John wracked his mind, scrambling for the memories that were painful to recall.
John’s hands wrapped around his torso with astonishing strength. Sherlock’s fingers gripped either side of John’s face, holding it with equal tenderness and desperation. There was no ounce of hesitation or caution in their embrace; there was only unparalleled passion and years of desire poured into the connection. Their mouths moved together perfectly and their lips moved in promises of eternity to each other.
John thought for a long moment, hoping desperately for a satisfactory clever response to come to him. When none did, he conceded, “No, it just is.”
Sherlock’s long fingers rapped along the table thrice before they extended to reach the tray of shots. Anticipating John’s mirroring motion, his hand flew up to block John, wagging a finger at him.
In his vast, unending maze of tucked away memories, there were crevices, air ducts, hallways, rooms, storage cabinets, and music boxes stuffed to the brim with information and memories. John Watson did not get a music box or a storage cabinet or even a room. John Watson got a whole damn wing of the palace. In some modest rooms, there were held the precious memories of evenings, or cases, of dinners spent tip-toeing around each other. He had other, grand ballrooms where he would sit for hours to revisit the smallest of facial expressions that had been sent his way.
Yet nevertheless, they were the same. Reserved, hard to connect with. Cold, slow to trust. Together they fell, their hard shells crashing together to expose their softer insides with little resistance. They made each other laugh, the wine warmed their insides and assisted with bonding, and John found that he had been silly this whole time.
“I write songs.” Sherlock was flushed, cheeks blazing from the admission- though perhaps he was feeling the alcohol more than he’d been letting on.
(Temporary note: I did not have enough time before work to fully edit this but I need to post it now. Please excuse any minor misspellings and such. I will remove this note when I have had a chance to edit fully. Thank you.)
Several letters- nine to be exact- set in sealed envelopes, all tied together with a rubber band. The top envelope, obscuring the writing on the others, was addressed in a too-familiar script.
They stood still, silent, for an impossibly long time, John’s heart surely abandoning him with its violent palpitations. When Sherlock finally moved out of the gap, his hand leaving John’s mouth, they clamoured together into the street in silent chaos.
”- instead of remaining pristine to provide millennia of comfort for Sherlock, were illegible, ink bleeding across the page.
“What if,” Sherlock said so softly, John had to lean forward in his seat to hear it, “he doesn’t like me?”
“If you’ll excuse me, gentlemen and gentlemen,” declared Lestrade dramatically, “I’ve got a dame out there who is positively
” bellowed a voice from the entrance to the tent. It was loud enough, frantic enough to break Mycroft's concentration. He moved for the first time since they laid his body down and turned to see a short, filthy soldier running from bed to bed, his eyes wild with terror. Although his hair was covered with grime, Mycroft could see blond beneath.
His mouth wandered over the outline of Sherlock over the cloth, withholding the pleasure he knew Sherlock wanted to badly.
In the breeze, a lonely leaf is torn from its tree branch and floats away, the beginning of a long journey it will endure until it settles into a new home. It occurs to Sherlock with vivid clarity that it is the nature of the life to float aimlessly, a simple act of treading water before finding one’s home.
John smiled a genuine, wild smile. His first in quite some time. The motion was foreign to him- like the expression wasn’t really even his own.
“Jealousy really isn’t a good colour on you,” said Sherlock, placing his microphone back into its stand.
He shrugged off the thoughts and walked out of the backstage area, approaching the bartender, his heart rate elevating with every further step. When he stepped up to the beaten, discoloured wood, he called his order (double whiskey, neat) to the bartender and, spotting his missing bandmates several tables away, called in a honied voice, “Oi, you two come here often?”
What was he doing? This wasn’t him. He wished it was. He longed for the sweet embrace of his sexuality, longed for a corner of the community he could call home. In truth, he was unsure how to come to terms with his bisexuality without a portion of identity to cling to.
A rush of duty for his class mixed with constant admiration every time he needed to look up.  After drawing his basic outline of the body, he started drawing his face because strangely, that was what he wanted to remember most. There was something about him that he couldn’t understand, an air of mystery that John wanted to solve.
“Not yet,” he said with a false growl because being called “Captain” had been so extraordinarily hot, he needed Sherlock as badly as Sherlock needed him now.
“I want you all to imagine… that there is a train.” John spoke with wavering words. He made no attempt to fix them but allowed the weakness of it. “There is a train that leaves from Cardiff General at quarter after five. Do you know where this train goes?”
“Wait, wait, wait,” John interrupted rapidly, fixing Sherlock with a disbelieving look. “Did you say you sing?”
Sherlock was incredible, of course. His vibrato more controlled and expertly executed than any Greg had ever heard on a man. The greatest moment of his performance came, however, when he would cross to the piano and, maintaining eye contact with John, scatted his way through several difficult key modulations. They worked as a wondrous unit, John’s eyes never wandering from Sherlock’s, even as his fingers continued to perform wondrous melodies. They communicated nonverbally with an ease that couldn’t have gone unnoticed by anyone around them. They acted as a unit, two halves of a whole, two drastically opposite sides of one coin.
The echo of war burst into the room, a cruel reminder that there was one thing- one impossible thing- to do first.
He leaned his head back again the headrest of his old, peeling chair. If only he could sleep for two hours, he would be refreshed. Surely he could just rest his eyes, just doze off a bit-
“Which story would you like to hear, my dear?” John's fingers looped in and around the curls so delicately, a lesser effort wouldn't have moved the hair at all. He thought of the beautiful mind beneath these curls. Once storing every memory like a computer and now weakened with age- but always beautiful.
“The evidence, John!” he bellowed with agony. “I fell and couldn’t obtain the evidence. It got away from me. The culprit of those murders is still out there and I’m no closer to finding him than I was this morning.”
“Look at me," John continued. "Look at everything I’ve gotten myself into, and look at the life I’ve built for myself. Once you do that, I need you to tell me: do you know something I don’t? Because I see no way to be with you. How can I possibly stay with you? How do I leave everything behind? How do I tell people-”
Sherlock is 72 years old and Baker Street is long gone. Now he spends his days tending to a wonderful array of bumblebees, drinking in every passing moment with a content pleasure that fills his heart with delight. Beside him, always beside him, is John Watson wearing an oversized sweater that doesn’t fit his shrinking frame. John has a smile that he doesn’t know is there. It’s the sort of smile that comes from a blissful soul.
unrelated to this chapter, but there is a bit starting at 1:38 and ending at 2:18 that is related. I'm not going to link it yet because there are portions of the song that will be referenced in upcoming chapters and we don't want spoilers. ;)
Sherlock was no longer looking at him, but down at his own knees. Though his face was unreadable, it seemed to lose a bit of its edge and John’s chest eased the slightest amount.
Victor’s letters- his lovely words formed with love and thought and the very last of such words Sherlock would ever be able to cling to- were warped.
John had arrived to this rehearsal a million miles above the world, filled to the breaking point with exuberant glee. He’d never been more excited to present a piece of music, proud beyond words of Sherlock for having composed such a flawless tune.
He stood in line, mind racing over his next steps would be in the case. He needed to scout out family members, needed to consider who might know anything of importance, needed to uncover the beginning layers of this town. The past two days’ worth of sleuthing had not uncovered much and his eyes scanned those in close proximity to him now for any potential leads. He saw three smokers, two recent divorcees, and one man that was lying to himself about his sexuality. There was nothing to imply either of them had spent last Tuesday strangling a woman to death.
He told himself it didn’t matter, that he was just looking to see if he would come. He was worried about him.
“Please,” he choked, his voice sticky and eyes flooding with waves of tears. “Please, he’s my friend. Please, I need to see him- he was- he was my friend.”
Shit. John’s eyes racked the board, desperate for a way to kill the queen who was one move away from a checkmate. He was so surprised, he couldn't even think to scan his surroundings. Instead, he scanned every piece, imagined their best possible move for his given situation, and juggled between two options: save his king as a short-term solution or kill the queen but leave himself vulnerable to attack from one of their rooks.
Those eyes were impossible. Impossible to exist, coloured with a pallet of radiant blues. Impossible to resist, depth of soul visible with a call to him like the call of a siren to a sailor.
He was all angles, cheekbones protruding to accent deep eyes, framed by a bushel of dark eyebrows. His cheeks were sullen, his jawline defined from a long, dainty neck. In fact, many aspects of the man were dainty, contrasting by simultaneous edges and mysterious attitude.
There was a fire burning within him that, initially the smallest of flames, expanded exponentially to a raging force of nature. There was no sight, no reasoning, only the burning pain of lost dreams.
“Philip, you skinny son of a bitch!” came a laughing boom of a voice from somewhere to their left and both of their heads turned simultaneously to the source of it.

It played all the time. The tune was easy, he could have done better with it. Yet the song’s promotion of life’s return to normalcy was inescapable and a perfectly ironic background tune to his struggle. Surely he wasn’t alone. Surely the others were suffering. Surely even Victor’s widow-
The rest of the letters were more or less a guessing game. The outward writing would only provide hints up to a point. Taking a guess, Sherlock selected another letter that seemed to be more confidently written than the first and was still clearly written with a great deal of caution.
“It’s fine,” he murmured in response, his eyes cast downward. He thrust the cup into John's hands and walked away before he could say anything further. More similar to a wounded animal than any man he had ever seen, John’s heart wrenched with regret.
John hadn’t even come back to clean the place up. This deduction caused a wrench in his already hurting heart. Oh how quickly John had abandoned their life together.
It was too much for them both. Finally, John wrapped his mouth around the long cock that was dripping with desire. He went down slowly, making sure to withhold maximum pleasure by working his way up and down the shaft in incremental pieces until, finally, John’s lips were touching the base of Sherlock’s cock and he could feel the entirety of Sherlock’s attraction inside him.
The alarm rang with vicious intensity, pulling John from the depths of his thoughts. After swinging one arm to silence the contraption, he dragged one heavy hand along his stubble-strewn jaw and contemplated exactly how many hours one could survive without sleep. Alternatively, how long could somebody survive with a guilt that crushed them under impossible pressure? One of those would surely be his undoing.
It was impossible to know when the tears started. It was most likely that the tears were forming from the very first moment his fingers slid underneath the wax seal. The certain last time he would open a message from him. Every motion Sherlock made was intensified. Every word he read would bring him one step closer to the end- every letter he read brought him closer to a reality where he no longer had anything left to receive from the only man who ever mattered. Victor was his only solace in this cruel, unfeeling world.
He claimed a desire for safety. He claimed love for Mary. He claimed no realistic future for with the consulting detective.
At 21, Sherlock Holmes vowed he would never succumb to the cruel temptation of emotion ever again. Never again would he foolishly hope that somebody might like him- even tolerate him. It was too painful.
“Out with it,” John continued relentlessly, bu still the smile on his face was light and encouraging. “What are you scared of?”
Now that he knew what he was looking for, he hand-selected a letter with handwriting so untidy and jagged, it could only be the writing of a man who had just finished pouring his heart out. He couldn’t be bothered to attempt tidiness after he wrote this letter.
Mycroft: *leans back in his chair and puts his feet up on his desk and waits for his brother to regain consciousness for Maximum Drama™*
So there it was. Philip didn’t like women and also it was possible that he was enamoured with his best mate.
We're all in agreement that Sherlock is only the way he is (distant, cold, mean, etc) because he grew up isolated with only Mycroft as a role model, yeah? Therefore we can agree that, if Sherlock was shown love, acceptance, and friendship from a young age, he wouldn't be so bitter, yeah?
“Do you like it?” Sherlock asked, excitement ringing through his voice. His arms gestured around them and John needed to take a moment to answer.
The boy smiled wide enough to strain his cheeks, shaking his head slightly. “That’s really impressive,” he said simply.
“An exchange,” Sherlock continued below a whisper. “He’s giving her money, she’s giving him a package. Good God-
Sherlock cocked his head to the side, his eyes narrowing. “You don’t believe any of them could be gay or prisoners or war?”
Sherlock could not bear to sleep on this perfect night, knowing it may be the only one he ever had with the man he loved so ardently. He pushed back tears at the thought, recalling the woman who was home at this moment, blissful in her knowledge that John would marry her. No, he would not sleep this night. Not when John was resting in the cradle of Sherlock’s elbow, the ghost of a smile still on his lips.
"I never meant for it to happen. Please forgive me," I beg, the bomb already diffused but I don't tell you because I need you to forgive me.
Sherlock seamlessly slid past John and he fought against the impulse to treasure the sensation of his body sliding so close to his own. There was a lingering gust of air after his motion and John had to force himself to stay focused and close the door.
He was rigid as a tree for one long second before he stepped away hastily, his eyes burning with desperation to get away from John. “Nothing,” he said incriminatingly.
It was evident that Sherlock, too, was surprisingly sober. Though John could tell the man wasn’t completely unaffected because of the lazy smile that had cemented itself on his regularly guarded face.
He was so certain. It caused a pause in John’s own certainty. Come to think of it, he’d known Philip since his uni days and he’d never seen him with a woman. But still…
“Is that how you know John here as well?” asked Greg with a nudge toward John. “Or did you two used to perform together?”
When they were on a case, John was exceedingly invaluable. Sherlock quickly deduced the simple reason: John was a wonderful conductor of light. Where Sherlock’s mind was a mechanical operating system, John lent creativity to expand his narrow views of the world.
Sherlock thought hard on the question. When was the first time? “When I was five, I fell in love, I think.” When Lestrade raised his eyebrows, he continued with a wave of his hand, “It didn’t last. He ran from me.”
John put his hands up in mock surrender and watched as Sherlock picked up one shot glass with clear liquid to his lips, throwing it back and making no response face when it went down. He slammed it upside down on the table again and, before John could get a word in edgewise, plucked up a second glass. Then a third.
“Wha- Sherlock!” bellowed John in surprise as Sherlock’s hands firmly gripped John around his waist and hoisted him up several feet in the air.
In the silence, he heard the growing crowd. He cleaned the wound. The was ever-growing. He was preparing for stitches. There was a sudden rise in applause and screaming he knew the crowd was onstage now. He asked Sherlock if he needed to bite down on anything, which Sherlock refused. A distant echo of music floated through the air around them, a crappy guitar line entwined with contrived drum beats. He didn’t let himself think about how hot he was shirtless. The music wasn't awful, but it certainly wasn't any good. He could tell from even the ghost of the song.
The music progressed into the second verse, all thought lost to unabashed anxiety. Soon, the entrance for his next singing portion was passing and his voice was stubbornly silent.
John’s stomach tightened, his mouth forming an impossibly hard line of tension. A fresh whisky was placed before him. He gripped the fresh glass until he was certain he could shatter it with his grip. “What happened?”
The awful memory played before him, putting pins into his heart as he saw a monster that looked like himself beating Sherlock Holmes until he was physically prevented from continuing the assault.
Headcanon (on my own fic... is that a thing?): John was talking in his sleep and proposed to Sherlock. Inspired, Sherlock went out and bought a ring, confident beyond a doubt that John would say yes when he proposed. It was, after all, John who did it first. But alas, John didn't remember the dream and Sherlock was too embarrassed to explain what happened until several months later.
He almost raced back to the table with the note, worried that Sherlock may have left to avoid John’s invitation. However, he remained seated, eyes wandering around the room and hands toying with the now-empty glass.
“W-wait,” said Philip, torn between indignation and fright at speaking up. “I can’t- John, you know- law school-”
“N- Yes- I mean-” His mind was on fire, so terrified that there was no way out and terrified of every horrible thing that could happen if John couldn’t understand that all this time they’d been mistaken- it was all so obvious now.
John took once glance at the name of the song before him and flushed a deep scarlet, trying desperately to keep it hidden. The title filled him with hope and subsequent shame.
Taking her cue, he slipped into the seat next to her, trying with everything in him to not slur his words, not to misspeak, not to expose his intentions. He saw Sherlock slip into a seat that Mary now had her back to, within earshot so long as the man between them didn’t begin to speak.
The diming spring light cascaded through the half-curtained arched windows, the delicate light casting the romantic atmosphere that was exactly why John had chosen this place.
Sherlock looked at him with wide, crestfallen eyes that lurched a pang of affection into his heart. “You don't like it.”
He lifted his thumb and middle finger to one end of the ribbon, pulling it with grace to allow the mass of string to tumble off and float gently to the floor. He removed the lid with shaking hands- though he didn’t know why- and gazed inside.
When the world rotated for enough time to allow them the strength to break apart, Sherlock rested his forehead upon John's.
And in the thick silence that followed their introduction, there was nothing left to do but play. His fingers hovered above the keys only for the slightest of seconds, connecting his eyes with Sherlock’s, exchanging a nod before playing a simple, rapid scale to lead him in. His voice followed the scale, rich baritone of perfect pitch filling the room until nothing else- the contest, the war, the trauma- mattered. There was only the music beneath his fingers and Sherlock beginning to sing:
“It’s lonely being brilliant,” confessed Sherlock in a whisper, the rarity of that truth surprising even Sherlock.
An infuriating roar of laughed escaped his mouth and John struggled with every bit of self-control he possessed to prevent himself from throwing a punch. “Look,” he said in a stern but still engagingly amused tone, “we’re all grateful for your service. We are! But I have nothing for you here.”
As he stares at his beautiful, perfect, thoughtful, wonderful, dreamy, flawless, strong husband, a bumblebee lands unassuming on his shoulder, the buzz of it ringing in his ears. The wind is rustling just enough to blow his curls aside, the scent of this great valley blessing his nose with the delicate scent of lavender.
Sherlock fought off an enormous smile until his cheeks hurt with it and John declared, “Alright, then. Sherlock will join us for about half of our set.” Then, directing his words to Sherlock, he continued, “Can you learn all the standards in time?”
Then the angelic voice once more. But it didn’t speak soothing words, no declaration of love, not one kindness granted. “The arse-end of the universe with the scum of the Earth. Look at me,” it demanded, and Sherlock was spiralling.
Truly, John was unsure whether or not he should laugh. The look on the man’s face was so serious, he decided to say, “That… would...
Al’s voice came on over the microphone, announcing to a suddenly hushed audience that this evening would see three performers. Without further ado, he called to the stage-
“Please, you insult me,” he said, though his playful expression was at odds with his words. “I worked with my brother on certain classified projects- intercepting messages and attempting to decode the secret language, that sort of thing. I worked briefly on some undercover diplomatic work, posing as my brother while he worked unsuspected in other sectors.”
“No,” John teased, drawing out the word dramatically. “That explains the tree, the garland, and the lights. It does not explain, however, the candles. They're not decoration, they're- scenery?”
Tobias, Greg, and Philip all diverted their eyes in displeased submission, their wrath simmering beneath the recognition that John was correct. Sherlock, Wiggins, and Sholto, meanwhile, continued their interested stares, the support of those three pairs of eyes providing him with the will to continue.
There are some things so ingrained in the minds of a society that they create links where there is no conscious train of thought to connect them. Colour is just one example. In Western Culture, the colour of darkness is evil.
There are ten days until the fateful preliminary for the band's contest. John has no song and no plan until Sherlock shows up at John's flat in the dead of the night with a solution.
There was a time when 221B had felt so much like home, Sherlock could cry from the sense of belonging he’d felt there. That feeling was gone for a while. Namely, when John wasn’t there. His marriage. Their fallout.
John was laughing despite himself. Philip Anderson, the lawyer. It made perfect sense. He was always analytical, nit-picky, technical to a fault, and mistrusting to boot. “Yeah, that sounds about right. Good for you, mate!”
“Me too,” said Sholto, every head turning to him in surprise. Up until then, he’d been utterly silent. “It’s brilliant. It will hit home for our audience. And frankly, it’s our best option.”
He finalized the explanation with the smallest of sips from his glass and John found himself suppressing a smile and an eye roll all at once. His insides were warm and light with alcohol and his extremities were losing feeling. Indeed, he had to remind himself that he’d also had two drinks at the last bar to avoid feeling like a light-weight. He’d only had one beer here.
He’d made one promise. One small, impossible promise. Victor’s voice echoed around his head until he was dizzy with it.
No. No, it wasn’t okay. Without realizing he’d made the decision, he was on his feet and throwing open his bedroom door. He felt as though he were floating toward his destination rather than stomping like a maniac in a manner that would surely offend the floorboards. Rounding the corner with his eyes on the prize, he spotted the light come to life under the doorway and a wave of newfound anger mounted in him. So Sherlock
“Don’t worry,” he said, matter-of-factly. He moved around John fluidly, the motion sending a gust of air toward John that smelled of woods and coffee, and began to arrange the chess pieces into upright positions. “I remember how they were.”
“But… it was over. The grenade- it went off and he was still down there and I couldn't- I didn't- I never-”
“Sherlock, I have nearly no words to express to you the guilt that has plagued me every living moment of my life ever since I walked out that door. The moment- the
“I guess it’s the rush, the activity. There’s so much life. There’s so much to do, so much outside of yourself.”
Of course. Of course Victor’s husband would be a brilliant model. Of course sweet, caring, funny, handsome Victor had an equally perfect spouse. Yet there was something…
But why was the dust pattern here so thin? Who had been here to check this floorboard and what had they been looking for?
“Morning,” John said, tone hushed and coated with sleep. He moved closer, leaning his head further back to nuzzle Sherlock’s chin with the tip of his nose. The effect of the touch was instantaneous, his heart fluttering up his throat while his stomach performed a dangerous series of summersaults.
“You know, it sounds so easy when you explain it all like that,” he said, just drunk enough to be unable to prevent the dreamy note of admiration in his voice.
“I don’t. Not really, at least,” he said, the traces of disconcert painting his face. “I knew Tobias from training and he told John about me. He recruited me for this… idea of his.”
John’s eyebrows pulled together and he considered the day: the 17th of February. No performances, no rehearsals- why would Sherlock be here? They never met here.
And he knew, frozen in that spot, that he needed to answer John one way or the other. Whether or not he joined them was entwined with whether or not he enjoyed himself and John’s eyes were too inquisitive, too loaded. Yet-
The war was inescapable. The inside air was suddenly suffocating, viscous as molten lava and desperate to choke the life from him.
And suddenly all the pieces fit together. He must have won some sort of contest, or been dragged along by a friend. He wasn’t here because he paid or because he wanted to be; he was here because he was obligated to be.
(Source: random websites on the Internet. I could easily be wrong about this, feel free to correct me.)
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine,” Sherlock asked after noticing there was no lump in his trouser pockets where Mike Stamford usually held his mobile. He willed his voice to remain steady, cool. He dared not allow his eyes to linger for another moment after he began speaking- his lingering gaze would surely betray him. His phone did, of course, have a signal. But sometimes lies served a function, after all.
John didn't respond but smiled down the piece in his hand. After a moment of contemplation, John walked gleefully over to their tree, magnificent in size and adorning a glorious array of ornaments, lights, and garland. He put the star in his right hand, used his left hand to steady himself against the wall, and stretched himself to reach the top of their unassuming tree.
The question was unexpectedly loaded, his body freezing entirely as six pairs of eyes landed upon him. He’d so nearly forgotten the reason he was there at all. John’s words floated through his mind, clear as the moment he’d spoken them in The Crescent.
She shook her head and smiled down at the newspapers in her hands. “Alright, alright,” she conceded. “But you look very nice and I am very happy for you.” She crossed over to him to place a kiss on his forehead before leaving. She pulled the door closed behind her and, before it clicked shut, she spoke in a coy tone.
John stared unabashedly at the feet, warm and cosy in fluffy fabric that hugged the long feet of his friend. His toes wiggled a bit as he thought and the result was a chorus of dancing penguins.
No. This was special. He would wait. He didn’t want to rush things with this man who was filling his heart with more joy than he had felt before.
“Er- a gig’s a gig,” he muttered with poorly-disguised disappointment. He was twenty-seven years old and now doing exactly the sort of performance he did at seven years old.
It was a dingy bar, the air thick with poor ventilation. Each table bore signs of abuse. Two tables were missing rather large chunks of wood, one table was criminally crooked and John was convinced drinks would simply slide off it, while another table-a booth table- was so littered with dried, sticky rings, he would have been surprised if the table had been cleaned even once in its long life.
Removing his lips, he dragged his tongue slowly from the base of Sherlock’s dick to the head, where he covered it in a new layer of thick saliva.
Or perhaps he wanted to scream his truth. Perhaps he wanted to walk out of here and unapologetically be the person laying starved deep inside him. Perhaps what he really wanted was permission to drop his charade.
Mycroft impatiently opened the box, quizzically examining its contents: a tacky snowglobe, a rather ugly sweater that would surely itch, and a collection of decorated sugar cookies.
The gorgeous lush who plays bass is trying to keep the memories of Dachau at bay. Before being recruited to the band, his nightmares wouldn't permit him to sleep through the night. Seven months later, the drink is still an extension of his hand and memories still haunt him, but all is not hopeless.
When John seemed to truly see Sherlock, those moments were with him eternally. It was a fresh hell, a torture no foreign intelligence cell could inflict upon him, to watch the narrowing of John’s eyes when Sherlock was too close to a truth, too insistently touring the lies forced from him. Other times, he would forego that pain of analysis and instead watch John’s hands curl on themselves as his body seemed to fight against actions that would contradict his silence.
Of course, he learned in time that that was just how Greg acted. That knowledge didn’t prevent Philip’s stammering every time he flashed a perfect smile his direction, but it did prevent him from developing an unmanageable crush.
His heart was surely trying to rip itself out of his chest with its pounding when his eyes lay upon the table with the game on it. Offering a half-grin to the employee who greeted him, he made his way to the board and saw that there was, in fact, a competitor for him. The paper read:
Sherlock took a deep breath, his ageing body shuddering with it. “My name is Sherlock Holmes. You are John Watson. We are in love and we've been married for over forty years."
Mycroft was not without his humanity, despite the official party line that he maintained. When he discovered the war was coming, he took the appropriate measures to protect both his brother
“Ah,” Greg said joyfully, not a care in the syllable. He took one long drink from the glass in his hand before continuing. “I’ll tickle your catastrophe.”
The lot of them walked onto the stage with a confidence entirely feigned, falling into position, allowing silence to fall for one simple moment. In that moment, John’s fingers hovered over the keys of the magnificent Grand Piano and he understood with alarming clarity that
He would kill them. He would kill the man who did this and he wouldn’t rest until he did. Spots of red flashed in front of him until he didn’t register the scars and there was only blinding fury.
The room was too dark, now- too cold. The place felt empty and interwoven with his discomfort. The dingy light was pressure on his aching soul and he longed for the relief that was Sherlock’s arms. Why-
“A ring. Physical evidence. Married. A logical assumption based on what the ring means. Yet he gets angry. I encounter much of that in my life.”
There was a general murmuring of disinterest as they fell away without a second glance. John followed Sherlock out to the lobby where the air was filled with triumphant jazz. The bassist was slightly offbeat and the trumpet was blowing too hard, but otherwise, it was acceptable for setting the atmosphere that Al desired in his club.
Being in the room made him antsy. He hated it, this waiting. He’d happily work all night if he thought it would do a lick of good. But this was not London, and the city slept with the sun. Instead, there was himself, this room, and the silence.
The sensation of hearing the band end, lining up for their entrance, and beginning their walk onto the stage was surreal. John had performed many, many times before this. But never had there been so much riding on his performance.
The music swelled around him and his panic rose viciously, the first bar passing him in the blink of an eye. His microphone was distant from him, all reasoning for agreeing to this fleeing him in one swell swoop. He couldn’t have chosen a worse way to “put himself out there.” He didn’t belong here.
“That’s bullshit, Watson,” said Tobias. “None of us would be here without the promise of the reward.”
him. What was he doing? Had John not dreamed, wished, and longed for the man since the day it all began? For as long as Sherlock had been in his life, John had been helplessly in love. Why, then, was he walking away? Why was he breaking Sherlock’s heart? Did he even have a reason?
Focusing quite hard, Sherlock narrowed his eyes. Putting every ounce of effort he possessed into the act, he shot daggers at Lestrade with his eyes. He leaned forward in silence, his mouth a hard line.
He extended one smooth hand to John, which he shook with vigour. Practically starstruck, John repeated the name in his head until he was dizzy with it.
They were a mess of limbs muttering complete nonsense, all eagerly proclaiming that they couldn’t believe they’d done so well.
It's the day of the preliminary competition and it's time for The John Watson Band to prove that they deserve a chance to be in the movies. Even though they're armed with Sherlock's song and their collective music expertise, they can't help but feel nervous.
“No,” he had whispered to himself. “They were blue. Blue eyes with grey undertones, the common overcast sky bringing out the grey to resemble the heavens.”
Only when he collapsed did he release the letter, certain he couldn’t bear to imagine his fingers where his husband’s once were any longer. He allowed the letter to fall in sweeping patterns in the air, the thrilling journey taking too long as is floated to settle in front of him. Yet he wasn’t paying attention to its journey or landing place.
“You’re feeling alright?” John’s face as a mask of concern and it was more pity than he could bear to be directed toward him.
He flushed, mouth opening for a retaliation but his mind unable to scrape one together. She was correct, after all. “Yeah,” he finally said, shame overwhelming him. “I guess it is.”
Sherlock shook his head, eyes far away. “I would consult with Victor but… he didn’t fancy working the cases. He was always much more artistic than he was analytical.”
Sherlock squinted in the direction John was pointing, mouth twisting for a moment before declaring, “Cheating on his wife, wearing his wife’s makeup, and recently lost weight- probably because he started having affairs.”
And her hand was on top of his forearm, thumb stroking in slow, swirling motions. John looked quickly down at the contact, looking up bewildered to see her eyes wide and innocent.
The room at the very end of this corridor was the reason he came. He itched for the final room, yearned for it, craved it. Yet he caught sight of the second door on his left and his feet faltered in their assured motion. The moment he saw the door, he knew he was helpless to avoid the pull of temptation it posed.
“Of course. You see the way he looks at you, surely. I thought it was admiration but did you see the way he reacted when I leaned toward him and smiled?”
“Hey,” he called across the bar to a gentleman who was disproportionately bored regarding the stimulating environment around him. The bartender turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised in way of an answer and his hands continued to work at cleaning a crystal glass. “Is Al here?”
