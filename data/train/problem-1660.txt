-The anomaly of death.
He grits his teeth. "And so are you!" His grip tightens on me - his eyes now blazing wide. "Let me do this." He says, his voice sounding almost pleading. "You just get them... and yourself, to safety." His face tightens. "Okay?"
Guilt rushes me, and quickly I respond saying, "no. Its fine. Its...good."
I sigh, softly, leaning back against the bed's headboard, adjusting the Venturi mask on my face- "Am I?" a gentle smile takes my lips; this time it's genuine. "Hadn't noticed."
"John, it's my will."
And yet... I still can't accept it.
I straighten my posture. "John, sit." I wave towards the chair beside me. "There's something that I have to discuss with you."
John cocks his head, frowning falsely. "Since when?"
John's face tightens. "You're right." he says with a deadpan expression, "You're not dead yet." He steps in and shuts the door. I can already sense what's coming - the tension - the impending climax. "Sherlock..."
In a matter of moments my heart skips, my cheeks pale, and my face goes cold. I'm appalled. Inferior. Pitied.
He turns out the lights, leaving me to wrestle through my own restless thoughts. It's hopeless. He knows it.. I know it. Everyone knows it.
I frown and flare my nostrils. "Really?"
It gives me more time to see what I'll be missing... And who'll be missing me.
We breathe simultaneously, then John chuckles. "we keep doing that."
And it's only a matter of time... Before I'm gone.
I shudder. The pressure is too much.
His fingers softly press into my back. I shudder. Human contact. Its strange, but still I need it. "J-just don't."
Immediatly her face tightens, and her cheeks redden - she's blushing. Obviously. "N-no, Sherlock..." She sighs regretfully, "...I'm sorry."
John on the other hand doesn't seem to surprised. I'm guessing he expected the discussion to take a while.
I tease, "Do I?" Of course I do.
If I'm lucky-
John scoffs derisively. "Sufferable."
Oh your moments were a charity
"As will I." John interjects, shifting harshly in his seat to face me. I attempt to avoid his eyes, but it's basically impossible. "But, that doesn't mean I'll agree with you when your wrong." His lips set into a grim line. "They should know. I'd want to. They will too." His eyes grab mine, "It's only right Sherlock." His face tightens, "At least let them say goodbye."
"I'm sorry." I breathe, laying down my pride, just this once.. just because people like it. And John thinks it makes me seem more.. human, "What I meant to say was..." I feign a grin,"thank you."
Now I feel even more obligated to say it.
"Wonderful. Anything else?"
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
And we agreed that if I died, it would be on my own terms - that whatever I decided to do would be provided for; to ensure the utter most convenience.
"Ooo.. Now I'm excited." I conjure up a toothy grin.
"Neither are you!" I argue pleading, "you're just human."
"Sherlock." It's Donavon. And she appears to be holding something.
"But then you're also not implying that we won't." He adds, voice bitter and incredulous. "Look." He frowns. "I get it. Okay. You're bored. Ya miss the action. I have no problem with that. All I'm asking is that you take a bit easy while your out there."
We laugh, then sigh simultaneously.
-the madness.
They have words to say, yet there tongues are bolted down with pity. Now assuming John has already pre-instructed them on what to do and what not to, they'll most likely just remain quiet.. And go on as if nothing ever happened.
Night had fallen, and John had not yet returned. He left after our fight, and oddly enough... I was worried.
"Sher-Sherlock?" his lips dry at the sudden brush of mine- I had no time to register what I had just tried to do- the urge was simply too bloody compelling- "what're you doing?"
I should tell him. Tell him why I really took this case. But no. Now is too soon. Bloody hell, I'm gonna do it.
I spin around, then frown. "Problem?"
"A pity party." I snarl. "What's next, life on mars?" I give an unrelenting stare, pushing the gift back to her. "Look, I don't need your pity, Donavon." I snort. "Was me not inviting you to my party not obvious enough."
Its Mycorft- standing behind his weeping little brother- devasted but steeled for show. Unwavering in the face of sorrow. Mycorft, the man amongst goldfish. He's the only reason John's plug has not been pulled yet- because a certain someone begged him not to end this yet- that someone being Sherlock. But now...there's no other option. It has to end. It must. 'Sherlock, it's time."
Mental state impaired - thoughts fading...Â  so distant... so foreign. I'm shaking. Emotions
They gave me more than I could lose
The heart I've denied to acknowledge, is now failing me. And to be quite honest..
"W-wait... You're telling me, he's back?"
I adjust my oxygen mask onto my face, shifting in my bed a bit. "L-Lestrade...we've come to you because you... you're the only per-person ww-we felt w-we could trust..."
"John..." I roll my eyes, and sigh, before spiking my collar. It helps. "you're worried." I scoff lazily. "always like you to be, anyway. I'm guessing it's the doctor in you? Hmm? Or possibly even coping? Just wretched, isn't it?" John's face hardens, and his cheeks flush. And now I'm feeling the odd need to say sorry. But before I can he speaks.
Or has he..?
"No, Sh-Sherlock, you're going to listen to me."
"Yes! Why else would we be here?"
Me sweating, and shuddering - in constant pain - just like in the nights I'd lie alone - shooting up to forget my wretched existence.
His eyes swim with tears, and his hands begin to knead into my back gently - his chin buried against my shoulder. "You can't leave me."
And then we breathe simitanously, not moving, just holding. Waiting - I suppose for a word to break the piercing silence.
He flinches. "I know..." He breathes. "Just... Just rest and get better. Okay."
I suppose being greeted with those eyes every morning wouldn't be so horrible.
The shooter aims at me, then fires. I duck down. "Christ!"
However, I remain calm, despite the unnerving knot twisting in my stomach, and the ear gnawing sound of silence.
"It's alright. It's me." He takes my hand and gently squeezes it. I breathe faintly, fogging up the oxygen mask covering my lips. "Your alright."
The chronic cough - The Edema slowing my heart - the fluid gradually building in my body - the swelling - the wheezing,
"You...love me?" I repeat - confused. No one had ever 'actually' said those words to me before- well in such context. "Y-you love me?" I say again, this time a bit louder- I'm even more confused.
He gave a warm smile, before looking back out from the window. I'm oddly satisfied. "I'm guessing that took a lot of effort."
I halt, and my eyes squint. "Interesting." I smirk, bending down near it. "John!" I call, pulling out my pocket magnifier.
I smirk and spike my collar, before arching a sly brow. "Managing is all I do. Come! We've got a body to examine."
I grimace, then begin examining the shoe prints. "Size 12 feet, slim, but ... Tall." Something tells me these were not made by Mr Harbor. I need John's second opinion, but unfortunately, he's angry with me, so he won't come without incentive. I give a dramatic gasp. "Oh god! John! Living room! It's urgent!"
Once inside we took to our investigation; John searching through the bedroom, and I, the living room.
At least he's smiling at all. I can afford to smile more.. but unfortunately, I am not given much reason to. "Thank you, Molly. It's lovely."

I suppose the universe rather enjoys my suffering. Giving me more time...
Basic Summary- (Edited)
..out of everything I've regretted, I've never regretted meeting him. A study in pink, was it. Hmpf.. Or at least that's what he called it in his blog.

One grazes my shoulder. I grunt and fall the floor. "Jesus!".
"Insulting you, Anderson, would be'self mockery'."
He just told me he loves me, and all I could say was 'it' was 'good'
"I see my life being stolen - I see giving in - I see the pain, the drugs - your suffering... Taking my life will spare you the pain of watching this disease drain it from me."
There he goes again, panicking - rushing to the rescue. I know this may appear cruel, but his excessive effort to make my situation convenient, makes me irritable. I'm dying. Not stupid. I know when he's afraid. I always know.
John scoffs. "Really?"
As we talk John seems to become more distraught. His tremor has been acting up since yesterday.
There's no response from the sleeping soldier- no words to soothe the other's aching ears.
It's John. Of course it's him. It's always him. Why wouldn't it be? He never leaves my side.. even when I demand he do.
Under me I can feel the cold wet sheets, clinging to my back like a caustic disease- so fragile- so close- must every minute be so reminding
Lying down was a challenge - then again most things that took me no effort, now, takes everything -Â  even with John's help, it's a obstacle.
The thought of taking that final breath - of letting go, and becoming nothing more than lifeless bone and tissue.
"Oh, and I'm guessing tomorrow will be?! Hmm?"
A mirthless chuckle gushes from his lips. "Depends." He sits beside me, in the chair he usually occupies when keeping me company - elbows on his knees, and chin propped, heavily, on his knuckles - he flusters. "Unless you're looking to lock out your doctor?"
"Th-they're wrong.", Sherlock whines into the taller ginger's chest, and beats his fist into it as the harshness of this reality sinks into him like the teeth of lion- merciless and untamed. Sherlock is broken.
"I-I bought this, and I don't really like it, so..." she pauses, hesitating, "here." She practically crams it into my hand. "Now at least someone will get some use outta the bloody thing."
His face tightens, yet still he sits. He clears his throat. "So...?"
Sometimes I hate it. I hate how time reminds me - how death binds me into it's mercilessly hold - it's teeth sharper than its sickle.
Now left with only the broken sobs of my best friend, I become a panting mess - my lungs straining to regulate each breath. I gasp. "John..." I pant weakly, "pl-please..."
"J-john..." I grasp his jumper weakly, my eyes blurred and heavy, "y-your okay."
John sighs, heavily. "Yes. I love you, you idiot." He sits beside me, in a chair, next to my bed. I fluster red, and turn to face him. His hand takes mine. And I'm speechless. "Suffering with you is a privilege, Sherlock, I'm not ready to give up that up just yet."
December - three days away from Christmas. And I haven't been out of bed since I left the hospital.
"Shh...I've got you, don't worry."
His lifeline. The only thing he has left to hold onto- even if it's pointless to. He won't let go.
Meanwhile me and John listened and interjected when it seemed most appropriate.
And John... He's no better. I heard him crying twice, both on different occasions, and each time more of me died.
I'll never fully understand it...
Subtle hint. Indirect persuasion. he abhors my inability to be grateful - he wishes I'd care more - yet is secretly envious of my lack of emotion.
I see him standing in the morgue beside me, spurting out suggestions, I see him shouting from the top of his lungs, because he's stumbled upon another one of my severed heads, and then, just as clear as day, I see him standing at my grave, crying and pleading for one last miracle.
Gradually my melody becomes less muffled, and more piercing. My hands now moving faster than I can control. I'm angry. Furious!
I've never quite seen anything quite like them- molten blue, like sapphire oceans glowing underneath a golden-sunrise.
I flinch. "John.. calm down."
John shifts in his seat. "No-Sherlock..."
I frown. "Are you okay?"
I swallow, then flush completely red in humiliation. The machine crying. "M-my apologies every... everyone." I sniffle, and breathe in heavily, fogging up the the oxygen mask on my face. "I'm... I'm not ff-feeling all too well."
I wanna know that
John pretends to be surprised, turning up a brow, and gasping, "-That's shocking." he smirks, artlessly. "You notice everything."
"An indirect message? Lovely."
Gracelessy, stuffing our faces with white, butterless, popcorn, and making an absolute mess of ourselves and the couch - Mrs Hudson will have mess to clean up tomorrow.
Suddenly I feel John's head nodding, and his body beginning to tremble involuntarily. I comfort him with more care, despite how weird it feels.
Oh I know you found the promise land
However that's another story. As of now I am preparing to handle a bit of business with John. He steps into the room, and suddenly a pit forms in my stomach.
We arrive on the scene, my nystagmic eyes miss nothing - glancing from side to side - eyes sharp and narrowed.
"Sherlock..." he pauses, his voice seemingly deeper than usual, "this - tomorrow... It can't happen." his voice breaks. And I quiver. "it can't. It just... You just can't." his breath becomes heavier, almost as if he is about to cry, yet I don't look to him - I can't bring myself to. I just can't.
I am that fortunate machine. Rusted. Dysfunctional. Undeserving of all care, and affection, only to be still graced with it ultimately.
I breathe lazily - my expression now duller than the menu. "Um.. unfortunately..." I exclaim "no..!" I yank of my scarf, while giving a sly smirk. "This menu is lacking something?"
As I suspected. John's always so predictable.
He was unnervingly silent afterwards, seeming to be operating on emergency mode. His narvina. Comprised.
Of course. He's at war- in a silent battle. He's wounded. though no one but me knows it. His eyes lighten upon seeing me, and his smile becomes more genuine.
And Mycorft isn't quite sure if he'll be able to stitch him back together again...
John stands beside me, jaw clinched and eyes blazing wide. He thinks I'm angry with him. "And for god sakes! Anderson! Get acting lessons!"
At this moment I lose sense of reality. An error has occurred - the dysfunction follows.
Most fear death - I admire it. It's power. It's strength. Yes. It ruins your life, but not as much as worry does.
I knew I'd ruin everything- the thought of being wanted clouded my judgement- John isn't in love with me.
Jubilant cheers snatch me back to reality, Mrs Hudson giggling, birthday horns, and a cake held up to my face.
I can't help but chuckle. Does he actually hate playing board with me that much. "As I figured." I throw on my scarf, wrapping it around my neck ever so gracefully. "Chinese?"
"I don't think it. I know it."
Because it is. You're dying- stop falling in love!
"But...I've never...really been...all to sure...about it." His cheeks darken with blush. I told him to bring his coat, but he insisted he wasn't cold. Now he's catching a cold. He clears his throat. "Hah... I'm no detective."
He blinks owlishly, drawing down his brows. "Yes.. I'm listening?"
But I am surprised to find I am wrong - Her hand suddenly reaching out a small box to me. I marvel.
He is quick to leave the room- I breathe in weakly, and listen to the familiar silence-
I love him.
"I was supposed to protect you." that baritone voice whispers, a croaky in tone, and hoarse from crying- "I was supposed to save you, John Watson." those bright grey eyes open wide- pained and drained of all sign of fate. "And I failed you."
So we had one. And yes. It was just as unpleasant as I thought it would be. but still we managed.
That we are not immortal - that people come and people go, and that we should never take life for granted. Ever...
I swallow, now left with nothing but pitying stares, and scornful silence. I am disquieted.
My hands lift instinctively, shielding my face, as my eyes blink to clear my cloudy vision.
John's mouth hangs open. This is his first time actually ever seeing me cry. And his first instinct is to comfort me - his arms now cradling me, he whispers, "it's going to be alright..."
"You know me so well." Our eyes meet briefly, but quickly they stray. I owe him an apology. "Ahemm..." My cheeks warm. I'm nervous. "John... About earlier..." My lips twitch. "I-i..." These things are always a challenge for me. "You were right." I did it. It's out in the open. "I am ungrateful."
John's eyes soften, and his face tightens with worry. "C'mon." He secures my arm around his shoulder, and carries me towards the exit.
I've discovered with happiness comes the misfortune of caring.. how can I care for something of such mockery?
It's abstruse. Cryptic - yet beautiful - it reminds us that we're just human.
Just like that the room goes dead silent - everyone's eye, now on me. I can feel their stares. Deep. Pitiful. Faces. All directed towards me. I'm dismantled.
To be continued...
"Maybe I'm staring because I can't bear the fact of knowing you'll be one soon!"
"Will?"
But I'm still here and I'm missing you
I open my mouth, but before I can get the words out, John disrupts me. "You're welcome, Sherlock."
After exiting the lift, I and John headed up to the hotel room; where Mr Harbor was reported to had suffered his 'nasty' fall.
The detective turns instinctively to the unconscious soldier, and quickly bites back a sob- John looks so peaceful...almost as if he's no longer suffering.
John Watson. The doctor that never left the war. His John Watson, lying in a hospital bed, unconscious and dependent upon a machine for what most believe will be the rest of his life.
"John, I um..." I say, voice trailing off like a fading brain wave. He looks to me. I'm unnerved. "I.. um.. I just wanted to say..."
"Anderson."
This is going to be hard. I can already feel the knot in my stomach.
Mycroft stands his ground- straightening his posture and looking the brunette dead in the eyes. "Are perhaps you are too blinded with guilt to actually see that they aren't?'Sherlock remains silent- no comeback it seems. Simpy tears- cold colorless tears streaming from the pale brunette's sharp-cut cheekbones.
His words hit me quicker than my mind can register. My eyes wet with tears. But I hold them back. John is indeed a soldier - but a foolish one.

Stares cast onto me, jaws slacked, and eyes narrowed. Dear God. I swallow, her smile falling quicker then the words left my mouth.
My heart skips a beat, and I grab my chest, breathing in and out weakly. The situation - its too much. "J-John...please."
As of now sleep begins to creep over me, gradually drawing me away into unconsciousness. I attempt to fight it... But it's no use. I'm tired.
he strides over to me. "God. really Sherlock, can you not do that. Please?" He exclaims, stooping down beside me. He looks to where I am looking. "Seriously. Just what exactly are we looking at."
I smile. "As am I."
I hear a soft gasp. "Y-you want me to..?" Just then my eyes open, and I hand the bottle to him. He refuses, pushing them back to me. "No...Just no."
To be continued...
I roll my eyes. "Oh, John, just focus."
He gives me a wry smile. "I'll try." His shoulders straighten, "Now go!" He pulls away, and springs into action, firing at the armed shooter, round after round.
I awake to find my flatmate curled up beside me- he seems so at peace. Such a shame he will have to wake up to this.
"Oooo... John, you're on fire."
"Sherlock."
As I listen, a soft, appreciative sigh parts his lips as I lean deeper into him - ear now planted against his chest, I listen.
Each moment counted as a privilege - he embraces them all, never taking a second for granted.
I wake to the sight of bright white lights above me. They're almost blinding.
Cause perhaps the most beautiful things, are in fact the things that we can't understand.
"Sherlock?" A familiar voice says, shifting my focus to the door. It's him - John. Knew he'd be coming. "can I come in?"
I still remember the day we met. Me leaning over a lab table, experimenting on god knows what, and him subtlety walking into the picture.
Weeks passed, and my condition only grew worse. The dyspnea, during activities steadily increased.
Everyday I live it. No tears - no caring. I have to detach completely from emotion - I have to turn off my desire to live.. and become careless.
When the day comes
His brows scowl. "And your reason?"
With a delicate motion I take her gift. Smiling. Barely pulling myself together, it's a struggle.
Ah...The human error - heart against reason. I scoff with bitterness. "why? I'm dying. Its not like I can change that."
Words can not describe the pain that struck my heart when I heard those words. Not even the pain of my heart failing could compare to it. It was indescribable.
"I don't know. Is it?"
I whimper, heart beating so hard I can hear it. His grip tightens, and I whine in response. "Oh God." Tears fill my eyes, as the pain continues to intensefy. "I need...morphine-" a sob rips from my throat- I scream, "now, John..!" I can't bear to breathe- hurts too much- "AHhuuh!"
I set down my cup of tea. "Lestrade called, said he had something that might just be worth my time..."
He breathes, timidly, "More than necessary."
"Hmm.. " I smirk, but remain lying down. "Resting's boring, John." I shoot him a mirthless smile. "I'm not dead yet."
I smile, slyly. "It's either this, or crap telly."
He exclaims. "Okay. Okay."
I know I'm a hassle. I know he struggles - managing to take care of me, Rosie, bills, medical expenses - it's not easy. Never is.
Christmas - one of my least favorite holidays. But as of lately it's become all I can think about.
It grows silent, only for a brief few seconds, before everyone starts to resume their original behavior.
Meanwhile John and Lestrade song joyously to the music. I never knew a soldier could sing so wonderfully. And Lestrade wasn't too bad either.

"Yes."
And I'm ready... Ready to end this perilous journey. and tonight I will.
"John, there is no point in us both suffering."
To feel the cold, sharp, blades of death against my skin, and the hot, taut, burn of air gradually forsaken my body.
Love.. its such a capricious thing. One minute were in it, the next, were not. When has love ever spared us?
I breathe, but it's hitched- painful... It hurts. Well of course it does..
And suddenly I'm looking right at him, but he won't look up to me. Now he's the one avoiding eye contact.
And my brother he visited, but only when necessary. For instance, he dropped by once to discuss some legal matters with me.
I'm so foolish, letting emotions get the best of me. I have to keep fighting. I have to... before it's too late. I can't begin to care. I can't. Or else I won't be able to go through with what I have tonight. And that will be bad.
Sherlock believes he's forgotten the sound of the other's voice- the distinct tone of it, and the way it heightened at his name.
We hold for a little while longer, before John finally breaks the silence to whisper, "Don't be embarrassed, Sherlock, I've done it before too."
"N-no." I groan, forcing myself to sit up bed and lean against the headboard. "I...I want to ensure J-John is not held accountable... for any...anything that takes place on that night. I...I don't want him to... to be put at risk."
It's happening again. The feelings. I can't afford to have them now. I can't.
"Almost never is. The shoe prints. Do you see? They're position. The killer was here. He hid behind the curtain, waited for Mr Harbor to face the window, and then struck." "And judging from what Lestrade has told us, Mr Harbor was dead prior to his fall.
My heart freezes- no sound. No words to express what I am feeling. John's caught me off guard with those words.
He sighs, with a amused expression. "For some reason I feel you wanted me to say no."
He forks his fingers through his soft silvery blonde hair;Â  something he tends to do when he's nervous.
"Yes!" I snarl. "I'm surprised I've managed all this time without driving a knife through my skull." My lungs release a resentful chuckle. "Human tendencies..." my lips twist into a resentful sneer. "The salt on the wound. The worm in the fruit!"
"Hurry!" I shout, quickly leading the survivors towards the back exit. Although all of me just wants to turn back around and leave them. It may seem cruel, but... John is my best friend. I can't leave him. "Keep going without me!"
Now met with stares, and silence, my mind urges me to play something else; this time something I've composed.
And now my eyes gaze up to the ceiling, wondering - thinking about what things might've been like if I had never gotten sick.
He scoffs, following me closely, "is it?"
A machine amongst humans. Fortunate enough to find forgiveness, despite all that it has done, and will do.
Just then my body is lifted, and I'm suddenly back on my feet. I gasp weakly, and before I can even speak John's eyes peer into mine. "You bloody idiot." He says bitterly. "You still came back for me?"
I snicker, but faintly - cheeks slightly warmer than normal - I breathe, "yes. It's becoming a rather common occurrence, don't you think?"
He's a fighter, yet most all.. a friend. And to know he'll have to travel the rest of road alone, unsettles me. But it is, what it is. At least with one last case, I can teach him how to.
"This is the work of a hit man."
"I'm sure one Sherlock Holmes is more than enough for London. Hmm?"
I huff, and roll my eyes so hard it's a surprise they didn't detach from their sockets. "I know." "I was going to say it because...I love you."
"Let's do something."
Oh, I'm swimming in the grief
Human...
So with that being said, we begun to play a traditional Christmas melody.
It hurts - the pain is excruciating - sleeping is dreadful - eating makes me sick - right now I'm nauseous. It doesn't feel quite pleasant. But at least I didn't throw up again.
With that he turns, straightens his shoulders and strides out of the sitting room, leaving me to once again abhor my existence.
My forehead puckers. "Would you rather prefer another dreadful night of operation?"
The lack of appetite - The confusion, disorientation -Medication, beta - blockers, nitrates, diurectics, nothing seems to be taking effect anymore.
He blinks, nodding vigorously. "Oh, I see." He crosses his arms. "He's coming over?"
How John would've been, if this reality had not happened. But it did. And still, In spite of all of it, John still remains unwavering - forebearing my childish tantrums, because he understands what I'm going through.
"Well.. I'd like to think I have..."
I pull him closer, forcing them back into his hand again. "John, please."
He continues to hold me, his embrace becoming less firm, and more gentle. "shhh..." His fingers run soothing through my raven-brown curls, and I whimper in appreciation- "John?"
"Ah!"
He flusters. "Well... Yes.. yes I have." He chuckles, then bites his lip. He's nervous. "More than intended."
After leaving the hotel, I and John Immediately took a cab down to Bart's. Once we got there we headed inside.
"Molly..." my lips move, before I am even able to catch them, "Stop staring, you look like a corpse."
"Of course. It tells me you care." I give a confident smile. "Just don't too much. I need your brain as focused as possible. Seeing you'll be learning quite a lot today."
And then my brother joined in, taking a seat at the piano. He had practiced since he was a kid. He was good. Very good. Oh, did I mention he was a show off. Well he is.
I don't want any relief
John gasps, lowering his weapon. Even now he'd risk his life to save me. It's heroic.
I have to stop this. He's so stubborn. He won't listen. Why can't he just listen!
I'm dying...
I raise a hand. "John. Not now."
"Sherlock?" I hear behind me. Suddenly I'm speechless. "Are... Are you okay?"
I snort, then frown. "I don't know what appalls me the most; the fact that you actually thought I'd give up my work, or the fact that a thought actually crossed your mind at all?"
But even more breathless-
Or is it me? I'm not sure. Actually I'm not sure about anything anymore. It's like I'm just existing - everything is if and how now... nothing's will or is.Â  This isn't living. This is dying. And I don't like it.
I squeeze my eyes shut tight, trying desperately to hold back the tears forming in them, "John... Please understand. This is where we are. It is what it is."
But I can't help it.
... who would be?
Just then I look up to see none other than John standing over me. His eyes wide, blazing with emotion. Fear. Adrenaline. Disappointment. Never have I seen such fright in a soldiers eyes. Never.
It's always going to be like this - if I don't end it, I'll forever be a subject to the pain - to fear. I'm too worn to keep going.
I smile, then blow, before feeling lips press to my cheek. Molly's. Obviously. She holds out a gift to me.
And maybe that's not such a bad thing.
"Dinner?"
This nightmare.
Sherlock can't imagine this being their reality for the next however many years to come- he simply can not. It hurts too much. Too much. John deserves better...
"Wonderful." I roll my eyes, glancing away, wishing the party was over, instead of just beginning.
The vast files of data. In each folder I see him - memories stored in every crack and crevice of my palace walls. Endless. Vast. Unimaginable data.
...what I've become.
Lestrade cocks his head. "Well.. as of yesterday, a girl who had witnessed the fall claim the man was already dead before he hit the ground."
Is it because of the kiss?
As John, and I lie side by side, our skin closer than ever- warmth, and comfort between us- the sudden urge to lean forward, and kiss him possesses me.
And given my condition, I don't have very long, however.., it all seems like deja vu.
"I won't let go." the brunette whispers over a painful sob, then closes his galaxy-grey eyes that seem almost colorless. "I promise, John. I promise."
He drums his fingers on his knee, his expression tense and impassive . Wistful. Haunted.
John scoffs with mirthless smirk. "What do you mean, take over for you, Sherlock?"
John's quiet. Too quiet. He believes he's made a mistake, and that I'm angry with him. I glance at him - my stare fastidious and stern. He notices.
John Watson. The man that turned the machine.. Human.
Sherlock shouts, "and I presume death is better!?", back in defense, and spins that head of curls around to eye his stoic faced brother. "He's my priority, not yours-"
A red, stark, streak of humiliation stains my cheeks - I've wet myself. This isn't the first time - but it's the first time I've done it with someone else in the room. I can only imagine what John will-
Love is only a chemical - a hideous disease that strips us of reason - an incurable, Infectious, and self consuming creature incarnated into our DNA.
"I'm sorry."
My jawÂ  drops in shock. "T-two weeks?"
After Lestrade left, John and I jumped right onto the case. We exchanged theories, argued about the solar system; which of course had nothing to do with case, and even shared a few good laughs while we were at it. It was simply perfect. I cherished it.. and I believe.. he did too.
My eyes slam close - mind totally submerged in the moment. It's like I'm drowning.
Just as quick as my mouth open, it shut. As depressing as it may be, I can't bring myself to snatch away that tender smile from his face, by reminding him of how little time we have left. I hate having to... fff-feel.. but unfortunately.. I can't seem to help it.. when it comes to him. "Really, John. There's no need to thank."
Did you like it? Let me know in the comment section below! ^^
"Killer's?"
It was practically unbearable.
"Morning.", the soldier groans, half asleep beside me. I scoot closer, and suddenly his eyes open. I gulp. Heavens they're so beautiful-
I become dizzy. My heart. It huts. "J-john..." My vision blurs, and then I stumble. "John ..." I croak, gradually drifting from consciousness, however I refuse to let go. He may need me. "John..."
Keep it together. There is no time for sentiment. This is strictly business. And business only.
He's so peaceful when he sleeps, almost as if he's somehow detaching from reality, and gradually drifting away into a realm of calmness.
"So... See anything you'd like to try?"
"Sher..."
He steps out with me, and I'm Immediately blinded by light. Just then.. I black out.
The night fled like a silent whisper- John slept beside me, and I felt safe. For the time being. Then morning came.
And yes. It was strange - having such a life altering discussion with someone like my brother. But who else could I have went to..
"J-john.. really..." I say, attempting to sit in bed, but failing, "Jesus..." I sigh harshly, agitated by the discomforting pain growing in my chest, "J-john.. I d-don't nn-need it. I'm f-fine."
I snort resentfully, and totter away, dragging my oxygen tank behind me. I'm in pain. And I'm embarrassed. I had no control over what just happened.
"Is there any point in locking my door anymore?"
The next day was rather challenging. I couldn't breathe without an oxygen mask. And when I wanted to be alone, I kept getting visitors.
I blink. "Do what?"
As a result I became rather irritable - lashing out at Mrs Hudson for being too over protective, or insulting Molly for standing to close.
The blog that made me famous, and required me to be more human, and less machine.
Great. Now he's looking away, ignoring the obvious tension - It's thick. Heavy. Deeply embedded. I breathe. "John..." I say dully, before breathing out heavily, "problem?"
"He'll kill you!" I snarl. "He's a hit man. He's been trained to kill."
"Maybe he's right." Lestrade interjects surprisingly. I shoot him a grimacing look, and he breathes distressfully, "But it's not my place to say what is and what's not." My look softens, yet my eyes remain stoic. "This is ultimately your decision, Sherlock." Lestrade breathes, and places a hand to my shoulder, gently kneading it with reassurance. He's always been a loyal friend. "And despite how bad it may be, I wanna be there for you."
John exclaims, then fires at the shooter blindly. They're quick. Rapid. Precise. Such accuracy.
Meanwhile I dart from behind the table, and begin to gather up the people; some hiding, some dead, and some already escaped.
"Because I love you." John confesses, and immediately it goes silent. He means? "Always have. It just surprises me that I have to actually say it. Thought I made it obvious enough two years ago?!" His hands go up, "are was my grieving not enough?"
I hadn't planned on making it any further than my last birthday, but miraculously here I am.
I figured he could use something appetizing to relax his mind. It was either this, or operation. John chose the latter.
With those words we leave, and head outside. On my way out of Bart's I begun to think.Â  It's just...
However, I won't say he wishes to stop caring - no. He cherishes the opportunity to feel - to show me that even if I don't care, he will. He's practically my portable heart - ready to kick in at anytime necessary.
"Well, you will be soon." Lestrade reaches into his coat, then pulls out a folder. "Here." He tosses it to me. "James Thomas Harbor, 32, British agent, committed suicide yesterday. Hurled himself out of a hotels window."
I huff, dramatically. "Oh, John, paying attention is always necessary."
As he sails off I lean backwards, closing my eyes - now flat on my back. Observing. Thinking. Something that I won't be able to do for very long. Which is why I must teach John all I know.
Mycroft steps closer, and simply replies, "you're right.' he adds, rather suddenly, "as you're mine."
And now she's staring, packing on the pressure, making it even more difficult for my barbaric mind to register any type of human emotion.
"Hmm..." IÂ  hum weakly, closing my eyes to the sound of my heart monitor. It weren't long before I was fast asleep.
Ah! Anderson. He still looks.. somewhat functioning.
For god sakes! I was overwhelmed, but luckily Rosie was there to steal away some of the attention.
He comes after me. "Sherlock..." He exclaims. "please..." I fight the urge to turn back. I can not let sentiment win. "If not for me, for Rosie?" I freeze. John grabs me once more, and sniffles. I'm disquieted. "She deserves better." He sobs brokenly. It's tearing at me. Jesus. "You can give her that."
"Wh-what happened?" I croak, glancing around - my eyes vague and heavy. I'm in the hospital. I gasp faintly. "h-how long have I been here?"
"Good." Lestrade nods, giving me a timid smile. "You start at the crime scene." he stands up, straightening his coat. "Then once ya boys are done there, you can drop by morgue."
Thus comes the misfortune of being one. Sentiment. Love. Fear. All chemical defects.
"Well, Isn't it obvious?"
I'm guessing he's feeling the pressure too. But John even more.
A spark of excitement ignites inside me. This is just the case I need. It'll serve as a distraction, and as an opportunity for learning. "Well.. clearly there's more to the case..." I cast a sly smirk, "or else you wouldn't have contacted me."
John snorts. "Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to give up so bloody damn quickly either."
Sherlock's eyes narrow, that brown dirty hair lying lazily in that long pale angular face. "What is that supposed to mean?"
And for once in Mycorft's life he sees terror in those teary grey eyes of Sherlock's, and wonders if ever he had quite seen them so void before. Not in a lifetime, he knows it. "Oh, brother."
I've spent years trying to divorce myself from feeling- striving to bury away whatever traces of human emotions I could find, only to now find my body betraying me.
John growls, stooping beside me. "Can you please! keep cover?"
He had to let everyone know he could play an instrument too. Just like when we were kids, he'd always have to prove he was the smart one. Hmpf... Brothers.
John exclaims. "No point!" He shouts, "for God sakes, Sherlock! Will you listen to yourself!"
My eyes narrow. "Well... Very well. John." I unclasp my arms from behind me, and face him. "I mean, you missed a few things of importance. But overall, very well."
It's artificial. Quick. Efficient. Just like my deductions. Some call it magic - I call it a profession.
"No.. it isn't. It's called being grateful, Sherlock. Maybe you can learn to be sometimes. Hmm?"
His words were sharp. They hit, and stuck. John is right. I am ungrateful.. but I can't help it.
And the fire is out
I shudder, then breathe- my brain refuses to process this extraordinary experience.
"No." Sherlock won't hear it. "He's breathing, and alive that means he's not dead." the brunette insists, desperate to convince himself that he, himself, is right, when truly he knows he is not.
He shakes his head. "No..." He croaks, "no Its not. You know it's not." His hold tightens more. God. Now the pain is excruciating. I want to comfort him but it hurts too much.
My breathing has slightly gotten worse, but fortunately I am still able to manage without the oxygen mask. I hate having to wear it.
I am triggered. "John..." I sneer, "I don't want to talk about it."
Our eyes meet. The tension is heavy. "Sher-Sherlock, I.. I don't need any of your things."
This may seem crazy, but I want to die knowing I wanted to. I want to be aware til the end of it. I want to feel something.
John Immediately becomes rattled. For some reason I already know whats coming.
Lestrade eyes snap back to life. "Yeah." He reaches a hand to me, and I shake it. "Take care, Sherlock."
John's lips purse, and his nostrils flare. "Yeah. Okay. But what about your mother and father?" His hand trembles, but he is quick to hide it in his lap. "How will they take it?"
"Sherlock."
I assume he wants me to back out too. But unfortunately, I am not able to.
I turn to see John standing at my bedroom door. I attempt to straighten my posture, but unfortunately I'm too weak. "John... You've returned."
The man who now occupies a part of my heart that can never die. Even if this illness is to take it.
John interrupts me, his hands ceasing my cold, but rapidly warming cheeks- short rough fingers smoothing over soft, pale pasty skin, as our bodies meet in a new found passion-
"Is it that obvious?"
He snorts, and gives me a broken smile. "That's just the point, isn't it?" He sniffs, and squeezes my hand, "I know you... But I can never replace you."
It's foreign. Equivocate. The walls I've so gracefully built, are now falling. Its humiliating, yet oddly.. Beautiful.
He nods gently. "Yes. Every night..." He sighs gratefully, "before I met you."
He flusters with hearty smirk - his eyes on mine. I smile. "Like you could ever manage to."
I gasp slightly, then groan. The pain in my chest is uncomfortable. "God."
I scoff. "With enough practice, you can be?"
"Good. What else?"
I adjust my coat, then sigh. "Yes. The Golem's." John listens earnestly. "This is his work. You remember the security guard? Alex Woodbridge?"
My eyes fall to him. "J...just as I...I'd have th-them." I breathe weakly. "I won't hh..have them trying to... to stop me..." I mutter from behind the oxygen mask. "C-cause I just may... consider it."
He shudders. "Why me?"
Immediately he straightens his posture. Now tall and erected - steeled for whatever may come. He's ready. "I'll get the door."
I sigh. "Come on." We step into the room. Now inside I glance around. Ah, Molly. This should be lovely. "Oh, Molly. Good evening."
However, Mycroft, and even Sherlock, despite how much he tries to deny it, knows that is not the case. "He's suffering.' Mycorft exclaims, his voice barely cracking as it raises- "it's been five years, Sherlock, this is no life for a soldier."
John clears his throat. "Uhm..." He hums a dull tone, then nods. "Okay." He hands me back my will. "I'm sorry."
John immediately responds, shaking his head, and saying, "no its fine. really." he looks directly into my eyes-blue, deep orbs boring into my mine. I am arrested. "it's... alright."
Words fail me- my lips part but nothing comes. I swallow. "J-John... When this is over..." I breathe, chest rising slowly, then falling, "I want you to take over for me."
Lestrade seems unsettled by the subject, but it's the way that it is, and it's better to accept it, than to keep living in denial.
John inhales deeply, fishing into his pocket to retrieve a little bottle of morphine - he uncaps it and brings it, fretfully, to my lips, still holding me, almost as if he's afraid to let go.
He scoffs. "Oh, yea. Do ya?"
But nothing - silence lingers, with all to be heard is the faint wheezing of my fragile lungs, and the wailing cries of the blizzard outside.
I jolt awake, hands gripping me, forcing me backwards, til I'm lying on my back.
Until I hear faint whimpers coming from the kitchen; they are John's- he's crying. I can feel my heart twist. Why is he hiding- I've seen him cry before: what's different now?
Then again...
"Does anyone else, besides me, know?" Lestrade asks with a tense expression.
"So you think it's an homicide?" John inserts rather spontaneously.
Now closing my eyes I begin to wonder... do I really want to give up the fight? I mean... If I take the pill, it won't be much of a struggle. It'll be too easy.
I flush even redder, my cold pale skin warming rapidly at the closeness of the soldier - I'm not use to such acts of affection.
Quickly, he administers some morphine to me. I drink greedily, only stopping when John pulls the bottle away.
She gives a lackluster smile. As I figured. she's still upset. "Hello, John." She ignores me.
"Something?"
He nods vaguely. "Okay..." His eyes dilate. Obvious signs of interest. He forgives me. "Now can we please eat?" He chuckles awkwardly. "I'm starving."
I swallow. "Oh...well..." My lips birth a tender smile, "Don't be."
"Shoe prints." I reply, glancing over the shoe prints one last time. My lips twist into a menacing smile. "The killer's shoe prints."
He reaches out, and pulls open the door. "Definitely." He freezes, and blinks. "And.. aren't you forgetting something? Hmm?" He points his head towards a droopy Molly.
"John, all that concerns me is how to make this less painful...for you."
I'm afraid.
Everyone goes into an immediate panic. I nod. "That did the trick."
"More than I feel comfortable admitting. Haha."
John Huff's. "Can you please not do that?"
My eyes suddenly slam shut, and tears begin to pour. I hold closer. "I-I'm not s-sure I have a choice."
My eyes fling open to Lestrade waltzing towards me, and John standing beside him displaying a timid smirk. "How's the world's famous detective?"
I hated it. I even told Anderson to take his pet else were.. but the others felt it wasn't right to make Anderson's 'friend' stand outside.
"John I.. I just wanted to thank you." My cheeks fluster with warmness. I can't do it. I clear my throat, now looking out from the window. I've got to focus. Caring is not an advantage. "I know... Probably not the best 'thank you' you've ever gotten; but.. still, nonetheless, an honest one."
John huff's. "Then that makes two of us." He cocks his gun. "Go. Please..."
John's face tightens. He's definitely tensed. I suppose he's stunned, or perhaps, just Increduled.
His eyes widened. "Noooo." He forces a smile, barging past me. "Dinners perfect."
I laugh involuntarily, then take it, before examining it closely. "Is it morphine?"
Seeming careless may seem cruel, but ultimately it will spare me, as well him, the trouble of not being.
During the gift exchange Molly couldn't help but cry; perhaps seeing me dependant upon a machine to breathe, wasn't something she wanted to see. Though despite all of this, she did her best to hold herself together.
I smile weakly. "Since always."
Soon everyone settled down and I and my brother decided it would be nice to have a little music.
I scoff, sheepishly. "No need to exaggerate the truth."
Time passed so fast - one moment we were eating and laughing, quietly, trying not to wake little Rosie, and, the next moment, we were covered in popcorn, huddled up, and stuffed and passed out on the den's couch - sleeping to the not so calming sounds of the telly running near us.
"Obviously." I scoff, then give a mirthless laugh. "Mr Harbor was murdered."
His grip tightens on me. "Sherlock!" He snarls, "would you please stop this!" He exclaims "Please!"
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
Hi again! Know it's been a while but I've been really, reeeaaally busy; which by the way, I apologize for- I've just finished this amazing piece to my amazing story, and I just hope you all like it. I worked really hard on It. :)
He begins to read it. His expression hardens. I'm assuming he is not very pleased with what he is reading.
"Sherlock.. It's okay.."
"Sherlock, the doctors have proven that he is."
John scoffs. "Are you serious?" "I've thrown myself in front of bombs for you."
"Perhaps you're right, John." I feign a smile, making sure he doesn't notice that I am deducing him.
December 25th - Christmas day - a time meant for celebration, and instead here I am, discussing how I want to die with my best friend.
I close my eyes, exhausted from the morphine dosage John gave me not to long ago. "G-good." I manage to open my eyes a little, just enough to see John's eyes glaring dead at me. I groan tiredly. "As long as John... is safe." I nod off, but quickly come back to. "Uhm... Do excuse mm-me." I clear my throat weakly, "er... the mm-medicine.. makes mm-me dr-drowsy."
"J-john! I said enough!"
"Morning." I breathe weakly into the oxygen mask- a lackluster smile gently tugging at the corners of my lips, as I run a soft hand over the sleeping soldier's slowly, "John..."
Enjoy!
This...
"That?" He points to me. "You know.. popping your collar with your cheekbones, so you'll look all cool and mysterious."
John wags his head, chuckling. "God. You're a case. You know that."
____________________________________________
We chuckle for a bit, but don't bother facing each other.
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
"I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you, take me back to the night we met, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you, take me back to the night we met"
John smiles sarcastically. "Thrilled."
"Er... he didn't come in through the door?"
The cab stops. "Speaking of cases. Where here!" I pounce out of the cab, before it barely even stops moving. "John, hurry!" I fish into my pocket, I'm short of change, so I pay the cabbie more what I have. I spike my collar, swaggering off towards the crime scene. "Come, John. The game is afoot."
Then it goes quiet.
"Be reasonable, Sherlock, the doctors have ran numerous tests, done brain scans, examinations-" Mycorft shakes his head for affect, "and each time, each test came back with the same result, negative."
Suddenly her eyes widen. She's guilty. Worried. So like her - desperately trying to hide behind a smile. However, it's betraying.
I gasp in slight panic, reluctant but desperate, sinking into his hold despite how humiliated I am - I'm in pain and I need him.
C'mon! You're a machine. Pull it together! Tell him!
John doesn't look at me - obviously he's angry. He feels I'm being selfish. Cause he doesn't understand.
I gave you my everything
The only one I had intended on seeing during this period was John. No one else. But still people came to visit.
I breathe heavily, reaching out my will to him. "The terms are simple." He swallows, and takes it.
He glares back at me, deliberately ignoring my wishes and upping my morphine dosage anyway. I grumble weakly, relieved, sinking further into bed. "God..." I swallow. "Doesn't it get boring?"
My lips release a long sigh. "it's locked-"
He holds me closer, and continues towards the exit. "I know..." He whispers, "it's going to be okay. I've got you. Don't worry. Just listen to my voice. Okay."
I give a cocky wink, and a confident smile. "I'll try."
Though my heart may be in pieces
I don't want to feel it - to know that it is closer than I've cared to acknowledge, to know that tomorrow I will die.
He nods, frowning. "Yes. And you should." My eyes narrow. "She's really upset, Sherlock. I don't like seeing her like that." He looks directly at me. "Please. For me?"
"it seems like a challenge to me." John inserts yet again. He's eager. A little too eager. "But, than again, I'm not him..so.."
And before I know my bow is lifted to the strings, and gently it begins to move against them.
"Aw, just open the bloody gift, already!" Lestrade presses me, laughing, wrapping an arm around Molly's shoulder. "Trust me.. you're gonna love it."
John takes it, however he is a bit reluctant. "Oh, Okay." He pauses. "Em... what exactly am to do with this?"
I lean in towards him - my lips slowly birthing a cocky smirk. "But..?"
John exclaims, "God, Sherlock!", and holds me closer. I sob, harder. Miserable. Small. Afraid. "J-John, it-it hurts, s-so much- Ahh!"
He laughed slightly shaking his head, before following me out of the hotel room and down to the lift. We got in, and headed back down.
The heart and the brain. Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson - we were on. Case after case. Lost in the moment.. Foolish enough to do anything.
"John." I rise to my feet. "Unless you have a fresh heart in that hand of yours, I will be needing it." I adjust my robe. "more sooner than expected it seems.
And there's no anchor that could hold me down
It's so quick. It's like a movie - black and white. No color.
He carefully unwraps his arms from round me- I shiver at the loss of body heat, that feels more like deprival, than anything else.
Hands calm me. "Whoa.. Take it easy, Spock."
My heart twists inside me. I steel before sentiment takes control. "J-John, ...your sub...subtle attempt to...change my m-mind... is rather disappointing..." I look back to a tensed Lestrade. Clearly he's just as worried as John, but is trying not to show it. "They'll... They'll know wh-when it's done."
Files everywhere, all over, the beds practically covered in them. And john sits quietly beside me, helping me sort through them all.
In here everything is clear - precise. Crisp - a vacation from the chaos
It's like a storm- never ending, and unstoppable- A never ending loop of misery, tears, and agony.
The room goes silent. Molly's now anxious. She knows her mistake.. but is slow to correct it.
Sentiment...
John sighs heavily, retaking his seat beside me. "Yes. Sherlock... the night after the shooting, you suffered a heart attack, and as a result the doctors placed you into a medical induced coma." His voice cracks, but he is quick to mend it. "It saved you." I hear what almost seems to be a sniffle. He's been crying...
"Acting Lessons!?" Anderson Squawks.
The smile on there faces. It was nice to see the two happy. Molly deserved it. She always did. But unfortunately... It took me becoming sick to finally see that.
Initially I had planned to play a new Christmas CD that John had purposely bought for the occasion. But everyone kept insisting I play violin.
I look to him, but it's hard to see. "The... others?"
So John let her in, against my will, and we resumed the party. I was showered with gift after gift- cards and hugs and kisses, and so much was happening I could barely think.
John's eyes become stoic - piercing mine. He's afraid. Yet.. he's determined to hide it. "You've been here for two weeks."
He nods. "Yes. The others. Like your mother, your father, your brother..."
My eyes roll instinctively. "the excessive effort you put into making this..." I gesture to my words, "convenient."
I part my lips, readying to explain my true intentions for taking the case, but a sudden knock disrupts me. I blink, feeling rather guilty. "Would you mind?"
Time to test his observation skills. I must know how sharp his mind is - see if he's been listening and observing my method's correctly.
Which should be an easy task - judging by my past, I've practically built up a tolerance for it.
"Sherlock..." He pulls me close, then looks right up at me. "stop treating this situation as if it's just another one of your cases... cause it's not!" He shakes me gently, and sniffles. "This is real! And it's scary!" He sobs - his eyes practically pleading with mine. "Let me help you." His eyes weakens, "p-please."
More time to care and to feel. I'm left with less time to complain - forced to finding meaning - to be happy.
And I'm more than sure John will too - he's practically invited everybody. And I do mean everybody. Even my brother.
"Then maybe the doctors are wrong!" Sherlock exclaims furiously- lunging from where he sat and right into Mycorft's face.
My foot taps a staccato rhythm beneath me. Thoughts inexpressible. Pent-up. Repressed. I'm withdrawn.
John comes barging into the room, his breath a bit hitched. "Sher.. Sherlock? what's happened?"
But I think the worst part of it all, is that John has no other choice but to experience it with me.
A single tear cascades from a ghostly white angular face- it splashes against the plain white bedsheets below and soaks into it slowly leaving a damp darkness behind.
"No, I mean, for more than medical purposes? Like for evidence?"
Yes. It's dreadful - unlike anything I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.
Sherlock shoulders away his brother's hand, furious look upon those worn features. He's afraid- conflicted. Mycorft understands. "No!" says the poor man, shaking that head of curly black locks, and sobbing, "not yet- I-I've changed my mind. I'm not ready yet. I need more time."
I am wordless.
"What do you make of it?"
John's face instantly goes red, his cheeks warming like blossoming flowers in the carnelian yellow sun. He breathes. "Oh..." He chuckles with a tense smile- "Okay..." we smile together. It's sort of uncomfortable, but the feelings, from what I deduce, are mutual. "I love you too."
John chuckles, removing his hand from my shoulder. "Rest." He gives a lackluster smile. "I'll be here if you need me."
"Of course." I clasp my arms neatly behind me, and begin pacing the polished floor beneath me. "Now, John. Your turn."
As a result, I was left home. Now alone, I stand, back erected, violin to my chin, and bow lifted - ready to begin.
And though I can't keep it together
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
I nod weakly. "O-okay." My arm instinctively attempts to tighten around him, but it's no use. I'm too weak. "I'm.. s-so weak, John."
I swallow the knot in my throat. "Um, John.. it wasn't selfish.." I release a tremulous breath, "actually it's fine."
Nonetheless, nothing I do, or any one for that matter, wil make any difference. I'll still be here - sick. Weak. Dying.
Nonsense. I have to say it. "No. I should say it." God. I am not good with this. "I mean, I want to...say it."
I nod, but with great reluctance. "O-okay." I catch his arm, just as he turns, causing his eyes to fall back to mine. "Don't die."
"Hmm..." I hum lazily, "there's something on your mind."
I shift suddenly. "No..." my lips quiver, as I inhale deeply. "You did it. John, if you had not been there..." I swallow, "I would've died." I inhale sharply, then breathe. "Thank you."
I know I've messed up. The bleeding silence, the expression locked in her eyes. She's going to make me eat my words, I can feel it.
I stop - my feet now as still as the floor beneath me. He wants me to apology. I'm Incredulous. "You want me to apologise?"
He nods. "Yeah." His feet shuffle anxiously, "Kinda."
I know. But John was determined to make my Christmas as festive as possible. Although I wasn't upset, cause I didn't believe he'd show up.
I give a faint scoff. "Oh, now we both know that won't be possible." My head tilts, and my nose crinkles, "But I guess it never hurts to try, hmm?"
"Same exact cause of death... Strangulation. However, The Golem is not one to linger. I'm sure by now he's moved on. There's nothing more that can be done here. Molly, make sure Lestrade is alerted about this!"
"You're not invincible!"
John is instantly repelled, "No!"
SAVE JOHN WATSON
He's lying. I can tell. I can always tell. I unbutton my coat. "I'm hoping that was rhetorical."
"Want to know what I see, john?" My eyes suddenly shut - there's a pain in my chest, but I ignore it.
"What does that even mean?"
"Uh.. so.. your birthday is coming up soon." He whisks up a smile, "Anything in particular that you'd like to do for it?"
Molly expels a refreshing breath, before Lestrade comes popping up from behind her, reaching out a gift. "Happy birthday, you idiot."
At the moment, time froze, and all I could see was John in front of me. The look in his eyes - the soldier - ready for battle. He steels and time rushes me. "Everyone under your tables!" He jolts out of his seat, flipping the table and pulling his pistol. "Someone's going to die!"
And if it wasn't for John I don't know where I'd be right now. Don't think I'd be conscious.
"Pff.. he never left. Also, tell Lestrade to text me."
They don't move. John fires."Under your tables! Now!"
He is upset? Obviously, and will most likely pretend to not be, like usual...
her sweaty fingers gently grazing mine upon the exchange. They're sweaty. Obvious signs of nervousness. She worried. Hmm.. They all are. Human sentiment at it's finest.
You bloody fool! Now you've lost the opportunity- the moment was just right, and you go and ruin it. So much for being clever.
"However, that doesn't matter, as of now, all that does is the case." My eyes narrow just a bit. "though I'm not implying we'll take it."
"You're up early." That smile. It's contagious.
As we proceed towards the morgue, I become slightly reluctant - my feet halting at the door. I'm disquieted.
John waves, although it lacks effort. "Hi, molly." Clearly this won't be pleasant. "So the body?"
He pants desperately, "Sher-sherlock, you s-saved me." His nails dig slightly dig into my flustered skin. "Let me return the favor."
Molly points. "It's over there." She stands straighter - clearly she's uncomfortable.Â "It's already been prepped for inspection."
She storms out, sobbing, leaving me to swallow my own words. They're bitter.. and cold.
"J-john..." I breathe, though it hurts, "I'mm.. ff-fine."
I pant for air, breath catching in my constricting throat- it sort of hurts. I groan in distress, and bury my face in the shorter man's chest. It doesn't help much.
He blinks, and scoffs, playing dumb. "Well.. it depends on what you're referring to."
He uncovers his face, then looks up at me. "Dead?" He nods. "Yes." He leans back, and folds his arms over his chest. "And the case is closed." He gives a mirthless laugh. "So it seems you've done it again."
He snarls. "Wait.. did you just insult me?"
He truly does...but unfortunately Sherlock is still too afraid to let go. He feels guilty. Guilty for not being there sooner- If he had been clean, and more observant perhaps Eurus would've never slipped under his nose- John wouldn't have gotten caught in the crosshairs of an old sibling rivalry, and would've never been shot. Sherlock feels completely hopeless. Like a failure.
A prison, but also a vast ocean of pain, and war- a battle for survival- that has somehow led me here.
John Watson is not just a reason for me to live, but a reason for me to breathe. Breathing is not boring.. Not having a reason to is.
(Intro)
John leans towards me, his elbow resting on the armrest of his chair. "Don't you think they'll at least want to say goodbye?" He asserts, side eying Lestrade, who sits in front of us nodding.
Even if it's pain. I want to feel it. I want to feel it all.
He refuses to discuss anything involving my death, and hates for me to even bring it up. Then again, he's never really liked to talk about it.
He doesn't like it when I do.
To be continued...
During my sweep of the area, I am caught away by a peculiar sighting; shoe prints, on the floor, starting at the window nearest to me, and ending at the window that Mr Harbor had mysteriously tumbled out of.
"Well... in these types of cases there is hardly ever any investigations. Most would simply close it as a suicide."
Morning rears its face - sun now basking through the Windows. I'm sitting in bed, tray beside me, cup of freshly brewed steaming tea. For once I'm comfortable.
Probably even angry. I don't know - he didn't freakout about it, and even now he's ignoring the scent of urine that's soaked into the couch and my pajamas.
I sob harder, and my arms wrap around him tighter, even though it hurts. I don't let go. "B-but will you do it?" I croak. "Will you save me one last time, J-John?"
She glances at me. "Y-yes?" It's more than obvious she wants an apology. Well, here goes nothing.
It was warming and merry. Mrs Hudson started crying, and with her everyone else.
"A hit man?" John exclaims.
"We're here because there is still hope!-" the brunette refuses to listen- being stubborn as usual. "I know there is. I know it."
I know that you'd want me to
"Mm.. g-god."
But I ignore it, and continue on with the discussion. I can't let sentiment hinder this any longer.
I nod, and inhale weakly, cherishing such intimacy. It's quite alarming how much I've been starving for physical contact.
"John, n-now is not the time for th-this. "
Suddenly his eyes widen. He's noticed his mistake. "Sherlock... I-i didn't... I didn't mean it like that." He stammers, and fidgets. "Uhm.. wh-what I meant exactly... What I meant to say, Sherlock... was..." He inhales nervously, "you don't need it"
Here it comes.
John breathes "Exactly my point."
"M-molly." I breathe sharply, "I'm sorry."
Feelings are not an option now. They're only going to make leaving harder. I must detach, before it gets more complicated.
To be continued...
My nose crinkles. "Uhh.. No."
I scoff. "Definitely not wearing the hat."
Yet in comparison, I lack in all - a mere brain and appendix. I have to process and let go. Deliver
I shift. "Oh, there you are." I arch a sly brow, reaching out my pocket magnifier to him. He has to learn my techniques, if he's ever to take my place when I am gone. "I need a second opinion!"
It plays faster and faster, and all I can see is him - John Watson.
My brows draw together. "My... Mycroft knows, ...an...and hhe's m-more than willing... to... to assure it's... s-success."
I stagger, but force myself to continue. I have to know he's okay. I have to. "John!"
Lestrade scoffs, breaking the handshake. "yeah. You'd better." He chuckles, before finally leaving.
I have to apologize. Now. "John," I breath in deeply, yet weakly, "I'm sorry."
I sigh weakly "I mean, my work- I want you to take my place." John seems against it, but I continue anyway, "You're the only one that's truly observed my techniques- you know me more than anyone else, John."
"Precisely! So that means?"
"Perhaps saying sorry would be a good start? Hmm?"
I frown, bitter and prideful, "caring is not an advantage, John."
"What?"
"You've noticed."
"We keep doing that."
Tears wet my shirt - yet I don't mind it. "No it's not... It's not okay. I was wrong?" His voice cracks harshly, "I should've never asked you something like that!" His fingers dig into my shirt, "It was selfish. For that, I am sorry."
I push pass him, swaggering through, John accompanying me, as we advance further into the crime scene. We stop.
I turn around, and return back the way I came - heart dangerously racing, and veins rapidly pumping with adrenaline.
He smiles and glances up at me, "Um.. not yet." He chuckles slightly, before returning to studying the menu. "How bout you?"
There's a hand- quite familiar- pale thin and veiny, reaching out to take another- and squeezing. Tight. Its a lifeline.
"Anderson, don't try to figure it out. You'll only confuse yourself more."
____________________________________________
With silhouettes now being my only audience, I play, breath heavy with a slight hitch.
I can't listen to this- I know I don't have to! I want to!
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery. With no other treatment available, Sherlock is forced to accept his fate, and brave through it by the hand of his only friend, John Watson. Together they find hope in hopelessness, and light in the darkness, in this heartfelt - heart wrenching fanfic
I manage to exclaim. "John!" My lungs wheeze slightly, but still I continue, "I will not... h-have your...your freedom p-put at stake."
John nods vigorously. "Uhm.. yes!" He exclaims. "There's a murderous killer out on the streets, and we're just gonna have dinner?"
I groan weakly, trying to make out the figure hovering above me. But unfortunately it's too hard.
My eyes suddenly open. "You mean exactly?" I play dumb, only to by time to actually figure out how I am going to convince him that he can.
On the way I become even more faint - my body seeming to slowly become weaker and heavier. I gasp. "J-john..."
John nods. "I know...shhh..." He shushes me quietly, now only inches away from the exit. He pauses. "Okay, here we go."
And before I know it my lips are pressed against his- warm, wet, and puckered. Our eyes open slowly, having closed instinctively with the locking of our lips.
Suddenly arms embrace me. "I'm sorry. Okay. I'm so sorry."
The firey golden sun now seeping through the diamond-white translucent curtains curtaining my bedroom window-
"That's what it looks like." Lestrade gives me a wide feigned smile. "Wanna give it a shoot?"
"Sherlock?" John pants in fear, quickly adjusting the venturi mask back onto my pale-blue face. Though it does little to ease the pain. "Oh God, Sherlock, you can't do that!" He scolds. "You can't just remove your oxygen mask like that, Sherlock."
"Learning?"
Before we knew it we had played ten Christmas songs; which I absolutely dreaded.
My eyes suddenly go dead, and I am met with the stoic eyes of the soldier. I yelled at him. And now i feel guilty.
He grabs my arm again, and gives me a gentle yank. "Not as much as it killed me when you died..." His voice cracks, yet he forces himself to continue, "wh-when I thought you died."
Cause I don't wanna let you go right now
"Still awake?" I hear a familiar voice ask. John. He can't help but worry about me. "You hate to rest, don't you?"
"It's the hit man. I know it." John snarls. "Now maybe you'll think twice before going out for dinner while a crazy contract killer is out on the loose. Hmm?!"
We chuckle, simultaneously, before finally going quiet. This seems too good to be true-
He becomes diffident- his once sunny-blue eyes, now darkened with insecurity. "Oh, sorry. Too soon?"
Patient. Calm. Strong . Even when most opportune not to.
He forces a smile, but it's wry. "Yea. Sure. Sounds good." He looks out from the cab, through the window; I presume to avoid being deduced.
It's rather foreign to me. Strange. Byzantine - yet it comforts me, so I allow him to hold me tighter.
"Dinner."
The melody, I can feel it. Thick. Harsh. Blanketed. Sounds of bow against string. I'm panicking.
I groan faintly, finally free of the pain for the time being- I cry, not in pain, but relief; the pain I felt a few seconds ago was worse than anything I have ever physically felt before.
Each note rushes me with memories. They're so vivid. Its almost like I'm traveling through the past.
Two years has passed, Sherlock has return to 221B, he's made amends with his best friend, he's even started up his work again, but in the dark there lies a secret; his heart is failing and it's too weak to undergo any type of surgery.

With trembling lips I drink from the bottle - I shut my eyes, allowing the morphine to numb the pain. Then I curl up closer to the soldier - I'm fairly surprised that he returns the affection and buries his chin on my shoulder.
"I... Tomorrow... I'm not sure if... I'm not sure if I can go through with this."
"So.. it wasn't a suicide?"
Our eyes meet and suddenly we burst out into a bitter chuckle. We breathe, and sigh simultaneously. John is quick to notice, and give a comment.
He breathes. "Obviously. Murder."
John simply nods, and follows.
And now he sits in front of me - eyes sieving through the menu attentively. He's rather quiet. I have to break the silence.
"John, tomorrow, after the Christmas party." I close my eyes again. "I need you to end this." I blindly fish into my pocket, and pull out a little bottle containing a small pill. "I'm sick of the pain, John. I just want to be rid of it."
"I am fairly sure you are my dope peddler." I smirk, smugly, yet it can not hide the uncertainty in my grey-stoic eyes. "How was the party?"
Its crazy how one can spend nearly their entire life alone, but when they finally get a taste of not being, they will do anything to never ever have to be again.
It involved my situation, and how I would like to end it. However, it was initially my brother who felt a discussion would be needed. I didn't think one would be necessary. It was my decision. But because it would make my brother feel.. 'better' I agreed to have one.
Immediatly my eyes narrow. I'm offended. "I see." I say, voice slightly muffled by the oxygen mask helping me breathe. I inhale deeply. "Very well, then, it's no problem. I'll readjust it, and see to it that the things that are left are disposed of." I snort, and sneer. "Are perhaps you'll make sure of that."
I am overwhelmed with emotion-
Lestrade spends the next two hours highlighting a few topics; such as legal affairs, my will, and the situation.
Every second is another second I lose. I'm dying. And eventually I'll be lying in a coffin.. hmm..
"Uh..." he blinks, then briefly glances into my eyes, before looking back to the body. "Well... ahhem... he clearly was strangled. His hyoid is fractured, which is quite common in victims of strangulation." Look at him. He's doing wonderful. "I'm guessing the killer used his hands... Which seemed to be quite large."
"Y-you think it was a hit?"
"Well.. let's see.. uh.. he's alethic? ... And... He's good climber."
"Okay, don't over do it."
"Donavon."
_______________________________
They were lucky.
I breathe, sucking up the pit inside my stomach. "Is..." I swallow the knot forming in my throat, afraid of what it may become. "Is the golem..."
perhaps I should embrace it..?
I pull away, trying to conceal my emotions. "John, love is not an advantage." I turn my face, breath heavy and eyes wide open. "It's a curse." My lips quiver, but I bite them. "An ugly infectious virus. It blinds your insight, and clouds your judgement. Do you see?" I suddenly spin around and face him again. His hand trembles. He's afraid. "John... You're afraid. Yet love compels you to save me. Even when saving me... may ultimately kill you."
There he is. Knew it'd work.
I feign a smirk. "Obviously."
I'm conflicted- but I know should say it. I'm going to say.
I give a tender smirk. "Don't worry." I chuckle, "I won'tÂ  replace you."
John was now peering at me, his eyes blazing with denial, and his face burning with resentment.
John would've been against it. Which is why we waited until John had left the room to have the discussion. It's what was best for me.. and him.
I blink and gasp, turning my back to them. The tear trickling down my cheek was enough to tell me I was crying.. in front of everybody.
"No." He resists, but I persist. "No I really should." He exclaims, finally causing me to go quiet, "No, you shouldn't-" his face saddens- I've really done it this time. "You don't have to say those words back to me just because you think you have to-"
Anderson showed up late, but not alone. He carried Sergeant Donavon along, and well..
"And the others...?"
"God." He buries his face in his palms. I can't bear to see him so worried. It's unnerving... even for a someone like me. "I thought I'd lost you."
He breathes lazily. "Um.. well, there's only one trail of shoe prints... He used the window?"
I sigh. "Well... I've got to dash. I've got somewhere to be." I walk to the door, before adjusting my coat. I breathe quietly "Happy?"
-Lord Huron - The Night We Met
Right then my eyes fling open, and a soft, yet wry, smile spreads across my face - a dust of pink settling over my rigid cheeks. "Really?" I say in the smallest voice, eyes staring off into the telly screen vaguely.
