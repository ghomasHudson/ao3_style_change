"Whatever," he grumbles around a mouthful. "When's Jimmy come back?"
Dean looked up at him, eyes blurred with tears. Fucking hormones.
"I HATE YOU!" Jessie screamed. Dean fought back a flinch. No matter how many times she'd screamed it at him whenever she got in trouble, it never ceased to break his heart. He pushed a sigh and went into the kitchen to make her a sandwich. They hadn't served lunch yet, so she was probably starving.
Dean sighed again.
"Your daughter had gotten into a fight with another kid in school. Would you please come in for a moment?" Dean sighed. He had to study for his exam, which was in three days, and he'd barely gotten through two chapters. He'd have to cancel his third therapy appointment this month for enough to study.
"Here." Darren stopped for a moment and sat up. He reached up and made grabby hands. As Dean stood to go back to the kitchen, he heard the pack of gummy bears plop to the floor. Darren started to whine again.
"WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?!" Dean exploded. "DO YOU WANT THE DAMN GUMMY BEARS OR NOT?!" Darren threw his head back and bawled harder. Dean mentally kicked himself, slumping to the ground and watching his two-year-old screech like a banshee, dressed in his grey spiderman pajamas. He didn't know if he could handle having a third child. He was three months along—back pains, worsening nausea, aching breasts, and terrible headaches. He just wanted to crawl back into bed right now and bury himself under the blankets until all of this was over. The phone rang.
“Heart rate’s starting to drop!”
"Alright, alright. Come on.” Dean allowed himself to be guided to the bathroom, sagging against Cas’s hard body. His clammy palms clung to the fabric of Cas’s t-shirt as he gripped his shoulder. His knees felt as though they were going to fold under the pressure of his stomach.
"In a minute, Jessie!"
He knows he’s got them exactly where he wants them.
"You don't have to say it, sweetie. I know." She smiled at him and curled into his stomach. "Well, we gotta get you to bed. Try to see what we can do during your suspension. I—"
Once she was done, Dean handed her off to him. Cas gathered her into his arms and smiled down at her.
"I...wanna push..so fucking baaad!" The last word was drawn out in a sob. Hot tears streamed down his face as he felt the pressure near his lower back. He didn’t know how long he laid there, wailing as his heart pounded in his chest, before another nurse checked to see if he was crowning. Cas was squeezing his hand, dabbing the sweat off of him, trying to shush Dean, who was grinding his teeth. His gown was stuck to skin, and he felt beads of sweat trickling over his hairline and onto the pillow. Dean doesn’t even remember exactly when Dr. Milton had arrived until he felt his gown being lifted again. The weight of the doctor’s pale blue eyes between his legs almost made him squirm.
“Female. Seven-point-eight pounds. Date of Birth: December 5, 2020. Time of birth: 4:35 P.M.”
Dean rolls his eyes. "Ha ha ha, boys. Dean grabs the remote and switches on the television. He decides to watch a few episodes of Criminal Minds on Netflix. Cas joins in, taking occasional glances as he scrolls through Facebook. Jimmy puts his book down and snuggles into Dean's side. Eventually, the three of them fall asleep with the television still running on full blast.
Like their baby's life depended on it.
Making love to each other first time in Cas's fancy apartment, on his memory foam mattress.
Dean didn't even have what it took to be a good father. He was too fragile, too childish and unpractical. How could he a good father if he didn't even know what one looked like? All he knew was a dilapidated house, drunken rage, little to no food or running water, and sneaking out only to find clothes in the Goodwill box in the street. Any instance of tender love was snuffed in a blink of an eye; his Uncle Bobby, the only person in his life who actually saw him as a kid, shot himself dead months after his wife had died.
"Who the hell are you talking to?"
’s, and even one
Dean nodded weakly, "Yeah..” he panted out. “Apparently that..tends to happen." He clenched his hole. He could feel the wetness in the backs of his legs, and he knew that was
“When I lost Anna, and I just lost myself, you pulled me back and helped me find me. Even when I was at my worst, you never gave up on me.”
"Strong. Cas, I wake up every night from stupid nightmares,I'm not...I"m not fucking level-headed. I feel like I can barely hold myself together these days. Hell, I can't even go one day without having panic attacks! And..." Dean trailed off and burrowed his face back into Cas's neck.
Dean clears his throat loudly as he crosses a leg over the other to hide the tent in his pants. “Any other questions, gentlemen?”
“Can you go grab these nice gentlemen here some refreshments?”
Dean and Cas at the diner; Dean's POV
"Okay, now what I'm going to need for you to do is try to pu—." The doctor barely managed to finish his sentence before Dean started to push, squeezing Cas's hand.
"NOOOOWWWWW!!!!!"
"Alright, just stay here while I go grab the bag, alright? Just breathe." The alpha implored, sucking a breath in and out, prompting Dean to mirror the breathing exercises they learned in the lamaze class. Dean mimicked him, white-knuckling the lip of the tub as his mate bolted out to grab the emergency bag. Of course, the anxious, Type-A alpha had left a change of clothes and underwear, a pad and shoes on the sink. Dean threw them on quickly—well, as quickly as his body allowed him. He couldn’t stop trembling. He tried to calm himself, breathe through the pain, keep himself steady. Soon this pup will be out of him and he will be able to breathe normally again.
Dean sighs and grabs his phone to check the calendar. "3:30, and Cas has to pick up his meds."
Sam and Dean did their usual banter routine. Sam talked to Dean about his third date with this girl she’s been seeing, Eileen. He wouldn’t stop gushing about her, much to Dean’s amusement. He could tell his baby brother was in love with her; he wore that same dopey smile that Dean wore when he and Cas first started dating. Adam talked to him about his new acting gig. He was cast as Scar in a live production of the Lion King. The little shit had the audacity to joke that he was gonna give Jeremy Irons a run for his money. Charlie raved about some new comic book she’d been reading. Then Jody came in to lament about how much Claire and Alex had been fighting over whether Alex should change her major from premed or not. Claire had been worried that Alex had been overworking herself, and Alex kept saying, “It’s my life and my decision!” Ellen came by and brought cookies, much to Dean’s disapproval. His so-called family practically taunted him with those sweet treats, including Cas (the traitorous little shit. It’s cool though. After all, it’s not like he’ll be getting any ass for six weeks). Eventually, the nurses had to kick them out (including Ellen with her accursed cookies).
"So do I, Dean. Hell, I snapped at Jessie the other day while you were at the bank. Every parent gets frustrated with their kids and grouchy. Sometimes they don't say the right things. And they're gonna make mistakes. But it's important is that you stick around, show them you love them, work every day to keep them safe and well-fed, and don't give up on them. And don't give up on yourself, either." Dean nodded his head, wiping his eyes.
“I have given him some willow bark for the fever. Can you read? I have written down the dose and how often he will need to take it.”
The last two humans and a young nephilim against God himself.
Castiel can't move. The empty darkness is all around him. He does not know if his eyes are open or closed. Something is calling him. Longing. All he feels is longing. Someone longs for him. Needs him.
Gabriel was so dirty. Blood and mud covered his uniform and face. But the blood was not his.
“Please, help him” said the beauty.
'I love you, Dean"
"You know what you told me when you saved us all?"
To truly feel them was a gift.
Then old ghosts comes to town.
”No, we can not do anything Michael.” Castiel took their hands in his. His heart breaking.
Gabriel was unharmed.
”Cassie” He's big brother Gabriel had always been a joker and a trickster. But this almost did not sound like his voice. It was so tired and desperate. That Castiel turned around and froze at the sight of his two older brothers.
"I did!" Charlie ran up and got a bag of coins.
Let me take you to the promised land"
Castiel heard the ruckus in the reception so he came out to see one more muscle than brains kind of guy harassing Gabriel in front of the patients.
"Fuck, me too"
"You know who's fault it is" Castiel spoke softly.
"What the hell guys!" Dean was not happy.
“Are you alright, Gabriel?”
When Dean stood up Castiel kissed him. Tasting himself on Dean's tongue. Castiel walked them both to Dean's bunk. Letting Dean lay down on the bed. Beautiful and aroused.
Alistair owned Castiel. Castiel was never to leave Alistair's side. At first it was not unpleasant. Alistair just let him know that he knew all Castiel's sins, Michael's death. That Castiel was defected, an Uranian, more commonly known as a sodomite. How the doctor had found out Castiel never knew. His affections to his own sex he had never act on. But it was true. The doctor had caressed his cheek and promised that he would be quiet if Castiel would be a good boy and follow his orders.
Even behind the closed door of the Room the man's voice was heard.
His older brothers Michael and Gabriel were fighting for the Confederate side. They had no other choice when they were young and strong men. So Castiel had prayed every day for his brothers safe return. But soon came the day when the war was no longer a thing happening far away. Castiel and Dr Alistair were drafted as field doctors. The sturdy walls of the hospital were exchanged by tents or invading someone's home. Putting down a door on someone's dining room table, to save the table from the blood and the bone saw. The days melted together. All days and nights were filled with blood, pus, fevers, moans, screams, crying and death. Castiel had hated walking around the new soldiers coming in from the battle. He felt like an angel of death. Going around and deciding whom they would try to save. Who could wait. And who of the soldiers was dead, even if they were breathing still. This was something he had been doing daily for months and months. But when he lay down his head down for some well earned sleep, doubt filled his heart. Had he made the right calls? Had someone that  could have survived, died because of him?
"yes, Dean"
needs him. Dean. Dean's soul is screaming for him beyond the veil. The strong longing is waking him up.
The being smiles.
“good. Can I beg you to please try to help these men and women of color to get on the other side of the border. I want them to be free.”
"It would be my honour"
“the other one, where is he? “ the soldier asked.
Dean's groan and his hand in Castiel's hair made it even better. He was lost in the act.
They stood in silence for a few moments.
He needed to save as many as he could. To try and balance the scales.
"Castiel, what happened?" asked the cook Benny.
"Castiel, you will tell me what that was!" Claire glared.
Ten years later
So he nodded and so forth doomed himself. Not only in the eyes of the gods but of men too.
"Stay here tonight" Dean said, his head on Castiel's chest.
When Dean didn't continue Castiel had to ask.
What would he do? He had killed the hospital's best doctor. He would go to jail or be killed himself.
Castiel knew that not all were so lucky. He had tried to help the ones trapped at Crowleys, asking if they wanted to write home. But sadly most had lost that hope. Thinking of themself like fallen women. So he could only help them to try and keep their health.
"This is your own fault. You broke your deal. Humans don't belong in the Empty."
"What?"
“My little brother is sick he need medicine, please”
"idiot. I can't lose you, Cas! Never again, Cas. Do you hear me?"
It was a relief seeing the light of grace returning home. Even better was to see the demons returning to hell.
The man that had spoken was a bearded and older man. One that had an aura of pondus. He had a Marshall's star on his chest. But it was the two younger men at his side that was like ghosts coming back to hunt Castiel. The tallest man, his brown locks and strong features was as he remembered. He was alive and healthy. His eyes, a beautiful green color, that he didn't know. But the man whose eyes were even more beautiful in daylight stared at Castiel.
Castiel feels how a warmness attacks his face. A blush.
When Castiel looked up he saw Alistair smiling coldly down on him.
He rushed to his brothers and gave them a place to lay Michael down.
Dean envelopes him in a heartfelt hug.
"This is him? Your happiness?" the being is looking at Dean as he was a puzzle.
........................................
The end.
They didn't touch as they walked. Castiel couldn't stop looking at his captain, even if it was a dream he would enjoy every moment. Every step he expects to wake alone in his bunk. The moment they are alone behind closed doors Castiel hugged Dean. They both melted into each other.
"You're always welcome on my ship. I will fight anyone if they make you feel like you don't belong here. You're staying, that's an order"
"How? You are just a broken pathetic angel! Hardly a side character! You can never beat me!"
........................................
"I am yours, if you would have me." he let his hands touch Dean's arm.
"There wasn't time for Dean to say anything. Death and the Empty was coming."
Gabriel had lost his legs but needed his independence and that Castiel was glad to assist in any way he could. He was over the moon to have his brother with him.
“You are right doc.”
Sam looks at Castiel, smiles, before he sees Eileen and he starts to run to her. A lost brother wasn't as important as the love of his life.
"are we related?"
So he turned fast around and cut the jugular vein of Alistair. First one side then the other, for good measure. Alistair didn't even try to stop him. He just put his hand to his neck staring baffled at Castiel. As this was something he had never believed. The blood was warm as it hit Castiel in the face and body. Castiel looked on as Alistair died. This was a more fair death than he earned.
The trapper Rufus had found one lost soul that was in dire need.
Michael died quietly in his sleep.
“the lady needs a hiding place until I can deliver her letter so her people can come get her.”
”Castiel...” Michael's voice was just a whisper.
“it is the least I could do. I should have stopped him earlier…”
The being and the portal to the empty disappear without any trace.
His kiss was hot and loving. His hands on Dean's face angling it as he wishes. Dean looks like he is drunk when Castiel stops enough to look at his beloved.
There were still things to hunt. Monsters that needed to be dealt with.
This was one of the last outposts of the wild west. A small mining town run by the shady Azazel and his minions.
Castiel had given her the safe room. Hidden behind a bookshelf in his apartment upstairs. No window. But she seemed glad for it.
But when Jo had been in hiding for around two weeks one of the new goons came by.
A female was standing on an island in the middle of nowhere. Calling the ship with her song.
I need you here with me
The pain of losing his grace is hard. A big part of his essence is disappearing. But Dean's hand is in his, keeping him grounded.
Alistair smiled as he gently pushed Castiel forward.
Sam and Eileen got soon married and were starting a family. Living away from the bunker in a house in town.
"You!" the hissing voice of himself makes him turn. It was quite rude of the Empty using his face when it speaks to him.
Some men just ran, others started to eat. They wolfed down the meal.
“he is dead.” it felt weird to say.
"Good"
Dean is standing back, behind Jack. Castiel can't read what his beloved is feeling. His only hope was that he would be forgiven.
The wound over his midsection showed Castiel his brother's intestines. Some that was broken. Leaking. His brother was painfully dying.
In the centre was the one that made Dean take a broken breath. Not believing what he was seeing.
The morning after they explored even more what they liked.
They had even blamed Alistair for the jailbreak.
“of course. She needs to be hidden from Crowley and his men, I believe. “
"How should I know that?"
It was a big and robust table. If Castiel wasn’t scrubbing away blood from the last victim. He would have been able to admire the workmanship of the carpenter who made the table. But all he could see was the blood that stained the table. The same blood that stained Castiel's hands. The blood that would never come of his hands and soul.
“I understand that you are new to this town. But I have an agreement with your boss. You leave me and mine alone and I will try and help you if you are in need. No questions asked. But if you are going to make problems you will feel my wrath. I might even stop helping you lot all together”
Castiel cold whisper was only for the goon.
He moves, letting his body follow the longing. The only clear beacon in this nothing. The sudden distant sounds almost scared him. But he walks to it. It is something in the emptiness.
The man waved as he closed the door after him.
"yes, captain..."
Castiel continued and soon the bitter spend filled his mouth. But he drank it anyway.
There was no way to move his friend, Dean was as if he glued to the steering wheel.
“is this acceptable to you too? I am sorry that you need to play the role of what you have escaped from.”
Castiel couldn't read Dean's gaze. But it seems warm.
He shook his head.
Luckily it was the middle of the night no-one was up to see Castiel raiding medicine and food and drinks. He made a big pot of water that he would let boil until he could return and make porridge. He would feed the captives before he…
Castiel did as he was told.
Ten minutes later Castiel watched as the odd group left through the back door. The man that he had given his name waved before he followed the man pushing Sam in the wheelchair. He prayed for their safe and swift journey home.
Then slowly Alistair started to show his true colors. During the war Alistair would do things like don't give patients the pain relief they needed and other things that feel wrong. He would say that their stock of supply was too low. But Castiel knew Alistair loved inflicting pain unto others.
Alistair opened and chose the longest man Castiel had seen. The man had long brown hair. Strong, beautiful features, but he had a high fever. Hardly conscious.
Knifes, scalpels, pliers and many others.
Castiel sighed and turned to the man who paled and whispered.
"Yes?" he turned to his friend.
“Your brother is fine, he is sleeping. I will bring him back to you soon. I will get you all out of here. But please let me work so I can save you.”
Claire and her family, listening to every word.
“Legless, where is the girl!”
Not a sound was made.
"Why is Dean staring at you?" Alex asks.
The beautiful man bolted to his brother.
Voices. Many, many voices. In all the languages in the world. So he goes to the source. Humans. That he didn't expect. Humans don't belong in the Empty.
"I have no problem with you, Castiel. You are the same man that I have always known." Sam gave him a hug. Castiel almost wanted to cry. He wasn't abandoned yet.
"I wish to go back. You know that."
Castiel laughs and takes a step closer.
”This wound would need the hands of Angels to fix even at a real hospital. I am so sorry. Michael.” He looked to his brothers. Hoping that they would understand. Understand that he or anyone else could not save Michael. How much Castiel would have wished it.
The doctor who tries to save as many as he can.
"I don't want to see any of you again. If you aren't a dead angel or demon. And then you will only sleep! Do you hear me?!"
"Cas…" Dean was closer, their breath mingling between them. "Come to my bunk, please."
That evening when Castiel stood at the empty bow. He had been on edge the whole day. Waiting for someone to collect the dots and his secret would be out. He wondered if they would kill him in his sleep, throw him in the ocean or would turn him in in the next port for an even worse fate in the hands of the law and church.
If Castiel had known five years prior what he knew that night he would have done everything differently. But he could not change time. So the guilt, shame and anger was all he knew.
"No, there are rules, and you have broken them. We and the world don't need you anymore. We will be free from you and your sad attempts of writing." he feels a calm settling within him.
Castiel was the one to take the sad unrecognisable corpses and depose them.
Mostly nothing changed after the siren's attack. Some of the crew didn't want to think about it and how Castiel could save them. Others knew but didn't care. The only one that treated him differently was Dean. Dean was softer.
An hour later the wails of the crew stopped. Finally they stopped demanding him to return to the siren. That she needed them.
Claire took his hand, Jack the other.
He remembers him.
“I understand”
“nice to meet you, I am…”
"yes, I would like that" Castiel stroke light patterns on Dean's back.
Dean doesn't stop touching Castiel.
Maybe he should find a catholic church and confess for real. Maybe that would help him some more. But he didn't truly believe it.
Follow my voice and take my hand
Alistair brought them to a cell. Inside were the northern soldiers.
“No, I am to dine with my lovely neighbours.”
Sam left Castiel alone with his brother.
"So you will never return to disrupt my sleep again! Oh, I win so much in this deal!" giggled, the cosmic being is giggling! If he only wasn't wearing my face.
“Just so you know. If you or any of your lot will start to cause problems for me or my brother. You will have nightmares about the consequences. I know how to hurt as well as heal. Have I made myself clear?”
Castiel laughed and took Dean's hand and got them both breakfast. They had places to visit and adventures to be had.
"I have created you all and I can destroy you all with a snap of my fingers!"
“whose blood is that“
Kill the young man that would live if they treated his fever and feed him.

Cas: Por supuesto, Dean.
(Conozcan a Jimmy! Dean esperaba que las alas desaparecieran cuando ellos regresaran a su mundo, Cas sospechaba que no sería tan simple.)
Cuando llega la noche y Cas no ha regresado aún al búnker, Dean se replantea seriamente todas las decisiones que ha tomado en la vida.
Dean sabía que venir solo con este imbécil era la mejor opción, de esta forma Sam y Cas estaban a salvo en el bunker, pero luego del tercer encuentro con ángeles, comenzaba a pensar que se había apresurado a pasar por el portal. ¿Qué tal si no regresaba? ¿Qué tal si moría allí? Se había despedido de Sam, o algo así, pero ¿y Cas? Ni siquiera lo había llamado por teléfono. Seguramente ya estaría de regreso y furioso por saber que Dean se fue sin él. Sintió que la nostalgia lo invadía. Se había ido sin decir adiós.
Netflix and Chill ~♥
—¿Cas? —preguntó Dean con alivio mientras una sonrisa se formaba en sus labios por primera vez desde que entraron a este mundo infernal. Castiel inclinó la cabeza aún más.
, pero tú me entiendes —explicó con una risita nerviosa. Cas evitaba su mirada adrede, mirando un punto fijo en su hombro izquierdo.
Me faltaron varios días, pero creo que en general lo hice bastante bien por ser la primera vez. *se da una palmada en la espalda a sí misma y se compra un pay* jajajaja gracias por ver! ♥♥♥

Castiel: Oh, tu resurrección. Por supuesto. (Oh, your resurrection. Of course.)

—Dean sabe cuidarse solo, Cas —dijo Sam cortante volviendo a su lectura. Castiel estaba a punto de seguir discutiendo cuando la luz que emitía la grieta se intensificó captando la atención de ambos hombres.
Cas: My apologies... I... can go fix it... (Mis disculpas ... yo ... puedo ir a arreglarlo ...)
That Dean and Cas go hunting has its pros and cons.
Cas: Su primer otoño...
Dean se apresuró a rodearlo con sus brazos y volvieron a besarse entre risas. En eso estaban cuando todos en el bunker llegaron desde ambas entradas de la sala para averiguar qué había sido esa explosión.
Dean y Meg: ¡Feliz cumpleaños!
Dean: ¡Y bebe ese café antes de que se enfríe! (And drink that coffee before it gets cold!)
Cas: Por supuesto.)
Castiel: Deseé esto.

Sabía que Ketch tenía un buen punto, que lo que había entre ellos muchas veces era más que amistad o lealtad, pero por ningún motivo iba a admitirlo, no en voz alta, y mucho menos a Ketch. El ingles no volvió a insistir, solo maldijo por lo bajo y volvió a guardar silencio.

I don't think it takes much to explain the meanings of this, except for the turtle! The turtle represents myself, Morla, as the turtle from The Neverending Story. A curious fact, the angel (which is actually the archangel Michael, but who cares, is Cas Angel of the Lord as in the early seasons) is a figurine that I stole from my grandmother many years ago, in one of my "excursions", rummaging through the drawers of their cabinets. (I say "stole", but she knew exactly what I was doing, she thought it was funny, I was about the age of the photo)

Dean *susurrando*: ¿Te quedas? (Dean * whispering *: Do you stay?)
About Five Times The Distance is a beautiful fic with case, from KelpietheThundergod on Ao3. I made these illustrations for the DeanCasBigBang2018
3-Demonic (Demoníaco)
Dean: Ok... ♥
Podrán encontrar las fotohistorias completas de cada día en mi tumblr https://carolinasacco.tumblr.com/
Dean: ¡Ey! ¡Sammy! ¡Mira esto! ¡Mi tercer ojo!
No, actually, my shift is over. I'm not working right now.
—No es
Dean: See...
Dean: shit! can fly! (Dean: mierda! puede volar!)
Meg: ¡Clarence!
Dean: Gragias por no dejarme caer.
Dean: It's an emergency bacon. It's emergenbacon.
—Sólo estábamos hablando. Ella tenía algunas preguntas. Por eso demoré, pero nada sucedió entre nosotros, lo juro por Sammy —dijo cruzando su corazón en señal de juramento.
If someone has made a fanart and wants me to recreate it with my dolls, feel free to ask. :3 ♥
These are Dean and Cas with their past lives, an illustration that I made as a birthday present for @Bajosospecha, for her fic "Through the Clouds".
(See the end of the chapter for
Meg: totally (totalmente)
Dean: Todo está bien, amigo. Nada sucede.
—Ketch dijo que te estabas "despidiendo" —explicó haciendo las comillas en el aire —. No lo sé, Dean, él usó un tono extraño. Y luego tú dices que compartías lazo con ella.   —Castiel cerró los ojos y se apretó el puente de la nariz, un gesto que había adoptado de Dean —. Todos habían regresado y tú tardaste una eternidad en pasar por el portal. Mira si es así, yo lo entiendo, puedes decírmelo. Ella, Clarice, era
Castiel: * ¡¡¡♥!!! *
posted these beautiful fanarts (
como en las primeras temporadas) es una figurilla que le robé a mi abuela hace muchos años, en una de mis "excursiones" , hurgando en los cajones de sus armarios. (Digo "robé", pero ella sabía exactamente lo que estaba haciendo, pensaba que era gracioso. Yo tenía la edad de la foto)~
29- Fragile (frágil)
Castiel: Dean. Cállate. (Dean. Shut up.)
pros:
So long without seeing each other and so you greet me ...
—¿Renegada? ¿No estaba con los demás ángeles? —Cas no se veía sorprendido, nada de todo lo que había dicho lo había sorprendido en realidad.
*Nadie al rededor molestándola.
Dean: Solo, relájate. Siente la brisa.
Castiel: La hice yo. (I made it.)
Dean: Eso es ... increíble. (That is awesome.)
8-Heartless (sin corazón)
El ángel se detuvo a escasa distancia y se mantuvo en silencio, observando a Dean con unos ojos azules y penetrantes. Conocía esa mirada. La conocía muy bien. Guiado por una corazonada, Dean se puso en movimiento. Muy lentamente se incorporó en su sitio, bajando su arma. Ketch lo miraba desde el escondite como si se hubiera vuelto loco.
A little au that I did for a gift exchange in a facebook group.
Dean: Aquí tienes...
—¿Eso es...? —comenzó a preguntar Castiel, pero ya sabía la respuesta —. ¡Mi gracia! —Una sonrisa enorme se había dibujado en su rostro al tiempo que tomaba el pequeño recipiente.
—Capisci —murmuró Ketch con una sonrisa burlona —. Pero a mí no me engañas, Winchester. He conocido muchos ángeles y ese ángel te mira con devoción. Como si fueras
—Tendríamos que haber traído a tu ángel — protestó Ketch mientras desenterraba una espada ángel del cuerpo que yacía a sus pies.
felizmente recordandoles el link de mi blog: http://carolinasacco.tumblr.com/
Castiel: Feliz aniversario, Dean ~ ♥ (Happy anniversary, Dean ~ ♥)
I present to you “The Band”: In the flute, Gmork, the werewolf. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know what he’s holding…
Dean: Shut up!!

18-Dark &Stormy Night (Noche oscura y tormentosa)
—Respóndeme algo, Dean —dijo con voz ronca, a lo que Dean respondió con un
Day 19: Hotels/Motels
Dean: Es un diente de león, Cas. Pide un deseo.
~Y esta es la contraportada. El ángel brilla en la oscuridad, pero no pude obtener una buena foto brillando.~

Dean: Vive un poco.
A portrait of true-form!Meg (Un retrato de Meg en su verdadera forma)
Dean: Creo que iré por su mantita.
15- Third Eye (tercer ojo)
1-On the Road Again (En la carretera de nuevo)
—No, no, nada de eso, Cas —dijo Dean riendo y retirando sus manos con cuidado. Y si sostuvo las manos de su amigo por más tiempo del necesario, era asunto suyo y de nadie más —. De hecho, nos ayudaste. Bueno,
Meg: Ey, Dean-o, rasca mi espalda!
Gracias a todos por acompañarme este año! Espero que el año próximo sea benevolente con todos nosotros en todos los aspectos de la vida. Y que tengamos destiel canon! X3
Dean, Who is Sam talking about? Who is "Destiel"?  *This was the first drawing I made with my tablet, I know it looks horrible, especially Sam, who was the first one I drew, but what do I know, I still like it*
Castiel: Por supuesto... (Of course...)
Dean hurt! but not so much
Cas: ...
(Dean: Solo toma el maldito huevo de pascua, ¿quieres?
Meg en su nuevo recipiente (Meg in her new vessel)
—Ella quería saber si habías caído. Y si —Dudó por un momento. De acuerdo, iba a hacer esto, era ahora o nunca —... si habías caído por
Cas: Dean, solo, haz lo que te digo, ¿de acuerdo? Es un "desnudo artístico". (Dean, just do what I tell you, okay? It is an "artistic nude".)
fin~♥
Now I just need to fill it with fan arts lol But I wanted to share it with you.~♥
—No, Cas. Ya hablamos de esto. ¿Quieres que Dean regrese, no te encuentre y
Dean: Cállate, Cas... Me quedé sin batería.  (Shut up, Cas ... I ran out of battery.)
Cas: * mirando fijamente* (* staring *)
16-Switch It Up!  (Cámbialo!)
Cas: Meg? Realmente eres tú?
Castiel: Por supuesto, Dean ♥  (Of course, Dean ♥)
Sam *se ríe entre dientes y toma otra foto*
There are no clean clothes left. / No queda ropa limpia.
Dea: Sabes que no te  creo una mierda verdad? ... De acuerdo.
Cas: "Porno educado". ("Educated porn".)
With one last look towards the phone, Castiel makes his way towards the bed in the middle of the room, steps soft against the cold floor of some random motel. He places the carefully balanced tray in his hands on the small bedside table before slipping under the warm covers, the intrusion barely disturbing the sleeping man beside him. Letting his legs press up slightly against the other man, Castiel lets his fingers card through the soft brown hair.
“No, I didn’t!” the green-eyed man chuckles, “Anyway, did you finally learn how to cook or breakfast is on me?”
“If you think that Eileen can’t handle your brother then you are sorely mistaken.” Charlie cuts him off, carefully maneuvering him away from walking directly into a pole when she realizes that the man is not watching where he is going, too busy trying to locate a certain someone.
“Cas,” he says, turning to face his boyfriend, “Stop worrying about it.”
he thought, downing his drink in one go. He was going to trust Sam and go through with it. What did he have to lose after all, well except
“I will,” Castiel responds, “Now will you stop drinking for me?”
“I would have gotten up to make you some coffee, but you just didn’t want to let me go and I honestly didn’t feel like leaving you too.”
Castile nods, taking in the information before he drops his hand from Deans face, the other man’s shoulders tensing before he feels fingers clenching around the collar of his jacket, pulling him forward until there is hardly any space left between their faces, the barest brush of dry lips against his as the shorter man speaks, his blue eyes scanning his face for any hint of uncertainty, “I know that I don’t deserve you and I never really did but can I… Can I please kiss you?”
Carefully following the human’s lead, he looks down at his feet for a moment before staring back into green eyes, “Am I doing it right?”
“Sounds like someone's got a crush,” Anna says, making both him and Charlie stiffen.
“You are not trying to murder the angel, are you?” the hunter asked, “Because if you are, just try to stay away from the bed. I would like it to be bloodless.”
“Why?” Dean questions even as he does as she asks him.
“I don’t know,” she shrugs, “ I mean, I don’t have anything important here anyway and leaving L.A would probably do me some good too. Maybe I’ll like it there and then…”
“I have been ready for the last thirty minutes,” Dean replied.
Castiel huffs out a small laugh, his voice still remorseful, “But you deserve better.”
It had been more than half an hour since Charlie had dragged Cas into the room with him, and Dean was starting to get slightly worried about the angel. It had been like any other Saturday night at the bunker when the girl had crashed in, demanding them to go to the club with her. As always, Dean had immediately agreed and with a bit of persuasion, so had Sam and Jack, but Castiel was hard to convince. Had had repeatedly tried to tell them about how he would not fit in with them and ruin their fun night, but Charlie was hearing none of it.
He closes his eyes, hating the way he still loves the way his name sounds on the man’s lips. “Hey, Cas.”
He heard the front door slam shut, keys jingling as they are dropped on the kitchen table, the sound of heavy footsteps approaching his room making him sigh. The door to his room opens just as he groans into his pillow, turning towards the wall so that the man can’t see his face, he mumbles, “Can’t we talk about this later?”
He jumps suddenly when a hand grips his wrist before he feels a thumb stroking the inside of his hand, a too-familiar voice whispering millimeters away from his ear.
“Let’s get you back to your dorm,” she says softly, winding an arm around his waist. He doesn’t hesitate to lean back, gaze strictly planted on the pavement coated with snow in front of him as he blocks out everything he is feeling, blinking away the tears, greeting the numbness that settles.
“Will you stay on the phone with me?” his voice is hesitant as he quickly adds, “I mean it’s fine if you don’t want to and I know that you have work tomorrow morning and i-”
“I’m going to get another drink,” Sam cut him off, “Heaven knows that I need it if I’m going to be stuck here with you and your denial.”
He hesitates slightly, hand hovering over the green button before he taps it, liquid courage flowing through his veins as he places the call on speaker, a million different scenarios passing through his brain, the monotonous ringing filling up his room along with his loud breaths.
Dean Winchester sits on the bathroom counter, shifting ever so slightly every few seconds, trying to shake off the nerves he was feeling. This would be the first party he would be attending ever since he came out in the middle of the cafeteria two weeks ago in the most embarrassing way. In his defense, it had been a dare from his friend and Dean Winchester never backed out on a dare and so in less than a minute, he was standing on the table shouting about his obsession with western movies and another minute later he was being dragged back by his friends as he tried to beat the shit out of a homophobic asshole.
Everyone else had been surprisingly fine with the knowledge that the freshman heartthrob was bisexual, but tonight was really going to test it.
“Hey, Cas,” he replies, hoping his voice doesn’t sound as breathy as he thinks it does, “Didn’t expect to see you here.”
He slipped his hands under the gray t-shirt, rubbing circles into the soft skin. Soon the tender kisses turned into hurried ones, trying to take in everything the other was giving, making up for all the lost time. Dean felt a body bump against him, making him stumble into the angel. Pulling back, he held the angel close to him, pressing their foreheads together, trying to regain his breathing. He felt the need thrum under his skin as the angel pushed his body flush against the hunters.
“Let’s go to the kitchen,” Charlie shouts, head tilting towards the doorway to punctuate her sentence.
“Good,” the man tells him, “Do you think you will be able to sleep now?”
“Hello” a groggy voice comes through the speaker, Dean’s ribs tightening around his lungs as the man continues,, “It’s three in the morning, Meg.”
The hunter sighed, feeling the warm and familiar body settle down next to him. Finally, turning his gaze toward the person, Dean stared at the face of the man he loved. The gentle yellow light of the flame landed gently across his face, a smile playing on his lips, his dark hair sticking up in all directions, light stubble on his cheeks, and cream paint smudged down his throat. The hunters’ breath hitched as his green eyes eventually locked with the man’s blue ones that were overflowing with love and adoration.
The man crumbled to the floor, resting his head against the gravel as he wraps his arms around his body, trying to stop himself from falling apart, three words escaping from his lips, repeating itself like a prayer.
“Can I come in at least?” he asked, trying the knob.
“It was not supposed to be this hard!” he complains, “It took me over two years to reset my life after everything but just one look at him and I’m back and it… it’s not fair!”
“I called you?” Dean tries to dig up what he might have said, but he comes up empty-handed, his brain having no recollection about the events of last night. Pausing, he then carefully questions, “What all did I tell you?”
“Okay, I made us late, but can we please leave now before Benny starts to think that someone kidnapped us on our way?”
Castiel feels blood rushing into his face as he turns his head away, the hunter laughing at his reaction as he presses his lips to his cheek, the stubble rubbing against his skin softly before he drops his head back on the angel’s lap.
“Don’t touch my stuff!” Dean shouted, “It’s not-”
that makes you feel like running your fingers through it every time you look at it.” Dean groans as the redhead repeats the words he had said one night after a little too much vodka, “And those
he thought. He had waited too long for this, and he was not waiting for anyone any longer. Those three were old enough to catch a cab and come back home whenever they wanted. He had a willing angel walking behind him and there was no way he was not going to rush back to the bunker, throw him on his bed and take him apart slowly until he could not remember anything other than Dean’s name. That was his only priority.
. He thinks. “I’m fine.” he says, “What about you?”
for tonight and by god, she had lived up to her word. The white band t-shirt looked perfect with his black ripped jeans his best friend had blackmailed him into wearing, and the black leather jacket he had donned was definitely completing the whole look.
Dean sighs, and the apology is clear in his voice, “I already promised Lisa that I would come.”
The angel laughed at this; the sound echoing against the walls of Deans’ room, making warmth creep into his bones.
“I can’t go back there and face him, Charlie.” Dean admits, “I can’t go out and act as if everything is fine when…”
Would he cut the call as soon as he heard Dean speak?
Dean gulped, “I don’t think-”
“I do, bitch!” Dean shouts at him, a small smile creeping up his face.
“You don’t just leave a voice message at fucking four-o’clock in the morning mentioning how you are sitting on the edge of a cliff drunk out of your mind and then completely
Dean laughs, placing a kiss over Castiel’s heart before he pushes himself off the man, “Pancakes and bacon it is then.”
“What are you thinking about?” the angel asks.
His sentence is cut short as the front door opens again, his eyebrows furrowing before he recognized the familiar footsteps on the wooden floor. He sees a head peeking through the gap in his door before the woman enters his bedroom, flinging herself on the mattress without a single word to him, she glances at his brother, “So I guess you found out about Lebanon too.”
He knows that she has a point and there was absolutely no way in hell that he was going to leave early tonight, even if it meant facing a certain person whom he wished he never had met. Dean hated the way his mind was moving towards, the memories from a summer night flashing across his eyelids each time he blinked, a bright smile, a loud laugh, and blue eyes haunting him. A warm feeling erupts in his gut, an inside joke in his head and an overflowing heart in his chest.
After a few moments, Castiel presses a kiss on the other man’s neck, dean tilting his head to the side automatically as goosebumps appear on the back of his neck. “I love you so much.”
” the hunter said.
“I’m glad you liked it.” the angel replies, a long pause following as they stare into each other before he says, “We should get back now.”
“You are awesome!” the taller man says.
“Dean,” Sams’ voice pulled him back into the present, “Are you planning to be this moody all night or are you actually going to loosen up a bit.”
Standing up, he wiped his clammy hands on his jeans and made his way towards the pair. The strange man scurried off the moment he saw Dean walking towards him, glaring in his direction. Castiel didn’t seem to mind his absence, and the green monster of jealousy calmed down a bit. He placed himself behind the angel, his hands finding their way to rest of the angels’ hips.
Instead, he felt a soft touch on his face, calloused hands cupping his jaw, coaxing him to open his eyes. Blue eyes looked into his soul, overwhelmed with surprise, happiness, and love. Dean felt Everything else fade away until it was just the two of them standing there alone in the middle of the floor. He inhaled sharply as the angel stroked his cheek, fingers rubbing the light stubble present.
“You look different,” the dark-haired man says after a few seconds.
“Morning,” the hunter mumbles, yawning loudly before he gazes up expectantly.
Castiel shudders slightly when he feels teeth scrape against his earlobe, taking a shaky breath he pushes Dean away, “I was thinking of going sightseeing and just acting like normal people for a day but if you want-”
“Honestly, it is.” she answers with a smile, “But, if it makes you feel better, I realized it because I do know what my brother looks like.”
“That's not what I asked,” Castiel shakes his head, “How do you want to celebrate your birthday?”
“I was going to tell you this weekend after I finalized the house,” he replies, mentally preparing himself for the dreadful conversation that he knew was coming.
He nods his head softly, “Yeah.”
Castiel hums, almost pressing their mouth together before thinking better of it, the need to say something overweighting the urge to kiss the other man. He likes his lips, confusion evident on the other man’s face before he locks their eyes, “
“Now it is,” she grins at the exasperated look on his face, her eyes widening when they land on something over his shoulder, “Incoming at 6-o’clock.”
“I literally uprooted my whole life because of you!” He cuts Castiel off, having no control over himself as the words finally flow out of him, all the emotions he had suppressed for the last years bursting out, “I tried to escape you, starting over somewhere far away from you but you still haunt me. Each time I think I have finally moved on, something happens that makes me remember you.”
“How do you-” Castiel stops, “Meg is my best friend, not my girlfriend.”
“Promise,”
As they step outside the glass door, Dean hums in appreciation as the cold November air nips his skin, finally away from all the sweaty bodies and the smell of alcohol and too much perfume. Castiel shivers slightly next to him, making Dean turn towards him with eyebrows raised.
he came out.
The man’s eyes leave the woman as he leans over the crowd of people, blue eyes moving around the room until they land on him.
“You do know that he’s going to kill both of us and then Eileen when he finds out that I am still trying to-”
“What did you do, Castiel?” he asks no one in particular, his voice breaking as he sobs out, “You don’t even have his number or any other way to contact him and…”
“Me too,” Castiel says, and if anyone ever asks, Dean would deny the blush that crawls on his cheeks at that statement.
?” Sam exclaims, turning towards his brother, he asks, “When are you leaving?”
Charlie had asked.
“Dean I-”
“Alright then!” She grabs Gabriel’s forearm, dragging him away from the duo with a hardly concealed wink towards Dean.
“Shit,” he says into the cold room.
Castiel placed a finger on the hunter’s lips, silencing him effectively. Neither of them knew how much time passed as they sat there staring into each other’s eyes before the angel lowered his hand, quickly replacing it with his lips.
The angel nodded.
He can only nod in response as both of them watch her walk away, Charlie whipping her head towards him as soon as the other girl disappears, the look in her eyes making Dean regret ever agreeing to come to the party.
“Thank you for today,” the human whispers, the smile on his face making his eyes crinkle.
Dean hates the way even after all this time his answer is the same,
“Hey! It’s me. You know what to do.”
“No, Dean.” Sam answers standing at the foot of his bed, “I need some answers from you and I need them now.”
Castiel tilts his head slightly in confusion, his eyebrows furrowing slightly, “Why?”
The angel smiled at him, making his heart stutter. He wanted to hold the angel’s hand, wrap his arm around his waist, place his hands on the small of his back, drifting a little down just to tease him.
“Okay,” he answers, eyes still fixed on the door as he feels the nerves come back.
, finally
“A bit sleepy, but otherwise I think I’m okay.” Castiel replies, a muffled yawn coming through the speaker before he admits, “I honestly have no idea what to say to you.”
Castiel looks towards the blue wallpaper of the motel wall, trying to push down his sadness, “I had expected us to have reached back home by yesterday.”
Castiel looks at him with a blinding smile, making Dean’s lips tug up in response. Castiel picks up an end of the blanket when he sees him shiver, silently gesturing towards him to come closer so they both can share it. Dean hesitates a second before crawling under the warm quilt, rolling his eyes at the wolf whistles from his friends and doing his best to ignore the way his heart races as he sits next to the guy who has been visiting him in his sleep a lot more nights than Dean would admit, sinking into the warm body next to him, sighing softly when he feels Castiel’s arm wrap around his waist, pulling him closer.
“As are you, Dean.” his eyelashes flutter against the hunter’s neck, making goosebumps appear, “And I love you.”
“And so are you, Clarence,” Megs strolls out of the bathroom, hair down, looking comfortable in a way that she never lets anyone other than a selected number of people witness.
“But what if he decided not to come here?” Dean speaks before his brain can stop him, “I mean, he probably has a million friends and he could have changed his mind-”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, his gravelly voice making Dean’s stomach flip in ways he didn’t want to think about.
“Another glass of that fancy thing you have them serving and I’ll be as good as new!” Charlie chuckles at Dean’s words. Turning towards Sam, she adds, “You don’t need to worry, Sam. I’m gonna keep an eye on this old man to make sure that he doesn’t go around causing any trouble.”
“It’s fine,” Castiel shrugs, trying to keep the disappointment from his voice. He draws back, letting his head fall back on the door with a thud as he takes a lungful of the cold air, eyes opening to find the slightly taller man watching him under the light from the lamp in the far corner of the room, eyes wide, lips swollen.
“If you want to cop out, then I’m sure that Sam will understand, but you would hate yourself forever if you ditch your brother’s engagement party.”
Dean stirred slightly, Castiel’s eyes fixed on his face, unblinking as he commits each and every second to memory, green eyes fluttering open as they meet his, soft smile tugging on his lips mirroring Castiel’s.
Cheering loudly, he tackles the redhead into a hug, making sure not to put too much of his weight on the poor girl, Dean looks at her, “You are the best!”
Almost two minutes later, when he can still feel the man’s eyes on his face, he says, “I didn’t know that Anna was your sister,”
“Because I knew that if I told you what I wanted, then you would try to stop me and-”
“Whatever,” Dean mumbles before he streets the help the angel packs up their lunch, a comfortable silence enveloping them as they work.
“Not until last night when this guy called me at 4 in the morning drunk out of his mind as he finally told me about
“There’s no way I’m leaving tonight before I taste that delicious pie that you have for dessert.”
Charlie plucks his glass from his hand, looking at the black-haired boy, “Why don’t you both go and make sure they have some space for us while Gabe and I can grab a refill,”
“Alright! I’m up!” Castiel coaxes his eyes open, blinking a few times before his gaze falls on Dean, “This better be good.”
“A few more
Castiel gazes down at the man, his head on his lap as the angel carefully traces an unidentifiable pattern on his face, feather-light touches moving across the freckled skin, his other hand buried in the soft golden strands of the hunter’s hair. His lips mirror the soft curve of a smile on the human’s face, mind captivated by the relaxed features.
Perdón por la demora, y gracias por la paciencia! ♥♥♥
Nota: esta es un poco vieja, de antes de teñir la piel de Cas, y su ropa aún estaba en construcción (si miran con atención la camisa no tiene botones) jejeje pero me sigue gustando X3 (Note: this is a bit old, before dyeing Cas's skin, and his clothes were still under construction (if you look carefully the shirt has no buttons) hehehe but I still like X3)
day 12: R.I.P.
Dean: Ey Cas, feliz aniversario ~ ♥ (Hey Cas, happy anniversary ~ ♥)
Cas: yes (sí)
Dean: ¿Cas?
Raising children without childhood, killing boogeymans, the family business.
Dean: I don't care. I just want to sleep. Do what you want with the fucking bear.
Castiel observaba las luces distantes de la batalla. Había abandonado su puesto mucho antes de que el apocalipsis comenzara. Con dolor, vio morir a sus hermanos a manos de sus hermanos. Por años observó cómo la humanidad fue arrasada sin piedad, la obra más amada de su padre, llevada al borde de la extinción. Pero esa no era su guerra.
Castiel *sonriendo tímidamente *: Feliz cumpleaños, Dean. (Castiel *smiling timidly*: Happy birthday, Dean.)
Dean: Cierra la boca!!)
Dean:...
bunker
~Este era para un fic de mafia, donde Cas era el heredero del Negocio Familiar, y Dean tenía al rededor de 18 años y era su novio.~
24-Family Business (negocio familiar)
Dean... After so long?
Sam miró cómo el par se alejaba en dirección a la cocina y decidió que lo mejor sería darles espacio. Se acomodó las mangas ya arremangadas de la camisa y se dirigió hacia Gabriel para ocuparse de él.
Las medallas de hilo son banderas, de izquierda a derecha: arriba: asexual (aunque apenas se nota la diferencia entre gris y blanco, pero bueno, eso es lo que tenía); una inventada que incluye a Dean y Cas en el centro y sus banderas en los extremos. Y abajo: una inventada que representa la bandera poliamorosa y Dean, Cas y Meg (porque ¿por qué no? ¿Quién me detiene? ¡Es mi diario!); y la bandera proculsexual.~
14-Fun & Games (diversión y juegos)
Dean: ¿De mi trasero? (From my butt?)
*Le quita la máscara* (* Removes the mask *)
These were two photo short stories and I decided to join them in one because I think they flow well together.
Note: it is still not completed, will wear a leather jacket and accessories, but could not wait to present it: Meg! (sisi, Meg Masters, but in kitten X3)
~Este fue el primer dibujo que hice con mi tablet, ya sé se ve horriible, sobre todo Sam, que fue el primero que dibujé, pero qué se yo, igual me gusta.~
¿O mi
Dean: It's a
Cas: Dean... necesito que sepas... tú eres mi hogar.
—No, Cas —aseguró Dean.
Dean: Watch out, kiddo. You are going to crash your mini-Impala with that DeanCas-trash. (Cuidado, peque. Vas a estrellar tu mini-Impala con esa porquería DeanCas)
Dean: Ok, gracias hombre.
Castiel: *Sopla*
When night falls and Cas has not yet returned to the bunker, Dean seriously rethinks all the decisions he has made in life.
~No creo que sea muy necesario explicar el significado de estos, ¡excepto por la tortuga! La tortuga me representa a mí, Morla, como la tortuga de The Neverending Story. (o La historia interminable, o como se haya llamado esa película/libro en su país)
Dean: Hey Cas! Check this out: The weight of The Earth on my shoulders :)
Esta vez sintió un golpe en el pecho, como una puñalada. Se miró pero no había heridas, en su lugar, un delgado cordón de gracia había aparecido y se extendía ondulante, perdiéndose en el horizonte. El cabello y los restos andrajosos de sus ropas se arremolinaban con el viento, pero la línea de luz se mantenía inamovible. Castiel desplegó sus alas negras y estrelladas como la noche, y se lanzó al vuelo siguiendo el sendero luminoso.
Dean: ¿De dónde sacaste la máscara de Zorro? (Where did you get the Zorro mask?)
more photos on my tumblr (más fotos en mi tumblr)
Dean: That will give Sam something to do for a bit. ;) (Eso le dará a Sam algo que hacer por un tiempo. ;) )
Hace unos días, mis amigas y yo nos reunimos y todas estaban haciendo estos “Diarios de artistas”, usando libros antiguos y pintando en sus páginas sobre el texto impreso. Y la idea parecía divertida y quería probarla. Iba a usar un diccionario antiguo... ¡pero luego tuve una revelación! ¡El diario de papá!
Castiel: ¡¡Dean!!
Day 18: Food
Dean: Eso es, compañero.
Dean: ¿Esas son mis bragas? (Are these my panties?)
Aquí reportándome viva durante la cuarentena! Ya en serio, no estuve actualizando últimamente porque estoy escribiendo un fic para el BDBB (Bottom Dean Big Bang) y tenía fecha límite para entregar el borrador. Ahora ya está entregado, y aunque aún me falta para terminarlo, espero pronto poder volver a trabajar en las demás historias que siguen inconclusas.
26- Walk of Shame (Paseo de la Vergüenza)
contras:
—Sólo faltan dos horas para que el portal se cierre, Sam ¿Qué tal si no logra llegar a tiempo? — respondió preocupado. La determinación de Sam de no permitirle entrar a buscar a Dean estaba comenzando a enfadarlo.
(Él tiene la cara de papá y los ojos de mamá.)
Castiel: Hola, Dean. (Hello, Dean)
Castiel *lo mira fijamente de nuevo*
Castiel: Dean, vas a hacerte daño.
Dean: Just take the fucking Easter egg, will you?
Castiel: mmm... Dean...
Dean: What the Hell!? ( ¿¡ qué mierda?!)
Dean: Buen punto...
Dean *todavía desconcertado*: ¿De acuerdo? (Dean * still baffled *: Okay?)
Cas: Will the bear stay between us?
Castiel: Pero dijiste que te gustaría... (But you said that you would like ...)
Ok, tal vez no hay contras después de todo.
Dean: ¡OH! ¡MIERDA!
Dean: ¡Mierda Cas! ¡¡E-eso es demasiado!! ¡¡SAM está aquí!!
Dean: Sí, lo sé. Cambié de opinión. Prefiero verte la cara. (Yes, I know. I changed my mind. I prefer to see your face.)
Cas: Quédate allí, quiero tomar una foto. (Stay there, I want to take a picture)
Destiel
31- Carry on (Continuar)
Dean: Ey, Sammy, tómanos una foto.
(Dean is also a bear at night)
Dean: Come on, Cas, let's catch that witch!
Cas: Dean, tu dedo está en mi nariz.
fin~♥
It may not be the right time, but ... why did you leave?
Castiel: Por supuesto, Dean.  (Of course, Dean)
Los amo! Feliz año nuevo! ♥♥♥
—No puedo hacer esto aquí. Cuando reciba la gracia habrá una especie de explosión.
Dean: Mira, hice esta mierda para ti. (Look, I made this crap for you.)
Forget it, I don't want to bother you. It's three in the morning, you need to rest.
Cas: Happy birthday Dean!!!  (feliz cumpleaños, Dean!!! )
Dean: ¿Qué diablos, Cas? (What the heck, Cas?)
* No one around bothering her.
nos ayudó. Era una especie de
Castiel: Dean ¿Qué quieres decir? Hace solo unas horas que... (Dean What do you mean? Only a few hours ago... )
Dean: Tú me cuidas, verdad?
Una morena con el cabello semi recogido y revuelto por el viento emergió de la bruma y caminó serena pero decididamente hacia ellos. Tenía una espada ángel en la mano derecha y una sonrisa extraña en el rostro. Mientras avanzaba, varios relámpagos iluminaron la noche.
Castiel: Por supuesto, Dean. (Of course, Dean.)
Dean: ¿Qué? (What?)
cons:
—Dices que... ¡Por Dios, Dean! ¡¿Te ataqué?! —preguntó horrorizado Castiel —.  ¿¿Te hice daño?? —insistió tomándolo de los hombros y mirándolo de arriba abajo como si pudiera haberse escapado alguna herida que no había visto antes.
La primera en regresar fue Mary. Al verla, Sam saltó de su sitio y se apresuró a rodearla con sus brazos. Casi de inmediato Jack apareció detrás. Esta vez fue Castiel quien reaccionó para recibir al recién llegado. Transcurrieron unos pocos segundos y el portal volvió a brillar. Pero en lugar de Dean, el que lo atravesó fue Ketch. No hubo abrazos para Ketch. El ingles se hizo a un lado y tomó asiento en la mesa frente a ellos. Mary, luego de saludar a Castiel y dar una mirada extraña al arcángel en el rincón, siguió su camino hacia las duchas. Jack se entretuvo mirando de cerca a Gabriel. Pasaron cinco, diez, 30 segundos, y nadie más aparecía por el portal.
Dean: Sabes que acabas de arruinar el momento, ¿verdad?
There are no dialogues in this, but there are smut. It's from when I still did not have Dean's body, and Cas was missing his human.
Dean: ...
Dean: When we get to the end, we just rewind and start over. (Cuando llegamos al final, simplemente retrocedemos y comenzamos de nuevo.)
Dean: Esto se parece más a pornografía suave para mí. (This is more like soft porn to me.)
21-Fear (Miedo)
Dean: Así que vas a comer, y te va a gustar ¿Me escuchas? (So you're going to eat, and you're going to like it, do you hear me?)
~Un pequeño au que hice para un intercambio de regalos en un grupo de facebook.
Meet Jimmy! Dean hoped that the wings would disappear when they returned to their world, Cas suspected that it would not be so simple.
In the bandoneon Alejandro Keres the vampire. Or
Castiel: Y ahora, ¿qué?
Dean: * gruñe suavemente * (* grunts softly *)
Meg had things to do and couldn’t babysit that day
! Castiel!!
(Es solo una pequeña sesión improvisada luego de terminar el arduo trabajo de modelar, hornear y maquillar a Jimmy. Pronto tendrá ropa apropiada.)
El ángel le mantuvo la mirada sin pestañear por varios segundos. Dean podía sentir sus palpitaciones acelerarse cada vez más. Temía haberse equivocado. Estar viendo cosas que no estaban allí. Pero entonces la mujer entrecerró los ojos, apretó las cejas frunciendo la nariz, y torció la cabeza hacia un lado.
Dean: Shut up! I am hilarious!!
In percussion, Jamenk.
27- Banquet (banquete)
Castiel: ¿Llamaste?
Dean:...
Dean: Ídem ♥ ♥ ♥ (Ditto ♥♥♥)
This was a mafia fic, where Cas was heir to the Family Business, and Dean was around 18 years old and was his boyfriend.
Later, alone... (Más tarde, a solas...)
Dean: Deberías estar mirando a la cámara, amigo.
Ketch estuvo a punto de ponerse en pie para atacar, pero Dean se lo impidió. Algo en ella le resultaba familiar. Iba vestida de negro, llevaba un chaleco antibalas al igual que todos los ángeles que habían visto, pero no usaba el uniforme militar como el resto de ellos. Su vestimenta se veía desgastada y llevaba un saco largo color beige que parecía haber sido un vestido antiguo del que ya no quedaba casi nada.
que la guió hasta mí. —Dean seguía describiendo lo que ella le había explicado que veía, pero Castiel había dejado de escuchar. Se había quedado petrificado luego de oír "cordón de gracia" ¿Dean compartía lazo con ese otro Castiel? ¿Cómo era eso posible? —. Cas. Ey, Cas —dijo Dean chasqueando los dedos enfrente de su cara. Castiel volvió a enfocar la mirada en el rostro pecoso de su amigo —. ¿Tú también ves el lazo? Quiero decir, ¿
Dean: Wow. Ok, ok, amigo. (Wow. Ok, ok, buddy)
Dean: WHAT THE HELL!!?
I don't expect it to really look alike, I just wanted to include all elements of the original, but transformed, looked at with rainbow glasses if you will. I have a rosary completely identical to the original, it is a Spanish rosary of rose petal pearls, but what is the fun of using one like it? So I decided to replace it with my little Mala (a kind of rosary for Ho'oponopono).
Dean is still worried, but it’s just stress.
Castiel: Por supuesto. (Of course.)
... —Con cada pregunta Dean había ido bajando un poco más el tono de voz, y terminó hablando en un susurro ronco que a cualquiera le hubiera costado trabajo comprender, pero que Castiel oía a la perfección.
Cas: ¿La pirámide humana es absolutamente necesaria?
—¿La besaste? —preguntó con un hilo de voz.
When you told me you loved me ... I was terrified ... that's why I ran away.
Sam: ¡Dean! ¡¡Deja de estar jugando y ayúdame con los cadáveres!!
Dean: Te mostraré mi arma si me muestras la tuya. (I'll show you my weapon if you show me yours.)
Sam *toma la foto*
I work here, I'm your doctor, Dean.
Súbitamente una sensación de anhelo inundó su mente. No era exactamente una plegaria, pero alguien estaba pronunciando su nombre. Hacía más de un siglo que ningún humano llamaba a Castiel por su nombre.
Meg: *sisea como gato*
The family continues to grow. After a trip through Fantasia (the world of The Neverending Story), Dean came home with a little surprise.
? —preguntó gesticulando entre ambos, yendo desde su plexo solar hasta el de Castiel pero sin tocarlo. Cas tragó con fuerza y respondió en un susurro "Si, Dean." El cazador se quedó observando a su amigo por un momento, asintiendo en silencio, y luego cambió de tema — . ¿Puedes creer que te reconocí al instante? —dijo sonriendo orgulloso. Castiel lo miró ahora genuínamente sorprendido y Dean soltó una risa dando una palmada en su hombro.
~Algunos dibujos que hice como regalos para mis amigas.~

Castiel: *Respira profundamente*
Dean: Días, Sol. El desayuno estará listo de inmediato. (Morning sunshine. Breakfast will be ready immediately)
This is a commission I made for KelpietheThundergod (ao3) for their fic When We're Together, set after 15x20, in an au where Dean survived but is in a wheelchair.
Dean: Vamos a casa.
Meg: Eso es, justo ahí!
Day 20: Imagination
de Dean cuando vieron una esfera de fuego aproximarse a toda velocidad. Buscaron refugio tras unas rocas y esperaron con las armas listas para disparar balas de ángel. A cinco metros de su posición, el bólido impactó contra el suelo arenoso levantando una densa nube de polvo. Vieron una silueta oscura replegar unas alas enormes hasta desaparecer en su espalda. La figura avanzó hacia ellos y lentamente se volvió más y más visible.
Note: Keres is a vampire who is living with them in the bunker. To learn more about him and his story, read "Supernatural Interminable."

Cas: Cállate y siéntate allí. mmm Más piel. Quítate la remera, ¿quieres? (Shut up and sit there. mmm More skin. Take off your shirt, will you?)
Cas: Sé que estás haciendo trampa, es sólo que no sé cómo... aún.
And this is the back cover. The angel glows in the dark, but I couldn't get a good photo glowing.
—¡Aguarda, aguarda! —exclamó Dean de pronto rompiendo el beso que llevaba varios minutos ininterrumpidos. Castiel emitió un sonido que podía interpretarse como una queja pero hizo lo que le pedía —. Tengo algo para ti. Un obsequio del

~Y finalmente, como gracias a él (y a sus manías por no tirar cosas) esto es posible, incluí una foto antigua de mi padre. Este es él, curiosamente a la misma edad que Dean tenía cuando comenzó el programa. Escuchen esto, somos de Argentina, literalmente del otro lado del continente, pero tenemos familia en Canadá, y ahí fue donde mis padres se fueron de luna de miel. Esta foto es de ese viaje, y aunque estoy bastante segura de que no es el mismo, me gusta pensar que ese es el puente del Cielo de Dean.
That’s better.

En 2019, mi padre falleció después de tres años de Alzheimer prematuro (tenía 63 años). Después de un tiempo, limpiamos las cosas que guardaba, y entre cuadernos y diarios viejos, me re-encontré con este diario viejo que apenas había usado, pero lo guardó durante años porque le gustaba. Siempre me gustó esa agenda. Y cuando lo volví a ver, me di cuenta de que se parecía mucho al diario de John Winchester... así que lo guardé para hacer una réplica.
~Estos son Dean y Cas con sus vidas pasadas, ilustración que hice como regalo de cumpleaños para @Bajosospecha, por su fic "A través de las nubes". ~
I-I'm sorry... hi Cas... It's just that I was surprised to see you here.
Castiel: Oh, por supuesto.
~Algunos, sin ninguna relación aparente.~
Castiel: Mis disculpas, Sam.
casi inaudible —. Dime la verdad, sea cual sea. ¿Te acostaste con ella? —Sus ojos parecían lanzar chispas cuando al fin alzó la vista.

Cas: Yo también te amo, Dean. ~ ♥ (I love you too, Dean. ~ ♥)
—Perra —respondió su hermano automáticamente guiñándole un ojo. Finalmente fijó su atención en Castiel. Sopesó la posibilidad de volver a acercarse y abrazarlo, pero el momento había pasado. Tragó saliva y se mojó los labios —. Ey, Cas. ¿Podemos hablar un momento? —preguntó haciendo un ademán en dirección a la otra sala. Castiel frunció el ceño desorientado por la pregunta y murmuró
—Dean sabía que comenzaba a ruborizarse furiosamente, pero la cocina del bunker estaba en penumbras y confió en que fuera la oscuridad suficiente como para que no se note demasiado.
Sam *ríe con fuerza y sigue tomando fotos*
Este ya tiene varios años, y está pintado con el mouse jajaja pero bueno, aunque tiene mil errores, me sigue gustando.~
*Cas looks attentively the movements of Dean and frowns*
This one is already several years old, and it is painted with the mouse hahaha but hey, although it has a thousand errors, I still like it.
Cas: Dean, I'm sure you've been resurrected many more times than I ...
Day 14: Fire
Dean: Ey, gracias, amigo. (Hey, thanks, dude.)
—Q-que sí —siseó Dean con labios temblorosos. La mirada de Castiel fue recobrando vida a medida que su cerebro procesaba lo que acababa de oír. Cuando al fin alzó las cejas y sonrió, Dean lo rodeó con sus brazos enterrando la cabeza en su cuello. La piel fresca de Castiel se sentía helada en contraste con su rostro en llamas, pero ya no importaba —. Lamento haberme ido sin avisarte —dijo sin moverse de su sitio. Cas suspiró. Tenía su mano derecha sobre el hombro de Dean, en el mismo sitio donde solía estar la cicatriz, y con la otra mano acariciaba suavemente su mandíbula. Dean se incorporó despacio, dejando el peso de su cabeza en la palma de Cas, soltó finalmente el abrazo, acunó el rostro de su ángel entre sus manos y cerró la distancia entre ellos. Dean besó a Castiel por primera vez en la oscuridad de la cocina del bunker, lentamente, con el cansancio del día agotador resonando en cada músculo. Cas le devolvió el beso feliz, con su familia completa, en su hogar.
Cas: Perfecto ♥ (Perfect ♥)
fin~❤
Dean: ¡Oh, sí, perra! La venganza se sirve fría.
—¡Dean! ¡Pero qué...! —Sam no completó la oración al entrar y ver el desastre y a su hermano y su mejor amigo en el centro de todo eso, besándose como si no hubiera mañana. Al escuchar la voz de Sam, Dean rompió el beso y miró alrededor. Todos los estaban mirando desconcertados.
rowena
—dijo mientras comenzaba a rebuscar entre sus bolsillos. Le dio la espalda por un momento y cuando volvió a mirarlo sostenía ambas manos cerradas en alto —. Adivina en que mano está. —Jugó risueño, pero Cas lo miró molesto, luego bajó la vista a las manos, y escogió una. Dean rió nuevamente y abrió la otra. Sobre la palma de su mano brillaba una pequeña botella de vidrio.
Dean: Dude, the pandemic! Personal space!… at least wear a mask!
Castiel: ¿Qué sucede? ¿Sam está bien?
nos encontraste —dijo enfatizando las palabras para captar su atención. Lo consiguió, Castiel lo miraba ahora siguiendo cada uno de sus gestos —. Tú... quiero decir,
No, Cas, I'm sorry. I've regretted it every day...

Cas: Meg... ya hablamos sobre esto...
He has the face of dad and the eyes of mom.
Cas: Of course.
Dean: ¡Hola Cas! Mira esto: El peso de la Tierra sobre mis hombros :)

Your brother is on his way, I already informed him about the accident.
estas eran dos foto historias cortas y decidí unirlas en una porque me parece que fluyen bien juntas.
¿Qué? ¿Por qué no?
¿Despedirse de quien? Sam se encogió de hombros como respuesta a la pregunta que Cas no había formulado y luego se volteó para interrogar a Jack, pero éste ya se había ido de la biblioteca. Ambos hombres se quedaron observando en silencio la luz de la grieta que ya había comenzado a cerrarse. Dos minutos. Parecía una eternidad. Finalmente volvió a parpadear y Dean apareció parado a unos pasos de distancia. Ambos respiraron aliviados y Sam se acercó para abrazarlo murmurando "Maldición, Dean." Castiel se quedó de pie a su lado observándolo con detenimiento, escaneando posibles heridas.
Y así fue como empecé a armar esta especie de parodia del John's Journal, como un "Heller's Journal".~
era realmente necesario?)
Cas: Gracias, Dean
*eye fucking*
"Castiel, lo lamento." Pensó. No era una plegaria, era inútil orar ¿verdad? Cas no lo oiría desde esta otra dimensión. "Quisiera que Castiel esté aquí." Sacudió la cabeza para terminar con esa línea de pensamiento, debía concentrarse, estaban en territorio hostil.
Dean: ¿Qué deseaste?
Yeah well, life can change a lot in ten years, Dean.
Dean can’t really be dead …
Castiel *con cara de póquer*: Es tu cumpleaños, Dean. (Castiel * with poker face *: It's your birthday, Dean.)
And finally, since thanks to him and his manias for not throwing things made this possible, I included an old photo of my father. This is him, curiously the same age Dean was when the show started. Now, listen to this, we are from Argentina, literally on the other side of the continent, but we have family in Canada, and that was where my parents went on their honeymoon. This photo is from that trip, and while I'm pretty sure it's not the same, I like to think of it as Dean's Heaven bridge.
Dean: Aquí tienes. Come. (Here you have. Eat.)
Dean *murmura algo ininteligible*
fin~♥
Dean: ¿Así? (Like this?)
Castiel: Oh, ya veo.
—Seguramente en ese universo conservé mi antiguo recipiente —dijo Castiel y no pudo evitar que una pequeña sonrisa se formara en sus labios al recordarla. Dean abrió los ojos sorprendido —Su nombre era Clarice, es un antepasado de Jimmy Novak. —Dean pensó que eso explicaba el parecido, ojos azules, cabello oscuro, incluso la forma de su boca era similar—. Interesante. Tal vez la gran diferencia entre nuestros universos sea las decisiones que tomamos. Recuerdo haber sido tentado para conservar el recipiente, toda mi guarnición lo hizo, pero yo preferí regresar al Cielo. —Cas estaba comenzando a divagar, y aunque era interesante saber más sobre su vida pre-Winchester, Dean tenía temas a los que quería llegar, así que carraspeó para interrumpirlo.
—Debería entrar a buscarlo —dijo Cas mirando con desconfianza la grieta interdimensional que flotaba en el medio de la sala. Sam se refregó con cansancio los ojos antes de contestar.
—Yo... le dije que sí. Que hasta donde sabía, gran parte de la responsabilidad de tu caída es mía. Quise explicarle sobre los ángeles conspirando por el Apocalipsis, pero ella no estaba interesada en los detalles. Me preguntó entonces si tenías sentimientos.   —Castiel tragó saliva y se mantuvo en silencio. Dean se mojó los labios antes de continuar hablando —. Le-le dije que sí y ella... —Sentía la boca seca. Su corazón amenazaba con salir de su pecho, pero debía seguir adelante, ya había llegado hasta aquí. Dio un suspiro corto y se obligó a continuar —. Ella me preguntó si tus sentimientos... eran...
Dean played it outside, ducking in the trees when his ma and pa were sleeping. He would hide himself in the bushes, in the boughs, and in boxes. He was half-human, so he wasn't nearly as graceful as a real cat, but he could still land quietly. He'd play until the break of dawn before sneaking back in and curling up in his bed.
"Alright. Fine. That's two weeks without TV."
He was never one to trust people so easily, not even before meeting Ma and Pa, but there was something about this man that made Dean feel safe. He had a feeling that
Apparently Cas had a brother who looked exactly like him. He didn't smell nearly as good as Cas did, but he was equally beautiful. The car ride was silent. Tense. Another catboy sat next to him. Taller than him and lanky. He had dimpled cheeks and slanted hazel eyes. His eyes were soft and kind. He had dark brown shaggy hair that was a little rough and tangled, kind of like his, but it didn't make him look ugly like it did Dean. The twin brother—Jimmy, he learned—called the boy, Sam.
Dean looked up at the man in shock. The man was offering him a bed at
Once the contractions became so violent he spat up on himself, Cas had to press the call button again. Cas and the nurses had to turn him over to his side so he wouldn’t choke on his own puke. Shaking on the bed, Dean growled and swore at and threatened the alpha attempting to soothe him. He knew it was unfair to Cas, but at this point, he was too far gone. Mad from the pain of being ripped apart from the inside.
"Alright, hun,” she spoke softly, releasing his gown, "looks like you're fully dilated and effaced. The baby's not visible, so it's not time to start pushing yet." Dean nodded, tears blurring his eyes, as the nurses swarmed around him. His head pounded so Cas left to get him another cup of water.
he mentally added as he hung up. Dean headed back into the living room.
He starts handing out glasses of water, making a point to brush his fingers across a few biceps. Dean wanted to laugh at the way they all looked like a bunch of twelve-year-old alpha boys watching porn for the first time. Pathetic mewls and gasps fill the room as they squirm and try desperately to catch a glimpse of his panties from behind.
The claws of his forelimbs buried in the tree bark, its rough skin pressing into the balls of his human feet, Dean climbed towards the thick branch. Though the squirrel was concealed by leaves, he could smell the warm sweet blood rushing through her veins. Her guard was down. She was vulnerable.
“Please, help him” said one of the others. Even dirty, he was the most beautiful man Castiel had ever seen.
Then Castiel made the rounds. All was calm. He looked in Gabriels room. He was sound asleep, safe for now.
"Wow. I am idjit. We should have done this for years." Dean laughs and kisses Castiel back.
Castiel had gone the next day to the University. Given his all to the study.
Even if that wasn't the only reason for the war. He saw no good or honor fighting in the war. Or any war. But that was a thing he never said out loud.
“What can I do for you both?”
It was a humble man with a larger than usual house at the edge of the town. The two storey house was the man's home and workspace. All of the people in town knew and respected the man and his brother. If you needed help it was to them you turned in your hour of need.
Then the Empty returns. Right by Castiel's side.
"you promised that you would never die on me again"
Castiel smiles and has to let his son go. "Hello Dean." He took a step closer. "You woke me up. Thank you"
But no more apocalypse to stop. There was a balance to the world.
"Fuck Cas. I am so close"
"Yeah. But you are sleeping in my room tonight. I need you by my side"
He smiles. The entity will be so pissed. He walks closer to the humans. There are billions of them. Afraid. Hugging together. Screaming for their loved ones.
Castiel was meant to kill him.
"Castiel…" he feel how Alfie pets his hair. "Naomi is still in heaven. Please don't return. You can stay on Earth now if you want. You are free"
“take these clothes. Your name are now Castiel Milton" Castiel said to the nameless beauty "your brother is Gabriel Milton. These fine people I am sad to say are your slaves. You are going home. Sam needs to be in the wheelchair the whole time. He was wounded in the war. Understood? “
"Yes, Dean?"
"No, God doesn't care about deals or balance. He only wants to play with his writing, not caring about the world's he has already created. He has destroyed your peace." Castiel walked up to the being bearing his face. "Don't you want to make him pay for his crimes?"
First he would help the boy, Sam. Then… It was anyone's guess.
“what choice do we have? We need to be free.” said a woman carefully.
They had been watching Castiel casting the man out.
He gave the man his fine coat and hat. To easily convince people of this lie. Castiel turned to the runaways.
He just wanted to be free.
"Dean" why was it so hard to speak now?
Damn it, a siren!
He bought it all down then he got Sam to the wheelchair and got him in plain sight.
"Hello Claire" his smile was genuinely happy.
"Castiel" he sees Claire and her new family joining him.
"come to me, come swim to me in a forwarded motion. Lie with me in the arms of the ocean."
"Cas…" Dean is still wearing the jacket with Castiel's bloody handprint on. A visual reminder of the last time they spoke.
“Yes, a secret one”
Castiel took a pillow under his knees and kissed his way up Dean's left leg. Slowly reaching his goal.
"You haven't created us all"
Than the roaring sea
“oh, where he is going the fever will be the last of his problems. “
"You love him" one of Claire's sisters Patience says.
“Castiel, if this is the end for me. Please, I don’t want to suffer, I want a clean death. I know what a wound to the intestines does when it doesn't kill you right away. Please, brother. Please.”
”I do not know. It can go fast or it will take days.” Days of fever and agonizing pain. The only way Michael was speaking at that moment must be his will, that was keeping him up.
“When I grow a pair of new legs, brother.”
"What made you happy enough for the emptiness come and collect you"
Dean's moan was pure intoxication.
"Cas…"
Castiel waves his arm.
Not often, but once in a while he would freeze. The body he had in front of him would for a second become one of the victims of the room. Panic would run through him. But then any sound would bring him back to do his work.
“I need to go now, if I shall get the letter to the post in the next town.”
Sam just turned to Castiel.
"I can leave the ship in the next port, if this makes you and the crew uncomfortable." Castiel offered
When they returned to the hospital Alistair started to show Castiel the Room and his subjects. The poor prisoners of war, runaway slaves and others. Those who won't be missed. All the ones Alistair had for experiments.
”Will it take a long time?” Gabriel asked.
Together.
"there was a siren. I got us out of there. Please, wait for another half an hour, then I will release you all. Weirdly, no one argued with him.
Castiel's gravely voice travels over the field.
A first glance it seemed like a good room. There were only three pieces of furniture in there. A cabinet without doors, a big table and a tray-table. The cabinet had jars of preserved hearts and eyes. There were other preserved organs in the hospital. Things of teaching for doctors. But those in these jars Castiel knew who once had those eyes and how their screams had sounded when Dr Alistair had removed them.
“Of course,” he smiled, walking towards the pile of duvets to pick up the thickest one he can find, and then returns back next to Castiel, sitting on the log next to the man as he carefully drapes the quilt over his shivering body.
Dean groaned low in his throat. He could feel his insides being wrenched and twisted in his pelvis. He writhed under the covers, holding his stomach and panting. His boxers were soaked, and he felt an intense pressure in his lower back. He knew for sure this baby was coming out at some point today. Two days ago, he went in with contractions, thinking he was ready to deliver, but it was too early on. The OB told them he was only two centimeters dilated. He hoped to god they’d take him this time because he was pretty sure this pup was clawing her way out of him. Groaning and cringing in pain, he barely registered the sheets rustling as Cas stirred next to him.
Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he started to push again, his alpha at his side grabbing a leg. He let out a scream as the baby stretched him wide open with its massive head, damn near tearing him in half. As he continued to push, the OB checked the FHR monitor.
"Cuz he was bein' a dick!" she shouted.
Dean found Darren curled in a ball, holding his face, shrieking so loud his face was bright red. Dean kneeled down next to him. "Baby, what's wrong?" He pulled his son onto his lap and rubbed his back as the boy shrieked
"Darren, get up! Get your shoes. Let's go!"
"I said in a minute!" He set Darren on the counter and went to the freezer to grab an ice pack. Thankfully his boy didn't hit his head or anything. He wrapped it in a paper towel and asked him where it hurt. As he started to patch Darren up, he heard Jessie in the dining room hopping off the chair and running off into another room. He pouted.
"DADDY!" He shut his laptop and set it on the coffee table before heading into the dining room.
Dean smacks his hand against the back of Cas’s thigh hard enough to make the flesh quiver. His omega turns to the audience. Cas bites his lip as he eye-fucks one of the men. He must’ve winked at the guy because the man on the right end of the front row actually jizzes his pants and trips over his feet on his way out and down the hallway. Dean almost rolls his eyes when he sees the wet spot on the cushion. The alpha sitting next to the soiled chair loosens his tie and shifts a little to put some pressure on his full-blown hard-on. His eyes barely leave Cas’s toned legs as he croaks out an incoherent follow-up question.
The minute they got the OK, a female beta nurse escorted Dean to the birthing room.
"It smells sort of like sour milk."
"Hey! Get back in the dining room and..." With a resigned huff, he returned his attention to his toddler, who was now swinging his legs and sucking his thumb. When he was finished with Darren, he lifted the boy to his hip and took him back into his playroom. As the boy waddled to his car set, he heard a loud crash coming from the living room. "For pete's sake!"
Cas smirked. "You're not getting rid of me that easily, trust me. Hey, I'm gonna get us some water, okay? Be right back." Dean smiled and watched as Cas slid off of the bed and headed out into the hallway. As Dean reached for his phone to check his e-mail, he heard his door creak open. He looked up and saw Jessie standing in the doorway, wearing her pink nightgown with white floral patterns.
lifted a hand. But he appeared to be wiping his eyes. Then they were fixing on him.
The contractions came faster, and he squirmed, a whimper escaping his throat. Castiel wrapped a hand around his wrist, suggesting that he call in a nurse. Despite Dean weakly waving him off, telling him between sharp gasps and grunts that he didn't need to trouble the staff complaining about some contractions, Cas pressed the call button. The nurse entered the room and lifted his gown to check his cervix.
"It's just the placenta," the OB reassured him. He could barely see it between his legs, but he saw part of the heavy and bloody mass that had spilled out of him. When Dean got a closer look, he could see that there was a long cord attaching the placenta to the baby. "Am I done now..or is something else gonna come out of me?" He could feel some blood leaking out from between his legs. He watched as the OB used a clamp to cut the umbilical cord. Their daughter continued to howl as one of the nurses took her away to weigh her.
"Daddy, I wan' a snack."
As the men settle into their seats, Dean shoots his mate a quick text before sauntering towards his seat. If he could look in the mirror right now, he’d see the epitome of calm and collected. He wasn’t nervous one bit.
Cas struts into the room, wearing his little outfit—a black shoulderless long-sleeved dress with a ruffled skirt that stops shy above the curve of his round and perky ass cheeks and reveals a peek of his deep purple satin thongs. The spiky heels of his strapped open-toe pumps click against the wooden floor as he makes his way over to the front. Dean's lips curl into a smug grin as his houseguests (and soon-to-be backers for his project) turn their heads to ogle his mate. A few of them groan and whisper under their breaths, but Cas pretends not to acknowledge them as he bends over the desk to grab the papers. Dean doesn’t look over his shoulder; he knows he’d get distracted himself. The whiff of his omega’s mouthwatering scent, coupled with the glimpse of his slutty little outfit, is already starting to make his cock stir.
“Cas, baby?” Cas turns to Dean, pulling the lollipop out of his mouth slowly enough for it to drag down his lower lip.
"How do you feel?" Cas asked as he massaged the insides of Dean’s thighs. Legs open, his breaths uneven, the omega rolled his eyes.
All the other alphas, save for one, stutter out offers, clamoring over one another. Dean leans in to kiss the inside of his omega’s thigh.
Dean sat up with a grunt.
Like they were standing on campus, meeting for the first time.
Cas nodded and left the room. Dean laid heavily against the meager pillow the hospital had given him, caressing his swollen stomach, staring at the ceiling, trying to even out his breathing. The contraction and fetal heart rate monitors felt cool against his skin. He regretted not asking for the epidural; he had worried that the baby would take longer to come out. There was also the anxiety about being paralyzed or some shit. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but his belly was too fucking big, and he felt too exhausted. Just as he tried to change position again, water gushed out of him.
"Where are you coming from, Dean?"
, he wanted to add. Dean didn't want to disgust this kind man.
Before he had a chance to stop himself, the omega bit a beta nurse trying to clean the vomit off his gown so hard, it broke skin. The poor beta had to rush out of the room, nursing his bleeding wrist. Dean was pretty sure the kid wouldn't be stepping back into the room after that. The bedding was drenched in fluids. The omega was on the verge of tears, curling into fetal position as his alpha rubbed his back.
At the mention of Ma and Pa, his lip quivered and he shook his head. "They kick me out fer bein' naughty. They says I's a bad kitty. Real bad." He didn't know if he was hallucinating but he swore he could see the man fighting an urge to cry. Dean couldn't look at his face. He stifled a flinch as the man called
"How've you been feeling, any nausea or anything today?"
Dean was seven years old.
"M-my water...broke."
“You’re not going to fuck it up. You’ve raised your brother on your own since you were ten and look how he turned out. You’ve worked three jobs just to feed him, put him through school and keep a roof over your heads. You’ve worked your ass to protect him and look how he turned out. Look how far you’ve come.”
"You mean MY appointment?" Dean corrects as he assembles the burritos. "Tomorrow afternoon. You got a lecture tomorrow?"
“You know?! Really?! Are you pushing a fucking baby out and sweating and shitting yourself?!” Dean growled out. Cas swallowed guiltily and dropped his gaze. Dean immediately felt like shit. He drew in a breath from his nostrils.
"I need help with this question." He pulled a seat next to her. "Okay, what is the question?" As she read the question off to him and asked him, he found himself almost dozing off. He rubbed at his eyes and asked her to read the question again. He tried to help her work through the math problem, but whenever she got something wrong, she threw her pencil down and started crying. Dean rubbed at the temples of his forehead before getting up to grab himself an aspirin and a bottle of water. Next thing he knew, there was a loud thud from the playroom, followed by wailing. He jogged into the playroom, leaving Jessie in the dining room, crying hysterically over a mess of crumpled leaflets.
The baby cooed and reached for her Papa’s face. Dean leaned against the bed, giving his mate and child a fond, sleepy smile before drifting into a dreamless sleep.
Darren wailed from all the way in the living room as Dean tried to clean up the spilled gummy bears. Cas and Dean's two-and-a-half-year-old son had decided to rip open a bag of gummy bears and dump it all over the floor after asking for—no,
"DADDY! I NEED HELP WITH MY HOMEWOOORRRRK!"
Dean shrugged. "I sleep on a tree. Iss kinda comfy sometimes, even though it can get cold at night. The squirrels are kinda nice sometimes, but they get scared of me."
"Shit, dude. You stink."
"I fawwed dowwnnn!  I was gon' go pwayin' wif my toys an-an-an' I fawwed doooowwwwwwn!" Dean gathered his boy into his arms and took him into the kitchen to get an ice pack.
Cas takes a younger alpha to the side and flirts with him. The alpha trips over his words trying to flirt back as the sexy little twink bats those big blue eyes at him and unbuttons his shirt to play his fingers over his chest hairs. The man stutters, breath hitching between words, and eventually gets flustered. Cas takes pity on him and saunters off after pressing a chaste kiss to his cheek, leaving the man rooted to the spot with his jaw open and face flushed. Benny has to guide all of the dazed and horny alphas out of the mansion. The office, the halls, and the foyer reek of lust, sweat, drool and alpha spunk. Cas inches towards Dean and pulls him in for a deep and languid kiss. The alpha grabs his angel’s hips and pulls him closer to deepen the kiss. When they finally pull away, Dean mumbles, “You did good today, baby,” as hooks his hands under his mate’s ass and squeezes. Cas drags his tongue over the alpha’s bottom lip.
A few minutes later, they both had large burgers sitting in front of them. Dean had seen hamburgers before. Ma and Pa would sometimes bring home bags from a fast food restaurant. When they were feeling generous enough, they tossed him a few fries, maybe a piece of the patty. It wasn't enough, but he was thankful he at least got food. Dean reached for his burger, tentative at first, unsure as to rather it'd be polite to start eating or not. But the man nodded, giving him the go-ahead. Dean just grabbed the burger and tore into it. The meat was warm and moist and tasty. It wasn't as bloody as he was used to, but the flavor was almost addictive. He didn't realize how sloppy and ungraceful he was being until he saw how Cas was watching him with a strange look on his face.
"Of course I have something to worry about, Cas! Do you think I don't know about how she's always giggling and twirling her hair and putting her hands all over you?"
..." Cas sprung out of bed and walked hastily to the Dean’s side.
"Fuck, I gotta take another dump. Help me up, will ya?"
Dean found himself perched on the edge of a public bathroom sink while Cast-tee-el cleaned him up. People looked at him in disgust, and he felt self-conscious as usual. He shrank against
An alpha chokes out a shaky half-whimper-half-sob. Another speaks up, stuttering, flushed in the face as he coughs dryly between almost every word. A couple other men down their waters, each of them no doubt imagining his own hand cupping and squeezing Cas’s supple ass until he was dripping wet and soaking his crotch.
"Thank you, Alpha. You always know what to say." Cas smiled and turned to bury his nose in his hair.
She pulled the curtains closed and stepped outside while he changed into the ever-so-stylish hospital gown. Part of him wanted to push his mate out of the room, but he was too tired, and he knew he'd lose his shit without his alpha by his side.
Darren just screamed louder. With a huff, Dean marched out of the room and into the laundry room. He hoisted himself onto the washing machine and pulled the door closed.
Cas smiled. "You already make me happy."
At that comment, Cas smirks and sways his ass teasingly, slightly curving his back as he stretches out to pick up one last piece of paper far away from him. One man seated at the far left of the back row unzips his pants with shaking hands and pulls his dick out. He leans back and parts his legs slightly to stroke himself.
Dean didn’t even know he started to cry until his eyes felt wet and his shoulders shook. He turned to look at Cas through his tears.
Cas nodded.
Only two men in the back manage to sober and challenge some of the points he’s made. As Dean answers the question, Cas pretends to be bored and gets up to grab some candy from the bottom drawer of the desk. He bends over deeply and starts rummaging through the drawer. The two men are drawn towards the full and unfiltered view of the omega’s ass and the way the thongs disappears into the cleft. Dean manages to keep himself from turning his head. He watches the investors fidget in their seats and lick their lips, hungrily eyeing his mate’s ass. A normal alpha would be growling and snapping at other alphas staring at his mate, but all Dean can feel is the swell of pride in his chest. His little blue-eyed minx graces himself onto his alpha’s lap and unwraps the candy as he swings one leg over the other. Dean brings a hand to Cas’s thigh and strokes it as his mate parts his lips to slide the cherry red lollipop into his mouth and suck. Not loud enough to be obnoxious or obvious, but suggestively enough to strengthen the stench of alpha arousal.
"You know, Dean. You can call me Cas or Cassie if you like. I know my name can be a mouthful." Dean nodded eagerly and swallowed loudly before letting out a burp so loud he could feel it in his bones. Instead of being disgusted with him, Cas—or, Mister Cas—chuckled. It was such a beautiful sound, it made Dean shiver. He blushed and covered his mouth.
"Actually, daddy, can I stay with you? For a few minutes?" Dean could feel his heart melting in his chest, becoming a warm thick liquid caressing his insides as it glided over every bone in his body and filled the tips of fingers and toes. By the time Cas had entered the room, Jessie and Dean were cuddled into each other, eyes closed, Dean's strong arms wrapped around her frail little body. Cas set the glasses down on the nightstand and climbed into bed. He gave his omega and daughter a kiss before switching the light off and curling into bed.
The bed dipped next to him, pulling him back into the real world. Dean shifted over and watched the muscles on his Alpha's back flex as he bent to pull his shoes off. Cas was an angel. A divine being. Beautiful both inside and outside. And Dean sure as hell didn't deserve him.
"Fine! Then you're not getting them!"
Cas turned to smile softly at him.
“You want me to get you a drink, handsome?” Cas leans into him,  his fingers running up and down the back of the man’s neck. The man shifts to put some pressure on his dick and lets out a shaky breath, nodding fervently. Cas winks at him and lightly drags his fingers across man’s shoulders as he saunters past him. The man shudders again and turns his head to watch his ass, licking his lips and moaning. The alpha who had started jerking himself off reenters the room and turns his head to stare at Cas’s ass as the omega turns a corner, sucking in a sharp breath and biting his lip hard. He stumbles over one of his colleagues’ feet and barely catches himself. Dean bites back laughter.
"She’s beautiful,” Cas mused, stretching his arms out. “May I?"
"Welcome to the world, Emma Marie Novak-Winchester." He pulled her close to him and nuzzled her head. He cooed at her, Cas by his side. Emma slowly started to blink and looked at him with beady green eyes. His breasts started to feel tender. He brought his nipple to her mouth and watched as she latched and suckled.
"Dean?"
He kept pushing, straining almost every muscle in his body, until the contractions stopped, so they had to take a break. The alpha stood at the foot of the bed, looking anxious and faint. Dean was shocked his mate even lasted as long as he did. It wasn’t very often he saw his mate lose his composure. An omega nurse had to guide him to sit on a chair and get him a cup of water. She also had to refill Dean’s cup because his mouth was dry again and his throat was hoarse. A couple of nurses tried to help him change positions a couple of times, trying to "ease his discomfort." Dean growled at that comment and snapped at them. It wasn't for another four minutes until another contraction hit and he had to push again. With a yowl, he strained and pushed the baby further down his canal.
Cas leans in to whisper into Dean’s ear. He swings his leg and “accidentally” knocks down a stack of folders. He slides off of Dean’s lap and stands. “I’m sorry, Daddy. I’ll pick it up.” He sinks to his knees and crawls on the floor. The alphas bend forward and crane their necks to get a peak of his ass. Cas turns to give them a full view and gathers his papers. Dean hears a few soft groans and hissed
followed by booming laughter and,
Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean shook his head and nudged his husband's side. "You're such a fucking sap."
"What do you like to eat?"
for the last few nights. Plus, they were out of the good coffee, so Dean had to settle for crappy insta-coffee.
When evening came, the sound of the front door opening wasn't enough to appease Dean's mood. Darren, who was just on the floor playing with his transformers, and Jessie, who was just scribbling in one of her notebooks, dropped what they were doing and barreled over to latch themselves around Cas's legs. Cas looked down and smiled.
(Cas: No estoy aquí para servirte, Dean.)
Nota: aún está sin completar, llevará una campera de cuero y accesorios, pero no podía esperar para presentarla: Meg! (sisi, Meg Masters, pero en gatito X3 )

Que Dean y Cas se vayan de cacería tiene sus pros y sus contras.
Epilogo
. Pero ella dijo que era la misma gracia. Dijo que podía servir para ayudarte a sanar tus alas. Sólo se sacó un poco, pero como ella jamás cayó y Metatrón nunca lanzó el hechizo allí, su gracia está completa —explicó Dean mientras Cas destapaba la botella.
Dean: El mejor cumpleaños de todos. (The best birthday ever.)
Meg: Cas no está aquí. Rasca mi espalda!
Castiel: Dean... ¿No es mas simple llamar a Crowley por teléfono? (Dean ... Is not it simpler to call Crowley by phone?)
20-Home (Hogar)
Sam: Está bien, Cas.
—Imbécil —dijo Sam con una sonrisa, dándole un empujoncito en el hombro.
Castiel: te amo ~ ♥ (I love you~♥)

Dean: Al menos prueba el tocino ;) ;)  (At least try the bacon ;);) )

Dean: Give me that *he takes the book from his hands and lies on his lap*. That's better.
*Meg tiene permiso de tomar su forma "humana".
—¡Hazlo ya! —lo animó Dean obligándolo a levantar la botella nuevamente. Cas rió y obedeció. Cuando el vidrio tocó su labio inferior, una hebra de luz se deslizó en una curva entrando por su boca. Dean se apartó varios pasos y se protegió los ojos con el brazo, todo Castiel había comenzado a brillar. La energía que desprendió casi tira a Dean al suelo. Las cacerolas, platos y tazas volaron por los aires y el estruendo fue terrible. Cuando la luz se disipó, Cas llamó a Dean por su nombre. Éste miró al ángel frente a él, los ojos de Castiel aún brillaban y las sombras de sus enormes alas se proyectaban en las paredes. Enormes y saludables alas de ángel.
"These...contractions...are … killing me, and I," He winces again, "really...
“Okay, it looks like the head’s fully out!" a nurse called. He pushed again until the baby practically slithered out of him. Dean could hear a shrill wail as the nurse positioned his hands under the baby and guided her out. The omega pushed a heavy sigh of relief as he sagged against the pillow, only to feel more contractions. That strong impulse to push returned. He worried he would shit the bed right there.
They continued to eat in silence. Dean wondered if Cas had someone. He didn't smell mated. But Cas was a human, a pure human; wondering such things about him was inappropriate. Dean was grateful the man took it upon himself to feed him, even though he didn't have to. Still he wondered. As handsome Cas was, he had anyone falling at his feet, tripping over their feet to impress him. He couldn't possibly be single. The thought inspired a pang of jealousy in his chest. He couldn't understand why.
Dean scoffed.
"Why didn't you just listen to music on Alexa?" Dean rolls his eyes and wipes his hand on his jeans.
"Dean, you're worth it. Every time. And you're my whole world." Dean grimaced.
“Excuse me,” Dean speaks up. The man looks up, embarrassment coloring his cheeks. With a smirk and a raised brow, Dean says, “You might wanna go to the bathroom to do that.” Still gripping his dick, which was now rock hard, purpling and weeping at the tip, the man hops out of his seat and hastily hobbles towards the door. Cas finishes cleaning up Dean’s mess and is now making his way over to an investor seated in the back row and next to the door. He rests a hand on the man’s shoulder. The man is looking up at him, jaw hung open, cock no doubt throbbing in his slacks, and pretty much starts to hyperventilate at this point.
Darren whined and started to stomp his feet. "No, daddy, I wan' gummy beawwwwws!"
"Hey, Emma. It's papa."
The eight investors trickle into Dean’s home office, each wearing their five-figure-priced suits. The space is more than enough to accommodate them all. He’d asked Benny to set up eight chairs on the other side of the room, four to each row. Dean even made sure to have them arranged in a way that made every alpha visible. The desk and swivel chair had been pushed against the back wall. It’s the perfect setting for what he has planned for his guests.
"Noooooo!"
"Like four….minutes, now take me to the...
After a while, Cas has grown accustomed to Dean's territorial nature and his jealousy issues. Dean typically isn't the jealous type; he's always been trusting, easy-going, and pretty laid back.  However, since Dean got pregnant, he had become territorial and irrationally jealous. At this point, Dean is over 3 months along.
"Of course. I'll be in there in about fifteen minutes."
Cas smiled and shook his head with a smile. He had the face of an angel, or a god. There was no way this god of a man would even want Dean. He was an abomination. A mutation. Though Cas never looked at him with disgust, he was sure he would eventually be disgusted and reject him.
"I'm sorry, baby. I am..but…” he gulped, “I’m just so scared. And you’re sitting here and you’re...I’m gonna mess it up, Cas. With this baby just stuck in my ass right now, it just...it feels too real. Like...I’m really gonna fuck it up, Cas.” Cas shook his head.
Dean's perspective of the first part, "Meet the Catboys." You can read this as a stand alone.
"Dean, I'm Castiel."
"Feet off the table!" Dean snaps. Jimmy blushes and quickly sits up. "Dinner's ready. Can you help set the table?" Jimmy sighs heavily.
"I do what I can to keep you happy."
"Dean caught me on the phone again." Jimmy scoffs.
“When she’s finished.”
"Hey, Dean. You looked awfully upset when I came home. What's wrong?" Dean pressed his tongue between his teeth. He couldn't be a burden to Cas. Not anymore. It wasn't until he felt Cas brushing a thumb against his cheek that he realized he was crying. Sobs broke out, punctuated with hiccups, and then bubbled out until they came pouring like a waterfall. Cas encircled Dean and pulled him to his shoulder. Dean turned to press his nose to Cas's scenting gland, trying to inhale Alpha's scent.
"You know what, Cas? Why don't you just shut the fu—" Dean's words were cut off by a yelp when another contraction hit. With a hissed curse, Cas—
He got up and headed over to snatch the phone off its cradle. He checked the caller ID. It was Jessie's school.
"Dean? Darling? What's going on? What's happening?"
them. Dean should've known; Darren had a habit of dumping his snacks on the floor for no apparent reason other than to get on Dean's nerves. He was thankful that Jessie, Darren's older sister, had gone to school. He didn't know if he could handle another day of having to chase the kids around the house all while trying to keep the house clean, cook food, and study for his exams. Dean's kneecaps ached as they pressed into the hardwood floor. His head was pounding. He barely got enough sleep last night—hell, he hadn't slept at
The alpha palming himself yelps and clambers out of his seat, grabbing his hard and most-likely-weeping dick as he hobbles out of the room. Cas pulls the lollipop out with a loud pop, and his lips shine and drip with his saliva.
Dean laid on his back and stared dumbly at the ceiling. For a moment, he wasn't a person. He didn't have a body. Not a whisper of a thought, not a flicker of a memory. not a feeling in his nerves, not a beat of a heart. He wasn't asleep, and he wasn't awake; he was just nowhere. As close to death as you can possibly get. He drifted in the still air like a blind, numb, and deaf ghost. Being everywhere and nowhere.
He proceeds to describe the model of the project when Cas returns, carrying a silver tray of ice-cold glasses of water and a pitcher at the center. Like the good little omega he is, he had changed his outfit. Now he’s donning a sheer lace robe draped over a see-through lavender chemise. Underneath, he wore an expensive black bustier and a matching pair of thongs.
"But I hungyyyy!"
-----
The smell of petrichor and damp grass mixed with sweet honey and carnations.
Another contraction jolted him, punching out a sharp gasp.  "I feel..like there is one of those..vice-y thingies in me, like...from those factories in movies, that crush metal and shit, those..." Dean sucked in another breath. Cas stroked his hair and shushed him.
"Gee, well...glad to know I stink. Not like 'm havin’ a pupper‘nythin’."
"Yes, baby?"
"Fuck...I'm friggin' hungry, man! Will you go—" he hisses, "get some more ice chips?"
"Whatcha making, sweetie?"
“T-t-to co-considerash-sideration…” the speaking alpha stammers out dryly. He clears his throat. Cas sidles up behind him. The alpha loses his train of thought again as Cas straddles his lap and rubs that shapely ass against his hard cock. The man’s breath hitches in his throat. Cas caresses his cheek and leans in to brush those soft lips against the corner of his mouth. The investor moans and tries to roll his hips to grind him. Cas surges forward to take the man’s lips between his own. Dean gets a good view of Cas’s tongue delving into the man’s mouth, hears their tongues clicking and smacking together. Cas slides his hands down to fist the collar and pull him closer. The alpha groans desperately as he bucks his hips up desperate for friction on his hard cock. His chubby hands rest on the tops of the omega's thick thighs and wanders towards his ass. Cas catches his wrists just short of the crease between his hips and thighs.
"It's alright, baby. It's alright. It will be alright."
Cas looked away sheepishly. "Sorry." The corner of Dean's mouth quirked into a weak smile.
Dean panicked. Cas squeezed his hand tighter. “It’s okay, baby, it's normal. Just keep pushing.” Dean could feel his own heart quivering in his chest as he clenched harder. His body was rigid and tense, like at some point, some part of his body would just snap.
“Cas, I can’t do this, man,” he sobbed out. “I just can’t.”
actually means. You've done nothing to make her hate you."
"What's going on?"
"Hey, I am not complaining, okay?”
“Sorry,” Cas starts, “but this,” Dean, along with the other alphas, chokes as the cellulite ripple under the skin when he claps the investor’s hands over himself, “is for investors only.” He leaves another lingering kiss on the man’s lips before pushing the man’s hands off of him and getting up slowly to strut back to Dean. Dean nods approvingly at his omega and fondles his backside. The man his mate had just kissed sits there, slack-jawed, lips swollen and the front of his pants completely soaked and plastered to his lap. The poor bastard looks like he’s about to cry or pass out.
Cas arrives forty minutes later with the requested order and sets his things on the counter. "Dean, I'm home!" he calls out as he sheds his coat. When he sees movement behind the open pantry doors he steps around the corner to investigate.
“You’ve got your own auto shop, a booming business. Your customers love and trust you. You’ve built a family, and you’ve held it together. When Ellen lost her husband, you helped get her back on her feet. When Charlie was in the hospital after her accident, you nursed her back to health.” Cas swallowed.
"Traffic, Dean. You know it exists, right?" Dean groans as he hops onto the counter and starts in on his nuggets.
Lying on a fuzzy blanket on the hood of Dean's car, just looking into the night sky talking about nothing.
"How's your food?" Castiel asked.
Dean growls.
"Jessie, do you want me to ground you again? Because I will." She didn't answer; she just stared at her knees. Dean let out a resigned sigh.
“Of course, Alpha.” Cas grabs Dean’s tie and pulls him into a ravenous and filthy kiss. The alpha doesn’t miss the sharp intakes of breath or the little whines as Cas slips his tongue between Dean’s lips. Their lips smack, and their tongues click and clack as they wrestle each other. They pull from each other with a loud pop that makes an alpha cough to hide a desperate whimper. Cas stands in one smooth and fluid moment and struts out of the room, tossing the lollipop in the trash can near the door, entrancing everyone with the swing of his hips and the subtle jiggle of his ass. All the alphas in the room damn near break their necks, straining to get another good look, hissing and biting their lips hard, muttering curses under their breath.
"No. I already gave you a snack and you dumped it all over the floor."
"I'm sorry about this. You come home from a long day of work and then have to put up with my bullshit." Dean let out a self-deprecating chuckle. Cas smiled.
The men stare at Cas’s mouth, transfixed as he pulls the lollipop out of his mouth and sweeps his tongue over the syrup and spit dripping down his lip before drawing it back in and darting his tongue back out to swirl it around. Some of the alphas groan. One alpha in the back even palms himself, trying (and failing miserably) to be subtle about it as he imagines his dick being in place of that piece of candy. Dean maintains his composure, fully immune to his omega’s seductiveness. Cas drags the lollipop up his bottom lip and lasciviously swishes his tongue around it before taking it back into his mouth and closing his lips around the base. He gives it a hard suck and lets out an obscene moan as his eyes flutter closed.
"Looks like you're ready to push again, huh, daddy?"
Four hours had passed. Dean had kept changing positions—on his hands and knees, his side, polar bear position, just twisting around like a human origami. He had to get up to walk around and squat a few times while Cas stood by his side, supporting his weight despite Dean’s protests. Dean’s friends and family had come in to pay him a visit—Charlie, Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Garth, Jody, Donna, Kevin, Adam and Sam.
Dean looked up and nodded. “That’d be real nice. Thank you, Sir.”
"Congratulations, daddy," a nurse said, holding his baby, "it's a girl."
He felt disappointed in himself; before he met Ma and Pa, he excelled at hunting. He knew how to survive on his own. Now, three days after being thrown out of the house, he couldn't even move a muscle stalking prey without feeling that spike of anxiety that he'd get caught. Ma and Pa had made sure to beat that habit out of him. He remembered the time he brought a bird he had hunted into the house. He shuddered hard at the memory. "
Then the man kicked the car with a growl and a curse. Dean shrank back. Anxiety seized him once again. He couldn't get hurt. Not again. Still, he watched the man through the bushes, hoping to go unnoticed. The man sagged against his car and sunk to the ground, pulling his knees to his chest. He looked small. Vulnerable. A feeling Dean knew all too well. The strange man cast his eyes into the forest longingly. His pink lips stretched into a nostalgic smile. His smell grew sweeter, softer. Dean slowly peaked from behind the bushes to watch him, taking in the man's beauty. His eyes were strikingly blue. It reminded Dean of the high noon sky that hung above him like a large canvas as he laid in the grass after a good hunt, his belly full with warm and bloody flesh.
"Smells delicious." Dean chuckles, and Jimmy gives him another peck on the cheek and then heads off into the living room.
"When's our next doctor's appointment?"
"Okay, just watch your step."
"Hey, babies! How are my favorite little ones?" Jessie and Darren babbled excitedly at Cas as he scooped them up to cover their faces in goofy kisses. Dean stared at the screen of his computer, numb, mentally and physically drained. There was no way he could pass his exams. There was no way he can graduate this course. Why did he even bother trying? He could hear his father's voice again.
He was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached. He tried pulling more oxygen into his lungs and exhaling. He clenched his muscles harder. He was grateful he ate those little snacks that Cas kept making him; he knew he wouldn’t be able to keep anything down at this point. Cas kept a firm hand around his wrist while his other was rubbing circles over his lower back.
Dean knew the man wanted to say something more. He looked down at his feet and rubbed at his arms, not knowing what to say.
“Glad you asked.” He smells his omega’s candy-sweet and spicy scent before he sees him standing at the doorway. “Darling, do you mind passing out the packets?” He gestures towards the stack of binders on the desk.
Dean watched from the backseat as Jimmy kept glancing at Castiel. It was strange, the way he looked at him. With longing, with sadness, and a million other emotions. Those blue eyes went up to look at Dean and Sam. Dean blushed a little bit as the man admired him.
"Look, babe, you..gotta go..faster than that...because ri’now…” he gasped, “ I‘m two seconds...away from…” he sucked in another sharp breath, “shittin’ myself."
"Babe, are you alright? What's going on?" His voice was deep and rough with sleep. Clenching his jaw, the omega tried to push himself upright, barely suppressing a whimper.
"Well, you know what, Jess? Life's not fair!" Dean turned to walk away.
Dean watches as Cas continues to text his family. Jimmy jogs up the stairs and waltzes into the room. He typically spends two hours in his study working, so the fact that he returns to the bedroom so shortly surprises Dean. He crawls next to Dean in the bed with his book and kisses Dean's cheek.
"You're right." He kisses Cas again. "I'm sorry for snapping." Cas smiles softly and slides his hands down to Dean's hips before pressing their groins together. He backs Dean into the counter and then pulls him in for a deep, tongue-teeth kiss. Cas feels his pants start to tighten around his crotch as his dick hardens. Dean moans softly when Cas massages his ass cheeks through his jeans. The alpha feels dampness against his palm when he runs his hand over the cleft of his omega's ass as the latter slicks himself. The scent of arousal is heavy in the air, so sharp you can taste it on your tongue. Cas grabs Dean's legs and hoists him up. The omega wraps his legs around Dean's waist and allows himself to be deposited onto the counter. Dean whines then breaks the kiss briefly to reach down and unbutton Cas's jeans. Cas pushes his mate's legs open and ravages his mouth with his tongue. Dean whimpers and desperately paws at Cas's shirt. Cas breaks the kiss to strip himself to his underwear. Dean does the same, scrambling all over the counter, desperate and soaking wet, until he is buck naked. Cas sweeps Dean off of the counter and carries him into the living room.
Just as the branch was at arms length, a twig behind him snapped loudly. He flinched violently. A million thoughts tumbled into his mind, crashing into the walls until the cranium splintered.
"What the fu..."
"It's an e-mail from my agent."
“Yes, Alpha?” He says, giving Dean a sweet smile.
"Hey! Watch your mouth!" The girl crossed her arms and stared at her feet dangling at the edge of the couch.
Once Dean realized the man was looking in his direction, he squeaked and ducked back into the bushes. The man's gravelly voice called out to him. Dean could hear the gravel shifting beneath heavy feet as he approached.
l understood his pain. Almost like he had experienced it himself. Dean was curious as to what happened in the past. Castee-ee-ell had scrubbed him as clean as he could without being too vigorous and then dried him off with a paper towel before removing his jacket and wrapping it around Dean to cover him up. It was that moment when Dean realized he had been naked the whole time. It usually didn't strike him much, especially when some humans leered at him, even if it did make him a tad queasy. Maybe it was a mistake, letting Cast-tee-ell bring him here. Instead of protesting, he found himself automatically trusting the man as he led him to a booth.
