“Cap and Iron Man aren’t friends,” says some kid, cutting Miles off. “They hate each other. Why’re you saying they are friends?”
“What?”
But it shouldn’t be weird, right? Like, they’re just friends. There’s nothing weird about noticing how many gloved hands Steve seems to have and how amazing it is to watch Steve swing himself onto Miles’ desk from the door and—
Tears threaten to spill through his eyelids again. Tony distracts himself by closing off Humpty Dumpty with a flourish, his fingers manically following one key after another as the song breaks into a furious crescendo. He almost crushes Steve’s fingers in the process.
Tony should feel at home here, surrounded by the riches he grew up with. But watching Steve squirm in his seat, watching Steve stare down his cutlery like it’s going to stab him in the eye, makes him feel so goddamn uncomfortable.
Tony shrugged his shoulders, as if he didn’t just hand all of Steve’s wishes on a silver platter. “I mean, why not? I don’t see you as Cap. I see you as Steve. You see me as a dumbass behind—”
“As much as we would all love to be regaled by your tale, Thor, I think ‘tis best Anthony and I take our leave.” She grins. “Come, Man of Iron! I have much to show you. Do not fret. I will return your comrade soon.”
“It worked, didn’t it?”
“I don’t—”
This time, someone clearing their throat jolts them back to reality. Fortunately, this time, neither of them end up tumbling to the ground.
After Miles and Kamala are done bingeing the whole series, Kamala introduces Miles to another animated series featuring Bambi-eyed Tony and chunky Steve and then a movie where ugly Steve and ugly Tony flirt with each other for seventy-one minutes. And don’t get Tony started on the awkward reenactments Miles and Kamala force upon Miles’ toys. Embracing Steve was like embracing a brick wall. Times ten.
Steve's eyelids flutter, gaping like a fish. Tony would've found it hilarious if his heart isn't tearing itself to pieces.
He hears the sound of a fork stabbing something.
“Of course you should,” Tony says, sounding insincerely confident. “When have I ever steered you wrong?'
As expected, JARVIS does as he’s told, leaving Tony in silence for the rest of his ride down to the communal room, which is surprisingly empty.
“Hey, you cheated yesterday.”
Carol grins, pulling her arm away. “Don’t worry, Stark. We’ll take it from here.”
“I know.”
“But you kissed her,” Steve says, feeling more lost than he’s ever felt.
“You know, I made that for you. I wanted to… I was supposed to give that to you on Monday.”
“I’m glad. New York never deserved him.”
Besides, he wasn’t,
Thor barks at that. “Nay, friend. I was hoping you will accept my challenge.”
Steve feels like he’s being put on trial.
“Thought you were asleep,” Tony asks, glancing behind his shoulder.
Natasha arches an eyebrow.
“But—”
She hops to her feet, leaning to press her lips onto the side of his temple. “Just think about it.”
He scoffs, shaking his head. “Nah. No way. Not even if you pay me a million bucks. Which I don't need but—”
When Bucky and Sam finally,
“Endgame is a terrible movie,” Tony remarks, waving his hand in dismissal.
“You’re terrible,” he breathes out when their friends make a beeline for the elevator.
“Do you—”
“—but then Johnny brought it up and you know Johnny, he can be full of shit—”
MODOK should've just finished him off. It would've been kinder. So much better.
Hell, even Kamala is cheering along. Tony could never say no to Kamala.
Every time Steve excuses himself to his floor for a moment, it’s like a stab to the heart. It makes sense that Steve would want time away from Tony. It makes sense that Steve couldn’t, wouldn’t love Tony the way he wants him to.
“Nuh-uh. You’re not leaving just yet,” Kate interrupts, barring his escape. “Clint and I need you to referee.”
“Bisexual,” Steve affirms.
“Nope. Trust me. You do
After all, he’s Tony Stark. And Tony Stark always makes sure he has a safety net installed in his armor for emergencies, so it wouldn’t be out of commission before the building decided to collapse onto itself.
The fire in Storm’s eyes diminishes at that, his posture relaxing. Steve’s thankful. Pepper and SHIELD will kill him for trying to fistfight the Human Torch on the helipad of Avengers' Tower.
Carol nods, crossing her arms. “What? Surprised we haven’t choked each other out?”
Once again, Steve has that weird look on his face. “Yeah?”
Tony wouldn’t have believed him if Steve hadn’t flashed him the most sincere smile ever.
Steve smiles ruefully. “Yeah. Finding a piano was difficult when you’re on the road and away from the city very often. But it was fun when I could. I remember the first time I did it. Had to convince myself I didn’t just dream up the last couple of minutes or the applause.”
Tony nods, his gaze drifting down to his boots. “You’ve asked me. To sit with you all the time.”
Unless— Unless—
As if by magic, some of the grogginess Tony feels dissipates. He cracks an eyelid open, meeting a pair of perfectly blue eyes and a perfectly cheery smile and a big dopey mug. It's a sight Tony never, ever wants to be greeted with this early in the night.
How could’ve he been so stupid? How could he have fallen for Steve? For Captain America? It was supposed to be just no-strings-attached, sex. Feelings weren't supposed to be involved. Ever.
Steve’s heart almost stops. His fingers clench around the edge of the countertop.
Tony’s phone is overwhelmed with messages and missed calls. His inbox is full of lengthy emails. The press is divided. So is the board.
“It must’ve been amazing,” Tony remarks.
Stupid,
, he thinks before his eyelids flutter shut and lets the void take him.
. It’s only that when they do pause for Steve to catch his breath, Tony realizes he’s in Steve’s lap, his thighs clamping Steve in place and his cape pooling at his feet.
Steve huffs, lightly shoving Tony’s shoulder. Once again, Tony misses the next note.
“I didn’t think I could have you,” Tony whispers. “I didn’t think you felt the same way.”
“Fuck, did you really forget?” Clint gestures around him. “Like didn’t you realize why you’re the only one left?”
“And now?”
“Carol and Maria do,” Steve points out.
“A geeky dork.”
“Language.”
Steve almost trips over his own foot.
Steve will always regret not taking Tony’s offer to disappear.
It’s one of the best nights of Steve’s life.
“What?” Tony asks, feigning innocence. “You’re the one who stopped.”
Tony blinks, his eyes drifting to the ceiling. “My heart broke.”
going to hang out with all of the Avengers while under a truth spell again. The only consolation about that whole debacle was that Tony was at a business conference in Tokyo that week.
intelligent, compassionate, and cunning. These are traits she and Tony definitely have in common. It's no surprise Bruce picked her.
Steve should duck back in the back, demand his mother serve Tony while he completes his little freak-out alone. But of course, like the idiot he is, he blurts out, “It’s you,” instead.
Oh god.
“You’re not just people.”
He warms up with a couple of simple tunes before transitioning to any song he could recall from the top of his head. He bounces between more difficult classical pieces with practiced ease, occasionally adding a more modern tune or two. Schubert’s Ave Maria to Billie Joel’s Piano Man. Debussy’s Clair de Lune to The Beatles’ Blackbird.
Steve doesn’t look convinced at that. With an eye roll, Tony scoots to one end of the stool. “I really don’t mind, Steve,” he says, patting the empty space next to him. “Really. Lights, J.”
“This can’t wait,” she interrupts, halting him in place. “It’s SHIELD business.”
Storm’s notoriously known for being a huge flirt. Hell, Steve’s seen him in action more times than he should. But never with a man.
Sometimes he wonders what he did wrong to land himself in this situation, in this era. Not wholeheartedly because the thought of not meeting Tony is just ab—
“Oh. Uh, thanks.”
“I tried to remind you, sir,” JARVIS says dryly, “but you had me on mute.”
“Eager to head back, are we?” Tony asks. He sounds like he’s teasing but the little edge in his tone that unsettles Steve.
“Okay, fine. He won’t,” Tony admits. “Steve’s way too nice for that. But he’ll definitely me those eyes. You know the ones he has on every time he looks super guilty? And fuck, he’s going to pity me. Goddamn it, Nat. This is going to be super embarrassing. I should’ve planted mistletoe instead.”
Natasha breaks into a Cheshire grin. “No trust—”
“Yeah, well. You did. So. Life’s weird like that sometimes,” Tony holds out the bag of gummies. “How did you learn to play? Your ma?”
“We both know you don’t think that,” Steve replies. “Tony Stark to you is a monster. Iron Man is a hero. A tin can. But you’re wrong. You’re Tony Stark and Iron Man and they’re both two of the most amazing people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. And whatever you say won’t change that.”
“Nothing,” Hank says shortly.
“Well, after your birthday. I’d propose—”
“C’mon, Carol—”
He’s well-aware of what Hank’s talking about, having chanced upon them on Howard’s satellite. Unsurprising considering their fractured relationship back then.
They break apart after what feels like an eternity. Steve doesn’t let him go far, resting his forehead against his.
“Only ‘cause you go overboard every single time,” Tony retorts.
The real Tony looks as lonely and lost as painting-him.
There are faint circles under Steve’s eyes, the weariness clearer in the blue. His hair’s a little wild, and his shoulders a little slumped, a little defeated. Tony feels the same way.
“There you are!”
“No! ‘Course not.”
Wait, what?
“Um, hello? You’ve been a wreck since he died and a bigger one since you found out he’s alive. Excuse me for thinking that way.”
Steve closes his eyes. “I don’t know why I didn’t know either.”
Being miles away from home isn’t so bad sometimes. Steve has Bucky and Sam as friends. They keep him grounded. Light. Distracted from his aching heart.
He doesn’t need to give Cap another reason to hate him, another reason to get himself in trouble.
Tony freezes. “Really?”
“I thought you were dead,” Tony begins quietly. “I thought— I looked everywhere for you. Called in so many favors. Asked everyone I could think of. I got a hold of some records. None of the Steve Rogers that enlisted were—”
Oh, if he only knew.
Very, very new.
Steve lets out an annoyed exhale, sitting up straighter on the bed. “You know what. I’ll go to Howard. First thing tomorrow. I’ll tell him to take you back and—”
Tony lets himself take him in, take in those long lashes and his unblemished skin and the light freckles dusting his cheeks. Features meant for someone else to admire.
If Steve felt stupid before, the feeling he feels right now is on a different level.
They don’t end up telling them.
“It is 3.12 in the morning.”
“Did everyone leave on a holiday to the Bahamas without me or what?” Tony mutters, stomping over to the cabinets.
“There’s nothing wrong for wanting to be with someone, Cap.”
“So,” the host says, starry-eyed and predatory, “when did you first fall in love?”
“I better look dashing,” Tony interrupts. “You know me and mirrors. I wouldn’t have asked you if—”
He doesn’t know how long this goes on, losing track of time and himself into this moment, into
Or sharing a milkshake between them both. Or watching a movie with their hands in each other's grasp. Or maybe kissing against—
Maybe Steve could protect Tony from his dad if he isn’t scrawny and little. He supposes if he couldn’t stand up to his dad all those years ago, he definitely can’t to Howard.
“Why is that old man even flirting with him?” Tony mutters under his breath, staring at the two from Kamala’s Captain Marvel planner. “Isn’t he married? Pepper would have his wrinkly—”
If an Asgardian couldn’t get a second date with Tony, who else could?
“I should’ve said something,” Steve says into the dark much later, the glow of Tony’s arc reactor illuminating the room.
Steve beams, draping his arm around Tony’s shoulder. “Very good night.”
It’s a plain silver ring with a sapphire blue inlay. Steve even spies a loopy, ‘
“Thanks,” Tony says, shoving Hammer’s arm off him, “but no thanks. Now if you’re done—”
does Johnny look like him) but boring. Steve isn’t as open to trying new things as Johnny is, and steers clear of the big parties and events Tony is forced to attend. Unlike Johnny.
“True. But I’m just curious. Since you drew all this and all. You must have a favorite.”
“Watch the sunset because you think the colors are pretty, I know.”
Carol grins, holding out a hand in greeting. “Hey, Army.”
“You know what. You’re a genius.”
Tony sucks in a breath, his eyelids fluttering shut. “When?”
“Good. Good.” Tony takes another stab at his sausage. “So, guess which part of the Tower needs repairs?”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, his eyes roving his body in apparent concern. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I didn’t mean to—”
Natasha glances away from Kirk fighting Khan, sympathy written all over her face. Tony wishes he doesn’t love her enough to not call her out.
For the next couple of days, his phone won’t stop ringing. It stops when he launches it across the room.
Steve feels himself blush. “I don’t always mean to! You can be pretty distracting in shorts.”
“Says—Says everyone! What’d you mean—”
Storm grins. “You don’t look so bad yourself.”
Steve never knows how to answer those.
A hand on his shoulder stops him short.
“Now that’s bullshit.”
“I can go,” Steve says. “If you want me to. I’m not supposed to be here, anyway. Just wanted to check in with you. See if you’re okay.”
“You should’ve taken someone else with you.”
To his credit, Steve doesn’t recoil. Instead, his smile widens. “That’s kind of you to say. But I think my boyfriend here is so much more dashing. Wouldn’t you agree?”
At first, an involuntary smile had crept up Steve’s lips, a laugh threatening to spill out. But then he met Tony’s gaze and his breath caught, Tony’s words truly sinking in.
“I’m not upset.”
Pepper swats Tony on the arm and demands, “How come I didn’t know sooner? I’m one of your best friends
“Enough, Kamala,” the teacher stresses before turning her sharp scowl towards Party Pooper. “James, it’s not nice to interrupt your friends when they’re talking. What do we say when you’ve made a mistake?”
Tony Stark.”
“Hey,” Steve says, his lips curling, “it could work in certain situations.”
“It’s been
“We’ll talk about your jealousy issues—”
It’s not the first time Tony’s glad that they can’t see each other. From the moment Tony laid his eyes on Steve, he’s been subjected to one too many puppy-dog eyes and one too many poor attempts at making conversation. Like he’s begging Tony for forgiveness, which Tony has no right to give to Steve because
Tony cocks an eyebrow. “And you say I’m stupid for a genius all the time.”
As if dinner isn’t bad enough, Steve’s bad luck extends to the next eleven rounds of Mario Kart.
Jan smirks, waggling her eyebrows. “No promises.”
Tony shakes his head, a smile spreading across his lips. “I like you too, you big dork. I’ve liked you for over a year.”
“Of course I was,” Steve replies, wincing immediately after. Tony doesn’t know what to make of that.
As it should.
He could barely make out the whispers against his skin, the hand rubbing circles on his back, the hint of pine filling his nostrils.
“Wait, what?”
“Should we head back to the Tower?” he asks, hoping for the opposite. He’s been having such a wonderful time, just the two of them. He’s reluctant to let the day end, to let Tony return to Carol. “I’m sure—”
Steve’s face is now a deep shade of crimson. It’s a wonder he hasn’t burst yet. “Yeah. I told everyone to stall you so I could… I could kiss you first.”
Endgame Steve cocks an eyebrow. “Does it look like I’m joking?”
A chill runs down his spine. “Maria too?”
Thor brightens, tossing a fresh pair.
They’re called the Avengers, a superhero team dedicated to protect and avenge. Iron Man’s the leader.
Suddenly, Tony feels warm.
Horror dawn on him as he realized what he's just said.
“Did you at least—”
“I know. You always are.”
He’s debating on whether he should take a quick nap when he hears faint rustling coming from the other end of the backpack.
It’s not even an exaggeration. Only an idiot would let himself get distracted by some flirting that might be harmless, let himself get jealous—
“It’s just a joke, Cap. Chill.”
Tony scoffs, motioning to sit on the edge of his bed. “That’s what you said six decades ago,” he says, rubbing the rest of the sleep from his eyes. “And what happened after?”
“What if I’m right?”
Tony finds himself frowning. They had plans?
His mother rolls her eyes, returning her gaze back to the cake display. “Alright. I know when I’m not wanted anyway. Have fun, boys.”
“Nope,” she says calmly. “You’re gonna help clean the place up. In fact, all of us are. Except Steve, of course.”
Pepper and Sharon are clutching each other, their cheeks tear-streaked. Natasha’s hands are balled into fists. Carol keeps her distance from the bottles, her eyes trained on Tony’s. Rhodey sighs, thumbing the empty bottle in his grip.
“What?” Steve whispers.
Tony hides a mumbled curse behind a hand, praying for the storm to pass soon so he doesn't need to deal with being in another awkward situation with Captain America. Cap shouldn’t have rescued him alone.
“Only if you want to,” he says. “I know we’ve never talked about it and I know you don’t feel the same way—”
“Guess we know who she likes best,” Carol remarks smugly, gesturing towards the mini shrine of Carol Kamala seems to have, before breaking into a quiet snicker as she avoids the playful swat Sharon sends her way.
“He was crying last Movie Night. And you know he hardly cries during Movie Night.”
Tony blinks, recognition finally settling in when he glances upwards. “Cap?”
“I know—”
Tony’s eyes drift to the side, roving just like they were back when Tony first laid eyes on him today. Again, Steve feels heat creeping up his neck.
Steve’s cheeks redden, his hand reaching for his neck. “I mean, if you want. When Miles isn’t here, I always like to sit on the window sill and—”
“Hey,” he replies and just like that, he knows things wouldn’t be the same.
He gets a fond smile in return. “Yeah, I really do.”
“—eve! C’mon, buddy. Are you okay? Wh—”
“That happened.”
A tap on his shoulder forces him to glance up into familiar azure eyes.
His eyes search the crowd of mourners, pausing on a figure standing away from the crowd.
They’ll notice absence soon and Tony’s definitely going to be yelled at later, but he’s fine with it. If he gets to kiss Steve tonight, it’ll be worth losing his hearing for.
If this is some odd way of cheering Steve up, it doesn’t work. He’s about to toss his cards in the air when he loses for the seventh time in the row when Tony strides in, zeroing in on Clint.
“Not like, right now,” Tony clarified hastily. “I’m talking about, you know. Down the line. Say, five years? Definitely not ten. Or fifteen. Way too old. Uh… Maybe If we’re not dating someone else, we should get married.”
“Hey, big guy,” Tony says. “Having fun?”
“Sure. Fire away.”
It shouldn’t have gone beyond Hammer. Everyone knows Hammer’s an idiot. People would’ve definitely bought Steve’s lie as well, a lie, coming out of Hammer’s lips. And if there were eavesdroppers, Tony could easily buy them off.
Steve hums. “I didn’t know you could play. Or sing. Don’t think I’ve heard anyone mention it before.”
Steve doesn’t know who moved first but before he knows it, there are chapped lips pressed against his, arms snaked around Tony’s armored waist, and Tony’s gauntlet-covered hand cupping his cheek.
“Actually, it isn’t. My favorite isn't even out here.”
“C’mon. Don’t be shy, Cap. Come on in.”
That’s when the alarm goes off.
“Yes, you did. You coddled me. You—”
As soon as Steve steps into the living room, he freezes.
“I just didn’t think I could have you,” Tony replies simply, easy like breathing.
“Tony.”
“I’m fine,” Tony says curtly. “I just didn’t—”
Tony sighs, wiping his mouth. “Look, I was just worried about you, okay? Your birthday’s tomorrow and I don’t want you getting hurt over something dumb like arm-wrestling.”
Most people like to say Tony has never been in love. That he’s incapable of love.
His crush is here.
Sif beams. “They were freshly picked from Freya herself. Daisies are her sacred flower.”
Tony doesn’t know what to do with that. Instead, he turns away, his gaze glued onto the record store across the street. Steve loves vinyl records.
“I’d tell you if you’d let me finish.”
The anguish on Steve’s face is downright palpable. Tony doesn’t think he’s seen him this pained. Then again, it could be the painkillers and wishful thinking addling his brain.
On the bright side, at least it isn’t Barnes. He doubts he would’ve lasted a second with him.
“I was reluctant, sure. But I could’ve put my foot down. Insisted. But I thought it was the only way I could have you— God, I was so stupid.”
Clint seems to share Steve's disgust. “I didn’t need to know that—”
Paintings of Tony in red, gold, brown, and blue. Paintings of Tony in armor and suits. Paintings of Tony in flight and his workshop. Paintings of Tony with his public and private smiles. Painting of Tony, the man Steve is so in love with.
“Aye. She is looking forward to meeting with you.” She nods at Thor. “Your mother sends her love and requests you return for a visit posthaste.”
Steve swallows and braces himself. “I was holding you back.”
And it’s too much. Too sudden. Too everything.
Tony’s world shatters.
Tony’s played for so many people before – his family, board members and strangers when he’s drunk out of his mind, Rhodey and Pepper when their schedules align. He’s always played alone though, never with another. He always meant for his mother to be his first and last partner.
He clenches his jaw, whiling the sting behind his eyes and that terrible thought away.
Tony cocks an eyebrow. “Seriously?”
Cap never made his hatred for Tony a secret. He hardly acknowledges his presence and always makes excuses to not be in Tony’s vicinity. Whenever he and Tony’s team cross paths, he would gladly speak to everyone but Tony.
The mock annoyance melts away from Tony’s face, making way for a blinding smile.
Before he can stop himself, Tony blurts out, “You know, how the press is.” He barks out a laugh that sounds too shrill to his ears. “Vultures. Figured we’d keep things on the down-low.”
“JARVIS, run a—”
“I can’t do this,” he says, before getting to his feet to pay the bartender.
“Oh no, you don’t,” Tony interrupts, pulling him back against his chest. “You’re going to undress—”
He could feel Tony’s breath catch against his lips but then it’s suddenly moving. Molding. Slotting their lips and tongues together like a jigsaw puzzle.
Tony sighs. “Carol—”
“Well, jury’s out on that.” Tony groans, slumping in his seat. “God, we should’ve told them it was all a misunderstanding.”
Tony’s eyelids flutter as he whips his head in Steve’s direction. “Cap—”
Too bad he’ll never, ever be able to wake up to the sight.
“You thought I was rash,” Tony finds himself injecting. “Selfish. Arrogant.”
It’s been a while since villains showed up in New York. The last time Tony could remember, Doom had decided to go ape shit and send in his Doombots to terrorize the city a couple of months ago.
“I brought you here to ask you something. I thought it’d be symbolic. And rom—” Tony cuts himself off, clearing his throat. He jumps to his feet, Steve following suit. “I mean, uh… God, I had this whole speech planned out in my head. It’s supposed to be smooth and well-constructed. Like I even asked Rhodey to help and Carol—”
They take to the street aimlessly, soaking in the present. They pass by shops and cafés and restaurants. They window shop and muse. They whisper and laugh. It’s not the first time Tony thinks of the time before, before everything unraveled.
Tony clicks his tongue, flicking his cigarette stub to the ground. “Damn.”
But then, Steve thinks about Tony’s warm smile and wonders if he’d even feel less lonely if his classmates actually like him.
“Because you’re pretty,” he replies and Tony turns a bright shade of red.
Steve heaves a sigh, draining his soda.
“And lost.”
If Steve didn’t already know about Tony’s feelings for him before, he definitely knows now. Tony might as well be holding up a neon sign screaming, ‘I THINK I’M IN LOVE WITH YOU’, by the way he’s acting.
A heavy silence shrouds them. For a moment, Tony feels stupid. Exposed. He shouldn’t have said that. Fuck, he really should’ve kept his mouth shut and—
She crosses her arms. “I’m not the one with stubborn hair.”
“Uh-huh. Sure.” Tony flashes Steve a crooked smile. “Well, don’t you worry that pretty little head of yours. I’ll let you know when I’m gonna die. Learned my lesson and all that jazz.”
God, why does every Tony long for a Steve. It doesn’t make any sense.
“Me too,” Steve agrees. “You have kind eyes.”
A part of Steve is relieved that Tony would be meeting with Jennifer at the venue itself instead of she coming over. The last thing he needs is to see her waltz up to Tony and watch them chatter about whatever businessmen and lawyers talk about.
Steve exhales exasperatedly before reaching over to lace their fingers together. It’s not the first time he wishes Tony would shed his armor, not the first time he wants to know how it feels to have Tony's hand in his.
“You do know that’s not a compliment, right?”
“Tony’s pansexual,” Steve echoes, dazed.
And yet, here he is, his armor out of commission, and being carried out of a burning building.
“Tony—”
Tony would shoot him a witty remark if he had the strength to. Instead, he flashes him the best smirk he could muster.
Steve squashes that thought, returning his attention to the present. “I’m actually pretty proud of this one,” he says, handing it over.
“Still. At least let us—”
Tony grins. “Tell Cap congrats on getting his buddy back,” he says, clapping her on the shoulder. “Okay. Thanks. Bye!”
“I’m not into Bucky either,” Steve says, an annoyed edge to his tone. “What makes you think—”
“No. I wanted to kiss you tonight to see if you might like me back.
“Only if you’ll marry me too.”
“Other present?” Steve and Tony ask simultaneously.
Tony chuckles, shaking his head. “Not that either.”
Thankfully, JARVIS doesn’t make a comment at Steve’s embarrassing escape, silently directing him upwards. The whole elevator ride feels like forever, Steve’s shame growing by the second.
Steve sighs, laying his hands on Tony’s shoulders. “Tony—”
writes back.
Johnny’s lips shift into his trademark Cheshire grin, waggling his eyebrows. “Now,
“Not everyone.”
“I am,” Steve half-lies, trying his best to hide his arousal and annoyance. He shouldn’t be upset. He and Tony are being rescued from their date with death, after all. “It's good to see you.”
Steve’s eyes widen. “No, no! It’s just… You look stunning.”
Tony rolls his eyes before swallowing, guzzling it down with a gulp of coffee. “Did you at least tell Nat what’s eating at you? I mean, if you don’t wanna tell me—”
“It’s not funny, Tony,” Steve mutters as Tony pries his hands away, and god, has his eyes always been this brown? Has his lips has always been this pink, felt this soft? Fuck, they’re so soft.
But so what? Steve’s pretty (or so people tell him). He’s a great strategist. He'd like to think he has a kind heart. He's definitely in the same league as Jennifer. He can totally date Tony if that's what he's into.
“Sure you do, birdbrain. But yeah. You guys are fun and all but it’ll be nice to go out and have a nice time in a less platonic setting, you know? Have some little flirting going on—”
Steve’s lips tug to the side. “Takes one to know one.”
“What— How—”
The first thing Tony notices when he comes to is that he’s warm.
But then Tony does it twice the next morning so they're even.
Steve stills. “What?”
“Hey,” Steve says before he can stop himself.
He doesn’t bother looking over his shoulder, dashing over to the emergency stairs instead.
“Not at all,” Steve interrupts. “I… I’m just flattered.”
, he thinks, a little hysterical.
Steve shakes his head sheepishly. “No. That wasn’t planned. Hank accidentally let it slip that you... And I, uh… Yeah.”
Thor and Clint whip their heads in his direction, flashing him four thumbs-up.
“Tony.”
Because there’s no way Steve would care for him, not in the way Cartoon Steve does for his Tony. No way at all.
a friend that day.”
“I’ll lead if you don’t mind.”
“The New Year’s Eve party? The New Year’s Eve party you happened to organize? Ring any bells?”
“Johnny doesn't hold a candle to you.”
“Fuck. No. I wasn’t serious. I just—” Tony focuses on adjusting his watch strap, doing his best to ignore his heart that’s breaking in two. “I was joking. Chill, Cap. Chill.”
But then the possibility of Tony giving the bakery a one-star review on Yelp crosses his mind. The last thing he needs is his mother directing that Disappointed™ Stare of hers at him for the rest of his life.
Kate rolls her eyes. “He thinks JARVIS’s biased. Which is untrue because JARVIS is an AI.”
“Thought you’d send Obie down here. Why? Finally decided Brooklyn’s up to your standards?”
Steve frowns. “Don’t you?”
Tony sighs, turning to Natasha in hopes she’d let him sneak away like old times. Just like Steve, she’s gone.
And that’s not even the worst part.
“Hey,” she says brightly, “mind if I take Cap here out for a spin?”
He’s almost home free when he hears those very words.
“You do?”
“America would get over it,” Steve says airily, reaching over. “Here, let me get it.”
Why Johnny Storm? Why someone who’s blond and blue-eyed? Why someone who’s funny and flirty and confident and everything Steve isn’t?
Tony snorts, crossing his arms. “Again with that shit. Yeah, yeah. You got me out of the workshop. It isn't something to gloat about.”
His heart skips a beat at the sight of Steve dressed in a button-up that brings out the silver in his eyes, slacks, and dress shoes. It’s been years since Tony’s seen Steve dressed in such a manner. Yet, it still manages to take his breath away.
If he isn’t a vampire, he probably would’ve chalked it up to him hearing things. Then again, being a vampire hasn’t stopped him from hallucinating and hearing things.
A faint blush begins to spread across Steve’s cheeks. It’s downright adorable. “Uh, I can’t build an arc reactor?”
Steve frowns. He wonders if Tony’s dad is like his dad. But no one could be as bad as his dad.
Instead, fingers wrap around his wrist, yanking him into a dark alley. Before he can open his mouth, he’s enveloped in nothing but heat.
Tony huffs, crossing his arms over his chest as he juts his nose to the ceiling. “Like… Like you’re in love with me.”
Holy fucking
“It’s okay,” Steve whispers, his breath warm against Tony’s skin.
Steve rears back. “What—”
“—god, your heart—”
But it’s Ty. Good old Tiberius Stone who smells of cigar smoke, whiskey, and toxic waste.
“I still do,” Steve admits. “I don’t really feel like speaking to people anyway.”
He’s a sobbing mess after that, clutching onto her like she’d disappear. He feels terrible about ruining her birthday like this. She doesn’t need this, needs him.
A thought strikes Steve. “You’re right,” he says, lacing their fingers together. “C’mon, let’s go.”
“From what?” Tony demands. “How could you even think—”
Right now, he should be looking for Steve. Tony hasn’t seen Steve since he stormed off. It’s worrying.
It all happens in a flash. One moment, he’s watching Tony endanger himself, the next, he’s dashing to cushion Tony’s fall.
A lump forms in Tony’s throat. He swallows it down before he bursts. “You barely spoke to me since we sent Thor and Loki off.”
“Jesus,” Tony mutters. “Wait, so when you stormed off…”
Tony nods blearily as he immediately latches onto his mug. “Thanks sweetheart.”
This time, Natasha’s in his head, admonishing him for blurting out something stupid like that.
“Right,” Tony says, trying to keep his voice level. “Now if you’d excuse—”
“Uh-huh.”
“Because you’re looking for your favorite person and he’s slipped through the cracks?”
“Please don’t tell me you only found out when I was on a date with your doppelganger.” Something must’ve shown on Steve’s face because Tony pales. “Jesus, Steve.”
Steven Grant Rogers who let go of the Captain America mantle.
“Tony,” he says seriously, his eyes ablaze. “we need to talk.”
“Very sure! See? I hung them just fine. Besides, I’m the one with the rocket— Ah!”
Like a lot of stories, theirs begin in kindergarten.
Tony is very, very fucked.
Tony’s eyes widen as he appraises the selection. “Wait.
Silly Tony for opening his big fat mouth because Steve’s now looking at him with horror.
Steve’s staring at him with a weary gaze. He’s still dressed in his uniform, blood and sweat caking his skin.
Tony’s as beautiful as the last time Steve saw him. The only sign of aging on his face is the heavier weariness behind his eyes. Despite the front he tends to put up, Tony always seems weary, be it from the all-nighters he pulls or from carrying the weight of the world on his back.
It’s a nice night out, the cool spring air a welcoming feeling on his face and the Big Apple lights a dazzling sight. It would’ve been calming if some sugary pop song isn’t blaring from the ballroom but hey, it’s better than nothing.
Steve grins as he follows suit, pulling out his own velvet box.
The noise of gunfire cuts him off, followed by distant yelling.
“Wow.”
Tony cocks an eyebrow, setting his screwdriver down. “What? Why’re you all staring at me like that? I agreed to it. Isn’t that what you guys want?”
Because he can’t do this. Not again. Never again. He came back from hell slightly stronger, a little better. He can’t do this again. Never again.
Tony swears he feels a breeze against his skin.
Steve couldn’t help but scowl at that. Wonderful. Just what he needs right now.
“Go, Cap!” someone else calls after them.
He feels the bed dip.
He doesn’t think about Tony Stark anymore.
Tony barks out a laugh. “Well, that’s Howard for you. Mom gave me lessons whenever Howard wasn’t around.” He sighs. “It was one of the few times I saw her at peace.”
“Deets?”
“Do I need to remind you of last week?” Natasha remarks. “You guys have barely spoke to each other since.”
He leads Steve through the exhibits, past artifacts, sculptures, and depictions of animals and humans who're long gone. They debate and joke among themselves as they do.
“You think so?”
Not that he has much reason to spend time here besides to play. The room’s as sparse as the rest of his apartment. Bookshelves filled to the brim with music books and sheet music, a couch propped against a wall, and of course, instruments. The guitars and bass propped up on their stands, the violin and cello in their cases, the harmonica and ocarina on the shelf, the drums in a corner, the harp in another.
It’s not like Tony has a problem with Steve Rogers. After all, how could anyone hate Steve Rogers? He’s the embodiment of apple pie and sweet tea, oozes of goodness and purity, and is a champion of equality. That man is a literal walking American flag. It doesn’t matter if Miles’ Steve is based on the guy who denounced the mantle. Nor does it matter if Steve dyed Tony’s armor black (again, Tony’s pissed because,
As usual, Natasha isn’t wrong. Tony should’ve just march up to Steve and tell him instead of chasing him around the helicarrier on New Year’s Eve. He’s already wasted so much time. Why’s he wasting more?
In the distance, he hears something. Like something’s cracking.
Clint lets out another whine. “But Tasha! Tony can do it after clean— Ow!”
“Do you think I’m that shallow?” Tony asks, hurt.
Tony always looks good to Steve. And yet here he is, silently losing his mind over the fact that Tony is all dressed up.
Hank and Bruce look on fearfully as Steve storms away from them. Tony’s about to follow after him when a hand stops him in place.
Steve almost chokes on his sweet and sour fish.
Would it a SHIELD agent? One of the X-Men? Heck, it could be a civilian.
Natasha sighs. She inches closer, lacing their caramel-stained fingers together. Tony fights the urge to yank away and hide in his bedroom.
Steve glances up, meeting those brown eyes he’s been slowly falling for over the years.
made all of these?”
New York City is a big place. Tony doesn’t even need to try to avoid anyone. He could stride down the street without anyone batting an eyelid or calling his name.
“Afraid that your armor is no match for Mjolnir,” Thor asserts, his joyful grin turning haughty. “That you are afraid to reconcile with the truth that magic does trump science.”
“Stupid,” Tony mutters as he stomps away. “Stupid, stupid,
But of course, Tony wouldn’t. He’s not dating this Carol. Carol who seemed to have shared the same bed as Tony. Carol who’s definitely wearing one of Tony’s shirts. Carol who—
Not that Hammer knows that. Hell, only Tony’s close friends do. Still, it doesn't change how it feels.
“—but the point is, I don’t get why you keep giving him such a hard time. He isn't a bad guy, you know.”
He’s pulling on his other high-top when Natasha pauses at the door.
“Oh,” Tony says, his brow creasing. “Is it—”
standing back to back as they stare down these horrors.
And just like that, his heart plummets.
“Of course not,” Tony lies. “Why would I be disappointed in seeing one of my favorite people around?”
“Bucky’s like a brother to me. I’m actually kind of grossed out that you’d think—”
“The team’s happy for us. Fury isn’t pissed for once. The stocks have been soaring since the news. If you haven’t been reading trashy tabloids and right-winged articles, you would know that a lot of people are supportive. In fact,” Steve opens a new article, “a lot of people in the LGBTQ+ community are excited. The announcement’s helped a lot of people come out, or at least be more accepting of their own identities. It’s good for the people.”
“I love you too.”
“Everything?”
“I was going to ask—”
“Why me?” Tony asks when the conversation begins to wind down. They’re at the end of Steve’s exhibit, staring up at a painting of Iron Man floating in space. “Never pegged you as a fan.”
“Tony—”
Just like that, all of Tony’s hopes are dashed. “So you don’t like me?”
He does. She helps him sober up and offers to be his wall for the night. Not for a second does she judge him.
Someone lets out a low whistle behind him.
“Why’d you call me ‘Cap’?”
Tony lets out a yelp, scrambling to his feet. He probably would’ve tripped over himself if a strong arm hasn’t curled around his waist, tugging him back on solid ground.
Tony’s waiting for him in his penthouse, conversing with Natasha and Bruce. The three of them swerve their heads in his direction as he approaches.
“Yeah?”
Steve closes the news with a wave of the hand. “Hey,” he says softly, “you alright?”
“I know, I know. Apology accepted. It’s fine.”
It’s pathetic. Tony is
Steve’s blush deepens. “I didn’t have any nightmares. Just couldn’t sleep. I asked him if you were awake but he told me you weren’t. So I headed down to the gym, beat some punching bags around. He only told me you’re up a moment ago.”
“I can’t believe we wasted five hundred years,” Steve continues. “We could’ve had— We could’ve been—”
Steve’s heart skips a beat, drinking him in. Sleepy Tony has always been a sight – his messy hair, half-lidded eyes, his quiet grumbles. It’s just absolutely adorable.
“She’s
If the last several minutes were bad, this is torture. It’s a challenge to ignore how handsome Tony is up close, even harder to ignore how much Steve wants to hold him like this, to carry him up to his room to kiss him silly.
Both Natasha and Carol glare at Tony.
It’s a shame that his heart isn’t smart enough to.
Clint snorts. “It’ll probably be a bunch of bullcrap. We definitely have to have Rhodes over for the deets.”
“What was what?”
“Well…”
“I don’t know,” he says, parroting her. “Do you?”
“Yikes.”
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “Too well.” He pauses, trying to piece his thoughts together. “But why... Why him?”
Of course he doesn’t. Steve isn’t a superhero with alien blood running through his veins. He isn’t the one who used to be one of the best officers in the American Air Force. He isn’t dating Tony either.
Tony shrugged his shoulders. “Then we don’t marry each other.”
Tony pauses, poking his head back into the laboratory. “Wait. How the hell did you know about the kiss? Let me guess, Nat.”
A blur hits Zola in the chest. He crumples to the ground in an instant. The blur doesn't stop, sailing over Tony's head and bounces off a nearby wall before disappearing from sight.
“Stark,” Maria Hill begins crisply, “we need to talk.”
Before anyone could reply to that, footsteps approach them.
He's not ready for this. Not now. Not ever.
Breaking up has always been funny to Tony.
Natasha’s eyes narrow. “What are you talking about? You thought it was a good idea last week.”
The walk home is languid and serene. Tony presses himself against Steve, his arm looped around Steve’s as they take each other and their surroundings in.
It makes sense. This month’s theme is ‘Your Favorite Toy’, after all. And since Tony is Miles’ favorite behind Peter (who’s barred from ever showing up in Miles’ class again. Apparently, gushing about Peter Parker’s winning personality and intelligence and bendable limbs in every show-and-tell even bores excited first graders to death), Tony has to make an appearance.
Ty’s smile turns sharp. “Steve, huh? You’re still hung up on that idiot? After all this time?” He steps closer until their noses brush, his breath searing and sour. “Tell me does he know how much you begged for it that night—”
“Yeah,” Steve says, his lips tugging to the side. “The beard. I, uh… I— I mean, movie me. Movie me grew it out. Because of you.”
“But Fury is AWOL.”
But then he remembers Tony is straight and he tries his best to not beat himself over it.
“I didn’t exactly—”
“I do?”
Steve’s cheeks turn a deep crimson. “I just thought— When you asked me to be friends-with-benefits with you, I just felt lucky, you know? Flattered. That you liked this.” He gestures to his body. “And I guess I was just happy to take whatever I can get.”
“Steve?”
“Okay. You?”
Steve glances around. “Don’t we have decorations to put up?”
A breakthrough Steve hates but a breakthrough nonetheless.
It doesn’t come.
Tony’s frown deepens but thankfully doesn’t seem to pursue the subject.
Steve squares his shoulders. He’s wasted days trying to psyche himself up, wasted days listening to his friends psyching him up for this moment. He can’t waste this moment. Not again. Not when he knows better now.
“What?” Steve demands. “You didn’t think I could beat her?”
Tony does his best to keep his grin from slipping off his face. “Of course it is?
Not that his aunt ever told him. But he wouldn't be surprised if it's true.
Tony hates this, hates how the one thing he wants is totally out of reach, hates Howard for not telling him this one fucking little thing, hates how Steve—
Carol doesn’t say anything for several moments. “God, Tony,” she finally says, massaging her temples. “Only you idiots. You could’ve cleared it all up.”
“Yinsen,” Tony affirms. “But if you’ve been in love with me, why didn’t you ask me out?”
A nudge to his head snaps Steve out of his thoughts. He whips behind him, meeting Natasha’s knowing smirk.
And that's when he notices Tony's lips being an odd shade of pink.
Steve jerks away, blinking wildly. “I wasn’t— I don’t— I was just—”
Tony frowns, puzzled. “You wear scent blockers.”
“That leaves you with me, kid,” Clint pipes up. “Which means you lovebirds get to room together.”
Tony stills.
“No. I meant—” Tony swallows, glancing away. “You love him.”
Like a moth to a flame, Steve meets him halfway in a soft kiss.
Tony couldn’t help but groan as Kate saunters over with Clint in tow.
“Steve’s back,” Natasha says.
Tony scoffs.
Story of Tony’s life.
“Your jokes,” he settles on instead, airily like it’s nothing. “I just don’t get ‘em.”
To get Steve in trouble, wherever he is.
By the time Fin Fang Foom slinks back to the Savage Land, a thunderstorm plagues them.
Her grin widens. It’s the one Steve loathes with every fiber of his being. The one that tells him she knows something he doesn’t. The one that tells him he’s being a dumbass.
Surprisingly, Steve’s more put together this time the last time they met. “Mr and Mrs Burke,” Steve says smoothly, shaking Mr Burke's hand. “It’s good to see you.”
Romance. If only that’s the truth.
The door behind them slides open. Tony would’ve broken his back if Steve hadn’t steadied him in time.
Neither of them speaks for a long moment. Tony could imagine the thoughts turning in Steve’s head. Steve’s always been one to fixate on the weirdest details.
He scoffs. “Fine. Whatever.”
God, he is so glad everyone’s in the common room and the hangar. The last thing he needs is someone seeing him trying to get in Captain America’s pants.
“We should get going,” Tony says instead, his mouth tasting like ash. “Don’t wanna be late.”
“It would not be right if—”
He really,
The gala is in full swing when Tony steps into the room. Immediately, he’s overwhelmed by the cacophony of sounds and sights around him - the clinking of wine glasses, the soft chatter, the blinding lights, the people dressed to the nights.
“Yeah, but—”
Tony pauses, dangling from the monkey bars. “I probably can’t.”
“So you say,” Steve says, pulling his denim shirt on
So to see Tony willingly lounging in the living room, chatting animatedly with everyone and looking fresh as a daisy puzzles Steve.
Tony had pegged Kamala for a Marvel fan but he didn’t expect the various merchandise filling her room, from posters to mugs to toys. Even her walls are painted in familiar red, gold, and blue.
“Here!” he calls from under the Mercedes he’s fixing up. He rolls out and gets to his feet. Picks up the nearest cloth to wipe the grease from his fingers. “Anything I can—”
Tony smirks as he watches the two dash out of the ballroom. Maybe this time, the Burkes will finally leave them alone.
As much as Steve’s ravenous and eager for Tony’s company, he’s pretty sure that accepting Tony’s invitation would include having Carol tagging along. And honestly, that’s the last thing—
“And Tony,” Carol adds.
This isn’t like the other kisses they’ve shared, brief and chaste. Steve kisses like he fights, focused and furious and intense. Tony couldn’t help but give in, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
“Taken lessons, have you?” he asks quietly as they continue to skate across the floor with surprising ease.
Steve blinked at the waving hand. “Huh. Yeah. Sorry. I was just…”
Steve frowns, disappointment and hurt settling in his stomach.
“Six months, give or take.”
Steve barely registers his fingers moving, barely registers opening the envelope as his body thrums with anticipation and nerves.
“Fruit Loops?”
Tony takes Steve’s hand in his, his thumb worrying Steve’s ring. “I mean, we don’t have to. We could just tell everyone—”
“Cap? You in there?”
super soldier stamina.
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, trying to sound as gentle as possible despite himself. His heart is thumping hard against his chest, the sound deafening in his ears.
Tony huffs. “Funny. I’m talking about, you know. Grabbing breakfast, watching a movie, taking a stroll in the park. Or something.”
“Time flies huh,” Tony mutters to himself as he fastens his cape around his neck. “Five hundred goddamn years.”
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Managed to ignore it the whole time. Being in good company helps, I guess.”
Steve cocks an eyebrow, feigning ignorance. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Now come on. Two people down, hundreds more to go.”
“I get Tony out of there all the time,” Steve blurts out.
Which means they’ve done it enough times for Tony to be okay with it. Steve isn’t sure what to make of that.
One day, he’s sitting on the couch, watching some stupid soap and a bowl of popcorn in his hands when he realizes that he hasn’t thought of Steve the past couple of days.
Plus, Steve has his belt unbuckled and Tony’s vest and a couple of buttons of his shirt popped. It’s a major win, all around.
Tony sighs, waving his hand around. “I don’t know. I just— Isn’t this something you do with your mate?”
“I think we should stop here,” Steve tells him. “Before we get more miserable. We don’t make each other happy anymore.”
“Nope. Headed out to buy more beer.”
“No, I don’t.”
“Uh-huh. And where’s your own data? Stats? Proof?”
Tony doesn’t move a limb until the door shuts behind the kids. When it does, he immediately pushes Steve off him, breaking the kiss.
“Ty,” Tony says stiffly. “Fancy seeing you here.”
“Like you said, I’m always hungry.”
“I’ll room with Thor,” Bruce immediately answers.
“Why’d you do it?” Steve asks as they lie in bed, their legs intertwined. “You could’ve gotten hurt.”
“Ooh. This is a cool one.”
Tonight though, all he wants to do is trade it all in for the bombast of Black Sabbath blasting through his workshop speakers as he works in grease, the bustle during team dinners, or the comfortable silence he shares with Steve whenever they spend time together.
Steve huffs. “You guys were trying to make me jealous, huh.”
It doesn’t make sense. Steve’s the paragon of righteousness and truth. He never lies. Why he would start doing it now, over something dumb like this? It’s beyond Tony.
“Meant what?”
It’s bad enough that all of Tony’s previous dates are all smart and fierce and beautiful and leagues above Steve. But to see him with a man who embodies all of those traits is just...just...
“Okay… But I still think—”
That night, he draws Tony at a desk, writing a letter with a fond smile on his lips.
Tony gasps, his eyes widening in betrayal. “No.”
Tony could hear the scowl in his tone. “It wasn’t funny. It didn’t sound like a joke.”
The man just looks at him with sad, sad eyes and suddenly Tony hates him. Hates him for pitying him. Hates him for choosing Tony in the first place. Hates him for having the same blue eyes as Steve. Hates him for giving him orgasms that couldn’t make him forget.
, he’s just a leader to a bunch of stubborn kids. Teenagers.
, I might reconsider.”
He hopes it’s enough to fool her. But judging by the number of cookies she ends up baking and the movies she queues up, it’s not.
Mates who’d be furry and smelly and enjoy roaming around in the woods for the rest of eternity. Not bloodsucking nocturnals who fly around and live in graveyards.
Tony's gaze drifts over to the ballroom. Somehow, they've garnered some attention. It isn't surprising considering they're Captain America and Tony Stark. But the glances are pointed at their linked arms, with some attendees whispering to each other.
“—was saying! But Sam told me— Hey, what’s that?”
He approaches with tentative steps before clearing his throat. Steve whips his head upwards, eyebrows arching. He’s looking at Tony like it’s the first and the last time he’ll see him. Tony doesn’t know what to make of that.
“The Invaders were hitting a Nazi convoy not far from where you were held. Fury got hold of us, told us that you lost communication with your team.” Cap ducks his head, pulling away. “He asked me to get you.”
“Am I right or am I right?”
Their eyes meet for a brief moment before Steve glances away, his eyes trained on the countertop.
“Uh, let—” He clears his throat as he tries to wrestle his nerves down. “Let him in.”
The hands that unbuckle his restraints are also familiar. They're warm and comforting but calloused.
Tony’s known Steve for years now. And yet, he still manages to astonish him.
fit here. If he hadn’t befriended
As he expects, Howard’s waiting for him on his doorstep.
“This is my stop,” Tony says, his voice sounding far away to his ears.
Steve perks up. “Really?”
Tony hums. “I mean, we gotta have a label if you wanna ward Johnny off.”
A month after Tony’s disappearance, Steve gets a visit from Maria Stark.
But tonight might be the first time he'll get a 'no', get a,
It’s bizarre enough that Fury’s all smirks and wishes about the whole thing. It’s so much weirder when their enemies act in a similar fashion.
“You need any help? I can get the—”
“You thought I was hung up over Pepper.” Tony exhales. “Steve, I told you—”
Sharon turns away, her gaze trained on the afternoon bustle outside. “He didn’t cheat on you.”
“Not every day per se. But close enough.”
Some days are terrible. Tony would come to class distant. Whenever Steve could coax an explanation out of Tony, he’d always get the same answer – that it’s all Howard Stark’s fault.
Tony rolls his eyes as he pulls away, dropping back onto one knee. “Ugh, the things I do for you.”
“Referee? Referee what?”
It’s already bad enough that he was rouse from his sleep at two, three in the morning for this. It’s too early to deal with this. Or well, ever.
Once again, Steve’s ugly side hopes for that.
“What do they like?”
There’s something behind his eyes that shakes Tony’s insides. But he turns away and makes a move to his car because he can't, he really can't—
“Kamala,” the teacher finally chides (took her way too long in Tony’s opinion, but whatever, it’s still better than nothing). “Sit back down.”
As much as Tony hates to admit, Hammer’s not wrong about that. Whenever there’s a black-tie event or gala, Steve tries his best to worm his way out of going. Even when he does end up going, he always tries his best to blend in with the walls, which Tony finds highly amusing.
“I never—” Steve swallows, doing his best to refrain from screaming. “No one’s gotten me a Valentine’s Day gift before.”
If Steve excuses himself up to his room to lick his wounds in his room, no one has to know that but himself.
Tony had let out a frustrated sigh, his jaw clenching. “Whatever. They’re idiots. You’ll find the right one soon enough. I mean, you’re the whole package. Blue eyes, heart of gold, hair of gold—”
It’s nice. Both familiar and different. It’s funny how this is what distracts Steve. Yet his contentment, he can’t help but feels like something’s missing.
No, he’s not going there. He’s going to have a nice time out with Tony and forget about how Carol was in Tony’s shirt and—
“Except the homophobes,” Carol pipes up.
“Hi,” Tony breathes out and he hates this, hates how his breath catches. “How’re… How’re you?”
If Steve thought he was out of Tony’s league, he’s definitely out of his ballpark now.
It all makes sense now. Sure, Steve held a torch for Aunt Peggy then. But maybe Steve and Barnes had something brewing between them. Hell, Peggy and Bucky could've shared Steve.
“Tell me,” Steve says.
Steve doubts any villain would be standing in their kitchen and not committing any crimes besides breaking into Avengers Tower, let alone cooking and humming.
All he can hope is that Tony can’t feel his quickening pulse or—
Hammer slides up to Tony during the afterparty of the annual Stark Expo, offering to keep him company for the night.
Tony raises his eyebrows. “You seem pretty adamant of me staying single for the rest of my life.”
“Why would I be lonely?” Steve asks, sounding puzzled. “I have you.”
“Have I forgot to mention that I’ve been in love with you for four hundred and ninety-nine years?” Steve opens his mouth but Tony cuts him off. “And before you ask, no, I don’t care what people think about us. People have been assuming for years, anyway.”
“It was love at first sight. The first thing I saw when I was defrosted was his eyes. I don't think I've ever been more enchanted.”
Bruce doesn’t seem to buy it. Fortunately, he doesn’t get a chance to pursue the matter.
This time when they kiss, it’s hot and desperate and all so
“Steve,” Tony breathes out as he succumbs to the darkness.
“Ha!” Clint cries, jumping to his feet. “Suck it, losers! Suck my dick!”
“I do, you numbskull,” Steve says fondly. “I’ve loved you from the moment we met.”
Steve nods. There’s a sparkle in his eyes. Tony doesn’t let himself hope. “I know it’s cliché for me to say but it’s true. I met him as Iron Man first and I remember being enchanted by his grace and intelligence.”
. ‘My heart’ in Irish.
Dates and sex never go any further than once. There’s no point in them trying to compete with a phantom.
“Let me just say if I was there, I would’ve totally jumped in. No one messes with Peter. I’m glad you were there.” Tony exhales and fuck, their faces are close, so close that Steve can feel Tony’s warm breath. “And your boyfriend.”
Zola exhales heavily. “I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything less. Now—”
His lips twist into a smirk, taking a couple of steps backwards. He probably noticed Tony forgot, the bastard.
He looks good. Ridiculously good. His hair longer, combed back. His skin glowing. His eyes the same bright shade of blue the last time Tony saw him.
Tony holds up a hand. “Let me finish.” Steve presses his lips together. “We were debating about it a while back so I was like, 'Well, I need proof' and he went, 'Alright, I show you proof'. So we got Nat to spar with you just to see if you'd be…distracted.” A light blush spreads across his cheeks. “It’s hard to argue with what I saw. Even if I had doubts. Lots of them. I still couldn't believe it but Johnny and Nat insisted I get my ass up here and ask you myself and well... Here we are.”
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “I mean, he seems like the kind of guy to take part in one. Hey, look on the bright side. At least it isn’t a hot dog eating contest. That would’ve made a grosser picture.”
“It’s perfect,” Tony breathes out. “It’s fucking perfect.”
“Oh Tony,” Jan murmurs, pulling into an embrace and fuck, she’s so
“Romanoff, I swear if you finish that sentence—”
“That’s bullshit—”
“Brock says they’re ugly.”
Tony blinks, his brain trying to process this shred of news. “Holy fuck.”
“Jesus, Nat—”
This is how Steve learns of another devil named Howard Stark.
Steve’s lips part, words on his tongue when he hears footsteps behind him.
Tony mirrors the gesture. “Don’t thank me. It’s the truth. So… Which is it?”
“Steve—”
Steve frowns. “You’re not making sense.”
Which could only mean one thing.
The smile he receives in return is blinding. The smile that he's always wanted trained his way for years. The smile that's now meant for him and only him.
And to think that he could hole up in here, away from...them.
“I know.” Tony pauses, fishing out a pack from his blazer. “Cigarette?”
On one hand, Steve’s heart was all for it because
“Care to tell me why the fuck you’re here?”
low possibility of coming true.
This is how Tony comes back.
Tony wonders if Barnes knows of Steve darkening Tony's doorstep. Tony wonders if Barnes feels the same way about Steve's touch, Steve's kiss. Tony wonders if he’s tasting him on Steve’s lips.
“You’re out of my league, Tony. So out of my league.”
Tony drops his head back onto the mattress. “Asshole. You’re an asshole, you know that? I’m going to—to—”
Steve wishes the floor would just open under his feet and swallow him up.
No, he needs a distraction. A real and proper distraction. Something that could consume him whole, that could make him forget. A last resort.
Which is why, Steve, the idiot he is, agreed.
In a flash, they’re scrambling to their feet, hastily grabbing onto each other. In the flurry of activity, somehow Tony ends up tripping over his own feet, knocking him and Steve back onto the ground.
“Tony loathes and I'm telling you
“I like you.”
And almost collides with Tony because he has the best luck in the world.
“Hey, Tony,” Sharon says, her voice bright and way too cheery and ethereal as always. “How’re you?”
The only reason why Tony turned Steve’s proposal down is because he thinks he won’t make a good husband. Nothing more, nothing less.
Tony wants to die.
Jan grins, his eyes shining as she declares, “Well, congratulations are in order. You both finally got your heads out of your asses. I should’ve known the moment you both turned up dressed like that.”
“It was,” Steve agrees. “Going from being deaf in one ear to actually being able to play along to a song without any trouble was just…”
Steve smiles and trails his lips down Tony’s jawline. “Never.”
To not fall even more hopelessly for someone he can’t have.
“Fucking MODOK,” Tony mutters as he shoots another beekeeper down. “Goddamn fucking floating head. Fuck, when I have his ass—”
“You only needed to ask if you wanted to see me naked, Tony.”
The feeling of Tony's goatee brushing against his skin, the hint of coffee he tastes, the warmth spreading through his chest. It’s both everything and better than he ever dreamed of.
“I should go,” Steve murmurs.
Tony nods.
Because he maybe,
“Mm-hmm, poor me,” Tony murmurs, meeting him halfway.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Cut me some slack, Steven. I’ve been dead for centuries. Excuse me for not remembering. I figured that was your regular heartbeat.”
Tony isn’t one for musicals. But his mother had been such a fan of them, especially The Fantasticks, that Tony was practically raised on them.
Fuck, he really should’ve seen the signs.
“I mean— Wait, you’ve been pining over me?”
Tony groans, burying his face in his hands. “Great. More things to fix. Again.”
“Tony,” Steve frets, both awed and horrified at the gesture. “You didn’t have to.”
And then pain explodes over his face.
He spins on his heel, heading for the door and not bothering to wait for Steve to catch up.
“God,” Steve says between bites of carbonara. “This is so good.” He twirls several noodle strands around his fork and holds it out. “Try it.”
Just like that, the fear shifts into something tender, something quiet. “Okay,” Steve exhales in what sounds like relief, tucking a stray curl behind Tony’s ear. “Okay.”
Steve crosses his arms in front of his chest. “We do get along, you know,” he points out, sounding like the petty child he secretly is.
Occasionally, it’s, “I want to see you.”
“Hey, Cap!” Tony greets him brightly. His smile wavers, his brow furrowing. “You okay?”
Steve turns around, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “I thought you said you’d leave us alone.”
Tony leans his head against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “Never pegged Captain America to go for guys.”
“That's super cool of you.” Kamala’s comforted expression slips back into a tentative one. “I, uh, I also have another question. It’s about you know, designs for my suit. If that’s okay with you. And if you have the time to talk.”
What would they be up to right now? Would they be discussing their feelings? Hug? Kiss? F—
Steve smiles, squeezing Tony’s shoulder in reassurance. “It’ll all work out. You’ll see.”
And just like that, the words on Tony’s tongue die.
Steve scowls as he zips his jeans up. “I’m not joking around. They really are dating.”
Steve purses his lips. “I enlisted. Or at least tried to. A few times. Got rejected every single time like you said I would. Then, I met this scientist at one of the centers. Emile Erskine. Said he could get me in. Or had a place for me, anyway. It was an experimental program. I could’ve died. But you know how desperate I was to serve.”
Without much thought, Tony takes it.
Instead, he gets a raised eyebrow in return and a nonchalant, “So?”
“She said she’ll tell him when we find him.”
“What?”
“Steve isn’t my boyfriend anymore,” he forces out. It’s a miracle he hasn’t burst into tears yet.
Rhodey. Good old Rhodey. Rhodey, who’s been with him since forever. Rhodey, who deserves better than being friends with someone like him, a nothing.
“I know,” he interrupts. “I just— I just thought you were saying it to make me feel better. And everyone said you were! They said you were crying to Inception!”
Steve Rogers who’s mostly likely peering at him through his beard with the weirdest look on his face, waiting on Tony’s answer like an idiot.
He scowls. He loves Natasha. He really does. But he hates how she could see right through him sometimes, hates how they're more alike than he’d like.
He should turn her down and look for Steve. Stay by his side. Make sure he doesn’t run off before midnight so he can kiss his stupid, stupid smile because he’s a coward.
“Now that we’ve gotten that all cleared up,” Tony begins when they break apart, “I heard you were going to have a pizza party yourself. Got room for your boyfriend?”
Just as he’s about to search the hangar for Steve, someone blocks his way.
“Disappointed?” Natasha drawls behind him, her lips quirked to the side.
Tony sighs, placing his hands on his hips. “Jeez. Steve Rogers and their stupid, stupid—” He pauses, whirling back. “Wait, did you say you and your Tony—”
Tony whips around to face Steve. “You can’t be serious.”
“How am I—”
“Hey, that’s my AI you’re talking about here,” Tony says defensively. “Sides’, is this really that imp—”
And Tony. God, does Tony
Tony and Hank haven’t always been at each other’s throats. Back when Hank was a part of the Avengers, Tony, Hank, and Bruce spent a lot of time bouncing ideas and talking science. But coupled with Hank’s dismissal from the Avengers and his insecurity over Jan’s close relationship with Tony, their friendship dissipated over time.
Bucky frowns, arms crossed in front of his chest. “It’s two in the afternoon.”
Again.
“No. Just—” Tony covers his heart with a palm, mentally willing his pulse to slow. “I’m fine.”
Steve doesn’t go to his ten-year high school reunion.
A simple white T-shirt that’s clinging to his body in all the right places and god, Tony could—
But all he can hear is his heart shattering into a million pieces in the deafening silence called heartbreak.
As Thor begins to push the escape pod back to Earth, Tony settles back into his seat, pinning Steve with a tentative expression. He looks absolutely ravished, his lips pink and wet and god, he has to hold himself back from jumping him again. Steve should’ve done this so long ago, should’ve asked him to remove his helmet so he can mess Tony’s hair with his fingers.
Steve shakes his head fondly, sighing. “I really am sorry about tonight. It was supposed to be a one-time thing. But then I looked at you again and I just— I just couldn’t help myself—”
, he doesn’t say.
“You are not a dumbass.”
“Think about what?”
Steve startles, his pulse quickening. “We’re idiots, aren’t we?”
Steve ignores the sting that hits his heart. Because of course, that’s how Tony knows him. How could Steve forget about his own little reputation? No one ever takes notice of scrawny little Steve Rogers unless he’s getting beaten up.
Steve can’t help but grin as he watches Clint dash out of the room, Hulk hot on his heels. Just like with every single Hulk rampage, there’s a lot of crashing and screaming.
Pepper smirks behind her champagne glass. “Ah, romance.”
But of course, his luck runs out one night.
“That shirt is definitely not going to work out,” Natasha says disdainfully. “Doesn’t show off your abs.”
“I know you hate all the mate talk but as I said before—”
Sif trades pleasantries with Thor before training her gaze on Tony. “It is a pleasure, Man of Iron,” she says, tilting her head in acknowledgment. “Thor has spoken much about you.”
For a brief moment, he lets himself lean into the touch, bask in Tony’s concern before he meets a pair of azure blue eyes behind Tony.
Tony hasn’t even spoken a single word to him yet and he’s already ready to die of embarrassment. Once again, the urge to drink is strong. Which is bad considering he’s going to be two months sober next Thursday.
Tony winces. “Okay. Not just that. It’s just good publicity, you know? Apparently, people think that engaged to Captain America is a good thing.”
Home? Tony doesn’t have a home. Not anymore. Not the little apartment in front of him. Not the lonely mansion up in Manhattan either.
. He’s Iron Man. He’s from the Civil War line. He knows very well that Steve doesn’t care for him. Every MCU Steve except probably Endgame Steve doesn’t care for him, including Miles’ sad and pathetic Infinity War Steve. Miles’ Steve only feels ill-disguised guilt and probable anger for Tony.
Months after his twenty-first birthday and getting his second Master’s degree, Tony Stark takes over as CEO of Stark Industries. He’s the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.
“Good things, I hope.”
“Oh ha ha. Very funny.”
“No, I’m not.”
As quickly as it came, the color in Steve’s cheeks drains.
Tony rears his head back, caught off-guard. “Thanks, Sarah!”
Steve’s features scrunch up. Confused Steve looks like a puppy. It’s adorable. “Yeah. I mean, you always make speeches at parties like these. What’d you—” He pauses, a smile slowly creeping up his face. “Huh. Clint was right. You did forget.”
“JARVIS,” Steve says. “Recycle bin?”
Steve rolls his eyes before ruffling Tony’s hair.
He slowly inhales, braces himself, and turns. There’s a soft smile gracing Steve’s lips. The mid-morning sunlight filters through the curtains, casting Steve in a soft glow.
“Why the pseudonym?” Sharon asks on her first day as his agent. “Don’t want people knocking at your door?”
He nods again.
“That’s corny as fuck.”
“Is that so hard to believe?”
Something flickers over Tony’s face, a mixture of probable disbelief and suspicion. Steve silently curses himself.
Steve’s scowl deepens, his lips parted as if to comment on that remark. Tony speaks before he can.
Even so, being here, surrounded by his friends, is the lightest he felt since he got here. It doesn’t lessen the pain in his chest though.
Which is just a bunch of lies. He would’ve stood his ground if Natasha hadn’t pulled out another knife from her sleeve and all-too casually begin to sharpen it. Steve's pretty sure she's messing with him but well, better safe than sorry.
fucking much.
them? They hate each other!”
Steve feels his cheeks warming, his heart thumping against his ribcage and his head light.
He should’ve been there, should’ve called, should’ve texted, should’ve written back, should’ve asked Tony to run away with him all those years ago, should’ve, should’ve—
“I want to,” Tony interrupts fiercely.
For a moment, Tony braces himself. For the pain. The betrayal. The anger.
“Wow is right,” Steve agrees.
“Where are we even going?”
Sharon smirks, toasting the air. “Nothing it is.”
“Hey, Tin Man!” Piledriver calls. “Congrats on the engagement!”
Tony’s a fucking idiot.
—not do it.
“Are you mad?” he asks quietly.
Tony stills. Coos fill the room.
Finally, Steve lets out the sigh he’s been holding back since they started this meeting.
, you mean,” Tony blurts out.
“Of course I do,” Tony mutters. “All of them are in love with each other. My— Our Steve? Zero. Zip. Nada—”
Steve pauses, his fingers curled around his tie, his lips parting as his blue,
When Steve and Jan meet, just the two of them, nothing explodes. Tony’s glad for that.
Tony gets a nod in response.
“Time for what?”
that Steve’s heart clenches at the sight of it.
Steve purses his lips, feigning consideration. “I mean, I’m not wrong.”
His heart leaps. “What does Johnny have to do—”
Steve’s eyes widen, his arms returning to his side. “Hate you? I never hated you, Tony.”
“Honey, I’ve been hearing this for twelve years. Don’t you think it’s time your old lady’s ears get a rest?”
“About what?”
Tony finds him sitting at the back, nursing a mug of coffee as he bows his head, doodling on a napkin.
“Shall I—”
The moon hangs high in the night sky, casting the music room with a silver glow. It takes Tony back to better nights, nights when he’d sit next to his mother as she fills the lonely mansion with song. Nights where Jarvis and Ana would join them with a tray of steaming tea and chocolate chip cookies. Nights when Tony’s heart settled for a brief moment.
They break up on a Tuesday, with the rain pelting the windowpane and the midnight silence stifling.
“You don’t kiss the waitresses at the diner when she gives you your coffee.”
Tonight, he is Tony Stark – billionaire and philanthropist. And he has people to schmooze for the good of charity. Tonight’s not about him.
“I…” He shakes his head, clearing his throat. “Tony’s not straight.”
“Then? What gave me away?”
Clint groans. “Okay, guys. Can you both
He’s angry at first. Of being lulled into a false sense of security. Letting every inch of him love and be loved when he was always second best.
“What?”
Frowning, Steve flips the envelope. What he sees makes his heart almost stop.
The living room looks as if a hurricane of Halloween decorations came through. A couple of skeletons with witch hats propped in a corner. A scattered bunch of paper black cats, spiders, and bats webbed to the walls to the carved pumpkins scattered everywhere. There’s even a large banner hanging over the fireplace with the words ‘Happy Halloween!’ printed in orange against a glitter black background.
Tony wrinkles his nose. “No thanks. You’re one of the last few people I’d fuck. Even if you’re the last person alive, I’d rather die of blue balls.”
“Of course she did.”
Of course Steve does. Every news outlet in the whole freaking world already told him.
“Do you really want me to say it?”
Tony twists his head to his side. It’s a little uncomfortable being inside Miles’ backpack, sandwiched between Miles’ Math homework and a tuna sandwich.
“How romantic.”
Steve nods tentatively. “But it’s fine if you don’t—”
“I don’t think I’ve seen a red velvet cookie before,” Tony says as he hands a five-dollar bill over to Steve.
Tony’s frown deepens.
“Yeah,” Tony echoes, his voice a murmur. He clears his throat, his eyes glancing away. It’s times like these that he’s glad he has his helmeted head screwed on. He doubts he could take Steve’s reactions to Tony’s expressions. “I wasn’t talking to you, by the way. I was talking to Peter.”
Heroes like Iron Man.
“The beard?”
Tony grins. “You draw me with kind eyes.”
“And?”
Love.
Steve raises an eyebrow. “Have I ever said anything I didn’t mean?”
“He lives in your tower.”
“I’m fine,” Steve says, batting Tony’s hand away. “The serum—”
“I do.” Steve shrugs. “But you like dancing. So…”
“What’s there to forgive?”
It’s glamorous and rich, the people dressed in silk and velvet and caviar and truffles being served. Steve has never felt so small.
“Why not?” Tony challenged back.
And just like that, Steve lights the dangerous spark called hope in Tony’s chest.
Steve’s nowhere in sight when Tony returns to their booth. He’s outside, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. His eyelids are shut, his head tilted upwards as a light breeze sweeps his hair back.
“I want to,” Steve says simply, nibbling on his toast.
Fortunately for them, Thor has enough energy to ease the flight over to the motel. The motel is a cozy little place with a diner attached to it. Steve and Natasha go to get their rooms while the rest of them head over to the diner.
Or at least, he’ll try. He'll learn to be happy for him.
“I know. Didn’t peg you as a coward.”
As Steve expects, Ma
Jokes that have some semblance of truth to them. A lot of truth to them. But still.
“Excuse me—”
Steve’s shoulders slump. “You should’ve seen them, Nat. They were so… so…”
Tony exhaled, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “Not the point. The point is, we should get married and—”
“We should wait for the storm to pass,” Natasha says.
Tony smirks, his eyes glued to Steve’s stomach. “Uh huh. Sure. C’mon. Hot dogs.”
God, how could he hate her? She’s so nice and sweet and caring and—
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers against her lips. “I can’t stop— I just can’t stop ruining things and—”
Clint pretends to gag. Thor slaps him on the back anyway, spraying the whole table with Clint’s mouthful of chocolate milkshake in the process.
Steve feels his cheeks color, shame washing over him. “I’m sorry for snapping at you.”
Tony’s eyes widen. “Really?”
It’s no surprise that Steve also happens to be the reason for his relapse.
Steve nods and oh god, he needs to stop. He is
Reed’s lips quirk to the side. “It’d be bad-mannered of me to not congratulate you. I’m sure Susan wouldn’t be happy with me if she knew.”
But the high wears off and Tony’s train of thought returns and all he can think of is his blond hair and soft smiles and softer touches and just like that, he breaks.
For the first time in a long time, Tony feels safe. Loved.
But what he’s surprised at is Tony’s smile.
It leaves Tony breathless every time.
“Brock’s ugly,” the boy replies before freezing. He looks like he broke the class' cookie jar. “I mean, I think he’s ugly. Only ugly people are mean.”
The interviewer raises her eyebrows. “Really?”
His crush is going to be standing in front of him in a second.
Tony shrugs, smiling anxiously. “Just hope it’ll go well.”
“Chickened out from what?”
Steve elects to watch him at first but eventually motions to join him, the tinkle of his keys melding with Tony’s timbre. At one point, he edges closer to Tony’s side, their fingers almost brushing.
An involuntary chuckle tumbles out of his lips as Steve shakes his head and turns away. He knows it’s a joke, meant to distract the both of them from their impending doom, but he couldn’t help but find the irony in it.
That’s when Steve realizes – Tony’s tapping his finger on his arc reactor, a tic he does when he’s nervous.
Steve smirks, leaning against his doorway with his arms across his chest. “You say this now but wait ‘till I drink all your blood.”
, he chides himself.
dating Steve? He’s pretty certain he isn’t. He’d know if they are. Steve’s as subtle as Doom is with his plans on conquering New York when it comes to well, anything.
But it’s all fine and dandy now. Steve has nothing holding him down anymore.
“Wow,” a stranger says, eyeing one of the paintings Steve made for his final project, “this looks amazing. I’ve never seen— Wow.”
“I mean, you could tell me…”
“Regardless, this isn’t a life or death situation. I can deal with the company and the press and—”
“We did not mean to be cruel,” Thor says. It’s the saddest he’s sounded in a long while.
Thor pouts but there’s a twinkle behind his eyes.
Steve peers at him, his fingers tightening around his whiskey glass. “Does he know?”
At that moment, Steve wishes he could love her. It would’ve been easier.
fault. Miles and Kamala for putting them in awkward situations, Tony for being an idiot, and Steve…
“Yeah,” he rasps. “I really do.”
“Still isn’t,” Clint pipes up.
“Uh huh,” she continues, flipping a pancake. “Sure. You’re definitely not embarrassed by little old Carol from Boston who’s—”
Protesting groans fill the common room.
Just like that, Steve’s taken back to a time when he was younger and kinder and learning about the planets and stars and the enigma named Tony Stark.
Steve couldn’t help but give himself a look too.
“Tony—”
Tony’s eyelids flutter, his expression still in disbelief. “I— I must be going deaf because it sounded like you just told me you’re in love with me. Which can’t be right because—”
eyes rove.
Tony scowls.
Steve does a double-take at that. In fact, everyone’s staring at Tony in puzzlement. Except for Natasha but that's hardly surprising. Nothing fazes her.
“Mm-hmm. A big difference.”
How could he forget?
Then, soft lips are on his.
Yup, this is bad. So very bad. He can’t afford to be tempted. Not now. Not when Hammer’s slimy arm is on him. Not when Hammer’s pungent breath is harsh on his cheek. Not when all Tony wants to do is
Steve’s lips quirk to the side. “I’m serious. You’re amazing. The best hero I know. No one else could compete with you.”
Steve couldn’t be jealous of Johnny Storm. He just couldn’t. Sure, he’d love to be on the other end of Tony’s sultry smiles and honeyed words and heated gazes but he can’t— He just can’t—
Tony drinks and drinks and drinks and hopes it’ll help him forget, one day.
Tony does, shy and guarded and nervous. Steve readies himself. He’s waited years for this moment. He needs Tony to know before they lose their breath, before he has to watch Tony die.
Steve pauses, glancing at the jar of cookies on top of the cake display. “Yeah. Ma thought it’ll be a hit during this time of the year.”
“And what makes you so sure he’s dating her?”
Tony’s lips quirk to the side, his eyes glinting under the ceiling lights. They’re so much prettier up close. So much prettier, holy shit. They're so
Tony glares up at the ceiling. “Didn’t I tell you to
“My mom loved everything about space,” Tony whispers as they watch planets and star clusters float above their heads. “When Howard wasn’t around and the skies were clear, my mom would take me outside. We have this telescope out back and she’d let me take a look. We’d just lie outside and stargaze and she’d tell me about them.”
Tony doesn't realize his body's shaking until a pair of arms snake around his waist, pulling him close.
“Any reason you’re playing tonight?”
“Hey—”
Thor brightens as he continues to stuff his face with Cheerios. “There was the once when we fought the Wrecking Crew and you said—”
Hank speaks after a tense pause. “Steve found out about the messages I sent to Monica about you. Before A-Day.”
And Tony and Carol.
The next morning is total chaos.
Steve nods, his heart skipping a beat. “I finally got you back.”
“And Johnny?”
“I hate you.”
“So, I got some bad news,” Steve says when he and Natasha return. He holds out three sets of keys. Tony feels the dread coursing through him.
Endgame Tony who seems to have Steve wrapped around his tiny,
Kamala sags her shoulders in relief. “Gosh, you don't know how relieving it is to hear that. Thank you so much, Tony. You know you didn’t have to do all that for me. I’m just one person.”
If only he could bury his nose in Tony’s damp hair, take in the fresh scent of apples, or trail his fingers down the nape of Tony’s—
Steve happened to be the reason Tony has been sober for seven years.
Because this proposition could be a joke. Must be a joke. Tony must be treating this as a joke, or at the very least, a half-heated promise offered as an odd way to comfort. He might not mean anything by it. After all, who offers to marry their best friend just because he’s lonely?
Instead, he says, “That’s the thing. It’s not the thought of us dating bugs me because fuck, I’d break a limb to even hold your hand and kiss you and I just hate that you’ve been going around waxing poetic about me like I’m your boyfriend because I’m not your boyfriend and this whole relationship shtick is a shtick because Hammer blabs and everyone will have our asses if they know you’d lie. And sure, maybe some people would have the common sense to not listen to that idiot but he has friends who are idiots too. And don’t get me started on the press. Why the fuck did you say that in the first place? Why the fuck you would say that and wax poetic about me when I’m in love with you—”
A harsh laugh escapes his lips. “They sure are. How long?”
Tony blinks, unsure what to make of the steel in Steve’s voice. “We’re toys.”
Tony pauses, looking contemplative. “We do half of the work. And then order takeout.”
God. Someone end him now.
Natasha doesn’t even look up from her book to acknowledge him. “Don’t worry. I have just the person in mind.”
“Then you’ll get nothing.”
For a moment, Tony pretends that he’s on one of his adventures with Steve at his side. That he and Steve have decided to seek refuge in a cave for the night. That Steve is quietly going over the events of the day next to him and not polishing a shield. That Steve isn’t bulky and cold and square.
Something crosses Steve’s face but it’s gone before Tony could dwell on what it is. But even with a glimpse, he has his suspicions. He hates himself for making it surface.
There’s nothing special about Tony’s outfit (sweatshirt, dark jeans, and a pair of high-tops). In fact, it's a getup he's seen on him many times before. Yet Steve’s heart stutters as if he’s seeing him for the first time. At this rate, his heart is going to give out before he could take Tony out.
“Tony!”
“It’s dishonorable!”
“You do have something over him,” Steve says.
Maybe in another life, Sharon and him would’ve worked out. Maybe in another life, Steve’s feelings for Tony wouldn’t overwhelm his feelings for Sharon.
“Mm-hmm.”
Endgame Tony who’s currently making Steve smile like the sun and howl with laughter like a hyena.
“Hey,” Tony says, grinning. “You cleaned up nicely.”
nickname.”
Tony lifts his head up, his smile gentle and broad. He’s staring at Steve in awe, like he’s everything he’s ever wanted in his life. Steve loves and hates him in this moment.
“I’m people.”
Tony blinks, feeling stupid. “You were jealous.”
Oh god.
That grabs Tony’s attention, turning as Steve speaks. Steve almost wavers at the sight of Tony’s face.
Maybe his feelings aren’t as unrequited as Steve thought they’d be. Maybe Natasha was right. Maybe Steve has been jumping to conclusions. Maybe Carol and Tony are just friends.
No one should look this good after five years. No one should look like a lumberjack and still look this good after five goddamn years.
“Of course not. Why would I want a break from my boyfriend?” Tony scoffs before barking out a laugh that’s hopefully not bitter. “Oh wait. You’re not. Ha. Silly me. Silly joke.”
“You falling out of love with me. When?”
Despite opting out of Operation: Get Tony To Stop Moping By Finding Him True Love, his friends insist on Steve being at every single meeting of theirs. Apparently since he's the leader of the Avengers and the operation is a team matter, he has to be present.
This is how Tony comes back.
They’re quiet as they navigate the streets and the crowds. New York City has always been a place Tony has both loved and despised, full of shadows and ghosts. But he won’t deny that it’s a place where he can just
Tony knows he’s saying more, probably trying to let him down gently. Telling him it’s all Steve’s fault. Telling him they’re truly better off this way.
waitresses ‘sweetheart’.”
He can do this. He recovered from a broken heart countless times. He can do it again.
For some reason, Steve’s smile slips off his face, his lips flattening. “Oh. Do you want me to—”
As fun as it is to see what the Tower looks like if it was built with plastic bricks, Tony can’t help but turn away whenever Lego Steve and Tony flirt or happily bicker. Even the Funkos seem to join in, noisily chattering in that gibberish they use to communicate. Funkolish or whatever.
, Tony finishes and Steve does everything he can to not cry.
“Lead the way, mon Capitaine.”
Steve frowns. “How do you know that?”
Steve promptly signs up for the army. When Tony finds out, he’s livid.
Tony frowns, glancing around the room. “Huh,” he says, tossing his wrench up in the air. “Yeah, where did everyone go?”
. “Jesus, what can you
He doesn’t recognize who it is. Though then again, whoever it is has their back towards him, too focused on cooking what smells like pancakes. The only thing he could register is that the stranger’s dressed in a T-shirt that’s a size too big for their frame and golden blonde hair that comes up to their shoulders.
She always has the prettiest smiles.
“It’s nothing bad. It’s just…” Steve flushes a deep crimson. “It’s kind of embarrassing.”
“Do you want to watch the sunset with me?”
“I guess so, yeah.”
“We’re flirts, Steve,” he points out. “And single. Single flirts like us communicate by flirting. Sides, Johnny was just playing with you.”
Tony quirks his lips. “Even when I was in my fuckboy phrase?”
There’s thunderous applause when Steve finishes his speech. It's a feat considering the space in the hangar. Unsurprising considering he’s Captain fucking America. Even if he isn’t, Steve has a knack for having people hanging onto his every word.
Tony gets sent to a prestigious boarding school, gets himself expelled after some time, comes home to yelling and Steve.
“Wow. Some best friend you are.”
“Steve—”
Just like that, Steve feels both stupid and stupidly hopeful at the same time.
“You’re already dead.”
Steve’s eyes twinkle in mirth.
“Come back,” he whispers as Tony ascends and disappears.
Steve makes a mental note to ask after their relationship later.
Miles’—
Steve just breaks into laughter and takes him around, rambling about each piece in embarrassment and love. Tony lets him. It feels like old times.
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “If you ask me, you joined in the moment you shoved me. So you have no one to blame but yourself. Sides’, I’m sober and voluntary. You’re sober and voluntary. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” He pauses. “Okay, not exactly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity since alcohol and I are done and all that. But you get what I mean.”
“Downstairs,” Steve replies, leading him to the elevator. “We’re gonna have a pizza party. JARVIS?”
“No, no! It’s wonderful.”
Steve huffs. “Well, maybe if you’d let me admit I was jealous without being a dick about it—”
Steve drops the test tube in his grasp.
The thing about being fake engaged while living with friends is that they have to share the same living space.
“Nonsense!” Thor cries gleefully. “It’s not every day that the good Captain Rogers willingly volunteers to participate in an arm-wrestling competition!”
“I—” Tony racks his brain, trying to recall something. Anything.
“Got room for one more?” Tony asks, sounding amused. Just the sound of his voice settles Steve.
Steve starts a jaunty tune Tony doesn't recognize, with finger work as grand and complicated as the shit Tony just pulled. He doesn’t mess up one bit.
“No, of course not. I just thought that we’ve been walking for so long—”
“I can’t speak on sir’s feelings,” JARVIS replies. “But if I have to guess, I'd say yes.”
“I can do fun,” Steve mutters to himself as he towels his damp hair, heading for the bedroom door. “I can be fun. I can—”
“Please. You always act weird whenever Johnny’s around, even during fights.” Tony exhales, running his fingers through his hair. “Look, I know it might be weird having someone who looks exactly like you running about—”
Steve bristles as Bobbi returns his flirtation with ease. She isn’t special for owning a motorcycle or decking out in a leather jacket of her own, on top of the leather fingerless gloves and matching boots she has on. Steve rides a motorcycle, a Harley-Davidson in fact. And he wears leather jackets. He'll definitely wear them more often next time.
“Steve, I—” Tony sighs, wiping his face with his hand. “What about the team? Shouldn’t they know?”
Maybe that’s why their friends and some of the press always thought they were a thing. Maybe that’s why Fury barely bats an eyelid at the news.
No. It can't be. There's no way. There's no way he could be —
“I know,” Tony replies, a smirk playing on his lips and a twinkle behind his eyes. “I read your diary.”
Tony blanches. “No.”
Tony shouldn't be upset. It’s not like Steve and Tony are dating, let alone in love, in Steve’s case. Their relationship's built on casual sex and friendship. Nothing more. Tony's long accepted the fact he's meant to be a placeholder for the person who would heal Steve's lonely heart.
much. There’s not a day that goes by that Tony doesn’t wonder at the what-ifs – what if Steve wasn’t besotted with Bucky freaking Barnes who is insignificant in other media and not the MC-freaking-U, what if Disney and Marvel had competent writers who know their own lore, what if Tony wasn’t such a big idiot pining over someone he can’t have, just like he was in the movie.
As soon as the doors shut behind him, the energy vibrating in him seeps out of him. Tony sags against the wall, heaving a sigh as the back of his head bumps against it.
Tony scoffs. “And you call me a narcissist.”
Especially Steve.
