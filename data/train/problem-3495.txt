“Touché,” Dean conceded. “But, still. Cas, I only had the guts to tell you about Sam because I knew— you’d already written about the rest of my history with such understanding, you know? You made me sound like some kind of hero even in spite of it all, and you didn’t judge any of us. I’ve never— the only people who know this shit and still like me are the people who were there when it happened, and they mostly missed the worst parts. You—you’ve been through shit of your own and so have the characters you write, and yet you still manage to see the good in people. I knew I could trust you before I confided, so don’t make that sound like some huge risk.”
Soon.
Laughing, Cas turned off the music and followed Dean inside, shutting out the sound of Rufus’s snores with the sliding glass door. As silently as possible, they moved the night stand out from between their beds, and slid them together. There wasn’t much to be done about the individual bed linens without waking the rest of the house, but it was still an improvement, anyway.
Castiel
“Nice air quotes, Cas,” Dean laughed.
Okay, yeah, Cas is a little nervous, but he’s trying not to be ridiculous about it.
“Yeah, well, I wasn’t counting on them deciding to throw the damn wedding together so fucking fast. Everyone else these days stays engaged for at least a year or two, but not Sammy. No, he had to get married just a couple months later. And if I’d told him after the engagement buzz wore off, you know he’d still be moping about it now.”
to me like that since I first read
“You’re doing this on purpose,” Dean accused.
“Awesome,” Dean declares. “We were just about to put in the food order. You know what you want from The Roadhouse?”
Please allow me to explain myself. I must admit that when I wrote to you on Monday morning I was rather upset. With the benefit of hindsight, I feel quite foolish for having been so, but embarrassment cannot scrub the feeling from my past, I’m afraid. It bubbled up and weighed on me as I wrote and posted what I assumed would be my final letter, and it only began to dissipate as I packed my car to leave for my new home downstate.
Cas thought his head might explode. How on Earth had Dean Winchester, of all people, thought of him as a high school degree of ‘cool’. Finally, he found his words. “You’re one to talk, mister baseball-star-musician-honor-roll-popular-kid. I once heard two of the hottest girls in my grade refer to you as ‘the only younger guy they’d ever even consider banging’.”
“Ouch,” Laurie interjected from her lounging spot next to Cas. “Sounds like you got the better end of that deal, in the end.”
Oh, hell no. This song was even worse.
To wake on Sunday and find Dean still there, breathing softly against Castiel’s neck, was a hell of a thing. He had rolled closer in the night, very nearly falling into the crack between the two beds. But his presence was warm and solid pressed along Cas’s side, far too present to be the product of a dream. Even at half awake, Cas’s smile was painfully wide.
"I AM AWAKE!" I ran out the door and was surprised to find Lisa sitting outside on her phone. I squealed when I felt Dean's strong arms grip me and drag me back to his room.
“You do?” Cas gasped and dropped the blanket. He looked at me like I was the most extraordinary thing in the entire world. His hand brushed through his soft and messy dark hair.
He awoke to a loud thump on his table, his head shooting up as he grabbed the nearest person by the collar and pinned them down on his table. He awoke from his daze and looked around at his surroundings, realizing that he had Castiel pinned down to the table and his books on the desk next to him. Castiel tried getting out of Dean’s grip but ultimately failed considering he couldn’t exactly figure out what position he was in. Dean let go of Novak and sneered at him, upset that he was disturbed from his beauty sleep, heaven knows he wanted it. Castiel hit Dean across the back of the head and sat down on the chair belonging to the desk next to Dean, organizing his books and pulling out his notebook. Dean decided to follow suit and do the same, grabbing his books, notebook, pencils, pens, highlighters, and eraser. He wondered what Castiel Novak was doing sitting next to him but decided not to question it knowing that the boy was filled with mystery.
“Fuck,” Dean breathed out, running his hands through his hair. His once joyous eyes now dim from remorse, shooting a glare at Gabe.
I ran upstairs to Luc's room first and set up the trap. I spread lines all over his room to make sure that I could get Luc good. Once I was done, I left him his own little treat. I snickered as I snuck off to Balthy and Sam's room. I set up some sugar bombs for them to wake up to along with a chopped rotten fish in the curtain pole. They'd never find it there and it would take them a while to realize what was hiding in their room. I ran back over to the kitchen and I made sure to neatly place all of the stink bombs that would take a bit to be set off.
I looked around at my surroundings and realized I had fallen asleep on the couch in my- mine and Cas' apartment. I hadn't heard anything from the hospital and I still don't know what happened once I got pushed out. All I know is that I heard it loud and clear and I made sure to get my final words through to Cas. I hope he heard them. I miss him.
He found a nice shaded area that seemed to be alright for his baby. He knew that she deserved a much better spot, however, this seemed to be the best one and it would have to do. He grabbed his bags and hopped out of the car, making sure to lock the impala before making his way towards his school. He adjusted his flannel and leather jacket as he approached the doors, he wasn’t quite sure he was ready for another day of learning and school gossip paired with the good old drama, but it would have to do.
“Okay, maybe that’s not what he said.”
"Alright," I chuckle to myself thinking about all the mischief these guys can cause.
“Yes? Oh- I mean, if that’s alright with you,” Dean said, I could hear sadness in his tone and I did not want to make him anything but happy.
I glanced back curiously eyeing at the curtains surrounding the mystery man. I continued on my way to the restroom and had a difficult time getting the door to open with my limping leg. Meg stifled her laugh as she came over and helped me push the door open. The inside of the bathroom was much different from the room.
“Cas!?” Dean exclaimed, running over and picking me up. He looked into my eyes and I felt guilty for all the concern and worry that clouded his gaze.
I got out to check and realized that I hit Sammy. Though he is a tough one, I still don’t want to risk anything. I’ll just take him to the hospital and we can clear the rest up later. Sammy shot back up into the air with an “I’m alright!” but that didn’t work for me and he was going to sit his ass down on that hospital bed and get checked even if that meant sedating him to do so.
Castiel nodded. “The first draft manuscript. I was in town with Missouri today to sign the paperwork for a publishing deal. They gave me a generous advance, so that money won’t set me back, really. Sarah and her team will be going through that draft with her people, and I’m sure it’ll get ripped to shreds, but I wanted you to have it.”
At this, Sam finally looked up, the ghost of his ‘concerned brother’ look crossing his face. “Well, Dean is.”
They all did their best to keep Sam laughing, as he fretted over whether he had adequately memorized his vows, but when Mary materialized on the porch, clad in a gorgeous floral sundress, the need for distraction evaporated. Sam was just as tearful as his proud Mother, and it was time to start the ceremony. They headed downstairs, past the crowd of guests who had been ushered toward their seats by Charlie and Sonya, and took their positions to begin the ceremony.
No need to ask Cas twice. “Sure.”
“Well, that’s the polite version,” Cas answered, his smile utterly wicked now. “She tried to send you something else, but I circled back to leave it at home. I didn’t want it accidentally getting mixed in with the wedding presents. One of Jess’s grandparents might have had a heart attack.”
sorry for letting it go this far. I just—” He stopped himself, then, and changed tack. “That story? ‘The Society for Wayward Daughters’? I— I had been in a fog for ages, Cas. Probably since Sam left. But then Grandpa died, and Aaron and I broke up, and I was suddenly here in this huge house all on my own feeling completely lost. Reading your story was the first thing that brought me out of that at all. I was crying laughing at their antics, and little Hael reminded me of how Sam was when we finally got off the road to live with Bobby and I just… Nothing had, you know,
“Chuck…” there was no response, he cried, “why? Did you write this in your book, to make me suffer.”
“No, no either way Death would’ve come for me… Cas died to save me, and I can't forgive myself for that. I am so stupid how did I not know that he made a deal with the empty.”
"Alright..." Sam mumbled as Dean turned and walked out the broken door.
He started to punch the rough brick wall. He exhaled with aggression, “damn it! Why does this have to happen to me? Why do I have to lose the ones I love? Over and over, I’ve lost everyone! Why chuck? You made me watch as Cas died so many times, again and again. I found Charlie dead in a bathtub! How is any of this okay?” His hand was red; before he knew anything his hand was covered in his own blood. It ached but Dean, he didn’t mind the pain, at least he wasn’t numb… He wanted to feel happy again, he wanted to be with Cas again. He walked over to his drawer grabbing a rag wiping the blood from his hand. He then went to look under his bed searching for his shoe box. He took the box sliding it out from under the bed. He opened the lid looking for the photos and miscellaneous things people had given him. He found a photo of Cas in the cowboy hat, smiling Dean set it on the table.
I suppose what I’ve found most fascinating about all this is how tightly one’s emotional turmoil can tie in with one’s writing. Perhaps that seems obvious, and on some level, I’ve been aware of it for ages. If we write about what we know, then what we don’t know will also appear in the margins— our fears in the voids between words, our opinions in the arcs and turns that a story takes as it progresses. The choices a character makes must reflect something upon the heart of the author, even if there is no active correlation between them at all. Even if the something that is reflected is that the author abhors that character’s choices.
Dean shrugged uncomfortably. “I got a little jealous. I do that sometimes, I guess. And then I bailed. I do that too, honestly.”
Cas grinned at her. “Oh, I most certainly did. You’d be surprised how your sex life opens up once you have ‘naked midnight serenade’ in your bag of tricks.” Then he turned toward Charlie and Jo to ensure they were ready, and strummed the opening chords to “Closer to Fine”.
Dean looked uncomfortable, and Cas could feel dread rising in his throat like tears. Wrong call, an alarm blared in his head. He had to get away, so he made to stand up, trying to sound casual and no doubt missing by miles. “Well, I—”
Mary threw up her hands. “I swear. If he throws his damn back out again over an extra $30 a night, I will wring his neck.”
Confused? Well, so was I.
Cas’s mind was awhirl, trying desperately to concoct a way out of this mess. But suddenly Dean squared his shoulders and made it unnecessary.
Cas ventured a tentative guess. “Not looking forward to it, so much?”
Mid turn, Dean halts, listens, and nods. “Okay. But still. I appreciate this. And I owe you one.”
Cas nodded, wondering if she had any clue how deeply he agreed with that particular sentiment. Then he bit the bullet and asked the million-dollar question. “Are Lisa and Dean already here, then?”
Cas himself dove into the crowd with great interest. Crowds weren’t always his favorite, but this one was wonderfully varied, an odd mix of old friends from Lawrence, new acquaintances from the weekend’s festivities, and fresh faces he had never met and might never again after today. He met a number of people about whom he had been hearing stories for years, including Pamela Barnes, Sam’s NA sponsor. She was a delight to speak with, and spent about a quarter of an hour talking to him about her work as a tattoo artist, overtly trying to convince Cas to finally take the plunge on that rib tattoo he had been considering. He re-introduced himself to Sam’s college friend Jake, who was now working in internet marketing and offered his services to Castiel’s business. He even reconnected with Jody Mills and Donna Hascum, Lawrence locals who had been good friends of his mother’s before her death. Sam had tutored their foster daughter, Claire, when he had taken his year off from college, and they were proud to share that his mentorship had helped steer Claire in a new direction. She had just finished her second year studying Psychology at Kansas State, and was apparently volunteering this summer at a women’s shelter, hoping to one day specialize in addiction recovery and domestic violence prevention.
Mary Winchester’s hug was impossibly tighter even than Charlie’s had been, though less aggressive. She embraced him for a long time before leaning back to look him up and down. “Ellen,” she called, “bring this boy a cupcake, will you? You look like you could use a sugar boost after that long drive.”
So, Archangel, as completely insane as I’m sure this sounds, I will have to decline your offer. I think I need to make my own way from here, helped in no small part by the generosity you have already offered through the scholarship. I think I shall enjoy tutoring, if I can make that work, and I firmly believe there is much to be learned from such a vocation, which reminds one of the varied views and stories and experiences of the world. If I can be useful to others and learn in my own right, that’s really all I can ask. And if the path I end up taking differs from this vision, then so be it. I am ready to be a member of the world at large, whatever that might mean.
“Yes it is,” says a voice behind Dean.
If you were hoping these letters would focus on me simply relaying what I’m working on, well, I think we’ve already established that’s not my inclination. Unless you decide to object, I would prefer to keep the details of that largely within the walls of this building for the time being. I’d rather not send you awkward synopses of the short stories I’ve been playing with when I could send you the finished product in the future. Would you like that? I’d certainly enjoy sending them to you, once they are complete to my satisfaction, if you’d be amenable. It would feel like having a confidante, a parent even. Or grandparent—my (woefully incomplete) mental image of you seems to waffle back and forth between a strong middle age and a distinguished 70+. (I must confess, it also cannot decide whether you are only partially or entirely bald, and I hope that does not offend you too terribly. I have very little to go on, you understand, and “Smith” offers me precisely zero clues.)
“Oh!” She said, clearly quite startled. Then, in the blink of an eye, her surprise morphed into recognition, followed inexplicably by something like panic. Her eyes were very wide.  “
Can you see why I’m excited? Perhaps not. Perhaps this seems like the sort of thing that should be daunting, since it so fully pushes me outside my personal writer-box and casually brushes away fear. But, Archangel, I cannot think of a better place on Earth to take such a wild departure. At The Garden my time is my own to try and fail over and over again as much as I wish. My audience is a group of likeminded writers committed to doing exactly the same, and ready to help me learn from every failure without judging me for taking the risk in the first place. I can break down barriers all I want, and even if I tear myself to pieces in the process, I have people here I can trust to help me glue myself back together. There is nothing as thrilling to me as that, honestly, and I cannot wait to see what happens.
“Well,” Dean finally says, looking away, but seeming to very casually keep Cas in his periphery. “I certainly didn’t expect to see you back around here.” There’s a breath’s pause – the sort that takes physical shape. The sort that is really a precipice. Dean barrels on, with only the tiniest tension trapped in his muscles, poised to spring back up the hill if he must. “And I certainly didn’t expect you to be about 50 times hotter. That was definitely a surprise.”
Everyone laughed as she rose to go check on her fiancé, but Cas was instantly distracted by Mary next to him, who was tearing up. At Cas’s questioning look, Mary whispered, “already one of the family,” clearly touched deeply by Jess’s easy acceptance. Then she tossed an arm over Cas’s shoulders in a quick squeeze and asked, “how do you like your new sister, Castiel?”
The Roadhouse is a Bar-and-Grill-style establishment tucked away in a fairly quiet corner of East Jordan. The proprietor, one Ellen Harvelle, is an absolute joy, though she would hate that I refer to her as such. She is the sort of person who hides her thoughtful kindness behind a gruff, occasionally combative exterior; strong by necessity but with the very best of intentions. She seems to appreciate my blunt, mission-oriented nature, as well, and realized far more quickly than most that my focus does not come at the expense of feeling. It can put people off, you see, the seriousness with which I seem to take everything, my subtle facial expressions, my sarcastic responses. But Ellen clocked on to the truth of it all immediately, and seems to have taken it as reason to adopt me into her little family without further question. I’m quite flattered by her easy acceptance, truly.
And I suppose I’ve been dancing around the truth of this, haven’t I? The fact is, I was hurt on Sunday evening. My classmates all welcomed people they loved to our commencement ceremony— even Krissy, who invited up some college friends. And while there were people there that I knew, people who were proud of my accomplishments, none of them had come for me, specifically. Dean came to support his cousin, and Balthazar was there for Meg, and there was no one I could claim solely for myself.
The teasing must have landed just as intended, because Dean smirked.
When he could breathe, Cas replied, “Sort of a creepily appropriate song for this moment, isn’t it?”
In December, when you sent me the phone, you must have gotten an idea of my irregularity in this area. At the time, I attributed my disquiet to the specific gift at hand; an item I deemed a luxury, coming from a relative stranger for no apparent reason. I ultimately allowed myself to be talked into accepting this gift when I was made to see that it is not so much a luxury as a modern necessity for a working professional. The unlimited data you paid for was rather excessive, but the phone itself is a tool of my trade, at least on the business side. It is, effectively, a horrifically expensive school supply, and through this lens I could justify it, understand why you wanted me to have it, and see its function toward my professional growth.
Cas had a sudden, vivid flash of a memory: 18-year-old Dean, freshly graduated from high school, sitting in the passenger seat of this very car, belting at the top of his lungs, “Look around, round, round! Dear Prudence, let me see you smile…”
who have known loneliness,
In the end, it looked like Jess’s fears had been unfounded: as far as Cas could see, Grandma Esther spent much of the evening engaged in delighted conversation with Rick and his own mother, who Jess and her sisters insisted on calling “Grandma Barb” despite her fairly recent introduction into their lives. It warmed Cas’s heart to see these people work so hard to be good to each other. The Moores, he felt, were a damn inspiration.
A large factor in my emotional upheaval was almost certainly a reflection of the younger children’s goodbyes. Little Alfie, who is only seven, but has been on the farm for several years, was especially distraught at my departure. His tears will be branded in my mind’s eye forever, I think. He has seen far too much in his young life, and it nearly broke me to leave him behind. But leave I did, with a promise to write him constantly for as long as he wishes. I absolutely sped away once I had entered the car, but had to pull over as soon as I lost sight of the farm to compose myself. Having never had a breakdown like this, I was unnerved, but I suppose the catharsis was needed. It’s hard to start a new chapter without turning the page, no?
“You seriously think I’m going to just hand you my Baby’s keys after you dinged her door and tried to lie about it?”
“Anyway.” Dean shook himself a little, as if returning to a point. “That’s one of my favorite memories. To this day. Just you and me, floating on the lake, getting horribly sunburned and talking about…whatever.”
Speaking of my own impertinence, I am going to have to begin by breaking one of your rules. I simply cannot accept a gift of this magnitude without thanking you for choosing to bestow your generosity upon me, particularly. You must understand: with this remarkable scholarship, you have done far more than provide me the means to attend a once in a lifetime post-graduate program. At the same time, you have freed me from what might have become an impossible situation. If this were the Regency Period, I expect Jane Austen would say you’ve “given me prospects”. As it is, I shall instead say that you have given me hope.
“How’s yours, by the way,” Cas asks, remembering the younger boy who had run around with them now and again when they were young. “Sam, right?”
Dean was nodding like a bobble head, eyes still wide. “Well, fuck.”
Dean looked at Cas thoughtfully, seemingly battling with a decision of his own. “I’m glad Lisa wasn’t here.”
the lack
Dean’s back to gazing, but Cas doesn’t flinch. “I didn’t even know you remembered me when you came back senior year.”
“Mom,” Dean continued, looking apologetic again, but firmly resolved. “He needed to be able to talk to his Best Man throughout this whole process. I couldn’t risk him being afraid to say the word ‘love’ in front of me.”
“Why are you in my bed?”
Cas let out a sigh of his own. “Dean, we’ve been over this.”
Clearing his throat, Dean answered, “Yeah, sure.”
By dawn, we were beginning to nod off and agreed that we should call it a night. Or, perhaps, a day. A morning. We didn’t really get into the semantics, honestly. There were tears to wipe away and hugs to he had and piles of scribbled notes to gather together. There were ideas taking root that can build only in dreams. And, in my case, there was a letter to finish.
Intrigued, Cas declared, “Not necessarily. Why?”
Castiel just blinks at him, very confused. Dean stares back, perplexed in his own right, apparently by this reaction. After a drawn out moment, he clarifies.
Dean paused with his hand on the doorknob. “Uh, Cas? Would you mind keeping this to yourself, just through the reception? This Lisa thing? I’m planning to tell Mom and Dad and the crew once the happy couple leaves for the honeymoon, and then spill to Sam after he’s gotten back and shown us all his pictures a few hundred times.”
“Oh my gosh, I forgot,” Cas mouthed at me, turning his head so Sam and I could see.
“The hell you are! You just went flying off your bed and you want to tell me that you’re fine! You’re damn lip is bleeding and you’ve got new bruises all over you! They ‘aint all that visible yet but just you wait! Castiel Novak, if you need your food why don’t you just ask me next time,” Dean hollered . I knew he was hurting, I could read him better than anyone else could.
*TRIGGER WARNING*
Dean and Cas were waiting for us in the 1967 Chevy Impala that Dean praised so much. We made our way to school and most of the way Gabe was giggling. He said something about hair dye and the water fountains. I didn't pay much attention to what he said and only picked up on some keywords. One thing is for sure, I'm definitely not having a drink from any of them any time soon.
Cas tilted his head before responding, “I guess it would be like riding on a road you know best. The breeze brushing against you face, hair flying in the wind, sun kissing your skin, and a warm smile because you know exactly where it’s going to take you and yet you don’t know at the same time.”
“There’s not much to tell,” Dean responded before grabbing some chocolate covered strawberries and popping them into his mouth.
“Straight as my parking skills.” Cas laughed and Dean smiled.
“I can tell.” Castiel grinned.
“Not true!” I interjected.
"GABE!" Luc yelled
“Well, although he fought for their rights, his family had owned slaves as well and he didn’t exactly treat all his followers kindly. Hence the assasination attempt before the one that went successful when a woman stabbed him in the chest with a seven inch letter opener. He partook in adultery and he may even be an accomplice to sexual assault. Or what about the fact that he abused women? Are we going to ignore the FBI report that says he laughed and offered advice as he watched  his friend forcing a woman into intercourse? So many good things are said about Martin Luther King Jr. and yet the bad is never exposed into the light, why?” Dean said, as he looked, and met his teacher’s gaze, holding it for a moment before his professor tore away.
“Thank you,” Cas smiled, clearly pleased by my response.
“Do you want to test that theory?” I challenged him.
Walking through the doors, Dean Winchester spotted Castiel Novak, his enemy and worst nightmare. He groaned, watching Novak turn his head to look at him, their eyes meeting each other’s. Castiel smiled, winking at Dean Winchester before turning back around and holding his hand behind his back. Dean’s eyes trailed down to look at Castiel’s hands, rolling his eyes when he saw that he flipped him off. He walked passed the man, flicking him on the side of the head before making his way to class. He plopped in his chair and dropped his bag next to his seat, waiting for his professor to walk through the doors and announce the beginning of class. Dean always flew through this class because it was easy as pie, better than a piece of cake. He folded his arms over the table and rested his head, eventually growing tired and falling asleep.
*TRIGGER WARNING END*
"Cas, I don't want you to go and this is your house. This is your home," Dean cut me off.
"Dean," my voice cracked as I struggled to speak. I wanted to tell Dean that I was going to move out.  I just couldn't handle the visits with Lisa and the plans that kept getting canceled. I wanted my best friend back and it was at this moment that I wish I never figured out in the first place. Maybe if I didn't, Dean would still be close to me. Maybe, Dean would still hang out with me like we did before. It wasn't that we were growing apart but it was that he was spending less and less time with me and more and more time with her. When she wasn't here, we spent our time together, we baked, we played, we laughed, and joked. Although it was fun when we did get our time together, I just wish it could be like before. Maybe I was being selfish but a week had passed and I was getting exhausted. I was tired of Lisa coming over constantly and acting like she owned the place.
"She's great. She's pretty and kind and caring. She has a wonderful personality and seems to really love you." I blurted out. I didn't mean most of what I had said but I said it anyway. I wanted to make Dean happy even if that meant putting myself down.
“Don’t go about mixing yourself up with me,” I laughed before settling down again, my ribs hurting from the amount of air I was inhaling and exhaling.
“Dean! Where have you been! Boy! I’m talking to you! I come home today and I hear that you ain’t been staying with the Novak’s. At least your brother can listen to me! That kid is a good kid unlike you and I am sick and tired of your bull..”
I tried to run. I tried to get away but he just grabbed my other arm. He pulled me in close to his chest and I let out an ugly sob. I cried into him until I heard the bell ring. I pulled away from him and saw the sympathy in his eyes.
*End of trigger warning*
"No! I'm sorry, I was just surprised by the question. I didn't really know about her. I just found out last night." I mentally slapped myself for being so awkward. Dean shifted in his seat and the silence was biting at me.
“I feel like Dean should talk to her,” Cas said, turning to look at me, “you should talk to her.”
“Gabe, he isn’t here,” Sam looked up at me and just by the sound of his voice I could tell he missed Gabe.
I woke up to the wonderful smell of freshly baked pancakes. I wandered into the kitchen after my shower while I clumsily threw my clothes on. I sat down at the table admiring Dean from afar. Once he turned around my eyes flickered to the pan in his hand. I laughed as I thought about Gabe.
It didn't matter anymore, what had happened. We wouldn’t have to deal with her again anyways, or at least that’s what we thought.
She chuckled and shook her head with a grin spread on her face.
“Hey Charlie! What’s up?” Dean asked her, grabbing her bag off her shoulders and throwing it on his. Dean knew the girl was strong but he couldn’t help himself, he did the same with Sam and it always seemed to get on his nerves but Charlie didn’t seem to mind. She smiled at him gratefully before motioning towards her phone.
As much as I love you Dean, I think this would be my end. I'm sorry I never got to tell you just how much I love you. I'm sorry I never told you that it's my fault. All of it. How you grew up. How horrible everyone was to you. It was all my fault. I know your dad was cruel and people bullied you and everything but I'm the one that spilled the beans. I'm the one that told everyone one was a drunken abuser. I'm the one that told everyone you're- or at least you thought you were- bisexual. I'm the one that screwed up your life and I think deep down inside you know that. I think that's why when I moved with you to the next school you didn't question it. Everyone always made jokes that I was your little puppy. When people talked to me they always said I was your friend. It was never the other way around. You were never my friend. I was your friend. That's how everyone saw it. You have seen a lot- more than a kid ever should- growing up. You've been through a lot and I know it's been hell. I'm sorry your life turned into hell because of me. I loved you and I always have. When I first met you, I looked up at you and thought you were like the sky. You weren't the sun but you were more. You were the sun, the clouds, the moon, the stars, all of it. You had your ups and downs just like the clouds. You had your bright times where you shined like the sun. You had your quiet days like the moon. You were just my everything and yet my nothing all at once. I didn't know at first- that I love you- I didn't realize it. I thought I just admired you- that I wanted to be you. I looked up to you and did everything you did but then I realized I didn't want to be you, I wanted to be with you. That's when everything changed. I think... I think that's when I started to distance myself from you. It was never you. You didn't push me away. I pushed you away and it hurt you like hell. I could see it in your eyes, I could read you like the sky. The clouds were coming in and they were dark and the load was suddenly too much for them. The water started pouring out and the sky was dark and the moon barley shined through. The sun wasn't visible during the day and it seemed like things were never going to clear up. Then, I talked to you again, and the skies cleared up just enough to have a rainbow shine through- I think that's when your world changed.
"Hey, is everything okay?" Dean looked into my eyes clearly concerned. I felt my legs grow weak and my head started hurting. I started getting dizzy and sick to my stomach and almost backed out. What if this was what was going to split us apart? What if this was going to drive us apart?
“Ooo, I see. Drama, drama, drama, scary llama,” Meg whistled.
"Why I called you Bee today," Dean smiled up at me and I couldn't help but return the smile. His beautiful freckles were dazzling in the room.
“I’m not backing out!”
"Stop! You're going to leave a mark!" Luc pushed Gabe's hand off of him and Gabe rolled off the bed and out the door.
“Anyways, I’ll talk to Dean later. It’s alright, Cas. I know you still care and we will keep in contact. Alright?” Meg smiled at Cas, “You have my number, give it to Dean too.”
Oh. My. Jack. I forgot about Lisa. Oh my gosh! I forgot to call Adam! I lifted my head up from Cas’ chest, careful not to be too rough. I placed a small kiss on his chin before setting my head back down on Cas’ cozy chest. I kissed his warm chest softly.
“Okay, yea. You’re right,” Dean let out a weak smile, “I love you both.”
“Alright, that’s enough,” Charlie said, pausing what we were watching. “So, I’m going to be honest. The only reason I’m here is to let you guys know that y’all better get better soon because there is a party coming up and it’s going to be epic.”
“No, that’s not what I-” Ana started.
I have struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now. Self harm and suicidal thoughts were a horrible side effect to that. A little more sadness wouldn't cause much more harm than has already been done. I've been abused, neglected, bullied, hurt, and so much more.
“Oh yea, it’s not like we can just change your rooms and monitors for a breakup,” Meg said, stating the obvious.
"Hey," I placed my finger under his chin and used it to make him look at me, "you don't ever have to be sorry with me. I love you no matter what. Don't you ever go saying sorry to me."
He ate the brownies greedily and the entire time I couldn't stop slipping in glances of him. I missed him and all the time we spent together but I have a girlfriend and I'm most definitely not headed down that path, at least not today.
The rest of the day went by smoothly, there wasn’t much to complain about, it was an easy day. I walked towards the steps of the school and plopped down, waiting for Charlie and Sam. They always liked to take their precious time. I pulled out my phone and began looking at football scores. Football always seemed to interest Dean, regardless of how fit he was. Once he got a quick glance at how it was all going, he sighed and put his phone away. He wondered what was taking Sam so long, Charlie he understood. Dean whipped around and noticed Sam running off with a dark haired girl that he recognized. Allen? Salieen? Saileen? Alieen? Eileen! Dean lowered his gaze to Sam’s hand and noticed his fingers were intertwined with hers. They seemed to be happy, laughing in the background.
“What about Lisa?” Sam asked.
Once I pulled up to the entrance of the hospital, I pulled Sammy out of the car and flung him over my shoulder. I ran in and the nurse seemed to get the idea and called the doctors. They pulled him up on what seemed to be a portable bed and took him away. My legs seemed to give up from underneath me and I collapsed. I could feel my head hit the table as I fell towards the left where the reception table was. My head collided with the hard wood and then with the checkered blue and white floor. I could hear a child yell and a nurse screamed but I’m not entirely sure why. Why did this keep happening to me? My vision blurred  and I fought to stay awake this time. My eyes flickering open and closed. I could feel a pair of sturdy hands grab onto me and lay me down on something soft and with a ramp.
“Well, you are most definitely worth it. You’re worth so much more than I could ever provide. You are worth more than I could share with you and all that I could offer. You’re worth more than I can provide and hell, even if I can’t give you all that you deserve, I’ll definitely try to make up for everything I can’t provide,” I blew him a kiss and stared at him, admiring all his perfectly perfect imperfections.
He turned around quickly and hopefully, eager to hear something but I wasn't sure what. He almost hid his hopefully grin, almost. He looked amazing, I wish I could have just gone over there and love him but I can't.
"Wake up! You're so lazy!" Dean screeched as he hit me with a pillow.
He tried to run but instead I just reached out and grabbed his other arm. I carefully pulled him closer to me, making sure I didn't pull too hard incase he had wounds on the other arm too. I placed his head on my chest and let him cry. I wondered why he would do this to himself, what had driven him to this, how long it's been going on, my mind flooded with questions. I pushed them all away focusing on the one important thing, Cas. I looked down at him and felt him slowly pull away.
“Really? What are you doing then?”
The nurse was taken aback and it took me a while to process what I had just said. I could feel my face start to flush a bright shade of red and tried to hide my embarrassment by pushing open Cas' door but knowing my luck, it was a pull not push door. The nurse awkwardly opened the door and escorted me in.
"Wake up!" I heard someone say as their body fell onto mine. I groaned remembering how much my arm hurt when pressure was applied to it. I hadn't moved it much the other day but I could tell it was already getting better, I'm a pretty fast healer. It's almost inhuman.
“This place yours?”
Once school ended, I dropped off Sam and Gabe at their house. They whispered silently in the back and the only words I could make out was Cas and bad. It worried me that maybe they knew something I didn't but I brushed it off and went on with my day. I drove by Lisa's place right after and picked her up so I could take her over to my place.
I hopped out of the car once we got to school and ushered the rest of them out. I watched Sammy run off to class with Gabe before running after my friends too. I have to keep a low profile at school when it comes to Cas because he gets picked on and my reputation is on the line. Most people know that I care about Cas and I'll stick up for him but no one really messes with him so I have no reason to socialize with him unless we are out of school.
"D-de... Dean?" I heard Cas whisper.
As soon as he got home, Charlie sent him the details of the date and let him know where to go. He was looking for a well-dressed man, he would be presenting in a black suit, a blue tie, and he had black hair. Charlie told Dean that they would be meeting at a steakhouse and that the man he would be meeting would have a bee plushie on the table. Dean was satisfied with hearing that, he liked steak and where there was steak there were burgers. Dean thought the bee plushie was rather peculiar but Charlie let him know that her friend let her know it was his favorite being.
"Sure," I smiled up at him and made my way over.
“Yea, the fire had just happened and,” Cas stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay before he continued, “your mom had just passed.”
"GET YOUR SUGAR LOVING ASS BACK OVER HERE!" Luc's yells woke everyone up and before I knew it, I was being chased down the stairs.
“Yes?” He looked at Sammy and me as if he were looking for support but then sighed and looked Meg in the eyes.
“What does it matter?” I looked up at him confused about his sudden question.
“Oh, I have no clue. I mean, I love her, but it's not the same, it’s more of a best friend type love. I don’t even know why I started dating her in the first place. Seemed like a good idea at the moment,” Dean sighed, “now I don’t know how to let her down easy.”
"I love you and you know that. You have been an amazing friend to me and I care about you deeply. You are an amazing and outgoing person and I am so lucky to have you in my life," I took a deep breath before continuing, "but I do need some time for myself and I know you could probably use some time alone too. At least some time away from me anyways. You could have this place to yourself and I know Lisa has been coming over a lot. You could probably give her my room is y'all aren't ready and/or devoted to sleeping in the bed every single night. You could probably give the room to Sammy and Adam as an alternative. I know you love your brothers and probably want to spend time with them. You could get them a bunk bed or just steal one from my house-"
Sam looked at Dean worried immensely he did not want Dean back in the place he was when Lucifer killed Cas. He wanted to help his brother, he just didn’t know how.
“What was the empty deal dean?”
Dean was sitting in the dungeon letting his carefreeness take over. His phone buzzing through the silence, he was alone. Defeated. The phone finally rang through, and the room was still. He kept eyeing at the door and it’s broken fragment. Dean was destroyed as if someone had just stabbed him various different times around his whole body, but no this was a new kind of pain, one that he had never felt before. When Cas died years ago it hurt, Dean was self destructive; this somehow felt worse than the others. This time it carried a whole new burden and a new meaning as to what was next. This was in fact dreadful. He felt despondent. He was swimming in despair, and stuck in a pit too deep to climb out of. He had been frozen to that spot in the floor for hours, exactly where Cas left him along with the bloody handprint on his Jacket. Where Dean met a sudden pain that was unimaginable, the undesirable end of Cas. He could see Cas’ face, the love, the happiness, and Dean still felt that compassion in his soul; the mark it made. Warm tears flowed down his face making his vision blurry, his breathing hitched. The words taunting him like a fly buzzing around. Wondering why he didn’t try and stop Cas, that thought kept cutting through his brain, they echoed as if he was deep into a tunnel. He blamed himself for it all, he wanted Cas to be here with him. Cas died to save him, Dean would feel as if this was his fault forever, but it was what Cas wanted. Dean just wanted to kill the sound. The bunker was silent yet full of sound. The only noises that could be heard where Dean’s sobs and the phone buzzing once again. Sam was calling, Dean felt as if everything was unbearable, the smallest thing was hard. He couldn’t even lift a finger to silence the phone. The silence again but for a few hours, Sam had given up calling. Dean felt so small in this room alone, without Cas. He waited in silence other than his thoughts until Sam where to arrive home.
“Gabriel? Your brother? He… I’m sorry.”
"Get over it!" I yelled as I dodged their punches and pillows.
"For lying to you, keeping secrets from you, being rude to you, all of it," Dean's gaze drifted to the ground.
*END OF TRIGGER WARNING*
“Baby?” I questioned.
The punches came hard and steady. From what I could tell, the first one hit me in the face and the rest just went on. I woke up to a small puddle of blood that was very slowly growing with the amount of blood trickling out of my mouth. I spat most of the blood in my mouth up and tried to get up. A sharp sensation knocked me back down and I heard a groan escape my lips as I hit the ground.
"Cas?" I said just above a whisper.
Much as I love Lisa and as much as I know she loves me, I know it’s not the same. Our hearts don’t love each other the same. Our love doesn’t match. Our commitment isn’t the same, my commitment lies with Cas. I don’t know if she knows that yet or if she is still in denial. I don’t even know if I know it yet. But I do know that I want my rest of my days to be spent with Cas. I want to be able to hold him in my arms, I want to be able to kiss him till the sun don’t shine no more. I want to be able to spend all my time with him until I have my very last breath. I want to grow old with him and get kids.
“Oh! Don’t pull that with us, Gabe! You’re always saying how someone fluttery eyed you and stuff during class. Don’t go putting false ideas in Sam’s poor little brain!” Ana squealed.
"Yes Cas?"
Almost as if on cue, Lisa walked right through the doors. She dropped her bag on Meg’s lap, completely ignoring the fact that Meg was sitting there.
"We will talk about this later. Stay safe, goodbye." Dean walked out of the bathroom and I looked myself in the mirror happy to see that my body had already adjusted. I walked out and was glad that my body had been able to heal so well and so fast. Sure some of today's scratches and bruises were there but yesterday's were barely visible. My mother used to say it was a gift. That was before she left.
"Let's go!" I said as I ran back out, throwing a pancake into my mouth in the process. We all ran to the impala and jumped in as we raced to school. We got there just a few minutes before the bell rang, barely getting into our classes.
“Don’t know, didn’t like her,” Meg shrugged.
Lisa: Answer me!
CAS P.O.V.
“Columbus didn’t discover it, the Indians were there first! Some consider Leif Erikson to be the first European to have discovered it!”
"Cas!" I felt strong hands grip my shoulder and shake me. I leaped up from my chair and turned around pinning the person to the wall. My vision was blurry and it didn't help that I couldn't see very well in the dark. I wiped the wetness away from my eyes and focused on the person in front of me. I let go as soon as I realized it was Dean.
I honestly can’t remember what I’ve told you about Krissy’s situation, so I suppose I should clarify. Like me, Krissy is an orphan, but she didn’t come to be in that lonely club until she was 13. At that point, she was plunged into the Foster System in a more transient way than my own experience afforded, moving from place to place until she managed to graduate high school at 16, have herself emancipated from the system, and go off to college on scholarship. She’s what Meg refers to as a “subtle but exquisite badass”.
Castiel doesn’t let himself stare at Dean’s house much over the ensuing week. He’s trying to get into at least some kind of domestic routine, if only as a balm to his mental health, so he spends as much time as possible just reading or writing or brushing Bela (when she will allow such intrusions). He does go out to walk the neighborhood occasionally, but sticks to his side of the street as he comes and goes, and Dean is not on the lawn at any of these times.
You are paying for my graduate degree already.
Really, if Castiel wasn’t such a creep, he would have missed it entirely. But the sequence of events (as spotted out the upstairs front window while Castiel was half paying attention to his laptop) goes like this:
Dean whirled around, foot on the bottom stair. “You will do no such thing. They have 20 more minutes, and if you go near that oven I swear I will put Nair in your shampoo on the eve of your wedding.” Then he turned and started up the stairs like nothing had happened.
Logic seemed to be returning to Castiel’s mind, but he still couldn’t quite get through. “So, who…” And then a truly wild possibility hit him. “Wait.”
Cas blinks, bewildered, but ultimately just apologizes again.
“I hate you,” Dean said, as deadpan as he could manage.
So, here I am, having been welcomed immediately and thoroughly, for the first time, into something of a little tribe, and we have arrived speaking not only the same language, but in similar dialects. True, our actual writing styles and focuses vary quite widely—this was, Cain says, intentional. It gives us all the opportunity to observe a new type of writer in process and to explore what we can learn from their experience that might translate into our own. Pam even warned us that our third semester project will very directly aim us into uncharted waters in this way to help us explore where we think the limits of our own talents are drawn, and I’m looking forward to that with the delicious uncertainty of fresh anticipation.
“Actually,” Cas said slowly, aiming for nonchalance as Dean smirked. “That won’t be necessary. But thank you.”
Dean gave him a long look, then rose quickly to close the bedroom door. He returned to his bed and quietly admitted, “Lisa and I broke up.”
In any case, my meetings with Jody went quite well, and I cannot wait to see what she brings for me upon her return to The Garden at the end of May. And in the meantime, I’ll be interested to see how the personal revelations she inspired manifest in the work I undertake this winter. Self-reflection can be a useful tool, after all.
But, of course, the sense of overfamiliarity had waltzed in right about the time his Continental turned on to S. 1
“If you have sugar to spare, that is,” Dean adds, faltering slightly.
Mr. Novak:
I love my friends, I do. But my problem centers on Dean, so I cannot go to Bela (his cousin) or even to Ellen or Jo (his family). Krissy is half way to Yosemite right now, Hannah is freshly out as aromantic and a bit too emotionally raw to be expected to deal with my problems, and Jody & Donna are not only my elders but also my employers. And Meg? Well. Meg is a bit too much of a skeptic and a cynic when it comes to matters of the heart, so honestly, I cannot trust her opinion on this particular matter. So, you see, there is no one to whom I can relate this particular panic. No one but my glorious guiding void, the silent star who helped me to order my thoughts this year without even a word.
“Ouch!” Sam ejected, trying to hit his brother back. “He just got here, jerk, relax!”
Cas blinked, confused, and nearly missed Dean digging the keys out of his pocket. Moments later, the keys were being tossed at Cas’s head, so he caught them dumbly, utterly perplexed. Dean was giving him a slightly desperate look, so he stood and awkwardly said, “yes, I’ll get the guitar.”
Yours truly,
Cas grinned. “My wit is nothing if not stealthy and brutal.” That, at least, had Sam smiling. Cas patted his shoulder and started toward the kitchen. “You know,” he mused, looking back at Sam. “If you need a distraction, you could always do a little reading.”
Fuck.
The trouble with this holiday is that everyone is going away. Well, everyone apart from Chuck, who lives here permanently. All the students are going home or to visit other friends, even Krissy this time. And the professors and staff are all off to visit with family, so Chuck and I will be left entirely alone on the Estate. Not that there’s anything wrong with Chuck- he is an excellent teacher, and I enjoy chatting with him about coursework and frivolities alike. But I fear we will run out of conversation topics by the end of the first meal, and that will make coexisting for two weeks without any other company rather awkward. But, given that my alternative option is to appear back at Angel Farm without Naomi’s invitation, I cannot complain. Alfie has written me that she seems to have warmed some toward the children since my departure, and I don’t want to risk her backtracking in surprise. Much better to send them my love from afar and write my way through the vacation.
Castiel
“Oh,” Dean says, and Cas works quite hard not to read anything in the tone of that syllable. “Yeah, you too. See you around, Castiel.”
Jess giggled and offered, “Oh, yes, he learned from his rock star boyfriend. Didn’t you, Cas?”
“Oh.”
The teasing landed perfectly, and Dean jumped in right away. “No way, any ideas are welcome on that score.” Then, in an almost flirty tone that made Castiel deeply regret his ‘no eye contact’ plan, he added, “I am definitely interested.”
Hoping to project adamant honesty, Cas declared, “It's okay, Dean. It happens.”
“Great,” Dean replied, deflating with clear relief, and with one last vague gesture toward the living room, he headed back the way he had come.
“How?!” Cas asked, lost to hysterics again.
Dean winced, rubbing at his arm. “Yeah, no offense to them, but I am not moving back in with my parents. I honestly don’t want to move back to Lawrence at all if I can avoid it. I just don’t really know where I’m headed next quite yet.”
Cas began hauling his bags up the stairs as Dean called back, “There will be Ellen’s famous biscuits at Sam’s bachelor party if I have to lock my mother in the barn all afternoon.”
But Dean just looked lost, staring up at Castiel in something akin to terror. So, Castiel took Dean’s hand, clicked to answer, and handed it back with a reassuring nod.
Dean visibly gulped, like a vintage Looney Tune. “Her ‘regards’?”
“Excuse me,” Dean shot at her, mock-offended, “what do you think I am, an amateur? It’s a family cookout. Of course I brought my guitar.”
Something was off, there. It wasn’t just that it sounded rehearsed, or that he suddenly wasn’t looking at Cas while he spoke. A memory swirled to the surface of Castiel’s mind, and he raised an eyebrow. "Would that be the grandmother who was laid to rest on the family farm, or the one who had her ashes sprinkled off a ship in the Bahamas?"
Cas inched one eye open the tiniest amount, and found Dean had turned to face the door. Safe, he took the opportunity to stare unseen, watching the play of the moonlight across the man’s shoulder blades, the rise and fall of his whispering breaths. This man was not oblivious to what he had done by losing touch. The way his eyes had sparkled with quiet apologies as his friends shared stories over the campfire had made that clear enough. He wanted to fix it, to know as much as Cas would tell him, to be a part of things again. And as Cas gazed through the dark at the back of Dean’s t-shirt, he found he wanted the same thing. He wanted his damn best friend back, whatever happened next.
“Listen,” he whispers into his empty bedroom. “Jack, I get what you said, I do. And I’m proud as hell, honestly. You’re here and there and everywhere, and humanity doesn’t have to beg to have you with us. That’s how it always shoulda been, if you ask me.
“Good lord,” Cas exclaimed, leaning away. “Sam wasn’t kidding about Rufus’s problem.”
I will leave you with this, Archangel: there is a lot I’m working at, even sometimes struggling through— not least of which is a homogeneity of life experiences and a singular, isolated existence in a wide and complex world. But, in the end, I don’t think I could have found a better place on Earth to work through the nuances of these deep questions in my heart. In giving me the ability to come here, you have not only opened my career to a new level of possibility, you have given me a tribe and a kind of safety net in which to break apart. Perhaps that seems like an exaggeration to one with decades of worldly experience, such as yourself. But to me, it is the greatest gift imaginable.
I suppose those are the headlines, then. I’m continuing work on what was my final project, tentatively named “The Road So Far”. The professors all agreed that it felt like a potential novel, and I want to see if that proves to be true. Apart from that, I’m mostly spending my time reading what I can about tutoring techniques, as well as trying to make myself as useful as possible in and around the property. I can see myself being very happy with this as my home for the foreseeable future. And if Missouri, my agent, is to be believed, my work has a bright future ahead of it as well.
“You sure? Some water? I could use some water…” Dean’s expression had descended into something manic now, and Castiel changed tack out of concern.
Next, I embarked on another endeavor inspired by the class discussion, though not in such a linear way. A variety of unrelated comments had gotten me thinking about the assumptions we make—how my immediate trains of thought pitted the dragon as a villain, or at least as a problem to be overcome, and how that’s a fairly clear metaphor for so many of the problems we face in this world. I couldn’t get that out of my head, so despite having successfully completed the exercise of making something from nothing, I kept going. I wrote some sort of confessional/diary entry snippets from the dragon’s point of view. It was rather sad, and remarkably intense for something sparked by pure silliness, the tale of a being at the crossroads of things, stuck feeling just outside of several identities, wanting only to be loved, considered, needed. This dragon did not mean to haunt the castle— they were simply stuck in the castle. They did not wish to be so big in such a small space, to frighten the people who came there, to be in any way a problem for anyone. They simply
But option B was far more painful. That scenario hinged on Dean simply losing interest in Cas. This, above all, was the reason Castiel himself had not tried much to engage Dean in conversation over the last few years. Because no matter how often the logical part of his mind pointed out that Dean might just be busy or distracted or bad at texting, and that an initiated conversation from Cas might be welcomed, he couldn’t shake that lingering possibility that Dean just didn’t give a shit any more. That maybe he never really had in the first place. That maybe the closeness they shared growing up was a product of proximity and pity, for Dean, and the bond Cas had felt was a one-sided fantasy borne of lust and loneliness. That maybe Cas just wasn’t worth holding on to.
Let me know what you think.
With Love,
That’s as far as the sentence went before it stopped. Because the speaker had made it in from the hall and was standing in the door way staring at Castiel, color draining from his face, holding what appeared to be a dice bag covered in tiny cartoon Spock faces slightly away from his body in Charlie’s direction. There was a frozen moment.
So, here’s the thing: I could use some advice…
“Mmhm,” Cas continued firmly. “But I’m not fucking you in a house full of our entire family.”
“Yes,” Castiel replies, “I remember.”
Who knows, maybe I can just put “published author” on my resume and forego the teaching references entirely!
And speaking of “giving back” to someone who has taught me these last months, I have some news on the topic of my future situation as well. Jody— yes, the same Jody Mills who has been mentoring us through this final semester— has offered me a place to go next. She and her partner, Donna, have an adopted daughter who is trying to catch up in some areas of schooling now that she’s settled in a permanent, stable home. Jody and Donna have been looking into options for tutoring, and when they learned of my plans to take up just such a vocation in the Fall, they asked if I would consider being the one to work with Claire. It does seem especially serendipitous, given that Claire went through several foster homes in the last few years before finding her way to Jody and Donna. Jody confided to me that she believes Claire would benefit from a bit of emotional mentorship in addition to her tutoring, and she thinks I would be an excellent fit on both fronts.
February 16, 2018
“What??” There it was: exactly the bewilderment he had expected.
And dear god, he was beautiful.
September 3, 2017
Dean chuckled lowly. “Rough time sleeping on that camping trip last month, huh?”
The thing that had been most startling about Jess’s introduction into the clan, to Castiel, was the contrast it struck. Dean had been with Lisa for several years already by that point, and she was great. Honestly, Cas sort of hated how much he liked her, because his eternal crush really wanted a reason to help break them up. But she was sweet with just the right amount of sass to match Dean, and it was infuriating.
And with that, Cas retreats back to his house.
As your final semester at The Garden approaches, Mr. Smith wishes to extend his appreciation of your continued hard work, both within the program and along the terms of the Millicent Greenwaldt Memorial Scholarship. You have faithfully met the requirements each month, and given your recent news of publication it is clear that you are dedicating yourself to your growth and education just as any exceptional scholar should. This commitment does not go unnoticed.
Something about the tone made that feel like something of a confession. It makes Castiel tilt his head inquisitively. “You say that like it’s a contrast. Is a ‘nice settled life’ not something you’ve always wanted?”
“And… my letters?”
Apparently uncomfortable once again, Dean gave an awkward self-deprecating laugh and made to get up, but Cas was having none of it. “Oh, for fuck’s sake,” he exclaimed, and pulled Dean back down for a strange horizontal hug.
The thing is, I found myself just as desperate for context as Krissy, once the problem was out there in the open, staring me in the face. Whether I ever choose to write about a traditional, standard family or not isn’t really relevant, I guess. What is important is to understand both sides of the coin – every possible angle, as Crowley would put it – in order to truly know what my own work means in the context of the world. After all, how can I open myself up to all possible stories if I never stop to understand how others experience things?
There was a highly entertaining moment around 3 PM where Sam began to panic about how much there was left to do, hands on his hips and voice rising in pitch, in true Sam fashion. Much of the large group was enjoying a late lunch on the front porch as this began, and so ended up witnessing the full arc of Sam’s unravelling from start to finish. Bobby only let it go on for a couple of minutes before he smacked the groom lightly upside the head and sent him inside for a sandwich and a lemonade, crisis effectively averted with the simple phrase, “most of this is already half done, idjit.”
“Of course,” he replied. It was a knee-jerk reaction. His goal this weekend was to help make the festivities run smoothly. If that meant sleeping in the attic he had shared with Dean as a child and confronting the ghosts of his crush head on, then he would just have to deal with that on his own.
And yet, I hoped. You had, I reasoned, been more responsive throughout the year than originally anticipated, sending gifts and even recommendations for my future. I think I let myself believe that I knew you in some small way, even if the only hard facts I had to go on were your mailing address, your taste in flowers, and your appreciation for the charms of towns much less grandiose than your wealth affords you. More than this, I let myself begin to believe that your regard for me was specific to my letters; that you had come not only to appreciate my work ethic and the product it generates, but my…personality, I suppose. My company.
January 5 –
“I have not,” he agreed, grinning. “But I’m not the one getting married this weekend.”
Instead, I sat down day after day, and systematically rejected each anecdote as supremely superfluous, even vacuous, and certainly unimportant in the life of an important man such as yourself. How on earth, I repeatedly wondered, could a man with the means to toss around entire tuition fees like bar tips be expected to care about the menial musings of a student he has never met? You know me barely better than I know you.
Mary shook herself a bit, smiling at them mistily. “I should go see about the cake, anyway. Have fun, boys.”
Castiel thought he might be having a heart attack, but nothing could have felt less relevant. Because Dean was talking about things that Cas thought lived only in the depths of his heart. Words were nowhere near enough. But he should probably say some. “That was quite a speech.”
Oh, Archangel, the way my heart leapt as I read the message on that small card! It was quite brief, of course, a simple “Get Well Soon”, signed with your pseudonym. And I expect the crisply slanted handwriting was that of your assistant, or even the florist, but I like to daydream that it is your own.
By the afternoon, things were beginning to come together into something resembling order. Bobby and the Winchester men had hung strings of tiny fairy lights throughout the trees in the yard and along the top corners of the barn. Mary had made a run into town with Jess’s parents to pick up a rather stunning quantity of flowers, which would be protected in the barn overnight. Ash and Garth had driven around to put up directional signs from all the major highways for the out-of-town guests, and Ellen had directed a variety of helpers to whip up a delicious lunch, clean it up, and prepare what she could for Saturday’s brunch.
Castiel
And then there is me.
Cas stumbled downstairs around 9 to find most of the family already fed and put to work. He was immediately handed a plate of eggs and a beautifully enormous mug of coffee and encouraged to eat quickly so they could make space at the table for the more extensive food prep.
Dean’s eyes widened slightly as he opened the door for Cas. “Yeah, good call.”
“We should get some sleep,” he said, patting Dean once on the thigh before pulling back the covers on his own bed. “Lots to do tomorrow, from what I hear.”
Castiel
They kissed straight through until the song switched over. When they recognized the intro to Otis Redding’s “That’s How Strong My Love Is”, they both burst into laughter again.
Well played, then.
“You boys are free to go,” Mary added as she joined them on the porch.
so acutely
I hope this letter finds you well. I mean, you were certainly “well” last night at trivia. Which isn’t last night to you any more, since I actually sent this through the mail and back to our place like a sap. So, I guess I hope I haven’t done anything to royally piss you off while this was in the mail. Or, if I did— which we both know is totally plausible— I hope I at least made you Apology Pie, like an adult. Or, if not… you know. Sorry.
A little wary but still grinning, Dean asked, “Whatcha laughin’ at, Cas?”
“Yeah, well, I kinda dug that hole for myself, though, didn’t I?” It was a quiet admission, the fresh wound of a guilty conscience plagued with new ammunition. Cas frowned, at a loss until Dean sat up straighter. “But, whatever. This weekend is about Sammy, and I will not let this shit ruin it for him. Or me, for that matter. Almost the whole family is here, and that means some good times are ahead.”
“Dean… Where is Cas?” Dean looked into his eyes giving him a look of confirmation that Cas was indeed gone, and for good this time. No getting him out no Chuck repairing the broken angel. They were silent as Sam engulfed Dean in a hug, they both lost people they love. This was an unimaginable hurt, they both experienced losing everyone but each other and Jack; this was their family. Dean looked over to Jack releasing Sam from the hug.
“That’s our Cas,” Jack smiled, “He would do anything for you.”
Jack was upset you could visually see it. He missed Cas and didn’t get a goodbye.
“I didn’t mean to intrude,” Castiel offered, desperate to have his ambush forgiven. “I just—“
In Gratitude,
Heavens, I’m rambling more, even, than usual, and this is not the discourse you signed up for. I’m truly sorry, Archangel. Let’s refocus, shall we?
With Love,
, if that sounds good to you.”
The thing is, there’s
I don’t really feel comfortable being “kept” like a Victorian artist at all. Perhaps it is another peculiar byproduct of my upbringing, but I can’t abide the idea of hiding away in my work and being of no active use to the world.
In any case, we had a lovely weekend away, and I’m happy to report that my social horizons have officially extended beyond school.
Bela has been working for a while on navigating the complicated interplay of strength and weakness, vulnerability and hardness, femininity and the way it exists inside the patriarchy. She sometimes writes characters that have what Cain has dubbed “nerves of steel”— meaning they persist in inflexibility a bit too far beyond what most actual humans can bear, emotionally bullet proof. In an effort to help her reconcile a bit more vulnerability in her strong characters, Jody is recommending Bela take a story or event from a story and deeply dive in to write it from several involved points of view. She’s suggesting some kind of multi-character situation (perhaps a family gathering), and whether or not the actual telling is from a single POV or several, she wants Bela to turn aside and dive in to all of them, even just as background writing that would never be in a final story. I think it’s a bit like what a playwright might do, or even an actor— jumping fully into each character’s head to see every facet of their vulnerabilities and motivations.
Yours in mild apprehension,
I’m not sure how much you know about The Garden on the whole, Archangel, and I suspect you are unlikely to tell me. So, allow me to impart upon you the things I have learned about the place since my arrival.
Baby was easy to spot amongst the cars at the top of the hill, shining in the moonlight just the way Dean liked. Cas barely resisted the urge to slide his hand along her hood as he walked around to the back, but he knew that Dean would not appreciate finger prints on his freshly waxed prize.
“Bobby will just give me that silent death stare of his for a few weeks, and then he’ll probably get over it.”
“My point, Dean,” Castiel cut in, “is that we both fucked up here and there. So, stop taking all the blame on yourself.”
“I’m Dean,” the man continues, giving a little awkward wave where a handshake would usually enter the scene.
Dear Archangel,
Cas shot Dean a weighty look as he returned to his seat, hoping to convey “we are going to talk about that later” without making the rest of the clan suspicious. Dean nodded almost imperceptibly, and then asked Sam if he wanted to start, since Addy was still snoring softly away. Sam wasn’t wonderful on the guitar, and Jess had fun ribbing him about it good-naturedly through the first couple of songs, but he worked his way through a few tunes as everyone sang along.
“Most of the time,” Cas admits, raising an eyebrow.
in the space between people
Sincerely,
“Sure. Water would be great.”
It’s a pretty foreign concept, the Winchesters just going somewhere for fun without having any kind of underlying motive. But it sounds kinda nice, for once. Dean loves his home here, even if it is a drafty basement, but it might be nice to get out for a bit. See if some time away will clear out the two voices that still haunt the empty halls.
“You’re not,” says the boy – Ben. “We’re inviting you.”
“Well, that was kind of the goal, man. You were the height of cool, and Jo was teasing me mercilessly about it all the damn time. Not to mention Sam, the little shit.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied, not quite brightening just yet. His brow furrowed.
“For fuck’s sake. Mom, I got a hold of Rufus, and— Cas!”
“Oh,” was all Castiel could muster. His head was spinning, and the things it was turning up only confused him further. “But— I thought you said your Grandfather had passed away several years ago?”
And somehow, he accepted.
Cas looked at him, then. His concern almost shone in the moonlight, a beacon of shame that he hadn’t been enough to invite Cas’s confidence that summer, no doubt. That was no good. “Because it was selfish and gross, and I felt like an asshole the whole time.”
Cautious, but unable to sit by and watch Dean droop any longer, Cas took a seat on the bed. “Dean?”
“Only from the stands, unfortunately,” Cas reassured him, grinning fully now. “They have real professionals for the kind of photos you mean.”
Please send luck!
“Dean,” Cas said. It was nearly midnight, and the attic room was dark apart from the lamp on Dean’s bedside table.
Sam blinked at him. “I was thinking more about how many ways I could fuck up today and ruin everything. But thanks for raising the stakes there, Cas. Your sense of humor is as blunt as ever.”
At this point, it was nearly midnight, but we suddenly had a human in our midst who could fill in some blanks for us. He has two whole parents! He grew up in a city! He has siblings who were added to his family by virtue of his mother giving birth! What a novelty! After over an hour of baffled conversation, we had someone to interrogate, and I don’t think any force in the world could have stopped us.
“You know, I’ve never been sure whether she hates my guts or wants to eat me alive, so I guess that makes sense.”
When I say “we”, of course, I mean myself and my six fellow students. I wasn’t planning to spend much of my time this year writing you about my contemporaries—I expect this entire correspondence is an exercise in monitoring my academic growth rather than my socialization. But this is truly the most fascinating compilation of people I have ever encountered, and I simply cannot resist sharing. The usual disclaimer applies: if you wish to make it stop, you must reply to tell me. So. Until then, meet my classmates.
Dean winced, but conceded with a guilty expression. “Only barely. I got kinda sad-drunk this past weekend and spilled it all to her, finally. She didn’t know before that, though. And she kicked my ass appropriately hard for being such an idiot all this time.”
This would not do. Dean wasn’t allowed to look so sad while Cas’s heart was doing backflips in joy. Unable to contain himself any longer, but still lost for words, Cas grabbed Dean’s retreating hand and dragged the man forward into a kiss. It was shocked and hard and quick, but Castiel could feel the sparks as he drew back half an inch to breathe. “I didn’t say it was an unappreciated speech.”
“You should send him a fruit basket in thanks,” Cas suggested drily.
“I mean, good,” Cas said, amused. “The idea was to keep it to myself, at the time.”
