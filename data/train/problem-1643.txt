No. I don’t know.
Hands on your head! Turn around slowly!
“Because, you’re the one who keeps going on about thread count, and cashmere, and skincare, not to mention how much you invest in hair products.”
There was still no movement from John, and it was making the whole ordeal even more tense. Sherlock cleared her throat and backed into the kitchen to wash up and gather herself. When she returned, John was sitting in her chair, arms crossed over her now untied bathrobe. Her bare legs were uncrossed, but still held together tightly.
“What’s it?”
Watson nodded. “Yes, it is.” He answered without speaking into the microphone, making the room laugh. Stamford ushered him to the podium. “Yes, it is.” Watson repeated. “As you can tell, it’s also my first press conference.” he added, making the room laugh.
“Not worth explaining, Ms. Adler is leaving now and we’re going to pretend she was never here.” Sherlock mocked, moving to lift her up from the sitting chair before his brother stopped him. John didn’t fight the urge to rub his face with his hand.
I said I’m fine.
“Why are you really here? You could have just texted.” Sherlock asked Irene, brushing aside his brother’s valid points.
“It might.” Sherlock countered deadpan.
Watson smirked. “You’re high as a kite, aren’t you?”
John’s hand guided Sherlock to his lips. The gentle kiss grew deeper as John’s arms wrapped around Sherlock, holding him close. The pace was slow, exploratory, soothing. It left Sherlock wanting more while John trailed his lips along his jaw.
“Not imposed, we aren’t imposing.” Stamford corrected, ignoring Wiggins as he barked a laugh and attempted to disguise it as a sneeze.
“And you enjoy bossing people around? Or is it the public humiliations that really get you off?”
Consulting detective?
“Thank you.” John said after a moment.
“What?” The soldier asked, still looking out the window.
“Based off your wife.” John realised.
“Important?” Holmes offered sarcastically.
“Yes, let’s.” Holmes looked grateful to get away from Stamford’s nervous fretting.
Oh really? What’s it called?
Holmes hadn’t meant to say it, not like that, but he couldn’t help it. They always left. And Watson…well, Holmes had offered him plenty of opportunity to leave when they broke into FHC, and Watson had not only stayed, but challenged him. Pushed him. Helped him. Kissed him. And Holmes didn’t want to let that go without a fight.
Where’s Chester now?
Holmes plastered on his Sigerson smile and stood. There was a murmur from the crowd as all six feet of Holmes posed for the room. Watson found himself staring like the rest of them. With his dark hair combed back with the elegant waves, his tuxedo, and shined shoes. Holmes was breath taking, and almost everyone in the room was oblivious to just how incredible he really was.
They stared at each other from either end of the small flat as Holmes processed the implications of what Watson had just said. It seemed Watson had misinterpreted his observation as a negative reaction. It wasn’t. Holmes had simply assumed they would pick up where they had left off in Stamford’s office. The thought of a date hadn’t even crossed his mind. Then again, his knowledge of relationships and romance was limited, as Watson had pointed out during their first argument. It never was something that mattered to Holmes, romance. It always appeared trivial, not worth his time. But now that he was the one being romanced, Holmes was starting to understand the appeal.
John’s licked her lips and shook her head.
One case.
Ms Hawkins continued to Ms Riley. “How about costumes?”
“I feel perfectly fine.”
“But he’s still going to need some stitches,” Watson finished.
I’ll get it. I need a break from all the eye sex.
Under John’s scrutiny, Sherlock rolls his eyes and nibbles the pastry. They go back to work. John smiles to himself when Sherlock finishes the pastry as he reads. Santiago smiles and leans against a book that falls over and makes a lot of noise.
All the stairs were next to elevators, so they met no one going down the two levels.
Amy looks up. Sherlock and John are across the street. A cab stops next to them. Amy grabs Jake’s sleeve.
John wanted to ask what exactly he was looking for but wasn’t sure how the artifact would react to commands it didn’t understand. Instead, he reached for the instructions between them and almost protested out loud as Sherlock grabbed them before he could.
“John H. Watson. 37. I work as a clerk at Il Bolero.”
Holmes shrugged. “Then you know all I did was give Watson a few suggestions.”
Sherlock offers John a hand. John takes it and stands.
Holmes chuckled with him. “Obviously.”
It also took him a moment to register the soft puff of breath against his shoulder, Watson froze. His eyes went wide when he remembered. Remembered how Holmes felt, how he moaned, how he looked when Watson touched him.
Sherlock murmured to the empty room as he heard John’s door close. “Good night, John.”
Watson was so nervous he felt nauseous. Holmes looked dashing even though he looked like he hadn’t slept a wink either. Just the sight of him was enough to push Watson be as brave as Holmes’s had been the night before.
“That depends on the play list. If you’re listening to everything he’s composed, you have over a day.” Sherlock’s voice echoed against the metal walls.
Holmes instantly obeyed, and stared up at Watson, a mixture of confusion and surprise, not quite understanding what had happened.
There was a slight sting as the needle pierced his skin, but it soon disappeared under the effects of the anaesthetic. John put aside the soiled syringe to prepare the needle and thread. Sherlock appreciated the efficiency of his movements. Warzones weren’t a place of leisure.
“Fair point. So what’s with this director persona?”
Sherlock hit send as he thrust into his fist, envisioning John ordering him to suck his cock.
They watched Ms Hooper and Holmes fumble and it looked seamless, even on their first try. As soon as Ms Hooper was in his arms and their eyes met, Holmes breathed a faint, “
“What?” Talley took a moment before speaking.
“Either that or destroying both pieces. Most of the time.”
Stamford pointed to someone in the back.
“Fuck.” The syllable caught thickly in John’s throat, gasping for air, her nails digging deeper into Sherlock’s back. “Do that again.”
Watson raised his eyebrows in surprise. The first day of filming with Anderson had been disastrous. Morgan had been horrible, criticising everything from the set, to the lights, to the costumes. Ms Riley had run off crying.
“Bye.” Neeson said before John cut the line. For a moment he sat there, looking at the phone in his hands. He could’ve said that he had been transferred to another team or something, but since this was only for one case, there wasn’t any reason to alarm anyone. John felt something in him react at the thought of leaving the Warehouse. Where else would he be able to go on these types of missions? And compared to the Special Forces, the Warehouse was more of a prevention team than a covert force. John preferred the idea of prevention instead of last resort action.
“I-I’m not-”
The loud electrical sparks covered the sound of John’s body hitting the pavement, unconscious and limp, shirt still fuming from the blast.
Watson rolled his eyes. “No.”
“What class?”
Sherlock’s mind stuttered to halt as he imagined being taken on the floor. It took John’s hands pushing his hips to process the request. His feet started to move, but Sherlock was making it difficult by refusing to stop kissing John during their transit. It resulted in Sherlock falling back on the bed when the back of his knees hit the mattress. It was worth the loss of contact for the sight of John crawling up his body.
John did a double take, surprised Sherlock wasn’t pushing the issue any further. Wasn’t he curious why he used the artifact even though he didn’t know what he was doing?
(See the end of the chapter for
The suspect walks away. John’s keeps an eye on the suspect as he takes out the wallet and takes a picture of his drivers licence. John throws the wallet a few feet ahead of him.
Molly cursed the shiver that ran up and down her spine, the tingle in her neck as she felt Sherlock’s breath against her skin.
“You, uh,” Watson looked around to make sure everyone was out of earshot, “want to share a cab?”
“Wait, I thought we couldn’t make an artifact locator.” John questioned.
John looked from the gears to his partner. “What? What is it? And what’s that?”
“Fine.” He replied, but the word sounded perplexed, just as he felt.
Ouch. I was with Eleanor three years before she left me. She was a wonderful woman.
“We should head down.” Lestrade dropped his toothpick in the trashcan.
Sherlock paused, surprised. John hadn’t said no. Not yet anyway.
“There you are,” Lestrade said to them then spoke to Watson, eyeing his legs. “Found your cane on the ground, it’s upstairs, but is everything all right?”
Time slowed as their eyes met.
“Yeah, and I already have ideas for the choreography,” Wiggins added and pointed to Holmes and Ms Adler. “You’ll want to change.”
cue evil laugh*
You mean how Holmes crushed him in interrogation.
“What do we do with him?” Ms Rosie asked.
John looked out the window, letting himself process the story. It seemed like Sherlock had almost gone insane because of an artifact. But didn’t he say it didn’t have any side effects? Could it have been caused by what had happened to his partner? She did say they had started chasing it as a team and then... then what?
Moriarty frowned. “What?”
“Our little Johnny here likes it. And here I thought you’d appreciate the touch of drama.” Manning answered the agent with a smile.
“Sorry ‘bout that,” she said with a smile and close the door quietly behind her.
“What?”
Holmes nodded and was pleased to see John deducing, even if it was something obvious.
“Morgan, darling, how are you.” Ms. Adler said with a flourish.
“Starving.”
John clenches his jaw and runs towards the exit. Jake untangles himself from under the cook.
“Hunting down whatever threatens to ruin the world’s day, neutralizing it and bringing it here. Biscuit for the road?” he said as he took the kettle out of the goo to put it back in its place.
Holt is standing at the podium. Everyone -- Sherlock, John and Lestrade included -- is sitting at the tables. Amy is wearing a coat similar to Sherlock’s.
SHERLOCK
(See the end of the chapter for
“Knew what?”
“Funny.” Ms Rosie smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “He said you were good.”
Stamford turned to Watson then, whose postured now looked ready to fight, which piqued Holmes curiosity.
“Oh, well, I never really…” Ms Hooper started to turn bright red.
Ms Riley was next in, shortly followed by Small, holding the daily paper and a book.
He knew it was a terrible idea, which was why all trace of hesitation left Watson. He straightened his stance, and marched past Holmes inside the building.
How the man could finish his tirades without being out of breath was yet another sign of his skills. Barnabas stared at Sherlock, his jaw loose, eyes wide with surprise.
“Really, John? That’s what you’re taking out of what I just said?”
TERRY
“I could eat.”
“Hurry up; we have an artifact to catch.” Sherlock added, the sound of his voice fading. John laid back down, tired, confused and absolutely not ready to face this day when he thought of something and sat up again.
“Who cares? It’s a hypothetical scenario. We have the violin, you didn’t stop me, and everyone is safe now.”
“How did you?-“
John’s bright smile was contagious.
“More than usual,” Lestrade added.
“What was that?” She asked.
“What do you mean?”
“If you want even the slightest chance of being reinstated, Captain, I suggest you listen to what I have to say.” Watson stopped and turned slowly towards him, his blood pumping with controlled rage at what he had just heard.
Molly leaned back in her chair, closed her eyes and crossed her legs tighter. She had paperwork to finish and a couple tests to run in the lab before she could go home. It had been nine days since Sherlock’s last visit, and Molly’s attention span was getting steadily worse. By the time she had started running the tests, she was considering going to the loo to wank and take the edge off, just so she could concentrate and finish her ruddy day. As much as the constant state of arousal was a pleasant sensation, it was starting to be an inconvenience, because she couldn’t figure out how to appease it. It wasn’t from lack of trying, the fantasies just
What do you think? Sherlock couldn’t keep his bloody mouth shut.
Stamford pulled back. “I can’t thank you enough.”
“Yes.”
“And what does it imply?”
“No, no, it teleports.” John’s eyes widened.
“Right, okay.”
No, it’s mine! I mean, fine, whatever, I’ll take the pity shirt. But I won’t like it!
Watson pulled out the pages he had written a few nights ago and started reading, rubbing his leg absent mindedly. What was most surprising to Watson was how different this new story was. He had been writing romantic scripts for so long that it felt odd, unfamiliar, but Watson couldn’t deny the slight thrill he felt when he immersed himself, slowly discovered this new universe. It didn’t take long until he loaded a blank page into the typewriter.
Sherlock spotted his rumpled shirt on the floor and everything came flooding back. The case, the shop, and John. Which led to the spanking, the wank, and the reason why Sherlock had fallen asleep on the couch.
“They’re here. Will you finally tell me how your evening with Ms Adler went?” Stamford eagerly asked Holmes.
“Blurry.”
Watson sipped his drink and looked anywhere but at them. “I came here once when I first moved here. Not really my vibe. I prefer Musso’s.”
The older of the two chuckled. “How could you leave such a beautiful creature alone?”
“Organs? Human organs?”
“Yes, I play the violin.”
The massaging hand disappeared and with delight, Sherlock counted to three.
His dream came to mind, making John’s eyes close as Irene’s playful tone echoed in his head.
Forgetting about the ringing Farnsworth, John threw it aside and placed his hand on the back on Sherlock’s head to help with the breathing. “Sherlock, stop talking.”
Stamford looked surprised but pleased. “Is he on your way?”
“You want me to keep working cases with you?”
Holmes hummed, but didn’t look up.
This collaboration was proving to be much more fruitful than anticipated, even if Sherlock was struggling with his attraction to John. The important thing was that they now had a lead.
“Ready.” Ms Hawkins called in the bullhorn.
Sherlock slammed the intercom button. “Do you have any other leads?”
John hadn’t noticed Sherlock move until he felt his hand covering his own over his chest. The sensation interrupted John’s words as he looked from their joint hands to Sherlock and stared at him as he felt a soft squeeze. With a shaking breath, John twisted his hand and squeezed back, acknowledging the mirroring of the scene on the bridge. Sherlock eyes smiled softly before closing, his hand going limp in John’s.
There was a bit of an awkward silence while Holmes bit back an amused smirk. Lestrade looked discouraged. Stamford was clearly confused.
Watson shrugged him off. “I just started.” He angled Holmes’s head once more, making sure not to look him in the eye.
Sherlock blinked a few times. “Yes.” He had tuned out again. He didn’t mean to, it just happened.
“Here.” Holmes handed Small a wad of folded bills. “For your troubles.”
“You did what?” Lestrade exclaimed, looking over his shoulder at Holmes.
“Give me one good reason not to kill you right here, right now.”
“I have enough to remember as it is.” Stamford argued.
Ms Adler laughed. “Come on now.”
It’s going to take about thirty minutes to get an NYPD boat.
Holt gasps.
“Oh. I thought you were…”
They were led to three booths near where Holmes and Ms Adler had been at their last visit. Watson started going towards one of the two crew tables when Ms Hooper guided him to Stamford and the cast. Ms Adler sat in the centre, the spot with the best view of the room. Holmes was on her right, and Ms Kate on her left. Watson moved aside to let Ms Hooper slide in to sit next to Holmes.
“What!? Why?”
John suggesting they would see each other again despite their difficult start was all the encouragement Sherlock needed to drink from the offered glass. The process went well. Only a bit of the water dripped down his chin and neck, disappearing under his shirt collar. John gently wiped it off with the back of his fingers.
“If you won’t even give it a go, then why are you here?” John was coming off angrier than he was. He was more concerned about what would happen in the long run. Quite frankly, when the selfish bastard you’ve been working/living with for weeks suddenly starts making you coffee, stops arguing and listens to you... its really creepy. Clearly it wouldn’t take longer than a day or two for Sherlock to go back to his old ways of disappearing in the middle of a case and unnecessarily risking their lives.
“John?”
It wasn’t until he felt it come undone that Sherlock became aware he’d had a tight ball in his chest. Everything he had been holding back, holding in, hiding, protecting, it fanned out. He could do nothing against the wave of emotion rising inside him except ride it out, like a raging fire that couldn’t be extinguished until it had consumed everything in its path. The warm press of John’s hand on the nape of his neck was all the reassurance Sherlock needed to let it run its course.
“What? No disappearing act?” John teased as he watched the caretaker move.
Obviously, John was right. Not only was he spot on, but Sherlock hadn’t even thought of using Lennox to get into the club. He would have thought about it eventually, but he wasn’t expecting to get beaten to the punch. It must have been a popular technique in Bishops stories then, Sherlock rationalised, just like using violence to get information.
As soon as he stepped inside the flat, John headed directly to the cupboard under the sink to get his whiskey bottle. Not bothering to get a glass, he took a swig and closed his eyes as he felt the burn, making himself focus on it. He turned and leaned against the counter and opened his eyes.
“Pff, come on, you’re not a nurse, I know that much. What, like a freelance hitman? I mean hitwoman?”
“Unless it’s a trap and Irene Adler lied to us.” Sherlock argued flatly.
“Added wifi, touchscreen, basic apps, integrated ping system. Couldn’t get rid of the ringtone though.”
“Do I want to know what it does?”
“Yes, Ms Adler.”
“More like,” Holmes tackled Watson’s legs as he had with Small.
TERRY
Watson lowered the paper.
The director was sunk in his chair, arms crossed, staring at the ceiling. Holmes turned to Ms Adler, confused. She kept her eyes on Morgan, but shook her head subtly. She seemed calm, but Holmes could see how tense she really was.
Moriarty put his hands in his pockets and smirked. “I see it as helping people, people who have problems they need help solving. Sort of like you, Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.”
interesting.
Holmes stood there long enough to make the crew think he had just been shot down, or led on, or whatever they would think of to explain their scenario, it didn’t matter. Holmes raised his chin, smoothed his suit, and slipped into his own dressing room.
Watson looked relieved and turned to Ms Hooper.
“You trying to put me off?”
“I’m a good actor but no person in their right mind would spend more time browsing here.” Sherlock complained.
Watson,” Ms Adler greeted with a wide smile. “I trust you slept well.”
“I’m honoured.”
“You sure?”
“Go! Now!”
Even if they both could have fallen asleep then and there, John clumsily climbed over Sherlock to go get a flannel to wipe them clean. Sherlock watched him walk over to the washroom and back, enjoying his naked body.
“Maybe we missed it?” John offered.
“This is mad. We have no idea what we’re getting into.”
“J-Just… gimme a minute.”
The soldier put down the kettle and held his hands up to hold him back. “Not until you tell me what it is.”
Holmes turned away and ended up facing himself in the mirror. Now that he was neck deep in his undercover persona, and discovering the full extent of the work that would be required for this movie to be a success, all without getting caught, Holmes wasn’t sure if he was acting nervous anymore. Because like it or not, he had a better chance at saving Stamford’s company if the movie was good, and a large part of that depended on his performance in the movie.
Holmes blinked a few times before muttering a small, “I see,” And taking a sip of his tea. “What else slowed down filming?”
“And most likely Anderson’s murderer,” Holmes continued. “We need go to her house. Now.”
“Hey!”
“Look, no matter how we fix it, there is a way, and I always find it. And to do that, we need the other piece.” Sherlock said a bit louder, his voice steady. John smiled at what he had just heard. He is so full of himself, John thought. He might as well show off now that he has the chance. It wasn’t like anyone else could help him.
“I was in perfect control; it’s you that insisted we move out faster than planned.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
Watson wondered what else made Holmes blush, and tried to hide his shock from even having the thought.
“If it’s that dangerous, why didn’t you just bid big to make sure you got it?” John asked as he moved back into the kitchen to silence the boiling kettle.
“Copy that. I’ll be there. Over.” Watson said before turning back to the man, which he found with his knife untying his hands.
Moriarty shrugged. “Then I kill you.”
“I trust him with my life.”
“We?” He had had enough of mystery people for one day. Seeing as the man wasn’t going to clarify more, Watson
“I will call you.” The agent promised, attempting to free his arm.
Watson’s got some skillz.
“I closed the place at around 1 am.”
“And yet that sentence had started out so well.” John muttered as he poured water into his cup.
Lestrade crossed his arms and sat on the corner of the desk. “Which restaurant are you going to?”
HOLT Holmes injured, Watson caring for him. This is a great opportunity for them to take it to the next level.
Sherlock stared down the corridor.
Holmes rolled his eyes.
“Sigerson Holmes, it’s an honour to meet the woman taking over the hearts of Hollywood.” He kissed her hand chastely. “And a privilege to get the chance to share the screen with someone with your skill and respect for the craft.”
Whaaaaat? Like Pirates of the Caribbean cursed coins?
Mr Holmes, thank you again for agreeing to team up with me. I can give you a tour of the precinct if-
Hank kept struggling under John, all while explaining in a quite colourful way how he would take his revenge on them. John leaned closer to Hank’s head, twisting his arm a bit further, causing his words to turn into a painful cry.
“Once more, yeah?” Stamford pleaded, trying to keep his smile he was struggling.
“I’m flattered.”
“That she’s got her eye on you,” Lestrade explained.
Holms shrugged. “I mostly did theatre.”
Sherlock conceded the point with a non-committal tip of his head.
“Can’t you go to a beauty salon for this?”
“Yes, perfect!” Dimmock smiled and stopped playing. “Then you get to catch your breath while the town sings the chorus, then the next verse is Jane and Edward’s harmonising.”
“Who’s P.T. Barnum? And what does it do?”
“Of course I’m mad, she’s wasting my time! And now yours!” Morgan stomped his feet on the ground for emphasis. “With her experience, her co-star shouldn’t be outshining her.”
Hey, it’s none of my business. You don’t have to talk about it.
“Crisis averted. Well done, agents.” Mycroft’s recorded voice said smugly.
Ms Hawkins eyes widened. “You gave Watson notes directly?” She turned to Stamford. “I swear I told him to talk to you.”
Sherlock looks at the exit sign at the far end of the museum, then back to John.
“Nothing, just a clock.”
Uh, why do you sound like you wouldn’t have given it back.
SHERLOCK
He leaned his head on his free hand. “Anderson, maybe?”
“Your hands. And the pack you were wearing.”
John gaped at him. “Seriously?”
SHERLOCK
With a last nod, Sherlock turned away from John, not bothering to check if Molly was following him.
As soon as Watson closed the door to the front passenger seat they drove off.
Fine.
“So? It’s a very effective way to get information.”
Morgan took off his sunglasses in a flourish. “This is what you give me to work with?”
“I was hired because of my medical history?” John’s tone didn’t have the worried edge from a moment ago.
TERRY
“It looked like a pocket watch only bigger.”
I figured you might like this.
A few bits of wood framing scattered the entrance carpet, unnoticed as they hurried into the room.
“I swear to God.” The soldier hissed, barely stopping himself from punching the smartass in front of him. He had had enough bullshit today and as much as he could endure some assholes in his team, this man was something else.
“As you wish.” Was the last thing Sherlock said before he turned and started walking away.
“Is it the left shoulder?”
Wide-eyed, Amy goes from Holt, to Sherlock, and back to Holt.
have urges and chose not to act upon them would make things harder for John. Or worse: the possibility that the attraction could be mutual but not acted upon. It would only be a matter of time before John lost control and pinned the madman against a wall to ravage him. John’s brain suddenly overflowed with multiple scenarios, all of them ending in heated sex.
“Of course it does,” Holmes cut him off. “How can people focus on the story if they’re asking themselves how Edward could have possibly won with that hand.”
Jake covers his mouth with his hands and does a drumroll sound. Amy rolls her eyes.
“Can’t you detect the... what did you call it? Tangential energy?”
The agents simultaneously rolled their eyes and turned to face the Caretaker.
“What do you mean?” John inquired.
“He’s busy with the set change, he’ll catch up with us after. And he would agree this is a perfect chance to get information.”
There was too much to sort through. Holmes pushed it aside for later.
“You’re doing quite well Mr Holmes.” Ms Adler whispered to him as the first song ended and most of the room was watching them.
“It’s not like this is my specialty.” John answered back, frustrated and trying to think of a solution. He tried again and again to pour the purple goo over the tattoo, only to see it move on a different part of Sherlock’s body every time. John put down the jar and gently probed the tattoo with his gloved fingers, taking note that it wasn’t moving when he wasn’t trying to stop it. That’s when he realized what the only possible way to fix this was. “Sherlock, I know what to do.”
know that name.
“Hum?” Sherlock said innocently. “Nothing.”
“You do realise I wasn’t even in the room.”
“You always ignore my texts.” She said with a small pout, batting her eyelashes at Sherlock before her gaze morphed into a prowling animal as she looked from Sherlock to John. “And I wanted to meet your new partner.” Her innocent voice combined with the hungry look made his throat function with difficulty, causing him to swallow as he tried to breathe. He braced himself against the experiment filled as he coughed.
“Watson, it’s Neeson. Listen, I’m really sorry for what happened, there’s no reason for you to get suspended for this. I mean, you sounded weird on the coms, but suspended? It’s... Shit, I don’t know. Just... Just call me when you get this.” Mustard, water bottles, baking soda and shit, no milk. Closing the door he headed straight for his stash of whiskey in the cupboard as he listened to the next message.
“It was worth it for the chance to finally go to Bora Bora with you.”
“Under the library of Alexandria. Tragic losses. Anyway, finding the file is the tedious part.” Sherlock explained offhandedly.
The words were like music to John’s ears, what with the number of times he had read those same words, acting them out in front of his mirror as a young teenager. He answered without missing a beat.
“Following the story, John. If Carson is dead, we should tell his wife.”
century called People’s Will.”
“What is?”
“How-” Lestrade cleared his throat. “How about last Friday?”
“How long was I unconscious?” The senior agent asked as he looked at the blood pool around him.
Ow. What was that for?
Moriarty shrugged. “Oh well,” and stepped aside.
Mycroft walked over to the experiment table and looked at the GPS a moment. “I felt this one deserved to be done in person.” He said slowly, looking up at his brother.
“He’s mad, in’he?” Lestrade said as he slowed in front of Watson’s home.
The only way he could tackle her without hitting Sherlock or furniture was from the front. She saw him coming and instinctively tried to stop him with the crop, freeing Sherlock. She couldn’t know its control was limited to one person. While she watched John’s frozen figure fall to the floor, Sherlock lunged at her, knocking the crop out of her hands. John grabbed it while Sherlock immobilised her, his voice filled with threat.
“Ah, come on.” The small man answered looking around, as if he could find a way to get out of a possible threat to his business.
“Lestrade.”
John’s eyes widened momentarily, surprised he even needed to explain this. He knew his partner was socially inapt, but this seemed a little extreme, even for him. “Because we’re a team. Partners.”
John chuckled. “You have a concussion, so no, but I’m free Sunday.”
In bolded font.
“It seems congratulations are in order.” Mycroft answered with a fake smile, his brother’s passive aggressiveness ignored.
Rosa pushes the lever and the boat speeds off. Everyone except Holt stumbles.
“I’m-, hand me the elephant, would you?”
It wasn’t helping that Sherlock’s enthusiasm was contagious. He wanted to be irritated that he had been ignored once again, but John secretly loved when the man suddenly went into a flurry of words and movement as he figured out who was using an artifact and how to stop them. The brightness in the tall man’s eyes as he turned to John to lead them on a chase, the moment they shared when it was over and they had saved someone, or the world, yet again. John couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but he felt a surge of adrenaline and endorphins like no other, because they shared the knowledge of what they had done, like their own incredible secret. Those moments with Sherlock, from the moment he saw the look in his eyes to the flash of neutralizer, were what John lived for, what he had unknowingly searched for all his life. And it all came with this incredibly arrogant, brilliant madman.
“Do you need a break?” Ms Hawkins asked, concerned.
Thank you for reading! Please leave kudos/comments if you enjoyed :D
Of course! “That’s the name of his mother.”
“Ms Hooper, you’ve been hiding things from us. When were you going to say you can act?”
“Fuck, oh fuck.”
“Oh good, we’re already on topic.” Ms Hawkins said with a smile that did not reach her eyes.
“Sherlock!”
You coming?
Sherlock blinked. Was John serious? Was he about to hand-feed Sherlock?
As he finished his sentence, they watched the ball roll onto a fallen book, making a ramp that took it up to the first shelf, bumping into a white porcelain tea set in a metal tray, shattering them and simultaneously making the shelf shake, causing several artifacts to move to the ledge and fall off one after the other, including a leather bound case. It had a metal flip lock that opened as it fell, revealing Walt Disney’s paintbrush that floated out. It bounced off the floor, flipped in the air a few times before the tip hit a shoe box. It slowly changed color, making it appear cartoonish. Suddenly, the box’s lid popped opened and out came large cartoon shoes that started walking around, eventually heading to a large displayed armor and kicking it.
BOYLE
“Why? Why kill innocent people?” Sherlock demanded, his frustration growing from not being able to control his own body.
Holmes seemed pleased Watson was keeping track. “Because Anderson was drugged and sent up a balcony with a railing built high enough to protect his partner, but just below his centre of gravity, making it easy for him to topple over and fall to his death.”
Sherlock pulled out his mobile and quickly stood so John wouldn’t notice his hands were shaking. He still couldn’t believe John was collaborating.
“We’re going to Plymouth.” He informed his partner without looking up.
Amy is about to speak when they hear a sickening thud and John cry out in pain.
Lestrade laughs.
“It was ordered to move to London when it detected our tracking signal.” The former soldier frowned at the idea.
“That’s brilliant.”
Stop what?
Now wait a minute.
“Everything.” The man eyes gleamed. John looked around before asking.
“Ooh, you bad man.” Watson muttered to himself.
. John stood there a moment, mesmerized by the vision.
As uncertain as it made him, given the urgency of the situation, Stamford looked ready accept anything.
When he finally pulled it together, Holmes beckoned Ms Rosie with his head, and regretted it when the movement made him nauseous. Or all the laughing. Or the LSD. Probably the LSD.
There was a pause, to remember the moment but mostly out of fear that the next step would somehow ruin everything. But the pull between them was too strong to resist. They were in each other’s arms in an instant, lips coming together in a bruising kiss. Watson didn’t care if it made him whimper, didn’t care if they were in Stamford’s office, he manoeuvred Holmes against the door and kissed him like their lives depended on it.
“Thank you.”
It didn’t matter, Sherlock needed to leave. He needed to think, and that wouldn’t happen here.
“Wait what?” Watson asked.
I don’t know, the way you two are together?
He married a woman?
John?
“You left before I found it.”
John sat back in his chair, his hand moving up to worry his lips with his thumb and forefinger. “Yes, well, brace yourself for more. What is she doing with the artifacts?”
John was stunned. He had caught on that the man lacked empathy, but this. “It’s because we’re partners you bloody idiot! We fucking live together!” His hands tightened on the armrests as he looked up at the ceiling, willing himself not to give into the urge to knock some sense into the man. “As much as I find you the biggest prick to ever walk the earth, I am stuck with you, and you’re stuck with me. This means that what affects you, affects me. If you die, I will have a problem with that, and I bloody well hope you feel your grayish version of that. So suck it up and start acting like it or I swear to God-”
“Downside? What downside? Why are you backing away, am I going to explode or something?”
He turned back towards Sherlock, who was now pointing his Tesla at him.
“No!” John called out as he struggled to his feet to stop him. He moved as fast as he could to get to it first. But he didn’t make it in time. Grabbing the knife, the man turned, blindly stabbing towards John. It cut through his left shoulder; he could feel the blade coming out the back. Ignoring the pain, his right hand caught the man’s wrist and tightened until he let go of the handle. With a frightened look, the owner started backing away. John grabbed him by the shirt and head butted him, watching him fall unconscious on the pavement. He turned to see how Sherlock was doing, until he noticed that the blade had started glowing and his shoulder was turning into glass.
SCULLY
The corner of Lestrade’s mouth raised at the subject change. “Nothing yet.”
“Such a professional.”
Molly felt like a mystery Sherlock was trying to solve and it felt
John and Sherlock are still hidden behind the crate. In the background we see Chester limping towards a door, leaving a blood trail behind him.
And it was driving her insane.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue when their car arrived. The valet stepped out and held the driver door open.  With a smug smile, John climbed in and waited. As soon as the passenger door closed, they drove off.
Sherlock looked back sharply, their eyes locking.
“We will see, won’t we?” Mycroft replied. John looked at Sherlock, as if asking him if his brother was serious, but Sherlock was ignoring them, tapping away at the computer.
No matter what I say you will find a way to participate, won’t you?
TERRY
BOYLE
“Psychologically yes, but as a dance partner I’ve had better.”
Lestrade nods towards Jake and Amy who both look like they want to hide in a hole after Sherlock’s deduction.
“Ms Hooper should be assistant director,” Ms Kate added.
Sherlock wandered over and leaned woozily on the kitchen door frame. “Depends.”
“Well, that’s what I’m here for.” The clerk nodded towards the riding crop Sherlock was holding. “For you or your partner?”
Watson pushed back with his hips, grinding his arse against Holmes as a distraction, hoping that the mix of surprise, arousal and alcohol would make Holmes release the arm lock. Success. With a strong push off the floor, Watson lifted Holmes up and to the side, making him land on his side heavily. Watson quickly pushed Holmes onto his back. Before he could get a chance to react, Watson crawled over Holmes, straddling him, and grabbing hold of his wrists to hold them on either side of his head.
“Where do I start?” John answered, equally sarcastic.
Molly’s body froze into place, thrilled yet terrified at seeing John step into the lab. The sensation increased as she waited to see if Sherlock would walk through the door. Then she realised John was alone. It’s also then she noticed John was wearing a skirt.
Wiggins watched Holmes’s reflection in the mirror as he danced along with him. They got to the end, and Holmes only fumbled twice on his first try.
But you said yourself that they’re totally made for each other, I thought you’d be happy they’re--
Holmes stared out the window a moment before suddenly declaring, “I need to see the crime scene again.”
“Whether he likes me or not, that doesn’t excuse how he acts when we’re on a case. At this rate, I might kill him before an artifact does.”
The last rewrite had helped enormously, but it hadn’t help him make any progress on the finale. Watson knew why. He had always struggled with endings, and the original ending had taken a lot out of him to write. All he could hear in his head was the original version. He didn’t want the lack of a proper ending to be the cause of the movie’s downfall.
Lestrade wrote everything down on the notepad. “For how long?”
When the barge moves, there are screams from the last few museum visitors. They run and jump onto the boardwalk before it's too far.
“Watson?” Ms Hooper appeared at Watson’s side. “You ready?”
This gave the tags the ability to grant wishes, which seemed dull to Sherlock at first, since it was similar to the copper kettle. With further research, he discovered that it didn’t have a downside. It had, however, specific conditions for the wish to be granted: the wish had to be made for someone else, and the user had to love the person for whom they were wishing.
“Why voice command on a GPS?” John asked innocently.
to remember?”
“He’ll live.”
He had never taken the time to analyse pain like this. Most of his experiences with pain were a hindrance, something that slowed him down, making him curse his transport.
As hoped, the pain had helped Sherlock’s mind relax. He couldn’t have known that it would also make him inhabit his body more deeply than ever before. So when John punctuated his statement with a thrust of his hips, brushing his cock against Sherlock’s, the touch felt electric. The pleasure felt so intense against the burn of his arse. The sound that came out of his body was more shock than pleasure. It was too much and not enough, and he desperately wanted more. He tried to thrust, to get some kind of friction on his cock but John quickly put a stop to it with a tug.
Oh, she texted you, didn’t she?
Amy walks out of Holt’s office.
The grip on Sherlock’s wrists tightened.
Holmes wasn’t sure how to react when a short blond woman walked out of darkness. She stopped close enough for Holmes to see her without stepping inside the cone of light. She was entirely dressed in black, and probably armed, it was too dark to tell. But she rather seemed…disappointing.
“It summons glowing, concussive balls of violent energy that is comparable to a canon ball. Hitting a G sharp on the violin could cause an entire town to erupt in a wave of violence.” John was about to ask if he was serious, but it just felt like déjà view.
SCULLY
Come on Santiago. You couldn’t say more than ‘oh my God’ the entire time he was here.
Ms Adler slipped her hand onto his shoulder. “Is everything all right, darling?”
“Fuck yes.”
John nods non-commitally.
“John, oh God, Joh-”
“I want to call the police department to keep an eye on FHC. We need to know when and where those trucks are moving.”
“Hm.” Sherlock raised an unconvinced eyebrow.
“A word.”
“Will do.” Stamford leaned away, let go of Holmes’s hand and stepped offstage.
Sherlock took a deep breath and just as he let out the air, the paddle hit his left arse cheek. The pain was the same but stronger.
A melancholic look spread through Bishop’s features. “You're just like her; pure and sweet and usually right.”
An electrical arc spread from the Jade Elephant to the shelves on their left, making the top one break off its hinges. John grabbed Sherlock’s arm to move them out of the way, nearly missing a fluffy teddy bear with a burned off arm heading directly towards them.
“Have you seen your umbrella?” The man’s eyes widened before he lifted up his chin with a look like he had smelled something foul. Watson did his best to keep his face neutral as he spoke. “You want me to work at a warehouse?”
“I got shot.”
Contrary to the loud crackling electricity of the outside, the inside was almost quiet. The air was oddly calm, like being in the eye of the storm during a hurricane, were it not for the low pulsing drone. Nothing aggressive, more of a cyclic type sound, like a spinning clothes dryer. John was thrown off by the fact that he wasn’t only hearing the drone, he was feeling it. Like the vibration of the base drum at a concert you can feel in the ground and in your chest, only now John felt like it pulsed and resonated with his core instead of vibrating. He straightened with more difficulty then he cared to admit, resorting to leave his weapon on the floor so he could hold on to his knees with both hands while his body adapted.
As promised, check the comments for a few cut jokes.
Rosa pushes the lever and the boat speeds off onto the river, making Holt stumble.
SHERLOCK
Ms Adler patted his hand, and Holmes let go of a breath he didn’t realise he was holding. “That was lovely dear.”
“Sex.” John broke the silence, making Sherlock look up at him, his brow furrowed. “With artifacts.” John gaze crossing Sherlock’s briefly, hoping to god that he wouldn’t see his blush.
“I can’t fight it, John, the riding crop; it has complete control over my body.” Sherlock said, trying to sound calm but his eyes were betraying him.
“Surprisingly ok.” Was all John found to say. After all, it was true in some way.
I’m aware these aren’t ideal conditions to discuss this, but I’ve had enough of waiting for the right moment. I’ve wanted to tell you so many times that I… At first I was convinced you didn’t return my feelings, until it was too late and I… left. Then I came back and you were with… After everything was over you moved back in and it’s… It’s been the happiest I’ve ever been. Having you back home. With me. I meant it, what I said last night. I will take better care of myself. I can’t promise I won’t mess up sometimes, but I will try my best, if it means I get to spend the rest of my life with you.
John grabbed his duffle bag from the bathroom while Sherlock settled himself.
“Hm?”
But he did get a lot of information on Morgan and Ms Adler, which is why he told Stamford they needed to talk. Tonight.
Watson opened his mouth a few times. “You seemed… close.”
Sherlock leaned back in his chair, one arm across his chest as a finger lay on his chin. “Well, I haven’t really thought about it.”
The fact they were saying the same words as yesterday’s spanking wasn’t lost on Sherlock. In a swift movement, Sherlock was on his feet, but felt himself sway. John’s arm tightened around his waist, pulling him closer. It was comforting, having the warm press of John’s body against-
So sad.
“4.” John smirked at the answer, and Sherlock added “But it’s not what you think.”
John froze mid movement, his mind struggling to understand his partner’s logic. “Then explain to me the difference between caring for my life, and having to think about whether or not you care about my death.” He asked, leaning against the backrest, ready to hear whatever might come out of that brilliant twisted mind.
“I don’t.” Sherlock answered with a knowing smile. John figured it was just simpler to play his partner’s game if he wanted things to move along.
“Yup.” Sherlock answered, running towards the office. John followed him as best he could. He hadn’t expected a man with such a long coat to move so quickly. They climbed through the window and hurried down the alley towards the street, just in time to see him turn the corner. John, who was speeding up to follow the man down the street, almost ran into Sherlock who was cutting through another alley.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it.” Holmes pressed his thigh harder momentarily, as if to punctuate his words.
Her hair had a chemical fragrance now, which meant John was hiding something. That fact alone shouldn’t matter, since hair dye’s primary use is to cover up gray hairs. But it’s still a solution that hides what can not be covered. And
“It’s pretty different.” Watson felt his pulse race. It always did before he presented a new song or script, but he knew this time he was nervous for another reason. “But it still works in the casino set. Maybe just a few changes so that-”
“What’s in the decontamination shower that gets the goo off so easily?”
“We’re from the department of-” John started to say when Sherlock cut in.
Lestrade put down his pen and leaned his elbows on the table. “So who’s your suspect?”
“Oh!”
Sherlock stopped walking momentarily at the question. “What do you mean
A better detective than you’ll ever be.
That much was true. He had no idea what had motivated Watson to finally read his notes. Well, he had a few theories, but nothing tangible. He hadn’t anticipated such a result. It was as if Watson had breathed new life into his story.
“The point is,” John continued, “were you only looking for a spanking?”
John looks away.
“Why do you insist on being nice?” Sherlock shot back, his eyes still on his Farnsworth.
“But...” Holmes wanted to burst. He had already been struggling with Morgan’s behaviour during rehearsal, but now the director was taking it to another level. Not only was he purposely slowing down the filming process, but the meaningless drivel was driving Holmes insane. But there was only so much he could tell Ms Adler without blowing his cover, and he had no idea how close she really was to Morgan. Not to mention he couldn’t risk his working relationship with her. They still needed to make a good movie after all.
Oh damn. Then what happened?
“Good morning, Mr Morgan.”
The phone on the counter a few feet away rang loudly, making them both snap out of whatever was happening. John cleared his throat and turned away; Sherlock crouched over the guest book. Using the pencil, he slowly rubbed the side of the tip against the paper to reveal the outline of the indentation.
Small clenched his jaw before accepting it was useless to keep fighting.
John draped his coat across the back of a chair and stood there, his eyes lingering on his partner, watching him as he hung his suit jacket on the back of the computer chair and rolled up his shirt sleeves.
BOYLE
“Like what?” Stamford asked.
He was working on the second stitch when Holmes spoke.
Amy turns with a high pitched squeal of surprise before slapping a hand over her mouth to silence herself. Sherlock is standing there with his hands behind his back, looking haunting, with John by his side, arms crossed, looking unimpressed.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, he could see the ease with which John held it, the practiced movement as he tested its strength and tension with both hands, giving the tool a slight arc before letting his arm drop down to his side.
Stamford stood at the end of the conference table. “Tomorrow is the take down and Saturday is the wrap party, which is why I’ve called you here tonight. I need your full attention one last time.”
“I have a confession to make.” John’s voice was barely above a whisper. “I’m obsessed with your mouth. Your lips. How they would look around my cock.”
“You were amazing too. I’m sorry I was so—”
“And that is precisely why we are having this meeting, because I…” Stamford took a deep breath. “I need your help. I-I have no options left. We lost Anderson, I’m stuck in a clause with Morgan that prevents me from imposing a new lead actor, and he refuses to work with anyone I can afford.” Stamford looked at his feet. He wasn’t expecting to find it so hard to say this without being able to tell them they were fighting for their own jobs. “I’m not… I’m not trying to manipulate you into saying yes out of pity, even though I admit I’m not far from being desperate enough to beg.” He looked around the table. “What I’m asking all of you is to help prep him to audition for Morgan. I know this all sounds mad, but I really believe in this kid. He’s a big risk, and one I’m willing to take. But I can’t do it without your help. Only by working together do we have a chance to pull this off.”
“Up.”
“I still don’t-”
Watson scoffed. “It’s a musical, it’s not meant to be realistic. It’s not like people actually use a song and dance routine to declare their love in real life.”
He let himself gravitate towards the crops, taking one off the rack. It was fine leather, springy, good quality. He had tested it on himself once. He wanted to know what the horse would feel. It had hurt, obviously. Even after all his research, Sherlock was perplexed by pain in a sexual context. He understood how some people could be aroused by domination, by causing pain. But experiencing pleasure from pain? Besides the appeal of the endorphin release after long term exposure to pain, it left him baffled.
“You’re certain it’s still there?” Sherlock asked Mycroft.
Holmes jumps to solve a case.
Ms Adler scoffed. “Dear God, no. He was repulsive, could not take no for an answer.”
She wasn’t sure if it was hers or John’s stubbornness that made her tip over, it didn’t matter, it was too late, she couldn’t stop her orgasm from over taking her body even if she wanted too.
“Tony told us to come through the back,” Holmes replied. “Didn’t mention the fence was locked.”
“Yes, you’re doing the look again.”
“Working at the Warehouse.”
“Nope.”
Stamford didn’t move.
“Hey!” Ms Hawkins cut in. “Holmes, I give directions, not you.”
No, it would have been too dangerous.
“I’m sorry Stamford.” Lestrade offered.
He heavily made his way to the kitchen sink to down a glass of water. Ignoring his nausea, John considered going back to bed for an hour, but figured a shower would probably do more good.
Walking down the stairs, he could see Sherlock through the open door of the living room, standing in front of the window, looking out onto the world as he played. As John set foot inside, Sherlock turned and stopped.
“Good. Now, let’s go through the evening once together.”
John straightened his back, mimicked throwing a scarf over his shoulder and stared at Sherlock. “Now say the line as if you’re the Queen’s dog sitting on her lap posing for a painting.”
“It gives off a signal to make it easier to locate.” Mycroft explained, making John look at his partner, somewhat concerned, but he couldn't see his face.
Terry you don’t understand. These two are destined to be together.
He headed to the pharmacy to inspect its contents. Watson hesitated a bit before moving to the desk and searching it for the second time today.
“You keep saying that. It doesn’t make it true.”
“Of?”
She shook her head and tried vehemently to focus on her task.
All three smiled tightly at Ms Hooper as they headed for the stairs. Lestrade slowed his pace so Watson could keep up.
John cursed and watched with half lidded eyes as Sherlock rubbed and massaged her clit, particularly intrigued by all of the external physical spasms it induced. She could see John try to keep them under control, but by the time her every breath was coming out as little moans John had let go. So, Sherlock moved back to licking her vulva languorously and tried to push in her tongue. It caused John’s head to hit the back of the chair.
Watson felt grateful to help with the case, but even more for the chance to experience it through Holmes’s eyes. He was seeing Hollywood through a new lens and was excited to see where it would lead them.
SHERLOCK
Sitting in the leather chair, his leg elevated on the ottoman with a bag of ice wrapped in a flannel on his sprained ankle, Sherlock put down his container. John was sitting in the chair in front of him, not even halfway through his supper.
to be found.” Irene added with a playful smile.
“It was only a matter of time until you got sick of hearing Lennox complain, to which you would insist I gag him. So I’ve spared us the pain of it all by knocking him out. We can wake him up when we’re done so he can take us to the Indigo Club.”
“What did you want to be when you were young?”
John arrived by cab at six o’clock sharp. Impressive considering London traffic. Sherlock’s heart pounded in his ears as he watched him step out, carrying what looked like a heavy duffle bag.
He never really bothered with fantasies but imagining John testing the paddles on his bare arse had quite an effect.
“Move Watson,” Ms Adler ordered.
Watson pushed down his urge to punch Holmes. “Fine. What do you want me to think about?”
The police officer stops running to catch his breath and grabs his shoulder radio.
Watson frowned when he got to the second paragraph of the article, and rolled his eyes when he recognised Magnussen’s name as the author. He put down the paper and watched Stamford pace.
“Can I examine your pubic hair?”
“Watson!”
“You’re lucky we can’t hear the violin yet.” John told Sherlock as they walked into an almost empty primary school. The setting sun was pouring through the tall windows as they stood in the lobby, not quite sure which way to go.
“Yeah, it’s not like a little bomb can take us out.” He heard Jones add.
Sherlock needed to prepare.
“We’re not doing the whole chasing after him bit?” John would have like to blow off a bit of steam.
“Even if it makes thousands of people happy?” Stamford argued.
Stake-out and sillyness continues.
.” Holmes said softly, looking Ms Riley in the eyes.
John could swear the GPS was talking slowly just to annoy him. “Mission upload.” He enunciated clearly, sarcasm dripping off every syllable.
“Tell me.”
“I work at
Are you hurt?
Stamford broke the silence. “Is it really over?”
Stamford looked dumbfounded. “I never thought of it that way.”
When she came out, Sherlock cornered her under the stove lamp to get a look at the result. She held John in place with her body while her fingers combed her hair and singled out individual strands to look at under the artificial light.
“A Warehouse agent? Me?”
“All we know is that they aren’t keeping them.” Mycroft answered.
As they arrived in front of their dressing room doors, Holmes spotted Watson out of the corner of his eye and tried not to smirk. He then turned to Ms Adler, keeping hold of her hand and he gazed down at her lovingly. She smiled up at Holmes wickedly.
It was about noon when he had gotten the call. His platoon, including Major Sholto, had gotten ambushed the day before. There were no survivors. Everyone Watson had been with before getting discharged, they were all gone. All at once.
Holmes stared at him before speaking, his voice barely above a whisper. "Of course I love you."
Sherlock raises an eyebrow and looks at Amy suspiciously.
“As I said before, I’m offering you a job.”
“The hose!” Sherlock screamed as he jumped out of the way of a jab and stumbled to the floor. He flipped onto his back and lifted his leg just in time to stop the moving artifact; one foot on the breastplate while he blocked the sword with his own, a bit too close to his face for his liking. The Armor’s blade scratched the floor next to Sherlock’s head, leaving a mark in the concrete.
“To make it soft.”
The reporters laughed, and a pleased smile grew on Stamford’s face.
“LSD for short. A potent synthetic hallucinogenic drug.”
Holmes nodded and was surprised to find his eyes looking for Watson as they slowly walked into the theatre.
“Disease Outbreak Control Department. You need to answer the question Mrs. Turner.” Sherlock insisted, deadpan.
“Kissing, foreplay, things like that.”
SHERLOCK
Watson shook his head and tried not to smile. “Certainly is.” He climbed out of the car. “Thanks for the ride. See you tomorrow.”
Sherlock leaned into the touch and would have purred if he was able to.
“It’s been a long day for all of us.” Mycroft answered quietly before leaving the office. John stood in the middle of the room with a worried look. Sherlock eyed him and spoke.
“We’re with the Disease Outbreak Control Department.” Sherlock said as he flashed his badge. “This violin is infected with a dangerous virus, hand it over now.” The little girl’s eyes widened with fear. She looked from Sherlock to the violin as panic covered her face, her hands letting go of it. “No!” Sherlock shouted as he lunged to catch the instrument before it hit the floor. The girl started crying and went to hug the teacher who was clearly worried about the girl touching her but still couldn’t refuse to comfort her. John gave her an apologetic look as he bent down to retrieve the violin case, not bothering to help Sherlock get off the floor.
He took a sidestep and leaned closer to Lestrade. “How did you meet him anyway?”
“What have I gotten myself into?” Watson muttered under his breath, right behind the tall man. They headed left down the corridor, silently hoping not to meet any more guards. The man made quick work of the checkpoint. They ran straight to the doors that lead to the stairs. Lucky for them, there was no keypad needed to enter the stairs. They ran two floors up. Watson couldn’t believe it when an emergency exit was waiting for them on ground level in the stairwell. The team must be giving the guards a run for their money if they didn’t meet anyone on their way out. Before he knew it, they were running outside, ducking for cover by the bins. Watson could see that the chopper hadn’t been called yet. Checking behind them to see if they had been followed, the soldier leaned against the container, catching his breath. He always loved the sensation of the adrenaline rush during a mission. He could feel a grin pulling at his lips.
Sherlock held John’s stare while he unbuttoned his shirt. As he reached the bottom, he untucked it from his trousers, aware of how much attention he drew to his cock. With a brush of his hands, the shirt slid off Sherlock’s shoulders, the fabric bunching in the crook of his elbows.
Holmes let his head fall back and moaned. “This case better turn out to be more than a 7...”
Ms Hooper turned to Holmes, who was smiling at her as well, and making her blush all over again.
“If you had just gone through a trial and were being exiled to an island by the empire you helped build, how would you feel?” John was unsure if it was rhetorical, being unused to his partner asking about his opinion on an artifact, or artifact related things, until the agent carried on speaking. Doing what John had started calling the
anything. Tampered doesn’t mean it’s a time bomb.”
Here we are, one year later witih 80k and a song/video.
touch…
Lives were at stake, and all Sherlock could think of was asking to get spanked again.
“Are you pleased with the result?”
“What, playing nurse in the field?” Jones asked bitterly. Watson knew that Jones was only saying that because he was pissed, but it didn’t stop him from wanting to punch the prick. Neeson looked at Watson’s clenched fist. He knew that Watson wouldn’t punch him in the plane, but if Jones pushed more, he might have it coming once on the ground. It wouldn’t be the first time.
“In this industry, let’s just say the rules get bent a little.” Stamford laughed nervously. “You know how it is.”
Morgan, Holmes and Ms Adler were in the middle of figuring out a scene, discussing Edward’s entrance. Even though they had rehearsed it, now that they were on set, it didn’t work like it had in rehearsal.
“Act?”
“The classical music playing.” John answered as he put the man’s arm around his shoulders to better carry him back. Sherlock looked at John with alarm.
Murray nodded. “Fair enough.”
Lestrade sighed and mumbled something under his breath as he went to cuff Hank. John helped Lestrade get Hank to his feet, then went to Sherlock while Lestrade walked Hank to his car.
“Well technically you don’t exist.” Sherlock muttered under his breath.
“Holmes, that’s Frank Hudson’s wife. We’re in Frank Hudson’s place.” Watson said in a panicked whisper.
Coffee in hand, Watson turned to look at the crew setting up. That’s when he spotted it: Holmes was watching the room. If Watson hadn’t learned the technique in the army, he wouldn’t have noticed.
The LED lights on the card reader flashed from red to green. Jones pushed open the door and stood aside to let the others pass with a smug face.
“Seriously? Have you heard nothing of what I’ve said all day? This is because of
Four.
Give me the pity shirt, I’ll show it the love it deserves. It will have a special place in my closet, next to Terry’s ripped shirts.
Chester isn’t going inside, he’s untying the barge.
“Shit! The alarm! Why didn’t you take care of that before?” John demanded loudly. He turned to see Sherlock get an odd looking cylinder out of his coat and connect it to the alarm system flashing on the wall next to the door. John approached him and he could see a row of numbers on the cylinder that started turning and switching. After a couple of seconds, the number sequence stopped and the lights turned green, silencing the alarm. John wanted to ask how the cylinder worked, but it wasn’t really the best time.
Holmes felt himself relax when Watson’s leg press against his in the dark. He hadn’t realised how nervous he was.
“I’ll shake you a little and see what falls out,” Ms Adler replied under her breath, loud enough for only Holmes to hear.
Holmes bit his lip and nodded.
The heavy reinforced metal door of the office creaked loudly as John opened the latch and pushed it open. Sighing loudly, he closed it behind him and looked around the empty office. The experiment table had been tidied. No, cleared, which was odd. Very odd. He was about to take out his Farnsworth to call Sherlock when he noticed him in the Warehouse surveillance cameras. He couldn’t tell if he was walking back to the office since he wasn’t familiar enough with the layout, but the important thing was that he hadn’t gone somewhere without saying.
Of course it was too good to be true.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but nods. John squeezes his shoulder before he leaves.
Watson lowered the paper enough to look at Holmes. “Well, you’re describing most people in Hollywood.”
“Yeah.”
Watson was pleased to hear his British accent. “You as well.”
Jones paused, finding the question curious. “I’m pretty sure that’s the sentence that’s waiting for him in court.”
“I didn’t know the police consulted amateurs.”
There was a brief pause as Holmes spun her out and back in.
Watson shook his head. “Do whatever you want, just don’t put make-up on the stitches.”
John was also starting to understand that it had nothing to do with the job.
Ms Adler turned to Holmes and winked. “You owe me two favours now.”
SHERLOCK
John didn’t know if Sherlock’s pause was for dramatic effect or to leave him a moment to grasp what he was trying to explain.
Sherlock took out his Farnsworth, his fingers flying across the screen. “Why didn’t I-?”
He turned to look at his partner and his eyes widened. “Oh my God.”
“Not good, that’s what that is.” Irene stated.
Holmes was even more confused when he saw Lestrade turn away as he fought off a smile. Before he could ask what was so funny, they heard the rhythmic thud of Watson’s cane coming closer.
Sherlock’s morning hard-on twitched. He covered his head with a pillow and screamed.
Sherlock eyed him sideways. “Really not good.”
“Aren’t pirates mostly criminals?”
Then it all came back.
“We need to see the guest book.” Sherlock told the desk clerk as soon as they walked into the lobby.
Sherlock pursed his lips. “You do realise you could have bribed him with five dollars?”
Holmes looked up with a mix of emotions in his eyes. His muscles and tendons flexing against Watson’s grip on his wrists as Holmes managed to raise his head off the floor, bringing it dangerously close to Watson’s face. He stopped, close enough to look down at Watson’s lips before staring up into his eyes.
He led them to a small Indian restaurant a few streets down. John read the file while they waited for their order. Well, John’s order. Sherlock didn’t want anything, despite John’s insistence.
You want to talk it out?
“You should sleep in your bed for your ankle.” John insisted as he crossed his arms.
“Then I will continue not to make that mistake.”
Holmes rolled his eyes. “And why would I kill myself?”
It wasn’t a command, but a soft request. With a flutter in his chest, Sherlock took a step forward.
“I need your help.” Sherlock was grateful his voice sounded normal.
“From the Brothers Grimm original tale Cinderella. The mother gave the stepsisters a knife to cut off a part of their foot to fit inside the shoe. Although it wasn’t a glass slipper in the original.”
“You’re just out of shape.” Holmes finished his drink as well.
“How-?” The man said in disbelief.
“What did you say?”
“Tell me, and we’ll let you go.”
Molly closed her eyes and fought against the flush she could feel creeping up her neck, the sudden heat wave coming out of her collar. She had no idea how she managed to open her eyes and keep working.
He side-eyed Holmes but looked at the floor as he spoke. “Thank you. For this, the movie. Replacing Anderson.”
Holmes was already dressed in his tuxedo and waiting in Stamford’s office, waiting for Watson.
“Oh, one last thing,” he said before stepping out. “Who or what is Hitchcock?”
Dimmock chuckled, stretched his arms and played a C chord. “I promise.”
Sherlock was on the edge of panic. He should have addressed this as soon as he had read John mention the lingerie on his blog. Although admittedly, he wasn’t expecting John to make it this far.
“Ms Adler will do us the honour of joining you for your audition.”
“With the help of a Mesopotamian artifact, the Warehouse developed a system that allows us to encase their bodies into bronze, preserving them indefinitely. Kind of like mummification.”
She stopped breathing, panic striking in fear that everything would stop when they saw her standing there. A small voice told Molly it was probably for the best. Another, much stronger voice, told her to close the door before John’s moans attracted attention.
Watson stifled a laugh.
“It was rehearsal,” Lestrade offered as an excuse.
This would be the "surprise" I had been hinting at in the opening notes.
Stamford stood and smoothed his waist coat. “Holmes, this restaurant, this date with Ms Adler, it’s almost more important than the Press Conference. This evening is meant for you to get a good word out about the movie, and people will only do that if they like you. And the people that will be there, they’re directors, producers, actors, agents, casting directors. They are the who’s who of Hollywood. They are the ones that will make you or break you. And same goes for the movie. If you and Ms Adler do this right, this movie will be the talk of the town.” He paused. “Only in a good way, not in a cursed way. Thankfully, you will have the best partner in Hollywood to navigate you around the sharks.” He finished, doing his best to sound hopeful and supportive.
“What does it matter? It didn’t work.” The agent leaned against the wall, stuffing his free hand in his coat pocket. He was getting that slight over aged teenager tone that made John cringe.
There were two men seated with Ms Adler when he returned.
“Nothing.”
“You stay calm in dangerous situations. You have a natural instinct for things that are out of place. Among other things.” The man answered with chosen words. Watson looked at him sideways, taking in the fact that if he worked here, this would be his boss.
“Or that they all made purchases in this shop within 36 hours of their deaths?”
Prepared words fell short on his lips as he saw John stretch to hang a coil of bright red rope. It made his tight black t-shirt reveal a stripe of skin above his jeans. Jeans that also did delightful things to his arse.
“Do I need to remind you we’re already in the middle of something? What harm could it possibly cause that is more important than that glowing ball of energy?”
This particular artifact had been owned by WWII veteran, John Giltoy. He had been part of The Battle of Bataan that had lasted three months. It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino History. The 90,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese were forced marched over a hundred kilometers from Mariveles, on the southern end of Bataan Peninsula, to Camp O’Donnell. Starved, mistreated, often kicked or beaten on their way, those who fell were bayoneted, decreasing their numbers by thousands during the journey. During the march, Giltoy's friend, Roy Schrop, became deathly ill and their captors wanted to leave him for dead. With only 30 kilometers to go, Giltoy helped his friend walk, repeating "You can do this" over and over again, until his wish came true.
“Why would you be involved?”
“Why do you ask?” Watson crossed his arms.
“Don’t fight the pain, just accept it.”
“Anderson just arrived, he was rehearsing with Wiggins.”
“Of course not. If we had time travelled we wouldn’t be in black and white.”
“Answer the question.”
“You of all people should know that seconds count when you’re saving lives.”
I thought the river tour was this afternoon.
Sherlock had two simultaneous reactions by two completely different parts of his brain. His amygdala, which got wrapped up in the idea of John being his friend, and his frontal lobe, running different scenarios of what the hesitation in John’s delivery could imply.
John frowned at the tall man for his lack of tact, which didn’t seem to affect Bishop as he looked into Lily’s eyes. “One more second with her is a happier ending than a lifetime without her.”
“What happened to you?” John wheezed.
She released the lobe and whispered. “Is she watching?”
“I’d like to get spanked by you. Naked. Repeatedly.”
“John?”
He turned to Molly. “It doesn’t matter what they sell. You’re here as a distraction.”
, how he wished he did. How he wished they could get another chance, wished he had a medical kit.
“No need. I have everything at the flat.”
Sherlock could not hold back the satisfied smirk that spread across her face. John shook her head and rolled her eyes, but she was still smiling. If turned into something else entirely when Sherlock licked and bit her lip. Contrasting with the initial clinical movements, she made a show of slowly putting her hands on the seat of the chair on either side of John’s waist and leaning forward dauntingly. She held her body over hers without touching, leaning closer and closer until her face was breath away from John’s.
“Of course not.” Sherlock protested with a repulsed look.
“Yes.” Stamford admitted with a hushed tone.
“He was also in shock. Ms Hawkins took care of him. Had him settled in the infirmary.”
Watson and Wilder had worked night and day the last two weeks in an attempt to finish the movie on time. Which meant that Stamford started to panic when they weren’t finished three hours before and had Holmes bring Watson’s clothes for the evening to the studio.
Holmes stared at her, blinking quickly.
“As simple as that?”
Watson was about to ask when it struck him. “Oh no.”
“What’s this?” Watson asked Holmes, raising the annotated script in his hand.
Watson was on the couch in Stamford’s office, staring at the ceiling. Again.
“It’s not improbable, it’s impossible.” Sherlock argued, spinning around angrily to speak to Mycroft.
Holmes practiced the song and dance until nine, when the building was being locked down for the night. He went back to his hotel and paced his room, trying to get comfortable with Edward. He played with his speaking rhythm, his voice. He watched himself in the mirror and went through the entire script three times, slowly finding Edwards voice, his diction, his drawls.
Watson turned his head to lean his forehead on Holmes’s shoulder. “Oh god.”
“You were right.”
John smiled tightly. “Partner.” And ushered her in, making sure she didn’t see him give Sherlock his best
“That’s not-” Holmes started to protest before cutting himself off. “The important thing is, I gained her trust.”
“I thought you were enjoying yourself.”
“You don’t look like the type that works well with others, you’re reckless, and bit of a brat.”
“The past week has been an interesting anthropological experiment in microcosms, and how teamwork, or rather the combination of all the participants strengths, can produce a piece of art that is not only an aesthetically pleasing, but also solicits specific universal emotions in the audience. These can lead to a powerful message that has the potential to change the way one can view the world. I’m sure you’re familiar with the war propaganda, which just proves my point on the power that cinema can-”
“How?” Ms Riley exclaimed.
“I was going to say it’s a bit boring, but uh, yeah, that too.”
Holmes chuckled and wiped his mouth with his serviette before slipping out of the booth. “Would you do me the honour of dancing with me?” He offered her his hand hopefully.
“What did he do with it?”
“Call me if there’s anything.” John added loudly.
“An artefact sighting. When the Warehouse computer detects a possible artefact it goes ping.” Sherlock said as he put away his violin.
John cleared his throat and unconsciously stood at the ready. “So, uh, how bad is it exactly?”
. While holding down a murderer.
“What?” John asked, finally noticing his partner and turning to face him. “What’s it? Are you still not listening to me?”
She opened the door and waved them in, throwing her cigarette away before stepping inside.
“I still have to write the finale.”
“Of course.”
Noice.
The barge, we know, that’s why we need a boat. Someone is trying to steal the barge.
“I was hoping it could be.” Watson said tentatively. “I’ve… never been on a date with a man.”
“Morgan!” Ms Hawkins gasped again.
“When?” He asked drily.
“We we’re sent to Taiwan to get some intel. We mostly did search and rescue back then, but once in a while we would go on intel missions. Manning hated those, said he wasn’t trained to take pictures for a living.”
Amy and Jake walk into the bullpen.
“Yeah, you never did tell me what happened to your partners. Were you as much as a prick with them as you are with me?”
“False? My dear Sherlock, I do worry about you. How could you think otherwise?”
“Good.”
Stamford chuckled despite himself.
“What is this about?”
It stayed facing down until after the memorial service.
“Yeah, but how could anyone come to know about these things? Or actually
“No. It’s better for her to cry now than to destroy everything and everyone around her, and most likely hurting herself in the process.”
Holmes rolled his eyes and spoke to Stamford in a reassuring tone. “I’m trying to say that you’re an honest man.”
Ms Adler chuckled. “Break a leg, Mr Holmes.” and slipped her hand around Morgan’s arm. “After you, Morgan.”
“The downside, John. Now look at me, just keep your eyes on me.” Sherlock said as he backed away from John towards the end of the aisle.
“What, it kills you or something?”
Can someone please explain who Homie and Doctor Whatshisname are?
If John hadn’t been so distracted by his own arousal, he would have noticed Sherlock’s hand twitch before he tightened it into a fist.
.” Ms Hawkins looked from Holmes to Ms Hooper as they prepped for the next song. “And
“John, don’t exaggerate. We did not destroy your reputation. We were alerted of what happened in Qatar and took the precautionary measures to cover up the real story. We recruited you in the process because you show all the necessary qualifications to become a Warehouse Agent.”
did you put madder in- no, you know what? I don’t want to know, not this time, just…” She took a deep breath. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“No,” Sherlock corrected him, “the Yard consults me.”
Wiggins joined Stamford, Watson, Ms Hooper and Ms Kate as the audience, while Dimmock played the piano. Holmes and Ms Adler were a joy to watch together, see them try to surprise one another, make the other break character. By the end they got carried away showing off, but the overall effect worked well with what Watson had in mind. They just needed to refine it a bit.
John groaned at the question, rubbing his face with his hand. “Four hours the first time. Ninety minutes the second. Good timing on the second; found it just before they announced the shops were closing. I just hope it’s still going to be there tomorrow.”
Bow: front of the ship
He heard John’s voice before he saw him. He was serving another customer. They were in front of the rope display discussing options. Sherlock listened closely, curious to see how he interacted with other patrons. His blog post had implied that the encounter with Sherlock was an anomaly, but was that true?
I could talk about this chapter for ages.
“Action!”
But she was staring at Molly with that look.
“I’d say so yeah.” He answered, doing his best to ignore the feeling. He instead concentrated on standing up. “You ok?” John asked as he dusted himself off and offered his hand to Sherlock.
Sherlock stumbled as he obeyed, forgetting his trousers and pants were around his knees, and because he couldn’t stop shaking.
