Castiel looked away uncomfortably. ‘He doesn’t dive…well. He can go down and come back up, and that’s about it. He has to go very slow for anything else. He’s just not…coordinated,’ he explained.
Dean's grin widened as he slapped the cuff onto Castiel's wrist. 'Yes!' he exclaimed in triumph, feeling the warmth settle over him.
‘First retaliatory death,’ Crowley said as he picked up his glass. ‘It’s something that should be celebrated. So, we celebrated.’
Castiel choked out a sob as he lost the fight against the command. He felt his power surge through his arm and into Dean. But…there was no scream.
Sam nodded. He still felt sorrow at the loss, but it was nowhere near as painful as it had been in the beginning.
Karen laughed as she set about mixing ingredients. ‘Of course not,’ she replied. ‘Angels refuse to tell Hunters that there’s more to it than just a little binding spell, and a Hunter that loses an angel won’t tell anyone out of embarrassment.’ She looked up at Dean and grinned. ‘Bobby wasn’t my first Hunter.’
Dean nodded and bit his lip. His mate had been very adamant about wanting to study Sam’s behavior before and after learning about Castiel’s knowledge, and he thought it would be fun and exciting to keep it a secret. He let himself relax, and his erection slipped back into hiding.
.’ He gave Bobby an even stare. ‘And if they aren’t loyal and run on the side of not quite human, well then… I just introduce them to Cassie.’
The afternoon was spent with Sam showing Gabriel some of his favorite spots. Small waterfalls, some secluded ponds, and a few of the natural alcoves along the coastline. He ended the tour behind the hotel.
Over the next two weeks, Castiel was pitted against vampires, werewolves, and a few shifters. His days were filled with training, and his nights were filled with fighting sleep. When he passed out from exhaustion, Lucifer would be right there, waiting. He fought Lucifer’s questions, but it was all for naught. Lucifer already knew the answers.
'He started at least fifty wars between peaceful nations, and that's what he admitted to,' Sam replied. 'Burned down hundreds of churches—'
Gabriel let out a sob as pain ran down his spine. He could feel the blood dripping down his chin, and his vision was blurring. If he could fight it just a little longer, maybe he would pass out from the pain. A hand guided his chin so that he faced Sam. He saw moving lips, but couldn’t hear what was being said. But he did feel another jolt from the cuff. He clamped his eyes shut, and trembled in Sam’s hold. He opened his mouth to beg the Hunter to stop, but what came out was far from a plea.
‘Good example: I want to kill Sam and Dean for taking my boys. Slowly torture them, make them beg for death. I want to slice that fat gut of yours and watch your intestines spill to the floor because you’re housing those two,’ Crowley said, ignoring Bobby’s indignant squawk. ‘The only thing that’s stopping me is that I’d rather have you on my side.’
‘Shooting some scenes,’ Castiel replied. ‘I still have to work while I’m here, but I will make time for us.’ He groaned miserably as he dropped his head onto Dean’s chest. ‘Balthazar’s gonna want to go back to our original schedule…’
,’ he said, completely aware of how his voice wavered. He risked a glance at Balthazar and stopped at the resigned look he was receiving.
Dean yelped and curled in on himself as his good foot rammed into his broken ankle in an effort to shift his position. He groaned as the movement only caused him more pain. He was vaguely aware of a concerned voice calling his name and gentle fingers running over his hair. He looked up and gave Castiel a pained smile. ‘I’m good,’ he said.
Castiel pulled his gaze from his reflection and directed it at his brother. 'I just don't understand
‘I drink water,’ Castiel replied. After waking up with a mystery tattoo, he wasn’t too keen on the idea of getting drunk again.
‘Even though I could make it back to land, it would be an inconvenient trip,’ Castiel replied. He grimaced at Balthazar’s sour expression. ‘No. I mean, yes. I’ll stay.’
Demons, on the other hand, had no wings. They were able to sift through the air as a thick, black cloud of smoke, and their eyes were fully colored. White, black, red, or gold.
Gabriel looked to Sam. All he got was a shrug and a sympathetic look. He sighed in resignation. With a snap of his fingers, the rickety stairs were instantly replaced with polished, marble steps. 'There. That's better.'
‘Er…local bar?’ Gabriel looked back at Sam and forced a smile. ‘It’s not an insult. It’s just…what they’re called? Cas goes to ‘em all the time. He didn’t even bat an eye when the guy came at him with a knife!’
Crowley turned back to the door and traced his fingers over a few of the sigils. They glowed under the contact, and the edges of the door lightly glowed. ‘We don’t have much time. Gabriel might not show up on the radar, but
'Ellen called about a week ago. Said that some hunters going to Elm Creek, Nebraska ended up with nothin'. Vampires fled the town. Demons won't go near the place,' Bobby explained. 'No idea when it started.'
Castiel groggily stepped into hallway, pushing a struggling Gabriel in front of him. ‘Come on. You can’t avoid them forever,’ he said, guiding them down the stairwell.
Dean sat up and obediently removed his shoes as he watched Castiel rummage through a dresser drawer. He pulled off his jeans and boxers, too, relaxing when he no longer had to deal with the constant contact of the cloth on his legs. He thought he had a good handle of how human sex worked, and Sam had even been so kind as to explain the merits and functionality of condoms, but he still had his doubts.
,’ Dean all but growled. He surged forward and claimed Castiel’s lips with his own. Teeth clashed, and Dean angled his head to gain better access to Castiel’s mouth. He winced but didn’t stop when Castiel’s hand came to rest on his side, calloused fingers brushing against his skin.
He couldn’t keep the smile off his face. At least, not until he recognized the car parked outside his apartment building. All because of a stupid 80s movie… The moment Castiel had turned eighteen, he pulled his inheritance out and spent it on a black ’67 Camaro and had it fixed up. Every last cent meant to put him through college…wasted.
Castiel sighed as he picked up a fork. ‘Supposedly, they can breathe underwater. And above. Maybe they’re amphibians. I suggest not thinking about it.’
Sam let out a relieved laugh. ‘That doesn’t change the fact that there are people coming that want to find you.’
Dean stilled, breathing heavily. He pulled away, looking at Castiel in trepidation. He had managed to loosen Castiel's tie even more. Castiel's shirt was unbuttoned and untucked, and his belt was partially undone. Dean could see the growing erection straining against loose fabric. He looked at Castiel's face, tinted a rosy pink. What was he doing? Castiel's Grace was pulsating about him with what was clearly desire. Dean really wanted to fulfill that desire. But he couldn't. He couldn't do that to Castiel. Castiel was so pure and innocent, Dean couldn't bring himself to drag Castiel down and corrupt him.
‘Oh! Sorry! Right, uh…’ Anna wiped at her eyes, still giggling. ‘Yeah, that sounds great. Just hand it over to Samandriel when it’s ready.’
Seraphiel’s head shot up, and bright green eyes stared. Hundreds of glittering eyes of varying shades of green opened along his body, each zeroing in on Castiel. He ducked his head and looked away. ‘
Gabriel shrugged and dropped his arms to his sides. ‘And that’s why…I needed you to sign that waiver.’
Sam stared at the rippling water beneath his feet. A bathtub just didn’t have the same feel as the ocean. He had snuck into a pool once, but the chlorine had left him itching for weeks after. He knew that if he jumped in, he would probably leave everything he had behind. He was happy with his current life. Sharks didn’t stalk people on land.
‘Well… Here, how’s about you tell me just why you said the Hunter was the only accident?’ Dean asked.
‘It’s a kind of uh…what’s the word…mucus,’ Dean replied. He smiled uncertainly as he waited for Castiel’s reaction.
Gabriel sighed. As he trudged up the narrow stairwell to his small apartment, he wondered just what made Castiel decide to stay the night. Was he having a fight with his roommate again? Did another ex turn up, claiming they could fix him?
in your sleep. Usually it’s weird ass shit about cats and bees, but lately? “Dean, please, more” tends to be mantra now.’
‘That’s not true,’ Dean argued. ‘It works. Maybe not that great, but it works. I’ll figure it out. Just give me one week. That’s all I’m asking for.’ He gave Castiel a light kiss. ‘Please?’
Gabriel dropped back next to Sam, letting his pants fall to his ankles. ‘Let’s see here… Boat ride across the lagoon. Gee, I
‘You are so lucky! It looks like he realized pretty quickly that you weren’t food,’ Castiel said as he leaned in to get a closer look, dislodging Muffin from his lap. ‘This could have been a lot worse…’
‘No.’ Gabriel crossed his arms and glared up at Castiel. ‘The sooner I get you out of the safe house, the sooner I can get a good night’s sleep. Believe me. You wouldn’t be the first to sleep with their target,’ he said.
Dean could have sworn his heart stopped. He stared, unseeing, as he listened to the sound of thin metal clattering against the floor. He was vaguely aware of Castiel standing and walking around him.
Castiel smiled and pecked Dean’s lips. ‘It’s okay. I’ve got plenty of experience. I’ll show you.’ He pressed forward again, blindly aiming for Dean’s mouth. He caught the side and kissed his way to the front, nipping and sucking. He gently bit down on Dean’s lower lip and tugged on it. He giggled when Dean pushed him down and joined in the kiss.
‘Stay away from me! Please!!’ Castiel stumbled and fell against the kitchen counter. His eyes fell on the wooden block that held the knives. He held his breath as he watched his own hand reach out and pull the large carving knife free. He shivered and clenched his eyes shut as a hand touched his shoulder.
Castiel unmuted his phone and schooled his features. ‘It’s a deal, but I think you should be aware of the fact that you have some competition,’ he said lightly.
He shoved the food he was carrying at Gabriel and marched up to the bathroom door. He tried the handle, only to find it locked.
Castiel let himself fall back against the pillows with a soft moan. He didn’t know if he was enjoying being manhandled or not. He was already hard from Dean’s light touches, fingers slowly running the length of his cock and around his balls, following his taint to his anus. He let out a pitiful moan as Dean coaxed his legs further and further apart. Obligingly, he brought his knees up and spread his thighs for Dean to get a better look, hoping the action would spur Dean into doing something more interesting.
Castiel threw the keys into the small room. ‘I never claimed to be innocent!’ he shouted. ‘So I’ve made mistakes! Plenty of them I’ve made with Crowley!’ He crossed his arms and looked away, his eyes resting on the fishing vessel. It wasn’t
Castiel’s smile dropped instantly as he remembered a night full of too much tequila. ‘Oh, God,’ he whispered. ‘No. No, no, no… I thought I dreamt that! It’s not what you think! Fuck! It’s gotta look bad… I-it’s not… It was for
Dean smiled and lightly kissed Castiel’s lips. ‘Won’t tell you not to worry about it, ‘cuz I know you will anyway. But…I think things’ll be just fine.’
‘Yes it is. I’m a…a fuck up, and I’ve ruined everything.’ Castiel was grateful when Muffin didn’t struggle as he pulled the cat closer.
Dean watched curiously as a short man in a doctor’s coat entered the room, pulling a small dart gun from his pocket. He narrowed his eyes as he recognized the slicked-back blond hair. ‘You’re not a doctor!’
‘What? A ring? What ring?!’ Dean asked as he struggled to keep his head above the water. He managed to pull himself to the edge of the plunge pool next to Castiel. He glared at Crowley’s feet and hissed through his teeth.
‘Sorry! Sorry!’ Charlie said as she scooted along the wall. She had a small bag and a towel in her arms.
He breathed deeply when Castiel reached out with his Grace. He allowed the soft touch, and his breath escaped in a whimper when Castiel’s Grace fully enveloped him. He needed more. He closed the distance between them and pulled Castiel into a hug.
‘It did,’ Michael admitted. ‘So I sent Balthazar in to find out why a demon would go to all that trouble for an angel.’
‘Then why is Dean researching binding cuffs like his life depends on it?’ Balthazar asked in a knowing tone.
‘That’s more than a few,’ Sam pointed out. He wondered where Gabriel kept them. There were about twenty in the envelope. ‘When did you start…collecting them?’
Castiel stared at Balthazar with a stiff smile plastered on his face. ‘Yes,’ he weakly replied. ‘That certainly explains why they uh…like me.’
Crowley froze as Castiel’s sobs suddenly stopped. He let out a nervous laugh and glanced between the two men staring at him intently. ‘I uh… I’ve only met the one. Rude little thing, I might add,’ he said slowly.
Gabriel sighed and walked up to the desk. He gave the woman behind the desk a winning smile. ‘Hi! I’m Gabriel. I guess I need to sign something?’
Dean reluctantly let go. ‘But it feels good. A lot better than normal me. And it looks weird. Do they all look like this?’ he asked in a worried tone.
'Dad's not here to “disapprove,”' Gabriel said as he shoveled what looked to be mostly syrup into his mouth.
Anna sighed. ‘I didn’t know he was that attached to you,’ she admitted. ‘And…he knows just what to say to piss me off.’
With shaky legs, Castiel ascended the stairs, wincing as they creaked under his weight. He reached the top and headed for the kitchen. Leaning against the doorframe, he stared into the kitchen. ‘N-no…’
Castiel pressed himself into a corner and wiped the tears from his face. He shook his head as the demon was brought closer. ‘No…please don’t…’
‘Dean!’ Castiel rushed to Dean’s side. He carefully set the camera equipment down and placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder. ‘Are you okay?’
‘Oh, um… Yes,’ Castiel said uncertainly. He had fully been expecting Balthazar to say something. He looked up at Dean. ‘I guess I’ll see you later.’
‘I’m going to go now. It was nice while it lasted, Dean. But…you don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve the trouble I’d bring,’ he said quietly. He made his way to the door and had the wind knocked out of him when he was shoved against the wall and forcibly spun around. ‘W-wha—?!’
Sam frowned over his shoulder at the partially open kitchen door. ‘Thanks,’ he dryly replied. He turned back to Gabriel. ‘I thought you were doing interviews?’
Castiel looked around. No one else was in sight. They were lucky in that they were in one of the bungalows on the end of the long pier—away from the prying eyes of other guests. ‘I guess I can,’ he said as he set everything onto a table and began to undress.
‘Jody, Sam. Sam, Jody,’ Gabriel said, waving his hand between the two. ‘Sam is Dean’s younger brother.’ He licked his lips, wondering if any further explanation was needed. ‘He, uh…works at the hotel I’m staying at.’
‘It was amateur night! I was drunk!’ Castiel shouted defensively. ‘Besides, you’re so-called producers did it, too!’
Castiel didn’t know how he should feel as he watched Balthazar walk away. The sound of someone landing on the pier drew his attention, and he looked back toward the boat. He tilted his head as he watched Dean stretch his arms out for balance.
‘We broke the TV while he was fucking me against the wall, and the hotel is demanding reparation,’ Castiel said evenly. He raised a brow as Gabriel shrank back.
? Sam slid to the floor in silence and watched Gabriel cry. What should he do? Castiel was an obvious threat. He ran a hand over his face.
Castiel smiled weakly at Dean, wondering if the Hunter would be able to carry him out. Just as he placed his hand in Dean’s, a loud shot rang out.
want to do your, uh…dryad bit, then I could help you out. I’m not the best at contouring others, but I could give it a try,’ Castiel said as he tucked his phone away. He blinked at the sudden grin Gabriel shot him.
. And how was Castiel supposed to perform his drunken tirades when he was sleeping with proof of a mythological creature’s existence? As he thought about it, mermaids still didn’t make sense. If he were drunk, he would probably just angrily go off on how impossible they were. Charlie could easily edit the footage to remove anything that might slip.
Both Jody and Crowley nodded in understanding. ‘That makes more sense,’ Crowley said. ‘Wait. I think I remember something… I thought we couldn’t find a camera.’
Sam shook his head in amusement as he leaned against the door. Eventually, Dean would understand some of nuances of human taste. ‘So what did you wanna talk about?’
this?!’ Castiel screamed after Lucifer commented on his small battle with a vampire. He hugged himself as he backed away from Lucifer.
‘Well, yes,’ Crowley replied as he nodded. ‘See, it would do me no good to kill off a small family of Hunters. That grabs attention. I don’t need that sort of attention. I need allies, not vengeful Hunters breathing down my neck.’
The morning went relatively well for Castiel. He was reading a book in the panic room as he waited for Dean to finish working on the binding cuff. He sighed heavily when Anna came to retrieve him for training. He followed her outside, absently rubbing on his left wrist. He flinched when Anna placed a hand over his.
‘Then get it under control,’ Crowley replied without missing a beat. He snapped his fingers at the young woman still leaning against the front door. ‘Meg, be dear and bring in the case.’
‘Why is everyone standing out here?’ Karen asked as she came into the entryway, followed by Bobby and Balthazar.
Anna could feel the presence of a familiar angel. She looked away from Crowley’s demonstration of how to dismantle the wards and frowned. If she could feel
Gabriel blinked at the picture of himself standing next to a plaster dinosaur. ‘Oh. Oh! Right! Sorry!’ He laughed as he signed his autograph with a flourish. ‘Wow! That is…that’s an old one,’ he said fondly.
Castiel stared at the paper placemat in front on him. Dean didn't have to do that. Castiel was accustomed to receiving stares. As long as no one made a big deal about it, he was just fine pretending that he wasn't bothered. It was usually other angels that fretted over his wings, anyway. 'Thank you,' he said.
Anything the human commanded, the angel would feel compelled to comply. It did not take long for the angels to catch on to what was happening and flee. Some chose to stay, volunteering to be bound to a member of their family, wanting to protect them.
He had a new career. There was no way around it. His reputation was ruined, so he probably wouldn’t be writing any papers for a long time, but that was always tedious anyway. The part of his job that he loved the most was actually being given to him. Travel and swimming. Well, he might not be in the water for the episodes that centered around myths based on land, but there would be plenty of free time to see the local sights.
Dean grabbed a beer from the fridge and settled down to read a book. About halfway through his beer, the doorbell rang. He looked up, not sure if had heard correctly. No one ever visited. It rang again. He stood and slowly made his way to the door. Once he reached it, the bell rang a third time. He opened the door and cautiously peeked around it.
Dean couldn't make his voice work. His eyes darted between the two hunters, then he looked down at the box next to his feet. He busied himself with sorting the amulets.
Sam and Dean rushed to Gabriel, but were thrown in the opposite direction. When they stood up, they saw a female spirit standing between them and Gabriel. Sam brought his gun up and shot her square in the chest. With a scream, she vanished, only to reappear behind them. This time, Dean shot her.
Sam crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. Whatever Gabriel had chosen had to be better than the atrocity he had witnessed earlier.
Castiel looked over and smiled as he let his eyes wander down. ‘Yeah… Oh, did you speak with Benny?’
Castiel shifted his stare to Dean. ‘Really. Good looking guy like you?’ he said incredulously. ‘I find that hard to believe.’
Without Seraphiel blocking him, Castiel could judge the other angel’s true size, and he was…small. Smaller than any other angel he had met. Small, swift, and deadly. He finally understood how one angel could have caused so much damage.
Karen shrugged and moved to the sink to clean her hands. ‘If it ain’t broke… But…yeah, I can see what you mean. It…’ She glanced over at Dean and bit her lip. ‘It’d be nice to have the connection, but not the compulsion,’ she quietly admitted. ‘Bobby’s real careful, and he takes it back when he does slip up, but…I wish he didn’t have to.’
It was around three in the morning when Bobby and Karen got home. Bobby was completely sore and couldn't wait to take a long, relaxing shower, followed up by an ice-cold beer.
‘We weren’t…’ Castiel’s mind caught up with what Balthazar had just said. He was in the clear. No one knew. Dean’s secret was still safe. ‘I’m sorry. I completely forgot.’
Gabriel whined as Sam gave him a gentle push down the hallway. ‘This is gonna sound pathetic, but… I really like you. You’re hot, smart,
Azazel sighed as he shook his head. ‘He received an email requesting his photo for the credits,’ he explained. ‘I already told him “no”, but he insisted on speaking with either you or Michael.’
‘Oh! I would treat him like an Archangel,’ Gabriel said. ‘He might not look it, but he has the power of one. …Sometimes.’
He pulled his skirt around his hips and sighed in relief as he attached the hooks and buttoned it up. He ran his thumbs around the waistband, smiling to himself. He remembered it being a little looser the last time he wore it, but it didn’t dig into him like he feared it would. He put in his earrings and looked over when Dean gave a quiet hiss.
‘That poor boy is under so much stress right now,’ Karen replied as she took Anna by the elbow and lead her to the table. ‘I think we can permit him to miss a meal or two.’ She pulled out a chair and crossed her arms, staring expectantly at Anna.
Castiel hoisted up the camera he held, and Balthazar took it. He climbed onto the ladder hanging off the edge of the rental boat and out of the water. He didn’t think as he pulled his goggles off and shook the excess water from his hair until he heard Balthazar grunt in approval. He pushed his bangs back and looked over at the camera filming his every move. Irritation raced up his spine, and he could just imagine the
‘If you’re gonna get me in the water without a tank, I’m gonna be wearing floaties or a life jacket or
‘Just show him a porno,’ Benny said as he moved about the boat. He opened a storage compartment and pulled out the bag where he kept an extra set of clothes for Dean. ‘You’re in jeans today,’ he said, tossing the bag to Dean. ‘If you’re gonna keep this up, you need to bring some clothes back. I can’t drop you off naked.’
keep photos of everyone we get involved with. Clients, targets…associates… Helps keep track of everyone and everything,’ Sam explained. ‘Don’t wanna accidentally think that someone’s an enemy. I’ve got a picture of you in my file as a known contact.’
Dean put the hood down and faced Castiel. ‘Here, gimme the keys, and I’ll see what’s up.’ He held out his hand and waited.
! That’s Cassie!’ Charlie exclaimed over Castiel. ‘Show the picture before that one. The one on the bull!’
'Hey there, sweetie,' Karen said softly as she sat on the edge of the couch. 'I'm Karen. What's your name?'
Dean laughed as he set the bag aside and rubbed his hands over Castiel’s shoulders. ‘I don’t think so. Here. You tell me why your love spell isn’t working, and I’ll try to explain what it is,’ he said.
Frustrated, Castiel swam back to the boat and pulled himself up. He set the camera aside and pulled off his goggles. He grunted in annoyance as he wrestled off his tank and stab jacket. He needed to get his spare tank ready. He pulled off his flippers and hurried to where he stashed his tank.
‘Some sorta scales,’ Castiel replied. He pulled them free from Balthazar’s fingers and stared at them. ‘Dean gave ‘em to me. They’re from a f…’ He trailed off as he turned them over. He hadn’t really taken the time to examine them properly, either too busy or distracted. They weren’t like normal fish scales. They held a slight iridescence on one side, but the other was dull and more of a pale earth tone. He squinted at the scales as his mind supplied a similarly shaped scale. ‘Pangolin,’ he muttered aloud.
Gabriel shook his head. ‘I took a picture and showed him. He says he’ll be fine with a butterfly bandage,’ he explained. ‘I would ask Samandriel for our own stash, but I really don’t want anyone knowing that we broke something until morning. Or a week from now. Or ever.’
Dean frowned uncertainly as he trailed off on his threat. He could just make out the sound of an engine in the distance, and it was growing louder. He growled as he pulled his fins close and submerged his tail, glaring up at Crowley.
Dean softly stroked Castiel’s hair as the angel collapsed against him, gasping for air. When Castiel had recovered, Dean spoke. ‘So. Grooming, huh?’
Leaning back against Dean’s chest, Castiel rubbed his arm in embarrassment. ‘Relationships don’t really work out very well for me,’ he admitted. ‘My er…  In college, you could say that I had a revolving door.’
Anna frowned as she tried to fight her way through the drunken haze clouding her thoughts. She decided it was an insult. ‘Hey… At least I didn’t let the kinkiest lay of my life slip outta my fingers ‘cuz I was too stupid to talk to him!’
lay a hand on you or Dean. Not after what you guys just did,’ Gabriel said softly. He pulled Sam on top of him and hooked his arms around Sam’s neck. ‘You freed us. We don’t have to hide anymore. We can live real lives now! Although… Dad might get a little pissed because he’ll end up losing some employees…’
‘It is quite all right,’ he said, taking Ms. Skrims’ hand and placing a delicate kiss on her gloved hand. ‘I must thank you for keeping him entertained. My sister has not been well, and I lose track of time quite easily.’
Gabriel bit his lip and looked up at Sam. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see that Dean was also looking at him in interest. ‘The Campbell family was hunted down,’ he replied with difficulty. He didn’t want Sam to know. Sam was happier not knowing his family history. ‘Everyone thinks it was ‘cuz they were good at their job, but it…it…’
Dean paused, breathing heavily against Castiel’s neck. ‘R-right.’ He really needed to speak with his brother before he ended up embarrassing himself even more than he already had. Especially since he had no idea what Castiel was talking about. ‘Sorry, I uh…got a little carried away.’
Dean nodded then stood. Castiel pulled a frown as Dean left the room. His attention immediately went straight to his left wrist. He squeezed his hand around it, rubbed it, and scratched at it. He just couldn’t
‘Huh? Wait, what are… Where are we going?’ Gabriel whined. Sam’s smile did little to put him at ease. He was quickly led inside and turned in time to see the few scattered raindrops turn into a heavy drizzle. ‘What’s wrong, Sammy? Don’t like being caught in the rain?’
‘Oh, it started in Canada,’ Castiel replied. ‘Then it moved to off-Broadway. I got to see it!’ he proudly declared. ‘I was in the splatter zone. Wore a white T-shirt, and got soaked in fake blood.’
Gabriel raised his chin as he assessed Castiel. ‘Really?’ he said, letting the doubt in his voice show. ‘Coulda fooled me earlier.’
‘Shh… These aren’t exactly the thickest walls,’ Sam warned. He moaned loudly when a hand cupped him through his shorts.
Dean cocked his head to the side as he regarded Sam. ‘You’re so helpless, Sammy. All of you are, really.’
‘Job’s yours,’ Crowley said as he checked his phone. He grimaced at one of the messages he had received. ‘Lucifer’s found his way into my private library.’
‘The link demands more than just obedience in order to work,’ Karen patiently explained. ‘You have to
‘They’re yellow, thank you very much,’ Gabriel said grumpily. He didn’t move away as Sam leaned closer and kissed him. He closed his eyes and returned the kiss. Even with a tail, Sam still kissed the same.
Castiel thrust faster as Dean’s warm seed spilled over his hand and muscles tightened around his cock. He kissed Dean as his own thrusts became more desperate. One final push, and he was over the edge, moaning as he rode out his high. He rested his head on Dean’s chest, panting and gasping for breath.
Dean frowned. He wasn't slacking off. He couldn't help it if he could go through a book a lot more quickly than a human. He picked up a new book, a particularly heavy, leather-bound tome, and flipped through the pages more slowly. At least this one had a lot of pictures in it.
‘It stuck didn’t it?’ Sam said empathetically. He had had more than his fair share of unfortunate code names over the years.
‘Great,’ Gabriel said in a forced tone. He still had scratches running the length of his arms from when he had to force the cat into the carrier at Castiel’s apartment. He had even taken precautions and wore a heavy coat and gloves for protection. ‘He’s not gonna murder me in my sleep, is he?’
Gabriel laughed and took a sip of his drink. He set the glass back on the thick, wooden table and shook his head. ‘Well, he sent the other guy to the hospital. Not as heroic as it sounds,’ he said. ‘He kicked the guy in the knee and dislocated his kneecap.’
‘No, it’s not. It’s really not,’ Castiel said, shaking his head. ‘I don’t want you to feel like I’m ignoring you, and…there will be times when it’ll seem like that. But, I guess, that’s not a problem anymore. I don’t see myself being asked to go on any expeditions any time soon.’
‘It will let me see your bones without having to cut you open,’ Castiel explained distractedly as he made his way down Dean’s calf.  He looked up as he held Dean’s foot in his lap, and his eyes settled on the merman’s penis. He tilted his head and pursed his lips. ‘Is it traditional for mermaids, er, folk to get cut?’
‘This is getting stupid,’ Dean muttered as they finally reached the fifth floor. They were so close, but still so far away. At the rate they were going, it would be at least another hour until they reached Castiel. He looked around, and as Sam and Gabriel were distracted with a demon, he snuck off down one of the side passages.
Gabriel paled as he quickly got up. He winced at the crunching sounds as Castiel pushed himself up. ‘Shit, shit, shit… Please tell me it’s something we can fix…’
‘I went to the Caribbean without even telling you. I called you on the third day from a boat,’ Castiel replied. ‘I think you were justified.’
Castiel glanced back up and gave a shrug. ‘I just do what I’m told. I carry out my assignments to the best of my abilities.’
Karen blinked and looked over her shoulder. ‘It’s just a…decoration. I like tiki bars,’ she explained and looked back at Dean. With all the mermaids in the current vicinity, she wondered if she should change the name of the hotel.
Castiel looked to the clock. There was about half an hour left until dinner would be served. Should he wait? He shook his head as he headed to the door. He should just get it over with.
‘Yeah, uh…’ Gabriel wracked his mind. What had Castiel said about the photo? ‘So it’s supposed to be some sort of mysterious sea monster, right? Well, those uh…scales? Yeah, there’s scales and the tailfin is uh…like a uh…a mammal. So uh…someone obviously didn’t do their research.’ He laughed as he plucked the photograph from Sam’s hand and looked for somewhere to stash it.
Dean pulled lightly at Jimmy and was thrilled when Jimmy let him pull him closer and down toward the bed. ‘Wha’s yer name?’
‘He doesn’t,’ Balthazar agreed. ‘It’s only when he’s drunk off his ass that he throws himself at anything with two legs.’
‘But you stuck around,’ Charlie said with a smile. ‘I met Gilda when she was chained to buoy.’ She quickly backpedaled at Sam’s alarmed expression. ‘No, wait! She was doing it on purpose! I mean…it was a protest? She was protesting overfishing. A storm blew in, and she almost drowned, but I saved her. Oh, you shoulda seen her, Sam… She was so gorgeous on that beach. Her hair spread around her...her lips… I kissed her and she woke up.’
Sam rolled his eyes before hefting Gabriel off of the window sill and into his arms. ‘Dean might know something that would work,’ he suggested. ‘If he was able to make the cuff work for Cas, then…maybe he came across something that would lessen he effects on a normal angel.’
Sam felt happy for his brother. It had been a while since he'd seen Dean so excited. The last time being when they first met Karen and found out she made amazing pies.
Dean tugged at his wrists, but found them still held firmly. He felt soft tremors coming from Castiel. He looked up to find Castiel leaning over him, shaking and breathing raggedly. He flinched as a drop of blood landed on his cheek.
Gabriel clapped his hand to his mouth as he ran into his brother’s room. There was so much blood. They were too late. He clenched his eyes shut and blindly threw himself into Sam’s chest, clutching tightly as tears surfaced. No matter how tightly he closed his eyes, the blood and Dean’s limp body were still there. He shuddered as Sam hugged him tightly, shaking and face buried in his hair. ‘Can we go outside?’ Gabriel asked quietly. He felt Sam nod, and was relieved as Sam led him out of the room.
‘You shouldn’t exist! You…you change form! You grow legs when you’re dry, and scales when you’re wet! How is that physically possible?! It’s like...like magic! Magic does
Bobby shook his head. ‘She knew what she was doin’. We happened to get assigned to the same man. Me for surveillance, her for assassination. I got caught, and she pulled me out. Died in the process. One day later, the entire compound was demolished. No survivors. The target was gutted with his entrails stretched out like wings.’
Castiel was numb with shock and horror as Dean fell forward onto the bed. Movement caught his eye, and he focused on Lucifer, standing on the other side of the room. In Lucifer’s hand was the Colt.
Sam leaned over and pulled Gabriel free of the last piece of clothing. He laughed quietly and gave Gabriel’s knee a kiss. ‘This wouldn’t have been a problem if you had been a little more patient,’ he said as he settled next to the shorter man.
‘What time is it?’ Sam asked. He looked at his clock to see that it was only eight in the morning. He breathed a sigh of relief, glad that he hadn’t slept in too late.
‘I know,’ Lucifer said with a sigh. ‘They probably think they’re making the right decision. Choosing the…lesser of two evils. In their eyes, at least.’ He stroked Castiel’s cheek and gave him a sad look. ‘Unfortunately, my brother won’t see you as the gift you are.’
Benny sighed as he tossed a small rock overboard and moved to the aft end of his boat. He sat back against the railing, crossing his arms. ‘Think of it as Dean’s version of a dozen roses.’
Castiel shut his book and stared at his lap. ‘I considered you a friend back home… I…didn’t have many options for friends.’ He looked up at Balthazar. ‘But now… If you truly are my friend, you would leave.’
Gabriel’s face fell into one of shock. He stared at his brother, not sure what to say. ‘You…you weren’t…what?’
‘Yeah, I know,’ Gabriel said bitterly. ‘Samandriel’s allergic, you’re…doin’ a good job getting on with him, so that just leaves me.’ He sighed as he trudged toward the door. ‘Did he ever apologize?’
‘And fuckin’ cool! You should do that more often! I think you broke her arm!’ Gabriel said, grinning manically.
instead of my fins,’ Dean said as he dropped heavily onto a chair and propped his elbows onto the kitchen table. ‘He’s not scared off by my scars. He actually
‘How about this: If he gets caught, then our so-called rescue mission is a bust!’ Sam snapped. ‘It’ll be harder to sneak around, and if Cas really
Everything had come crashing down around him, and he actually had a direction to go in. That was what disturbed him the most. His panicked questions of what he should do were already answered. All decisions were already made. If his life had just been uprooted, leaving him flailing and lost, he would have had something to focus on. He could deal with the prospect of being jobless and homeless. He would have had the task of getting everything in order. Now, everything was laid out for him. His life was falling apart, and it was neatly wrapped up and waiting for him to pick it up.
Castiel hugged himself and looked around the restroom uncertainly. He was different. This 'tradition' probably didn't apply to him like it did his brother. He was surprised the cuff even had any effect on him at all. 'I don't really
Dean shrugged. ‘I just wanted to know if he meant coffee as in the drink or coffee as in sex,’ he explained. ‘Never had coffee, and he didn’t believe me, so… I thought he meant sex?’
‘I don’t know, but it’s definitely distracting. How do you… Y’know what? I don’t wanna know how. Not yet.’
Sam sighed and nodded. ‘I still think this is a bad idea.’ He shook his head with a sigh and looked around his room. ‘I guess I can find a mattress or a cot or something for you… Uh… How much did Benny explain to you about…well, everything?’ he asked. If his brother was intent on ‘chasing a mate,’ then Sam needed to make sure that Dean wouldn’t end up blowing his cover. And certainly not around the marine biologist.
Castiel blushed lightly as he took another step back. ‘I…suppose I can do that,’ he eventually replied.
‘Oh! No, um, the hole’s already there,’ Castiel replied as he knelt by the side of pool. He turned his head, giving Dean a good look at his earlobe. He pulled the earring out and replaced it. ‘See? I had them pierced a long time ago, and now they’re just…holes. It doesn’t hurt at all. Well, it’ll hurt if I wear the wrong type of metal, but that’s if I don’t take them out after a few hours,’ he explained.
A loud bang echoed throughout the hotel, and bits of the ceiling floated down. Sam and Gabriel stared at the door Dean had just walked through. Sam ran up and tried opening it as Gabriel stared with wide eyes.
He hoped he was making the right decision. If everything went well, then he and Gabriel could help ease Castiel into the knowledge that Dean was a merman. He highly doubted that a marine biologist would be as accepting as a cryptozoologist TV host.
convincing them to leave,’ Anna calmly replied. She tried placing her calming energies on Dean again, but the young Hunter was still livid. She tilted her head slightly. ‘You really do like him.’
Charlie and Samandriel glanced at Gabriel before having their attention drawn back to the screen by a loud moan. They whined pathetically when Gabriel slammed the laptop shut and the monitor’s screen went black.
Dean held the door open for Pamela. On the way to Bobby's, he explained how they had found Anna, about her knowing the blood magic, about how wrong and empty she felt. As they reached the door to the basement, Pamela placed a hand on Dean's shoulder. When he looked at her questioningly, she put a finger to her lips and gave him a smirk. He let out a short laugh and shook his head.
Anna certainly wasn’t the best fighter that worked for his father, and Castiel knew it. Balthazar was so much quicker than she was. Castiel could only imagine just how good of a fighter Lucifer was. If he didn’t stand a chance against Anna, then what would happen when he ended up facing Lucifer? Even if Lucifer had no sway over him, Castiel would lose. He would lose, and Dean would die. And it would be all his fault. He didn’t know how to fight. He didn’t know how to fend off even the simplest attacks.
‘Castiel. So nice to hear from you,’ Crowley said, his accented voice not quite clear. ‘Darling, did you forget something? Mmm, thank you. Now, Castiel. To what do I owe the pleasure?’
'Campground,' Sam replied distractedly, brushing Gabriel's hand away. He tried to ignore how Gabriel's fingers managed to become tangled with his.
Sam was about to ask who Gabriel was going to mention when he felt a small hand on his shoulder. He looked down at Karen's pleading face. She shook her head, and Sam sighed.
Dean sighed and stared at the ceiling before looking back at Castiel. ‘I don’t care,’ he said carefully. ‘You’re worth more than that to me.’
‘Yeah. Helps you make a good fist… Give a harder punch. And, depending on who you talk to, might be a little on this side of cheating,’ Dean replied.
She urged Castiel forward and nudged Sam to get his attention. ‘Don’t be too hard on Dean. I’ve only seen it once, but Cas comes on
‘Benny saved my life. I was stealin’ fish from their net when it pulled up, and I got caught. That guy was aimin’ to kill me right there on that deck. Benny shot him,’ Dean said quietly, running his fingers along the edges of the tears. ‘Took him a little while to untangle me, but the moment he did, he pushed me back in the water.’
He stood quickly and clasped his hand over his mouth as a wave of nausea crashed over him. He slowly sank back to the floor with a soft groan. He would have to wait until morning. His head fell back against the wall, and he banged it a couple times in frustration. He had a full schedule tomorrow. Samandriel had packed their days full in an attempt to beat the weather.
Dean quickly glanced to Jo and back at the man, but he was gone. He cast his gaze around, but found no trace of the man. Had he imagined it?
Castiel bit his lip as he cast his eyes about the room. ‘I have to go.’ He reached the door and turned back when Balthazar cleared his throat. He stared curiously at the man smiling at him.
Dean stopped just behind Castiel and stared at the small entourage in the entryway. Anna stared back, wide-eyed and pressed against the wall, trying to be as far away without actually leaving. A shorter, well-dressed, middle-aged man stood in the center of the entry with his arms crossed and glaring at Castiel. The only one that actually seemed comfortable with the situation was a young, dark-haired woman, leaning against the front door.
Dean stared up at Castiel. He wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling from the angel. Embarrassment, uncertainty, lust…a large helping of lust. What did Meg say to Castiel?
‘What’s it like jerking off?’ Gabriel asked before he could stop himself. Why did his mind have to jump right into the gutter at serious moments? ‘Sorry.’
‘Wait, so is that bad? Being a, uh, Scotsman?’ Dean asked. ‘Is it…contagious?’ he added as an afterthought. He sighed as the rest of the table erupted in laughter and rolled his eyes. ‘So that answers
‘Makes him happy,’ Lucifer replied before lowering his voice to a whisper. ‘And it’s distracting him from wanting to join the dating pool.’
Castiel looked back at the fish. It was an impressive catch at about five-and-a-half feet. Dean had caught him a fish. That was…thoughtful. Certainly more interesting and useful than flowers. He frowned and looked at Benny. ‘Where is he?’
‘Surveillance, huh?’ Sam had been trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to get Gabriel to confess to having his personal collection of Sam-centric photos. ‘Take any good pictures lately?’
Gabriel’s mouth dropped open. He didn’t have time to fully process what Dean had said because the taller man was being pushed out of the way by Sam.
Crowley stared in shock at the aggressive display of fins surrounding a very angry and lowly clicking merman. Of all the things he had been expecting to walk in on, this had been the last. A loud sob from Castiel broke him from his shock.
Castiel huffed as he crossed his arms, refusing to look at his brother. ‘I just really need to speak with Dean.’
‘Gabriel, no,’ Castiel said, turning away. ‘I’m not interested in your aliens or mutants or whatever you think it is.’
‘Uh…we found the shark,’ Sam said with a shrug. ‘And it didn’t go well. Dad died saving Dean, and Dean…he got bit. His fins are…pretty messed up.’
'I-I had no idea. … I understand. … I'll do that. … Yeah, you, too. … Bye.' Gabriel closed the phone and stared at Castiel. 'Dad's sending bodyguards,' he finally said.
far away. He glanced over his shoulder at Balthazar, whose back was still facing him. ‘We never hurt anyone,’ he said quietly as he silently edged to the railing and placed a leg over it. He balanced and griped the railing tightly as he brought his other leg over, keeping an eye on Balthazar. It would take Balthazar a while to find the keys, and there was no way he’d attempt to swim after Castiel. When Balthazar began speaking, he didn’t listen as he lowered himself down to drop soundlessly into the water.
Gabriel sighed and leaned against the door. ‘It’s going. Where…I don’t know. But uh… Do me a favor and keep Cas entertained. At least until I figure myself out. Go…play in a lake or something. That should be good enough.’
Dean vanished under the water, and Sam watched as the dark shadow of his brother faded into the distance. For Sam, it was too much too fast. Dean, Charlie, and the film crew. He could have probably handled two of the three. With a heavy sigh, he headed back to the hotel, intent on making his map.
‘What?! No! I just… Gabriel, I promise, when I have this all figured out, I will tell you exactly what is going on, but right now? Right now, I need to speak with Dean,’ Castiel explained. ‘This does not concern you at this point in time.’
Gabriel gave a nervous grin. 'Who pretends to be a Trickster and has two thumbs?' He brought up his hand and pointed his thumbs at himself. 'This guy!'
Bobby looked away briefly. He had killed his fair share of demons over the years, and none of them had presented themselves as calmly as the shorter man that stood before him. He had to keep reminding himself that the man was a demon. ‘I take it “natural selection” applies to the crazies, too?’ he said.
Charlie huffed and tightened her grip on her bag as she pushed past everyone in the hall and stomped up the stairs. She poked her head back around the corner and smiled at Sam. ‘We’ll catch up later, okay?’
Castiel bit his lip as he waited for Dean. ‘I need somewhere to hide,’ he said. ‘And not the panic room.’
‘They can have their little…wedding or whatever in the middle of the ocean,’ Crowley argued. ‘They had their chance to do it here.’
‘Oh!’ One thought, and he was naked from the waist up. He looked over his shoulder and gave a cheeky grin when Dean gasped. ‘Is that better?’
The door finally opened, revealing Castiel. His t-shirt and boxers were wrinkled and his hair stuck out in all directions. He squinted at Dean in confusion. ‘Dean? What are you doing here?’
Castiel felt a numbness overtake him as he looked around the yard. Sure enough, a few of the junkers were sporting fresh damage, and the kitchen windows were busted. ‘I didn’t mean to…I just got so…angry. Did I hurt you?’
Castiel paused at the door and glanced between Sam and Gabriel. ‘I’m used to reading upside down. I’ll borrow the boat again on Thursday.’
‘Now… Well, it still annoys me that he wastes his power on such…frivolity. As much as it hurts, I am glad that he has a father that cares. I must admit, after Lailah’s death, I didn’t know what to think. I went to her aid, but I was too late. And a…
It had been a while since he’d been in the ocean. He hadn’t realized just how much he had missed it. Even if Gabriel was right, and he did belong back in the water, he wouldn’t admit it to his older brother.
Karen frowned in confusion then looked to Castiel and Gabriel. ‘Is everything alright?’ she asked upon seeing Castiel looking more miserable than ever.
‘I know,’ Castiel ground out bitterly. He watched his brother in suspicion. ‘You already told me this.’
Sam watched Gabriel’s body language then looked away. ‘Never mind,’ he said. He headed over to his bag and pulled out a book.
Dean pushed away from the pier. ‘Nah, I’m good. I found a nice little cave that way,’ he said as he pointed north. ‘Got some great views of humans. They’re so…weird looking.’ He eyes drifted to Sam’s legs. ‘Those, uh…toes are freaky.’
articles! And they’re all stupid, ludicrous bullshit! And they’re all right! And Michael and Lucifer are in on the conspiracy!’
Dean finally found Castiel hiding out in one of the far corners of the junkyard. He was sitting in the passenger seat of an old junker that rested on top of several other cars. Dean carefully climbed up the pile of rusted metal and pulled open the door.
Castiel stepped forward and inhaled sharply when Dean gently took his hand. He glanced down and raised his eyes in confusion. ‘I don’t understand.’
Dean breathed heavily as Castiel worked to undo his belt and jeans.  He tilted his hips up and moaned at the sensation of his jeans and boxers being pulled around his knees. Nothing happened next, and he looked to find Castiel staring at the large scar on his leg. He sagged as Castiel’s head tilted while staring. He was back in familiar territory. The smaller scar near the end of his tail was bad enough, but it was the one that now held Castiel’s attention that warded off potential mates. They would stare for a while then find a way to avoid touching it, as if it were contagious.
‘Not really,’ Gabriel admitted. ‘That whole techy side makes no sense to me. You get more than one wire coming out of a thing, and I get confused.’
Castiel yawned and stretched as he stood. ‘I ran up and got everything I’d need. The rest is in the trunk,’ he replied as he pulled his shirt off.
It was just after noon when the film crew returned for lunch. Balthazar watched as Castiel broke off and headed for Sam’s room. He turned to Gabriel and shook his head. ‘Your brother is driving me insane. He’s too distracted to be useful on camera and even worse behind the camera,’ he said.
behaving more calmly. But he was still himself. He still smiled the same. Still acted like he was one step ahead. He calmed down for Sam. ‘He’s in love.’
‘I would never harm you!’ he quickly added, hoping to put Dean’s fear to rest. ‘The Hunter in the woods was the only accident—light bulbs and windows a-and stuff…they don’t count!’
Dean held his breath and stared at the back of Castiel’s head, uncertain of what to say. As far as he was concerned, he thought of Castiel as his mate—with or without the ritual. But…it was still something that he had been looking forward to. ‘It’s not a big deal,’ he said.
Sam pulled Dean to the floor just as the ghost flew overhead. 'Have you figured it out yet?' Sam asked.
‘This whole thing coulda been cleared up long ago, and you two would be a happily married couple. That’s sweet,’ Gabriel said. ‘But I think that ship’s sailed.’
Castiel didn’t look up from the book his was reading. He sighed and turned to the next page. ‘Reading.’
Lucifer’s eyes narrowed as he noticed that Dean was alive, despite the large blood stains on his torso. He tried to struggle, but the angels holding him were strong. ‘How…?!’ He glared up at Michael. ‘Let me go, brother.’
‘Whatcha doin’?’ Gabriel asked. He leaned against the desk and looked down at various highlighted calendars and print-ups. He thought he recognized the name of a travel agency, but he wasn’t sure.
‘What? The bright colors? That’s straight up nature,’ Charlie replied. ‘Better for attracting a mate, and it helps with keeping track of the rest of the colony.’
‘Hey. Just ‘cuz I’m outta shape doesn’t mean I’m old. My knees only act up in the cold,’ Gabriel said defensively.
‘Three…’ Dean could have sworn his heart stopped. ‘Three years?’ he repeated, his voice wavering. ‘Did you follow me…everywhere.’ At Castiel’s nod, he felt his cheeks heat up. ‘I-including the Roadhouse?’
He heard Gabriel's loud laughter coming from the kitchen. He slowly poked his head around the corner. Everyone but Karen sat around the table, and there were two empty seats. He chewed on his lip as he watched the others interact. Dean was acting as if nothing had happened, and he appeared to be wearing clothes that were a touch too big for him. And Gabriel was sitting awfully close to Sam.
Dean left for his bedroom, not saying a word. Castiel set the plate down and pulled his sleeve over his bare wrist. He followed Dean, but the door was shut in his face. He huffed and looked up and down the hallway. Keeping his wrist covered, he made his way to Sam’s room and hid.
‘Tonight…no cuff, no bond…just you and me.’ Dean laughed as Castiel threw himself forward and they fell to the floor. ‘So, I guess this means you’re a demon in the sack!’
that,’ she said with a sigh. ‘Anyway, it doesn’t matter. Take off that stupid coat. We’ll start with some basic defense.’
‘I’ve had my share of orgies,’ Dean replied. He had learned a lot of new words form his pornographic research. ‘Lots of limbs. Fun, but it can get a little confusing.’
‘That must be nice,’ Anna said. At Dean’s scoff, she went on. ‘I’ve never experienced it myself, but I’ve heard that it is one of the most satisfying connections an angel can make with another being.’
‘I know.’ Gabriel reached up and pulled Sam down, placing a soft kiss on his lips. ‘And as far as Hunters go, you’re not so bad.’
Even Gabriel had a set of wings tattooed onto the small of his back. Sam grimaced at the thought that Gabriel and Castiel were probably no more than property to the agency.
‘Not without a piña colada, at least!’ Charlie said from behind the pair. She grinned at Sam’s relieved expression.
'According to Dad? It's more than necessary, and he should probably be sending an army, but he'll settle for a few minions,' Gabriel replied.
'And, hey! We also have a VCR!' Dean declared as he slapped Castiel on the back. He let his hand linger, then gave up on self-restraint and ran his hand along the ridge of one wing.
Karen laid a hand on Dean’s shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile. ‘But you changed it,’ she said. ‘You made it work on an angel with demon blood! Imagine what you could do to lessen the original spell. Make it so we have a
As the week wore on, Dean was getting more and more irritated with Gabriel.  The Archangel would show up in the oddest places. Dean opened the fridge once in search of beer, but instead found Gabriel, drowning in one of Sam's coats. On several occasions, he was found sleeping in the bathtub on a pile of Sam's clothing.
‘All my Halloween costumes have been water related. Shark…shark attack victim…jellyfish… I uh… I went as Ariel during college. Won a contest,’ Castiel replied. He rolled the beer bottle between his hands as he waited for Dean’s reaction.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes, staring forlornly. ‘If anyone was born to be a Hunter, it would be you and Sam,’ he replied. He shook his head when Dean opened his mouth to argue. ‘You may be a Winchester, but you’re also a Campbell. Every last one of them was born to be a Hunter. Including you.’
Sam shook his head. ‘I don’t think he’d do that. He hates humans. He wouldn’t give us something even more powerful to bind angels with.’
Both Hunter and angel gasped at the sensation that fell over them. It was much stronger than the easy warmth they had felt before.
‘Why’d ya’ shoot ‘im, anyway?’ Dean asked. He managed to pull Castiel down again and began entertaining himself by running his fingers through Castiel’s hair.
‘…Yes, you did.’ Dean looked helplessly at Sam and Gabriel. He was forced to look back at Castiel when a pair of hands guided his chin forward.
Dean cautiously opened another door. Leading with his shotgun, he made his way around the room, rummaging through drawers as he went. If Sam's angel was going to prove useless, then they had better find some information on their ghost. As he exited the room, he was pushed from behind and flattened against the wall.
‘Why not? They looked really cool! Especially the sparkly ones!’ Dean said as he picked up a book and flipped through it, pausing when he came across pictures.
After three days, Dean was going insane. He couldn’t find anything. When he had finally managed to track down his original research, it turned out to be a dead end. He was growing frustrated, and snapped at everyone over everything.
'It was delicious!' Castiel declared through a mouth full of french fries. He quickly looked down and swallowed, blushing brightly. 'S-sorry,' he said quietly.
Gabriel sighed and looked from Castiel to the two Hunters. 'Cas has led a very...sheltered life,' he said. 'There's some things that need explaining. And I'm sure you two have a lot to yell about.'
‘Wait, we’ll need you tomorrow for filming, Cas,’ Samandriel said. ‘I know you wanna film on your own, but having a few shots of you swimming would be great.’
fault they recorded their little tryst in the middle of their documentary,’ Balthazar said defensively. ‘They’re lucky
‘It won’t be much longer,’ Lucifer said, twisting the cuff around Castiel’s wrist. ‘Soon, we’ll have found a way to free you from his hold.’
‘That never stopped you before,’ Castiel growled back, splashing water at Crowley. He was disappointed that he didn’t have anything to throw at the other man.
Sam looked over his shoulder at Dean, frowning. ‘Reward system?’ A cough from the bed caught his attention. Both Castiel and Gabriel were blushing brightly and trying to look anywhere but at the pair of Hunters. ‘O-oh…right. That…explains a lot, actually.’
‘Oh, I got that covered. Sam gave me a leather…cord,’ Dean said, waving his hand. ‘I just wanted a pull-thing and hole-thing.’
Dean shrugged. ‘Can’t anymore… I never got to thank you,’ Dean said, breaking off in a ragged cough.
Castiel ignored the odd phrasing. He had worked with plenty of other biologists that would get stuck in terminology and refer to their partners as mates. ‘Well, college I could understand. I was the guy that organized orgies. I left that stigma behind after I graduated. Um…I hope you don’t mind that I uh…well… I was pretty slutty.’
‘I’m fine,’ Castiel insisted, not letting on that he was enjoying Balthazar’s concern. ‘Wouldn’t be the first scratch I’ve gotten.’
‘I could tell,’ Sam replied and bent down to kiss the shorter man as he fumbled with the door knob. He shot up as he felt someone brush against his back.
Castiel, on the other hand, gave his father a small smile. ‘You’re willing to give up the Colt for us?’
Dean had smiled charmingly and offered his hand as he asked her to dance. Having to hold Ms. Skrims so close made Dean wished he never had to smell anything ever again. At least it made his job of planting the bug easier. He reached up and touched one of her earrings, saying how lovely they were and how well they framed her face. The small bug stuck to the earring and Dean smiled to himself.
‘It’s perfectly safe,’ Sam promised. ‘Besides, I’m a strong swimmer. I’ll make sure you don’t drown.’
‘Oh.’ Castiel pulled his phone from his pocket, wondering why Crowley hadn’t bothered to call him directly. He grunted in annoyance when he realized that his phone was dead. He looked back up at Balthazar expectantly.
‘She dies. She loses the prince to some other woman,’ Castiel explained. ‘She’s given a chance to save herself by killing him, but she doesn’t. Instead, she throws herself into the sea and becomes a spirit.’
Even as he reminded himself that Castiel and Balthazar were humans and playing by a different set of rules, he didn’t feel any better. How was he supposed to properly compete when he didn’t know the rules? He had TV shows and a few movies to go off of, but even in his short time of being human, he could tell that the rules of TV Land were something else altogether.
Castiel’s head flew up, and he forced a smile. ‘Yes. I’m fine,’ he said quickly. He looked to Jody pleadingly. ‘Right?’
Anna gave Castiel and Gabriel one last look before leaving the room. She paused at the doorway. ‘The entire block is clean. Let us know when you believe he’s ready to move, and we’ll clear the way.’ At Castiel’s nod, she left, closing the door behind her.
‘Well, whatever you decide, me ‘n’ Karen’ll stand by it,’ Bobby said. ‘Just don’t forget to give us your two weeks if you do decide to ride off into the sunset.'
He frowned as he picked up the photo and examined it. A quiet squeal escaped his throat when he recognized the green and violet tail.
Posters of diagrams and charts on marine mammals littered the walls of a small, cluttered office with a shuttered window. Several bookcases were overstuffed with books of various sizes, each on marine life and environments. In the midst of it all, sat Castiel Novak, marine biologist. He specialized in marine mammals, and was currently sorting a large collection of whale songs. In the middle of a particularly long note, the chipper sound of Castiel’s email alerted him to a new message. He paused what he was doing, expecting a note from Naomi.
Dean eventually looked up at Sam. ‘I don’t know,’ he said quietly. ‘It’s not like I really have anything to go back to.’
Gabriel snorted as he pushed off the frame and sauntered forward. ‘And my telling you wasn’t enough?’
! Cas, you need to get out of this closet,’ Gabriel said, bracing himself against the doorjamb. ‘I’ll get you back in the water. Where you belong. Looking at
it was to make sure no one found out?’ Castiel asked, raising his head. He let Balthazar pull him into a hug as he closed his eyes. ‘I’ve tried so hard to leave everything behind. To be the proper scientist I’m supposed to be. All this…’ He waved his hand at the camera equipment and scuba gear. ‘I would have been all for this during college. Going off on adventures…’
. If you asked me last week, then…yeah, but you’ve kinda grown on me, Sammy,’ he said with a lop-sided grin. ‘I’ve had flings, but nothing’s ever felt like this. I dunno if it’s the cuff, but I feel safe with you. Hell, maybe I actually love you.’
He looked up when Castiel placed a hand on his thigh. ‘Then I guess we’re both freaks,’ he said with a laugh.
‘Well, everyone reacts to stress differently,’ she replied. ‘He’s probably just running things through his head. Figuring everything out.’
Gabriel shrugged. ‘Usually, it’s stuff that makes him look bad or just normal. He lied to me about showing at a high end gallery and selling all his paintings. Said he was showing at some dive. But he’ll also lie about not being able to go places. Even if he has a legitimate excuse, he’ll give you some weird ass reason.’ Gabriel looked up at Dean. ‘Why do you even care?’
Alastair was so eager to get his hands on Seraphiel, the broken angel stuck in a human vessel. Alastair, whose real face was a broken mirror’s imitation of one of the angels who sided with Lucifer and died during the rebellion. He claimed to love his wayward brother as he sliced into Seraphiel.
Michael shook his head sadly and cupped the back of Lucifer’s neck. ‘I’m sorry, Lucifer, brother. But I cannot let this continue.’
get his, and, well, neither do you, but sometimes the sacrifice is worth it for the other guy to suffer. Right?’
Dean stared at Castiel in shock. There was a definite hint of excitement in the man’s voice. ‘Uh, well, uh… That one happened when I was…a lot younger, but uh… The more recent one…’ He looked away and moved the left leg of his shorts up to reveal part of the bite that dominated his left thigh. He cringed when Castiel gasped. He was about to cover it back up when Castiel stilled his hand.
‘I think we need to talk,’ Sam replied in a monotone. He set the toolbox on the front desk and grabbed his brother by the collar. He led Dean down the open hallway and into one of the rooms, shutting the door behind them.
He dropped his hand to his side, grunting in disappointment. He looked over at Castiel, who was pulling a large, fluffy, orange tabby from the cat carrier. He grimaced at the cat. ‘How’s Muffin doing?’
As soon as Ellen spoke, Dean felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He slouched back into the couch, letting Castiel wrap around him. The various phones in the kitchen began ringing as well.
Dean tried to steady himself. He probably should have practiced a little more before getting off the boat. Especially since he was aiming to impress Castiel. He took a careful step forward and lost his balance. ‘Dammit!’
Castiel shook his head and smiled at Dean. ‘I’m all right. I can manage this. You should continue your search.’
‘And then Daphne was eaten by Scooby!’ Castiel cried as he grabbed Dean’s sleeve. ‘It was awful! It’s a horrid series made of trash!’
Sam looked away, unable to come up with anything that could possibly comfort his brother. As much as he didn’t like Dean courting the marine biologist, he didn’t want to see him miserable, either.
Dean turned to the computer to find it off. He powered it on, and sighed in relief as it came to life. The screen blinked at him, alerting him that it experienced a fatal error. ‘Sammy!’
'Beautiful,' she said softly and reached up to cup Dean's cheek. 'Thank you, Seraphiel.' She leaned up and placed a kiss on his lips before leaving him alone and confused on the doorstep.
‘I’ll lose the tail,’ Dean said. ‘I’ll have legs like a human. So…I want clothes. Clothes that are good for attracting a mate.’
had Fallen. To remember everything. To feel his Grace slowly corrupt. To be reminded every time he caught sight of his wings out of the corner of his eye.
‘You don’t know that!’ Gabriel argued. ‘If they found out about Cas, then they can get in! It’s not safe
Dean recalled all the events leading up to his present situation. 'Not in my experience,' he said bitterly.
Sam winced as Gabriel fell down the short flight of steps. Before he could ask if Gabriel was okay, the door was slammed shut.
Dean caught Sam’s stare and looked away. ‘Sorry ‘bout earlier… I…can’t say it was all a lie. But I…I am sorry you had to find out about it that way.’
Crowley took a steadying breath as he glared up at Sam. The Hunter had a point, as much as he hated to admit it. ‘Very well,’ he bit out. ‘And what do you suggest we do?’
Dean rolled his eyes. He played along, wanting nothing more than for the conversation to stop. Uriel threatened, and Dean called his bluff. And then, Uriel threatened Sam. Dean’s obvious weakness. So Dean 'gave in' and told Uriel where they were hiding. When Uriel finally left and Dean awoke, he considered Pamela's words. Maybe it
Dean rolled his eyes at Sam’s lack of enthusiasm. It was a great museum. So many beautiful classic cars on display. But...when thinking of any other angel, then, yeah. He could see Sam’s doubt in an angel having any interest in it. 'His loss,' he said and went back to sifting through the box.
me!’ Castiel moved so that he was laying down on the couch with his head in Dean’s lap. He held Muffin on his chest as he glared at the ceiling, angry tears stinging his eyes. ‘Those…those
Castiel sighed and nodded. ‘All right… I won’t force him to speak to you, but… Go soak in your tub, and I’ll talk to Gabriel,’ he said.
‘Now, then. Visiting hours are almost up,’ Gabriel pointed out as he leaned down and picked up his clipboard, not taking his gun off of Sam. He backed his way to the door and pocketed his gun. ‘Go home, Sam. Get some rest. Dean’ll be just fine here.’
Dean stared at his hands for a minute before looking up at Benny. ‘He didn’t show up last night,’ he said. ‘He said he would and he…never showed up.’
Gabriel slouched and nodded before turning away. ‘We’ll be in my room if you get the time…’ He hurried around the corner, feeling his face heat up. How was
‘So…waterfalls, dangerous outcroppings of rocks in the middle of the ocean…’ Anna looked around for an idea. ‘Oh! A shipwreck! Are there any old shipwrecks nearby?’
Castiel tended to be a lucid dreamer, so he imagined his unseen partner was Dean. He knew his brother would give him an earful for such thoughts, but he liked Dean. Dean was brave, good, attractive, and had beautiful green eyes. He had seen into Dean's soul and knew the attraction was mutual. So, there was nothing wrong with him dreaming about the young Hunter, right?
As Balthazar took a seat, Castiel stood. ‘I’ve lost my appetite,’ he said quietly, pushing his plate to Dean and leaving the kitchen.
Sam picked up a bratwurst while keeping one elbow propped on the table. ‘Well, I’ve just been assigned to be Jo’s backup until Dean’s fully recovered,’ he replied. He took a bite and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Castiel nodded and continued to pull his shirt off. He heard a pair of chittering clicks and whistles, and couldn’t help but feel like he was being catcalled.
‘Um… They’re uh…kinda dicks? Well, Michael’s a fucking asshole, Lucifer’s manipulative as fuck, and Gabriel’s, well maybe he’s not really a dick. But he can be sometimes. I will admit it was funny when he got that freshman to think he was abducted by aliens.’
Charlie winced. ‘There’s an app that warns you within fifteen minutes,’ she said. ‘People think I’m crazy with all my rain gear… So, uh…how did he take it? What did he say?’
Gabriel giggled as he focused on Sam. ‘Would you look at those legs?’ he muttered. ‘No, no, don’t stand up! Yes! Turn around! Fuck, look at that chest… Do you think he swims? Can I get him to go swimming with me?’
‘Well…I don’t know how many of us there are,’ Charlie said, forcing herself to relax. ‘Leaving home…it’s not exactly something we do. Even moving to another community is frowned upon. Unless it’s for mating.’
it was about me,’ Gabriel said as he narrowed his eyes. ‘Whatever. I can’t…deal with you on top of all this right now. One thing at a time. Just…go stave off Cas’s meltdown while I enjoy my own,’ he said before opening the door and entering Sam’s room.
Lucifer frowned as he glanced around the room. So, he had apparently failed. His gaze caught on Castiel’s white wings. ‘They’re white.’
The moment Castiel felt Dean’s thoughts slip back to focus solely on Anna, his wings flapped out aggressively. ‘I asked you politely.’
Dean’s smile widened as he stared at Castiel. ‘For a moment, I thought you’d completely forgotten about me!’
Balthazar nodded happily as Castiel sputtered. He returned to the helm and continued on their original course as Castiel sank onto the deck.
When Dean got back, he found Anna staring up at the night sky. He figured he would see if she knew anything about just why he was dragged out of Hell, but she didn't know. As they spoke, she admitted to not wanting to go back. She wanted out, and Dean wanted back in. He wondered if it was because she had no Grace. She didn't have to feel the longing he felt. The need to be back in his Father's presence, to feel His love.
Gabriel bounced anxiously in his seat as he waited for the others to arrive for dinner. One by one, the rest of the small television crew showed up. Sam set six glasses of water around the table and gave Gabriel a concerned look.
'Huh? Oh...uh, yeah. Sure,' Dean replied, snapping out of his musings. He led Castiel up the stairs. The door to the computer room was shut, which was odd. He brushed it off as unimportant and pushed the door open. 'Hey, Ga—!' He halted at the sight before him.
‘Are we there yet?’ Dean whined. He kept stumbling and tripping over tree roots and small stones, and his legs were getting tired from the exertion.
The last time he had come down from his demon high, he sulked for over four centuries. He wondered what he would do this time around. He could already feel the sorrow and loneliness closing in on him, suffocating his will.
Dean smiled at Castiel as he splayed his fins. He clicked and whistled, promising Castiel that he was the best choice for a mate. He would protect Castiel from harm and provide for him. He flexed his fins up and forward in a dominating fashion as he pushed the biologist forward. He chirped out his mating proposal and snapped his teeth at Castiel.
shmoozed with their target. Getting a bug on the drug lord wouldn’t be a problem, it would be coming up with an excuse to get away from her. And what if she took to him? Ms. Skrims was known for liking the younger men. Dean shuddered at the thought.
‘So, uh… I didn’t want to say anything earlier, but… I’ve seen your sea monster,’ Sam said as he cut the engine and dropped the anchor.
Gabriel made a strangled noise in the back of his throat. He was supposed to be weighing his options properly, not listening to sex tips from his brother. He needed a new line of thought. ‘But he’s a fish!’
Castiel shrugged in response. ‘I am a little offended that you never told me that we made a sex tape.’
Dean gave Castiel an uncertain look. ‘Are you sure? I mean, I don’t think now’s the best time for that.’
‘Turn around, dammit!’ Dean shouted in frustration. His breath caught as the man did turn around, a soft smile on his face as he handed a small pastry to the young girl he had helped.
‘I’m not scared off. I…’ Sam broke off with a frustrated sigh. ‘I’m actually more than willing to run off with you,’ he admitted. ‘But there are a few things I need to figure out first.’
an Archangel, so…a smidgen more powerful than your average Low and High Angels.’ He felt Sam stiffen under his fingers. ‘Uh… Sam? You okay?’
‘Not allowed to check on my baby brother?’ the merman asked. His eyes ran over Sam’s body, and he pulled a disgusted face at Sam’s legs. ‘You look awful.’
‘I’ll be back later,’ he said quietly. ‘Don’t do anything stupid!’ He flinched as a few drops of water hit his back. He turned around and glared sharply at his brother, who was floating just next to the pier.
‘Like a human,’ Benny replied, earning the brightest smile he had seen since Dean had first been given the small television.
So why shouldn't he summon Castiel? Sure, he had no way of killing him at that moment, but he could certainly hurt him. A little. Not very much. He just really needed to take his aggression out on someone, and the low ranking angel that marked him would do nicely. And wasn’t that a kicker? An angel that actually flaunted the pride they felt about their work.
Castiel straddled Dean’s tail and licked his lips as he wondered where he should start. He startled as fins lightly brushed his sides and Dean’s hands ran up his thighs. He lightly grasped Dean’s hands, stilling them. ‘Just so we’re clear… I’m not having sex with you in this form. We may be able to negotiate handjobs or blow…er…
Castiel held Dean in place, staring into his eyes. He tried to read what was there, comparing the look to every human reaction he could remember. He settled on hope and fear. Castiel brought his wings possessively around Dean and pressed their lips together. It held none of the passion from their first kiss, but sweet reassurance. When Castiel pulled back, he gave Dean a small smile, still an unfamiliar expression for him. 'I can take care of myself, Dean,' he said. 'And, if I Fall, I know you will catch me.'
The dance ended and he escorted her off the dance floor. He thought that would be the end of it, but she insisted on sharing a drink, signaling to one of her bodyguards. Dean groaned internally, but put on a brave face and conversed with her.
They had gotten separated early on. The system of caves had been playing hell on Castiel's senses, so they had very little warning when the wendigo jumped them.
Castiel suck in his lower lip and looked away. He rubbed his hand across his mouth and down his cheek before looking back at Balthazar. ‘More like…seven.’
John would go hunting on his own, slipping out and leaving his boys with little more than a note. Sometimes, they would be left with another hunter. Dean knew what he was hunting for. Information, leads, anything on the Yellow-Eyed Demon. On Azazel. How easy would it be for him to tell John everything he knew? A name. But he couldn't. He was in it for the long haul. He had to be a good son. A good brother. Unlike before. He couldn’t betray his new family like that. He was happy enough.
Karen turned back to Crowley and held her hand out in greeting. ‘My name is Karen. You must Gabriel and Castiel’s father. It’s good to meet you!’
And seeing Dean squirm and back off…but still hopeful… Still coming back for another try… Castiel couldn’t place why, but it was as if Dean was used to giving up. And yet, he kept trying.
Castiel had already complained to him about the producers for Gabriel’s show. Michael and Lucifer… He had been trying to get them off his own back and onto someone else’s for the past two years now. It looked like he was finally getting his chance. Now, all he had to do was play his cards right and not screw up his chance at freedom.
, I understood and expected. I… I broke up with you because I thought you had cheated on me with Crowley. …Um…Cas? Castiel? Are you crying?’
Castiel blushed deeply and tore his eyes from the screen. He had trouble keeping them away, and he could feel Dean’s amusement.
‘She’s dead because she was a Campbell!’ Gabriel wailed. He took a calming breath and continued. ‘Her father’s angel was handed off to her, and he helped her escape. She released him on the condition that he lead the attackers off her trail long enough for her to get a new identity. But it wasn’t good enough… It took a few years, but they found her again, and…well… You know what happened.’ Gabriel stared at his feet.
Castiel made a small, distressed noise in the back of his throat. ‘Yes, of course,’ he happily replied.
Dean turned around fully and knelt between Castiel’s legs. ‘But that’s what… Well, uh…’ He trailed off, not wanting to trigger another bout of misery in Castiel. ‘I’m here for you. No matter what, and for however long you want me,’ he eventually settled on saying. ‘I love you, Cas.’
Castiel’s lips parted, and he wasn’t able to stop the small moan that escaped. ‘I…I have been given permission to…fraternize,’ he said, barely above a whisper. His mind momentarily panicked when Dean drew back. Was that all that Dean had wanted? The potential taboo? But that couldn’t be right. Not from what Dean had just said. His thoughts came to a grinding halt at the wicked grin Dean was giving him.
Sam turned and gave Castiel a bright smile. ‘Hey, Cas! Just making some popcorn,’ he said. ‘You want any?’
‘Then we better hurry along,’ Crowley said. He pointed to Balthazar and Meg. ‘You two with the Hunter and the missus.’
‘I-I uh… Dean? Don’t get too close, he’s….er….temperamental,’ Castiel said. He set the bags down and went to stand near Muffin, ready to scoop the cat up the moment the claws came out. ‘Wait, don’t—’ He broke off and stared dumbly when Dean reached out to touch Muffin and no hissing was heard.
was more important than the house. Not as an angel, but as a person. He only went in for the books after he knew I was safe.’
‘They’ll never find you,’ Alastair said conversationally as he pulled the knife away. He turned to the cart of tools and set the knife down. He picked up a set of pliers and turned back to face Dean. ‘You see, your sweet, little brother is looking in the wrong place. Wrong city. Wrong country. Wrong continent.’
While Dean had vanished to the bathroom, Castiel quickly called for room service, ordering a few choices for breakfast. He then scanned through the movies that the hotel offered until he found what he was looking for. He grinned sheepishly as Dean reentered the room. ‘I uh… Here,’ he said, playing the movie. ‘If room service gets here before I’m done, just sign for it and give them this.’ He handed Dean some cash and turned to grab a change of clothes from the bedroom.
Gabriel frowned. He had only ever used his powers to play tricks and keep hidden. Finding supernatural entities wasn't one of his primary talents. Whenever he
‘Jump in!’ Sam shouted. He was careful to keep his tail hidden beneath the boat and his fins down as he floated in the water.
else to reimburse me,’ Crowley replied. ‘I do some freelance work, and they’re possibly interested in getting Castiel to help out every once in a while.’
There was nothing. No divine retribution from Heaven. No word from Heaven of what to do with him. It was slow, but Heaven abandoned the old routes of communication. At first, Seraphiel had thought it was a sign. They would finally do something to stop him. He found the new lines, and with them, a change in Enochian. The words were new, but the message was the same. The same prayers. The same guidance to give aid. Nothing about his deeds. Nothing about tracking him down and stopping him.
He had never felt a sense of lust coming from his imaginary partners before. Maybe he was getting better at lucid dreaming. He was enjoying the sensations when Dean let out a low groan. And then it hit him. It wasn't a dream. Dean really was touching him.
Sam laughed, trying to imagine Charlie attempting to escape discovery. From his own experience, learning to walk wasn’t the easiest thing. He was lucky in that no one had seen his first steps. ‘So what happened?’ he asked after he caught his breath.
After an hour of circling the island, Castiel cut the boat’s engine and dropped the anchor. In the distance, he could make out a small fishing vessel. Quickly, he stripped down and pulled on his wet suit, a simple black with blue running down the sides and along the seams. He pulled up the zipper along his back and sighed happily.
Balthazar raised a brow at Castiel as he tilted his head. ‘Then why focus on the compulsion and binding spells?’
He had his own stalker-angel. He didn’t know what to think. He turned over another photo to find a badly written poem on the back.
‘That’s…impossible,’ Karen insisted. ‘I’ve only met two angels capable of smiting and they… They’re…’
do,’ Dean said, cutting Castiel off. ‘Especially when I’m this low… I can’t power my body on my own.’
Sam kissed the top of Gabriel’s head and carried him across the room to the bed. ‘Anything I can do right now to make you feel better?’
Dean bit his lip. ‘Ghosts leave me…noticeably high. Everything else… Well, someone would notice if a bunch of monsters went missing. And it would take a hell of a lot of them to make up for one demon.’
‘No. Cas just…lies. About stupid shit. He lied to me this morning about his toothpaste.’ Gabriel sagged as he leaned against the wall. ‘Sorry, we don’t really talk about it. We know we’re not helping the problem. We just ignore most of what he says, and sometimes call him out.’
‘Thought what?’ Dean asked. He still couldn’t gather his thoughts. Not with Castiel’s bare chest within reach.
Castiel reached up and wiped a tear from Dean’s cheek. He hugged Dean tightly as Dean buried his face in Castiel's neck.
Balthazar rubbed his hand along Castiel’s chest and frowned as his fingers ran over a tough bump under the shirt. He reached through Castiel’s collar, ignoring the annoyed grunt, and pulled out a pair of scales on a length of leather cord. ‘Wha’s this?’ he asked, raking his nail across the ridges.
Dean woke up slowly. He blinked blearily at the lights above him. He had a hard time recalling the previous night. Had he dreamt it? Did he dream up Castiel…Jimmy?
Dean smiled at Castiel, the term completely lost on him. ‘That sounds fun. How did it go?’ he asked, trying to get more information without actually having to ask.
Gabriel pulled a face at the slight urgency in Castiel’s tone. His brother would definitely be crashing soon. He really should have waited before making him sign the contract. Why did
‘You’ll get over it,’ Sam said distractedly. He was standing on a ladder, changing a light bulb in one of the ceiling lights.
Castiel nodded. ‘Since I was thirteen. It was part of the sex talk, so I assumed it was in some way related.’
tricked me into signing on for another season for his stupid show about fake creatures that actually
Gabriel leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. He grinned up at Sam. ‘French or Tahitian?’
Sam shifted uncomfortably. 'Well, he must have had his reasons...,' Sam trailed off, looking to Gabriel for answers.
Dean skimmed along the bottom of the ocean floor, staring up at the underside of Benny’s boat. Benny had asked him again what he wanted in return for helping. He already had everything he needed. A cave with a pocket of air, food, company… But what did he
Dean looked up, frowning. Castiel’s voice came from further away. He found Castiel standing next to the door, his hand resting on the handle. ‘So that’s it. You’re just gonna leave. Drop that fucking bombshell on me, then ditch?’
‘What if we threw money at you?’ Dean asked as he struggled with his socks. He was getting better at dressing and undressing standing up, but his balance was still iffy.
He knew he had at least a few broken and cracked ribs. He had more than enough cuts, burns, and bruises. A few broken fingers…a couple missing nails. Torture sucked. It had been four days, and no sign of rescue. He doubted Sam would just give up on him. Not without a body as proof. His brother had to be out there, somewhere… He could hold out a little longer.
Dean nodded as he fiddled with his scales. ‘Yeah… Oh! Do you have a…a bag. Or a box. That can go in water?’ he asked.
‘I thought…I thought things would be different,’ he confessed. ‘But it’s all the same. Everyone’s telling me what to do. What not to do. They treat me like a…a…a broken leper!’
