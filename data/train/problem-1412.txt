"The tree is here." Mrs. Hudson said softly from the doorway a short while later and helped move the arm chairs so the tree could be situated near the bookshelf and the window. It was just the right size to leave room for the star on top without it touching the ceiling. "Oh it'll be beautiful." She gushed.
"It's alright Papa. Daddy always says you stop the bad people. He says you're the only one who can if Uncle Greg can't." Sherlock and Hamish looked up as Greg and Mycroft appeared on the stairs. Sherlock's brow suddenly furrowed, a realization sweeping over him. Hamish moved to the side just as Sherlock leapt up off the couch, leaving the poor boy affronted.
"No, we just went to sleep." He mumbled as he curled up in a ball next to John. "Make it stop." He pleaded sounding too much like a child but he was simply too tired to care. "John." He whined, shoving him a bit harder. John grunted and woke, grabbing his phone. It took him a minute to realize why he was even awake but when he sat up shaking hard as he pulled himself from bed and fumbled about putting his trousers on.
"Why?" Greg asked with concern.
"He's not crying because he hit me or because of what I said." Sherlock said softly, rubbing Hamish's back and softly singing the same little song Hamish had sung to Marius a little while before. "It's alright Hamish, the bad men are gone now. No one else will be hurt... No other Mommies or Daddies." He whispered into his ear, Hamish clinging to his chest, his head on his unhurt shoulder and his face nuzzled against his neck.
"I remember getting ready to go out." Sherlock explained. "Have you already forgot that it's our anniversary?" He teased Victor with a smile. "We met on this day, well, yesterday, two years ago." He smiled fondly at Victor, running his hand through his hair. "You look awful, Vic. It's like you aged ten years and got hit by a bus." He frowned a bit as he touched his face, his thumb brushing over his lips. "You look sick. Are you alright? Maybe you should talk to that doctor, that is if he's not too emotionally compromised." Sherlock said it as a tease but Victor flinched on John's behalf.
"You make me sound noble when you say it like that, brother mine." Sherlock whispered.
"Stop it Sherlock! Stop touching me." Victor growled, slapping his hand away. "Yea, your best friend... After everything..." He got up and started pacing even though it hurt his head to do so. "I don't know why I agreed to this. What was I thinking that
"Sherlock... A-are you sure?" Victor hesitated. He was almost afraid of himself. Afraid touching Sherlock would somehow hurt him again. Sherlock blushed at the comment about hands. Of course hands would stay where they should. When John crawled into the bed, he got as close to him as possible, trying to show Victor that he truly did want to be there. He looked to Victor with a reassuring smile. Sherlock lay on his back and John pressed into him, the two of them looking over at Victor with reassuring smiles.
"Whatever you want," He whispered unsure of what exactly John wanted but knowing that he was willing to give it to him. "Anything, just stop crying. Please." He brought a hand to John's cheek and wiped a few of the tears away.
"Ah, it's for me actually." Mycroft swept out of the room and met Anthea at the door. He came back with two large duffel bags that he tucked into the corner over the top of Hamish's presents. Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he deduced what had happened and he burst into a wide smile.
"Do you want help, Victor?' John asked gently as he moved towards the kitchen.
"How he hurt?" Marius asked with concern looking down at the teddy bear trying to see what Hamish saw. "Was he shooted?" He asked with worry because he knew how bad that was, especially after knowing his mother had been shot. "I can't fix him if he been shooted."  He said with a bit of frown, his voice becoming a bit high. Greg was quick to move over and ran his hand through Marius' hair, trying to calm him.
When John woke the next morning it was because he heard a very familiar knocking on the door. That very light insistent knocking that would only become louder. Finally came the yell, 'Daddies!' He jumped up quickly, the door wasn't locked and neither of them were clothed.
"Neck-lace." Hamish sounded the word out slowly. The cab stopped and Sherlock hugged Hamish tightly to him as he opened the door and scooted out. He paid the cabbie and smiled as Hamish got excited again. "Pancakes!" He shouted.
"You'll be a wonderful big cousin." He assured him before looking up to Mycroft. "Isn't he beautiful Myc?" He asked hopefully. "He'll need a lot of love and affection. Do you think we'll be able to give it to him?" Hamish scooted into Mycroft's lap, facing Greg and Marius. He gently pushed his hand through the sleeve of John's shirt and started rubbing Marius' head the way John did when he comforted him. But he started softly singing a song in French. Mycroft's eyes widened slightly and he blushed. His attention on Hamish for a moment. He watched how tender Hamish was with Marius, how easily he adapted to the new presence in his life.
"Don't worry, you two will adopt a child of your own and we'll be having play dates soon enough." Sherlock grinned. He looked at Alex and wondered if he was doing something to upset him. He could read Alex's emotion in his face easily and it bothered him far more than it would have previously. His eyes darkened slightly and he moved his finger as if he was going to start spinning his ring but stopped when he saw the look Victor gave him. Victor turned to look at John who raised an eyebrow at Sherlock and Mycroft sighed softly. Right, there were three of them to catch him brooding now.
"I know, Sherlock." He whispered running his hands over him as he held him close. "You will get clean. I will help, I'm not leaving. I promised and I mean it." Sherlock let out a shaking breath, trying to forget about his worries as he hugged him tighter, breathing in his scent. He still smelt like Sherlock's shampoo. Sherlock grimaced and shook his head.
"I'm fine, really. I just stood up for a little bit and got this awful head rush, I'm fine though. I promise." He insisted, trying his best to smile at John. "Here, get in." He ordered as he reached behind him to turn the hot water on. John wasn't convinced and it gnawed away at his heart, but he decided to give Sherlock the space to tell him on his own. He set his stuff down and took his bathrobe off.
"We could have it done up with blue paint and gold trim. We'll get gold colored sheets and curtains." Mycroft offered softly, turning just slightly to watch his brother and Hamish. Sherlock gave him a look: We're fine.
"I couldn't watch you hurt like that. Those withdrawals were how I learned how important touch was for you. That was when I first talked to Sherlock about this. When he encouraged me to start giving you more hugs. It made me happy to be the one to help you. I... I love holding you." He barely breathed the words, blushing more. "I always have. Since I first touched your arm and felt you relax, even though you pulled away." Victor closed his eyes, trying to keep himself from tearing up at the thought of never getting to do this again.
"What the hell?" John growled softly as he heard voices in the living room and realized Sherlock wasn't in bed with him. He was worried until he heard the tones of those speaking in the living room,
"Pancakes!" Marius cheered happily. "Papa Myc is maked pancakes!"  John sat with Hamish on his lap at the kitchen table, Greg dropping down across from him with Marius as they watched Sherlock and Mycroft with fond eyes. Both of them carding their hands through the boys' hair. John sighed contentedly as he watched them.
"You two are back to this again? And here I thought you'd gotten some sense." Greg sighed and raised his hands slightly as they both glared at him. "Fine. Don't think about the fact we worry about you. We're going out of town tomorrow, so we won't be able to take care of Hamish for a few days. We'll be back before Christmas," He added when Hamish pouted.
. Do you have any idea how my blood has boiled all day, learning that another man once held your heart?" His voice was dark, full of emotion. But it betrayed the deep sentiment that made Sherlock so desperately want to regain control and prove to him that none of that mattered. "It was so hard not to throw you over the table, say forget dinner, and fuck you until you couldn't move."
"Hm...." Hamish said thoughtfully, back to playing with Sherlock's scarf. "We should get her something pretty!"
"I am not a prick! I haven't done anything to you!" He insisted through gritted teeth.  He opened his eyes and glared at John, not caring that the man was crying at the moment. At least he hadn't cared until he noticed. Why the hell was John crying? John didn’t cry and he certainly didn’t seem aware of the fact that he was now. "It's none of your business and I'm not going to tell you so you might as well let me leave!" He stood slowly only to be pushed back down again by John's angry hands, "STOP FUCKING PUSHING ME AROUND JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T PROPERLY DEFEND MYSELF!"
"Don't speak to me that way." He ordered.
"Would you boys like to go now?" He asked with a smile. "Or should we wait a little bit and see if John wants to tag along." Marius jumped into Greg's arms.
"I don't want you to cwy eider. These men are nice. Dere my Uncles and if you wanted dey could be your new Daddies. Dey make the sad go away." He whispered, cuddling closer to Marius. "The bad men are stopped now, 'cause of your Mummy and Da. No oder little kids will get hurted." Mycroft watched almost in awe as the two boys hugged. It reminded him, rather painfully, of the way he'd had to comfort Sherlock when their grandparents passed when he was young. Hamish looked painfully shy but a little happy. "Do... Do you fink we could be friends?" Hamish asked Marius, blushing again. Greg covered his mouth with his hand, trying to keep back the soft cry that escaped his lips. This was adorable and beautiful. He had never seen two small children bond this way before, so quickly, and without judgement. Not even his own girls when their beloved cat died. They didn't grieve together; they all dealt with it alone. But these two little boys were holding on to each other and freely crying, Marius more than Hamish but it was clear a few tears had slipped out.
"I love you, John." He said for the first time, and it was easy. Spoken just inches away from his mouth. He heard John's breath hitch in his chest as the words washed over him.
"Mummy always said tissing was for people who wanted to be married to each other." He told Hamish with a giggle. "You don't wanna marry me, do you Mish?" He asked curiously.
"Oh I know that look..." Victor said softly. He laughed. "Wedding first, Mister."
"We are spending the night here, but your Dad and I will sleep on the sofa bed." Mycroft said smiling. "I have to go to work for a bit tomorrow but we'll stay here for a few days."
"No, you're not." Sherlock whispered, setting his phone aside and curling up next to John. He wrapped his arms around his lover and kissed his cheeks many times. "There's something wrong. I just don't know what it is. You have to tell me what it is so I can help you." He ran a hand through the blonde tousled hair. "Did I upset you?" He asked, sounding worried. "John, I m so sorry, I didn't mean to." He meant it completely even though he had no idea what he had done.
"What do you see?" He asked softly.
"I forced a piece of toast down your throat before we left the house this morning." John chuckled because Sherlock had cussed at him for fifteen minutes after John had shoved the offending piece of bread down his gullet.
"God no," John forced out, through heavy breath. "It hurt but it felt amazing..." He blushed quite red and swallowed hard. "I uhm... I didn't know I liked it
"Hi..." Hamish said quietly, coming over to them again. He offered Marius his juice box. “Would you like some juice?” He offered quietly.
"I will try." He said, still blushing.
"Greg, hush..." Mycroft's voice was soft, he furrowed his brow. He wasn't sure how to comfort Greg in a moment like this. "Take these lessons forward and make the best of it. That's all you can do. Honor those that fell. Make sure those responsible pay for it. You and Sherlock both will do that. He's just as upset as you are, I can promise you that. He feels like he failed you and made you suffer. He'll never admit it but he does." He gently rubbed Greg's back, holding him tightly. "It's okay..."
"No. He does?" Hamish asked Sherlock in awe, scooting into his lap. Sherlock put his arms around him and let him snuggle in close.
. Home like no other place had ever been before and sadly would ever be again. He loved Alex without a doubt and he could be loyal to him and him alone while spending the rest of his life beside him. But his heart still held tender, aching feelings for the two men who made Baker Street their home. He knew anger was waiting behind whatever smiles he got today, broken hearts and words that were never able to be spoke because of how abruptly he had turned away from them. It had been the hardest decision of his life, turning his back on them when he knew they still needed him. Still
"Maybe you should tell him that?" John offered softly. "He is always messing things up. But he seems to think I do some good in your life... Or did until yesterday at least."
"Oh I'm ready, Daddy. Let's go to the park." His smirk was a mile wide and his voice betrayed his arousal. John's cheeks were slightly red as he walked out the door, avoiding his husband's gaze.
"Of course. Any young girl is just so flustered at just a simple glance from
"Come on Daddy, put your coat on so we can go." Sherlock grinned, teasing John. Hamish giggled and crossed his arms, pretending to pout.
"That was what I was hoping you two could tell me." Mycroft sighed and opened the case file, showing them fuzzy surveillance images of what looked like Sherlock and another man talking, exchanging money and something else, and then parting ways. Each picture was labeled with a location and time the picture was taken. Each correlating with one of Sherlock's absences from Baker Street and each taken in a neighborhood that was traditionally considered to be a hotbed of drug activity. "He's been more erratic in behavior and contact with me recently  and he failed to complete a case I asked for his assistance on last week." Mycroft's mouth tightened more, watching as John tensed even more. He was worried the man would snap.
"You all had a money pool on Sherlock developing a love life?" Mycroft sighed and his mouth tightened, his tone indicated he thought the very idea was ridiculous. "John has been an interesting catalyst in his life, I can't deny that." Mycroft conceded, taking a moment to reset his countenance before continuing. "I know for a fact we would have lost my brother several times throughout the years without him at Sherlock's side. But now I worry Sherlock is simply trading one addiction for another..." Greg sighed as Mycroft tensed. He was in his worrying mood. He wouldn't laugh when he got like this, at least not for awhile. When he got this worried his sense of humor just went on holiday and it took forever for him to find it again. That also usually meant he knew something about the scene they were heading into and wasn't open to putting Greg on his guard.
"Yes." He answered his voice cracking as he wiped away Sherlock's tears. "Of course, Darling, yes." He insisted and he kissed the hand that was gripping his own. "I love you so much; you have been a wonderful husband and a fantastic father." He smiled softly and continued to kiss Sherlock's hand. "Yes, sometimes I do get a bit lonely but that does not mean I am unhappy. How could I be unhappy? I have a perfect son, a beautiful husband, and some wonderful friends. I have no reason to be unhappy, Sherlock."
"You moved chairs, Daddy. Dat doesn't count!"
John felt his cheeks warm at the thought and he shook his head.
"Dank you, Uncle Jawn." Marius called right after Hamish thanked his father.Greg moved to sit on the arm of the couch next to his husband. He really wanted to sit in his lap but he doubted Mycroft would allow such a thing with Sherlock around to mock him for it. So he settled for wrapping an arm around his husbandand kissing his cheek.
"I want to show you how much I love you, John. You do all these amazing things for me, and I don't do nearly enough for you." Sherlock cupped John's face and kissed him passionately. "I think I'm okay enough to go out. Do you want to go on our first date?" He offered shyly. "We can go to Angelo's, or anywhere else you might want to go. I'll follow you anywhere, John." John blushed because whatever he had expected Sherlock to say that had not been it. He didn't know if he would ever get used to the amount of sentiment Sherlock was able to express in so few words.
"Hamish what are you doing?" John asked with a laugh as he watched their son crawl up the stairs and go running towards the kitchen.
"I know so, brother mine. Besides I may actually murder your husband." Sherlock turned his gaze back to Greg, his voice darkening quickly. Both John and Greg looked alarmed at the sudden shift in Sherlock’s energy. "Just when
to react to news like this. Ripping John's clothes off, throwing him down over the bed, and shagging him senseless was bad. He knew that was bad.
"The day I say no to an offer like that slap me because that really right now that sounds like the best thing in the world." He smiled brightly at Sherlock before kissing him a little harder than before.           They hadn't done more than kiss in the pass week. Which wasn't because they didn't want to, rather it was because they just didn't have time. "Oh," John said with a soft moan into his mouth. "Maybe we can play in the fort after Hamish has gone to bed?" He suggested with a wink.
"Oh... Fuck, John." Sherlock growled, panting hard. His heart pounding in his chest, because he hadn't expected John to need him this much. He bucked his hips up to meet John's motions, shuddering from the feel of how tight John was around him. "God yes, take it. Use me." He gasped the words breathless with his arousal. He let his hands run down John's chest until his found his erection, wrapping his hand tightly around him, so each motion John made pumped Sherlock's hand over that aching cock. "Like this?" He growled. "Come on, use me."
"He needs us John! He doesn't have anyone else!" Sherlock said eagerly.
I am deeply sorry for the delay! It's been crazy for me with life and this chapter was a BEAST. There's only one chapter and an epilogue (or two) left to post.
"Oh no." Mycroft said firmly, but he blushed a bit more. "I am
"I didn't think you would behave." John smirked.
"You're the only one I can be like this with," He confessed, the blush deepening slightly. His eyes searched John's, trying to figure out everything about the moment before him. "I don't know what I'm doing... You gave me your heart and your life and I just... I'm like Hamish. I'm a child with the world's greatest treasure balanced in my ill prepared hands." He finally looked away, looking a bit ashamed. "I thought by now I would have figured out how to carefully protect you and keep you at my side. How to make you always smile that beautiful smile you get when you're truly happy... But I haven't. I wake next to you each morning and I feel like I have this tender balloon in my chest that could be punctured at any moment because I can't take care of you properly... Do... Do you feel like that? How do you deal with it?" His voice was still soft, almost a terrified whispers as he confessed his own inadequacies and begged John for confirmation. John frowned, he hated when Sherlock sounded so scared and there was nothing he could do about it. There was nothing he could physically do to protect Sherlock when the problem was emotional.
"Yea, this is what we get to put up with when you two are late." Greg crossed his arms, looking a bit upset. "John, you have stitches in your arm. Poorly done too... Jesus Christ did you have Sherlock do these?" Sherlock's gaze narrowed. Greg looked absolutely upset.
"Trust me, I'd be much worse if I wasn't restraining myself." The detective promised.
"No. You play with Marius, make him happy." Hamish ordered, snapping his words at him. He pushed away from Victor, and Victor just let him go. Hamish got down and walked over to Greg looking up at him. "Thank you for getting the biscuits. I'll have some when I come back." He then turned and after a brief struggle opened the door to Sherlock and John's room, slipping inside and pushing it closed a bit hard behind him. He hoisted himself up in the bed and cuddled into John, sniffling some as he did.
"If you're still feeling the nausea you can take something for it now." He said to Victor his attention focused on his water. His body ached, his fever was back, and he felt too much. There wasn't anything he could do, he knew that. Nothing he could say would help Victor through this, but he desperately wished he could. He pinched the bridge of his nose resting his arm on the arm of his chair. Despite not wanting to deal with either John or Sherlock, Victor sighed and walked into the living room. He turned to look at John first, Sherlock catching the gaze before closing his own eyes. He leaned back and let his body relax. If Victor trusted John maybe his being asleep would help him open up more.
"Sh, we'll let Daddy sleep a little more and then we'll wake him. Come help your Uncle make tea." Mycroft motioned and Hamish complied easily.
"Good, I'd be jealous." Sherlock said with a weak smile. He continued to stroke John's legs as his favorite doctor fed him. "It's different every time, but last month it was only bad because I got hold of some bad stuff." He explained with a frown. "I almost told you then because coming down was so bad."
at me. You can just give me a look that turns me into a puddle. You know it too, you've used it on purpose and thought I didn't know." He licked the outer part of Sherlock's ear before gently grazing it with his teeth. "Just relax into it, go with the moment." He encouraged, one of his fingers tracing up the line that followed Sherlock's sternum.
"It sounds like you want to be in control." He noted and Victor, suddenly feeling a bit bolder nodded.
"Alright, sit down with your Daddy." Mycroft moved into the kitchen and brought Hamish a small bowl of grapes.
"Mummy!" The little boy shouted at the sight of his mother gasping and choking on the floor. "Mummy!" He sobbed again, kicking and screaming against Sherlock as he held his arm out to keep him back. The boy desperate to get to her.
"Oh yes, thank you." Mycroft grinned, not blushing. Victor pulled back and looked at Mycroft with confusion.
"In front of all those people at the yard, John? You dirty thing." He giggled as they continued to kiss even more. He forced himself to pull away, smiling down at John. "No. No. See we're just getting started again, John." He warned with a smile.
"Of course it would, Greg. We need to figure out a way that Sherlock can have time with his family and still work on major cases like this. You rely on him for everything these days... It's like you don't trust yourself anymore." He couldn't stop a smirk as they came to the bedroom and saw the two boys giggling hysterically.
"And you never told me, you jerk." John mocked being upset with Greg but laughed. He rubbed Sherlock's leg. Greg grinned.
"And a doctor outfit!" He giggled.
"Marius, I don't want you to ever think you can't talk about your Mum and Dad or be sad about them. Whatever you need to do, you just tell us and we'll make it happen if we can." Mycroft said quietly. John chuckled and lifted Hamish into his arms.
"How are you feeling John?" Mycroft asked, looking him over but not checking his temperature despite an inclination to do so.
it. This was better than the drugs ever were, he didn't care if John became an addiction. "Will you please fuck me, John? I've never been fucked before, don't you want to be my first?" Sherlock sat up slightly, looking down at John as he begged.
"Not going to happen. You two are like teenagers, especially you. I need to supervise you." John laughed and blushed but with Sherlock's encouragement grew a little bolder, reaching out to gently cradle Victor's cheek, something he hadn't done before. His thumb sliding gently over the soft skin.
"Oh no..." Sherlock smirked and he maneuvered so his toes hooked the waist band and slowly slid them down. He followed them, licking a hot trail down John's chest.
"I shouldn't..." Sherlock's voice cracked and he tugged at his hair hard. Hurting himself but not caring as he did. He was angry at himself. He hated this. He hated feeling so much. He banged his head on his knees and tugged at his hair harder, trying to make the feeling stop. "You haven't taken your medicine yet have you?" He was still shaking, clawing at his scalp.
"Papa Myc! Come back!" Marius said eagerly, craning his little neck to see where Mycroft went. Alex held Victor's hand under the table, squeezing it reassuringly to let him know it was okay. Victor smiled softly, almost grinning when John's hand came to rest on his other one adding to the reassurance.
"I didn't know you still tried to figure out which cases were mine." Sherlock added, the surprise and emotion in his voice very clear as he tried to cut through the heaviness of the moment.
"Oh John dear are you ill?" She asked softly, trying to determine exactly how much of their minds the two of them had lost. The blanket fort and broken table were not leaning heavily in the favor of sanity.
"What is it 'Mish?" He asked quietly.
"Of course we do. You're as much a part of this family as the rest of us." Sherlock added.
is this?" He asked with a chuckle as he stepped into the room and found Mycroft and Sherlock gently teasing each other as they set the table. "I do believe I've died. Though whether I've been very good or very naughty is up for debate." He grinned.
"Love, love, please stop." John said, sounding panicked as he tried to grab Sherlock's hands and hold them still. "You're going to pull your hair out. Just stop, please." He whispered in his ear as he finally caught his hands and held them tightly. "Forget about me for one damn minute, Sherlock. You're upset. Don't push that aside just because of me. Please." He kissed his cheek a few times, trying everything in the world in hope of relaxing his husband. Sherlock's entire body shuddered hard, because now he had nothing to distract himself. His breath was ragged and the tears refused to stop.
"I luv...you too." Marius yawned and before he knew it, he had slipped off to sleep with their movie still playing. Hamish had a handful of John's jumper that Marius was wearing, their heads pressed together and the two of them curled up into a ball as he mumbled something and sank all the way to sleep. Sherlock huffed in annoyance but it was directed internally. He blinked slowly and seemed confused at the state of things.
"Well Papa wouldn't come in the fort..." Hamish pouted. Sherlock got up as the food arrived, paying for it and bringing it in and giving it to John.
"I can operate fairly well on the amount of sleep I got. You were supposed to wake me up if you couldn't sleep though." He chided gently, still running his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "Why did you come out here?"
yourself." He chuckled. Mycroft cleared his throat gently, Greg enjoying the blush warming his usually pale cheeks. He would never get over how easily sex could knock Mycroft out of his normally collected demeanor.
"I keep a gun too. Guns aren't anything; we've faced people with guns before. Six snipers, do you remember?" He whispered, rubbing his back. "Strapped with a bomb and sniper sights on our chests and we were ready to do whatever it took. We've faced chemicals too, that fog in Baskerville - we can face this. This isn't like before, you aren't alone. And we have the upper hand too, because once he sets foot in this flat - or really anywhere near it - he has eyes all over him. You know Mycroft won't let anyone hurt you here and since you're not leaving this flat without me he can't get you. I don't care if he draws a gun on me, we'll make it out. We always do. He can't force you and if he does I swear he'll answer to me." He wasn't trying to let it but his anger boiled over in the words. He rocked Sherlock slightly trying to force his anger down.  "Maybe we should go away from Baker Street for awhile... He wouldn't be able to find us."  Sherlock knew John was right. He knew it but yet he was still afraid. His body was betraying him once again just like in Baskerville. He was more prone to having these sorts of emotions now. He knew it was okay to show himself like this in front of John but he feared he would break like this in front of anyone now.
"They're really good." He told their son with a soft smile. "Do you still want your hot cocoa? I think it’s cool enough for you to drink now." He promised as he handed the small cup with a tiny Santa drawn on it over to him.
"Thank you, love." He whispered when the new ice pack was place on his back.
"You are just as bad as John." Mycroft snapped and sighed, his voice low and upset. "You know this is difficult for me and yet you enjoy tormenting me." He was positively pouting but without actually doing so. "I had no idea you had other fantasies. I have never heard you complain about our... Lovemaking." He said it rather sternly, but his was still very red.
"You're the boy's grandmother Mrs. Hudson, of course we want you here." John assured her before looking back at Victor and Alex with a forced smile. He didn't know why but he suddenly felt a bit jealous. He wasn't used to seeing the pair be affectionate and it seemed like it might start eating away at him if he didn't change his attention to something else.
"It's none of your business, I'm quitting. You two can stop panicking. It's done. It's over. John's going to help me through this so you two are not needed." He said firmly. Sherlock sat up to take a sip of the cold ice water simply hoping it would cool him off. He wanted them to leave, he wanted to be alone with John not on display in front of his elder brother and the detective inspector.
"I'm sorry, Sir." Sherlock said with honest and apologetic eyes. "You should punish me." He nodded, pulling away from John to sit up. "How do you want to punish me, Captain? Do you want me to bend over so you can spank me?" He was trying to be serious but a grin wormed it's way onto his face, showing John just how much he was enjoying this.
"Yes!!!" Hamish giggled. John chuckled and wrapped his arms around the both of his boys.
"I'm happy." Hamish pouted.
"Nanny, did make all these cookies by yourself?" Hamish asked quietly, awe in his voice as he did.
.” He hissed, groaning as he buried his face against the couch. His stomach was turning somersaults and his arm felt sour from the injection John had given him. He closed his eyes as his head throbbed, pain giving way to noise as his brain began to pull itself from it’s quiet, nothingness. This was the part he dreaded, the part where the deductions slowly crept back in. It wasn’t a choice to deduct everything all the time, it was an instinct. It was as natural to him as breathing and he did it even when he didn’t want to. He had little control over it most of the time. As his brain kicked back into high gear he exhaled sharply, “Fuck.” He groaned as he realized that it was
"I rather agree. It has occurred to me that perhaps leaving Baker Street for awhile might enhance your recovery. Don't you think so Sherlock?" Mycroft's jaw was still tight but the blush hadn't faded. "I could arrange a small cottage in the country..."
"Did you say something?" John asked quietly as he returned from the kitchen and set down a glass of water near Sherlock. His face was tight as the rage started to wear off and was being replaced by all of the feelings he was trying to keep hidden.  All the things that rattled around in his chest and threatened to destroy what little sanity he felt he had left. "I cannot believe that you trust me to shoot people who might harm you but you can't be arsed to tell me what's going on with you. There are plenty of other ways to distract your mind that don't end up with you in jail, a morgue, or dead in a ditch somewhere." He snapped, but much more gently as he checked to be sure that the doors were still locked and adjusted the temperature on the blanket. He gently removed the ice pack and a few minutes later replaced it with a kitchen towel soaked in ice water and wrung out, which he placed over Sherlock's forehead and eyes. He took a knee next to the couch, looking at Sherlock almost directly at eye level. He took Sherlock's wrist gently between his fingers, checking his pulse. "You're lucky I'm not someone else, Sherlock. Lucky that I don't just run away." His voice was soft, but clear. "But if you intend to keep using I need you to tell me now so I can leave before..." Sherlock listened the tone of John’s voice, to how his words still cracked with hidden emotion. He was too ashamed to even defended himself. He was the idiot. He saw that now. But he was only an idiot because he never considered how much this would hurt, John. He always thought he wouldn't get caught. He thought if he was careful enough John would never have to know and they could continue their life just as it had been. He was wrong and now John wanted to leave. Just like everyone else did.
"That's the whole point, Sherlock. We want him to be scared."
"If you had asked I would have been surprised." John grinned but he moved so he could snog Sherlock, kissing him until he was almost about to pass out. "I'm glad it was so good for you, because it was bloody amazing to watch how much depriving you of touching me drives you nuts." He whispered, his forehead against Sherlock's. "I definitely want to do that again sometime."
"I'm sorry if I hurt you." He whispered, pressing soft kisses to the love bites. "You make me crazy. I can't think, I just need... Need you." He nuzzled into his neck, humming happily.
"I do." Greg said with a chuckle, he had Mycroft on the edge now. "But I don't know if I should tell you right now. You're already so very flustered and I think if I get you anymore flustered we'll start doing things we shouldn't do with children nearby." He kissed his cheek softly, moving his hand to his chest and stroking it gently. "I can tell you if you like though, if you think you can control yourself."
do that," Sherlock said, saying that very dramatically. "I am much better than that, I can't believe you." He gasped and Victor hit him on the chest playfully to make him stop and grab his attention.
"Oh..." Victor said softly, his eyes turning to Sherlock who tensed. "So it was you two over at those flats..." He sighed as Sherlock looked down, fighting the desire to comfort the detective that clawed its way up into his chest. "Marius and Hamish have a bit in common, don't they?" He asked tentatively.
"I do not believe that you are in any position to lecture me, Dr. Watson." His voice was laced with anger. "I do believe in any medical circumstance romantic liaisons with patients are frowned upon." Mycroft looked dangerous.
"Should... Should I be concerned about that?" Alex asked the detective with hesitation.
"No, what?" Hamish asked, his eyes wide with excitement.
"Because you don't do sentimental? I have always just been waiting for you to observe the truth. I have loved you for a long time. You saw it in the beginning, realizing I was flirting with you when I hadn't been intending too... But after Irene you sort of pulled back. Then after you came home I was too stubborn to speak up." John smirked before giggling but it made him cough too. "We're a right mess." He sighed. "I'll make us some fresh tea, then I think I need a nap. You are going to need to talk to Victor sooner or later love."
"Get him out of here. I don't want him to see." He whispered as he closed the kitchen door. Sherlock was sitting at the table while the medics worked on his arm. His expression was... Shattered. He almost looked as if he was the one who had lost his parents. Greg slowly walked into the room, keeping his eyes on the floor. "We did what we could, Sherlock." He whispered, trying to reassure him while not waking Marius. Who had finally cried himself to sleep.
knock on Nanny's door to see if she is ready for breakfast." Sherlock offered. "Marius hasn't met her yet and do you smell it?" Sherlock leaned down so his eyes were level with Hamish's, hinging from the waist to do so.
"Maybe he wasn't looking. Look at the data in front of you Sherlock," John offered quietly, trying to put it in terms Sherlock would understand. Victor was amazed at how easily John did this. "I stopped dating remember? Ages ago. Even broke up with the woman I had been intending to marry when you came home. Because if you were alive and there was a chance there wasn't going to be anyone in the way. Ever." He held Sherlock tightly and sighed. Sherlock was completely overwhelmed by the sound of the emotion in John's voice. "It isn't your fault."
"John," Sherlock whispered suddenly sounding terrified as he dropped the phone next to him.
"Yes Marius, I will teach you. It will be nice to paint again." Mycroft smiled and having finished the food walked over to hug the boy. "Your Uncle Sherlock can teach you to play instruments if you ever want to learn. He's very good at music."
"I didn't think you'd be into that... And I mean... We've only just started... Not that I don't want to... I..." He sighed softly trying to calm the sensations running through him. Sherlock dissolved him into nothing so easily. "Are you serious or saying what you think I want to hear?" He finally forced out. His eyes searching over Sherlock's form. Sherlock curled up even more, his face a terrible shade of red. Maybe this wasn't the right way to approach things. John was right, they had only just started dating or... Whatever it was they were doing. He clutched his blanket close and wishing he could take back the fact he'd said anything.
"Oh, John." He breathed, a big grin on his face. "It was everything and more." He moved his lips to Johns and kissed him very slowly, not wanting to pull away just yet. When he finally did though he was still smiling. "I don't think I had ever been so aroused in my life." He giggled. "You did amazing," He kissed John again and again until he felt like he was being foolish. His hand now rested on the dog tags feeling the cool metal. "I should have asked if I could have these first but I wanted them." He smiled shyly before he ran a hand through John's hair.
, if he wasn't mistaken. The music was very loud, too loud. John approached the door and knocked even though Greg had told them many times to not even bother. "Oh God," He chuckled. "Hamish is probably driving them mad." He whispered to Sherlock who still looked quite cross with him for teasing him.
"It's going to be almost impossible to do that if he gets himself arrested, John." Mycroft's voice was stern. He sat forward crossing his hands on the desk and his mouth fixing itself into a thin line. "What do you propse we do?"
He was alright now. They were both alright now. John hadn't left and Sherlock remembered. John was asleep and near him and nothing could hurt him again. He heard the noises of someone walking around upstairs and frowned at the thought of Victor. Sherlock heard what John said about him being polite and not wanting to take him upstairs. He knew John's intention was to tell him that Victor understood his actions. But he wasn't upset about waking up in bed with Victor. He knew Victor would never take advantage of him like that. No he was upset because Victor had put his hands on him in anger, he injured him, and had caused John to suffer so much grief. He didn't know the right way to proceed from this moment. He wanted Victor to leave so he'd never have to see John cry like this again, but at the same time he knew John had already forgiven Victor which usually meant Sherlock should be more rational about his decision. He decided to start with talking, so he slipped his phone off the bedside table, sitting up out from the blanket bubble and making sure John was still tucked underneath. He sighed and keeping one arm on lump of blanket's that signaled John's presence he began a text to Victor.
"Jesus Sherlock, you'll make me go insane talking like that." John grunted and he slammed right back into him, leaning down and kissing him hard. He used the table for leverage to get deeper. "God you are so fucking tight. I'm going to cum so hard." He growled, pushing Sherlock's legs up so they were pressed against his shoulders and slamming into him even harder. "Touch yourself, I want you to fucking explode!" Sherlock didn't need to be told twice, he gripped his length and began pumping himself as fast as he could. He smirked up at John, they were both already so close.
"Where's Sherlock? I thought you two were working on a case." He said as he hung up his jacket, loosened his tie and removed his coat. Victor's health had come back in leaps and bounds under John's careful care and he looked so much better now. His muscles were coming back, the dark circles no longer lived under his eyes, and he was beginning to look the way he imagined he would after University. John smirked and motioned for Victor to join him on the couch, grinning as he did.
"Be careful boys," John said with a fond smile, as he walked over to the nightstand and swallowed down his pill without drinking any water. He coughed a bit and followed the others into the living room.
"Your hair hasn't been combed properly in three days which you've tried to cover over using your hair gel. Your jacket hasn't been cleaned in a week and you're wearing the same shirt as you were yesterday because you haven't had a chance to do the laundry and you refuse to allow me to touch it after I turned everything pink. You also forgot to shave this morning." Sherlock smirked, his mouth still close to John's. "You're just following me blindly into hell again and forgetting to take care of yourself. We're not setting very good examples." He ran a hand through John's hair, smiling as he did.  John blushed; he hadn’t even noticed he was forgetting to take care of himself. No matter how hard he tried that kept happening and he hadn't even realized it. Well, damn...
"Sometimes grownups can be wrong." Mycroft smiled, ruffling the boys hair.
"Well that would have shortened my career considerably." He pulled Sherlock to him, turning so they were facing each other. "I was never glad to be injured before but if I hadn't been I might not have met you - and while I wouldn't have known how hollow my life was it never would have been as fulfilling as it is now beside you." Sherlock blushed because he knew that John getting shot was the sole reason they had met. He had one simple injury that could have taken John's life, to thank for them being together. He smiled at John, bringing a hand to his arm as he started to stroke up to his once injured shoulder gently.
He'd seen it before at the clinic. He'd seen people like this but this was Sherlock and it absolutely wrecked him.
"It's otay. I just missed you." Hamish smiled and he cuddled back against Marius.
“You're angry with me now." John said with a sigh, feeling awful for not just letting Sherlock have his way with him. "I'm sorry." He whispered a frown on his lips as he rested his head on his husband's shoulder. "You don't have to do that, dear. I can go. It's the least I can since you're upset with me." He nuzzled his nose into his neck, giving a heavy sigh. "You've been teasing me all day and I was just determined to not let it drive me mad."
"Do we have to do it now?" Victor asked quietly. He want to be alone with John so they had time to do this exploring Sherlock was talking about.
"You want me to bruise you? If you wanted things to be different why have you never asked? I may not be as easily adaptable, but I would do anything for you."Greg smiled into the kiss, deepening the kiss for a moment and resting the urge to just climb on top of Mycroft and just take what he wanted.
"Uncle Mycroft won't like Daddy mentioning too much about our little prince on his blog!" Sherlock said in a teasing voice. "But we do need to get you a Father Christmas hat. Do you know what my favorite thing about Christmas is?"
"Are you afraid of someone hearing you beg for me, pet?" He asked softly, nibbling on his ear. "Tell me what you want, pet. Beg for what you need. Maybe I will give it to you." John frowned groaned. He really didn't want anyone in the other room to hear him begging for his husband.
"Uncle Greg! Grab the rope!!!" Hamish exclaimed, shouting as he threw the sheet again.
"Well it will be more difficult now, with a child." Mycroft sighed, he really didn't know how things were going to change. "We will make it work just as you and John have and will. But you have to let this go. Let those deaths be the reason you cherish every moment you can with Hamish and remind you of the reasons you have chosen this line of work." His voice was soft, not his normal snappish tone. It was a tone of comfort for his brother, his attempt to ease Sherlock's way.
Sherlock finally confronts Victor about what happened between them all those years ago, but it doesn't end well. Sherlock has a terrible fall, hitting his head awfully hard. How will John cope with his lover not being able to remember his face?
what to do. N'est pas?" He asked with a smirk, his hand finding Greg's hair again and tilting his neck back. He lavished kisses over it before kissing down to his shoulder. "Turn the water on and get undressed,
"Ah..." Mycroft said softly and looked down. He seemed to realize something. "Is this some sort of way to burn me with my own words, John?"
"Ah, so that's it then. You're having a panic attack." He announced coolly, his hands still in front of his chin. "I see..." He mused. "So you two think you'll be just fine without help."
"It's going to get worse as you come down. Whatever you need me to do, however I can help... Please let me." John didn't need to tell him, he knew how awful it was going to get. He had come down a lot these past three months. His headache was gone which was where most of his pain was so he was grateful, now all that remained was the cold feeling and the nausea. He was so close to Sherlock and his body was desperate to feel him, but he didn't want to push too far, too fast. Sherlock looked more and more confused every time John pulled away from their kisses and John couldn't stop his smile. "That look is precious, what's wrong?" He licked his lips, his tongue flicking over Sherlock's lips as he did. Sherlock shivered at the sensation, he had honestly never done anything like this before. He had kissed people, but never so intimately, never with their tongues brushing over each other, and never with his body reacting so strongly to the sensation.
"There is no possible way you could love my silly blush. I look like an over grown cherry." He argued, but he didn't dare pull away from John. He got as close as possible and let his warmth simply engulf him. "You look amazing when you blush though. Your skin is tan so when blush it's this lovely shade of pink under your skin." John blushed some at the explanation and their eyes locked together.
He peeked around the corner to listen for John walking back down the hall, in a hurry he sent one last message.
here." Sherlock groaned once he saw Mycroft sitting at the table with John when he came down stairs carrying a trunk filled with John's things. He was still only wearing some pajama bottoms and was actually starting to work up a bit of a sweat. He sat the trunk down, much to Greg's dismay, and walked toward the kitchen angrily.
"I need you. We need to go away for a little while. Just the two of us, alright? I know I have awful timing but I feel... Alone and I just need to reconnect with you properly." Sherlock blushed a bit.
"No, Sherlock." John said with a pout. "I want him here." He whispered, hating how childish it sounded. He gently pulled Hamish close to him and closed his eyes again. He had to. Keeping them open hurt. Everything hurt. The constant thump-thump-thump in his head made him want to scream but he forced himself to stay calm and try to go back to blissful sleep where that throbbing wasn't here anymore.  He wanted to curl up against Sherlock but he wasn't going to fool himself that Sherlock was calm enough to lay still in the bed and John was not looking forward to the motion sickness that would come from trying to get him to. "I want to take the medicine now." He mumbled, but he cringed when he heard the front door being shut. Too loud.
"Sherlock?!" Sherlock hadn't known what happened, one minute he was sitting down and then
"I'm sorry..." John said softly and carefully, slowly extracted himself from Sherlock's arms and got the Dramamine. He offered it to Sherlock, his legs shaking as he moved. "I can understand why he might feel that way. But I will supervise him doing it. He needs to be held accountable and if he does the drugs with the detox he can mess himself up pretty badly." John slipped back into the bed, knowing his legs weren't going to hold him much longer.
"What's wrong? What happened? Are you okay?" He asked the questions quickly, wrapping his arms around him.
"You shouldn't be having sweets." Sherlock scolded him.
Sherlock could physically feel himself fall more in love with John as he watched him take care of him so easily. Almost as if it was natural instinct to him. No one had ever cared for him, not like John did. Of course there were certain people, one of them being Victor Trevor, that would claim that they took care of him, but that wasn't the same. Sherlock shuddered, damming himself for even thinking about his ex-boyfriend/ex-dealer. He didn't need Victor now, he had John. Sweet, loving, and caring John whom he loved. He turned in bed curling up next to John and kissing his lips softly.
"I'll eat something later," Sherlock assured him. The injection had put him off wanting food. "But you eat, I'll deal with my brother. And as soon as we get rid of them we'll set up our fort again and go to sleep." He kissed John's lips briefly and then pulled away. "Back into the lion's den I go," He hummed before walking back into the living room and sitting next to Mycroft.
"We're fine Greg, no need to worry." He said dismissively. John frowned at the question; their child shouldn't have to ask questions like that.
things. If it comes out of my mouth I either feel it to be true or I mean it." He groaned loudly, kissing back with as much intensity as Sherlock gave. "I meant it, do what you want with me."
"On your knees." Mycroft commanded again, but kept his hands on Greg's shoulders. "Stroke yourself." He snapped, grunting as he pumped his own hand over his own cock. He groaned, he wanted more but Greg hadn't obeyed. "I want you to show me how well behaved you can be. I want you to sit there and stroke yourself without moaning. If you can do that for a minute I'll let you choose whether I
"You don't have to do this, John." He whispered. "You should get away from me. I'm becoming violent. All I keep thinking of hurting Victor and it may not be safe for you to stay near me."
Sherlock awoke to the sound of beeping and gave a groan before retreating under the blankets. John's dedication to his task was worth admiration but right now it was warranting another broken phone. He grumbled, fumbling around until he found John and shook him gently. John didn't answer so Sherlock shook him a bit harder complaining as he did.
"He's right you know." He said simply, but his voice was soft. Softer than Greg had ever heard it. "You save people, the evil men and women of the world hurt them. You aren't all powerful, sometimes people will get hurt but you will always find the ones that hurt them." Greg stared into Mycroft's eyes for a long moment. He had never seen him so open and caring. He realized in that moment just how much Mycroft did care for him and was reminded of how amazing it was to have the heart of one of the Holmes men. Especially Mycroft. He watched as Mycroft nuzzled his nose into Marius' hair sweetly, murmuring something gentle to him. Greg almost melted from the sight.
"You hit your head Mr. Holmes and because of it you're not remembering things correctly. This is your flat, we're flat mates. I think you should go get some sleep. There is no need for you to worry about me, I'm fine." John said the words firmly but he looked everywhere except at either one of them. "You two should get some rest, you've been having a rough time. I'll check on you again in the morning and make sure you're not too jumbled." John's voice was even but forced, the wall of emotion behind his eyes threatening to swallow him whole. He tried to remind himself this might be temporary. He turned to Victor, walking over and putting a hand on his arm. A hand that Victor grabbed tightly on instinct, desperate to offer him some reassurance. "Since Mr. Holmes doesn't remember what happened most immediately before this happened we'd be better served to keep him in his comfort zone Victor..." His chest shook with a silent sob, a loud coughing fit, and then a bit of a wheeze. Victor could see the thoughts under the surface of that medical mask. He watched as he got the only mirror he would ever see of what it was like to be in his own shoes. He felt the tender feelings that stirred in his heart, urging him to be as kind to John as possible and suddenly he understood Doctor Watson more than anything else could ever have shown him.
"I missed you too. I just had to go take care of Daddy." Marius yawned before he closed his eyes and hugged Hamish tighter. "Is Santa coming night or marrow?" He asked curiously in a very tired voice.
"Well?" Victor demanded and Mycroft chuckled.
"To the case that brought you Hamish." Mycroft stated firmly, but confusion evident on his face. "I thought you solved that case. Didn't you two catch the person who committed all those murders?"  Greg frowned.
"I'm trying too, love."  John said, his mouth now full of noodled. He smiled down at Hamish and hugged him closer with one arm. "You just watch your movie, buddy. I'll make sure your Papa eats." He promised him. He looked over to Sherlock with a soft smile, "He's
"Oh, oh my... Sherlock." He gasped, sounding desperate as he reached for his touch. "Let me hold you." Sherlock whined again, still caught off guard by the noise as he almost completely collapsed on John. His arms shook, barely holding him up. It took several minutes before he could even shift enough to slip out of John and the slight movement sent him gently down on top of his lover.
"Well, Mister are going to come over and give me one?" He asked and Marius giggled even louder.
." With those two words he brought all of his focus was on John. The man he had been struggling to place in his mind palace. Friend or lover? That's why he went back to drugs. He couldn't understand his feelings for John and not thinking about them was just so much easier.
"I'm okay." He said softly, now not sure if he was trying to convince himself or Sherlock it was true. He looked away though, his body shivering slightly. This was all wrong, he couldn't be sick or panicky now. He had to be strong, to protect Sherlock from himself, from Victor, from the world. "It was just a panic attack." He forced out his body slowly stopping trembling. "You're right we're safe." The truth was he didn't know how to focus on himself, he'd forgotten. It felt like drowning. That's why he needed Sherlock because it gave him something to focus on. Someone who was worth all the effort. So as the panic attack slowly wore off he didn't see the very clear signs he would never have never missed in another. The signs that screamed he was actually sick. "I just must be too tired. After that case last week and then work and this, I'm just worn out. I'll be alright Sherlock. Thank you, love." Sherlock was glad that John had stopped shaking but it was obvious that John was still stick. But for how long? How long had this been going on without him noticing? How long was John going to pretend it wasn't going on now?
"Oh, we don't even need words for that." Mycroft smirked. John blushed again.
Sherlock, Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, Hamish - Holly
"I will." Sherlock swept towards the bedroom, he slipped in barely letting any light in.
"How on earth did you hear all that?" Greg asked with amazement. He had just pulled his phone out of his pocket after receiving a text from Mycroft saying he was going out with Sherlock and John had stayed and was resting down stairs. Mycroft also said Victor and Alex were still hanging around.
"God forbid but if there is a next time, you can pick where we dine next time, Brother." Sherlock said quietly, revealing something rather emotion based himself. Mycroft simply nodded.
touch. He gasped loudly, gripping the sheets tightly. "Oh God, John!" He moaned and focused on keeping his eyes shut tight, determined not to move. "Thank you for sucking my sock, Captain." He panted, trying his best to be submissive for John. He would have to do more research later, so next time he would be even better at this. A grin toyed at the edge of John's lips, he understood that Sherlock was out of his element and it made him absolutely giddy with ego. He didn't care about power anymore, all he cared about was making Sherlock feel amazing. He sucked him harder, humming as he did and enjoying how Sherlock tensed. He gently, slowly pushed his finger inside Sherlock - moaning around him as he felt how tightly he clenched around his finger.
"Seriously, what is going on?" Victor said quietly, looking mildly shocked. He motioned between the two brothers, looking slightly incredulous. He turned to John and Greg with a skeptical look. "Have you two
"Fuck!" John grunted loudly. "Yes, Sherlock. Only yours." He panted, digging his fingernails into the sheets. "It's all I could ever be." He pushed back into Sherlock unconsciously as he pressed forward, moving desperately. "Only ever yours." Once Sherlock felt John push back onto him he took that as he could finally start fucking him.
"Be specific." Sherlock growled. "You can whisper but I want the words John, I want you to tell me
question. It was hard enough to admit he was feeling something, considering his personal opinion on feelings in general. But it was even worse to admit that those feelings were so overwhelming to him, so incredibly distracting and strong that he'd needed drugs to make them go away. Still, it would be wrong for him to lie to John anymore so he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and let John hear the truth. "T-That was why I started using again, yes John."
"I wanted a kitty cat, but Mummy said I not big enough to take care of it."  Marius said with a pout.
"Paris... We could go for Christmas." Mycroft offered Greg to soften the moment. John looked out the window trying to soothe his own nerves. He wasn't angry at Sherlock but any mention of Victor made some strange rage sweep through him, a jealousy he didn't yet understand. He couldn't possibly understand that he was jealous of not being Sherlock's first lover. He turned back, feeling a bit mollified and grinned.
"Begging isn't really taking control though, is it?" He whispered in his ear, moving so he was spooning his shorter husband. "I have considered you begging for me..." His voice dropped and Greg shivered as the arousal in his tone rolled through his body. "Putting you against my desk," He whispered darkly in his ear, just barely audible. "Using my walking stick to cane you for misbehaving..." He said it as if they were discussing lunch, but a smirk was visible on his face and his voice was still low. "But I confess this idea of you putting
