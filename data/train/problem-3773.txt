Cas stares back, unrepentant. “Any time there is a choice to be made, I would choose you.”
Dean wishes he could use that as his own excuse. Actually, he kind of can. “Me neither,” he says. “Not like you, I ain’t an angel, but— Been a few nights since I really slept.”
“Dean, please tell me what this is about.” Cas is more hesitant. This time, it’s a much softer ‘
Sam’s eyes drop down to the jumbo-sized bag of pork rinds in Dean’s hand. Noticing this, Dean shoves it a little too violently back onto the rack, and it makes an annoying crumpling sound that goes on for about ten seconds after Dean has already retracted his hand.
. He leans down to carelessly shove the pile of trinkets into the moldy open box, powder staining his fingertips, stacking everything back up in record time before hoisting it into his arms.

“Are we really gonna just sit here and eat?” Dean asks no one in particular as they settle into their room.

“Of course,” says Cas. “But don’t do it for my sake.”

“I’m so sorry, Jack,” Cas finally says.
It’s like you think you’re just—in the background. What were you
Dean looks up, innocently. “Aren’t you?”
The radio isn’t even particularly quiet as Dean drives, but everyone is sleeping through it anyway, the Impala’s windows incandescent with the red and yellow tail lights of other cars. Unfortunately, the lack of conversation gives Dean time to think.
Like—

How can he? Underneath a bone-deep exhaustion, Dean’s buzzing, feeling so electric it’s a wonder his own skin can even contain him. But—
The shape of his second chance, his better world, his one
holds himself to some imaginary standards that he would never dream of applying to another person.
“Dean! Sorry, I was just coming back to collect the Men of Letters artifacts, but I guess I—dropped them.” He looks down at the mess as he awkwardly states the obvious. “But it’s fine, it’s probably all junk anyway,” he adds, going for casual for the fiftieth time today—but this time, he actually seems to succeed.
He shifts on what appears to be a floor of black, but there is no floor, doesn’t even feel like the hard, unyielding surface he was expecting. It feels like whatever’s beneath him could suck him up and consume him if he isn’t careful. On all sides, he’s surrounded by walls of black, except there are no walls, either. It’s endless, but then, it doesn’t even start anywhere—it’s both everything and nothing. But mostly nothing.
When he gets back to the motel, dad and Sam haven’t come back yet, so he gets in the shower. He stays as long as he can, scrubbing the filth away, his breathing ragged and hitched hidden with the sound of the water.
When his seventeenth birthday comes and passes, Dean wishes it had been like the other ones, boring, unremarkable, just his everyday life with perhaps some cake.
Their house is on the outskirts of town, far enough to have some privacy, but close enough that there are some other houses near them. The place is a real fixer-upper, it was rumoured to be haunted and no one has lived there since the late nineties (they check, it’s not actually haunted, but the legend makes for a good price).
Dean looked at the small bundle in Sam’s lap, tiny fingers wrapped around his feeding bottle. But all Dean could see iis that he is Lucifer’s son.
They both were quiet for a while and slowly Jack drifted off to sleep. Dean kissed Jack’s forehead and put him in his crib.
“Come on, Dean. It’s been three months since Cas died. I miss him, too. But you can’t keep drinking yourself to death. Please, talk to me.”
“You know, Castiel, he was an Angel. You have his eyes. He has these blue eyes, eyes like the sky. Every time I look at your eyes, you remind me so much of him. Hell, you even look like him. I don’t know how much you know about Cas, how much your Mom told you, but he loved you before you were even born. He believed in you. He believed that you will be good for this Earth. You will rid this Earth of suffering. But he is gone now, and I don’t know where he is, heaven or somewhere else, so even if you do all that, he wouldn’t be here to see it all.”
Cas was looking at him with a worried look in his eyes. Dean cursed himself for panicking and making Cas worry.
Sam sighed and said “Do you want to hold Jack for a while?”
Tears were rolling down Dean’s face, but Dean continued.
He rubbed his eyes and looked at Jack again, but it was back to blue. Did he imagine that? Did he hallucinate the golden eyes?
Jack was looking at Dean without taking his eyes off, as if he was absorbing Dean’s every word.
“Hello, Sam” said Cas.
“Nooooo. I want to sleep. Few more minutes”, Cas grumbled.
He was making some bacon when all of a sudden he remembered his dream. He was making Cas bacon and eggs too. He felt the spatula leave his hand and drop to the floor. Dean’s throat closed up and tears were threatening to spill from his eyes.
“No, not yet. Not until I get my morning kiss.”
Dean laughed as he leaned in to offer a kiss that’s just like everything else this morning - soft, gentle, and perfect.
Dean heard a loud wailing sound and he jerked awake, clutching his heart. He looked around trying to get his bearings. It was a dream. It was just a dream. Yet it felt so real.
“I am sorry, Cas. But hey, you are back now, I am so glad you are back, pal.” said Dean, and before he could lose the courage, Dean added, “and I missed you, so much”.
He stays there, waiting for something. Wishful thinking, he knows.
to know, Sammy, he has to.”
’s. Cas’ stoic demeanour remains when he is around strangers or outsiders, but the weight on his shoulders has lifted, and when it’s only them, or their family, he smiles and laughs. Dean spends every waking moment trying to make Cas smile, if there is any being on Earth who deserves to be happy, it’s his angel.
He goes to sleep that night with a feeling of happiness, plain and true, as children are prone to, ignorant of his John and Mary’s arguing and the fact that it would be his last happy birthday for a while.
Castiel’s own smile widens as he leans down to peck Dean briefly. “Happy birthday.”
He makes dinner that night, and then they eat the cake that Lisa made; again, the good mood hangs over them nicely. Ben made him a hand-drawn card –the kid’s got some talent- and Lisa gives him a new pair of boots.
They barely move at first, too concentrated on trying not to fall, but they find their footing, and then they are twirling around the field, not really dancing, but they don’t care, and Dean is spinning Cas, and then Cas is dipping him.
Cas is gone, he had confessed his love to Dean, and now he is gone, and Dean had done nothing to stop it from happening, nothing. He'd stood there, staring at the crying angel in front of him, he’d watched as the Empty took him.
They also have habits now, healthy habits. Dean’s alcohol consumption has lowered significantly, and Cas insisted they eat healthier; hunting had required them to stay somewhat fit, but now that they’ve stopped, they had to find some other way of exercise. The gym was crossed out quickly, but Dean found he didn’t hate running along the river close to the house, and they walk Miracle daily, too.
“Dean-”
Finally, he says, “I can’t leave him, Sammy.”
Sam comes through the door then, an alarmed look in his eyes. He freezes at the scene in front of him, before smiling widely. “Cas! You’re back!”
“Jack,” he breathes, distantly noticing Sam and Eileen turn their heads as well.
He stands after what could have been an eternity, his joints very much complaining –not that he pays them any mind. It is nearing dinner time, and he doubts either Sam or Eileen would want to go out to celebrate now.
They go back to the bunker –the book he’d brought with him all but forgotten-, hand in hand, and it just feels so
Retiring is weirdly easy.
He doesn’t break down when he sees all the people in Lebanon, going through their days as if nothing had happened.
The locals think they are a bit weird, they are aware; not that they blame them, really. Dean sometimes remembers his time with Lisa and Ben, he’d felt out of place then, but it isn’t like that now. Before, he was always on high alert, waiting for the monster around the corner, still mourning Sam, constantly feeling like something was missing, too used to the action-packed hunter life, waiting for the moment people would find out who he really was. Now, he’s happy, content to leave the action behind, knowing the world is in good hands, that his friends, his family, are safe, all but embracing the quirky, married couple image that their neighbours conjured.
They also haven’t told anyone. Jody has said she’d go visit with Donna and the girls soon, and even if Claire feigned indifference, he knows Cas and her have grown close. He hopes he won’t have to tell her.
The morning of his forty-second birthday, Dean wakes up slowly. Despite being January, he feels perfectly warm, both because of blankets and the arms wrapped around him.
It is rushed, and desperate, trying to make up for all the years lost, there’s way too much teeth, the force with which they kiss is bruising, their hands are everywhere, they are gasping for breath. Dean’s had much better kisses technique wise, but none of those hold nothing against this one, this kiss is just perfect.
Cas looks positively delighted, beaming at him. “I love you, too, Dean, more than I ever thought I could.”
So they go to the clearing, “prepare the spell”, Chuck shows up. Michael is all but livid at how easily his Father trusted him, how little credit he’d given him; he is done being God’s mightiest weapon, not when it was all a game for Him. His death is a sacrifice that no one could have predicted back when the first apocalypse happened.
“Don’t you ever do that to me again!” He doesn’t really intend to say that, but the words come out on their own, and the tears haven’t stopped, so he hopes Cas understands what he means.
“Cas, please, come back. I- I never got to say it, you didn’t give me a chance, man,” he chokes out. “It was too quick, with Billie, and- and... Please, you told me I was good, I wanna prove to you that you were right, but I can’t if you’re not here. Cas-” his voice breaks. “Come back home, angel.”
“Nothing wrong with that. Go on find the right one. Settle down. Have a crazy life. It’s worth every minute of it.” Dean said with a grin as he looked around the room. “Sammy owns the dinner. We’ll stop by tomorrow and see about getting you an interview.”
“My nest is tidy. She treats me like I’m fragile.” Frank resisted rolling his eyes. He knew his mom would slap him if he did. “If you’d come over more often you’d know this.”
“I’ll get it!” Mary called out when she noticed her mom and dad were caught up in a conversation with Arthur and Garth. She shifted her plate to one hand. After putting on a bubbly smile, she opened the door. “Hello.”
“There’s two thing’s he’s passionate about- sex and baking.” Dean shrugged his shoulder. “I’ve had him in therapy since he was fourteen. The therapist told me I have nothing to worry about. He has high self esteem and a sex drive to match. He gets himself tested frequently, and asks his partners to do the same.”
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
Dean watched as both his pups nodded their head. They’d always been honest with them. Even given them the option that if they wanted to seek out the alpha they would help. But the pups were content in their life and the information was just that information.
With a grin John kicked the chair from under his brother. He didn’t care that he was the omega and that his brother was the alpha. “One of these days you’ll be all about the ass.”
“I get pregnant and my head goes in a trash can and toilet. You get pregnant and you get tired.” Frank frowned. “You know that’s not fair… right,” he grumbled.
Dean patted Margaret on the head when she gave him a huge grin. She was very proud of the tooth she had lost a couple days ago. “Mind your manors.” He reminded her.
Dean fresh from a shower stood just outside his door. The hall, especially his door still reeked of possessive alpha. Knowing it was the smell of his son, and not Castiel made his stomach churn. He sprayed his door down with neutralizer until he sneezed. “I hope you’ve got a bed and remodel in the plans sooner rather than later,” he said when he heard Castiel’s door open.
“Seriously mom go before you change your mind for a fourth time!” Charlie laughed, and nudged him toward the door. “You’ll have a house to come back to!”
* I know most use the juncture of neck and shoulder to calm an alpha/omega for scenting. But I’m using all points except the crotch/ass (that would be counterintuitive). Wrist, armpit… wherever they can get there nose in, they are going for it.
“Why would anyone? They want everyone to think Vader is perfect… as Alpha.” John grinned wide like a Cheshire Cat. “It’s part of the appeal.”
“I have a penis and I like balloons.” Keith blurted out. “Should I wear a condon?” His pronunciation of the word ‘condom’ was slow and messy, and didn’t come out right. He’d tried his best though.
“Absolutely,” Dean said as he closed the door after Garth and Arthur.
“If you’re serious I won’t turn you down.” Frank couldn’t help the excited but sheepish grin on his face.
“Seeing as seventeen pups didn’t scare either of us off we’ve got plenty of time to discuss simple things… like my favorite insect being the bumble bee,” Castiel grinned. “I personally like that we got the awkward out of the way.” He pulled the plate toward him and picked at the edges of the burger.
Kristina gave her brother an uncoordinated high five. “We got this! We mommy’s big helpers!”
Dean nodded with a grin. “This makes me feel better about what I wanted to suggest.” He wrapped his own arm around Castiel and snuggled close. The pups weren’t even close, but he wanted to keep this private. “No mater how I try and wrap my head around it. I just can’t. You and nine pups in a camper…”
John got up and strode over to Keith. He knelt down and grinned. Between the two of them he said, “condom,” he enunciated the word for him. “You don’t need them until later.”
Kenny finally spoke up, “it’s an older tradition. Dad said next hunt we’ll all be participating. The alphas are to provide their chosen omega with a deer or similar kill large enough to sustain the family during the trip. The omega if they accept what’s been presented to them will run. The run itself is to align and heighten the respective heat and rut… allowing for a successful catch.” He went over the general basics more for his newer brothers and sisters since they didn’t seem to know the tradition.
“Garth. We’re nothing but family here even if there’s a few new faces.” Garth smiled warmly as he shook Castiel’s hand. He sat down as he excitedly said, “it was me. I all but invited myself. When he called me up and said you had a pup who was interested in becoming an officer. Color me curious.” He gave an apologetic smile.
Castiel stood up so quickly that he found himself tripping on his legs. He mentally cursed himself for his less than graceful start. Finally, finding his footing he chased after Dean.
Castiel caught the interest in Dean. He hadn’t honestly thought about replacing the other furniture. But if there was matching furniture then why not. “Consider it sold.” He stretched out his free arm to shake Donatello’s hand.
At some point, neither knew the when or the how, the take out was on the ground and Dean was against the wall. Dean was clutching the lovey tightly with one hand, and Castiel’s trench coat with the other. His own face buried in the crook of the juncture between neck and shoulder. It didn’t stop there. If there was a place to scent, they did so respectfully. Hands shuffling to feel muscle, but not arousal. There was a sense to heat one another up, but not tip past the edge. They finally broke apart to cup another’s face. They were sweaty and panting. There was an intense but respectful gaze- flashes of speckled alpha red and omega gold. They kissed gently with a promise that it would be more the next time.
“Will I ever know even his first name?”
Jack, Claire, Dawn, Twila, Mary, John, Charlie, and Dean worked quickly to serve first Castiel as head alpha, then their guests Arthur and Garth, from there the fledgling alphas, the non presented, and finally the omegas. After sitting down his pups, he served himself.
“You should be getting ready for bed.” Twila said as she turned him back around and pointed toward his room.
“Yep! I’ve got two big helpers,” Dean grinned. He then tilted his head upward and sniffed. The scent was all over the place. He wondered if it was because he was looking for his pup or trying to scent out him- like he was. After a couple tries he finally got a strong enough lead to follow. He found himself pretty much back tracking his entire walk through the grocery store right back to the spice isle. When the alpha was in view he cleared his throat, “are you missing a pup?” Not that his question would be heard over Keith’s squeal of ‘daddy’.
“You’re right. It did know what we needed,” Castiel grinned as he started to nibble. “I’m going to make sure everyone knows I’ve got the best omega.”
“That would be the extra bun in the oven that makes three.” Frank pointed out as he sat the box of hot chocolate down on the table. “My moms’s sister is going to be beside herself when you tell her she gets to deliver triplets.” He grinned.
“Anyways.” Dean rolled his eyes. “Mary and John are up stairs waiting for you. You all run along and find them. They’ll take you to your rooms, and help you get settled in. This house was designed for omegas specifically. Each room has four alcoves for personal space and sleeping. You can draw a curtain for privacy. In the center of the room in front of a fire is a nice cozy area good for cuddling. So we’ve got plenty of space for everyone.”

Amelia glanced over at her sister Betty before nudging Kenny with her foot. “Dad’s kicked our tails a couple times when we caused trouble. Sulking doesn’t make it better. Makes it worse.”
Dean climbed into bed, and pulled them both into his lap. “I believe you.” He nuzzled them both as he pulled Castiel down to join in.
Dean leaned against the door frame and watched the family as they played in the snow. If not for the bright colors the younger pups could have been lost in deep snow. He laughed when he saw the alpha pups working together to take down their dad. He whistled to get their attention. “Hot chocolate!”
“Fine!” Suzy rolled her eyes and swapped with her sister. “Someone save me some fried pickles.”
Castiel chuckled, “now who’s flattering who.” He kissed him back.
“You’re scaring me!” Dean laughed. He was about to hug them one more time, but his attention was redirected to Castiel who grabbed his hand. He looked at his intended and grinned. If they hadn’t been surrounded by pups he’d of said something lewd like ‘you just can’t wait to get me bent over’. “I get it. I get it. Let’s go.” He grinned, and squeezed his hand.
“Mine. I ran-”
“That’s really cool.” Betty grinned. “Can’t wait to help!”
“He’s strictly mine,” Castiel growled with heavy emphasis on the word mine.
After a quick prayer of thanks, Castiel started field dressing the buck. It had been a while and he was far from perfect, even with the refresher videos he’d watched. He inwardly grimaced at the thought of making a mess of this.
“It’s really not as simple as I make it out to be. I’m just lucky I catch so easy.” Dean laughed.
Castiel hugged his daughter tightly. He then held her at arms length and looked her in the eyes. Without words he was telling her not to disappoint him, but also the the was going to support her.
“So who do you think would win… Harry Potter or Iron Man?” Suzy directed the question toward the table.
“We aren’t teenagers getting to do everything for the first time. We’re seasoned professionals who have a way of doing things… it’s gonna take us a minute or two to get it right… if we’ve got to get angry with each other in the process I’m okay with that. My heart breaks just like yours. So, don’t expect me to smile through it when we’re mad at one another.”
“It’s best not to jinx these types of things,” Dean grinned. He relaxed a little and returned to a pose that didn’t scream I’m pregnant.
“People go around the world to do it. We just have to go to our kitchen.” Claire grinned.
“I know. I know. Trust me. I know how awful it sounds. Trust me when I say it have a chat with my pre-pregnant self about it all the time.”
“It’s perfect,” John gave his twin the thumbs up. “We should give Alex and Nikki a once over so they don’t look like two dirt balls…”
“Good Evening Eileen,” Dean signed and spoke as he walked into the diner.  After an enthusiastic returned hello he headed to his usual spot in the back corner. By the time Castiel was joining them she was already bringing him out a drink.
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
“Didn’t realize we were playing a game of dare.” Alex rolled her eyes.
“Busy work until the right one comes along. I’ve thought about applying to be a waitress in town.” Claire gave a shy smile. “I can’t imagine only having one or two pups. I want my hands full.”
“It easily got mistaken for a party… and just as easily got out of hand. Garth did come by with Uncle Sammy around elven-” Alex glanced over at Mary.
“Told yah we’ll have no problem catching when the time comes.”
Frank frowned and nodded his head.
“I’ve never seen a male wear a towel like that,” Castiel commented as Dean came out of the bathroom. “Or, have I seen a woman make it look as good either,” he added. The towel was riding high under Deans armpits and barely covering the curve of his ass cheeks. It was a wonder his cock was covered- if he got him even the slightest bit riled…
“We were teenagers trying to be adults. Trying to alpha and omega up before other people caught on.” Dean said softly. “Him claiming and marking me brought out the worst in his alpha. The smell of the pups in me made him think I’d been with another alpha.” He got quiet for a second before taking a deep breath to continue, “he’d claim and mark me over and over. We were to stubborn to give up on each other and what we’d set out to do. It about broke us. I don’t know who was more embarrassed when I had to call 911 and tell them I was knotted and my water had broke.”
“He unintentionally forced you into early labor.” Castiel frowned. “Please tell me it got easier,” his voice cracked. He didn’t like the thought of his omega hurting even if it was in the past.
John glared at his sister. “It’s true,” he said after swallowing. “Mom’s preached condoms, birth control… anything and everything since we were old enough to pay attention.”
Donatello shook it and smiled. “You two are adorable together.” He smiled. “Please excuse me. I’m going to make my rounds. I wouldn’t want to be considered a poor host. If anything else catches your eye set it on the bed and we’ll settle up at the end of the day. With the bed being sold this room is off limits to everyone but us.” He tipped his head politely and excited the room.
Kenny with some really old gear stood in front of Castiel. It was hard to say if he was sizing him up or leaving it be. Even if he’d accepted that he wasn’t number one alpha he still felt it. He knew he would until Castiel mated his mom. That thought made his skin crawl a bit- more at the fact of something being taken from him. He’d made his peace with it though once his parents had started sharing a room.
Standing in front of the bed, Castiel dropped Dean’s hand and flung his arms wide. “Other than a few things needing to be tightened it’s in perfect condition. Donatello says it’s been in his family for a good many years. But he has no children to pass it on to…”
“Certainly the bed for it,” Donatello laughed. “If you’re sure I’m not intruding I would really love to see your home. Especially once the bed is in place.” He motioned toward the furniture in the room, “there’s a matching chase and dresser with mirror if you’re interested.”
Dean stood there, grip firm on the bucket of ice water. “Kenny!” He hissed. He hadn’t had an alpha to help him raise alphas but he’d learned it was better to not put himself in the middle of their anger (pup or not), so he tossed the full bucket of ice water on him. Once he’d gotten his attention he shouted, “cold shower now!”
“So, this hunt you do twice a year… does it coincide with your heat?”
“Only when you’re making adult choices to do adult things.” John ruffled his hair.
That got everyone’s attention. They scrambled around the room for pillows and blankets. As they were setting up, from the hall came the exclamations of ‘sleep over’. It didn’t long take their fits of giggles to reach down stairs. Soon Dean and Castiel were joining them with snacks.
“Dean,” he shook his hand. “I restored Fuzzy Tails Boarding House. I kept it as true to original as possible and only modernized it where necessary.”
* We’re currently toward the end of August. Birthdays coming up are August 25 and September 6.
“If it had just a little sweat…” John wiggled his eyebrows.
* This like other chapters was not given an official edit. I reread it  at least four times and I’ll probably do it again. If anything crazy jumps out at you give me a shout out.
Nathan laughed. “Yeah. It’s not like we’ve got peacemakers.”
“Yes. Mom was trying to teach me the tradition-” He gave a small smile. “Mom has an incredible amount of patience in waiting so don’t take the first thing that comes along.” He paused long enough to inwardly sigh. He wasn’t going to outright say how many attempts it had taken him. “Make sure to field dress it quickly as possible. Once he’s sure the family is provided for he’ll run…” he swallowed a lump that was forming in his throat, “he’s fast and slippery,” his voice cracked. He was sure there was no hiding the fact that he couldn’t catch his mom.
“Yes. Remember when I said adult choices to do adult things?” John waited for Keith’s enthusiastic head nod before continuing. “This is that adult choice to do an adult thing. If you don’t use condoms you catch.”
Castiel noted how much Kenny knew and asked him, “did you do this last hunt?” He could tell this alpha was miles away from acting twelve. Sadly the boy rarely did. He wished he could tell him to act his age and it not offend him.
“I’m more than certain half my pups were not conceived on a bed,” Dean said without an ounce of shame. He turned himself around and snuggled impossibly closer to Castiel. “I’d bathe in your smell if I could,” he whimpered as he nosed along the juncture of neck and shoulder. He purred contently.
“Remember when you gave me dental floss because it was practical,” Twila rolled her eyes and laughed.
Castiel ruffled both Keith and Kristina’s hair. “You can help mommy and daddy with other things.” He winked toward Dean.
Dean had to focus every fiber of himself to be calm. How did anyone loose their pup? “Your daddy is probably just one or two isles over.” He gave the pup a good sniff, who in turn giggled. His eyes rolled into the back of his head. Now his priority was back on the alpha he was sniffing out originally… except now it was to return his pup, and not to meet him. What a fucking mind fuck this was. He didn’t know whether to be angry or elated.
“You know we could do up a batch of chocolate covered tomatoes.”
Dean watched as Castiel shuffled into the kitchen, pulled out a chair, and sat down. He chuckled, “so big bad alpha do you miss being twenty.” He sat a cup of coffee down in front of him and massaged his shoulders.
“You know the only thing he’s looking at is ass,” Kenny rolled his eyes.
“How?”
“They told us to turn down the music. Did a head count. Checked for alcohol.” The way Mary structured her sentences it was like she was going down a check list. She grinned as she glanced over at her twin John.
Dean still enamored with his gift, titled his head just a bit.
“I’m going to be a novelist!” Alex said matter of factly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suzy nodded her head as she stuck her tongue out again. This had the two of them laughing.
“You can tell that by looking at it?”
Castiel pushed him away from being so close. “Give me a chance.” With an eye still of Kenny, he picked up the hose. “Clean yourself up,” he growled and tossed it at him. With purpose he strode over to Dean and pushed him up against the wall. “My omega,” he growled possessively as he rutted against his leg.
“He was kind enough to call my brother who happened to be my emergency contact once we were done. Told him he better hurry up and collect me before someone decided they wanted sloppy seconds.” Dean frowned. It wasn’t his finest moment. He’d had years to replay it, bury it, and replay it. It got easier with time to talk about it.
Castiel was nearly giddy with Dean’s squeaks- they were adorable. He had to suppress his laugh. “Go ahead scent me,” he whispered. Once Dean was calm enough and peaking upwards he said, “I believe I speak on behalf of the family when I say we’d be delighted.” He kissed him gently on the forehead. “It would be presumptuous of me to expect to share the bed with you when I have yet to provide us one.”
“I’m angry at myself because I would have been angry no mater what you did. A new home would have made me just as emotional.” Dean let Castiel maneuver him. He breathed deeply through his nose and out through his mouth. “I’m selfish.”
Dean scrunched up his face. He hated to be a downer and state the obvious. “The pups…” it wasn’t that they were a burden. It was that they came first.
Dean looked down to see a small boy tugging at the ends of his leather jacket. He wondered briefly if he’d been mindless enough to run him over. Surely not because Kristina wasn’t fussy or laughing. “You okay?”
Nathan stared into the mirror as he scrubbed his teeth. He saw Kenny come in, and placed the toothpaste on his side.
Dean glared at John as he placed his hand on Castiel’s thigh and squeezed it. The last thing he wanted was bickering at the table- especially with ‘underaged’ pups present. This, after all, seemed like a serious conversation. “Lets finish eating before breakfast gets cold.”
“Yeah. So. Except for school they didn’t have responsibilities,” Kenny countered, putting emphasis on the word responsibilities.
“So how did you loose your mom? She didn’t die.” Kenny unfortunately had the frankness of youth and a bold alpha against him. Time had yet to give him the skills to add politeness.
“And knowing mom she probably found a way to invite Frank’s family.”
Castiel looked up at the ceiling and sighed, “the universe is laughing at us.” He saw Deans look when he’d said that and before the diner could be filled with the stink of rejected omega and frantic alpha, he blurted out, “I have nine pups.”
“He had eight and I had nine.” Castiel grinned and pulled Dean to stand flush against him, back to his chest. He nuzzled his neck, and rumbled. “And we can’t wait to add more.”
“We’ll get to that…” Jack made a face as he bit into his.
“Make what a thing,” Dean mumbled.
* I’m really hoping I didn’t make a mistake and type someone’s name wrong again. Even though it’s in my notes that Betty and Frank are together- I keep wanting to swap her and her sister Amelia. Here’s hoping I didn’t do it.
The uninvited alpha held up his hands in a non aggressive manner. “I’m not here for trouble.”
Mary rolled her eyes, “only you.” She smacked her twin on the shoulder playfully. “You know though you wouldn’t get THAT MANY. Not everyone is old enough to give them. And there is no promise mom and dad would cooperate.”
“Oh,” it fell off Castiel’s lips as realization came over him. “The dining room can be converted into a pull out- I can set myself up there.” He made his way out of the bed. “You should have the better bed.”
“That’s because you crushed hard on her.” Claire rolled her eyes as she teased her twin.
“Mary and I haven’t decided yet. But we like the idea of running a bakery together.” John grinned as he gave his twin sister Claire a high five.
“Do we really want to?” John laughed.
Dean involuntarily shivered. He nuzzled Castiel and purred contently. The chill of the outside a pleasant contrast. He yawned as his eyes slipped shut.
“So that’s Thanksgiving,” Castiel said as he closed their bedroom door.
Castiel ran his fingers though Dean’s hair and smiled. “I’m lucky as well. You don’t have to love and treat mine as your own, but you do.” He kissed him gently.
“Yeah. Be the alpha my dad is. Not some hot head. You can protect our mom. But I promise she doesn’t need protecting from dad.” Nathan grinned.
* Somethings may come off as rushed. Those things will most likely be revisited at another point in time.
“Better then Betty who wants to join up for services.” Amelia half teased as she punched her on the shoulder. “What was that slogan again. Be all the alpha you can be.” She laughed until she snorted which had everyone laughing.
“No. We always used mine. He was mated to the government as much as me. All I can say is… I wasn’t the only young and dumb one. He was equally so. His mistake cost him a life of servitude. But, it paid handsomely.” Dean gave a dry chuckle.
Nathan rinsed his mouth out before simply saying, “I just do.”
Arthur stepped in and once the door was shut he drew in a deep breath. “Dean’s at it again,” he grinned. “The house smells amazing and I’m not just talking about Thanksgiving dinner. Hint sweeter than usual.”
“I’ve got a few pups who are sympathetic pukers,” Castiel cringed. “What did I miss?” He glanced at Dean’s plate. “It’s not the turkey is it? Because everyone’s had turkey at this point.”
“Later I’ll show you one but not at the dinner table. That way you can see for yourself.” John nuzzled his brothers neck and head playfully to cheer him up.
“I’m going to go grab dessert,” Dean said grabbing his plate that had barely been touched.
“That doesn’t make this concoction right.” Dawn said as she popped it in her mouth as if it were a grape. “That’s like saying you can put chocolate on anything to make it taste better.”
After a nod of Mary’s head they both turned to face the door and their biological alpha.
“That movie was nothing but special effects!” John gripped as he scooted his chair in toward the table.
“I was on the force for twenty years. I retired to be with my pups.” Castiel supplied.
Castiel tilted his head, “afternoon Arthur.” He motioned inside the house, “come in.”
“I was that way with a couple of mine,” Dean chuckled. “Don’t let this experience stop you from having more. I promise it’s worth it.” He rubbed the bump. “Throwing up and being a zombie aside I actually like being pregnant.” He yawned and stretched. “I’ve never been this tired… not even when I was carrying twins.”
“You are the first person to ask me that. Shit. I don’t know. Maybe. It’s been so long ago.” Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “What’s done is done.”
“Yes,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, and bit his bottom lip nervously. He looked Castiel in the eyes and waited for something, what he wasn’t sure… maybe for him to run. He’d of run if he’d of been told that his true mate had eight pups. After all, that was a lot to take in.
“You kinda did it to yourself,” Charlie snorted.
“Maybe you’ll like this tradition… Maybe not.” John shrugged his shoulders. “It’s a learning experience.”
Dean snorted as he peppered kisses on Castiel’s lips, nose, and jaw line. “Save the cuffs for me detective.”
Scent of happy Omega filled the hall. Dean sniffed from one arm pit to the next. Then up toward his neck and toward his ears. He nibbled playfully. “It’s not going to come together fast enough,” he chuckled.
“We bake the nut bread mommy?” Kristina said in all her glorious four year old excited garble. In her mind she baked, and mommy helped… and it was delicious.
“Please stop! This is ridiculous!” Dean took a deep breath when he saw Castiel still. He tried to work the nervousness from him. “Besides you has anyone ever slept in this bed?”
Nathan’s eyes sparkled. “Can I ride in the fire truck sometime?”
“I personally like a stable alpha that can provide and knows how to work what he’s got,” Dean winked. “So, I’m more than glad she left you. I do feel sorry for your pups though.” He finally took a bite of his burger. No longer interested it and it being out of necessity, it was a small bite.
“You’re not. If my x mate had her pups at home and not at the hospital I’d be just as attached to the master… I was attached to the house because our family grew in the home. A lot happens in a home. First meals. First walks. First dates. Etc.”
“A pleasure,” Castiel held out of his hand.
Everyone nodded their heads.
Dean looked and Castiel laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Older… sounds archaic,” Dawn mumbled.
“I’m only caught because I want to be caught.” Dean situated himself to be more comfortable. He leaned forward and nipped at Castiel’s bottom lip. “Because of how fast and cunning I am several others have asked to chase me for the fun of it.”
“Why did your mom leave?”
Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair. Taking notice that everyone was inside enjoying hot chocolate he closed the door.
“But remember Iron Man died!” Nikki threw her hands up.
“At least they didn’t add unicorns pooping rainbows.” Nikki rolled her eyes.
Castiel chuckled, “I wouldn’t expect any less.” He ruffled his hair playfully. “After this hunt I’ll help you and your siblings train to hunt and catch. Then next hunt let’s work as a team.”
Kenny knelt down beside his dad. He put one hand on his shoulder, and held out the other for the knife.
“I get it. I do. But, this has been my space for eighteen years. I would have much rather helped you remodel and it dragged put for months… but I get it. You wanted to present to me something you otherwise couldn’t.” When Dean felt himself start to cry he looked away. “I’ve birthed most of my pups in here and now I feel like it’s all gone.”
“Yeah. Mary, you didn’t get anything of his. You look like my mom.” Dean unsure if it was okay to smile remained straight faced.
“Will anyone be showing up randomly at our door step?”
“I’ll be careful when he gives me gifts…”
Castiel kissed him softly as he ran his hands down along his chest . “This is just as nice.” He nuzzled under his chin and nibbled softly. “You smell…” his rumble deepened.
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
Dean pressed a finger to his lips as he took the package. “Life lesson number something something. It’s about the inside that counts. Kinda like size doesn’t mater, it’s what you do with it.” He laughed. “But, I’m going to assume by the feel that this isn’t a dildo.” Strangely that didn’t have him blushing.
“Appetizers will be out shortly. Are we ready to order or do we need a minute?”
“Nor mine. I’m just a boy from Kansas.” Dean winked. “Sam’s making sure the family legacy carries on- he’s got an alpha pup. I’d be more than honored to have your name.”
“What can I get you folks to drink?”
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
Castiel pulled Dean to him and coaxed him to scent him. He was still near the window where the air was fresh, and not thick with neutralizer. “Our pups have been taught to be respectful and follow chain of command. I’m sure your room hasn’t been touched.”
“Don’t say delicious,” Dean pulled Castiel closer. He pressed his face as close to him as possible and breathed in deep. He grabbled one of their blankets and snuggled. “Home, that’s what I smell,” he whispered.
“It isn’t like you can throw me down on it. It’s just the frame.” Dean teased.
“Is it? We’re almost half way there.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I suppose that is fair after the fool I made of myself yesterday at the supermarket.” Despite the even expression Castiel held you could tell he was smiling. “It’s shameful. I won’t forgive myself.”
“Has he ever gotten pregnant?” Castiel asked curiously.
What ever had been said was lost on Kenny. Pure and simple, this was a power struggle. He stumbled backward and found himself sitting in the mud. He leaned forward and grabbed Castiel’s leg and jerked him down to his level.
“Whatever. Fine.” Dean rolled his eyes and took the package. He didn’t want to give Castiel an ounce of satisfaction and thus refused to open the gift. He did keep it near to let him know it had been accepted. “I’m not forgiving you for having someone deep clean my space. I didn’t have dust bunnies!” A couple tears slid down his cheeks. He was deeply offended that Castiel had hired someone to clean the master from ceiling to floor. “I’m a very neat and orderly omega!”
“We sure are.” Castiel pulled Dean flush against him, back to his chest. He nuzzled his face into the juncture of his neck and shoulder. “Hate to tell you this, but I didn’t have to do much convincing when I mentioned we’d get some actual alone time for courting.”
“No. He’s overly cautious. He doesn’t want a mate or pups. Just wants to live and enjoy life. That mentality hasn’t changed since he was twelve and he’s eighteen and a half.”
“We’ve got two hours to bake enough chicken, veggies, and pasta for a mini army,” Dean grinned. “Piece of cake,” he said confidently as he grabbed aprons from the hooks on the wall. He tossed one to Castiel, and wasted no time putting his on.
Sophia looked sour for a moment before smiling. “You’ll be by the shop before long then for vitamins I take it.”
“You’ve got five minutes or I’m ordering for you,” Castiel said firmly, but not so much so that it came out as an alpha order.
“When’s Bobby and his mate Karen coming for a visit,” Charlie asked as she tugged on her moms shoulder.
“Programmer!” Dean shouted nervously. “Computer programmer.”
Castiel pulled Dean possessively toward him. He nuzzled his face along his hair line and whispered. “We’ve got Frank’s mom downstairs telling him he’s living in a regular ole nutters house.”
“Nothing,” Charlie smiled. “Anyways, it’s fixed.”
Twila pulled Kenny a little closer. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Margaret and Suzy crawling toward them. She held a finger to her lips, and then motioned for them to join.
“Flatter,” Dean purred.
Dean’s nose wrinkled. The stench of an aggressive alpha was the worst. He checked the pocket holder on the wall and saw no phones missing… so, outside interference was out. He knew none of the studies were seriously that hard- or for that matter the work tasks for today either. He grumbled as he put his book down and went to investigate who pissed in who’s corn flakes. On his way he grabbed the pail for ice water.
“I overheard someone is going to be sick,” Castiel said as he came into the room. “It’s not Dean is it?”
Kenny’s eyes narrowed as he looked directly into Castiel’s. Despite being out of strength and breath he continued to try and struggle. “You want to breed my mom. I can smell it.” Kenny huffed. “It disgusts me. A real alpha protects what he’s got.”
Castiel noticed his bed linens were just as much apart of the messy nest the two four year olds had made. He smiled. As best he could he wrapped his arms around everyone. “Next trip we’ll take you both with us.”
“She found a new alpha and disowned us.” Nathan looked into Kenny’s eyes. “A lot of alphas when they take on new omegas don’t want anything to do the previous alphas pups. An alpha can force an omega to take care of his previous pups. Doesn’t mean the omega has to like it.” He was shaking a little. He was old enough to remember her leaving, and to her not wanting him.
Dean laughed. “I imagine this is what my house looked like back at the end of August.”
“Twila and I want to design clothes.” Dawn stretched. “Maybe we’ll get lucky and be able to open our own boutique.”
John laughed. “Okay.” He sat him down for just a moment so he could grab just his hands. “Going to have you flying like Supper Man!”
“Of course not,” Dean smiled warmly. He lifted his head just enough before pulling out the adjacent seat. “Officer Fitzgerald, welcome. It’s a pleasure.”
“I guess we can give this an honest try.” Amelia grinned. “Betty, I think Frank would prefer you didn’t pull a John and have your way with him right here in front of us…” she teased.
Betty and Frank nodded their heads.
Dean stopped massaging and went around to his scratch pad. “This morning we are taking Mary, John, Jack, and Amelia to the local college for them to fill out the necessary paperwork to get a start on their careers. Then after lunch Claire has an interview with Eileen at the dinner. Lastly, we’ll have to book it to the high school to sign Betty up. I was told they have an excellent JROTC program. Oh and this evening the chief of the fire station is coming by for dinner to meet Nathan.”
“It was just a sleepover. Not a party,” she paused, “but, by the time we each invited a couple friends-” Dawn glanced over at her twin.
“He’s a sweet pup,” Dean grinned. They’d picked up another bottle, but he appreciated it. “I encourage my pups from a young age to help out around the house. I’ll have no loafers.” He took a sip of his soda and tried to steal a sniff to see if he smelled just as good as yesterday. He had to work around the smell of soft drink but it was there- to his delight stronger. He wondered if maybe Castiel had skipped showering, or worked out a bit before he came. His purr became one of excitement, he had to tone it down a bit so that it could be kept between them.
Dean did what omegas were good at when nervous- make themselves look small. He stared at Castiel, and took a huge breath. They’d seen each other naked, had plenty of mind blowing sex- but, somehow this was way different. They were intended. Intended went to their homes at the end of the night, he was kinda old fashion like that. Intended didn’t normally have sex. But their scents were so compatible it couldn’t be helped that they were so handsy with each other. If this had been a normal situation they’d of had a bed already, and been mated in less than 24 hours. He cursed as he mentally battled with himself.
“October isn’t getting here fast enough,” Castiel growled possessively.
Castiel watched as the two signed and laughed up until the point of him sliding into the booth opposite of Dean. “Good evening. What’s so funny?” He asked as he watched her walk away.
They both laughed as they quickly put the chicken and vegetables in marinara in the oven.
“This isn’t like mom.” Kenny said as he laid out cups, plates, and silverware. “Did you check on them?”
“Hello Winchester’s,” Castiel smiled politely. “We’re the Novak’s,” he motioned to his nine pups. They were unkempt, but they were happy none the less.
“As long as he adheres to the rules of this house Frank can stay here.” Dean gave Castiel a look before looking back at them. “You’re going to have enough on your plate without having to worry about housing. Especially if…” he shook his head. “I still can’t believe your mom.”
Amelia sniffed the clothes tentatively. “It’s not awful.” She took a deeper sniff. “It would make a better candle scent though. Why again do we have to smell like this?”
Castiel rumbled deep within his chest in rhythm with Dean making a tune all of their own, and nuzzled him.
“It got crazy but not that crazy!” Betty exclaimed defensively. Under the table out of the view of everyone else’s eyes she gave her friend’s hand a small squeeze.
Dean pulled his pups into his lap and hugged them both tight. “I love you both so, so much.”
“I was an officer before I was a detective. I’ve seen some crazy ass shit.”
Castiel distractedly took a sip of coffee. His focus was on the slight shift of Dean’s house robe. Better judgement told him there were boxers and a t-shirt under there, but the part of his brain that lived in the realm of fantasy supplied him with other thoughts. “I’m less than a day in under your roof and I’m impressed.”
“Any sex with you is mind blowing.”
“Guess I won’t have to worry about getting a boring tie for Christmas,” Castiel smirked. “So what’s on today’s agenda?” He asked as he reached for his coffee.
Dean admired the feral look about Castiel. There was his alpha. He tangled his fingers in his hair and kissed him. He couldn’t wait to get out of this water so that they could scent each other properly.
“I think the best one was when we all somehow thought to give each other vibrators and pocket sleeves as Christmas gifts.” Amelia laughed.
Dean and Castiel as straight faced as they could be exchanged looks. If you looked closely you could tell they wanted to laugh until their sides ached.
Dean’s eye grew the size of saucers. No mater how he pictured it, eight pups in a motor home equaled a circus. “You can’t raise a family in a motor home!” He huffed and crossed his arms.
“Can’t wait,” Dean purred and squeezed. He then took a step back, and winked playfully. He took a deep breath, and opened his bedroom door. Standing just inside he inhaled deeply. Thankfully it smelled nothing like the living room.
“I want to be a teacher.” Jack smiled. “Now that we’ve settled down I can apply for college.”
“If y’all are eating you best pick up that menu.” Dean gave his kids a look before smiling toward the waitress. “Sorry, we’ll need another minute. They were to busy talking about the movie we saw earlier.”
Dean shook his head and laughed.
“I think I owe myself and our waitress one as well.” Castiel grinned.
“Names Keith.” Keith fisted Deans jacket. It wasn’t a scent he was familiar with, but he welcomed it and the purr. After a few moments he calmed down considerably.
Sam was about to say something along the lines of his brother having never had a miscarriage when Eileen had come up to them.
Eileen held her hands up and shook her head. “Fours plenty,” she signed and laughed.
Castiel watched until the last of the pups was out of site before taking in more of the room. “There’s a plaque outside that says Fuzzy Tails Boarding House. You failed to mention you renovated a boarding house,” he said softly as he ran his fingers along the railing of the stairs. He took in the careful choice of wallpaper. The moment he’d stepped in the door he’d felt like he’d gone back a good hundred or so years. He knew the pups wouldn’t appreciate it, but he did. “Just this room alone is breathtaking. If the rest of the house is even half as amazing…”
“How many people do you think have-”
“I haven’t lost control like that since I popped my first knot,” Castiel mumbled against Dean’s sweaty back. There was a hit of embarrassment in his voice. He was still trying to catch his breath.
Claire blushed redder than a tomato from cheek to ear. “I was being polite.”
Suzy and Margaret exchanged looks before laughing.
“A pleasure,” Castiel held out of his hand.
They both laughed until they had tears in the corners of their eyes.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself.” Dean nuzzled into Catiel’s hair as he continued to work his shoulders and surrounding area. “This isn’t your typical household.” He placed a few kisses along his neck. “A gym does sound nice… or I could call in a few favors and we have some help in creating a natural obstacle course out back.”
“I did. That was the voice the mail.” John smirked when he saw his brother roll his eyes. “What. They don’t have a penis emoji.”
“Daddy can I help you with condom?” Kristian asked her dad with the biggest eyes possible. Because after all she was dads big helper. She’d been told as much.
“You okay?” Dean asked as he rested his forehead against Castiel’s
Kristina stood up on her chair and announced, “When I grow up I’m going to be just like Wonder Wonder. I’m going to save people and stuff.”
“You better not mess this up,” Kenny growled as he guided his mom toward Castiel.
“Two years ago my mate of many years decided she wanted to bed a much younger alpha. I would have stayed in the area, but she decided she didn’t want the responsibility of our pups.” Castiel unbuttoned the first couple buttons of his shirt and showed Dean a very faded scar of a bite. “I retired. Packed us up, and here we are… living in a motor home.”
Dean is 36. He had his first pups at 18.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My x was anything but traditional- I haven’t participated in a hunt and run in a while… but I’m sure it’s like riding a bicycle. It’s something you don’t forget. I can teach our alphas.”
“You owe me a drink after this,” Dean laughed, “a strong one.”
“If you catch a pup grows here,” Frank said as he rested his hands on a bump that was barely there.
Kristina rubbed the sleep from her eyes. “We didn’t do nothing bad,” she said with the innocence of a four year old. “Promise… we just missed mommy and daddy.”
The waitress along with three others came into the room carrying large, round trays heavy with food. They carefully went about setting up so that they could pass out the food accordingly. Hands went up when she said fish, then another set of hands for chicken, and then another for the steak. They did their best to make it easy for them.
“I’ve lost daddy?” He sniffed.
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
Dean tucked himself to avoid injury as he intentionally slid into the mud of the bank. He then headed along paths that wouldn’t leave tracks as long as he was light on his feet.
Dean returned the kiss and grinned. “Shit! We’re doing this!” He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding as he spun around. “Damn things been parked here for a couple weeks and this is the first time I’ve been in here.” He laughed. “I still can’t believe you talked me into this.”
“That’s the movies.” Amelia dramatically rolled her eyes.
“Margaret, Nikki have you two had any luck with that game on our phones?” Kenny asked curiously. The game had been there since their dad had passed away. It was full of puzzles and crazy hard. Most of the time they had to work together. A few times though someone would solve a level on their own and share.
“Yes ma’am. I’m sorry about that.” Betty’s politeness was nearly bordering on fake. She wanted his mom gone so she could have Frank to herself.
Dean pressed a finger to his lips and smiled.
“Maybe we should call Uncle Sammy for back up and start cooking Thanksgiving dinner now,” Kenny sighed. “I’d hate for everyone to show up and there to only be left over toast and bacon.”
Dean watched as their pups did a pass the baton style recounting of the evening. He couldn’t help but get the feeling that this was rehearsed. He mentally steeled himself for the proverbial shoe to drop. He leaned over and whispered to Castiel, “we’ll talk later about John. So,” he gave the boy sitting between Jack and Amelia a once over. “Frank why are you still here? Shouldn’t you be helping your mom at her apothecary shop.” He calmly munched on his bacon.
Dean pressed his back against Castiel’s chest, melting into the warmth of his alpha. His head naturally tilting to the side. “Yes. We’re going to have to get creative to accommodate our alpha pups…”
“I see you don’t have the same color as your brother,” Castiel smirked.
“You’re rubbing in their mistake.” Mary huffed.
“I’ve waited two weeks!”
Dean decided to just continue before his lost his nerve. “We’re gonna be a mated pair whether it’s later or sooner…” he looked up and caught his eye, “move in with us… now.” He wasn’t a total traditionalist, but even he knew this was a bit of the ‘cart before the horse’ so to speak. The rapidly forming lump in his throat of embarrassment made him squeak out the rest of what he wanted to say, “you… you… can’t share my bed… yet… until…” he gave up trying to say anything else. Knowing he was completely cherry red from cheek to ear he buried his face into Castiel’s armpit. He was 36 with eight pups, why was this so damn embarrassing!?
“She’s half way to fifteen and unmated-” Dean started to say before Bobby raised a hand to stop him.
Castiel cleared his throat. “We managed.”
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
“What is it Uncle Bobby? I got a plate of turkey calling my name before my nerves hit and I’m on my knees.” Dean laughed as he ran his fingers through his hair.
“When you said you wanted a large family…”
The red in Kenny’s eyes didn’t dull. He let out a deep growled, “no!”
“I’m sure things are bound to be said that aren’t pleasant given the situation,” Castiel grumbled.
Dean stared dumbly at Castiel. “Eight plus nine,” he stuttered as he pointlessly counted with his fingers.
In hopes of avoiding an awkward first in person meet up they’d let the pups use their cellphones outside of scheduled times to create a group chat. They figured it was the easiest and quickest way for them to get to know one another before officially meeting in person.
John scooped up Keith and spun him around. “Remember those condoms I showed you?”
Dean couldn’t smell Castiel’s unease, but he could sense it. Instinctively, he did what he’d do to calm his pups down and started to purr. “You’re son, Keith must have told you.”
“Yep. Just like when you were this high.” Twila motioned toward the floor.
“No. This is it.” Castiel said matter of factly.
“You mean before Frank eats us?”
“I’ll hand feed you if I have to…”
“If we spook the deer and dad fails we won’t have a new brother or sister.” Margaret said bluntly.
Mary shrugged her shoulders. “I’m with my twin on this. But,” she looked at mom. “If there’s something I’ve learned from you mom and from having so many siblings it’s that family is important. I’ll meet him. I don’t want him thinking he can parent me though.”
“I’m trusting you,” Kenny said evenly to Castiel, no hint of mirth or hostility. The ring of red in his eyes held promise though. Things had gotten easier between them in the past week, but they weren’t perfect.
“It’s simple. You kill the deer. You show you can provide for the family. If mom’s satisfied he’ll run.” Kenny waited for Castiel to nod before continuing. “I won’t say things between us are perfect, but mom… everyone… likes you, so I’ll tell you this- the one time dad used a gun mom flat out refused to run.” He paused for a moment when he saw him give him a look. “Just use your hands, a bow… whatever, make the kill clean and quick and be thankful. It’s a show of strength. Mom’s even told me something similar himself.”
Bobby nodded.
Kenny nodded in confirmation. “I really don’t care when we have to fend for ourselves. I just wish they’d give us a heads up.” He sighed.
“Yes. The height of the bed is the biggest give away. It’s just enough a mate’s ass would be angled just right. Also the head and foot board are a certain height and have certain dips that allow for easy grip for mating that takes place in bed.” He smirked. “If it was solely for sleeping you’d have four posters and curtains. But, this- you’d have to attach your curtains around the bed for privacy.”
Charlie wanted to scream yes the moment the offer had been proposed. Barely able to contain her excitement, she hoped from one foot to the other. She stopped bouncing as she watched as her mom headed to the kitchen. She frowned. She’s never been away from mom. While excited the idea was scary.
Dean stared at the water kettle on the stove from his seat. He swore in this last week and a half that his schedule was sleep and sleep. Anything done outside of sleep was done while sleeping- sleep eat, sleep raise the pups, sleep sex, etc…
“Awe man. No way. That’s total bullshit!” Dean kissed Castiel gently. “I can assure you your perforce is spectacular… and, your size is impressive.”
Kristina giggled and clapped because she was mommy’s big helper.
“Not unless I get amnesia and think you’re him. Or, maybe have a nightmare.” Dean looked Castiel in the eyes. “The kids don’t even know his name. They know him as dad… nothing more, nothing less.”
Dean stopped just outside the doorframe. Just in time to watch his son be hosed down. He wasn’t going to battle Castiel over this one. Kenny had blatantly disrespected him. If anything he was thankful for Castiel stepping it.
“Promise.” Keith nuzzled back.
“We weren’t dealing with kinder-pups.” Dean slid over to a different sink to get the chicken washed up. “Nothing… I repeat nothing… goes to plan when you take a pup under five.” He rolled his eyes. “Doesn’t matter how well behaved they are. It’s just like some unspoken rule of nature.”
Keith looked from John to Frank to Betty. “Okay.” He said his attention lost to the situation. He was more interested in having fun. “Spin me round again!” He giggled.
“One thing we learned on the road is that we’d rather have the best day than the best gift on our birthdays,” Suzy grinned.
I welcome opinions. I love to grow as a writer.
Dean bit his bottom lip as he debated on saying something. ‘To hell with it,’ he thought to himself. “This is shameful.” He paused for a moment and then looked at the pups he knew who had presented already, “Jack, Claire, Dawn, Twila please tell me you’ve got supplies in there. You too Amelia and Betty.” He refrained from snatching bags to check himself. And, for sake of some humility he kept it to a single word of supplies.
“Wow!” Castiel scrunched up his nose. “I think the only thing I don’t smell is orgy.” He left the door wide open and went to open the windows. “At least the house looks clean…” He had nothing to apologize for, but he gave Dean an apologetic look.
Dean pressed himself against Castiel. He didn’t like the idea of the master bedroom reveal being a surprise, much less being blindfolded to keep it that way. He tentatively sniffed Castiel’s chest, and relaxed. He had missed Castiel’s smell immensely the past few days.
Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Home.”
“Seasonal crafts and activities, pups coming home, a house showing…” Dean mumbled sleepily. “If you did this a month ago…” he sleepily turned to straddle Castiels lap. “Now I just wanna fall asleep in your arms.” He kissed him gently.
Keith held the spice bottle tight and smiled. “I’m big pup now!” He chirped.
“You’ll have to show me tomorrow. For now,” Castiel scooted Dean toward the kitchen, “you need to eat your dinner.”
Castiel stepped behind him, and wrapped his arms around him lovingly. “The end result is beautiful.”
“Shut the fudge up!” Charlie hissed. “You’ll scare the critters… like all of them.”
“Strength isn’t just about muscles… it’s about what you do with them.” Castiel tickled Keith just enough to get him giggling.
“If it wasn’t for needing this bed I absolutely wouldn’t object to a few days of uninterrupted debauchery,” Castiel laughed.
Dean looked the pup in the eyes. Didn’t his dad teach him about not talking to strangers? Maybe he had seen Kristina and felt them safe to talk to. Never mind that now. “Hold these for mommy,” he handed his daughter the spices.
“I don’t plan to raise them in a motor home.” Castiel chuckled. “We made the choice as a family to home school and road trip. As chaotic as it is, it’s been the best decision for us.”
“Betty started courting me her second day at school. I know she wants to go into the military and I support that.” Frank gave a shy smile toward Betty. “I’m going to finish school and find work.”
Dean nodded his head. “I use to think it silly being presented a big deer. Watching him preen at how proud he was to provide. The red in his eyes as he’d wait to see if I’d accept it and run.”
* I had a bit of fun writing this chapter. By the way chocolate covered tomatoes is really a thing. Go ahead and Google it. I haven’t tried them myself so don’t ask me how they taste. Haha.
Castiel frowned. He hadn’t meant to offend Dean. “I told you I hired the help to get it done quicker.” He pulled a badly wrapped, severely crumpled package from his pocket. He handed it to Kenny, “please.” He knew he wasn’t getting into the room without a scuffle, which he wanted to avoid.
Kenny went straight in the face, almost to the point of a frown. “Point taken.”
“Later!” Dean called out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Seventeen,” Donatello whistled.
“Dad never did anything like this with our old mom.” Twila noted.
“I think I’ve got it. 4 fish dinners, 10 steak dinners, and 5 chicken dinners. All with baked potatoes and side salads.” She smiled sweetly. “Ranch dressing for the salads. Butter and sour cream for the potatoes.”
Dean refrained from commenting how the color of the sheets didn’t mater- what mattered was how they felt. He headed toward the bed and climbed in. He crawled toward the center. He pulled it up toward his face and rubbed it against his cheek.
Mildly offended Kenny puffed up. However, he quickly deflated because he knew his sister was only teasing. “It’s really gross when you do that you know,” he grumbled. Secretly though, he really didn’t mind it.
“Yeah. So sit up straight. Puff that chest.” Betty grinned. “Strut that crap. Fake it until you make it.”
“Here we go dears. Salads. I assumed the youngest were sharing a meal so I brought one extra bowl.” The waitress smiled toward the two youngest pups.
The voice may have been deeper with age but Dean knew it. He’d already moved between his pup and the man at the door. He refrained from hissing. But he couldn’t stop his demeanor from being defensive. “Go and find your twin and wait in the study.”
Mary thrust her arms out and sang, “it’s about the eye candy!” She laughed as she gave her brother a look. “At least for him it is.”
“I know. I know I don’t have pups of my own. It’s why I’ve put this off for so long. I’ve got no one to pass the business along to.” Bobby frowned. “But, you know we’re solid. Nothing is going to happen to her.”
“They have to leave the room at some point. It’s Thanksgiving. Uncle Sammy and his family will be here. Arthur usually comes too.”
* Quick mentions of a hunt and kill of a buck. It’s nothing to graphic.
“Just because I have no shame doesn’t mean you’ll find me making porn videos for the world to watch.” John rolled his eyes. “I have standards!”
Dean absentmindedly hummed as he scrolled through the message board. His head was bobbing and his foot was tapping- it was apparent he was mentally listening to a song. He scratched down a list of tasks that needed to be done after school. “Morning sunshine.”
“How about I’m saying don’t rock the boat. No one here has had it easy.” Nathan held out his free arm to Kenny. “One mom. One dad.”
“Manners,” Dean chided.
“Pleasure’s mine. Please, please we are good as family,” Arthur shook Castiel’s hand before taking a seat, “Arthur.” He smiled. “I hope it’s not too forward of me to bring a guest,” he motioned to the door.
Dean glanced behind him and panicked when he didn’t see Castiel. He hesitated for a moment before doubling back. Part of him knew Castiel wouldn’t give up, but there was also the nagging part to make sure he was alright.
With Castiel’s hands occupied with groping and dipping fingers in Dean’s ass and Dean clawing and hanging on to him for dear life he had to do a number of things to get their cocks some attention. He angled, rocked, and rutted- none of it was enough.
“Yeah. Especially once he scent bonded with the pups and we started having our own.”
The waitress repeated as she quickly wrote down: three Lemonades, five  Sprite, one Mt Dew, six Sweet Teas, three Cokes, one Dr Pepper, and one Root Beer. “Sounds good.” She gave a large smile. “I’m going to put in your order for  fried pickles, cheese balls, and chips with salsa. I’ll be right back with your drinks.”
“Alright what’s the verdict Charlie.” Dean said as he munched on a piece of turkey. Already knowing her answer, he calmed his nerves while in the kitchen fixing his plate.
Sam punched Dean’s shoulder. “I need to get back. Get your shit together, and don’t be a stranger.” He got up and headed back toward the diner he owned.
“My dad dragged Sammy and I around. We practically lived in motels until he up and died. Then we ended up in the system for a bit. As soon as I could take care of Sammy and myself I did. Bobby and his mate Karen, friends of our dads kept in touch.”
“No. No. Nothing like that. Charlie just accepted Bobby’s offer to go and live with them. Bobby is going to finish showing her the ropes of being a mechanic and owning a business. Then when she turns eighteen the business is hers.”
“Next time I do hope to see the wolf out as a centerpiece at the dinner table.” Garth said on his way out. “It always gives an edge for conversation.
Castiel turned the kiss into something less chaste. He tugged Dean easily back into bed. “Dinner can be an hour late.” Once he felt him straddle he grabbed two fist fulls of his rear. “Fuck I swear my alpha wires are crossed or something.”
“A little over a year ago I met a wonderful lady. She got me to straighten up and get my act together. She’s got a pup a bit younger than ours. The alpha is a dead beat like me… it put a few things in perspective. There isn’t enough money or apologies to make the past right.” He sighed as he tucked his hands in his pockets. “I’m here because I’d really like the chance to do right by them going forward. I’m not saying that I deserve it, but I would like the chance.”
“Good thing I decided to get back in shape,” Castiel chuckled.
“He use to stand in that exact same spot and watch me… tell me several times a week how amazing I was that I could manage our family so flawlessly,” Dean said as he slid the decanter back onto its warmer. He sat down his iPhone and coffee, and grabbed a pair of pot holders. He purposely bent a little more than he had to as he pulled several trays of muffins out from the oven.
With the exception of a brief glance to see what he was holding, Castiel didn’t take his eyes off of Kenny.
However, it did have Castiel blushing. “That wouldn’t be appropriate to give you on a first date.” He coughed and cleared his throat. If you didn’t know better you’d almost think their rolls were reversed.
“I’d stop by daily for a nap in the study if I could, pure comfort.” Garth drew in a deep breath. “The meals are no less than perfect. Dean is an amazing omega.”
“I personally don’t mind if I’m gifted twenty dildos or similar.” John grinned devilishly.
They settled back in their seats. The cakes were cut by the respective owner and shared with by surrounding family.
* I’m sorry more kids didn’t get used during this chapter… this chapter is roughly 4K words.
“Afternoon Castiel,” Arthur said with a tip of his head toward the other alpha.
“Just don’t puke on us and we’ll all be okay.” Mary teased. “None of us have been pregnant but most of us have been through enough pregnancies to understand.” She winked.
Enough slick to coat them both from head to toe gushed from Dean. He wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck and nuzzled his face into his hair. After a few deep breaths he nipped him along the jaw and around his ear.
Dean rolled his eyes and nodded.
Alex rolled her eyes, “if we can take down a deer we can manage the house and each other.”
“I want to go! But I think I’m going to throw up.” Charlie wrapped her arms around her stomach.
“He’s a rich business man. He’d go large. Probably order half the damn menu.” Charlie laughed so hard she snorted.
Castiel watched as Dean, in nothing more than boxers, came from the bathroom to stand at the bed. He watched him turn and walk toward the front of the motor home. He did this at least twice more- nervousness seeping from the inside out. “Dean are you okay?” He asked when he’d come to stop at the bed once more.
“No one ever took advantage of him!” Alex shrugged.
Crowley nodded before stepping into the study.
John looked at Mary. “I guess I’ll meet him too. But, yeah… that’s it.”
“You aren’t in some sort of trouble are you?”
“Don’t say never. I doubt Frank had a life goal to eat chocolate covered tomatoes.” As Amelia laughed she picked up one of the Roma tomatoes. She glanced at her sister before nudging her. “I know you aren’t chicken.”
* In case you’re like me and need a cheat sheet. Haha
“Darth Vader… alpha or omega?” Charlie asked despite her mouth being full of fish.
Castiel started mouthing at the fabric where he’d soon claim Dean. Subconsciously his hands slipped to his hips and he started grinding himself against his ass. “We’re up to five.” He huffed, “it’s gonna be like a frat house for a hot minute.”
Castiel fell forward. He didn’t know how many times they rolled. What he did know is that on the last roll he was back on top. He grabbed Kenny’s neck, and pressed his knee into his chest. Chest heaving, clearly exhausted.
Castiel straightened himself to full height. He put his hands on Dean’s shoulders. He rumbled possessively. They hadn’t talked much of this alpha but they’d talked enough for him to know who this was.
“My condolences.”
Betty let out a small whine as she looked back at her dad. She grabbed Frank’s hand and pulled him from the room.
Kristina clapped her hands excitedly. “I’m going to be the best. Better than Harry Parker and Iron Land.”
“You don’t now?” Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“At least everyone had a good time.” Castiel snuffled along Dean’s neck. “You smell incredible.”
Charlie pried herself from her mom’s arms. “I’m going to go make my rounds.” She grinned.
“You’ve said it on multiple occasions we should be on a sitcom,” Castiel grinned. “But, I take it this isn’t about turning our lives into a reality tv show.”
“I’m pretty sure mom doesn’t. He thinks everything from dad has been settled.” Nikki paused to think for a minute. “We’re hoping that at the end of the game it’s a note or something from our dad. Like something he wanted us to figure out.”
“If preventing an unplanned pup takes me screaming condoms and birth control even when it’s awkward I will.” Dean grinned. “If it happens,” he paused just long enough to climb in, “I won’t look down on any of our pups for it.” He got quiet again as he waited for Castiel to climb in and close the door. “Hell I’ve been there and I’m lucky it all worked out.”
Dean’s grief was so thick not only could Castiel smell it, he could taste it. He reached out and took his hand in his. He rubbed soothing circles with his thumb. “I lost my first mate to child birth complications.” He said sympathetically. “It’s been over 18 years and feels like yesterday.”
Dean crossed his arms, “You also do not have enough things.”
“Takes one to know one” as if the room was full of people and Dean wanted to keep a secret between them, he leaned close and whispered into Castiel’s ear, “If we didn’t have a dinner guest coming in an hour I’d be begging for a knot.”
John glanced at Betty. “Alpha up Betty. All you gotta say is,” he paused and then mouthed out, “I knotted…” he hissed when he felt someone stomp his foot with theirs. “It’s her fault he’s here,” he spat angrily.
“I guess it’s not.” John shrugged his shoulders. “You’re way better at computer stuff than me.” He headed toward the dining room. “Come on let’s feed the pack before we get eaten ourselves.”
John shrugged, “I can dream.”
There wasn’t a square inch of the house that hadn’t been blanketed in a soft something or other and
The middle of October was setting in and it was a wonder that over the course of the past two weeks they’d gone without one blatant contest of who had the bigger ‘equipment’ in the living room or kitchen. There had been plenty of quips along the lines of ‘it’s not about size, it’s about how you use it’.
“What kinda question is that?” Nikki laughed. “Science against magic. Magic is going to win. It’s make believe.”
Dean bolted past Castiel heading toward the river.
“I know you’ve been touring the USA in a motor home so I’m assuming you’ve got a storage locker somewhere- right?” Dean asked curiously as he watched each of the nine pups walk in with no more than two average sized duffel bags worth of stuff. The younger clutching a comfort toy.
“Just the thought of chasing you is getting me riled up.” Castiel growled possessively, but playfully. He licked Dean’s lips. “I know it’s forward to ask because it gives me an advantage… but, how fast you can run?”
“I think we should turn taste testing weird pregnancy cravings into a tradition.” Twila grinned.
“I know. But.” Nathan huffed. “Kenny’s asking me a difficult question. I don’t want to answer it until we have someone like you in the room.”
Dean blushed under the praise. “It’s really not that hard… A handful are grown or almost grown.”
Castiel relaxed into the lull of his omegas purr. “Yes he did. Oh, and he said I had to give you this.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a bottle of spice. “He was very adamant about it and said he was a big helper.”
“I bet if we asked Ketch he’d let you check out the truck and sit in the seat.” Dean ruffled his hair and turned his own fork into a fire truck.
Claire smiled as she scooped up Keith, and with her free hand grabbed Jack’s, “come on.” The rest of the pups clambering the stairs behind them. It was a monkey see monkey do kinda procession.
“I can do that,” Castiel growled playfully as he scooped up Dean effortlessly. He ignored the earned shriek. He took four large steps towards the back, and dumped him on the bed.
Castiel anxiously watched Dean. Nothing else in this room mattered if he didn’t get this one particular thing right. He knew from last night how soft the sheets were. He’s purposely slept in them after washing them so that they would smell like him.
“I’d like that.” Kenny batted Castiel’s hands from his hair. “One more thing- it might can go without saying, but just in case… this deer you provide only needs to last long enough for you two to…” he didn’t want to finish the sentence. He looked at him and hoped he understood.
“Love you too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’d like that,” Dean said against Castiel’s lips. “We’ll need a few more pups.”
Eileen nodded.
“Knowing them that’s exactly when they’ll show up.” Kenny rolled his eyes.
“It goes on a penis.” Kristina chirped proudly. “Also makes pretty balloons.”
“I should slam the door in your face.”
Kenny couldn’t control the slight color in his cheeks. He looked away as he gritted his teeth. “Just don’t let me down or I’ll challenge you again.”
“Are you kidding me! You’re up before dawn- the coffee pot is full, you’ve already baked four trays of muffins, and,” he glanced at the note pad on the counter, and motioned to nothing in general, “you’ve already set up the schedule for the day.”
“Mister!”
“He was too drunk to realize that you smelled as good as you did because you were so close to heat.”
Castiel is 42. He had his first pups at 20.
Dean sat impatiently as he watched the eyes grow dark in the deer. He was both excited and terrified that someone might actually be able to truly catch him. If this was Castiel with resolve- what would he be like come undone?
Dean stood in the room with his head titled up. As if expecting to smell something vile he cautiously sniffed. Other than hints of Castiel, and himself the room didn’t smell like much of anything. Not much of anything was better than it smelling of a bunch of strangers. But, not having the familiar scent of the room made him feel out of place. He wanted to tell Castiel to take him to the living room, but he didn’t.
Castiel licked the sweat from Dean’s neck. His eyes rolled back, as he moaned. “I want to show you that you’re not loose by filling you up with every inch of my thick cock.” His hands tightened on his hips. “Knot you real good.” He was breathing so heavily it was hard to talk. “I want my pups in there like yesterday.” He growled possessively.
“Yes.” Dean cooed. “I’d like that very much.” Content. He could smell it on the both of them. And under it all, past the sex, was the scent of a very pleased alpha.  His earth when rain first hit scent amazing strong. It screamed of promises much like rain was water and water was life. This was his life. “You were wrong at the diner. The universe wasn’t laughing at us. It knew just what we needed.”
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed. “Whatever… I guess if it works it works… but I’m telling you now I am not subjecting myself and my eight pups to that kinda chaos.” He narrowed his eyes and hissed.
Castiel leaned into Dean like he was going to kiss him, but instead whispered in his ear, “I’m so glad they had a meeting room available.”
Dean grinned mischievously, even proudly. He’d actually been on several dates with Castiel and somehow the entire town didn’t know- that was shocking. “Only mixed reviews because we about choked when we had to use our fingers and toes to count pups.” He took a sip of his coffee. “Between the two of us we’ve got seventeen pups.”
“We don’t have an average amount of pups- separately and certainly not together.” Dean laughed. He breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth along Castiel’s neck and shoulder. The real comfort for him came when he felt him start to lick strips along his neck. “Thank you for understanding.”
“Do you think Tony Stark would order a 6 oz or an 8 oz?” Amelia asked curiously.
“Yes.” Castiel squeaked again. He was inwardly starting to wonder who was the omega here because his boxers were really in a bunch. Thinking of grandma had mentally helped to dial down the arousal so he wouldn’t smell it. He was thankful, he wasn’t an omega because he’d of been so slicked up he’d of had it running down to his ankles as this point and been begging for a knot. He inhaled deeply a couple of times. Thankfully, the scent of the pups helped to further ground him a bit back to reality. “I can’t. Not here.” He said pathetically when he saw Dean’s eyes giving him a once over.
