Sam stares at him for a long few seconds and then shakes his head. "I didn't know you were okay with me going, with all Dad said the night I first told you guys."
Castiel leads him to a sequestered spot, tucked carefully away behind a chunk of rock. There are tiny green plants growing up from the edge of a large shallow circle, filled with water that Dean would guess is only about five inches tall. There are old tree trunks, covered in salt and sand and grey-white barnacles that decided to stick around from their last voyage.
So that was how he found himself sitting in his primary doctor’s office. He’d stopped by a few days earlier for bloodwork and was here now for the results and an exam. His doctor, Tessa Reap, knocked on the door before entering. “Hello, Castiel. Haven’t seen you in a while. Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?”
Medical gaslighting is a common occurrence. It happens when health-care professionals downplay or blow off symptoms you know you're feeling, refuse to order appropriate tests, or try to convince you that your issues are caused by something else.
Dean looked genuinely concerned. His husband had such a big heart and tended to try to share other people’s burdens. “Oh, that sounds rough. I’m glad you have him. Is there any treatment for POTS?”
“What is the matter with you? You’ve been ignoring me all day. You even ignored my phone calls. I saw you look at your phone when it rang.” Dean chewed his lip and stared at the ground. “Did I do something? I know I’m bad at social cues—”
And Katie. I had always planned to add her in at the end and I'd always planned for her to have those two illnesses. I've had MD for eight years now and only met a handful of people with these two competing health problems. I kept musing how awful that would be and vowed to honor them with Katie. I wasn't counting on getting diagnosed with POTS also this summer. So, I unintentionally pulled a Vonnegut and wrote myself into the story. Fabulous.
Castiel’s eyes moved back to Dean’s before dropping to his feet. “No. No thank you. I have an early morning tomorrow and a few more things to do before I turn in.”
The New Year came and passed and life went on. Castiel stayed at home with the kids and put off job hunting until they had a better grasp of his health situation. He spent his days helping Patience with her schoolwork and playing with the twins. Ellen and Jo still came by nearly every day because they missed the kids after spending the last six months caring for them.
Dean fixed Cas some breakfast. After eating, he helped him put all of his ex’s clothes into trash bags and set them on the curb. Dean was all for burning them (honestly, who owned that many v-necks?) but Cas decided they’d look better with the rest of the garbage. They also did drag the mattress out and set the sheets on the back porch to burn with all the photos Cas had found of the two of them. The spent the rest of the day combing through the entire house and leaving anything Cas didn’t want in the growing pile by the curb.
“I dunno man. This dude named Cas keeps messing with me. This the same guy that shot me in the dick this morning.”
Was this guy for real? Did he just send an eco-friendly insult? Dean wasn’t sure if he should be annoyed or impressed.
Naturally, most of their family and friends came to celebrate Patience’s first birthday as part of the family. Gabriel brought another monstrously-sized cake while Benny volunteered for grill duty again with Jesse’s help. Garth showed up with another bunch of balloons and his sock puppet, Mr. Fizzles. The puppet critiqued the elaborate pictures Cesar was drawing on the patio in chalk while the children watched on; laughing whenever Cesar snapped at Mr. Fizzles. Jo was simultaneously flirting with and scaring Alfie with info from her criminal justice classes. Sam and Andrea sat near the firepit, deep in conversation. Apparently, someone tried to pass off a pet as a service dog and there was damage in one of the rooms of the hotel she managed. The woman was threatening to sue since the hotel demanded she pay for the repairs and Sam was throwing in his legal opinion. Meg was chatting with Balthazar and Castiel noticed her checking out his brother more than once while he bent over the table arranging the deserts. He wished those two would stop dancing around each other. Claire and Kevin’s parents were chatting with Ellen and Kelly while Bobby was stuck between Hannah and Anna. Bobby had let it slip how much he cared for Tori Spelling and now there was no escape as his cousins were also fans. Castiel smiled as he watched everyone’s interactions. He was used to their familiar gatherings and thrilled that their children fit into them so seamlessly.
All too soon, the music trailed off and the dance was over. The Russian walked around giving advice and correction to those who needed it. Jo didn’t need any. Of course she didn’t. His honorary sister was awesome. After a water break, they went through the dance once more. This time, Dean watched the teacher. The man had a presence. He exuded an air of power, but not in a negative way. He was firm, yet kind in his direction. He didn’t have to raise his voice to command respect from his students. His movements were graceful and Dean felt his eyes drawn to the man’s rear as he demonstrated a move that he noticed left several of the female dancers swooning as well.
Lisa chuckled and put her hand on him arm. “Typical daddy. Don’t worry so much. Kids get crushes. It’s nothing serious.” She glanced around and leaned in to whisper, “I’m just happy he’s interested in
“I’m never leaving our bed again Cas,” came the muffled reply from the head smashed into the pillow.
“Shh. It’s ok. First of all, she’s the oldest. She’s going to think like that anyway, especially after what they went through. Second, it doesn’t make you a bad father to accept help if she wants to give it.”
“I know we wanted to look around the city a bit, but I’m too tired. I think we should unpack and then relax for a little while. Maybe after a nap, we could go out?”
Dean met Cas’s eyes and the other man smiled warmly at him. Man up, Winchester! He cleared his throat, “Yea Cas. Let’s go. I could definitely use a drink.”
“This is only two milligrams. Very mild. You could probably give it to a chihuahua with no issue. It’s only to take during an attack; it calms the brain down and should stop the spinning.”
The girl grinned at him and left the room. Castiel slid to the floor and looked at Max. Still speaking in French, he addressed the boy. “Hey baby. Do you want me to play with you or maybe I can read you a book?”
have an early morning tomorrow and, well…” Castiel wouldn’t meet his eyes and his gaze darted around at nothing in particular as he struggled to get the words out. “It’s fine right now, but um… would you please try to keep the noise down after ten?” By the time he finished speaking, Castiel’s face was flushed a deep red and he was back to staring at his feet.
And suddenly time passes all too quickly; and the silence that covered the room like a thick blanket of snow on the rooftops is not silent enough. An alarm clock ticks mockingly from the bedside table. He wants to crush it in his hands, but they are too busy wrapped gently around Castiel's wrists, holding him close.
But Castiel does none of these things. He doesn't say a word. He looks at Dean for a few seconds and then nods, and then continues walking. And really, Dean should have expected that much. No reaction that Cas has given to what he says has been ordinary or like anybody else Dean had ever met; that was being proven time and time again to be part of the man's character.
"I don't want to go," Castiel admits quietly. "I want more than anything to stay. I like it here... But I think we both know that I have to."
"Why did I expect him to stay?" Dean mumbles. "I knew he was leaving. I told myself every night that he was going get on that freaking plane."
"Dean, we're gonna be fine, okay?" Sam says, and Dean wants more than anything to believe it. But that's the thing about half truths and easy lies—it prevents you from getting the security you need. Dean can't believe it will be fine, because he knows more than Sam does.
"Our love will just have to be ephemeral," Castiel says quietly, softening his expression into something much more lovely. It's fucking tragic. His blue eyes are full of bittersweet promise; and Dean is caught between thinking he never wants to see it again and wanting to look at Cas for years.
Castiel smiles again at him, and it makes his stomach do a silly loopy thing. "That sounds wonderful, Dean. Have a good night."
It's sweet, having that specific quality of seasonal food that always tastes great because it's exclusive. An ice-cream cone you get at the fair is bound to be more serotonin-inducing than one you get at the store, if for no other reason than it could be argued that ice-cream and other frozen treats were made for summer activities.
Dean realizes now that he had not been on a business trip, but at the casino. The more reflection he casts on to it, he realizes that Mary had probably known that too.
Dean struggles against the air for a moment and then his eyes flash open, awaking with another shaky gasp. His gaze is everywhere, traveling quickly around his surroundings until they finally meet Cas.
"Mills," Bobby says, stepping aside to let her in. "Thanks for coming. I don't think I told the boys I invited you over."
"Dad," Dean says tentatively, not stepping any closer to him. "I didn't know you were coming home today."
He pondered this for another silent hour, until there was disruption of a different sort coming from the front of the car.
"My father. I've told you how he runs a church," Castiel says slowly. Dean nods, so Castiel continues. "He wanted me to follow in his footsteps. But... Chuck has never been a role model of mine, and I had doubts, I think."
He looks enamored by what Dean was saying, which Dean figures makes sense. He doesn't like to talk about Mary often. He doesn't like to imagine her memory getting tainted with the way he tells it, with his clockwork brain turning each sludge-covered thought by gear.
Dean's smirk turns to an amused grin. The damned man was actually being coy with him, and if he was being honest, it wasn't a bad look on him. "I'll figure you out one day, Cas. Just wait, Sunshine. You'll see."
This is the moment where thoughts clear into view, where fear begins to burn where adrenaline once ruled. The storm has passed, the dust settles, and the villagers of the fated town now have to see the casualties the lightning has brought to their lovers. Castiel is leaving tomorrow. Dean will have to say goodbye, and he will learn to live without his angel.
Dean's heart quietly thuds against his chest, and he doesn't know what he looks like right now, but he knows that he feels the same warmth that comes from napping lazily under the bright solar light. A recharge of life, a feeling of such a serenity that you want to outreach your hand and grasp the clouds. It's the feeling of nostalgia, reminiscing on nicer memories in faded fixtures that make you feel at peace.
"Sam was going to take me home," Jess explains. "I have a quiz I need to study for first thing tomorrow. Tonight I just wanted to get out of the house and have fun, but duty calls, you know?"
Cas dumbly sits up, blinking at Dean as he returns to the present. He isn’t one for daydreaming, but it’s been more common lately, now that he has nicer things to daydream about. “Of course. Sorry, I was... thinking.”
Life had burnt his heart out like it was the last match, and burnt it to a stub. It felt nice to be held, was the only half-coherent thought he could think. It felt nice to be held.
"Yeah. Pretty," Dean says with a slow nod. "You should get some sleep. You were gone for what? A month?"
There's a tense silence at the table for just a few seconds, with nobody wanting to say anything that would escalate the situation into further awkwardness or conflict. Finally, Jess, who Dean is starting to believe when Sam describes her as an angel, speaks up with a polite question.
He picks up one of them and flips through it himself. A great deal of it is a dialect that he doesn't care to analyze, mainly because it all falls on a thin tightrope of a line that extends between manipulation and persuasion—Which seems more like a sewing thread than a rope.
Dean paused, and like a train wreck, he couldn't look away. His gaze had travelled to John now, and it was clear that the man's blood was beginning to boil. He put his slice of pizza back down on the paper plate, and he remembered thinking how fast it would take to step between the two of them, just in case. Just in case John didn't miss this time. Just in case Sammy didn't defend himself. Just in case John drank a little more than he admitted.
Dean frowns and leans his forehead on the other man's. He couldn't explain anything being said in his head. It was like all of his thoughts were stuck in time and mixed and matched and upside down and backwards, and all of the other contradictory phrases that make a brain hurt.
"Right," Dean huffs, shrugging off what the previous conversation was doing to his head. Cas is quite possibly the strangest person he's ever met, but it's the nicest change he's had in a while. His head isn't screwed on right; and he doesn't think he wants it that way.
"If I asked my father's church for donations, then I thought it might help with raising money for Sam," Castiel explains slowly. Something in his tone makes Dean's blood shift under his skin. He sounds weary, Dean decides. Too weary. Untrusting.
Castiel clears his throat and shifts on his feet. He's nervous, Dean supplies. He's uncomfortable. He's upset. And he's talking so damn slow.
"Oh. That." Bobby shrugs and puts his newspaper on the table. "I guess I never gave it any thought. Doesn't matter to me, you still may as well be my kid."
“And it made me... very happy.” The corner of his mouth can’t help but quick into a smile, and he looks down from Dean’s gaze. His eyes crinkle at the edges with glee.
As the sun was fading into a smear of dark indigo hues, a bonfire could be seen on a pile of wood at the sand, crackling and licking at the air with its flames. People gathered around it, already laughing as they passed around cheap alcoholic beverages.
"You shouldn't tell him," Sam says bluntly. "Not unless you've got some sort of sturdy backup plan in case things go south. Because you're right; I do know how he is."
"Most likely. Sam seemed very concentrated on getting the largest bear they had," Castiel answers the question as if it's with utmost thought and delicacy, his eyebrows creased with sincerity. "Why?"
For now, he's content with breathing in the peaceful quiet of things not going wrong for once. The other shoe may drop, but until then, Dean is happy. He's positively giddy, damn it. He doesn't want to think about what comes next.
Castiel's sleeping figure fades in and out of his mind. Despite the terror of thinking about what-ifs, the protective shield Dean creates for the people that he loves triumphs. Dean will not let his Dad hurt Castiel. If he can help it, he won't even let John have the pleasure of seeing the angel at all. He doesn't deserve to.
“It was a nightmare.” Dean grits the explanation out. His eyes are still wider than normal, which Castiel chalks up to him not being completely in the present yet.
"I'm tired," Dean states plainly, taking a seat at the table and glancing down at the papers Sam was looking at. He realizes with a sinking stone that they're all college pamphlets, and none of them are to Stanford.
Jody narrows her eyes at a spot in the water and points at it. "Alright, tell me what's wrong there."
"Dean," Castiel says with an even worse expression of guilt. "Don't leave yet. I can still call Gabriel. I'm sure they can figure something out without me."
-Scene where castiel forces dean to go collect seashells and hes so excited but dean is like "I literally see this all the time but you are very cute"
Dean sighs inwardly and fights a smile as he gets up to follow her. When they're far enough away from Castiel, Charlie nudges him in the ribs. "You sly dog! You started dating him and you didn't tell me!"
He remembers hazy lights, a faded glow of a dying street lamp in the dark. The sound of the ocean; always the sound of the ocean. There were two lovers dancing on the sand, laughing and jumping around in the dark. Dean remembers asking Mary why they were so happy, and he remembers her smile, bright, even when the dark of the night was blanketing the beach.
He figures that if he had lost the love of his life, he would keep something around like the ocean to remember them by, too.
"And what exactly have you done for me? My entire life, Dean has been the one to make the meals, help me on my homework—Hell, he drove me to my first date. You've never been there for me. Not when I needed it."
Sam scoffs and shakes his head. "Call it what it was, Bobby. He ditched us so many times for gamblingl that he barely would even be considered family, much less a dad."
There's an ugly silence for a few seconds, with Dean staring at his cold food, no longer hungry. The fork hits the plate with a clang as his hands go up to thread through his hair.
“I love you,” Cas breathes, and he feels lighter than he’s ever felt in his thousands-of-centuries-long life. He grins brightly and says it again, just to feel the shiver up his spine for a second time. “I love you, Dean Winchester.”
The sky has grown completely dark now, to the point where every firework in the city and then some were visible as they exploded loudly in the sky with big booms and screeching whistles. If earlier it smelled like smoke, then now it was a smoke factory.
"He's, uh... packing," Dean admits. His face falls. "Today's his last day. He's got a plane ticket back to Pontiac booked for later this afternoon."
Castiel falls completely silent, a splotchy blush over his face and spreading down his neck and the end of his nose. He shakes his head. "That's very kind, but I'm not exactly what 'the guys' find attractive."
Dean walks to the kitchen sink and turns on the faucet. As he watches the blood dilute into pink water and dribble down the drain, he can't help being reminded of the last time this happened. The fight with Eli. Cas was there for the aftermath of that one too.
Bobby looks up from his newspaper and puts his fork down. The eggs on his plate are nearly blackened but he was eating them without a care. "Sorry?"
Maybe it was. Maybe at the start of creation, Cas was already planned, like a flower in a garden getting ready for the springtime. He just had to be patient until he was around, and now that he finally was here, the sun needed to shine on him to make up for lost time. Cas was just a flower soaking up the sun, living and breathing nature like he was meant to do.
"I can speak about her however I damn well please," John argues, throwing his hand up. Dean thinks in a passing glance about how he almost looks unnatural without a bottle in his hand. "She was only your mom by obligation, Dean. She was my wife."
He must remember all of these things, he feels if he won't then he might die. His heart wreaks real grief now, and Castiel is still in his arms. He's still holding Dean's hand.
Castiel had succumbed finally to the heat of the California summer, stripped of the familiar tan overcoat to be replaced with tan skin under a white tank top. He looked beautiful, Dean thought.
Bobby answers the door and frowns at the sight of Dean. Distantly he can feel Castiel's hand on his shoulder, but it doesn't fully register as anything but pressure.
"Five days," Castiel murmurs. "That's when my flight has been booked. I... Dean, I don't want to go."
"My brother," Castiel says, hesitating slightly. Dean watches the calm mask of his falter and fades into an expression of stoic sincerity. "He took me on a road trip, when I expressed my concerns over not wanting to become a priest. But... when we got to California, he left me here with a note."
Dean gives a yawn and pours out coffee into a mug. "Yeah, yeah. I've got it. Do you have your homework?"
Cas instantly lights up, and he gets one of the softest yet exciting smiles that Dean has ever seen plastered on his face. "Yes."
“I needed you to know. This is more important to me than anything, Dean. I—I owe it to you. Especially after this.” Cas holds up the note. “I thought you felt the same way. And it’s really okay, if you don’t, truly, because this right here, this feeling of not keeping it from you anymore is the most amazing I’ve ever had, an—“
Castiel snores with his cheek pressed against Dean's bare chest. One arm is wrapped lazily over Dean's waist. He's been fast asleep since he hit the mattress—But Dean can't sleep.
He must remember blue eyes. Not a shade plucked from the sky, nor a drop from any ocean, more beautiful than each and all. Downturned and deep set, holding so much love for humanity, even the simplest sprinkle of dirt on the land.
Castiel gives him another unimpressed look, and Dean is starting to suspect that it's the only expression that can fit on his face. "I'm sure you have. We aren't a different species."
She looks back at Charlie and squeezes her hand again. "We never have to go surfing again, okay? Never again."
Dean imagines for a second what would happen if he did get kicked out. He was twenty-one, and he already knew that he could handle living on his own when it comes to financials. Plus, Bobby is always an option if he needs an emergency place to crash. He also knows that John's gambling addiction wouldn't just suddenly halt if Dean was kicked out, and that the only person really living in the house would be Sam. Sam isn't even out of highschool, and the thought of forcing Sam to suddenly and all at once be responsible for himself and all of John's shit just because Dean got himself kicked out is something he knows isn't viable.
The lady giggles again, and Damn, the sound is starting to get on Dean's nerves. Not that it was the girl's fault, of course. Sometimes a person's laugh was something you had to grow to love. Dean wouldn't find out either way, considering the number he gave to her was purposely messed up by a number or two.
Dean sits in silence. His head is a blank slate, and he debates getting a drink before going to work. But alas, the clock signals that five minutes have already passed, and he's about to be late, so he stands up and walks down to the beach.
"I don't want you to go either." Dean counts the stress lines in Castiel's young face. "But you're right, I know that."
His muscles tighten, thinking of the bitter stench of alcohol, the painful flinch before a punch, harsh words that grate against his ears in an uncomfortable dissonance. He blinks rapidly and shakes his head. "Yeah, y'know, just stupid fights. It doesn't matter."
Castiel knew all there was to know about John Winchester, but to think he could cause such alarm and disquietude in what is supposed to be fulfilling rest for his partner makes his blood boil to a dangerous heat.
Dean grimaces. His ribs still hurt like hell lived in the marrow of his bones, and his face felt like he had been run over by a cement truck. He had taken pain medicine before coming over here. "Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm fine. It's healing."
Cas looks down at the scattered books across the library table and nods grimly. “Yes, I can do that.”
And with that, Castiel walks into the hotel. The door closes behind him, and Dean starts the walk back home with a very particular feeling bubbling in the pit of his stomach.
"Need someone to spot you? I'd be more than happy too. After my shift, of course," Dean smiles something sly.
"Your dad got in a crash yesterday," Bobby finally says. "I got the call 'cause I'm first on the emergency contacts if anything happens while any one of you two boys are a minor, and since Sam is still seventeen..."
"Shut it, I'm not finished." Bobby sighs. "I'll take out about seven grand. That ain't covering much of it, but it should do a hell lot of a bigger dent then what that lifeguard wage will do. Now, you can't be complaining about any of this, okay? I'm glad you asked for help. I'm real glad."
The truth is that Dean hasn't fully figured him out, not really. Not nearly as much as Castiel had figured out about him. It's as if with one look at Dean and he had seen directly through his soul and knew everything about him. But Dean has never been very good at reading emotions. He instead reads in the multiple colours of intensity, which Castiel doesn't have many of.
As for Cas himself, well, the man was interesting enough. He had a strange way of talking and interacting, but that made him all the more entertaining and Dean wouldn't mind spending more time with him. Dean glanced over at him as he thought.
Except in this particular case, the sunglasses would be—Well, what would they be? It should all trace back to that funny little word that Charlie said the other night; and yet that didn't seem quite right. It didn't fit correctly into Dean's head, and he knows himself well enough to know that if it doesn't seem to fit in his head, it isn't meant to be for now.
"Well, the brother who abandoned me in a different state would be Gabriel, but I come from a very large... dysfunctional family," Castiel says carefully. "I have several older siblings, many cousins, and an Aunt who I've never met."
A red blush blooms on Castiel's cheeks and the end of his nose, and Dean blinks repeatedly because of it. Castiel shakes his head. "Thank you two, that's very kind. I'm glad you're okay, Dean."
Dean blinks a few times, his coffee going forgotten as he stares at the ocean move. Despite how loud the water was, it couldn't clear out his thoughts.
His bedroom door splits open before he can do anything rash. Dean figures, somewhere in his disconnection of head and body, that it must be Castiel. It seems like no increment of time passes before he's gently holding Dean's hands, bringing them up to his frowning lips and kissing each one of his knuckles gently. He murmurs words onto them, healing the invisible wounds that are stitched across them.
(Castiel's hand had been on his shoulder. There's broken glass in the trash can beside the fridge. John had a glazed look in his eyes, it happens when he's drunk. There was a sway in his step, there always is. There are heavy footsteps. Castiel's eyes are so blue when he looks at him, incandescence swirling in oceans. He's climbing out the window. He couldn't feel his hands but they were dripping blood. John's car pulls up to the driveway. The sunflowers wilt in his presence. In steps the heavy boots. Cas's hand is on his shoulder.)
He spoke like his throat was trying to balance gravel between each syllable. Not to mention how he sounded right out of a prayer hotline commercial. Dean turns to look at the man.
Dean looks down from Bobby's gaze, which ultimately gives the answer that he didn't want to vocalize.
“Please what?” Castiel responds, his face still drawn in a strained confusion. “Dean, what’s wrong?”
Dean sighs. He winces a little, swallowing the gut feeling that this conversation is about to crash and burn. "Do you know, like, burgers?"
Castiel questions him all the way over to the vending machine, but Dean only answers with "drinks". They aren't alcoholic, but the heavy thud of the Coca Cola bottles rolling down the metal after Dean puts the quarters in is just as satisfying.
Dean steps onto the sand and drops the sodas next to a foldout table someone had set up. "Hey, Sammy. What'd I miss?"
Working as a trainee lifeguard was just going to be a summer job. The plan was that Dean would work for a few months, just to rack up some more cash for Sammy to go study at Stanford, and then he would quit and go do something he'd rather waste his time with. Messing with car engines always sounded fun.
“It did help me in the long haul though, I guess. I would’ve died all over again last year if I hadn’t listened to him.” Dean says this with a joking tone, supposedly fed up with the ‘chick-flick moment’ as he calls it. “Then you would’ve had to pull me out again.”
"You can," Castiel insists. It almost sounds like he's pleading, begging to keep Dean safe and in his arms. Dean brushes the thought away with the sickening shame of feeling clingy, because he truly does want that sort of protection, but now isn't the time. Not when he needs to take care of things. "We'll figure this out together. I can assure your safety there. Please, let me help."
That sends a shock wave of anger straight through his rib cage, vibrating each nerve and boiling his blood before he can even have a chance to calm down.
Since then, Dean practically raised him, and he hopes now, watching Sam dance around happily, that he did somewhat of a good job honouring his promise. Between the long nights he stayed up making school sandwiches or waking up early to make breakfast and walk Sam to class, between halting drinking, between working hours in the sun and sea, between a mason jar full of dimes and checks. Between all of it.
There were the usual lovers, this time it looked like a bunch of teenagers grouped into twos, and they litter the land with their lovesick expressions and cutesy words. Dean fights the urge to almost laugh. These relationships would last a week at least, maybe three if the girl was lucky. He's played the game before. Hell, he still plays, when he's got the time.
And he wants to go to college. He wants to help people. He wants to do good in the world, and he wants to use his brains in an environment to help him really go far in life, farther than Dean ever will or ever had the chance to go—and Dean can't raise enough funds for him to do it.
Dean remembers that night; How John had forced and manipulated words from his mouth like a puppet on a string. He turned Dean against Sam. The one line Dean promised himself he never would cross, and that night John pushed him over it.
"Right, Sir." Dean cleared his throat and avoided Sam's eyes. "To be honest—Sammy, I don't want you to go. I mean—Come on, a lawyer? That's lame, dude."
Yes, that is what it was. It was a whimper, which with no doubt belonged to the blond haired man in the front seat. A whimper that sounded much like a mewl; a weak and desperate cry from a man that was barely a man, and that was much closer to a boy.
Dean doesn't respond, moving around peas with a plastic fork. He keeps his jaw clenched and just sort of nods.
Not that Castiel thought that the time mattered too much. After all, it wasn’t such an unreasonably early time, and this has been playing in his thoughts for the past few hours since he got the note.
It's a two story house, but it's small. Pale blue exterior, white accents, and a fancy porch with the most clean front steps Dean has ever seen. Red rose bushes paved around the perimeter, along with an assortment of neatly trimmed hedges. It was always the nicest houses that held the most ghosts inside.
Dean's face grows warm and he stares Castiel down. If a flirting battle is what he wants, a flirting battle is what he is going to get. "And what about you? What makes your cheeks go pink, Cas? Surely it's something. You can't always be that cool."
Castiel's lips twitch into a frown, looking painful as he musters the next few words out of his mouth. "It means transient. Lasting a short while."
"If you are a youth in the plan or process of running away, these phone lines will help you get to a safe place. For only a quarter, these phones can be found in train stations, outside of bus stops," the voice on the television calls, the PSA interrupting the Sunday cartoons that Dean had been watching.
Dean could've lied, of course, easily. He could've told her that she was different than most girls he dated—which was true, but not the point he would be going for in this scenario— but Dean knew that she would tell if he lied. So he told her no, that he didn't think so, that he wondered sometimes if love even existed at all.
But silence is telling, especially coming from somebody who runs their mouth under stress, and Dean can see how Sam's eyes twitch into a squint for only half a second before returning to his normal expression. Sam knows something is up.
"I don't see why that matters, but sure, yeah." Dean shrugs it off casually. Charlie is a good friend, nicer than any friends Dean picked up in high school, but he isn't used to just telling his entire life to anybody.
"Well, you'll figure it out. You'll get to that preppy school, you're smart," Dean argues. He leaves out the part about the mason jar, or about Bobby, or about the summer job.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to explain to this man that he had trouble making connections with people. It was one of his biggest insecurities. “I have my neighbor, Missouri. She’s watched Claire for me before.”
Gabriel stopped as Ellen shouted from behind them. Castiel finally wiggled free of his brother’s grasp and turned to face the older woman. She stood slack-jawed, holding a large bag which he assumed contained their dinner. Her eyes teared up and she swallowed thickly before speaking. “Were you two finally approved?”
Castiel yanked Dean to his feet and pulled him into a bruising kiss. He felt his husband’s hard length against his thigh and rearranged them until their cocks slotted together. They rutted for a while as their hands roamed each other’s bodies and they traded frenzied kisses. Castiel’s hand moved over Dean’s ass and one of his fingers brushed over his entrance. He applied gentle pressure and was surprised when his finger slid in easily. Dean gasped and Castiel recognized the familiar feel of lubricant. He pulled back and arched a brow at his husband. “Dean? Did you get started without me?”
However, Dean was furious over the treatment Castiel had received at the ENT’s office. He had even called Sam to see if he could sue them but Castiel finally convinced him it wasn’t worth it.
“Just to cover all our bases, I’d like you to try this migraine medication for the next two months. Sometimes, you can have a migraine without the pain, but still have the other symptoms. I don’t think that’s what wrong since the symptoms you have fit migraines less than Meniere’s, but you may have an atypical presentation. Is that ok?”
“That’s Lisa. Anyway, school shut her down pretty quick. I doubt they’d listen to anything she’d have to say about you.” Dean gave him a small smile. Castiel noticed the little crow’s feet next to his green eyes and the freckles sprinkled across his nose.
“Well… I mean you guys have so much in common with your bees and everything and he stares at you all the time and makes you laugh…” Dean swallowed before continuing. “He’d be a lucky guy to get a catch like you, Cas.”
Alicia screamed again as she ran from Jack. The boy had several water balloons in his arms and was chasing her around the yard. Alicia was soaked and Castiel could see the mud covering her dress from his spot on the patio. Her braids whipped around her head as she ran before she changed course and tackled Jack to the ground. Alicia was still as wild as ever. His daughter had an insatiable thirst for life and was always on the move. She’d been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but she didn’t let any of that stop her. The determined little girl worked very hard to keep her grades up in school and grew to love reading. She was still a social butterfly and nearly twenty of her classmates had shown up to the party and she was close to every one of them. Alicia had also grown fascinated with engines and loved to visit the shop with Dean to learn about cars.
Dean smirked. “We did what we do. Gave that store so much business they went from a tiny, one room shop to a thriving business. They’ve got five or six locations now. Nobody tells New Orleanians what to do.”
They walked towards the exit together. “Don’t worry, I won’t out ya. No one would mind though. You know that, right?”
Castiel sagged a little in relief. “Oh, good. Um, good. Well, thank you and, uh, it was nice meeting you, Dean.”
Cas just stared at him. His eyes slowly narrowed and his head tilted a bit. He chewed on his lip before speaking, “You want to be boyfriends?”
“If you had told them your symptoms, they would not have scheduled you with him. Ask for his son next time. I promise, he’s completely different.”
Castiel grabbed Dean’s hand. “I understand now Dean. It’s ok. We all have things we cling to. Mine is my photography. Yours is football.”
Meg and Balthazar looked scandalized. “No, that won’t do. You don’t just tell someone something like that with a phone call.”
Castiel looked through the paperwork. There were two printed articles and three pamphlets on the effects of stress and anxiety with only one sheet containing the other specialists’ information. Was this what took so long? Did she print this up especially for him? And why did she keep insisting stress was the problem? Now irritated for an entirely different reason, he left the office as quickly as he could.
Castiel grabbed the mug Dean left out for him and started to make his own coffee. “Like the dead. I am
Cas slipped the envelope into his lockbox. “Thank you, Dean. I need some more apples and blueberries as well for the flavored honeys.”
“That’s for interrupting my practice, asshole.” She spoke through clenched teeth. “And you’ll get another if you make fun of me.”
Dean startled a bit and placed a hand over Castiel’s. “Sorry. We just thought it would be a few days. Yes, please. We’d like that very much.”
,” he bit out the word, “doesn’t affect your job performance. Don’t worry, I’ll be glad to pick up the slack while you’re gone.”
The meeting lasted about an hour. Castiel was introduced to everyone and he told his diagnosis story. Some people commented on how their experiences were similar. Then a few people talked about how their treatments were going. One woman was recovering from a decompression surgery and there was a man who’d just gotten a cochlear implant and this was his first meeting since it had been turned on. Topics then ranged from new treatments being tried in other countries to diet and supplement options.
Four months after returning from Brazil, it was early October. Castiel, Dean and the children had spent their Saturday at the costume store picking out the kids’ Halloween costumes. Patience chose a fairy, Alicia wanted to be a witch, and Max picked one of the characters from his favorite show: PJ Masks.
Castiel tried to wrap his mind around what he was hearing. “So, secondary hydrops symptoms are a result of outside forces causing damage and Meniere’s causes damage which then leads to the symptoms?”
“He’s sure somethin’.” Dean just realized what a golden opportunity he’d stumbled across. “Lookin forward to riding him like a bronco.”
He was so caught up in his self-flagellation as he walked to the cluster mailbox down the street that he didn’t notice Naomi standing there until it was too late.
Sam raises an eyebrow. "I think he's a good guy. A nice friend, even if he's a little awkward at times. Why?"
He does look beautiful, Dean thinks with a smile, so in a poor moment of thought coordination, that's exactly what he replies.
Dean is still awkward about this, still clumsy while sweet, so he goes to put his hand on Castiel's cheek and pulls it away. "Can— May I—?"
He doesn’t quite know what he writes. The letters blur on the page, probably due to the angry tears threatening to spill from his eyes. Castiel inhales deeply and puts the pen down.
Dean’s chest tightens and he freezes up, staring down at the writing as his brain tries to frantically process a multitude of different thoughts. He can feel the buzz of whatever he drank before wear off, leaving him alone with the stressful rapidness of his heartbeat.
"I'm listening," Castiel says, his eyebrows furrowed as he looks at Dean with worry. "Are you alright? You seem... intoxicated."
He puts the bags down on the table and looks over at Dean, and that's when he pauses and his face switches to concern in an instant. Dean would have laughed if he didn't feel so empty.
"Yeah, I guess you're not wrong," Dean says, laughing at the lack of subtlety, which helps the way his chest momentarily stops over the word boyfriend. "What's your brother's name, Cas?"
"Because of some tourist, okay?" Dean continues, flustered. "He pulled me out of the water and gave me CPR."
He must remember all of these things, he feels if he won't then he might die. His heart wreaks with grief, and Castiel is still in his arms. He's still holding Dean's hand, and he's still letting his shoulder be used as a pillow.
John, on the other hand, inhaled deeply. He had a controlled rage now, which was almost worse than his drunken rages. He knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what he said.
"His douchebag son tried to fuckin' kill me, that's what," Dean flares. "He knocked me out and tossed me into the water."
Time stills as every word dies on Dean's lips. Every thought in his head is replaced with choked gasps and painful silence. He bites his tongue hard enough to taste iron, bile rises in his throat. He wasn't supposed to say he, he wasn't supposed to say he, he wasn't supposed to say--.
Dean flinches for the first time that morning, knowing with a sick feeling that John was talking about Mary. He feels a hand on the small of his back, strong and comforting. Cas. He wonders how Cas looks right now; if he's looking at John with the same intimidating judgement, the one he gave Eli, where he tilts his head and squints and makes whoever is on the receiving side of the stare become caught up in their own head. Maybe Cas was looking at Dean himself, giving him a soft expression full of deep worry and stern protection. Either way, it gives him the strength to stand back up straight. He would not cower now.
"Why not, huh? You got everything you could possibly ask for in Pontiac. Here, all you have is a cheap hotel room and what, me?" Dean scoffs. "I don't want you to go either, but Cas, I nearly got you killed today. Whatever you think I've got, I'm not worth it."
That wasn't all. It was never all. But Mary had a habit of biting her tongue and speaking through her teeth around John in an attempt to get him to stay. Or so John had told Dean multiple times after Mary had passed.
"An Eli Styne?" Dean asks, his stomach dropping. Eli was just a kid. He may have made some real shitty mistakes, but it wasn't his fault just as much as it wasn't Dean's fault for being so angry. (There was blood splattered on the ground from where Eli had spit through his sobs. Fucking monster, Dean thinks of himself, and Eli was just a kid. His knuckles may have bruised harder than ever that night.)
One night as they sat with a box of pizza on their laps and a movie playing on the projector in front of them, Cassie asked him if he'd ever been in love.
"It's tomorrow, actually. I'll pay for your tickets," Dean smiles back. He thinks that it's the first genuine smile he's had today. "Figured it's the least I can do, since you're paying for your pricey tourist hotel."
"If Dad won't help me get to Stanford, I'll still need some form of education to be a lawyer. I thought one of these would work," Sam explains.
"Like hell I can't," John bit. "I raised you, Samuel. You're mine. I'm not paying for that pretentious stuck up little law school just so you can walk into a fancy building and pretend that you're a hero."
"They keep the world turning, helping everyone in their path have a better life, when in their brain they only think that they're following their orders," Castiel admits. "I think that's what you're like. You don't realize how much you help other people. You just think you're following orders."
"'Course," Dean nods, letting a warm blush come across his face that was most certainly not caused by the heat of the sunlight. He shrugs it off and clears his throat, instead turning his gaze to the group. "We should play arcade games, or something."
And like a feather of an angel's wing, settling on the air before a hurricane strikes, Castiel remains asleep on his chest. Dean exhales slowly and slips away from his arms, quickly pulling on a shirt and leaving the bedroom, closing the door behind him.
"Don't give him any credit. You put in the hard work and effort when he didn't, all he did was die." Bobby shakes him off. "How about Castiel? Where'd he go?"
Dean looks back up at him, looking almost guilty before he takes the note from his hand. He raises an eyebrow at the writing. “I don’t write in—This is Enochian, right?”
One would think that having worn the trenchcoat for every occurrence before, to be without it would make Castiel look vulnerable and weak, like a thin soldier without his armour. But Cas doesn't look like that at all, Dean thinks. He looks just as awkwardly proud and selfless, even if he was lacking a prominent layer.
"Sam, shut the fuck up." Dean stands up. For once, the fire in his chest is used for something he truly believes in. "You're taking that damn cash and you're going the fuck to college. You deserve that much."
"Bi—" Dean's attention is dragged away immediately as Castiel sits next to him. He gives Castiel a softer smile and hands him a bottle of coke. "Hey, Cas. Glad you could join us."
Castiel walks up beside them, his hands lacking a sparkler because he had disposed of it in the bucket. "Hello, Charlie," he says pleasantly.
With John's words on his mind already, he can't help but think about the many times that the angry bitter man yelled about how the real heroes were the ones who fought. He had said that the real heroes were the ones who wore uniforms, and that they carried a gun and followed orders, no matter how dangerous or deadly to them or others around them. He had also said, on one particularly memorable occasion, that one could only feel like a hero after they had been killed in righteous blood.
Rationally, he has to know that he isn't angry at Cas. He's angry that he finally let himself have something, that he thought he was growing, he thought he might even find a way out of the life he had been carved out to have; stuck taking care of a ghost's house and working his ass off to get this kid to school.
He looks hot, too, relieved with the breath of air against a thinner layer of clothes. Dean looks at him for a long while, probably too long, but the sun is shining on Castiel's skin now and Dean can't stop thinking about if he would tan or burn.
“ass, yur eys lik ocean see with blur, yoe eat burger like me, salad without Sam, love yu, pleas giv me kitsgh -sined Dean”
"I don't know what to believe," Dean speaks up after a long stretch of silence. "Just that my Mom is in Heaven. That's all that matters to me."
Dean stares at him, his mind stopping its race around a singular 1-lap track. (He is responsible for Sam. He needs to keep Sam safe. He is responsible for Sam. Look out for your little brother, Dean. I love you. Blue eyes. He is responsible for Sam.)
They walk into the line for the ride together, and it doesn't take long until they're seated alone in a small cart that is steadily traveling up to the sky. As soon as they reach the top, Castiel sucks in a quiet gasp as he stares at the view of the town. Dean understands the feeling, but sometimes he forgets how truly beautiful the place is.
"Well, that was lucky," Bobby scoffs. "Too damn close if you ask me. Do I get to thank him for saving your dumb ass?"
Dean leaves Castiel's motel room with a new threshold of thoughts, but this time many of them are as light as an angel's feather. Excitement wells up for the thought of a tomorrow; something that hasn't happened in years. He's nearly forgotten the feeling. Maybe Sam was right. He could use a friend. It's nice to have a friend.
Dean's stomach lurches. He doesn't move, going completely still and staring at Cas until he hangs up. The phone hits the receiver with the clunking sound of plastic against plastic, and Dean remains silent until he can't anymore.
After a second too long of them staring at each other, Dean shakes his head. "You're one weird guy, Castiel."
Castiel chooses to get a slice of pizza with some influence from Dean, and they check out. Dean mutters something about the cost being "too damn expensive for just some sunscreen."
Dean frowns and stands up with the intention of going over talking to him, but a hand on his arm drags his attention away.
Dean watches with a faint disgust as Jess feeds ketchup fries into Sam's mouth, and drags his eyes back to Castiel again. "Yeah, that's cool."
Cas must have been there for several hours, smiling at the ceiling while lost in his own hedgemaze of a brain, because when he finally sat up again to go talk to Dean, the clock read that it was morning.
"It was that kid again. Eli. The punk who nearly drowned me with his dad." Dean sits his tongue on the top of his mouth and looks down, the guilt growing worse. "I may have thrown a punch one too many, Cas. I feel like shit about it."
Dean sweeps up the pamphlets from the table and drags the metal trash can over with his foot. The stack of papers makes a satisfying thud as it hits the bottom of the bin.
Dean frowns and pokes his head through the alleyway, more curious than anything else. Though, he'd be lying if he said that something protective didn't swell in his chest at the thought of some random guy who didn't deserve to be beat up.
"Of course he doesn't hate you." Castiel's eyes crinkle at the edges— Cas is happy for him. He's giving Dean a small smile, but one that fits beautifully on his face. He just looks so damn fond. "I'm proud of you too."
Only a week or so into the summer, with only about two months to go, and Dean knew that he would have to really work his ass off. But that was later. For now, he just wanted a cold shower of fresh water and sunscreen to soothe the burns. It was nasty business, being a lifeguard. Dean didn't know he signed up for an entire summer of dry, peeling skin, bright irritated red rather than his usual golden tone. He'd have to ask Jody for some of her tips some day.
"Bobby..." Dean shakes his head. There's a lump in the back of his throat undoubtedly, but he's not going to cry. Even though his entire chest is swelling with gratitude, he won't dare shed a tear. He's going to take this money and he's going to get Sam to college to make the both of them proud. "There aren't words."
An image of an empty mason jar flashes in his mind. Sammy's determined face when he told John he wanted to be a lawyer that night. The late bills sitting on the kitchen counter.
The punch that is thrown knocks Dean back, and he crashes into the first aid stand behind him. The hit was incredibly unfortunate, and he can already hear his ears ringing due to the fact that his head was slammed against the wood.
He hesitates, staring back at him, and then sighs. "Nothing. There are a lot of things I'm thinking about, Cas. Things I've... never thought about before."
The fire screams louder in his chest. It's desperate to reach out to Cas. Since when has Dean been so afraid all the time? Surely it hasn't always been like this. It isn't fair to be angry at Castiel. He knows this. He feels trapped in the flames— he just wants out. He wants those ocean blue eyes to drown him and save him all over again, to save him from the hell he built around himself, but that isn't fair to Cas either.
"Why is there a bunch of broken glass in the trash?" John frowns disapprovingly, looking into the bin while he lifts up the lid.
"What about you then, Dean?" Castiel tilts his head to the side, looking at him curiously. "What's your secret?"
Dean stops mid-sentence and looks at Castiel with bewilderment. (Later, he would describe the blue-eyed enigma as having this extraordinary quality of getting Dean to talk without knowing it, just by batting those long eyelashes and talking with that deep voice of his. And Dean would respond with whatever he needed to get off his chest. Always.)
Dean smiles slightly, huffing a laugh under his breath. "That's probably because I never told you my address, Cas."
Castiel makes no move. He does not speak. He only watches Dean with a carefully trained eye, and listens.
Mary hugged him with the utmost of tenderness, wrapped her arms around John's waist and loved freely with no fear. She had kissed John with her hands carefully placed on his cheek, as if he had been a delicate thing that could be swept away if the breeze got too drifty.
Sam could see it now; and he didn’t like it one bit. Further more, he knows for a fact that if he doesn’t like it, Dean would hate to see him like this. Whatever the reason Cas had for hiding this, it couldn’t have been worth it.
Dean stares at him blankly. He thought this was a good idea, yesterday. Castiel had agreed with him, bless his soul, always being so damn supportive and loving all the time. But it seemed daunting now, to tell Sam that he was... that he liked boys, too. Why did it matter to tell him anyways? He could keep this secret, covered under his ribs and held close to his heart, where nobody could see it but him and Cas.
The fire in his chest explodes. Dean's vision whites out as he picks the jar up and slams it into the hardwood floor of his room. Pieces of shattered glass fly everywhere, and the coins that were tucked into the paper bill have spindled out onto the ground, twirling and spinning until they finally land to one side.
"Fuck." The words choke their way out of Dean's throat; a strangled and desperate sound that he can no longer help. He buries his forehead into Castiel's shoulder. "Cas. You can't just— Fuck."
"I'm keeping the peace," Dean explains shortly. "That's all, sir. I don't know what he told you, but—"
They order their frozen treats, Sam and Jess splitting a chocolate ice-cream cone while Dean gets rocky road. Castiel spends a good minute or so looking at all of the flavors while also watching them scoop cones for people in the back of the stall, but finally decides to get vanilla.
"You're so disgusting," Charlie fires back, but Dean hears the twinge of fear bending her words. "And tiny. Geez, how old are you, twelve?"
"You can come with me," Castiel says firmly. "Come back with me to Pontiac. The church can support you and Sam, you can stay with us. With me."
Castiel laughs quietly and takes Dean's hand, standing up himself. They join Sam and Jess in the sand, dancing to the pop music and the roaring noise from the sky. Once again he feels the lightness of his chest, and the heavy, healthy fullness of his heart.
For a while after Sam was born, his small body bundled up beside little four year old Dean while he slept, when John was nowhere to be found, Dean would yawn and wipe his sleepy eyes and whisper that angels were watching over both of them, now.
Dean cracks his knuckles against his palms. The fire grows; and it is oh-so different than the way the ocean's tide will wash over the sand. It is not calm. It is not something a mother could love. It is not something anybody would show their kid, but rather something that would be shielded from innocence in an attempt to preserve it.
Claire folded her arms and lifter her chin. She shot Castiel a sideways look. “This is who we were waiting for? Who is he?”
“I can’t- why would they- how could they think that? They didn’t shout in front of the kids, did they?”
Next, he ran into the bookstore and went straight to the information desk. Here, he was faced with another grinning employee who handed him a stack of books that he’d requested over the phone. Castiel double checked his list to make sure everything was there while thanking the young man who then rang up Castiel’s purchases and gave him sincere congratulations along with his receipt.
“There may be mild side effects like any medication, but none that should make you drowsy or anything. If you do notice any odd side effects, call the office and we’ll try and find you something else.”
Castiel sobbed in Dean’s arms as his husband rubbed his back. “My God, Dean. Our poor baby. He must have been so scared.” He shuddered and a fresh wave of tears ran down his cheeks.
Castiel wandered over to the table and picked some finger sandwiches and vegetables for his plate. He was turning around when another woman walked in. She looked to be around his age with bright blue streaks in her dark hair and her arms were covered in tattoos. He barely noticed any of that however. His attention was pulled to the horse at her side. An honest-to-God horse. Or was it a pony? It was tiny: he’d seen bigger dogs before. It was solid black with white feet and a single splash of white on its forehead. It was wearing a sparkly purple vest covered in patches and the woman was holding onto a rigid leather harness on its back. A look around the room showed a few people greeting her in acknowledgement, but nobody seems perturbed by the
Castiel couldn’t watch any more. He was already in a bad mood and now he was embarrassed at how his comment had sounded. He stalked out into the parking lot and stood by Balthazar’s car. He friend appeared a minute later and unlocked the doors in silence.
wasn’t the right thing to say. Castiel scrambled for a response. He didn’t want to cause problems with another parent, but he couldn’t let her continue flirting with him. “Yes, it’s a good program. Um, my ex-h-husband found it when Claire was little.”
Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Sam, and Gabriel showed up around five. They brought the kids more presents and everyone chuckled as they ripped them open. Dinner was wonderful and smashing up the gingerbread house to share for desert was the most exciting part of the meal.
The group chatted as they made their dinner. Sam had never seen his brother look at anyone the way he looked at Castiel. His eyes rarely left the man and Sam would swear he looked like he was going to melt as he watched Castiel tried to copy the signs Eileen was teaching him.
come. The assembled fans watched in confusion as no flag appeared on the play. The camera panned to coach Payton screaming at the refs and then back to the players gathering back on the field. The patrons in the bar soon echoed the shouts of the fans at the stadium. That was clearly two separate penalties; a pass interference and a helmet to helmet. Either of these should have at least resulted in an automatic first down but nothing was happening.
The original file on the children had contained some details on the kids’ birth parents, but Jaqueline had additional information for them. The father, Nicholas, had immigrated to the north of Brazil in his late teens. He then worked as a customs agent at the port in Belém. He had no siblings and his parents had never left French Guiana. All attempts to locate them had been unsuccessful. Their mother, Rosine, had been a nurse. She had immigrated to Brazil with her brother and when contacted, he had declined to take the children and informed the agency that they had no other relatives. At some point after Nicholas’s death, Rosine was diagnosed with cancer and moved to Recife for better treatment options. Unfortunately, her cancer was very aggressive and there was not much they could do for her.
She wrote out a prescription and stood to shake his hand. “It was nice seeing you Castiel. I hope Dr. Adamson can give you some answers.”
Dean’s whole body tensed and he let out a series of curses followed by a deep groan as he came on the shower wall. Castiel followed soon after and they stayed still for a few minutes with Castiel’s arms wrapped around Dean and the taller man relaxed in his embrace. Finally, Castiel softened enough that a small shift of the hips caused him to slip out. Dean whined a small protest before twisting around and bringing their mouths together. They shared a few lazy kisses before rewashing and finishing their shower.
Max found his first. He chose a small pumpkin he could carry around from the table near the register and refused to part with it. Alicia found hers next. It was large, white, covered in bumps, and very misshapen. She loved it. Castiel maneuvered the sad-looking pumpkin into their wagon and hurried to catch up with Dean and Patience. The two had stopped near a pile of pumpkins and were comparing different ones. Dean was going for size and Patience was going for conformity. She rejected any pumpkin with a blemish and wasn’t satisfied until she found the “perfect” one. Castiel grabbed his own once Dean found his and after everything was paid for, they loaded the car and headed home.
It was still early, so the place was mostly empty. Castiel’s gaze swept the room before landing on the back of his brother’s head. He was sipping a soda at the end of the bar and nodding to something Ellen was saying. The woman who was like a mother to Dean, and who had become one to Castiel as well, looked up as he walked closer. Her face broke out in a wide grin and she tucked a lock of her light brown hair behind her ear as she came around the bar to pull him into a hug. “Cas, honey. It’s good to see you.” She pulled back to study his face, her brown eyes sparkling with affection. “It’s been a few weeks since I’ve seen you boys. How are you?”
Ignoring him, Castiel answered Meg. “I’m not sure when we’re leaving. I have to talk to Dean and call the agency back to see what else we need to do before we can go.”
To say he was a fan was an understatement. To see Cas just as excited about the game was a huge plus. He’d had a few serious relationships in the past but none of them had really understood his devotion to his team. The grinning guy next to him was brand new to this city and he was already more involved in the game than most of his exes had been.
Bi-weekly visits with Mr. Rocha and Ms. Aranda turned into weekly visits midway through their stay. The visits were quick, just a simple check to make sure everyone was adjusting well. The fact that they’d recently had their last appointment with them was a relief. Whatever progress Max had made seemed to vanish the second the two walked through the door. He became nervous and clingy and didn’t recover for several hours after they left. Castiel was glad they never tried to separate the children for private interviews. Poor Max would probably have had a panic attack.
Then it was Mr. Rocha’s turn to speak. With Maria’s help, he explained that he believed Max’s silence was a result of trauma. According to his older sister and family acquaintances, Max was normally an animated and talkative child. But ever since he had arrived at the group home, he hadn’t said a word. Max had been the one to find his mother’s body and it seems he had spent quite some time trying to wake her before the neighbors investigated his cries. The girls had spent the night with a friend for a birthday party and the coroner estimated their mother had been dead nearly fourteen hours before the woman next door found the little boy clinging to his mother’s corpse.
The cathedral was old and didn’t have a toddler room or Sunday school like the churches back home. Their kids were generally well-behaved anyway but an hour and a half was asking a lot for three children under five. There was some wiggling and attempts to crawl under the pews, but the children seemed to enjoy the songs and none of them screamed or had a meltdown so Castiel considered it a success. He made a mental note to search for a new church when they got home.
“He’s not wrong. Whenever Eileen gets crafty, we sell out of her stuff quick. What are these Cas?” Dean held up one of the bees.
Castiel was getting fed up. He started to avoid leaving the house for fear he’d get dizzy in public, which he noticed was happening more frequently. Meanwhile, there was an almost constant ringing in his ears and they felt full, like he had a head cold. Dean was nothing but supportive. He kept encouraging Cas to do things and accompanied him if he was feeling anxious.
A knock on the door interrupted her. They turned to see his mother and Sam coming in the door. Behind Sam, standing a little too close, was Becky. “Hi Dean! It’s so sweet you’re getting Castiel a puppy! Could you guys get any more adorable?!” Dean was glad the puppy couldn’t hear her, or he knew that the pitch of Becky’s voice would have startled her.
Dean groaned. He felt like an ass. Plenty of dudes liked what many considered “girly things”. God, Charlie would kick his ass if she found out how much he had assumed about Cas without even
“I’ve never seen him dote on an animal so much. I felt like a monster when I told him she was being pulled for another rescue.”
The thought of losing Cas makes him feel sick. Maybe he can still salvage this. “’M sorry if readin all that made you feel uncomfortable. We can just keep being friends and nothin has to change, I promise.”
His friend turned his way and smiled at him. Dean loved the little crinkles that formed next to his eyes. “Good morning Dean. How are you?”
They exchanged phone numbers under the guise of Dean being able to answer any questions about the movies or recommend any new ones. Really though, Dean thought Castiel was pretty interesting and funny, even if it was in a dry, dorky way. He was looking forward to being friends with the man.
While Meg was very chatty about all things work, she refused to give an explanation for her behavior with Gabriel. She simply stated that he had dropped her off and that was all, but quickly changed the subject whenever it came up. Gabriel was oddly tight-lipped about the incident as well.
Castiel internally bristled. Naomi was a shark and it was an unspoken agreement on the block to never reveal more to her than was strictly necessary. The woman lived to try and twist the bylaws whenever possible so she could fine her fellow neighbors. “He’s good. I met him properly yesterday. He’s very nice and I think he fits in well here.”
Castiel rinsed the remaining toothpaste out of his mouth. “He also said my balance wasn’t bad. I felt fine and that therapy just made me feel like crap.” He mirrored Dean’s pose on the other side of the sink.
Back at the craft store, he picked up the main gift. Several other staff members had gathered around the register and were giving him heart-eyed looks and adoring smiles. His item paid for, the employees clapped and called out encouraging remarks as he left. He blushed deeply and his cheeks hurt from smiling so much, but he didn’t care. His faith in humanity had been restored a little bit.
“You’re probably comin down with something. Not surprising with all those people around on the flights back.”
If he was honest, he and Amelia were never really a good fit. Of course he did love her then, but they didn’t share many of the same interests and her constant paranoia that he would cheat just because he was biromantic was tiresome. She would get angry whenever the subject came up and didn’t understand why he wouldn’t just call himself straight after they were married. He thought eventually she would be flattered that she was the only one he was sexually attracted to but that never happened.
“Dean. Dean look at me please.” Dean turned and faced Castiel. He had narrowed his eyes again and thrown in a head tilt just to really twist the knife. God, Dean couldn’t do this. “Do you have a problem with Cain? Is that why you’re so upset?”
Castiel rose from his seat and walked to the door. “I’ll see you next month.” He turned and left without waiting for a reply.
Castiel sat stunned. He would have never guessed his cousins would turn on him like this. He wasn’t as close to Hannah as he used to be, but they had always gotten along. And Alfie? They were very close. They saw each other all the time and talked frequently. He was upset enough that his doctors weren’t taking him seriously, but his own family? If someone as close as Alfie could think that, what about everyone else? Who would turn on him next? Meg? Ellen? Sam? …Dean?
Raphael didn’t finish his sentence. A fist came flying out from the doorway of the office they’d stopped in front of and slammed into the other man’s jaw. He hit the floor like a sack of bricks and groaned. Balthazar stepped out rubbing his knuckles.
A bleary-eyed guy with wild, dark hair answered the door. Oh crap! Did Balthazar come back? Dean was trying to figure out what to say when the dude wobbled on his feet and pitched forward. Dean caught him on instinct and the guy wrapped his arms around him and clung tightly. He then started to cry and Dean was about to pull his arms back when he caught words in between the sobs. “Whyyy? Why would he do this to me Dee?”
First, he ducked into the craft store and found the employee he had spoken with on the phone. With a bright smile, she took the envelope he handed her and promised to have his item ready quickly.
Castiel chuckled and finished rinsing his teeth. He slipped on a pair of sleep pants (which had been odd to get used to after nearly a decade of sleeping nude) and climbed into bed. Dean immediately shifted closer and put his head on Castiel’s chest. “So glad we’re home” he whispered.
His husband’s expression changed to one of interest. “Yea. Too bad we have to unpack.” He pushed out his lips in a small pout.
Food consumed and candles on the cake blown out, it was time for presents. Of course, everyone got Patience way too many gifts and Castiel was worried this trend would continue. A little spoiling was good, but he didn’t want his children to turn greedy. He’d have to try to reign them in. But after seeing how happy Patience was, he figured that chat could wait until after Christmas. A quick glance at the twins and the small toys Ellen had included for them made him consider waiting until after
“Very much so.” Dean moved forward and pulled Castiel into a deep kiss that started off heated but turned more languid as Castiel pulled back. “Slow down, love. I really do need to wash up first.”
Dean spoke quietly, “It’s just. My family doesn’t know that I go to ballet shows. It’s not- guys aren’t supposed to like that stuff.”
“Love you too, babe. So, what should we do today? Our first meeting isn’t until tomorrow afternoon.”
just saying that to make you feel better. You are my best friend, but I would like it if we could be more than that. Castiel, would you
a bit flashier. It was a beautiful deep red color and came with leather-appointed seats, dual Blu-ray DVD players, a nav system, and doors that could be opened with the key fob. While Castiel would miss his old car, he couldn’t deny that he was a little excited by all the features.
“Well, I have to get back to work.” She turned to Sam, who had been trying to inch away from her, and laid a hand on his arm. Squeezing gently, she gave him what Dean assumed was supposed to be a flirty look, but to him just came off as manic. “I’ll be seeing you Sam.”
Dean’s phone chimed and he pulled it out before snorting. “Oh my God.” He typed out a response and put the phone back in his pocket. “Gabe said your doctor slipped him her number on his way out.”
Balthazar leaned forward and covered one of Castiel’s hands with his own. “Don’t you worry that pretty little head. I’ve been thinking about this for a while. You know your friend Benny?”
After a few minutes, Maria stood and told the children it was time to say goodbye. Max looked up with a panicked expression and reached forward to clutch Alicia’s dress and pull her closer. Alicia hugged her brother and placed kisses all over his face. Patience looked dejected and Castiel assured them they’d be back soon. The girls only spared them a glance and a wave before crowding around Max.
“How-” Cas paused to swallow again. Yea, he was gonna blow any second. “How did I drink too much? I’ve h- uh… had more than this plenty of times before.”
When they got to the biggest rides, most of the signs proclaimed passengers under fourteen had to be accompanied by an adult. Castiel looked dismayed until Dean offered to go with Claire. The young teen rolled her eyes and just suggested they lie about her age. Castiel seemed ready to agree before Dean shot him a look that finally got him to put his foot down. Claire groaned and stormed off to wait in line while Dean kissed Castiel’s forehead before joining her.
At some point, Dean must have left because Meg was suddenly at his side replacing the blood-soaked cloth. His brother had on rubber gloves and was cleaning up the mess on the floor with a pinched expression. “Where’s Dean?”
He unlocked the front door to his half of the duplex and walked through the little shotgun house to his kitchen. “You want a beer?” he called.
“Hi Castiel. Nice to meet you.” Eileen also waved hello before Castiel led them back to the living room. He joined Dean on the floor next to the coffee table. Sam was confused to see them sharing a blanket with Monopoly spread out on the table in front of them.
Dean scoffed. “Really? You ask me to keep the noise down and the next day I’m getting a letter? Hell of a coincidence.”
Dean laughed and reached over to tickle her belly, bringing out more peals of laughter. Castiel turned to Max, who was watching the display with a smile. It was barely there, but it was a start.
Ellen left soon after he got Max settled to get to the Roadhouse. Castiel found Patience at her art station. He watched her paint for a while and gave her advice on mixing colors. By the time her new creation was set out to dry, the twins had woken up.
This guy was adorable. “Of course, dude! Most of them are from out of town, so they’re not going to be staying that late. I doubt if anybody is still here past eight.”
“An egg?! I don’t think George has ever had egg before.” He looked down worriedly at the tortoise. He wasn’t sure if he could eat it.
Castiel’s health was still iffy, though his illness had calmed somewhat. The vertigo spells were now few and far between. His balance, however, was terrible. It was as if he were perpetually drunk. He couldn’t stand still for long without swaying and he constantly stumbled around. He had caved and gone back to vestibular rehab, but it didn’t help much. Storm helped balance him when he felt unsteady. Dean and Katie had conspired five years ago to get the dog before surprising Castiel with the young puppy. Katie helped with the training and Castiel didn’t know where he’d be today without his dog.
“Maybe.” Castiel looked back up and gave him a tight smile. “I should let you get back to your guests.”
“Castiel, you had marked this form as completed. Whether it was due or not, you’d already given it a final check and deemed it correct. If Raphael hadn’t looked at these, this would have been a very serious problem.”
“I’ll believe that when I see it.” Dean responded by sticking out his tongue, which only reinforced Castiel’s original assessment.
“Dean!” Castiel shouted. He switched to signing as he scolded his fiancée, “Stop having them record me crying! It’s embarrassing!”
“Cas, you gotta stop saying that.” Dean took a deep breath. “I didn’t think you felt the same. That’s why I kept saying that.”
The next summer, Castiel’s old space at the market had been filled by another vendor. Dean’s space had doubled in size and a new banner read “Winchester-Novak Family Farm”.
Dean helped to rinse out the shampoo before following with conditioner (“You and Sam are so high maintenance, Cas”). After finishing with his hair, Dean squeezed out some body wash and ran his hands over Castiel’s body. He gently massaged every place he touched and Castiel was soon leaning bonelessly against his husband. “Mmm. Dean, that feels wonderful.”
Jack was much happier since the adoption. The death of his mother and the stress of his grandfather’s health had taken their toll on the boy. Once he was settled, and after several months of therapy with Charlie, he was able to relax and be a child again. He still saw his grandparents almost daily and had three new siblings to play with. Castiel and Dean didn’t ask him to call them by anything other than their first names, but he had slipped and called them Dad and Pop a few times. It was just as exciting as when the others had started calling them that and it warmed Castiel’s heart every time.
Dean dried his hands quickly and grabbed a spare bucket from under the sink. He walked over to Cas and moved his hands to grab it. “You drank too much. Hold this, you need water.”
Max stopped moving as he considered the question. He glanced up at Castiel’s face and stood to go to the bookshelf. He pulled out one of his favorites and shyly handed it over before curling up in Castiel’s lap. “Oh, this is a good one.” Castiel adjusted his son to a better position, wincing as his dull headache spiked painfully. He did his best to ignore it and started reading.
Sam huffed. “Dean, their food is expensive and the overdue fees are highway robbery. Netflix is so much easier.”
Dean opened his eyes and grinned. “Dean Winchester. I’m an Aquarius. I like long walks on the beach and frisky people.”
“Castiel, based on all this, I'm confident in my diagnosis of secondary hydrops. I suspect that when you had that encephalitis, it damaged your inner ear and triggered this condition. Your tests show reduced function in your inner ear and that’s probably permanent. The good news is that even though you’re having episodic vertigo, I believe the initial damage has caused you to skip over the severe spells that most people with Meniere’s have.”
“Oh no! I know what kinds of parties you throw Bal. I’d like my home to still be standing so our child has a place to live.”
The new family had visited many places around Recife in the last month; beaches, an amusement park, boat tours, museums, and even a church service. In learning more about their new additions, Dean and Castiel discovered that Rosine and Nicholas had been very serious about their Catholic faith and Rosine continued to take the children to mass whenever she was able after Nicholas’s death. Castiel hadn’t attended services regularly in years and Dean had only attended a few Christmas services after moving in with Bobby and Ellen. While Castiel had let his attendance slide, he still considered himself quite spiritual and said his prayers regularly. He and Dean agreed that they should never try to erase the memory of their children’s birth parents from their lives, so they should have the option of going to Mass if they wished.
“Oh, you’re even more adorable when you’re flustered.” Dean felt his face go redder if that was even possible. “Hmm… I think you should let me buy you a drink. You know, to apologize.”
Castiel’s eyes roamed over his body again and Dean felt himself flush. “Well, I’m still feeling a bit tired. I was going to stop for another coffee on my way home. Would you join me Dean?”
He should have brought Dean with him. As soon as he thought that, he got angry. He was a grown man. He shouldn’t have to take a chaperone to the doctor’s office with him. Fuming, he pulled out his phone and wrote a scathing Google review of the clinic. Feeling mildly better, he vowed to never let someone speak to him that way again and went back to work.
“Why would your friend want to meet me?” She looked between the two of them before rolling her eyes. “Are you dating him?”
He dawdled as much as he could, but eventually had to get back to work. The rest of his morning was spent sifting through sections of tax law he already knew in the vain attempt to earn the promised bonus he would be given if he found a new way to screw Uncle Sam out of company cash. Even if it was technically legal, he still felt a little uncomfortable doing it. Although earning a bit of extra money right now sure wouldn’t hurt.
Dean arrived at the animal shelter where his fiancée worked just after four o’clock. He could see Castiel’s car still in the parking lot so he circled the block to hide and sent off texts to Sam and his mom to warn them to keep out of sight. He waited ten minutes before driving back around. Cas’s car was gone so he sent off another text giving the all clear and made his way inside.
Hot damn. Dean always had a thing for men with deep voices, but this guy had a thick Russian accent on top? Before he could open his mouth to answer, Jo ran up the other man and started speaking quickly. He caught the words “sorry”, “brother”, and “ride”. The guy glanced up at him a few times before nodding. Facing Dean again he spoke, “Ok. You can stay. Be quiet, yes?”
Castiel sighed. “No. We’re not ordering them off of Amazon. We have to spend at least forty-five days in Brazil before we can bring them home.”
Castiel taps the counter while looking towards Dean’s bedroom door. Dean drank quite heavily the night before and since they’d been stuck inside, he’s been waking up closer to lunch on most days. It was only 10 AM, Castiel had plenty of time to read without getting caught.
Max sat in the corner of the room playing with legos. Castiel and Charlie sat watching him on the couch; he’d just finished telling her about his doctor’s appointment. Castiel spoke lowly. “It was weird how she kept insisting I need to take something for anxiety. Could she be right? Could I be stressed and not know it?”
“I doubt that Cas. You’re not sick all the time. If it was serious, I think it would be affecting you in other ways.”
The door slammed shut behind him which caused the group of around fifteen dancers to stop and stare at him. His eyes landed on Jo whose expression quickly went from surprised to annoyed. The music that had been playing abruptly stopped and Dean looked over to see a dark-haired guy watching him from next to the sound system. He titled his head and narrowed his eyes at him before he called out, “Yes? Can I help you?”
After nearly an entire day of travel, Castiel and Dean finally arrived in Recife. They were both exhausted and as soon as the taxi driver dropped them off at the condo they were renting, they collapsed on their bed (“I don’t even care that this isn’t memory foam, Cas”) and passed out.
Even with that incident, Castiel was pleased with his haul. He got gifts for their friends and extended family, some things for Dean, and of course plenty for the children. He would leave the rest of their gifts to Dean. His husband preferred shopping online over fighting crowds and loved cyber Monday. Castiel just hoped he could control himself. The wishlist Dean had started before they’d even left for Brazil was constantly growing.
Castiel watched his husband as he formed the patties for their burgers. The kids were in the living room playing. “Yea that’s weird. You get a little obsessive when you’re worried, but you don’t really let things bottle up.”
Dean ambled over and settled in the chair next to him. His husband’s smile still made his heart race. “Hey babe. You good?”
He found Cas right where he left him. He sat there sniffling and staring off into space. Dean made him take the pills and drink as much water as he could. Cas turned to him with a watery smile. “I’m so glad you’re here Dee. Though I wish it was under better circumstances.” Even though he slurred his words, Cas still tried to use proper grammar. Dean thought that was just how he typed. Apparently, he spoke that way too. It was adorable.
Dean cut him off. This was the second time today he’d managed to make Cas think he’d done something wrong. “No, Cas. You didn’t do anything.”
Dean composed himself and answered. “This is our third date.” He shot Claire his most charming smile. “Figured I should meet the most important person in his life before we got too serious.”
Just then, Raphael walked into the break room. He and Castiel didn’t get along at all. The man was a huge homophobe and though he never said anything outright, his pinched expressions and thinly veiled looks of disgust were enough. They worked in the same department and even though Raphael had been with the company longer, Castiel was more well-liked and better at his job. He had quickly found himself Raphael’s enemy. The man moved stiffly to the refrigerator and pulled out some fancy water in a glass bottle that probably cost more by the case than it would to feed a family of four for the day.
Dean was standing in the middle of his kitchen, vibrating with rage, and absolutely covered in glitter. The innocent little package lay where he’d dropped it; the spring that had activated the explosion of one of the evilest substances known to man, still bouncing slightly.
“Can you do somethin for me?” She nodded. “Just, pay attention to what your dad does alright? Not just what your mom
They only waited a few minutes before Dean found them. He sauntered up with a large grin and pulled Cas into a brief hug before turning to Claire. “Hey. You must be Claire. I’m Dean. Your dad talks about you all the time.”
“Ugh, don’t call me that. Lemme go change.” She did a little pirouette before winking and leaving through a side door.
Garth was currently in the middle of the children, playing right along with them. Three of them were his and his wife Bess sat in a nearby chair laughing at her husband’s antics. She was heavily pregnant with their fourth and was due in a few weeks.
Castiel winced as a loud scream was amplified through his hearing aids. He set the twins’ tenth birthday cake down on the patio table before reaching up to change the preset on the devices behind his ears. He felt a nudge against his leg and looked down to see his service dog, an Australian Shepherd named Storm, watching the children chase each other around the yard. Castiel sat down and watched his family and friends milling around while scratching his dog behind the ears. He thought about how much had changed over the last six years.
Dean furrowed his brow and looked around in mild shock like he hadn’t even realized he’d come inside. He shuffled his feet uncertainly before steeling himself and crossing his arms. “Is your little prank worth a theft charge? Baby is vintage and those valve covers were original.”
January passed in a blur and at the end of the month they celebrated Dean’s thirtieth birthday. Ellen closed down the Roadhouse for the party and Dean blushed and acted all embarrassed, but Castiel knew he secretly loved all the attention. A karaoke machine appeared at some point and the highlight of the evening was Dean and Sam singing some songs Patience had picked from the Frozen soundtrack. They didn’t even need to look at the screen to remember the lyrics.
When Dean called a few days later to invite Castiel on another date, he had to decline. It was his one weekend a month he got to spend with Claire. Dean was disappointed until he asked if he could take them both out. He mentioned a nearby theme park that he’d taken his ex’s son to and said it may help their relationship if Claire wasn’t shut up in her room the whole time. Castiel enthusiastically agreed and that was how he found himself standing at the front entrance to the park surrounded by screaming children and standing next to a sullen teen on Saturday morning.
Castiel was thrilled to be back home. Dean insisted he stay in bed, though he didn’t mind much. The second he was tucked in, Dean and all three of their kids climbed in and joined him and they spent the whole day cuddled together watching cartoons. When it came time to go to sleep, the children refused to leave and Castiel sent up a silent prayer of thanks that they’d chosen a king-sized bed.
His beautiful green eyes were so full of hope. Dean had put up with a lot these past few months and he had never once complained. Never got upset if Castiel didn’t have to energy to cook or do laundry. He didn’t get irritated at having to take over more than his share of the parenting duties or if Castiel was too ill to take advantage of their already limited opportunities for sex. Dean had been taking care of everyone, but who had been taking care of Dean? The last thing he deserved was to be yelled at.
Dean shot the phone an indignant glare. “How dare you? That place is awesome. You got your movies and your snacks all in one spot.”
He suddenly found himself in the waiting room of their favored urgent care center. He was leaning against Gabriel as Dean filled out paperwork. A nurse opened the door to the exam rooms. “Cas- Casteel Novak?”
He signed up for a free trial which was pretty simple since he already had a Blizzard account. He read all the information on the different races and classes he could be (geez there were a lot of options). He decided to go with a human warrior as his first character and then picked out a name for himself. It took a few tries to find one that wasn’t taken. He finally settled on Deanmon before taking a deep breath and hitting the ‘Enter World’ button.
“You are right, Jo. It is fun to ‘mess with’ him.” The guy flicked his eyes to Jo before his lip twitched and he finally smiled.
Dean spoke up. “I think I read about Men- Menye- that one when Cas first got sick. It said the vertigo is usually pretty violent with throwing up and stuff.”
His husband came into view. “Yea?” Dean’s eyes widened as he caught sight of him. What must he have looked like, that Dean reacted that way? “Geez Cas, you ok?”
Their sex life also took a turn for the worse. Usually by the time the children went to sleep, they were too exhausted for anything more than the occasional hand job. The few times they had been able to get more intimate were rushed; at any moment they expected a knock on their door. They also had to suppress the sounds of their lovemaking. Dean was normally quite loud and having to stifle their noises was a new experience. Castiel was really starting to understand why someone wrote about childus interruptus in that book Balthazar had gifted them.
Their chats soon branched out. They ranged from the philosophical to the mundane. Dean quickly figured out that anything bee-related was sure to brighten Castiel’s day and he spent more time than he cared to admit scouring the internet for bee puns.
Castiel brushed those thoughts away. They couldn’t change the past, but they could do whatever was in their power to make sure the children’s futures were happier. He felt Dean’s hand grip his own and met his husband’s eyes. The other man was smiling warmly and as usual, Dean knew exactly what Castiel needed to hear. “Let’s take our babies outta here, ok Cas?” Returning the smile, Castiel interlocked their fingers and they went back inside.
Dean chuckled along with him. “Yea, yea. Get it out now. You should come one weekend. Claire would love it.”
Folding a pair of Max’s shorts, Castiel gazed at the little beds and a sense of warmth spread through his chest. Dean looked up from his own pile of toddler clothes. “You ok babe?”
Castiel returned to the waiting room with a scowl on his face. He was still a little unsteady from his first rehab session and just wanted to get back home. He looked around the room until he found Balthazar by the reception desk flirting with another nurse. Jo had classes that day, so Ellen had to stay with the kids. He rolled his eyes and walked over to his friend.
Dr. Adamson smiled warmly. “My pleasure Castiel. My wife, Colette has Meniere’s. I know how frustrating it can be to find answers. You’re not alone in this. Here…” he pulled out a flyer and handed it over. “This is a support group my wife helped start. They have a Facebook page and meet up sometimes. Check it out if you feel up to it.”
He woke up when he felt someone moving beside him. His eyes opened to see Cas looking at him in confusion. His blue eyes had lost the drunken sheen, but they were still pretty red-rimmed. “Hey Cas. You remember what happened last night?”
The testing took two weeks. Before leaving the office that first day, Castiel had another hearing test and something called an electrocochleography, or ECoG. The purpose of the second test was to measure the pressure of Castiel’s inner ears. The nurse informed them that Dr. Adamson would call them with the results and scheduled Castiel for further testing.
Dean and Castiel started chatting often after that. Every time Cas watched a movie, he asked Dean plenty of questions. Most topics seemed to confuse him. Dean didn’t mind. He’d waited years to find someone to educate on the finer points of cinema. Sam hadn’t shared Dean’s taste in movies since they were little and most of his co-workers seemed to prefer more modern movies that were all crappy CGI.
“A bit. Let’s sit for a minute, ok?” Castiel led Dean to a bench. He landed heavily and sipped his soda. “No more roller coasters for me.”
“You make a good point. But in all seriousness Castiel, I’m so proud of you.” He reached up the squeeze Castiel’s hand before pulling back. “Now I better go before Ellen hunts me down.”
The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. He’d worked hard and saved for years to buy his dream house. And now he’d barely been there for a week and he was already in trouble with the HOA? What kind of ass would report him for a damn barbeque? Fine. If that’s how his neighbor wanted to be, then Dean would give him a piece of his mind.
One evening around five months after starting said friendship, Cas didn’t show up for a raid. The rest of their group was gathered and waiting, but after an hour Cas was still a no-show. Dean and a few other guild members tried messaging her, but she never responded. Eventually, the rest gave up and found a replacement for their missing healer but Dean chose to not join them; he was too worried.
“I agree. Even with all of my research, I don’t think I’ve found half of this and I never even thought about looking for a doctor.”
Panic shoots through him. Cas doesn’t want to be friends anymore. “Please, Cas. Please just try to forget you saw any of that. You’re my best friend. You’re one of the most important people in my life. Please can we stay friends? I won’t do anything to make you uncomfortable. And if I do, just tell me and I’ll stop. Just don’t--”
Soon the party died down. There were quiet conversations and Garth sat in the corner playing gentle Christmas carols on the piano. Castiel snuggled up to Dean on the couch and dozed while his husband chatted with Benny. Their family started saying their goodbyes and the guests trickled out slowly. Max came to curl up in Dean’s lap and Ellen came in a few minutes later to show them the picture she’d taken of Alicia. The little girl was curled up in a pile of stuffed animals, fast asleep. They figured that was their cue and the tired men loaded their kids in the car and went home.
After a quick check and instructions on concussion aftercare, Dr. Barnes gave them her information with a reminder to follow up. Dr. Kali gave him his discharge papers while Dean called Gabriel to pick them up.
It was another hour before they finally got around to eating dinner. They agreed to wait until after they’d eaten to read the rest of the e-mail. Castiel was shocked when Dean finished in record time and then proceeded to say that the pie could wait.
He turned to search for Castiel again and smiled when he found him. The man gave him a little wave, which he returned. “I really do.”
Dean deposited Castiel on the sofa. He lay on his side but the dizziness didn’t stop. It felt like his head had been replaced with a fishbowl and the water was sloshing back and forth. His stomach churned but thankfully not enough that he feared actually getting sick. It was then that he registered the low ringing and the pressure in his ears. They felt like they needed to pop. Before he could examine the feeling more, his husband reappeared with a glass of water. “Drink up, Cas.”
Both Castiel and Dean started crying as they listened to the older man speak. Jaqueline gave them an understanding nod as she suggested they take a small break. The other two agreed and left the room. Jaqueline offered them tissues and bottles of water before she left also.
Impala67: dont think it would really be my thing. no offense, but i actually have a life. everyone ive met who plays wow either dont have lives or live with their parents
Knowing what he meant, but still determined to rile the man a bit more, Castiel played dumb. “Where’s what?”
“Nah, nothin like that. Well, I have my Dammit Doll and uh, I got a punching bag if I get really upset…” he flinched a bit waiting for Cas’s reaction.
She chuckled and shook her head. “Castiel that sounds like Meniere’s disease. That even explains your drop attack a few weeks ago.”
Max stayed where he was and continued to play quietly with the doll. His eyes kept flicking up to watch his sisters and he looked like he wanted to join them but was too nervous. He wore black shorts and his shoulders were hunched under his orange shirt.
Dean leaned against the counter and crossed his arms. “Come on, Cas. You gotta go back. The doctor said it would help.”
“Exactly what you’ve been doing. You can probably do without the diuretic long-term if you watch your diet. I’d like you to start vestibular rehab as soon as possible. It’s like physical therapy for your balance system. You’re not too unsteady right now, but that could change and the VR will help you manage that. I also want you to come in monthly for the next few months so we can see how your ear pressure is doing. We’ll redo your hearing test in six months. You do have mild hearing loss, but I don’t think hearing aids would be beneficial yet.”
“I know. I’m sorry Castiel, but it’s not just this. You’ve been missing a lot of work lately and Raphael and some other colleagues have noticed you’ve been increasingly distracted ever since you came back from Brazil. And now with this error… I’m afraid we can’t ignore something like this.”
With an audible squeak of the door’s hinges, one of the most gorgeous men Castiel had ever seen stepped out of the car. His ran a hand through his dirty blond hair and stretched his body out like one does after a long drive. Castiel caught a glimpse of his skin under the band tee he wore before the man dropped his arms and closed the door. He walked around to the front of his car and leaned back against the hood with his arms crossed and a proud smile directed towards his house. The man had a gorgeous smile- one than made him look young and carefree, and Castiel had the oddest urge to get closer to him just to soak in some of the sunshine that seemed to radiate from the stranger.
Dean found him crying in their bedroom. His husband pulled him into his chest and kissed the top of his head. “What’s wrong, Cas?”
Castiel turned to watch his daughter. She seemed to be having fun with Ben. Maybe it would be good for him to try and become friends with Dean. The other man had a point; he’d been on his own for too long. Castiel deserved a social life and Dean appeared to be a good guy. Castiel smiled warmly. “That sounds like a great idea Dean.”
Then the gifts started. Many of Castiel’s cousins couldn’t make it but sent gift cards in the mail. Gabriel got the kids a large wooden play kitchen and an Easy Bake oven. Sam got them books, CDs, and DVDs, all with English and French versions. Bobby and Ellen got a jungle gym for the backyard and Jo got the matching sandbox. Benny and Andrea got them play food for the new kitchen. Garth brought a large pack of hot wheels and a racetrack. Jesse and Cesar gifted them an art station complete with supplies. Meg brought two big boxes of Legos. Alfie got a variety of costumes and props for playing dress-up.
“Unfortunately, I’ve gotten familiar with most of the staff here over the last few weeks.” Becky’s face fell before Castiel realized how his words might have been construed. Balthazar stared at him incredulously. “I—I just meant… you know… I wish I didn’t
“Let me help you then.” Without releasing his hold, Dean moved Castiel under the spray and then reached over to grab the bottle of shampoo. He turned Castiel around and he soon felt his husband’s fingers massaging his scalp as he washed his hair. He groaned softly as he leaned his head back. “That feel good Cas?” Castiel could only grunt an acknowledgment which made Dean chuckle.
Be kind to each other. You never know what a person may be struggling with. Stay wonderful AO3 peeps! <3
Castiel studied the card. When he saw the clinic logo, anger flared in his gut. “You’re joking. This is the same ENT I saw before.”
Out on the sidewalk, his husband looked ready to snap. “How could they do that?” he hissed. “Take him away from his sisters? They’re all each other have left!”
The next day, Castiel was still kicking himself over his behavior around Dean. He’d never had the best people skills and Dean had caught him off guard with the sudden introduction. It was also the first time Castiel had seen the man up close and he’d been doubly stunned by his beautiful eyes and smattering of freckles. Add in a deep aversion to confrontation being triggered by his simple request to keep the noise down once it got late, and all that equaled one very stressed and deeply embarrassed Castiel Novak.
Dean snorted. “No. But I wouldn’t have waited till the end of the day to come get her. You’re right Meg, she’s perfect.”
Dean looked down at the puppy. Now he knew why Cas was so enamored with her. He looked at Meg. “You could’ve told me that on the phone.”
The two men watched as long as they could before Jaqueline ushered them into the hallway. “Is Max ok?” Dean asked.
Gabriel bounced out of the room, pulling a sucker out of his pocket as he did so. The second the door closed, Castiel slumped back. “I love my brother, but sometimes he’s exhausting.”
Dean realized he’d been gripping his fists and glaring at the bees. Making himself relax, he gave Cas a smile that he knew didn’t come off as genuine. “I think it’s great Cas.”
She chuckled and shook her head. “Dean sure has rubbed off on you. I’ll go see if Benny is done with your dinner.” She patted his cheek before disappearing into the kitchen.
The methods suggested by the psychologist for helping Max are very outdated techniques and are now strongly discouraged. He was not being intentionally malicious, but was just misinformed. He truly wanted to help Max.
Cas grumbled. “That sounds unpleasant.” He swallowed again and this time there was a small gag too. “What will that be like?”
“So, the technical name for Meniere’s disease is Primary Endolymphatic Hydrops with an idiopathic process. It’s the same illness with a different trigger. In secondary hydrops, the disease is triggered by an outside source; illness, injury, infection. The damage to the endolymphatic sac is done and it results in the vertigo and other symptoms you’ve been having. With primary hydrops, or Meniere’s disease, an otherwise healthy ear is damaged due to unknown reasons. Although, research is leaning towards an autoimmune disorder. Anyway, the damage happens slowly over months or years. Many people with Meniere’s have violent attacks that come with vomiting, sweating, shaking, even incontinence in some. Over time as more damage is done and function in the inner ear is reduced, those symptoms lesson to a general unsteadiness and milder vertigo spells.”
The next two months were insane. The Saturday after the life-changing e-mail, Dean and Castiel hosted a cookout in their backyard. They invited their families and friends to the party and once everyone had eaten, they showed the reveal video through a projector aimed at a sheet stretched across the lawn. Gabriel had helped him edit it to cut out the naughty bits the day before, much to his disgust (which was made worse when Castiel requested a copy of the full video). At the end, they added a copy of the letter from the agency and the photo of the children. Naturally, Gabriel had wanted to record the larger reveal to post on social media and Castiel gladly agreed.
Dr. Adamson’s eyes clouded over in what Castiel recognized as pity. He’d been getting that look a lot lately and it was really starting to wear on him. “I wish I could give you definite answers Castiel. The truth is, everyone progresses differently with hydrops. I’m not going to lie to you; some people do go deaf, some don’t. The vertigo may stop one day and never come back or it might stay the same. I’ve specialized in this field for almost thirty years and I can honestly say that no two patients are alike.”
Two hours later and Dr. Kali returned with another woman holding a file. “Castiel, this is Dr. Barnes. She’s the neurologist who looked over your MRI.”
It didn’t get any better when they sat down to play. Dean would lean in to murmur advice in Castiel’s ear and Cas hardly ever made a move without glancing at Dean to try and gauge his opinion. They seemed to have whole conversations with looks and gestures. Maybe they didn’t realize how obvious they were being, but to Sam and Eileen, whose every interaction took place through non-verbal communication, they may as well have been holding up neon signs.
Sam came over also. “Damn she’s cute. What breed is this?” He started whistling to try and get her attention.
“No… I don’t want to…” his whine made Dean want to bundle him up and protect him from this whole humanity thing.
They said their goodbyes and hung up. Dean made some quick calls to his mother and brother to meet him at the shelter and told his boss he needed to leave early. He was so excited, he could barely concentrate for the rest of the day.
Bobby shakes his head. "He was calling a helluva lot while you two were gone, but I guess he finally gave up. He stopped calling a few minutes ago."
He felt strange. His world was as if looking through good quality sunglasses, in the way that everything is shaded darker for better or for worse, and with every step the perception made everything feel more off-kilter. But it's supposed to be good, so the sunglasses stay on.
Sam has left the kitchen, Dean notices, as he forces himself off the floor with shaking legs. "I'll be right back."
The vehement fondness that he carries whenever Dean does very ordinary human things is another prime exemplar. Castiel knows full well that both Sam and Dean do silly things that are so very mortal, but Dean manages to do them in a way that can’t help but make Castiel grin with such devotion and warmth.
"That's alright," Dean gives him a short smile. "Hold the sparkler out, and I'm going to light the paper at the very end of it. Then it'll start sparking, and then you can wave it around like a magic wand, okay? That isn't a euphemism."
More than anything else though, it was human. The word seems to crop up frequently, and Castiel can’t even complain, especially when Dean is pulling him in greedily for a second kiss, a third one, and he willingly complies.
He grows to understand why humans are picky with the nutrients they consume. (Dean told him, as he pushed away vegetables on his plate and stuffed his face with more of his burger, that it was because some foods were not as good as others, and that ‘good’ can mean more than healthy.)
Eli smirks. "I think he needs to be taught a lesson, Dad. I think John Winchester has been gone a little too long. He's losing his touch, forgetting valuable lessons and all that."
"Yes, pretend." John stood up. "Because the real heroes are the ones that go overseas, Sam, not some pretty suit-wearing boys that abandon their families. You want to leave us for some school? After everything I've done for you?"
And again, Castiel doesn't speak. He does look back, though, tilting his head to the side in that same way he has since they met. His expression urges Dean to continue.
The sun was glittering off of the rolling assortment of foaming waves. Sitting in their little riptide, hidden from everyone else, or so Castiel likes to believe. The crabs and the critters like to wander around here the most often, and Dean has grown to believe it's just because Castiel is that special.
When life is a repeat of tragedy— a long line of fear after fear becoming true; there are things that come easily into light. Mason jars. Blue eyes. Bottles of Coca Cola. The smaller things in life, piecing together to make everything else, to make you realize that it was all for a reason.
It’s a week later when Sam finds the note crumpled behind the trash can while he’s cleaning up the library. Like anybody would be, he was intrigued. It doesn’t take long to find an Enochian translation book in the Men of Letters library, so Sam gets started on decrypting the thing within the hour he found it.
Eli grabs one arm and yanks Dean closer to the water. "Don't worry, pretty princess, this will wash that red right off. Just think of it as a day at the spa," he snickers.
Bobby raises his eyebrows with surprise. "Alright, I'll be honest. That's not what I expected. Dean, this is a huge goal. How much is it?"
The memory fades just as simply as it has come, leaving Dean to exhale a heavy puff of breath. He shakes his head, thoughts coming too slow to be coherent now.
Dean doesn't even have a chance to get up before he's being kicked by both of the Stynes. His ribs go numb with every swift movement of their legs; everything hurts and he just wants to go home.
"Yeah, I do." Sam raises his backpack in his left hand. He was taking free classes at the city center over the summer to count as extra credit, hopefully even a scholarship. Dean isn't surprised that his little brother was more prepared to bolt out of the house than he was. "Also, don't embarrass me. I'm serious, I really like this girl. She's smarter than both of us combined."
-alcohol/alcoholism/underage drinking (scene detailing dean's experience with underage drinking, alcoholism, as well as mentions to John's alcohol problems. alcohol is mentioned on several occasions in scenes where there are parties or conversations between characters.)
Dean felt empty with a gaping hole rested in his chest, holding a pillow in his arms and shutting his eyes, trying so hard to imagine it was something else. A phantom warmth had him almost smile; but the smile faded when reality hit like a train. He was alone. Truly alone.
(It seemed like that since the two met. They never drifted too far apart, because like the kelp will wrap around each other by help of the current, they're bound to be together even after life's slow rhythm pulls them away.)
"Dean," Cas says, and his voice was deep and cool, soothing Dean as if it had always meant to do so. "Are you alright?"
"Alright. Get out of here, you've got work today," Bobby reminds, his voice going back into its normal grumpy lilt rather than his serious concern.
"Are you alright, Dean?" Castiel frowns at him with a deep concern. "We should get you to a hospital. You nearly drowned, I had to resuscitate you."
Dean scrambled down the hallway and shut the door behind him, his little heart racing his tiny wired ribcage. He heard his father's heaving sobs and screams of anguish through the thin walls.
"No, no, I didn't mean anyone. Nothing like that." Dean wasn't exactly lying. The only thing was that, telling Sam he had a job working at the beach was tricky. If he told him he was taking up a lifeguard job, then he would have to say why. The Why was something Dean couldn't share; and he didn't want to keep a secret if Sam knew of the secret's existence to begin with.
The silence carried on the day until his shift was over, and Dean didn't even have to go to the showers in the locker room due to him not needing to go in the saltwater. This unfortunately meant that his shoulders itched and burnt an irritated red on his skin.
Charlie trails off and stares at him, looking as if she wants to say more, but she doesn't. Instead she gives Dean a nod, which he feels grateful for, and turns to leave.
"Aw, don't say that," Sam nudges his shoulder. "You don't have to be so humble. Take the praise, you deserve it."
The asshole from a few nights ago, now being renamed the asshole of today, pushes the man back forcefully. (The man doesn't seem to mind, stepping back and giving him an unimpressed look.)
"Dad, I don't want to look after the house. I want to be out there," Sam said pointedly, giving a tight frown as he gestured to the door. "I deserve to go to school. I've always been a good student. This is my life, you can't just say no."
Dean huffs a nervous laugh and sits down at the kitchen table. He props his feet up and faces Sam with his arms crossed. "Uh..."
"When you fall in love, Dean, I have a feeling you're gonna fall hard and fast. So... don't lose your wings for someone shitty, okay?"
Everything was no longer sunshine. It was not bright. It wasn't a cacophony of fireworks anymore, or a sweet kiss over soda. Dean sat here, feeling more in shambles than he ever has been, and he was finally, fully, exhausted.
Dean watches as Castiel sets his shoes on the log and steps into the low water, which sits at his ankles. He continues to wade forward into the middle, and then, peculiarly, he sits down. The water is covering most of his pants now, but he doesn't seem to mind in the slightest.
The dinner plates on the table are empty other than the one in front of Dean. He takes a forkful of cold green beans into his mouth, looking expectantly at the couple in front of him. The vegetables taste like the rest of his mouth; full of the iron from his blood.
Cas was a honeybee halo, sweeter than sweet and searing permanent marks onto Dean's lips in a perfectly clumsy manner that reflects into the very makings of his stitched soul. Cas has a natural serenity that he seems to radiate, like a careful grace that gleams through his veins like his own brand of stardust.
"Thank you," Dean says, his voice wavering. The words are heavy, they lay thick in the air. But it's a comfortable weight, like a tight hug after time apart or the feeling of your lungs after you take a deep breath. It's a freeing type of pressure. It lets Bobby know exactly the gratefulness he feels; not just for this instance, but every instance that came before, and every instance that may come after.
Dean blanches at first, but shakes his head jerkily. "I don't think Cas is open about anything. He thinks too much, all his words are in his head. Unlike you."
Time is moving so fast. He's gotten himself into a headspace where suddenly everything he needs to take care of is a clear list in his mind, and god save him, he's going to make sure everything on the list is crossed off. Number one being making sure that he was away from John. Number two being that Sam will be away from John when he finishes his school errands for the day.
"You said something about not being sure if you wanted to be a priest?" Dean supplies. "Granted, I did sort of interrupt you, which I—I am sorry about, by the way."
Sam nods seriously. "Of course." He hesitates before cautiously saying, "We have enough food to spare. If you want to invite him over."
The second is guilt, turning as quickly as a stone in the river. Dean swallows it down. "How did it happen?"
The day continues slowly after that, but he's thankful because he's still dealing with the adrenaline high of saving somebody for the first time—at least on this job.
-Castiel randomly infodumping on crabs after they spot a bunch of crab corpses and dean being like "they're annoying little fuckers, a crab stole my sandwich one time"
The design of the place didn't look like it had changed much. The floor still had a white and black checkered floor tile that younger kids now called "vintage". The walls were covered in a sandy yellow paper and were adjourned with seashell artwork and license plates, and sea glass hung from the ceiling tightly with brown twine over some of the diner tables. It was quaint and small, wasn't the cleanest, but Dean almost felt like he was visiting a long lost home.
He hadn't been ready for a permanent relationship, and up until now, Dean didn't think he ever was going to be. Which is why the thing Cassie told him all those years ago feels like it's burning in his brain, now.
"I got beat up," Dean repeats. Something in the back of his head nags at him to say something about Castiel, but for some reason he wants to conceal it, like it's a dirty secret. He frowns slightly. "The same assholes from a few days ago."
Sam doesn't know about the split paychecks. He doesn't know about the jar. He doesn't know about the real reason Dean took that job.
At one point, Dean must have laughed hard enough to bust a lung, because here he was having thoughts about kissing a certain dark-haired blue-eyed boy and John was nowhere around to stop him. Damn it, nothing could stop him, and the thought did not make him actually do it, which only made him laugh harder.
"You told me about the thing. You know." Bisexual, Dean's mind supplies. "And I wouldn't have... Well, I probably wouldn't have--"
Charlie is pushing her way past people and finally jogs up to Dean. "Dean! I haven't seen you in what feels like forever, man."
Dean feels Castiel lean against him, taking him out of his thoughts. He looks over to hear Castiel murmur something about being cold. Dean swallows his pride to put an arm over him, because if there's one thing he can do for Cas, it's to give him warmth. Castiel leans further into his side, and Dean doesn't fight the smile it brings him.
The man with blue eyes frowns with a very specific and thought out disappointment, and Dean wonders if he's said the wrong thing.
"Dean..." Sam opens his mouth and then closes it. Then he furrows his eyebrows, looking at Dean with a mess of sadness. "It's late. Just go to bed."
At this, Dean sighs heavily. "I'll call him later, okay? I have to clean up the broken glass in my room anyways."
"So. You stay here a few nights," Bobby speaks up. "Few weeks. Months. Whatever you need, long as you pitch in around here. Sam goes off to college. I can help you get your own place."
But that isn't what he really said. Instead, Dean implied to Sam that night that his big dream of helping people was stupid. "Lame." And while Sam had stormed out of the house in a smokescreen of hurt, Dean was collecting every dollar he could find in his room to put in a mason jar taped with the label "Sam's Getaway".
The nausea that overcame him in that moment, the guilt and sickness that was brought from being looked at by his little brother as if he was Dad himself— it halted all thoughts of drinking until Dean turned twenty. That's when it got bad, because Sam was old enough to take care of himself and Dean was in the very heat of learning to use the angry fire in his lungs to be just as bad as his...
Dean watches him go with a tired sigh and then continues walking down his original path. His fist aches from where it hit the other man's face, and no doubt his knuckles will be bruised by the time he gets back home.
"Well—" Dean pictures Castiel in his mind. His deep voice, his dark hair, his fond expressions. His angel eyes. "—They've got a nice soul. Which sounds really cheesy, but that's really the best way to describe them."
Dean swallows. He shakes his head. "I don't know. I don't freakin' know, Cas. I just know that I don't want to freak you out. I just—I feel like I'm going crazy, trying to figure out whatever... this is."
(Dean decides that he would probably tan. Somebody as pretty inside and out as Cas doesn't burn from the sun's light, because the sun, much like every other reasonable ethereal being, isn't out to harm him. The sun would much rather remove the hair from his eyes and gently kiss the skin on his arms to leave sweet loving freckles in its place. Dean also decides, much later in life, that he would very much like to be the sun, especially if it meant he could brighten Castiel's day whenever he pleased.)
"Shit, really? Not you again. I thought I took care of you last week. Didn't you like swimming with the mermaids?" Eli grins with the blood dripping down his lip. "Or do you only like fairies?"
The silence that follows his question is uncharacteristic enough for Dean to look over at Castiel from where he sat beside him in the sand. He has an expression on his face that speaks the volumes he didn't say. He looks as bitter as a lemon, like he's holding back a tsunami of thoughts in his head for no other reason than for Dean's sake. Slowly, he furrows his eyebrows. "Dean, do you believe in a Heaven or Hell?"
If Castiel knew any less, he would say that Dean simply didn’t mean to fall asleep. This was just simply not true, though.
Dean blinks, taking the information in. His dad wouldn't be able to tell anyone who asked the colour of Dean's eyes, but of course he remembers Sam's age when it was convenient for him.
Dean feels Sam staring at him and he drags his eyes away from Cas. "Anyways. We should go do sparklers or some shit."
Guilt greets him like a familiar friend, and Dean frowns tightly. "You're right. I didn't want you to go."
-they walk to their special spot on the beach, and since it has a lot more critters, you see a lot more of the debri from where birds have their morning meals
"I'm not eight." Sam places both plates on the table and starts eating his food. "What happened to your hand? Did you get in a fight?"
(Every night it was said before Dean was tucked in to go to sleep. Mary would kiss his forehead and tell him with a warm smile and shining eyes that angels were watching over him sleep. He doesn't remember one night where he had a nightmare because of it.
"I think I have to," Dean says carefully. "At least Heaven, anyways. My mom used to tell me that angels were watching over me. I think if anybody deserves heaven, it's her. I have to believe she's somewhere better than here, or better than some endless void of nothing."
Castiel looks up from his bowl and glances out the window. Outside the diner was a decent view of the boardwalk, as well as the waves flowing gently back to sea as low tide came in for the day. Birds flew down to get their own lunch.
Castiel seems to sense his discomfort in some otherworldly way, and he nods slowly. "Thank you. You're beautiful, too."
"Are you planning on drinking light tonight?" Charlie questions, gesturing to the singular bottle. "I've seen you down three of those with no problem."
Until the paper, crumpled and hidden under beer bottles in the bin, somehow finds its way back onto the floor. Dean was only trying to take out the trash, really, but he was a bit tipsy and accidentally stumbled on one of the steps, causing the bin to go flying across the room.
Dean stares at him for a long moment before snorting. He starts the car, letting it thrum back to life. “Sure. Buckle up, sweetheart. Time to hit the road again.”
John didn't say anything back, instead he gave a half-hearted chuckle. Dean heard his shoes against the linoleum as he stepped back and picked up his suitcase. He then stepped out the door, closing the door behind him.
"Don't you fucking move," Dean says immediately, putting an arm out in front of Castiel. "You don't get to touch him. You don't even get to look at him. Not like you do to me. You're not allowed to hate him."
Charlie is one of them, sitting in front of him with her red-banged hair and a sweet smile and bright eyes. The little sister he never asked for, and one of his new closest friends.
"C'mon, Sammy." Dean grins. His lip splits open again from where it had just started to heal, and he grimaces in pain, the grin falling from his face. He shivers, feeling the urge to throw up from the increasing pain. "Let's just eat, right? When did you two meet?"
Eli looks up with a devilish surprise. He doesn't seem opposed though, giving a sadistic grin and a firm nod not a second later. (This was the problem with assholes—They didn't seem shocked by their horrific ways.)
A smile eases onto Castiel's face and he nods. "I'd like that very much, thank you for the invitation. When is it?"
"You don't get it," Dean grits out. "I was going to get you there. I've been saving money the whole damn summer. Bobby gave me a job down at the Beach. I had... I had a jar. With everything in it. A check that Bobby gave me, coins, most of my paychecks from work— all of it."
Dean watches as Castiel brings his hands over to his own chest, holding them over his heart. He feels the steady beating under his sweaty palms, and as his breath becomes as even as the pace, he can start to feel his limbs again. The panic and rage replacing themselves with shame. Shame for feeling so vulnerable, shame for letting himself lose control, especially with guests in the house. Especially in front of Castiel.
"You stared at him in the diner too," Sam points out with a smirk. Dean doesn't like how knowing it looks. "And the fair."
The dark-haired man glares harder, looking thoroughly unimpressed, and looks at Dean. Dean looks back. The guy didn't look gay. First; he didn't have an earring on his left ear. Everybody knows all the gay people have earrings on their left. Plus, his nails weren't painted, he didn't look like he took extreme care in his hair, and while his shoes were well managed he wouldn't exactly point them out exclusively to be "sensible".
“Because—“ Cas gives him a sad smile that fades from his face almost immediately, as if he was too emotionally drained to even pretend to fake anything. “I can’t, Sam.”
"Castiel!" Jess says as she walks up with Sam. "How are you guys doing? We lost you while Sam was playing darts."
Dean stares at him with a scowl and finally shakes his head, throwing the towel he was using to dry his hands into the sink. "I'm just pissed off about Dad not being back, okay? I had to ask Bobby for a job at the freakin' beach to make sure our bills were paid."
He's said the words, in one way or another. Sam knows part of what Dean was supposed to tell him. And while there was a weight lifted off his chest, of having told somebody that he cares about something that had felt like a heavy stone in the pit of his stomach, there was still pressure. It felt like he wasn't out of the clear yet, somehow, even though the truth has been revealed.
Dean reaches into his pocket and pulls out three dollars. He hands them to Andy. "Go buy yourself a beer or something, alright? The corner store a couple blocks down sells it cheap. And, word of advice?"
Dean nods firmly and continues to walk. He tries not to look behind him. He tries not to run, but he knows that his feet are incapable of going even a second too slow— his head keeps telling him to go faster, to run as far as he can and never stop. There's also a very shameful part of him that's yelling in his ear, telling him to turn back and apologize for ruining everything permanently. There's no coming back from this, though, and he knows that.
"I get it," Charlie says softly. "And you're welcome. But you're the one who was brave enough to make the next move. You could have just as easily ignored me and stuffed yourself further in the closet. This was all you, big guy. You should be proud."
Dean gives him a side-glance, which usually means that Castiel should not have asked that question, and that the topic should be moved on quickly with a rough grace. But this time, he sighs and looks back in front of him.
Castiel doesn't even twitch, instead looking very concentrated and serious at the sparkler in his hands. "I didn't think it was, Dean."
Dean clenches his fist and pulls his arm back. He swings forward, the knuckles colliding with Eli's cheekbone. He can't even feel the collision with the adrenaline pumping through his blood.
"This is for that incident in the alley." Eli drags him to the shore, keeps him as upright as he can, and gives him a strong punch to the face for good measure.
Castiel shocks the both of them again by speaking up calmly. "With that logic, Dean is no more than an obligation to you. And since you've clearly failed that obligation, you have no reason to stay. Dean is far over eighteen, you have no power over him."
Unlike Dean planned, Sam doesn't falter at his snark. He raises an eyebrow, crossing his arms and planting his feet firmly in the kitchen. "I'm not nosy, I'm considerate. Don't be an asshole, Dean. You're deflecting."
Dean watches as Castiel considers this, and then he finally nods with understanding and continues walking. "Of course. Do you have any suggestions on a better place, then?"
Dean clicks open the soda bottle and hands it to Castiel, who opens his eyes and takes it with a grateful nod.
"I feel more myself with you," Castiel interjects firmly, "than with anybody I've ever known. You have a gift, Dean, of selflessness where you don't even see it. You think you don't deserve to be given the same amount of heart, but you do."
Dean picks up the plate and walks into his room, ignoring Sam completely. He shuts the door behind him and sits on his bed. In front of him, on the table, the mason jar sits on a desk. Just a couple of quarters are scattered on the bottom of it.
Charlie looks over at Dean and wiggles her eyebrows, and Dean only sort of nods, ignoring the embarrassment that was eating at his skull. It was the easiest way to tell her, as well as the cheapest way, as he wasn't saying any certain terms, but it's getting the information across. Charlie lights up immediately, so she must have gotten the message. "You should come get drinks with me, Dean. That's not a request."
Sam sighs deeply, watching him shoulder the doorway as he stumbles out of the library. He shakes his head and takes the grocery bags into the kitchen to put them away.
"No," Dean shakes his head quickly. He sits down across the table, and water drips onto the floor. His nose was burning like hell, his ribs were even worse. It hurts to breathe. "No, don't. Dinner, right?"
Sam's eyes are misty. He's trying not to cry just as much as Dean, he can see it. Sam hasn't said anything yet, so Dean takes the opportunity to change the conversation, so he sits down at the dinner table and opens the bags of food.
Charlie smiles softly and nods. Dean thinks that they must be in love, these two girls. There was no doubt about it, with the way they looked at each other. Like the other had hung the moon and stars, even when just moments before the air was tarnished with fear.
Dean blows the whistle around his neck and as he sprints forward, picking up a rescue surfboard. Confused swimmers start to wade out of the water. He's able to see the person now, her fingertips reaching out to the sky weakly before disappearing under the waves.
Castiel sips from a straw and listens to everyone talk, and he looks pleasant in their company. The faintest of smiles graced his lips, as if he was learning how to smile after several years of never doing it. But he was quiet, speaking up when he was addressed or nodding when he was glanced at to show that he was paying attention.
"Cas," Dean speaks up. His voice was grated and rough, trying not to carry as much bittersweetness as he felt about the man in front of him.
The air is chilly this morning. Dean's fingers freeze as he raps his knuckles against the door to Bobby's house. The old man was surely awake, although he may not be the happiest with visitors this early in the morning. But this was important.
Dean never had that luxury. He knows exactly what parts of him come from his dad and what parts came from his mom. The way he sees it; anything that he likes, anything that makes him smile or puff his chest when he looks in the mirror, he got from his Mom. Anything that he hates about himself, the fire in his chest and the desperate thorns of terror wrapped around his brain, the inherent loneliness he has, that's all Dad. Sometimes he wonders if this is because the last time he remembers himself in a positive light was when his Mom was still kicking.
If Dean knew one thing for sure about his childhood, it was that his parents truly loved each other. With a mind untainted by reality, it was easy to see it this way.
Truthfully, Dean has an exhaustion aching deep in his bones. It's been a while since he let himself truly break down; to let himself cry over a drink. Life is too short for that, he found. Emotions would well up no matter what he did, that was unfortunately how living worked, but he's busy and doesn't have time to dwell. (He does dwell. His head is a melting pot of every negative thought that he buries under the surface. Perhaps that's why he explodes like he does, like he did.)
