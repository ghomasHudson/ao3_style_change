Cas doesn't move to follow her just yet, lets himself sit with the pain of his injuries. If he was completely honest with himself, he knew what Jessica was saying was right. After Stephen’s death he'd- well, he'd lost his way. Just another father, surrogate or otherwise, lost to this life. But he'd never meant to cause Jess pain, to put himself more at risk with every hunt but- he supposes he stopped caring a while ago if he made it out, one way or another.
He treasures the moments where he gets stress headaches from hours of data collecting, and tedious phone calls with out of state hunters. When Cas purposefully kisses him with morning breath and steals the last good donut from the box. When his mother refuses his idea to ask for more grenade launcher funding or decidedly kicks his ass in a sparring match. Or when Sam teases him relentlessly about the Angel on his shoulder, even with the sickeningly sweet relationship of his own. Or when Charlie and Cas gang up on him over which Star Wars movie is the best (It’s Return of the Jedi and no he will not back down from that). And even when things take a decidedly bad turn as they always do, it’s okay because it’s not okay. Because he has Cas there to lean against and his mother to confide in and his brother to pretend like it’s all okay, and his family to know that it will be in the end.
He tries not to think about Dean.
“Oh, well.”, Anna muses. “We did leave our old ‘job’ together, I suppose.”, she says, doing air quotes. “We are siblings, actually, as well.”
Castiel smiles at him. And Dean, Dean smiles back.
“So. You love me.”, Castiel states calmly.
“You feel this way because you’re jealous because you’re in love with me.”
Cas balks. “Allowed you?”, he snaps, whipping his head around to glare at the hunter. “Help? You kicked me out. You did. You saved me and then kicked me out.”
Castiel doesn’t think about Dean when he has sex with George.
“Are they European or something?”, Garth, who, apparently, finally noticed what’s going on, wonders out loud from where he’s sat at his desk.
“See you soon, Dean.”
“Home?!”, he exclaims angrily. “The bunker is not a home to me. I have found a home now, no thanks to you. I am happy here.”
Dean slides his hand over to where Castiel’s are folded on his lap. He engulfs Castiel’s hands with his own. Castiel notices the blush on the hunter’s cheeks.
Dean leaves the store.
The door of the Gas’n’Sip jingles. “I have to go back to work.”, Cas declares and walks back towards the counter, where a new customer is already standing and waiting and she is not being subtle with her curious glances at the two men.
The door to the apartment opens, keys jingle and Bry and George enter with soft chuckles.
“Why not?”, he gulps. The siblings are asking a lot of questions, he muses. And they’re acting as if this is their first day on earth. Dean sniffs. Oh god, what if it is?, he thinks, panicked.
“Yeah, I guess.”
Ms. Milton is a redhead. Not natural, Dean assumes, the color is too red for it to be natural. Her eyes are big and expressive, her skin very fair. A pretty girl. She must be a couple of years younger than the man standing next to her. Mr. Novak is a tall man wearing a tan trench coat. His hair is dark and disheveled, his cheeks are stubbly and his blue eyes are piercing. Both newbies look like very intense people, Dean thinks. It’s the eyes, probably.
“He didn’t know exactly what Castiel was, but he had suspicions. A miracle baby, the son of a small town pastor, all those omens before the birth. It would have been very hard to miss, even for such a small time hunter. Moore wanted me, I wanted you, the pieces just fit,” she says, nearly squealing this last part in joy.
"You can't keep doing this."
“I’ll send you the rest of the details-
“Sound logic,” Cas says with a sigh, as he digs into his jacket pocket, tossing them to her as he slinks round to the passenger side door.
,” Garth tacks on quickly at the end, and Castiel smiles slightly, hearing the definitive signal to end the call.
Gabriel doesn’t even touch him but still, Dean feels those same wavery feelings of warmth in the air, and suddenly Cas is gasping back to life in his lap. He blinks owlishly up at them all, eyes back to their normal human blue, and Dean nearly cries with relief. Jess is already, sniffling as she lunges forward to wrap her arms around him. He hugs back briefly, stunned.
"Is your partner late?” he chokes out, letting out a slight groan of pain as she pushes harder, the metal creaking beneath him now. She just grins at him, tutting softly as finally, she comes face to face with him. He only takes a bit of satisfaction that Shelly is a good foot shorter than him, and she has to crane her neck up.
Someone is calling his name over it all, over the rolling ground, and shrieking incantation, someone is calling his name.
“But all angels use human vessels, how is this not different?” he snaps, and Gabriel's gaze immediately sharpens.
“Thank you Garth, I’ll check in again with you-
Something erupts from the ground then, cracking the front porch down the middle, shattering every window in the house outward. The light the wards had previously been displaying are shrouded by a blast of blue, white lights.
Eventually, after ruminating in his own thoughts for a good twenty minutes, he extracts himself from the Lincoln. Jess is already curled up in bed, her back turned to the door, and she doesn't so much as flinch when he steps inside.
. And he just can’t.
“I’m sorry.” It comes out softer than he’d meant it to, too fragile for the atmosphere between them, but Jess’s features soften. She adjusts the handle of her duffel, eyes averted as she collects her thoughts, before she answers.
“Well, it’s not definitive but, there may be a haunting in Kansas. It
Since this horrible evening began, Dean was certain he was going to die, that they were all going to die having failed their one mission. But now-
“I want to join the Men of Letters with you.”
Tendrils of power and energy circling above their heads like their own mini galaxy- and it’s then that Cas knows it wasn't anyone calling his name.
"Gabriel yeah, yeah, and you were supposed to be the righteous man- we're all important people," Gabe says, but his eyes are stuck on Castiel's lifeless form. Dean lets the latter half of that statement pass with mild confusion, and instead brings his focus back to Cas.
“I’ll check us out if you start the car,” she says carefully, and he nods, handing over their room key as she passes by him.
“Oh how very true that is, emotional, weak, and malleable. You’re as human as they come. But who’s Grace do you think is under the house?” Lilith sneers, and across the yard Jess lets out a sort of gasp, closing her mouth quickly at the interruption.
"Surprising isn’t it Jessica, big brother Castiel, an Angel of the Lord. He gave it all up, the power and the prestige of winning a celestial war to grovel among the humans. How has playing house been Cas, has it been as wonderful as you'd hoped?" she asks, running a hand over the top of his head, in a mockery of a mother soothing a distressed child.
“I’m sure,” Castiel says through a huff of laughter.
“Good,” Cas replies, and they lean into each other once more.
"Gabe," Dean says again more vehemently before he shouts full force up at the sky.
"Bingo! Now, I don't expect any of you to know what the spell’s for, but I’ll let Lilith explain that,” Azazel says teasingly, and gestures to his side where Lilith stands with her hands clasped.
"Gabe," he whispers aloud, and Jess looks up at him, her tear streaked face scrunched in confusion.
Well then, Azazel dear, if you wouldn’t mind?” She turns back towards Castiel’s direction, as the air seems to bend and pop behind him. He jerks his head to the side to see the man from the TV, eyes still that sickly shade of yellow. In his hand, he carries a burlap sack, in which something that looks suspiciously like blood drips from the bottom.
"Yeah, because I did it alone, but if we had each other, we could just- we could-" Jess stops, her desperation to grasp at a solution obvious. Cas lets the silence sit, lets it answer for him as tears prick at the corner of her eyes. The car rumbles along, filling in the gaps of stilled atmosphere between them, until at last, the neon sign of the motel appears, and they park.
The sound of metal rearing through flesh accompanies Cas's newfound ability to breathe, as the Ghouls' head tumbles onto the ground. Cas pushes the decapitated corpse off him quickly, as blood pools over his shirt. He glances up, still trying to recover his breath, at his partner Jessica Moore.
"Of course," he says easily, grinning as he walks past the rest of the hunters.
Still not completely forgiven, he sees.
“I think the meats been tenderized enough Lilith, time to get the show on the road,” Azazel says almost lazily, and Lilith lets out a regretful sigh as Jess sobs ring out through the air. Cas can’t- he can’t comprehend. He’s going to die, and so will his sister in all but blood, his friends-
“It was a strategic maneuver that I thought would work to get him out in the open.”
“I can see that. Why are you packing?” Jess pushes, and Cas pauses, hands hovering over his bag, wary of the possible confrontation this might stir up.
"I don't see a shovel anywhere, and you don’t seem like the type to get your hands dirty," Dean says sardonically, and immediately the demon is at his side, bending down to grip his hair and wrench his neck up. Cas struggles against the car as she holds Dean's stare, neither of them flinching away.
"There, that wasn't so hard, was it?” she asks sweetly patting his cheek, as she lets go of his hand. She stands then, and stretches her hands out over the bowl, mouth twisting as she begins to mutter something far older than Latin.
“And what makes you any different?” Cas asks cautiously, and watches as Lilith’s smile turns sharp with satisfaction.
, Dean can come to no other conclusion, as Castiel brings his hand down on Lilith's head. This is an Angel pure and simple. Powerful, and mighty, and real.
"Fine then, I'll let them watch, it'll be more fun that way," she whispers back and in the next moment her hand is being struck out, bringing the three hunters to their knees in violent succession.
Samson whipped his head back and forth.
“Is this for a special occasion?”
Cas grinned a little and typed, Well when you get back you’ll be hearing Elvis playing. He bit his lip when pressing send. Maybe it wasn’t a very forward text, but to Cas, it felt different sending it to Dean than if he were to send it to someone else like, say, Balthazar. It made him feel jittery like he’d had too much sugar. He didn’t want to think about it too much in case it decided to go away so he left it alone. It was hard to do when he felt the phone buzz and Dean’s name pop up. He wasn’t proud of the noise that he made when he read the message.
“That sounds rough dude. Is there anything that I can, like, do?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel handed over his phone with a small tinge of reluctance. Watching Balthazar’s facial expressions change as he read through the short response. He heard him mutter, “Damn right he should be sorry,” and “Well at least he’s smart to assume that much.” Then Balthazar handed back the phone and sat down on a beanbag.
“Don’t touch me.”
“Uh huh. I’m sure you don’t run into these issues.”
“I can tell.”
In an attempt to calm his now churning stomach, he closed his eyes and took a slow, calming breath. This worked to calm himself down, but not nearly enough to want to open his eyes again until he heard his phone give out a buzz and felt its vibration in his hand. Cas froze and looked down at the text that had just appeared.
“ZZ Top.”
“Let me go.”
“What kind of an idiot drives drunk? My brother didn’t do anything wrong! He was driving to a damn friends house but does God give a fuck? Out of all the bastards in this world and he takes my gentle caring older brother. Did the drunk fucker care that he killed my brother? He didn’t seem all too sad when he was informed on KHQ news, and all they’ve got to say is, “Up next, the traffic report. ” My stupid ex Jorge, decides to say to hell with my feelings and goes ahead and shags with another guy! Like who does that! A stupid asshole that’s who! And I walked in on him while he was fucking that other guy in our bedroom. Yep, do I get an apology? Do I get any support from my friends? No!”
As foolish as it was, Cas thought of Dean. Of how stupid he’s been to react this way when Dean had only been a good friend to him up until he abruptly left. That shouldn't have been enough to crush Cas. It wasn't as if Dean had told him to fuck off or to stop being such a nuisance. All Dean had done was leave, but somehow that cut Cas deeper than if Dean had said those other insults to him. To top it off, Cas could push that aside. He could move past the feeling of abandonment. At this moment, Cas wished more than ever that he was back at his shabby apartment. Wished that he hasn't been so foolish because now he may never get the chance to explain himself to Dean. Would never get the chance to apologize for being an idiot. Castiel wished pleadingly that someone would come to save him, but no one came for him.
“Why even ask me for help if you don’t do what I advise you to do? I mean, if I knew you were just going to ignore what I said, I wouldn’t have tried helping. Why—” The buzz of Cas’ phone interrupted Balthazar.
His phone vibrated, breaking Cas out his little dream. He glared grumpily at the screen, waiting for it to come on and show him who had messaged him. He had missed a call from Balthazar, must’ve happened when he was cleaning, and the newest notification showed a text from Dean. He didn’t let himself give any thought as to why he immediately grinned just from seeing his name appear. He read over the message.
“You’ll come back crawling to me Cas. Eventually, you’ll see that no one else will take in your sorry pathetic ass and you’ll be begging to be with me again.” Tears spilled down his cheeks. A small whimper escaping up his throat. “Eventually you’ll see it all too clearly.”
“Well, I don’t have a crush on you do I?” Brian retorted.
A minute later, his phone buzzed.
“What's the song?” Cas asked, but instead of a response Dean sang.
“Someone has to do it.”
“Smashing cars with a hammer?”
, he thought.
“Oh yes, I’m congratulating my granddaughter on her engagement. She’s to marry a delightful young man. You look a bit like him.”
“It's two in the fucking the morning!” Cas half shouted. Filled with impatience. He was tempted to leave him on the steps and go back to bed.
“Didn’t think you’d know Surrender. It’s one of his older songs; I thought you would only know the popular ones.”
Guys you've got to listen to this song for this chapter. It's super cute, it's by Elvis, and it's related to this chapter. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rQEbQJx5Bo
There was a pause on the other side of the wall. Dean crawled onto his creaking bed and pressed his ear to the cool plaster of the wall.
Dean's mind drifted back to the image of John’s black gremlin parked in front of the house. He thought it was a piece of trash at the time, and apparently, he was right because it had done nothing to prevent John’s brain from ejecting out of his skull.
“Like what?”
“Like hair bands and stuff?”
“Don't be like that Cassie,” Said Balthazar, before continuing on after Castiel managed to glare up at his buffoon of a brother. “Alright I'll stop teasing you, but you have to point out which apartment your creepy crush lives in.”
“Perhaps I’ll have to take you up on that sometime.” He could practically hear Dean’s eyebrows raising suggestively. He didn’t need to see him to know that it was true, but how Cas wanted to see Dean. It was becoming tougher to imagine him as anyone besides Hottie McHotpants and if Dean looked anything like him, Cas wouldn’t know what to do with himself.
He got the sleeping bag, made himself as comfortable as possible and fell into an easy sleep. He wouldn’t remember what his dreams contained when he woke up the following morning but thoughts of Dean were ever present.
His voice sent a thrill up Cas’ spine and unconsciously his immediate response was to start smiling. He grinned like a fool and couldn’t be bothered to care. He joined in singing the next part with Dean now that the initial surprise had worn off. Their voices blended together as they sang, “I'm in love. I'm all shook up. Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay”
Cas bit his lip and struggled to scramble up onto his feet. His throat was starting to ache more than was tolerable. The only cure for it would be a double dose of Nyquil. He shuffled over to where he'd dropped the bag of medicine and said over his shoulder, “I wouldn't mind hearing a couple classic rock songs. I'm too lazy to change over the record.” He pulled out the Nyquil and poured himself a shot, downing it quickly before putting it down on a counter with a sigh. That stuff always tasted foul.
, read the first text. The second said,
“Does little Cassie have a crush?” Balthazar’s taunting broke through Castiel’s thoughts.
**********
(See the end of the chapter for
“What," Dean replied, deadpanned.
“Look, Balthazar, I really don’t want to talk about last night and to be honest, I’d like to forget that it even happened. And since Dean is part of last night, I’m asking you to let this go,” Cas said in an attempt to reason with him, and although it may have been a futile attempt, he had to try. A part of him hoped Balthazar would just drop it. He regretted bringing up Dean, now.
“How dare you! I don’t talk to my neighbors through my damn walls.”
**********
**********
“Hey man, is everything okay?”
“Whatever, why do you care? Do you have a crush on him or something?”
“Oh really now? Tell me more, Dean.” He never got an actual response. He listened to Dean sing along to the song and towards the end, Cas joined him during the chorus. When it finished, Cas noticed he'd been tapping his foot along to the beat and he had to admit that he'd liked the song quite a bit. “Who did that one?”
Dean tried not to roll his eyes. She wasn’t going to let this go. “Fine, come here.”
“What type of outlet?”
“I guess we’ll have to make it a date then.” Was he being serious? Cas found it difficult to tell and he had nothing to go off of except Dean’s voice which hardly gave him indication to one way or the other. He decided to laugh it off, although his mind was racing and his heart started beating faster.
“Ooh, ice cold Cas.”
Balthazar tilted his head slightly and walked over to him. His eyes flickering down to the phone that Cas held.
“Okay. My life is a complete wreck right now. I’m a 25-year-old, man with a mountain pile of debt and so many other things are falling apart right now. For example, I just got dumped and my brother died in a car accident because some stupid ass drunk driver ran a red light and smashed into the driver’s side of the car. Not to mention that I’m in a tiny apartment talking to a total random stranger about my damn problems.”
This went on for three more days. At this point, Dean was seriously concerned. He wasn’t the kind of mushy guy to talk about feelings and emotions but there must have been something seriously wrong with this guy. After a half hour of listening to this guy cry, he caved and tapped lightly on the wall. The crying stopped for a second.
“Dude, why are you here?”
“Fine. You can sleep in my apartment tonight but I'm not carrying you up these stairs.” He went to try to take a step down, but his foot caught on the crumpled step that Balthazar had destroyed. Face planting onto the wooden floor. A heavyweight crashing down onto him seconds before he could even manage to make a sound.
“I chungeeed my mieend,” Cas said. Taking great pains to attempt to speak clearly but even to his own ears, the words had come out sounding like gibberish.
“He wanted to make amends. We’re meeting for lunch in a couple days, we’ll see how it goes.”
“A text from Dean. He, uh, he replied to last night’s text.”

Thank you all for continuing to follow this story and we hope you enjoyed this newest chapter! The next update won't take so long I promise. Feel free to comment and let us know what you think :)
“I do enjoy your singing. Maybe you should sing some Alvis sometime.”
care about the future. Dean doubted he had anything in mind, and he wouldn’t give a fuck if John did have final wishes for his burial; for all he cared they could chuck it in the bin out back and be done with it.
Just as it looked like the other man was going to take a step towards him, Cas bolted for the stairs. The elevator was too close and would’ve made it all too easy for McHotpants to follow him. Under different circumstances, he’d have dreamt and wished for McHotpants to come to find him.
Cas wrote and seconds later he got a text back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well Cas for short, it’s nice talking to you. If you ever want to talk again you know where to find me.”
“You have got to be kidding me,” Cas found himself muttering without notice of the words even leaving his mouth. If Balthazar had heard him speak, he made no comment about it. Instead, he continued to hold out both the bong and lighter towards Cas. An expectant look in his eyes.
“Just how I like it.”
**********
He felt better after his stomach heaved out all of the one sandwiches that he had attempted to eat. The cold porcelain felt amazing pressed against his overheated skin. He stayed there until he knew that he could stand once more. He took a glance at his wrist as cursed under his breath. It was nearly a quarter past 6. Dean would be coming home soon and he had the idea of planning a song that could say all of what his emotions were right now. He walked on shaky legs to his living room and searched for the record that had Elvis sitting with a guitar and a black background. He popped the record in and let it play just loud enough where he knew it could be heard by Dean.
“Do you still have Barney?”
I'm sorry Dean, Cas thought before completely losing all train of thought. He felt heavy weight settle on top of him, but his hearing was drifting like static on a radio. He felt himself disconnect from reality. Didn't feel the clammy hands on his body anymore. In fact, Castiel felt quite peaceful drifting off into the black sea of unconsciousness. He didn't return for a very long time but even in the sea of abyss, his mind would occasionally trail off to thoughts of a better time when Gabriel was alive. Followed by bits and pieces of what would’ve happened if Dean hadn't left so suddenly.
“I need more details on that. What’s wrong with your dad?”
“I found smashing cars with a hammer helpful, but you know, you can paint or something too.”
“Oh, is that another kink of yours? Very bad accents? I must say I look forward to hearing you do a French one.”
Cas tried to fight back a blush and kept his head down as he made his way over to his plate. He didn’t have to look up to know that his brother was frowning.
Dean was back home laying on his bed with his headphones trying to distract himself. He was humming the tune to Traveling Riverside Blues. “See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home. Had no lovin', since my baby been gone. See my baby, Tell her hurry on home. I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone”
Azazel jumps him from behind, a long silver blade in hand, but Castiel ducks as the blade flies over his head, and then he brings his leg out to undercut the other demon. Azazel falls fast, his blade clattering from his hand as Castiel stands tall once more. He scoops the blade from the ground, twirling it with expert precision, and before the demon can even let out a howl of displeasure, the blade is being lodged in his throat. The demon's eyes flicker orange, his skull clear through translucent glowing flesh. And then he is no more, another corpse.
He sent the fucking heart emoji, what the fuck was wrong with him?
“I guess,” Cas replied, reaching out and twisting their fingers together in a loosely firm hold as they entered the library, finishing: “I still have a thing or two to learn about timing.”
Morning had turned to afternoon had moved into evening was inching towards night by the time the door of the bunker opened and Cas walked through it.
Then Dean got up and made coffee and got some half-stale Danish from one of the kitchen cupboards that they could dunk to their hearts’ delight and he got an orange because they were Cas’ favourites and he got the paper for no reason other than that they should have a paper in bed and he came back to his bedroom, hair on end and lips still swollen from making out with Cas and he thought he might explode from the happiness he felt when Cas looked over at him from where he was laying, still in bed, naked, with only Dean’s sheet for cover, hair sticking up unapologetically and the same happy grin on his face that Dean knew he was wearing.
“I thought it was,” Sam smirked into his coffee cup and Dean had to muster all his willpower not to smack the cup right out of Sam’s big, stupid hand.
Dean felt like the room had turned into a vacuum of noiseless self-awareness.
They’d sat under the soft light of the library lamps, next to each other at the big table, reading, muttering to each other if something semi-interesting cropped up.
said the first text and the second text was a link. The fucker had made him a playlist. Dean couldn’t keep the grin off as he pressed the link and was taken to Spotify, where he eyed the titles and his grin felt like it might break his face in half. Cas had put his heart into songs for him.
And now here Cas came, walking down the stairs, carrying five thick volumes in his arms, watching his step before he reached the floor and headed into the library, eyes not meeting Dean’s as he approached the table, setting the books down with a soft moan that did things to Dean he didn’t want to show, so he shifted in his chair, feeling expectant and growing worried it was shining out of his eyes, this blooming, gentle hope that Cas would turn to him and smile in that way that made Dean’s insides catch fire and that he’d say “Coming?” before turning and leaving the room and Dean would know exactly where they were going and he would follow.
Fuck.
Fuck.
When he opened them they grew wide as he realised, with a tremor of horror, that he hadn’t sent the regular smiley, he’d sent the one that was laughing out loud-ing all over the place with eyes squeezed into sideways Vs and a big toothy grin all over its annoying yellow face.
Of course.
“Look, you can text me anytime, alright, if it’s… important.”
There was now a hysterically laughing smiley followed by a heart and that was his reply and what the actual hell was that even supposed to mean?
“Timing,” Cas had repeated, suddenly frowning softly, growing thoughtful, and Dean knew that the mood had turned from irritation to a whole new set of questions and that he’d averted a clipped conversation that never really amounted to anything, following the same pattern of unspoken things that they’d had for a few years now, skirting the issue of… something.
And then there was a swell of emotion and Dean’s eyes grew wet and he thought maybe Cas’ did as well and their foreheads rested together, gently, and the following kissing was a sweet and tender and drawn out affair of light touches and quiet murmurs and then they were holding each other tight and saying words they’d wanted to say for a long time, too damn long, and once that floodgate opened there was no shutting them up, either of them, and honesty became a drug and they talked and talked until Sam banged on the door and yelled for them to get their sore asses out of bed already, Rowena had come back from wherever she went, and reality stepped in, but it wouldn’t ever take over from this; from them. Not ever.
So they left the room to do that other thing they do and as they headed for the library Dean asked:
He typed
That’s what Cas would say. And the corner of Dean’s mouth lifted in a small smile at that thought, and he closed his eyes because fuck, how does he do this? How does he not screw this up? He’d been up against the wall more times in his life than he could count, than he could even remember, but he’d never been scared like this. There was this white-hot fear at the thought of losing Cas again and it simmered over his skin, under his skin, through his flesh and veins and into his blood and it made his heart feel like it was going to stop. If he ever lost Cas again…
And he left the room and he thought oh, I still have his tie like here’s your tie like isn’t this the tie you bought that time like haven’t you missed this tie like it’s so important I give you this fucking useless thing to tie around your neck right now because if I don’t focus on this useless thing I’ll focus on this one thing that matters the most and I know you hate ties but here’s this one back.
Dean squeezed his phone the way anxiety was starting to squeeze at his heart and he threw the covers aside, getting out of bed, stopping as he reached his bedroom door, suddenly unsure.
But he knew why he brought up the tie. And he realised now, eyes locked with that blue, blue sense of abandon, of losing himself, that Cas knew why, too. Because it wasn’t about handing back some useless thing. It was about reminding them both of the touch, the feel of undress, the knock of toe against toe, the cowardly retreat. It was a reminder of everything that didn’t happen that could have. That should have. It was about asking if everything that didn’t happen was what that wink was all about.
And that he shouldn’t be too late. So naturally Dean’s leg had been popping up and down for the better part of three hours, ever since it officially became evening, and as the evening dragged on toward that too late part of settling into night, he was beginning to feel on the brink of exploding with fearful impatience. He wanted to see Cas, he wanted to know they were good, he wanted to move beyond this and leave it behind, and at the same time he wanted Cas to walk across the floor and kiss him stupid. Grab him and hold him and love him. Damnit.
“Just send him a smile back, dude.”
— deleted it.
It was the wink emoticon.
Then Cas smiled back and everything was starlight and Dean almost kissed him then.
— and deleted it with one hard press of his thumb, groaning with irritation at himself.
The FUCK??
It just turned out he didn’t need to say it out loud because there wasn’t any real question of where Cas would live, what he would do, that he was a part of the team, that he wanted to be there for Jack, and with Michael spreading his dark wings over the world, where else could Cas possibly go anyway? Of course he was staying with them, of course they were in this together.
Dean felt sorry that he hadn’t been braver yesterday, it would have saved them both a helluva tense afternoon, but Cas shifted against him, and the warmth of him along the length of Dean’s body made Dean exhale slowly, putting his phone away, feeling the weight of Cas as he had one arm underneath his head, Cas’ head more or less on his left shoulder and, damn, Cas was so damned gorgeous like this, asleep.
The next time Dean woke he could tell it was morning, he could tell it was time to get up, and when he checked his phone it said it was almost ten am, his eyes widening in slight surprise, and then he noticed that he had five messages from Cas. He opened the conversation, goosebumps on his arms again.
“Hey,” he said.
“Why don’t you send him the aubergine,” Sam plowed on, having a noisy sip of his coffee before picking up a nearby newspaper. “Live a little.”
This man was everything.
The time for Sam’s advice was long passed.
“I do hate ties,” Cas confirmed, Dean’s treacherous toes suddenly knocking against Cas’ under the table and Dean was smiling and they weren’t even fucking drunk, but he felt drunk and happy and stupid and fine with it.
He’d wanted to send that stupid heart for days, for weeks and months, for years, from the moment he first met this heart-stopping, soul-healing angel he’d wanted to throw his heart in his face and watch him deal with that, unsettle him the way he’d been unsettled, upturn his world the way his world had been upturned, make the angel fall in love with him the way the angel had made him fall, and fall, and fly.
Home.
But he didn’t.
Why would he send Cas a vegetable anyway?
“Whatcha got?” Dean asked, stopping by the table and looking down at the big black Book of Shadows open on an image of something that looked like a cross between a ghoul and a chupacabra.
For one brief second he actually thought about searching online for the real meaning of the wink emoticon. Could it be just between friends? A platonic wink? It must be a thing. Like different flowers had different meanings. And then he felt like bashing his head against the wall because he was such a major asshole and why couldn’t he text Cas and ask if he was okay?
Dean refused to admit he missed the barely established routine of coffee cup on bedside table, a pause and then fingers soft, soft on his cheek for just the breath of a moment before Cas’ gravelly voice would murmur “Coffee” and he’d be gone again. He refused to admit he missed the unbridled and daring show of intimacy, of understanding. And still, he missed it, with or without the admittance of it.
Almost nine am and Cas would know he’d be up now. Even if he slept soundly he very rarely slept later than eight, so it was time to send a reply. He could just send a wink back? But what if the wink had been some sort of mistake text? Like a butt-dial but closer to the slippery-finger variety? Maybe Cas had sent it and then just thought meh, Dean won’t think anything of it.
"We do have time to spare, sunset is still nearly a half hour away," she says, and Azazel smiles warmly at her. Dean's eyes, watery and red, turn to Cas suddenly, and Cas for the life of him cannot understand what is trying to be communicated to him, as Azazel takes in a breath to begin.
"No, no, we were just having some fun. I hope the Nephilim was no problem?" she asks, bending down to peer into the sack curiously.
,” Dean barely says the word so much as sighs it, and Cas looks up at him with a fond, self satisfied smile.
The hunters have turned away, unable to look upon its brilliance, but Castiel, prone on his back, looks up and up at it as it hovers above them.
Castiel had saved them, and now he was going to die, because Dean didn't know shit about Angels.
“It’s a good thing you have a hard head,” she says, knocking the bruised skin with the gun gripped tightly in her hand, as she passes him. He takes a breath, doing his best to not give her the benefit of seeing him wince, as he opens the driver’s side door and slips into the car.
He doesn’t track the time he spends under the spray, but when he finally exits the shower, his fingers have pruned, and the ache in his muscles has diminished somewhat with the hot water. He grabs his clothes from his duffel, along with his phone and a bottle of ibuprofen, quickly keeping an eye on Jess, her breathing regular enough to mean she is truly asleep at this point.
"Now the things we have collected here, a cupids bow, easy steal, Cherub are just about the cutest of the angels out there- a Nephilim heart, tricky, one of a kind, but very easy to trace and, finally here-
"You know what, I just- I need a shower and about six hours of sleep before I can deal with you," Jess’s voice comes out sharp and final, as she twists the keys from the ignition, and exits the car, her anger so permeable it lingers in the car even as she stalks towards their motel room door.
They say their customary goodbyes, and then Cas hangs up, and goes to set his alarm for six.
Castiel stands and it’s then Dean realizes he is no longer frozen to the ground.
“He should have never been reconnected with his grace, that’s for one- he’s not an Angel anymore, that much power and knowledge has practically fried his brain,” Gabe says bitingly.
The demon lets go of Dean roughly, letting him slump down to the ground with a barely there groan of pain. Somehow though, as the demon stalks around him, Dean manages to stay conscious, as he collects his own blood in his hands, and situates himself upright, back a little less straight.
"Alright enough with the games, the house is warded to Hell and high water, there's no way you're getting in," Dean says harshly, and the demon hums softly, eyes roaming the glowing walls of the farmhouse.
“What are you doing?”
to the poor humans on Earth,” Lilith’s face contorts into a horrible pout as she says this, eyes still boring into Cas’s.
. It makes Dean’s blood boil.
"What?"
The parking lot is still semi dark, the rising sun just peeking over the horizon. There’s a damp chill in the air, as Cas goes to start the car, and he turns the heating on as high as the old car will allow. He sits for a moment, letting the rumble of the engine wash over him until finally, he steps back out to put his own bag in the trunk.
“Now, boys and girls, what really puts the icing on the cake for me; Do you know
When Dean had turned down his grandfather's offer, he's not sure who was more surprised. His grandfather or himself. After the defeat of both Lilith and Azazel, two high ranking demons the Men of Letters had been tracking for decades now, Dean had some leverage to negotiate. He would work under his mother, they would change their policies regarding hunter interaction, and someone else would be voted into the Chapter Head position.
, the angelic coward,” Lillith spits, taking a few menacing steps back in Cas’s direction. “He forbid further action to be taken towards the culmination of the grand fight. He locked Heaven up, and any demon worth their salt who has tried to break seals since then has been destroyed.”
The ghoul doesn't give him time to mourn the life unsaved, as it jumps at him through the dark. Cas thankfully has always been light on his feet and shifts out of the way, leaving the ghoul to crash into the wall. The lights flash on as the ghoul stumbles against the lightswitch, and they both squint in the anesthetic, hospital-like brightness, white tiles reflecting the lights. Cas notices now the funeral director is not the only body in the room, and he gazes, panicked at the two stacked at the other end on observation tables. Neither of them, however, are fresh- dug up corpses for the desperate ghouls.
“Cas are you sure, you’ve kind of just been through something and-”
Gabriel scowls back at both of them, and then down at Cas’s prone form, in Dean’s lap.
“In a strange, baffling turn of events this seraph, turned the tides in Heaven, Michael
“I don’t think you knew exactly what would happen, not that I even know what happened, but I think you knew it wouldn’t go well. I think you’re self-destructive. You’re not always the victim Cas, you can tell yourself that you are every day of your life and you can keep ruining things for yourself and pushing people away but in the end, all you’re doing is spinning your wheels and going nowhere.”
The bell rang, alerting Cas to an incoming customer. It was an elderly woman with a cloud of white hair on the top of her head. She had a kind smile and came to him asking for a bouquet of tulips, telling him they were for her granddaughter. He went around getting the flowers for her and attempted some small talk.
“I was worried that he was going to go to people heaven, and I didn't want him to, but he did. He’s gone now, Samson. You understand that?”
Samson nodded his head enthusiastically. “I used to have a goldfish and I named him Barney.”

**********
Just after he unlocked the door and headed back to see what repairs they had for that day Brian walked in. Dean looked up from his clipboard. “You’re late.”
“Who needs names anyway.”
A blaze of anger flared up in Dean’s chest like a reflex.
He held out his phone and tried to focus on the screen. Most of the letters on the keyboard he could barely see. He refused to let his brother be right though and he squinted his eyes to get a better view of the keyboard. It only worked to allow him to see a few half-dozen letters. The rest remained to be a smudgy blur. Cas got stuck on how weird the smudgy shapes looked and couldn’t help but wonder what could have made them look that way. Throughout his struggle, Balthazar got up and walked over to one of the pinball machines.
Okay, maybe this was a good place to start, Dean thought.
“Come on Dean, I’ll be a better employee for it.”
“It is! You’re a very handsome man. I’m sure a sweet young woman has snatched you up by now or will be soon.”
Cas ran his fingers through his hair, trying to make it less chaotic, and pulled a little at his shirt to straighten it out a bit. He figured that he didn’t look the greatest, he certainly didn’t feel the most attractive, but at least he could’ve passed as presentable. It was all that he could hope for in his situation.
“Oh yeah, completely okay.”
**********
He felt a little flurry of anger towards her. It surprised him some. It’s just because she sounds pushy. he tried to justify his feelings. And Dean has made it clear that he doesn’t like her so she should back off. He told himself this but there was some underlying emotion there that lurked behind his thoughts. But what else could it be? He couldn’t possibly be jealous. No, he was simply reacting out of a sickly feverish haze. That’s what was affecting his reactions. It had to be.
“Very funny Dean. You must’ve fallen from heaven too ’cause you sound like you landed on your face.”
“Tell him he was an idiot for how he acted.”
Raising his eyebrows, Cas waited for a verbal response to come and rolled his eyes when Balthazar remained to stare at him hazily. “Seriously, Balthazar, how can you even stand the smell?”
“Well, you dancing in your underoos on stage had to be a sight for sore eyes. Wish I could have been there to see it.”
“Shut up! Just get off me and I’ll point out the door to his apartment alright?”
Dean got up from the bed and grabbed his phone. He plugged in the speakers and started blasting Let’s Put the X in Sex.
The clammy hands snaked up Castiel’s legs. Stopping at his waist. Cas felt Jorge's warm breath against his neck. Smelt the foul odor wafting from Jorge’s clothes.
“I can imagine. What do you wear, a beanie and a denim jacket? Some ripped up jeans and maybe a scarf with a big lumberjack beard?”
“You can’t expect me to give in so easily. You’re my brother, Castiel. I was there for you when mom and dad divorced and neither parent was around anymore, I was there for you when you went through your first day of high school, when you went through your first break-up, when you got so drunk that you couldn’t drive home and I was the one who made sure to come get you. I was there when you needed me and I’m not about to stop now just because you tell me to.”
“Maybe I’ll come around sometime next month. It will be my daughter’s birthday and she adores carnations.”
“And you’re going to be living with me now.”
“No.”
“Shut the hell up Balthazar. Can you get your fat ass off of me? You're crushing my spine.” Cas wiggled underneath his brother. Struggling to even move an inch.
“And here I am, backing you up,” she says with a grin, holding out a bloody hand to him and he takes it with a sigh. He grimaces at the gore splattered on his shirt, knowing some of it is on his face as well.
She goes to change after that, leaving him to get their room in order on his own. Of course, there’s never much to pack away anyway, living out of their duffels like they do.
, just hours before sends a shiver down his spine.
The rest of the hunters yell out in protest, stuck watching as Lilith has her fun. Finally she lifts her foot, and lands a kick to the soft part of his stomach, incapacitating him enough to her liking.
They'd taken one ghoul out already tonight, caught her red-handed over the graves, the next would not be so easy after the loss of his partner. But all Cas had to do is follow the plan and then-
"Oh, but we've only just begun, I don't want to stop now," the demon says with a childish giggle, which makes Cas flinch. Jess still doesn’t lower the gun.
The good, the bad, the boring, they’re all his to keep, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
Linda Tran was elected within their first month back at the bunker, a near unanimous victory, and Dean couldn’t have been more relieved. Because working side by side with his mother was more rewarding than he’d thought possible.
"It's an angelic miracle," Sam spits out venomously, and Azazel stops, looking down curiously at the younger Winchester brother.
Lilith’s eyes and mouth erupt with that same bright light, and then her body collapses, eyes burnt from their sockets. Dean can only stare as Castiel's eyes turn on him, an unreal shade of blue, expression impassable and all knowing. Something moves behind him through the dark and Dean quickly shouts-
His brain supplies suddenly, although from all his experience in the world he doesn’t think he's ever encountered the language before.
"We could get out, you know. There's nothing keeping us from just- stopping," Jess says, her voice lower, nearly a whisper now, as she stares ahead at the darkened road. Cas swallows, sinking back into his seat with a frown.
Cas leans back then with a sigh, which means directly into Dean’s lap. When Cas notices this, he blinks up at Dean for a moment before saying.
The ghoul jumps him then, in either a show of extreme bravery or else extreme malice, taking Cas off guard. They go down hard, and Cas's head hits the tile floor with a sickening crack, a sound that unsettles even him.
“There was a coup in Heaven that ended nearly forty some years ago. A lowly renegade angel up and decided that the grand fight between Our Lord Lucifer and his brother Michael wasn’t
“I can only assume his guilty conscience is what kept you along for the ride after.”
"Azazel if you would be a dear, the rest of my spell casting equipment is in the back seat of my car. Get it for me?" Lilith asks sweetly, not taking her eyes off Cas.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you break your promise to me," Cas says, voice rough and unsteady, and Dean raises his eyebrow at the exchange. Gabe waves it off easily enough, with a shrug.
“Little town called Good Intent. I like the sound of it. It seems cozy.” Castiel can hear the smile in Garth’s voice as he speaks, the only person he knows who could call a hunt
And the thing is, Dean doesn't think he’s ever been happier. The things that he thought he was missing, the pieces of the puzzle he wasn’t sure where to place, it's like they’d all clicked suddenly. It’s not perfect by any means, it’s still life, it’s still their crazy messed up world of demons and angels and monsters under beds. But they'd stopped the apocalypse, they'd saved the world, and they'd made it out the other side still intact.
Angels. Dean blinks down at Cas, as the thought hits him full force.
“It’s very much different! We put up boundaries, so the human soul never actually touches our grace. What you put in him was an unrestrained atom bomb!”
“If you could just manage it a little sooner next time,” he says with a groan, touching the back of his skull tenderly. He feels a wave of nausea roll through him as he stands, his head starting to ache furiously now that his adrenaline is beginning to wean.
They all turn to see through the dim evening light a casually dressed man on the outskirts of the lawn. He's got a sucker in hand as he lazily walks up to their group. Dean can barely believe it.
"I knew something would happen eventually. Always was like that with you," Gabe says shortly, and Cas nods solemnly at him, a small crease between his eyebrows forming.
"You have to help him. We don’t know how to help him," Dean pleads, and Gabriel shrugs his shoulders, popping his sucker into his mouth.
“He couldn’t have- Cas he couldn’t have-” Jess says shaking her head vehemently, and Lilith tuts back, rocking on the balls of her borrowed feet in morbid excitement.
They all turn to look up at Gabe at the same time, and he looks far from impressed.
It’s Dean's voice that calls out next, and suddenly the front door that Jess had left open slams abruptly shut, as orange gold light floods from between its seams. One of the painted wards comes to life, across its surface burning bright and vivid. As it goes, the rest of the wards around the house flare up. Cas can see them through the windows, around the sides of the house, the place lights up like the 4th of July, and both he and Jess have to turn away from the light show. The demon only watches in rapt fascination.
Warmth rushes through Dean, like nothing he's ever felt before. The physical manifestation of affection and
“I’m not- I’m
"You're the Archangel-“
Lilith's smile falls, and her hands unclasp to land in clenched fists at her sides.
Slowly the light and warmth fades away, and Cas's hand leaves his face. He takes a step back and for the first time in this new state he frowns. The blue light in his eyes flickers, and Dean stands feeling rejuvenated and new, quickly enough to catch him as he staggers backward.
And of course, there was the whole new aspect of having someone like Cas around. It had been three months and still every time they were alone with each other (rare in such close quarters with the rest of MoL) Dean felt like he was being pumped full of grace all over again. There are bumps, of course, Cas is still an annoying grump most of the time, only coaxed out of his shell by strong coffee and increasingly stupid jokes. And Dean is still sometimes an asshole, because of the stresses of reorganizing a whole chapter of the MoL or just dealing with his insane family, but Cas never lets the bullshit slide, and it’s easy then for Dean to snap himself out of whatever funk he's fallen into.
"Thank you, all the same," he says, and Gabe nods once with a smile.
“You’re a moron,” Jess doesn’t so much as whisper as she does brokenly sob, and Cas pats her back stiffly, as Dean watches on awkwardly.
“Now, would anyone else like to interrupt?
“And the snag?” he prompts, and Lilith levels him with a searing look.
“Right, okay.”
When he does return to the room, Jess is up, perched on the edge of the bed, blinking awake slowly. She takes the coffee without comment, nodding her head to him in silent thanks.
Jess gets back seconds later and moves in past him to lay down her own duffel.
“You can’t leave him like this,” Jess yells from beside Cas, looking just as, if not more, righteous than an actual Angel of the Lord.
“No, nope- I’ll just go-
“Castiel! Good to hear from you at- 2 in the morning,” Garth’s voice, scratchy with sleep jumps through the phone speakers and Cas cringes slightly. He hadn’t even considered the time of night.
As the final wards activate, Dean steps out of hiding, his hands up and face determined. Next is Sam around the other side of the house, similarly with raised arms, and the demon claps her hands together in unconcealed glee.
And he calls it.
“No, no- well,
"She's dead isn't she, you wouldn't have made it here if she wasn’t."  Cas doesn't say anything, just waits and keeps his focus open for the sounds of approaching footsteps, waiting for-
"Oh dear, it seems I have. Alright, here's your extra credit question. What do you think all those things have in common- besides the obvious, of course?" Azazel asks as those Xanthos eyes scan the tense faces of the hunters before him.
"Yeah, and I’ve got a million of em' what's it to ya?" Gabe snaps back, and Dean tries to keep himself calm as Jess and Sam watch in bewildered silence.
“Oh but he did! He did! He set it all up nicely, waited until I was already in the house, choking the life out of your father, and still he waited just to make sure I was distracted. Of course by then I’d already made quite the mess of your mother’s pretty face. The exorcism he recited did save you though,” Lilith says brightly, tapping Cas’s nose with a childish grin, and he stares back at her blankly, unseeing, unfeeling. Jess on the other hand, is gasping for breath as she sways forward into her hands as tears stream down her face.
“Yes, well- I thought you might have another case for us? We’re finished with the ghouls here, and I don’t believe we plan on sticking around much longer,” Cas says, breathing out a quiet sigh.
"I see someone was prying when they shouldn’t have been. My partner is taking care of things elsewhere. We’re each exactly where we need to be,” she says, and then goes to cup his face gently for a moment before suddenly jerking it down so he’s forced to make direct eye contact with her milky white eyes. All he finds is malice in the nothing there.
"No, you wouldn’t be able to handle it. Take it as a blessing Cassie, not much up there worth remembering. You’ve got good people down here who deserve to take up that space," Gabe says, and for once the joking tone seems to have left his voice. Cas seems about to argue, but then shakes his head with a sigh.
He's been here fifteen minutes already, and the quiet, the still of the building, is becoming increasingly tenser. There's just the room at the end of the hall to check, which, as he knows from his previous tour during the day, is the embalming room. The drains and tile make for easy clean up he's sure.
"That is true, I'm sure I'd burn away before I made it through the threshold. For that matter, no demon could," she says slowly, but there is not an ounce of anger, not even annoyance at this roadblock. Cas can feel his stomach plummet with oncoming despair.
"I don't think I can find peace, Jess. I don't think I'm built for that," Cas says finally, quiet and somber as he brings a hand up to his blood-soaked shirt, gripping the grimy fabric between his fingers.
“I can drive,” he says, but the commanding effect he’d meant to place on the words fall flat, as a wave of pain hits him hard enough to make the world tilt. Jess looks unimpressed, to say the least.
“Why, he’s right here- Aren’t you Castiel?”
of all things and sound sincere.
, standing and seemingly more whole. His back is to them,  Jess and Sam are raising their own heads in dazed bewilderment, as he stalks towards the fallen Lilith.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice wrenches something free from the freezing panic rushing through Cas, and again his struggle to break free continues in vain as he watches
"Yes, quite rare," she says icily, but if Azazel notices he doesn't react to her mood change.
He tries to stand, and fails, reeling from the injuries Lilith had inflicted, and woozy from the blood loss.
"Cutting it kinda close there Cas," she says face pinched and speckled with red, but the relief that washes through him at the sight of her has his head fall back with a sigh. He lets his eyes close as he replies.
“Alright, I think we can swing that, Mr. Renegade Angel,” Dean replies breathily, as a smile he won’t be able to shake for hours, slips onto his face.
The air in Cas’s throat thickens, and for a second it seems almost impossible to breathe. Lilith sensing this lets loose a howl of laughter, that even Azazel joins in on, as the sun touches the horizon behind them. Their shadows stretch and elongate in horrible, monstrous ways and Cas can not breathe.
“It did work though,” he says, slightly taciturn, but the sharp look that gets him shuts him up for the rest of the walk out to the parking lot. The Lincoln Continental, gleaming in the moonlight, looks just as garish as the day Stephen Moore had brought it home, and still somehow it’s a welcoming sight.
"Look out!"
She had of course been royally pissed when she’d discovered the sheer breadth of their little road trip and had barely spoken to either of her sons for a full week. She'd thawed quicker though with the new presence of Cas and Jess. Even Dean is surprised about how quickly they'd been able to acclimate to bunker life. His mother, always a good eye when it came to skilled hunters, took to them immediately. Dean would have almost felt a little bad about how soon she’d dumped them into MoL training, but neither of them seemed to mind the physical or mental challenges presented there.
"Fuck you," Cas spits out, and she laughs softly, as finally, the sun sets. The only light now is being cast by the house, its eerie golden luminescence covering the demon's faces in a Hellish glow.
“Cas-?” He doesn’t have long to question this though as Cas’s hand slips behind his neck and pulls him into a kiss. For a moment all he can do is let it happen, and then his brain catches up with his body in one heady, exhilarating swoop, and he kisses back.
"You know better than anyone, princess, that that won’t do anything to me," she says sickly sweet, taking a step forward, just daring Jess to pull the trigger.
“We can handle the drive, where in Kansas?”
"Well, that one is quite the story. Where should I begin?" she asks, and Azael thinks about it for a moment, his smile twisting into something far more chilling.
"I don't know what you mean," he sighs, pressing his forehead to the cool glass of the window, unwilling to look at her, to see the worry and disappointment that surely mar her features.
At first there is nothing, just Sam and Jess's baffled and mournful looks, as Dean can feel his heart beating out of control, into full blown panic until.
"I think the apocalypse works nicely," he says, and Lilith's eyes, white as they are, gleam in delight.
Jess and Dean hold Cas close until finally the light fades away completely, and Cas's eyes flutter shut. Dean shifts him so his head is laying across his lap, giving Jess a better angle to check his pulse.
"He's your brother isn't he?" Dean snaps, and Gabe's eyes harden.
Jess is at their side quickly, as Cas's skin glows with overflowing Grace.
"And what exactly are you here for?” he asks, keeping himself from fidgeting as her nails dig into the flesh of his chin.
Dean hadn't believed it-
Finally, at the sixth ring, the line clicks.
"They're ingredients- for a spell," Jess finally bites out, her voice low and menacing, and Azazel claps happily at her.
He’d really only meant to set an alarm for the next day, but when he notices the icon of two missed calls from Garth, he doesn't think before pressing redial. He steps away from the bathroom door as the phone rings out, echoing slightly in the tiled room.
Castiel steps closer to Dean's kneeling form, face bloody and broken, and he tenderly cups his cheek.
“I think I’m actually looking forward to this hunt- after these ghouls, a salt and burn sounds like a vacation,” she says, as she tosses her duffel bag into the trunk of the Lincoln, and pulling out the handgun she’d hidden behind her jacket out, checking it over as she walks closer.
And it answers.
“What-?” she chokes out, voice thick with worry and fear and Lilith hushes her softly as Azazel finally comes back with his arms full. A pewter bowl, a mortar and pestle, a long silver dagger.
“I thought you were supposed to be my backup?” Jess lets out a harsh laugh as she wipes the machete’s blade against her already dirtied jeans, and then sheaths it in one clean move.
"Negotiate? It’s sweet you'd think I'd trust a Winchester like that. No, see I need Cas here, he makes the next steps so much easier," she says with a dreamy sigh turning back to Cas to run a finger along his cheek, he winces away from it but she just grins wider.
“You-
“I know and I- I’ll try,” he says, and he thinks he means it. He hopes for Jess’s sake he means it.
"That's bullshit and you know it- this was just like the werewolf case in San Antonio, and the poltergeist in Bedford and God, I don't know how many before. What happened to dad wasn't your fault, and if you don’t stop treating each hunt like some- punishment for it I- I don't know what I'm going to do," she breaks off, her voice harsh with disappointment.
"If you touch a hair on anyone’s head I will not stop until you are left in the farthest pits of Hell for all eternity," he hisses back, and her smile wavers for just a fraction of a second. In the next, she's letting out a rushed giggle, too high pitched to be sincere.
As his breathing becomes more difficult, Lilith's chanting grows louder still, and the wards on the house flicker furiously. The ground beneath them begins to shake, as his vision begins to blacken.
“Well, I hope the concussion was worth it,” she says with an obvious eye roll, as she wraps her arm under his, taking the weight off his shaking legs.
“I’m okay,” he says unevenly, even as Dean has to put a steadying hand on his back to keep him sitting upright.
” Dean asks, surprise and joy making his mouth do an awkward mixture of a smile and gasp. Cas doesn’t seem fazed by this and simply repeats.
"Jess I don't-"
"How did you- it shouldn't be possible!" Lilith howls, her face screwed up in fear and confusion, but Castiel does not falter as he stalks her, hand outstretched, as she tries to scuttle backward, like a small, easily squishable bug.
“Let me reiterate, you have a concussion, give me the keys.”
“Jess would you mind, for a moment?” Cas turns away from him abruptly, and Dean looks up in shock, having half forgotten Jess was even there. She looks between the two of them, something dawning on her as she quickly wipes her face of tears.
have believed it, that the man he'd know this past week could have been an Angel at any time. Grumpy, and sardonic, as human as they come as Lilith had said. But here,
The shotgun goes flying from Jess’s hands as the demon calls out-
,” he gasps out, and Lilith’s head snaps back laughter dying as she steps closer till they're nearly nose to nose.
The light went out, the darkness of the evening settled and it was only as Lilith let an ear splitting shriek that he allowed himself to look back up from his protective huddle.
," Azazel stops and looks at the still glowing house enraptured by it. No one breaths, no one makes a sound.
Grace.
"Would the Winchester's come out now, I have so been wanting to see you for myself,” she calls out, ignoring Jess easily as her white eyes stare deep into the depths of the house. There is quiet, and Cas hopes, nearly prays that they had enough sense to run.
Dean blushes prettily. “You know what. The love thing?”
“I don’t want you to move on.”, Dean whispers. “I want you to come with me.”
07:00 pm. Saturday. Dean looks at his wristwatch. Make that 07:06.
So it goes.
“We are very diligent in our work.”, Anna butts in and comes closer to Cas and Dean. They’re all still standing and neither one of the siblings has offered Dean anything to drink. Maybe that’s for the better, anyway, Dean doesn’t think that alcohol would be the best move as of right now.
“I’m jealous, okay? I’m fucking jealous. I’m jealous that you’re here now, that you’re happy here, without me, that you have a great freaking boyfriend and I know you don’t need me, I know. But I wish you did, I wish you needed me. I don’t want you to find happiness with people who aren’t me and Sam. I don’t want you to find a home here, where I am not. It’s selfish, it’s so goddamn selfish of me to feel this way.”, Dean slams his palms onto the steering wheel, accidentally causing the car horn to blare.
“No, it is a friendly gathering. Please excuse me for a moment.”, Castiel says and promptly closes the door, without waiting for a reply. So, there Dean stands, with his stupid wine, on a stranger’s front porch, not knowing what to do or what to make of the situation. But now, there’s noises inside the house, Castiel’s voice, Anna’s voice.
“Are you hungry?”
It feels like home.
Dean shakes his head and shrugs. “Or something.”
Castiel watches George’s eyes widen comically. “Oh, uhm, this is George, Steve’s… yeah… mmh, you remember me?”
Dean puts his bottle of Merlot onto the kitchen counter, right next to the olives Cas had talked about. “So”, he says. “How did you two end up at Sandover?”
“Heya Steve!”, Bry greets him and his gaze falls upon the other man in the room. “Uhm. Hi.”
Castiel nods excitedly and staggers off towards a CD-player from three centuries ago. With a click, he presses play and the nostalgic sounds of ABBA are filling the room.
“Mr. Adler is fifty-four. That doesn’t seem old.”, Anna tilts her head to the side. That’s a thing the both of them do quite often, Dean thinks to himself.
“Of course, I apologize.”
“I know you probably don’t want to hear it. But I’m sorry. I am.”, he says softly. “I can’t imagine what it must be like for you, becoming human. I just wish.”, he grips the steering wheel tightly. “I wish you allowed me to be along for the ride. I want to help.”
“Please. Do you hear me? Please talk to me. You’re my best friend. I don’t want to lose you. I’m sick of losing people I love.”
“Cas. Cas!”, Dean calls after him and he hears heavy steps follow him. A hand on his shoulder yanks him back around to face the man he’s so desperately in love with.
“Cas, I’m no longer asking. I’m taking you with me.”
“What do you see in that guy?”, Dean asks gruffly. “He seems pretty vanilla.”
“Sure. I’m Anna and this is Cas…tiel.”
“Nice to meet you.”, Ms. Milton says with a polite smile; Mr. Novak nods in agreement. His hands are held stiffly at his sides.
Cas sighs and lets him in. His heart feels like it’s about to jump out of his chest.
“Right. Sorry, that was a bit too personal, wasn’t it? For the first day, anyway.”, Dean enters the sales department, the siblings following closely behind him.
“Do you, Dean?”, he asks, voice ice cold. “I have made earthshattering mistakes, I have forsaken my kin, I have… and now I’m human, I am just a man. I have learned to brush my teeth and iron my clothes. I have learned to live with back pain, sometimes neck pain, both just from sleeping in this aging body, which is a necessity to me now. I have to eat, I have to drink, I have to urinate. I’m coping with it. I’m doing my best now, being just human. I have friends that like me being human, that don’t know me to be anything else – they don’t need my powers, they just like to spend time with me… for me. And I like them, too. I like Bry, I like George—”
“Why are you here, Dean?”, Cas questions.
“Dean, I… I don’t know what you want me to say.”, he huffs. “I miss you guys, too, but. Things are different now.”
Then:
“Dean, please don’t do this to me. I’m trying to move on but you make it really hard for me.”, he utters, defeated.
The night shift isn’t necessarily Cas’ favorite but he doesn’t complain. He likes working at the gas station, working with Nora. Even if he has to babysit every now and then, he doesn’t mind it, not after the first time. And, luckily, there haven’t been any supernatural occurrences either, since then. He hates cleaning the slushie machines, though.
“That is fine. Thank you for coming.”, Anna says and picks out one single peanut from one of the bowls. She gingerly puts it inside her mouth and chews, swallows. “Interesting.”
George shrugs and sinks back down on Cas.
“I’ll hold you to it, Cas. Don’t think I’m gonna leave you alone if you don’t. As I said, I know where to find you. I know Bryan smokes weed. I’ll come visit every so often to haunt you.”
“I think so.”
Castiel gasps. “Dean. I know you don’t like him but I do, please be a bit more respectful. He’s done nothing wrong except…”
Dean leaves not long after their falling-out. Life itself goes on, as it always does. Cas continues to work at the Gas’n’Sip and continues to live at Bry’s. He continues to date, or something, George. He convinced them that Cas is his middle name.
He grabs the Merlot he brought with him with resolution and exits out of his car and makes his way towards the Milton-Novak house. It’s a normal house, nothing out of the ordinary. It’s white, is what it is. Dean doesn’t know what he had expected. He grips the bottle in his hand tighter, then pushes the doorbell. No noises are coming from inside. Then, steps. The lock unlocks. The door opens.
“Make sure that it really is soon, Cas.”
“And that phone call where you two were… busy. I wanted to drive here and. Kill him. But instead, I just.”, Dean makes a crude hand gesture. “But it felt empty and meaningless and honestly… pathetic that I would just jerk off to my best friend, whose trust I’ve betrayed, while he has sex with someone that isn’t me.”, he spits out. “And I was thinking, too, that I could be real sweet on you, kiss you afterwards and make you a cup of joe. Rub your feet.”
One night, he gets a call. He can’t answer it, of course, because George is sitting on top of him, impaled on Cas’ dick and Cas is unable to concentrate on much else.
They’re sitting in the Impala, Dean in the driver’s seat, naturally, with Cas sitting shotgun.
Dean swallows again. Nods. Looks away.
He starts to spend a lot of his free time with George, who likes to call him
“Do you really want to stay?”, he asks.
Dean lifts a hand to stop George. “Don’t care, actually.”
“Okay, well. Break up with your boyfriend. I wanna be the rebound.”, Dean grins at him. “Sam will be happy to have you back, too.”
He doesn’t mention that he finds it strange that they worked at the exact same companies at the exact same departments their entire lives, according to their CVs. That’s none of his business. All he needs to know is that the siblings are competent and seem nice enough.
“Hey, Cas.”, he says.
Like the coward he is, hoping that Dean hadn’t seen him come out of the front door, Cas makes his way back inside to use the backdoor. He feels guilty but he doesn’t want to talk to Dean, he doesn’t, he doesn’t.
“They both will be in sales, so, Mr. Winchester, if you would be so kind to show them around, yes?”, Mr. Adler says, making Dean jump in his seat in the conference room.
here. Are?”
“Cas?”, George questions.
“George!”, Dean sneers. “You’ve known him for what, a few months? And you. I’ve heard you two fuck on the phone, I know that that’s what it was.”
He takes a deep breath in and then sighs it out. He’s dressed in only jeans and a button-down flannel because it’s still a mystery to him what kind of party this is going to be. Hopefully nothing too fancy. At least it’s a nice flannel, he muses. Dean groans and puts his face into his hands. “Should I have emailed them to ask for the dress code?” And who else is even going to attend this get-together?  Nobody from sales is going to be there, Dean knows this. Just him, Anna and Castiel. And probably strangers – well, friends of the siblings.
The song stopped and he heard a ring. Another one. He didn’t want to look at his phone, he knew who it could be. Holding his breath, he checked anyway. John. Ring. He shouldn’t answer it. John has been out of his life for eight years now, and there was no reason to bring him back in. Ring. Maybe he should answer, just to see what he has to say. It can’t hurt, and if something happens he can just end their relationship again. Ring.
For a second he doesn’t speak.
Samson gave him a toothy smile. “I like being with you, Deanie. Can you play superheroes with me? ”
“Let’s say, that they didn’t get the reference but you are really into the person?”
In the morning, Cas woke up to the smell of bacon and coffee being made, and a stiff pain on his lower side. It was another chore of shifting onto his back with grunts to accommodate his movements. As he huffed in relief when weight was finally off his side and his body sagged more onto the bean bag, the back of his hand bumped against his phone that was starting to slip down behind his back. Reaching for it, he took care to move slowly to save himself from more pain, while also trying to remember the last thing he did last night. A passing thought on smudges was the last memory he could manage to pull up.
He heard some shuffling and knocking around before there was a response.
“That was my neighbor, and you made out with his ex the night before.”
Balthazar regarded him coolly before saying, “I didn’t ask, Cas. When he came over we exchanged a few words and it was after that he asked if he could speak to you. I figured you didn’t want to see him, but the guy looked desperate, ya know? And I kinda pitied him, so I gave him your phone number.”
“Yes. What were you even going to do anyway? Stalk the hallways? Be a creeper and stand outside different doors?” Cas took his brother's hand. Struggling to help him stagger up to his feet. Balthazar nearly dragged Cas down to the floor as he leaned heavily against Castiel’s body.
“Damn it, Balthazar, you did not just break the fucking stairs,” Cas grumbled. He looked down at his brother sprawled out on a flight of stairs. One foot had gone through a water damaged step. His head had crashed nearly through another step.
She didn’t even skip a beat. “Okay, that’s going to be Gallager’s Funeral Home and Crematorium up on 32nd and Pine. It’s going to be a couple of days before you can pick up the remains because they conduct cremations on Thursdays and Mondays.”
Cas rolled his eyes. Had he honestly expected anything less from Dean? Dean would forever be Dean. It was something he hoped would never change.
A phone laid in the palm of his hand. His own phone to be exact, and it was opened to message Dean. He wanted to talk to him. After all that had occurred, Cas couldn’t stop himself from missing Dean. The intense longing to have even a small conversation with him, struck Cas senseless.
, he thought, chuckling. Cas began to type out his message.
“I’d rather the accent. I don’t share all that well,” Cas said, thinking to himself that if he ever did get to see Dean in person he would die of embarrassment.
“Sounds like it. I’m a sweater kind of guy myself. I’ve never known fashion. It’s getting kinda late and I know I’ve got to get to the store by 7 tomorrow. I think I’m going to head to bed.”
Dean got up and stretched out his limbs, trying to work out the stiffness of the night. In the moments in between being asleep and being fully awake, he almost forgot the night before. Just as he was about to head to the bar to meet Eric, Viv, and Stacy he got a call from his father. Really he knew it was ridiculous, but talking to his dad, no, not his dad, John still triggered something in him. Every time he heard his voice images of screaming and drunken fights washup to the forefront of his mind.
“He must really be something special.”
Thank you for still reading!
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was woken by the sound of a door slamming somewhere in the house. He faintly wondered who the hell was coming into his apartment at this time of night before remembering where he was. Eric, the bar, Cas. Cas. He pulled the covers closer around him. Suddenly he began hearing voices from the rest of the house.
He retreated back to his desk to battle the ever-growing mountain of paperwork on his desk.
Castiel watched his brother walk out of view before he looked down at his phone again. Regardless of what Balthazar had advised, there was no way for him to outright ignore the text. And although the text may have been sent in pity or a way to get out of the situation, Cas still couldn’t bring himself to simply stop talking to Dean.
Cas pondered on whether he should tell Dean about the boy and how he was thinking maybe he’d follow through with a date if the guy ever showed up at the shop. He nearly considered against it, but hearing Dean talk this way amused him too much.
A couple of hours before closing Dean heard the door to his office open. He looked to find Eric standing in the doorway.
“Everyone has their shit they need to deal with, I guess this is just mine.”
Thinking of someone else making passes at Dean left a sour taste in the back Cas’ mouth. He didn’t like it but amounted his feelings up to it just being because the girl was being rude. Cas didn’t even have a reason to be jealous. So why was that sourness still there?
Dean was stunned, he wasn’t sure what he had expected but it wasn’t that. John had put him through a lot. He had done awful things, could Dean really let that back into his life? On the other hand, John seemed sincere, he seemed sorry. Maybe he had gotten better as the years went on, perhaps he really did change.
“I missed you too. I’m sorry for how I acted. That wasn’t how I wanted things to go when I got home. All I could think about when walking here was what I was going to say to you, and I completely messed it up by reverting back into a brat. I did like that song that you were singing though. I’ve heard it played on the radio once or twice.”
He settled himself against the wall and asked, “What are some good bands to listen to?”

“Ssstop Balthy, I know what I am doing,” Cas spoke in a slow manner. All his words felt too long coming off his tongue and it was difficult to even remember what he was trying to do. The whole sensation made him laugh until he saw a hand come for his phone. “No!” He loudly protested. “I want to talk to him.” Cas hugged his phone close to his chest. He childishly stuck his tongue out at his brother before dissolving into more laughter. There was no way for him to keep a straight face.
Christ, this guy’s life is shit.
Gradually, he stood up straight and fumbled with his keys. It pissed him off a little to see that there wasn’t even that much mail for him. All that work to only find a couple papers advertising for a car loan or if he were interested in joining a local church group. He considered throwing them into the nearest trash can, even looked around the room for one, when the lobby doors swung open and the person who stepped in completely distracted him from his task.
Eric’s face scrunched up in confusion. “I thought you said you were neighbors.”
Cas laughed at himself which led to him coughing into his elbow. He sniffled weakly and prayed that the day would not be a long one.
“Balthazar!”
“Why does it matter to you?” Cas didn’t like Balthazar’s interest in Dean. He wished that Balthazar would leave the whole situation alone.
Cas woke up with a scratchy throat the next morning. At first, it wasn’t too painful and he hoped it would go away as he went through his morning routine, but by the time he poured himself a cup of coffee he felt like a million razor blades had just scrapped their way down his throat. Drinking coffee only made it worse. If Cas could describe the sensation, it would be that he felt as if he were chugging down a gallon of hot lava. In the end, he dumped the rest of the coffee down the sink, made an attempt to sip some water, and when that caused a sharp pang of irritation to erupt from his throat, Cas gave up on the idea of drinking anything today.
“I know what you meant. I don’t want your apology.”
“I don’t think there’s any chance of that Castiel.” His name came off sounding like velvet. A shiver went through him at hearing his full name fall from Dean’s lips. What was this man doing to him?
Cas thought frantically. How should he respond? He wasn’t good at this stuff. He didn’t know how to flirt in person let alone over a damn phone. He couldn’t wait too long or it would look like he didn’t feel that way. But did he feel that way? Cas was overwhelmed and fought to keep level headed. It didn’t help that he was feeling rather tired and would rather text Dean to meet him at his place to watch some movies and maybe snuggle. He could handle that but not actual emotions. Those took way too much work and dammit he still had to respond!
Cas’ feet started moving to the beat more. He didn’t stop himself from getting up to dance a little. It was slow and not at all very good due to his illness, but even with how his body ached, he’d never felt happier. They continued to sing along together. Dean made him laugh by trying to impersonate Elvis’ voice. Cas didn’t want the song to an end, but alas it had to come to an end and when it did he was sitting on the floor with half his body resting against the wall. He was out of breath and more than tired, but it didn’t matter to him right now.
He gripped the phone tighter, feeling like he might float away at any moment.
“I beg to differ, good sir. I find it quite amusing.”
“Yeah, well, I guess I’m gunna have to check my closet and see what we can work with.” More nervous laughter came from Dean in a few short chuckles. Cas was quite proud of himself to cause such a reaction.
“Men. Well, the first one we went to had women, but Balthazar saw I had no interest and decided to take it upon himself to find the closest men’s strip joint,” Cas laughed at the memory. “Shoved a wad of ones into my hand and practically shoved me to the main stage. I got so drunk that night, I hardly remember half the shit I did, but apparently, I tried to get up on the stage and dance with one of the guys. Balthazar found me nearly nude and pulled me down. Has to be the best night of my life.” A surge of guilt dragged down his smile. In all his best of times, Balthazar had been the main cause behind them.
When he took his phone, he didn’t expect to see it pulled up to Dean’s contact on messenger, and he couldn’t remember using his phone last night. Cas attempted to search through foggy sections of the night before when his eyes scanned over the screen. Within a split second, his heart plummeted down to his stomach. A cold chill swept over his body when he saw more than just one text sent by Dean and his own short response. By then, Cas could remember the frustration and determination he had felt while texting this to Dean.
